<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty gulped looking up at the dragon goddess,&quot;A-As... tempting as that offer is... I just don’t see myself as a god or goddess like yourself, I’m sorry I just.... can’t accept that offer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nazaric paused then sighed,&quot;A great shame, however, no matter, for as long as I have longed for companionship I do have an eternity of time to find another. But I simply cannot be a god of a dying race now can I? I’ll just have to find something else for you then dear human, hmm....&quot; Nazaric paused and you watched her shift back into the male body fully endowed and musky as he put his claws to his chin and thought for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... pardon me but.... something else?&quot; Ty muttered and Nazaric nodded,&quot;I can’t let an omnipotent mortal like yourself left unchecked now can I, especially one who has no restraint. I will at the very least brand you as my disciple, but as for what you can do for me....&quot; Nazaric then paused and smiled,&quot;Heheh, well now, I believe I have a solution that will solve both of my problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Hold on.... what do you mean...?!&quot; Ty cried out scared as the dragon god raised his hand and said,&quot;Fear not, I can assure you that this will be more pain than pleasure on your part, and I will be gifting you to one of the most faithful of male’s to me. Considering your wish granting abilities, and my blessing of your new form I picture you shall rise to the status of a high arch-priestess, Queen, or perhaps they may even worship you for being touched by me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as Ty was about to respond Nazaric snapped his finger and suddenly Ty was forced involuntarily onto all fours, and despite his best struggles he couldn’t budge from his position. &quot;A-Aaaagh! Ack! I-I can’t move! W-What are you doing?!” Ty screamed as the large dragon god leaned down and licked one of  clawed thumbs and pressed it against Ty’s rear which made him shiver.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may view this as a curse, but in time you will see it as a blessing. Before I do what I am doing I only plead that you don’t take this personally, I am not a creature of wrath, now...&quot; Nazaric cleared his throat then started chanting in some weird unknown language and suddenly the god’s thumb started to glow and warm up. A circle of foreign symbols formed at Ty’s feet when dark blue markings suddenly grew up along his body, painting him like a canvas with symbols and all sorts of strange markings. Immediately following this Ty’s groin would grow uncomfortably hot and his muscles tensed up, and Ty understandably was panicking and screaming the whole time, but his arms and legs felt like they were glued to the floor using the most top of the line super glue.<br />
<br />
Ty soon noticed scales emerging all over his body, these scales were accompanied by large plated scales overtaking his stomach and chest. However what became immediately apparent to Ty was that the scales on his arms, legs, and back were a vibrant magenta color, and the plates on his underside took a nice lavender hue of purple and his body started to change shape and proportions but none that all seemed too masculine. Ty’s heart then dropped as he recalled what Nazaric mentioned about being regaled as a Queen, Priestess, or goddess and alarm bells immediately went off in his head before his fears were soon confirmed by a couple of nipples emerging on his chest they immediately started to swell out forming two mounds on his chest before feeling an unsettling sensation in his groin like something pulling into his body before a strange new opening formed in the area where his manhood should’ve been. &quot;H-Huh?! Wait wait!! You’re making me a female dragon?! I don’t want to be a female dragon, please!!!&quot; Ty screamed then almost hit his tongue after hearing his voice turn high pitched.<br />
<br />
Nazaric wasn’t deterred from this ritual however, and he continued to chant while Ty’s body continued to change. Ty’s humanoid hands and legs cracked and took on a new skeletal structure, his legs taking on a digitigrade form as his spine cracked as his head and neck started to shift and change in size and shape. Ty’s hind legs now had three large toes and his fingers merged on his hands giving him a strange copy set of his hind legs in place of his arms except with opposable thumbs that matched his other terrifyingly large clawed fingers. Following this Ty’s neck got longer and thicker as his hair fell out only to replaced by the same scales plaguing everywhere else on his body, and soon he found his face stretching out into a snout while a set of horns emerged from his skull and his ears started taking a dinner shape. <br />
<br />
By now Ty knew there was no going back, but as he or she closed her eyes and started hoping for the best bit by bit she started understanding some of the dragon’s foreign tongue. Occasionally Ty would catch words like,&quot;Bless.... Holy....&quot; and,&quot;Breed,&quot; which started to make Ty feel unnerving while her teeth changed as well as her tongue, which now became formed and she could suddenly taste how the air smelled all around her as well as the aroma of musk coming from Nazaric’s member. Ty then felt three new odd protrusions from her back and right above her ass as she noticed her thighs and hips thickening and growing outwards to give her a nice round rump. She already knew what these protruding objects were from her body, it didn’t take a genius to know that she needed wings and a tail to become a true dragon, but god did it feel weird to suddenly watch two new limbs form on her body and move around like they were her hands or legs. The wings were huge, and almost trice the length of her body when spread out fully, and the tail was nice and long and had a heart shaped golden spike on the end. This was followed by a number of more golden spikes growing out along Ty’s back from the tip of her tail to her head, and after that all of her claws and both her horns turned shiny and golden as well, and shined like they were freshly polished.<br />
<br />
Before Ty could even contemplate how hard it was going to be to adjust, or even possibly admire her new body, she suddenly started to comprehend the full sentences Nazaric was speaking in his own tongue. &quot;...Grant her the knowledge of her body, give her the instincts of our kind, and the immortality of a deity. Grant her kindness. Grant her courage. Grant her bounty, passion, and love for the eggs she shall bear, and the countless hatchlings she shall spawn....&quot; Nazaric chanted and suddenly Ty felt her heart sink even more than before and she started to tremble in fear,&quot;W-What....?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then suddenly Ty’s nethers started to heat up and her stomach started to growl and gurgle as she felt a churning feeling inside of it making her growl and groan in pain. &quot;Spirits of nobels, spirits of kings and queens, spirits of lordS, spirits of warriors and damsels, and spirits of heros and peasants alike hear my call and perform one last duty for our race. Come to me and hear my voice, the voice of your father, mother, and celestial god, and give your spirits to this maiden, and your souls to her womb. Give her care, give her passion, give her love, and give her eggs, and you shall be reborn as large clutches of eggs from her womb~&quot;<br />
<br />
The markings grew brighter and the pleasure reached a critical moment in Ty’s new folds causing her to climax before suddenly her stomach started to swell as well as her breasts, which certainly wasn’t the most comfortable sensation to respond her part. Ty’s breasts and stomach just got larger, larger, and larger to seemingly no end, and she grunted and growled as she did her best to support her body’s new weight, for once she was thankful to be on all fours. Ty let out a small whimper and looked up at Nazaric, who now looked down at her before snapping his fingers once more. The markings on Ty’s body suddenly stopped glowing, the circle beneath her claws had disappeared as well as the invisible restraints on her four legs. However despite all of this, Ty groaned feeling her belly churn as her legs felt weaker, her belly was as large as a prized biggest pumpkin at a county fair, and her breasts looked like two large basketballs that were currently dripping with milk.<br />
<br />
Panting heavily from everything that just happened, Ty looked up at Nazaric after looking over her new body, and understandably growled,&quot;W-What the fuck?!?! W-What the hell... d-did you do to me?!?!&quot; Ty then paused after hearing herself speak, suddenly realizing she was speaking in the same weird language Nazaric was using.<br />
<br />
&quot;My enchantment worked it seems, you seem fluent in draconic, and you should know how to fly, breathe flames, and have all the survival instincts you need for what you will be doing soon enough as my blessed broodmother,&quot; Nazaric stated<br />
<br />
&quot;B-Broodmother?!&quot; Ty roared out before blushing and putting her front claw on her belly, feeling all of the eggs inside all tightly squeezed and snug in her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you are my disciple, one who can commune with me whenever you wish, that belly is my gift to you and your new responsibility. You now bear the young souls of formerly deceased dragons in your belly seeking rebirth, some will recall their past, former memories, former lives, and everything by the time they hatch. Others aren’t so lucky and have already been stripped of their selves from the purgatory of the afterlife, lucky for you, you won’t need to experience that since we both are immortal.&quot; Nazaric explained<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What...?! I-I..... Huh?!....&quot; Ty was completely dumbstruck, in awe, and extremely nervous all at once.<br />
<br />
&quot;You also bear the children and clutches of the souls inside of you who have decided they’d rather have a sibling bond to spawn they sadly never sired nor bore like you are now. That seal on your body is like a pocket dimension for your womb to hold all of your eggs, making sure you don’t feel all of their weight. I don’t know how many millions upon billions, perhaps even trillions or quadrillions of eggs you hold inside of you, but I intend for you to have an infinite amount of eggs to lay so that our kind doesn’t die again.&quot; Nazaric exclaimed,&quot;Now before you start to get emotional and take your anger out on me I must procure you a suiter for you. You’ll be happy to know that if you are impregnated by a male dragon, their seed will halt the process inside of your womb, and you will birth that clutch before continuing to birth the others, and you’ll be happy to know that I made sure that the time between each clutch you lay is rather generous for now since you are new to your body.&quot; Nazaric added before Ty whimpered,&quot;I-I w-wish I-I was human me again....&quot;<br />
<br />
However nothing happened, and Nazaric sighed,&quot;I told you that your power does not overwrite mine young dragoness maiden. Now, allow me to speak to my followers and find you a suitable male out of what few remain.&quot; Nazaric then closed his eyes for a brief moment before he opened them and said,&quot;There, I have found one... and they are the most promising candidate to receive you as my gift. If you require my guidance, simply wish to speak with me dear Ty.... now let’s welcome you to my world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly a pillar of light shot up all around Ty, and she screamed loudly before realizing everything was fine, and that the light didn’t hurt at all. She heard Nazaric’s voice faintly through the light,&quot;As my most devoted and honorable dragon, I grant you a gift and responsibility to rekindle the flames of our race, protect your gift with your very life now.... my loyal disciple.... and friend.....&quot;<br />
<br />
The light all around Ty slowly disappeared and suddenly she found herself in front of another dragon, a male dragon, but where was she, and what did this dragon look like?</p>
