<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris lead Ingrid into the barn and locked her in a large paddock filled with hay. &quot;I&#39;ll not be long, You may as well stuff your face full of hay whilst I&#39;m gone&quot;. Ingrid did so and also let out a sharp Moo which translated to &quot;You bastard&quot;. Chris walked into the breeding paddock. It was empty. He locked the door and walked over to a corner filled with hay. He set the gun up so it would shoot at him. And it did. His hands started to turn black &quot;Wait what...&quot; He knew this was going to happen but he didn&#39;t know it would feel like it did. His shoes started to rip as his feet grew into hooves, He used what was left of his hands to pull of his shoes. He tried to stand but he was forced onto all fours. Next to his surprise was a odd growth in his Testicles. They started to grow at a alarming rate, and within three minutes resembled the size of tennis balls. then his penis grew. It started off erect and worked the way up to his head. A Odd flesh like sheath started to form over it and the foot long penis went inside of the sheath.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What the fuck...&quot; Chris shouted in disgust as he just had his own dick in his face. His body started to get very muscly and bulky. And he looked like one of the men of Worlds strongest men. But only a few moments later he gained alot and I mean a LOT of weight. he lost all signs of his six pack and he thought &quot;Goodbye six pack, Hello 8 pack of chips&quot; He cackled. Blood started dripping onto the soft muddy floor which was from his head. He attempted to look up and he saw that were was two small horns growing out of either side of his head. &quot;THIS R-EALLY HURTS&quot; He screamed trying to sound as manly as he could. His neck started to grow longer and longer and then it stopped. His nose grew into a muzzle and his face started to look like a Muzzle of a bull. His body was covered in a grey fur that started at his head and worked down to his feet.<br />
<br />
His ears grew and moved slightly. He felt a pulling pain behind were the sheath was that contained his penis. Shortly after a tail sprouted out of his buttocks and a small tuft of hair grew out of the end. The only thing left to finish was his horns. They started to discolor and went a darker shade of white fading into black at the top. &quot;Is it over?&quot; he asked himself but all that came out was a Moo of which a bull would make.<br />
<br />
He had fully transformed into a male bull. He looked around and he could smell the pheromones of the female cows, He had lost his human brain and he had the one of a male bull. The scents sent his nostrils wild like they were on some sort of parade. He could also smell something divine and his stomach rumbled. He turned around and took a gob full of hay and munched it down. Then he look at the gun. He had started to like his new life as a Bull and he made a decision to stay this way. He charged at the gun and destroyed it with his horns. <br />
<br />
Shortly after the farmer led in a dairy cow. To his surprise his new pedigree mating bull Angus was stood tied to a post looking at the Dairy cow. It was Ingrid. &quot;Ingrid?&quot; Chris let out a sharp moo and let out a gust of air from his nose. &quot;So... You did this to me and now yourself? You sick bastard&quot; Ingrid was trying to refuse the manly pheromones that Chris&#39; body was producing it was to late. She had already started to get wet and she knew what she wanted. &quot;I WANT TO BE YOUR BULL!&quot; Chris let out a moo of anger and with that the farmer let him off the rope. He ran to Ingrid and mounted her. He pushed in and she pushed out. Her vagina grew to comfort his new penis which was quite big. He pumped a seed in and it reached the climax. The farmer came in and lead Ingrid away. He lead Chris or should I say &#39;Angus&#39; out onto the pasture. Were Chris/Angus grazed.<br />
<br />
<br />
A Few months later Ingrid birthed a Male calf. Named after her father Chris. They both grew to love there new lives. Ingrid produced gallons upon gallons of milk and she was the best dairy cow in the hole of Kentucky. She grazed daily, Gaining more and more weight. And she had sex nearly every month. Angus on the other hand gained a award for the best Bull in the hole of the USA he was used to mate every day and created a lot of pedigree Bulls and Female dairy cows.<br />
<br />
