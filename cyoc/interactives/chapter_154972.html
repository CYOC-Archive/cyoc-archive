<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Had this 95% written from a few days ago. Seemed a shame not to finish it.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steeling himself, James pushed open the heavy wooden from the barn to the Cabin, and stepped in. The change in temperature was noticable. Outside his breath had been frosting, but here he instantly felt warm. He turned as his mother entered the Cabin behind him. Joan paused, nervous of entering and ushered James on first.<br />
<br />
Shaking his head he crossed the hallway, voices drifted out from the kitchen. Familiar voices. One in particular. A chocolaty voice, husky in all the right ways normally. But right now it made his stomach jump in fear. As he rounded the corner to stand in the doorway, he saw the source of the commotion.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is bananas guys. Cows. Horses. Goats. Books of people turning into bears and cougars. All because they said an animals name? You know how mad all this sounds right?&quot;. Melissa stood in the centre of the kitchen, turning rapidly between Henry and Jess. &quot;And take off those fake cow ears Jess. They look ridiculous!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Melissa, Love, please... for all that is Holy, please stop saying animal names!&quot; Henry pleaded, arms outstretched, palms down in a calming gesture. He looked flustered and frustrated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t bother Dad... Damage is looooong since done.&quot; Jess muttered, chin resting in her hand. She looked exasparated; rolling her eyes, which came in contact with James&#39;s<br />
<br />
&quot;James! Look who&#39;s here!&quot; She said with a tired flourish. <br />
<br />
Melissa spun. There she was, dusky skin, wide hips, narrow waist, pert full breasts, toned, bubble butt. A man&#39;s dream. But not Dakota.<br />
<br />
&quot;James!!!&quot; She called, velvety laughter as she flew across the room into his arms. She crashed into him and hugged him tight, arms squeezing around him. James was glad for the heavy coat now, despite the heat. The smell of her rose perfume wafted up to him. The smell he couldn&#39;t conjure only earlier today. Why couldn&#39;t she have appeared yesterday? Things would have been so different. He would never have found out the joy of being fucked.... Heat blushed James&#39;s face, and he forced his mind to move on.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you guys doing here anyway? Why aren&#39;t ye in the national park by now? Ye should surely have arrived last night.&quot; Melissa rapid-fire queried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Last night?&quot; Both James and Jess echoed. &quot;We&#39;ve been gone for weeks?! Has no one come looking for us?&quot; Jess continued, incredulous.<br />
<br />
Melissa made a confused face. &quot;Huh? You guys left like yesterday morning.&quot; She whipped out her phone, showing their open conversation to James; sure enough all date stamps and times matched up. Melissa&#39;s phone was showing the date as over three weeks ago. James exhaled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great... Looks like time is screwey in this place too.&quot; James said to himself, loud enough for Jess to hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh just bloody great.&quot; Jess thundered.<br />
<br />
Something hit James in the following silence. &quot;Melissa! You said an animal name?&quot; He asked her. When she didn&#39;t answer, not paying any attention, he looked up at Jess. She shrugged. <br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s said so many animals, so consistently, in such a rapid, constant stream that I genuinely have no idea. Could be anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry nodded in agreement. James&#39;s stomach went to his throat. Maybe she had said Horse... or Donkey! Maybe that would change things.<br />
<br />
&quot;What anything?!&quot; Melissa piped in, not having listened. &quot;What you&#39;re going to turn into...&quot; James told her, tone neutral.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh not you too. For fuck sake!&quot; She rolled her eyes, then turned back. &quot;Sorry Mr Miller.&quot; Henry waved it off, not bothering. &quot;We tried James, she doesn&#39;t believe us.&quot;<br />
<br />
James frowned. How could she not? He wriggled out of her grasp and stood back. &quot;It&#39;s real Mel.&quot; He said, unbuttoning his coat and holding it open, revealing himself.<br />
<br />
Melissa&#39;s jaw hit the floor. She hadn&#39;t properly looked at James yet. Only now did she take in the tall ears poking from behind his dark hair, that and so much more as her eyes ran down his body.<br />
<br />
His hairless chest sported two, milky white breasts, heavy and full. As big as hers, but less pert, jet black nipples and areola taut. His stomach looked softer too, less rugged; and his hips! They were wider than hers. But that was the least shocking part about them.<br />
<br />
James&#39;s black and brown horse cock dangled limply, pointing at the floor. Melissa ran her eyes over it several times, then bit her lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s real...&quot; She whispered. Behind Melissa, Jess, having caught sight of James&#39;s changed chest and hips gasped and was about to exclaim her surprise, when a sharp. *ttsstt* and a rapid hand motion from Henry cut her off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Best let James explain.&quot; He whispered. Jess turned from Henry to James, and back to Henry, then nodded in agreement. Henry held out his hand, wrapping it around Jess&#39;s soft small one, and helped her to her feet. &quot;C&#39;mon, lets find what&#39;s behind that bloody wall!&quot; Henry spoke softly. Jess nodded in agreement as the two exited the kitchen, scooting past the blushing James and gawping Jess.<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Once in the hallway Henry and Jess came to an abrupt stop. Henry immediately pushed Jess behind him, placing himself between Joan and Jess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Henry... Jess...&quot; Joan said dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joan!&quot; Henry growled. &quot;You got a lot of nerve... Setting us up like that. What&#39;s your game?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s *my* game!?&quot; She exclaimed, incredulous. &quot;What&#39;s yours? I saw you two in the garden...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess&#39;s face reddened. Worst fears were coming true. This was goign to be ugly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw you two fucking... I saw you chose Cow. I saw you chose your own daughter!&quot; She accused, emotion rising in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was an accident!&quot; Henry exclaimed. Joan exploded, &quot;You fucked your daughter by accident!? Chose her as your mate by accident!&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry was staggered by the directness of the statement. He paused and gathered himself. Then, slowly, he stated. &quot;I said cow by accident Joan. I had intended to say goat eventually, if there was no way to get us all out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite everything, Joan knew Henry, she knew for one he was a terrible liar, and he was telling the truth. Before she could say anything though, he continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you know what. I&#39;m glad I said cow. I should have said it the first time you tried to force me to say goat.&quot; There was real anger in his voice. That hurt.<br />
<br />
Behind Henry, Jess gasped in surprise and squeezed his arm. Henry continued as Joan looked on shocked. &quot;You&#39;ve been trying to turn me into an animal since day one, and you&#39;ve tried to sabotage your own daughter. Joan... how could I ever trust you again!?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
Joan thought for a long moment. Silent. The weight of the past few days, nay, the last few years pressed on her shoulders. This was an out, it hurt her that Henry had chosen Jess over her, that there was no reconciling... Part of her still wanted revenge, but mostly because she was jealous that Henry had chosen Jess over her, not that she was actually losing Henry.<br />
<br />
There was no reconciling. This was it. She left out a long exhale. Body calming. Breaths becoming long and steady.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it so... isn&#39;t it...&quot; She said, her voice in sorrow, but the weight gliding from her shoulder. She was free. Free to be herself.<br />
<br />
Henry was surprised at how calm Joan had become, also letting his anger abate. &quot;It... I guess it is...&quot; a pregnant pause descended.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry we never spoke earlier Henry. Maybe I should have said something.&quot; It was strange letting go. They had had good times, but in the end, they just didn&#39;t work out.<br />
<br />
He nodded, then said. &quot;Me too Joan... Me too.&quot;<br />
<br />
A long silence stretched between the three. Jess mind was reeling, sadness and despair at her parent&#39;s falling out; excitement at no longer having to hide anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess... I guess you two want the master bedroom?&quot; Joan ventured. Jess and Henry were taken aback. <br />
<br />
&quot;Err... Thanks but no thanks.&quot; Henry began, &quot;No offense, but that room kind of stinks of goat.&quot; <br />
<br />
Joan smiled a rueful smile, &quot;I guess it does, doesn&#39;t it...&quot; She bit her lip. It would be smelling a lot more like goat now that Henry was out, that was for sure, she could scent the place up as much as she wanted. The smallest dribble of goat urine escaped at the thought, but she caught herself quickly.<br />
<br />
Henry started up. &quot;Well we could take the bedsit, just off the new barn Jess. I imagine, Melissa will want to move in with James upstairs.&quot; He said, facing Jess. Blushing at the thought of sharing a room with her father she blushed, nodding.<br />
<br />
Joan, under her breath muttered. &quot;I don&#39;t know if James will be too thrilled at that idea.&quot; Before saying out loud. &quot;You guys saw the barn?&quot; <br />
<br />
Both turned and nodded. Jess adding, &quot;When we showed Melissa around.&quot; <br />
<br />
&#39;Ah!&#39; Joan thought. &#39;They must have seen the milking stalls then. They&#39;ll no doubt be using them before long...&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well then.&quot; Joan exclaimed aloud. &quot;Truce?&quot; Joan said loudly, holding out a hand.<br />
<br />
Henry regarded the hand for a while, before reaching out and giving it one shake. Joan leaned in. Whispering in his ear. &quot;Enjoy fucking our daughter...&quot;. Henry had the decency to blush, but quickly bit back, &quot;Enjoy fucking goats...&quot;. Both leaned back. Jess, not having heard piped up. &quot;What&#39;re you going to do now Mum?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joan regarded her little girl, all bulging flesh and hard teats. &quot;I dunno, relax, paint, find myself... Maybe fuck some goats!&quot; she said with a wink, then spun and walked off, hooves clopping, to the master bedroom. <br />
<br />
Leaning against the door as she closed it, Joan breathed. &quot;Time to get rid of the cow stink out of this place.&quot; The heavy coat slid from her shoulders and hit the floor. She smiled as she stepped out of its ring, grabbing her cock as she walked over to the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhnn&quot; She grunted as she released her sphincter, and for the first time in a while, really took in the smell of billy goat pheromones, as she liberally coated Henry&#39;s side of the bed. It was heavenly. No more having to hide the scent with perfumes or soaps. She really was free.<br />
<br />
Both her cock began to harden and her mouth tingle at the smell. &#39;DO IT!&#39; she heard the voice call. She turned and winked at the portrait of the hairy man. Too caught up and too at peace, she had enough self control to step back and smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Today I win. I&#39;m saving this for a special occasion.&quot; And she tapped her mouth, as it slid back. Taking up a position by the easel she exclaimed. &quot;Time for another few portraits I think! For posterity!&quot;<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Out in the hallway, Henry and Jess watched Joan disappear. &quot;Now what!?&quot; Jess asked her father, looking up at him. Henry turned and smiled. &quot;Lets find out what&#39;s behind that bloody wall!&quot;. She smiled and nodded as he grabbed her small, soft hand in his and they made their way to the living room.<br />
<br />
A short bit of work was all that was needed to break open the log wall, allowing the contents, dusty tomes, to tumble to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jackpot!&quot; exclaimed Jess, scooping one up. First blowing the dust from it, she next flipped open the old book with a creak of its spine. Eyes scanning the page. She turned it, eyes, scanning again. Then another then another.<br />
<br />
Henry anxious, asked &quot;Well?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess closed it with a thump. &quot;It&#39;s something alright. Full of strange writing, symbols, and drawings. I don&#39;t recognise any of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry frowned. &quot;No use then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess shook her head, &quot;It looks like a cipher. There must be a way of breaking it. It has to be an explanation of what this place is!&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry nodded, &quot;Well... If anyone can figure out this place. You can. You were always the smartest cookie in the family.&quot; Jess blushed, as Henry added. &quot;I never said that if James asks.&quot;. Jess laughed.<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
Moments passed as Melissa&#39;s eyes ran up and down her boyfriend, long enough for him to get so self conscious that he wanted to close the coat again, for fear she found his cum-stuffed mare pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;PPPfffttHahahah!&quot; She eventually let out. James jumped in surprise, tits and cock jiggling. &quot;What?&quot; he said, annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It just looks so ridiculous in a way! It&#39;s absolutely fucking massive!&quot; Melissa reached out and grabbed the cock, tugging, not fully getting a hand around. James recoiled in fear, yelping &quot;OUCH!&quot; loud enough for Melissa to let go with an apologetic, but still amused, &quot;Sorry Jamie!&quot;<br />
<br />
The pet name struck a chord just then. The lack of masculinity of it made James blush, made him think of what he had felt today, made him think of Dakota again. Melissa&#39;s exhale brought him back.<br />
<br />
&quot;PPhheww... Well then. It&#39;s all true. Tits and all! Fucking mad!&quot; She laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re taking this well...&quot; James said, covering himself. Melissa shrugged. &quot;What&#39;s not to love about a footlong cock.&quot; She winked at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah wait until you have one.&quot; James countered, that gave Melissa a pause. Again she shrugged, seemingly non-plussed. &quot;Horses are fairly strong and fit. Could be worse, could be something shit like a donkey.&quot; James&#39;s eyes darkened, &#39;There&#39;s nothing wrong with donkeys&#39; He thought sourly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I have to have sex to find out what animal right?&quot; She asked, curious. James nodded slowly, then added. &quot;Well, any orgasm will do really. Doesn&#39;t have to be sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; She said. Biting her lip, in thought. &quot;No point in waiting I suppose!&quot; She grabbed James&#39;s hand,  &quot;Lets find out what it is then!&quot;<br />
<br />
She pulled him upstairs, just in time to see Henry and Jess disappear into the living room. Once in the upstairs bedroom she pushed James down into a seated position, and began stripping her clothes. James, feeling some cum ooze out of his mare&#39;s pussy to stain the back of his new coat. Shifting he watched her shuck off her pants as she smiled up at him. &quot;Can&#39;t wait to take a ride on that thing&quot;, she said pointing at his dangling flaccid cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that won&#39;t happen...&quot; James said immediately. Confused and insulted looking Melissa shot him a glare. He responded quickly. &quot;I meant it can&#39;t! A human vagina can&#39;t fit a horse cock.&quot; She regarded him for a moment, face cracking into a grin. He was glad she didn&#39;t press how he knew that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Well we have other ways an means then!&quot; She grinned as she took some steps back, sitting on Jess bed, then leaning back and parting her legs. She first patted her puffy lips, &quot;Come here boy!&quot; she teased, then opened them, revealing the pink insides.<br />
<br />
James grimaced, glad that Melissa wasn&#39;t looking. It just didn&#39;t look appealing all of a sudden. Not repulsive or anything, just boring, non-appetising. God he wished he was back with Dakota.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you waiting for. Fucking come and eat your girlfriend out!&quot; Melissa exclaimed as James hopped-to. <br />
<br />
Kneeling betwee her leg he was close enough now to smell her. Familiar, yet, somehow different. No longer enticing. Maybe... Maybe she had said horse or donkey first. That, at least, would be worth finding out, James thought.<br />
<br />
Wanting to just find out, he leaned in and began licking with prefunctory efficiency. Melissa squealed in delight almost immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck! James, fuck! that feels good! So much better than normally.!&quot; Her voice was a little hoarse. Her hands began to dance all over herself. Grabbing James&#39;s hair. Rubbing her tits. Twirling on her belly. Biting her finger.<br />
<br />
Then she bucked, shoving hard into James&#39;s mouth. &quot;Oh fuck. I can feel something.&quot; She reached underneath heself, feeling a growing tube, feeling hair grow on it. Her hands roamed, one finger quickly dipping into her rosebud.<br />
<br />
Feeling something tickling and brushing his dangling tits, James pulled back. His stomach sank; but also part of him was glad. &quot;It&#39;s a dog&#39;s Mel&quot; He said, now done, standing up. The tail was furry and brown, very clearly canine. He wasn&#39;t a dog. He was an equine. He needed a stud, or a Jack. Melissa writhed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t stop now!&quot; She hissed, hands shooting down as she began roughly mashing her clit. It didn&#39;t take long for her abs to begin quiverring and her eyes to roll back. She hissed a string of expletives, then finally unclenched with a massive ragged sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck me that was good!&quot; She laughed, then turned on her stomach, bubble but now sporting a new friend in a wagging chocolate brown tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dog Eh!?&quot; She said, &quot;Dogs are cool!&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as cool as donkeys.&quot; James muttered under his breath.</p>
