<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ding-dong. The doorbell rang, shattering the sleepy silence of the mostly empty house.<br />
<br />
Ding-dong ding-dong. Jay, a scrawny seventeen year old, peaked his head from the covers of his bed, groggily rubbing his eyes and donning his glasses before peering at the clock on his nightstand. 9:00pm. Did he really sleep through the whole day? Maybe if he just pretended he wasn’t there… maybe they would go awa-<br />
<br />
Ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong ding-dong.<br />
<br />
“Alright, alright!” He wailed through the cacophony of door chimes, ever so carefully slipping on a pair of gym shorts; careful not to disturb his “new addition”.<br />
<br />
As that infernal door bell kept ringing, Jay stumbled through the hallway and down the stairs, hollering at the stranger on the other side of the front door. “Cool it with the door bell! What do you want?”<br />
<br />
“…Delivery.” answered a gruff female voice after a brief pause, “You got ten seconds or I’m keepin’ it for myself.”<br />
<br />
“Shut up, Kat!” Jay teased his best friend, instantly recognizing her lackadaisical tone, “I knew I smelled Burger Barn and weed. Look, if you got my make-up homework, leave that at the door. If you brought food, you keep it. I’m not allowed to eat that stuff right now…”&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
A longer pause left the house completely silent for a few seconds. “No.”<br />
<br />
“Kat!? What do you mean ‘no’?”<br />
<br />
“Come on, you’ve been out of school the whole week. People have been talking. Juicy rumors.” Kat paused for a second before hearing her blurt out, “I want to see it!”<br />
<br />
Jay shook his head. “No way! What if you got sick too and-“<br />
<br />
“Come on, it’s not everyday someone gets the a case of the dreaded donkey pox.” Kat giggled, “Let me see it or I’m doing your homework myself.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, okay! Fine.” Jay conceded, swinging the door open and letting her inside. It was Kat alright, sporting her Burger Barn employee visor like she just came off her shift. She was a lesbian, a Wiccan, and the only girl he knew who actually pulled off the “disheveled” look as a style. She had a voluptuous build to put it kindly, crafted from too many leftovers from the Burger Barn night shifts. Gangly black hair covered up the side of her face, the girl managing to sport a perpetually smug grin; smug, but still warm.<br />
<br />
“Hey, what gives?” Kat feigned an annoyed tone, “I thought you’d be a talking donkey or something.”&#8232;<br />
<br />
“What? No!” Jay scoffed, “It never ever gets that bad.” Jay took a few steps away from his friend, putting a good meter between him and her for safety. The teen then bent over, tugging down his shorts.<br />
<br />
“Agh! Hey man!” Kat giggled, “Whatcha mooning me… for…?” Hey eyes open wide, the girl grinning as she sees a ropey donkey tail wrestle its way out of the thin cloth. The appendage was distinctly equine, yet seamlessly connected with Jay’s human bottom.<br />
<br />
“There, happy now? No flash photography. Now if you don’t mind could you just- AGH! HEY! FUCK!”<br />
<br />
Kat covered the distance meant to prevent infection, grabbing onto his spindly donkey tail and tugging. Jay never felt anything like it, the yank completely knocking the wind from him causing him to teeter of balance. Kat managed to break his fall and Jay instantly wrested away his tail away from her, the teen hopping away to a safe distance again as if he’d just stubbed his toe.<br />
<br />
“That! What was that for!?” Jay scowled at Kat, pulling up his gym shorts and tucking his tail back inside.<br />
<br />
“Dang. It’s real.” Kat circled around Jay, trying to get another eyeful of his changes.<br />
<br />
“What? Why would I fake it? Why would I miss a week of school and prom just to play donkey dress up?”<br />
<br />
“I dunno. Cold feet?” Kat smirked, “You never seemed the type to date so I never expected to take a girl to prom. I thought you never even kissed a girl who wasn’t your mom. I had a theory you and Jessica-“<br />
<br />
“No, I’ve made out with a ton of girls!” Jay corrected her. “Close contact, kissing, and… the rest. That all spreads it. I don’t want her to end the night with a tail too.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, alright. I’m not here to play inquisition.” Kat waved off that line of questioning. “I just thought the whole turning into a donkey thing would be… more dramatic. I mean… are you like… getting better?”<br />
<br />
“That’s what I was trying to explain!” Jay said as he planted his rear against the hallway wall so she couldn’t snare it again. “Touching it. Eating and drinking too much. That’s what makes it get worse. To get better you need to starve it. Both of food and attention.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Kat leaned stared at Jay’s butt pensively. “And… what if you don’t try to stop it. What if you just let it go?”<br />
<br />
“Well… I don’t know how far it goes the changes can go. At my worst, my legs were just a bit digitigrade and I had a bunch of fur on my butt.” Jay peeled himself off the wall, walking around as he kept explaining. “As long as you stop exacerbating it, you can always go back to normal no matter how far it’s progressed. I figured they could just, like duct tape you to a wall or something if they really had to stop you from making it worse. And once it’s gone, you’re immune. It’s gone forever.”<br />
<br />
“So, I guess it’s a one-shot deal…” Kat mumbled under her breath before turning her head upwards, looking her friend straight in the eyes. In a moment, Kat pinned the smaller Jay against the wall, embracing him in a bear hug as her nose rubbed against is. Another pregnant pause of silence filled the air as he felt Kat’s warm breath against his skin. She flashed him her trademark smirk before before gently pecking him on the lips, her drooling tongue gently lapping against his mouth…<br />
<br />
WHAM!<br />
<br />
Jay shoved her away, slamming her against the hallway wall as he leaned against the wall on the other side.<br />
<br />
“KAT! WHAT THE FUCK!?” The teen panted, wiping Kat’s spittle from his mouth. His breath quickened, mind racing as he tried to figure out what his childhood friend was up to. “Are you trying to get sick!? Why would you kiss me!?”<br />
<br />
“Come on, dude…” Kat’s voice cracked, a tinge of uncharacteristic sadness in her voice as she leaned back against the wall, her chin turning upwards as she peered at the dim light illuminating the two. “Ever since high school, we got split up. You taking those advanced placement courses while I’m stuck in the regular ones… You planning to head out-of-state for college while I’m working at Burger Barn. We hardly hang out anymore as is… but soon… you’re not even gonna be around.”<br />
<br />
“Well… yeah.” Jay admitted, turning his head to the side so he didn’t have to look her in the eyes. “That’s just how things go, I guess. Life goes on… gets more complicated…”<br />
<br />
“Well maybe this donkey pox thing is just mother nature’s way of telling you you need a vacation. Or - we need a vacation.” Kat peeled herself from the wall, slowly walking towards her friend, “Aren’t you just a little curious? About what it’s like to be an animal? Maybe it’s even sorta fun.”<br />
<br />
“You think turning into a donkey would be fun? I’ve spent the past week all alone in -“ Jay let out a hiccup-like gasp, freezing in place as he felt his best friend’s fingers gently work their way under his gym shorts, her hand clutched the underside of his tail as she gently needed the tender bestial flesh on his tail’s fat dock. “S-stop!”<br />
<br />
“Heh, your skin feels really different under your ass noodle.” She smirked, not letting up her rubbing. “It’s thick, soft, and velvety. It feels good to you too, right?”<br />
<br />
Jay felt his tail hoist itself upwards as he stood on tiptoes, his breath coming out in labored huffs. “I’m. Serious… Stop. It. Now.”<br />
<br />
“Please, dude.” Kat let out a begging purr in her sonorous monotone voice. “I brought my Nintendo, some weed, and enough food to last us a week; it&#39;ll be our own personal Pleasure Island. I know it’s sudden and I know it’s weird, but let’s be weirdos together… just one more time…”<br />
<br />
The chubby girl wrapped her hand around Jay’s tail, gently tugging from side to side as her thumb teased at Jay’s butt hole, the his ring of anal flesh feeling oddly squishy - oddly swollen. “If you end up hating it. I’ll personally duct tape you to the wall until you’re completely changed back. I promise.”<br />
<br />
Jay managed to gasp out a little chuckle at her joke, but inside he was struggling and writhing with uncertainty. Changing into a donkey. Did she realize what she was getting them into?<br />
<br />
Despite all this, the teen got a nagging feeling that Kat needed this weekend more than him. He hadn’t really talked to her recently… maybe things weren’t going too well for her. Maybe she had a reason for wanting this.<br />
<br />
Risks be damned. He could try it. She needed a break and he could give it to her. “Alright… but only if I can yank your tail. I gotta get you back, ya know?”<br />
<br />
Kat let out a giddy snort, as Jay tugged her into the living room. Kat pushed him onto the couch and climbed on top of him before wrapping him in her arms once again.<br />
<br />
“You lied about kissing girls, didn’t you? That last kiss was just so weak.” Kat giggled, rubbing her nose against Jay’s again as she breathed heavily against his face, “Since I’m so nice, I’ll let you practice on me. Practice until I have a tail too, okay?”</p>
