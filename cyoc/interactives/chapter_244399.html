<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You&#39;ve changed. And I don&#39;t mean for the better,&quot; Lucy stated as she stared across the patio table at Madison. &quot;When I came to you, figuring you might be the one person who could help me, and learned you were going through the same thing I was, I thought you and I, we could work out why this was happening to us. But, now, ever since we started school as a couple of girls, and, if what you say is accurate, you&#39;ve made the rest of the transition to being female, now it seems as if you don&#39;t want to go back to being who you&#39;re supposed to be, back to being Jon.&quot;<br />
<br />
From what she sat, Madison mulled over everything the other girl was saying. Wondering, &quot;Have I changed? Beyond turning fully into a girl?&quot; she went back over the last two months of school, the way she&#39;d started to identify and see herself as a girl after she&#39;d masturbated in the bathroom at the local clinic, the final transformation her body had gone through, of which she&#39;d only told Lucy so far, and even the way her body had become insistent it was female, as sometime in October she&#39;d experienced her fist vaginal discharge, and three weeks afterward, she&#39;d started spotting, needing feminine hygiene products for between her legs. Going back over all of this, and any number of things, such as how she&#39;d finally gotten over what the other girls called her shyness and started undressing around them in the locker room, she decided Lucy was right, she had changed, and not in just one way.<br />
<br />
With a glance over at the other, she shrugged and replied, &quot;You&#39;re right, I have,&quot; and before the other could say anything, she said, &quot;When this whole thing started happening, I wanted one and only one thing, to go back to being who I was, Jon Fellps. But since becoming Madison McKenna, experiencing life as a girl, seeing everything from that perspective, I realised and come to accept what a lot of people were telling me before about the way I behaved. I actually have come to appreciate what I see as I have been given.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s it? You&#39;re giving up?&quot; Lucy countered.<br />
<br />
A shake of her head, and Madison answered, &quot;I am not giving up. Rather, I have come to accept I can no longer be Jon, and so, this is who I am, Madison McKenna. Hell. I do not even know if I could ever be Jon again. And, if I was given the chance, I can honestly say I do not know if I would take it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silence greeted this, and after a minute or so, Lucy stood. Starting away from the table, she stopped, walked back, leaned forward and placed her hands on the tabletop. As she did this, she stated, &quot;You know, I should have expected this. You really haven&#39;t done anything to figure out how to change us back, since the start of the school term you&#39;ve all but ditched me, so, yeah, I should have expected you to do this,&quot; and straightening up, Lucy exclaimed, &quot;I don&#39;t even really know why I turned to you for help. The moment I caught you wearing, what was it, a bathing suit and denim shortalls, it should have clued me in you never really wanted to be a guy,&quot; before turning away and storming across the backyard, out through the gate, and into the alleyway.<br />
<br />
From where she sat, Madison watched her go. There was so much she wanted to tell Lucy, including how she was sorry she felt the way she did, how she&#39;d honestly made an effort to find a way to change them back, as well as how she hoped, if she was telling the truth in what she claimed, the other girl either learned to accept what happened to her, or she did find a way to change back, took from her experience and grew as a person. Thinking about the last thing Lucy had said, Madison wasn&#39;t sure what to make of it, as it&#39;d been her foster father who&#39;d discovered months ago, back in either later May or early June, her dressed as a girl in stuff she borrowed from the attic. Toying with the idea of going after Lucy, making her somehow listen, understand if being a boy was something Lucy wanted, Madison would do whatever she could to help her, but she, Madison, was a girl now.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I have no intention of going back to being a guy, to being this, Jon, person,&quot; she resolved aloud and feeling she&#39;d settled a matter eating at her, she decided, she would tell Mrs Parker, and the next time she saw Dr Ansi, she’d also inform the doctor how she&#39;d transformed down between her legs and what her body was now capable of doing.<br />
<br />
Inside the house, leaning against the counter, Denise overheard everything. Since having used the Chronivac to morph her foster brother into a girl, there seemed to have been one surprise after another. She&#39;d altered Jon&#39;s taste in clothes, and it&#39;d gone beyond what she expected, as the boy-turned-girl had started wearing girl&#39;s things. She made Billy undergo a slow change into the girl who&#39;d just left, and in the process, it&#39;d erased the previous friendship between Jon and Billy, something Denise had thought was permanent, until Billy, now Lucy, had come to Jon, now Madison, for help. And to top all of this off, hearing what she&#39;d just heard, it sounded like Madison had learned what she, Denise, and her mom and so many others had tried to teach Madison when she&#39;d still been Jon, and from this, had made the decision she never wanted to go back to being who she was; was happy as who she now was, a girl named Madison. Going over all of this and others things she&#39;d witness, Denise also considered her own plans of how she&#39;d change Jon back after sometime, probably a year, but leave all the stuff he learned in place.<br />
<br />
Now, she was questioning this idea. Deliberating on which might be best, especially as she considered how, when she&#39;d first started to use the programme, she hadn&#39;t known what she was doing and had mucked up on the awareness and who knew about Jon&#39;s change and who didn&#39;t, with it being set so everyone was of aware of how Jon was becoming Madison, she thought she could change her foster sibling back, but no longer believed it was for the best to do so. Pushing away from the counter, Denise paced back and forth for a bit, trying to see the argument from both sides before heading up to her room. Collecting the Chronivac and emitter, having an idea of what to do, she headed back down stairs where she headed for the living room.<br />
<br />
There, she booted up the computer, inserted the disk, plugged in the remote, and pulling up Madison&#39;s profile, she set to work. Altering only minor details, she switched up Madison&#39;s background so she was now Denise&#39;s cousin. Adding in how Madison’s mother was Mrs Parker’s sister, she then laid out how, sometime in January, there had been an accident, and Madison, who was still Jon at the time, had survived and was sent to live with his closest living relatives, the Parkers. Adding information which kept Jon as the same person as he’d been before, just with a different family, slightly tweaked background, she set it so everything she did would be permanent and made sure only she, Denise was aware of the reality shift. <br />
<br />
After she completed this, she then toyed with the idea of making Madison having always been a girl. But after going back and forth over the matter, she decided to leave it so, starting in May, Jon still fully became Madison by the end of October. Satisfied she was making the right choice, she inputted some details to shore up a few holes, including why no one at school questioned why it&#39;d been Jon in the ninth grade, but now was Madison in the tenth, she saved the new information and sent the date to the emitter. Ejecting it, Denise closed the programme, took out the disk, and went to put it away.<br />
<br />
But, halfway up the stairs, she stopped when she heard someone in the hallway. Peeking up over the last couple steps, seeing it was Madison, and she was knocking on the bedroom door of Denise&#39;s parents, Denise set the disk down. Aiming the remote at the fifteen-year-old, she told the device to initiate the change as the door opened. The effect instantaneous, Denise watched it all as, from down the hall, Madison blinked, shook her head as she suddenly felt a pressure building, like someone was squeezing her head, and for a split second, she seemed to be living to different lives. But then, as the door opened and she was greeted by her aunt, who&#39;d adopted her, the moment seemed to pass and all Madison could remember where the new memories of growing up as Jon McKenna until something happened and, for reasons she and other didn’t understand, she had started to turn into a girl. Thinking of why she&#39;d come upstairs to find her aunt, she almost changed her mind, but steeling herself, she said, &quot;Umm, you know how, seeing Dr Ansi, I&#39;m not comfortable with having a full-body physical done? Well, there&#39;s a reason,&quot; and starting slow, unsure how Aunt Sophia would respond, she told it wasn&#39;t merely what the doctor had observed, talked with them about, but rather, somehow, she was now completely a girl and how it had happened a bit ago.<br />
<br />
On the stairs, Denise listened for a bit as Madison talked with her mother about developing a vulva and internal reproductive organs, among other details before tiptoeing back downstairs. Heading for the living room, deciding things would be all right, she turned on the computer, re-inserted the disk, plugged in the emitter, and proceeded to delete every last profile on the piece of software, then the programme itself off the computer. Finished, she ejected the disk and remote, set them to one side, and thinking what to do next, she pulled up the internet, navigated to a search engine, and began running white-pages searches for people she could send the Chronivac to, figuring it was for the best to mail it to someone else.</p>
