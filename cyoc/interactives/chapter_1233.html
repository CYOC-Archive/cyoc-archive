<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wendy paced nervously in her dorm room until she saw that Carla and the two pre-frosh girls were staring at her. Blushing, she sat down uneasily at her computer desk.<BR>
<BR>
The two girls that were staying in their room had settled into the bean bag chairs. The first, Susan, was a raver girl, and had come to the orientation with hair that blended from purple to deep blue, close-cropped. Wendy wasn't about to pretend she understood how the curse worked, but she was nonetheless surprised that when Susan's hair grew out during the tour, it hadn't grown out as her natural hair colour. Instead, the thick mane that had developed was in the same garish hues she had arrived in. Then again, nothing else seemed to make sense that day for Wendy.<BR>
<BR>
The other girl was apparently Susan's friend, as they had both taken a road trip together to visit the college. She hadn't started changing until a few minutes ago when they entered the room, but her safety-cone orange hair had suffered the same fate as Sarah's at that point, long, full, and day-glo. Her name was Penny, and like Susan, she didn't seem to notice or care about her changes.<BR>
<BR>
Wendy watched them furtively as they talked happily. The sun was setting, and they were beginning to experience what the rest of the school had the prior evening. Their eyebrows were already shaggy, and as if out of some sense of thoroughness, were sprouting in the dyed colours. These two would look rather interesting as the night went on, Wendy thought.<BR>
<BR>
Penny caught her looking, and waved with a sharp-nailed hand, smiling toothily. Wendy looked away, turning back to her computer.<BR>
<BR>
She couldn't type, though. Her fingers clashed clumsily against the keys, and as she lifted her hands she was reminded that it was happening to her, as well. Though not quite claws, her nails were already long again, and a rusty growth of downy hairs was already evident on her forearms. The itchiness under her shirt and pants told her that the full change was soon in coming.<BR>
<BR>
"Just like a big slumber party," Carla said, her voice already a little huskier, "right girls?"<BR>
<BR>
Susan and Penny both nodded enthusiastically.<BR>
<BR>
"Then you won't mind if I get a little more...informal..."<BR>
<BR>
Susan shrugged.<BR>
<BR>
"Go for it. Nothing I haven't seen before," Penny said.<BR>
<BR>
"Don't bet on it," Wendy muttered.<BR>
<BR>
"She always this cranky?" Susan asked.<BR>
<BR>
"That time of the month, dear," Carla answered as she stripped off her shirt to reveal her braless chest and the thickening tufts of pale hair on her shoulders and neck.<BR>
<BR>
The two girls gasped, and backed away a little.<BR>
<BR>
"Oh, God," Penny gasped, "That's...that's just not normal!"<BR>
<BR>
"Uhm, girls," Wendy said urgently, trying to deflect their attention, "how about we go for a walk?"<BR>
<BR>
"<B>Sounds good!</B>" the pre-frosh said almost in unison, fear in their voices.<BR>
<BR>
Wendy put on her windbreaker and held the door open as the two frightened girls hurried out.<HR>She managed to get them to Turner Hall without incident. Evidently, almost everyone was in the residence halls, or at least so it seemed from the muffled noises they heard.<BR>
<BR>
It was getting a little hard to think clearly when she guided them into one of the empty rooms. Shutting the door tightly, she barricaded it with some of the renovation materials and slumped against the wall, sighing.<BR>
<BR>
"That's so they can't get in, right?" Penny asked.<BR>
<BR>
"Exactly," Wendy answered, "that and so we can't get out."<BR>
<BR>
"So...we...Oh, God," Penny said in fear, "Susan, it's happening to her too!"<BR>
<BR>
"Calm down, girls. If you get scared now, you won't be able to take what I'm about to tell you."<BR>
<BR>
Susan and Penny collected themselves, still shivering a little.<BR>
<BR>
"Now listen, I'm not the only one in this room you have to worry about becoming a snarling animal."<BR>
<BR>
"What do you mean?"<BR>
<BR>
"Take a look at each other. Take a good, long, look at each other."<BR>
<BR>
They did, for the first time noticing their pointed ears, their shaggy arching eyebrows, their widow's peaks, their fangs.<BR>
<BR>
"Oh," Susan said, "Wow!"<BR>
<BR>
"Raver werewolves," Penny said, "kick ass!"<BR>
<BR>
"We're here," Wendy explained, "because it's easier to hold on to who you are if you're not out in that mob we left. If we stay in control, we probably won't hurt ourselves or anyone else."<BR>
<BR>
"So what do we do now?"<BR>
<BR>
"Strip. As weird as it was when Carla started doing it, we're going to need to if we want our clothes intact when morning comes."<BR>
<BR>
"Woo hoo," Susan said, "it's a slumber party after all!"<BR>
<BR>
Wendy sighed mirthlessly and dispassionately began to disrobe, her back to the girls. As she undressed, she heard their giggles and chatter at the thought of being nude. Turning around, she tried to stifle the vague attraction she felt towards them. They seemed to have no such restraint, though.<BR>
<BR>
"Oh my God, Susan," Penny gushed, "You look so frigging hot!"<BR>
<BR>
Wendy surveyed Susan, seeing the purple and blue pattern continued into the tufts that had sprouted on the girl's face, the ruff about her neck and shoulders, and the dense growth about her nether regions.<BR>
<BR>
"Not so bad yourself, Penny," Susan said.<BR>
<BR>
"Oh, get out! I'm fucking glow in the dark!"<BR>
<BR>
That wasn't that much of an inaccurate assessment, Wendy mused, looking Penny over. Whatever drove the curse, it certainly had an eerie sense of aesthetics. Penny's blaze orange hair had become highlighted with streaks of fluorescent yellow, and her crotch and shoulders looked almost aflame.<BR>
<BR>
Both girls looked tempting to her, and she wasn't sure that if they gave in she'd be able to avoid doing the same. More haunting still was the fact that her thoughts kept returning to Carla. Not even to human Carla, but to the white she-wolf her roommate had become, and would become again tonight.<BR>
<BR>
"So Wendy," Penny said, "what happens if we give in?"<BR>
<BR>
"We have a hell of a good time," Susan said, giggling.<BR>
<BR>
Wendy had to chuckle at that.<BR>
<BR>
"Well, Susan's actually right, from what I saw last night. It would definitely feel good," Wendy said wistfully, "but I'm almost certain we'd regret it in the morning..."</p>
