<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike contemplated the various changes he could make using the book. One idea was to swap the genders, giving men vaginas and women penises, which he thought would be quite an interesting visual. However, as he mulled it over, he realized he didn&#39;t want to lose his own manhood. He couldn&#39;t imagine life without his dick. Despite this, he did wonder what it would feel like to have breasts—large, round ones with perky tits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Show me the pages on secondary sex characteristics,&quot; he commanded. The book responded, revealing a new page with detailed notes highlighting the unique characteristics between estrogen and testosterone.<br />
<br />
Estrogen affects the development of females after puberty and includes:<br />
-Breast Development: Growth of breasts, with the development of mammary glands.<br />
-Hip Widening: Widening of the hips.<br />
-Body Fat Distribution: Increase in body fat, particularly around the hips, thighs, and buttocks.<br />
-Menstrual Cycle: Onset of menstruation, indicating the beginning of reproductive capability.<br />
-Skin Changes: Smoother skin with changes in skin texture and elasticity.<br />
-Voice Changes: Slight deepening of the voice, but not as pronounced.<br />
<br />
Testosterone affects the development of males after puberty and includes:<br />
-Facial and Body Hair: Increased growth of hair on the face, chest, and other parts of the body.<br />
-Voice Changes: The voice becomes deeper due to the enlargement of the larynx and lengthening of the vocal cords.<br />
-Muscle Mass: Increase in muscle mass and strength, with a more pronounced muscular build.<br />
-Bone Structure: Broader shoulders and a more angular jawline.<br />
-Body Odor and Sweat: Increased production of sweat and changes in body odor.<br />
-Adam&#39;s Apple: More prominent due to the growth of the laryngeal prominence.<br />
<br />
Mike took one last look at himself in the bathroom mirror, admiring his scruffy beard and short-cut brown hair. He glanced down at his hairy, muscular arms, snug in his blue t-shirt, and his beefy, hairy legs extending from his black basketball shorts. Hoping the book he borrowed wasn&#39;t a scam, Mike copied the traits of &#39;Estrogen&#39; and replaced the traits of testosterone with some changes. By the end of it, this was the description of Testosterone. <br />
<br />
Breast Development: Growth of breasts, with the development of mammary glands.<br />
-Hip Widening: Widening of the hips.<br />
-Body Fat Distribution: Increase in body fat, particularly around the hips, thighs, and buttocks.<br />
Menstrual Cycle: Onset of menstruation, indicating the beginning of reproductive capability. A male will menstruate approximately every 28-34 days, lasting for 1-4 days. This will coincide with female menstrual cycle. During this time, their penis will remain fully erect and ejaculate sperm-concentrated semen frequently, which has a high chance to cause a pregnancy if ejaculated into a female. This can be controlled with masturbation and sex, or will occur when needed automatically. They will experience rapid mood swings, heightened arousal, and may experience other effects on a person-by-person basis. The ejaculation can sometimes be incredibly painful as well. Semen ejaculated when a male is not menstruating will still contain sperm but it can take hours to orgasm and its incredibly rare for a woman to get pregnant by a male outside there menstrual cycle even if the female is on her menstrual cycle.<br />
Skin Changes: Smoother skin with changes in skin texture and elasticity.<br />
-Voice Changes: Slight deepening of the voice, but not as pronounced.<br />
<br />
In the blink of an eye, everything around him changed. He felt shorter and weaker. A strange woman stared back at him from the mirror—except it wasn’t a woman. As he moved his arm, they moved theirs. As he scratched his head, so did they. It was him, now with long brown hair, a clean-shaven face, and a smooth, cute complexion. He glanced down at his frail, hairless arms, now emerging from a blue, tank top with plenty of cleavage. He looked further down at his white, pedicured toes beyond his slender, hairless legs, which now extended from his navy blue micro shorts with a noticeable bulge. He was a completely transformed person.<br />
<br />
The most noticeable change was on his chest, where two mounds now protruded. He explored them with his hands, appreciating the sensation of them jiggling as he felt around. A mischievous thought crossed his mind, reminding him of the reason he wanted to transform in the first place. He removed his tank top and tossed it onto the sink, now cluttered with bottles of face moisturizer, makeup wipes, and tampons. Ignoring the mess, he attempted to unhook his bra, struggling initially as he had never been adept at removing bras from other women. Now, wearing one himself, the challenge was from an entirely different perspective.<br />
<br />
Eventually, he managed to unhook it. He twirled the bra triumphantly before letting it drop to the floor. Gazing at his plump F-cups in the mirror, he touched them, enjoying the jiggling sensation once more. The experience aroused him, and he felt his member press against the tight-fitting micro shorts.<br />
<br />
Mike pulled down his shorts, revealing his erect dick bulging in the pink g-string he wore, and stepped out of them. He sat on the toilet, rubbing his breasts with one hand and his shaft with the other. He stroked quickly, feeling the sensitivity of his erect nipples. It was a completely new experience for him. As he explored the sensation of his new breasts, he eventually climaxed, ejaculating over himself.<br />
<br />
Mike let out a deep sigh of relief after he blew his load. He took a brief pause before deciding to clean up. Since he was already in the bathroom, he figured he might as well take a shower. He turned on the hot water and stepped in, noticing the different brands of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. In his old life, he had simply used a two-in-one shampoo and a simple bar of soap. After showering, he stepped out and quickly got dressed.<br />
<br />
As Mike regained his clarity, he picked up the book, intending to undo the changes and restore everything to normal. However, his curiosity got the better of him, and he felt compelled to explore how the rest of the world had transformed.<br />
<br />
Opening up his phone, he decided to Google &#39;hot women&#39; and &#39;hot men&#39; onto his phone. After opening up images, at a first glance they mostly looked the same as tgey allblooked like women in the previous world, and all wore similar outfits. However, as he noticed further, notably the crotch, it was clear where the difference lied. <br />
<br />
All the women in the images had very clear cameltoes and outlines of their vaginas. For men, their bulges were easily visible through their clothes. Even just regukar searches of men and women in normal clothes had these traits visible.<br />
<br />
Opening up the book again, Mike read through the pages on hunan sexual characteristics and noticed a little line in if. <br />
<br />
- Due to the sexual monomorphism if humanity, clothes must make it easy to identify the genitalia of the individual while covering up the genitalia. This is typically achieved with very tight clothing around the crotch, of by wearing clothes that don&#39;t hide the individuals underwear. Since wearing nothing but underwear is legally allowed but avoided unless the weather is hot. Even going topless is legal but generally avoided due to discomfort of bouncing breasts.<br />
<br />
Surprised by what he was reading, he once again looked down at his body, before looking outside. The weather was nice and warm so maybe wearing just some underwear would be an interesting experience now. Choosing to wear just his pink g string and a lacy bra, he walked outside to experience some of the new world.</p>
