<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He wasn’t the current youngest of the group, but John was embarrassed he was over three times younger than his previously younger brother Paul. He really wanted to grow older, so as soon as it was his turn, he grabbed the dice, whispered “older” into them for luck, and rolled them.<br />
<br />
“Come on, growth spurt!” John threw the dice and watched as his character moved. Even growing back to his original age would be preferable at this point. Instead, he watched sullenly as his piece moved to a negative age space.<br />
<br />
“Younger? How much younger could I get?” All the boys watched as the black circle revealed a -5.<br />
<br />
Paul grinned in glee. “Yay, John! You get to see what it’s like to be a toddler again!”<br />
<br />
John grimaced as he shrunk down again, his clothes once again changing with him. He looked at himself as he became shorter than ever, his arms and legs getting some baby fat. As he shrank he found himself tearing up. He settled down into the size of a two-year-old, wearing a printed shirt and some tiny cargo shorts.<br />
<br />
“Is that a diaper I see, poking up out of his little pants?” Bob looking closely, seemingly interesting in John’s new shape and age.<br />
<br />
At the mention of wearing a diaper, John’s face turned red as he started crying. “I don’t want to be a baby! I don’t want to be wearing diapees!” His shrill voice caused all the other players to cover their ears.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, brother,” Paul exclaimed. “It’s just a game. If you win, you can decide whichever age you want. Right, Jack?”<br />
<br />
Jack looked at his friends, two brothers that were wildly different ages than when they had started. “That’s right, Paul. I’m glad you’re having so much fun.” Jack sighed in boredom, still the same age as when he had started.<br />
<br />
“Well, I guess it’s my turn,” Paul said. He rolled for his turn, and moved his piece to another positive space. “Wow! How much older could I get?”<br />
<br />
The black circle revealed a conservative +4. Paul watched as his chest got a bit bigger and more refined, and well as hairier on his pecs and stomach. His back started sprouting hairs and so did right above his pants line. Finally, his eyes showed some slight wrinkles, he grew a thicker beard, and the hair on top of his head thinned just slightly.<br />
<br />
When the changes completed, it meant that Paul, formerly the youngest, was now the first one of the group to hit thirty. He stood up to examine himself, feeling the scruff on his face, chest, and arms. He readjusted the sizeable bulged that had formed in his crotch. Though he wouldn’t admit it, all the changes were causing quite a tent in his crotch. Ignoring it, he looked down at his brother.<br />
<br />
“Wow, John!” Paul said, putting his hands on his hips. “I’m certainly old enough to be your dad, huh!”<br />
<br />
Hearing the comment caused John to start in again with the crying, which seemed at this point to be uncontrollable. Paul shook his head and picked his big (little) brother up to hold him in his big, manly arms. John instinctually started to cry into Paul’s shoulder as he was bounced up and down. Paul patted John’s back side to comfort him, discovering a rather thick bum in his brother’s toddler shorts. Curious, Paul pulled the front of his brother’s shorts and diaper out to look inside.<br />
<br />
“Uh-oh,” Paul said with a chuckle. “Looks like this little guy had an accident!”<br />
<br />
John immediately used his little hands to try and stop Paul from looking down his diaper at his now wet crotch. Paul let go and let the diaper and pants elastic snap tight, but John was already embarrassed about the fact that Paul had given him a diaper check. His wailing started all over again as his friends watched on.<br />
<br />
“What a crybaby,” Ellis said. “I didn’t cry that much when I shrunk down to this size.” He grabbed the dice and threw them. “Sooner I go, the sooner little baby John can use his turn to hopefully grow into some big boy pants.”<br />
<br />
Ellis’ roll moved him forward…onto a minus. “¡Déngalo!” Thankfully, the black orb showed only an -1. He shrunk down a bit, and since he had already lost his shirt, his pants changed to little denim shorts, perfect for a preschooler. His voice was noticeably higher when he said, “If one of you were my age, this might actually be fun. Instead you are all adults or older, or younger than me. I wonder if there is a way we can cheat so I can get body hair again.”<br />
<br />
“I understand you’re disappointed, Ellis,” Bob said, reaching for the dice. “If there was a way to switch ages with you, I would. It’s really weird being older than all of you.”<br />
<br />
“Just be glad that your old shirt isn’t twice your size,” Ellis replied.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Bob said. “Here goes nothing!” He threw the dice again, moving his character yet again to a plus square. The circle revealed another +4. “Shucks!”<br />
<br />
The group watched Bob’s bare chest as it grew more defined and hairier, becoming a thick jungle of red-orange hair. The little bit of scruff he had once had grew into a full beard. Even though Bob was easily the most attractive one of the group, he couldn’t help but act like the ten-year-old he had started as. At first, he tried to cover up his new body hair additions, but soon his bulge started to tent out in front of him. Both hands shot down to cover up his embarrassed boner as Bob’s face turned ginger-red.<br />
<br />
“There isn’t any need to be shy,” Jack said. “Some of us would love to be as big and strong as you!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, bud.” Paul said, still holding John in his arms. “If I didn’t have to take care of this little guy, we could go out and have a fun time on the town! I’m sure the other kids in the room would love to be in your position.” He gave his brother John’s padded bum a little pat.<br />
<br />
“Let’s just keep playing before any of our parents get here,” Bob said. “I’d hate to have to explain why we are all different ages.”<br />
<br />
“Speak for yourself,” Jack said, picking up the dice. “I’m the one who bought this game, and I haven’t changed at all!”<br />
<br />
Eager to have some kind of change, Jack rolled the dice again. His promisingly roll caused his figure to move to a positive space.<br />
<br />
“Yes! Finally!” He watched eagerly as the black circle’s mist revealed a +4. “Well, it’s progress!”<br />
<br />
He stood up to watch the changes as he grew a bit older. First he grew taller, fast tracking himself to the beginning of puberty. His clothes became a bit more mature, jeans with a couple holes in the front. He felt a couple of prickles under his arm, and he pulled back the sleeve of his shirt to find three armpit hairs were growing in his right armpit.<br />
<br />
“Guys, look! I’m getting hairier!”<br />
<br />
Paul and Bob looked at each other knowingly, each a million times more scruffy than the now teenaged Jack. Without saying anything, they agreed to not say anything.<br />
<br />
“Things are looking up!” Jack said, showing his acne-full face to the group. “By the time this game ends, I might be as old as Bob and Paul!”<br />
<br />
Ellis, looking up at the now older boy, let out a high-pitched snicker. “Might want to pop a few of those pimples first!”<br />
<br />
The other boys laughed a bit as Jack went over to a mirror to look at his teenage face. Sure, he’d grown older, but he’d only settled into the awkward phase. Still, as he flexed in the mirror, he saw his arms were slightly more muscular. He liked were this was going…as long as he didn’t decrease in age again.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
At the end of this third round, John had gone the lowest of anyone down to a 2 year old, Paul had aged higher than anyone into a 30 year old, Ellis had lost just a year to 5 years old, Bob aged into a virile 25 year old, and Jack had finally hit puberty at 13 years old. No one was anywhere closer to reaching victory and being able to choose their own age, and it looked like they were all in for more changes before his dad came home.</p>
