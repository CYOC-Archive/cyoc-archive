<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Ryan covered his bleeding arm, trying to stop the massive amounts of blood from pouring out of his body while Mike just stood there, still holding onto his crotch, wanting to be free from the confines. The still human side of Mike knew that Ryan wasn't gay and would more than likely not like it very much if he let his cock hang freely, while his newer animal side yearned for him to not listen to his human half. Ryan, still in shock from the attack, realizes that his blood covered forearm and hand were sticking to one another. At first, Ryan thought the blood had simply coagulated and turned scabbish already, but when Ryan removed his hand Ryan saw otherwise.</Br>
<Br>While he expected the lacerations to still be there, just scabbed over, Ryan found that while there was dried blood on his hand and forearm, there were no cuts. Ryan looked over to Mike, not really sure of what was going on, but Mike did because all he could do was chuckle.</Br>
<Br>"God you are funny. A little scratch and you cry like a little girl. Besides, I bet you forgot that if you survive an attack from a werewolf, you gain the infection of lycanthropy... meaning you are like me now. If you get hurt, you heal right away and experience only momentary pain."</Br>
<Br>Ryan smiled with the explanation, forgetting that's how it was with being infected by lycanthropy. "So... what is going to happen now. You were the first one to get this thing before I did, so you must know what I am about to go through."</Br>
<Br>"Yes, I do know what you are going to go through Ryan and it is going to be the best experience of your entire life. Hell... every-time I transform into this form, it is a huge rush... none that we could ever feel as plain and boring human-beings."</Br>
<Br>"Do you think you could enlighten me then?"</Br>
<Br>"Naw, I think it is best for you to experience it all on your own, as it is beyond words to describe how you feel. Yeah, I could tell you what happens physically, but how much fun do you think it would be then for you? You wouldn't look at your new body as you change, the same way you would if you already knew what was going to happen to you."</Br>
<Br>Ryan chuckled softly, but heard the low gruffness come from his larynx just as he heard out of Mike earlier. "Yeah, I guess you are right Mike. Hell, just the sound of my new voice is exciting in itself."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, that is exactly how I felt when it first happened to me!"</Br>
<Br>Suddenly a portion of the change hit him like a ton of bricks. His body's bones started adding thickness and pliability to them, mainly to support the newer weight from bulging muscles Ryan was about to gain right after, as well as being pliable for the changes into the animalistic side like Mike was in at the moment. Ryan could feel the bones lengthen slightly and thicken. As those feelings subsided and Ryan could not feel any bone changes, all the muscles in his body started to spasm, like the twitching of the eye, which Ryan got occasionally when he was overly stressed or nervous. Mounds and mounds of muscle packed itself onto the skinny man Ryan once was. In mere seconds, he went from being a skinny man into a buff strongman type muscle-man. As the changes finally stopped to the point where Ryan could look at himself, he took advantage of the chance, looking his entire body over. What was really funny to him was the fact that he was once wearing clothes that were two sizes too big for him, just because he liked the trendy baggy look. Now his clothes barely fit him, straining to stay together and keep him clothed, with some of the seams all over ripping slightly, revealing an ovalish shaped area of hairless skin. Just as quickly as his bones and muscles changed, his hairiness changed too. Ryan went from being a hairless muscle god to a hairy bear of a man. His knuckles, hands, forearms, and mid-biceps dense brown hair. Ryan could even see the hair poking through the openings of his shirt, along with the holes in the leggings of his shorts. The exposed area of his legs were equally as hairy as his arms were.</Br>
<Br>After the first stages of his transformation had completed, Ryan felt his face, rubbing his meatier hands on his chiseled jaw and scruff covered face, smiling. Mike smiled a wolfen smile, seeing Ryan's teeth through the openings of his lips.</Br>
<Br>"Hey there buddy... how are you feeling?"</Br>
<Br>"I am feeling awesome Mike! I am honestly glad you scratched me, because before this I was a weakling of a man and now I am a REAL man!"</Br>
<Br>"You are definitely welcome bud. Just know though, your next set of changes are about to happen."</Br>
<Br>"What... I am already going to change into a beast like you?"</Br>
<Br>"I think so... you should check out your teeth real quick. The one thing that I remember from my first change was my teeth were grew longer and sharper, slightly into fangs. The other change was my cock was slightly bigger in both length and thickness. If both have happened, then you are ready for your second phase."</Br>
<Br>Ryan scratched at the stubble underneath his chin, getting used to the new feeling of the facial hair where there had been none previously. Ryan ran his tongue over his teeth, feeling that there were indeed longer and sharper than he could ever remember them being. Ryan made a mental check in his head, then looked down while pulling his pants away from his crotch. Looking down, he couldn't really tell, so he reached in and felt himself up. He could feel his cockhead was slightly thicker even in it's flaccid state, not to mention his shaft was slightly less wide than the head, but both were noticeably larger. Not even realizing what he was doing, Ryan played with his new and improved toy, enjoying the fact that Mike was right there and could watch what he was doing. Ryan even stared at Mike's crotch, seeing the bulge press against the fabric. He wanted it out, not just to look at but to play with and do more if he wanted.</Br>
<Br>"So Ryan, do you like looking at my bulging crotch?" He said with a slyness to his gruff voice.</Br>
<Br>Ryan just moaned in a sexual euphoric hunger, wanting to touch the meat and do what he wanted more than anything. Mike's eyes just remained widened, knowing that Ryan was never gay before this, but maybe, just maybe he spread more than his lycanthropy. Mike realized then that his gift was to spread homosexual lycanthropy to other men and now, Ryan is going to be another person to spread their gift.</Br></p>
