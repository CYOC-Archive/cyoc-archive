<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
The knots in Nolan&#39;s stomach tightened and twisted with guilt, he knew what he had done was wrong. <br />
At least in Nicole&#39;s case, she&#39;d been the first friendly person he&#39;d encountered here in the city. He knew <br />
he had to make it right, not just undo the damage but he felt he owed it to Nicole to tell her the truth <br />
and repay her. Surly there was something he could do with the watch.<br />
His thoughts ran wild as he tried to think of what to say to her, but nothing he could say would make <br />
this better. &quot;Best to play it by ear and let the truth do the work&quot; he thought to himself. He drew his <br />
courage and knocked on the door lightly &quot;Nicole?&quot; he asked not wanting to startle her, but was returned <br />
with silence &quot;Nicole?&quot; he asked again. No reply.<br />
He slowly opened the door and entered. Nicole was still lying against the wall playing with herself, a <br />
deep red blush across her face as milk continued to flow down her body onto the floor. Nolan slowly <br />
approached her, dumbstruck and mesmerized at the same time &quot;Nicole? I&#39;m, I&#39;m really sorry... I didn&#39;t <br />
mean to... no that&#39;s not it, um...&quot;<br />
Nicole finally turned her gaze in Nolan&#39;s direction still fondling her breasts &quot;Nolan... you have... to help&quot; <br />
she panted taking in shallow breaths<br />
&quot;I am Nicole, I can fix this! It&#39;s, it&#39;s my fault this happened...&quot; he began to fiddle with the watch<br />
&quot;Nolan... I can&#39;t take it... anymore... you...&quot; Nicole began<br />
&quot;trust me, I&#39;m helping right now just give me a little longer&quot; Nolan interrupted trying to find the restore <br />
function on the watch again.<br />
&quot;have to... milk me!&quot; Nicole continued &quot;I can&#39;t keep up! The pressure is too much&quot;<br />
<br />
Nolan stopped working the watch, shocked by Nicole&#39;s response to the situation. He didn&#39;t remember <br />
adding a personality changes in the edit. Though Nolan had only met her a day ago he never would have <br />
pictured her to behave this way, it seemed totally out of character. Noal looked back to her, she was still <br />
milking herself, the puddle of fluids now stretching across the room to the floor drain. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please Nolan! Help me, I&#39;m begging you!&quot; she pleaded. Clearly the pressure was enough to compromise <br />
anyone&#39;s composure. Noal clenched his fist, he&#39;d came in to confront Nicole to apologize, set things <br />
right, but now he was being put in a position to make things worse. Then again this is what he&#39;d wanted <br />
in the first place. Was it really so wrong to take what he wanted now that he had the watch to get away <br />
with it?<br />
<br />
Nicole shot him a look, her blush face and pleading eyes pounded on him like a hammer! &quot;fuck it!&quot; he <br />
said, throwing off his coat he rolled up his sleeves. He walked to Nicole, placing a hand on her shoulder <br />
as he moved himself behind her on the floor. He pulled her closer and ran his hands over her stomach <br />
and up her chest.<br />
<br />
Cupping her breasts he began to softly tease her nipples, small beads of milk beginning to drip from <br />
them. She arched her head back taken by the sensation, the act of milking now more of a pleasure <br />
rather than a necessity. Nolan only embraced this, he leaned in and began to kiss Nicole&#39;s neck softly. <br />
She began to take deeper breaths and a soft Mooo escape between breaths. Her ears flickered at <br />
the act, creating a soft breeze of air on the back of Noals neck, and occasionally brushing his hair.<br />
<br />
He repositioned his hands around her teats and began to pull gently, pinching with his fingers. A jet of <br />
milk shot out with surprisingly more force than expected, easily clearing the couple and splashing onto <br />
the ground. He began to form a rhythm of the action and Nicole&#39;s breathing became heavier as she slid <br />
her hands onto Nolan&#39;s thighs and griped tightly.<br />
<br />
He continued to work her breasts in his hands as the streams of milk slowly began to lose their pressure, <br />
now spilling onto Nicole&#39;s stomach. She reached up and grabbed Nolan&#39;s wrists to stop him. &quot;I think <br />
were done her&quot; she said in a sensual voice, still catching her breath &quot;now let&#39;s move on to the next part&quot; <br />
she guided his hands down her body, across her thighs and onto her newly formed udder. Nolan could <br />
almost feel a pulse from the pressure building.  <br />
  <br />
He griped the udder teats in both hands and began the motion again, streams of milk jetting out as it did <br />
before. Nicole began to moan louder with each pull on her teats, her grip tightened around Noal&#39;s arms <br />
as she was rocked by the pleasure the new sensitive organ brought her.<br />
<br />
Pain built in Nolan&#39;s hands as his wrists and knuckles began to cramp, the action becoming strenuous <br />
on his joints. &quot;No&quot; Nicole pleaded &quot;you can&#39;t stop now! It still hurts!&quot; as Nolan placed his hands at her <br />
sides to rest. &quot;I know. Give me a moment, I think I have an idea&quot; he turned the watch over and targeted <br />
what looked to be an out of service cappuccino machine. Applied the appropriate changes and hit the <br />
apply icon<br />
<br />
The metal machine began to twist and reshape, gears shifted into position, pumps and tubes came <br />
forward from within the frame work. From its base a rubber tube formed and elongated onto the floor. <br />
It crept its way along the ground to Nicole like a snake before it split into four smaller hoses, glass cones <br />
spawning from their ends like a blooming flower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that... what I think it is?&quot; Nicole asked in surprise. Seeing the device form in front of her eyes left <br />
many questions but did nothing to remove her growing discomfort building in her udder. &quot;yep, it&#39;s a <br />
milker. Think you&#39;re ready for it?&quot; Nolan asked. Nicole bit her bottom lip and nodded her head softly.<br />
<br />
Noal took each pump and placed them around her teats, the machine clicked on with a gentle hum and <br />
the vacuum sucked the bulbs into place. Each pumping in sync causing streams of milk to fill the bulb <br />
before being drained into the hose and repeating. Nicole bit her lip harder and tossed her head. The <br />
sensation literally rocking her body as the fill gauge on milker began to reach its 25% mark.<br />
<br />
Nolan took her hands by the wrist and held them at her sides as her legs and body squirmed. Her hooves <br />
clacking and scratching against the tile floor and her tail flickered franticly between his legs as <br />
the gauge reached the 50% mark.<br />
<br />
The machine&#39;s hum picked up becoming audible on the other side of the room. This was matched by an <br />
increase of suction, Nicole&#39;s teats swelled inside the bulbs releasing milk at an alarming rate. She began <br />
to thrash in Nolan&#39;s arms. She moaned loudly as the gauge flew past the 75% mark.<br />
<br />
The machine began to rumble, as its suction seemed to double. Nolan struggled to hold her still when <br />
her moans became cries of pleasure. Nicole kicked franticly as the sensation throwing her body into a <br />
wild buck. The gauge peaked at 100% when Nicole arched her back off of Nolan crying out a passionate <br />
MOOOOOOOO before collapsing back onto Nolan.<br />
<br />
She laid limp in his arms with her eyes closed, her body exhausted from the experience. Nolan wrapped <br />
his arms around her warm body, her soft coat of fur tickled his arms as he pulled her closer against <br />
himself. He could feel her heart racing away trying to keep pace with her lungs as body tried to recover. <br />
After a few minutes she seemed to have calmed down when her head slowly rolled to rest on his cheek.<br />
Her eyes slowly fluttered open, looking down Nolan gave a gentle smile as their eyes met.<br />
<br />
The next thing Nolan felt was a burning sting across his cheek. In an instant Nicole had drew her hand <br />
back and slapped him across his face with enough force to throw him onto the ground out from <br />
underneath her. As Noal lay on the floor in pain clasping his hands over his cheek, Nicole had darted to <br />
the other side of the room. She&#39;d quickly grabbed a garbage bag from one of the shelves and used it to <br />
cover herself before ducking behind a shelf to hide.<br />
<br />
Nolan worked his way back up on his feet, still rubbing his cheek, a red three digit handprint blazing <br />
across his face. &quot;You said this was your fault! What were you after! Why would you do this to <br />
someone?&quot; Nicole yelled out from behind the shelf <br />
&quot;yes, it&#39;s my fault. But first do you feel better now?&quot; Nolan replied still rubbing his cheek.<br />
<br />
Nicole gripped her breast and then padded her udder with her hand. The pressure was gone and they <br />
felt much lighter and natural, like it&#39;d always been that way. &quot;yeah I feel better&quot; she blushed <br />
remembering how that came about &quot;WAIT! Was that what you were after? To play with me! That&#39;s <br />
SICK&quot;<br />
&quot;yes, it is. WAIT! Not what I was after! That it was sick!&quot; Nolan grunted &quot;I&#39;m going to stop talking now for <br />
a bit&quot; <br />
<br />
It was silent in the room for a long time before Nolan started again. &quot;ok maybe I can explain better if I <br />
help you first&quot;<br />
&quot;oh?&quot; Nicole began &quot;how the fuck are you going to help this!&quot; she stuck her face out from behind the <br />
shelf and pointed to her cow muzzle as her ears flickered about her head.<br />
&quot;with this&quot; Nolan motioned to the watch on his wrist &quot;it can control reality, it&#39;s how I changed you <br />
into...&quot;<br />
&quot;A COW!&quot; Nicole shouted <br />
&quot;yes, A&#39;hem a cow&quot; <br />
&quot;well, hurry up and fix it!&quot; she shouted to Nolan<br />
&quot;okok!&quot; he was silent for a moment &quot;wait just like that? You believe me about a watch that controls the <br />
universe?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nolan&quot; she said annoyed &quot; in the last 10 to 15 minutes I&#39;ve been turned into a cow human hybrid and <br />
milked to the point of orgasm, that should be imposable. A god watch is the only thing that makes sense <br />
out of all this. NOW FIX IT!&quot; as she motioned to her body still holding the bag up.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not all that&#39;s happened&quot; Nolan thought to himself<br />
<br />
Nolan nodded and fiddled with the watch, quickly finding the restore option for Nicole. Goose bumps <br />
ran down her body making every hair of her fur stand on end. The first thing she noticed was her udder. <br />
It began to deflate like a balloon and withdraw back into her skin, her breasts and nipples also returned <br />
to normal losing their pressure from being filled with milk.<br />
<br />
She brought her hand to her face to watch as her fingers split back into 5 digits, a cool sensation running <br />
through them. A similar feeling ran across her feet as her hooves began to extend forward and branch <br />
out back into toes as her heel returned shifting her balance back to normal. <br />
<br />
A tickle ran up her body starting at her feet, the hairs that made up her fur coat started to sink into her <br />
skin. This continued up her body as like a snow drift the fur was replaced with slightly tanned skin. She <br />
whipped around to the window of the refrigerator just in time to see her face begin to return to normal. <br />
In one fluid shift her muzzle shrank back into her face and ears withdrew back behind her hair. Finally <br />
she felt a pinch in her back as her tail rolled back into her spine    <br />
<br />
She looked herself over once again. Seeing that body was fully back to normal she let out a sigh of relief.<br />
She then shot a deadly glance back to Nolan, A&#39;hem she cleared her throat and ruffled the garbage <br />
bag. Hinting that she was still naked. Nolan panicked and quickly fumbled through the watch for the <br />
appearance option. He quickly formed an outfit for her and tapped apply<br />
<br />
A gust of wind brushed over Nicole as fabric materialized from thin air around her. She dropped the <br />
garbage bag shielding her  to reveal  that she now wore a sunburst orange tank top, white hip-hugging <br />
capris with black sandals. Nicole looked it over nodding in approval. &quot;Ok&quot; she stated &quot;I&#39;m a little <br />
impressed with this&quot; Nolan shrugged his shoulders &quot;I had a fashion course in collage, I thought It&#39;d <br />
complement your hair&quot;<br />
<br />
It was silent between the two of them for a moment when the knots began to form in Nolan&#39;s stomach <br />
again. &quot;Nicole...&quot; he began &quot;I&#39;m really sorry for what I did to you, I guess the power went to my head, I <br />
wa&#39;na make it up to you, I won&#39;t feel right until I do. This knot in my stomach just keeps twisting tighter <br />
and tighter. Whatever it is I promise ill make it up to you! &quot;<br />
Nicole crossed her arms. Still very upset with Nolan, but something seemed genuine about his apology. <br />
And  the experience did have its... moments... and the watch did provide her with an array of options.</p>
