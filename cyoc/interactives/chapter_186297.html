<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rounding the corner Bryan nearly walked right into another keeper, Brad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, watch it,&quot; Brad snapped, as though he hadn&#39;t also been ignoring where he was going, &quot;Look at that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad looked past Bryan to where Danni was happily scratching behind Sukari&#39;s ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;He really likes her,&quot; Bryan commented, not sure of what else he should say. To everyone else Sukari wandering around might have been perfectly normal, but he was still trying to figure out how he was supposed to respond without it seeming strange.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Brad sounded more frustrated than ever, or maybe jealous, &quot;She&#39;s so lucky that she gets to spend time with her favorite animals like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was jealous! Bryan tried not to laugh at how bothered Brad was that Danni was the one spending time with Sukari.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure she and Sukari wouldn&#39;t mind if you joined them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad looked at him like he was crazy, &quot;Why would I want to spend time with a hyena? Don&#39;t get me wrong, they&#39;re great animals and all, but could you imagine how much better things would be if we could let Orion and Ajax out like that? The guests would love that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad was referring to the zoo&#39;s two wolves, a pair of brothers from the same litter. They were popular with guests and when they were out and about a crowd usually gathered  to watch them. Ajax a rather large, traditional looking timber wolf and Orion with his thick black coat and striking white markings on his chest and belly were very attention getting. <br />
<br />
Ever since the two wolves had come to the zoo Brad had been interested in them, working with them to get them acclimated to their new home and they responded well to his training. For wolves they were smart, helped by Brad being a very patient trainer.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the wolves were the only ones that Brad was patient with. His having seniority meant that he tended to be very pushy with the other keepers, possibly because he was gunning for a management position if one opened up any time soon. Bryan had been around long enough to know that Brad had big plans for the zoo and its future. His interest in conservation and outreach programs meant that he was nothing but beneficial for the zoo as a whole, but that didn&#39;t make him any less difficult to work with. Especially where the wolves were concerned, they were a special project of his.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean hyenas need to get out and roam for sure,&quot; Brad continued, &quot;But so do wolves. Thirty miles a day in the wild.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was one of his pet causes, that their wolves needed a larger enclosure, as though the enrichment they got in terms of new foods and scents as well as puzzle feeders and objects for them to play with wasn&#39;t enough. There was more to Brad&#39;s desire for a larger habitat for Ajax and Orion though, something that anyone who&#39;d worked at the zoo for any amount of time knew, Brad wanted their pack to be larger. Specifically he was trying to get a female in the hopes of getting involved in a breeding  project.<br />
<br />
There were times when it felt like Brad&#39;s interest in wolves was closer to an obsession, especially given the amount of time he put into working with them and how hard he tried to convince everyone that they were the best animals ever and that more of the zoo&#39;s limited funds needed to be set aside for them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t think they&#39;re bored, do you?&quot; Bryan asked. Making sure all the animals were happy was a top priority for all of the keepers and if the needed anything Brad would be the one to know.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Brad said, his expression growing wistful, &quot;Though I do think they&#39;d be better off with a proper pack. Wolves are social, more so than hyenas and they&#39;d be better off with other wolves around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan wasn&#39;t sure how true any of that was, but it did give him an idea. If Brad wanted a bigger wolf pack and to spend more time with Ajax and Orion he was going to get both.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Unaware that his day was about to take a very unexpected turn Brad went about his daily routine. Normally keepers rotated what animals they worked with, which he did often enough to keep his supervisors happy, but when he could he made sure that he was the one who spent the most time with Ajax and Orion, especially once guests arrived so that he could answer their questions and really get them engaged and interested in the wolves. He knew that, like most large predators, wolves had a bad reputation and that it was only by educating the public would it be possible to help people get over their misconceptions and understand why it was so important to preserve their habitat and support programs to help reintroduce them into their historic range.<br />
<br />
That was his goal and reason for becoming a zoo keeper, to help with wolf conservation efforts and maybe, eventually if he was lucky, help with one of the programs working to return wolves to the wild. It would be a long shot for any of Ajax or Orion&#39;s hypothetical children to roam free in the wilderness, but it was something he could dream about.<br />
<br />
As soon as they saw him approaching their enclosure the wolves recognized him. Ajax stood there, tail held high as he tilted back his head to howl while Orion&#39;s tail swept back and forth in a slow wag. He held no illusions about the two wolves, fully grown males, being anywhere as friendly as their dog descendants, but there were times when he wished that he could spend time in their enclosure, working with them hands on. It was an open secret that they hyenas loved being petted and having their backs scratched through the mesh of the fence, and though he should have reported it or reprimanded those he caught in the act, he didn&#39;t, because there were times where he would carefully press his hands against the fence of the wold enclosure to let Ajax and Orion sniff and lick them.<br />
<br />
Both wolves seemed especially attentive today, right up against the fence, sniffing interested as he drew nearer. It would still be a few minutes before the zoo opened so there was time to greet them.<br />
<br />
Looking around to make sure no one was watching Brad put his hands against the chain link fence.<br />
<br />
Both wolves sniffed eagerly, tails wagging with excitement.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d never seen them so excited to see him, their enthusiasm bringing a smile to his face.<br />
<br />
Ajax&#39;s wide, pink tongue flicked out and curled around his fingers while Orion&#39;s wet nose pressed against his palm.<br />
<br />
The feeling sent a shiver down his spine as it always did, to be so close and feel such a connection to the animals. A strange warmth igniting in his stomach at the thought of the bond he shared with him, accompanied by longing to be even closer, to feel their thick fur against them,the heat of their breath.<br />
<br />
Orion whimpered softly and Brad felt a whine welling up in his throat. When there was no one else around he&#39;d make wolf noises back at them, but this was the first time he&#39;d done so without intending to.<br />
<br />
A wave of vertigo passed over him and Brad leaned against the fence for balance.<br />
<br />
The wolves looked at him, yellow eyes bright and full of intense interest.<br />
<br />
Looking at them left him feeling hot and flustered, the warmth from earlier surging down to his crotch.<br />
<br />
He wanted something, but he couldn&#39;t put his finger on it.<br />
<br />
Ajax sniffed and stuck his nose through the fence, tongue reaching out to brush against Brad&#39;s pants.<br />
<br />
Brad shuddered, not at all surprised that his cock was rock hard and that the touch through the fabric of his pants made it throb. Like an itch in the back of his brain desire grew within him, one he couldn&#39;t place or even imagine how to satisfy.<br />
<br />
It had something to do with the wolves, but what?<br />
<br />
He whined again, wishing for an answer.<br />
<br />
Another wave of vertigo and he fell to his hands and knees.<br />
<br />
Looking up he locked eyes with Orion.<br />
<br />
There was nothing in between them.<br />
<br />
Turning his head to look over his shoulder he saw the fence behind him.<br />
<br />
Somehow he was in the wolf enclosure.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t afraid, far from it. Ajax and Orion were well fed and knew him. There was no reason for them to attack him. Right now they were acting more playful than anything, circling and sniffing excitedly.<br />
<br />
Ajax leapt behind him, playful as a puppy, to sniff excitedly, nose poking and nudging between his legs, against his thighs and tingling balls. He could feel them tightening like he was about to come, as warmth continued to emanate from his stomach.<br />
<br />
Growling quietly Orion went behind him and shoved Ajax out of the way to pull at the waist of Brad&#39;s pants.<br />
<br />
Teeth grazed his skin as the wolf grabbed his belt and pulled, nearly jerking Brad to the ground.<br />
<br />
He could feel the wolf&#39;s frustration at the obstacle between him and what he wanted.<br />
<br />
Hands shaking as the wolf dragged him backwards, farther into the enclosure, Brad fumbled with his belt buckle so that he might free himself. Hazy as his thoughts were, he knew that he had to get out.<br />
<br />
Ajax managed to get in on the effort as well, pulling him to the ground and towards the lean-to that acted as a sort of den in the enclosure.<br />
<br />
Brad had a moment to think that the grass and brush around it looked more overgrown than it should, hiding more of the den area from sight. They&#39;d need to trim it either later that day or tomorrow morning when the wolves were resting, secured in the fully enclosed area at the back of the habitat, safely out of the way. That thought was jolted from his mind when Orion growled angrily and shook his head. Fabric tore as Brad fell face first to the ground.<br />
<br />
He let out a little whimper and the two wolves immediately backed off, tails held low as they looked at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; he panted, as though the wolves would understand the reassurance, &quot;I just need...&quot;<br />
<br />
His cock throbbed and his balls tingled, drawing up higher and higher, pressing almost painfully into his crotch.<br />
<br />
Never before in his life had he felt so incredibly horny. He was barely able to concentrate enough to unbuckle his belt and pull down his pants, freeing his cock.<br />
<br />
He looked down at it, quivering between his legs, tip bright pink and slick with pre.<br />
<br />
Tail wagging Orion rushed forward, tongue lolling out to wrap around Brad&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
Gasping, he thrust into the wolf&#39;s mouth, rough fur tickling his stomach.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to be left out Ajax huffed softly and nosed at his balls.<br />
<br />
Brad winced at the touch, feeling his balls draw up even further, like they were trying to pull right up into him.<br />
<br />
Ajax clearly liked what he smelled because he kept at it, licking and sniffing, the cold touch of his nose and warm touch of his tongue working in concert as he lapped at Brad&#39;s sack.<br />
<br />
He wanted to pull away, but he was trapped by Orion&#39;s mouth around his cock, fangs scraping against his skin, but never hard enough to break it.<br />
<br />
He knew he should have been afraid, but he wasn&#39;t, desire overriding all logic. Whatever it was that he needed, the wolves could give it to him.<br />
<br />
Another nudge from Ajax and there was a distinct &#39;popping&#39; sensation as Brad felt one of his balls sucked back up into his body. For a fleeting instant the pressure was alleviated, but the relief didn&#39;t last long as his sack tightened around his remaining ball, contracting and squeezing until it too popped up into him.<br />
<br />
Brad let out a sigh, the pressure was finally gone and Ajax&#39;s tongue felt so good lapping at the loose, empty folds of his sack, pressing deeper and deeper into him, reaching places inside him that had never been touched before.<br />
<br />
Orion huffed and pulled back, leaving Brad&#39;s cock throbbing free in the air, so small and pink.<br />
<br />
Ajax let out an excited whine, one that Brad surprised himself by responding to with one of his own. The pressure and discomfort were a distant memory, replaced by a new sensation, a heady need the likes of which he&#39;d never experienced before.<br />
<br />
The two wolves looked at each other over Brad, huffing and panting anxiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down you,&quot; he pleaded, fear starting to creep in. The last thing he needed was to be caught up in the middle of a fight between the two wolves.<br />
<br />
Orion lowered his head and tail, inching forward to resume licking at Brad&#39;s cock, tongue pushing into the wet, parted folds just beyond it.<br />
<br />
Warmth rushed through him, not to his cock, but to something both lower and deeper as that tongue pushed deeper inside him. Gasping, he spread his legs wider, an unspoken invitation, one that Ajax was eager to take him up on.<br />
<br />
Growling, Ajax shoved Orion out of the way and then climbed on top of Brad, the wolf&#39;s paws resting on his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha?&quot; Brad made a small noise of confusion as he felt Ajax&#39;s hot, slick cock pressing against his ass, sliding back and forth as the wolf tried to mount him.<br />
<br />
Wetness flowed between Brad&#39;s legs, slicking his thighs as the wolf&#39;s fumbling caused his cock to brush against sensitive places until, in an indescribable sensation, that cock slid inside him.<br />
<br />
Not up his ass, but some place else, somewhere that felt made for it.<br />
<br />
Brad whined again as he felt his pussy clench down on Ajax&#39;s cock, stimulating the wolf and causing his cock to engorge with blood. He could feel it growing inside him, reaching deeper and deeper with each thrust. At its base a knot began to swell, pressing against the walls of his pussy and causing him to shudder.<br />
<br />
It was so big and his pussy was <i>so</i> tight.<br />
<br />
Brad let out a shrill whine as the Ajax&#39;s knot, too big to get back out of him, bounced against the entrance of his pussy from the inside with each thrust. The pressure of it inside him was so great that it was almost painful, but at the same time something about it made him press back against the wolf, grinding the knot in an attempt to pull Ajax&#39;s cock deeper into him.<br />
<br />
Ajax&#39;s claws caught against his shirt, tearing the fabric and scratching his skin, but lost in the sensations originating from his hot, needy pussy Brad hardly noticed until Ajax leaned forward.<br />
<br />
The wolf&#39;s full weight on top of him held him in place, leaving him unable to escape when he heard fangs click together near his ear. Twice more he heard the wolf&#39;s teeth, before Ajax managed to bite onto the collar of his shirt and hold on.<br />
<br />
He thrust deeper and then held, shuddering against Brad. Driven by instincts that he could hardly understand Brad felt his pussy tighten painfully against the know, every muscle inside him contracting and squeezing to coax an orgasm out of Ajax. He could feel the wolf cuming inside him, spurt after powerful spurt, filling him. Ajax&#39;s knot pressed against his pussy like a cork in a bottle, holding all of the hot wolf cum inside him.<br />
<br />
When Ajax tried to pull away Brad felt his pussy clench again, that and the size of the wolf&#39;s knot holding them together.<br />
<br />
Curious, Orion padded back over to the two of them, earning a growl from Ajax.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy guys,&quot; Brad whispered shakily, wondering what would happen if the two wolves started frighting with him literally stuck between them.<br />
<br />
Orion&#39;s tail wagged slowly at the sound of Brad&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
Keeping his distance Orion paced back and forth, much to Ajax&#39;s frustration. He continued to try and pull away, dragging Brad with him, each time the wolf&#39;s knot pressed against his pussy Brad felt him tense against it, stronger and stronger as Ajax&#39;s efforts grew determined until Brad found himself experiencing the longest, most intense orgasm of his life.<br />
<br />
He should have been worried, guests would be showing up at any minute and if he was seen in the wolf enclosure he&#39;d be in trouble, but caught up in the waves of pleasure it was hard for him to focus on anything other than how good it felt to have Ajax&#39;s massive know stuck fast in his pussy.<br />
<br />
It was something he wanted to go on forever, but all good things eventually came to an end and he could feel Ajax&#39;s knot slowly growing smaller, shrinking down until, with one last pull that jerked Brad backwards, Ajax pulled free and trotted off to play with his brother.<br />
<br />
Brad remained on his hands and knees, waiting for the orgasm to fade, listening to the sounds of people in the distance. The zoo was open, guests were arriving and if he didn&#39;t act he&#39;d be seen.<br />
<br />
That galvanized him into action, pulling up his pants and dusting off his knees, Brad hurried to the back of the enclosure and opened the access door.<br />
<br />
Slipping out he hurried to the locker room. Hopefully he had at least a spare shirt there. The dirt on his pants he could explain away easily enough, but the tears in his shirt would be harder to justify.<br />
<br />
As he walked he couldn&#39;t help noticing how empty his pussy felt after having been so thoroughly filled. Without thinking, he slid his hands into his pants to rub at his clit, feeling the smallest trickle of Ajax&#39;s cum dripping from him, most of it remaining deep inside him.</p>
