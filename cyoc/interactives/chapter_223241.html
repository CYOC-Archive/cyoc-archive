<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The quarterback stood in the midst of the ruined locker room showers. He surveyed the wreckage with a keen eye, mentally reconstructing the sequence of events in his head. The chunks of tile, the crushed shower heads, and the thick globs of cum dripping from the ceiling onto his jersey made him so horny it hurt, his erection straining against the cup. And the smell!<br />
<br />
“Dalton!” His coach barked. Dalton was brought out of his reverie as his coach called from behind. “I told you to use the girls’ showers for now; the cheerleaders have already gone home. We’ll get this mess fixed up by next week. Don’t worry about it.”<br />
<br />
But Dalton was not worried about the state of the locker room. In fact, tonight’s victory felt like a distant memory. All he could think about was the cute stud he was supposed to meet afterwards. The only memento left behind were the tattered basketball shorts on the floor, drenched in seed like a perverted glass slipper. “Be there in a sec, Coach.”<br />
<br />
The coach grunted and waved his hand in front of his face. “The sooner the better. Reeks like an orgy in here.” He adjusted his crotch and hurried out the door.<br />
<br />
Dalton spied a second pair of ripped pants amidst the rubble. He picked them up, marveling at its size. The groin contained a gaping hole in the middle that he could easily fit his whole forearm through. The pouch beneath looked oddly stretched, like how his old jockstraps have permanently distended to fit his package.<br />
<br />
“Madame Illusia, what have you done this time?” He mumbled to himself.<br />
<br />
—-<br />
<br />
Tonight was not supposed to go this way. Aaron’s face burned crimson red, not just from the embarrassment of being carried to the car naked, but also from the humiliating road head he was forced to give during the drive back. Kyle didn’t even let him stop at the drive-thru, nonchalantly stuffing the senior’s face while ordering enough food for twenty people.<br />
<br />
“And anything to drink, sir?” The speaker droned.<br />
<br />
“Nah, I think we’re good,” the beast rumbled. “Right, son?” He ruffled his brother’s hair, then forced him to swallow a few more inches. Aaron gagged and sputtered in response, drool and pre spilling from his lips.<br />
<br />
—-<br />
<br />
Aaron flinched as his younger brother slammed the front door behind him. The light from the foyer quickly dispersed as the titan loomed closer.<br />
<br />
“Basement, bitch.” Kyle growled. His rumbling timbre sent the hairs on the back of Aaron’s neck on end. He punctuated his order with a prod from his gargantuan cockhead, sending his older brother tumbling a few steps forward. <br />
<br />
Aaron regained his balance and twirled around. “Kyle, I’m sorry I-“<br />
<br />
“Sir.”<br />
<br />
“Wh-what?”<br />
<br />
“You’ll call me sir from now on, runt. Kind of fitting, since I’m big enough to be your dad. Bigger, even.” He popped his pecs, his enormous hairy chest bumping into his dense beard with each beat. “Hoo yea, much bigger.”<br />
<br />
Mesmerized, Aaron gulped. He’s right. Hell, he looked like he ate dad for breakfast. “S-sir, I’m sorry I didn’t call or text. I got distracted.”<br />
<br />
The behemoth raised an eyebrow. “Distracted with what?”<br />
<br />
“I… I had a date. Sir.”<br />
<br />
Kyle guffawed. “A date? You?” He waddled closer, the house trembling under their feet. He shoved his throbbing length forward, the leaking tip sliding between the wedge in his brother’s chest. “Who would date a pipsqueak runt like you?” He moved even closer, all but smothering the smaller musclefreak with just his huge cock.<br />
<br />
Aaron felt the stark contrast of the cold, lifeless wall at his back to the searing heat of the growing monster in front. He could feel the hefty bull balls swelling bigger, audibly churning with seed, as it enveloped his comparatively pathetic erection on all sides. Most people would kill for 13 inches, yet here he was getting dwarfed by just his little bro’s nutsack. And that’s not even mentioning the 24” spire pressing him against the wall! He bit his lip; it was so warm and already slick with generous pre. “The quarterback,” he whimpered, subconsciously massaging those babymakers.<br />
<br />
“That’s cute.” In one swift motion, the musclebound bully lifted his brother high into the air with one arm. Kyle’s massive dick slapped the wall under Aaron with a resounding thud. He adjusted it to line up with the gaping hole between the airborne teen’s thick thighs. “What’s his name?” The giant removed his hands, and let gravity do its work. The helmet of his impossibly large manhood slipped in almost instantly.<br />
<br />
Aaron’s fierce grunts turned into lewd whines as he slid down the shaft. He desperately palmed the wall to slow the descent, but at 400 pounds of muscle, it was a losing battle. “I, ugh, I just wanted a day off,” he huffed. “To do something I wanted for a change. To be the big- oh fuck so fucking BIG- to be the big guy for once.” He looked up with pleading eyes, searching for a shred of mercy.<br />
<br />
Kyle glowered at him. “Oh, are you tired that we only do whatever I want? That I’m always reminding you how much bigger I am? How do you think I felt growing up with you?”<br />
<br />
The big man on campus could only moan in response; hadn’t Madame Illusia’s<br />
lesson been enough? He felt so fucking stretched, a bulging pressure emerging in his stomach as he continued to slide further down, his vantage point quickly disappearing as humongous pecs began blocking his vision.<br />
<br />
“And besides, I thought you enjoyed this.” Kyle placed both fists on his hips, sucked in a deep breath, and flared his lats with a hiss. His back muscles spread far beyond the realm of plausibility. Kyle looked like he jumped straight out of a muscle morph on the internet, ones that circulate between extreme hyper enthusiasts. Yet he had such a tangible quality to his perfection that separated him from those digitally enhanced images. Sweat covered his body in a bright sheen, dampening his hairy-as-fuck body and making both boys lightheaded from his overwhelming musk.<br />
<br />
He didn’t want to admit it, but Aaron did enjoy this. He lived for it. His 13” member was hard as steel and leaking pre like a faucet. Ever since the spell ended, he realized he was fully, unabashedly smitten with this hulking musclegod. His little bro was the pinnacle of masculinity, over twice his weight in muscle, impaling him with a meat-log that would put horses to shame. And it was still filling him inch after mind-numbing inch… But…<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong, son? Cock got your tongue? Hehehe,” Kyle snickered. “Yea, you love this… you little cockslut.” The beast shifted and grabbed his own wrist from behind, his cannonball shoulders exploding in definition. “What plans could you possibly have that would beat THIS?” He jerked his pelvis, eliciting another cry from the beefy jock. His abgut tightened into shrink-wrapped perfection, veins trailing down to feed the monstrous dick.<br />
<br />
Aaron couldn’t answer. He was stretched to his limit. Kyle had grown even bigger since the shower fuck. His brain was short-circuiting with pleasure. He moaned incoherently, rubbing the bulge pushing against his abdominal wall in delirium. His argument was all but lost.<br />
<br />
“That’s what I thought, bitch. Little guy thinks he can do whatever he wants now that he’s got some muscles. But I’m still BIGGER and STRONGER than you ever will be.” He flexed his cock at ‘bigger’ and ‘stronger,’ causing Aaron to jerk forward and gurgle. Kyle huffed as the jock finally reached the hilt, the firm, meaty asscheeks resting against his tree-trunk thighs. “And you’re just a cocksleeve.” He peered over his pecs and saw the outline of his huge cock in Aaron’s belly eclipsing the older brother’s donkey dick. “Heh, my little cocksleeve. Can’t even see your own dick, can you?”<br />
<br />
Kyle put his meaty hands on the wall and began thrusting. “You’re mine, and mine alone, bitch. Remember that,” he snarled.<br />
<br />
Screaming in ecstasy, Aaron’s whole body rocketed up and down Kyle’s huge cock in a frenzy; loud, wet slaps echoing through the house.<br />
<br />
“Humph, can your quarterback friend fill you up like this? Can he milk you for hours with never ending stamina? Can he pick you up like a toy and manhandle you, make you squirm, make you beg for more, and give you the best fuck of your life?”<br />
<br />
The front door burst open. “He sure can!”</p>
