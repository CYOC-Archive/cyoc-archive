<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;For being over two hundred years out of place, you don&#39;t seem to have too much trouble with the modern world.&quot; Dylan commented as he sat down in the booth across from Jake. The mirror being in his former body had decided he wanted a late lunch, and Dylan wasn&#39;t going to let him out of his sight until his hands were on that mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have your old memories up here, just like you have that guys memories.&quot; Jake tapped the side of his head as he picked up the menu. &quot;And I&#39;m a quick study on top of it. I&#39;ve spent the last three years getting my life set up. So even if we do get you that mirror, don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to let you mess it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan held up his hands in a calming gesture. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind, how did you end up in there anyway?&quot; Dylan picked up his own menu, peering at Jake over the top of it.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Chastity Moore made her way to the old hut on the edge of town where widow McGee lived. Only desperation could have driven her out here to talk to the crazy old woman, but Chastity was out of options. She knocked on the warped wooden door and after a moment it creaked open, one milky eye fixing on her through the crack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw. If it isn&#39;t the sweet little Moore girl.&quot; The woman swung the door open all the way, snapping a sharp. &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chastity winced at the woman&#39;s tone. Other than the milky eye she wasn&#39;t actually that terrible looking, not like one would expect a witch to look at all. She stood straight, and her hair was still full and black. It was only that her husband was dead and her children moved away that made her an outcast. Well, that and the rumors of witchcraft. She took a deep breath and stepped into the small house. &quot;I need a love potion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Some strapping young man has taken your heart but not given his in return?&quot; Widow McGee snorted softly and stepped over to a cabinet. &quot;Supposing I could help you. What do I get out of it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chastity reached into the pocket on the front of her apron and pulled out a broach, gold set with rubies, a family heirloom, and set it on the table. &quot;Will that do?&quot;<br />
<br />
The widow picked it up and turned it over in her hands. &quot;For my price. Yes. But tell me, why such a dear price, sweet Chastity?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My father is sick, he has no sons to inherit the manor. If he dies it goes to my uncle, unless I can marry before then. I will not let my uncle have my home.&quot; Chastity folded her hands in front of herself. &quot;And the man I want doesn&#39;t even seem to see me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Widow McGee nodded and put the broach away in her own pocket. &quot;Very well. I will warn you though, all magic comes at cost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I pai..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tsh.&quot; The witch cut her off. &quot;This was for my services, you still need to pay the magic, and it will chose the cost.&quot; She plucked a pair off bottles off the shelf, one blue, one crimson. &quot;Have him drink the crimson, then you drink the blue. You&#39;ll become the object of his desires.&quot;  Chastity took the bottles and slid them into her apron. &quot;Just be sure you&#39;re willing to pay the price.&quot;<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Chastity poured the vial of blood colored liquid into the tin cup of water, it seemed to disappear, turning back to a clear liquid in a few short seconds. She stood up from beside the well and looked over to where Josiah was chopping wood. The young farmhand was a handsome man indeed. He had is shirt off and worked in only his breeches and boots as he swung the axe into the firewood. His form was dense with strong muscles from farm work and his long black hair was tied at the nape of his neck.<br />
<br />
She may have lied to the witch. Her father&#39;s health was poor, but far from failing. The problem was he would never approve of her being courted by one of the farm hands. She intended to take the choice out of his hands, he wouldn&#39;t be able to deny her once they had made love. She walked over, breathing heavily. &quot;Josiah? You look parched, have a drink.&quot; As he turned to look at her she held out the cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Miss Chastity, I um.&quot; He looked down at the cup and took it. &quot;Your father will be upset if he sees us talking again.&quot; Still, the young man drank from the cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;He won&#39;t see us behind here.&quot; She nodded in the direction of the manor, which was mostly out of sight from where they stood behind a small building that was supposed to be a wood-cutters shed, but served as Josiah&#39;s living quarters. She urged him to drink with another wave of her hand. Once he drank the rest Chastity pulled the other vial out of her apron and downed it quickly with her back to Josiah.<br />
<br />
When she looked back to him, his eyes had glazed over a bit. He stepped forward and wrapped his arms around her, pulling her into a rough but passionate kiss. It was all she could do to pull him into the shed. He was working his fingers at the buttons of her dress as she did the same to his breeches.<br />
<br />
Soon they were free of their clothes and exploring each others&#39; bodies with hands and lips. But something felt strange to Chastity, a tingling feeling growing deep inside her. She looked down, to where their bare chests touched, to see her breasts shrinking away. They were pulling back into her chest, her nipples getting smaller. But the rest of her body seemed to be getting bigger, her shoulders expanding, legs lengthening, she could even feel her long blond hair being pulled back up into her scalp.<br />
<br />
It was so wrong. But the more she changed, the more eager Josiah became. He turned her around, his fingers seeking between her legs, ignoring her slit and instead teasing at her other hole. She reached down herself, intending to guide his hands to her slit, but as she felt between her legs there was only unbroken skin. No, there was a small bump. She shivered as her fingers ran over that small knob.<br />
<br />
Josiah&#39;s fingers left their exploration, only to be replaced with something warm and thick pushing between her cheeks. As he thrust in, her arms and legs continued to thicken, her chest pushing out once more, but with strong, masculine muscle. With each thrust of Josiah&#39;s manhood, blond hairs grew thick between her legs, where that knob was getting thicker and longer. The hair spread down her legs and up her stomach, spreading out across her chest. She could feel an itching on her chin, reaching up to feel whiskers growing on her face, and her hair finally settling into a short, boyish style.<br />
<br />
Finally, her new growth was big enough to grab, she stroked off the new, still swelling manhood between her legs, groaning in a voice that cracked a couple octaves lower as Josiah&#39;s thrust became more insistent and eager.<br />
<br />
She came, the new cock between her legs twitching in her hand, spilling creamy white seed over her thickened fingers. She gasped as Josiah thrust in one last time, his own seed flooding her, though not in the way she had initially hoped. As he pulled free, she turned around. Josiah leaned in close and kissed her. They both sat on the wooden floor next to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t keep doing this, Chastain. Your father will shoot both of us if he ever finds out about this.&quot; Chastity blinked at the name, but it felt right. So did this affair, something they had been carrying on for weeks, despite his father trying to set him up with the daughter of a family in the next town over. New memories shifted in with Chastity&#39;s old ones, and he shivered. What had that witch done?! They were in love now, but could never be together.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to go.&quot; Chastain said softly, leaning in to kiss Josiah one more time. He gathered his clothes, no longer a dress but a mans breaches, shirt and coat and pulled them on.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, sweet little Chastity. I see you used the potion.&quot; The witch said from where she stood by the fire, stirring stew.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?! I&#39;m a man, and not just that I&#39;m..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A Sodomite?&quot; The witch asked, cackling softly as Chastain felt the heat of anger.. &quot;Oh don&#39;t be such a prig. More men do that than you&#39;ll ever know, one day it might even be accepted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I paid for us to be together!&quot; He bellowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You paid for a love potion.&quot; She responded quietly. &quot;And you agreed to the magic&#39;s cost. You have become what he desired. It&#39;s not my fault your romantic dream turned out to prefer men.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, fix it!&quot; Chastain balled his hands into fists. He felt so angry, he wanted to break something.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t.&quot; The witch said with finality.<br />
<br />
Chastain yelled, he grabbed the fire poker from beside the hearth and swung at the witch. She held up a dismissive hand and held him in place. He stood frozen, his would be weapon in the air, one milky eye peering at his disdainfully. &quot;Very well.&quot; The witch said, calm as could be. &quot;We&#39;ll play it like that then.&quot;  She flicked her hand and he stumbled backwards, he felt something cool and smooth press against his back, then he went through it. He stumbled and found himself in a partial copy of the hut, though the edges faded off into a mist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spoiled child. Now you will grant the desires of others but never have your own.&quot; The witch intoned as she stepped closer. Chastain put his hands up and felt glass in front of him. He banged on it but it wouldn&#39;t break. Then his hands started to fall apart into mist. &quot;You will reflect the forms of others, but no more have one of your own.&quot; His arms had dissolved, his legs were no more than a smoky cloud beneath him. He watched as the witch picked up a blanket and strode towards the mirror. &quot;You will remain in there serving others until one of them is foolish enough to let you free.&quot; He faded completely to mist as she tossed the blanket over the mirror, sealing him into darkness and a dreamless sleep.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Dylan stared as Jake recounted the last of his story. &quot;That mirror was my prison after that. I was only aware really when someone came to me for magic, but beyond that, I was less than a thought. But you know how that is, how it feels.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait. You said the witch was widow McGee. McGee is my, your mother&#39;s maiden name.&quot; Dylan poked at his food, mostly eaten during the course of the tale.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, a family heirloom. Someone finally forgot to pass on the warning about me.&quot; Jake said with a smile that at first was a bit vicious but turned sad. &quot;I did get a kick in turning several of the men of your family gay as a repayment though. Including you.&quot; Jake finished off the last few bites of his burger. &quot;Feels even better to have her great-whatever-grandson&#39;s body as mine. Finish up, we should be getting back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dylan frowned at being ordered around, but finished off his own burger as Jake handled the bill.</p>
