<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The afternoon goes by, and Barbara stays in her lazy spot, floating up by the ceiling, only getting invested in the drama show she is watching. As the hours went by, Barbara could tell she had been losing her body being in the air, slowly going down by a centimeter or so. It was getting into the middle of the afternoon, and from once she was near the top of the ceiling, is now just above the center point of the room, in between the ceiling and the floor. As she was enjoying her show, however, she started to feel the need to relieve her bladder. Barbara didn&#39;t want to go back down to the ground or move even, but her body was begging her to use the restroom. Now in her lower elevation, Barbara had a better grasp of grabbing the television remote on the couch and pausing her show. In this elevation, there was no way she could properly use the toilet, not without making a big mess which would make her clean it up. Barbara had one only solution she wouldn&#39;t be so proud of, but it was the only drainer that would be high enough to mostly properly use it.<br />
<br />
Barbara decides to push her belly hard with her hands, praying for the air to change her position without the robe&#39;s belt. In her luck, the air was able to divert back into her levitating pose, with the big butt and breasts. Swimming over to the kitchen, she prepared herself to use the sink. Getting her legs on top of the counter, she made her light walk to the front of the sink and turned the faucet away for easier seating. Once she sat down, her legs were dangling over the kitchen floor, but her elevation was still making her butt lightly float above the sink, making her butt in a somewhat-squatting pose. Barbara tried pulling down her good boyshorts, which came off easier than she thought it would, and with some minor pressure on her bladder, she started to pee in the sink. This admittedly wasn&#39;t the worst she could have peed at, back in her youth Barbara would hit on parties and drunk pee herself or on bushes and even a couple of carpets. At the very least the windows were still covered and her mostly helium body was making the sink feel like squatting above a bucket. As her bladder finishes releasing, Barbara opens a nearby cabinet full of random stuff to pull out fast food napkins she keeps around and cleans herself up with them. Throwing them away in a trash bin at the edge of the sink, Barbara pulls up the boy shorts still dangling across her feet gets off the sink, and turns around to wash her hands, surprising seeing no urine on the counter or the floor.<br />
<br />
Floating over to the cabinets, Barbara opens one of them up to grab the same bag of chips she was snacking on earlier, and she swims back to the living room side, this time above the couch as she was going to be chilling in front of the television all day. Dropping the chips on the coffee table and, after a couple of attempts, grabbing the television remote to continue playing her drama show, Barbara decided to not go back to her lying position and decided to only push the air around her thigh area up to her belly, making her bend back like a reclined chair. With her feet able to lie on her coffee table, Barbara was back on her show, still invested for more. More hours would pass back, and Barbara would slowly elevate lower. Eventually able to sit back on her couch, Barbara checks the time on her phone to see that she has lost time from her show, being early evening once again. Pausing her show and getting up for the first time in a long period of the day, Barbara tries laying on the floor to see if she still has some active lightness, to see that she could float about an inch above the floor with her same big size. Getting back up, Barbara finally grabs her robe on the floor, covers her chest, and brings out the leftover pasta she had from the previous night. After microwaving it, Barbara starts to eat her food for the night.<br />
<br />
After Barbara finishes her food, she decides to hit the bed earlier today but wants to take care of her air-filled state. Grabbing the chopsticks still left on the table, Barbara unties her balloon lip again, turning back to her normal state and having an opened lip on her left palm. Turning off the television, Barbara starts putting away the chips in the same cabinet, she grabs her phone and walks away into her bedroom. As she gets into her bed, still wearing the robe this time, her phone pops a notification. As Barbara reads the notification, she receives her doctor&#39;s appointment as the final day of the government shutdown, at eleven-thirty in the morning sharp with instructions for her free ride in an ambulance vehicle, just like before. It has a final note from her doctor specifically, asking for her to be in her most comfortable state as a perfect fusion. She notes it mentally, to be in her most comfortable state as she meets her doctor, and lays asleep from her floating day.<br />
<br />
She drifts asleep again, and once again gets a vivid realistic dream. Waking up in a small decorated room, right next to Martin, Barbara gets up and remembers her amazing cruise trip, a week&#39;s cruise of the Caribbean islands. Martin shortly gets up after, kissing Barbara and wishing her a good morning. Barbara and Martin get off of their bed, for Barbara sees herself in a pretty and cozy dress and Martin in a nice polo and slacks. They both go out and enjoy their gorgeous sunny day on the ship, eating shrimp, drinking champagne, and watching the entertainers for the afternoon. All and all, it was an amazing day for Barbara, to be with her love and be on a well-deserved vacation. However, as her guards were at an all-time low, enjoying the moments she had made on this trip, the ship suddenly combusted in the middle portion, sending some people in the air, and bumping Barbara next to Martin, knocking them both on the floor. As they both start getting their consciousness, Barbara and Martin start to freak out as they see their side of the ship starting to sink. Before processing anything, Barbara feels Martin grabbing out her left palm, which has her balloon end and starts to blow in it. Within a few blows, Barbara starts to become a big ball, and Martin ties her end making her stuck in that state. With her dress all stretched out, almost breaking, Martin tries to get in between the dress and Barbara for his safety. As the ship entirely sinks, Barbara falls off of it, with Martin securely against her. As she touches the lukewarm water, Barbara wakes up once more, all sweaty, heavily breathing. &quot;Man,&quot; Barbara notes to herself, &quot;this is going to be a hard five days.&quot;</p>
