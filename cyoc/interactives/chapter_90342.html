<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John found a quest giver. This quest gave John enough money that he could buy some clothes, a weapon and a bag with eight slots for equipment. It was basic equipment, the kind that characters usually start a game with but it was better than nothing. John searched the village to see if he could get any more equipment but it was clear that the game meant for him to enter the dungeon as is.<br />
<br />
The sand burned John&#39;s bare feet. He had a leather tunic that covered everything important but it didn&#39;t even cover his knees. The hot sun beat down on him. John wondered, &quot;How am I even feeling heat since I&#39;ve been changed into a digital screen pet?&quot; But other than the heat, John enjoyed this game.<br />
<br />
The first level of the dungeon was very easy. There wasn&#39;t any treasure but the monsters were so fragile that John thought he didn&#39;t even need the weapon. He could kill these guys with his bare hands. One of the crabs did pinch John&#39;s ankle and that hurt but John simply crushed the crab out of existence.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Steve got bored sitting at his laptop watching John play. Steve couldn&#39;t do anything. He had tried to give John equipment but the computer didn&#39;t allow that. Steve pulled up John&#39;s character screen to see John&#39;s stats. Since the game had just begun all the stats were minimum. Steve wanted to see if he could boost any stats and when John had earned enough points, Steve clicked to spend points on strength.<br />
<br />
In the game, John felt it as his muscles became just a little bigger. He flexed his bicep and thought he saw an increase in size. &quot;Thanks Steve. Did you just give me more muscle?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve said, &quot;Yes, I guess I do have something I can do in this game.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the game, John had entered level two and was getting ready to strike a crab with his club, (The basic beginners weapon). Suddenly John&#39;s arm shoved the club in his bag which allowed the crab to strike. John&#39;s leather protected him.<br />
<br />
Steve said, &quot;Sorry, I wanted to see if I had any control over your equipment.&quot;<br />
<br />
John said, &quot;You do but you could have picked a better time. Can I have my club back.&quot;<br />
<br />
John managed to kill the crab with his bare hands before Steve clicked causing John to pull his club out of his bag. John continued into the dungeon and saw a small wolf in the distance. John snuck up preparing to kill the wolf when suddenly he stopped, removed his clothes and shoved them in his bag.<br />
<br />
Steve laughed hysterically. John tried to reach into his bag to retrieve his clothes but they weren&#39;t in his bag. The game worked that John had control of everything until he put it in his bag, then he was dependent on Steve to let him get it back out of his bag.<br />
<br />
John complained, &quot;Ha ha. Very funny. You want to watch me go through this dungeon naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve said, &quot;Sorry. I&#39;ll fix it.&quot;<br />
<br />
John got dressed and continued deeper into the dungeon. Then it seemed that Steve got distracted because there was no more interference. There was also no more help. John got to dungeon four without any upgrades in his stats which made level four more challenging. John got some treasure and a port key so he could quickly travel to the village and back. He bought some more armor and weapons but couldn&#39;t get them out of his bag so he waited in level four for Steve to come back.<br />
<br />
Steve finally came back and said, &quot;Sorry John. I was setting up to make the game an MMORPG.&quot;<br />
<br />
John asked, &quot;You mean people from all over the world can play in this dungeon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve said, &quot;No, I limited it to just some people I know. They&#39;re making avatars and they&#39;ll catch up with you to form a party. Meanwhile, let&#39;s upgrade your stats.&quot;<br />
<br />
John flexed his arm and watched as his bicep grew noticeably larger. Steve increased a few other stats as well.<br />
<br />
Then the other players began to catch up with John. At least their characters did. Their characters didn&#39;t look nearly as realistic as John did. The graphics were good but the characters looked like animated dolls.<br />
<br />
Chad said, &quot;So it&#39;s true. John is in the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
John knew Chad and the others who joined his gaming party. Chad was a computer geek just like Steve and John. There was also Alex and Henry. Rounding out the set was Abby who John considered to be his girlfriend although Abby was undecided.<br />
<br />
After greetings were over, Chad changed his armor. John saw Chad&#39;s character strip and put on armor but Chad&#39;s character looked like a ken doll under his armor and even that was pixelated out. Alex also changed and it was the same thing.<br />
<br />
John said, &quot;Alright let me find some place private to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
But Steve didn&#39;t give him that option. Steve clicked the button and John stripped right there in front of his friends. John could hear the laughter of all his friends on the speakers. John covered himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; John shouted. &quot;Alright Steve. You&#39;ve had your laugh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve said, &quot;Hey Henry, John has some armor that he won&#39;t need. Here you go.&quot; and Steve clicked to give all John&#39;s armor to Henry. Then Steve clicked to have John pull out a weapon for each hand. There was more laughter.<br />
<br />
Abby said, &quot;John, you look stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
This caused John to relax a little and not cover himself so much. But John didn&#39;t look like a ken doll. As little John became visible, Abby blushed and said, &quot;Oh, sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
John shouted, &quot;You&#39;re not going to make me go through this dungeon naked are you?&quot;</p>
