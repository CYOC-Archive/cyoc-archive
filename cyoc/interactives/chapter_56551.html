<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Bagley led Rain to the offices of the center. He stopped in front of a door with the <br />
name Megan Smith on the door. He knocked and opened the door saying, &quot;I have a <br />
new girl for you Megan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan looked up from her paper work and asked, &quot;What's her name and what did she <br />
do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her name is Rain,&quot; Mr. Bagley said pushing Rain forward, &quot;and she tried to steal <br />
some equipment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's her last name?&quot; Megan asked writing down the information on a form.<br />
<br />
&quot;She doesn't have one,&quot; Mr. Bagley said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Rain was a guy who started poking his nose where it didn't belong,&quot; Mr. Bagley <br />
said. &quot;We chipped him and chose Rain as his transformation. However a glitch <br />
developed that erased his DNA from the chip and the chip isn't accepting his DNA at <br />
all. This leaves him as Rain now. We didn't bother with a last name since it was just <br />
supposed to be temporary and with any luck he wouldn't be transforming much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then she needs a last name,&quot; Megan said thinking. She looked Rain up and down <br />
then said, &quot;Your last name will be Appleton. So Rain Appleton and her crime is <br />
attempted theft. Would not tell us who her parents or guardian are. What age did you <br />
make her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eleven,&quot; Mr. Bagley said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll use today's date as her birthday,&quot; Megan said writing more stuff down. <br />
&quot;Psychological analysis to be conducted as soon as possible. I'm assuming you want <br />
her confined to her room for the time being.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Mr. Bagley said. &quot;We don't want her wandering around without <br />
supervision.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll put her in G211 then,&quot; Megan said. &quot;Charlotte and Nancy are also confined to their <br />
room and there's a bed available in that room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now just wait a minute,&quot; Rain said angrily. &quot;I didn't do anything wrong. It's you guys <br />
that are basically torturing the kids here and transforming them against their wills. That <br />
is in direct violation of the Transformation Services Agreement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That law does not apply to us,&quot; Megan said with a dangerous edge to her voice. &quot;We <br />
are operating under a special exemption that allows us to transform people against <br />
their will. We are working to reform juvenile delinquents and it's working. We will not <br />
tolerate anyone trying to shut us down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her chip is set up with another transformation now,&quot; Mr. Bagley said putting his phone <br />
away. &quot;Her new transformation will have her paralyzed from the waist down <br />
necessitating her wearing a diaper. Of course I can't guarantee that she'll change back <br />
after an hour. The glitch may just accept that as her natural form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain paled a bit at that since she didn't want to be confined to a wheelchair for the rest <br />
of her life. &quot;What's her trigger?&quot; Megan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well obviously being outside of her room, the dinning room, or the toilets and showers <br />
without a staff member being within ten feet of her,&quot; Mr. Bagley said. &quot;With anything <br />
else we'll have to use the guns.&quot;<br />
<br />
A beep came from Megan's computer and she clicked a few keys. After she wrote <br />
down some more information on the paper. When she put her pen down she said, <br />
&quot;Well it's time to take you to your room Rain. Follow me and stay within ten feet of <br />
me.&quot; She said this with a smile almost daring Rain to try and escape. She got up and <br />
Rain followed her as she began to explain the rules. &quot;Rule number one is that no boys <br />
are allowed in the girl's section and no girls in the boy's section. Rule number two is <br />
that all girls will wear dresses and Mary Janes. I expect you to take those clothes off <br />
when you get to your room. I'll bring some new clothes up for you and you will wear <br />
them. Rule number three is that you will shower every morning and brush your teeth <br />
both in the morning and before you go to bed. Rule number four is that you will be <br />
present at mealtimes unless you are sick. Breakfast is at seven, lunch is at noon, and <br />
dinner is at six. Rule number five is that there are no soft drinks or alcohol allowed in <br />
the center. The only drinks allowed are water and juice. Rule number six is that there <br />
is no tobacco or other drugs allowed in the center except for medicines. Rule number <br />
seven is no kissing and no sex between boys and girls. Here's your room. Remember <br />
that I want you to take off those clothes once you're inside. If I come back and you're <br />
still in those clothes you will be transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan knocked on the door then opened it. Inside were two girls who looked up from <br />
reading books when the door opened. &quot;Hello Ms. Smith,&quot; the girl with red curly hair <br />
down to her shoulders said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a new roommate for you two,&quot; Megan said and pushed you forward. &quot;This is <br />
Rain Appleton and she's eleven. Rain these are Charlotte Babcock and Nancy Blue.&quot; <br />
Charlotte had the red hair and green eyes while Nancy had sandy brown hair and <br />
deep blue eyes. &quot;Nancy is seventeen and Charlotte is fourteen. I'll go get your new <br />
clothes Rain. Remember that I want you out of those clothes by the time I get back.&quot; <br />
She left closing the door behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what did you do to end up in here?&quot; Nancy asked as Rain took off her shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess the official story is that I attempted to steal some equipment from here,&quot; <br />
Rain said sitting down on the unoccupied bed and taking her shoes off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Official story?&quot; Charlotte asked looking very curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's what they're going to tell people,&quot; Rain said taking her pants off and <br />
sighing. &quot;What actually happened was I was looking into the radical changes in <br />
behavior most kids seemed to demonstrate. When I came here I saw the fear in the <br />
eyes of the kids and saw one boy's nose grow. I asked about it and they transformed <br />
me into this girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you before?&quot; Charlotte asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A thirty-six year old man,&quot; Rain said sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;And they put you in here?&quot; Nancy asked shocked. &quot;What's going to happen when you <br />
change back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a glitch so I can't change back,&quot; Rain said looking down and really noticing <br />
her flat crotch. &quot;The chip won't accept my old DNA so I'm stuck like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've heard that there were glitches with the chips,&quot; Nancy said. &quot;Though so far the <br />
glitches have only transformed people unexpectedly with no trigger. Most of us here <br />
have that glitch with our chips. We can't be let out on the streets because they would <br />
be working overtime modifying peoples memories that see us transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That has to be rough,&quot; Rain said shaking her head. &quot;What did you two do to end up <br />
here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlotte looked sad as she said, &quot;I got into a fight with another girl and accidentally <br />
killed her. It was an accident but her friends said I had attacked her and that I had <br />
threatened to kill her before. So I wound up being labeled as a juvenile delinquent and <br />
here I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As for me I egged my house and my dad sent me here,&quot; Nancy said. &quot;Unfortunately <br />
my chip developed a glitch so I couldn't go home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain looked at Nancy and something clicked so she asked, &quot;Is your dad Mayor <br />
Richard Blue?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nancy blushed and said, &quot;You're the first to figure it out that fast. My dad has said that <br />
I'm away in Europe so people just assume that I just happen to have the same name <br />
and just happen to look like me. Also people have seen me in Europe which reinforces <br />
my dad's story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you do being confined to this room?&quot; Rain asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we either read books approved by the center,&quot; Charlotte said with a frown. &quot;That <br />
means no books that have a lot of violence in them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also we have sex,&quot; Nancy said. &quot;Don't worry though we won't insist that you join in. <br />
You haven't entered puberty yet so it wouldn't be right to include you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain looked down at her flat chest and smooth crotch and said, &quot;Well at least I won't <br />
have to worry about having a period yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door and it opened. When Megan came in Nancy said, <br />
&quot;Hello Ms. Smith.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have your new clothes Rain,&quot; Megan said. &quot;Put them on and I'll take you three down <br />
to the dining hall for lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan had brought in a rack full of dresses and seven pairs of Mary Jane shoes. Rain <br />
picked out a lite yellow dress with ruffles and put it on then put a pair of Mary Janes <br />
on. &quot;What were you girls talking about?&quot; Megan asked as Rain was picking out her <br />
dress and dressing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Rain was just telling us why she was here,&quot; Charlotte said.<br />
<br />
Megan shook her head and said, &quot;It's so sad when someone as young as she is starts <br />
a life of crime. Fortunately this seems to be her first offense so we should be able to <br />
treat. I still have hope that you'll be able to be treated too Charlotte.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was an accident,&quot; Charlotte said looking a bit angry. &quot;She attacked me. I was only <br />
defending myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan sighed and seeing that Rain was dressed said, &quot;Well let's get down to the <br />
dining hall.&quot;</p>
