<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eventually we had to get out of the lake. The moon had traveled much further across the sky than I thought it would have but having fun with a giant werewolf would tend to make time go by pretty fast. I got out of the lake and went back up to the cliff side to get my shorts and backpack. Once at the top, I could see Ethan still swimming. Though, he bit at the water. When he came back up, there was a fish flopping around in his mouth. He quickly chomped down on it and went after a few others. Each time he went down, he seemed to come out with another fish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess this lake has a lot more in it than I thought...&quot; I said as I dried my hands on my shorts. There was no way I was about to let a magical device capable of making werewolves or an entire new body of water in a manmade forest. It was a full-on natural ecosystem. This thing was so much stronger than I could have ever imagined when I first wrote something down.<br />
<br />
Once I felt my hands were dry enough I went back to the notebook. &#39;I brought a towel in my backpack.&#39; As the glow disappeared, a lump appeared in my backpack. I went over and pulled out a pool towel and started to dry myself off. By the time I was finished, Ethan was back up by me and shook his fur. &quot;Hey!&quot; I shouted at him. He just shook his body again and I pulled up my towel to stay dry. But with the amount of water still dripping off him, it was obvious that he wasn&#39;t going to be dry for a while. &quot;Hold it!&quot; I scolded him.<br />
<br />
He waited a bit while I went back to the notebook. &#39;After 3 large jumps, Ethan can completely dry himself off.&#39; The words lost their light and Ethan dropped to the bottom of a squat. His legs flexed and he jumped into the sky. &quot;Woah...&quot; I stared as he went past the canopy and disappeared into the night sky. The trees around me must have been at least 30 feet in the air. A soft breeze emanated from his body as he soared upwards and then again as he dropped. I was even more surprised by the lack of a sound as he hit the ground again. But by the time he hit the ground, he&#39;d done it again. And then again.<br />
<br />
I stared dumbly as he stood back at his full height. I went over and pet his fur. It was dry. Completely. I pet it a couple of times. Then he reached down and picked me up to cradle me again. &quot;WOAH WOAH WOAH!&quot; I pushed against his meaty chest. He looked at me, tilting his head in a cute confusion. &quot;Just a second! You can pick me up like this. That&#39;s fine. I just need to prepare something first. Just let me down for a second.&quot; Even though he was over twice my size, he set me down gently. Then leaned over as I pulled my notebook back out. Ethan looked over my shoulder. &quot;We just need to make sure that you don&#39;t get seen. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Woof!<br />
<br />
&#39;When Ethan takes me back to the college campus, no one other than me will notice him until he turns back into a human.&#39; I turned back to him. &quot;Ready!&quot;<br />
<br />
WOOF~!<br />
<br />
His arm slid along my side and then easily hefted me back up to his chest. As he did so, he took another leap into the air, jumping from tree to tree as he went back to the college campus. I held on tightly as the wind whipped against my face. Before I knew it, we were back on the concrete parking lot and he set me back down. &quot;Alright... Let&#39;s get back to my room. Okay?&quot; Ethan let out a soft bark and lowered himself as much as an 8&#39;6&quot; creature could possibly be. His massive muscular frame would barely fit into any door.<br />
<br />
Luckily, he was able to remain completely silent. Even though I knew he was right behind me, I would have to look back to make sure he hadn&#39;t left me. We crossed the parking lot, passed the library, went around the computer science building and then through a couple of the dorms. To my surprise, the magic made it impossible for anyone to notice. Couples were kissing. Frat guys vomited the moment we passed by. And Ethan easily climbed atop a building to avoid detection. Even the security seemed to turn around right when we were in eyesight.<br />
<br />
Still Ethan remained silent as we went into the dorm building, climbed to the third floor and then into my room. His body had to twist and turn to properly fit inside the doors. The doors weren&#39;t quite wide enough to properly fit his broad shoulders. He took to walking on all fours as he walked through the hallway but climbed up the staircase almost like a monkey. His long arms easily reached the higher floors. Just like before, I draped myself from his shoulders as he reached up to the third floor.<br />
<br />
When we made it to my room, I finally let out a heavy breath. &quot;Woah... It worked,&quot; I dropped onto the bed. My clock said it was 3:30am. Far later than I had ever imagined staying up. A long heavy yawn rolled out of my mouth. Ethan copied. &quot;You tired too?&quot; He nodded, then climbed up onto my bed cuddling with me. &quot;He-hey!&quot; I muttered but his heavy arm went limp. I tried to push it off, but even that by itself was too heavy to lift. A dull snore blew out of his muzzle as his breathing settled. His body curled around me as I too drifted off to sleep.</p>
