<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Barber had few rules, but the main one he stuck to was that no one younger than the legal age from where they were from could be effected by change.  So the child in the chair getting his hair clipped was off limits.  He was a young child of around 6, of obvious African decent but a bit fair skinned.  The man waiting for his child was Caucasian, in his late 30s, but the Barber had been around long enough to know about the many twist and turns love takes, and how DNA can be combined.  As if he didn’t dabble in that on a daily basis himself.  <br />
But the two had come in laughing and talking to each other a mile a minute.  The Barber also knew about weekend Dads and how they had to cram a full week, if not more, into a day or just a visit.  The father had disturbed the Barber a bit asking for his son’s hair to be clipped down from the grown out Afro the child currently sported.  Not because he thought it would only look better, but the father kept mentioning how tired he was combing out the “rat’s nest.”  The child didn’t seem to mind and if it made both of them happy, the Barber didn’t have any reason not to please his customers.<br />
<br />
He had already cut quite a bit of the child’s hair when there was a loud commotion coming from the other side of the front window.  Suddenly another white male also in his late 30s like the man who brought the child in bust into the store, screaming his lungs out, every other word a profanity.  He was carrying a set of clothes from the cleaners down the block, obviously a woman’s dress inside the clear bag, which he took a moment to hang on the coat rack.  The man waiting for the child joined in immediately as the two men engaged in a screaming match that was almost comical in it’s execution.  Both men screaming insult and curses at each other, without even taking time to hear what the other was saying.  <br />
<br />
But it was when the small boy in the chair covered his ears and began to cry that the Barber stepped in.<br />
“Excuses me gentlemen.  GENTLEMEN!!” He screamed. “This will stop and will stop right now!!”<br />
Slowly the two men stopped their yelling but it was still several seconds before they realized the child was crying.<br />
“OH great, see you what did asshole!!” The first man yelled,  “You made him cry.  Things were going fine till you came along. “<br />
“Like shit, the kid cries at the drop of a hat.  Toby stop that!!!” the second man yelled at the child.<br />
The Barber stepped between the chair and the two men, blocking the child’s view of them. “I’ve been around a while, Sirs, and I can assure you that screaming at a child to get them to stop crying has never worked. Did you say the child’s name was Toby?”<br />
“Yea.”<br />
The Barber turned about and faced Toby so they were eye to eye.  “Toby, you’re all done with your hair cut do you like it?”  He wasn’t surprised when the child wasn’t able to stop crying long enough to give a real answer.  “Ok, we’re going to take care of your two friends here so they won’t upset you again.  So, how about this?  As a special treat, every young boy or girl who gets their hair cut here for the first time gets to go two doors down for a free ice-cream cone.  Would you like that?”<br />
“Yes.” Toby said meekly.  If asked, the child would probably have been happy to get out of the store and away from the two adults even if he had been offered a trip to a dentist instead, but free ice cream didn’t come along every day.<br />
“Well you’re a big boy Toby and have been very good today, you deserve this treat.  What I want you to do is take this card and go down to the ice cream shop and tell the lady behind the counter I said you’re to get a free cone of ANY flavor you want.  She’ll know what to do.”<br />
“K’”<br />
“Good.  Scoot.” He helped the child off the chair and headed him out the door.<br />
“Where do you get off sending my child off for ice-cream when…”<br />
“He’s not your child you idiot, it’s my name of the birth certificate..”<br />
“But I’m raising him with his mother, I’m paying his bills…”<br />
“You’re just shacking up with his Mom, as so many in the past have.  You might live with them but she’s paying the bills.  Did you pay for the dry cleaning you just picked up, or did she have to give you the money for it first?”<br />
“Hey at least I’m there everyday to help out my family when they need it.”<br />
‘Your FAMILY, that’s rich.   It’s not like you have legal custody.”<br />
“Neither do you Mr. One Afternoon a MONTH visitation rights.  You only see the child because you know it hurts his mother to see you take him away”<br />
“And you’re only nice to the kid so you can still fuck his Mom.”<br />
“Still waiting to hear the part about which one of you loves the child more.” The Barber said trying to interrupt the fight.<br />
“Hey, don’t start in smart guy.  I’m going to get him Mother to sue you for giving him that haircut.  This jackass has no rights when it comes to decisions like that.  Do you let strangers drag kids in here and you just cut the kid’s hair anyway they say?”<br />
“I’m not a stranger I’m his father.”<br />
“GET OVER IT!!!  The kid’s black, you’re white, his Mom’s white.  Means the tramp was screwing someone else when she was screwing you.  The only difference was, he got away and you got stung.”<br />
“And how do you know she’s not screwing around on you?  Or is this true love for once?”<br />
“I don’t care who she screws around with as long as I keep that roof over my head.”<br />
<br />
“GENTLEMEN!  This is getting no where and has gotten long past tiring.  You’re arguing over a child neither one of you has any emotional investment with, yet you both fight over his custody.  And again, not for the good of the child but, in some way, to either get something from, or to get even with, his Mother.”<br />
“Fuck you.”<br />
“We’ll be getting to that soon enough. Do you know what would help the two of you act more mature, hair cuts.”<br />
“That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.  No wonder you’re still just a Barber.  It’ll be free right?” <br />
“Not in cash but there’s always a price”<br />
“Whatever.  Hey, I’m for it.  But you try anything funny and I’ll bust your ass.”<br />
“Yes well, let’s not get into whose ass is going to go bust right now.  If I understood right, “The Barber said placing a cloth around the man’s neck, “You live with the child’s mother but don’t have custody?  Let’s work on that whole custody angle shall we.  Lean back.”<br />
<br />
The other ‘Father’ waited in the chair.  Nervously tapping his foot and looking outside.  And oddly not noticing when the man in the chair came out of his shampoo with a full Afro on his white body.  “Just sit still while I get to work on this. “The Barber said as he started portioning off the hair.  With the first twist the man started to change.  Each braid close to the skull, each knot the man got darker.  His lips because fuller, the head a bit more rounded off in back.  The eyebrow heavier.  His nose, while fairly nondescript before, flattened out and pressed closer to his head, a slight ball on the tip.   Still the barber continued to tie the hair off and down from the front to the back of the head.  By the time the first two center cornrows were done.  The man was fully African, skin a dark black, not near a shade of brown.  Arms and legs now smooth with only a bit of hair in his pits and above his crotch, which matched his heritage now, thick, curled and black.  Cheekbones stuck out a bit more and his eye, were like those you’d find on the average person walking along the Nile.  Almond shaped, heavy lidded but with a brightness behind them that wasn’t there before.  <br />
<br />
The Barber went to work on the next two sets of cornrows.  As he turned and twisted the hair the man began to grow.  Not only in height but also in build.  First the Barber found he had to reach up more than before as the man reach 6’6”.  The cloth that had covered him before now wasn’t long enough to keep his shoulders under it.  The arched out in round mounds of muscle, silky black and solid.  His chest swelled and pushed the cloth out, and his legs erupted with muscles too.  By the time the Barber was done with the second set of rows, the man was a bodybuilding monster.  Almost obscenely muscled.  Arms too big for the average person to be able understand just how big they were.  For not only were the biceps gigantic, the hanging triceps were bigger than most people’s legs.  And his legs, cut, etched with muscles, calves that ballooned out.  His ass grew outward from his hips like a shelf.  Arched round and perfect beyond belief. <br />
<br />
Then the Barber went to work on the last set of rows, each opposite side of each other, right above the ears.  With each twist and turn, the man became younger and younger.  His change from Caucasian to African and then to a bodybuilder took some to the noticeable wear off, but he still looked to be in his 30’s when the Barber started.  That didn’t last long.  The skin tightened, the chin pulled in.  Small tears and rips on the shoulder from all the workouts, almost stretch mark like tears, healed.  Back his age went to about 22 maybe 23. <br />
<br />
When the Barber pulled off the cloth, in the chair sat a giant of a man.  Young, huge, a total bodybuilder with a stern look on his face but with a life behind his eyes his old self lost years ago.  He wore a skin tight, since most of his clothes would have to be skin tight anyway, skin tight black cut off tee, which had it’s sleeves cut off too.  Almost like a giant sports bra.  And an incredible tight pair of stretch shorts that did nothing to hide the enormous cock he now carried.  It obviously liked what it saw in the mirror since the stretch fabric of the material was given all the more a test when the cock started to grow.  <br />
<br />
“That’s great work man.  I appreciate your taking the time to do all that.” He said checking himself in the mirror. His voice was like a low rumble of thunder.  “Now you.” He said addressing the other ’father’ who, while he sat in the chair the whole time, did not react to the incredible change that had just happened. “Get your ass in this chair so we can discuss what’s right for the child and what we’re going to be doing to make things better.”<br />
<br />
The other father got into the chair and allowed the Barber to cover his with the cloth.  He seemed to do so almost out of intimidation as out of a wanting he couldn’t express.  <br />
<br />
“How about the same thing, with a bit of a difference?” the Barber said leaning the man back in the chair for a shampoo.  Like the first man, when he came up his hair was in a large Afro style, much fuller and longer than the first man.  The Barber went to work braiding the hair, but instead of cornrows like the first man, the hair started coming out in Dreadlocks.   Long and thick hanging off his head with a heavy weight.  In a style the man he had once been would have considered a rat’s nest that was impossible to take care of.  Now it was going to be his life, his heritage.  <br />
<br />
With each dreadlock the man changed.  As he changed into his new African decent, his skin took on a deep brown, with underlying honey tone to it.  Free of any complexion issues the skin shown under the shop’s light, almost glowed.  The lips were even thicker than the first mans, full and rich.  The nose flat and the eyebrow only slightly pushed out from where it was before.  The eyes again started to sparkle and gleam with a life not possible in the old body.  <br />
<br />
The changes continued as the Barber locked the hair.  He also began to grow in the chair, to 6’4”.  His muscles not quite as incredible outstanding as the first man’s but not your average build.  But where the muscles might have looked leaner, in truth they were just better defined.  If a bodybuilder could have a lithe build, this man was now the perfect example.  His legs grew long with the muscles and calves leaner in comparison.  Almost like a dancer who turned the weight lifting.  His feet and hands grew, slightly out of proportion to the rest of him, but nothing freakish.  Just better to hold the weights and more traction for his long runs each morning.  His age went down to around 21, but as his old self looked older for the 37 he was, this new man looked younger, almost a teen still. <br />
<br />
At first look the men could be what was called Thugz or Gangstas.  No matter what the current slag term was, the classic label would have to be Bas Asses.  Solid in frame and sure of every move they made.  Imposing just by walking into a room.  All eyes would be on them.  A touch of fear and intimidation from those who even knew them best.  But appearances weren’t always what they seem, especially inside this Barbershop.  <br />
<br />
“Can’t help but notice you’re enjoying the man’s work.” <br />
<br />
“The man’s a craftsman that’s for sure.” The bodybuilder said taking out his cock.  It was as hugely proportioned as the rest of him, but so dark black to be almost blue. “Usual bet?”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good to me.” The man in the chair said pulling up the cloth that was covering so he too could lower his identical shorts and take out his ever-growing meat.  It wasn’t as think as his friends, but longer for a good inch, out to 11. <br />
<br />
“Let’s make it a little more interesting.  The first one to shoot is the one who has to spread ‘em, but the one who gets to fuck also gets to tell Toby’s Mom what we have planned.”<br />
<br />
“Bright idea there Officer.  Get me thinking about some loose dried out pussy while we see who can soot their load first in order to get fucked.  You must really want your ass plowed cause that’s not exactly the image I need to get me off at the moment.”  He turned his head slightly to address the Barber. “You can continue my Man.”<br />
<br />
As the Barber began to wrap up his work on the man, the tattoos began to start forming.  Up his back and across his chest.  Jet black and perfectly drawn the tribal tattoos continued.  They reached down his back, by passing his ass and wrapped around the legs to just above the knees.  On the first man they would have been lost in all the blackness of the natural skin tone, but on this new man, they were a literal work of art.<br />
<br />
When the Barber was done in the chair was a tattooed black man with an explosion of dreadlocks coming from his head and cascading down his back.  Muscled almost like an anatomy chart, and wearing the exact same skintight black stretch outfit the first man had been wearing.<br />
<br />
The bodybuilding monster in the chair was sweating more and more.  Even though the skintight shirt he was wearing was pitch black, a large sweat stain was spreading from between his massive pecs and under each arm.  His breathing got deeper and a gleam came into his eyes.  With incredible dexterity for a man his size he leaned forward bending his head down as low as it could go.  With a snake like smoothness his tongue inched out of his mouth till it rested just at the tip of his cock.  A second later, he shot his load, up his tongue and into his own mouth.  He licked the last remaining bits of cum off his lips before leaning back in the chair.<br />
<br />
“I don’t really consider this loosing you know.”<br />
<br />
“Ain’t paid the price yet.  Pull them panties down, Now.” He said getting out of the chair and walking over to the first man.  The giant of a bodybuilder got out of the waiting area chair and wrapped his mammoth hand around the back of the man’s head.  He pulled him in for a deep full kiss and when he pulled away, he had the other man’s lower lip in his teeth.  Lightly but enough to hold it for a second or two before releasing the lip. As they pulled away the smaller man also licked some of his partner’s left over cum from his lips.<br />
<br />
“That load should have been mine. You’ll have to pay for denying me that mouthful later on.  In the meantime, I said drop ‘em”<br />
<br />
The body builder was spent and still breathing deeply when he pulled his shorts down to the floor and turned around.   He began to stroke his spent cock again as he turned and offered his ass hole up for fucking.  He had one hand on his cock and one on the wall and he leaned foreword, spreading his legs out too.  Sweat poured down his back and pooled just above the ass.   The giant ass cheeks parting to a black hole waiting for a fuck.  <br />
<br />
His partner positioned his foot just right and kicked the prone man’s legs out even farther.  “You do that everyday don’t you big man.  How does it feel?”  He rolled down shorts his while continuing to stroke his meat. <br />
<br />
“I don’t usually fuck the guys I frisk lover.”<br />
<br />
“Usually?  Interesting choice of words.”  <br />
<br />
 His dick was leaner than the other mans.  But the head was as big as an apple, and almost purple in its color.  He pressed it for a second against the asshole and then drove it in.  While he gasped and waited, the man getting fucked didn’t even twitch.  He gripped the larger man by the side of his ass with each hand and started in.  The fucker’s hips jerked and pumped the man’s ass, almost sending him into the wall with the force he was giving off.  But all the man who was getting fucked could say was, “Harder … HARDER!!!”  The bodybuilder didn’t cum a second time but his partner shot his entire load into the big man’s ass.  Giving it a slap as he pulled out.<br />
<br />
Breathing deeply, and sweating like fountains the two men collapsed in the chairs, after first pulling up with pants to make themselves a bit more presentable.<br />
<br />
“I think we liked the haircuts sir.” <br />
<br />
“I still have to get to work.” The big bodybuilder said getting up from his chair.  He picked up the dry cleaning that had changed to men’s clothes in the mean time. “You’ve been so helpful sir but would you mind if I changed in your bathroom.  It would save me time from having to go back to our place to do it.”<br />
<br />
“Go right ahead.” The Barber said brushing off the chair.<br />
<br />
The two men walked to the back of the store. “Aww shit.  Nakia, do me a favor and stand out there.  The room’s too small for me.  I won’t be able to close the door.”<br />
<br />
“Sure.  Hand me your work out cloths and I’ll take them back to our place and throw them in the wash.”<br />
<br />
“Here you go.” A huge hand reached out from the men’s room and handed the man now knows as Nakia a ridiculously small clump of black clothes. <br />
<br />
“Man are these rank, Djimon.’<br />
<br />
“Should have thought of that before you decided to fuck this ass while I was wearing them.”<br />
<br />
“I think we both know you decided for us whose ass was going to get fucked with talk of Toby’s mother.  Almost couldn’t get it hard again after that.” Nakia said holding them up to his nose. “Just the image of that skanky bitch’s….. christ.”<br />
<br />
“How is it that two fine queers like us both experimented with the whole hetero thing just one time and with just the same woman?  And then kept running into her responding to call after call, bust after bust?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. Djimon.  Life has a strange way of leading down roads we never expect but have to travel.  In a way I’m glad we did since it brought Toby to our attention.  We might not be able to prove either of us are the child’s natural fathers but…. We’ve got to get the child away from her.” Nakia said continuing to sniff his lover’s sweaty cloths  “We should bottle this scent man.  Who the fuck smells like spices when they sweat during sex?”<br />
<br />
“Ain’t no body going to be bottling my sex sweat anytime soon so, let’s not count on that happening.” The man know known as Djimon. said. “I was joking though man but, do you want to do it?  Do you want to tell his mother when she comes for him tonight while I’m of duty?  Of our custody plans?”<br />
<br />
“I she even comes to pick him up, yea I’ll do it.  You know how it is though.  He might be left at our place for a few extras days anyway.  If she doesn’t show, I’ll call social services and start the ball rolling.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not going to be easy man.” The body builder said exiting the small bathroom.  His police officers uniform perfectly fit him.  Not the tight work out cloths from before but crisp and clean against his pumped up build.  Certainly there was no way to hide the build under the clothes but, thanks to the uniform, gave his presence even more of an authoritarian feeling.  No one was going to mess with this man, no one was ever going to give him a second of shit.  The police force knew it, and every druggie and crook he came up against knew it too.  <br />
<br />
“I know.  We’ll have to come out at the precinct.  I know some of the guys suspect but no one really ‘knows’.  If we can’t work something out with our schedules I might have to stop these undercover assignments and switch to a desk job.  But shit man, we have to make any sacrifice we can.  That child…. We just have to.  Since he’s come into our lives, he IS our life.”<br />
<br />
“Odds are not the best but look.  We might be two faggots with questionable parentage connections to the boy but, we’ve done more for him than anyone else ever will.  We’re both mature men with steady jobs PLUS honored by the force time after time.  We make a good living and can provide for him in ways him Mother never will.”<br />
<br />
“It might mean cutting down on the impromptu sex in storefronts.” The Barber said intrusting them<br />
<br />
“If that’s what it takes. “ Nakia said pulling out of the embrace he had joined with Djimon.<br />
<br />
“Hey man, I don’t know about you, but I’m just planning on being a father, not a eunuch.”<br />
<br />
With a sudden burst of energy the child Toby ran back into the room and stood silently for a second, and ice cream cone dripping from his hand.<br />
<br />
“What the…”<br />
<br />
“Child how is that ice cream you got?  Gonna have to change that shirt when we get home.” Nakia said walking up to the boy and trying to whip his mouth.  Toby took a step back, puzzled by the two men he never saw before yet, for some reason, he knew very well.  “What’s the matter boy?”<br />
<br />
“It must be the haircuts gentlemen.” The Barber said moving over to the child and touching his shoulder.  “Toby, your father’s might look a little different than when you left but I assure you, they the loving and kind men you always wanted them to be.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you mean, always have been?” Djimon said walking over to Toby and picking him up. “Don’t get that ice cream on the uniform kid.”<br />
<br />
“I won’t Daddy.”<br />
<br />
“Good boy.  Sir” he said turning to the Barber.  “ I want to thank you for all your help today.  You’ve certainly got this family’s business for life.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve rarely been more pleased with the services I offer here at the shop.”<br />
<br />
The two giant men walked out the door with the small child between them.  Each taking a quick lick of the ice cream cone offered them.  Having turned two ignorant undercover policemen into college teens a while back, the Barber had balanced things out by returning two upstanding officers to the force.  And while, again, appearances might tell otherwise, he had created a family for the child he would never have had a chance at before.  Two loving parents, willing to do what ever it took and sacrifice everything for the good of the child.  Wrapped up with the fact that they were two hard edged mother fuckers who would let nothing stop them, Toby was set for a much better life.</p>
