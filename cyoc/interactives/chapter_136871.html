<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lynne sighed as she gazed out the window. The town still looked the same, it amazed her that traveling more than 14 years and this place still looked the same. “No wonder I’m bored,” she thought. “This place is like the town that time forgot. Can’t believe my family all loves this place.”<br />
<br />
“You doing okay Lynne,” Tricia asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Lynne sighed. “Just amazes me this place looks exactly the same as it does in our time. Makes me wonder why Aunt Ann decided to move back here to start a business. I can’t wait to move out of here.”<br />
<br />
“This place has its charm,” Tommy smirked. “At least that’s what my dad says and he traveled all over the world before he left the Marines. Heck even my mom loves this place and she’s done fashion shows in France.”<br />
<br />
“Well Your dad was on the battlefield,” Lynne smirked. “And well your mom was all over the world before she finally settled down so don’t know how much it counts.”<br />
<br />
“What about my folks,” Tricia added. “I mean my dad pitches for the Yankees. He could easily live in New York yet he wants his family here.”<br />
<br />
“Well,” Lynne said sheepishly. “I mean your mom has all her friends and family here. She hates big cities.”<br />
<br />
“She does,” Tricia said softly. “But she also had to deal with the fact that when she cane home she was 21 and pregnant. Do you have any idea how embarrassed she was yet this town loved and accepted her. It may not be a big city but it has a big heart.”<br />
<br />
Lynne groaned, Tricia, per usual, was right. “How is it I’m older but your wiser,” she smirked.<br />
<br />
“Luck I guess,” Tricia smiled.<br />
<br />
As they turned onto their street Tommy slowed down. The three teens were amazed that despite going back to before Lynne and Tricia were even born, the street looked the same. Some homes were different colors but it was completely the same. “Man this is eerie,” Tommy whispered. “Looking around, it’s like we never left.”<br />
<br />
As the scanned the street they could see all the homes save one had their lights off. “Guess Katie is still up,” Lynne said. “Tommy park a little ways away and will go over there.” Tommy nodded as he pulled the car over, flicking off the lights. “Okay So now what?” He asked.<br />
<br />
“Trish,” Lynne asked. “Think you can work a little bit of your magic to make sneaking up there a little easier?”<br />
<br />
Tricia nodded as she now mumbled a few words. A glow covered the teens and the car. “Okay done,” she said. “We’re invisble So we shouldn’t be spotted. I hope.”<br />
<br />
“You think they’ll notice us,” Tommy asked. Tricia rubbed her chin thoughtfully as she gazed towards Katie’s. “Maybe,” she said. “I mean Katie literally wrote the book on the spells we use so she might see us.”<br />
<br />
“Just hope it’s not Aunt Mika or Aunt Claudia,” Tommy shivered. “Those two are the last ones I want to make angry.”<br />
<br />
As the teens slowly crept towards Katie’s front door they could see movement inside. Peaking through the window they could see the college age group of friends playing drinking games inside. The group so far seemed unaware of the teens presence. Tricia gasped as she saw her parents sitting on the couch together. As she watched them she noticed her mother take a sip of the beer in her hand.<br />
<br />
“Wait why is mom drinking,” Tricia mused. Slowly her eyes widened as she turned quickly towards Lynne. “Lynne you idiot,” she hissed. “I haven’t been conceived yet.”<br />
<br />
“No that’s impossible,” Lynne said defensively. “The spell wouldn’t of worked if that was the case. We could only come here if all three of us existed in some form or another. That’s why Tommy’s sister had to stay behind.”<br />
<br />
Tricia looked back anxiously as she saw Samantha and Mike laugh happily before giving each other a kiss. “Then they don’t even know yet,” she said with concern. “Ugh this is not good. If my folks see me it’s going to ruin their night.”<br />
<br />
Lynne looked over at her friend, seeing how distraught she was. She had not intended to make her best friend this uncomfortable. “Trish,” she said softly. “This....this will actually be a good thing.”<br />
<br />
“How,” Trisha moaned, tears beginning to well in her eyes. “My parents are about to find out their preganant and I’ll ruin their life.”<br />
<br />
“No,” Lynne yelled. “No Trica you didn’t ruin their life, now you listen and listen well. Your parents, Yeah their lives are about to change, but...when they meet you and get to know you their going’s to find out what a great person you are. Your my best friend Tricia, we’ve know each other since we were infants. No one and I mean NO ONE would ever say you ruined anything.”<br />
<br />
Tricia smiled sadly as she now wiped her eyes. “Thanks Lynne,” she whispered as she now hugged her friend. As the girls embraced they could hear someone opening the front door. Gasping the teens now tried to remain quiet.<br />
<br />
“Who’s there,” Mary Elise called.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise gazed at the winters front lawn in front of her. She could of sworn she had heard something outside. Narrowing her eyes she looked at the freshly fallen snow. As she did she noticed three sets of footprints leading across the lawn, ending on the front porch.<br />
<br />
Mary Elise reached for her pendant touching it as she screamed. “Reveal.”<br />
<br />
“Shit,” Tommy muttered as the spell concealing themselves dissipated. The three teens now stared slack jawed at Mary Elise. “Ummmm, hi Vice Principal Kane.”<br />
<br />
“Katie,” Mary Elise called. “Everyone! Come out here NOW!”<br />
<br />
Lynne cursed herself silently as the others piled onto the front porch. “Damn it this isn’t how I wanted to meet,” she thought. “And I sure as hell don’t want to use my magic on any of them. Chances are they may not even be affected by any of our magic. Guess I need to turn on the charm.”<br />
<br />
As the college students now glared at the group of teens Lynne slowly stood, stepping forward in front of her friends. “Please,” she said calmly. “We...we don’t mean any harm. We just wanted to talk with you that’s all.”<br />
<br />
“Who are you,” Katie asked, “Talk because right now you three picked the wrong house to mess around with.”<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Lynne said quietly. “We’ll talk Katie, I just need you all to relax I don’t mean anyone any harm.”<br />
<br />
“Wait,” Kellie said quietly. “How do you know her name?”<br />
<br />
It had finally come to this, Lynne sighed heavily as she stepped forward holding her hand out. “Hi Katie,” she said. “My names Lynne Turner. I’m your sister.”</p>
