<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The trip back home was much faster with Mark riding atop his brother Paul, who was now a draft horse. Within a day, they arrived home. The sun was setting, and Mark dismounted his brother, glad to be back. His parents and brother came out to meet them, marvelling at the strong, sturdy draft horse that Paul had become. Mother had tears in her eyes, this was going to take some getting used to. Father checked his son&#39;s teeth, and inspected his son like he would any animal. Then when he was satisfied, he petted his son on the side. &quot;Good boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The sun lowered behind the hills. and it was then that something went very wrong. The horse whinneyed and fidgeted as he was brought to the barn, and suddenly fell on his side, struggling wildly on the ground - legs flailing about. Father backed away, in order not to get kicked by his son; he knew such a blow would easily be fatal to him. &quot;Paul! What&#39;s wrong, my boy? Paul!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing the commotion, the whole family came running to join their father, watching helpessly as Paul struggled helplessly on the grass. Then slowly something started happening to the large draft-horse. One hoof changed... reshaping itself slowly.... it started looking like a foot. Then one ear started squatting flat to the horse&#39;s head, losing its point and rounding out, looking strangely like a human ear. Then it happened to one hand, an eye... the horse&#39;s tail started shrinking smaller, and its torso began losing mass and shrinking.<br />
<br />
It was the strangest thing, watching what was a draft horse slowly regaining its original human form, part by piece. The had started growwing less elongated, mane receding, patches of fur receding in various places. It&#39;s belly shief disappeared and a horse-sized fully hard cock flopped about, looking more human by the second. It whinnied and whined, and when it was more human than horse, it started spurting cum all over the place. Paul&#39;s changes accellerated, mostly human face now, mostly human hands and feet... he couldn&#39;t stop himself from crying out, as he continued to shoot out cum in all directions, his still-large cock flailing about like it had a mind of its own.<br />
<br />
The whole family put their arms up, backing quickly away to try to spare themselves being hit by horse semen, looking confused why Paul kept crying out.<br />
<br />
Finally, Paul stopped. His transformation back to human was complete. His chest went up and down like a drum, rhytmic, while he regained his breath. &quot;Oh my god,&quot; was all he could say weakly.<br />
Finally, Paul stopped. His transformation back to human was complete. His chest went up and down like a drum, rhytmic, while he regained his breath. &quot;Oh my god,&quot; was all he could say weakly.<br />
<br />
Mother was the first at his side, wiping cum away, and covering him with her shawl. &quot;Oh my boy, oh my boy, are you okay my little Paul?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Paul answered between breaths, now beet read and clearly embarrassed by his show.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Mark wanted to know.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, &quot;Paul answered weakly.<br />
<br />
Paul got even redder. &quot;I...&quot; He hesitated, not understanding what happened. &quot;...don&#39;t know,&quot; He finished weakly.<br />
<br />
Mother helped Paul to the barn and Father hosed him off. Mother made a fuss of it, drying him with a clean cloth. Paul was beet red the whole time, then suddenly an apparition appeared - it was the form of the Madame Illusia floatin in mid air before the family. &quot;Hello dear family. I met your son earlier, with his most noble request to help you,&quot; the Madame explained. &quot;Because of his noble request, I could not leave him changed forever. So I took mercy on him, and made it so that he will be a were-horse of sorts. During the daylight hours, Paul will take the form of a draft horse, allowing you to keep your farm and prosper. But when the sun goes down, Paul will return to his human form for the night, so that he need not be imprisoned in the body of a beast forever and always, but still have the life of the fine young man that he is. Just be warned, the changes will happen every sundown and sunrise - so always be prepared, lest anything unfortunate befall anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But -&quot; Paul started to protest, to no avail as the form of the Madame Illusia evaporated in mid-air after her decree of mercy, like a mirage in summer heat. Paul&#39;s parents were hugging him, happy that they would still have time with their son. It didn&#39;t go unnoticed by his brothers that Paul seemed strangely and disturbingly disappointed by this turn of events, and even troubled.<br />
That night, Pauls parents and brothers rejoiced - they would be able to keep the farm ad prosper thanks to Paul. As the last embers of the fire crackled in the fire place, and family filed out one by one to retire to their beds, it was only Mark that remained with Paul, silent and pensive. After what seemed like a very long time, Mark spoke quietly to Paul. &quot;You were disappointed. You were actually disappointed that you changed back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul squirmed a little in his seat. It was true, he had always had a fantasy of unwillingly being forced into the form of a draft horse. It was his family&#39;s unfortunate circumstances that gave him the in he needed to see that fantasy come true, while at the same time helping them to survive. They both sat quietly for a time.<br />
I didn&#39;t want any of this I was ready to give up on being a human however madame saw fit to give me a second chance. <br />
I was thinking about Anne recently tho, do you think she will like me with this horse cock now? <br />
Good luck actually convincing her to have sex with you as a horse,you might get a hand job from her as a horse and not much else. <br />
Maybe she&#39;ll want to be my mare? <br />
Not many people want to spend their days  down on all fours copping all day. <br />
Is that all you think I do as a horse? <br />
Yes! You can pull objects you can carry people and you can get horny! Thanks God madame actually made you turn back during the day, you couldn&#39;t even grab anything for the rest of your life with those hooves of yours. <br />
You&#39;d be surprised how good they feel. <br />
Oh and now you&#39;re defending inflexible keratin blocks that you can&#39;t feel anything through. <br />
They&#39;re hooves and I can feel pressure through them which tells me what kind of ground I&#39;m walking on. <br />
OK yeah, sure go to sleep you beast, you&#39;re not even happy about keeping your hands madame shouldn&#39;t even bothered. <br />
Nah, I like my hands, however not as much as my hooves. <br />
He went to sleep that night and started dreaming about riding Anne very vividly, however as he woke up his transformation started and right before his hands were fused in his hooves he managed to jack off at the thought of having her in-between his hooved legs.</p>
