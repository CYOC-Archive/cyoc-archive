<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin as usual went to his locker at the front of the school to retrieve his backpack, where he kept it so as to avoid dragging something to and from school that was excessively heavy. But today it seemed like his heavy backpack, loaded with books, was surprisingly light to him. He started wondering what was really going on here. He doubted it was just a growth spurt. It was all wrong. He bumped into a few lockers due to misjudging where his shoulders ended and how his arms would swing. He swore he&#39;d never been this clumsy before...something was wrong with his damn body!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Dusty, you&#39;re uh...looking a bit scruffy there.&quot; One of his teammates said, seeming a bit weirded out.<br />
<br />
Dustin gulped and wondered - if this was something strange going on it seemed everyone around him could notice it, but his family? Nope, nothing going wrong there! &quot;I uh...just need to shave. I&#39;ll take care of that after school today...&quot; And with that Dustin was off, moving to class...but then he saw his girlfriend, his body reacting immediately with excitement and a blush.<br />
<br />
Dana, his girlfriend, was the perfect cheerleader, tall, blond, perky, bubbly and despite her attitude more intelligent than she seemed. The tight body was also a perk to dating a cheerleader. She was everything Dustin loved in women...<br />
<br />
And as she approached him, she looked him up and down, asking, &quot;Have you like, been working out more than usual? Because I think you might be even bigger, Dusty-Dusty!&quot; She felt up his arms and pinched at his chest, and Dustin let out a small exhalation as he enjoyed the feeling of his girlfriend touching his body. His misgivings about his changes were mostly gone at this point. He loved it that she seemed to like his body, even or especially with the changes that happened.<br />
<br />
He knew the class he was going to well enough, and so when Dana started kissing him, before long Dustin had his mouth on hers and the two were vigorously making out in the hallway. Dana had her hand up Dustin&#39;s shirt, feeling his muscles, while Dustin had a hand on her right breast, feeling the perky C cups and moaning as he felt her grind up against his groin. Thankfully few people were around, most headed off to class. The few that did come by just sighed and went on, not wanting to interrupt the popular football player&#39;s make out time.<br />
<br />
But it was Dustin who ultimately interrupted it when he discovered he increasingly had to kneel down to try and continue the make out. His cock was getting too big in his jeans, swelling with two inches more size than he knew it had. He felt an itch on his face that told him his face was getting scruffier, his body illfitting against his shirt as his shoulders swelled with strength, matched by his pecs, his abs pushing out some more and deepening to a full on eight pack.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t want his girlfriend above all other people freaking out over this so he looked around and managed to put a stop to it, &quot;Uhh Dana it sounds like the security people are doing their route! I uh...really gotta go...&quot; Is that my voice? He thought, it sounds a bit deeper.<br />
<br />
Thankfully she bought it and broke off, and shouted back to him as she headed off, &quot;I really wanna continue that some time soon, Dustin! You feel so big and...muscly!&quot; That didn&#39;t bring Dustin as much joy as he thought it would, and he hurriedly took out a hat from his backpack just in case, as well as swinging back by his locker for a jacket to cover up his more visible changes. With that he was on his way to class, and hopefully not be discovered for the changes that happened to him.<br />
<br />
Apparently as he got to class nobody really thought twice, though the teacher made a token effort of scolding the football player. Everybody however knew that these measures didn&#39;t really amount to much due to their celebrity. Sometimes Dustin felt bad taking advantage of that, other times like this he needed every bit of advantage he could scrape together. He didn&#39;t like going around in this jacket in this kind of heat - he&#39;d rather be in a tank top - but the less scrutiny he attracted the better.<br />
<br />
He took out a notebook to follow along with what he could gather from the English lesson, at first just taking notes on some of the things observed from last night&#39;s reading homework, but then drifting off into other observations. Namely, about his changes so far. He found an empty page and picked up a pen to write. He thought about what to do from here. Maybe it&#39;d help him out some if he wrote down some ideas and thoughts on his observations.<br />
<br />
&#39;I...am changing&#39;, he wrote, though he winced at how vague it was.<br />
&#39;I am changing and growing too fast.&#39; Better, he told himself. &#39;I&#39;m growing bigger and...older? I don&#39;t know what&#39;s really going on here, but I think everybody is aware I&#39;m different now.&#39;<br />
&#39;How can I stop people from noticing the changes?&#39;<br />
&#39;Cover up, of course.&#39;<br />
&#39;What&#39;s the end point of all this?&#39;<br />
&#39;What is it doing to me?&#39;<br />
&#39;It does feel pretty good so far...&#39;<br />
&#39;Do I want it to stop?&#39;</p>
