<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Opening the box, Alex failed to see that written on the side in black permanent ink was the words, &quot;Clothes - Female - Age Eleven(?) - Store Bought (With Tags Still on Them) - Unworn - Spring Clothes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Opening the box, he groaned in disappointment as he pulled a pair of pink canvas high tops out. Under the shoes where several pants, shirts, training bras, socks and about three packages of unopened girl's underwear. &quot;Great,&quot; Alex thought to himself. &quot;I had to go and steal a box full of girl's clothing. Just perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holding up a pair of pants, Alex looked at the rolled up pants legs, noted that they where sewn like this and thought, &quot;Well it's better then running around naked. Can't wait to see what Uncle Joseph and Aunt Clara say when I show up wearing girl's clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not liking the idea of wearing what he'd found, Alex skipped the underwear and instead choose to start with the pants; the very same pair he was holding. As he buttoned up the front, Alex noted that there was something stitched into the right leg and after staring at it for a couple of seconds, he realized that it was supposed to look like a couple of red, blue and yellow butterflies flying amongst a couple of red flowers.<br />
<br />
Self conscience about what he's wearing, not liking the fact he's not wearing any underwear, Alex reached down and grabbed a white shirt with a picture of a Hibiscus on the front. At the same time, he pulled from the box a pair of socks and sitting down on the ground he begins to pull them on. Next to be put on is the pink canvas shoes and after that is the white shirt.<br />
<br />
Looking down into the box, Alex sees a pink backpack lying in amongst the clothes. As he reaches down to pick it up, two things happen. The first is the locket he's wearing swings gently forward and comes in contact with the shirt and the second is he notices for the first time the tags hanging off the shirt, pants, which only come down just past his knees, and socks. Picking up the the backpack, he starts to dump the rest of the clothes into it. When he's done with that he stands up, locket thumping against his chest, and looking at the tags, begins to pull them off.<br />
<br />
Wondering how this day could get any stranger, Alex shrugs the backpack on and begins to hike once again through the woods. As he does so, he is completely unaware of the changes that are occurring. Normally standing sixty eight inches tall and weighing a hundred and forty pounds, he drops down to a height of fifty two inches and his weight shifts down about to seventy pounds.<br />
<br />
As this happens, his skin becomes softer and as his face and body start to take on a more feminine appearance, while what little muscle he does have melts away as his frame shifts to that of a girl just entering puberty. Next his hair turned a soft brown color and began to grow down past his shoulders. The only time that he really noticed anything, but not enough to cause him to pause, was a pinching sensation felt on his ears as two holes formed and an odd sensation to his chest as it began to expand into an petite, but pert A cup.<br />
<br />
What really almost brought him to halt was when he suddenly noticed he couldn't see straight. Removing his glasses, Alex blinks and realizing he can see better without them, he thinks, &quot;Odd,&quot; all without changing his pace.<br />
<br />
Around him, the air changed from a cool autumn to a mild spring. As the changes in seasons took effect, Alex's penis and testicles started to shrink. As his privates shrank and then folded up into is body, the reproductive organs suitable for a girl began to form just as the area between his legs split and the vulva began to form.<br />
<br />
Unaware and completely mesmerized on how suddenly everything around him, now her, looked like spring, Alex failed to notice as any body hair she'd had a one time just melted away. A brief pulling sensation in her hair made Alex think she'd gotten it caught on something, and this almost made him stop, but just as quickly as it started, the sensation passed.<br />
<br />
What it was was her hair being gently pulled back into a scrunchie as her soft brown hair was tied up as a braid. Spying her Aunt and Uncle's farm house, she absently rubbed a small, feminine hand against her chest, noting how sensitive her breast where. Bothered by all this and thinking, &quot;I really need to change my clothes before my mom and dad see me dressed like this,&quot; Alex started to hurry across the lawn and toward the rambling old farm house.<br />
<br />
She breathed a sigh of relief when she noted that their car wasn't in the driveway and letting herself in, Alex called out, &quot;Mom? Dad? I'm home,&quot; and paused as she suddenly realizes how soft and feminine her voice is.<br />
<br />
Clearing her thought, Alex thinks, &quot;Must be coming down with something,&quot; as she starts up to her room.<br />
<br />
Opening her door, Alex paused when she sees that her room has undergone a transformation as well. Where it was simple before, with just a bed and dresser with a couple of posters of wrestling Divas, Alex now sees a room painted bright white, a bed that is covered in stuffed animals and some rather bright and feminine sheets and comforters. The dresser is also bright white, while the posters have been replaced with several images of boy bands, a couple of punk bands and some guys, something that disturbs her when she thinks that they're cute.<br />
<br />
Closing the door wondering what her Mom and Dad have done to her room, she suddenly realizes that she no longer thinks of them as her Aunt and Uncle. &quot;Rather my mom and dad,&quot; Alex thinks to herself as she realizes how she addressed them when she got home and thought about them when standing outside.<br />
<br />
Wandering down the hall, Alex opens several other doors, only to find the bathroom, a guest room and her parents bedroom. Heading back to her room she opens the door and steps in.<br />
<br />
Something inside her tells her that she's happy here, safe even and should be comfortable because it's her room. Sighing, she drops the backpack on the floor, missing the thumping noise it makes as it hits the floor, and instead begins to look around.<br />
<br />
Her search is cut abruptly short when she's sees someone else standing in the room. Alex immediately begins to mumble an apology when she stops and notices that it's nothing but a reflection from a mirror. Looking at herself, seeing her eleven year old self, Alex asks herself, &quot;What the heck is going on here? When does putting on girl's clothes turn you into an eleven year old female?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lifting her shirt, she stares at the two orbs that have started to form. Not paying any attention to the locket, she drops her shirt back down, notes the earrings hanging from her ears, the way her hair suddenly looks and instead grabs her crotch. Not feeling the familiar bulge confirmed to her that she was indeed female, Alex once again asked herself, &quot;What the heck is going on here,&quot; as she sat down onto the bed, hugging a stuffed animal to her sore and sensitive chest.</p>
