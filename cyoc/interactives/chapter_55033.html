<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan stood to the side while the incredible, burly fratboys vied for his affections. He'd never heard of an Alpha Swagger competition before, so he had been curious what the event would entail. Apparently, each contestant would have to strut out to the middle of the stage, give a flex, then a growl and roar. The judges would decide who had more of the almost indefinable &quot;swagger&quot; trait that helped made alpha bears seem so aggressive and dominant.<br />
<br />
Jett went first. He cockily strutted up, went into a double bicep and gave a fair growl and roar. It was all right, but it was clear he hadn't practiced or put any real effort into it. The audience hissed again and he walked back to his position with his ego slightly deflated.<br />
<br />
James was up next, looking more naturally rugged and dominant than Jett, in part thanks to his larger size and more masculine features. His growl and roar sent a shiver through Dan's spine. This boy was a beast!<br />
<br />
Dan was also starting to notice something amazing going on with the Omega Delta Nu boys. It seemed his thought that their growth spurts could be stimulated by situations that would test their alpha nature was correct. Every time one of the other contestants would come up to give his strut, either Gabe, Patrick or Adrian would swell up in some place to make them more majestically massive than before! Adrian's arms didn't need to swell any more, but that's exactly what they did as Mario marched up. Andrew spurred Patrick to grow taller. <br />
<br />
Finally it was Gabe's turn to walk up. He towered over the other contestants, except for Magnus, and his footsteps made the stage shake. His package in his leather shorts looked dangerously full and his massive gut (all of the Omega Delta Nus looked like they were measuring close to or over 100 inches in that department by this point)quaked with each forward thrust of his torso. He got to the middle of the stage and gave a resounding growl and roar that shook Dan so hard his 12&quot; fully hard prick was testing the strength of his jockstrap!<br />
<br />
Mike and Andrew were next, and although they were handsome and manly, they just didn't quite have the mass to impress the judges or Dan. These would be hypermasculine brutes in the world Dan used to know, but here they were merely garden variety cute boys. Coming to that realization gave Dan's cock a jolt and smeared some precum into the jock's absorbent material.<br />
<br />
Adrian was next and it seemed the last two displays had increased his height dramatically, making him the tallest Omega Delta Nu, and close to Magnus' height! He looked and felt like Bigfoot as he strutted up the stage, his package and belly bouncing and his chest feeling like the leather harness was a size too small to cage his massive chest muscles! He growled and roared like a grizzly and forced a gasp and a small surge of precum out of Dan, visibly causing a dark spot in his jock. His effect on Dan was not lost on the massive bear and he smirked as he went back to his place.<br />
<br />
Magnus was next, and although he had more mass than pretty much everyone in the contest, he trembled at the thought of being exposed in front of so many people. He timidly made his way up, bloated muscles bouncing at the slightest movement in his loping gait, and turned to face the crowd once he was at his spot. He nearly froze when he saw how many people were in front of him. He felt naked and like he was being scrutinized by every person present, which wasn't far from the truth. He tried to give a flex, growl and roar, and although his flex was impressive, he couldn't muster more than a mewl! He hurriedly left the stage, flushed and embarrassed, although saying to himself that he wouldn't give up. He was too smitten with Dan to just roll over and die!<br />
<br />
Jonathan was next and after Magnus' turn, it was clear that he didn't have the body or attitude to win it. The glitter was definitely a turn-off, a choice that bordered on a train wreck as far as Dan was concerned. The lukewarm response from the crowd seemed to drive home the point to the bear, as well, as he was seen trying to rub it off on the way back to his place in the lineup.<br />
<br />
Dan was slightly disappointed by Magnus' display. Although the guy was the hugest and most handsome of the bears on display, he just wasn't showing the attitude he wished he would. He'd been so fixed on watching the Nordic god that he had forgotten to look at Patrick, who was the last to go in this round. When he finally heard Patrick's name announced, the looked over and his jaw nearly dropped. The growth spurts were definitely doing wonders for that guy.<br />
<br />
Patrick was now taller and as massive as Magnus! He smirked as he strutted out to the stage. Dan wasn't sure the stage could handle much more men of Patrick's size stomping around on it! His gut was clearly well over 100 inches by now and his chest wasn't far behind! His torso and legs were gigantic and covered in generous portions of Patrick's natural swirling, crimson hair. The kilt seemed even smaller on the giant now, a sliver of fabric putting up a pathetic fight against the onslaught of bulging flesh around it. His dick swayed half-hard beneath it, leaking a bit of pre onto his quaking quads.<br />
<br />
As Patrick finally reached his position in the middle of the stage, Dan noticed the most glaring transformation the bear had gone through. The hair on his head had been dense, but short, and his beard was nice and bushy, but now... Both the hair on his head and growing off of his masculine face were braided in an even hotter pattern than Magnus'! Patrick's hair was now so long it nearly reached his waist! As Patrick adjusted his stance, he went into a most-muscular that shocked everyone, Dan included! His muscles bulged out even more freakishly than at rest! His growl sounded like a piece of heavy machinery at work and his roar was a deafening crescendo that echoed long after it escaped his thick throat. The affable bear had transitioned into a fearsome Celtic warrior and the effect was as powerful as Patrick's new body!<br />
<br />
Everyone in the audience was too stunned to applaud and Dan's cock had had enough and couldn't keep itself from cumming in the jock, soaking the material through and through with his thick load. The judges barely had to confer amongst themselves to announce that Patrick was the winner in the Alpha Swagger event. Coming up were the Gut Size, Genital Size and Armwrestling events. Dan was grateful his boosted genitals came with bigger balls and a higher sex drive. If he was going to cum at the climax of every competition, he was going to have a very, very busy day ahead of him!</p>
