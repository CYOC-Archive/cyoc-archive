<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay looked at his screen, confused. Jeff&#39;s tab was open and he was sure he&#39;d done something, but he just couldn&#39;t seem to notice it. Jeff had been freaking out about his udder and he felt satisfied, but looking over the udder now, it was the one Jeff had all his life. Weirder yet, the Chronivac refused to let him modify Jeff&#39;s udder, and it even said it was locked.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the rest of Jeff was modifiable and Jay wanted to see what this thing could do. Why not have some fun?<br />
———<br />
<br />
That was, until Jay thought more and more as to why Jeff was trying to modify his udder. It was like as if he was trying to get rid of his udders...<br />
<br />
&quot;But then, why would...&quot;<br />
<br />
 He realizes at that moment, He figured out what&#39;s going on! Which explains why he can&#39;t remember all the details... Jeff may actually have a Chronivac of his own and he&#39;s trying to remove his udder without Jay&#39;s knowledge or awareness! <br />
Well you too can play this game!<br />
<br />
<br />
Instead of him just having his udder for a month; Jeff is going to slowly become more and more of an Anthro Cow (He can stay as a male cow for now, unless of course, if Jeff tries to mess with his brain, he could change his mind on that idea).<br />
<br />
So with that in mind; Before Jay lets Jeff continues to change himself, Jay makes the udders that he gave him a part of him, and Jeff thinks he always had it all his life [including they’re Mom and Dad]. Meanwhile everyone else [Jay included] is fully aware of that change.<br />
<br />
Of course, Jeff won&#39;t be aware of what&#39;s going on until about a week, when he starts growing more cow parts. Slowly bit by bit, he won&#39;t be able to hide his transformation. Once the month is over he&#39;ll be a fully realized Anthropomorphic Cow. He&#39;ll be lucky if he stays as a male through out the month [despite him having an udder].<br />
<br />
&#39;This will be an interesting month!&#39;<br />
<br />
Once Jay finishes his command, he lets Jeff do what he wants with his own udder altercation.<br />
<br />
He just sits there giggling to himself. &quot;I&#39;m going enjoy seeing his reaction to his next cow part involving his transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that Jeff will be blissfully unaware of his predicament. Until next week, where he will act like what he was earlier and by that time he&#39;ll grow a new part.<br />
<br />
===<br />
<br />
<br />
Jeff is in panic mode.<br />
<br />
Everything he does is not working! It&#39;s still locked!<br />
<br />
And his udder is pulsating, which adds to his ever growing anxiety!<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on! I can&#39;t have two udders at the same time right now!&quot; In his mind, he is trying to think through who could be doing this to him?<br />
And why?<br />
<br />
But then; one dark thought lurked into his mind like a snake bite venom.<br />
<br />
&#39;Could Jay be the one that&#39;s doing this to me? But I...&#39;<br />
<br />
Thinking about it further, all the times he teased him, mocked him. There&#39;s no doubt about it! It&#39;s him! He needs to talk to Jay about this right now!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God! That stupid little pipsqueak! No wonder his reaction was suspicious! I&#39;m going to give that dork a piece of mind and then I&#39;ll teach that brat a less-!...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
And as soon as Jeff got out of his chair, he’s carrying that heavy load of an udder of his. It took a lot out of him just to carry that damn thing! Even with him holding a bigger udder in his hands, and feeling all the nerves of it, and even feeling his own hands touching them, he still can&#39;t believe that even now it is actually a part of his body, despite *him* still being a male.<br />
<br />
*Whew!* &quot;And then I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll... I?...&quot;<br />
&#39;What&#39;s going on?! What&#39;s happening to my head?!?&#39;<br />
<br />
<br />
As he let&#39;s go of his udder, letting it bounce slightly as it slowly rests over the crotch part of his pants, while also feeling the pressure of his udder there...<br />
Under different circumstances, Jeff would have been red as a tomato with him actually feeling all that heavy weight from his udder over his pants and is literally just touching his dick area.<br />
[That same udder that has literally grown out of his body out of nowhere and is now a part of his body.]<br />
It would be something that can make a guy squirm with shame and embarrassment...<br />
<br />
But right now, he is too preoccupied on what is happening inside his head.<br />
<br />
He held both of his hands up to both of his temples (on his head) to put pressure on it. His head isn&#39;t hurting per-say, but he is thinking so hard on what he was going to say next... But he keeps forgetting...<br />
<br />
&quot;I... Wha... I&#39;ll teach-... ah... I&#39;ll teach that brat that... ? Brat? What &#39;brat&#39;?... NO! No! I know what I&#39;m saying! I&#39;m saying that I&#39;ll...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
He then felt a shiver running up his spine as it reaches his head and into Jeff&#39;s mind, all those initial thoughts of confronting Jay and punishing him started to vanish.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll... I&#39;ll... Uh... I... ?...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
At that point, his thoughts on his next words are fading… vanishing...<br />
<br />
vanishing...<br />
<br />
<br />
And... gone!<br />
There is nothing left of that original thought... It&#39;s now empty...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh?...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
As he tried to keep himself talking but to no avail, he just lost his train of thought. No matter how many times he tries to say something to remind himself to continue, but it never came back to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh?... Duuuh?... huh?...&quot;<br />
Jeff blinks for a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;?&quot;<br />
[still nothing.]<br />
<br />
<br />
And now; like a dumb cow that he sorta is... He thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
&#39;Hang on? Why did I get up for again?&#39;<br />
<br />
Jeff is just standing there mindlessly holding his massive udder, wishing in his heart of hearts that he can get rid of that extra weight he just added to himself. Or at the very least; start it so he can get this temporary thing over with already!<br />
Then suddenly...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*BEEEEP*! *BEEEEP*!<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;MOO!&quot; Jeff gave a shriek, but it came out like a disgruntled cow.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It was his own Chronivac! It&#39;s letting him know he can change himself back now!<br />
<br />
It&#39;s Unlocked!<br />
<br />
And of course, his avatar is updated to have the udder that he always remembered having. Logically, Jeff just let&#39;s the timer runs its course; (he did set it to last only a minute after all) and then it started to reversed the changes that he made earlier. Making that second udder receding in of itself. Back to the way it was!<br />
<br />
Just big pink mass filled with nothing but milk with four nipples; Right on his belly, like a pregnant woman... Just like how he was. [Or what Jeff thinks of himself as normal. He never suspected a thing.]<br />
<br />
And then he sits on his bed, rubbing his udder with relief. &quot;Why did I even make that change? That was so weird, not to mention scary! Not being able to reverse it... I am never going do that again!&quot; He says that with declaration, as he lays down on the bed. With his udders facing up on top and his teats facing him.<br />
<br />
Jeff thought about it, how did a guy like him, be born with this udder, typically you would only see it on a cows (which are always female), the male equivalate of a cow is a bull, and bulls don&#39;t have udders. So for him feeling both his udder and his dick inside his pants, is such a big oddity!<br />
<br />
Even he will never make sense of this mystery... <br />
<br />
And as he kept rubbing his udder, he starts having these new thoughts flood his mind, that familiar sense of reassurance. He never thought of these things before until now. It&#39;s like he&#39;s being given these new thoughts and feelings like he always had them. He loves that feeling of his udder in his hands.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s making him smile... Subconsciously; He gave himself a very quiet and yet a very satisfied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moooo...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff did that without even thinking nor questioning about why he&#39;s doing it now.<br />
<br />
Instead of him having that disgusted panic attack like he was having earlier. He&#39;s now happy! He is as happy as a dumb cow...<br />
Then again, Jeff couldn&#39;t help but wonder...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What was I going to do before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did I try to give myself more than one udder?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did I get up from my chair for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what was I even thinking about before all this?!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
But no matter what he does, he can never remember why...<br />
[Well, not for right now at least...]<br />
<br />
But he would&#39;ve known why; If Jay hadn&#39;t step in and changed his mindset. And now he&#39;ll never know why until next week, and then Jeff will remember everything, but at that point he&#39;ll start having a new cow part on his body...</p>
