<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erika was really paranoid about what she had been doing with her doggy dick. She needed a release that didn&#39;t involve someone getting pregnant. She texted Cole inviting him to come around. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are a couple are we then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don&#39;t have a phobia over dicks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Normally I couldn&#39;t give a fuck but why is so pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no clue, are you here to chat or to fuck?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to experiment a bit, mix it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole started to unbuckle his pants when Erika indicated to the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doggie style.&quot; she indicated.<br />
<br />
&quot;i have a strap on I want to test.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Am I a bitch now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A new bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
She undid her school skirt, her penis was starting to create a tent deep inside her panties. Erika kept her top on, this was about losing her growing canine hard on in a way that wouldn&#39;t get anyone pregnant.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Put you ass in the air Cole, like a good dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole felt a strange urge to please Erika. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready?&#39;<br />
<br />
He found himself nodding his consent.<br />
<br />
She put her four inch long doggy cock into Cole&#39;s rectum with a male like groan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah!-oh...&quot; Cole moaned.<br />
<br />
It was weird he could feel the swell of her breasts on his back but the penis felt unusually realistic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...uh...what is that...a revenge dildo...&quot;<br />
<br />
Erika bit him on the neck, her canine teeth was the worst hickey of his life. He suddenly felt like he was being raped as Erika roared like a bull, shooting her wad into his rectum.  <br />
<br />
&quot;AH FUCK!&quot; she bellowed as more cum was ejaculated. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh...fuck...was... this...&quot; panted Cole<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you&quot; Erika panted.<br />
<br />
She had torn her top off and her breasts bounced with movement. Her C Cup breasts bounced and jiggled as she moved around. Despite being bitten and treated like he was a homo Cole felt himself get hard. He started having strange thoughts entering his head. Could he call himself the boyfriend of Erika? She seemed to be bi-sexual, but out of the boys at school she had only fucked him. An even stranger though entered his head. An idea of having children, not marriage and children but of having babies...where the fuck did that come from?<br />
<br />
By the time he came too Erika&#39;s penis has returned to a normal vagina, her breasts were encased in the lacy fabric of her bra and she was pulling on her skirt and school shirt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well that was fun, you can leave now.&quot;<br />
<br />
He felt oddly humiliated but he left. <br />
<br />
When he got home he collapsed into bed. His dreams were filled with dogs fucking and oddly he found that good, not a nightmare. Inside himself Erika had left a package she thought was inert, it wasn&#39;t. It found a host that was known to the Salve but not compatible to the new thing inside it. Cole&#39;s body tried to fight it but repeated exposure made it all too easy.<br />
<br />
When Cole woke up the next morning he started vomiting into the toilet. It was when his mother mentioned breakfast that he started filling his plate with bacon, eggs and pancakes. As he continued eating his formal school shirt started to expand as his belly pushed into it. At first he didn&#39;t notice until his shirt was pulled out of his slacks. Then he felt the tug on his shirt as his belly continued to grow, a button popped off, then a second and soon it ripped as his belly poked out in a dome.<br />
<br />
When he came to be full his stomach was resting in his lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; Cole and Melissa&#39;s mother seemed dazed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got  grandchild on the way, now my other daughter is expecting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! NO! I am your son Cole-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Collette I have told you that pretending that you aren&#39;t pregnant won&#39;t wish the baby away...&quot; <br />
<br />
Their mother started to clean up. <br />
<br />
Melissa was looking smug.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to ask yourself this question &#39;Collette&#39;, when you were fucking Erika who was the bitch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, no, I, I am not a bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon you&#39;ll be bigger than me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both their mother and Melissa had to take an arm each and help Collette onto his feet as he wobbled dangerous. They helped Collette into the shower, as he watched the water come from the shower head he watched his belly deflate slowly, he went from about 6 months pregnant to have a loose pudgy belly. As he was trying to squeeze into a new shirt he noticed that his nipples were bigger, darker and much much more sensitive than before. <br />
<br />
He went to school and ate a hearty lunch before a wave of sickness overcome him. He had to rush to the toilet and vomit up the contents of his lunch. He managed to make his way through the day. When he got come he was having dinner. Melissa was so big now that she had to sit side on or have a custom table in position. When their mother went to the toilet, Melissa pointed with her fork at Cole&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have pokies, big sis.&quot; she cackled like a witch.<br />
<br />
Cole looked down and his nipples were tenting into his shirt. He gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would accept more sympathy from you-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I am just enjoying myself. I had an ultrasound today, to see what my baby is going to be and here is the punch line: the ultrasound says that I am not pregnant.&quot; Cole dropped his spoon. &quot;That&#39;s right, I am not pregnant according to the machine.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that bombshell she reached out for the door with a grunt and left. Cole had to go outside and he stood in the cold night air, until his nipples started to hurt. Finding himself crying he went inside. He had his evening shower and he noticed that he was shedding hair like a fucking cat or animal. <br />
<br />
When he got to the room next to Melissa&#39;s she had some skin lotion.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is this for?&quot; he demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stretchmarks&quot; she said over her shoulder.<br />
<br />
The next morning Cole was vomiting into the toilet. Melissa knew what was happening, she also knew something that she had suspected all along, no dog had gotten her pregnant it was Erika. With their mother&#39;s credit card she started purchasing maternity wear for Cole. They looked like his normal clothes, as he was still in a state of denial. She was actually happy to be having Erika&#39;s baby. It was her job to make sure Collette had a seamless transition. <br />
<br />
Cole noticed that his ass had swelled to take the weight. Something was happening to hips as well, they were making it hard to keep his jeans on. He had his swollen belly to rely upon.  <br />
<br />
Melissa decided to move things up and one day replaced the milk for Cole&#39;s cereal with own breast milk.<br />
<br />
Cole could feel from deep within his bones that he was growing older. His shoulders were widening; his arms were getting heavier; and his legs were getting longer by the second. They were lean and slender at first, before fattening up around the thighs like the legs of a growing teenager. Tiny hairs were sprouting on them too.<br />
<br />
Cole smashed the bowl on the floor as he felt the magically induced growth spreading to the rest of his body. His hips were widening with the onset of womanhood. His arms were getting softer. Shoulders were becoming wider with more room to breathe. And his ribcage was expanding to accommodate a bigger heart. Yet it was smaller and subtler than the barrel chest of his father - this was decidedly a woman&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
Cole knew what the next change would be, and braced himself until he felt it - an electric tingling sensation behind each of his nipples, announcing the beginnings of breast growth. The feeling intensified, and Cole&#39;s mind rushed with excitement as his once-flat chest bubbled outward. His swollen chest pressed down comfortably on his still-expanding ribcage. And yes, he was going to have to get used to calling them breasts now.<br />
<br />
Stretch marks appeared then disappeared, leaving his chest as a flawless landscape of smooth pink, except for a patch of skin around each nipple, which darkened from red to a rich dark brown. The nipples themselves were swollen and stiff, and felt ever so tender. Cole couldn&#39;t help but grasp them in his hands. Big mistake - the tingling sensation came back, but ten times more intense, so it actually hurt to touch his breasts now. He pulled his hands away, noticing while he did so that that they too had changed. He hadn&#39;t seen them when they had been in the water, but they were much closer to adult size now, and they continued to grow in proportion with his legs and chest and hips. It seemed there was no part of him the transformation would not touch, but Cole knew there was something much more important that hadn&#39;t begun to change yet.<br />
<br />
He knew it was coming right from the start, but he was no less shocked by when it happened. His penis disappeared under his pants, retracting deep inside him to form a fleshy pocket with all the equipment needed to make a baby. Cole&#39;s heart skipped a beat. He felt as though something precious had been taken from him, but he knew deep down that he had given him something greater. So never again would he have to wonder how it felt to be pregnant - he would be experiencing it for real.<br />
<br />
His womb felt empty without something inside it. He rubbed his belly with both hands and waited for something to grow. Slowly at first, it was beginning to form, but the appearance of a bump was almost imperceptible. The stomach moved more from Colette&#39;s breathing. Then it began to rise steadily like a loaf of bread, or a steadily inflating beach ball - a quiet bubble of warmth for the tiny life inside him.<br />
<br />
All the while, her hips were growing too, and her butt was expanding into a soft round cushion. Her breasts reached their final size, and they were gorgeously big, all the better for the baby to suckle when it came out. Her butt finished growing a few seconds later, meaning her new feminine form was nearly complete. As a final flourish to the transformation, her child-bearing hips expanded to stellar proportions. And a smattering of frizzy hairs appeared in her nether regions.<br />
<br />
But the real miracle was not her body but of the thing growing inside it. The new life in her was formed, and for a few seconds longer his belly continued to grow, growing until it was bigger than his head, bigger than a soccer ball, and almost as big as his Melissa&#39;s belly. It pushed out the air from her lungs so that once again, she found herself short of breath..<br />
<br />
Then she knew then what his sister was doing, and she too rested her hand on her heavily pregnant belly. A few seconds later she felt it, a tiny thump coming from beneath his skin. It felt like nothing at all, but she knew it to be a baby kicking at him with its tiny little feet.<br />
<br />
For several minutes, the boy-turned-woman sat still in the water with his sister sharing their excitement at the start of a new life. Colette even thought she could feel the baby&#39;s heartbeat. The transformation had slowed to a standstill and every part of Cole&#39;s body was as big as it was going to get today. But, as her sister reminded him, a pregnant woman&#39;s body is always changing itself in some form or another. Not many boys would ever get to experience such a thing first-hand, but then again.<br />
<br />
After a while, she fidgeted and made motions to get out of the kitchen. Melissa helped her up, and for this she was grateful. Compared to before, Jaden was no longer light and nimble, and standing up wasn&#39;t as easy as it once was. Her baby-bearing stomach felt very heavy. And her nipples continued to radiate pain at the slightest touch - the thought of putting clothes on them was nigh-unimaginable. So, for now, she just leaned on the edge of the tub, staring at herself in the bathroom mirror, and sat there, simply stunned at the shape of the body.<br />
<br />
Melissa  threw a towel over Jaden&#39;s shoulders. Then she leaned over and kissed him on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so proud of you,&quot; she said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Melissa?&quot; said Colette, shocking himself by how rich-toned and womanly her voice had gotten. <br />
Colette had only just realized the significance of what sister had done to him. She had created new life, burdened her with the task of looking after it, and even handed him the responsibility of giving birth to it. Colette didn&#39;t know much about childbirth, but she knew it hurt a lot. Nevertheless, he knew he had to be the one to do it, otherwise, she&#39;d be the one responsible for killing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on and give your sister a cuddle!&quot;<br />
<br />
As they hugged, their baby bumps pressed up against one another, and they giggled. Colette hadn&#39;t been this excited in a very long time, but she was scared too. She had to remind herself that they were going to go through this together. His sister and herself would go into labor at the same time.<br />
<br />
Afterward, Melissa put on a bathrobe and left the room to go fetch some clothes, leaving Colette alone for a few minutes. She turned back around to take a closer look in the bathroom mirror. Her body had changed beyond all recognition. That much was for certain. But Cole&#39;s boyish face and scruffy haircut were almost the same as before she&#39;d transformed him. Her bangs had always been long-ish for a boy, but now they made her feel embarrassed. How would she ever explain it if someone from school saw her like this? She pouted at her reflection, wishing for once that she didn&#39;t look like herself.</p>
