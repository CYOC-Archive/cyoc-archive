<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Another CYOC user, perhaps one who lived next door to Ryan, or perhaps one that lived on the other side of the planet, perhaps male, or perhaps female, looked over the chapter in a thread that claimed it could control an entire reality.  The way this &quot;Ryan&quot; had depicted himself was certainly not flattering, morally, and his choice of changes were not, perhaps, the most ethical, if he truly believed the thread&#39;s absurd claim.  There was a certain degree of temptation the anonymous user felt, to simply reverse all the transformations made in the chapter before, but just instantly undoing a previous writer&#39;s changes felt like bad form.  Instead, the user got the idea to add a little potential conflict and drama, by filling in some details not previously established, and giving Anna a little mental change to go alongside her physical one.  And given that Ryan had not elaborated on any sort of plot beyond the changes, it wasn&#39;t as if the anonymous user would be ret-conning anything.<br />
<br />
***<br />
Ryan had never been so eager to get to school before.  Even if he felt like it was probably too good to be true, he wanted to see if he&#39;d really changed his enemies the night before.  Not to mention his chance to get a feel for his biology teacher&#39;s newly expanded bosom.<br />
<br />
The wait to get into Biology class had been a long one, but when he arrived, he couldn&#39;t help but smile.  There was Anna in the back row, confused about her new condition, her chair straining to hold her dramatically increased weight.  The stares from the rest of the students were divided between her, and Debby&#39;s new stereotypical bimbo physique and outfit, leaving the comparatively smaller change of Mary&#39;s increased bust size ignored by his class mates.<br />
<br />
And yet, Ryan couldn&#39;t help but feel something was off, on a second look.  Debby didn&#39;t seem all that bothered by her change.  In fact, she looked confident, like she was enjoying all the extra attention.  Anna, meanwhile, had started staring at him shortly after he&#39;d gotten into class, her eyes seeming to bore holes through him.  <br />
<br />
He shuffled over to his chair, Anna&#39;s gaze only ending once Mary had announced that class was in session.  Ryan smiled to himself.  Now that his teacher was allowed to let him feel her up, he was finally gonna really enjoy biology.  Now he only needed to wait.<br />
<br />
So he waited.<br />
<br />
And waited.<br />
<br />
And waited.<br />
<br />
As the lecture went on, and the end of class grew closer Ryan wondered what was taking so long.  Hesitantly, he snuck his cell phone under his desk, at an angle he could see, but Mary couldn&#39;t, and checked the chapter he&#39;d written the day before.  He groaned as he realized, while he&#39;d made it so she wouldn&#39;t get into trouble, and would be &quot;into it&quot; he didn&#39;t actually say she&#39;d KNOW she the rules had changed, nor that she&#39;d be willing to break her own personal moral code just to indulge herself with a student in real life, rather than a fantasy.  He also noticed that someone had added a new chapter to his entry, but he didn&#39;t have a chance to look.<br />
<br />
The bell rang, and Ryan hadn&#39;t gotten to feel anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;This sucks,&quot; he muttered, hoping that his new girlfriend-to-be in gym would be more interesting.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Anna was having a very confusing morning.  She and her parents were all surprised at the massive weight gain and tooth displacement that had occurred overnight.   Their first thought had been to go to a hospital, but, as there was nothing technically &quot;wrong&quot; with her, and the doctors, not knowing her personally, dismissed her impossible &quot;overnight&quot; weight gain as her simply being in denial, she was sent off to school.<br />
<br />
And yet, when she got to school, she realized that her body hadn&#39;t been the only thing to change.  Her natural gifts of deduction and observation had increased dramatically.  At a single glace, she could accurately guess what a student had eaten for breakfast, whether they&#39;d come on foot, bike, or bus, their hobbies, and in some cases, even what part of the neighborhood they lived in, all through little tells like crumbs or flecks of dirt on clothing, the way the skin had worn away more on some parts of their hands than others, and other seemingly insignificant features.  It was like she&#39;d become a modern-day Sherlock Holmes... or perhaps with the weight gain, the better comparison would have been Sherlock&#39;s less famous brother, Mycroft.<br />
<br />
Of course, she hadn&#39;t needed her new powers of deduction to see the changes that had come to Debby, who, unlike herself, seemed completely unbothered by them... and more strangely, seemed to be somewhat aware of why she&#39;d changed, even if she didn&#39;t know how she knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have Ryan to thank for my new good looks,&quot; she had said with a laugh.  &quot;Can you believe he thought this would be a punishment?  HA!  Kelly couldn&#39;t take her eyes off me, and she won&#39;t even look a guy&#39;s way now.  Which means she won&#39;t be kissing Ryan anytime soon.  Yeah, the outfit&#39;s not my usual style, but that can be fixed easily enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but HOW did he do it?&quot;  Anna had asked, suspecting her overnight change hadn&#39;t just been a coincidence.  Correlation may not be causation, but unnatural events like this were too unprecedented to dismiss the possibility out of hand.  &quot;And how do you know he did it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It just... came to me, when I saw my new looks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna was, needless to say skeptical, but as it was her only lead, she was determined to watch Ryan carefully once she&#39;d gotten to their first shared class, biology.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Anna said to Debby, when the class was over.  &quot;It&#39;s subtle, but he didn&#39;t seem nearly as surprised by our changes as the other students and the teachers.  And what&#39;s more, I saw him looking at his phone in class, something he wouldn&#39;t normally risk.  I couldn&#39;t read everything but it seems he was checking out a website called &#39;Choose Your Own Change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; Debby rubbed her chin.  &quot;It&#39;s a long shot but it might be worth a look...&quot;</p>
