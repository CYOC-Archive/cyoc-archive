<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nolan couldn&#39;t believe how great he felt. The elderly janitor usually found his daily routine taking him the entire day. Now, as a fit and young 18 year old, he had finished his work in only hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow just look at me,&quot; he whispered as he admired his appearance in the maintenance room locker room.  Nolan couldn&#39;t help but flex in his janitors jumpsuit, his biceps bulging under the material. &quot;Dr. Dunn you are a genius!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nolan just couldn&#39;t help admiring his youthful body. In his youth, Nolan had been quite the catch, a strong and muscular teen who had enlisted in the Army after high school. After serving in Korea, Nolan came home, working as a factory worker before he retired. Unfortunately for Nolan, his pension didn&#39;t quite cover all of his expenses. Meaning he found himself now working as a janitor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just think,&quot; he whispered. &quot;You have your entire life ahead of you now Nolan. The world is your oyster.&quot; Glancing at his face, Nolan did wonder if Ethan had maybe taken him back a bit too far.<br />
<br />
While the newly minted teens face was now free of wrinkles, their was no denying he was a teenager. Nolan typical five o&#39;clock shadow was nowhere near as prominent as he was used to. In fact, if he was being honest, he could probably go a few days without shaving.<br />
<br />
&quot;So much for going to the bar after work,&quot; he chuckled. As he continued to study himself, Nolan decided to unzip his jumpsuit. A smile now spread across his face as he saw his pecs straining the tshirt underneath. &quot;Man how I&#39;ve missed that,&quot; he grinned. &quot;I haven&#39;t looked this fit since the Army.&quot; Pulling back the collar and peaking down, Nolan could see his chest hair was a little sparser than before. &quot;It&#39;ll grow back as I get older,&quot; he shrugged.<br />
<br />
As Nolan now zipped up his jumpsuit, he noticed that while his  jumpsuit was tight around his well formed chest, his waist was quite a bit thinner. Thankful to be a thin and muscular, Nolan now made his way towards he paused as he heard something fall to the ground.<br />
<br />
Turning he was surprised to see his wedding ring had slipped from his finger. &quot;Huh thats WEirD,&quot; Nolan coughed, clearing his throat. Picking up his ring he now studied it carefully. Although his wife had died sometime ago he still wore it. That it would now slip from his finger was quite odd. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder why it fell off,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Its always fit me PerFECTly.&quot; Nolan rubbed his throat once more. Why was his voice cracking like that?<br />
<br />
As Nolan gazed at his ring, he felt his watch now slide on his wrist. Looking at his hand he was surprised to see how loose it was, the band now resting against the base of his thumb. &quot;Now my watch is LOose..LooSE....LOOSE.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nolan voice cut out, settling an octave higher than normal. What was going on. Looking at his hands, he could tell they were more youthful, the callous of years of work having faded leaving them boyish and smooth.<br />
<br />
Slowly though Nolan eyes began to grow wide as he watched the cuffs off his jumpsuit now slowly in his their way over his hands. It started simply, the cuffs covering a bit more of his hands than usual. It didn&#39;t stop though, the cuffs gradually consuming more and more of his hand. Now the cuffs covered half his palm, the janitor holding them out in shock. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whats happening to me,&quot; he whispered, his voice sounding boyish. <br />
<br />
Nolan now tried to make his way towards the mirror, shocked as he tried to move. Nolan jumpsuit was now baggier, larger on his frame. Glancing down he could see the cuffs dragging behind me, almost tripping him. As he ran he could tell something was wrong with his boots. They felt heavier now, larger, more cumbersome to move. It seemed crazy but Nolan was convinced the boots were several sizes too big for his feet. As the janitor now reached the mirror, he paused before screaming in shock. <br />
<br />
Staring back at Nolan was a boy, barely into his teens. Nolan face was round, no signs of facial hair anywhere on his face. Nolan clothing hung on him like a sack, making the janitor look like a boy who had borrowed his fathera work uniform. The former muscled janitor reduced to a thin and scrawny looking 13 year old boy.</p>
