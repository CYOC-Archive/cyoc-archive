<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The coin landed on tails. John jumped in the air and shouted in his achievement. Jessica was annoyed and <br />
whined&quot;Noo, flip it again!&quot;. <br />
<br />
Bobby said &quot;Now, that's not fair. You guys agreed that you'll let the coin flip decide, and it decided that <br />
you'll be the baby and John will be the daddy&quot;.<br />
<br />
She frowned at Bobby, while John did a celebratory dance behind her. Bobby helped them set up a little fort <br />
between the sofas that would act as their house before setting his plan in motion. Then he excused himself to <br />
the bathroom, deciding to try the ring on himself first. The wizard hadn't given him any directions on how to <br />
use it. Did he have to twist the gem in the ring, or did he have to say some magic words, or was it thought <br />
powered? He tried the easiest option, saying out loud &quot;I want to be 20 years old&quot;. Suddenly, he grew an extra <br />
few inches in height, surpassing 6 feet. He stared at his reflection in shock. His face lost whatever baby fat <br />
still existed on it, becoming more square-like in shape. Facial hair started appearing, giving him a decent <br />
coverage of stubble. His shirt stretched even tighter on him as his muscles expanded, before ripping entirely. <br />
He pulled the rags off his increasingly hairier body as the changes slowed and eventually stopped. He may only <br />
be 4 years older, but there was no way he could pass himself off as his original age to the kids downstairs. <br />
He scratched his face, wishing he had time to actually shave, which could make him look younger. But then he <br />
had an idea. &quot;I want everyone to think I've always been the age I currently am&quot;. He felt a shiver after making <br />
the demand, but couldn't tell if anything actually happened.<br />
<br />
Bobby came back downstairs after finding another shirt to replace the one he ripped, to find John and Jessica <br />
well into their game of house. John was pretending to be baking cakes for the tea party that Jessica was <br />
holding for her soft toy collection. She noticed him come downstairs and shouted &quot;Look, other daddy's home!&quot; <br />
and ran over to him. Bobby bent down to pick her up while she giggled and said &quot;your face is so scratchy, it's <br />
weird&quot;. Bobby thought his previous wish hadn't worked but neither of them asked him anything out of the <br />
ordinary after that. He put Jessica down and she went back to pouring tea for her panda plush. <br />
<br />
Bobby had to word his next command carefully so neither John or Jessica would notice the changes. He thought <br />
about it hard before finally softly saying &quot;I want John to physically and mentally age one year every ten <br />
minutes until I say the word &quot;papaya&quot; out loud, and I am the only one who is able to notice he is getting <br />
older&quot;. He felt another shiver after he stopped talking, and hoped it would work. He looked at the boy still <br />
pretending to cook and he didn't look any different yet. Bobby joined Jessica at the makeshift table, enjoying <br />
their game of make-believe.<br />
<br />
After an hour, the changes to John were definitely noticeable as he was now 10 years old. His clothes were <br />
changing with him, now wearing a shirt with a faded Bugs Bunny logo on it, his jeans just looking enlarged, <br />
which Bobby was relieved by because he didn't want to find out what would happen if the clothes didn't change <br />
with him. The boy was tall for his age, about 4'8&quot;, and was slightly husky. The kids had given up on playing <br />
house a long time ago as John got bored of playing kiddie games, but Jessica didn't seem to mind, too involved <br />
with her tea party to really care what he did. He now sat with Bobby on the sofa watching some primetime TV. <br />
He suddenly had some intense hunger pains. &quot;Bobby, I'm so hungry! Is it time for dinner yet?&quot;. Bobby looked at <br />
his wristwatch, finding it was now 7 in the evening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, I didn't even know that was the time! I'm sorry, what do you guys want to eat?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pizza!&quot; yelled out Jessica.<br />
<br />
About an hour later, after finding no pizza in the house and neither kid would agree to eat anything else, the <br />
pizza Bobby ordered had been delivered and they are. It turned out one large pizza wasn't enough for the three <br />
of them as John devoured most of it, now having grown to 16. He had almost surpassed Bobby in height, and <br />
still seemed to be growing. He now wore a sleeveless shirt, naturally tight to show off the 155 pounds of lean <br />
muscle he now had. A healthy patch of chest hair stuck out the top, more than the average teen his age. A <br />
scruffy goatee had appeared on his chin, grown with the hopes it made him look more mature. Bobby looked at <br />
his watch again and said &quot;Well it looks like it's time for you guys to go to bed&quot;. John gave him an <br />
incredulous look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah, you're kidding right? It's only 8 o clock! Dude, I'm sixteen. You can't tell me when to go to bed&quot;. He <br />
laughed at the idea. Bed at 8? Not since he was a little kid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right... But it's still bedtime for you young lady!&quot; Bobby replied before picking up a squirming and <br />
protesting Jessica and taking her upstairs to get ready for bed. He regretted letting her have some ice cream <br />
after dinner as she was bouncing-off-the-walls-hyper, not able to keep still for a second. It took some major <br />
convincing and an extra-long bedtime story before he finally managed to get her to sleep. Closing the door as <br />
quiet as possible, he made his way back downstairs, the TV blaring some sort of comedy with canned laughter. <br />
He could hear John laughing along with it, his voice rivalling the Winchester brothers in depth. Bobby thought <br />
It was weird to think he used to be 4 years old a few hours ago. Now they were the same age as each other, a <br />
quick look at his watch confirming this. <br />
<br />
John heard Bobby coming down the stairs and yelled out &quot;Yo dude, you got booze in the fridge? Get some for <br />
me&quot;. Bobby grabbed some beer his dad kept in the fridge, briefly wondering where his parents had gotten to, <br />
then came back into the living room to hand John the bottle. He was a bit taken back with how different John <br />
looked compared to when he last saw him. His body was sprawled out across the sofa, now reaching a full 6'3&quot; <br />
in height. His previously lean body had now bulked up ever further, the contours of his pecs and abs easily <br />
visible through the taut vest he had on. He reached out a large hand to take the beer with a gruff thanks, his <br />
arms had a thick coating of hair covering them almost up to his shoulders, which had their own light patch of <br />
hair on them connected to the sprawling fur coating his chest, left to grow wildly across his muscular body. <br />
His wavy brown hair had lengthened considerably, flowing around his shoulders and upper back. Much of his face <br />
was hidden behind a large dark brown beard, reaching 3 inches in length. &quot;Dude, you OK? Have I got something <br />
in my beard again?&quot; John said to Bobby, who had been staring at him for an awkwardly long time now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh, no. It's just... I never really thought about how different you look compared to a few years back. <br />
Especially that beard.&quot;. Bobby pushed John's feet off the sofa and sat down next to him.<br />
<br />
John grinned at his friend's sudden interest in his looks. &quot;It's just from laziness really. I can spend more <br />
time in bed if I don't shave. And I can spend more time working out if I don't get my hair cut&quot;. He swiped <br />
some stray hairs away from his face, wishing he'd tied it back. &quot;Hey, you should think of growing a beard. You <br />
have ever much better coverage than I do&quot;.<br />
<br />
Bobby smiled back at his friend, scratching the stubble he forgot he had. He'd never really thought of growing <br />
a beard before. But if John thought he'd look good, then he may as well try. He could always shave it if he <br />
didn't like it. He turned back to John and said&quot;By the way, thanks for helping look after Jessica for me. Or <br />
at least for being here while I looked after her&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No problem bro. It's nice to just sit back and relax for a while, you know? She's no handful at all&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you didn't help at all putting her to bed. I hope paint is easy to get out of carpet...&quot;. John <br />
chuckled at his friend's misfortunes and got back to watching TV.<br />
<br />
fake memories were entering Bobby's head. Or could they be considered real now? He met John at college during <br />
freshers week, He was majoring in film production while John was training to be a doctor and they bumped into <br />
each other outside the booth for Archery Club. John had been clean shaven and had much shorter hair back <br />
then... No wait, John was helping to run the booth. He'd been in college for a year by then, his hair was <br />
already quite shaggy, along with a chinstrap beard. Wait, John was 21 now? He glanced at his friend again. He <br />
didn't look that much different to him. John caught him looking again, and smiled at him. Maybe he should say <br />
that word he made as the signal for John to stop aging. But he only had a vague memory of the word now. It was <br />
something silly sounding. Guacamole? Krakatoa? Banana? He had to think about it.</p>
