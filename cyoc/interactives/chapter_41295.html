<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will awoke, his chest feeling really strange. He was sleeping on his side, something he never did, but for some reason found to be really comfortable. Behind him, Megan was spooning with him and for some reason her evening wear had balled up and was pressing stiffly into his lower back, just above his anus.<br />
<br />
Sliding out of bed, he walked toward the bathroom, not paying the slightest bit of attention to the fact that he was walking like a woman; chest out, shoulders leading, butt stuck just a bit. In this bathroom, he looked in the mirror and noted that for some reason his face looked rounder, softer, more feminine. And then he looked down and what he saw caught him off guard and he almost screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell,&quot; Will asked as he reached down and in the same manner Megan took off her shirts, he grasped the hem and lifted up.<br />
<br />
Not believing what he saw, Will looked back at the mirror, aghast at what was happening. Reflected back where two pert and firm breasts, that where milky white in appearance and had two erect nipples. If Will had to make a guess, he'd would have guessed that they where about a B cup, one cup size smaller then Megan's.<br />
<br />
Touching the nipple sent a shock of pleasure through his body and Will thought, &quot;What the hell is going on here? I'm not suppose to have breasts. It's not suppose to feel good to touch my nipples. What the hell is going on here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking that someone was punishing him for something he didn't do, Will looked back in the mirror. Suddenly the events of last night at dinner came back to him and instead of letting his shirt drop, he removed it and then took off the rest of his pajamas. Walking toward a full body mirror Megan kept in the bathroom, Will stopped and cursed silently.<br />
<br />
What he saw horrified him even more. It wasn't so much that he still had the external genitalia...something inside him hoped it was only external...of a female, plus the breasts and the soft feminine face, it was the way he walked. He walked in the same way Megan did. Gazing into the mirror, he noted that it was only his face that had taken on a feminine trait, while his body still retained much of his masculine features, except for the odd feminine piece of flesh here and there.<br />
<br />
Cursing silently some more, he told himself, &quot;I can't go to work looking like this,&quot; as he sat down on the toilet to pee. After wiping himself...an odd thing to do he thought, but it had felt natural...he stood ad exited the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Collecting Megan's robes, he headed for the phone in the hall, noting how soft the fabric felt against his body. Picking up the phone, he dialed work, ready to pretend he had a sore throat and a cold, a trick that had allowed him to weasel out of work on more then one time because he had seniority over the rest of the employees.<br />
<br />
But for some reason it was didn't work. Because when he tried it, telling the secretary his name she told him that they did not have anyone working there by his name. Upset, he began to bark out orders and instead got a Supervisor, who reiterated what the secretary had told him. Upset, he hung up the phone and sat down in a chair in the hall. Only to stand up suddenly when he realized he'd crossed his legs so easily. Bothered by all of this, thinking this was a bad dream...that or some type of Voodoo Curse for something he didn't do...he headed back to the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Megan was still asleep and crossing the room, he paused in front of her dresser. Opening the top drawer, he took out a pair of low cut bikini briefs that felt soft and smooth in his hands. Liking the way the fabric felt, he pulled them on with out taking off the robe.<br />
<br />
What he saw horrified him even more because the underwear made him look even more feminine in the crotch. Not understanding why he liked the way they felt, Will asked himself, &quot;Is this what I have to looked forward to in life? Turning fully into a woman? Enjoying trying on clothes and acting feminine?&quot;<br />
<br />
No answers came and instead he pulled a bra from the dresser and attempted to pull that on, realizing that for some reason, Megan's clothes had a real nice smell to them.<br />
<br />
Behind him, Megan, who'd been awake since Will had returned from the hallway, watched as he struggled to put on the article of clothing. Suppressing the urge to laugh, she instead looked down at her own chest, which was down to an A cup.  Wondering how Will would react, Megan slid silently out of bed, noting the feel of the garment against her semi-hard penis.<br />
<br />
Walking across the room, she touched Will on the shoulder, who jumped a bit and turning, gave her a guilty look. Leaning down to kiss him, she whispered in his ear, &quot;Come back to bed, sweetie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will was torn between liking the touch and horrified at what he saw. Poking through her nightgown, Megan had a semi-hard penis and it was slowly getting harder. The bra fell to the floor, forgotten, and Will returned the kiss and giggling in a feminine manner, touched Megan's penis and asked, &quot;Is that for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Finding he was unable to stop the surge of hormones and chemicals, Will went along with it and allowed Megan to lead him back to bed. There, he allowed her to take control. Caressing his breast tenderly, she leaned down and began to lick and kiss his nipples, all the while gently removing his panties.<br />
<br />
Sensations flooded Will and suddenly he remembered that he had felt this last night, but it was pushed aside as Megan rubbed her body against his. Her rock hard penis rubbing against his clitoris and clitoris hood, juices forming, preparing his body for what was about to happen, Will moaned in pleasure as gently Megan slid her cock into his vagina. And slowly Will's moans turned into a high, girlish voice of him telling Megan over and over, &quot;Yes, yes, yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hands groping and touching, lips contacting with each other and skin, the two lost themselves to their love making and when both Megan and Will orgasm at the same time, they lost themselves completely.<br />
<br />
Afterward, Will curled up and fell back to sleep, content and happy, forgetting the changes his body where under going. Beside him, Megan drifted between wakefulness and sleep. After a bit, she slid out of bed, collected her nightgown that had fallen to the floor and padded into the hallway. Seeing Will sleeping, she shut the door and made her way to the computer and the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Sitting down in front of it, she booted up the computer. As it ran through its start-up menus, Megan told herself, &quot;This is really fun, but I want to alter something or two. Really punish Will for his sexism toward woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Typing, she pulled up Will's profile. From there she entered that he would continue to switch attributes with Megan, still becoming a woman on the fourth day, but his life as a woman would only last thee months. Then he would slowly revert back to a girl on the cusp of puberty.<br />
<br />
This transformation would take him a week. Then he would spend two months like this. And then, just as if he can not wait for his new body to stop betraying him, he would revert, slowly, slowly back to that of a four year old girl; giving him time to grow up as a girl, but not turning out like Megan. And here she began to alter some more, telling herself, &quot;I always wanted a girl,&quot; noting that the internal reproductive organs had not switched between her and Will.<br />
<br />
Typing, she entered that Will would grow up to be a five foot ten, drop dead gorgeous woman with a size seven waist, pert and firm B cup breasts, an IQ of one hundred and sixty nine, shoulder length dark red hair and hazel eyes, with an active interest in ballet and gymnastics, but no interest in computers. Satisfied, she hit the save button, making sure she and Will where the only two aware of the changes, but no one else.<br />
<br />
Next she pulled up her profile and telling herself, &quot;Fun's fun,&quot; she began to type.<br />
<br />
She left that she and Will would switch attributes over the next four days, but she changed something. For the next three months she would live her life as a man. When the three months where up, she would slowly change back into herself while Will underwent his transformation. The only way she could stop her change, was to tell the computer, something she didn't know what she'd do when the three months where up.<br />
<br />
Satisfied, she hit the save button, noted her chest had completely flattened out, she shut the computer down and went back the bedroom, wondering if Will was awake again and would allow her to help him dress in the bra. &quot;I think he'll look so cute in the pink and white striped one piece dress. The one with the bow on the front and the floral pattern on the skirt part,&quot; Megan thought to herself.</p>
