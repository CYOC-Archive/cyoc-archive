<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the next couple of days Aidan tried everything he could think of to regain his freedom, but Mark didn&#39;t let him go. One time after a week Aidan run outside while Mark was leaving for his classes. Two days he stayed away without a problem, again staying in a park, but could do nothing to kill the time. If anyone could see him, they would see a young man levitating above one of the banks, turning in frustration because he was unable to fall asleep. Other problems Aidan had, were his growing hunger and thirst, along with a to him magically building pressure in his bladder and bowels, with no way of release.<br />
Mark let Aidan that freedom, never searching for him. Aidan would return on his own and see Mark&#39;s reaction to his behavior. And so Mark had a quiet few days before Aidan returned, looking bad. But to show his displeasure about running away, Mark never opened his front-door that day. He only knew of Adan&#39;s return thanks to the chronivac, as he could use it to locate him, and had it give an alert if he returned. Mark also had a camera showing his step, to know who had rung the bell.<br />
Aidan returned on the fourth day, looking worse than a corpse. From his sleepless days, his bursting full bladder, which resulted in him hopping on Mark&#39;s front-step, and his great need to drink something. But he had no way of alerting Mark of his presence. His throat was too dry to scream, and he couldn&#39;t ring the doorbell. So, he just could wait there hopping around the whole night.<br />
Mark waited until the next morning, giving Aidan another half-day of “freedom”. Only when he got his newspaper on this late Saturday morning, Aidan could come inside, looking like he would cry if he could. “Oh, you are back again. Never noticed you there, you should have made yourself known, Aidan.” Mark laughed as he placed the newspaper on the table. Then, without allowing Aidan anything, Mark again walked to the door. “Well, I need to get going, need to buy some groceries, see you later.”<br />
Aidan was near a breakdown, Mark had just ignored his needs and left him alone. It was pure torture already, and now he had to wait even longer for any release.<br />
Mark was grinning the whole time he was out, enjoying his day. He really hoped Aidan had learned his lesson when he returned home.<br />
Another few hours of torture later, Mark finally returned home, greeting Aidan with a grin. “How was your day? What do you need first?”<br />
Aidan was unable to explain his needs with a dry throat, so he pointed at his open mouth in hopes that Mark would know what he meant. “Oh, you are hungry, then? Come, I will make you something quick.” It had not been what Aidan meant, but Mark just put together a few sandwiches for Aidan to eat. “Here, you can eat them, Aidan.” Mark allowed before turning to put his groceries away.<br />
Mark knew exactly that Aidan wanted something to drink, but he enjoyed the silence and Adan&#39;s pleading look even as he ate the sandwiches hungrily. Only after they were finished, Mark gave him a bottle of water. “Okay, now you have earned it, you can drink from that bottle of water now.”<br />
After greedily eating the sandwiches, Aidan just as greedily drunk that bottle empty in big gulps. With a sigh he relaxed a bit, before being remembered of his full bladder. Also remembering Mark&#39;s earlier question, he said, still sounding hoarse: “Mark, please let me ...”<br />
But Mark stopped him grinning: “I won&#39;t let you go. I guess after being out there so long, you&#39;re tired, right? Well, even if it is quite early, you can go lay down and sleep, Aidan.”<br />
Aidan wanted to protest, as it wasn&#39;t freedom he wanted to ask for primary, but as Mark&#39;s words allowed him to finally sleep, it was seconds before his body crashed on the carpet, dead asleep right on the spot.<br />
Mark laughed again fully knowing what Aidan had wanted to ask instead. But he had another penalty for Adan&#39;s bad behavior. In some way, it was also a reward, if you saw it from the right angle. Mark got the last bag of his shopping, the only one he hadn&#39;t put away yet. With an evil grin, Mark stripped Aidan out of his jeans and boxers, noting Adan&#39;s cock was standing at full length, begging for attention. “Oh, someone is horny, huh? Too bad you are sleeping right now, and later won&#39;t be able to touch it.”<br />
Without missing a second Mark got to work, unwrapping a diaper from the shopping bag. He was quick to place it under Adan&#39;s naked ass, before wrapping around, pressing down the hard cock. Aidan moaned while he slept through being diapered by Mark. Afterwards, Mark replaced Adan&#39;s jeans over it. He put a blanket over the sleeping Aidan. With a smile Mark walked away, letting his plaything of a friend sleep in peace.<br />
The only thing Mark made sure of with the chronivac afterwards was that Aidan´s diapers would never leak anything out.<br />
<br />
It was clear how tired Aidan had been, as he slept through the whole evening and night without stirring. When Mark made himself some coffee the next morning, Aidan slowly woke up. It took him a couple of seconds to remember where he was, still hoping that all this was a nightmare he finally woke up from. But feeling his bursting bladder without being able to release the pressure showed him it was still real.<br />
As he got up he didn&#39;t realized the diaper he was now wearing. As he noticed Mark in the kitchen, slowly drinking his coffee while reading the Sunday paper, he walked over.<br />
“Morning Aidan. Finally awake? Hope you slept well?” Mark greeted him. If Aidan was behaving, Mark was always friendly to him.<br />
Aidan looked at Mark pleadingly as he greeted him. “Morning Mark. Can you …?”<br />
Mark yet again stopped Aidan. “I already have made breakfast for us both. Here, sit down, have some eggs and bacon, enjoy some toast and milk, but let me read the paper in silence.”<br />
Aidan could ignore Mark&#39;s wishes about eating, but as he couldn&#39;t be sure if Mark would revoke it later, he sighed mentally before sitting down, and started eating slowly. The silence command was something he couldn&#39;t break, so asking for release of his bladder was impossible.<br />
Ten minutes later, Mark put the paper away, looking over at Adan&#39;s pleading eyes as he ate, and his not so calm behavior Grinning at what was to come, Mark asked: “Something wrong, Aidan? Can&#39;t sit still?”<br />
Aidan stopped eating for the moment, answering in a pleading tone: “Mark please, I need to use the toilet. I haven&#39;t been able to release anything since I run out.”<br />
Mark laughed before replying: “Yeah, I know. And I&#39;m sure that would have been your question yesterday before I said you could sleep, but I wanted you to learn your lesson and not try to run away again. But yes, okay. Aidan, you are allowed to relieve yourself now.”<br />
Aidan nodded as Mark mentioned having learned his lesson, even if he still wanted to escape. His relieve was short-lived, however, as Mark&#39;s words sunk in. But before he could stop, his body opened the floodgates, emptying both his bladder and his bowels on the spot. Aidan turned bright red in embarrassment “Mark, no please. Why did you make me release here? Now you will need to clean the mess in your kitchen and wash my clothes.”<br />
Mark sat there laughing. So, Aidan hadn&#39;t noticed yet. After calming down again, Mark explained grinning: “Na, there is no mess for me to clean up. Not even your clothes are dirty.” As if to show his point, Mark grabbed something from behind his chair, showing Aidan the boxers he had been wearing the last few days on the run.<br />
Aidan looked confused at first, but turned white in mortification as Mark showed him his own boxers he was sure he was wearing right now. But if he didn&#39;t wear them right now, what exactly was underneath his jeans? As he touched his jeans he realized what was there, again turning bright red. “You … you diapered me? When? Why?”<br />
Mark grinned at him still. “Like it? I did it yesterday after you fell asleep. That way I can allow you to use it. It’s some kind of freedom you get back. As long as you wear a diaper, you are allowed to use without me needing any extra input.” Then he laughed at Aidan.<br />
Aidan was horrified at the thought of using a diaper. At least he would have control, or at least he hoped so. But what about ... “But... that would mean you need to change me, right? Mark, that&#39;s worse than asking if I can use the bathroom. Please, no.”<br />
Mark still laughed as he answered: “Yeah, I will need to change you. Don&#39;t worry, I will do so. See it as both, punishment for not submit to me and reward for holding out this long.”<br />
Aidan was about to protest further, but Mark had none of it. “We won&#39;t discuss this further, accept it. Maybe as another reward I will remove it later, but only if you behave. And no, you won&#39;t be able to change yourself. That way, if you misbehave, I can simply let you sit it out in your used diaper. But as there was much more you had to release than normal, I will change you now and not let you suffer any longer. So, get over to the blanket over there and lay down. Let me change you without fuss and I will think of something you can occupy your mind with afterwards.”<br />
Aidan had no wish for Mark to change his diaper, but also didn&#39;t want to remain in the mess he had made in it any longer. So, under silent protest, he moved over and laid down. Mark took his time to remove first Adan&#39;s jeans, showing him it was still dry and clean, before removing the diaper. He cleaned the area, giving an extra slow rub to the still erect cock, remembering Aidan of yet another problem he had. Turning even a brighter shade of red, he asked: “Mark, can I at least have the freedom to masturbate alone before you put that on me again?”<br />
Mark grinned at the question, seeing how red Aidan was yet again. But he didn&#39;t answer, just put the new diaper around Adan&#39;s groin, pressing his cock down again. Only afterwards he spoke up. “No, Aidan. As I saw your cock yesterday, I thought of it being an extra punishment. Maybe before I change you the next time, I will allow you to cum, but not now. You can decide if you put your jeans back on or not.” And with that, Mark moved over to his computer.<br />
Aidan was quick to put the jeans back on, not liking being half naked, even if only Mark could see him. He had hated that after the changes as he run away the first time. After a short wait, Mark gave him a book to read. While it wasn&#39;t something he would normally read, at least his mind was occupied.</p>
