<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;On second thought, come here with me for a second, Jeff!&quot; Said Marcoh<br />
<br />
&quot;stop calling me that. That's not my name....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, whatever. Just come along. I want to show you something.<br />
<br />
Mike sighed, deciding to play along for a a bit more, hoping to get out of this small teenaged boy's body. Marcoh was leading Mike up to his stables.<br />
<br />
=======<br />
<br />
Since it was now well past midnight and after such a huge ordeal, Jeff was sound asleep standing on all fours as a donkey. Suddenly, he heard someone calling his name. Thinking it was his father waking him up for school, Jeff hee-haawed his thoughts of trying to ask him for a few more minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, get up! I want you to meet someone!&quot; said Marcoh.<br />
<br />
Jeff, still quite groggy, and still with last night's really strange and terrifying dream in his mind (he &quot;dreamed&quot; he had turned into a donkey!) Jeff's eyes slowly began to lift.<br />
<br />
Wanting to grab and lift the covers off of himself so he could stretch while yawning, he discovered he was already upright and not in his bed. Thinking this a bit strange, he attempted to ask &quot;where am I?&quot; And of course, the only thing coming from his mouth was just a pathetic little &quot;Heeee-haawww....hheeee....hhhaaa...&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, thinking this was eerily similar to the strange, realistic dream he had last night, he tried again:<br />
<br />
&quot;Where am I? Heeee-haawww....hheeee....hhhaaa...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff! I said I wanted you to meet someone! Now, come awake for a minute, then you can go back to sleep!&quot; Said Marcoh, while Jeff was still believing it was his father.<br />
<br />
his mind working quite slow....slower than normal....Jeff noticed his mouth tasted nasty. The worst sort of morning breath he has ever experienced in his young, short life thus far. He also noticed as he was trying to ask his questions earlier, his tongue seemed rather unpliable. He couldn't move it in the proper ways in order to form real words. Pulling his tongue back into his mouth, he felt around, smacking his lips, and licking his teeth. Come to think of it, his teeth seemed much larger and blockier than he ever remember! His nose itching, he swung his over-sized sticky tongue out, and automatically licked his own nose with it, without even thinking about it! He did it several times, before he noticed what he was doing.<br />
<br />
Thinking &quot;but that was just a dream, wasn't it? I'm not REALLY an ugly smelly donkey, am I?&quot; while hee-haawwing aloud.<br />
<br />
Hearing those ugly noises coming from within himself, he quickly opened his eyes all the way: and couldn't make things out very well. He also couldn't see any colors either. Just a strange mushy blacks, whites, and mostly a lot of grays. <br />
<br />
Attempting to say &quot;uh-oh,&quot; a short &quot;hee-haaww&quot; came out.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no! This aint happeneing! I'm not really a stupid donkey! Dammit!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haawww....haawww....hawww....heeeeeeeee....haaaawwww....heeee....haawww....haawww.....haawww...&quot;<br />
<br />
That series of brays started sending him into a panic. Attmpeting to reach up, and move about, his legs felt like lead. He could only paw the ground with his friggin hooves! <br />
<br />
Eventually calming down, he was trying to understand why he couldn't lash out, when he remembered those shoes on the bottoms of his hooves, keeping him in check.<br />
<br />
Feeling defeated, all he could do was hang his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;'at-a-boy, Jeff! Here. Someone wants to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling frustrated, but most of all, embarrassed and ashamed at what he still is, he looked away, when the rest of his body caught his attention. His ugly ropey tail just above his ass, and his HUGE donkey penis dangling below him, for allt he world to see!<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike, come on in. It's ok,&quot; said Marcoh.<br />
<br />
upon hearing his brother's name, Jeff brayed rather excidedly, wanting to say &quot;Mike! It's me! Thank God, I need help!&quot; But stopped midway through his first series of &quot;heee-haaa...&quot; not realizing that wasn't his brother, but rather Marcoh's neighbor inside of his old human body.<br />
<br />
As Mike stepped forward, Marcoh began to explain to Mike what happened to Jeff. Marcoh explained to Mike how Jeff wanted to become such a beast, and wanted to remain a beast for the rest of his days (and Jeff unable to interject with the truth!) and how he is now stuck, permanently, with the body of a donkey.<br />
<br />
Jeff, looking as closely as he could, thought that was truly his twin brother. Never really being given the opportunity to see his human body, and his twin's body side-by-side, he couldn't tell that it was his old body standing before him, and not his brother afterall. <br />
<br />
Marcoh continued, &quot;so, Mike. You have now met the kid who used to occupy the body you now have. As for you, Jeff, this isn't your brother Mike. Rather, this is the new occupant of your old human body: My neighbor Mike Callahan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how do we get back to normal then?&quot; asked Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Jeff over there has no chance at all. Long story short: He's stuck as a jackass mule forever. He shall be working on a farm owned by an Amish family. <br />
<br />
As for you, I can make it so that the boy Jeff's brain takes over with all of its memories. It will still be your soul inside of Jeff's body. But the brain will be the brain of the former Jeff. In other words: I can make it so that you have all of his memories, his personality, his intelligence, and his skills and so forth. And the real Jeff will forever remain in the form he currently is in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike looked up at Jeff, and said &quot;Wow, that sucks. Why in the world would you ever want to be a donkey? You look and smell nasty. Especially as good-looking as this body is and feels.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking about it, Mike decided it might not be such a bad idea to live the life of a 14 year old boy, afterall. Especially if it will seem &quot;normal&quot; to him. He always wanted to see what it would be like to have a twin. Even though this kid was very short for his age.<br />
<br />
So, Mike looked up at Dr. Marcoh, and said &quot;I think I would like the idea of becoming a kid agian, after all. But one thing: Can you make it so my mind will slowly become absorbed by this Jeffery kid over the course of about a week? I want to make sure I actually enjoy being a kid again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing. Not a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stood there (which is all about he could do,) and took in this exchange before him. Looking down at his old body with someone else occupying it, Jeff longed to be back to normal again. His body smelled nice. He was a good looking boy. He was clean, smooth, and most of all, he could TALK, and had HANDS. <br />
<br />
Looking at the mirror in the stable, Jeff saw his ugly, nasty body. Those EARS. Those TEETH. The teeth, especially, looked very nasty. He knew, if he could see color, they would look all yellow, and disgusting. His hooves, his TAIL, and most of all, his obnoxious PENIS. He couldn't even hide the damned thing! Gawds, how he longed to be wearing clothes again. <br />
<br />
Mike stepped back into Jeff's left angle of view, so that Jeff could both see his current form in the mirror our of his right eye, and his old body standing in front of him out of his left. Those clothes. Those shoes. He remember going to the mall with his brother, and his brother's girlfriend. Talia was the one that picked out those clothes that Mike was currently wearing. <br />
<br />
Mike reached up to pet Jeff. &quot;My hands! Those are MY hands!&quot; thought Jeff. &quot;It's Ok, boy. You got what you wanted, and I have what I want now. This is now my life, and that is now yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff opened his mouth to speak (or at least TRY to) and all that came out was a long drawn-out useless (and forever irritating and ridiculous) Haaawwww!<br />
<br />
&quot;ok, it's finished! You shall now slowly enter into Jefferey Palermo's life,&quot; said Marcoh.<br />
<br />
&quot;As for you, Jeff. Your name shall be &quot;Marcoh.&quot; I will draw up your paperwork, in order to sell you as a pedigree, I need to append my name to you. You shall be sold to the Amish family named Stoltzfus. So your name will become &quot;Marcoh Stoltzfus. Not very Italian, is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Upon hearing his new, stupid idiotic name, and looking at his old body and hearing someone else calling it by his former name, and seeing his big, clumsy, gross new body in the mirror and not being able to do anything about it, Jeff's penis began to get hard. <br />
<br />
His penis extended out, and out, and out. The damned thing wouldn't stop growing! <br />
<br />
Marcoh commented &quot;Boy, you sure love the idea of remaining like this forever, don't ya? You look like you're ready to try and have some donkey babies there. hahaha,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;ewwwww, that's friggin gross!&quot; said Mike.<br />
<br />
Jeff really began to feel disgusted, ashamed, and frustrated, which only made his hard-on worse. He turned further to the side, hoping to hide the monstrous thing under his back flanks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go on now, Jef....errr...I mean, Stoltzfus! Have at it! You're an animal now, so you should feel no shame in doing only what comes naturally! hahaha.&quot;<br />
<br />
At which point, Jeff felt the shoes on the bottoms of his hooves start to vibrate. his front right hoof lifted of it's own accord, and tried &quot;grabbing&quot; onto his penis. Unable to help himself, Jeff attempted to say &quot;What the fuck!?&quot; But only began to bray. As his sexual tension was building more and more, and his frustration mounted, Jeff began panicking once again. He just wanted to SPEAK. To be able to move his FINGERS. Hell, he wanted a shower, and to wear clothes again! And seeing someone else in HIS body standing there, watching him, totally grossed out by this disgusting animal before him, and thinking once agian of his over-sized nasty donkey tongue in his nasty donkey mouth, his penis REALLY flared up. <br />
<br />
Jeff wanted to escape! He wanted out of his body! He was trying to &quot;stretch&quot; himself out. He just wanted his hands to break free of their imprisonment inside these useless hooves. He wanted to be able to see properly again, to see colors, and a distance of more than five feet to either side. He wanted most of all, to be able to SPEAK. To quit sounding like nothing but an obnoxious jackass!<br />
<br />
And so, his sexual tension and frustration, began to reach a crescendo. It peaked, but nothing was happening. Without hands, or anything to brace himself on, it was nearly impossible to experience any sort of release. his penis was at its maximum size and tension, and it was hurting. And so, he began braying, just out of pure torture.<br />
<br />
Mike turned and looked up at Marcoh, and said &quot;Well, I guess it's about time for me to get to my new family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right, &quot;Jeff.&quot; Let's go,&quot; said Marcoh.<br />
<br />
And they both turned, and walked away, leaving the real Jeff to his own devices. <br />
<br />
Watching them go, and thinking of the state he was currently in, and just how trapped he was with absolutely zero freedom to get off this damned farm, Jeff wanted to cry. But that is another feature left out for donkeys: They are unable to cry. Only thing he could do, is just continue standing there, braying and wishing with all of his might to be released.</p>
