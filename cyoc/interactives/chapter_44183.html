<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This was the strangest morning ever.  Somehow, someway, Ty turned me into a 13-year-old, I just knew it.  But Mom and Dad didn't see any difference, why?  I looked at myself in the bathroom, trying not to freak out.  I'm definitely shorter--normally the counter only comes up to my waist, now it hit me above my belly button.  I looked down at my body that suddenly looked so small.  The hairs I had going from my belly button to my dick were gone and I didn't even want to look at my dick again, at least, not yet.  I looked at my face.  Am I really younger?  No, I'm just seeing things, or dreaming.  Yeah, this is all one crazy dream.<br />
<br />
I was interrupted by Mom yelling, &quot;I don't hear any water!&quot;  So I quickly jumped in the shower.  Everything seemed just a little farther away, like my arms just couldn't reach far enough.  I tried to ignore it and keep showering.  Then the inevitable happened.  I had to face my dick.  Yes, it definitely is smaller.  And it felt softer, somehow.  A little more lively?  Before I knew it, I was jacking off, but it was hard work.  My dick kept wanting more, but my arm just wasn't strong enough.  My arms!  All those muscles from so much lifting were gone!<br />
<br />
Eventually, I pulled myself out of the shower and started to get dressed.  I pulled up a pair of boxers, but they slid right off me when I reached for my shorts.  This proved that I really have shrunk--why else wouldn't my clothes fit?  I tried another pair of boxers, but the same thing happened.  Then I found an older pair of whity-tighties--they were a little loose, but at least they stayed up.  Then I tried on a pair of shorts, but they slid down even faster than the boxers.  I hate to admit this, but I almost started crying right there.  I used to be 6 feet tall and 190 pounds of lean muscle, but now I am smaller, and there's nothing I can do about it.<br />
<br />
I quickly pulled myself together, though.  I can do this, I told myself.  I found my smallest pair of basketball shorts that I never wore anymore, and I pulled the drawstring as tight as it would go.  It worked, the shorts stayed up, even though they went way past my knees.  I then found my smallest tee-shirt, which draped goofily on me.  The short sleeves went past my elbows and the collar almost seemed too wide to stay on my now-boney shoulders.  I looked at myself in my full-body mirror.  I look like a doofus.  Like a little 7th grader wearing his older brother's clothes.  I took a deep breath and told myself to keep it under control.  I'll just stay home today and hopefully this thing will be all over real soon.<br />
<br />
I went down for breakfast, where Ty was not only constantly staring at me, but he had the biggest, evil grin on his face.  Did he really do this to me?  In any case, he definitely was happy about it.  But wait, Mom and Dad don't think I look different, but does Ty?  I tried to push these thoughts out of my head and concentrate on eating breakfast.  It was so hard getting used to my smaller limbs--I had to do everything in my power to make sure I didn't fall down the stairs.  I didn't say anything at breakfast--I had already heard my new whiny, squeaky voice, and I didn't want to hear it again.<br />
<br />
Mom and Dad went out somewhere, I don't know where, I wasn't really listening, but it sounded like they'd be gone all day.  As soon as I finished my cereal, I ran upstairs to room, but I tripped and fell flat on my face.  I needed to lift my shorter legs higher, I guess.  Unfortunately Ty saw it, and started laughing.  It was an awful sound.  I turned and gave him the meanest glare I could, then continued up to my room, a little slower and more carefully.  When I slammed my door, Ty was still laughing.<br />
<br />
I threw myself on my bed and tried to sort things out.  Was this punishment for making fun of Ty?  Truthfully, deep down inside, I always envied Ty.  He was younger and much smaller than me.  I had always been tall and big, and I realized that I would only get taller and bigger.  I felt like I was growing up too fast, and I had dreamed of switching bodies with Ty.  It would be nice to be younger, have less pressures and responsibilities.  It would be interesting to be really short for a day.  Maybe that's why I always picked on Ty--becuase I wanted to be him.  So wait, then, was this my wish coming true in a way?  Well, it definitely wasn't as smooth a transition as I would have liked, but I am smaller again.  A small smile slowly shaped on my face.  Maybe, I thought, this won't be so bad.<br />
<br />
After a long time of looking at myself, I finally came to some sort of acceptance of my new body.  Or I guess my old body, the way it was three years ago.  Anyway, I was feeling uncomfortable in these too big clothes, especially the underwear, so I decided to try some of Ty's.  I peeked in his room and saw he wasn't there, so I ran to his drawer and started looking for underwear.  Just then, Ty stepped in, acting like he was watching the greatest comedy ever.</p>
