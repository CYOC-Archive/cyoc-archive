<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author’s note:  This chapter is dedicated to mombab, and I’ve also <br />
tried to stay true to the same theme I had with my wrestler post.  Let <br />
me know what you think!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess I'll be a high school soccer player,&quot; Andy said, &quot;Might as <br />
well be creative.&quot; The amulet on his chest glowed brightly for several <br />
seconds, then subsided.<br />
*****************<br />
<br />
Across town, Mitch had just settled down at his desk when an uneasy <br />
feeling swept through him.  He felt completely out of place…like he <br />
needed to be out running in a field. His body was pulsing with energy, <br />
and he couldn’t keep his mind focused on his work.  Instead of his <br />
presentation, he thought about how stuffy it felt in the office, and <br />
how he longed to be outside making a few goals for his team.  What? <br />
Mitch thought, a bit uncertain.  I don’t have a team…But he couldn’t <br />
shake the uneasy feeling that he was out of place in the office…That <br />
this wasn’t where he belonged.  He got up to head toward the <br />
conference room, but found his body moving in a different direction, <br />
toward the elevator that led to the main lobby and outside.  He was <br />
able to get control of himself before he reached the elevator, and ran <br />
into the bathroom nearby.<br />
<br />
He looked at himself in the mirror.  He was young!  Not ridiculously <br />
young, but definitely not his face.  He looked like a teenager!  <br />
What’s going on? He thought.  He splashed some water in his face, <br />
thinking that he must be in some sort of dream, but looking up in the <br />
mirror again, the young teenage face stared back at him.  His hair <br />
grew longer and darker, turning from a light brown to a dark black.  <br />
His skin began to tan, from the hours that he had spent playing in the <br />
hot sun.  He looked strange: a young teenage guy in a business suit.  <br />
His hair stopped growing in the front right above his eyebrows, and <br />
grew shaggy in the back covering the top of his collar.  His formerly <br />
straight hair was now wavy and a bit messy, as if he had purposely not <br />
combed it when he had awakened that morning.<br />
<br />
He started to back up, trying to think of some excuse that he could <br />
pass off for his total change of body.  Before he could continue out <br />
the door, however, he was shocked to see his suit jacket and tie <br />
completely disappear. His dress shirt was changing…the collar <br />
shrinking into the neck of the shirt while the sleeves pulled <br />
themselves up his arms, stopping about halfway up his upper arm.  He <br />
could see that his arms matched his face in the dark tan, but they had <br />
lost quite a bit of their hairiness.  The shirt started to change <br />
color from white to a lime green color, except for a brilliant blue <br />
streak that started at the bottom of the sleeves and worked its way <br />
down on both sides of his stomach.  The fabric changed to a polyester <br />
blend, perfect for wicking the sweat away during an intense game.  The <br />
buttons on the shirt merged as the lime green color finished in the <br />
center of his chest, with the Adidas name and logo appearing where his <br />
top button had been.  The word “Knights” appeared on the fabric across <br />
his chest, and the number “6” appeared underneath it.  On the back, a <br />
larger number “6” had appeared, with “Zanden” written across the back <br />
between his shoulders.  His nice white button down shirt was now a <br />
green and blue soccer jersey.  <br />
<br />
A soccer player?! Mitch though to himself.  I have no idea how to play <br />
soccer!  But the more he thought about it, the more it seemed <br />
perfectly natural.  Of course he was a great soccer player.  He had <br />
been playing for years, since he was a little kid.  He was the star <br />
forward for his high school soccer team!  Wait, that wasn’t right.  He <br />
was a businessman, wasn’t he?  He couldn’t get a hold of his thoughts…<br />
they kept running back and forth between his old and new <br />
personalities.<br />
<br />
While Mitch struggled to get a hold on himself, his pants started to <br />
change.  The slacks worked their way up his legs, revealing tanned <br />
legs to match the rest of his body.  His leg hair had lessened a bit, <br />
but there was still quite a bit, much darker than it had been before.  <br />
The legs of his pants stopped about a quarter of the way up his <br />
calves, where the fabric loosened slightly, changing to the matching <br />
polyester blend as his shirt.  The button and zipper disappeared <br />
completely, as the waist changed to an elastic drawstring.  The color <br />
changed from black to the same lime green as his jersey, except for <br />
the blue stripe, which continued down the side of the shorts.  The <br />
Adidas name logo appeared halfway down the stripe on his right calf.  <br />
He felt a heat expanding from his boxers, and pulled back elastic <br />
waistband to see that his boxers where changing into black compression <br />
shorts.  The fabric tightened around his groin, and continued down his <br />
legs stopping above his knees.  The compression shorts showed off his <br />
fairly hung package pretty well, which hadn’t seemed to shrink at all <br />
in the change.  The Adidas name and logo once again appeared in the <br />
compression shorts, halfway up his left thigh.  Damn, he thought to <br />
himself.  Our school must have gotten a pretty good deal from Adidas!  <br />
But then, as he thought about it, he realized that he had always been <br />
a huge Adidas fan.  After all, no one knew soccer better than Adidas.  <br />
They were the ones who provided all the stuff for the major leagues…<br />
<br />
Mitch let go of the waistband of his shorts and stared at himself in <br />
the mirror.  The old Mitch was almost completely gone, but he was <br />
fighting as hard as he could to stay in control.  He was, however, <br />
fighting a losing battle.  The last bit of the transformation began, <br />
as his socks started to change to cotton, turning a blue color and <br />
making their way up his legs, stopping just below the knee.  As the <br />
socks changed fabric, they also changed color, much to the old Mitch’s <br />
dismay, into a green color similar to the same color as his jersey.  <br />
Three white stripes appeared across the top, and of course, the Adidas <br />
name and logo appeared halfway up the leg of the sock, pushed outward <br />
by the newly formed shin guards underneath his sock.  He could feel <br />
the strap around the back of his calf, keeping the shin guards in <br />
place.  The final transformation began as his leather shoes began to <br />
change to microfiber.  The color changed to match the same color as <br />
the blue on his jersey, except for a black flap which grew across the <br />
laces and had the Adidas name and logo on it.  Pairs of white ovals <br />
began to appear on the front of the shoe, and made their way to the <br />
outer sides.  One pair changed to a red color about halfway down the <br />
side of his shoe.  The back of his shoe had three white lines across <br />
the top half, where the new sole appeared see-through on the bottom <br />
half.  Four black studs grew out of the back bottom of each of his <br />
shoes, whereas six more studs pushed their way out of the front bottom <br />
of each shoe, three on each side.  Three stripes appeared on the <br />
opposite side of the ovals, with the words “F50” appearing in black <br />
above them.  The words “Sprint Skin” appeared in tiny letters in the <br />
front of the shoes, and the word “Tunit” appeared on the tongues of <br />
both shoes.  Mitch’s expensive leather dress shoes were now a blue <br />
pair of Adidas F50i Tunit cleats.<br />
<br />
Mitch looked around the bathroom.  Where was he?  This definitely <br />
wasn’t East High…He had some vague memory of a presentation or <br />
something…Maybe it was for a big soccer match later?  That seemed to <br />
be right.  After all, Mitch Zanden was the star soccer player of East <br />
High School.</p>
