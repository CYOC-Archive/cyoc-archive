<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is just another possible branch idea I had</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That night they let Samantha and Chiffon know about their plans on moving in as well with them. To their minor surprise, Samantha had already bought the place even before they called because she &quot;knew they couldn&#39;t resist coming along, as it was partially an excuse to get a private space for the four of them to be as obscenely perverse in as they wanted to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now they were spending their second night alone together. Jen and Rachel didn&#39;t stop their love making except for the brief bounce from the shower to their bedroom. The good thing about Jen being able to turn her torso around over 180 degrees comfortably, was that it made kissing extremely easy. Currently, Rachel was breast feeding Jen with her middle breast. And Jen was eagerly drinking from it, as the milk was one of the best things she had ever tasted in her life. Specifically milk from that boob. Not that Rachel&#39;s arm/hand boob&#39;s milk didn&#39;t taste pretty good, but it was incomparable to the milk from the center boob. Center boob milk was just on a completely different level.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are kind of like my newborn baby when you are like this Jen&quot; joked Rachel as she stroked Jen&#39;s hair, leaving behind trails of milk to run down it&#39;s length as the milk emptied from out of her finger tips. They had made 2 more curse edits since the shower. The first made Rachel&#39;s milk evaporate cleanly, leaving nothing behind nor making things all sticky/&quot;chalky&quot; as Jen had put it. The second change was Rachel making Jen&#39;s tongue long enough to wrap fully around her head and back into her mouth. This was so she can clean herself easier than by using her hands as napkins when she eats. This one was extended to the rest of the world&#39;s bouncerbutts too, and only the two of them know it. Not even Sam or Chiffon were included. Well, Chiffon already had a really long tongue anyways from an earlier curse, so it didn&#39;t really matter anyways. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jen, Transform or Dare, and pick transform please.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, Transform me.&quot; Answered Jen, who went right back to suckling out the delicious milk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, for your transformation, your arms will move down until they are on your ass, and will turn into wings. They will still be made of tentacles, but be shaped as a pair of bird wings and not human arms and hands. Your body will then become covered in feathers that are both soft and warm, but not enough to make either of us uncomfortable. They also will be very pretty. And while they will not be able to lift you up off of the ground, unfolding your wings while in the air will let you glide and descend a fair bit slower. Your laughter will now sound closer to a bird&#39;s chirp than a horse&#39;s neigh. Other birds will not be bothered by your presence, and also my presence, but only as long as I am riding on top of you. Also, only the two of us, Samantha, and Chiffon will know something is different, and everyone else will think you have always looked like this ever since becoming a bouncerbutt.&quot; Explained Rachel.<br />
<br />
Jen paused her drinking as the changes took place. After giving her new form a look, Jen chirped happily &quot;Chirp chirp, I look like that fluffy bird from that one game! This is so cool!&quot; Besides her head and breasts, everywhere else was covered in blonde colored feathers that matched her hair color perfectly. Rachel could feel how warm they were and laughably found out that if she stood up, then a bald patch was revealed where her butt contacts and conformed to Jen&#39;s ass&#39;s shape. But some surrounding plumage quickly shifts over to covers it up and hide it from sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, how do you feel?&quot; Asked Rachel curiously. <br />
<br />
Jen immediately began listing off everything she was currently feeling. &quot;Warm, and soft, and fluffy, and horny, and happy, and full, and...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok ok, I get the picture. Now, one of those isn&#39;t like the rest. And that is that I know how to fix horny.&quot; Rachel sat back down and wrapped her legs once again around Jen&#39;s waist. She adjusted her heel length, pushed the soles of her feet together, and formed her now 11 inch long cock. Then while she began making out yet again with Jen, who still was turned back around and facing her, plunged her cock straight down into Jen&#39;s inviting pussy, which was still in front of her body. Jen, not expecting the sudden deep penetration, squawked into Rachel&#39;s mouth before she started chirping and singing in utter euphoria. Rachel was struggling too, as the feeling all 11 inches of her massive cock penetrating Jen&#39;s pussy, was directly transferred over to her as well. She couldn&#39;t think of anything that would be able to ever top the feeling of both simultaneously being penetrated and doing the penetrating. It was feeling 2 people&#39;s worth of pleasure at once. Jen began to giddily flap her wings rapidly around in ecstacy, as she couldn&#39;t think of anything else to do. <br />
<br />
It was rather interesting to see her wings unfurled. Jen&#39;s tentacles made up the &quot;bone&quot; structure, and what apparently was a retractable webbing that was covered in matching feathers, joined them all together. It was like a feather coated bat wing in a way. <br />
<br />
Rachael&#39;s cock was once again expelled from Jen&#39;s pussy with such a force that she again got her feet stuck in between Jen&#39;s bountaful cleavage, as their combined cum splattered all over the floor and the underside of Jen&#39;s boobs. Since Rachel&#39;s cock just hooked into her pussy through tubes that ran the full length of her legs and down her heel cock, she couldn&#39;t inseminate Jen, as she did not have the sperm to do it with. Instead she basically just shot her own collection of pussy juices and cum right out through her heel cock and into Jen. Rachel&#39;s actual pussy didn&#39;t even spill a drop either, as everything went right to her cock whenever she orgasmed, leaving her with just a somewhat damper than normal pussy. <br />
<br />
Rachel fell backwards, completely spent, amd panting heavily. &quot;Damn I am so tired now.&quot; She said as Jen also agreed. They quickly cleaned up the mess, only to have Rachel become thourally exhausted and lay down on top of Jen&#39;s feather coated booty. Jen leaned down next to her as well. Rachel didn&#39;t even bother getting into her bed, and just made sure Jen was properly hooked into her pipe before falling asleep right there on top her ass. Jen of course, as she usually sleeps now on her ass, was very much ok with this and just laid down right besides her rider girlfriend and fell asleep too. And even though Rachel was completely naked, Jen&#39;s feathers kept her comfortably warm. <br />
<br />
So comfortable, that they slept in until it was almost 10:30am. &quot;So much for being an early bird huh?&quot; Joked Rachel after checking the clock.</p>
