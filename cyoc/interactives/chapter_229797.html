<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sniffing, his lip quivering, and wiping the tears that had streamed down his cheeks from the half-hearted insult Jen had said to him, Kyle immediately went toward the fridge, taking the milk and pouring himself a bowl of cereal, despite already having eaten a large breakfast of eggs, bacon and toast that morning. He plopped down in the kitchen chair, hungrily mowing down his cereal... followed by another bowl... and another. &quot;That bitch, Jen... I&#39;ll have to get her back somehow...&quot;  he thought to himself as he dumped the last of the cereal into his mouth directly from the box, crumbs cascading over his front. The curse began to take effect on his ass, already starting to swell and plump in his pants as nearly every ounce of what he ate was transferred into fat on his butt, hips and thighs, until his crack was just over the top of his waistband.<br />
<br />
&quot;KYLE! Look at the mess you&#39;ve made! And the bus is here, you need to get moving now, mister pigbutt!&quot; his mother chastised him as she entered the room, looking at the empty milk carton and crumbs of cereal all over her son, which he was still hungrily licking off his shirt, though the moment she had called a piggy he immediately choked, his face screwing up as he started immediately to blubber like a baby. Kyle&#39;s mom, Martha, rolled her eyes as her son began to cry. &quot;Oh please calm down, it wasn&#39;t even that rude...&quot; she said as he ran out of the room, red faced and embarrassed, out to where the bus was waiting for him.<br />
<br />
He kept sniveling for a few minutes before calming down again, taking his seat on the bus and plucking some dried gum off the seat in front of him, eagerly chewing it down and swallowing it before hunting for any more. A bunch of other students saw this, but were way too weirded out by it to say anything, just pointing and snickering at the slobby kid covered in crumbs, eating nasty old gum from under the seat. One of the kids, David, had brought a banana on the bus, and had planned on throwing the peel away once he got in to school, but upon seeing the weirdo Kyle seated across from him, gave Dave an idea. While Kyle was bent over, feeling around as far as he could under the seat for any more tidbits to snack on, Davey slipped the banana peel onto the seat right next to Kyle without him noticing. All eyes within rows were on Kyle now, everyone wondering what the weird kid would do with the banana peel, though David had a pretty good guess, snickering to himself. <br />
<br />
Kyle sighed, sitting up, dejected swallowing the last piece of old hard gum he had found, rubbing his belly as he wondered what he would be having for lunch that day. Glancing to his left, he spotted the yellow banana peel and immediately snatched it, starting to chow down on the crunchy, stringy, bitter peel. He knew he should dislike the bitter taste, but he shoveled the whole peel into his mouth and swallowed, belching after. The kids around him all started laughing and pointing at Kyle. &quot;Wow, nice breakfast, fatass!&quot; one of the kids shouted, immediately triggering Kyle to blush hard and stammer back &quot;Sh-shut up! It is NOT FAT! I&#39;M NOT FAT!&quot; he near screamed before sobbing into his hands again, crying the rest of the way to school before running off the bus before anyone else, having to pull up his pants multiple times as his much larger ass kept jiggling up and out of it.<br />
<br />
Once at school, Kyle quickly hurried to his home room, constantly fussing with his pants, but not before stopping at the vending machine and spending every dollar he had in his pocket on chips, cookies, and everything else he could afford, immediately opening and eating them through the day. Through first period he had to be told multiple times to stop snacking and making noise, and in second period, the girl sitting next to him had a juice box, which he immediately grabbed from her and drank when she wasn&#39;t looking. Lunch was a similar story, Kyle almost going crazy on the lunch line as he tried to pile his tray with food before being forced away by a teacher. As he immediately went to work on the tray, his pants creaked, his rump swelling with every bite. Once he had finished, there was effectively no room left in his pants, his thick ass having totally filled the fabric, sticking out behind him and sloping downward like a shelf almost, so far that as someone passed behind him, they accidently grazed his rump with their hand.<br />
<br />
Kyle jerked his head around and screamed &quot;STOP TOUCHING MY ASS!&quot;, completely inappropriately at the top of his lungs, every head in the cafeteria turning to stare as Kyle grew red in the face. Turning back to his now-empty tray, Kyle tried to get a grip on himself, but found himself getting a grip on his neighbors tray of food, yarding it away from him and just starting to eat some one else&#39;s lunch as his ass continued to grow, starting to tear at the seams. Eventually lunch finished, the unlucky kid next to Kyle going hungry, too scared about the screaming porker to do anything but just watch him constantly, hungrily eat. He kept watching Kyle as he left the cafeteria as well, spying the large, almost womanly ass bobbing over a trashcan before Kyle pulled himself out, eating an old brown apple core he had found at the bottom.<br />
<br />
Making his way to class was a new adventure for Kyle with his much larger ass. It seemed like half the school was determined to touch and rub it in some way, and the other half was going to comment about it. He kept turning to yell at people as they passed by, shouting to keep their hands off his ass, only for someone else to playfully slap it on the way by, the act making Kyle let out a suddenly slutty moan as his cock surged to attention. Someone had just slapped his ass in public and in addition from being absolutely embarrassed, he was now starting to get turned on by it, the curse working its effects. His ass jiggled as he walked to his last classes of the day, wedging himself into his desk/chair combination, having to stifle pleasured whimpers whenever anyone poked, prodded, or otherwise messed with his increasingly colossal rear. His hips already were wider than his shoulders, and as he left school, he swore he felt the doorframe brush both sides of his rump. He was sure he felt it when he got on the bus, the doors much thinner as he huffed, dragging them inside. Getting to the aisle, he froze, staring at the empty back seat and fully packed bus between him at it. He gulped, and began to walk.<br />
<br />
Immediately he whimpered as he felt his ass rub on someone&#39;s shoulder, the person shifting away but it was still a touch, enough to make him shiver and squeak, his dick giving another twitch and throb as he got rock hard again, and that was just from one person! The next stop had his pendulous cheek slide over the pleather, squishing tightly together before plowing into the next person, making Kyle cover his mouth to keep from moaning. This continued for 10 more rows, though around the mid way point he had stopped bothering to cover his mouth, openly and sluttily moaning and whimpering as he lumbered his way into every single student sitting in the aisle seats until he finally collapsed on the last seat, his ass spreading out underneath him, a good foot of jiggling asscheek bulging out to each side as Kyle tried to hide the pre-soaked boner he was now sporting from so many people touching his ass in such quick succession. <br />
<br />
Getting off the bus was easier, there were less students, but just before he got off, someone reached around and swatted his ass hard, making Kyle scream but not in embarrassment this time. His already leaking cock lurched and unloaded in his jeans, Kyle cumming hard from a random, unknown classmate swatting his huge, fat, jiggling ass as he stumbled off the bus, collapsing onto the grass on his hands and knees, ass sticking up in the air as he panted, collecting himself as he casually drew a mouthful of grass up with him, munching it down as he headed inside home, wedging in the front door a moment before squeezing through.</p>
