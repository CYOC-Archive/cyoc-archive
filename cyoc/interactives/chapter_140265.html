<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The moment Karen Charleston left to continue her fact finding tour, her mother Nichole did something she swore she would never do. Snoop in her daughter&#39;s bedroom like her mother did whenever Nichole was out.<br />
Her mother&#39;s actions were usually questionable at best, but Nichole was doing it with a specific purpose, to read the were handbook Town Chancellor Samantha Twist left for herself without anyone or anything to distract her.<br />
Nichole was afraid that she might have to search for it, which would run the risk of Karen discovering someone had been in her room, but the book was sitting in plain sight right on top of Karen&#39;s bed.<br />
She sat down on the edge of the bed and started reading, noting that the last copyright (and surprised there was one) was way out of date.<br />
There was a brief intro into weres and their societal structure in general, with promises to discuss each species in more detail within the individual listings.<br />
What made Nichole stop reading was discovering the passage concerning how a normal human being could be inducted into were society.<br />
<br />
<i>Even if a person is accidentally bitten or scratched, they still need to have sex with the were who infected them to complete their first transformation!</i><br />
Nichole wasn&#39;t happy about that, considering all they had been through because of the Gambonis and one man&#39;s crazed obsession with Karen. Their daughter was still a virgin, and part of the mother within her was hoping that Karen would stay that way until her wedding night, no matter how old fashioned that sounded.<br />
She did have mixed feelings when she read further on. <i>Because of their increased fertility, were females have to take a specific birth control pill especially formulated for their species every day unless they want to have children.</i> Nichole wasn&#39;t sure the handwriting was Karen&#39;s, but was happy to see that somebody had underlined EVERY DAY with a blue pen.<br />
<i>I&#39;ve had Karen on birth control for a while now to help regulate her periods, even before this whole mess with the Gambonis started, so the concept won&#39;t be new to her.</i><br />
Yet the passages about a were&#39;s increased sex drive and libido did give her pause. <i>Moe and I haven&#39;t been truly intimate with each other since...</i> recalling what Francine said about how great her sex life was since becoming a were. <i>I wonder...</i><br />
<br />
Then Nichole shook her head in an attempt to clear it before moving on.<br />
After all the whys and wherefores concerning when and where someone could publicly display their fursona, the section highlighting the various species began.<br />
On the left of each page was a picture of a male were, with his female counterpart on the right.<br />
There was various statistics for each member, but Nichole just stared at the images as she turned the pages.<br />
At first she was just flipping through them, quickly scanning each out of curiosity. Nichole never noticed when she went back to the beginning of the photo section and started taking longer looks at each picture.<br />
Everyone looked like they had just walked off the cover of some high fashion magazine.<br />
The men were big, strong, and virile.<br />
The women curvy and busty.<br />
&quot;You know. I think you&#39;d look fantastic furry,&quot; Nichole heard a voice say.<br />
<br />
Shocked, she looked around, but there was no one in the room. A quick glance out the window revealed that her husband hadn&#39;t come home yet from making arrangements to reopen Moe&#39;s Pizzeria, and Karen would yell that she was home upon reentering the house.<br />
Assured that she was still alone, Nichole chalked the voice up to stress and resumed going through the guide book.<br />
Instead of being a distraction; the fur, tails, and other distinguishing characteristics of each were became more attractive as Nichole continued looking.<br />
<i>The men are so huge,</i> she observed, when a picture included showing a male were in the midst of being aroused. <i>I&#39;m surprised the women can handle all that as easily, as willingly, as this book claims.</i><br />
Foxes, canines, felines (<i>Well, I can see what has piqued Karen&#39;s curiosity,</i>) aquatic based (<i>mermaids are real???</i>), and varieties Nichole never even dreamed existed were all on display before her.<br />
Nichole was so lost in thought (and maybe something else), that it wasn&#39;t until she felt the tips of her fingers grow wet that she came back to reality.<br />
At first she wasn&#39;t sure what was going on.<br />
Then Nichole was shocked to discover that she had placed her free hand within her panties and was fingering herself!<br />
Disgusted with herself for doing such a thing (or at least, for doing such a thing within her child&#39;s bedroom), Nichole threw the book down on the bed and left the room, not realizing that it and the bedroom door remained open.<br />
<br />
AS NICHOLE LEFT KAREN&#39;S BEDROOM, Moe Charleston returned.<br />
He was happy to be back on the road to reopening his pizza parlor, unaware that doing so had told the Gambonis where his family was hiding.<br />
He excitedly entered the house, wanting to share the good news with everyone, but couldn&#39;t find anybody.<br />
A quick search soon led to Karen&#39;s room.<br />
Not seeing anyone within, Moe was about to leave when he spotted the open guidebook on Karen&#39;s bed.<br />
Curious, he picked it up and started looking at the pictures.<br />
Seeing all the various male weres didn&#39;t do anything for him, but the ladies...<br />
He turned from one image to the next, each woman at least as beautiful as the last, if not more so.<br />
Slowly becoming aware of the discomfort in his pants, Moe paused his look through the guidebook when he heard a sound coming from his bedroom.<br />
He tossed the book on Karen&#39;s bed. While not exactly how his daughter left it, at least it was closed now as Moe went to find his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nichole?&quot; he asked, coming into their bedroom.<br />
His wife had just come out of their bathroom after having to change panties.<br />
Although she was still fully dressed from the waist up, there was something about seeing Nichole standing there and his current state of need that made Moe rush into her arms and fervently kiss her.<br />
With her own unsettled state of mind, Nichole passionately returned the kiss.<br />
The couple was lost in the moment as their tongues danced in each other&#39;s mouth.<br />
Their hands weren&#39;t idle either, as each hastily undressed the other.<br />
Soon man and wife were wrestling together on top of their blanket covered bed, longing to satisfy the burning need each felt.<br />
Moe felt his hard penis sink deeply into Nichole&#39;s hungry cunt as she locked her legs around him, urging him to new heights of passion with each thrust.<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before they reached the proverbial point of no return as they both climaxed simultaneously.<br />
Nichole anointed his cock with her bountiful cream as Moe flooded her pussy with his semen.<br />
Spent, the two collapsed in each others arms and just laid together in bed, holding each other close, as thoughts of both themselves and their partner as various weres crossed their respective minds.<br />
<br />
