<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;My God! What&#39;s happening to me?&quot; You say. &quot;I didn&#39;t have this much hair on me back then, before I was attacked by that fox.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madam Lutulla gives you an appraising look, &quot;A fox you say?&quot; You nod as you soon rub your fully haired like cheek area. You feel your muscles twitching as your clothes begin to feel a bit tight. &quot;I don&#39;t think that was just a fox, exactly.&quot; She says and turns away.<br />
<br />
Madam walks into her storeroom, leaving you to contemplate with your changes as You look into the shop&#39;s full length mirror. Your hair, well, fur now was a rich reddish orange color for fuller than it&#39;s ever been. You notice the wound that was once there has healed up without leaving such a trace of a scar behind. You also notice your chest hair was starting to peek out from above your collar, yet it was strange to see something so bright as snow to be a white color as the backs of your hands were now covered in a dense coating of black manly hairs.<br />
<br />
The bulge in your pants seems to be growing too. You gently pull at the waistband for it was now tight due to your added layer of muscle, but you do manage to take a peek at your bits and pieces because it&#39;s almost even with the waistband of your tighty whiteys. You look down between your legs for you see an usual cockhead in your pants as it looked more canine peeping out of a sheath hole. you had to guess that you&#39;ve grown a good four inches in length. All the things you notice for you even noticed the start of a puffy red tail with it being tipped with in white fur, yet you fail to notice that Madam Lutulla was standing not two feet from you as you admire your little friends.<br />
<br />
She gently clears up her throat, signalling that she was there that this made you blush. you quickly hide up your things for you were somewhat embarrassed at being caught checking out your package, your body, even your cute fuzzy tail. if it wasn&#39;t for the fur on your face, you&#39;d be redder than a plump red tomato.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, drink this.&quot; She says handing you a small vial of a glowing green potion. You think the color is rather pretty for it was like a green glow stick, except a very deep greenish color.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does it do? Will it change me back?&quot; you say, surprised by your new stunning voice for it sounded like Kevin Costner from the 90&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;sort of. you see, It will give you control over your eventual form. as for it to changing you back, no, it won&#39;t do that.&quot; Madam Lutulla said that A look of terror fills your face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean that, I&#39;m going to be stuck like this for the fest of my life? I&#39;m also gonna be turned into a beast, just like the one that clawed and attacked me?&quot; you said, almost in a point of denial of what you were hearing that Madam Lutulla rolls her eyes as she sighs and explains this in the way adults explain to children who stubbornly refuse to get the point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. your stuck. you&#39;re a werefox from now on, but from what I witnessed coming out of the storeroom that I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to be terribly disappointed by your new changes. and yes, you&#39;re going to turn into a beast like the one that clawed and attacked you. Now you&#39;ll be fine, just as long as you drink that up. You won&#39;t be able change randomly when you smell chicken for when you get hungry, catch the scent of a wandering fox near by, nor get angry because of someone who took something from you. So please, do drink up, you&#39;re already shedding on my floor.&quot; she said, seeing that you were still scared to start shedding more.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about a cure? can it be undone?&quot; you rumble in a now bass voice as buttons pop on your flannel shirt, revealing a thick mat of white chest fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear,&quot; She says with a touch of pity, patting your furry cheek gently. &quot;I&#39;m afraid that there is no cure. I&#39;m terribly sorry about all this, but you&#39;re a volpinthrope now as you&#39;re just going to have to live with this. also that if you don&#39;t drink the potion within the next ten minutes, you&#39;ll have no control over that form as you&#39;ll have no memory of what happens next time. it will also take decades for you to gain a level of control for The potion only works during your first transformation as you&#39;re starting to change to much. so if I were you, please, be a good chap and do drink up!&quot; She says, folding her arms over her chest while waiting for you to comply.<br />
<br />
Your hands were now becoming paws with opposable thumbs as you uncork the vial. You look at yourself in the mirror and see that you&#39;re well on your way to being a full form werefox as your nose is broadening and blackening, your ears are triangularing while growing furry. fox fangs began pushing out your human teeth while your face was also being stretched out to form a muzzle. In a desperation attempt that you chug down the vial&#39;s contents. It had a musky odor to its flavor for it was just like what you&#39;d imagine it would be &#39;wet fox&#39; for its taste, with just a hint of berries and egg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uugh! That&#39;s nasty!&quot; You say. &quot;it Tastes like you just dipped a fox&#39;s paw into a minted tea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re not far off. you see, one of the main ingredients is werefox fur.&quot; Madame says with a chuckle. &quot;Have a look in the mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
You take a look back at yourself for You watch as the fangs recede that your nose and mouth regains its human shape and color. your ears, as the rest of you drop out of your fox fur that it now leaves you taller, stockier, hairier, and with a quick glance at your package a more generous bulge than the one you had. All in all, you decide you&#39;re probably better off than you were. You flex your muscles and hear the fabrics rip. The seams of your flannel give up around the arms and legs as the last button pops off, revealing your hairy tight ab belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;WOW! You did it! I&#39;m human again!&quot; you say in your booming voice, a huge grin parting your musculus cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I didn&#39;t. You just have full control over your shapeshifting forms. you&#39;re not human, not any more. however, you&#39;re welcome all the same.&quot; She says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh… You wouldn&#39;t happen to have…&quot; you began to start saying, while indicating her to your torn off shirt. Madame Lutella sternly gives you a look that tells you she doesn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it look like I stock clothing around here, let alone anything that could be used for a new six and a half... maybe to seven foot tall Werefoxes?&quot; She says as you look around her potions and ingredients shop to see nothing of the sorts.<br />
<br />
You grin sheepishly, doing your best to tuck in your shirt to cover your naked belly and chest. &quot;Uh… no. I suppose not. still though, how much do I uh... owe you for the potion?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;ah... don&#39;t worry about it. this one&#39;s on the house. because you&#39;ve left me most of some ingredients for a replacement potion with your shed off fur on the floor, and then some. considering that I’m cutting you a deal for it would cost you $50.00 mundane, or $35.00 mythic. I would of gave you a discount of $20.00 mundane and $15.00 mythic, but your ingredients will pay off more then your share of payment.&quot; she said as she points to the fur you had shed off while you were changing back.<br />
<br />
&quot;if you like though, I can take Visa, Mastercard, Majika Express, and Discover Card for your first perches. but I do not accept personal checks. my dear, not a lot of people will actually take a check these days.&quot; she says, with a grin.<br />
<br />
she then draws you out a map to a tailor further in the forest who she says that can sell you some clothes to fit your needs while marking it there. she also explained for if you were to willingly pay extra, or do a favor for the tailor that he&#39;ll likely offer you a couple of magical clothing in which can expands with you as you change. She also recommends you to talk things out with the forest ranger about a job as you were most likely to have trouble of finding one in the &#39;mundane world&#39; that will accommodate a werefoxes needs. She shortly after marks the ranger station on to your map.<br />
<br />
seeing as you were all set to go, you thanked her and was ready enough to leave the shop. With that, you...</p>
