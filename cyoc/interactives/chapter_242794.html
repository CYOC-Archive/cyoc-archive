<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the mortal world now scrambled to deal with the Seraphim, other supernatural realms attempted to strengthen their bonds in the face of the crisis. In the case of the kitsune and vampire realms, it meant a diplomatic meeting with the Tepes family.<br />
<br />
This was how Fukushu now found himself within the vampire realm. Kiko, Fukushu&#39;s sister, and Kari were tasked with opening the lines of dialogue with the Tepes family. With the relationship between Aaron Harris and Nyx Tepes only growing stronger, both families felt that quicker communication was needed, as well closer diplomatic ties. After all, the daughter of the Tepes Lord and the grandson of the Celestial Kitsune involved in a romantic relationship was indeed a reason for closer ties.<br />
<br />
Fukushu insisted on providing security for his sister and niece. Despite a solid relationship between the two realms, the nine tail was always cautious. History showed that diplomatic journeys could end in tragedy, even with close allies. Fukushu witnessed this personally with the Kumiho. If something were to occur, Fukushu could quickly escape with the diplomats. None, save Dracula, posed a realistic threat to Fukushu.<br />
<br />
As Kiko and Kari now spoke, Fukushu took the opportunity to explore the grounds of the Tepes Manor. This was not the first visit to the realm of the vampires for Fukushu. However, during those visits, he rarely took the opportunity to appreciate the underrated beauty of the vampire realm.<br />
<br />
Despite the realm being blanketed in darkness, trees and flowers bloomed under a blood red moon. The skies were clear, the weather brisk yet comfortable. Within the gardens of the Tepes Manor lay flowers and plants the kitsune was unfamiliar with. Odd trees whose foliage reflected the subtle light, fountains of water that reflected the moon, the flowers a gorgeous yet muted color with a lovely aroma. Fukushu may have his biases towards the kitsune realm, but he couldn&#39;t deny the beauty of this realm cloaked in darkness.<br />
<br />
Turning a corner, the kitsune paused, noting a single figure in a meditative pose within the gardens. Dressed in a dark suit with blonde brown hair that nearly reaches his shoulders, Fukushu could see him raise his head towards the heavens; revealing the bandage that covered his eyes. This was Ken, the elite vampire and long time member of the Five. Slowly Fukushu now approached, confirming his suspicions as he noticed the katana layed out before the blind swordsman.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought I smelled something unfamiliar,&quot; Ken stated, his head still pointed towards the heavens. &quot;It was only a matter of time before the kitsune returned to our lands. I take it this is not a social call.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would be correct,&quot; Fukushu replied, the kitsune now standing beside the kneeling vampire, studying him carefully. Watching Ken carefully, he was surprised to see an American vampire now engaging in the meditative practices of a samurai.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is rare for my people to visit these lands,&quot; he said. &quot;Just as rare as finding an American vampire engaging in the meditative prayers of a samurai.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken chuckled softly, his fangs visible to the kitsune as he slowly made his way to his feet. The vampires katana now held tightly in his hand, the blade sheathed as he turned to face Fukushu.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I say,&quot; he grinned. &quot;I found a second life with Japan amongst the last of the samurai.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;ve heard,&quot; Fukushu replied. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind me asking, what brought an American to Japan? Especially in the 1870s?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The American Civil War,&quot; Ken replied, his smile faltering, his face becoming stoic. &quot;I served as a Captain in General Sherman&#39;s Army. The things I saw....they still haunt me...even without my eyes I can still see those battlefields. When the war concluded, when the President died, I was a shell of a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which brought you to our shores.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was in search of peace,&quot; Ken stated. &quot;Trade was only just beginning between America and Japan. My hope was to find peace in the countryside of your homeland. I found the samurai instead... and found purpose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As a gaijin swordsman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken laughed, nodding he now held his sheathed weapon in both hands. Despite Fukushu standing well over a foot taller than the vampire, Ken carried himself with a quiet confidence.<br />
<br />
&quot;As ridiculous as it sounds yes,&quot; Ken replied. &quot;My master saw the &#39;warriors spirit&#39; in me. It was an odd time within Japan. The samurai clung to the past as others looked towards the future. They surprisingly taught me their ways, creating a swordsman who had few equals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard,&quot; Fukushu said. &quot;By the time of your arrival the kitsune retreated into their own realm. I was one of the few who would continue visit the human realm. I witnessed the uprisings with the samurai, as well as their downfall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken nodded, the vampire quiet for a moment as he tilted his head towards the sky. &quot;My masters often spoke of the kitsune,&quot; he said softly. &quot;In fact, they set up a base of operations in Kumamoto Castle. I would have been there with them, if my eyes weren&#39;t taken the year before. The castle was constructed in 1598 if I&#39;m correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was,&quot; Fukushu replied. &quot;Following the war against the Kumiho. Humans referred to it as the war against Korea. The Emperor built it as a stronghold and fortress, but also as a home for my parents as a token of appreciation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that explains some of the architecture and statues,&quot; Ken chuckled. &quot;My masters spoke of the legends of the kitsune, but stated they were merely myth at this point. I was always curious though, why would you leave?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu now went quiet, training his vision upon the blood red moon. &quot;We had our reasons,&quot; he sighed. &quot;Our people had grown weary of humanity. Far too many kitsune suffered from man&#39;s actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get that,&quot; Ken replied. &quot;I was involved in some of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War. Hell, Vicksburg itself was the stuff of nightmares. Sometimes....people can be the cruelest creatures out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting phrase coming from a vampire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken chuckled, a wide smile forming on his face. &quot;You&#39;re one to talk,&quot; he said. &quot;The blood I spilled was in defense of the Union and my samurai masters. You? Heard about all your battles. Even now, you ain&#39;t one who believes in mercy. All who face the Dark Samauri shall know nothing but death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things change vampire,&quot; Fukushu growled. &quot;Do not think I have forgotten how you and the rest of your kind behaved under your previous lord. Wasn&#39;t it you and Ann who kidnapped the Harris girl before battling my apprentice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, so you&#39;re the one that trained Akira,&quot; Ken replied. &quot;That kitsune was on a mission. The amount of vampires he killed trying to reach the kid was legendary. He damn near did me in, same with Ann, which is something you don&#39;t see often. I can count on one hand the amount of individuals that have run afoul of Ann and lived to tell the tale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I one of those fortunate souls?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken paused, turning his head towards Fukushu. &quot;Didn&#39;t realize you ran into Ann.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your former master Miro approached me years ago,&quot; Fukushu replied. &quot;Wanted my help following the timeline war. Attempted to take the Voids under my control. Ann...stabbed me in the back. She was as quiet as a shadow as she drove her hand razors into my back. Needless to say, my beloved was none too pleased by her actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well don&#39;t leave me in suspense,&quot; Ken stated. &quot;Finish the story!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Abolith emerged from her hidden location,&quot; Fukushu said. &quot;Seperated Ann&#39;s hands at the wrist. Imagine my surprise when I observed Ann reattach them to her bloody stumps. It was....unnerving to say the least. Needless to say, my beloved has held a grudge since.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it that&#39;s why she wasn&#39;t on this little diplomatic trip?&quot; Ken asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;With the threat of this Seraphim I think it best to avoid any....diplomatic incidents,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;Tensions are strained. Rogue hunters have a tendency to unnerve the supernatural.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially when members of the royal family are involved,&quot; Ken finished, to which Fukushu nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ken!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu turned, raising an eyebrow as two vampires now entered the garden. The pair appeared young, the male and female seemingly close in age to his nieces and nephews. Their dress, however, was quite odd. The pair looking, in Fukushu&#39;s opinion, like thieves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prince Duncan, is that you?&quot; Ken replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prince Duncan?&quot; Fukushu asked in surprise.<br />
<br />
Duncan smirked, a confident step in his stride as he approached the nine tail kitsune. &quot;Huh, you&#39;re a lot bigger than I thought,&quot; he smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you are....far from what I would expect from royalty,&quot; Fukushu replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I get that a lot,&quot; Duncan grinned. Duncan&#39;s companion now cleared her throat, realizing her boyfriend had yet to introduce her. &quot;Shit where are my manners,&quot; Duncan said. &quot;This is Izzy. Princess Isabella to be precise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu raised an eyebrow, studying the pair carefully for a moment before turning towards Ken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there any reason they are dressed like smugglers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a new one,&quot; Izzy laughed. &quot;Don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been called a smuggler before. What are we smuggling Duncan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good question,&quot; Duncan mused. &quot;If we were smugglers, I&#39;d say we we&#39;re weapons smugglers. Maybe freedom fighters. Definitely not drugs, that&#39;s too low class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu groaned in frustration, this odd pair of young dhamphirs grinding on the kitsunes nerves. Sensing the kitsune&#39;s anger, Ken now stepped forward in order to address the young prince.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you come to tell us Prince Duncan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Duncan said with a mischievous smirk. &quot;Dad just finished talking with the kitsune. He wanted me to come find you. They were going to sit down for dinner.&quot; Duncan now glanced up at Fukushu, the kitsune already dreading what would come out of the young princess&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know if you want,&quot; Duncan grinned. &quot;I&#39;m sure me and Izzy to smuggle some food in you might like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure the general will be happy with whatever the cooks serve,&quot; Ken stated. &quot;We will be along shortly Prince Duncan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duncan nodded, offering a wave to Fukushu before he and Izzy vanished around the corner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that the future leader of the Tepes family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Prince Duncan is mischievous,&quot; Ken said. &quot;But, he is smart and quick witted. He simply chooses to...what do the kids say? Act like a smart-ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; Fukushu grumbled.<br />
<br />
Fukushu took a breath, the pair now making their way towards the dining room. The kitsune left to wonder what this future generation would become.</p>
