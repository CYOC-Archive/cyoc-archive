<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the next week Kyle had played with this magic power, exploring using toys in all of his lady parts, the first time he tried it he made a massive mistake, placing a vibrator in every one of his pussies, the orgy was unstoppable until the vibrators finally ran out of power an hour later. Still he had fun with it, he had decided by the following week that he&#39;d change his name to Kelly, which thrilled his mother to no end, she had always wanted a daughter. <br />
<br />
But as the month crawled on she found her mother&#39;s behavior a little disturbing, she stared at her daughter longingly, making comments like “You really make my legs look good.” and “If only I could have a body like yours.” It had been a small annoyance at first, but as time went on, Kelly found herself getting more and more self conscious of how she moved around her mother. Fortunately for Kelly, she only had the two friends, Jarred and Alex, she had already cursed them, so the curse didn&#39;t demand anymore usage from her. Unfortunately for Kelly, she was still the brash and kind of stupid girl she was when she was still normal old Kyle, and one morning she had enough.<br />
<br />
“Oh, what I wouldn&#39;t give to have a body like yours.” Her mother mused once more and Kelly finally snapped.<br />
<br />
“Well, I can do that for you.” Kelly said, she wasn&#39;t thinking about what she was doing yet.<br />
<br />
“Oh? How? What&#39;s your secret honey?” Her mom smiled.<br />
<br />
“Oh, it&#39;s just the town curse, you know T and D.” <br />
<br />
“Really? Well now I&#39;m interested.” <br />
<br />
“So...” Kelly recounted what had gotten him into this mess and his mother looked at her kinda shocked by what was coming out of her mouth. “And that&#39;s how I ended up like well, this.”<br />
<br />
“So, you used the curse, to punish a cheerleader, and then punish her a second time, and ended up with those extra legs? Kyle. I thought I raised you better than that. Really?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I&#39;m sorry for it now, but that&#39;s not the point I was making, I&#39;ve got the curse, so I can give you a body like mine if you want, that way you can enjoy it, instead of wishing for it.”<br />
<br />
“OH! I&#39;d love that!” She beamed, Kelly didn&#39;t know it yet but she was about to make a mistake.<br />
<br />
“Okay, Transform or dare?”<br />
<br />
“Transform” She smiled.<br />
<br />
“So for your transformation, you&#39;ll get a copy of my body from the neck down, including the extra long life, lack of disease and of course, the magic clothing stuff.” Kelly watched as her mother changed before her, her body growing younger and taller, breasts expanding as she played with them, finally it was finished. “There, now we match, mother and daughter.”<br />
<br />
“This does feel weird....” She walked experimentally around the table. “I like it, but you know, now that I know how you got this way, I have to punish you.”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I mean, all of that was pathetically mean spirited, and your friends will never be the same, although those perverts love it anyway, so that&#39;s a plus for them. But I can&#39;t let you just, get away with all of that, so Transform or Dare?” Kelly froze, why had she confessed all of that? How did she not see this coming? “Oh, honey.... you didn&#39;t answer in time,  now I have to give you both.”<br />
<br />
“Mom... please don&#39;t do anything crazy.” <br />
<br />
“What, you&#39;re already a big old freako, what&#39;s a little more?”<br />
<br />
“Please...”<br />
<br />
“So for your transformation, from your neck to your waist you&#39;ll turn back into you little male self, except for the tits, I want to see you have to deal with those and you don&#39;t deserve to have my voice with actions like yours. Then, just for the fun of it, you&#39;ll grow.... six more sets of my legs, as for you magic power, I&#39;m changing one little thing, any shoe that you conjure up will always have a seven inch heel, your feet will never be damaged by these, but they&#39;ll be the only footwear you can have, and since I&#39;m not cruel, you won&#39;t have to wear the heels in the house. But now, you&#39;ll have to go back to school like this, I want you to have the humiliation of being caught in public wearing such sexy heels, and the dress code at school will allow for those heels on you and you alone. As for your dare....” Kelly coudn&#39;t believe what she was hearing, but found her body changing, she was getting shorter, her skin paling a little, but the breasts were getting closer to her face. “You&#39;ll first pass the curse back to me, daring me to kiss you on the cheek, then you&#39;ll find Mrs. Smith, genuinely apologize to her the next time you see her, and bring her back here so I can fix what you broke.”<br />
<br />
Kelly stared down at her cleavage, the mountainous bust sitting on her chest now large on her original male frame, the bottoms of her breasts resting on the shelf of flesh in front of her, she felt her twelve new feet resting on the floor around her already odd anatomy. She shivered a little, she looked at her mom and muttered “Sorry mom, I really fucked up didn&#39;t I?”<br />
<br />
“That you did, but we&#39;re going to fix this. Now aren&#39;t you forgetting something?”<br />
<br />
“Oh.. Transform or Dare?”<br />
<br />
“Dare.”<br />
<br />
“I dare you to kiss me on the cheek.” Kelly&#39;s mom bent down and kissed her on the cheek, “Now, it&#39;s Saturday, you&#39;ve got today and tomorrow to learn to walk in those heels before school on Monday. I&#39;ll miss your help around the house, but I don&#39;t want you being a slouch. I suggest you get started by walking down to the convenience store and getting what&#39;s on this list.”<br />
<br />
Kelly started walking to the door, “Oh, and Kelly? I love you, and hey, you don&#39;t have the curse anymore, so this is probably the last time you change!” She beamed. Kelly feigned a smile as she conjured what she thought was going to be tennis shoes, but all 36 of her feet were clad in seven inch pin heel shoes, patterned in tennis shoe style, she felt her feet lift up, making her stand on her tip toes. She groaned audibly. “Oh come on honey, they look good on you, now get going, no time to waste.” <br />
<br />
Kelly went out the door and started carefully walking, the clacking of the heels on the pavement making it bitterly apparent that she was wearing them, the now much closer and comically large bust visibly jiggling with every step, “Damn it Kelly, why do you do these things to yourself?</p>
