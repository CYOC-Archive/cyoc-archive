<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex shifted into Chase’s human form and quickly pulled on the officer’s uniform.  As luck would have it, the back doors had a lock that was a little stubborn and the inexperienced rookie had a Hell of a time opening the door.  Alex, now in Chase’s form, heard the gruff voice of an older man say, <br />
<br />
“Here, just let me do it.” <br />
<br />
and the voice of a younger man, obviously the rookie, say “Sorry Sarge.”<br />
<br />
When the door opened Alex was greeted by the sight of a large man, easily 6’ 6”, he had a muscular build and a thick salt and pepper moustache.  His hair was cut in a classic flat-top that matched his moustache in color.  There was heavy stubble on his cheeks and chin.  Grey hair poked our over his shirt collar and his muscular forearms were decorated with what looked like very military old tattoos.  He growled at the rookie, “There, damn it, it’s open.  I’m going off duty in a minute and I suppose it’s just lucky for you that I stuck around.”  He looked into the back of the vehicle and his blue eyes widened.<br />
<br />
“Chase, what the fuck is that?” the Sarge said.<br />
<br />
“I dunno.”  Alex said in perfect imitation of Chase’s voice and inflections.  “Some sorta freak show, I’m thinkin’ and I had to ride with it all the way here.”<br />
<br />
The Sarge turned to the rookie and said, “Get a leash, animal control needs to take care of this mess.”<br />
<br />
While the rookie was gone the Sarge looked around to be sure no one was near and then leaned into the van and said, to Chase in a very soft rumble, “Well lover, looks like you got shit duty again.  You’re not too bruised up are you honey?  Those shit heads are still treating you like a rookie.”<br />
<br />
The Dogkey bark/brayed and the Sarge backed up a bit.<br />
<br />
“He ain’t dangerous, is he, love?”<br />
<br />
Alex realized he’d just stumbled upon his next victim.  The Sarge and Chase obviously had a thing goin’ and Alex could exploit that.<br />
<br />
“Nah, he seems to be real friendly, perhaps a bit too friendly.  I don’t know what he is, but he seems to be a mix of golden lab and donkey.  Some geneticist’s plaything, no doubt.  I call him a ‘Dogkey’… he’s kinda cute.”  Alex said.<br />
<br />
The Sarge was just about to lean in and grab a quick kiss from the man he thought was his lover when he heard the rookie return.<br />
<br />
The Sarge’s gruff voice and manner returned too, “Well I don’t give a fuck what the Raiders are doing this season, Chase, the Cowboys are gonna kick their ass out of the runnin’ long before the Superbowl.”<br />
<br />
Sarge winked at Chase/Alex and Alex smiled back and went with the ‘football’ talk.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, whatever Ol’ man, I still think they’re gonna take your Cowboys down.”<br />
<br />
The rookie put the leash around Chase now the ‘Dogkey’ and Chase followed the young man <br />
<br />
“So I clocked you out, you don’t have to go into the station.  Are you in the mood, honey?”  Sarge asked quietly, looking around.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I wanna go home and grab a bite to eat first.”  Alex said.<br />
<br />
“Well, hop in my truck; we can fuck at my place tonight.  I’ve got some leftover Chinese in the fridge.”  Sarge said.<br />
<br />
Alex read the name plate on the older man’s uniform while he was looking around, “William Blanchard” it read.<br />
<br />
“Well, let’s get outta here.  I’m all checked out and we can go.”  Sarge said as he took a cigar out of his left breast pocket.  He lit it and Alex followed him to his truck.<br />
<br />
“You ready buddy?”  Sarge grinned as he hit the auto unlock button.<br />
<br />
“Hell yeah Willie, I’m pretty desperate.”  Alex said as he got into the truck.<br />
<br />
Sarge gave Alex a look as he got into the truck, “Willie?  What that fuck is up with that?  You know I like to be called Bill.”  Sarge said and then he grinned as he puffed on his cigar, unless you’re callin’ me Big Bad Billy while I’m fillin’ you up.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but you’ll always be my Sweet William.” Alex said.<br />
<br />
The Sarge rolled his eyes and looked around the parking lot.  The truck was not in an area where the security monitors could see what he and ‘Chase’ were doing and it was dark enough so that no one could see without coming right up to the truck, plus the windows were dark tinted.  Sarge pulled on his cigar and put his mouth over Alex’s.  He shot-gunned the cigar smoke into Alex’s lungs and tongue wrestled with him as he did so.<br />
<br />
Sarge broke the kiss and said, “You’re gonna be my cigar boy soon enough.”  Alex fondled the big man’s crotch and found a very large rod between the man’s legs.<br />
<br />
Sarge drove them both to his place and soon, after finishing off the Chinese leftovers, the big man was lounging on his couch in his tighty whities.  He had a belly from a few too many doughnuts and the beer he liked, but the man was still in great shape, Alex thought.  His body was covered in hair and Alex was extremely excited.<br />
<br />
“Come here son and give your Big Bad Billy some lovin’” The Sarge growled out around his cigar.<br />
<br />
Alex smiled.  Like the Sarge he’d stripped down to his briefs just after dinner.<br />
<br />
“I want to try something new with you, honey.”  Alex said with Chase’s husky voice.<br />
<br />
“An’ what’s that?”  Billy asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, I wanna tie you up and blindfold you and….”  Alex left it hanging for Billy to pick up.<br />
<br />
“And?”  Billy said with a big grin around his cigar.<br />
<br />
“…and tonight, I wanna fuck you.”  Alex grinned.<br />
“Well,” Big Bad Billy said gruffly, “looks like my boy is growin’ up.  I told you it would happen.  I told you that you’d wanna start ridin’ the Bear… and I also told you that when you got up the nerve that I’d be willin’”<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later Alex had Sergeant William ‘Big Bad Billy Bear’ Blanchard tied up with silk rope spread eagle on his own bed.  There was a leather blindfold over the big man’s eyes and Alex was puffing on the cigar Billy had in his mouth just minutes before.<br />
<br />
With the blindfold on Billy couldn’t see Alex changing.  Alex grew bigger, at least 7’ and became hyper muscular.  Alex then grew hair all over his body, much more dense than that of his fully erect partner who waited to be mated.  Alex grew a thick full beard and to finish it off he increased the size of his cock to at least a foot long and thickened it as well, just for good measure.  Alex was now a Bear to drool over.<br />
<br />
With that he climbed on top of Billy and pushed his cock into Billy’s well lubed hole.  Billy gasped and then cried out in surprise.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?”  Billy said.<br />
<br />
Alex, looking like a much improved version of chase, removed the blindfold and growled around the cigar in a deep, rumbling version of Chase’s voice, “Surprise lover!”<br />
<br />
“Who the fuck are you?”  Billy almost yelled.<br />
<br />
“I’m Chase, well, I’m really not Chase.  Chase was the Dogkey in the back of the van.  Now, that won’t matter in a few minutes though as when I come in you, you’ll start growing into the same kind of hyper-masculine form I have changed into.”  Alex said and puffed cigar smoke at Billy.<br />
<br />
Billy struggled, but Alex had made very sure that the big man would not be able to free himself from his bondage.<br />
<br />
“Now, now, calm down lover.  You’re going to enjoy this.” Alex said and began pumping his huge organ in and out of Billy.  He pulled on the cigar until his massive lungs were full and put his bearded mouth completely over the nose and mouth of the captive sergeant.<br />
<br />
Billy struggled, trying to hold his breath but it was no use Alex waited him out and then filled his lungs with smoke and then his mouth with tongue.  He fed a pint of virus rich saliva to Billy before he broke the kiss.<br />
<br />
Billy stopped struggling and Alex began fucking him in earnest.  Billy’s face was a picture of bliss, his eyes glazed over in pure euphoria as Alex pounded his ass and then, Alex came… and kept on coming until Billy himself shot a thick heavy load all over his extremely hairy, tattooed chest.<br />
<br />
Alex sighed and finished the cigar, stubbing it out in a bedside ashtray after he was done.<br />
<br />
“Now the fun begins!  I get to watch as you become bigger and hairier than you’ve ever been, but that’s only stage one, Billy Bear.”  <br />
<br />
Alex said as he climbed on top of the prone man again.  This time Alex lapped up Billy’s come, eating it out of his chest, then belly and then pubic hair and finally sucking the last of Billy’s uncontaminated sperm out of his cock.  Billy moaned in pleasure and Alex was right, he’d completely forgotten about Chase as the pleasurable changes began.<br />
<br />
Billy’s already muscular body grew.  His pecs became huge slabs of muscle, his legs became tree trunks.  His belly, under the accumulated fat became as hard as iron.  His arms grew to be the size of most men’s legs and his neck became so large that his head looked strangely out of place and small on it, but that didn’t last long as his head grew larger too to be proportionate to his muscular neck and shoulders.  Billy’s cock grew past the 10 and a half inches to a full 14 and expanded in girth.  His balls swelled to the size of hen eggs and as they did they disgorged their seed sending Billy into another mind blowing orgasm.  With his increased strength and size, Billy ripped through his bonds as he shot the last of his current load.  As he lay there, panting and dizzy from his change, Billy’s salt and pepper stubble grew into a full, thick beard.  His body hair increased and concealed his tattoos and the semen deposited on his chest and stomach.<br />
<br />
“Stage two!”  Alex said and he once again inserted his cock into the now willing Billy.<br />
<br />
Alex’s cock grew into a new shape and Billy could feel barbs.  Alex’s face took on a leonine cast and his teeth lengthened.  A mane grew out around his head.<br />
<br />
“Ah Billy, you will make a most beautiful hybrid of man and beast… or is that beasts!”  Alex said with a lustful grin.<br />
<br />
“You see, the Dogkey your lover became was an experiment.  He was the prototype, you will be the production model and yet a custom job at the same time.  You’ll be like…” Alex was saying and then was cut off as Big Bad Billy grabbed the sides of his head and locked lips with Alex.  Alex shot his load into his waiting vessel.<br />
<br />
Billy began changing, tawny fur growing in among his salt and pepper body hair.  A black mane began growing on his head and neck and down his upper back.  His nose began to broaden and his hands started becoming more paw like.<br />
<br />
He broke the kiss with Alex and roared out another orgasm.  “Yes!”  He growled out triumphantly, looking down at his barbed penis.<br />
<br />
Alex began fucking him harder and said, “Stage three, lover.”<br />
<br />
The already huge Alex grew even larger and the bed could no longer take the combined weight of both rutting males.  It fell with a crash to the floor but neither cared and kept fucking.<br />
<br />
Alex grew larger sill, this time his body became more ursine mixed with human than he had been lion mixed with human.  For all intents and purposes Alex became a golden brown Kodiak anthro-morph and passed this new set of genetic instructions to Billy with each pulse of his cock; filling Billy, who was now about half lion, with ursinoid sperm.<br />
<br />
The new seed had its effect on Billy as his body grew extremely bulky.  He grew to eight foot then finally ten foot tall.  His chest was impossibly massive, his arms as thick as his legs had been before Alex had introduced the lion genes.  Thick golden brown fur swallowed up the remainder of his human hair and his beard grew excessively bushy and completely merged with his lion’s mane.  His legs, which were leonine in form, grew stockier and the paws became broad like that of a bear.  His rear, until now devoid of a tail now grew a stubby bear’s tail.  His belly became rounded like a grizzly bear’s belly and his face was finally completely covered in short fur.  His nose was more lion than bear but his ears were pure grizzly.  His cock, still with the lion’s barbs had grown a flat head like that of a bear and his balls were covered in thick fur.<br />
<br />
The last change was his teeth.  All of his now widely spaced human teeth fell out as new, sharp predatory teeth filled his mouth.<br />
<br />
Alex pulled out of Billy with an audible pop and surveyed his handiwork.<br />
<br />
He held out a pawed hand to help Big Bad Billy the Berlion out of bed.<br />
<br />
Billy grunted and stood on his new legs.  He was more powerful than he’d ever dreamed of being.  His hands were still blessed with opposable thumbs, though they were furry and had pads.  His human heritage granted him another gift as he soon found out.<br />
<br />
Billy’s stomach growled and he said in a deep voice, “I want a cigar… and meat!”<br />
<br />
Billy was as intelligent as he’d always been and he could still talk.<br />
<br />
Alex was quite satisfied with his work<br />
<br />
“Yes, my lover, here’s a cigar.”  He handed it to Billy who took it into his fanged mouth and puffed it into life with the flame Alex offered from the Zippo lighter.  “And we will both go find some meat tonight!”<br />
<br />
Billy laughed a lustful, chilling laugh and the two exited the bedroom, both bowing and turning to get through the now too small door.<br />
<br />
(Yes, some of us give a shit about this and have been reading it eagerly, I know you’re Dog Boy, but I enjoy it when you branch out to something more than the usual ‘Dog and Pony’ stuff :^)</p>
