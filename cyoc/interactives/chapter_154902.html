<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yuriko sighed as she now made her way towards her next class. After being stuck in the past for the past month she still had not made any progress on her mission. As she now began to wonder if this whole “mission” was a fruitless endeavor she was suddenly struck with a splitting headache. Letting out a cry, the biracial grabbed her head as memories began to enter her mind. Memories from an entirely new reality.<br />
<br />
Memories of Morgan and Derrick Harris came to the forefront of her mind. Yuriko aunt and uncle were teachers in her future, teachers that were happily married and had even given Yuriko several younger cousins. These memories now were beginning to become foggy as several new realities began to unfold. In one of these realities Gloria had become a pregnant teenager, giving birth to a red headed girl she had named Morgan. The birth of this girl though had proved to be quite controversial. Derrick, her uncle, had grown into a bitter and angry man in this new reality. Although Yuriko didn’t know why she could remember in these new memories that he had a particular hatred of Gloria. The teacher and his former student avoided eachother whenever the families got together. Yuriko had heard rumors at school that it was Derrick that had impregnated Gloria when she was in high school. While these rumors were unfounded they had dogged the man throughout Yuriko life, causing him to become a functional alcoholic. As a result a rift had formed between the Harris, Turner, and O’Toole families.<br />
<br />
Still more memories flooded into Yuriko’s mind. These memories were of another timeline connected to this one. A reality that was formed when Gloria inadvertently erased Morgan Dean from reality useing her magic. As a result Gloria had befallen the same fate as Kellie Pendragon. She, like Kellie now existed in a timeline completely different from the reality she now existed in. A world that much like Kellies was similar yet different. As a result of these actions Gloria had grown into a sullen and cautious sorceress, always warning those who would listen about the dangers of the Ring of Age. Yuriko could even see in this possible timeline how Gloria had tried to not only destroy the ring but stop anyone from useing it. This resulted in Gloria becoming just as dangerous, and just as big of an enemy to Yuriko and the others as Lilith or Morgan LeFay.<br />
<br />
“Shit,” Yuriko hissed. Looking around quickly Yuriko now tried to remember where Ms. Deans classroom was. As she raced down the hallway she finally skidded to a halt in front of Ms. Deans classroom. Cautiously peering inside Yurikos eyes went wide with terror. Morgan was a teenager yet again, perhaps the same age as Gloria. The two teens were now rolling their eyes as Derrick professed his feelings for the girl when they had first met. While the story was endearing Yuriko had bigger problems, Morgan was still growing younger.<br />
<br />
As Morgan crossed the threshold from teen to tween Yuriko began to wring her hands. Why would Gloria make Morgan Dean younger? Closing her eyes she now tried to use her powers to read the thoughts of Derrick, Gloria, and Morgan. Yurikos eyes now flew open as she discovered the reason behind Gloria useing her magic. “Morgan was barren,” Yuriko whispered in awe. “Damn, had no idea. Never would of figured that considering they have four kids.”<br />
<br />
Yuriko now began to understand though that Gloria was trying to help Morgan, she was just venturing into an area of magic that was perhaps far too dangerous. Suddenly it dawned on Yuriko, she was destined to be here. If she was to ensure her future remained untouched, she would have to assist Gloria in performing this difficult bit of magic. Glancing at Morgan she could see the girl was now back in preschool and quickly heading for toddlerhood. The teachers clothing bagging around her as she grew younger. Yuriko watched now as Gloria picked the small child up as she descended into infancy before vanishing inside Gloria. “If I don’t help Gloria out with this things are going to go south really quickly.”<br />
<br />
Yuriko now began to focus on the unborn Morgan as Gloria talked with Derrick. Gloria was useing her magic to repair the damage to Morgan’s womb, the problem though was that Morgan was still growing younger inside the womb. If Yuriko didn’t assist in stabilizing her baby she would vanish or reach a stage where Gloria would be unable to restore her to adulthood. While Gloria was powerful the magic she was performing required two wizards, Yuriko now found herself as the unwitting second party in this spell. Straining with all her power Yuriko now kept Morgan from either vanishing completely or bonding completely with Gloria as Gloria repaired the young teachers womb.<br />
<br />
“Damn Gloria finish this spell,” Yuriko thought as she strained with all her might. When she thought she could take no more she could see Gloria Give Derrick a serene smile as she began to reverse the spell. Yuriko let out a sigh of relief, sinking to her knees as Morgan now began to grow up once more. Feeling exhausted Yuriko wearily watched as the infant Morgan Dean began to grow up once more, slowly but surely growing into her clothing before reaching the age of 25 once more. As Yuriko slid out of view she could hear an obviously dazed Morgan speak. The woman sounded okay and as Yuriko searched her memories she sighed happily. The other timelines that only moments ago had seemed so prominent were now vanishing like puffs of smoke. Yurikos future (and the four cousins Derrick and Morgan would give her) was now safe. <br />
<br />
“Note to self,” Yuriko moaned as she began to slink away from the classroom. “Remind Uncle Derrick And Aunt Morgan they owe me big time the next time I have to babysit.” As Yuriko now began to journey towards the Magic Shop to talk with Merlin, she thought of Gloria. She would need to keep a close eye on her and talk with Merlin to see if she could finally reveal who she was to her friends and family.</p>
