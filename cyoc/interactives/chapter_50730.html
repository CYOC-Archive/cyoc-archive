<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You should consider Trevor,&quot; Judas said calmly lounging about like any cat. &quot;That you are <br />
a cat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; Trevor said looking at Judas lazing about in a sunspot wondering how he was <br />
going to be getting about with one leg in bandages. <br />
<br />
&quot;What I mean is, you are a cat, period. If we are to assume a soul exists, a non-material <br />
thing, weather felidae have one or not is besides the points in this venture: the point is, if <br />
a soul is a non-material thing, then why would it have such material things such as <br />
gender and species even apply to it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've... thought about this a lot...&quot; Trevor said feeling VERY uncomfortable about this <br />
discussion and really not sure he wanted it to continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I spend a good deal of time indoor, thinking is something I have a great deal of time for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good is called 'He' in the bible.&quot; Trevor tried to deflate what Judas was saying.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there some translations Father tells me when he has no one else to talk to that there <br />
some translations that God is translated as 'she' indeed. He doesn't know how much to <br />
trust those translations or not, but God if God did indeed exist before everything, then <br />
logically, would that not mean God existed before there was a gender to begin with?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor shuddered, now feeling  decidedly uncomfortable, &quot;I have MEMORIES of my life as a <br />
human being! I've .... I've ... I have the identity of a human being! This body is completely <br />
the wrong shape for me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot; Judas said calmly, &quot;You have been raised -as- a human the majority of your life, <br />
and have been -treated- as a human, so of course you act like one and think of yourself as <br />
one. But if you really are a human in a cat's body, then would you feel the same if you lost <br />
your memories of being human? Or would I suddenly think of myself as a human trapped <br />
in a cat's body if I had your memories instead of my own?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor felt sick. He remembered a story he read once when he was very very VERY bored, <br />
about a man who woke up in a raccoon's body at the zoo, but it turned out the man's <br />
memories and knowledge were COPIED OVER into the raccoon...The raccoon had never <br />
been human.<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember what happened to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am not saying you WEREN'T human, that is besides the point, as is many things, <br />
your are felidae now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still feeling ill Trevor said, &quot;I'm not letting go of everything my parents taught me just <br />
because my DNA got raped!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am not abandoning my faith simply because the mollies all think I'm utterly insane. <br />
That does not change -what- I am however.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive me if I'm starting the end of the world by saying it here, but I noticed your the <br />
first cat I've met who hasn't used the word 'Bast'  once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When one's God says, 'You shall have no gods before or after me' one should take it <br />
serious.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Lutheran cat decided not to discuss -that- issue at any further length not for all the <br />
tea in China.  He still felt ill. <br />
<br />
Trevor asked, &quot;Are you sure you're not a human who was Transformed into a cat and had <br />
his memories erased of being human?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I am, then it doesn't matter, if I am not, it doesn't matter: what I am, is what I am after <br />
all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Judas, have you ever tried to convert other cats?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On occasion... once one tried neuter me themselves so I wouldn't 'infect future lines of <br />
the superior race' along with calling me a 'traitor to Bast.'  Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because... there's a whole giant pack of werewolves in that estate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are they called 'where-wolves?' Don't you know where they are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Never mind. The point is that Madam Serenity and I are going to need a LOT of help <br />
getting Julie and her family out of there... and since Serenity said the police stay as far <br />
away from the game as possible, the four legged kind might be our only option.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor, you might not have the experiences, but you think you can get cats to WORK <br />
TOGETHER?&quot; Said the black cat to the tabby. <br />
<br />
'I am a coward.' &quot;... I can try...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You seek the impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I am a coward.' &quot;I've given up on -that- word a long long time ago.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;At least take time to heal.&quot; Judas said imploringly. <br />
<br />
'I am a coward.' &quot;I can maybe galvanize them if I show what a threat the wolves are to ALL <br />
of them. Self preservation and all that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but seriously you're in no condition to go anywhere on your own. And they wont' <br />
trust you if you have your human with you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Trevor sighed, 'Hopefully that wolf pervert will act like all the other harems Serenity <br />
described to me and just exist in sex limbo not changing or progressing besides the <br />
occasional new victim... I hope...' <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mitch Hurteng it's me the woman you talked to earlier today... I'm glade to hear that... <br />
listen... you MUST get of Glendale... yes your brother in Frostdale will do. Tell no one at all <br />
where you're going and don't leave any traces that could point where! Those big dogs you <br />
saw could be looking for you now!  Please! This is for your own safety! ... Thank you Mr. <br />
Hurteng! Thank you! Call me in a week or so and I should be able to tell you if it's safe to <br />
return.  The dog creatures are created by the game. YES THAT GAME! No it is not fiction! <br />
Trust me, just avoid returning to Glendale for some time for your own safety.... thank you <br />
Mr. Hurteng.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity hung up the phone and sighed, &quot;At least he'll be safe from the wolves' <br />
wrath... assuming they're not already at his front door. Not that it would matter by the <br />
time we got there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Michel asked, &quot;Would then going to his house then at least provide you with some <br />
information?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Among those changed were two police officers, they covered up the last place the wolves <br />
were perfectly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see.... I'm sorry I'm not able to offer you any more assistance than my prayers on this <br />
matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why haven't you used it before now? The powder? You must have encountered victims <br />
of the game since then.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes I think the game has a will all it's own. It's like it tries to -avoid- me whenever <br />
I carried the powder with me... it was written centuries ago to help undo curses... but it <br />
got lost in the files and I only began translating it when I was forced to admit it was true <br />
what my father said about the game not just being a fantasy of spiteful teenagers who the <br />
game seems to gravitate towards.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Before I was cursed to be always and forever be a black human woman I would have never <br />
believed any of this. People like to ignore what's outside their universe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems so. It was my brother who convinced me after we had translated the scroll to <br />
simply use the powder to END the game with us, rather than leave it out there and use it <br />
restore ourselves.&quot; <br />
<br />
Serenity could admire the priest and his brother for that kind of self sacrifice, even if his <br />
logic and information were somewhat bias. Something she had NO intention of debating <br />
with him least she alienate the first person in a long time who seemed to fully embrace <br />
the desire to end the game like she did. <br />
<br />
Japan in theory only abandoned creating a nuclear weapon because they supposedly <br />
focused on creating a microwave death ray instead and had it up to killing test animals and <br />
possible people in a controlled environment when the bomb was dropped. Germany was <br />
only a year or less away from developing an atomic bomb when it surrendered. And Russia <br />
and China developed the bomb on their own years later. <br />
<br />
Was it an evil that should have never been allowed into the world? Considering that nuking <br />
an incoming astroid would only make it break up into a hundred smaller pieces to make <br />
the damage spread out over a larger area, Madam Serenity had to very much agree. <br />
<br />
 But sadly, it seemed like an evil that would have come about in one form or another due <br />
the march of progress. Like the short story of the Emperor of China killing the man who <br />
invented the flying machine a thousand years ahead of it's time seeing it could be used as <br />
a weapon of war. Some discoveries it sadly seemed couldn't be stopped.  <br />
<br />
This made her think of desperate parents and families in the know endlessly trying to bury <br />
and cover up the existence of the game so it would never be used again, but somehow, <br />
each generation rediscovered the game and the havoc began anew.  <br />
<br />
'Perhaps Father Michel did the single smartest thing anyone has EVER done with the <br />
game.' <br />
<br />
She looked at the scroll supposedly scribed from the legendary Merlin himself. Serenity <br />
wondered which Merlin. Merlin itself was a title meaning 'man of the woods' and there had <br />
been three men in history to carry that title. The first one usually agreed upon being as <br />
the one connected to the historical King Arthur. <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you tested it's effects? The powder?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Several times. Outside the church and in it. Our turns were completely negated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Serenity nodded, &quot;This is be very useful later, thank you, but until I find someone <br />
who has a turn that hasn't used it I'll have to wait until I can begin curing the victims of <br />
this harem. Trevor and I can't be transformed, period, by the game or otherwise, so we're <br />
in no danger at least in that regard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do now that you know where the harem is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The police will do nothing, the curse is something they avoid like the plague. And <br />
everyone at the Smith's is a brainwashed slave more than likely. Even if they're likely to <br />
have the IQs of blow up dolls. The harems I've dealt with before were situated in some <br />
house of the original pervert, overflowing by the time it was done. And the harem owner <br />
usually had an ego the size of a small planet by that time too. Then I could go undercover <br />
when I was younger and intimidate the little rat into undoing his own damage by ordering <br />
his slaves to... however if Julie is now one of them... my element of surprise and bluff are <br />
all gone. I'll need to completely rethink my usually strategies.&quot;<br />
<br />
A large naked orange ape leapt off of one of the book shelves, having moved with the <br />
speed, invisibility, and precision of a ninja. It landed right in front of Serenity looking at <br />
her with solid black eyes, around it's neck was a crucifix depending the Savior.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Paul!&quot; Father Michel declared his monkey tail wavering about behind him. <br />
<br />
The orangoutang took Serenity's hand and as gently as it could kissed her hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;One... of those sub clauses I mention is that clothes mostly just dissolve off him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yes... &quot; The orangoutang grunted. Though it came out more as a low 'yee-ass.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Also orangoutang lips and throat weren't built for human speaking, or at least his <br />
weren't. Talking... is a struggle for him. So is writing...she wanted him to be <br />
indistinguishable from a zoo animal she said but fully able to 'enjoy' it. Thankfully she did <br />
a sloppy job.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Paul is the one who suggested they end their turns forever?... ' Serenity suddenly had a <br />
great appreciation for this man.  &quot;Does he know sign language?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He learned yes. But how many other do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Point taken.... &quot;<br />
<br />
The orangoutang take a large piece of chalk and went over to a nearby blackboard and <br />
wrote out in crude letters: <br />
<br />
LISTENING. WILL HELP. BODYGUARD. <br />
<br />
&quot;Paul...&quot; Father Michel said in an unknown tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the offer but no.&quot; Serenity said. <br />
<br />
U NEED 1. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're not invulnerable to being changed again like I am and Trevor... if you're hit with <br />
the game you'll become a slave to some sex freak.&quot;<br />
<br />
U B KILLED OTHERWIZE.  <br />
<br />
&amp; EAR PLUGS. <br />
<br />
The orangoutang showed off the kind that could be snuck into the ear channel and be <br />
impossible to remove by accident and impossible to tell if you had them on. <br />
<br />
&quot;..... I gave Serenity some ear phones, they didn't save her.&quot;<br />
<br />
U NEED ME. <br />
<br />
&quot;.... Please just don't make me regret it.&quot; <br />
<br />
1 CONDITION <br />
<br />
&quot;What's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
NO BANANA JOKES. SICK 2 HADEDS OF THEM. <br />
<br />
&quot;I promise....&quot; <br />
<br />
'What a circus act I've turned into.' Serenity thought. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Awwww.&quot;   Kaylee lamented in a playful way, &quot;I was looking foreword to when one of the <br />
she-wolves did something stupid and was added to the gallery, it would have been so fun <br />
to watch! Now though if we're glued into our upgraded form we can't use the Game for <br />
that. No fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
The triplets said nothing, she was Alpha Female, what she said was not to be talked down <br />
to by them, but that didn't stop them from shuddering at the idea of her finding such a <br />
thing amusing.  The Master and Alpha Female the triplet thought decidedly needed their <br />
guidance: after all, they had to service them utterly and look out for Master's best interest. <br />
<br />
The way the Alpha Female left the room had a slight sway on her steps. <br />
<br />
Was the Alpha Female tipsy? <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess she really was depressed over losing her video games.&quot; Said Darla. <br />
<br />
&quot;Video games?&quot; Julie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alpha Female started out as a geeky male teenager who loved games.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure she'll get along perfectly with the children then.&quot; Julie said confidently. <br />
<br />
&quot;She's usually busy with Master, that's what Martha is for.&quot; Darla explained to her triplet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Martha?&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha and Abbey said, &quot;Our Nanny!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice said in turn,  &quot;Our Governess.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see once you're all introduced formally to the pack.&quot; Fran explained to Julie. <br />
<br />
Julie just nodded, overjoyed at the idea of meeting all of her new family, and thus Fran and <br />
Darla were overjoyed at Julie meeting all of her new family. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
Kaylee in spite of being ever so slightly drunk (compared to the complete banged out state <br />
Pearl had been in) was able to find the clink and Zackery on the top floor of the household <br />
looking out the window at the tireless foreman, Caroline and day workers tirelessly <br />
working on this task having been promised an impressive amount of money for their <br />
efforts. <br />
<br />
All in all it would still take them till tomorrow Sunday to finnish upgrading the gate into <br />
the SWAT Team proof barrier it was going to be. <br />
<br />
Grace, Hope, and Isabelle surrounded  Zack to his sides and back, feeling his muscles and <br />
body, while at the same time watching his every move and memorizing anything he said to <br />
be filed for possible subterfuge to Master. <br />
<br />
'Not that it's about to matter anymore. Sorry Zack, all your fun and games end right now.' <br />
<br />
Kaylee snapped her fingers, &quot;Girls, come.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What is this?' Zackery asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want them, I get what I want, so they're mind.&quot; Kaylee said matter of fact doing splash <br />
effect with her hair, not even trying to hide her spoiled attitude. <br />
<br />
Grace, Hope, Isabelle and Zack included, couldn't help but admire how Kyle had gone from <br />
worthless geek to flawless inner circle material with her new attitude. The click heard the <br />
command and obeyed. They were used to supporting Jennifer during cheer leading, but <br />
Kaylee had turned their gymnastic skills into them being her portable chair. Their girls got <br />
into position without even having to be told. Kaylee loved it. However this wasn't what <br />
Master had sent her for. <br />
<br />
She looked at them, milk chocolate Hope holding position with a perfectly straight face <br />
showing neither resentment nor joy, a face of duty. 'Every every natural color mixed' Grace <br />
her eyes closed her ears perk for Kaylee's next order, they were made to serve her after all, <br />
the face of resolve. And dark chocolate Isabelle had her eye closed tight, braced herself <br />
for Kaylee's weight, looking a tiny bit scared, a face of innocence almost. <br />
<br />
'So that's what I'd look like with those expressions.' Kaylee thought, 'thinking about it now, <br />
it's almost a shame I don't feel like wearing dresses, I could use them to try them on for <br />
me, I wonder how some jewelry would look on me though like an Egyptian queen..oh-oh!  <br />
Okay, focus Kaylee, you know what Master wants so better hop to it!' <br />
<br />
She leaned in closed to Hope and whispered in her ears, &quot;Master says, 'Now.' &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now?&quot; Hope asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The clink broke up, and in one fluid motion had Zack's arms and shoulders pinned down. <br />
Kaylee then came in front of him and used her legs to pin those down. He was easily <br />
stronger than she was, but he wasn't resisting anyway, this was why he existed now after <br />
all right? To please any female pack member who wanted him?<br />
<br />
&quot;Kaylee?&quot; Zackery asked, &quot;I'm kinda surprised, I thought you only had the hots for Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do. You, Lawrence, Roger, Nick: you aren't worth my time. Master is the only one I want <br />
or need. Let the rest of the pack have you pale imitations. Now then, Hope, do it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare Zackery.&quot; Hope said in a cold cold voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Zackery said in horror. <br />
<br />
Kaylee said still laying over him looking down domineeringly, 'Is this what Master feels <br />
with me? No wonder he loves it!'  &quot;You see Zack, when you and the girls were made into <br />
park of the pack, it seems some parts of the transform, like your parents still <br />
remembering you, and not having absolute loyalty to me, or Master... now we were going <br />
to just let you do as you will unless you did something against Master, but now with <br />
trouble brewing we're planning on sealing our wolf forms so we can't be made back into <br />
our old inferior selves: I'd -kill myself- if I had to be Kyle again personally. Oh and if you <br />
chose transform you end up a skinny lanky gender ambiguous wolf like you teased <br />
Lawrence and Roger for being... and if you chose Dare... you become as loyal to Master as <br />
any of us... you better chose quick before time runs out.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Which one do you want?&quot; Zackery asked totally honest though very scared. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which one would give you the most pleasure?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee stared for a second then burst out laughing, &quot;You were dedicated to your job at <br />
least! What gives me pleasure is seeing what you chose! Five seconds!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DARE!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kaylee pouted slightly, &quot;I was lying, I thought it might be amusing to have a girlie man <br />
around her still to contrast the wolf titans you four guys are. And that little boy who is no <br />
child of Master is not what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zackery said what he said for what he had been remade to be, &quot;If it gives you more <br />
pleasure, you could just Dare me to give you another go and to say Transform next time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;......&quot; Kaylee blinked again. The Clink actually stunningly impressed by Zackery's attitude <br />
and dedication to his function.  &quot;Pst. Naw.&quot; Kaylee got off him stretched for a bit and <br />
walked in a short circle before the setting sun, looking like the picture of female beauty. <br />
&quot;With you saying that it kinda takes the fun out of it. Hope, fix him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he can't have kittens?&quot; Hope asked with a slightly sadistic grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, so he doesn't try to act like he's more important than he is anymore and is loyal as any <br />
of us to Master.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right.&quot; <br />
<br />
 Kaylee looked Jensen in the eye, her body an outline against the darkening sun, &quot;Don't <br />
worry, Master's chosen you're free to transform your parents into whatever you please, be <br />
they pups, art, or more she-wolves when they return. The choice is yours. But now that <br />
Master is planning to use the game to make it impossible for someone with a turn to steal <br />
away our wolfhood, you need to be taken care of before hand... It's nothing personal Zack, <br />
it's simply for the good of the pack and Master's wishes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hope said, &quot;For your Dare Zack, you are to be one hundred percent loyal to Master and one <br />
hundred percent respectful of Kaylee and the Betas. You will be  loyal to THE Big Bad Wolf <br />
and will relish your position and any other task the rest of the  pack asks of you and only <br />
use your turn to expand the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
The clink let Zackery go. <br />
<br />
'Now for the fun part.' Kaylee thought. &quot;All of you! Line up! Stand at attention!&quot; Kaylee <br />
assumed her 'commander pose.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Now smile.&quot;<br />
<br />
They did so. <br />
<br />
&quot;Think about the Master or all the females you'll service.&quot;<br />
<br />
They smiled more. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now who do you love?&quot;<br />
<br />
They said together, &quot;The Master. Jensen. Alpha Male of the Big Bad Wolf Pack!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you serve?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We serve our pack!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who do you obey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our Alphas!&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;What is your purpose in life and creeds-!?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;To service and please Master in all things, to protect Master and the pack from all that  <br />
would threaten us and him! To insure the estate remains a safe haven for the pack forever  <br />
and always! To dream of a Glendale where all wear wolf ears even if it remains but a  <br />
dream! And to never ever form labor unions!&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Right turn!&quot;   Zack and clink obeyed. <br />
<br />
  &quot;About face!&quot;  They turned one-eighty degrees.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Left turn!&quot; Now they had their rears to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;About face!&quot;<br />
<br />
They turned to face her. <br />
<br />
&quot;And bow!&quot;<br />
<br />
They did, still smiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who is Alpha Female in this pack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are.&quot; They all said together like a well trained army. <br />
<br />
&quot;Zackery, down on all fours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alpha Female.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee strutted up to him and laid down on top of him her maternal material hanging over <br />
the side as she put her fingers underneath her jaw. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now all of you lay down in front of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The clink did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look up at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
They did so, she looked down at them from her living furry low couch.  &quot;Now, tell me <br />
everything you know about Master when he was still Jennifer, when you first met him, er, <br />
her, and all that. Be sure to give me all the juicy details.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alpha Female.&quot; All four wolves present said. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll have the job done first thing in the morning. It's too dangerous to do this sort of <br />
work at night.&quot; The foreman said to Caroline. <br />
<br />
&quot;I see... &quot; She was SO tempted to make them she-wolves with night vision then and there. <br />
But she wanted Master's permission. Also, she thought about Pearl was the only lesser she <br />
wolf that Alpha Female remembered the name of properly due to her matching name and <br />
fur color. 'Well, if Master thinks we need the numbers, you might be added to our pack <br />
soon Amber, Ruby, Amethyst, Topaz,  Tourmaline, Jasper and all the rest of you oh yes, I <br />
need to do some quick reading on names of different jem stones for all of you.' True, the <br />
Master's pups were worried about being able to manage so many she-wolves... but the <br />
more the merrier right?'<br />
<br />
&quot;So see you first thing tomorrow beautiful?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh most decidedly, your men don't mind working on Sunday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for the amount you're paying for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I see.&quot; Caroline nodded. <br />
<br />
The day worker left taking most of their equipment with them. Caroline returned to the <br />
estate. As soon as she stepped inside the front door Beatrice and Pearl ran past her saying <br />
it was dinner time and that it was time to formally introduce new pack mates.  <br />
<br />
Caroline stepped to the dinning room the slab of meat in the middle of the room. While <br />
the Master had desired no rank among the lesser wolves, for a sense of order the pack <br />
had developed their own positioning. The six shadow stood to the side with her legs apart <br />
and their arms behind their backs. <br />
<br />
Martha was to the far back of the room with her hands together and her heads and tails <br />
down as an Omega should.  Alice was next to Darla and not in the mirror world for once. <br />
Bart, Jenny, Kevin and Marcy flanked their mother. Kaylee herself of course was on <br />
Jensen's right side. Fran was on his left side.  Mr. P of course was behind the pups. <br />
<br />
The males were evenly spaced about, Zackery had the copies of Alpha Female with him <br />
plus Pearl and June.   Roger had his sister Megan, Anne, Maxine, Robyn, and Millie.    <br />
Lawrence had around him Ahsley, Margot, Alexandra, Jasmine and Beatrice.  Purple Ulysses <br />
was being hugged on one side by Sarah, with Terri and Sandi together as always.   <br />
Alexandra was next to her cousin Nicole who was sitting in Nick's lab. Caroline chose to <br />
be next to Nick. <br />
<br />
Jensen stood to his full height, &quot;She-wolves and males, it is my honor that I introduce you <br />
to your newest pack mates. First, my two new daughters, Samantha and Abbey. Daughters <br />
of Fran and our other newest member.&quot;<br />
<br />
Coming in through the kitchen two five year old glass she wolves entered the dinning <br />
room and waved about and totally drank in the full attention they were getting. Caroline <br />
had seen them about and yes, they were very cute. They were like a glass sculpture of <br />
innocence brought to life! <br />
<br />
&quot;And I'd like to also introduce you to our pack's new doctor and now THIRD beta, and <br />
regents should Bart and Jenny be forced to lead the pack without myself and Kaylee at any <br />
point. Mother of Abbey, Julie!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nearly all the wolves gasped as a THIRD twin entered the room, using the same graceful <br />
step as the other two did, her movements just the same as theirs, looking at them with <br />
those same blues eyes surrounded by dirty blond fur. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello all of you. I am happy to have all of you as my family.&quot; Julie said. <br />
<br />
Kaylee held up a tiny sign that said, 'Cheer' and the wolves did so with zeal. <br />
<br />
&quot;The living stone gargoyles outside exist to protect us,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gru-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nownowjenny-&quot; Kaylee put a paw around her elder daughter's mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;And Jack and Marcine's herd outside to ultimately provide for us. We shall insure our pack <br />
continues and survives and prospers!&quot;<br />
<br />
This time Kaylee didn't need to use the sign as the Big Bad Wolves cheered. <br />
<br />
&quot;For the sake of survival, and to be prepared for anything, Alpha Female Kaylee has <br />
selected an island in international waters that'll serve as our last resort should be forced to <br />
abandon the estate.&quot;<br />
<br />
This caused several of the she wolves to gasp, in particular knowing how zeal the Master <br />
had been about it before, she wondering if someone has used a Dare on him. <br />
<br />
&quot;This island is intended purely to be our new home should we forced into an armed <br />
confrontation with the army. I have no desire to use it, but I do not wish Bart, Jenny, or any <br />
of my children to be in danger... Alice, Abbey and Samantha will take us through the <br />
mirrorverse to safety if it should come to it.   But there is a human who knows of our <br />
existence as part of the game, and who can not be made into part of the pack due to her <br />
own curse of the game... she may seek to steal away our wolf hood... for that reason <br />
preparation must be made.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master.&quot; Caroline spoke up, &quot;If it pleases you, may I suggest that I use my turn, and in <br />
turn they use their turns on their present fellows, on the foreman and day workers <br />
tomorrow? To make them into gem colored she-wolves who perhaps can manage and <br />
maintain our new secondary home to preparation in case we should ever need it? This'll <br />
increase our numbers while not putting any new pressure on the estate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... I'll give you my decision in the morning Caroline, but if I say yes, you are free to select <br />
one to stay male if you desire it, and make sure to include the clause of their human pasts <br />
being no more. Also, since you brought up the idea, you shall be in charge of the new she <br />
wolves and relocate to the island with them.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;M-Master... I-I don't know what to say.&quot; Caroline spoke amazed at once again being <br />
given such a responsibility. <br />
<br />
&quot;Say nothing yet. I haven't said I had approved yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes of course Master!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Also, so you all know, the investigation of Zackery is over. Zackery's attitude has been <br />
repaired. His impertinence has been removed, you are to welcome him to you with open <br />
arms if you will have him. &quot;<br />
<br />
There were murmurs among he she wolves at this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I command it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The murmurs stopped at once. <br />
<br />
&quot;Also it appears we have a traitor among our mist!&quot; Jensen said point at Pearl instantly!<br />
<br />
&quot;Pearl! You have used a turn without permission and on your own pack mate!&quot; <br />
   <br />
&quot;Turn her into a statue!&quot; Kaylee said cheering wanting to see the spectacle. <br />
<br />
Jensen snarled at his Alpha Female, &quot;Kaylee! DOWN!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;... yes Master...&quot; Kaylee sat down lowly and demurely. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am Alpha Male of this pack and I pass judgement. Pearl, do you have anything to say in <br />
your defense?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Zack is wonderful and shouldn't have been talked down that way. And I feel he's <br />
good stock and shouldn't have been banned by Nicole. I only Dared June so she wouldn't <br />
make the pack reject him more! ... I accept any punishment you give me Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your punishment is to become part of the gallery. Zackery.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;..... Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will be a statue, just a statue, nothing but a statue, none shall remember you ever <br />
existed save as a statue...&quot;<br />
<br />
In the dinning room there was now a polished marble statue of a she-wolf with a plaque <br />
of a name no one knew called 'Pearl.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Pearl? PEARL!&quot; <br />
<br />
June shook Pearl several times. <br />
<br />
Pearl started, &quot;Uh? Oh! What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You blanked out there for a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.. having a daymare after Master said Zackery had been 'repaired.' &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Just means we don't need to hide ourselves liking him anymore, nothing major.&quot; <br />
<br />
Pearl breathed a sigh of relief, 'Just a vision, it wasn't real. Master won't do that to you...' <br />
<br />
&quot;As I was saying,&quot; Jensen continued, &quot;I've had our queen of semantics Alice work out a <br />
properly phrased Transform that will permanently lock us within our wolf forms. Once that <br />
is done, no spell or Turn will be able to steal away our pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
All the wolves present gleefully howled at this revelation.  Pearl realized that as long as <br />
she wasn't called on first her use of the game would forever go unknown once the new <br />
sweep was done. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master.&quot; Lawrence said standing up,  &quot;From what we've seen, besides only working on five <br />
people at a time and only functions within Glendale and of course the exchange of terms,  <br />
The Game HAS no limits!  <br />
<br />
If it can epongue our human pasts, and enable people not to question our existence, why <br />
not test it to see if we can Transform each other into lords of the planet Earth?! <br />
<br />
Master you've commented among us during meals that those who have used the game <br />
before us were all petty, small, and narrow minded, they never saw the -real- potential <br />
this power had!  I think we might still be thinking too small! <br />
<br />
If we've been able to make Julie into a expert doctor for a species that only existed in story <br />
books a week ago. Then why couldn't we Transform each other into sorcerers?! Heck! Why <br />
not Transform each other into demigods?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee ears and eyes perks at the mention of possible semi-godhood.  <br />
<br />
Jenny also found the idea of the princess of a wolf pantheon not entirely unpleasant. <br />
<br />
Abbey wondered if that kind of power would mean she could visit Camelot, Narnia, and <br />
Neverland. <br />
<br />
Samantha was curious, but more for it's own sake. <br />
<br />
Alice wondered where all this nonsense would go. <br />
<br />
Marcy and Kevin was thinking about Disney's version of Hercules. <br />
<br />
&quot;Even if the effects of a Turn we find can't extend beyond Glendale, Alice's expedition <br />
proves that we remain our new selves even outside of Glendale!  We could use a Transform <br />
to give ourselves an effect that anyone we interact with becomes a new Big Bad Wolf with <br />
the gender ratio we have now and mentally and emotionally loyal to the pack as a whole! <br />
And everyone THEY interact with, and so on! And the new Big Bad Wolf none the wiser or <br />
perhaps anyone who is not a Big Bad Wolf yet, we could spread from Glendale and <br />
transform the world silently in days!  We wouldn't even NEED to fight a war! It would be <br />
the most silently peaceful cultural conquest that history will never remember!<br />
<br />
  If you don't want that kind of paper work Master from being Alpha Male of the world: <br />
then just imagine everyone inclined to wait on you and Alpha Female hand and foot like we <br />
do and never give it a first thought!  We can grant our gift of our upgraded selves to all <br />
humanity!  We could end rape, murder, discrimination and war! Yet everyone would still be <br />
a unique and individual Big Bad Wolf united in our loyalty to a pack that numbers in the <br />
billions!  We don't even need to do more than say hello to some random people on the <br />
buses out of Glendale and everything will take care of itself from there!   We could use the <br />
game to give ourselves the power to defend ourselves from ANY threat, to give people <br />
world peace but without the price of happiness and uniqueness! It'll be no more uniform <br />
then how all of humanity is now anthromorphic apes!  <br />
<br />
Or we could Transform ourselves into minor gods!  We need to make sure our new lives <br />
can't be stolen from us yes, but imagine ALL the possibilities of what we can do with the <br />
power we now hold!    The witches who did this figured who'd ever get this power would <br />
get use it to fulfill some random revenge fantasy and move on! But you Master! You! <br />
You've seen the big picture! Now think about the even larger picture!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen was stunned silent by the grand vision and possibilities laid out before him, he <br />
could greatly appreciate them. <br />
<br />
The teal Sandi said, &quot;Isn't that assuming the game COULD do all that?&quot;<br />
<br />
The white Lawrence said, &quot;The game in theory taps into the infinite chaos that is <br />
everything and thus nothing that 'exists' outside god's universe, I truly doubt anything is <br />
NOT possible!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Like us all becoming ultra powerful magic users and military geniuses without a day of <br />
study, or minor deities, or releasing a reality cascade virus that'll slowly turn the world into <br />
chummy and devoted wolf people like us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly!&quot; <br />
<br />
Among  the seventeen minor she wolves, sitting next to Sandi as always: The blue green <br />
she-wolf Terri thought of a legendary animated japanese movie she as a he had seen <br />
once, and a singular quote popped into her head, 'What if a amoeba was granted the <br />
power of a human? Amoebas don't build motorcycles or atomic bombs. They just eat up <br />
anything that gets in their way.' <br />
<br />
Terri spoke and implored, &quot;And what would we DO with that kind of power Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen looked at Terri surprised to hear the minors having so much to say. &quot;Eh?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Master even if we were given divine power and knowledge by the game we'd still have <br />
mortal desires and impulses. Gods shouldn't have those! Look at what it got the <br />
Olympians! What's... what's to keep us from blowing up the world next time we have... <br />
have PMS.&quot; <br />
<br />
All the she wolves blushed at this, the former males blushing just a little bit more. <br />
<br />
Jensen realized he had been here before,  he was back at the same mental road block he <br />
had thought of back on the first day he had created his pack this week.  What would he <br />
and his pack do once their survival was no longer a question? <br />
<br />
Mr. P sighed, &quot;I hate to say it but: A population needs fifty members to survive short term, <br />
we only have thirty-eight, to survivel long term it needs five hundred members.  We're <br />
simply going to eventually need more Big Bad Wolves. <br />
<br />
 -But-, from what Kevin and Marcy told me they read on-line, we're playing a so-called <br />
'game' with a CURSE spat out by a trio of being executed witches who lived to spread <br />
discord! The damn thing could just be waiting to backfire on us!!  The less we use the <br />
damn thing the better! It was damn made to make people's lives MISERABLE and <br />
encourage others to be jackasses with no consequence! How much can we really trust it?&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Of all the place to pick for us to hide out until we've faced off against the wolf harem... <br />
why this place?&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it's the one place that the wolf harem will never ever come to and have no idea to <br />
look for us here.&quot; Madam Serenity said, Paul holding several of her bags behind her at his <br />
own insistence. She was an old woman after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;Still.... this house ... where the old guy saw the wolves come out us? Aren't we tress <br />
passing?&quot; Trevor asked laying on the couch. <br />
<br />
&quot;I pulled some high stakes bluffs, counted on the police's phobia of the game, and <br />
basically we're in a 'don't ask, don't tell' position with mooching off of here until the <br />
month runs out and they shut off the utilities.&quot; <br />
<br />
Paul made a very deep and disapproving frown a Serenity. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry. I didn't threaten anyone, I just pointed out they wouldn't want to sell a house <br />
with a curse on it and I promised to sweep it for such, and since they can't legally <br />
acknowledge curses exist, but at the same time can't risk selling a cursed place in <br />
Glendale, we're free to stay while I do my work... and I am undoing the curse here... I'm <br />
going to undo the curse on the people who lived here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Paul accepted this and continued to move in Serenity's bags. <br />
<br />
&quot;So now the wolves will come to an empty house.&quot; Trevor said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... that should leave them confused for a bit, maybe they'll think we fled town and <br />
drop their guard... if we're lucky... that aside, YOU little cat need time to HEAL... that <br />
monster could have bitten your leg off and almost did! You're on the mend! Deal with it!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... this is going to be a long few days...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you even heal that fast...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look it's not like as a cat you'd normally do more than eat, sleep, and stare into space <br />
anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... very funny.&quot; Trevor said in a very unfunny tone, then turn a pencil turned on the TV, it <br />
was on the shopping channel and showing off a scratching post.  &quot;Pst, liars, the owner of <br />
the pet store kept getting returns on that brand... &quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity didn't say anything, ANYTHING that took Trevor's mind off of Queen's death and <br />
the time he'd spend needing to heal were all good things! <br />
<br />
'In the mean time I'm going to learn every bloody thing I can about the Smiths, wolves, and <br />
anything else that I'll need... don't worry Trevor, I'm not going to waste my time while you <br />
heal watching the soaps...&quot;</p>
