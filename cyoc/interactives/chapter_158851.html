<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;What do you want&#39; Daddy had asked Dave. What did he want? They were discussing my future yet here I was being treated like a commodity made to order for Dave&#39;s liking! Anger began to well up inside me. Anger at Dave, anger at Daddy, anger at everyone for conspiring to reduce me to this state. As I seethed inside, Dave withdrew his hand from my groin and that just made me even angrier. He coaxed me off his knee so he can stand up, but as my feet touched the carpeted floor I suddenly felt I lacked the strength to stand by myself. I began to stumble backwards, but I felt a strong, steadying hand on my shoulder as Dave caught me.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ger offf me&#39; I mumbled, feebly trying to push Dave away but his grip was like an iron vice I could not escape from. &#39;Is he ok?&#39; Dave asked Daddy&#39;. Daddy just shrugged &#39;I think the drugs you gave him last night are wearing off.&#39;<br />
Last night? We had been in the hotel bar last night, catching up with each other. Dave had been sent to the San Francisco office whereas I&#39;d been stationed in Los Angeles. This retreat was the first time we&#39;d seen each other in almost a month since we&#39;d joined the company. Dave had insisted on buying the drinks, handing me my glass. We toasted our shared success and gulped the whiskey down. And he had keenly watched me, making sure I had downed every drop.<br />
I slunk onto the end of the bed &#39;You drugged me?&#39; I said accusingly. He stood before me, his crotch dominating my eyeline, his erection palpably visible within his suit. He reached down and gently upchucked my chin so I was looking into those hazel eyes. &#39;Of course I drugged you. I thought it would make this easier for you&#39;.  Each word stoked the fury inside me to higher levels, but it was bottled up in the body of a weak, emasculated child. I expressed my anger as only a weak, emasculated child could. I burst into tears.<br />
&#39;It worked too.&#39; Daddy added. &#39;He went with me like a pliant lamb. Now, shut him up and let&#39;s get down to business. I want to get you sorted so I can get back to my own vacation&#39;.<br />
&#39;Of course Daddy,&#39; Dave said. &#39;Adam, be a good boy and be quiet for a few minutes. The grown ups are talking&#39;.<br />
The grown ups. The adults. Not including me. Everything they said just reinforced my lowly position. I wanted to ignore Dave of course, I wanted to fight back. But he loomed over me, gigantic in size, with an expression that was almost daring me to try something so he could prove a point. I simply gave a tiny little nod, and he returned a condescending, paternalistic smile. &#39;That&#39;s my boy&#39; he said as he patted my head. I curled into myself, ashamed at my connivance in my own emasculation.<br />
<br />
&#39;Alright&#39; Daddy began at last. &#39;Are YOU happy with yourself?&#39;<br />
Dave was a titan. He filled the room with his stature, his muscular physique and his alpha male, domineering personality. He was as close to physically perfect as I imagined it possible for someone to be. And despite myself, thinking these thoughts caused my tiny little cocklet to sprout a miniscule stiffy I prayed he wouldn&#39;t notice.<br />
&#39;More than satisfied Daddy. I took my pills yesterday.&#39; He beat his chest once, &#39;I&#39;ll be thirty one and in the prime of my life forever&#39;.<br />
<br />
&#39;Good for you son. I see great things for you in the future at the company. But let&#39;s sort little Adam before we &#39;lock&#39; him in too&#39;. Both of them turned to look at me now. &#39;Lock&#39; me in? They planned to keep me in a degraded little body forever? No, they couldn&#39;t! They wouldn&#39;t! I wanted to say something then, anything, to protest. But anything I had to say died on my lips under the gaze of those two adults. They were bigger than me, stronger than me and older than me. And anything they wanted to do to me, they would do. All resistance offered was pain. Dave&#39;s words came back to me, he thought I was too young, too small. I grasped onto that, desperate for some amelioration of my condition.<br />
<br />
&#39;As I was saying&#39; Dave began, &#39;you&#39;ve made him too young and his dick is ruined. I want something to play with&#39; he said with a grin.<br />
Daddy took a red pill and a purple pill off the desk. &#39;The red pill neutralises the youthenising agent rapidly&#39; he said, holding the diamond shaped, ruby coloured pill. &#39;If he eats it, it will begin to reverse his regression rapidly. He&#39;ll be a thirty year old again after precisely one hour, the dosage is precisely calculated as right now, he&#39;s physically ten.&#39;<br />
 &#39;Alright&#39; Dave continued &#39;so the red pill undoes the transformation at a rate of a year every three minutes. And then?&#39;<br />
&#39;When he reaches the age you want, you feed him this,&#39; and he held up the purple pill. &#39;You&#39;re familiar with this one?&#39; Dave nodded, but I hadn&#39;t seen it before. Daddy noticed the expression of puzzlement on my face. &#39;This my lad is the lock, no youthenising agent, it will just stop your aging process completely. You&#39;ll remain in Dave&#39;s ideal form permanently.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Daddy&#39; Dave said at last. &#39;Hand me the curtain cord please. We have to be sure this goes right.&#39;<br />
&#39;What do you mean?&#39; I squeaked as Dave approached me hold the cord taut between his two meaty fists. &#39;I mean I am taking no chances&#39; Dave said. Either fear or courage drove me then, but I tried to scramble across the bed, to get away from Dave and Daddy. I didn&#39;t stand a chance of course. I felt a hand lock around my ankle and pull me backwards. &#39;Let me go!&#39; I cried, trying to kick at them with my free leg only to find that Daddy had grabbed it in my strike in one hand. Daddy began binding my legs together while Dave had moved up to the foot of the bed to have easier access to my arms. Soon I was completely tied up and immobilised on the bed, looking up at the two men who had done this to me.<br />
<br />
&#39;Awww look he got a little stiffy&#39; Daddy said mockingly at the almost imperceptible bulge in my shorts. &#39;Looks like little Adam likes being manhandled by some actual men&#39;. Dave didn&#39;t look quite so pleased. He held up the red pill &#39;will this fix that? I want him to have a dick that&#39;s appropriate for him.&#39; Daddy looked a little exasperated &#39;Well I think it&#39;s adorable just the way it is but yes, the neutraliser will fix it if that&#39;s what you want.&#39; <br />
<br />
As Dave sat down next to me, Daddy went back over to the desk and turned the laptop around so we could both see the screen, currently covered in incomprehensible spreadsheets. A few clicks brought up a large timer. &#39;So, you feed him the red pill first to begin the process. Three minutes per year. When it hits the year you want, make him eat the purple pill&#39;.<br />
<br />
&#39;Adam&#39; Dave said, almost whispering as he lay down next to me, gently stroking my golden hair. His breath was warm and laced with tobacco. &#39;Do you remember when you brought me to your mother&#39;s house a few years ago?&#39;<br />
My mother was dead of course. So was my father, but he had died when I was a baby whereas she had died to cancer shortly after I had left college. I had no brothers, no sisters and I had to go back to my old home to see if there was anything I wanted. I couldn&#39;t think of anything, I was just glad the drunken old harridan was dead, but Dave had encouraged me to go back, for closure. We spent an hour rummaging through the mad old drunk&#39;s detritus before I decided I had had enough and stormed out.<br />
&#39;I found something while we were there you see&#39;, he slipped a hand into his pocket and withdrew a picture, one I hadn&#39;t seen in years, one that now made my blood run cold. It was me on a beach, on one of the few good days I could remember from my childhood. I was shirtless,  my hair as golden as the sand I was sitting on spilling down my shoulders, looking up at the camera with a big goofy grin. I was thirteen and a half.<br />
<br />
&#39;I took this that day you know. You didn&#39;t see, because all you wanted to do was forget. But this&#39; he waved the photo in front of my face, &#39;this is the perfect you. Growing up for you, it&#39;s just another year further from this, further from perfect. And I&#39;m not going to allow that to happen&#39;. He took the red pill in his hand. &#39;Set it for ten minutes Daddy.&#39; And with that, he forced my jaw open, popped the pill into my mouth. I swallowed it greedily. I had one shot, to take the red pill and then resist the purple pill for as long as possible, every moment I resisted was a part of my age back.<br />
<br />
Slowly, I began to feel the changes. I could feel myself growing, gaining musculature. The cord binding my legs and hands began to chafe as my limbs expanded. Dave loosened them slightly as the process went along. I looked down at the tight shorts I was wearing. I could feel my dick expand in size faster than any other part of me, the bulge of the shorts filling out. Soon, the clothes Daddy had forced me to wear became too tight, almost painfully so, but they were so flimsy  my growing body just tore through them, leaving them little more than rags draped across my growing frame. <br />
And then Daddy shouted, &#39;NOW&#39;. I looked at the readout, it was just shy of ten minutes. This was my moment. I had to resist, here and now, to reclaim my age, to reclaim my manhood. I took a moment to prepare, ready to throw myself off the bed, knowing that each subsequent moment would make me stronger, strong enough to fight back. <br />
But Dave simply pinched my nose in that moment. Relexively, my mouth opened, and the purple pill dropped onto my tongue. Before I could respond, Dave closed my mouth again and slowly stroked my throat. I felt the pill vanish into my belly. It was over in seconds.<br />
I took in deep, gasping breaths. Dave stood over me triumphantly as Daddy came into view.<br />
&#39;Are you satisfied son?&#39; Daddy asked.<br />
Dave reached down, and threw back the tattered remanants of my shorts. My young erection, surrounded by a golden crown of pubescent hair, was straining for relief, relief it had been begging for since he had sat me on his knee. Dave&#39;s meaty fist wrapped around it, still dwarfing it and he gave one, two, three sharp tugs.<br />
I exploded, spilling cream across his hand. &#39;Yes&#39; Dave said as he licked at the pearly trail I had left on his hand. &#39;He&#39;s perfect again&#39;</p>
