<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><b><i>Just Before the Show</i></b><br />
Glynn had just arrived at the fair with his best friend, who had just become his foster sister Rachel, at 13 they were both allowed to wonder around the fair unsupervised. <br />
“So, what should we do first?” asked Rachel.<br />
Glynn was going to answer, but when he turned towards Rachel, his eyes fell upon a large tent not too far behind her.<br />
It was odd. He shouldn’t have noticed the tent at all, as it seemed to melt into the background of the bustling carnival. Maybe it was because the tent itself was dark colored, or that unlike its surrounding buildings, the tent didn’t have any decorative lights on its outside.<br />
And yet something kept Nate staring at it.<br />
Light did shine out from the tiny ripped seams on the tent’s canopy, and through the flapped entrance. A wooden placard near the entrance had the words, ‘THE WONDERS OF SORCERER SPECTRA’, written in bold, side-show style letters. Above these words was a fancy drawing of a masquerade mask, with green mystical light from each eye hole swirling in a hypnotizing spiral.<br />
And further below all of that was a phrase in smaller, less dramatic letters: ‘Magic for Kids!’<br />
“Hey, look over there”, Glynn says pointing at the tent, “there’s a magic show, want to have a look?”<br />
“Oh yeah, that could be interesting, why not,” she responds.<br />
They walked over to the tent entrance, weaving past a few other groups who took no notice of the tent. They were just a few steps away when suddenly, the head of an odd bald man popped out from the door flap.<br />
“Hello there! Come for the magic show?”<br />
Glynn and Rachel nodded.<br />
“Great!”, the man said with an unnervingly wide grin.<br />
“Well, what are you waiting for kids?” the man in the tent asked. “Step right in! Show’s about to start!”<br />
The man then put his head and hand back through, leaving Glynn and Rachel alone next to the tent entrance <br />
“He’s kinda creepy”, Rachel says, “This is gonna be cool,” with a wide, expecting grin on her face, “Come on!”. She stepped through the flap, and Glynn followed right behind him, letting the carnival noises fade behind him.<br />
<br />
After passing through a small room with another flap door (with the weird guy from before nowhere to be seen), Glynn and Rachel found themselves facing a gap between the shadowed backs of two seating stands. Though they couldn&#39;t see anyone else, they could hear the buzzing and laughter of a whole audience of kids. From the gap, they could see a wooden stage at the other end of the tent.<br />
Glyn and Rachel walked forth. Unlike the outside of the tent, the insides of the tent glowed a bright pumpkin orange, with walnut-brown stripes running down the sides. It kind of reminded them of the inside of a jack-o-lantern. It was also much larger than it looked from the outside.<br />
The seating stands were packed with at least three dozen children of different ages, and not a single adult in sight, in fact they were actually the oldest children there it looked like the next oldest was only 11. “Hey, let’s sit over there!”, said Rachel, as she pointed to two empty seats in the middle row of the left side stand. They proceeded up the steps leading up the stands.<br />
As Rachel took her seat, Glynn looked out at the stage, which was a painted wooden platform shaped like a large half-circle. Though there were dark green drapes hanging behind the stage, there weren’t any curtains around the stage meant to hide anything backstage. Glynn wasn’t sure where this ‘Sorcerer Spectra’ would come out from, especially when there’s no other exit flap around.<br />
<br />
Finally lights around the tent start to dim.<br />
“LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BOYS AND GIRLS,” a male announcer called out from a speaker. Rachel and Glynn assumed it was from behind the bleachers, as they couldn’t see them anywhere near the stage. “PLEASE SIT DOWN, AS WE PRESENT TO YOU, THE WONDERS OF SORCERER SPECTRA.”<br />
As the announcer quieted, quite a number of kids ignored the announcer’s words and continued their chatter.<br />
Then suddenly, there was a loud bang and a flash from the center of the stage, and the lights instantly dimmed from a glowing orange to a dark foreboding green. Every child in the audience quieted as smoke and fog began to seep from the floor of the stage, pooling into a thick, green cloud.<br />
<br />
Rachel and Glynn watch on in amazement as the Sorcerer first turns himself in to a women then a man with breast, before flashing his dick to the entire tent, at which point Rachel whispers to Glynn “This seam kinda of inappropriate given the age of the kids here, we only got to look at pictures in sex Ed, and only just this year.”<br />
“Yeah but that’s school, remember, we had a look at our differences when we were 10.”<br />
“Yeah but remember, how pissed out parents were, about that,” Rachel reminds him as the Sorcerer morphs his dick into a vagina, to show the boys.<br />
“Well there no parents here to get upset.” Glynn, states.<br />
Only to be reinforced as the Sorcerer says “I could tell you how they work, buuut you can ask your parents once the show’s over. For now…”<br />
The Sorcerer paused. “Hmmm…yes, why not.”<br />
She snapped her fingers, and like the underwear, the suit and the fallen pants vanished. Not split apart, not torn to shreds, but vanished into thin air, leaving the woman’s large rack fully exposed from her chest. Sorcerer Spectra was now completely naked except for her top hat, her sparkling cape, and her leather boots.<br />
A few kids in the audience manage to find their voices again, and they gave several more shocked ‘ewws’.<br />
“Oh don’t be so surprised, they’re just breasts!”, the Sorcerer exclaimed. “I’m 100% sure some of you used to drink from these things.”<br />
Now this got both boys and girls in the audience blushing.<br />
“Your parents probably won’t want you to see these things. Well, they’re not here right now, aren’t they?”<br />
<br />
Already shocked by the Sorcerer display of his personal transformation they watch on in incredulity as Caleb is first turned into a baby before is formerly younger sister Olivia, eagerly joins him on stage to be transformed herself. As they watch Olivia become her new baby brothers’ diaper, they both gasps in shock. Glynn thinks about how he learned that Rachel still wears diaper to bed, due to a bed wetting problem, when he moved in with her family when her parents agreed to foster him after his parent’s death, the previous year. He been shocked to learn that she’d keep it a secret from him because she was embarrassed about her needing diapers, and scared of what he’d think, he though actually found the idea of her in a soggy diaper hot, and even talked her into letting him change her each morning. But now after watching Olivia become a diaper for her brother, he wonders what it would be like to become Rachel’s diaper and be press up against her crotch all night and her peeing in him causing him to become aroused and excited thinking it what be so much better than playing with her soggy diapers behind her back once she’s finished with them.<br />
“She must be hypnotized, mustn’t she?” comments Rachel, “She couldn’t possibly be happy about turning in to her brother’s diaper, shouldn’t she be panicking about him using her?”<br />
“I don’t know” replies Glynn, “I think becoming my sisters diaper, knowing I’m going to be pressed up against her all night and have her pee in me is kind of exciting,” he finishes winking at her, “I think it would be a lot more fun than just changing you.”<br />
Then the Sorcerer lets them hear Olivia’s thoughts, “Ok Olivia, now share your thoughts with those in this tent for as long as you hold this form.&quot; Spectra says waving a swift hand over Olivia’s former face.<br />
<b>Oh this is so much fun, how long do you think it will be until he has to pee again?</b> she laugh with delight, <b>But what then, can I become a fresh diaper daily so he can use me over and over that would be fun. Oh I guess he will do more the pee in me.</b> Olivia happily giggles.<br />
Then they hear some crazy girl call out &quot;Come on let us hear her real thoughts not whatever you hypothesized her to say. No way would she be happy about being peed and pooh in by her brother.&quot;<br />
<b>&quot;So you would accuse me of lying would you,&quot;</b> questions Spectra in a dangerous tone.<br />
Then Olivia responds <b>But those are my real though I&#39;m so excited to have my brother pee and poo in me over and over, Oh I know exactly what I want to happen he can stay just as he is now, and I be his diaper until he wakes in the morning then sit in the trash with his other diapers until its time for him to be put down for the night again then I become his new diaper, that would be so much fun.</b> she giggles away happily, <b>Oh I know you should try out being your brothers diaper then you&#39;d get to know just how much fun this is.</b><br />
Spectra grins &quot;What a excellent idea you had Olivia,&quot; waving a hand at the girl and her twin brother, causing them to rise up and float over to the stage, &quot;As a reward I&#39;ll grant your request, your brother will stay a little baby, and you will get to serve as his night time diaper every night before join his dirty diaper in the trash for the day forevermore.&quot; waving a hand across Caleb from head to diaper, finishing with a tap on Olivia the diaper. Meanwhile the girl and her brother arrive on the stage clearly paralyze and unable to move.<br />
<br />
Watching the girl Katie get turned into a diaper for her brother Nate, and hearing about how he’s going to be forced to use her as his sole diaper for the rest of his life, Rachel thinks about her own bedwetting problem, she’d been so scared about what Glynn would think when he moved in, but he’d just though it was hot, and want to change her, she’d been changing her self for years, but the idea of Glynn changing her each morning was just so exciting so she let him change her, she found him cleaning her up felt so good, and often wondered if he might try doing more than just clean her up some morning. She also though about her suspicion that he wasn’t just getting rid of her soggy diapers, after changing her but possibly keeping them for a bit first, and how hot she though that was, she been going to confront him, but it just never seamed like the right time. Then there was his comment about Olivia, and how the idea of being her diaper excited him, she was thinking about what it would be like for him to be her diaper, to use him, over and over, like Nate was going to Katie, she found the idea was hotter than the idea of Glynn playing with her soggy diapers.<br />
“Hey, dose the idea of being my diaper really excite you? Me peeing in you?” Rachel asks Glynn, then she decide now is the perfect time to confront him asking, “Have you been playing with my soggy diapers, after changing me like I suspect? Dose my pee turn you on?”<br />
Glynn’s face blushes bright red at her question, before he mumbles, “Yes, Yes to everything.”<br />
Then Spectra asks &quot;Well I think that makes it clear I didn&#39;t need to hypothesis Olivia she just like&#39;s being her brothers diaper unlike Katie, but the little bitch deserves her fate. Now how about some more volunteers or do we need to wrap up the show?&quot;<br />
Rachel nudges Glynn, “Well, are you going to volunteer, I kinda like the idea of you being my diaper too, It would be fun to know I’m actually peeing in you rather than just another diaper?”<br />
“Ok,” Glynn responds, before Jumping up, and pulling her up after him, he calls out “Yes, I want to help my new sister with her bed-wetting by being her diaper every night for however long she needs me.”</p>
