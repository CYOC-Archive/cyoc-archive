<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom stood in horror and shock inside his house with one total stranger and his wife, and after hearing his wife say his son transformed into a monster... and that so was she. It all sounded like it was too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't feel so good,&quot; Mark repeated his earlier complaint as he turned to look to Tom, pleading for something.<br />
<br />
Tom only looked down to see Mark's eyes shift to a bright golden color, and fur, matching his hair color, begin to grow on his face and neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help me!&quot; Mark pleaded, revealing lengthening canines.<br />
<br />
Tom jumped away from the man in horror, only to be grabbed by his wife and pulled into a tight hug, but it was one that indicated great fear and nervousness more then anything else. Tom also cringed as he felt lengthening claws dig into his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help me!&quot; Denise repeated Mark's plea even more urgently.<br />
<br />
Tom tried to get out of her grasp, but found that Denise was now stronger then he was. He couldn't get away, an he was too scared and confused to know what to do. He tried to bring his arms up to push Denise back for a moment, when she suddenly screamed with pain and gripped him even tighter. Her claws were really starting to hurt him, but he soon heard audible cracking sounds, which indicated what was making Denise scream.<br />
<br />
Her feet were lengthening,and had already torn through the socks she had been wearing with claw tipped toes. Her dark brown fur was growing thicker and was growing at a faster rate, and then Tom noticed another thing. Her overall size was growing. She was starting to rapidly put on additional muscle mass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help me!&quot; Denise wailed in pain, &quot;help me! It hurts so much!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm getting out of here!&quot; Mark gasped in horror and began to move out of the building, but Tom noticed that the fur on him was growing slightly thicker, and his own claws were starting to grow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help me!&quot; Denise pleaded as her outer clothes lost the battle with her growing body.<br />
<br />
Tom was struggling harder to get away. His wife was changing into some sort of creature, right in front of him. Her growing frame had destroyed her outer cloths, and her underwear didn't look like it would last much longer, but her fur looked so thick that he doubted anything that the public shouldn't see would be visible.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot; Tom began to say when Denise suddenly dropped him, and then dropped to her hands and now very wolf-like legs.<br />
<br />
Denise was still screaming, but Tom couldn't pick out anything human in it. It sounded more like a pained roar. He tried to crawl away as he saw her bra snap under the pressure applied to it, and saw her watch him directly through yellow eyes. He face slowly began to push forward as her ears rose to the top of her head. She growled as her muzzle pushed out, and then for a brief instant was quiet, before a dark brown tail pushed out behind her, destroying her underwear in the process. Once fully in wolf form, Denise howled at her freedom.<br />
<br />
Outside, Mark heard the howl as he tried to stagger toward a hospital. He was scared out of his mind and too confused to bother looking for a vehicle. His feet hurt inside his shoes, and his clothing was getting tight. And he could hear howling in the distance.<br />
<br />
He made it a few steps across the street when collapsed from a sudden rush of pain and as his shoes split open to reveal lengthening feet, covered in fur and tipped with claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Mark screamed, not noticing the growling edge to it, and rolled over, trying to get up.<br />
<br />
He quickly found it difficult to get up, which he couldn't tell was because he was in so much pain or because he couldn't physically stand erect anymore. But, his mind was rapidly losing the battle to think over that issue as his own clothing began to rip open, as his own body grew larger. He found himself growling and snarling, and then actually pawing at his own clothes, trying to get them off.<br />
<br />
He finally succeeded in doing so, after some struggle as his body continued to grow. He had only just left his clothes shredded when he felt his face push forward.<br />
<br />
Back inside the house, Tom backed away from the large dark brown furred wolf in front of him. He prayed it wouldn't attack him, even though he felt oddly attracted to Denise's present form at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Denise?&quot; Tom asked hoping to get any sort of recognition that would help him.<br />
<br />
Denise meanwhile stared back intently. She felt ravenously hungry, but the man in front of her not only smelled like a member of her pack, but like he was far more important. He was her mate...</p>
