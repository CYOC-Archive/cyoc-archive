<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">PE had just finished, with Jake finding the 5km run easier than last time, and therefore finishing a few minutes before the others. The teacher said that he could just head to the showers, but after that, he&#39;d taken a quick look at Jake, saying to him: &quot;Well, the workout&#39;s doing you good, son. Just make sure to actually shower, because you reek as hell.&quot; As he walked to the showers, Jake was flustered. That was the first time Mr. Ackie had given him a compliment. Also, he did smell his odor, but it didn&#39;t smell too bad - not to him, at least. All this had something to do with that blue cum and the color of the pool, he was sure of it.<br />
<br />
After that episode the day before, he&#39;d been so exhausted he barely had had any time to mop any of the blue stuff. He&#39;d saved a small sample in an Evian bottle stored safely in his closet, pouring the rest down the drain and then falling asleep with his clothes on. When he awoke the following day he had felt starved again, which of course led to an encore of the previous feast. Now, this one was much smaller, but still about double the amount of food he usually ate for breakfast. He also had had time to think about a strategy. Maybe he could bring the sample of blum to the school lab when no one was there, to analyze it to the protocol? Somehow, he doubted that it was all over - the exceptionally strong BO hadn&#39;t appeared before noon.<br />
<br />
A voice reached his ears as he walked. &quot;Hey! Wait up!&quot; The speaker was the new guy, Kevin or something. He was average in height, with about the same build that Jake had now, but with dark hair and eyes, as well as a fine-featured face. He was good-looking, as far as Jake could say, but more of a prettyboy than both himself and any of the others he knew. &quot;You&#39;re Jake, right? I&#39;m Kenny.&quot; Right, Kenny, not Kevin. &quot;I didn&#39;t bring sneakers, so I had to do weight training instead.&quot; He seemed nice enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Jake said, &quot;heading to the showers? I was just going there myself.&quot; They discovered that they had some things in common. Both had a younger and an older brother, both were fans of reading books, though apparently Kenny preferred fantasy to science fiction, which baffled Jake, but to each his own. Kenny led with most of the questions. &quot;So, you&#39;ve always been this strong a runner? Teach said you left everyone in the gravel back there.&quot;<br />
What to say to such genuine curiosity? The truth, why not? Augmented, of course. &quot;Yeah, no, I&#39;ve been running all summer, so I guess it&#39;s starting to pay off.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, really smells like you went real hard there. Yeesh!&quot; Kenny held to his nose, acting out some Victorian lady&#39;s way of swooning out of disgust. Jake laughed as they entered the locker room. They undressed, keeping the chatter going. A few times, Kenny just stopped what he was doing, sniffing into the air, then continuing as if nothing had happened. Oh no, Jake thought to himself, this can&#39;t be part of it too, can it?<br />
Carefully, Jake stepped into the showers, removing his towel and taking a look at himself before Kenny could come in. It was clear that he was bigger down there, just judging from his flaccid dick. He had lost his abs, of course, but surely they could be rediscovered with some hard work. Thinking about his changes, he realized he was chubbing slightly, and then he felt something that he hadn&#39;t before. He felt a... pull... from behind, compelling him to turn around, as his vision changed color.<br />
<br />
This time, everything didn&#39;t become blue, but everything instead had a red tinge, like around the edges of everything there was a crimson-colored fire. As he turned around, he saw Kenny standing a few yards away from him, drinking in the sight, eyes wide open, his dick at full mast. &quot;Kenny...? What are you doing?&quot; Kenny walked over to him, as in a trance, kneeling before him, touching Jake&#39;s dick, rubbing it. Jake reacted barely at all. He wanted to jump away, he wanted to yell at Kenny to get away, but he... couldn&#39;t. He couldn&#39;t stop Kenny from massaging his dick to erection, he couldn&#39;t walk away, he couldn&#39;t stop his hands from grabbing hold of Kenny&#39;s hair and pushing his head firmly towards his dick. This was fucked up beyond reason. Why the fuck couldn&#39;t he stop himself? This... this odor, this red vision, was it making him do this? Was it making Kenny do this!? He couldn&#39;t focus, as Kenny slid his lips up and down his fat dick. He took it like a champ, the full eight plus inches, massaging Jake&#39;s balls as he went. This is wrong, Jake thought, why aren&#39;t you stopping this!? he yelled in his mind, but his body did not answer to command. <br />
<br />
*Elijah&#39;s POV*<br />
<br />
Peeking around the corner and into the shower was little Elijah. He&#39;d always been of the curious type, quick to brag but lacking much to show for it. Now, he watched as his friend Jake - who&#39;d bloated up recently and then receded - was being sucked off by the new guy, Kenneth. Or Kenny, whatever. The point was; that wasn&#39;t the same dick they&#39;d been measuring, he was sure of it. And those certainly weren&#39;t the same balls - as Elijah spied on the slight, slender boy sucking off the taller, lean one who&#39;d until recently had a solid skinnypack, he noticed Jake&#39;s balls were swelling bigger and bigger, stretching his ballsack to its utter limits and then some, taking up more and more space between his thighs. &quot;Oh God,&quot; Jake moaned deeply, and then his balls, now the size of cantaloupes, contracted upwards, and Kenny began gulping, drinking the milk like a champ. Elijah was stunned, and super boned. He watched Jake grab Kenny&#39;s head and thrust his huge cock down the shorter boy&#39;s throat, pumping liquid down his gullet. It must have lasted minutes, Kenny having come at the first thrust, and weakly ejecting more, his belly stretching like after a huge meal. <br />
<br />
Finally, as Elijah heard the voices of the other boys in the hallway outside the locker room, Kenny wrestled his way out of the grip of a Jake in seemingly heavenly bliss. They collapsed on their asses, both of them, as a few other boys trailed into the locker room, noticing Elijah standing there and jerking off, and then seeing the two in the showers; Kenny, sitting with his back against the wall, panting and breathing heavily, looking pregnant with his freshman-fifteen-looking bloat, and Jake, sitting supported on his elbows, his rock hard dick pumping streams of blue-tinted white spunk, with a tell-tale look in his face, and his eyes now glowing blue.</p>
