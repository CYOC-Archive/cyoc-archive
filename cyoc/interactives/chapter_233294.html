<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gulping, Mike felt up the muscles he had. They weren&#39;t as big and bulky as they were before, but he was still incredibly fit, a muscular eighteen year old with some of the latent thickness from childhood he just couldn&#39;t shake off that only accentuated his strong body. With big pecs with a firm six pack, decently large biceps and thighs,  the young man was the football star he used to be, and so were his friends. Andrew was now back to 5&#39;10&quot; and still pretty jacked, but not as defined. Same with James. But Anthony had gotten much less buff, becoming slimmer due to his track background. Thankfully, it seemed they stopped shrinking from here. Mike could no longer feel the tingling inside of him. &quot;I...I think it stopped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this is just great...now what are we gonna do? We can&#39;t get into bars like this? We&#39;ll be turned away on sight!&quot; Andrew complained. &quot;It&#39;s not all bad, dude. We can still attract people with bodies like this. Maybe we can pick up some highschool girls.&quot; James tried to cheer him up. &quot;But...&quot; Unfortunately, Andrew seemed disappointed. He preferred someone with more maturity than that. Granted, he used to be an older man, so he was a bit jaded.<br />
<br />
Anthony looked at Mike. &quot;You should check the device. Why did it makes us younger than what we put in?&quot; Mike nodded. &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right. Gimme a minute.&quot; The jock went to the Chronivac and noticed a message.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOTE: Subjects too old to properly fit into current world relations. Adjusted age to still have proper connections to family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s mind had changed with new memories. Formerly a father, the older teen now had memories of growing up with his son as his brother, with his wife being his mother. &quot;So...what? We&#39;re our wives&#39; kids now?&quot; Andrew asked. &quot;That&#39;s what it sounds like. They would be old enough to have eighteen year old sons.&quot; Mike explained. &quot;...Heh...weird. I&#39;m my son&#39;s older brother now.&quot; He chuckled. He could recall taking Jeff to his own sports games at his highschool. The highschool they both went to now. His fatherly traits having carried over into being protective of him, making sure the other guys didn&#39;t bully him as the team&#39;s captain. <br />
<br />
Back in the day, he used to be the cocky jock himself, but with his knowledge as a former dad, he had a better head on his shoulders. Instead of being dumb and immature, Mike was kinder and had a lot of respect from the rest of the school. Though, a lot of the adult knowledge he used to have regarding things not pertaining to personality had started vanishing from his mind, making him mature, but with the level of knowledge a highschool jock typically would have. &quot;Ungh...bro...&quot; The teen held his head feeling a little disoriented.<br />
<br />
Andrew just sighed. &quot;I guess it&#39;s ok. I&#39;d rather be a teenager coming out of puberty rather than one on the other end.&quot; He looked down at his clothing. &quot;But what are we gonna do now? Mom can&#39;t see me coming home like this. She&#39;s gonna wonder why I&#39;m wearing clothes too big for me!&quot; He said, not realizing he&#39;d fallen into the mindset of calling his wife &#39;Mom.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;ll go get some clothes!&quot; Mike said before he went to Jeff&#39;s wardrobe to pull out some of his clothes to wear for now. He tossed them over to his friends. &quot;Here. Put these on. I&#39;m gonna go uhh...look for something better for me.&quot; The boy went over to the bathroom to change his own.<br />
<br />
Taking off his clothing, teen Mike stood in front of the mirror by himself naked. The young jock had only lost an inch or two, retaining his 6&#39;2&quot; height, having hit a big growth spurt when he hit thirteen. His face had all the handsome angles of adulthood, but with some of the roundness of childhood to give him a cute boyish charm. Below his thick neck, though, his body was anything but. Big and strong, Mike was the subject of affection and admiration of tons of girls at school, even some of the guys ogled him sometimes. He couldn&#39;t help but think of the nights he&#39;d slept with some of his classmates, making him flustered and causing his large nine inch cock to twitch and stiffen up. In fact, thinking about his friends in the other room was kind of turning him on now, too. He knew he had discovered his male attraction at some point in his life, but his female lean lead him to prefer girls anyway. Still, having the mind of a horny teen made it hard to focus. <br />
<br />
Taking a closer look, Mike saw he had no facial hair, or hair on his chest. But he did have quite a bit of dark hard on his forearms and calves. Lifting his arms, he looked at the dark bushes of damp hair in his armpits, smelling a bit of his natural body odor due to sweating a little from his shrinkage. &quot;Mmmgh...this feels so weird...&quot; Hearing himself mumble to himself, Mike finally took in the sound of his voice. It was still deep like a man, but it wasn&#39;t as rough with age as it used to be. In fact, it had no roughness at all. It was smooth, yet bass-y like a boy his current age might sound.<br />
<br />
Lowering his strong arms and shaking his head, Mike began to put on Jeff&#39;s clothes. While the clothes would probably fit his friends better, the young jock was much bigger than everyone else in the house. His son&#39;s, or rather his little brother&#39;s clothing felt a bit snug on his body due to it being clothing meant for a 5&#39;8&quot; sixteen year old, his shorts a bit small on his thighs, hugging his ass and making a defined bulge in the front while his shirt was form fitting against his muscles, especially his chest and his broad shoulders. They were a little too short too, the shorts reaching a bit above his knees and a bit of his v-shaped waist exposed, his stomach of which would only be revealed more if he raised his arms to stretch or reach for something. Needless to say, he needed better clothes.<br />
<br />
With all these thoughts and the tight feeling and slightly lewd view of his clothes hugging his body, Mike felt himself uncontrollably getting hard, his cock throbbing in his shorts. The eighteen year old in him felt the desperate need to touch himself and jack off, but he took a deep breath and held it in. Besides, he didn&#39;t have time to. His friends were waiting in the other room.<br />
<br />
...But would he want to go back to them with an obvious bulge? Mike&#39;s face went red with embarrassment feeling his teen hormones running wild inside of him. He needed to help them get acclimated...but he also really needed to relieve his sexual urges.</p>
