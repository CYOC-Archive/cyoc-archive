<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Billie Nods With Smile Thinking It&#39;s Worth It &quot;But We Will Probably Have To Deal With Ryan Too, He&#39;s Not Going To Want Us To Take The Device How Do You Suggest We Get It Without A Fight?&quot; Billie Asks<br />
<br />
Jess Says Thinking For A While &quot;You Know Him Best, Have Any Ideas?&quot;<br />
<br />
Billie Says &quot;I Have An Idea, But It&#39;s Risky...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jess Nods Billie Says &quot;Okay What Is It?&quot;<br />
<br />
Billie &quot;Well I Say, That I Want To Change You Further... When He Brings Out The Device I&#39;ll Take It From Him And Run!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess Says  &quot;Wait, You Want Him To Change Me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Billie Says &quot;No, But Otherwise The Device Will Be Kept By His Side The Whole Time And We&#39;ll Never Get The Chance To Take It! I Really Don&#39;t Have Any Better Ideas? Unless Of Course You Have Any Bright Ideas?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess Looks Defeated And Says &quot;No... But We Can Think Of One, I Really Don&#39;t Want To Risk Changing Any Further, I&#39;m Already To Girly!&quot;<br />
<br />
Billie Says &quot;That&#39;s It!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess Says &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Billie Says &quot;I&#39;ll Tell Him Your To Horny And Aggressive With Your Love... And I Want Him To Lower It... That Way Even If He Changes It, It Will Be Something You Actually Want Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess Says &quot;I Guess, I Mean It Could Work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Billie Says &quot;It&#39;ll Work, But There&#39;s One More Thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess Says &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Billie Says &quot;In Order To Convince Ryan, You&#39;ll Have To Be Extra Clingy And Forward In Front  Of Him Tp A Sense That It&#39;s Over The Top, Or Else He&#39;ll Just Say I&#39;m Being A Loser Or A Virgin And Tell Me To Suck It Up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess Says &quot;Alright... Although I Don&#39;t Want To That&#39;s Much Better, So I&#39;m Just Going To Be Extremely Clingy In Public.&quot;<br />
<br />
Billie Nods Jess Says &quot;Okay Ready? This Is Our Only Shot?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess Says &quot;Yea!&quot; She Says Grabbing Onto Billie&#39;s Arm And Kissing Her On The Cheeks And Forehead Leaving Some Really Obvious Lipstick Stains All Over Her Face And Clothes, And Holding Onto Billie Tight As They Made Their Way To Where Ryan And Macy Were...<br />
Macy And Ryan Look Up And Realize They Had Approached...Ryan Immediately Sees Lipstick Stains All Over Billie&#39;s Face And Asks &quot;Hey, What Happened With You Two!&quot; Jess Quickly Answers Says &quot;Don&#39;t Worry, Everything&#39;s Fine...It&#39;s Just Billie And I Bonding... You Know How It Is!&quot; Before Getting Really Close To Billie And Wrapping Her Arms Around One Of Billie&#39;s Pulling Billie Into An Embrace. Billie Gently Unwrapped Jess Around Her And Said Audibly &quot;Wait Right Here Babe... I Need To Talk To Ryan For A Minute, Ryan If You Would!&quot; Pointing Away From Jess As Both Girls Knew This Was Probably Either There Only Shot Or Ryan Would Not Be Easy To Persuade! Ryan Gets The Hint And Agrees To Walk Off A Distance With Her Alone.<br />
<br />
Billie Follows Ryan Who Asked &quot;So What Wrong? She&#39;s Clearly Into You Why The SOS?&quot; Billie Says &quot;You Saw Her Back There... That Was Her Being Reserved She Is Way To Horny... She Nearly Stripped Me Down In Public That&#39;s How Horny She Is... It&#39;s Too Much I Need You To Lower It Or I&#39;m Gonna Die!&quot; Ryan Says &quot;Really! She Doesn&#39;t Seem Too Bad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Billie Says &quot;Seriously, She Kissed All Over Me In Public And Tried To Get Inside My Pants I Thought She Was Going To Do It In Public When I Stopped Her... I Can&#39;t Have A Girl That Horny...&quot; Ryan Says &quot;Okay Calm Down, I&#39;ll Lower It For You&quot; Ryan Says Grabbing The Device From Out His Bag...  Billie Quickly Grabbed The Device Scrolled To Ryan&#39;s Profile And Made Him Unaware (He Forgot About The Device And All Of The Changes, That Were Made Using It)<br />
<br />
Ryan Then Turned To Billie (Forgetting Billy Was Ever A Boy, And All About The Chronivac) And Said &quot;So How&#39;s The Date Going? Aren&#39;t You Glad I Set It Up I Know You Weren&#39;t Positive About Liking Girls But I Knew You Would?&quot; Billie (Without Thinking) Says &quot;Um... Yeah Thanks&quot; Ryan &quot;I&#39;ll Leave You Two Alone Go Enjoy Your Date&quot; He Said Before Walking Off Billie Went Back To Jess And Took Her By The Hand While Saying &quot;I Did It, I Got The Device&quot; &quot;Really!?&quot; Jess Said Surprised<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep I Just Erased His Memory And Got The Device No One Know What It Even Does, He Doesn&#39;t Believe Me Or You Are A Boy And Doesn&#39;t Remember Anything He&#39;s Done!&quot; Billie Says Holding The Chronivac And Entering The Changes For Him To Go Back To Being A Man And Returning Her As A Man (Jess And Macy Still Girls) (Billy Was Now Back To Being A Boy With A Penis Again) (Billy Is No Longer A Girl)<br />
<br />
Jess Says &quot;Welcome Back Billy... Now My Turn!&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy &quot;Aren&#39;t You Forgetting Something?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jess Sighs And Says &quot;Seriously, The Kiss You Weren&#39;t Serious About That Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy Says &quot;I Told You I Am Serious About That, But It&#39;s Fair If You Don&#39;t Want To, I&#39;ll Just Keep You As A Girl Until You Do... So I Guess This Is Goodbye!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess Sighs And Says &quot;Wait Don&#39;t Go! I&#39;ll Kiss You...&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy Continued To Walk Away Saying As He Left &quot;I Don&#39;t Know That I Want You To Change Back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess Walks Fast To Catch Up To Billy And Grabbed His Arm Pulling Him Closer &quot;Don&#39;t Go!&quot; She Whispered Quietly, Which Made Billy Smile And Giggle, Which Only Ended As Jess Pulled Him Into A Loving Soft Kiss. After The Quick And Romantic Kissed Jess Blushed Profusely While Billy Just Smiled And Grabbed Jess&#39;s Ass The Kiss Wasn&#39;t A Peck It Was Full Blown Making Out. Billy Pulled Off And Said &quot;Okay, So Deal Done... But Are You Sure You Want To Change Back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess Looks Up At Billy And Says &quot;No...&quot; She Says Before Kissing Billy Again And Dragging Him To The Parking Lot And Into Jess&#39;s Car&#39;s Backseat Where They Begin Making Out Even More This Time With Both Their Hands Groping And Pulling Each Other Closer In A More Fervent Yet More Intimate Display Of Mutual Desire Until The Two Pulled Apart Panting For Breath And Both With Flushed Red Faces. Jess Said Looking In Billy&#39;s Eyes As She Panted And Trying To Regulate Her Breathing. As Billy Says &quot;Are You Sure You&#39;re Okay With Being A Girl Before We Do Anything We Might Regret?&quot; <br />
<br />
As Jess Smirked At Billy In Response, Before Saying &quot;Just Shut Up, I&#39;m Not Sure Of Anything But This Right Now So Just Shut Up And Enjoy It!&quot; She Says Pulling Off His Shirt While Kissing Billy Passionately. Which Billy Just Smirked And Let Jess Take Off Her Own Tee Shirt. Billy Laid Down Flat In The Back Of The Car, And Let Jess Straddle Him So That They Were At Eye Level With Each Other Jess Started Taking Her Bra Off... And Kissing His Neck All While Mumbling &quot;I&#39;ve Got You Baby&quot; <br />
<br />
Jess&#39;s Bra Was Now Off Revealing Her B-Cup Breasts In All Their Glory As Jess Laid On Top Of Billy In The Backseat Of Her Car And Laid On His Shirtless Body, And Wrapped Her Legs Around Billy&#39;s Waist. They Kissed And Groped At Each Other With Jess Whispering &quot;Do It, Just Do It Billy Please!&quot; As He Reached Under Jess&#39; Skirt And Started To Slide Her Panties Off Before Saying &quot;Are You Sure You Want Me To? I Don&#39;t Wanna Push You?&quot; Which Jess Replied In Between Kissing Billy By Saying &quot;Just Do It For The Love Of God Billy I&#39;m BEGGING You... Just Do It I Can&#39;t Wait Any Longer, If You Want This To Happen!&quot; Then Billy Did It After Reaching Under Her Panties, He Took Them Off. &quot;There You Go&quot; He Said Before Sticking His Dick Inside Her Which Created Some Discomfort For Jess As She Moaned In Both Pain And Pleasure.<br />
<br />
Billy Was Concerned But Jess Began Rocking Her Body Along Billy&#39;s Dick Which Billy Took As A Sign That It Wasn&#39;t Too Painful, And Billy&#39;s Finger Gripped On Her Ass Cheeks For Support Holding Them As They Both Came To A Simultaneous Orgasm With Billy Just Managing To Pull Out Before Cumming Inside Her...After Which Jess Rolled Off Billy And Pulled Her Dirty Underwear Back On Before Asking For Her Tee Shirt Back... Billy Just Smiled As He Got The Shirt Handed Over. <br />
<br />
Jess Pulled On The T-Shirt And Said With A Sigh &quot;I Can&#39;t Believe I Just Did That... But I&#39;m Also Glad I Did, You&#39;re Great At Sex So I Won&#39;t Mind You Sticking Around For Another Round When My Parents Aren&#39;t Home Sometime... Well Actually I&#39;d Like to Date You!&quot; Jess Rambles As Billy Just Looked At Jess Surprised<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait You Want To Date Me? Wait Does That Mean You Want To Stay A Girl?&quot; Billy Asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I Thought That Was Pretty Clear With The Sex? Jess Responds Still Getting Dressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait So Your Actually Staying A Girl Just For Me?&quot; Billy Asks<br />
<br />
&quot;I Wouldn&#39;t Say, Just For You...&quot; Jess Says Blushing And Denying What Was Obviously True While Folding Her Arms And Turning Away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait Your Seriously Staying A Girl For Me? I Thought You Weren&#39;t Attracted To Boys?&quot; Billy Questions<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Not... I&#39;m Not Attracted To Boys... I&#39;m Just Attracted To You!&quot; Jess Blushes Harder Turning Away And Folding Her Arms<br />
Billy Then Hugs Her From Behind And Says &quot;I Love You Too! But Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess Snuggles Deeper Into Billy&#39;s Embrace And Says &quot;You Remember How You Told Me That You&#39;ve Never Been Good With Girls, Well When I Was A Boy I Didn&#39;t Exactly Have The Best Luck Either... And Being Alone Sucks, So If It Means We Can Stay Together Maybe I&#39;ll Have Better Luck With You, Plus You Called Me The Hottest Girl You&#39;ve Ever Met So Maybe That Is Something!&quot; Jess Says Still Hugged By Billy And Being Smothered With Kisses<br />
<br />
&quot;I Love You So Much Jess&quot; Billy Says Lifting Her Up Into His Arms, And Into The Air Which Shocked Jess Until She Realized That This Boy She Wanted, And That He Could Easily Carry Her Around And Lift Her Up So She Wrapped Her Arms Around His Neck And Kissed His Cheek &quot;I Love You Too&quot; Jess Whispered Quietly Into Billy&#39;s Ear Before Kissing His Lips As He Set Her Back On The Floor Of His Car While She Just Stared Into His Eyes And Leaned Up For One Final Kiss.<br />
<br />
Billy Just Lets Jess&#39;s Lips Collide Against His Own With No Complaint Just Returning The Embrace, When Jess Finally Pulled Away From Him He Whispered &quot;What Now?&quot; As Jess Slipped Some Of Her Hair Back Into Her Bun As An Inattentive Tic While Blushing And Whispering Right Back &quot;Now? I Drive You Back To My Place And We Have Some Fun I A Bed Big And Strong Enough To Hold Up All Night!&quot; Jess Then Grabbed Her Keys Out Of Her Pockets And Then Texted Macy &quot;Find Your Own Way Home, I&#39;m Leaving With Billy</p>
