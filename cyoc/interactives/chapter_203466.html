<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">RK Palatine was everything that he claimed to be.  He didn’t necessarily want to be a god, but had seen the world that every other book holder would create, and none of them were good.<br />
<br />
One of the better futures had been the one created by Troy, the owner of the Book of Beasts.  He would turn the world into a mixture of anthropormophic and feral animals.  While not necessarily a bad world, per se, a lot of people would end up in zoos, on farms, or just stuck living an animalistic life out in the wild.  That wasn’t fair to those people and it wasn’t something that RK could allow to come to pass.  <br />
<br />
Still, Troy wasn’t malicious or evil, just a pervert.  That was why RK had approached him to begin with.  If Troy would ally and later surrender his book willingly, then everyone would be happy.  And while the Book of Divinity didn’t allow for perfect clarity, it still told RK that the chance of an alliance with Troy was quite high.<br />
<br />
Then Troy had rejected RK’s offer, which meant that RK couldn’t just sit around idle.  He had acted immediately – finding the owner of the Book of Body and making them the same offer he had made Troy.  To RK’s surprise, not only had Body accepted the offer, they had immediately given up their book in exchange for being turned into a sexy video game streamer girl.  <br />
<br />
RK had given them exactly what they wanted.  He had even let them hold onto the Book of Divinity while he changed them so they would remember their old life – on odd request, he thought, but one he granted nonetheless.  <br />
<br />
Then RK had ambushed Transmutation at a gas station just outside of town.  First, RK turned everything on his body into dicks – his limbs, eyes, mouth, nose, nipples, ass, everything was dicks.  Next, RK had taken his book and used it to turn his body into latex, leaving him as a freakish sex doll in a gas station bathroom.  That might seem a cruel fate, but RK knew just how evil Transmutation was and it wasn’t anything worse than what Transmutation had done to any of his victims.<br />
<br />
With Body and Transmutation secured, RK had turned his attention back to Troy and the Book of Beasts.  He spent all day looking into the future for some way to peacefully approach Troy.  Unfortunately, Troy firmly believed that he had been betrayed and no matter what RK did, Troy inflicted some horrible fate on him.  <br />
<br />
Approach Troy on the street?  Get turned into gerbil used as a living sex toy.  Knock on Troy’s door?  Get turned into skunk, have command used on him, then be forced to curl into a ball, shooting his spray up his own nose for the rest of his life.  Approach Troy in the park?  Get turned into a dog, then turned into a bitch once he finds the Book of Body.  Then be raped by a feral Rusty, and then, finally, get turned into a steaming pile of dogshit when its all said and done. <br />
<br />
RK didn’t think that Troy was a bad person.  But he certainly had a bit of anger control problem and didn’t take betrayal well.<br />
<br />
After hours of searching, the only path that RK could see with a positive outcome was to put Troy into a situation where he wanted to be with Rusty more than he wanted to get revenge on RK.  That meant turning Troy into a pregnant woman and Rusty into an invalid.  Troy would eventually succumb to his new body’s urges and give up, giving RK the book if RK would just fix Rusty and let them lead a normal, married life.  RK had no problem with that, and while it may be a bit cruel to change Troy’s life - and his desires - so dramatically, Troy was happy in the end and that was all that mattered.<br />
<br />
RK was so focused on finding a way to get the book from Troy that it had been a week since he had looked into his own future.  While he hadn’t been in immediate danger last time, a great deal had changed in the world since then.<br />
<br />
That’s why, as RK hung up the phone after finishing his conversation with Troy, he wasn’t paying attention to his surroundings.  If he had been, he would noticed the faint patter of light, clawed toes creeping along the floor behind him.<br />
<br />
RK sat in the living room of the house across the street from Troy, staring out the window content in his own victory.  He had no idea that a kobold was now just inches from his back.  And while a kobold is much smaller and weaker than a human, none of that matters when they have a steel club.<br />
<br />
RK had absolutely no idea of the danger he was in until the back of his skull exploded into his brain.  But by then, it was too late.<br />
<br />
“Ssstupid humans.  Books make master strong.  Master make kobolds strong.  So now you die.”<br />
<br />
The kobold gave the human’s head one last bash for posterity.  Then it grabbed his books and ran off.</p>
