<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Weeks had passed, and Julius was still preparing for his class with the familiar.  Everything had to be perfect before he was satisfied.  He spent time pouring over books trying to decide the right animal, and the right subject.  Julius knew he didn&#39;t have much time, as finals were starting to crawl around.  It didn&#39;t help that he often found himself helping his roommate Cody.<br />
<br />
Cody had followed Julius&#39; advice, and was spending more time studying.  There were times when he&#39;d spend close to all night at the library, returning to the dorm just before the library closed.  More than once, Julius came in to find Cody sleeping at the desk, open text books all around.  But despite the studying, and the extra help, Cody still didn&#39;t seem to be able to pull his grades up.  One particular night, Cody closed the book he had been reading and sighed in frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m really not cut out for this, nothing seems to make sense.&quot;  The husky young man complained.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Cody, maybe you&#39;re pushing yourself too hard.&quot;  Julius gently suggested.  Cody just looked downcast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I even here?  I&#39;m just wasting time and money doing this.  I won&#39;t amount to much anyway.&quot;  Cody slumped and turned the game console on.  Julius didn&#39;t know what to say.  He wanted to help his friend, but until he learned to help himself.....<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when the idea hit him.  It was risky, and it was close to impossible that the young man would agree to it, but it was still worth a shot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cody? Remember when we first met?&quot;  Julius gently asked.  Cody just grunted; Julius took that as a yes.  &quot;Remember how I said I might be able to use you as a resource?&quot;  That got Cody&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was wondering if you&#39;d be okay becoming my familiar for one of my classes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Familiar? You mean like one of those companion animals some of the students have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, exactly!  I&#39;d have to change you first, though, so if you&#39;re not comfortable never being human again, I understand.&quot;  Julius was nervous; if Cody said no, he&#39;d have to find another candidate.  Sure, he could always force him, but Julius felt it&#39;d be better if everyone involved was okay with the arrangement.  <br />
<br />
Cody didn&#39;t seem to notice what was happening on the screen as he thought about the offer.  On the one hand, he&#39;d never be human ever again, and therefore wouldn&#39;t be able to enjoy his favorite pastimes.  There was also the possibility he wouldn&#39;t get to choose what he was changed into.  On the other, it would give him a purpose in life........ Cody suddenly turned the game off and stood up, facing Julius.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I have to do?&quot; Cody asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand in the middle of the room.  It might also help if you stripped as well.&quot;  Julius instructed.  Feeling shy and selfconcious, Cody did as instructed.  Soon, the slightly overweight and hairy young man stood in the middle of his dorm room, completely naked.  He placed his hands over his dick and balls to preserve some sense of decency.  Julius didn&#39;t even notice as he shuffled through his notes and books making sure everything was just right.  &quot;Any particular animal you&#39;d prefer?  Other than dragon, that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, no, not really....&quot;  Cody was caught completely off guard.  He hadn&#39;t expected to be asked that, and even if he had, his first choice had been taken from him.  &quot;If I can&#39;t be a dragon, then....whatever you feel is best.&quot;  Julius looked Cody straight in the eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re completely sure?&quot;  Julius asked.  Cody just nodded and swallowed nervously.  He was hoping Julius would hurry up and finish this before he changed his mind.  Julius flipped through his book a few more times before he became satisfied and started to chant.<br />
<br />
As Julius chanted, Cody felt the peculiar sensation of magic forcing it&#39;s way through him.  His body began shrinking painlessly as fur started to grow all over his body.  It was creamy white on his chest and stomach, but changed to grey on his sides and back.  Black fur grew on his legs and arms as his hands became paws, his fingers becoming useless.  Cody stared as his nails grew and darkened into claws.  The same happened to his feet.  Cody tried to reach back as he felt a tail push its way out just above his ass, but his arms suddenly wouldn&#39;t allow that kind of movement anymore.  He was forced to all fours.<br />
<br />
Cody gasped suddenly as his vision changed, a snout slowly taking up the bottom half of his vision.  Cody could suddenly smell everything in the room as his nose darkened; had he really stunk that bad?  Blackish grey fur rushed to cover his face, while distinctive white stripes came in around his eyes and went down his back.  Finally, Cody&#39;s ears changed, shrinking and rounding out as black fur covered them, moving to the top of his head.  The magic left and Cody knew it was over.  <br />
<br />
Julius came over and looked down.  Cody was busy acquainting himself to his new body, especially his new sheath just above his fuzzy balls. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what did you choose?&quot;  Cody asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Badger.  I felt it was the perfect fit.  You&#39;re small enough to be easy to take care of, yet also allow you to be bold and retain some dignity as an animal.&quot;  Cody the badger nodded.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now I need to bond with you.&quot;</p>
