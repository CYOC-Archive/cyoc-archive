<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>there is a small Mental change going on with Bob, making him feel more like a kid, but finding childish things funny and enjoying childish activities fun and interesting. I&#39;m sorry I do not mention this in the story. i kind of forgot with it being such a small part of it.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bob and the group of boys finely get there, the sun is beating down on the baseball field, as Bob and his new friends prepared to play a game. Excitement filled the air as the kids organized themselves into teams. Bob was grateful for the opportunity to participate and bond with his new friends and find out more about his new life as Luck. <br />
 <br />
As the game began, Bob found himself in the outfield, ready to catch any fly balls that came his way. He enjoyed the thrill of the game, feeling a sense of being a kid and part of a team with his teammates. However, it didn&#39;t take long for things to take an unexpected turn. <br />
 <br />
During his turn at bat, Smiff, with a mischievous grin, intentionally aimed a wild pitch straight at Bob. Caught off guard, Bob was unable to react in time, and the ball struck him on the shoulder, causing him to stumble and fall to the ground, letting out a scream of pain. <br />
 <br />
Enraged by Smiff&#39;s malicious act, Bob&#39;s temper flared up feeling a childish rage inside him. He quickly got up, eyes burning with anger, seeing red confronted Smiff, shouting “what the fuck was that man, you did that on purpose you shit! The atmosphere grew tense as the other kids watched feeling shock and a thrill of a fight breaking out, with none of them heard Luke talk to anyone like this before? <br />
 <br />
Smiff, not one to back down easily, sneered at Bob, thinking Luke has finely found a back bone and does not feel like he needs him anymore, so he throws a punch at him, landing a solid blow on Bob&#39;s cheek. Pain shot through Bob&#39;s face as he staggered backward, clutching his eye. Smiff, smiles at what he had done, and says mostly to himself but load enoth for Bob to hear “who needs you” and took off running, disappearing into the distance, with two other boys following him, most likely his friends who think they can take Bobs/Lukes place, now wi Smiff hit his supposably best friend (Luke/Bob. <br />
 <br />
Bob&#39;s... well Luke’s friends rushed to his side, offering words of support and saying how they are glad you finely stuck up to Smiff . With them all seeming like they were happy with him shouting at Smiff and getting hit by him was a good thing?, he made him self get up, and wipe away the blood trickling from his nose. The game was stopped and the group of boys now all trying to think of how to take care of Bobs bleeping nose, with most of them thinking it was broken! <br />
 <br />
<br />
Jason, with the baseball pitch being the closest to his house, suggested they him and Bon should go to his place to clean up Bob&#39;s wounds. Bob was grateful for the offer, agreed straight away, happy to get away from all there&#39;s 9 to 12 year old boys crowding him, feeling a little unconfutable being a man in his late 20s yesterday, hoping that going  to Jason&#39;s home would provide a quieter place, and he liked Jason and found himself getting on with him walking here and even during the game him and Jason being on the same team, and found him self&#39;s talking and joking around with him more then the other kids, what he now knows like 3 more names of this group. <br />
<br />
Upon arriving at Jason&#39;s house, they were greeted by Jason&#39;s mother, she looked like a warm and caring woman. Concern across her face, as she saw Bob&#39;s black eye and bloody nose. Without hesitation, she fetched an ice pack and gently applied it to Bob&#39;s swollen eye. <br />
 <br />
As Bob sat there, feeling the ice cooling the throbbing pain, he couldn&#39;t help but feel grateful and liked the kindness Jason&#39;s mother shows. It made him think this is what he wanted in this new life as Luke, a mom who cares this much, but his new mom seems like she only really care for herself, like the one in his old life.  <br />
<br />
But he realized that his decision to befriend Jason had giving him a place where he can have such care, if he plays his cards right, while Bon was thinking this Jason grabed his shoulder, waking him from his deep thort and asked “are you ok now Luke? And when he looked to answer he felt a wanting for him to be close to Jason? And feeling happy that he chose Jason over the idiot Smiff, but it felt familiar, like when he first notict a girl he liked!  <br />
<br />
“Well shit, Luke must be gay?” Bob thort he had nothing agent people who are gay, and he did not feel really that panic about finding that the new him is now gay, so he took a breath and looked at Jason, he knew he is only an 11 year old boy now, and will need to wait a couple of years before getting into any sort of a “love” type of relationships. But looking at him did kids this age experiment feeling a strong wanting to be close to Jason, he took a deep breath again and poshed such feeling/thorts to the back of his head. <br />
<br />
 <br />
Over the next hour, Bob, Jason and Jason&#39;s mother talked and sharied stories. Bob felt happy being here in this home, he wished Luke&#39;s life was like Jasons, but was happy he has managed to become better friends with Jason with the real Luke seemed like he did not even try too before? To be honest the real Luke seemed like a push over and did what over people told him to do like Smiff and such, so Bob is kind of glad he decided to change Lukes life and did not pretend to be Luke and talk to Smiff when he called him out. <br />
<br />
 <br />
While Bob was thinking what to say to Jason of his mom, with him letting them talk for the last 4-5 minutes, Jason suddenly changed the subject his mom was talking about, and asked his mom out of nowhere “can Luke stay for a sleep over?”  <br />
<br />
His mom answered happily “yes that, that sounds like a great idea hoany”, putting a hand throw my messy hair, and added “well, if his mom says it is, ok?” Bob said quakily, surprisingly finding the idea of a sleepover with Jason a fun idea “uhm, I don’t think I will be able to get into contact with her, she works all night and only really around in the weekends when she takes me food shopping with her?” will that is what Bobs actual mum did, but Lukes mom seem mostly the same, but when Bon looked at Jason mom, she looked shocked! <br />
 <br />
All he could think was crap, he did not mean to say that, remembering most parents, are actually nice, and don’t act like his of Lukes mom,  <br />
<br />
but he saw her gulp and put a strong face on and, say “you know what... you can stay here an till your mom is back home, ok honey” Bob could not help but smile up at her, knowing he is going to be able to stay in this nice house and be with Jason, for the week, maybe every week, well if he knew mom lets me? he thort, and said “thanks!” and found myself rapping his small skinny arms around her saying “Thaks, miss” and then run up stars after Jason, with Jason saying that we can play on his new game, what he was talking about when they first met, but Bob found myself staring at Jasons ass going up the stairs, what he quikly looked at his legs, not wanting Jason or his mom to see him doing such a thing <br />
 <br />
As Bob settled into Jason&#39;s room, he couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of comfort and security. The warm colours of Jason&#39;s home felt like they were rapping around him,  making him forget about the troubles of his past. His black eye throbbed, serving as a reminder of the altercation with Smiff, but being in this safe space allowed him to let go of the little bit of anger he still felt for him and focus on the now for now. <br />
 <br />
Bob and Jason spent the evening engrossed in video games, their laughter filling the room, allowing Bob to momentarily forget about how he is not really Luke. And feeling happy about the friendship he had found in Jason. <br />
 <br />
Later, as Bob lay in the darkness, his thoughts wandered. He pondered his connection with Jason and the growing feelings he had toward him. Being just an 11-year-old boy now, he understood that he could not act on them, but he couldn&#39;t help but imagine a future where their friendship might might something more. <br />
 <br />
The next morning, Bob woke up to the smell of Jason&#39;s mother preparing breakfast, and Bob and Jason raced to the table once they where both up, feeling a sense of belonging. The conversation came easily to Bob now, and laughter erupted every minute while they sat there eating. <br />
 <br />
Throughout the day, Bob and Jason took part in lots of activities, with them exploring the neighbourhood, riding their bikes what Jason&#39;s mom, gave Bob his very own bike! well it was Jasons hand me down, but still, Bob did not know what to say? he has never had his own bike in his life!  <br />
<br />
While riding around, they enjoyed messing around with each other, from getting in to some playfighting, to going and buying some junk food, Bob and Jason had a great time together.  <br />
<br />
When they got back Bob saw, a site what was not good, it was Lukes&#39;s mom, now his mom, looking very angry staring right at him, he cycled up to her, and said in a small voice “hi... mom” looking like the scared 11 year old boy he now is.</p>
