<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There were so many things that Antonio could do with this machine. So many choices, in fact, that it was giving him decision paralysis. Clearly, Antonio was not the person to make these decisions, or at the very least, not the person to use the Chronivac efficiently. Thankfully for him, Antonio knew exactly the person who could. Picking up the computer, the lucky thief ran to another room.<br />
<br />
Giovanni Romano was organizing and pricing things that his gang when he heard his subordinate suddenly barge in, screaming for him. &quot;Boss! Boss!&quot; Antonio cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, and it better be something amazing to scream...&quot; Gio started before realizing that he and Antonio were now standing eye-level with each other. Usually, he was a bit taller than his subordinate, but now that wasn&#39;t the case. Guess Tony really did find something to scream about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boss! Check this out.&quot; Antonio placed the Chonovic on the table Gio was working on and began typing something into it. Once he clicked enter, the table suddenly changed into a fancy desk, which caused Giovanni to jump back in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What the... Antonio, explain everything!&quot; Gio ordered, and as his underling explained what had happened, a gleeful smirk slowly crept upon his face. You see, before he became the brains of a little criminal ring, he was the co-founder of a certain start-up company. However, before the company got off the ground, he was betrayed by his colleagues. Gio was stripped of everything and was forced to live on the streets. While he had to steal and beg to survive, his former colleagues were living it up as his small start-up, which he put everything into, became a big name. The only thing that the former co-owner could do was watch in anger as other people benefited from his hard work and money. Well, now that he had this reality-warping computer, Giovanni knew exactly what he wanted to do with it. He wanted to take revenge on those bastards who took everything away from him!<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, Antonio, gather up the boys. I need to start making plans.&quot; Antonio nodded and did what he was told. Meanwhile, Giovanni sat down at his new desk to take a look at his latest tool for revenge. The first thing he did was pull up all his underlings&#39; profiles and noticed that they all had 100% loyalty towards him. Aww, those guys really knew how to warm a bitter and jaded man&#39;s heart.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I got everyone just like you asked.&quot; Just as he said, Antonio had brought three other men into the boss&#39;s room. The first was a shorter, lithe man named Ralph. He didn&#39;t have a last name as he grew up in a crappy orphanage until it shut down, leaving him on the street. His fast, nimble finger made him the perfect pickpocket for the team. Then there was Alejandro Garcia, a tall Hispanic member of Gio&#39;s team. He grew up in a poor family but was blessed with a handsome face, which made him a perfect distraction for the group. Finally, there was Burt Williams, the tallest and largest of the thieves. Though he was more fat than muscle, he was still intimidating enough to be the team&#39;s muscle. He ended up on the streets after his parents kick him out after he came out of the closet. If Gio had, to be honest, he never expected that all four of these men would become his closest companions. Yet, here he was, the leader of a bunch of loveable idiots.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, boss. I heard from Tony that we finally have a way to easy street! So, why are we still in a dump of a warehouse, like this?&quot; Ralph asked eagerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Patience Ralph, I had to make sure everything was perfect. Not to mention, I didn&#39;t want you guys to get lost, but now that everyone is here...&quot; Gio pressed a button, and suddenly, the building around them started to shift. They watched in awe as the walls wrapped around them, and they felt themselves rising up. Soon they found themselves in an office on the second story of a fancy-pants house. Gio would have turned the warehouse into a mansion, but he didn&#39;t want to draw too much attention just yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice, huh? Welcome to the new and improved headquarters,&quot; Giovanni began, &quot;Well, now that that&#39;s done, I guess it&#39;s time to let you in on my plans. As you know, my main goal is to take revenge on my old colleagues, and I&#39;m still drafting out my master plan. I can&#39;t assume this computer&#39;s power will be infinite so, I&#39;m being meticulous in my planning. However, I already know that I want you all to be by my side when that happens. I want you four to be my enforcers; however you don&#39;t quite have the look of one right now, don&#39;t you? Well, I&#39;ll take care of that for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
After Giovanni said that, he pressed another button which caused his underlings to feel strange. It was a sensation that Antonio recognized; it was the sensation of transforming. All four men gasped as their shirts all melted away, then they all threw their heads back and moaned as the transformation start. Gio knew that they needed to be strong if they wanted to be his enforcers, and strong he made them. He watched in delight as the guys&#39; arms inflated with pure muscle, pecs ballooning forward, legs nearly bursting out of their pants. Soon the transformation was over, and gone was the pack of thieves, and Giovanni&#39;s new enforcers were left in their place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, we&#39;re so buff now,&quot; Antonio said as he started touching his new body. Feeling the suppleness of his pecs and ridges of his abs. He always dreamt of having a body like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, check out how big my arms are!&quot; Ralph exclaimed as he flexed his now meaty biceps. Giovanni had also made the former short thief taller to be a better enforcer. It was strange for Ralph to be so big and muscular now, but he was loving the feeling of finally being a big guy, even if he was still the smallest of the four.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your arms? How about my abs?&quot; Alejandro chimed in, posing his new body. He looked like a fitness model now and loving how absolutely sexy he was feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, you all got abs?&quot; Burt asked, a bit jealous. &quot;Oh well, I can&#39;t complain when I have a bod like this.&quot; Burt was always intimidating, but now he had the strength to back it up. He may not have abs, but he lost a lot of fat in his transformation, and his stomach was impressively flat.<br />
<br />
Giovanni just smiled at his crew, enjoying their new bodies. He was just happy that they were happy. &quot;Alright, guys, that&#39;s it for today. Why don-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey boss, what about you?&quot; Alejandro interrupted. &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to muscle up too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, our boss should be strong too,&quot; Burt added. Soon all four of Giovanni&#39;s subordinates were egging him on into transforming too. All Gio could do was smile and shake his head. He really was the leader of a bunch of loveable idiots.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright. One strong boss coming up,&quot; Gio responded, which caused the new enforcers to cheer. The boss typed up new his new stats and then pressed the execute button. Then he stood up as the transformation started. Just like the other four, Gio&#39;s shirt melted off his body to show off his transformation. He then flexed an arm and watched his unimpressive bicep grow to the size of tennis balls, then baseballs, then to finally to softball. Hah, Gio couldn&#39;t wait for his formers colleges to see him with arms like these. Oh, muscling up with the Chonovic just felt so good now Giovanni understood why the guys wanted him to join in on this. It was a euphoric feeling to feel his flat pecs bulge outward with pride, his back and shoulders tightening and broadening. He couldn&#39;t help but rub his hands all over his stomach as abs started forming, and he nearly moaned as his growing legs almost burst out of his pants. All too soon, the transformation stopped, and Giovanni had become an adonis.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how do I look?&quot; the boss asked as he struck a pose. He was met with his enforcers complimenting and even wolf-whistling at his new physique.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright. That&#39;s all for today. Why don&#39;t you guys explore the new house, and we can talk business again tomorrow?&quot; After Gio said that, the other men took his suggestion and explored their new home. Well, except for Antonio, who decided to stay behind. &quot;Is there anything I can help you with, Tony?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Antonio began while slicking back his hair. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind me asking now that both of us are really hot. Do you want to take a break from your revenge and have some fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh. Well, Gio couldn&#39;t deny the fact that Antonio was now hotter than he ever been, and Giovanni himself was feeling pretty sexy...<br />
<br />
&quot;I like the way you think, Tony,&quot; the boss smirked as he leads Antonio to his new bedroom to have some fun.</p>
