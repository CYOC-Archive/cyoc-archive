<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning Will slowly awoke with a sticky sensation on his inner thighs and bottom. After a moment of disorientation he remembered what had occurred the previous night and he tore the covers off himself and sat bolt upright. Gazing down between his legs he saw the void where his manhood had once resided and a white sticky goo congealed on his thighs and the sheet beneath him. Then he noticed that there was also a trace of blood and he screamed. When Megan entered the room Will was trembling with fear and rage.<br />
 <br />
&quot;What did you DO to me last night?&quot; He asked frantically as Megan casually came into the room.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I thought that was rather obvious,&quot; she replied dryly as she glanced at Will's feminized groin and noticed the sticky residue on his thighs. Inwardly she grinned at his predicament, outwardly she gave a sense of slight confusion.<br />
 <br />
Will's face flushed furiously, something Megan had never seen before. He covered his crotch with both hands in a vain, almost maidenly attempt to preserve his modesty. &quot;I mean, HOW did this happen? Are you some kind of a witch or a sorceress?&quot; He asked fearfully.<br />
 <br />
Megan laughed. &quot;Not hardly!&quot; She smirked. &quot;If you notice, I'm in kind of the same predicament you are!&quot; <br />
 <br />
&quot;No, I didn't do this, but I did wish that you could find out what women have to go through at the hands of male chauvinists like you! I've had it with your condescending attitude and crude remarks! I guess some power in the universe decided to take my side on things and teach you a lesson.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;This just isn't fair, there's no way I can go to work with this thing.&quot; Will shouted in vein.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I plan on taking full advantage of this while I can. Besides, you haven't even begun to learn your lesson. Maybe once you do, we'll be changed back to normal.&quot; Megan said, once more making it seem like she hadn't the faintest idea what could've happened.<br />
 <br />
Will visibly sunk at hearing this, Megan didn't seem half as worried as he was. Maybe it was because she was gaining something and he'd lost that something. Either way he was having a hard time coming to grips with it. A hand glided down to his empty crotch, the fine soft tufts of hair made it feel all the more feminine.<br />
 <br />
Megan just smiled, walking over to her changed boyfriend, she kissed him on the lips. &quot;Better get cleaned up babe, you've got work in a half hour...unless you want to go in with...&quot; A hand played with the lips of his new mound. &quot;..all that cum over your thighs... Come on, now one will notice, unless you flash everyone at the office.&quot; He sighed slightly as they kissed. Megan's new member stirred to life at their embrace. &quot;Or if you'd prefer round two?&quot;<br />
 <br />
Will backed up slightly shaking his head. &quot;No, no way, I couldn't. If you need me, I'll be in the shower.&quot; He said huffing, he had no choice but to go to work in his current condition. Megan glared at him as he walked away, his butt had retained it's manly firmness. She spoke out loud as he moved out of earshot. &quot;This is going to be the best couple weeks of his life.&quot; She smirked and walked over to the dresser. &quot;Definitely have to pick out something cute for him to wear.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Walking into the bathroom, Will went straight to the toilet, relieving the pressure on his bladder, it felt so strange to have to pee like a girl. He finished none-the-less and wiped himself. Standing in front of the mirror, he inspected his body for any further changes and pleaded there were none. Say for the lack of his dick and balls, he looked pretty normal. He did notice an overall lack of definition on his body. Also his body hair seemed lighter, not gone, but it was definitely leaning toward peach fuzz. &quot;Great...man this is just too freaky!&quot;<br />
 <br />
Sighing dejectedly he hopped in the shower, making sure to clean up the remnants of last nights activities. As he ran his hands over his body, he could tell that it was softening, even if it was slight at this point. The chest hair he'd become so attached to had also retreated, leaving his chest and pretty much his upper body with little to no body hair. Not wanting to linger for long in the shower, he finished quickly and got out, drying himself quickly. He'd found out that his need to shave had disappeared as well.  It seemed like every time he looked in the mirror he noticed another change. His hair was now showing signs of change, going from his dark brown to a lighter color.<br />
 <br />
Strutting back to the main bedroom, Will found that Megan was no where to be found. A note was on the end table that read; &quot;Hey babe, went shopping, see you tonight.&quot; Will shook his head. &quot;How can she possibly think of shopping at a time like this. Walking to the dresser, he grabbed a pair of boxers, pulling them up. As he looked in the mirror, he could see there was a noticeable lack of bulge, sighing, he pulled his boxers back down, grabbed a pair of jockeys and pulled them on. Walking to his sock drawer, he grabbed a pair of rolled up socks and stuffed them into his jockeys, it at least gave him some bulge to work with.<br />
 <br />
Finishing up with a pair of slacks and a nice dress shirt, Will headed off to work in the hopes that things would return to normal, at least he'd hoped it would. At his office, Will was the boss, he had started his own Advertising company and it had turned out very successful. Most of the day went on uneventful, Will did feel less encouraged to talk with people, figuring it was best to avoid conversations in his current condition. Finally having some down time, Will relaxed in his office, his friend/employee, Jacob Selnir joined him. <br />
 <br />
Jacob stared at his friend momentarily before speaking. &quot;Looks like you had a rough night man. When did you decide to lighten your hair color?&quot; Will gulped slightly as he sipped his drink, he shook his head. &quot;I'm fine, just a lot of drinking. Must be from all this California sun, my hair just soaks it up.&quot; Jacob was like Will, a very attractive man who never had problems with the ladies, to his advantage he was a genuinely nice guy too. Will spoke up after a few moments. &quot;I might be taking a few days off here soon, I'll need you to cover my ass here.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Nodding, Jacob leaned back, taking a swig of his drink. &quot;No problem man, just set it up with...oh yeah damn, I really need a new secretary man. Gina quitting hasn't come at the best time. Anyway, just let me know when and the itinerary and we're all set.&quot; He smirked leaning closer. &quot;It's about time you took the lady on a proper vacation. Show her a good time. Maybe hit the gym, those clothes are looking a bit baggy buddy, told ya you'd slack off without all that girl chasing.&quot; He said with a chuckle, Will forced a laugh and just nodded.<br />
 <br />
Unbeknown to Will, his changes had continued throughout the day, his muscles had started to soften and reshape, becoming less bulky and slightly more feminine in the process, yet decidedly male still. His shoulders had pinched in a tad, becoming more narrow. His sport coat hung loosely on his frame. Will waved to Jacob as he exited the office. Will continued on with his work, he'd want to spend as little time at work as possible so he had to finish his newest account before leaving. It was a women's swimsuit company, the specialized in those oh so sexy suits you saw women only model in.<br />
 <br />
Across town, Megan had finished her shopping, she'd picked out some new clothes for both herself and Will's ever changing bodies. She giggled at the thought of how fun the next couple weeks were going to be for them. &quot;I'll let him in on it...but I'll have my fun first.&quot; As she walked the motion of her new member swinging freely between her legs gave her an odd sense of pride. &quot;I can't wait till I see the finished product.&quot; <br />
 <br />
Passing a store window, she gazed at her reflection, she'd notice some changes. The blouse she wore was sleeveless and showed off her arms, which had definitely become more well toned. Looking around briefly, she saw no one, flexing her new more muscular arms, they looked smaller than Will's, but it was definitely an increase. Her shoulders seemed to have become several inches wider as well, while her hips had done the reverse and become a little less wide. The blouse showed her belly off, it had begun to define into a beginners four pack. She felt like she could bench a truck, smirking she walked toward her car. &quot;I wonder how Will's looking.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Walking into his mansion after a long day of work, Will through his briefcase and jacket on the table. He felt exhausted and just wanted to relax. Megan walked out of the living room and toward Will, she was wearing a sports bra and a pair of capri sweat pants that did nothing to hide her impressive bulge. She looked as though she'd just finished working out. She slinked over to him, kissing him with an assertiveness that she had never shown, forcing her tongue to part his lips. Will could feel his body tingle as they wrapped their arms around each other. Will felt a disconcerting poke against his abdomen. He suddenly broke the kiss, afraid what it might lead to.<br />
 <br />
Megan smirked, playing with his hair in her fingers. &quot;You should strip babe, I want to see what else's changed on you.&quot; Will shook his head. &quot;No way, last thing I need is a repeat of last night.&quot; Megan pouted. &quot;I promise nothing will happen unless you want it to. See, I'll show you want's changed on me.&quot; She stripped off what little clothes she had on. Her precious member bobbing up and down, mesmerizing Will momentarily by it's girth. He could see her arms and legs were much more muscular than even this morning. While her hips seemed to be narrowing, while her breasts looked a little smaller now.<br />
 <br />
Sighing, Will begrudgingly took his loose clothing off, standing naked before his girlfriend, she began to examine him for changes. His upper body had become much smaller, in fact it looked like it more belonged to that of a fifteen year old boy than a 20ish something man. His belly had softened and was more feminine along with his skin which was more milky now. His hips looked as though they'd begun to flare out. She leaned forward, pinching his now puffy nipples, he jumped in surprise. &quot;Sorry, couldn't resist 'em.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Looking toward his lower half, Megan could see that his feet were only a little smaller at best, still male in her eyes. She wondered how long the little things like that would last for him. What really caught Megan's attention was that Will's thighs and calves had rounded out and become much more feminine than the sum of his body. They had but a small coating of fine hair on them, as well as a tuft of blond pubic hair between his crotch. &quot;Oh my gosh, we need to get rid of all that hair, then you'll have some really great legs. They're not all girlie yet, but way more than before.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Will's face flushed a bright red as he checked out his own legs. &quot;Well, whatever happens to me, the reverse happens to you, your legs are huge.&quot; He said pointing to her thicker well defined calves. Hair also looked like it was beginning to grown, even her skin was more rough now. Megan simply smirked, walking around him to get a good look at his buttocks. She noticed that what little hair he did have there before was now gone, but it still retained it's manly firmness, for now. She chuckled, squeezing it. &quot;Okay, now lets go have some fun.&quot; Grabbing his arm forcefully she pulled him op the stairs and into the master bathroom.<br />
 <br />
Will tried his best to stop her from pulling but decided to just give in for now. &quot;Come on Megan, don't do anything weird, I just can't handle it right now.&quot; Megan just looked at him. &quot;Babe, this is only temporary, so we might as well enjoy it, right? For me, please?' As Will nodded, Megan pushed him into the tub, forcing him to a sitting position, she turned around. &quot;Stay put and close your eyes and put your hands behind your head.&quot; Will with little choice, did as he was told, hearing Megan walk off for a few minutes. A cold chill ran through him as he sat in the cool tub naked and waiting.<br />
<br />
The sound of Megan's bare feet could be heard on the tile as she strutted over to Will, the sound of a bottle being opened could be heard. &quot;This will only take a few minutes, keep those eyes shut.&quot; She spread the contents over his nude body, taking great care with his crotch. She spread it all over his arms and pits. She thought about doing the face, but it had already lost all his manly facial hair. Finally finished, she waited five minutes and turned the hot water on, rinsing away all of the lotion and hair along with it. &quot;Ok, stand up and we'll dry you off real quick.&quot; Will nodded, getting to his feet, she patted him dry with the towel, she stood back, smirking. &quot;Much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that, Will's eyes popped open, looking immediately down, every bit of body hair he had left was now gone. His hands shot to his legs, they looked very feminine without the hair and definitely much softer. &quot;What the hell? I thought that was some kind of ex-foliating crap, not hair removal cream!&quot; His legs looked cute, like a girls, not quite sexy yet like Megan's had been, but he knew that would change in the not too distant future.<br />
<br />
Megan stepped closer to Will, her hands tracing from his stomach to his bare, now smooth, crotch. &quot;You always did want me to shave it all off like this.&quot; She looked down at it, then shot him an approving look. &quot;Well, you're right, it is definitely sexy.&quot; Her fingers slowly began to play with Will's bare lips, she could tell he enjoyed the way it looked even if it was on him. He broke her touch, turning to face the mirror. At this he could see that Megan had gained a couple inches, meaning Will had lost a couple inches, making the difference all the more evident.<br />
<br />
Will, feeling frustrated, stormed off, he was humiliated at every turn now, his girlfriend was already becoming more of a man than he was at this point. He'd have one or two more days to go to work and he'd forced to take his leave. As he walked out to the bedroom he noticed that on the bed, Megan had lay-ed out some new clothes for him. There was a pair of boxer, shrugging, he decided to wear them, as he pulled them up, they fell flat against the crotch, they also appeared to be a short cut, showing off his new more appealing legs. He was too frustrated to notice as he pulled on a small t-shirt. He dove into bed, wanting to end the day right then and there, quickly drifting off to sleep. He could only imagine what the next day would bring.</p>
