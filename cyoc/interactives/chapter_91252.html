<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danny looked through the Chronivac settings, astonished at the different options apparently at his fingertips. His eyes, however, kept sliding around the Age option - he was vaguely aware that something was there, but couldn&#39;t quite focus on in it. Maybe after a hot shower... No, he thought, he couldn&#39;t possibly leave until he had tried out at least some of these settings.<br />
<br />
His eyes strayed down to his pudge, which at almost 31 was prominent. He wished he took after Uncle Mark in that area rather than Uncle Jay. The Weight setting on the Chronivac said 220lbs - not far off Jay&#39;s 240lbs. His fingers wavered a moment over the keys before he entered 180lbs and pressed enter. The world seemed to waver around him, and his body visibly compacted before his eyes. The bulge at his waist contracted most dramatically, until he could barely see it. Raising his shirt, he saw that it was still present - but the gym muscle was definitely winning the war now. What if... he put the cursor back in the box and dropped his weight to 160lbs. This time the change was much more generalised - arms, legs, even hips narrowing markedly. He was still a muscular guy, but overall, the impression was of well-balanced, lithe fitness. The belly had still not completely disappeared - a small pooch of fat below the belly button still evident - but was probably the least you could expect from someone sharing the burly genes of Simon and Bryan.<br />
<br />
He lifted his hand to his face, noting the reduced but still healthy bicep bulge. He felt great - better than he had for... years? Something was definitely up with his memories; he still couldn&#39;t shake the inexplicable feeling he had earlier that Uncle Jay, not Simon, was supposed to be his father. His brain was already making creative rationalisations - Jay was younger, more active, had shared more moments with him as a boy, and the family was close-knit (but then why could he not remember what had happened to his mother?) so it made sense to think of Jay as a more immediate father figure. Except it had always been Uncle Mark he had looked up to...<br />
<br />
31-year-old Danny turned his attention back to the screen. One thing that had always bugged him growing up was how he had always looked older than his age; never able to get with girls he could relate to, and feeling exclude from his own age group. At least he had never been carded buying beer, but sometimes being the guy everyone assumed was the most responsible, adult member of the group really sucked. The family genes were to blame - hairy, with strong, mature-looking features. At least he hadn&#39;t inherited his uncles&#39; early hair loss, he thought, touching his strong, thick hairline - wait, no, he had fixed that with the Chronivac. He could change other things, too.<br />
<br />
He browsed to the Testosterone settings. 7.5 out of 10. That, he guessed, was probably the root of the problem. How low to go? He didn&#39;t want to turn himself into some kind of wimp, but it would be nice to feel less like a caveman. He typed 6.0, then changed his mind and lowered it again to 5.5.<br />
<br />
Again the world swam, and again his body contracted slightly - this time muscle slimming down and becoming leaner. He was still 180lbs, but more of it was in his long, powerful legs, and he remembered doing much better on the running machine. His chin felt much smoother - despite not shaving today, there was only a whisker of stubble to be felt. The dark brown hair on his arms and legs largely disappeared, what was left becoming lighter and blonder; raising his shirt again he saw he had only a thin smattering over his chest and a much-reduced treasure trail. Below that, he noted with some disappointment that his hefty bulge had also diminished. Shimming his jogging bottoms down, he beheld a somewhat reduced member. His family were prodigiously endowed in this area and now he understood why; the reduced testosterone had taken him from a very substantial 7.5&#39;&#39; to a respectable, thick 6&#39;&#39;, but still disappointing. He browsed through the settings until he found what he wanted - Penis Size. Clicking the sub-menu expansion there were a raft of options for erect and flaccid size, head size and shape, shaft curvature; for now, he liked his current equipment but would like more of it. He upped his erect size to 9 inches, clicking yes when it asked to change flaccid size to match, and watched as reality shifted and his penis changed from average to borderline porn sized. He wondered if he was even bigger than Bryan now, who had apparently sported a huge one in his youth. He wanted to see just how much bigger it was flaccid, but he was too excited; it remained rock-hard.<br />
<br />
He browsed through the options again, finding one he had overlooked; it was close to the option he just couldn&#39;t focus on, but just perceptible; apparent age. Bringing it up, he found that physically he was the equivalent of a 35-year-old - probably younger-looking than he had been before restoring his hairline and dropping the testosterone, but still, he couldn&#39;t leave himself looking older than his age. He dragged it down, daring himself at every step to go lower, until he was at 25. He gave a final little jerk of his hand left, and allowed it to rest at 23 before pressing enter.<br />
<br />
His body shifted again, balancing a narrower, more youthful waist by enlarging the pecs and shoulders; he could feel something happening to his face. He felt a zinging sensation - a vitality. His cock, if anything, responded to the pseudo-regression by perking up even further, pushing hard against his abdomen and the tiny residue of his belly.<br />
<br />
Someone opened the door and Danny quickly closed down the Chronovac and flipped his shirt over his boner, though at its expanded size it visibly distended the fabric. He swivelled backwards slightly and saw Mark standing in the doorway, with his shaven head still glistening from the gym.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle Mark! Sorry, I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be back...&quot; he trailed off, guiltily.<br />
<br />
Mark, however, had clearly drawn his own conclusions as to why Danny was sitting in front of a blank Windows desktop with his cock out, and grinned. &quot;Just make sure you clear the browser cache once you&#39;re done, kid. Now come on, Dad&#39;s going to want some help in the shop so we can close up early; he&#39;s got a fine roast for dinner.&quot; Something still seemed to be troubling him though, and he opened his mouth as though to ask something, then shook his head and left.<br />
<br />
Danny realised that he was blushing profusely. He didn&#39;t feel like an adult anymore; he felt like a college kid who had been caught jerking off by his father.<br />
<br />
At dinner, Danny looked around the table - Bryan, white-haired and bespectacled; his dad, Simon, greying and bald up top, much lighter around the midriff than grandpa but still hefty enough you knew it was genetic, and the twins, for all that they looked every different now - Jay, heavier than Simon with a short goatee and a ruff of greying hair around the sides, Mark, very fit for his age with an aggressively shaven head and big bushy beard. And now Danny - he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror - slim, athletic but no longer extremely muscular with the exception of his plump pecs and strong legs, a young, clean-shaven, pouty face that could pass for a decade younger than his age, big blue eyes and long brown hair down to his shoulders; almost a twink compared to his uniformly husky, balding relatives. At 32 he was definitely the baby of the family.</p>
