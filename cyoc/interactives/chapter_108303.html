<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Totally unaware of the drama next door with the Twists over Frances&#39; parents, William came home to find what at first he thought was an empty house. While still in his human form at the moment, his werefox senses said his family was all upstairs, but that his youngest son and Spencer Lawson had fun in the basement again.<br />
<i>The way those two keep going at it, maybe I should start charging them rent,</i> he joked to himself, while attempting to raid the fridge. The fact that there was barely anything in it worth having for a late dinner was just testimony to the fact that weres had hardy appetites, especially after sex.<br />
After finding the package of baloney he intentionally hid in the back of the vegetable crisper, William had a couple of sandwiches, then grabbed a bottle of water before he headed upstairs for the evening.<br />
Seeing light coming from underneath both boys closed bedroom doors, William went to the master bedroom he shared with his wife Martha, but was surprised that the light was off in there.<br />
Not that most weres actually needed light to see by at night, which did save them quite a lot on the electric bills, but still...<br />
Walking into the room, William saw his wife in her werevixen fursona sound asleep and sprawled out across their bed. She hadn&#39;t even bothered to turn down the blankets before crawling in.<br />
Quickly getting undressed, William eagerly released his inner werefox, relishing the feeling of fur traveling across his body as his human features assumed their vulpine appearance, including his tail sprouting. The appendage started wagging eagerly at the sight of his mate before him, as well as the hardening werefox cock poking out of its sheath, but William had other ideas as to how to express his feelings towards Martha at that moment.<br />
<br />
Martha Anderson stirred as she felt something join her in bed.<br />
It was warm, furry, and wrapped its arms around her waist while giving her a quick kiss on her muzzle.<br />
&quot;Hello my love,&quot; William growled, holding her closer to him.<br />
&quot;Hello Darling,&quot; she said with a smile, before returning the kiss. &quot;Feel like a little fun?&quot;<br />
&quot;Only a little?&quot; he chuckled in return.<br />
&quot;You know what I mean,&quot; replied Martha, as one paw reached out to stroke his furry chest and the other reached down between his legs.<br />
&quot;Actually, I&#39;m exactly where I want to be at the moment, doing exactly what I want to do.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh? And what is that?&quot; she wondered.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m with the woman I love more than life itself, holding her close and expressing my eternal gratitude that she is in my life and loves me as much as I love her.&quot;<br />
&quot;You know, flattery will get you everywhere,&quot; she purred, as Martha started nuzzling up against him.<br />
&quot;Perhaps, but for now, what I really want is a good long cuddle my love,&quot; said William, settling so that the two of them were lying against each other to enjoy the moment to its fullest.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
In his werewolf form, Nate Anderson had finished all his homework for the day, in part thanks to having detention this week as punishment for playing hooky from school last Friday.<br />
Now alone in his room, he turns on his computer and starts catching up on social media, but as any other 16 year old teenager, soon finds himself anxious for some female company.<br />
Knowing that isn&#39;t going to happen tonight, Nate switches over to a couple of were-porn websites he knows of, but is surprised to find himself bouncing back and forth between the sexy female wereleopards and the equally sexy werelionesses.<br />
Not caring whether or not this is an indication that he is possibly torn between wereleopard Liv Robinson and weretigress Jean Talbot, all Nate is worried about is not making a mess as he starts to take matters into his own paws so he can hopefully get some sleep once his efforts reach their inevitable conclusion.<br />
<br />
ACROSS THE HALL...<br />
&quot;Hello Lover,&quot; purred Spencer Lawson, staring at Eric Anderson as their nightly Skype chat started. The webcam displayed the fact that the woman he loved was still in her hybrid were-fursona (wolf/cat/panthress) and as sexy now as when he last saw her earlier that evening, did little to curb Eric&#39;s enthusiasm or the hot rod growing larger between his furry werepanther legs.<br />
&quot;Hello yourself my sexy feline,&quot; he purred in return, raising a paw as if to caress her. &quot;Ready for tomorrow night?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ready for you right now,&quot; she teased, while caressing her breasts. &quot;To say I missed you is a serious understatement.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s only been a couple of hours,&quot; Eric pointed out, &quot;but I miss you too. Any word from Frieda?&quot;<br />
&quot;Word? No. But I sense she&#39;s all right and passed that test with flying colors.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too. It should make her folks happy to know what we already did, that she&#39;s not bi-polar like her father.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. Would you be jealous if I say I miss her as much as I miss you right now?&quot; asked Spencer.<br />
&quot;Only if you&#39;re not mad that I feel the same way about both of my ladies,&quot; replied Eric, as a smile crossed his werepanther muzzle.<br />
&quot;Did you really mean what you said down in your basement about fighting anyone who tried to make a play for either me and/or Frieda at the werepanther gathering tomorrow night?&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; Eric asked in return, baring his fangs as his eyes briefly flashed a brighter shade of green.<br />
&quot;That our bond is strong, we both love you, but we also don&#39;t want to see you get in any trouble either,&quot; replied Spencer.<br />
&quot;I know honey,&quot; said Eric, while calming down, &quot;it&#39;s just the thought of someone other than the three of us being within our intimate circle...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. I can&#39;t picture myself with anyone other than you and Frieda either,&quot; said Spencer, while blowing him a kiss. &quot;So what do we do?&quot;<br />
&quot;Play it by ear, and talk to Frieda in person about how we feel before school starts in the morning. What else is there?&quot; wondered Eric.<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; began Spencer, as she began to slowly roll back in her desk chair until Eric&#39;s monitor showed all of her luscious were body, even as Spencer began caressing both her breasts and her moist sex at the same time.<br />
&quot;I like the way you think,&quot; Eric growled happily, moving back his chair until Spencer saw a full shot of her handsome werepanther playing with himself.</p>
