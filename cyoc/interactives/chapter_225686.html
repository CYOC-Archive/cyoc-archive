<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty had been experimenting with his powers for the last three years. He&#39;d been making himself just a bit stronger and better at sports as he went through his sophomore, junior and senior year. Of course, by the time he was a senior, everyone&#39;s views about him had changed. No longer was he the small, shy quiet boy in the corner. Now he was the tall athletic jock that nearly everyone wanted to be around. He&#39;d nearly singlehandedly taken the football team to state and went to win it in wrestling. His large athletic frame could do whatever sport he wanted to.<br />
<br />
Of course he had his fun back then, making sure to mess around with people, but it&#39;d also given him the opportunity to go to any college that he wanted to. Now that he was 19, he wanted one that was pretty far away from his foster family so they couldn&#39;t easily surprise him with a drop in. It also meant that he would stay on campus. <br />
<br />
The only problem was how small the dorm felt. Though, being 6&#39;4&quot; and a lean 260 pounds of muscle most places felt small to him. He wished for the bed to be larger and watched as the frame and the mattress grew to something more fitting his size. Then laid down on it, looking at the ceiling. His door opened and his roommate walked in, dragging his rolling suitcase.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sup?&quot; Ty smirked as he watched the small guy struggle to move the large luggage.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-s-s-sup!&quot; his roommate dropped the suitcase without even thinking. His eyes traced every part of Ty that it could possibly see. &quot;I&#39;m not gay!&quot; he declared as red started to cover his face. The slight tent in his shorts would tell a different story if Ty hadn&#39;t known what he had done. A simple wish a few years back where every single person who saw him would find him undeniably attractive. It was mostly to keep the guys off his back whenever their girlfriends would try to flirt with him. They couldn&#39;t get mad because they felt the same way. Some being so bold to go behind their girlfriend&#39;s backs as well.<br />
<br />
Ty suppressed a chuckle. &quot;Never said you were...&quot; He stood up, looming over his 5&#39;7&quot; roommate and outstretched his hand. &quot;I&#39;m Ty.&quot;<br />
<br />
The roommate&#39;s hand was already shaking before it gripped Ty&#39;s. He let out the slightest of moans as he watched Ty&#39;s mitt completely dwarf his hand but squeeze with the perfect amount of pressure. Not too hard, but firm enough to show his strength. &quot;A-A-Alex,&quot; Alex stammered out as he shook. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice ta meetcha,&quot; Ty smiled as he sat back down on his bed. It took Alex a moment to realize that he wasn&#39;t holding Ty&#39;s hand anymore and went to unpacking his stuff. Of course, Ty had wished all his own stuff to unpack itself. &quot;So, if you could wish for anything right now, what would it be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An icebreaker?&quot; Alex forced himself to not look at Ty. His eyes kept wandering back over to the giant sitting on the bed across from him.<br />
<br />
Ty smiled. He could already feel what it was. &quot;Yeah man. Why not? We&#39;re going to be roommates all year. Might as well get to know each other a bit. Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess...&quot; Alex hesitated. He glanced over at Ty for a second then back at his luggage. &quot;Are you going to make fun of me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah man,&quot; Ty said with a charming confidence. &quot;I&#39;ve wished for plenty of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s anxiety seemed to vanish. Of course that had been a wish he&#39;d made a long time ago that people would trust him a lot more. &quot;I guess I&#39;d wish to be bigger and stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty smirked as he made a silent wish. &#39;I wish Alex is 6&#39;1&quot; and 210 pounds of mostly muscle.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Alex grunted as he felt something change about his body. It was so crazy. All of a sudden all of his muscles seemed to have seized up and then relaxed again. He pulled at the collar of his shirt. &#39;Why was it so tight all of a sudden?&#39; &quot;What the--!?&quot; Alex jumped as he saw his shirt pulling against a chest he hadn&#39;t had. Even crazier how it was getting tighter. All over his chest and arms he could feel it gripping and grinding against his growing muscles.<br />
<br />
The sleeves tightened around his growing biceps but with his new height, they were riding up to his shoulders. Two meaty pecs had made their way onto his chest and were continuing to grow. One quick movement and a loud, &#39;SHRIP!&#39; filled the room as the back of the shirt ripped open to release some of the stress. It was already riding up over his abs showing off his belly button.<br />
<br />
Of course his bottom half wasn&#39;t fairing much better as the khaki shorts that had dripped slightly below his knees now rose slightly above them. It didn&#39;t help that thick quads filled what had been a fairly spacious area. Nor did it help that his hips were widening ever so slightly. Just the change in height had been enough to add a few inches of diameter to his pelvis making his 27 inch waist closer to 32 inches. Even though there was barely any fat covering his body, the amount of muscle more than made up for it as his butt ballooned out from behind him sending another loud rip through the room.<br />
<br />
The shorts dropped around his feet and Alex couldn&#39;t help but notice that his toes were now sticking out of the front of his shoes. No longer were he a size 8 1/2, they had to be at least a size 11. He wiggled his toes verifying that they were still his feet. &quot;W-what happened to me?!&quot; Alex gasped. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like something granted your wish,&quot; Ty smirked. <br />
<br />
Alex was still having trouble figuring out who he was. Ty had made a full length mirror along the wall for himself that Alex was currently using. The passive guy was nervously flexing and watching the different muscle pop or bulge as he moved his near bodybuilder body. The slightest of flexes and the muscle would tense up showing an unknown strength or power that he now possessed. However, looking down at his suitcase, he picked up one of his shirts. Placing against his massive chest made it obvious that it wouldn&#39;t fit. The medium that had almost been too large for him was now not even long enough to cover his torso.<br />
<br />
&quot;I--I don&#39;t understand...&quot; Alex stared blankly at the massive jock he was. Nothing in his suitcase came close to fitting him anymore. Maybe a night shirt, but even that would have been tight over his muscular frame.<br />
<br />
Ty tossed him a sleeveless shirt, a pair of shorts and some flipflops. &quot;You can wear some of mine. It&#39;ll be a little big, but no one will notice.&quot; He pat Alex&#39;s wide shoulders before declaring. &quot;Alright. I&#39;m going to have some fun. See you around.&quot;</p>
