<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Her Mom and Fred were both there and she was grounded. She had no chance of escape and couldn&#39;t have any friends over.<br />
<br />
With literally nothing to do but wait, Jen spent the next few hours watching TV and chatting with Michele and Ali. She ate supper with her family, and eventually went back to her room.<br />
<br />
She took a quick shower, then dried off. Before pulling on her night gown, she examined herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
From her pussy came a firm A cup breast. She wouldn&#39;t need to wear the boy’s undies to contain it but most of her panties would be too tight.<br />
<br />
Luckily, she did have a few that would stretch over the mound. It didn&#39;t matter too much anyway, since nobody cared whether or not it was showing, so long as she kept her pussy hidden. She imagined cutting a hole in an old pair of panties to let the breast hang through. So long as some fabric stayed just under, she wouldn&#39;t need to worry about her vagina being exposed.<br />
<br />
She looked up at her chest. Her breasts were almost back to the way they had been, though she realized that she wouldn&#39;t mind keeping C cups. They were shapely and firm, still very attractive. She had been living with four breasts for nearly a week was no longer bothered by them. She was thin and fit, still sexy by any standard. If anything her extra assets would make her even more desirable, she thought, as she gave the bottom row a squeeze with both hands.<br />
<br />
“Kyle did say they this was permanent,” she recalled.<br />
<br />
She smiled, and pulled over her night gown. Fortunately, she had no more negative changes that day and was optimistic about getting one more positive change since Suzy would be there soon.<br />
Once in bed, she reflected on the events up until that night.<br />
<br />
On Tuesday Kyle cursed her with the breast in her pussy. His dare hurt Ali’s feelings, then later she fought with Mom. After that, she skipped school to deal with the transformations.<br />
She remembered how good it felt the first time she masturbated with her modified crotch.<br />
<br />
That same day, she tried to find a loophole, not putting much thought into the conditions that Kyle had set up. By accident, she realized that she could use the mirror. It backfired, leaving her with a new set of breasts. On the up side, the transformations up until then had been reset.<br />
<br />
School closed early that day, which saved her from explaining why she hadn&#39;t gone. Unfortunately, she accidentally cursed her with four breasts when trying to undo her own curse. That night, Jen learned that even others couldn&#39;t undo her curse.<br />
<br />
On Wednesday her mom gave her some more supportive underwear and she went back to school. That sucked.<br />
<br />
Sure, she was lucky that neither cheer squad nor swim practice fell on that day, but it wasn&#39;t even first period when that stupid boy forced another change. She spent the rest of that day uncomfortable and aroused until she made it home. By then she was so horny that she wasted the entire evening masturbating.<br />
<br />
Thursday started off pretty well...She remembered how her sister went to school with her bottom row hanging out. At the time she was embarrassed for her, but now knew better.<br />
<br />
She had actually managed to reverse all of the changes by talking to Martha then later by talking with Brian on the bus. Well, almost all. She couldn&#39;t undo the clit nipple and extra row of breasts.<br />
<br />
Things quickly went down hill when some boys made fun of her at lunch. She ended up with three times the usual growth and arousal, then fucked Brian in the handicap bathroom. It felt great, but she felt bad for involving him.<br />
<br />
“At least I didn&#39;t use the curse on him...” She thought.<br />
<br />
That day, she faked being sick and left school early. She ended up home alone and managed to make one more positive change by visiting her neighbor, Mrs. Jackson. Not much else happened, except that she continued to play sick to avoid suspicion.<br />
<br />
On Friday, she managed to improve her condition by speaking with Fred early in the morning. That afternoon was uneventful. She tested out some cloths and ended up masturbating again. She spent that evening testing the limits of her condition by exposing her lower breasts. For the most part, everything went fine. She did manage to fuck up by arguing with Fred later that the evening. At the end of day, she was right back where she had started.<br />
<br />
Jen, and her sister could share their second row of breasts with the world without anyone noticing. What was really strange was that people did know about them... They were just oblivious to the fact that they weren&#39;t always covered up.<br />
<br />
“No matter how different you look, everyone will think the changes are normal with the exception of your best friend, you and I.”<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until that morning that Kyle’s words really sank in. <br />
<br />
Unlike her sister, Jen also had a breast in her pussy. Like the extra breasts above, people were oblivious to it. That morning, she tested the theory with a very short skirt. She ended up taking it a little to far when she lifted the breast and flashed her mom, but by the end of the test she knew that as long as her vaginal opening stayed covered, her breast was free to hang.<br />
<br />
Later that day, she got lucky with Michele, and had one more positive transformation. Feeling optimistic and a bit closer to normal, she decided to celebrate with an afternoon masturbation session.<br />
<br />
During this personal time she started lactating from her four upper breasts. Turns out, all the extra stimulation was gradually changing her body chemistry.<br />
<br />
Determined to stay positive, she thought, “Two days left...And Suzy will be here tomorrow to help me change back to normal.”<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t help but smile at the thought and after a short while, she fell asleep...</p>
