<br />
A single lengthy stroke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then stop trying to -ah- do the same to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
A reciprocal stroke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-you stop first! Mmph~&quot;<br />
<br />
The two pure black latex vixens teased each other with lengthy strokes on each other&#39;s pricks, their pawed hands covered in the translucent black latex lubricating precum leaking from the tips of each other&#39;s erect 10-inchers: The two were playing a more sexually explicit & warped version of tag, wherein the winner was the one that managed to make the others climax first before they did.<br />
<br />
If anyone saw the two foxes from afar, they wouldn&#39;t be able to tell any differences between the two: Appearance-wise, they looked nearly identical, with the only difference being the nicknames that were inscribed on their collars&#39; heart-shaped pendants. They were both 5&#39; 9&quot;, both pure black all over with white-tipped tails, both with bouncing spherical D-cups for jugs, & both equally well-endowed. Their thongs were barely hanging on, the slightest touch would be enough to snap them apart.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll stop when you lose!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you&#39;ll have to catch me first!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The shiny black vixen in front made a sharp left turn into the middle of two buildings, sprinting down the path as fast as he could: Despite his current endowments, he was able to cover the distance faster than he could before the transformation, reaching the other side of the 20-meter straight path within 2 seconds. However, he had failed to properly slow down beforehand, causing him to run into the dual swing doors of the barrack&#39;s communal shower building, passing straight through them.<br />
<br />
Despite not needing to breathe anymore, Sam still panted as he entered the door to his left, his deep breaths occasionally eliciting tiny squeaks as he tried to calm down. As the power came on, the fluorescent lights above him flickered on, illuminating the corridor that he was in. <br />
<br />
Looking around the room, the latex vulpine saw rows of lockers lining the walls, with the area apparently being the female wing of the communal shower building. Aside from the two sets of swing doors on either side of the room, each leading back out to the hallway, there were also three corridors that led to the showers & toilets installed into the building: The showers flanked the side corridors, while the toilets took up the middle corridor.<br />
<br />
<i>(Okay, I need something here that will help me win…one of these lockers must have something in them.)</i><br />
<br />
Focusing on winning their game of &#39;tag&#39;, Sam went through as many lockers as he could before his brother could find him. <i>He needed something to help him win at any cost.</i><br />
<br />
Aside from some strewn clothes too small for the latex fox, the entire locker room was picked bare: The only thing that he could find was a tube of &quot;PermaGloss&quot; within one of the locked lockers. The combination to the locker was easy to guess with enough tension on the lock&#39;s shackle.<br />
<br />
The packaging for the lip gloss was nonexistent save for the white label that wrapped around the tube. Next to the tube was a handwritten letter:<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
<br />
It was hard enough trying to sneak this through the compound: Consider the favor repaid.<br />
<br />
If you feel any tingles on your lips, then that means that it&#39;s working its stuff: You&#39;ll get those full lips that you want so much. Kiss anybody on their skin, and they&#39;ll come around to what you want. Max effect if you kiss them on the lips.<br />
<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
There was seemingly more to the letter, but that part of it was heavily written over & crossed out.<br />
<br />
The pitch-black vixen stared at the letter in his pawed hands for a few moments, the gears turning in his latex mind before he flashed a momentary smile. <i>This was exactly what he needed.</i><br />
<br />
The joy wouldn&#39;t last though, as he heard the same swing doors that he came in from open, along with the subtle squeaks of rubbery latex skin rubbing against each other: Such minute sounds couldn&#39;t have been heard before when he was a human, and now they were clearly audible to him. <br />
<br />
Rick was closing in on him, and there was little time left. <br />
<br />
In an attempt to buy more time, Sam bolted into one of the shower stalls, but he didn&#39;t close the door: <i>He only needed a few more seconds anyhow, he just needed to put the lip gloss on.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Sam? Are you there? I know because I can smell you for some reason…&quot; There was a twinge of worry in Rick&#39;s newly-feminine voice. <i>But the game&#39;s still on, and it won&#39;t be done until either one gives up their seed.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Look, this doesn&#39;t feel right: Was my chest always this big & round?&quot; A minute squeak came from Rick, probably fondling his spherical D-cups. &quot;Mmph… And were they always this sensitive? Why does this all feel so good, yet so wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
In the back of Sam&#39;s mind, Rick&#39;s voiced concerns were quickly taking hold: Why did their body not feel right, and were his massive jugs there the whole time?<br />
<br />
Still, it was not enough to override Sam&#39;s existing momentary desire of winning their game of &#39;tag&#39;. Uncapping the stick of lip gloss, Sam hurriedly applied the lip gloss onto his lips, giving every bit of them ample amounts of lip gloss before proceeding to purse & pucker them, evening out its application on his lips. The effects were near-instantaneous, as Sam felt the tingling sensation described in the letter, as they became fuller and luscious. <br />
<br />
What Sam didn&#39;t notice was the fog on his brain descending further, quashing the concerns that Rick had brought up just a few moments ago. <b>Shi</b> felt hir lips becoming ever more sensitive as the moments passed: The pleasure just from licking them was enough to cause hir to leak black latex milk from hir breasts & a translucent black latex fluid from hir snatch. Hir lengthy latex prick was throbbing at full mast, the translucent black latex precum leaking from the tip of it amply coating its entire length. The sack that held hir balls felt full to burst, as shi felt the need to climax inching closer & closer every second.<br />
<br />
The pleasure was quickly becoming unbearable, and shi wanted to jump on hir fellow latex vixen now. <i>Sharing this pleasure was becoming increasingly paramount to hir.</i></p>
