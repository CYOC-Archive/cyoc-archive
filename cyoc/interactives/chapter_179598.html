<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jody just finished reapplying her red lipstick when she hears the message tone from her smartphone. She grabs the phone from inside her handbag and her heart skips a beat when she sees who the text was from. &quot;OMG Mikael!&quot; She can&#39;t help but squeal and smile excitedly at the sight of Mikael&#39;s text, which only consisted of a bunch of &quot;Wow&quot; emojis and hearts. Moments after a new message arrives, &quot;Jody I was wandering, would you like to meet up with me at the coffee shop this evening, around seven maybe?&quot; Jody couldn&#39;t believe her eyes. A date with Mikael? This was too good to be true for her. She texted him quite regularly(usually she&#39;d send him pics of herself hoping to attract him), and he did reply back, but always in a sort of half-assed kind of way and this certainly was the first time he&#39;s ever asked her out!<br />
&quot;OMG I&#39;m actually going on a date with Mikael!!&quot; Jody hyper-ventilated. She breathed deeply, trying to calm down her shaking hands so she can reply back and she just opened the chat when another message came, freezing her heart along with a sudden realization... The message read &quot;By the way, I wanted to say this to you in person but what the hell, I absolutely LOVE the new look&quot;, followed by a couple of heart emojis, a rainbow/pride flag and a unicorn emoji. Jody realized that she accidentally sent Mikael those two selfies she took earlier... the ones in which she looks like she&#39;s trying to pass as a guy, or at the very least an uber-lesbian. &quot;Oh shit... What am I gonna do now?&quot; Jody thinks to herself, hand over her face with embarrasment. <br />
She decides she&#39;ll have some time to think it over, but first she quickly replies to Mikael &quot;Hey Mikael, sure I&#39;d love to meet you at the coffee shop later! See you there at seven &quot; She decided to purposefully ignore the comment on those selfies for now, as if that would make them go away. &quot;Who am I kidding though&quot;Jody whispers to herself pensively, &quot;Mikael asked me out precisely because of those pics... it makes sense, the magical perfume was supposed to make me be attractive for him specifically... I guess the look it gave me wasn&#39;t by mistake after all... Ugh, dammit Mikael why did you have to have such weird tastes?!&quot; She scrolls back up to the pics to look at them once more, as if to double check, just in case. &quot;Ugh! I HATE it&quot; She says, scrunching her nostrils. &quot;But... as bad and embarrassing as this is, I have a date with Mikael... I don&#39;t want to lose this chance, no way! Think Jody, what am I gonna do? Do I really want to go out dressed like some queer, hipster lesbian just to impress the man I have a massive crush on?... <br />
Jody plopped her phone down on her bed and sat down quietly next to it, a troubled look on her otherwise beautiful face. She lets out a long sigh. She checked her phone again - it was 4:36 pm. She needed to make a decision and act! <br />
After pondering her options for a few more minutes, Jody decided to ask for her roommate&#39;s advice and help. After all, Naima is a lesbian girl herself! She called Naima over to her room and briefly explained to her all the recent events, starting from the magical perfume, its effects and finally telling her about the date with Mikael. Surprisingly, Naima didn&#39;t have much trouble believing the whole magical aspect of Jody&#39;s story, and she was absolutely giddy at the prospect of her straight, feminine friend becoming a gender fluid, male presenting individual... or at least having her look the part! It&#39;s one of her fantasies come true, to turn a straight girl queer after all, she tells Jody grinning from ear to ear. Jody certainly wasn&#39;t impressed and it took a good bit of coaxing and pushing to convince her, but in the end convince her she did. <br />
Jody surrendered and agreed to let Naima help her with redressing, especially with the binder and bowtie part. She just stood there pouting in silence while Naima wiped all her makeup clean, removed her wig and bound her breasts completely flat, ignoring Jody&#39;s protestations She continued dressing her friend up in the men&#39;s briefs, baggy jeans, suspenders and dress shirt and finished up by tying the bowtie snugly and properly around Jody&#39;s neck. Jody gulps uncomfortably as Naima buttons up her top button and neatly folds down her white collar. She wasn&#39;t quite done though! Naima got an idea on how to perfect the look, to make Jody look even less like a girl. She expertly brushed her eyebrows with a bit of dark makeup to make them look thicker, more masculine. She also ran quickly to her room and brought back a little extra something - a souvenir from one of her exes. Jody almost screamed when she saw Naima return with what looked like a very realistic, veiny, erect penis and testicles attached to a flap of duratex like, rubbery material. &quot;What the hell is that thing Naima?! A dildo or something?&quot; Naima grinned as she applied some adhesive to the flat flap of fake skin. &quot;Heh heh, not a dildo my dear. This is called a packer. It&#39;s used by transgender, FTM individuals to provide the proper bulge in their pants.&quot; Naima explained matter-of-factly as she lowered Jody&#39;s jeans and briefs. Jody shivered in embarrassment at the feeling of Naima&#39;s hands caressing her smoothly shaven crotch, applying the adhesive directly onto her skin as well. &quot;What are you doing Naima?? What do you mean FTM?&quot; <br />
Naima placed the packer over Jody&#39;s lady parts, carefully positioning it to line up perfectly with her urethra, then she held it pressed flat for a few moments for the adhesive to take hold. &quot;FTM means female-to-male my dear ignorant friend&quot;She explains to a wide-eyed Jody, &quot;It&#39;s a biological woman, like you in this case, who is undergoing a transitional process with the goal of becoming a man. You know, you&#39;re really lucky too, this packer is state of the art tech. You can pee standing up and it even has synthetic semen inside the testes. It has sophisticated sensors that detect when you get aroused, simulating an erection, and when you orgasm it ejaculates... just like a real boy!&quot; Naima pulls Jody&#39;s briefs and jeans back up, admiring the unmistakably male bulge Jody now sported. She stands up, so close to Jody that their clothes brush against each other. Naima raises both hands to Jody&#39;s neck and straightens her bowtie playfully, a coy smile on her face blooming as she admires her now more-male-than-female roommate. &quot;You know Jody, I have to compliment you - the shirt and tie look really suits you, much more than women&#39;s clothes, I&#39;m sorry if that offends you but it&#39;s just objective fact - I mean yeah sure you make a beutiful young woman but this here is definitely the look for you! So elegant and handsome!&quot; Naima also reflects on Jody&#39;s face - while she obviously has beautiful, refined features, her face is a little on the longer side, with her straight, thin nose and averagely thin lips... with long hair and makeup on she&#39;s the typical attractive girl without a doubt. However with short boyish hair, no makeup and no mascara on, her face lends itself very well to the gender-fluid esthetic - together with the flattened chest, thicker eyebrows, male outfit and extremely male bulge, she does make for a convincing male... not even androgynous, just MALE. &quot;Jody, if you don&#39;t mind I think I&#39;ll refer to you as Brody now... no sane person who lays eyes on you would think of you as anything else than a transman anyway, believe me! Also, we&#39;re officially switching to male pronouns for you.&quot; Naima declares in a dead serious voice. &quot;But, Naima...&quot; Jody protests but Naima shushes her with a finger to the lips. &quot;No buts, I&#39;m serious, mister! You&#39;re no longer a straight girl named Jody, you asked for my help and I helped you. I made a handsome guy out of you, look at yourself!&quot; She drags Jody in front of the tall mirror. &quot;I did a fine job I&#39;d say, you should thank me&quot; <br />
Jody tapped her flat chest, taking in her reflection. She had to admit, she truly looked like a guy... &quot;Okay... you did a good job, thank you Naima...&quot; Jody whispered hesitantly. She grabbed the rectangular glasses from the vanity table and put them on. &quot;My name is... Brody...&quot; She said in a timid, feminine voice. &quot;Put more effort into it, man up!&quot; Naima egged her on. <br />
&quot;Hey Mikael, yeah, my name&#39;s Brody now by the way...&quot; Jody acted out, lowering her voice pretty convincingly. <br />
&quot;That&#39;s more like it!&quot; Naima clapped, &quot;Good boy Brody, embrace it, embrace it!&quot;</p>
