<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Damn. Damn it all!&quot;<br />
<br />
Cameron was lost, truth be told. I mean sure, he had left even after having forgotten his compass. And sure, his map was dated 80 years into the past. And he might have strayed off the path the locals had recommended, but other than that such an event should&#39;ve been utterly impossible. He was the star student of Alanax, for crying out loud!<br />
<br />
Well, even that was a bit off. He was actually ranked 592... of the 592 students that went to the magical school of learning. But it wasn&#39;t his fault none of the subjects played to his particular brand of genius! He was probably the most misunderstood student to date, nothing more, nothing less. Really, if the curriculum was just adjusted to not include abjuration, evocation, transmutation, illusions, conjuration... and a bunch of other stuff, he&#39;d be the top of his class.<br />
<br />
Even his current herbology project was going downhill, with him being currently lost in Evergreen Woods due to bad instructions from his instructor&#39;s part. What recklessness to send student to study plants in uncharted regions of the forest. Wait until his father heard about this!<br />
***<br />
It wasn&#39;t hard to see for anyone with a bit of sense that Cameron had only gotten to the prestigious school with the influence of his wealthy father, despite lacking a drop of magical power. That was hardly a dealbreaker, with a bit of hard work and dedication even normal people could unlock a magical spark. Cameron was just missing said dedication, expecting the power to come to him like everything else. In fact, if not for the plentiful sponsorship, he would&#39;ve been kicked out of the school ages ago for failing all his 1st-year classes three times in a row. But here he still was, working for a fourth, including a newly established herbology program, which had student get familiar with certain magical plants growing in Evergreen Woods. An extremely easy class that Cameron was somehow still failing in.<br />
***<br />
Fighting his way through thick undergrowth, Cameron grumbled and cursed as his school uniform was torn by branches, mosquitos relentlessly biting him. He was hot, he was hungry, he was thirsty, and most displeased by his current circumstance.<br />
Some of these worries were rectified, however, as he stumbled upon a small, crystal clear pool, twinkling in a peaceful forest clearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;At last! Water! I&#39;m saved!&quot; he exclaimed, practically diving into the pool, guzzling the liquid like the finest of wines.<br />
<br />
As he did, the magics of the pond began to swirl within in, bringing about a wondrous change. In the past, Cameron&#39;s ancestors had been filled with renowned magicians, due to the incredible union between the clan&#39;s first patriarch and the goddess of magic, Aurea, herself. Over hundreds of generations, however, the bloodline had been diluted to the point of of nonexistence. Until today, when the pond reawakened the dormant connection to the grandest of all magical beings.<br />
<br />
Cameron couldn&#39;t say a word as in a brilliant flash he was ignited, bathed in a golden power as magical power awakened in his veins in abundance, a spark of magic blossoming within that soon grew into a blaze, and finally became a roaring inferno of raw mana. Pure, unadulterated magical might burst out of his body as Cameron&#39;s being was remade in the image of his distant ancestor.<br />
<br />
His skin softened and his body hair was burned off beneath the caress of magical flames, all the while his pubescent body both stretched out and slimmed down, sacrificing his boyishness for maturity of a female variety, as a few years ticked forward in his biological clock. His hands thinned and lengthened, while his fingers grew long nails, topped off with delightful dark blue manicure that also spread to his toes while his legs grew, calves becoming delicate while his thighs seemed to pull fat out of the aether, inflating to epic proportions of heaving mass that crushed his diminishing manhood between them. The symbol of his maleness couldn&#39;t resists the feminine onslaught as it succumbed, slurping between his legs to become a virgin slit as his balls followed suit, transmuting into fertile ovaries that magically-enriched estrogen all around her body, supercharging the transformation.<br />
<br />
The moulding archmage couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore as her overloaded body started leaking mana into her surroundings, manifesting dozens of different spells. Fireballs, ice rays, beams of light, the clearing was bombarded with all kinds of projectiles. Spikes of stone pierced through the ground as plantlife grew rampart, overtaking everything as the changing figure was encapsulated in the water of the pool, flying up and up, soon freezing her surroundings, teleporting erratically out of the ball of ice that was vaporized in seconds by the heat emanating from her as thunderous CRACKS erupted from her, her hips snapping wider into a configuration suited for childbearing as actual lightning bolts heralded the change. Her butt filled into a delightful peach, soon followed by fat and firm breasts that crowned her naked chest, the nipples pointing proudly to the skies as she floated in the air, as the change was finished up with her face twisting into an otherworldy perfect visage, a perfectly symmetrical face with small nose, plump lips and sparkling, deep blue eyes, glittering with stars like a window to space. A sigh, cool and calm like a night wind, was let out as her Adam&#39;s apple shrunk to oblivion while her hair blossomed, growing longer and longer, silky deep dark strands caressing her floating body as they encompassed the beautiful being of magic, supremely long silky dark blue strands that reached down to her feet.<br />
<br />
The transformation was over, and Cecilia opened her eyes, taking in the world above the clouds where she had accidentally drifted in amidst her change. She couldn&#39;t help but smile at her previous self, one so stubborn to not acknowledge his inadequacies, and compare him to her present self, possessing a body descended straight from goddess Aurea, inheriting both her beauty and magical might.<br />
<br />
&quot;Truly, a pitiful creature.&quot; She breathed out as she effortlessly conjured a dress for herself, a night blue silky nightgown to go with her overall color scheme, almost completely see-through save for her crotch and chest area. The body of a goddess needed worshippers, after all. Every second she felt more and more distanced from her mortal peers, the newly born half-goddess already feeling above anyone she knew. A sidelong glance into her vast mind revealed innate knowledge of almost any spell in existence, along with the skill and nigh-endless mana reserves to use them. In fact, she was willing to bet her power eclipsed even Alanax&#39;s archmages...<br />
<br />
&quot;Curious. How should I use my new existence?&quot; Cecilia wondered aloud, all the elements dancing within her hands as she flew.</p>
