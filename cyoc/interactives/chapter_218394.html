<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a quick briefing, Sarah now found herself making her way towards Mika and Claudia&#39;s home. Driving through the streets, she began to mull over everything her and her team had learned about the Harris family.<br />
<br />
Alec Dyson had scrutinized the family before vanishing. Tom Harris had passed away under mysterious circumstances before Dysons arrival. Reviewing Tom Harris&#39;s military files, Sarah had been impressed by the former Marine Major. Tom had compiled an impressive service record before retiring and settling in this small town. Afterwards, his oldest son had followed in his footsteps. Cole Harris joining thr Marines before receiving an honorable discharge. Sarah had been surprised by the fact quite a few of Sgt. Harris&#39;s missions were still classified.<br />
<br />
Sarah decided to have Greg Wesker interview Cole. The young agent was former military as well, Sarah hoping this would make the interview process easier. As far as the othe Harris siblings were concerned, Sarah assigned Dave to interview Julia Harris while Michelle Kim would be tasked with interviewing Dereick Harris.<br />
<br />
It made sense to Sarah to have Michelle and Dave interview these two siblings. Julia worked at the local hospital and probably had more information than her younger brother Derrick. Dave was an exceptional agent with a easy going personality, hopefully his friendly nature could pry some information from the young doctor. As for Derrick, the young man worked as a teacher at the local high school. Michelle, being the youngest of the agents, had yet to truely get her feet wet with field work. Sarah wanted to ease the promising young agent into field work and considered Derrick Harris to have the least amount of information available. If he did know something though, Sarah was convinced Michelle would unearth it. That left Claudia for Sarah.<br />
<br />
Before his disappearance, Alec Dyson had been quite interested in Claudia Harris. Sarah had reviewed her bio, discovering that she had married young, purchasing a hone with her wife Mika. Afterwards the pair had adopted a daughter Kari before having a pair of twins named Aaron and Haley. Considering the young couple were only in their mid twenties, Sarah was intrigued as to how they had adopted a child at that young of an age. Approaching the Harris&#39;s front door, Sarah now rang the bell. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nat can you get the door,&quot; Rei called. &quot;I&#39;m busy getting lunch ready.&quot; Nat nodded, placing the book she was reading to Kari down as she made her way towards the door. A business conference had taken Mika out of town for the day, along with Claudia. The young parents had been looking for a day away and with Mika having business in New York, she thought she would surprise her wife with a day trip to New York City. Unfortunately, it meant Nat and Rei would be babysitting all day, which they honestly didn&#39;t mind. Still, considering they were trying to find Chenoa&#39;s parents,  Nat wanted to help. Opening the front door, Nat now found herself gazing at a rather attractive woman in her thirties. &quot;Can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi,&quot; Sarah smiled. &quot;I was wondering if Claudia Harris is home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No she&#39;s not here,&quot; Nat replied. &quot;Can I ask who you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry where are my manners,&quot; Sarah stated, the agent now removing her badge. &quot;Sarah McMillan DHS. I was hoping to talk with Claudia about an investigation from a few years ago. Do you know when she&#39;ll be back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat&#39;s eyes went wide as she gazed at the woman. DHS! What did the government want with Mrs. Harris? Studying the woman carefully, Nat had a sense that the woman meant them no harm but still, what was she doing here? &quot;Um she&#39;ll be back later tonight,&quot; Nat stammered.<br />
<br />
Sarah nodded, glancing past Nat as she noted the small child sitting on the couch. &quot;I see,  I take it you&#39;re babysitting,&quot; Sarah smiled, to which Nat nodded. &quot;Remember those days. Hope the Harris&#39;s let you have unlimited fridge privileges. I remember some of the parents I babysat getting on my case about eating too many ice pops.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No the Harris&#39;s are cool,&quot; Nat replied. &quot;And their kids are absolutely sweethearts.&quot; Sarah nodded, still sporting a smile as she looked past Nat. Peering inside she could see the house was occupied by the Harris&#39;s three children as well as another teenager. It seemed the other girl was also babysitting as she busied herself making lunch for the kids. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t catch your name,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Natalia,&quot; Nat stammered. &quot;Natalia MacGregor but everyone calls me Nat. Am I in trouble?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Sarah said quickly, trying to put the teen at ease. &quot;No not at all Nat. It&#39;s nice to meet you you don&#39;t have to worry about anything. The Harris&#39;s aren&#39;t in trouble I just have some questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh okay,&quot; Nat said softly, still fidgeting nervously in front if the agent. Sarah now flashed the teen a warm smile. Maybe she shouldn&#39;t have flashed her badge, the teen had become nervous as soon as she learned her identity. Still, something told her her that the Harris women were hiding something and that this girl knew what it was. She needed to keep her talking. &quot;Natalia MacGregor? Are you related to Marisa MacGregor? The author?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nat nodded, still a bit pale at Sarah&#39;s presence. The woman hadn&#39;t done anything wrong but, the fact the government was asking questions about the Harris family made her nervous. &quot;I&#39;m a big fan of your mom&#39;s work,&quot; Sarah blushed. &quot;I&#39;ve bought all her books. She&#39;s a phenomenal author.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Nat smiled. Sarah and Nat exchanged pleasantries, the agent still studying the interior of the Harris home, looking for something amiss. What she saw instead was a bit of a surprise.<br />
<br />
Gazing at the youngest girl, Sarah saw as a small brown tail and a pair of cat like ears emerged on the young girl. At first Sarah thought it might be a costume or even a pet. After a moment though she realized it wasn&#39;t. Somehow the Harris&#39;s youngest daughter had an animal tail and ears. Sarah now noted how the other teen noticed, quickly hoisting the girl up into her arms.<br />
<br />
In an instant, the girl chamged back to normal, her tail and ears vanishing as the other teen nervously looked towards Sarah. Not wanting to let either babysitter know what she had seen, Sarah simply smiled before handing Nat her business card. &quot;Anyway,&quot; Sarah said warmly. &quot;When Mrs. Harris comes home can you give her my card? I&#39;ll be in touch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay sure no problem,&quot; Nat said quickly, offering the woman a small smile before closing the door. As Sarah now made her way back to her car, she paused as she glanced back at the Harris home. She knew what she saw but, it made no sense. Animal/people hybrids didn&#39;t exist. Is this what Alec had discovered? Entering her car, she now called Dave to give him an update.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Dave it&#39;s Sarah,&quot; she said. &quot;Listen I just finished checking on Claudia Harris and her family. I think Alec may have been onto something.&quot;</p>
