<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were in a room with two beds. You also saw a dark chocolate arm holding you. Looking up to the face you recognize Angela King. You had met her a month after you got your job since you wanted to make sure the son of a child molester you had helped catch was being taken care of. She's eighteen and very devoted to the kids in the orphanage. She had told you that when she was younger a virus had attacked her ovaries destroying her eggs so she couldn't have children that were biologically her own. That's something you shared now.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you Cassie?&quot; Angela asked her voice full of concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;The pain's gone,&quot; you said and looking at yourself. It looked like you you had stayed the same except for your change of sex and age. You took in what you were wearing. A white frilly dress, white frilly ankle socks, and black Mary Janes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't expect to see you in here like this,&quot; Angela said. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave decided to make sure I didn't get a promotion at work,&quot; you said snuggling into Angela.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the rest of us had been there longer than you,&quot; Alexia said. &quot;I was just making sure that others that had been there longer had the chance at the promotion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a rumor that I was getting the promotion Alexia,&quot; you said. &quot;Rumors tend to be unfounded and shouldn't be taken seriously.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would have taken it though if it turned out to be real,&quot; Alexia said in a growling voice.<br />
<br />
You looked at her and said, &quot;Yes I would have. That would be showing that they trusted me enough to take on extra responsibilities. But I doubt that I was up for the promotion since I was new there. There's others there that would be far better suited to be promoted by virtue of them being there longer. And did you ever think that the rumor may have been a test?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A test of what?&quot; Alexia asked looking perplexed for a porcelain doll.<br />
<br />
&quot;A test to see who was fit to be promoted,&quot; you said. &quot;It makes sense. Put out a rumor that the newest person was going to be promoted and see who kept it to themselves to show trustworthiness. Also it could have been designed to see if anyone would take it seriously just based on hearsay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you saying that I showed I couldn't be trusted in a higher position?&quot; Alexia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that we can't give the police hearsay as evidence,&quot; you said. &quot;We have to have solid proof that the sicko was going to come meet a child. If you take a rumor of a promotion as fact and act on it without having the facts can you really do your job?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess not,&quot; Alexia said. &quot;Wally's going to fire me for sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I did hear him say he would do that,&quot; you said. &quot;But he can't fire you since you don't work there anymore. Same as me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really messed up didn't I?&quot; Alexia asked.<br />
<br />
You reached over, picked her up, and cuddled her to your chest. You guessed that she was about thirteen inches now. After a moment you said, &quot;What's done is done and we can't change it. All we can do now is live with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If one of you has a turn you can turn each other back,&quot; Angela said looking confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;We each said that no one can transform us if they ask us the question,&quot; Alexia said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you two will be able to grow up at least,&quot; Angela said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a doll,&quot; Alexia said. &quot;I won't age and I said that Cassie wouldn't either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That may make it more difficult for you to be adopted,&quot; Angela said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Julie said she'd try to adopt me if I ended up here,&quot; you said sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's good,&quot; Angela said. &quot;If you two are ok I'm going to go talk with Mrs. Cain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure we will be,&quot; you said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Angela said. &quot;Dinner will be in about an hour. You remember where the dinning hall is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure I can find it,&quot; you said remembering the layout of the orphanage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I'll see you at dinner if not before,&quot; Angela said as she got up and left the room.<br />
<br />
You took Alexia and went to sit in the window. It was nice that they had built these windows with a sill you could stretch out in. The cushion and pillows were soft and comfortable so making sure you didn't show your panties to the world you stretched out on it the window on your left. You watched people going about their day and then Alexia said, &quot;I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. Can you forgive me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I can,&quot; you said thinking that it would be best to bury the hatchet.<br />
<br />
A couple minutes later you saw a guy who looked to be about eighteen walked up seemingly lost in thought. He looked up and waved at you so you decided to wave back. His attention was caught by someone else. The guy looked like a bodybuilder. The guy who had waved at you started talking to him after staring at the new guy for a moment. They sat down on a bench and talked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think they're talking about?&quot; Alexia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd have to say the second guy's body,&quot; you said. &quot;They first guy was staring at the second like he hadn't seen him before.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a bit the first guy started shrinking. Soon he was a girl wearing a nice dress. You saw Angela walk up to them and start talking. She came back inside then after a few minutes went back out and talked to them some more. Angela took the new girl's hand and brought her into the orphanage. The guy sat on the bench looking like he was beating himself up inside. Soon Angela walked in with the new girl and said, &quot;Cassie. I have a roommate for you. She was just transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I watched it,&quot; you said. &quot;I'm Cassandra May Plunkett and this is Alexia. What's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanya May Turner,&quot; Tanya said smiling.<br />
<br />
You smiled back at her and said, &quot;It's nice to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is nice to meet you,&quot; Alexia said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you too,&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well girls it's time for dinner,&quot; Angela said. &quot;Come along and wash up. You can bring Alexia Cassie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Being careful not to bunch your dress up exposing your panties you slide off the window seat and followed Angela. Of course the first stop was the washroom. Inside there was a communal shower area with four showers, four toilet stalls, and four sinks. You did need to pee so you placed Alexia on the counter and went into one of the stalls. It was a little strange sitting down to pee and having it come out of a different place but it wasn't bad. After you were finished and had washed your hands you picked Alexia back up and you joined Angela and Tanya to go down to dinner. You had to wonder what they had prepared.</p>
