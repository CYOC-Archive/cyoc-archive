<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked at what options he had for changing the pocket dimension. There were a lot, many mundane options like &quot;parking lot&quot; or &quot;grocery store&quot; that didn&#39;t seem that interesting.<br />
<br />
One caught his eyes, &quot;anime convention&quot;. He remembered how Jenny had hinted she wanted a curvier body, and thinking of conventions, Jeff thought of sexy cosplayers, or how girls in anime tended to have ridiculous proportions. Though, sexy cosplayers were probably a tiny fraction of the people that attended conventions. Nevertheless, he wanted to try it out, with how many attended a convention, at least to see how many people there would be in his pocket dimension.<br />
<br />
He turned the pocket dimension from a bar to an anime convention.<br />
<br />
Jeff returned to his closet. He walked through it, and at the end, he stepped out a door. Instead of a quiet bar, there was a huge open space filled with people and various stands.<br />
<br />
Wow. How was he going to find Jenny or Missy among all these people? Jeff started exploring, or before he did, he made sure to remember the door he&#39;d stepped out off. <br />
<br />
Jeff walked around. There were people dressed in full costumes as characters he didn&#39;t recognise, but most people were dressed in normal clothes with maybe one  wacky accessory.<br />
<br />
Jeff saw a particularly hot black-haired cosplayer. She was a catgirl. Judging by her clothes, she seemed to be from a fantasy series. It took a few moments of looking at her, that is to say ogling her cleveage, before he took a closer look and recognised her as the human form of his cat from the bar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Missy?&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff?&quot; She turned towards him. &quot;Jeff!&quot; she squealed, rushed up to him, and went for a hug, squeezing her tits barely contained by her costume top unto him.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt himself get red hot. He&#39;d ogled all the womwn, and now feeling the touch of a woman (even if it was his cat), her breasts at that, immediately made him rock hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff. It&#39;s so nice to see you.&quot; Missy smiled and released the hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, um.&quot; Jeff felt himself tongue-tied. Just speaking to a real woman was overwhelming. Wait. He wasn&#39;t usually like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on? Something wrong?&quot; Missy asked.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at her, then glanced down at her chest, then looked at her again. &quot;No. It&#39;s, um, nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Missy smiled.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked over himself. He was slightly skinnier than usual. He was wearing a shirt featuring Pretty Star Mimoko. How did he know that character? He had never heard about her, or her show before, yet he could recall all the episodes, especially the fan service OVAs. <br />
<br />
Of course. Jeff knew what was going on. He&#39;d changed to better fit in to an anime convention, so the Chronivac had given him knowledge of anime, but more noticeable, he was so fucking horny. Was he some kind of stereotype of a horny dweeb? Like, he couldn&#39;t help himself from staring at the girls around him, especially Missy. To think that back in the bar, she threw herself at him, and he rejected her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Missy?&quot; Jeff started. &quot;Do you want to, like um,&quot; he fumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Back in the bar, when you were flirting. Um, could we continue feom there?&quot; he asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Missy laughed. &quot;Don&#39;t come crawling back to me after rejecting me. Find another girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Another girl? Have you seen Jenny?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw her over there.&quot; She pointed to a corner. &quot;Don&#39;t know if she&#39;s still there though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, okay.&quot; Jeff hurried there, part to find Jenny, part to get away from the embarresement of getting rejected by his own fucking cat.<br />
<br />
He arrived at the area Missy pointed to. He looked around for Jenny. She might look a little different, so he looked at various people if they had a feature resemblimg Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned to the voice. He saw a girl which kind of resembled Jenny. She had red hair. She wore heavy colorful makeup, but more strikingly, unlike Jenny, she was a bit fat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny?&quot; Jeff replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
There was an awkward silence where neither spoke. Jeff again was tonguet-ied speaking to a girl, even if this should be his long-term girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you pick this?&quot; she asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ehrm, I don&#39;t know. I was just curious. It seemed interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; Jenny shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t know if you saw Missy. Like she ended up super hot, and here I just got fat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, you at least have boobs.&quot; Jeff looked at Jenny&#39;s chest which looked big under her shirt. Even if she was somewhat chubby, just big boobs were enough to grab Jeff&#39;s current self&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
She hefted her chest up, then she dropped it, causing it to jiggle. &quot;But I am fat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that fat,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you&#39;d still prefer the usual me, or Missy,&quot; Jenny grumbled.<br />
<br />
Jeff thought back to Jenny&#39;s normal body, or he tried. Any previous experience he&#39;d had with girls felt foreign and inaccesible. He just felt a need to get his dick wet and touch a woman, especially boobs, big ones like Jenny had. He was getting so hot and flustered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we step outside?&quot; Jeff asked. He needed some fresh air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we? Isn&#39;t this just a mini dimension? Does an outside exist?<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I don&#39;t know. We could try?&quot;<br />
<br />
They found the exit to the convention center, and yes, they could step outside. They did, and saw what seemed like a fully realised world, a sky, a parking lot outside the center, and other buildings too.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so cool,&quot; Jenny remarked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s like an isekai almost,&quot; Jeff said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isekai?&quot; Jenny chuckled. &quot;Like I know about anime stuff now. Did it happen to you too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jeff nodded.<br />
<br />
The couple discussed their knew interests. Jenny however, was a little more eager to share, and talked about how she found anime boys super hot.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you don&#39;t like real men?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I do like real men, but kind of a different type. Like Asian guys are super hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I&#39;m not your type right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but also kind of. Like you&#39;re kind of cute looking. Like you do seem a little bit skinner than usual, and I like that.&quot; Jenny grabbed Jeff&#39;s wrist. She placed her hand around it, gripping fully around his wrist. &quot;Look.&quot; She giggled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh.&quot; Jeff smiled. &quot;Your hand is so much chubbier than mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately Jenny released him and her expression turned sour.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait. What is it?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; She said. &quot;I don&#39;t like being called chubby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s not you. Like you&#39;re not actually fat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re saying it again!&quot; Jenny compkained, but then she paused. &quot;Still, I guess you&#39;re right. It&#39;s silly to be insulted when it&#39;s not the &#39;real&#39; me. It just feels bad, like because of it, it feels like no boys ever like me, well this version of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But your tits are so big. I think they&#39;re super hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just part of me. It doesn&#39;t feel right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not just part of you. You have a fat ass as well.&quot; Jeff laughed.<br />
<br />
Jenny rolled her eyes. &quot;I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re serious or not, but yeah, this discussion is kind of silly. It&#39;s a whole set of hypothethicals and vibes about a person that&#39;s an alternate version of me.&quot; Jenny paused for a moment. &quot;I think this version of me needs to get laid, like get her head away from anime and Asian pretty boys. What do you say Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t be happier. &quot;Yeah.&quot; He grinned. &quot;This version of me too, like I, or he I should say, badly needs to get laid, like you have no idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I checked. I am staying at that hotel.&quot; She pointed to the building next to the convention center. &quot;Let&#39;s go there. We&#39;ll have some privacy at my room.&quot;</p>
