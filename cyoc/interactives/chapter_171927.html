<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William woke up with a major headache and a burning feeling on his back. He got up and looked around, not knowing the room he is in. There were multiple paintings of animals like a duck, a cow, and even a pig. It looked like a country themed room, but the box labeled “toys” made it seem like he was in a room meant for kids. <br />
<br />
He got out of bed and realized he wasn’t wearing his clothes. Instead of his tee and pants, he is wearing pajamas. His light blue shirt and sweat pants looked like it was meant for young children. <br />
<br />
He looked around the room and stared at the door. It was bigger than what he was used to. He connected the dots and realized something. He wasn’t just wearing childish clothes, he was the perfect size for them.<br />
<br />
Searching the room, he wasn’t able to find anything other than his clothes. “Whoever picked me up must have taken my phone and wallet.” He thought.<br />
<br />
William left the room and looked around. His room was at the end of a hall that had multiple doors on both the left and right sides of the hallway.<br />
<br />
As quietly as he could, William made his way down the hall and seeing a living room. There wasn’t anyone there, but he did hear the sound of utensils in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Slowly inching his way closer to the sound, he was able to hear two people’s conversations. It sounded like two women with one of them sounding older. <br />
<br />
“So where did you say you found him?”<br />
<br />
“On the side of the road. Poor thing looked beat up. He was wearing oversized clothing and had a tattoo on his back.”<br />
<br />
“A tattoo? On a child? What kind of parent would do that to their son?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe that’s why he was on the side of the road. He could have ran away!”<br />
<br />
Losing his grip on the floor, he tripped over and fell. His cover was blown and he saw two people staring back at him. An older woman was sitting at the kitchen table drinking coffee. The other woman in her mid 30’s who was cooking something on the stove.<br />
<br />
“Well good morning! Did you sleep well?” The old woman asked. William was unsure how to act, let alone say. <br />
<br />
The old woman got up and gestured to an open chair, “Sit sweetie! It’s ok!” William slowly walked over and sat in the chair. He wasn’t sure how old he was, but the chair made him know he was pretty small.<br />
<br />
She sat back down on her chair and sipped on her coffee. William was served a plate of pancakes and bacon. “Syrup?” The woman asked. William nodded his head and the woman poured some on the pancakes.<br />
<br />
“What’s your name sweetie?” The old woman asked. <br />
<br />
“William. Where am I?”<br />
<br />
“It’s ok honey, you’re someplace safe. Why were you on the road?”<br />
<br />
William wasn’t sure what to say. If he told them that he ran from the cops they wouldn’t believe him. So instead of answering, he remained quiet.<br />
<br />
“When my dad found you on the side of the road, he grabbed you and took you here. When I gave you a bath, all of us noticed a tattoo on your back. Did your mommy or daddy put that tattoo there?”<br />
<br />
“Tattoo? I never had a tattoo!” William thought. He tried to look at his back but forgot he isn’t that flexible. The woman gave William a phone with a photo of him.<br />
<br />
On the middle of his back was a tattoo of the necklace’s jewel. It was as big as his fist so it was pretty noticeable. He tried to touch it but the burning pain came back.<br />
<br />
“Does it hurt?” The woman asked. William nodded his head. “Well then I guess we won’t be touching your back for a while.”<br />
<br />
William was finished with his breakfast and had his plates taken away. After that he felt a wet rag touch his face. The woman wiped any syrup off of him with the rag. After that, William got out of his chair and was unsure what to do.<br />
<br />
He went to the living room and sat down. He closed his eyes to pretend to sleep so he can think for a sec.<br />
<br />
“So that man gave me an amulet or whatever, and it’s on my back. That means there’s something about it that special. Did it make me this age? Where is my stuff? It’s a good thing since they’d soon figure out what I was falsely accused of.”<br />
<br />
“Do you wanna watch tv sweetie?” The woman asked. William opened his eyes and saw the woman offering the remote. He looked at it and shakes his head.<br />
<br />
“Well if you wanna go back to sleep then a bed would be better!” The woman offered to pick William up. He was uncertain, but accepted being picked up. <br />
<br />
William was carried to the room he woke up in. The woman tucked him in and closed the door. He waited till he couldn’t hear her footsteps. When they were inaudible, he got out of bed. <br />
<br />
Once more, he searched the room. Everything was so old on the designs. The clothes looked like they were for a child during the 70’s.<br />
<br />
Using the mirror, William attempted to figure out his age. Sadly, there was no point as he looked like he was 4, but he didn’t have the bladder of it.<br />
<br />
Taking off his pajamas to change into normal clothes, William noticed something about the tattoo. It showed the number six in the middle of the amulet. “Is that my age?” William thought, “I was short when I was younger, so maybe that’s my age!”<br />
<br />
Suddenly the door opened. Instead of the woman or the old lady, it was a man. He looked to be around his 30’s. He had the same blond hair and blue eyes as the women in the kitchen, but he has a dirty blond beard. <br />
<br />
He and William were staring at each other, both having an emotion of panic. William didn’t know who he was or why he entered the room, only wishing he was wearing pants. The man wasn’t sure why there was a child in his old room.</p>
