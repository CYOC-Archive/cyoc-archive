<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steven Foly had a long day. He was late to work and missed a conference meeting, which caused him to work unpaid overtime today and tomorrow, and he was stuck cleaning the bathrooms and cooking wares for that time. After work he saw that someone had bumped into his car and left a major dent in the trunk, to the point that he couldn’t close it. And finally, at home, his dad had made him dinner. An hour ago.<br />
<br />
Steve was preparing for his senior year at college next month and he was just hoping for a bit of leeway to ease his stress. He undressed to his boxers and prepared himself for bed. He did have a body going for him, well muscled but not really toned, some hair on his chest, and some nice scruff on his face. He wasn’t lacking anywhere else, but he also didn’t really have anything to show off, especially “down there.” <br />
<br />
Steve washed his face and went to bed, but once he fell asleep, he immediately woke up again in The Forest. Steve thought he was dreaming, but he fell asleep just moments ago. And he was thinking to himself. He saw the path to the cottage, but the whole scenario was frightening to him. And he only had his boxers. Even in his dreams he was still having a stressful day.<br />
<br />
Steve walked inside and was greeted by another man about the same age. He had a nice beard, and he seemed like a strong guy so Steve made sure to keep an even distance. “Am I dreaming?” he asked quietly.<br />
<br />
“What? Oh, no you’re fine. You were brought here because yoouuu...” he stopped. “Shit wh- Oh, because you needed a change in your life,” the man said.<br />
<br />
“I’m not following.” Steve said. Quickly, an older woman appeared from behind the man and followed up.<br />
<br />
“Sorry about the introduction Steve. Ryan is new, and I wanted to throw him into this right away for me. Anyhow, he’s right. You’re here because your life from this point on will be awful. College dropout, heroin abuse, the whole deal. So I- well, WE are offering you a change in life,” the woman said.<br />
<br />
Steve stood there. He was thinking for a while when he noticed the woman was occasionally peeking down at his body. “Uh, well,” he started, “what or why leads me to heroin?” Steve asked.<br />
<br />
“Let’s just say an ‘inevitable trauma that cannot be avoided.’ So, if you don’t decide quickly I will do it for you. I need to teach this buffoon some confidence,” she said pointing at Ryan, who looked mildly offended.<br />
<br />
“Can you let me change my body? Like shapeshifting, but if you could make it like limitless?” Steve asked.<br />
<br />
The witch pondered. “The cost would be higher to make it ‘limitless.’ You’re sure this is your desire?”<br />
“You mention a price now after saying that you’re giving me a life change?” Steve asked harshly.<br />
<br />
“This is an offer, Steven Foly, now do you accept the price?” The witch had a fire in her eyes when she said this, and Steve only looked back and nodded. He accepted. “Right then! Two side effects are: One, the cost, is that for each day of the next two weeks, you will change into something new each time at midnight. Two, I expect you to behave. Act accordingly. While there are laws, sometimes breaking them with the right intent are okay,” she winked. The witch began to whisper under her breath and reach into her pocket.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, you said someTHING? What is th-“ Steve was cut short and returned home, in bed just moments after he “left.”<br />
<br />
The witch smiled and looked at Ryan. “Come on, boy. We have a week to help out out buddy Steven, and another for you to learn some magic!” Ryan followed. For his first time helping somebody, he thought about how normal this guy was, but the witch also seemed a bit too happy with his request. But he didn’t care. He’d soon learn some magic.<br />
<br />
..................<br />
<br />
As soon as Steve was back he woke up in a cold sweat. He remembered the whole ordeal, so he knew it couldn’t be a dream. He sat up and looked at his clock.<br />
<br />
“11:58.” He waited a moment and the clock moved to 11:59. “Fuck.” The witch had said every day he’d change at midnight for two weeks. That would be 14 changes before he could control it, but he realized the last one wouldn’t have an effect because he should have his “power,” right? That was two weeks worth of work, of socializing, of nearly anything that he was giving up. He thought about possibly negoiating the “cost” when Steve felt something fuzzy on his legs.<br />
<br />
Steve looked down to see his leg hairs growing out in abundance, covering his legs and feet in fur. He looked down at his toes and watched them fuse together and harden. They were growing, and pushing him up about an inch. His feet were becoming hooves! Steve tried to pull his boxers off as his thighs and legs were expanding. He managed to get them off, only to see his massive genitals. His balls were bigger than his fist and were pulled down between his muscled thighs. His dick was swinging at the same height, but it was growing from Steve’s excitement.<br />
<br />
His shaft turned a darker hue as it grew out at least 14” with a flattened tip that resembled a horse. Steve tried reaching around it and needed both hands, hands of his that seemed to have a little more hair on them. He was so caught up in his monster cock that he forgot the rest of himself. Steve put his feet, well hooves, into a pair of slippers. They didn&#39;t fit, but he’d move aroud quietly.<br />
<br />
Steve shuffled to the bathroom and locked the door. In the mirror he had to be at least 2” taller. His body was much more muscular, and the real change was below his waistline. He looked at his head and saw two little protrusions. ‘Horns,’ he though, ‘I’m a minotaur?’ Steve had put the changes together quickly, and suddenly became tired. A whole day trying to hide his appearance just to stay safe and keep things normal. This would be exhausting.<br />
<br />
He went back to his room and made sure to keep his blanket secure so that he’d have his legs hidden just in case somebody came into his room before he woke up. He lie face up and rubbed his body. He was stronger and hairer, and he liked it. Although these weeks would be tough, it could give him some ideas when they were over. Steve closed his eyes and blacked out.</p>
