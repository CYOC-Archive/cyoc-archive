<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Mary, Thomas and their kids were having a wonderful moment, a moment in which their sons had accepted their parents as a were-lion and a were-wolf and they would likely become one of those two were-creatures. Neither one of the six-year-old twin boys knew that since their mother had been recalled to her pride, they would have to leave their home, school and everything else behind and become wondering were-creatures living in the shadows of the human world.<br />
<br />
Standing back watching this wonderful moment, wondering if they would have the same luck as their friend was Stacy, Monica and Rose. <br />
<br />
They hadn’t told their own husbands/wives or their kids yet about them being were-cats and having been recalled. They each had ideas on how their families would react. <br />
<br />
“Ah…feel that.” said Mary as she took one of her son’s hand’s and placed it on her fur covered belly. “Your little sister just kicked.”<br />
<br />
“Cool.” said Ryan with a huge smile on his face.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a cell phone from the kitchen started to ring, being the nearest Stacy walked in and brought it out, handing it to Thomas who took it out and unlocked it.<br />
<br />
“Hello.” said Thomas into the phone, his voice slightly deeper in werewolf form.<br />
<br />
“Thomas, it’s Josh.” said Josh “We need to talk…we have…Thomas…are you?”<br />
<br />
“Transformed yes.” answered Thomas as there was a long pause on the phone. <br />
<br />
“Why the hell are you transformed, your wife…” started Josh his voice near a panic.<br />
<br />
“She is a were-cat.” Answered Thomas as their was another long pause.<br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Josh<br />
<br />
“She is a were-cat, she confessed it to me a couple of minutes ago and we just told our kids, she has been recalled.” stated Thomas<br />
<br />
“She’s been recalled too?” inquired Josh<br />
<br />
“Who is this?” inquired Rose as she looked at Mary.<br />
<br />
“Josh, he is one of Thomas’ frat buddies, my guess he is a were-wolf as well.” answered Mary, she wondered if her husband’s long weekend out with the “boys” was really them going out hunting in werewolf form. She couldn’t really complain since she did the same with her pride, the spa trip she took once every 3 months or so was really her going out in her were-cat form with her pride.<br />
<br />
“Yes, he is our small pack alpha.” answered Thomas as Mary held out her hand, as Thomas handed her the phone.<br />
<br />
“Josh, this is Mary I am the leader of our pride, I assume it’s the same role as Alpha in your pack?” inquired Mary <br />
<br />
“Yes, I communicate with the Alphas of the main pack and so on.” Stated Josh “Your really a were-cat?”<br />
<br />
“Were-lion actually.” Corrected Mary “I got informed of us being recalled about an hour ago. How about you?”<br />
<br />
“About the same, I was in a meeting at work so I missed the first call.” Explained Josh <br />
<br />
“What are the odds that both of our groups got recalled at the same time?” inquired Mary <br />
<br />
“Something is going on, where are you supposed to meet with your pride?” inquired Josh<br />
<br />
“In the mountains about 2 hours away from here.” stated Mary, it was a risk, she wasn’t supposed to tell anyone where the pride was currently staying because of the risk of them being hunted down and killed. “On the western shores of that massive lake.”<br />
<br />
“Same, by the boat docks.” confirmed Josh “They want us there by dawn tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
“Same.” confirmed Mary. “A were-wolf pack and a were-cat pride meeting at the same place at the same time, and recalling their people? Something is going on.”<br />
<br />
“What the hell is going on?” inquired Rose<br />
<br />
“Maybe, they are going to rebuild that city.” offered up one of Mary’s and Thomas’ six year old boys, as all the adults looked at him stunned, none of them had considered that. <br />
<br />
“Could they really be attempting to rebuild our lost city?” inquired Monica with some hope in her voice. “That was always a dream, could they really be willing to attempt that.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, I’ll leave you to get everything in order, Thomas, I will handle getting the rest of the guys and explaining things to our families and I will see you tomorrow at dawn.” stated Josh<br />
<br />
“Alright, see you at the docks.” stated Thomas as Josh hung up. <br />
<br />
“Could this really be? Could they really be wanting to rebuild our lost home and to stop being nomadic after all these generations?” offered Mary with so much hope as she placed her hand on her stomach. “Could our daughter be born in our new city? The first generation born in our city?”<br />
<br />
“We can hope.” Stated Thomas before looking at his wife’s friends “But now I assume you all need to tell your families.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” confirmed Stacy “And we don’t have all that much time.”<br />
<br />
“Agreed.” stated Mary as she looked at Stacy, “Your wife’s is due home from work soon right?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” confirmed Stacy “Time to tell her the truth.”</p>
