<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Connor parked was thinking a bit and then got a buzz from his phone, he checked it and saw a text from an unknown number... &quot;It&#39;s Suzy, got your mom&#39;s number from dad, and then your number from her.&quot; Second buzz &quot;I can see you parked out there, do you not want to fuse?&quot; <br />
<br />
Connor texted &quot;I mean I want our parents to be happy, but this is a little too sudden. I&#39;ll ring the doorbell and how about we try to convince your dad first to call off the fusion?&quot;<br />
another text &quot;Eh, he&#39;s kind of thick headed...&quot;<br />
&quot;So is my mom, but your dad is here.&quot; <br />
<br />
A small discussion later Connor and Suzy were in a somewhat large gender neutral room with a queen sized bed, a nice desk, and even a TV. Connor wondered how they could afford this if Suzy was going for a scholarship, and Suzy&#39;s dad had apparently an extensive amount of favors and influence everywhere besides the realm of education. More than that Connor and Suzy had lost the debate horribly and were not totally on board with going ahead with the fusion... at least in theory. <br />
<br />
Connor asked &quot;So I guess we&#39;ll sleep together in your bed?&quot;<br />
Suzy said &quot;It really isn&#39;t. It&#39;s our bed... We just got moved in and I haven&#39;t even slept in it yet. This room is truly ours together...&quot; The two were staring a bit at two pills and some cups of water on the desk... They just had to drink down the pills and the two young adults would be bound together and eventually become one through nano-machines... <br />
&quot;Do you believe in that the people who fuse die and are replaced with something new?&quot; Connor asked<br />
Suzy lay on the floor and said &quot;...No, I have a friend whose a fusion. I&#39;ve asked about it, and at least with the more modern fusions it&#39;s more like eventually our consciousness just fuse as well. Although I&#39;m not sure how long that&#39;ll take.&quot; Connor was starting to feel real antsy about something, and just walked up to the desk and took the pills. &quot;Wait, what are you going to do with those?&quot;<br />
Connor said &quot;I&#39;m going for a drive, wanna come?&quot; Suzy didn&#39;t particularly feel that comfortable in the room either and decided she&#39;d go with her Step-brother. <br />
When Suzy&#39;s dad asked what they were doing and getting a response the end of the short dialogue was &quot;Just make sure they get inside.&quot; Connor was driving at the lower limits of the speed limit, it was dark after all and he just wanted to cruise a bit. It helped him think a bit, although the cute girl in the passenger&#39;s seat was still nervous. They didn&#39;t talk for awhile until Connor started pulling into a Mcdonalds. <br />
&quot;Just pulling in for some fries and a drink. Want anything my treat.&quot; Connor stated. <br />
&quot;I guess some fries and a diet coke would be nice...&quot; Suzy muttered not really caring about the calories. She also wasn&#39;t that happy when Connor chatted a bit with the employees that he knew, and were really excited he had a girl with him this late at night. They got the bag and their drinks, but as Connor hadn&#39;t asked for his food yet Suzy wasn&#39;t going for her fries or drink yet. A few more minutes of driving and Connor parked in a park near the top of the hill. He leaned his chair a bit back and said &quot;Small place my parents took me to go watch shooting stars once... Thought it could just be nice to just hang here... Could you pass one of the fries?&quot; Suzy gave him his fries and they munched as they looked at the black sky with a few stars overcoming the light pollution. There was silence for a bit aside from some quiet mastication and some sips. <br />
Connor took a deep breath and said &quot;So... I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going to happen, but... What do you think of the car?&quot; <br />
Suzy asked &quot;What?&quot; somewhat expecting Connor to try making a move or something. <br />
&quot;What do you think of this old thing?&quot; Connor said as he slapped the dashboard softly. <br />
&quot;It&#39;s nice although a bit old.&quot; <br />
&quot;Good, If we are to be one it makes me feel good knowing that we&#39;ll like the car together. It&#39;s a bit of a memento, and I&#39;d like us to continue to use this car as long as we can.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;ve got some jewelry at home.&quot; Suzy said feeling a little dumb the way it came out. &quot;What I mean is... along with the necklace I&#39;ve got on me now my mother left me some of her jewelry in the will and... Do you think we could wear it as well?&quot; <br />
&quot;If we turn out to be a girl I&#39;d be fine wearing most of it, and if we turn out to be a guy then... We&#39;ll try to figure out some way to use as much as we can. For sure I wouldn&#39;t want to pawn off you connection to your mom, just like I&#39;d rather not send this car to the junk yard.&quot; they chewed through a few more fries as Johnny said &quot;Imagine up in Heaven your mom and my dad watching down on us... and maybe they got together.&quot; with the last bit said sarcastically. Suzy just sighed and looked out her door&#39;s window. <br />
Suzy said &quot;Closest thing I&#39;m getting to a date, and you had to make that sort of joke...&quot; <br />
Connor took out the pills and said &quot;Well, I think I got what I needed to know before taking mine. You want to take yours as well?&quot; Suzy&#39;s hand took hers although a bit shakily. They both knew that just ingesting the pills wouldn&#39;t immediately start the fusion. The particular pill would start syncing their minds, and over the course of some time determined by a program would start to mend them together and try to make things seamless. This would occur over the course of how long their parents would want it to be, but that wouldn&#39;t be in an instant or even a single night. Whether it happened immediately or not taking the pills would still bind the two of them. A few sips later and the pills were on their journey to some stomach acid which would break the capsule and release the nanomachines into their bodies. On the drive back Suzy ended up dozing off leaving Connor to carrying her out along with the trash. Suzy&#39;s dad let them in, but just let Connor carry his daughter up to their shared room. Setting her on their bed he was able to notice her necklace in the better light, and it was a sterling silver cross. <br />
Connor wondered what he was going to do for his own bed... I mean the queen sized bed was big enough for the two of them but... I mean they are going to be one soon but...<br />
<br />
In the morning...</p>
