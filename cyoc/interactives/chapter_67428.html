<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Locking the door behind him Tyler took a deep breath before kicking off his work-out shoes, ignoring the <br />
sweaty musk that immediately wafted out of them.<br />
<br />
His ass still sore from what he was convinced had only been a realistic nightmare, he made his way up to his <br />
bedroom, forgetting about anything else he had needed to do that night, collapsing into his bed. His eyelids <br />
felt like iron weights as they began to droop down on him, and in a matter of seconds Tyler was drifting off <br />
to sleep under the light of the first night of the full moon.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
&quot;Ahhhh!&quot; Tyler screamed as he flung upwards in bed, having just awoken from a dream that was all too familiar <br />
of what had happened last night, the only difference was that the positions had been swapped. He had watched <br />
first-hand as that so called weregay fucked his body in the steam room and it had terrified him. <br />
<br />
He cooled down as he realized that he was in the safe confines of his own room, drenched in sweat and <br />
breathing heavily, his naked body glistening. <br />
<br />
&quot;Naked? What the fuck...I went to bed with all my clothes on....&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure enough he was lying in his bed, completely naked. But the weirdest part was his morning wood, or to be <br />
more accurate, evening wood for he had somehow slept in until 6 o clock at night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably a trick that Thomas played in me....stupid bastard.&quot; Tyler grumbled getting up from bed before <br />
walking over to his drawers. Thomas was Tyler's roommate but he might as well be his brother. They had known <br />
each for so long and so well that it was like they had grown up together, but Thomas was known for his pranks. <br />
He threw on a pair of boxers followed by some ankle cut socks, a pair of loose baggy shorts and his white <br />
wife-beater before making his way out of the room,  not noticing that outside the sun was setting and the full <br />
moon would soon be rising....<br />
<br />
He made his way into the kitchen and noticed a note on the fridge, <br />
Tyler, I'm hitting the bars. Desperately in need of some action, see ya later.<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, the blonde grabbed a jug of orange juice from the fridge and reached for a cup when <br />
something impacted his nostrils. Inhaling deeply he dropped the jug onto the counter and turned around, an <br />
erection having formed in his shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;What smells so fucking good..&quot; He began to make his way to the front foyer, just as the full moon finished <br />
its ascent into the sky. Warmth began to flood through Tyler's body but he ignored the soothing feeling, <br />
instead falling to his knees in front of the pile of shoes, more specifically Thomas' gym shoes.<br />
<br />
He picked a sneaker up, admiring his best friend's size fourteen shoes, envying them, wishing he had feet that <br />
large. Remembering that he was going to be alone, for the most part, he brought the shoe up to his face and <br />
inhaled the musk deeply, his eyes practically rolling into the back of his head as he did so, a wet spot <br />
forming in the front of his shorts.<br />
<br />
Moaning in arousal, Tyler slipped his socked foot into Thomas' gym shoe and practically squealed as he felt <br />
moisture in it, meaning that Thomas must have just gotten back from the gym before heading out to the bar. As <br />
he tied the 3 sizes too big shoe around his right foot, Tyler grabbed its counterpart and did the same, <br />
standing up in Thomas' shoes. <br />
<br />
Grinning he walked back to the kitchen and looked outside, his gaze caught on the full moon that shone <br />
brightly in the night sky. Immediately his eyes widened and his jaw dropped as he became mesmerized by its <br />
beauty.<br />
<br />
&quot;So beautiful...&quot; he exclaimed, not taking note that it was in a voice that didn't belong to him, rather it <br />
was his voice that had dropped an octave or two.<br />
<br />
As the moonlight washed over him Tyler felt only more heat and pleasure flowing over  his body and he even <br />
took a few steps back, feeling as though he would explode if he stood under the moons presence any longer.<br />
<br />
Maoning once more Tyler began to rub his hands over his body, pulling at the straps on his wife beater. The <br />
warmth that was flowing through his body was incredible and he didn't know what he could do but close his eyes <br />
and stand there in bliss as the wet spot in his shorts became deeper and larger.<br />
<br />
The bulge in his shorts began to push farther and farther out, the waistband of his shorts going along for the <br />
ride until his shorts seemed to make a bowl shape, allowing his boxers to be visible. Stubble began to form on <br />
his clean shaven face, blonde at first like his hair, but soon darkening to a brown and than even black. It <br />
began to grow thicker and thicker soon becoming a thin beard that moved upwards to attach with his sideburns, <br />
immediately causing a ripple effect.<br />
<br />
His blonde hair, as though crude oil had been spilt all over it, shifted into a dark ebony, losing some length <br />
and becoming a short and spiky style.<br />
<br />
His wife beater began to stretch tighter and tighter against his body as the muscles in his chest and stomach <br />
began to inflate, pushing the material to its limit before tearing down the middle. A hard, powerful chest <br />
with dark pink nipples became visible that were accompanied by an inflating six pack. His arms began to pump <br />
up now in order to accomodate the growth in his torso. Swelling as though air was being pumped into them.<br />
<br />
His hands began to grow massive in size as well, becoming thick digits that were calloused and shown signs of <br />
use and wear. Black hair began to swiftly poke out through the back of his hands and his knuckles as well, <br />
giving Tyler gorilla hands.<br />
<br />
Soon the hair growth made his way up his arms as well, becoming a thick forest coating them from wrist to <br />
elbow in thick, straight man fur. His massive chest seemed to be darkening but that soon proved to  be only <br />
hair as well as a thick patch bloomed out from between his pecs, swirling around his nipples and zipping down <br />
into a treasure trail that encircled his navel and hid into his boxers.<br />
<br />
His ass began to push at the seat of his shorts, and now with pressure coming from both ends, his cheap gym <br />
shorts began to tear down the side until they finally tore in half and fell to the ground around him, <br />
revealing his white boxers which weren't in much better shape. His 9 inch erect member was pushing at the <br />
button in the front of his boxers and finally with one last push caused it to fly forwards, his dick thrusting <br />
out through the little pocket of his underwear. An itching sensation began to form on his behind and as he <br />
scratched it was a large meaty hand, he felt the material rubbing against thick man fur down there as well.<br />
<br />
Tyler knew he wouldn't be able to last much longer, and grabbed his cock with one of his hands, pumping it in <br />
rhythm with his beating heart. He didn't know what was happening and he didn't care for that matter, he was <br />
far too into it to realized that something insane was happening to his body.<br />
<br />
His bare legs began to thicken as muscles were added to his calves and thighs before hair erupted from every <br />
pore down there as well and soon enough it seemed he was standing on a set of bear's legs, the flesh nearly <br />
invisible beneath the black fur.<br />
<br />
He opened his eyes, his mind telling him that this was all normal, but that he wouldn't want to miss the grand <br />
finale. Looking at Thomas' worn-out but oh so manly gym sneakers, he realized they were beginning to feel <br />
tight. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck yes,&quot; Tyler moaned in a low, sensual voice.<br />
<br />
He began pumping faster and faster and his balls began to churn. His feet were now being confined by the cheap <br />
material and as he cock pinched backwards for a moment before shooting forwards Tyler let out a powerful roar <br />
as cum cannoned out from his member, firing several feet in the air as the fronts of his shoes exploded as did <br />
his socks, revealing massive feet, covered in black hair as well, that were at least size 17 in size.<br />
<br />
Gasping heavily Tyler looked down at his boxers and realized he had to find some clothes and fast, he had some <br />
partying to do.</p>
