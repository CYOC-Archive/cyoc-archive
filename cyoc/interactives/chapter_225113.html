<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
This concert was different than the others, the band seemed to be on autopilot, their passion and fury was just for show. Unlike their previous performances, this one was pre planned and professional, unlike their previous spontaneous sets. Their new employers were expectedly upset at their behavior over the weekend. Choon Hee had stated that they would have to shape up or changes would have to be made.<br />
The Normal had even signed them up with a label called: “Harmony Records”, a company secretly owned by the organization that now owned them. The record label mostly signed on bands that played generic pop music filled with vapid lyrics and mindless catchy tunes. The vampire shuddered at the thought that they would eventually be forced to conform to the style boasted by the other bands under their new label, eventually becoming another soulless band hidden under glitz and glamor.<br />
Bong-cha was fuming at being forced to play a concert, their band was about freedom and individuality. The very things that have been taken from them. But they couldn’t be free if they were dead, for now they had to do what they were ordered to.<br />
<br />
The rest of the night was like all the other nights they played except the red haired front woman cursed less and was more melancholic. Most didn’t seem to notice and the ones that did just assumed she was just being a typical moody teenager.<br />
<br />
After their set ended on schedule, much to Bong-cha’s dismay, they were approached by their handler, Choon Hee, who clapped mockingly.<br />
<br />
“Good work, now for the important part: the mission.” She started.<br />
<br />
She then brought out three large cases and a thick tablet. The device came to life and projected images of two people; a man and woman. The man was Asian and looked younger than he really was, the woman was white with long blonde hair.<br />
<br />
“Shiro and Jennifer Tozawa, a wizard couple living in upstate New York. Shiro is a powerful wizard and has connections to the Moreland’s and the Hariss’. His wife, while not as powerful as her husband, is still quite dangerous. Jennifer had also been in contact with a catalyst in her youth. They are not to be underestimated,” the Korean woman explained.<br />
<br />
“What about the third person?” Luca asked.<br />
<br />
“The only intel we could find points us to New York, Miss Kirkman’s exact whereabouts are most likely known by Mr. Tozawa.” She elaborated.<br />
<br />
“Inside each of these cases are equipment you will find useful for this mission” she said and motioned to the three metallic suitcases.<br />
<br />
Neither of the three band members were happy about this arrangement, but it was either this or death they kept reminding themselves.<br />
The three opened the chests and examined the contents inside; knives guns and other soy looking equipment. What causes Bong-cha to speak up was the clothing she found inside, <br />
<br />
“What’s this supposed to be?” She asked.<br />
<br />
“It’s your uniform, more like a sneaking combat suit, it comes equipped with life sign monitors and offers some magical protection, their prototypes based off of our previous anti-magic armor. However these are more covert and lightweight.” The woman explained.<br />
<br />
The prototype Mk-2 AMA(anti magic armor) Type S was black and practically skin tight, it had extra protection located on the elbows and knees, with a boob plate and integrated gloves and slightly heeled boots. <br />
<br />
Bong-cha and Setepenre were hesitant to wear something that could be considered a uniform but realized that they had no choice but to obey and wear the stupid suit, at least it would help protect them against magic. <br />
Each suit was designed specifically for the two girls and fit each of them like a glove. <br />
The vampire strapped on a pair of dual pistols and a harness that held two more pistols. She sheathed a carbon nano steel yedo sword with a black scabbard and red wrapped handle. The girl looked at Choon Hee and the woman smiled, the smile looked foreign on her face.<br />
<br />
“I figured you would like a more familiar weapon. You were apart of the Kwan Family, so I assume you were trained in the art of this weapon.” The immaculate and properly dressed Korean woman said.<br />
<br />
Bong-cha unsheathed the weapon and spun it around with precision and grace, stoping it three inches from the kumiho’s neck. The control chip in the girl’s neck stopping her. Choon Hee gave raised her eyebrow with a smug expression, she knew that this girl was completely at her mercy. <br />
<br />
“Put that away Private Joon, first class, and let me finish getting you ready.” She ordered confidently.<br />
<br />
Bong-cha begrudgingly obeyed and spun her new sword back into its sheath and placed the weapon on her back where it attached perfectly. She was irked by her new title, it reminded her that she was a part of the system. She was also made a higher rank than Setepenre and Luca, as if to divide them, and make it seem as if Bong-cha was superior to them. She didn’t like it.<br />
The woman led the red haired girl to a chair and proceeded to remove her piercings.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” She asked as her dark makeup was washed away, powerless to stop it.<br />
<br />
“These could catch light and give away your position.” She explained and began to gather the girl’s unruly red dyed hair into a tight ponytail that made Bong-cha feel like her face was pulled back.”<br />
<br />
“And you don’t want your hair getting in your face, that goes for you too Private Setepenre.” She continued.<br />
<br />
The Egyptian had finished getting dressed in her suit as well, she’d equipped many knives and had a shotgun holstered on her back. <br />
When she heard rhis she rolled her eyes and began removing her piercings and makeup as well, she pulled her box braids into a neat ponytail as well. <br />
<br />
Luca was confused and slightly embarrassed; his suit consisted of a pair of tight black pants that ended just below his knees that had armored knee pads. He put on a thick belt that holstered two massive revolvers, a black thick collar akin to a dog’s collar was fitted around his neck. He’d put his long hair into a ponytail too.<br />
Choon Hee noticed this confusion and elaborated,<br />
“Your suit is meant to accommodate a werewolf transformation, your kind is more durable so you don’t need much more protection, but the tag on your collar has a rune for some magic protection.” <br />
<br />
After the three were geared up they were handed earbuds.<br />
<br />
“Put these in your ears, they’ll allow you to maintain communication with each other as well as the command center here.” Choon Hee explained. <br />
<br />
A black, tinted window car pulled up as they left the concert building. They were instructed to get inside.<br />
<br />
“This transport will take you a block away from the Tozawa’s residence; they have taken control of the entire apartment building, so expect the residents to be under the control of the targets and hostile. However you are not permitted to kill anyone but the targets.” Their handler explained. <br />
<br />
“Shiro and Jennifer Tozawa are located on the penthouse, your team is to infiltrate the building through the underground parking garage. Private Joon has been given a small cylinder with two buttons on the side; once you make it to the garage entrance, place the device in front of the entrance and press the bottom button twice and the top button once: this will set off a small anti-magic field that will temporarily allow Private Redwood to break open the doors and enter.”<br />
 ((Usually if a werewolf is born into a pack they use the pack’s name as their last name.))<br />
<br />
“Know however that the magical barrier will only be down a few seconds and once you are inside you will be trapped inside the magical barrier.” She informed.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you just use a big anti-magic thing or give us two? How are we supposed to get out?” The black girl asked.<br />
<br />
“Because, Private Setepenre, these devices are still in prototype stage, we don’t yet have the capability of making one powerful enough to permanently destroy magical barriers.” Choon Hee answered, making sure to use their ranks to remind them of their new allegiance.<br />
“As for how you will exfiltrate; once the targets are down their magic will be suspended.” <br />
<br />
“Great, so what can we expect in there, lady?” Bong-cha asked.<br />
<br />
“That’s Ma’am to you three. Remember you are part of a structured organization, and you will refer to those of higher rank with respect.” The woman corrected with a slight smirk and nod to the younger girl.<br />
<br />
“Right. What can we expect, Ma’am.” The girl restated, hating having to speak respectfully.<br />
<br />
“That’s more like it Private Joon. The organization has no idea what your team will find inside but Mr. Tozawa one of the children of a powerful witch, as her son I would imagine him to be quite formidable. I would advise to take his wife, Jennifer, hostage and once he’s lowered his guard you execute both of them.” She said.<br />
<br />
“And we have to kill them—ma’am.” Bong-cha hastily added the last part much to her chagrin.<br />
<br />
“Yes Private Joon, your orders are to eliminate all three targets, is this understood Private?” Choon Hee said quickly, bringing up a screen on her wristwatch, the detonation controls visible for them to see.<br />
<br />
“Uh— Y-yes ma’am, of course ma’am!” The Korean girl stammered out nervously. <br />
<br />
She gulped and hated the things she had to say, she didn’t want to take the lives of the married couple but knew they had no choice. The Tozawa couple would have to die and she and her friends would have to do it.<br />
The woman closed the screen and sat back, crossing her legs, satisfied at her response and cooperation.<br />
<br />
“While on missions you will all go by code names for covert purposes: Private Joon, First Class, you will be known as Kilo-2-2. Private Setepenre, you will be Puma 6-9. And Private Redwood will be Bravo 30-1. I am designated as Alpha 0-1, however this is not my true code name, i might not always be your mission advisor, anyone in command of you on a mission is given the designation Alpha 0-1.” She informed much to the displeasure of the group.<br />
“Once you move up the ranks you may be given a more unique code name like Blackbird or Boss. My code name is Humming-Fox.” She said.<br />
<br />
The vehicle arrived exactly one block away from the target building. As the three got out Choon Hee nodded at them and then they began to quickly make their way to the apartment building.<br />
<br />
“So what’s the plan Private First Class Joon, ma’am?!” Setepenre jokingly asked while they jumped across the rooftops with their supernatural ability.<br />
<br />
“Shut up, let’s just get to the building and we can figure it out once we’re inside.” The vampire replied annoyed.<br />
<br />
“Whatever you say ma’am. What do you think Puma 6-9?” Luca replied much to Bong-cha’s continued annoyance.<br />
<br />
“Kilo 2-2, get you team to cut the chatter.” Choon Hee snapped from their comms.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, Affirmative Alpha 0-1. Puma 6-9, Bravo 30-1 cut the chat and stay focused.” Bong-cha commanded. <br />
<br />
She hated the way she now spoke, especially when she has to order around her friends like some stick-in-the-ass soldier.<br />
<br />
Once the team made it to the garage entrance they entered exactly as their commander had instructed and they were inside hostile territory. The mission had officially begun.</p>
