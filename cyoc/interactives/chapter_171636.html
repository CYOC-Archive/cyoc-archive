<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ellen entered the room as she entered the world, completely nude. Slowly she remembered what clothes were for, they were needed in the world where people didn&#39;t walk around nude. She forgot the bra and panties. Wearing a lite grey slip skirt and a buttoned up black top with sleeves. Trying to button it all the way up she managed to get four buttons tightly secured however her breasts threaten to burst the fifth button so she wore it loose.<br />
<br />
Ellen unbuttoned her top exposing her breasts to her mirrored reflection. She felt okay but something was missing, something inside of her. Rubbing her stomach she felt how flat it was, too flat. A woman came in she looked flustered and sweaty. She wore green pants with a expansion in the back to cover over her done of a belly with a black sport top to hold her heavy breasts. Ellen buttoned up her shirt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, are you alright?&quot; asked the woman.<br />
<br />
Her accent was French or something. She had a lot of tattoos, she wore sunglasses with dark brunette hair. Ellen somehow knew her name was Monqiue. Once she was a model until she married an American diplomat in Paris, they moved out to Washington DC. She had two children by him, her eldest was a teenage daughter.  The guy was cheating on her so she married a lobbyist who adopted her first two children, then to solidify their relationship she would have another child. <br />
<br />
She got twins, then he got her pregnant again. This was her sixth child and she still looked good for someone in their late thirties with a sixth kid on the way. But she had taken her husband to the doctor to get fixed so that she was sure he could never get her pregnant again. <br />
<br />
&quot;You really don&#39;t want this baby do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Monique blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...I don&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to give the baby to me, you don&#39;t want to go through birth again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to give birth....can you please take it...mercie...&quot;<br />
<br />
Something deep inside Ellen stirred, a hunger that could only be slated by this woman&#39;s womb. Wetting her index finger she slipped it into Monique&#39;s all but gone belly button for thirty second before doing the same to her own, reaching in between the gaps in her black top. The two women kissed like lesbian lovers and Ellen started to read this woman&#39;s mind, she loved having children. Monique was only agreeing with Ellen because she was run down by the kids.<br />
<br />
“AAUUUGGGHH!!” Monique was interrupted by Ellen’s scream of anguish. She sank to her knees amid shards of the broken cast. She covered her crotch with her hands and squeezed her breasts together with her arms as though she were posing for a nude photo, but her eyes were screwed shut and she winced in pain.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong!?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. It just Like someone just shoved a baseball bat up there.”<br />
<br />
“Up There? Your ”<br />
<br />
“Where the fuck do you think; idiot?” Ellen felt the hard object tense and release a load of fluid into her vagina. Panting as the pain subsided, the pain was soon replaced by a shrinking feeling located within her pelvis. The sensation shrank, and shrank into an infinitesimal ball, then exploded forth as a thunderbolt of pleasure and electricity, filling her entire being.<br />
<br />
When the shock of her first, very intense female orgasm had subsided, Ellen felt a strange pressure welling within her: a strange rolling sensation as though a golf ball were beginning to be wound within her now most secret self. Over and over it turned, winding, becoming larger. Ellen arched her back and pushed her hips forward on instinct, and relaxed as the ball slowed and stopped.<br />
<br />
“What the hell?” she panted and looked down at her body. Her feminine body stared her back in the face, taunting her and preparing for the final insult. The golf ball that had wound itself up in her body was gone, serving only to make the conditions ripe inside. A new, tiny spark pinged into existence within her fleshy womb and began to expand.<br />
<br />
Ellen’s stomach clenched and she emptied its contents onto the ground as the new entity grew past its first months of life, and kept growing. Meanwhile, the pressure built up underneath Ellen’s skin and threatened, she felt, to make her explode until her body could take no more and began to bulge outward. At first, it was barely noticeable, but as it grew and bulged her body more, she could feel its presence in the absence of slack in her black top, beneath her breasts.<br />
<br />
A moan escaped Ellen’s lips as her belly bulged more and more, pressing tightly at her skirt and causing the fabric to begin to slip downwards slightly her heart shaped ass Ellen gasped and clenched and unclenched her abdominal muscles instinctively, her body trying to rid her of this internal pressure, as her belly swelled liquidly. Finally, the button of her skirt started to give out and popped open forcefully as her hips were forced wider by the weight of the life within her womb. The shirt then began to slide down easier with slow, jerky movements the rounder Ellen’s belly became.<br />
<br />
Monqiue gaped, wide-eyed as she watched Ellen’s belly grow heavy and pregnant. When her shirt buttons popped off and were torn open, Monique was afforded a view of the skin of Ellen’s stomach, poking out above, and stretching the waistband of, her grey, skirt. “Oh my god,” she whispered as he stepped back from the remains of her clothing.<br />
<br />
“Aaahhhh Aaaaa ” Ellen’s voice rose as she whimpered plaintively, the pressure growing too much for something else yet again, and her belly button popped outward suddenly. Meanwhile, her breasts had been burning and aching painfully as they expanded, filling with fatty tissue and preparing to feed another being.<br />
<br />
Ellen held her hands under her belly and supported it as her rapid pregnancy came to a halt around the seventh month. Hormones led to tears of sadness and helplessness streaked down her soft cheeks, and for a few long moments she only knelt on the cold tiles and sobbed.<br />
<br />
 She looked down at her pendulous belly and slid her hand up its slope. It seemed like hours until her hand came into view at the crest, underneath her stretched skin. Ellen didn’t notice Monqiue as she pulled up her shirt so that her stomach was exposed; he was blushing furiously, but couldn’t bring herself to look away. She just continued to watch as Ellen’s face suddenly deepened into curious confusion.<br />
<br />
“Oh god… It just moved,” Ellen whimpered. “There’s a baby in there. I’m not just fat, I’m pregnant! There’s a baby in my stomach, it’s alive, and I’m pregnant!” There was a long pause. “Oh man, oh man, oh man… It’s moving again. It feels so weird…”<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done, you are now expecting your first child and my sixth. I wish I could return my children at time.&quot;<br />
<br />
They exchanged clothes, Ellen&#39;s had survived pretty much intact while Monique was happy just to make the exchange. Monique left as sexy as she ever felt while Ellen was now seven months knocked up.</p>
