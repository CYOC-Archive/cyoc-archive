<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Isaiah and Lester, now uncle and nephew in name, continue to chat it up as they merrily make their way across <br />
the lot. Isaiah didn’t hold back as he fills Lester in on his life story. He tells him how he used to be this <br />
and that, but Lester continues to remind him that he stills the same regardless of what he may look on the <br />
outside.  “It’s not “use to be”, unck,” he explains to him. “Yer forgetting that yer still the same guy.”<br />
<br />
“I know I’m still the same, but its hard acting like nothing has changed for me. I’m gay, I’m older about to <br />
become REAL old, and I’m a bear with a huge odor fetish. Not only those, but I’m being welcomed into a new <br />
family as an uncle and a father. How can I act like I’m the same old me when my entire life is changing?”<br />
<br />
“Listen; alls I’m sayin’ is that you don’t have to go so far about it. That’s what happened to Monty and mah <br />
pa. They used ta been real nice fellas, but they came so gung ho on their transformations that they gon n’ <br />
forget who they were. Look at ‘em now; a troublemaker and a nasty tycoon who thinks he’s some big shot. You’re <br />
thin’ ta come mah unck, another member of mah family, and I don’t want ya to end up like ‘em is all.”<br />
<br />
“Lester…” Isaiah never thought about it that way. “You know boy, I understand where you’re coming from. My own <br />
dad used to be a kind-hearted and caring guy; someone I could look up to. Then life hit ‘em and he started to <br />
hang with the wrong crowd. Dope and marijuana entered into the picture, and suddenly he wasn’t the loving dad <br />
I used to know. Now he’s serving 25 years with all of his other “brothers” and thugs. Don’t worry kiddo. I <br />
sure as heck won’t have you experiencing that same trauma all over again. You’ll always have an uncle, your <br />
friend; to turn to if you need to get something off your chest.”<br />
<br />
“And that’s why I love ya the way ya are,” smiles Lester.<br />
<br />
For a split second, Isaiah truly had seen Lester as his nephew rather than a friend. What's more is that he <br />
couldn’t shake this underlying feeling that all of this was fated. Like everything he had experience in his <br />
prior life was contrieved just for the purpose of filling that family void his nephew seems to be missing. The <br />
primary intention of him joining the family is to help manage the Triple Crown bears; but he's starting to <br />
feel he was destined for much more than that. Their is an urge growing inside to put right the family that <br />
torments his nephew so; to become the backbone that not only Lester could depend on, but to be there for his <br />
upcoming brother and especially his new son as well. “I love you to,” he replies. Isaiah can sense that his <br />
sexual admiration towards Lester is starting to wane into a lesser but more meaningful degree of “family” <br />
love. “When everythings finished, I think I’m gonna have a good word with the rest of the family so we can all <br />
come together and be one happy bunch.”<br />
<br />
They venture forward and they finally arrive at the steps to the house. Even though Isaiah brimmed with <br />
confidence earlier, he could feel butterflies filling his stomach. <br />
<br />
“You ready for this, unck?” asks Lester.<br />
<br />
“Uh…um yeah. Just a sec.” He closes his eyes and takes in a big breather. This is it. A new life awaits him <br />
past that door. He takes a long glimpse of his surroundings as he knows the next time he’ll be seeing the <br />
world is through the eyes of a much older (and hopefully wiser) different man. As he looks, he spots someone <br />
sitting not too far away. He couldn’t tell who it is as the figure blended with the darkness around.<br />
<br />
Lester joins his uncle to see what he’s looking at. “What’s up?”<br />
<br />
“That shirt… Isn’t that… No way; it is! C.J!!” <br />
<br />
“What!?”<br />
<br />
“YOOO-! Ceee-“ Lester tugs his uncles bicep hair just in time to stop him. “Oww!”<br />
<br />
“Aren’t ya forgettin’ sumthin’, “unck”?” he says putting great stress in the word unck. “Great… Now yous’ gone <br />
and gots his ‘tention. Listen, don’t say annthing and let mahself do all the yappin’.”<br />
<br />
“What!? B-but I... I gotta say my good-byes and rap things up. He and I went through a lot together and this <br />
could be the last time I’ll ever see him again. Come on, let me just have a few words with him.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh Fine, but yer gun have ta promise to keep a good check on yer words. Here.” Lester sticks his right pinky <br />
out. “Swear ya ain’t gonna give ‘im any ideas of who ya really are. I’m real seerous (serious) about this, <br />
unck.”<br />
 <br />
Isaiah raises an eyebrow. “Uhhh… a pinky swear? What are you, 5?&quot;<br />
<br />
“Jus’ promise!”<br />
<br />
Isaiah reluctantly returns the gesture. “mmmkay… alright.” After that, he then quickly straightens himself up <br />
and turns towards the approaching teenager. At long last, he’ll finally be able to catch up with his old buddy <br />
and wonders how he should approach this coming conversation.<br />
<br />
“What do you want, Lester…?” asks C.J. in a depressed (and annoyed) tone.<br />
<br />
“I ain’t the one that called ya; he did,” replies Lester as he points to his uncle.<br />
<br />
Isaiah gives C.J. a heads up. “Yo man, Um… I uh seen ya sittin’ all the way over there by yourself. I'm just <br />
wondering if everything’s straight with ya.”<br />
<br />
C.J. gives the odd stranger an equally odd glare. “Uhhh yeah. And you arrre--?”<br />
<br />
“I’m… well… I’m just a curious stranger. It’s dangerous out here being all alone, y’know.”<br />
<br />
“Righhht. Thanks for your concern, mister.” C.J. begins to walk off back to where he sat. “Now if you wouldn’t <br />
mind, I’m kind of in the middle of something.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah steps forward and reaches out. ”Wait! Mind if I talk with you for a sec? Please?”<br />
<br />
C.J. groans, rolls his eyes, and turns back around. “Why? Are you trying to come on to me or something? Sorry, <br />
but I don’t exactly swing that way. Plus, I’m still a minor so you better back off.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, calm down! It’s not like that. I just want to have a few words with you, that’s all.”<br />
<br />
“About what?”<br />
<br />
“About why you’re sitting in the middle of a compound full of older men alone and at night. This place is full <br />
of us gays and some might be more than willing to abduct you or somethin’.”<br />
<br />
Lester nods his head and hums, “Mmhmm.”<br />
<br />
“Why do you care what happens to me? Leave me alone,” spouts C.J. as he motions the stranger away.<br />
<br />
“Hey, don’t be snappin' at my unck like that!” defends Lester. “He be only carin’ bout yer safety is all.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, so this is your uncle?” asks C.J. He can immediately see the resemblance between them; however, they look <br />
more like brothers than uncle and nephew. After Lester nods his head, C.J. walks up to Lester’s uncle and <br />
says, “I’m sorry I shouted at you like that, sir.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah grins kindly. “No problem, kid.” For now, he decides he’ll refrain from calling C.J. by his name. He <br />
doesn’t want to raise any suspicion about his real identity. “So tell me, what’s eating you, son? Where’s that <br />
friend of yours?<br />
<br />
“You mean Mark? He went home not too long ago.”<br />
<br />
“How? Isn’t your car still here?”<br />
<br />
“It is, but well… this guy from a company called Arctos offered to take him home, and so… yeah.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah fondles with his thick mustache. “Hmm, I see,” he mumbles. “So how come you’re still here?<br />
<br />
“Actually, I’ve been looking for a friend of mine named [INSERT YOUR FIRST AND LAST NAME HERE], and… I really <br />
don’t want to leave without him,” responds C.J. Of course, he already knows what happened to you, but he <br />
believes that Lester’s uncle wouldn’t believe a word he says if he reveals the true story. <br />
<br />
“Oh… well, I don’t know anyone here with that name.” Isaiah glances at his former friend’s troubled face and <br />
lightly elbows him on the shoulder. “Relax, guy. Keep lookin’! I know you’ll find him.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, mister…” C.J. grows quiet and closes his eyes.<br />
<br />
Lester looks at the time on his cellphone and nudges his uncle’s shirt. “Yo, unck; I think it’s high time we <br />
wrap this up.”<br />
<br />
“(*Sigh) Alright…” sadly mumbles Isaiah. “Well son, I guess I have to get going now.”<br />
<br />
“Um, wait…!,” stops C.J. “Before you go, would you mind if I asked you a quick question?”<br />
<br />
“Mmkay. Go for it.”<br />
<br />
“If… If you had a chance to live a whole new life, one that you’re uncertain you’ll like, would you?”<br />
<br />
Isaiah hesitates and instantly becomes shooken. “Um err… Well… um, w-why you asked?” he stutters.<br />
<br />
“Well I’m just… thinking about some things right now,” C.J. glances to his side. “That’s okay, you don’t need <br />
to answer. It was a stupid question.”<br />
<br />
Lester chimes in with his own opinion. “Wellll if’n ya asked me, I’d reckoned I’d pass. I happen to fancy mah <br />
life, even with the ups and downs.” He then turns to his uncle and smirks slyly. “What ‘bout you, unck?” <br />
<br />
Isaiah leers at Lester and is quite put off. “I think I’ll take the chance. It’s an opportunity of a lifetime <br />
and you could think of it as a whole new adventure really. But even so, you also have to take into <br />
consideration of all the things you’ll be giving up. If you feel that you don’t want to leave behind the <br />
things you care for, then maybe it’s not worth it. It all depends, but like I said; I’d personally take the <br />
risk.”<br />
<br />
“Good answer, unck!” replies Lester as he happily slaps his uncle on his back.<br />
<br />
C.J. grows quiet again and looks onward as he thinks more about his choice. Isaiah on the otherhand becomes a <br />
tad worried at why his former friend would ask such a question. “You sure nothing’s wrong, son? That’s an odd <br />
question to ask.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mister. It’s all good.” C.J. has finally settled on a decision and breaks out of his trance. “Excuse me <br />
you two. I need to go inside and have a word with one of them.”<br />
<br />
Hearing that, Isaiah grew even more cautious about C.J.’s objective. “You’re going inside too? Well then, how <br />
about coming along with us for a second?”<br />
<br />
“What…!?” Lester protests. “We can’t -”<br />
<br />
“Quiet, boy!!” shouts Isaiah much to Lester’s surprise.<br />
<br />
“Sure… Alright,” responds C.J. cautiously. “I’m sorry to ask, but what’s your name? It’s a little weird to <br />
keep calling you sir for some reason.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah stutters at the thought. This is the first time a new name has crossed his mind since he’s changed. <br />
“It’s uh… um...” Isaiah had to think of something fast. Anything at this point would do. He then glaces down <br />
at the many rocks below him and then it hits him. “Rocky!” he shouts. “Ye-yeah, my name’s Rocky. Rocky <br />
“Mountain” Maxwell or just “Rock” is what the guys here like to call me,” he adds to make his sudden new name <br />
sound more believable.  <br />
<br />
“Hmm, that’s a cool name,” compliments C.J.<br />
<br />
“Ain’t it?,” chimes in Lester as he pats his uncle on the back. “It rightly fits him, I reckon.”<br />
 <br />
Isaiah (or Rock that he is called now) simply blushes from embarrassment. For a name he thought up on the <br />
spot, it does have a cool ring to it. He decides from this moment onward, his name will officially be Rocky <br />
Maxwell; he’ll think up a proper middle name later. “Thanks you two,” he smiles goofily. “Alright, now let’s <br />
hurry inside.” He then turns towards C.J. and whispers, “Stay close to me.”<br />
<br />
The three of them venture onward, up the stairs, and arrive at the front door. After a doorbell ring from <br />
Rock, the trio awaits calmly until the effeminate looking man, whom Lester and C.J. know as Adrian, answers <br />
the door. “Yes? How can I help you?”, he asks.<br />
<br />
“Yo Adrian, this here mah &quot;unck&quot;,” answers Lester as he pats Rock on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Hm? Oh right! Yes. Come on in, hon.” Adrian motions them in. “Please, this way.” Once they enter, Adrian <br />
immediately begins to lead the three downstairs, into the basement, and arrives at the hidden door C.J. <br />
remembers from before. The effeminate man then pulls out a large oddly looking book from a shelf nearby, opens <br />
it to a page, and then places his palm on that same page.<br />
<br />
“Recognition. Confirmed,” abruptly voiced a computer above. A loud click is heard, and then the walls before <br />
them slowly spread apart and reveals a long narrow corridor.<br />
<br />
Rock became uneasy as he looked ahead at the narrow corridor leading downwards. “Is Graham really down this <br />
way?” he asks Adrian in concern.<br />
<br />
“Of course, handsome. Please watch yourselves as we head down. It’s a little slippery.”<br />
Adrian continues onward and leads the posse down the corridor. After about a 2 to 3 minute walk they finally <br />
arrive at yet another security locked door. Adrian places his palm upon a nearby scanner, but this time he <br />
flinches a little.<br />
<br />
“Blood. And. Palm. Recognition. Confirmed,” voiced the same computer from above. The door slides upon and <br />
reveals a fairly empty but large room filled to the brim with cigar smoke. In the middle of the room sits: Mr. <br />
Allen Pryce, the stern Arctos agent; Mr. Tony Steel, the more rational Arctos agent; and Graham Maxwell, the <br />
owner of the establishment. Each is situated around a steel table rambling on about something, smoking cigars, <br />
and drinking a small cold glass of alchohol. However, Graham is the only one with reading glasses on and a <br />
newspaper in hand.<br />
<br />
“Hey, men! Guess who finally decide to show?” asks an enthused Adrian as he clutches Rock’s hand and pulls him <br />
forward.<br />
<br />
All eyes within the room are glued onto Rock; however, he could do nothing but stand amongst these older gents <br />
entirely paralyzed. His fear and anxiety creates a long drawn out silence throughout the room. In the midst of <br />
such dead air, Maxwell abruptly sets his cigar in an ashtray, drops his newspaper on the table, stands, and <br />
approaches Rock. “Well butter mah butt and call me a biscuit, if it ain’t mah new brother!,” the old man <br />
happily shouts as he pats Rock along the shoulder. “Keep still and let me get a good look at ya.” Maxwell <br />
takes no time and begins to size up the tall man.<br />
<br />
Tony sets his own Cigar into an ashtray. “[*Whistle] Looks like we’ve got a giant on our hands,” he comments <br />
before taking a sip of his drink.<br />
<br />
“Yessiree, and he’s mighty good-lookin’ ta boot!” replies Maxwell as he frisks Rock’s facial features with his <br />
hands. The old man leaves no corners unturned and carefully examines each area of Rock’s face. “Smile for me,” <br />
he demands and Rock immediately complies. After a long survey of Rock’s new but sullied dentition, a huge grin <br />
emerged from Maxwell’s wispy white beard and he lightly pats Rock’s cheeks. “Geez Louise boy, that tobaccah <br />
shure turned ya into one fine piece of work. No offense Lest’ boy, but it looks like mah new bro gon’ and <br />
copied all yer good features heheh.”<br />
<br />
Lester sighs. “Yeah, Pa… Seems that way. He be one lucky fella, that's fer shure. I ain’t ever seen someone <br />
turn out so primped after all that.”<br />
<br />
“Wait a minute,” interrupts C.J. as he steps forward. “What’s all this about a new brother and copied <br />
features? Don’t tell me this guy is another one of your “works”!<br />
<br />
Irritated and annoyed, Maxwell leers strongly at C.J; however, before a word could escape his mouth, Pryce <br />
stands and speaks up. “Let me handle this,” he suggests as he calmly sets his coffee on the table, and then <br />
proceeds towards C.J’s direction. “Come.” The austere man places his palm against C.J’s back and leads him out <br />
and into another room.<br />
<br />
As soon as the door closes, Maxwell fetches his cigar and returns to his examination of Rock. The old man <br />
couldn’t help but to play with Rock’s bigger and more outstretched ears. “Hmhm, yep - Ya rightly got the looks <br />
of a Maxwell I reckon; big ears and all.” After a shy smirk, Maxwell grips his cigar between his fingers and <br />
exhales a cloud of smoke through his mouth and towards Rock’s directiom.”Yer name’s Isaiah, ain’t it?”<br />
<br />
“[cough][cough] It wa-was… but [cough] I changed it just awhile ago.” Rock fans the smoke away and regains his <br />
composure. “My name is Rocky now, but you can call me Rock.”<br />
<br />
“Rocky Maxwell, eh?” Maxwell takes another long wig of his cigar. “Ghaha! Yeesss, that’s a fine name fer a big <br />
man like ya! Much better than that two-bit boy name ya used to have.”<br />
 <br />
“Yo, Graham,” Tony interrupts. “Are we gonna finish the prep work for his Transformation or not?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but first I need some alone time with big ol’ Rock here; y’know ta get to know him betters.”  Maxwell <br />
turns around and motions everyone to head out to the back room.<br />
<br />
“Oh sure! Take your time, Graham. We have all night to get him in gear,” replies Adrian as he exits. “Come <br />
along now, hon. There’s more I have to tell you about the cruise.”<br />
<br />
Tony sighs, clenches his ashtray and glass, and follows after his mate.<br />
<br />
Once they leave, Maxwell turns his attention towards his son. “You can stay if’n ya want, boy.”<br />
<br />
“That’s okay. You two have some real catchin' up to do. I don’t want to be a bother.” Lester heads toward the <br />
back room, but before he leaves he mentions, “I’ll be in the back helpin’ these two out.”<br />
<br />
Maxwell nods his head, and his son makes his leave and closes the door. With the room now clear, Maxwell <br />
hurries to each door to confirm they’re locked tight. Once finished, he proceeds to adjust a seat for Rock at <br />
the table. “Here Rock. Have a seat.” <br />
<br />
Rock stares nervously at the old man, but then slowly makes his way over and sits. Once he does, Maxwell <br />
places his cigar back into the ashtray and proceeds to a nearby coat rack where he removes and hangs his large <br />
white cowboy hat. Underneath the hat is a bald scalp with pure white hair horseshoed around the sides of it. <br />
The old man ushers out a deep sigh of relief as he rubs the sweat from his forehead. “It’s a little stuffy in <br />
here, I reckon,” he comments as he hangs his white suit and begins to undo his tie and dress shirt. As soon as <br />
Maxwell turns, Rock is greeted with a forest of white wispy body hair. The old man‘s chest and stomach hair is <br />
so vast that it’s difficult to see his aged skin. Maxwell dims the lights; heads to the table, and clutches <br />
his glass of alcohol. “You jus’ gon sit there scared or what? Git yerself comfortable, Rock. We’s gon be in <br />
here fer a bit,” he suggests as he refills his glass.<br />
<br />
“Um… Okay.” Rock scoots his seat closer to the table, and takes off his trucker cap. “Woah,” he yelps as he <br />
glimpses upon a fair amount of his hair wedge inside the cap. Rock rubs his head and witnesses more of his <br />
brown hair slowly falling from his scalp.<br />
<br />
“Yer hairline’s gettin’ thinner, boy,” mentions Maxwell as he returns with 2 glasses of alcohol. He sets them <br />
on the table next to Rock, and pulls up a seat of his own, deciding to sit just next to the hair-troubled man. <br />
“That’s a shure sign ya gonna end up comin’ bald like me.” <br />
<br />
Rock merely leers at Maxwell in response. The old man ushers in a sip from his glass and asks, “Ever had Irish <br />
whiskey before, boy?”<br />
<br />
“Uhh, does beer count?”<br />
<br />
“Haha, I’ll take that as a no.” Maxwell scoots Rock’s glass closer. “Here; don’t be shy and try a taste. Yer <br />
old enough now.”<br />
<br />
Rock hesitates, but takes a quick sip anyway. While the alcohol was quite strong, it was surprinsingly very <br />
pleasing to the taste buds. Although he wanted to take another sip, he was too nervous as Maxwell's strong <br />
glaring prevent him from doing so. A long silence crept way right afterwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;I reckon yer one of them quiet types, aintcha?&quot; asks the old man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh not really... Sorry. I'm just a little tense about all this still.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, don't be. We ain't gonna hurt ya. Though, I reckon ya might have some questions. I'll answer whatever ya <br />
want to tha best of my ability.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, okay.&quot; He takes a deep breath before asking. &quot;First of all, I've heard of the plan about you guys trying <br />
to make me some kind of boss around here; why? Me transforming is one thing, but becoming some kind of figure <br />
here to? That's a bit much, right?.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense. Out all the knuckleheads I've seen, ya seem to be the only one wit' enough guts to stand up against <br />
that dumb shithead of mine.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean Monty?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who else? I heard 'bouts how ya stood up fer ya friends and challenged that boy. Despite what I think of him, <br />
that takes some real show of spunk. Not even the bears here have enough heart in 'em to call him out. Ya might <br />
not realize, but alot of these shitheads here have that same high-n-mighty mindset. I hate remindin' these <br />
lugs time and time again whose the real dog in charge and it's taking its toll on me. It doesn't help that I'm <br />
startin' ta venture out from this place. It's my job to spread the Arctos name, and personally, I want to set <br />
up more Triple Crown Bars. I don't got the time to put up with these little games anymore, and I need someone <br />
with a good backbone to keep these shitheads in check.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why not Lester? Wouldn't he be better for something like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lester's too young. Ain't none of these bears gonna listen to someone who could be their son. 'Sides I rather <br />
not put such a mess on my boy like that. Of course at first I wasn't in hell gonna let a wimp like you take <br />
charge, but then I realized ya took some of that chaw and started to transform. Yer tha perfect candidate for <br />
what I want, and the folks at Arctos agrees. Ya weren't supposed to taste that chaw in tha first place; but <br />
with the way things turned out, it's the perfect setup to hide this little episode from the masses. Wouldn't <br />
ya agree?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I- I guess...&quot;<br />
<br />
Maxwell takes a chug of his own whiskey. &quot;Now I's got a question for ya. Are you seriously willin' to become <br />
one of the head honcho's here? Not only that, but you'll turn as old as me and rightfully become the daddy of <br />
that shithead, Vermont, since he's tha one that needs to be put in line the most. <br />
<br />
Rock grows quiet once again as he reevalutes his decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;'Course ya don't have to and all. We could very well just up n' leave ya like that, but yer gon' have ta find <br />
yer own way ta get by.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...That's okay. I've already thought it over and I've decided I'll go through with it. Y'know, I was <br />
seriously against it at first, but um... I uh... kinda would like to um... look. like. you,&quot; he adds while <br />
blushing. <br />
<br />
Maxwell makes a toothy grin and scratches his white wispy chest hair. &quot;Ah so ya like the way I look, eh? Haha, <br />
don't worry; it's only a matter o' time 'til ya inherit all of my kin's genes and be yer own polar bear, or a <br />
Silver daddy is what I like to call.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again, Rock couldn't believe how much he's looking forward into becoming an older man. Perhaps it's not <br />
the tobacco messing with his mind. In fact, it's possible that he truly wanted an oppurtunity like this to <br />
arise for the longest. &quot;Yeah, me... a Silver Daddy... I love the sound of that,&quot; he smiles as he rubs his own <br />
thick chest hair.  &quot;But y'know, how will you guys cover my transformation? My mom sure as heck wouldn't take <br />
it if I just disappeared on her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, we already got that covered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maxwell stays silent for a bit before speaking up. &quot;Mmgh, I'm not supposed ta say anything, but since I like <br />
ya and all, I guess it wouldn't hurt. Now don't get all upset, but... we gon' ahead and took some bum off the <br />
street and transformed him into ya old self.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!!?&quot; he shouts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now now, calm your britches bud. We thoroughly wiped all dem old memories of his and he fully believes he's <br />
you. He's already been sent &quot;home&quot; wit' that boy's pal not too long ago. Don't try worryin' 'bout it, Rock. <br />
For all intent and purposes, he's &quot;Isaiah&quot; now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite Maxwell's efforts, Rock's anxiety didn't let up. His former life is truly no longer his anymore. His <br />
old name, his family, his identity, everything is gone; and now he's fully stuck as this husky white redneck, <br />
Rocky Maxwell, for the rest of his life. The atmosphere is dead silent as he glares intently at the small <br />
glass of whiskey before him. Suddenly, he seizes it and downs the rest of it in one session. He then wipes his <br />
mouth with his arm and slams the glass on the table. &quot;Graham, no... brother, please... I N-NEED to finish this <br />
transformation. Do whatever it takes, but... I have to claim this as my new identity in life. It's... It's the <br />
only thing keeping me from going off the deep end.<br />
<br />
Maxwell sees his distress, moves in closer, and places his burly hand upon his shoulder.&quot;Settle down there, <br />
Rock. You'll rightly become part of my kin in due time.&quot; The old man then surveys Rock again as he rubs along <br />
his hairy shoulders. &quot;Know what, how 'bouts ya go ahead and unwind yerself, boy. Yer at home with yer family <br />
now.<br />
<br />
Maxwell then proceeds to help Rock take off his sleeveless shirt as Rock, himself, kicks off his sandles. As <br />
the old man tosses his shirt near the rack, Rock raises his glass and speaks up. &quot;Hey, bro. Gimme another <br />
swing of that whiskey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, as the old man happily abliges and refills his brother's glass as well as his own, the discussion <br />
between C.J. and Pryce goes on.<br />
<br />
&quot;So wait...&quot; interrogates C.J. &quot;Are you telling me that guy in there is really some hobo off the street?<br />
<br />
&quot;It's as I say,&quot; lies Pryce as he knows full well that the boy will not contain himself if he knows the truth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously, you guys are messed up...&quot; <br />
<br />
Pryce ignores the comment and asks, &quot;Now then, have you come to an adequate decision yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I have... I hate to do this, but I can't accept your offer. Even though I deeply care about [INSERT YOUR <br />
NAME HERE] , I simply can't throw everything away just to be with a former shell of himself. It's too selfish <br />
of me to do so.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a long silence, Pryce closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. &quot;I see...&quot; He then proceeds to remove his <br />
gloves. &quot;That's quite unfortunate to hear, young man.&quot;<br />
<br />
 A spine-chilling blue aura begins to emminate around the stern man's hands and C.J. immediately takes notice. <br />
&quot;Wh-what is that? What are you about to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pryce says nothing as he steadily approaches the teen. His silence causes C.J. to panic and quickly aim for <br />
the door. However, before he even makes a move Pryce shoots forward and effortlessly subdues him. Like a <br />
predator catching his prey, C.J. quickly falls unconcious onto the arms of Pryce. &quot;I'll adhere to your wish. <br />
Though, for your sake we have much more in store for you. You'll understand in due time.&quot; Immediately <br />
afterwards, a backlash of pain courses through Pryce's head causes him to seethe in agony. It was enough for <br />
him to almost drop C.J., but fortunately he recollects himself in time. Once fully recuperiated, he properly <br />
takes hold of the teen and carries him into the back via another entrance. Inside lies Cletus and Monty <br />
strapped on to stands, connected to a machine of sorts, and fully unconcious. Across the way are Adrian <br />
leaning against a wall pancuring his nails with a filer while Lester and Tony sit together at a computer <br />
monitoring the status of the confined two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Mr. Pryce sir,&quot; speaks up Adrian as he continues at his nails. &quot;I see's the lad's unconcious. I'm <br />
guessing his answer was no, hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The young man settled against the change. Thus, I had to take necessary measures.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's for the best, IMO,&quot; responds Tony. &quot;He would've been a fool if he had agreed; oh well. I've already <br />
tracked the kid's home address ahead of the time. I'll let our driver know what he has to do once he returns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's been a change in plans,&quot; replies Pryce as he moves towards Cletus's stand. &quot;Adrian; unstrap this boy <br />
here and make preperations for his return home. He's no longer needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing.&quot; Adrian puts away his filer and proceeds to follow his superiors order.<br />
<br />
Tony however skeptically glares at Pryce. &quot;What are you about to do, Allen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember Arctos's primary task, Anthony; we are to spread our bearish ideals to as many potential candidates <br />
as possible. I come to deem this young man as a acceptable suitor to our ways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!? Stop Allen! This goes against Arctos's directives! We can't force him to be a bear if he doesn't want <br />
to!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pryce pays no heed to Anthony's words and once Adrian removes Cletus, Pryce begins to set C.J. up in the <br />
stand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allen!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anthony!!&quot; roars Pryce much to everyone elses surprise. &quot;Have you forgotten your place!? You have no <br />
authority to defer my plans! Cease this disposition of yours or be terminated!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony rebounds back a little and grows quiet. After a brief period of silence, he rises from his chair and <br />
clutches his hands tightly. &quot;What the hell's gotten into you, huh...!? The Allen I know would NEVER challenge <br />
the company's regulations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have ya been living under a rock or sumthin'?&quot; chimes in Lester. &quot;This here lunatic has always been like <br />
that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...Nevertheless I can't condone such actions. I'm sorry, but I'll have to -,&quot;<br />
<br />
Without a moment's notice, Pryce halts what he's doing and dashes at Anthony; immediately slapping his palm <br />
against his forehead and putting him unconscious. <br />
<br />
&quot;TONY!!!&quot; Adrian drops Cletus like a ragdoll and rushes to his husband's aid. Lester could only turn his head <br />
away at the scene.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've placed a particular wedge within his self-conscious that will break down his mind at my command. If you <br />
don't want your husband to end up a vegetable for the rest of his days, then I suggest you not to contest my <br />
orders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You bastard...!!&quot; rages Adrian in a distinctively baritone and manly voice; quite different from the tone he <br />
usually portrays.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, please send that boy on his way to his vehicle. I'll come revive him once I finish the preparations <br />
here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian growls deeply, but complies as he has no other choice. He softly situates his husband, picks up Cletus, <br />
and carries him to the main door. There, he kicks it firmly and shouts for Maxwell to open it up. The door <br />
opens and before Maxwell could utter a word, Adrian trucks his way past him while grumbling furiously at the <br />
same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in tarnation is eating him?&quot; asks Maxwell as he scratches the side of his head. He then turns and finds <br />
Pryce about to collapse and clutching his head in pain. &quot;Woah!&quot; hollers the old man as he comes to his rescue. <br />
&quot;Keep it together now, ol' pal!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm... sorry...!&quot; mumbles Pryce before regaining composure. The sweat oozing from his forehead clearly <br />
exposes his ailment. &quot;It's getting worse. I'll be in need of a re-examination soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lester impedes and asks, &quot;Hey pa, ya finished wit' unck yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unck? Oh, Rock. Naw, I'm still chattin wit' 'im sum...,&quot; he responds as he catches Tony out cold on the <br />
floor. &quot;Say, what happened to him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He fell asleep,&quot; is all Pryce says on the matter as he shakes his head and returns to strapping C.J. Maxwell <br />
then catches wind of what the Arctos agent is doing and quickly heads back into the prior room and shuts the <br />
door before Rock takes notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is everything alright?&quot; asks Rock who is leaning back in his chair with his leg's crossed and is now holding <br />
a lit cigar given by Maxwell not too long ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep. Ain't nutin' ya need to worry 'bout,&quot; replies the old man as heads back to his seat. &quot;So how's that <br />
Cigar workin' out fer ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock takes a long drag of his cigar and exhales the smoke through his mouth. &quot;Ain't gonna lie bro, but this <br />
here one mighty fine stick of tobacco,&quot; he replies in a mock southern accent. He's beginning to take a shine <br />
to their rough manner of speech and tries to imitate it to the best of his ability.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good good. That's the domineering image I want ta see from ya. Looks like I made the right choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah; smokin' all day, drinking good whiskey, not to mention havin' a good fuck or 2 on the side. I can't <br />
wait.&quot; Rock smugfully reinserts his cigar and puffs away. <br />
<br />
Maxwell is estatic as he watches him get so acquaint with his lifestyle changes. He has no doubt that at this <br />
rate he'll fully satisfied his need as an Assistant Manager. With this, he wonders exactly how far he can <br />
&quot;convert&quot; him. &quot;Say, Rock,&quot; speaks up the old man. &quot;So far, how much do ya like us bears?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock takes this chance to sit up right and set his cigar in the nearby ashtray. &quot;Ha. Like? I fuckin' love gay <br />
bears; seeing how I'm one myself now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to hear! Y'know, I love being a gay bear myself so much so that I make it my job to sponsor and broaden <br />
our image. I have a proposition fer ya, once everythings said and done, I was wonderin' if'n ya like ta become <br />
part of Arctos and help promote beardom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock drops the fake accent and his eyes widen. &quot;Huh? Me a member of Arctos?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I stutter? Not only would ya help me run this joint per se, but ya could help stretch our subculture <br />
positively. Hmhm; maybe even secretly coerce some fellas into becoming bears themselves with the help of our <br />
&quot;special&quot; chaw. Hehehe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now wait a sec, Graham. That's going a bit too far. I have morals too, you know. I couldn't promote the same <br />
thing that sort of robbed me of my old life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Robbed? I reckoned that tobacco gave ya a fresh one, and then some. Don't tell me ya don't agree.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah... but still...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand. I ain't gonna pressure ya if'n ya don't won't. But just realize you'll have the power to save <br />
people from their old lives and give them new ones. You'll get the ability to let others experience the same <br />
glorious changes you underwent. Best of all, you'll be a hero to every man you help save, and probably get <br />
rewarded VERY dearly too, if'n ya know what I mean. Heheh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I admit, that all does sound nice. But I just can't... Though I can very well join Arctos and help you <br />
promote beardom in other justifyable means, if that's okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that's yer decision, then sure! I won't hold nothing against ya.&quot; Maxwell reaches his hand out for a <br />
shake. &quot;Here's to us bears and let us earnestly help promote our subculture together, brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock was thrown by surprise as this is the first time Graham called him his brother; a true part of the <br />
family. He became thrilled and smiles vivaciously as he firmly shakes his brothers hand. &quot;Yeah, lets show <br />
society how much pride we bears have!&quot; With this, Rock has become a member of Arctos and a full-fledged <br />
supporter of the bear subculture; just like Maxwell. As soon as he lets go, his mind loses touch with reality <br />
for a mere fraction of a second, as if he had some sort of epiphany, and leaves him completely in shock. <br />
&quot;Woah!&quot; he shouts. <br />
<br />
&quot;You okay, bud?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rock rubs his eyes to make sure he's okay. &quot;Yeah... My eyes just wigged there for a quick second. Don't know <br />
what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... I think it's high time we continue on wit yer transformation,&quot; suggests Maxwell as he rises from his <br />
chair. &quot;Ya ready to become an old fart like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya damn right I am, bro!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ghaha! Now that's the spirit, Rock! C'mon, let's git at it!&quot;</p>
