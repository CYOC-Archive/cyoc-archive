<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ethan headed towards the bathroom he heard his phone ringing in the pockets of his discarded pants. Removing it Ethan saw on the caller ID that Chance was calling him. Ethan answered the phone.<br />
&quot;Hello. Chance?&quot; he said.<br />
&quot;Ethan!&quot; Chance replied, &quot;you finally answered I&#39;ve been trying to get a hold of you. Listen this might sound weird, but has anything strange happened to you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Like transforming into a satyr?&quot; asked Ethan.<br />
&quot;So it did happen?&quot; said Chance. <br />
&quot;Yeah, not that long ago,&quot; replied Ethan, &quot;I assume you and JJ are in a similar state?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; stated Chance, &quot;that definitely confirms it was the wine that caused this then. No doubt about it. Where are you now?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m at Sarah&#39;s place.&quot;<br />
&quot;Did she see you transform?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah she did. It kind of freaked her out, but she&#39;s sleeping now.&quot;<br />
&quot;She&#39;s sleeping?&quot; asked Chance quizzically.<br />
&quot;Uh..yeah,&quot; replied Ethan awkwardly, &quot;I kind of tired her out...&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh I see,&quot; said Chance, &quot;Anyway... JJ and I were planing to go see the woman who sold me the wine so we can figure this whole thing out. If I text you the address can you meet us there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Go out into public like this?&quot; asked Ethan.<br />
&quot;Yeah, JJ and I figured we could disguise ourselves with baggy clothing. Wearing shoes will probably be a little awkward, but it should be enough as long as we&#39;re careful. Besides the shop where I got the wine isn&#39;t too far from either of us.&quot;<br />
&quot;I guess I can make that work. Though I&#39;ll need a little bit of time to get cleaned up.&quot;<br />
&quot;No worries, so do we.  Let&#39;s try to meet at the shop in an hour and a half.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sounds good see you then.&quot;<br />
<br />
An hour and half later a heavily clothed Chance and JJ were almost to the old lady&#39;s store when they picked up a sweet earthy scent like their own.<br />
&#39;That must be Ethan,&quot; said JJ, &quot;he&#39;s close.&quot;<br />
Sure enough just up ahead the duo spotted a heavily clothed figure the scent was emanating from close to the store front with his hood up. Chance and JJ approached the figure who quickly took note of them and waved in greeting.<br />
&quot;Sarah didn&#39;t come with you?&quot; asked Chance.<br />
&quot;Uh no she was still asleep,&quot; said Ethan, &quot;so I left her a note explaining where I was going and left.&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you have any trouble getting here?&quot; asked JJ.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; replied Ethan itching at his baggy pants, &quot;just the discomfort of all these clothes. I&#39;m sweating buckets in this get-up. I just showered and feel like I need another one.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think we all feel that way,&quot; said JJ.<br />
&quot;Then we probably shouldn&#39;t waste anymore time and head on in,&quot; said Chance.<br />
The three disguised satyrs opened the door and made their way into the old shop. The trio headed towards the counter where the old woman was reading a magazine. She took note of them and a smile spread across her face.<br />
&quot;I was hoping I&#39;d see you again,&quot; she said.  <br />
Before any of the young men could say anything the old woman was waving them to follow her towards a door at the back of the store.<br />
&quot;This way boys,&quot; she said. The old woman opened the door revealing a set of stairs to a basement. &quot;Head down there and feel free to get out of that ridiculous get-up.Everything will be explained to you.&quot;<br />
Chance led the way down the stairs which opened up to a comfortable sized room. Chance thought he could smell a scent similar to his own somewhere nearby but before he could take proper note of it he became distracted when Ethan and JJ shed their uncomfortable disguises causing their sweaty bodies to fill the room with their scents. Chance followed suit and shed his own disguise. Chance looked at Ethan and saw for the first time how his friends body had changed.<br />
&quot;You look good dude,&quot; said JJ, &quot;those goat legs suit you.&quot;<br />
&#39;Thanks,&quot; said Ethan, &quot;you guys don&#39;t look too bad yourselves. You guys also smell amazing.&quot; Ethan closed his eyes and took a deep breath of their collective scents in.<br />
&quot;Be careful of that scent,&quot; said JJ smiling, &quot;it kinda drives our lust crazy. Just ask Chance. We made a serious mess of the house.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait you two...&quot; Before Ethan could finish his sentence a door opened the three young satyrs turned expecting to see the old woman. Instead they saw a fourth satyr enter the room. He had a muscular build, tan skin, and dark hair colored similarly to Ethan&#39;s. This satyr was also different in that his upper-body hair was more fur like in places. His face stood out the most to the three young satyrs. While his features appeared as those of someone close to their age his face bore a wide goatish nose that was covered in hair. He also possessed a pair of horns much larger than the nubs of the young satyrs that curved back towards his ears.  As he entered his scent came with him. It was stronger and earthier than any of the young satyrs. All three found the scent hard to resist. <br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; the newly entered satyr said politely, &quot;so you three are the ones who drank father&#39;s wine. I&#39;m so very glad to meet you.&quot; <br />
The satyr excitedly walked up to each of the three and gave them a each a long sniff. <br />
&quot;Uh, who are you?&quot; asked a surprised Ethan.<br />
&quot;My name is Alex,&quot; he replied, &quot;I&#39;m king of the satyrs.&quot;<br />
&quot;king of the satyrs?&quot; asked Chance.<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; replied Alex, &quot;when my father died 160 years ago I became the next king of the satyrs.&quot;<br />
&quot;160 years ago?,&quot; asked a confused JJ, &quot;But didn&#39;t you say your father made the wine that turned us into this? He made it over 160 years ago?&quot;<br />
&quot;Indeed he did,&quot; said Alex as he continued to examine the three young satyrs, &quot;I was just a young kid then, we satyrs live a very long time. The wine he made was his last effort to bring more satyrs into the world. Instead of being born through standard means we could turn humans into satyrs with the wine. Unfortunately, it was not as successful as he hoped. The wine appeared only to turn a very small percentage of those who imbibed it into a satyr. For three of you two turn at the same time is unheard of. That&#39;s why I came personally to welcome you into our realm.&quot;<br />
&quot;This basement is your realm?&quot; asked Chance.<br />
Alex smiled and replied, &quot;No young one, merely a gateway. You&#39;ll see.&quot; <br />
The older satyr then tapped one of his hooves on the floor a couple of times and the whole room suddenly became bathed in a blinding light. Chance felt a burst of fresh air hit him, and when he could see again he saw that the room around them had disappeared and the four satyrs now stood in a beautiful large woodland meadow. <br />
&quot;Welcome to the hidden realm of the Satyrs,&quot; said an ecstatic Alex, &quot;now follow me.&quot;</p>
