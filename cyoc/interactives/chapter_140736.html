<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty nodded the brunette&#39;s head. &quot;Fine, but make it subtle,&quot; he made her say, as if she were asking for it.<br />
<br />
He decided he would give her one subtle little change for her to discover later. He focused and felt the change happen. Then, he felt satisfied that the time had come to let her go. He felt a bit giddy as he anticipated the experience to come. This was going to be great.<br />
<br />
He relaxed his mind and felt control of her body slip away back to her as he had done before. Only this time, he did not leave her body. She started to move, and immediately he felt the strange sensation of being in a body out of his control. She let out a bit of a groan as she looked around. To Ty, it felt as though he was her body and she was moving him around. It was his mouth that had groaned at her command. It was his head that was turning side to side when she willed it. It was surprisingly relaxing to exist without having to be in control of anything, as if she were carrying him around in the palm of her hand.<br />
She gasped as she noticed her nudity at last. Inside, Ty smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; she said as she covered up her breasts and crotch with her arms. Ty could feel her sweat damp arms pressing into her nipples. It felt good. She looked around and whispered, &quot;Where are my clothes? Where the fuck am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
She noticed the bracelet on her wrist with the key. &quot;That&#39;s... a locker key,&quot; she whispered and paused a moment to remember where she had seen that key before. &quot;That&#39;s from the changing room at the beach. I&#39;m at the beach. How the hell did I get to the beach?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, she froze as she heard a pair of voices approaching, one male and one female, a young couple looking for some private time under the old pier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; she whispered and then stood up, still covering her chest and crotch with her arms and quickly walked away from the couple approaching her. As she reached the end of the pier&#39;s shadow she paused a moment to get her bearings. Ty felt her squint her eyes in the bright sunlight as she searched for the changing room. Then, she spotted it. &quot;There it is,&quot; she said and groaned as she realized it was at least a quarter mile away and there was a large crowd of beach goers between her and her destination.<br />
<br />
The voices behind her grew louder. She turned her head to see a teen couple just stepping into the shadow of the pier. Realizing her time was up, she ran.<br />
<br />
But, not towards the changing room. Instead, she ran straight into the water. The coolness of it shocked her and Ty felt her tense up before relaxing into the gentle waves. She waded into it until she stood neck deep and considered her options. For the moment, the water hid her nudity. That was good, but she couldn&#39;t wade in there forever. She had to get to the locker where she hoped to find her clothes. &quot;Maybe I could wait until it gets dark after everyone goes home,&quot; she said. &quot;What if I black out again?&quot; she replied to herself. She looked around for other options, but she could find no other ways out. &quot;Fuck,&quot; she said, and began swimming toward the changing room.<br />
<br />
She tried to keep her distance from the shore, out where the water was still too deep for her to stand. There were no people at this depth besides her, but she could feel herself getting more and more tired as she swam. She was not a bad swimmer, but she was out of practice, and this would be a long way to go. Something splashed in the water near her and she paused to see a foam football floating next to her. Someone shouted, &quot;Hey, could you toss that to us?&quot; She ignored the voice and swam away even faster. Her body was burning from the effort, now, and her limbs were running out of strength. She treaded water for a moment to look for the changing room. It was still much further down the beach, but she could not go any further. &quot;Now,&quot; she told herself and swam to the shore.<br />
<br />
When the water was shallow enough for her to stand again, her arms returned to her chest and crotch. She focused all her attention on the changing room, consciously ignoring ever other person around her. She tried to imagine herself in her own private world with no one else in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; some guy said, piercing the boundary of her world. &quot;Is she naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude!&quot; replied another guy. &quot;Check out that ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was out of the water now, and walking rapidly on the hot sand. Ty could feel her face blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy?&quot; said some little kid. &quot;Why&#39;s she not in a swimsuit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t look at her,&quot; said a woman, probably the kid&#39;s mother. &quot;Where are the lifeguards?&quot;<br />
<br />
She kept walking. Sand clung to her feet and ankles. Her hair had fallen down and now stuck to her skin around her neck. &quot;Come on,&quot; she muttered to herself. &quot;Almost there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; someone said. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My bathing suit,&quot; she said, making up a quick lie without slowing down. &quot;I lost it. Someone pulled it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was almost there. Her feet stepped up onto hot concrete, and she quickly tip toed towards the changing room. The door opened and she nearly knocked over a teen girl stepping out of it. &quot;&#39;Scuse me,&quot; she said as she slipped into the darkness of the changing room. Panting, she looked for a place to hide for a minute, and found a bathroom stall. She entered it, shut the door behind her, and let out a heavy sigh of relief. She was safe at last.<br />
<br />
She took a few minutes to calm down as she waited to see if anyone had followed her into the changing room. When it became clear there would be no one knocking on the door, she let herself relax. She took off the locker key from her wrist and read the number on it. Then, she cracked open the door of her stall and looked for the locker. When she spotted it, she left the stall and walked to the locker, ignoring everyone else around her. Once more, she was trying to act as if she were in her own private world.<br />
<br />
The key fit the lock and the door opened, revealing her clothes and sandals stuffed inside. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said as she pulled them out and stepped back. Then, she saw a single dollar bill float down to the floor. She clutched her clothes to her chest with one arm and  crouched down to pick up the dollar as the locker door slammed shut.<br />
<br />
She saw the writing on the dollar, read it, and gasped.<br />
<br />
It said...</p>
