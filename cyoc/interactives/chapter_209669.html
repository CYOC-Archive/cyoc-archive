<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">But it wasn´t long before something else started, breaking his attempt to distract himself with his computer.<br />
Until around then, his mouth had simply felt dry, maybe a bit like a crust had formed over his skin, and no amount of drinking seemed to help against it. It remained feeling dry even if he had water inside his mouth.<br />
All of the sudden to Dan, something changed with that. His mouth was forced open by an invisible object entering his mouth, quickly hitting the back of it, making him gag out of reflex. Dan tried to grab whatever was inside his mouth, but his fingers went into the “filled” space without any resistance, as there was simply nothing. And then, he felt like something was rubbing all over the skin of his mouth, rubbing over whatever invisible object was inside.<br />
Panicking about this, Dan sprung up from his chair and run over to the bathroom, using the mirror to inspect his open mouth. Like with his fingers feeling nothing inside, his view in the mirror was the same. From the mirror, all he could see was himself, with his mouth hanging wide open, but no sign of whatever was pushing into it.<br />
“Whaaa teee heeeelll?” Dan exclaimed, sounding mumbled by not being able to move his mouth according to what he tried to say. He sounded like he was at the dentists and had his mouth numbed. Whatever this was, it was worse than simply feeling dry.<br />
Dan could tell that the rubbing only got more intense and faster, and any try of him to touch the inside of his mouth did nothing to that, he couldn´t even feel his own touch there.<br />
And then, suddenly, the rubbing stopped, but not before his mouth felt suddenly rather wet and sticky. Dan´s eyes went wide, but whatever this fluid was, he didn´t taste anything from it, even when it “covered” his whole mouth. The thing inside his mouth left, and he was finally able to close his mouth again. He tried washing his mouth, but it didn´t change his wet and sticky feeling, like before it hadn´t changed the dryness.<br />
A light pressure was applied afterwards, something he hadn´t even noticed before, as it wasn´t painful or anything, just light pressure. It took some time, but after Dan returned back to his computer, not being able to change the feeling inside his mouth, it again turned dry, only increasing the feeling of crusty skin he couldn´t reach.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a few blocks over, Harry had just used his hidden masturbation sock for that very thing, and put it back now that he had finished with it, enjoying the afterglow. Not knowing that he had just “used” his best friend Dan´s mouth through the sock. It wasn´t a sex toy, but it was connected to the word sex, as well as used in a sexual way, having been enough to make it a target for Kat´s spell on Dan. And as Dan had just sat above it the day before, hidden just under the mattress, it had triggered a connection there.<br />
<br />
Dan still had no idea what exactly happened back there, and beside the switching from being sucked on his thumbs to shortly being sucked on his big toes, he didn´t feel anything unusual for a few hours. It was making him nervous, but as long as he had no idea what caused this, he couldn´t do anything. He had a vague idea it could be Kat´s doing, but as he tried to dismiss magic being real, as he hadn´t seen anything from Kat, only felt the shiver run down his back, he didn´t ask her about it.<br />
<br />
Kat, for her part, was a bit disappointed. She hadn´t noticed any change in Dan, having missed his run to the bathroom before, and the rest, well, Dan hid well enough. Had her spell not worked? But on the other side, if what she thought he was connected to was right, then it could simply be not used until now. After all, her boyfriend used his toy only before going to bed, if she wasn´t around for him to get relief. And it was still too early for him to go to sleep.<br />
Dan sighed a few times through dinner while eating, but Kat didn´t connect it to him not tasting anything. To him, he could be eating anything, he would still just feel his mouth being dry and crusty, no taste registered. He yelped once, looking down at his right thumb, but nothing more. Kat had no idea what that was about, a thumb shouldn’t be connected to a sex toy in her mind.<br />
<br />
That it wasn´t a sex toy didn´t cross her mind. Dan had touched the pacifiers of the twins from Harry´s aunt Lisa, and as “sucking” was to him connected to sucking a cock, not that he ever did that, it had applied to Kat´s spell.<br />
Jasmin´s pacifier was connected to Dan´s right thumb, and when through dinner he had yelped, she had just spit it out, with it landing on the ground and rolling around the rough surface.<br />
Jeremy´s pacifier was connected to his left thumb, but that pacifier had remained safe in the baby´s mouth.<br />
What Dan also had touched were the baby’s bottles, and their tip was connected to Dan´s big toes, under the same reason as the pacifiers themselves had been.<br />
<br />
Later, when Dan went to bed, he still couldn´t figure out what was wrong with him. He slowly drifted to sleep, only to suddenly becoming wide awake. Something was pushing in his asshole, something similar to his mouth earlier. He yelped, as whatever it was, was bigger than his tight hole, stretching it painfully. Dan tried to grab it, but like before, there wasn´t anything to grab.<br />
Unlike with his mouth, Dan didn´t feel something rubbing over his skin. Instead, he felt repeating beats into it, each time making him yelp. That yelping did only stop as suddenly, his mouth was closed shut, and no amount of trying got it back open, not that he could focus on that while his ass was repeatably pushed into. And it didn´t let up for a good five minutes, making Dan cry silent tears from the pain.<br />
When it stopped, he still couldn´t open his mouth, and while he felt the wetness inside his asshole, like with his mouth there was nothing leaking out. A few minutes later, he would have screamed again, if his mouth had been able to open. It felt like his ass had been set on fire, followed by rough rubbing inside, making Dan sob in silent pain. It took time to calm down again, and Dan cried himself to sleep, not knowing what happened.<br />
<br />
Max had just used his fleshlight, pounding it rather hard for a few minutes. After calming a bit, he had quickly flushed it under boiling hot water before rubbing its insides over with a rough cloth, making sure it was clean before heading to bed, smiling at his relieved pressure.<br />
<br />
Harry had just gone to bed and rolled onto his side, facing the door while deep asleep already. He pressed all his weight down onto his masturbation sock through the mattress. And for most of the night, while still turning around, he remained on that side, meaning it kept being pressed flat by him most of the night.<br />
<br />
When Dan woke up the next morning, he whimpered in pain still produced by his ass, still being sore from the treatment it got. At least he could open his mouth again, and he slowly got into the bathroom to look himself over. He couldn´t see any sign of his ass being used for anything, it was as if all this had only been his imagination. If not for the pain still present, Dan would think it was just a really bad dream.<br />
<br />
Kat grinned when she saw Dan´s sore form, quickly connecting the dots on that. She had been right, Dan´s body was connected to her boyfriend´s fleshlight, and the way Dan hold himself meant it was his ass being pounded by him. She schooled her face when Dan turned towards her, acting ignorant to his pain while laughing on the inside. She also spotted the tent in her brother´s jeans, and really had to keep her laughter in. Had being used aroused him so much he still had a boner down there? She didn´t realized that his cock wouldn´t go down anytime soon, as it was also connected to a toy, more precise the dildo she had gotten yesterday from her friend, and as it couldn´t be deflated, Dan´s cock would be at full mast for as long as the spell was active, without any way to release the pressure down there for him.</p>
