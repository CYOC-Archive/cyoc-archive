<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa settled quietly into the passenger seat beside Trevor in his truck as they prepared to head out. Her purse with the prescription of werecow birth control pills were in it, for a just in case measure. The idea that teenage weres would go into the woods behind the high school to have sex seemed to fit in with much of what Melissa had already learned, both from talking with Trevor and the friends she&#39;d made at school and from the book that Megumi had loaned to her. Weres in general had a higher libido than normal humans and those that were romantically involved with each other seemed be easily eager to engage in that sort of thing. Her father&#39;s present adventures with Virginia actually did more than what even the book could explain, as she did remember hearing two pleasure filled roars come out of the woods behind her own home the previous night seemed to indicate the same.<br />
<br />
However, from what Melissa had also seen, was that despite a higher libido, weres did retain control over themselves. She and Trevor had had plenty of close calls in which their relationship seemed to progress by leaps and bounds that went beyond what she&#39;d ever had before. Now, granted, she didn&#39;t have all that much in the way of dating experience before coming to Moon Lake, but from what little experience she had with Trevor, she knew that if he couldn&#39;t control his libido, their close calls wouldn&#39;t have been close calls. If Trevor couldn&#39;t control himself, their first real passionate kiss on Tyson&#39;s driveway would have gone beyond heavy petting  and she would have found herself turning into a werecow, and potentially a pregnant one, before she&#39;d ever made her decision on what were to be. If Trevor didn&#39;t have control of himself, they would have had sex right there on the stairs of the Jenkins home because of all the pheromones that her father and Virginia had put out over the course of the day and evening and the sound of their resumed romp outside being heard inside the Jenkins home. But Trevor DID control himself, and despite some initial fears that he might not have found her desirable, the fact that he was able to control himself was something of a plus and made Melissa like Trevor more.<br />
<br />
In that, she trusted Trevor to be romantic and &quot;proper&quot; when it came to their first time, like he promised. Melissa didn&#39;t know when that would be, but she would remain  prepared for when it DID come. A part of her figured it would also have the potential to be &quot;soon,&quot; given some of their close calls they&#39;d already had and the fact that a part of Melissa even had the hope that it would be &quot;soon.&quot; However, she would let things develop properly and let Trevor assure her that he loved her before things between them moved to the next level.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you want to do for lunch?&quot; Trevor asked as started the engine and backed up, &quot;we have a Burger King out on the west end of town and a small diner downtown if you want to go out to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I think I can go and meet your dad and your brother and sister, if it isn&#39;t an intrusion,&quot; Melissa looked to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t be an intrusion,&quot; Trevor assured her and he backed up and they were soon on their way, &quot;In fact my sister wanted to meet you last night. I think she thought that the date was set up specifically to transform you and was hoping for meeting the &quot;new&quot; you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m more than happy to meet her, but for the moment, she&#39;ll have to get used to the &quot;old&quot; me,&quot; Melissa chuckled.<br />
<br />
Trevor only chuckled in response and drove along. It wasn&#39;t too long before they came up to the Tyson home. Things hadn&#39;t changed since Melissa&#39;s last visit and she soon followed Trevor toward the front door. A part of her mind was still privately pondering over the dreams she&#39;d been having since coming to Moon Lake and the fact that she was frequently seeing this image of either herself or her mother when she was younger, but for the moment that was on the back burner. Trevor had been polite and a part of her was hoping for a friendly visit with the rest of his family.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m back,&quot; Trevor announced as he came in through the door and then lead Melissa toward the kitchen/dining room area, &quot;and Melissa agreed to have lunch here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa heard a chorus of awed voices as she entered to find the rest of the Tyson family present. Seated around the table were Clint and Anna Bell seated closest to the doorway that she and Trevor had come through. To Anna Bell&#39;s left sat her mother Irma Tyson and then to her left was the Tyson family&#39;s patriarch Jacob Tyson. They all looked up to see Melissa standing beside Trevor, and she soon noticed that Anna Bell&#39;s lips pulling into a smile, though it was Jacob Tyson who soon took her attention. He stood up from his chair and approached both her and Trevor. As he approached, she could see that he stood a good foot taller than Trevor did, his shoulders were broader, and while he was wearing a comfortable pair of jeans and a tee-shirt, she could easily tell that his musculature was far larger than Trevor&#39;s. The part of her that was finding Trevor physically attractive and desirable was soon fantasizing over the fact that Trevor wasn&#39;t fully mature, which could well mean he grow bigger by the time he reached the age of eighteen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Miss Jenkins, I&#39;m Trevor&#39;s father, Jacob,&quot; Jacob spoke politely and with a level of gentleness that Melissa had often heard in Trevor&#39;s voice when he spoke to her, &quot;I hope things are going well... and that Moon Lake isn&#39;t giving you too many surprises.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... there were plenty of surprises,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;but I think my dad and I are both adjusting... my dad especially so right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He and Ms. McCoy are not on bad terms?&quot; Irma asked from her seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Far from it,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;they&#39;re engaged.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob and Irma traded glances and smiles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Moon Lake&#39;s magic seems to keep working,&quot; Jacob chuckled with a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;The town has magic?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can feel that way,&quot; Jacob answered, &quot;some of it is related to how certain weres are... or the fact that we weres are more easily aroused than normal humans... but there are times when it just seems like love easily triumphs here. There isn&#39;t much that would confirm the how... but it just seems to happen. Love triumphs and no one can explain it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa glanced over to Trevor as Jacob said that. She couldn&#39;t really explain it, either, but her own attraction to Trevor seemed to go the same way. The two of them had gotten along quite well and things just seemed to in a way that seemed to draw the two of them together. It wasn&#39;t something that Melissa could explain, but at the same time, she couldn&#39;t really see her self wanting to stop it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a bad thing,&quot; Melissa eventually said to Trevor&#39;s father.<br />
<br />
Jacob Tyson smiled at at that, &quot;So... what do you to have planned for today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly putting some costume ideas for the Halloween dance,&quot; Melissa answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Jacob replied, &quot;Well... hopefully there is something the two of you can put together if you&#39;re putting a costume together, if you want to wear a costume. The Halloween Dance is always fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Jacob moved back to his seat while Trevor pulled out the seat between Jacob and Clint and offered it to Melissa. Melissa sat down, and while Trevor moved to go make some sandwiches to offer for lunch, she turned to Clint and Anna Bell. Clint did look fairly strong, but in many ways he looked more like what one would expect from young man who hadn&#39;t reached puberty but scaled up toward a slightly larger frame. Anna Bell looked to be built closer to how Melissa was presently built, but with a bit more obvious muscle tone and broader shoulders for a girl, and otherwise looked to be in the early stages of puberty, which made sense as Trevor had told her that Anna Bell was getting close to her fourteenth birthday and likely when she&#39;d have her first transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you two must be Anna Bell and Clint,&quot; Melissa said to them, &quot;Trevor&#39;s told me a lot about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s told a lot about you two,&quot; Anna Bell spoke up, &quot;he said you were pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa felt herself blush at that as Anna Bell continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;He also said you were nice,&quot; Anna Bell added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like to think that I am,&quot; Melissa answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you want to be with Trevor?&quot; Clint asked, &quot;In EVERY way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I suppose,&quot; Melissa answered, looking a bit flushed, &quot;though it&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to rush him into anything. I&#39;d like our first time together to be something of a true romantic moment. Especially that since my dad became a weretiger, he&#39;s fulfilled the city&#39;s mandatory were law. There is no pressure on me to become a were. So... if and when Trevor get to that point... it&#39;ll be a loving moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you did with dad, right, mom?&quot; Anna Bell said to Irma.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would look that way,&quot; Irma said back to her daughter, &quot;which could well be another sort of situation where love&#39;s unexplained victories in Moon Lake carries the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna Bell nodded and then looked back to Melissa, &quot;Well... hopefully you and Trevor fall in love and join our herd, get married, and have lots of babies and be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa was glad she wasn&#39;t drinking anything when that was said. While a part of her was perhaps a bit eager to be with Trevor in every way, even that part of her wasn&#39;t quite ready for motherhood. Thankfully, though, it was Trevor who answered his sister as he returned with a couple of sandwiches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves, Anna Bell,&quot; Trevor spoke, &quot;Melissa and I still have high school to finish and then college.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have made Trevor happy, though,&quot; Clint commented, &quot;he sings your praises every evening at dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clint!&quot; Trevor protested clearly sounding embarrassed. Though that didn&#39;t stop Clint from continuing. Melissa even noticed a small smile as he spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably because a lot of the other girls that have had interest in him romantically have seemed to only have interest in one thing,&quot; Clint continued, &quot;and it wasn&#39;t his brains or his big heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;CLINT!&quot; Trevor protested again, making Melissa look over to see that he was blushing with embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Clint asked back, &quot;that&#39;s what you said...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That may be,&quot; Jacob cut in as he finished his lunch and stood up, &quot;but it&#39;s not something to bring up at lunch or with company. You don&#39;t want to drive her off, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Clint said slowly and from there the conversation was dropped.</p>
