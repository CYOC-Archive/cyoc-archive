<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the next 30 minutes Sam and Jordan swapped bodies. The changes were not so drastic for Sam as his earlier change. He remained female. He didn’t even need to get undressed. He lost height, going from about 5’10 to a diminutive 5’3. His hair turned dark brown and lengthened slightly. His breasts lost a couple of sizes as they shrank to B-cups. His voice changed somewhat as he became an exact copy of Jordan. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Jordan was changing in the opposite way. She gained height and turned blonde. She became the blonde woman that Sam had spent the last day as. From Sam’s new perspective she was an Amazon. Jordan had to remove her bra as her breasts swelled.<br />
<br />
“This wasn’t what I meant” complained Sam as the changes progressed.<br />
<br />
“But it was a good idea. I’m sure I will be so much better at flirting with Angus. It’s one of the aspects of the job that I actually really like”<br />
<br />
“So I am going to have to be you?”<br />
<br />
“Yep. It’s part of our bet. I get to choose the forms you will be in for this trip. I choose that for tonight you will be me”<br />
<br />
“But what if I am quizzed on the financials of the contract. I’ll make you look silly”<br />
<br />
“I have full confidence that you will behave very ladylike and not embarrass me. Besides this is a social evening, I doubt any details will be bought up that you are not already fully aware of. We’ve done the swap early enough that we can switch back before we go into the office for the signing tomorrow morning. If there are any issues they can be dealt with then” <br />
<br />
Just then the room phone rang. Jordan now ‘Samantha’ quickly answered. “Sure, we were expecting someone. Send her up”<br />
<br />
A couple of minutes later there was a knock on the door. Jordan answered and let in a tall blonde woman (at least she was tall from Sam’s perspective, although a fair bit shorter than ‘Samantha).<br />
<br />
“You must be Jordan. I’m Casey, Angus’s PA, we spoke on the phone”<br />
<br />
“Actually I’m Samantha. This is Jordan” the real Jordan said, while introducing Sam.<br />
<br />
“Well these are your gown’s for tonight” she had in her arms two dresses inside clear plastic bags. “The sizes match what you told me” she was looking at Sam, currently occupying the Jordan body.<br />
<br />
“Thank you” said the real Jordan, as she accepted the gowns.<br />
<br />
“Angus came with me to choose. He had in mind the black dress for Jordan and the purple dress for Samantha. He told me to wait and make sure they fit. However, at this late stage I doubt there is much we can do if they don’t”<br />
<br />
Jordan giggled at Casey’s comment. “Well we should try them on pronto I suppose” she said handing the black dress to Sam.<br />
<br />
Sam found himself banished into Jordan’s room with the black dress.<br />
<br />
He stripped out of the clothes he had been wearing all day including the now oversized bra. Quickly he located a black bra in Jordan’s suitcase and put it on. As he expected it was a much better fit although he suspected it was a push-up bra as it lifted his breasts and accentuated he otherwise miserly cleavage. <br />
<br />
He then removed the black dress from its plastic sheath. It was a gauzy material but seemed to have a built-in petticoat covering his torso. Same pulled it over his head and looked in the mirror. He was relieved to see that it looked as though he had correctly figured out what was the front and what was the back. He observed that the dress had a long vee under his neck and his cleavage was on show.<br />
<br />
He began to try and do up the back where there were buttons that were difficult to reach and what he guessed was a tie of some sort.<br />
From the other room he heard a woman call out in a sensuous voice. “How are you going in there Jordan? Does it fit? Casey needs to know”<br />
<br />
He realised it was the real Jordan doing the asking. That was the voice he had been using for the last day.<br />
<br />
“I’ll need help doing up the back. Can you spare a minute?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, just come out. We are all girls here”<br />
<br />
Sam left Jordan’s room. The first thing he noticed was ‘Samantha’ wearing a Chinese style dress. As always she looked stunning.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Nice! I love it!” ‘Samantha’ cooed as she appraised Sam. “You have done a great job Casey. These are perfect!”<br />
<br />
“Can you do up the back? I’m not sure how it all goes”<br />
<br />
‘Samantha’ was quick to move behind Sam and in no time had done Sam up. “I think you look great Jordan. You will be the belle of the ball”<br />
Sam moved across to see himself in the mirror. There was Jordan looking back at him. Jordan looking sexy in a black dress and showing off some very desirable cleavage.<br />
<br />
“Well if you two are happy I will get going” said the waiting Casey. You will need to finish getting ready and I haven’t left you much time”<br />
<br />
“Yes! We are very happy. Thank-you so much Casey. Do we owe you for these gowns?”<br />
<br />
“No. They are rentals though. Mr Henshaw has paid for them. Just arrange to get them returned”<br />
<br />
“We’ll do that. Thank-you so much” said Jordan as she saw Casey out.<br />
<br />
“So where are we actually going? Not just a restaurant I assume?” asked Sam<br />
<br />
“A fundraising ball for the homeless charity angus is involved with. Isn’t this dress just gorgeous. Its real silk” She was referring to her own dress.<br />
<br />
“You look hot” said Sam as he fully appraised the tall blonde. She was in a purple silk dress with pink and white flowers embroidered onto it. The dress had a split up the side which accentuated ‘Samantha’s ridiculously long legs. <br />
<br />
“You look hot yourself. It’s interesting to see yourself from someone else’s viewpoint. I’m really short and petite aren’t I?”<br />
<br />
“I know I certainly feel tiny”<br />
<br />
“Well you can see why I always wear heels. I think the black ones I was wearing today will work well for you. I’m going to wear my silver heels with this though”<br />
<br />
Sam thought that ‘Samantha’ didn’t really need to wear heels. She was tall enough without them. Was she just trying to rub it in as to how short Sam now was? Sam stopped that thought realising he was experiencing envy. Shouldn’t he be feeling lust around someone as stunning as ‘Samantha’. Sam was confused  <br />
<br />
‘I’m glad to see you switched bra’s, not that I would have let you go out wearing a white bra under a black dress. But that bra is a good choice. It makes it look like you have a bust”<br />
<br />
“This is your own body you are talking about” <br />
<br />
“Exactly. That’s why I’m going to fuss over every detail of your look”<br />
<br />
Sam soon found himself wearing a silver necklace of Jordan’s as well as the diamond stud earrings and finger rings Jordan had been wearing all day. “Samantha’ then restyled Sam’s long brown hair and touched up his make-up, before spending a similar amount of time on her own<br />
<br />
Sam was given Jordan’s handbag but ‘Samantha’ decided against the large black handbag Sam had been carrying around that morning, instead producing out a sequinned purse into which she packed her essentials for the night.<br />
<br />
The phone once more buzzed</p>
