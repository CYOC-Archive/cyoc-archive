<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The door to the bedroom flung open with a bang, neither of the two males noticing it very much as they were too busy devouring each other&#39;s mouths.  Jared couldn’t help but think that he had really chosen a good one tonight, he really knew what to do with his tongue and his hands were gripping his ass in just the right way.  Jared’s moans were quickly swallowed by the twink’s mouth, each one being responded by a squeeze to his ass and flick of his tongue.<br />
<br />
Jared had decided that tonight, just like many of his other frequent potential one-nighters, he would go with the other to his apartment.  Going to his own place would be too much potential commitment for the stripper, and until he was certain about his partner that was definitely off the table.<br />
<br />
Jared was drawn back to the present as the twink, Liam if he was remembering correctly, pressed into him.  He felt his knees hit the bed behind him and he fell on the bed, Liam pressed on top of him not stopping the makeout for even a second.  Liam pulled up Jared’s legs and used the room to pull down the shorts that the other was still wearing, revealing the eye-catching red g-string to the room.<br />
<br />
With a final suck to the tongue, Liam pulled away with lust-filled eyes, “Strip, but leave the string on.”  Jared felt a shiver go down his spine, moaning as he heard the demand.  Eagerly he complied, he was not expecting the thoroughly dominant behavior when he had first chosen the twink, but he sure as hell wasn’t complaining!  He rapidly removed his leather jacket and thin shirt that he had on, watching as Liam removed himself from the bed to take off his clothing.  <br />
<br />
Now don’t get him wrong, for all that Jared is a bit picky about who he sleeps with he doesn’t have it based entirely on physique.  Most of the time he will chat with his potential lay at the club before to see if they meet his standards.  That being said, Jared was literally so close to drooling as Liam stripped off his clothing revealing a lithe swimmer’s build that had been covered by his clothes.  The abs on him were just enough to draw his eye, and his eyes roved further down his body until he stopped breathing.  Jared had certainly not been expecting the giant package Liam was packing, one that was at least 11 inches and pointed straight at him.<br />
<br />
Liam kneeled back on the bed between Jared’s legs and leaned down to catch Jared’s lips again.  Jared was so distracted by the kiss that he was ignorant of the fact that Liam had grabbed a condom and a tube of lube from his bedside dresser.  He only became aware when he felt Liam reach down and move his string, eagerly putting two fingers in his hole and stretching.  It wasn’t long before Jared pulled away from the kiss moaning, “Please put it in.”  With a smirk, Liam was pushing into Jared’s tight hole within seconds.<br />
<br />
**************<br />
Blaine could honestly say that this was the worst experience that he had ever had.  Somehow being turned into a stripper’s g-string was beyond mortifying, but as the night went on and ending up in the bedroom with the two males.  Well let’s just say that Blaine was not going to be forgetting this experience anytime soon, no matter how much he wished for it.<br />
<br />
This fact was doubly sure when he felt Liam pull him out from between Jared’s ass, but not take him off completely.  He got to see up close and personal as the male began hammering his way into the hole in such a fast pace, all Blaine was able to hear were the slapping of balls against skin (and on himself but he was trying desperately to ignore that for as long as possible) and the loud moans from each of the males.  With each passing moment Blaine couldn’t help but want to cry and scream out, ‘It just isn’t fair!  Why am I stuck in this mess and not that nerd Malcolm!’<br />
<br />
It wasn’t long before Blaine felt the hard cock that he was still holding in the pouch begin to throb and twitch.  ‘Oh God.  Oh God!  Please no, anything but that!  For God’s sake Jared, take your freaking cock out now!’  Though just as expected his hopes of somehow wishing for it to happen were dashed.  With rapid thrusts Jared let out a loud cry, and into the pouch he exploded.  Shots and shots of cum were being plastered onto the inside of the pouch, and with each shot Blaine tasted more and more of the salty bitter fluid.  He could have gone his whole life without having known this taste.<br />
<br />
‘GLUCK! GLUCK!’ With each shot, Blaine felt like he was becoming drunk.  It was with great relief that he saw the black dots in his “vision.”  Within moments he was knocked unconscious, as Jared’s cumshots came to an end.<br />
<br />
**************<br />
Jared moaned as Liam slowly pulled out of his hole, leaving him with a remarkable empty feeling.  He panted as he watched Liam remove the condom, tying it and tossing it in the trash.  He smirked down at Jared, “So up for a second round?”<br />
<br />
Jared looked up into the blue eyes of the male above him.  ‘God, his stamina is great!’  He smirked in response and proceeded to widen his legs again, revealing his twitching hole.  Liam grabbed the box off the side table, pulling out another condom, and it began again.</p>
