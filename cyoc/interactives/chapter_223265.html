<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul was watching the girls lined up and holding the rail as they raised and held their left legs. Fortunately, or unfortunately depending which way you looked at it, his mother had made him take ballet lessons himself, until he had rebelled and quit several years ago. So at least he knew the basics. The girls seemed to be listening to him. The problem was that when he attempted to show how to raise a leg the seam at the back of his trousers split, quite audibly and all the girls gave a giggle.<br />
<br />
Just then the studio doors opened. Paul hoped it was his mother come back to rescue him or perhaps Mr Dawson, but it was one of the kid’s mothers. The woman looked puzzled to see a high school student supervising the class, but stood on the sidelines watching quietly as the girls in turn exhibited their skills. Over the next 5 minutes half a dozen mothers filed in. Paul was repeatedly disappointed. Eventually he made the decision to call the class to an end. <br />
<br />
Immediately the girls rushed over to their respective mothers. Paul heard one girl say. “Mrs Jones’s hair turned white and she left in a hurry. She must be really sick” This girl was not alone. He overheard all the girls telling of the dramas of the afternoon. Eventually the girls started to trickle out. Paul wondered where his mother and Mr Dawson were. <br />
<br />
Eventually his mother or was it Mr Dawson came in. It looked like his mother, a 40 years old woman now wearing a leotard and white stockings. However unless the two had swapped back this was Mr Dawson wearing his mother’s clothes. <br />
<br />
The woman made an announcement “Hello everyone. I apologise for what has happened. In case you didn’t know I had a bit of a turn but appear to have recovered. I can only thank young Chelsea here who stepped in and supervised the class when I was indisposed”<br />
<br />
The woman was besieged by well wishers and began answering the girls and women’s questions. Paul heard her say amongst other things that a make-up lesson would be put into place. Eventually the woman made her way across to Paul and said. “Mr Dawson says to go and see him in his office. He has something for you”<br />
<br />
Paul took the opportunity to flee the scene hoping his split pants were not observed.<br />
<br />
Paul made his way to Mr Dawson’s office and presumably his real mother. However, as he was about to enter the office he noticed Katie’s Mom coming through the front door and to his horror saw she was accompanied by Alex his lifelong friend and best mate. Without knocking, Paul quickly opened the office door and entered, closing it behind him. He did not want Alex to see him as he currently was!<br />
Inside he found Mr Dawson or was it his Mom?<br />
……….<br />
“Mr Dawson?” Paul asked tentatively<br />
<br />
“We have not had time to change back. I’m your mother Paul” the man’s gruff voice replied. <br />
<br />
“Then that was Mr Dawson in the leotard?”<br />
<br />
“Yes. Cute isn’t he?”<br />
<br />
“If you say so”<br />
<br />
“You are cute yourself”<br />
<br />
“Errgh….”<br />
<br />
“You can wear this” Mr Dawson picked up a shopping bag from the desk. “You’re lucky. I purchased it this morning and a bra as well. I was going to wear it next Saturday but I don’t think it will fit me at the moment”<br />
<br />
“Lucky?” Paul pondered the word as his male mother extracted a black dress with red roses on it from the bag and held it up so Paul could see.<br />
<br />
“I remembered I had it in the car. I think we are of roughly the same size”<br />
<br />
“Ah!.... It’s really nice Mom, but I’m not sure I’m ready for a dress” <br />
<br />
“Well you are too old to be wearing a school uniform. And your pants have split! Look at them! You look trampy”<br />
<br />
Paul blushed. Embarrassed that his mother had noticed the split. He decided to change the subject “Who am I exactly? You said something about me being an opera singer and Mr Dawson called me Chelsea”<br />
<br />
&quot;That’s right you appear to be Chelsea, she dropped in a couple of weeks ago for a dancing lesson. She’s a young opera singer and had a lead in the Die Fledermaus production. She came to me to refresh her dancing skills”<br />
<br />
“Does she have a surname? And how did I become her?”<br />
<br />
“I can’t answer either of those questions. All I know she was from interstate and someone had recommended my studio. She was only in town for three nights. Gary told me of your thoughts that it was your medallion that caused our changes. I’ve no better theory”<br />
<br />
“Oh gawd! It’s still sitting on top of my bag. I should retrieve it and see if it can change me back”<br />
<br />
But when Paul opened the door he quickly shut it again. Alex was outside apparently looking at Paul’s school bag. “I can’t go out there. Alex is there. I can’t let him see me like this”<br />
<br />
“Certainly not” his mother/come Mr Dawson agreed. “You need to change out of that school uniform and put the dress on. Alex will be wondering who you are. He will certainly know you are not a current student. You think of an explanation as to why you are wearing the uniform”<br />
<br />
Paul realised he was snookered. He could not go out there dressed as he was. He picked up the dress. Could he? He thought about Mr Dawson in his leotard. That would be more embarrassing he decided.<br />
<br />
His mother seemed to read his thoughts. “You have nothing to fear from wearing a dress. Alex will not recognise you. I’ll go and retrieve your bag. You change” She left</p>
