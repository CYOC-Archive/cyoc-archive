<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake Smith went to the bathroom and relieved himself, then looked in the mirror. He thought he looked different, but it was hard to pin point. Was he shorter? There was nothing specific he could think of, but still...something felt off, he couldn&#39;t put his finger on it. Maybe he was just half in dreamland still.<br />
<br />
He walked downstairs, feeling like he was forgetting something important. He shook it off and just went to the kitchen,opening the fringe for some milk. The cold air tickled his bare skin. There was something he had forgotten to do, Jake was sure of it. As he ate a quiet breakfast he tried to remember. He&#39;d done his homework. He hadn&#39;t made any plans with friends. Probably nothing important. He shrugged and got ready for the day. Packing his lunch and slipping on his backpack. The straps felt strange on his smooth, bare shoulders, but Jake couldn&#39;t think why.<br />
<br />
He stepped outside and began walking. The concrete felt really hot under his bare feet in the summer morning. He wondered why he was only noticing this now. But since it was still so early the air was a bit cool. The wind blew across his exposed body and made him shiver. Was it always so chilly going to class? This was even such a sunny day. He didn&#39;t understand what this nagging feeling was at the back of his mind. Part of him screaming for him to remember something vital.<br />
<br />
People on the street stared at him as he walked past. It made him blush. Was there something on his face? A car honked at him as it passed. Someone whistled from an open window of a house. An old lady at her mail box asked sternly, had he no shame. There was something going on.<br />
<br />
When he crossed into the courtyard of the school, all eyes were on him. Mouths hanging agape. Someone, Kyle Perkins, Jake realised, started laughing. Even pointing. Jake was getting very nervous. He tried to find somewhere he&#39;d draw less attention, but people were following him. Whispering to one another. Giggling.<br />
<br />
The bell rang and Jake couldn&#39;t wait to get into class. He hurried in, but found his desk had been moved. He recognized the characteristic chip off it&#39;s side, placed front and center of the class. Everyone got into the other seats as if this was the normal set up. But they all stared at Jake. Something was very wrong, but he could not think what it was.<br />
<br />
Jake sat down, missing his ignorable place at the back of the class. The texture of the wooden chair felt unfamiliar on his bare butt, but he was certain it was his usual chair. The aluminum legs of the desk were cold on his naked thighs.<br />
<br />
The teacher walked in and his eyes fell immediately onto Jake. Just like everyone else had. Jake fidgeted in his seat. What was everyone staring at him like that for!?<br />
<br />
The dozens of eyes taking note of every single detail on Jake’s body made the naked boy feel uncomfortable. The face of the boy was red with shame. He didn’t enjoy being the center of attention. Couldn’t class just start already? However the teacher was as astonished as all of his classmates, and Jake found himself confronting a very imposing silence.<br />
<br />
Wait! What if his fly was open?! Oh, the horror! He’d die now and then if all those menacing eyes were staring at his exposed underwear. Jake, trying his best to look casual, reached for his crotch under the table and casually scratched his pubic area. Mmm...He didn’t find a zipper at all. He must be wearing that pair of black trousers that didn’t have a fly.<br />
<br />
He liked those trousers. His mom and bought them for him the other day. They were very comfortable, and transpirable too. He could feel the chilly AC blowing on his legs. Jake had preferred trousers to shorts since puberty and modesty started kicking in. He hated shorts, they exposed too much skin and that made him feel vulnerable, and that made him get boners, which in turn made him feel even more ashamed.<br />
<br />
When Jake finished scratching his manhood under the table he realized the entire class was looking at him even more closely. What? What he had done now?<br />
<br />
The teacher, after clearing his throat nervously, finally managed to the break the silence when he told Jake to go see the school’s headmaster.<br />
<br />
Jake stood up from his seat, looking at his classmates ashamed. Being called to the headmaster could only mean bad news. The small boy with no clothes on stood up from his chair and slowly walked through the desks of his peers.<br />
<br />
Jake thought they must be embarrassed of having a classmate being called to the headmaster. They must think he was a delinquent of some sort. The naked boy felt so ashamed of himself as a student he didn’t mind his step and clumsily tripped when his bare foot made contact with another boy’s sneaker.<br />
<br />
Thankfully he hadn’t fallen to the floor. He had managed to put his arms over the teacher’s desk for support, so he hadn’t hurt himself.<br />
<br />
His classmates however would be scarred for life by the image of Jake’s eager buttocks presenting its virgin anus to them.<br />
<br />
As the boy left the class he wondered if his cheeks could get any redder. He could feel the shivering cold on his skin but his body temperature was blazing hot. He couldn’t stop sweating all over.<br />
<br />
Jake was about to enter the headmaster’s office when he saw a notice on the wall. It was a notice from the headmaster explaining the new nudity clause. “If a student were to show up naked at the school grounds during class hours, excepting the changing rooms at the gym, all of the student’s clothes will be confiscated for the remainder of the school year. The student will also be automatically inscribed on the state’s Nude List for a period of no less than a year, in accordance to the local laws.”<br />
<br />
Jake smirked. He knew of the Nude List, it was the result of a law that had been approved yesterday night. No problem with having criminals literally exposed to the public, that’d made them easier to spot. But he hadn’t heard of the school’s new nudity clause before, it was too hilariously stupid. Who in their right mind would show up during class completely naked? He couldn’t resist chuckling at the thought.<br />
<br />
He actually felt relaxed after thinking about someone actually being stupid enough to do such a thing.<br />
<br />
After taking a deep breath, he opened the door to the headmaster’s. The middle-aged man was apparently submerged in some paperwork, but he looked up at Jake with his piercing blue eyes the instant he entered.<br />
<br />
There was something off about those blue eyes. They shined intensely and looked at Jake like they were looking at the juiciest steak in the world.<br />
<br />
They made the boy feel kinda naked...</p>
