<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as Colin tried to slam the door shot, a familiar foot jammed into the opening. <br />
<br />
&quot;Michael, is that you?&quot; Colin asked quickly.<br />
&quot;Yes, YES! God, LET ME IN,&quot; Michael shouted in a panicky voice. Colin looked through the opening in the door and saw his brother looking terrified.<br />
&quot;Did they bite you or anything?&quot; Colin demanded.<br />
&quot;Wha--...no. No, I threw them off,&quot; Michael stammered, &quot;they just went back to fucking each other. Christ.&quot;<br />
The other guys in the room were beginning to freak out; some wanted Colin to leave Michael to the Speedo Men, some wanted Colin to let Michael in, but they all wanted a decision to be made. Now. Before the Speedo Men came for them.<br />
&quot;Alright, quick, IN!&quot; Colin yelled, widening the door to let his brother in. <br />
<br />
Michael dove into the bathroom. As he did so, a Speedo Man pounced right down the hallway passage, right where Michael had been standing only seconds earlier. The Speedo Man lunged back and forced his weight against the door. It creaked under the pressure of his bulging muscles. Colin and Michael hurriedly jammed their shoulders against the door as it rocked violently. Terrified shouts came from the men in the room, but this seemed to only excite their Speedo-clad assailant. A couple of the guys who had enough sense joined in holding the door down. With one tremendous effort, they managed to close the door. Colin quickly twisted the lock shut. He heard scuffling outside the door and moaning. He didn't even want to think about what could be going on out there.<br />
<br />
Finally safe, the men in the room dispersed slightly, breaking down into groups and sitting around the bathroom. It wasn't too cramped in there, but they certainly didn't have much room to move around in. They were mostly pretty quiet; none of them even wanted to talk about what was going on outside. A couple seemed to doze off on the floor, their drunken tiredness finally catching up with them. Colin followed Michael to the basin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man,&quot; Michael groaned as he filled up a cup next to the bathroom sink normally used for toothbrushes with water, &quot;I have got to get the taste of ass out of my mouth.&quot;<br />
&quot;Eurgh, you tasted his ass?&quot; Colin asked, eyeing Michael in disbelief. Michael began gargling.<br />
&quot;HEY, it's not like I wanted to,&quot; Michael said indignantly between spitting out mouthfuls of water, &quot;the thing was practically crammed into my mouth.&quot;<br />
Michael slammed the cup down next to the sink, his eyes downcast. His body seemed to be quivering a little. Colin figured he was mad.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Soooo...I just wanted to say sorry about before, man. I was gonna grab some help as quickly as possible.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Michael sighed, &quot;no harm done.&quot;<br />
Colin raised his hand to Michael so they could shake on his apology. Michael smiled and took his brother's hand. Colin, as he always did, jerked the arm forward as a joke so he could tickle under his brother's armpit. Time seemed to slow down in that moment. As Michael stumbled forwards, his t-shirt slid up slightly at his back. Colin gasped. There had been no mistaking that flash of red he saw in that moment that he saw in the bathroom mirror. The flash of red that could mean only one thing. Colin paused for a second, then carefully hugged his brother, looking in the bathroom mirror as he lifted Michael's shirt an inch or two, just to check for certain.<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; Colin thought as he spotted the red Speedo poking up from the back of Michael's jeans, &quot;They got him.&quot; <br />
<br />
Colin broke the hug slightly, placing his mouth next to Michael's ear.<br />
&quot;Michael,&quot; he whispered hurriedly to his brother, not wanting to scare the other guys, &quot;You've got a Speedo on.&quot;<br />
&quot;What are you tal- Oh...SHIT,&quot; Michael groaned quietly. It appeared he didn't even realise he'd been bitten.<br />
<br />
Colin saw as Michael discretely placed a hand on his crotch and adjust himself through his jeans, checking to see if he was actually wearing a Speedo. Colin and Michael eyed the room, no one else seemed to notice. Michael quickly lifted the front of his shirt slightly over the waist of his jeans. It was evident that his cock was swelling slightly, and distinct lines of a six pack were forming. The flab he had had earlier that day had completed faded away. And most damning, the bright red of the Speedo tightly stretched around Michael's crotch and ass was visibly poking out over his belt. Michael ran a finger along the front of the Speedo and began to play absent mindedly with the drawstring. He quickly pulled the shirt back down, looking extremely pale and sweaty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; Michael begged in a whisper, &quot;don't send me out there! I guess one of them gave me a little bite on my leg, but I didn't think that would matter! I don't want to become one of them! I promise you, I can fight it! PLEASE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin surveyed the room; no one else seemed to have noticed that his brother was wearing a Speedo. He felt bad about just tossing his brother back out there though, especially after having abandonned him the first time. It did look like his brother was getting a hard on though... But he did seem convinced he could fight the change off. Hell, maybe he could; there weren't any other Speedo Men in the room to fuck that might force his transformation. But did he want to risk transforming himself? What should he do?</p>
