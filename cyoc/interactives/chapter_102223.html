<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll stay, &quot; said Sam with sigh.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Excellent, &quot; said Stacy with a smile, as she pointed the flashlight at him.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Wait! What are you doing?&quot; said Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, if you are going to stay you need to play by the rules.  We won&#39;t do anything you don&#39;t want, but I get to change you however I want.  It&#39;s not big deal.  You can always just change yourself back tomorrow morning,&quot; said Stacy.<br />
<br />
Sam sighed.  It sounded fair, and he had come this far.  Might as well go all the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, fire away, &quot; said Sam.<br />
<br />
Sam bit his lip nervously as the low pink light bathed his upper body and head. His chest and abdomen became smaller, to match his small lower body. His skin became softer, and his body hair faded away. His waist narrowed, and his hips bulged out a little. Two small mounds protruded from his chest and grew to a modest A cup, bordering on a B cup. His hair remained short, but got softer and shaggier, resembling a pixie cut. His face became softer and less angular, with a cute button nose. The pink light shut off, and Sam went to look at himself in the mirror. He no longer looked male, but rather like a tomboy. He imagined this is what his ovaries would have caused him to look like with time. Stacy walked behind him, and placed her hands on his shoulders. She looked massive compared to him now. He couldn&#39;t have been more than five feet tall compared to her six feet or more. She examined his body in the mirror. Sam could feel her erection against his back, and he shivered a little.  She was obviously pleased with her work. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Hmmm, good but not perfect.  I think we need to make a few more adjustments &quot; said Stacy. <br />
<br />
&quot;More?  Haven&#39;t you done enough to me?&quot; said Sam.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?  This coming from the guy who gave an innocent girl a dick.  Listen, you can leave anytime you want. But if you stay, you have to let me change you how I want.  Just like you did to me.  Consider it a little poetic justice. At least I am asking for your permission, &quot; said Stacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, do it, &quot; said Sam, as he gritted his teeth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl, &quot; said Stacy, as she patted Sam on the shoulder.  She backed away from the mirror and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, Sam.  You are going to love this.  We are going to have a lot of fun tonight, &quot; said Stacy.<br />
<br />
Sam turned and saw Stacy fiddling with the controls.  <br />
<br />
What in the world is she doing now? thought Sam.  I am already a complete girl.  How much worse can it get?  She can&#39;t make me any more of a woman.<br />
<br />
Then suddenly he remembered the intensity settings.  He was about to protest when a very bright pink light shone on his head.<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s face became softer, and less angular. All of his facial hair disappeared. His short brown hair grew longer. His brain began to change. Suddenly, Stacy&#39;s dick didn&#39;t seem so repellant. In fact, it was kind of alluring.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Okay, that&#39;s enough,&quot; said Sam, as he tried to shake these strange thoughts out of his head.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Just a little more, &quot; said Stacy.  She adjusted the settings and the light suddenly shifted to an even brighter pink.<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s head continued to change. His hair grew longer and faded to a light blond. His lips puffed up, and his nose became smaller. His thoughts became more confused.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Stop, please,&quot; said Sam softly.  His voice was much higher, and more seductive. He placed his hands on his head. They began to change, too, becoming smaller. His fingers became thinner, with a finely manicured nail.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Just a little bit longer, baby.  You are going to look so beautiful, &quot; cooed Stacy.<br />
<br />
 Sam&#39;s hair grew longer, twisting into curls and locks. His eyes changed to a bright blue. His thoughts became more clear, and they focused one thing. Something he desperately wanted - no, something he had to have. Sex!<br />
<br />
 Sam launched himself towards Stacy. Stacy dropped the flashlight in shock, sending it clattering across the floor and finally turning off the light. At first, Stacy thought Sam was going to attack him. She wasn&#39;t too worried. She was much bigger than Sam now. <br />
<br />
But she was pleasantly surprised when Sam began to feverishly stroke her cock, cupping her balls and occasionally licking her dick. Her plan had worked.  When pointed at Sam&#39;s head, it changed his brain just like she had hoped. He  was now very heterosexual, and eager to play with her cock.  Just like she promised, she didn&#39;t make Sam do anything against his will.  He willingly wanted to have sex with Stacy now.<br />
 <br />
It didn&#39;t take long for Stacy to get fully erect.  She wasn&#39;t lying when she said that Sam had become very attractive. Sam began to work her cock into his mouth. Stacy couldn&#39;t wait to experience her first blow job.  She had many more things planned for Sam tonight.  Lots of different positions to try, but this was a good start.  It was going to be a fun night, indeed.</p>
