<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The idea for expanding Animalia Ambassadoria was approved and with that success, their group soon set about the means to expand the show. Sophie personally felt confident that it would be something would be able to improve Animalia&#39;s position as trying to argue for equality and cooperation between Animalians and Humans, and they&#39;d even put together a sign up sheet for Human students at WSA to join the show to reflect that. However, there was some element that required them to get some preparation for that expansion, and that would require approval from WSA&#39;s administration, since the idea was not officially part of the school plan or the school clubs that were offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you want to put this up on the bulletin board outside the office?&quot; Eliza asked to Sophie and Abby who had come in early to present the sign up sheet that they&#39;d come up with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... since Animalia Ambassadoria has been something that has started with high school student promoting Animalia... it would make sense to keep with that tradition,&quot; Abby answered, &quot;and thus having a sign up sheet outside the office would give people the opportunity to sign up... especially since our group was sort of &quot;drafted&quot; since I was among the first Humans converted in the initial outbreak and my friends had all been rather close...&quot;<br />
<br />
Eliza nodded as she looked over the sheet of paper. WSA had a bulletin board outside the office that often had announcements for school events, parent/teacher conferences, and other requirements. There were some post boards that would advertise colleges, and many that would go beyond UNLV, even if most Animalians seemed to go there. In this it was a service to help Animalian and now Human students as well move on after High School. It was largely utilitarian in nature, but she wasn&#39;t opposed to the idea of other announcements being there as well. Particularly as after school clubs began to get more organized and helpful for the school. She just wanted to make sure that nothing posted would be against WSA&#39;s rules and what the state of Nevada would tolerate. However, Animalia Ambassadoria never fell into the category of being &quot;bad,&quot; and as such she didn&#39;t see it as a problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I don&#39;t see anything wrong on the sign in sheet with regard to the rules,&quot; Eliza said slowly, &quot;Let me get you a pin and you can tack it up there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sophie said after her as Eliza walked back to retrieve a pin from one of the secretaries so that the sign up sheet could pinned to the bulletin board.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And so the sign up sheet was put up before the school day started. It was placed prominently and in a way that no one could miss, and would be available for everyone to see and get to. The most helpful thing for everyone was that now that they&#39;d gotten through the first month of the new school year, as it was now early October, those who had started the year totally unfamiliar with WSA&#39;s layout were now aware of it and able to make their way around campus without getting lost. This gave students with some interest in some of the extra-curricular activities the time to sign up for them. And plenty did sign up on the sign in sheet, particularly with the promise of being on the internet. It might be something that people saw as a hope for stardom, but in a way it would be something that people would want to support.<br />
<br />
Among those that saw the sign up sheet was Courtney Hedge. She&#39;d gone through much of her morning on her own and was on her way to her next class when she passed the flyer that was tacked onto the bulletin board outside the office. It looked like a pretty standard petition for signatures and even included a written selling point. That was something she read first.<br />
<br />
It read: &quot;Animalia Ambassadoria has enjoyed presenting what has been good and exciting with regard to Animalia and what has made it good in order to gain acceptance. In this we&#39;ve had great success. Now, as the world changes and as we must show that we can work with humanity, it is time for Animalia Ambassadoria to grow and show we can all work together. We, Abby and Samson Brown, Sarah and Malice Wesley, Sophie and JC Albers, Pauline, Roland Luwrie, Travis, Simon, Jessica Mariana, and Roger, open up opportunities for twelve Humans to join us on Animalia Ambassadoria. And together we may show how well we work together. This could be a great part time job opportunity. Please sign below. Auditions and interviews will be next weekend at the Brown farm.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Brown family&#39;s address and a small map image was also included. Courtney then looked down further to saw that there were actually plenty of signatures. Some weren&#39;t exactly &quot;journalists&quot; or the most diplomatic of people, but it did seem that many people had signed on. Many likely had with the idea that it would be a &quot;part time job&quot; that would look good for college and things like that. With that, Courtney set down her things and took her pencil and signed her name on the sheet.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Courtney went through the rest of her day quietly and eventually made her way to the Sexual Education class at the end of the day. She found Sophie already at the table where their assigned seats were. She sat down beside Sophie and looked over to the Pterdactylus Animalian.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw your little sign up sheet outside the office,&quot; Courtney Hedge spoke to Sophie while the teacher was getting ready for the start of the class period. To some extent she didn&#39;t think she &quot;needed&quot; a Sexual Education course, but at the same time she also knew she couldn&#39;t really afford to get into trouble with the teachers and the administration of WSA as well. &quot;You do realize that not everyone that&#39;s signed up is that interested in journalism.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably,&quot; Sophie gave a small shrug, &quot;but then journalism isn&#39;t exactly my dream job... and I hadn&#39;t even thought of it when Clara first drafted us to be Animalia Ambassadoria. And neither did any of the others. An interest in journalism may help, and depending on how many people signed up... there may be some sort of tryout/audition for the additional seats, but being a journalist isn&#39;t the goal. We want to show that Animalians and Humans can get along and work together to cover and promote Animalia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Courtney was silent for a moment as she looked over to Sophie who gave another shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in a way... we owe you for the idea,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;as while I stand by my opinion that I didn&#39;t betray what I stand for by becoming an Animalian with Roland... that doesn&#39;t mean that you weren&#39;t right about trying to show that that Animalians and Humans can get along. So in that, thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can thank me later,&quot; Courtney commented, &quot;as I did sign up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good for you,&quot; Sophie answered.</p>
