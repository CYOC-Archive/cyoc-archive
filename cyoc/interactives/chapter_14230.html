<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark's older brother Tony, Tony's friends Jack, Jeff and Eric and Tony's girlfriend Claire had never been united on what sort of transformation Mark should undergo as the price for using a transformation to teach Stevie Ontiveros a lesson.  But hearing Mark laugh and recount with such relish the irony of Stevie desperately wanting a piece of his ass in the ballet school showers suggested the same thing to all of them.  <br />
<br />
Mark left them all in Tony's room after recounting the events.  Jack turned to the others.  &quot;You know, I think Stevie's affection might not go unrequited, after all&quot; he chuckled.  The others joined in with building laughter.  It took a minute before they calmed down and quickly shut the door to Tony's room while they got out the laptop with the chronivac 4.0 program loaded on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;First, let's make the once reluctant paramour a suitably . . oh . . flexible recipient&quot; Jack chuckled.  The chronivac menus were incredibly detailed, offering the user the ability to adjust virtually any part of a subject's anatomy.  The more common adjustments were easily reached.  It took the five of them a few minutes to call up Mark's profile and to navigate option menus to the point of being able to give his sphincter the maximum possible flexibility.  They went back several menu choices and made an alteration just a few inches inside Mark, doubling the size and sensitivity of the nerve bundle at his prostate, next to his colon. <br />
<br />
Their last physical alteration of Mark was Claire's suggestion.  &quot;Make him a boy whose sexual response isn't just his cock.  Make him feel a tingle from a hand on his ass, from a kiss on the neck.  Make him a whore for foreplay&quot;.  And this, they did.  In the neurological menus were a series of choices of male or female attributes allowing the user to apply them to the subject profile.  They simply clicked on the female attributes heading, scrolled down to &quot;Diffused locus of sexual response&quot; and double clicked on that attribute to give it to Mark.<br />
<br />
On the purely mental side of the profile, they chuckled and changed his natural setting on the 0-100 sexual preference scale from 85, solidly straight, to 15, solidly gay.  Navigating deep into the menu of sexual predilections, they first changed his inhibitions setting from an already relative wild 35, to an anything goes 5.  Then, they input the description of his ideal lover.  They made it a detailed description of Stevie Ontiveros.  One year older than Mark, 15, about 5'11&quot; and 153 pounds, a lithe, athletic body with a drum tight, round ass, shaggy blond hair and blue eyes.  And lastly, they set Mark's new mental profile so that he would realize what had happened to him but be powerless to resist or change.<br />
<br />
Tony hit the 'enter' button.  In his room, Mark felt the electric wave pass through him.  He came running into Tony's room.<br />
&quot;Hey!  What'd you do to me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Relax little bro.  Almost nothing right away.  We set it to not really kick in until after lunch in school tomorrow&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark pressed them all for some kind of hint, pleading with Jack as he was going out the door, pulling on his sleeve as it shut, but neither Jack nor any of the others would tell him anything.<br />
<br />
The next day, Mark woke up feeling not just good but terrific.  It was one of the first cool nights of the year and the sheets just felt so good against his skin.  He yawned and stretched and put on his bathrobe to make his way to the bathroom.  He stripped in front of the mirror.  Nothing about his body looked different.  Even his morning erection was absolutely typical.  It was a bit odd that it didn't dissipate in the shower, but got even harder as he lathered up and rinsed.  But that didn't seem noteworthy.  He dressed and went to school.  Something seemed a bit odd all day, but there was nothing he could put his finger on.  His clothes felt a bit odd against his skin, not quite making him itch, just sort of . . tingle but that might've been his mother using or not using fabric softener on the last few loads of wash.<br />
<br />
It seemed like a typical day of boring classes.  Mark checked out his reflection in the glass case by the school entrance but nothing looked different.  After lunch, he had gym class and they played floor hockey which always got the boys excited, there being no tremendous skill involved in playing passably well and there being the possibility of checking and roughhousing.  Mark didn't even notice his perceptions incrementally changing as he was changing into his shorts and t-shirt.  He was one of the first boys picked because he was known as a terrific athlete even though he was also known to be taking ballet.  He suggested other choices to his team's captain.  &quot;Take Bobby.  We can use a big body and that's a good one . . take Tyrone that's obviously a boy who can run . . no, no, not Kevin the fatty, take the little kid with the round ass . .&quot;<br />
<br />
After 40 minutes of spirited play, they went off to the showers and while most all the other boys were quiet there, Mark kept up a constant chatter and patted his teammates as they went by.  There were glances askance among the rest of the boys.  &quot;I thought you said he wasn't like that&quot; said one to another.  <br />
<br />
From his locker near the shower entrance, Mark admired his classmates' tight litte asses while he dried himself and dressed.  He went to a math class and then was on his way to his last class of the day when a boy caught his eye.  Mark didn't even realize he was staring at a tall, handsome redheaded senior until he ran smack into another boy.  <br />
<br />
Mark and the other boy tumbled to the hallway floor with Mark eventually rolling on top of him.  He started to get up, offering profuse apologies as he did and finally looking the boy in the eye.<br />
<br />
He caught his breath.  It was Stevie Ontiveros.  But Mark didn't catch his breath because it was Stevie.  He caught his breath because it was an angel.  It was a teen apollo.  Even irritation was beautiful in those cornflower blue eyes.  That blond hair was like a halo.  Mark held his breath staring at that face and imagining all the rest of the skin of Stevie's body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch where you're going St. Martin&quot; said Stevie rising to his feet and collecting his books.<br />
&quot;Kind of a klutz for a ballet star&quot; laughed one of the others.<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, you couldn't partner a mannequin with your footwork&quot;, Mark snapped at the other boy.<br />
<br />
Stevie went off with his friends.  Mark was torn.  Follow him now or wait for another chance.  It wasn't the time or place, but looking at that rear of his pants down the end of the hall, Mark decided to try and speak to Stevie now.  The door to the sophomore composition classroom was closed in his face and mark had to hurry to his own class.<br />
<br />
But it was a class he barely paid any attention to.  All he could think of was angelic Stevie Ontiveros.  Mark daydreamed of him while completely ignoring the teacher's lecture and was only snapped out of it by the girl in the seat in front of him tapping his left arm to get him to take a sheet with some homework on it.  Mark suddenly realized he was gently rubbing his nipple with his other hand and that he was almost completely erect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!  What the hell's going on here?&quot; his original personna interjected into his thoughts.  &quot;I'm fantasizing about Stevie Ontiveros!  And I'm getting off on my own nipples?!&quot;  But though this element of his mind wanted to reassert control and take his thoughts elsewhere, Mark went back to daydreaming of Stevie until the bell rang and school ended.<br />
<br />
Mark ran out of the room and grabbed his books and backpack and then headed after Stevie.  He caught up to him in the parking lot outside the school.  Stevie was getting into his car.  Mark sprinted toward it.  As he approached, he smiled.  The others were all getting into the car of one of the other boys, Tommy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!  Stevie!&quot;<br />
Ontiveros heard and saw Mark and stopped.  The window was rolled down and Mark could see his gorgeous face twisted slightly into impatience.  It did not help that Mark couldn't concentrate upon seeing that face.<br />
&quot;Well, what is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Um, I-I was thinking that you-you ought to be back in tights.  You-you have the perfect body for it, for . . ballet&quot;<br />
&quot;I did the whole spandex up my butt thing for a month, St. Martin.  I don't know what the hell I was thinking.  The whole school thinks I'm a fruit loop like you&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe you are.  Maybe I'm-Maybe I'm like you.  You-you remember in the locker room . . kissing me&quot;<br />
&quot;Shut the fuck up about that!&quot;  Stevie frantically looked around to see if anyone was nearby and had heard.<br />
&quot;Shut the fuck up!  Are you trying to ruin me?&quot;<br />
Mark leaned forward, closer to that angelic countenance.  <br />
&quot;No.  I-I've just been rethinking what I said to you then&quot;<br />
&quot;Rethinking?&quot;<br />
&quot;. . yeah . . rethinking&quot;<br />
Stevie looked around.  Seeing no one close by or even paying attention from a distance, he turned back to Mark. <br />
&quot;Get in&quot;<br />
Stevie drove back to his house in an upper middle class neighborhood.  Mark decided to follow Stevie's lead.  To his chagrin, Stevie didn't say a word to him as he drove through the streets.  He didn't say a word as he parked the car and got out.  Mark followed after him and into the house.  The minute the door closed behind Mark, Stevie slapped him, knocking him off against a closet door.<br />
&quot;You little bitch!  Now it's okay!  Now?!&quot; He slapped Mark again.  To Mark's surprise, he felt almost no indignation.  He felt as though he deserved it, that he had been a little bitch.  Stevie slapped him again and again until Mark finally managed to get to his feet.  He almost leaped at Stevie, but not with hostile intentions.  He wrapped his arms around larger Stevie and kissed him.  Stevie suddenly stopped slapping and kissed Mark.  Then he tore Mark's clothes off him and kissed him some more.  <br />
<br />
Mark was shocked at how good it felt.  Stevie's hands running all over his round ass sent a tingle through Mark's entire body.  Even accidental touches on his thighs and his neck sent shivers straight to his penis.  A simple button on the pocket of Stevie's shirt rubbing against his right nipple gave a delicious tingle to Mark, too.  He was so on fire with desire and these odd physical responses, he barely noticed that Stevie was half leading, half carrying him up to his bedroom.  He stood Mark up in front of his bed and did a few of the same odd penis on penis thrusts as he'd done in the ballet locker room where Mark had resisted.  <br />
<br />
But Mark didn't resist this or resist when Stevie spun him around and pushed him over onto his belly on the bed.  Mark glanced behind him and saw Stevie smiling and almost brandishing his huge penis as he gave Mark a friendly slap on the butt.  A shiver of worry went through Mark's thoughts.  There's no way that'll fit up my ass.  No way.  But in a moment, Stevie was on top of him and it felt delicious.  The warm touch of the skin of golden Stevie on his felt wonderful to Mark.  He felt Stevie first nibbling, then biting hard on his ear.  He didn't care.  It was wonderful.  And then, with one thrust from the rear Mark couldn't reach but longed to get his hands on, he felt Stevie's giant penis pressed to his sphincter.  Mark gasped.  It couldn't possibly fit.  But then, with a firm push, it did.  And what was more, when Stevie was all the way inside him, Mark felt an even more incredible rush of pleasure from a spot inside him that Stevie rubbed and stimulated with every thrust.  And there were many thrusts.  Mark felt completely helpless before the incredible bliss Stevie was giving him.  He felt like he was being stamped as Stevies's.  And when Stevie finally came, shooting his warm seed inside Mark, Mark also came.  But Mark experienced an orgasm female style, shooting his seed, but feeling euphoria and release in a series of waves.  Only after they were over and he heard his voice, did Mark realize he was moaning loudly in time with them.<br />
<br />
He lay curled next to Stevie on the bed for some time.  It was the first of many times over the next week with Stevie.  Part of his mind practically screamed that this was ridiculous to be in love with and the virtual sex slave of this handsome, but somewhat ordinary boy.  Stevie realized Mark's position, too, even if he didn't know why Mark was suddenly so enthralled with him and so submissive.  He had Mark give him head whenever he felt potent enough and he made Mark beg to touch the skin of his ass which, alone, sent shivers through him.  And he laughed at how he could get the smaller Mark off on just rubbing his little ass or his neck or his little nipples.  <br />
<br />
But, after a week of dominating bliss, of Mark almost not controlling himself in school, hanging on Stevie at times, of slapping and fucking Mark however he pleased after driving him to his house, Mark suddenly changed.  He refused to go home with him after school one day.<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; demanded Stevie.<br />
&quot;I'm just not interested&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean not interested?&quot;<br />
&quot;That's not me&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean?  What's not you?  Sucking my dick is you.  Literally kissing my ass is you.  What's not you, bitch?'<br />
&quot;Look, I'm not you're bitch anymore.  That's over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stevie looked angrily after him as Mark went away down the hall.  But he couldn't say anything.  The two of them had already aroused suspicions at school.  Stevie had to accept it.  And, oddly, having sown his wild homosexual oats in his domination of Mark, his interests turned toward the girls.  So did Mark's.  Tony and the others kidded him about what an adoring girl type he'd been toward Stevie.  He was happy to get back to being with Zoe, but when he finally did get her in bed, he noted with disappointment the comparison between his female style orgasms and his natural male ones.</p>
