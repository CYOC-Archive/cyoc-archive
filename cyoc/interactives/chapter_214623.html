<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oliver heard his sister (mom?) going the bathroom next to Connor and Jackson&#39;s room. He heard the tub turn on. He heard the tub fill with water, as he continued standing there in the middle of the room upon legs that were entirely too short. Dressed in the blue Nike track pants that were entirely too small but fit anyway. His &quot;brother&quot; was immediately on the ground playing with a truck and an action figure, making &quot;brrrr&quot; noises for the truck, and &quot;pchew, pchew!&quot; noises with the man, supposedly firing at the truck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Jackson! Play with me!&quot; He begged, with his adorable big brown eyes with his.....OUR!....distinctive half-moon shape. I sighed, looking down at him, looking up at me. Like a little kid. Looking exactly like....well...me! Or rather, I look exactly like him... I sighed again.<br />
<br />
The tub water shut off. He heard the bedroom door open, as he looked way up at his huge former sister, who stuck her head into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, you two! I want you guys to take your bathy while I go downstairs to get super ready! You guys should be old enough now to get your own bath! You&#39;re 5 1/2 years old now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright!&quot; Piped up Connor. &quot;,I&#39;m gonna briiiiinnngg.....THIS!&quot; He said, as he thought about which toy to bring to the tub with him, picking a plastic dinosaur. &quot;What you gonna bring into the tub, Jackson?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Jesus Christ!&quot; I thought as I looked down at the small boy who was my size. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know!&quot; he said. &quot;You bring a man and this house and try to stop me from getting to the house!&#39;<br />
<br />
He squealed with delight as he stood up and shed all of his clothes before me. I could only stand there gawking at the young delightful little child who was exactly the same size as me in his little &quot;birthday suit.&quot; That&#39;s when it really hit me!<br />
<br />
The tiny little impotent and innocent little wienie between his impossibly smooth, skinny little legs! It was barely even a worm! And his totally smooth boyish little chest, arms, and even armpits. Not a single inkling of any sort of hair anywhere! <br />
<br />
He went scampering off into the bathroom as I heard a splash and some laughing. I could only stand there, looking down at my own still fully-clothed body. Practically breaking out into a sweat. Still wearing the clothes that Jackson...the REAL Jackson....had dressed this body in that morning while I was getting around making my coffee at MY place. As ME! <br />
<br />
&quot;I ONLY HEAR ONE OF YOU IN THERE!&quot; shouted Olivia/&quot;mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YEAH! COME ON JACKSON! LETS PLAY!&quot; Shouted Connor from the tub. He immediately went back to making play pretend noises. There must be a lot going on that active 5 year old boy&#39;s little brain. Which made Oliver chuckle, despite himself. He had to admit, he was beginning to feel a connection to his new &quot;brother&quot; that he never felt towards anyone before. <br />
<br />
But still.... A grown ass man switching bodies with a little 5 year old boy.... It was fun when he did it in private. But to actually LUVE as a little kid, and all anyone sees when they look at him is just a cute little kid....<br />
<br />
&quot;JACKSON!&quot; He heard his &quot;mom&quot; yell his name from the doorway of the room. She snuck up on him! It startled the hell out of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Christ!&quot; He said, turning around<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you just say!?&quot; She asked, getting mad now. <br />
<br />
&quot;You scared me!&quot; He piped up in his cringey little high-pitched childish voice <br />
<br />
Knowing now when to pick her battles, she sigh, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you taking your bath with your brother!?&quot; That was more imperative in the moment. Later, she has a mind to address his language. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come here,&quot; she said. Trapped by an adult as the child of the mother, Oliver didn&#39;t see any other option. He approached her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arms up,&quot; she commanded. <br />
<br />
Sighing, Oliver did as he was told. She took his shirt off, leaving him barechested. He looked down and saw the smooth child&#39;s upper torsoe that was the body he was now stuck with. He gawped at the impossibly small and smooth chest, torsoe, and arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pants and shoes too! Off!&quot; She commanded. <br />
<br />
Feeling even more vulnerable and childlike, he bent down to strip. Whitey tights, exactly like Connor had been wearing. With a shudder, from humiliation, fear, and the unexpected coldness of the temperature, he pulled down the underwear. He was now completely naked in front of his own sister as her little boy! He had to remind himself that he WAS Jackson, afterall. She was none the wiser that he was her brother.<br />
<br />
The sight of the exact same impotent innocent little worm between his legs that his &quot;brother&quot; had, gave him an even weirder feeling. Of greater fear of the finality of his fate. <br />
<br />
But no! He cannot accept this! But what was he to do? He stepped over to the mirror in &quot;his&quot; bedroom, and only saw one of his little nephews staring back. Naked. Small. Vulnerable. Far too young and innocent. God, they were such good looking cute little guys. And he was now one of them. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s it! Oliver WAS a 5 you old little boy now, as far as the entire rest of the world was concerned. All anyone would see, was just a cute little kid. Nobody would ever know he was formerly a grown ass man. His own grown up body was out there. With someone else using it. All he had to do, was don this little kid disguise for a little while and Biden his time. He had made that decision earlier, and he had to stick to it. <br />
<br />
Steeling his face as much as he could, as much as an innocent young little face could, Oliver sighed. &quot;Jackson,&quot; he thought to himself. &quot;I am Jackson. My name is Jackson. Not Oliver. I&#39;m Jackson.....&quot;<br />
<br />
He took a deep breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok. I&#39;m ready.&quot; he said to him myself, then turned towards the bedroom door, and walked into the bathroom to join his twin brother in the bathtub.</p>
