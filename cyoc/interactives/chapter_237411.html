<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr. Kelly&#39;s face splits into a wide, somewhat devious grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s start with a question. Are you boys into the superhero genre?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe looked at Mike, who shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, I guess,&quot; answered Joe. &quot;I&#39;ve watched a few movies, played a few games.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It depends on the telling,&quot; Mike answered. His voice was grave, despite the oddity of the question, but he was burning with curiosity to know <i>why</i> she would ask. &quot;In general, I find the concept cool but too often the stories told with it are ultimately unsatisfying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Kelly laughed lightly. &quot;A thoughtful answer! But what if I told you that superpowers need not be limited to stories?&quot;<br />
<br />
This time Mike answered first, as he was quicker to process the question. &quot;You mean, you&#39;ve developed a way to give people superpowers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; interjected Joe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes way,&quot; responded Dr. Kelly. &quot;As the kids say. I and my team have developed a serum that allows us to significantly alter a human&#39;s biochemistry; depending on what we add to it, we should be able to replicate a number of classic powers as well as a few more... obscure abilities. But...&quot; She rose smoohly from her desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need to take my word for it. How about a demonstration?&quot; Even as she asked, she was undoing her necktie, to throw it over the back of her executive chair. Her labcoat quickly followed, and she strutted around the desk as she undid the buttons of her blouse.<br />
<br />
Joe&#39;s eyes were bulging out of his head, rapt and unable to think, much less talk, as the bombshell scientist stripped in front of them. Mike managed a weak, &quot;Uh, y-yeah... if you want...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s my pleasure.&quot; She whipped off her blouse, leaving her magnificent rack snugly displayed in a tantalising black and maroon lace bra. She folded and laid the blouse on the desk; next she stripped off her slacks, giving the boys a great view of her cleavage as gravity strained her massive orbs against the restraint of her bra. She stepped out of her pumps and pants, picking up the latter and laying them alongside her blouse. The whole time she had a small, knowing smirk, obviously enjoying their stares<br />
<br />
Now she stood, dressed only in lingerie. She wore sensual lace panties that matched her bra, and a garter belt that held up two stockings that emphaissed her long, curvy legs. She had gone from scientist to supermodel, and the transformation was breath-taking -- neither Mike nor Joe would have recognised her as the famous genius, or guessed that she had this hiding under her business attire.<br />
<br />
Though there were two odd details. One was that her stockings did not cover her feet, held only by loops under her arches. The other was that her garter belt had a buckle, which though tastefully incorporated into the design still stood out with its shiny red plating and embossed golden &quot;DV&quot;.<br />
<br />
&#39;Now, watch closely.&quot; Her professional tone now definitely held a note of teasing. And with a manicured finger, she pushed in the monogram on the belt, and said, &quot;Vixen on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Latex, the same bright red as the buckle, flowed out of the belt up and down her body as she set her hands on her hips. Not without shuddering a bit in pleasure, suppressing moans as it covered her loins and her nipples. As the red tide reached her knees, it formed metallic gold bands and continued on, black now, molding into high-heeled latex boots. The same thing happened as the latex reached her elbows, forming rings of gold and then encasing her forearms and hands in black.<br />
<br />
It stopped at her neck with a gold collar -- or at least, the latex suit did. But the young men&#39;s minds were blown as white fur continued up her throat and chin, continuing as her face pushed out into a narrow vulpine muzzle with white jaws, a wet black nose pad, bold, black comma-shaped markings on the sides and vermillion on the top, merging with the bright fur covering her face. Her eyes became a bit narrower, her irises turning golden and her pupils drawing together. Her ears grew pointed and shifted up on her head, turning to soft black triangles poking through her hair. Even that changed, now styled into a fringe of bangs across her forward instead of being brushed to the side.<br />
<br />
Behind her a large, poofy tail sprouted from above her ass, a ring of black fur separating the vermillion from the large white tip; the boys could see it waving languidly behind her. At the same time, a raised black triangular plate formed over her crotch and rounded plates covered her nipples, which had been poking through the suit as if the bra were no longer there. They were thin, almost flush with the suit, and had minute holes piercing them like micro vents. As a finishing touch, a large gold &quot;V&quot; appeared, blazoned across her bust.<br />
<br />
Other details stood out -- at least to Mike, Joe was too lost in amazement (and arousal) to see beyond the obvious. Her gloves were now tipped by short but sharp-looking claws. And her boots, though elegant, seemed a little too wide at the boot and much too high in the arch to actually be covering human feet. So he suspected (rightly) that beneath the suit she was just as furry and foxy as what was visible outside.<br />
<br />
The changes finished, the Doctor let out a deeply satisfied sigh. She smiled confidently down at them, hands on hips, tail wagging behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that convincing enough? You see before you Dr. Vixen: a super genius whose nanite-powered transformation grants her increased mental agility, sensory acuity, and physically superhuman speed, reflexes and strength. The natural scent glands of a fox have been tweaked to release pheromones that make those around me more aroused and pliant to my words. You may think of it as a natural perfume that makes humans horny for me, and as a result desirous to please me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; Was all Joe could say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing,&quot; breathed Mike, eyes alight. This was surreal, but in a very good way. <i>Think of the possibilities...</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; She dipped her head in acknowledgement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then. You&#39;ve likely surmised that this is what I want to test. Two young men are perfect candidates for the serum, and I hope you&#39;re interested. However;&quot; she held up a hand. &quot;Don&#39;t answer too quickly. There&#39;s little risk, but great responsibility. I will not dictate how you use your powers; while I do wish to set up a crime-fighting team, it is also useful to us to monitor how you use your powers in every-day life. As well as of course confirming the success of the various power serums themselves. Even with that limited participation, a three-month trial period will be involved, with us tracking your daily interactions while under the effect of a super serum. And of course you will be liable if non-participants begin to suspect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; repeated Joe, his voice thick with infatuation. He was leaning forward in his seat, his eyes taking on a glazed look. He was sitting closer to her, and it seemed the pheromones she mentioned were getting to him. &quot;I&#39;ll-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I have a couple of questions,&quot; interrupted Mike. He could smell her too -- an indescrible mix of sweetness and sex -- and was semi-hard in his briefs, but he generally kept a clear head. And he was honestly more interested in emulating Dr. Kelly&#39;s powered-up form than in fucking her. &quot;First, can we change our own changes? -- I mean, powers? A-and second... just out of curiosity, what would you do if someone... went rogue?&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled wamrly at him. His interest was appreciated; and maybe she was impressed by his ability to keep focus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent questions, Mike. To the first, yes; of course you can choose your powers and any metamorphoses that may accompany them. To the second, well; we are taking a risk of course. As I mentioned, the biochemical changes are facilitated by a nanite-infused serum. We do have a failsafe in place to remotely control the nanites. In theory this would depower and immobilise the inidivudal -- but obviously we have not been able to test this as I am the only one who has taken the serum, and I do not wish to risk the deleterious side-effects &#39;de-powering&#39; might have.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we are taking a gamble that you will not abuse your powers -- or &#39;spill the beans&#39;. But if you did so, you would also be gambling that our failsafe fails, a gamble <i>I</i> would not like to take. I do not intend to go into what the side-effects might be, but they could be significantly wish then merely losing the powers you&#39;ve been gifted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or rather, loaned. The serums we will be injecting will only last for three months, our clinical trial period. At the end of that time, you may choose to continue further testing, or receive payment. But if you abuse our trust you will of course not be offered an extension, or money.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough.&quot; Mike nodded. &quot;So... I think that&#39;s all of my questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well.&quot; Dr. Kelly -- or Dr. Vixen -- leaned against her desk. &quot;Take some time to consider it. And,&quot; she added with a smirk, &quot;you may step out into my secretary&#39;s office if you think my pheromones will unduly influence your judgement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeeeeeah...&quot; Mike glanced at the lovestruck Joe. &quot;We&#39;ll do that. C&#39;mon, dude.&quot; He took his friend&#39;s hand and helped him to his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Joe replied, a dazed grin on his face as he let Mike drag him from the room.<br />
<br />
The guards -- who seemed to have been quietly laughing through all of this -- closed the door behind them. Mike took a deep breath of relatively fresh air, and after a few minutes Joe seemed to snap back to reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; he gasped, shaking his head. &quot;That... that was crazy! She turned into a fox! Like, literally!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man, I saw,&quot; Mike answered, amused. &quot;I was there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I... she was so... I never thought I was into furries but... those boobs -- I-I mean...&quot; he flushed as he shot a glance at the female secretary, who seemed to suppress a giggle as she worked on her computer. &quot;It... it must have been those pheromones, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They did seem to have an effect.&quot; Mike shifted, feeling his briefs loosening again. While he&#39;d managed to resist better than Joe, he certainly had felt their &quot;effect&quot;. And it made him... envious. <i>He</i> wanted power as well -- forget paying off college loans, this would change his life in ways he hadn&#39;t dared dream. But it wasn&#39;t like him to show his excitement -- or like Joe to pick up on the subtle indicators he did give off. &quot;So, what do you think of her offer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding? Hell yeah! I could become super strong, or super fast... maybe super attractive to hot chicks, heheh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you already had a girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah, but no harm in being attractive, right? Besides, maybe she&#39;d be down for a threesome or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike chuckled. Then got the conversation back on track.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the other thing she mentioned? Being part of an actual superhero team?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe became serious for a moment. &quot;Well... that I don&#39;t know. I mean, I guess it would be nice, uphold justice, protect the innocent and all that... but I bet it&#39;s also a lot of work.&quot;</p>
