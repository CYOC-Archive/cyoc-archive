<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Timothy crouched slightly and edged his way into the now-smaller bathroom through the narrow door.  It would be hard to resist doing this all the time, he realized as he fished around in the bottom of the tub to pull out the drain stopper.  It felt so good to be so sexually ...active... that if he wasn't careful he'd spend all of his time jerking off!
<br />

<br />
With the small plug dripping his spooge, he watched as the thick liquid slowly made its way down the drain.  He grinned, dumbly, feeling pride in his sexual accomplishment like some hidden, embarassed, secret pleasure.
<br />

<br />
A dull rumble came from his stomach as he turned to go back to his bedroom and the box.  Timothy put his smooth, scaled hand to his stomach and looked down at himself.  &quot;Strange,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;I don't feel hungry...&quot;
<br />

<br />
Flattening his velvety wings against his powerful back, the newly-forged dragon squeezed his way out of the bathroom again, gritting his teeth against the sensations of rubbing his beachball-sized balls against the doorframe as he went.  &quot;Well, going out in public isn't much of an option,&quot; he muttered, looking down the full length of his nine-foot-tall body.
<br />

<br />
Ducking under the low doorway to his bedroom, he was glad that the upper floor of his ramshackle home had such high ceilings.  Even with the bounce in his step, his two-foot-long horns missed the ceiling (but just barely) and avoided giving him any more, expensive repair bills.  As it was, he realized, with his twin horns, his height was probably closer to eleven feet tall.
<br />

<br />
The rumble in his stomach caught his attention again, only this time, with a slight pain to it.  Gripping his abdomen, he walked over to his full-length mirror to look at himself.
<br />

<br />
Timothy wasn't sure what he'd see apart from a giant, humanoid dragon with great muscle tone, a massive dangling sheath, two balls that hung to his knees and a mane of luxurious hair like that on a horse.  He didn't see anything &quot;wrong&quot;, per se ... but what would be &quot;wrong&quot; on such a beast?
<br />

<br />
His belly rumbled again, only this time, he felt something deep within him surge.  Eyes wide, he clamped his jaws shut, feeling as if he was about to vomit!  Suddenly dizzy, he felt he could no longer hold back, though and with a reflexive closing of his eyes, he belched.
<br />

<br />
A roar and heat filled the room and he felt a rushing gas escaping his lips.  He forced his eyes open as the sensation began to die down, and he could see the flickering of firelight all around him.
<br />

<br />
Timothy gasped.
<br />

<br />
The wall and mirror-frame in front of him were ablaze!
<br />

<br />
He had just breathed fire!
<br />

<br />
He stood there, stunned, as the wall crackled with the heavy flames, their heat rolling off of his scaly hide like water off a duck.  Dumbfounded, he could only watch as the flames danced seductively before him for nearly a minute, climbing to the ceiling, before reality struck him...  He was about to burn down his house!
<br />

<br />
Quickly, he dashed from his room, his horns cracking against the low door frame as he failed to duck low enough.  He felt the relatively fragile wood give way as he thundered down the hallway and tried to make his way to the kitchen for the fire extinguisher!
<br />

<br />
It was several minutes, a few broken door frames and some ceiling scrapes from his horns, later, that -panting- Timothy managed to put out the blaze and survey the damage.
<br />

<br />
The drywall and wood paneling over it was ruined.  It was black, cracked and probably structurally unsound, now.  He sighed and wondered how in the world he'd get the money to repair this.  The only thing was, in the middle of it all, was the smooth, shiny mirror hung on the wall in which he could see his glum expression.
<br />

<br />
First the hole into the bathroom and now this.
<br />

<br />
What next?
<br />

<br />
A shimmer seemed to wobble in the air before Timothy for a moment and, in that second, the dragon wondered if the fire had truly gone out.  It almost looked like the ripples of heat that would rise off of a desert highway around Noon ... like -perhaps- all the heat had not yet gone away.
<br />

<br />
But as the dragon looked closer, he could see the ripples forming in the depths of the mirror ... as if reflected in it's surface, the very air itself were fluctuating in undulating waves.  He shook his head, focusing and leaning in for a better look.  He glanced behind himself to see nothing, and then back into the mirror.
<br />

<br />
No, the ripples appeared in front of his reflection, but were actually *behind* the glass of the mirror pane.  He glanced back at the Chest, on his bed, and then at the mirror.  Somehow, his firey breath did this ... it had to be...
<br />

<br />
Slowly, he put out his clawed finger tip and brushed it against the mirror's surface.  He'd expected to find a hard-yet-warm pane of glass, but -instead- the mirror rippled, like water, and allowed his fingers to push through.  Startled, he pulled his hand back and blinked in surprise.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; he muttered to himself, absently.
<br />

<br />
Past boyfriends had taken him to enough movies where he'd seen stuff like this in special effects, but not in the real world.  Then again, he thought -looking at his reflection-, what was real anymore?
<br />

<br />
His heart was racing as he pondered his options.
<br />

<br />
After a few minutes, he turned and picked up the chest.  Turning to the mirror he smiled at the new, exaggerated reflection that greeted him.  &quot;Ok, let's see what this prophesy is all about...&quot;
<br />

<br />
With that, taking the Chest with him, Timothy stepped up to the mirror and passed through, leaving only a ripple to mark his passing.
<br />

<br />
Several more minutes passed in the empty room, before a figure -concealed in the shadows outside his ruined bedroom door frame- stepped into the vacated space, cautiously.  His eyes looked at the mirror, where the dragon had gone and he shivered...</p>
