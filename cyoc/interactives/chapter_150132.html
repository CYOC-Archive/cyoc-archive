<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">…and she says nothing. You&#39;re confused as she seems to be straining to say something, but no words come out. She seems frozen in time as she maintains her same position and expression. <br />
<br />
The man lets out a sudden, haunting bark as he bellows and waves a hand in front of the queen&#39;s face. She seems to slump onto the floor motionless, as if asleep or dead. The man drops to a knee and leans tauntingly over the queen. <br />
&quot;It&#39;s a good thing I came prepared to this exchange. I know what the maid truly is; why else would I even pretend to wager on such a deal?&quot; He lets out a small chuckle before continuing. &quot;I&#39;d hoped our negotiations wouldn&#39;t have had to stoop so low, but the prize was too great to resist.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stood up and stretched out a hand towards you, sending a shiver down your spine. &quot;I will be taking the human toy with me. Thank you for preparing him for what is to come. It will make their new existence all the more... enjoyable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Having reached the conclusion of his speech, he waves the hand pointed at you. You suddenly feel the gentle lull of sleep begin to take control of your every being as you succumb to a deep slumber.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It was warm, inviting, perhaps even friendly. There was a casualness to the gesture of a hand coming to rest on your shoulder. You slowly aroused yourself as you began to take in your new surroundings. Contrary to what kidnapping situations on television have led you to believe, the room you were in was very well lit. You were simply lying on the floor of the room, no restraints or bonds of any type. You could only see the edge of it, but not anything that was resting on top of it. You sat up, taking notice of your nakedness, and surveyed what else you could see.<br />
<br />
Most surprisingly, you were now a teenage boy, rather than the little girl you were before. The room had a small mirror in the corner and a round pedestal in the very center. Other than that, the room was quite empty. No door invited an exit and no one else was present.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, you heard a radio static erupt in the air around you and the voice of the man from the costume store spoke. &quot;Hello, toy. I&#39;ve seen that you have come to your senses. Seeing as you are now mine to make use of, let&#39;s not make this more difficult than it needs to be. I&#39;m more than willing to find a much cooperative toy, if losing yourself is worth the price.&quot;<br />
<br />
You let out a sigh. You were just about done with people forcing you into uncomfortable positions. But was it worth dying for? Probably not. You let out a resigned sigh and submit to what is about to come.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good choice. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll both be pleased by the results of our time together.&quot; A panel in the ceiling slid aside to dump a bundle of cloth onto the floor. &quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to have to leave you now. I can&#39;t stand to look at the ghastly sight you are. Make yourself more presentable and we&#39;ll talk further.&quot;<br />
<br />
You step over to the cloth and hold it up to examine what you&#39;re getting yourself into. You lifted up what appears to be some shape wear similar to what you donned earlier in the maid doll. This one seemed even more extreme than before and intended for a larger male to wear. A zipper in the back allowed entry so you tentatively extended a leg into the appropriate slot. The bottom of the leg was open, but the part that clung to your leg was very tight, bordering restrictive. It took a while to maneuver your leg through the hole, but once you did, you&#39;d guess that your leg would be very difficult to remove. Your leg was now compressed into a thinner manifestation of itself, much more suited to a girl than yourself. Taking a double take, you&#39;re able to surmise that that was what the intended goal was.<br />
<br />
Your other leg followed suit, allowing you to pull the suit up to your waist. There was a little pocket for you to put your penis in, which ensured that it remained in between your legs in order to not interrupt the sight of feminine beauty. There was also a butt plug protruding from the respective area. You nervously pulled it up to level with the orifice before gently inserting it. You gulped as it began its intrusion, but were shocked at how quickly you adjusted to it. Pulling the suit up, you admired at how closely the suit clung to your body and how seamlessly integrated the padding was. Minus the seams, it seemed perfectly natural for your waist to blossom out into a wide set of hips and butt, before racing down to your thin thighs. After pulling the chest area up to your own, you gave a quick, nervous squeeze of the fake breasts that would soon be your own. They were quite large with prominent nipples and would most certainly look even larger at the end result if your legs were anything to go off. After thrusting an arm into the sleeve, twisting and shoving it to fit through the tiny hole, you performed the same maneuver with your other arm and lifted the suit to rest on your shoulders.<br />
<br />
As you finished pulling the zipper up to the top, you suddenly keeled over as you experienced a tightness beginning to envelop your entire body. It started at your waist and pressed sharply inwards, sucking the breath out of you as your chest shrunk tremendously. You also experienced the same pressure. After it was all done, you looked at yourself in the mirror and were amazed to see that your shoulders had seem to shrink as well. No other pressure seemed to be forthcoming, so you lifted up the hood of the suit and pulled it around your head. The face was open for the most part, save for what seemed to be a breathing apparatus for your mouth and nose. As you pulled it closer, you winced again as nose tubes were inserted into your nostrils and a long gag was jammed into your throat. You thought you were going to choke on it and were waiting for your gag reflex to kick in when... it didn&#39;t. After the gag had made its journey, you found that fresh air was still being filtered through, providing you with enough to avoid being uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
After finishing putting on the fabric suit, a grey latex suit was dropped onto the floor again from another area of the ceiling. Bundled up inside of all of it, a helmet was nestled in the cloth made out of the same material. Its face bore no distinctive features other than two blue glass spots that would allow you to look out of it. <br />
<br />
Finding the hole to enter at the neck of the suit, you burrowed your legs down into the suit, seeking out the leg holes. The process of becoming whatever the man wanted was quiet, accompanied by the squeak of latex as you rubbed your legs together. It took you much less time to put on the entire ensemble, save for a tricky section when you had to fiddle with the suit to fit over your breasts. After pulling the neck up to your own and fitting the helmet into place, you heard a hissing sound as the spare air inside the suit escaped, vacuum-sealing and merging your two suits together. Your body suddenly felt very tight as your arms were made even smaller and you would&#39;ve made a slight groan at the plug being forced deeper inside of you had your gag not stopped you. Once it stopped, you turned around and gazed at the sight of you in the mirror. You looked to be some odd latex mannequin with stunning proportions. The room seemed to be tinted blue, no doubt a result at looking out of the helmet. <br />
<br />
It was at this time that the third suit descended from above, the suit that was to be your new body. You were quite surprised to see what appeared to be a deflated mermaid. She had the most pristine and lovely skin, perfectly smooth and uniform in a pale flesh tone. The mask present at the top had long, beautiful sky-blue hair that would most certainly reach her lower back. It was cut with bangs that would frame the face and had two tresses that hung down at the front. A pearl hairpiece pinned some up at the back, allowing it to stand above the rest. She had a cute smile with a tiny nose, along with large blue eyes. <br />
Her tail fin was silvery and iridescent, which led up to the rest of the tail which started dark blue, but lightened to the same sky-blue where it met your waist, or rather almost did. While the sides of the tail reached your hips as well as your butt, the front fell short a bit, proudly displaying where your legs met and hiding your vagina just out of sight, tantalizingly out of sight. <br />
<br />
You felt slightly turned on by the sight of the mermaid, which only magnitude after you realized that that would soon be you. After searching for a hole to enter the suit, you finally found it where you least expected it. Rather than a zipper on the back or at the neck to ruin the image of the perfect mermaid doll, there was a hole at the crotch that allowed entry. Not wanting to break the suit, you gently tugged open the hole at the crotch wide enough to stick a leg in. Soon after letting go of the lips of the hole, it shrank back to its original size, trapping your leg inside and giving no indication of any wear at being stretched wide. Your leg soon found the end of the tail, which forced your foot into flattening out into an en pointe position to reach the bottom of the tail. Opening the crotch hole again, you placed your other leg inside and soon fell over from the lack of balance. Muttering to yourself inside your head, you dragged yourself over to the pedestal in the center and reached a sitting position where you wouldn&#39;t fall over. Finishing with your other leg, you gave a few test flicks of your feet together, watching as the tail mimicked your actions. Craning your head, to look at the rest of the skinsuit you were sitting on, you tried to figure out how to best get inside the rest. You hoped that you wouldn&#39;t fall over as getting back onto the pedestal would surely be harder now that you were fully in the tail. <br />
<br />
Grasping both sides of the vagina hole with all your might, you pulled both of your arms apart, creating a hole about the size of a basketball in the mermaid. You could feel your penis, trapped though it was in multiple layers, strain to reach full erection at such a splendid sight. Seizing your chance, you dove into the crotch of the mermaid and tucked your arms in as the skinsuit quickly closed around you. All of your sight was interrupted as the skinsuit closed around your helmet. Anxious for vision, you stretch your arms upwards, squeaking of latex accompanying you as you find the arms of the mermaid. After reaching the fingertips, you strain your chest upwards to reach the head. You tried to push your breasts down as you cram you helmet through the thin neck. Finally reaching an area with more room, you find your eyes align with those of the mermaid. Adjusting your huge assets you begin to turn to the mirror as you feel something tumble off your head. Looking in your lap, you find a pearl necklace and a sky-blue bra that doesn&#39;t quite cover your breasts that well, acting more as a cradle for them. Fastening it around your chest and clasping the necklace around your neck, you turn to look at the mirror. <br />
<br />
In the mirror, a well-endowed mermaid with a charming smile greeted you. She was calmly reclining on her place, looking at you with what seemed to be curiosity. You watched entranced as she slowly lifted a hand in between her legs. She held it there for awhile, as if testing you before returning her hands next to her on the pedestal. However, when she tried to lift her hands again, she found that she couldn&#39;t lift them again.<br />
<br />
You snap out of your trance-like state as you strain to lift your hands. What&#39;s more, your body that&#39;s in contact with the pedestal seems to be stuck as well. You flail around as suddenly the pedestal seems to shake. You soon begin to sink into the ground as you and the pedestal descend below the floor. You watch transfixed as you rush through a tunnel only to find yourself in...</p>
