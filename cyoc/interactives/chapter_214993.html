<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, you wake up and head into the shower. Asher did have a point last night, It wasn’t proper to be wearing such a mess on your fur. Meanwhile, your boyfriend would begin to get dressed in some proper clothing for this morning. He walked out of your room and had noticed that family picture of yours. The faces of the three girls had wavered overnight and had been replaced with those of two beautiful vixens like their mother and a lovely badger sow like her brother and late father. It was apparent that after Asher had changed the parents, it had indirectly caused the girls to change. Not to mention it had somewhat of an effect on Benjamin as well, whose handsome black stripes became tipped with strawberry blond after he changed Whitney.<br />
<br />
- - Let’s switch to a third person perspective as Benjamin is once again out of the room. - -<br />
<br />
“Top of the morning to you,” Asher greeted the vixen.<br />
<br />
“Did you and Benjamin sleep well tonight?” Whitney asked.<br />
<br />
“It was a splendid slumber.” he chuckled, looking back to what he did with Benjamin that night “Say, fancy a full English breakfast? I can make some proper tea to go with it.” <br />
“Why would that be such a kind gesture of you, Asher?” She replied. “It’s kind of you to make breakfast for our family.”<br />
<br />
Asher was preparing to get ready to make breakfast for the family, grabbing some ceramic pans, and placing them on the stove. He then pulled out some eggs, bacon, sausage, some tomatoes, mushrooms, as well as some baked beans and toast. All the ingredients for a proper English breakfast. As he started cooking the eggs and meat on the stove, the delicious aroma filled the house, awakening the girls from their slumber. Grace was first to come down, followed by Zoe and Lucy. They had a confused look on their faces. How did they become anthro animals? How did their house get so grand and elegant? Who was that badger cooking breakfast? And who was the vixen sitting at the dining table? <br />
<br />
Grace, now a proper badger herself, walked up to Asher and tried to ask these questions. He then began to focus on her, complimenting the beautiful markings along her face. Dark stripes tinted red proudly ran from her ears down to her nose , ones proper for a badger sow like her. <br />
<br />
“Such an intelligent, smart, young lady.”  He tells the 19 year old.<br />
<br />
Memories began to replace her previous human life. Grace, the youngest of Whitney and Gregory’s four children, was an intelligent lady, having been accepted into a prestigious school in the UK and studying there, despite now living in America with her family, she had been one of the brightest minds in the family, with beauty to go along with it.<br />
<br />
“Grace” Whitney tells her daughter. “Why don’t you take a seat at the table?” <br />
<br />
“I’d be glad to, mother.” She says in her new posh voice, then sits next to her mother. <br />
<br />
The two vixens, Lucy and Zoe were next to see what Asher had been cooking for them. The foxes had lovely bright orange fur with touches of grey along the back, which they got from their badger father. He greets the foxes with a smile, “The both of you are going to love what I’m making for you, I’ll make some cuppas for all of you to go with it.” Memories flowed through the minds of the two vixens, both of them had loving boyfriends like Benjamin had, being the older two siblings at 23 and 24 respectively, they remembered most of their life back in London, and had led proper lives. Zoe always liked to help people, which inspired her to become a nurse to heal the sick and wounded in London, and that spirit carried on when she came to the U.S. Meanwhile, Lucy was an avid cook herself, and she would usually cook for her siblings and mother. She remained standing to help Asher with breakfast.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes of cooking the breakfast. Asher then set the table for the family, complete with plates, utensils, and a cuppa for everyone on the side. The WC door would then open…<br />
<br />
- - Returning to the second person perspective as Benjamin enters the scene.- -<br />
You were in your best clothes, silver slacks, a white dress shirt, a black vest, and a red tie after a proper wash in the shower and you preened your handsome fur after drying off. The smell of a proper, full english breakfast filled your nostrils as your fluffy tail wagged happily as you walked down the halls. A proper day begins with a proper meal, made by a proper gentleman like Asher. You took a seat next to your loving boyfriend pecking him on the cheek, his whiskers tickling your nose as you smiled at each other. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, sir, this looks delicious,&quot; Lucy said, eyeing the food on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, ma’am. I hope you enjoy it,&quot; Asher said, looking pleased with himself.<br />
<br />
As they all took their seats at the table, Asher began to serve everyone. He properly topped crispy bacon, sausage and scrambled eggs with mushrooms and sliced tomatoes onto each plate and placed a slice of toasted bread on the side with baked beans. The tea kettle whistled as he took it off the stove, pouring everyone’s cuppa.<br />
<br />
&quot;This looks amazing, Asher. Thank you so much,&quot; You said with a grin on your muzzle, taking a bite of your eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;It really is delicious. You&#39;re a fantastic cook,&quot; Grace added, nodding in agreement.<br />
<br />
Asher blushed under his fur, clearly pleased with the compliments. &quot;Thank you, I&#39;m glad you all like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they continued to eat, the conversation flowed easily. They talked about their plans for the day and caught up on what they had been doing during the week. It was clear to see that Asher fit in well with your  family, and they all enjoyed spending time with him. With that, every house in the neighborhood expanded to be beautiful and elegant, a proper upper class suburb for a proper, splendid, posh British family.<br />
<br />
After they had finished eating, they helped to clear away the dishes. Asher insisted on doing the washing up, and Benjamin&#39;s sisters were surprised by how helpful he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks again for breakfast, Asher. You&#39;re a proper cook and a proper gentleman,&quot; Zoe said in her Received Pronunciation accent, giving him a grateful smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was my pleasure. I had a great time,&quot; Asher replied, smiling back.<br />
<br />
As they said their goodbyes, you and Asher headed out the door, hand in hand. It was clear to see that Asher had made a great impression on your family, and he was quickly becoming  beloved by your mum and sisters…</p>
