<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Jack was shaken awake. He sat up quickly, looking for the culprit and finding Brady sitting in the bed next to him. “Come on Jack, let’s go work out!” Jack smiled, excited at the idea of working out, and hopped out of bed quickly before realizing things had once again changed. He walked over to the closet to pick out workout clothes, but couldn’t find anything that would work. “Hey, can I borrow from you, bro?” Brady nodded and rushed out of the room. Bro? Jack was confused for a second before he recalled that Brady was his twin brother. Soon after, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror - he looked identical to Brady, with large 3-year-old-sized pecs, visible abs, and arms and legs that looked equally large. If he didn’t know this was a mirror, he probably would have assumed he had a poster of Brady on his closet door.<br />
Brady came back in and tossed a wad of clothes to Jack, who caught it and excitedly began dressing himself in his twins’ clothes. He put on his brothers’ black spandex shorts, which formed tightly to his young yet muscular thighs and a matching spandex tank top with a Mike brand on the chest that hugged his tiny (but large compared to his size) pecs and was tight enough around the stomach to reveal his abs. Looking in the mirror, Jack looked like a 3-year-old version of a hulking personal trainer. Jack smirked at himself in the mirror. He knew this was the product of the Glitch, but that didn’t change the fact that he was proud of the body he had. He looked over at his twin, who wore the same proud smirk on his face and had the same clothes on. The two of them looked like completely identical heavily muscled children. The twins began to sprint down the hallway toward the garage where the mini-gym was set up, racing each other. <br />

Nicole woke that morning at the sound of her twin boys racing down the hall. She groaned as she sat up, but couldn’t help but have a small smile as she thought of how proud she was of her boys and their work ethic at such a young age. She stood up and moved over to the bathroom, hooking herself into her bra and back brace that she had grown accustomed to wearing. After she got fully dressed, she began to make her way out of her room when she heard a snoring coming from her bed. She roller her eyes and smacked Harry’s feet to wake him up. “Oh come on, Harrison! Get up! Any why are you in my bed?” Harry growled from under the covers and hid even further within them. “Mom, stop… Jack was in my fucking bed last night so I came in here since you had room… and stop fucking calling me ‘Harrison’, it makes me sound like a bitch-ass nerd.”<br />
Nicole was appalled. Harrison was her 20-year-old son, who had failed out of college and moved back in. He usually smelled of weed, though he didn’t at the moment, shockingly. He definitely had a decently muscular build, it was obvious he stopped caring for himself and some of that muscle had begun to deflate. <br />
“You should try to follow the example your brothers are setting. They’re so motivated and they work so hard and you’ve lost five different jobs in as many months because you’re too busy getting high.” Harry growled again, causing Nicole to roll her eyes as she exited the room.<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <br />
After a couple hours, the twins finally came back into the house from their workout, both of their shirts left behind in the gym. They paraded into the dining room coated in sweat, setting themselves down at the table next to each other, flexing to each other as if it was a contest of who had the biggest pump despite them both performing the same intense workout. Nicole placed a large protein-filled meal in front of both boys and they immediately became fixated on their breakfast. Nicole sat across from them and watched them eat, letting them begin to slow before starting a conversation with them. “So how was the workout today boys?” Jack quickly jumped up in his seat. “Look what I can do Mom!” Jack bounced his pecs for his mom, who had leaned back in her chair and taken out her phone to take pictures. “No fair, I can do that too!” Brady said as he followed suit, both boys now flexing for their mother. Nicole chuckled. “There’s always something new and amazing for you boys, isn’t there?” The twins nodded in agreement before they sat back down in their chairs. <br />
Nicole spoke again, “So you two begin high school next week! Are you excited? My two prodigies, I’m so proud of you!” They knew, in the back of their heads, that this was probably the knowledge that Jack had previously and had split between the twins, but they didn’t care - for all they knew, the twins were two amazing bodybuilder boys with high-school level intelligence. <br />
Brady seemed a little down about that. “Yeah… I’m excited and all, but I wish we could join the wrestling team… but we’re still too small.” Jack also pouted a bit. Nicole reached over and ruffled their sweat-coated hair. “You two will grow up eventually, just you wait.” This seemed to perk up the twins just a bit.<br />
Soon after, Nicole had a thought. “Hey Brady, can you go upstairs to my room and get your brother down here? His food is getting cold. Brady bounced up and ran up the stairs, disappearing, leaving Jack alone with Nicole. <br />
“Hey Jack, how are you holding up with this Glitch? Being a single mother of three isn’t easy but… I want to know you’re okay too.” Jack smiled back at Nicole. “Don’t worry Mom, I’m very happy this time around! Plus, I have a twin brother to share it all with, so it’s not too bad!” He then thought of his older brother, the former lawyer, now pothead, and gained a little clarity from the new reality. “Don’t be too tough on Harrison, though? Not like this was his choice… Plus he’s an awesome older brother at least.” This shocked Nicole and put a small smile on her face. “Good point. Maybe if we all help, we can get him back to the man he’s supposed to be, yeah?” Jack nodded energetically and turned to go help his twin get Harry out of bed.</p>
