<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Huff was more than a little angry.<br />
<br />
Somehow, the Chronivac knew about Sarah. He’d almost married her. Likely would have, but their first child was stillborn. She had wanted to name him Sebastian, which was a pussy name, in Damian’s opinion. Damian had wanted to name the baby…Axel. Like the lead singer of Guns’N’Flowers, which was totally badass. <br />
<br />
But she’d had a miscarriage and then they, well…their relationship didn’t survive. She wanted someone ‘more mature’, whatever the fuck that meant, and he’d decided to keep playing the increasingly shallow pool of eligible women. Then, a year and a half later, she died in a freak four-wheeler accident when a semi hit as she was crossing the highway.<br />
<br />
How did the Chronivac know? Was Axel really his son, now? This wasn’t supposed to happen! He was supposed to be torturing Jeff by making him into a badass wolf.<br />
<br />
“Dad?” Axel asked.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff nearly jumped out of his skin. He turned and saw his…son…standing next to him, hands covering his groin. His red rocket had slipped out of its sheathe and was merrily throbbing out in the open air, filling the room with horny wolf musk.<br />
<br />
“Put your dick away!” Mr. Huff growled.<br />
<br />
“I can’t!” Axel whined. “It won’t go down and people keep looking at me!”<br />
<br />
“You-” Mr Huff paused, then a lazy grin spread across his face and he pulled out his phone. “You’d better learn to appreciate it.”<br />
<br />
He finished typing in his sentence and pressed enter. Axel shivered, but continued whining. His cock wobbled and grew an inch, no longer fully covered by the young pup’s hands.<br />
<br />
“You’re going to stay erect until you get over your embarrassment!”<br />
<br />
“D-Dad?” Axel whined. “B-but-”<br />
<br />
“No buts!” Mr huff crossed his arms. “Put your hands down! You’ve got a big cock, let the world see it!”<br />
<br />
Axel’s paws dropped and he walked off, tail tucked between his legs. Mr. Huff grinned, his own tail wagging. He’d best get used to it anyways. Why would an anthro wolf be embarrassed by a boner? Damian chuckled to himself. His son was such a moron.<br />
<br />
Now he had to deal with Mr. Higgins. <br />
<br />
Brad Higgins was an older man with a big belly who clearly wanted to relieve his halcyon days as a star football player. Damian could relate. Technically, Damian could literally do just that if he wanted to. In Damian’s opinion, the old man was an alright coach. He and Mr. Silvers-the gym teacher-ran the football team. Mr. Silvers was a fit man in his 60’s, close to retirement, with a handlebar mustache. Both of them took cues from each other when it came to decisions on who was allowed on the varsity teams.<br />
<br />
So, really, he had to deal with both of them. It would be a lot of work, but making sure Axel was happy was his number one priority. Mr. Huff blinked and shook his head. That-that wasn’t right. He was forcing the pup to play against his will, man him up!<br />
<br />
He got up at the next free period and let the class do as it wanted. A first for Mr. Huff, who often forced his students to do homework and sit silently. Sacrifices were necessary if his son was going to be hap-he caught himself from finishing the thought and ground his teeth. Stupid Chronivac, making him care about him and Sarah’s child.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff shuddered and shook his head, trying to shake the strange thoughts. He could feel memories of raising the pup, bathing him, teaching him to fish. Lovely memories danced just at the edges of his mind. If he dared relax, he’d let them all in. And then he’d actually <i>care</I> about his son.<br />
<br />
He saw Axel ducking through the halls, using his backpack as a shield. A few jocks were following him, mocking him relentlessly. Mr. Huff’s hackles raised. No son of his would get picked on like that!<br />
<br />
He scanned the two jocks into the Chronivac for later punishment and inputted some setting for the rest of the school. He pressed enter. Reality rippled out around him. He kept walking to the gym and entered the locker room. In the far back of the room, next to the bathroom and showers, was the coach’s office.<br />
<br />
Mr. Higgins was leaning against the desk, fat ass pressed against it. Mr. Silvers was standing back a few feet, looking at his computer and having an intense conversation with the fat man.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff knock politely on the door. He could be polite when he wanted something. He wasn’t always a dick. Everyone knew you caught more flies with honey than vinegar.<br />
<br />
The two men looked over at him. He smelt…annoyance at his presence. Unacceptable. They should fear him.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on, teach?” Mr. Higgins asked.<br />
<br />
“I need you to put Axel in.”<br />
<br />
“No can do, that would be favoritism.” Mr. Silvers didn’t even look away form the screen.<br />
<br />
“Yup, what he said.” Mr. Higgins waved his coffee mug vaguely in agreement.<br />
<br />
“What are you watchin’?” Mr. Huff asked Silvers, trying to be polite.<br />
<br />
“Rival team’s game. Want anything else? We’re busy.” The old man stroke his handlebar mustache.<br />
<br />
Mr. Huff glowered and pulled out his phone.<br />
<br />
Time to make a few changes.</p>
