<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Liberty looked at Monique. She never hated anyone, ever. She always saw the good in people, and Monique was no exception. She’d seen Monique be incredibly kind, caring, respectful. But once she got competitive, she was relentless.<br />
When Liberty began to rise as a star, Monique treated her similarly. At the time, Monique wasn’t as big of an icon as she was now, but she treated her iconography like it was her entire world. Without it, she really was nothing. It defined her entire identity. She almost couldn’t blame her for acting how she did… but the way she treated Jewell was just plain cruel.<br />
Liberty, on the other hand, was a country girl. She’d grown up in the country, and whenever she wasn’t on tour or doing interviews, she liked to spend her time in the countryside. When she was there, she wasn’t a star, she was just Liberty Williams.<br />
<br />
“Lib?” Monique said, giving her an impatient look, “the dice? What’s on them?” She asked again,<br />
“Right,” Liberty said, snapping out of her trance. She leant over to the other side of the table to see the numbers, “one and three, so four total,”<br />
“I’m not that much of a ditz, Lib,” Monique said, “I can do basic math,” she scoffed,<br />
“Uhm, Mon,” Liberty said, brushing off the last comment, hoping to ask Monique a question, “can we just talk about—”<br />
“Shame it wasn’t a double,” she interrupted, watching as her piece moved four places on its own, “would’ve loved to give her a little fright!”<br />
“…that,” Liberty started,<br />
“What about it?” Monique said, clearly not that interested as she swiped a card from the top of the deck,<br />
“I just think, she’s clearly very self-conscious of her body. For you to keep pestering her when she’s dealing with it. We could at the very least just give her twenty minutes to gather herself,”<br />
“Sure,” Monique said, “why don’t we finish the game first, then she’ll be back to normal,”<br />
“I don’t know if… I think it’s…” Liberty said, looking for the box for the instructions,<br />
“Now shush!” Monique said, “the words are appearing,”<br />
<br />
The card in her hand suddenly accumulated a string of words. Two lines, as usual, all in a blood red text that seemed to bleed right into the paper. She cleared her throat before reading it aloud,<br />
“Perhaps the constant insults will cease,<br />
Why not make your famous feature increase.”<br />
<br />
“Interesting,” Monique said, “whatever could it be referring to?” She questioned genuinely. She looked herself all over. Liberty has already worked out what was going to change,<br />
“Uhm,” she started, hesitating a little, “I think… your lips,” she stated, lifting her finger to point at them,<br />
“My lips!?” Monique said, gasping. She then thought for a moment, “I suppose they are my most ‘famous’ feature, but they’re absolutely natural!” She justified. She placed a finger on her top lip. They had started growing,<br />
“Monique!” Liberty yelled, watching as Monique’s lips began to swell like a bee had just stung them,<br />
“MY PERFECT LIPS!” Monique yelled, jumping out of her seat and rushing to a mirror behind her. Her already large lips, a glossy red from her lipstick, were growing more and more! From a natural very large, to an almost fake looking huge! She stared at them, poking them endlessly, hoping that it would do something. Anything!<br />
After close to a minute of endless swelling, they’d grown more than double in size. Monique couldn’t look away from the mirror, stuck in awe of her severely unnaturally large kissers.<br />
<br />
Liberty was the only one left at the table. She sat there, knowing not to stare at Monique unless she explicitly implied it. Jewell was still in the bathroom, probably still dealing with her own changes. In fact, aside from turning back to eighteen (which wasn’t anything close to bad), the worst she’d have to deal with was her clothing changing. She’d clearly been very lucky.<br />
She took it all in for a moment. When it really came down to it, there were still at least five more rounds of this game left, no less. In fact, realistically there were probably more. With thirty-five tiles for each player, that meant that Liberty still had twenty-six more tiles to cover.<br />
Monique had moved eighteen spaces, including her last turn.<br />
Jewell was on sixteen.<br />
Liberty knew that if she wanted everything to turn back to normal, they had to finish the game. And if Monique and Jewell were preoccupied, that’s fine. But she wasn’t, it was her turn, and the game wasn’t going to play itself. She took a deep breath, then took the dice, shuffled them in her hands, and threw them onto the table.<br />
<br />
It was a good roll, managing to land two solid sixes! She felt fairly proud of herself for achieving the highest possible roll.<br />
She picked up a card, watching as the words began to manifest themselves onto it. She decided to read it in her head,<br />
“A girl so sweet, always a fan,<br />
How about the country-girl gets a Tan.”<br />
Liberty sighed, knowing her very nice and pale complexion was going to be altered. Although she knew that compared to Jewell and Monique, she was only getting good cards.<br />
She looked herself over, mostly staring at her arm. From her fingertips, she watched as her skin began to change, to darken into a golden tan. It covered her arm, travelling like a stream of water. She noticed more of her tan appearing at her chest, spreading out like ink bleeding into paper across her entire torso. As the rest of her body tanned, she ran her finger along her forearm. Her skin felt very healthy. She’d definitely lucked out with her changes, but was very much prepared for the worst!<br />
<br />
“Wow,” Monique said, slumping herself down on her chair at the table, “you really went ahead and rolled without asking,”<br />
“I just… I thought that if we’re going to—” Liberty tried to explain, but Monique interrupted,<br />
“It’s whatever, I get it,” she said, finally sympathising a little, “I just want this to be over. I want my hair back, I want my lips back,”<br />
“Thanks, Monique,” Liberty said, looking over herself as her change finished,<br />
“So what did you roll?”<br />
“Two sixes! Pretty good, right…” Liberty said, but as she praised her dice-throwing ability, it suddenly clicked in her head,<br />
“You rolled a double?” Monique stated, a smirk appearing across her expanded lips,<br />
“Oh no…” Liberty said. She quickly twisted her head towards the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
“NOOO!!!” Jewell screamed, echoing across the entire house. How did Liberty not realise what she’d done! She felt so horrible. She had no idea what she’d done to the poor girl inside. But she didn’t need to.<br />
<br />
The door burst open. Out stepped Jewell.<br />
The sweater she had borrowed, once struggling to hold in her engorged breasts had inevitably failed to hold the rest of her in.<br />
No longer were her breasts the largest asset of hers, but her belly now stuck out further than them both. Not to mention, her thighs, her hips, even her ass was inflated to make her look even more like a blimp. Her arms were fatter, her waist, her face. She’d developed a solid double chin as well.<br />
“WHAT is your problem!?” She yelled directly at Monique. Liberty stood up from her chair, seeing as Jewell stepped towards Monique, her body jiggling with every step, “I don’t know what I’ve done for you to continue to treat me like this!?” She stated, eyes welling up with tears. Monique looked mortified by the accusation, “why ME!? You couldn’t have waited until I was done before you rolled the dice? Why did you even invite me!?”<br />
“It wasn’t her!” Liberty shouted, allowing Jewell to hear the truth,<br />
“No it wasn’t!” Jewell yelled back at her one (and only) respected peer in the room, “she invited me! I have the email!”<br />
“NO!” Liberty yelled back, using a much louder, much angrier voice to get through to Jewell. She went silent, confused. Liberty let out a few breaths, the adrenaline running through her veins, “I rolled the double,” she stated, closing her eyes as she looked down to the floor, “it’s my fault…”<br />
Jewell looked at Liberty with shock. A face of disappointment, of betrayal. A tear rolled down her face, “I thought… I thought we were friends, Liberty!” She said, angrily,<br />
“We are!” Liberty said, lifting her head once more, “the only way this game is going to end, for us to turn back to normal, is if we finish it!”<br />
<br />
Jewell looked at Liberty with sadness in her eyes, as it suddenly shifted to anger, “you’re right,” Jewell said, “it’s only going to end if we keep on playing.” She looked really upset and angry, “so why not?” She said, a false smile appearing on her face. She stomped to the table, her body jiggling as she did.<br />
The sweater was being held on by one button between her breasts and her belly, and with every step she took, then button shook and shifted. As she got to the table, she swiped the double sixes off of the table, shook them in her hands, and rolled them right towards the centre of the table.<br />
As she let go of the dice, extending her arm forward, the button finally flew right off. It shot across the table, barely missing Monique’s head. As it flew behind her, it hit perfectly on a small vase in on the counter. It made a light, but audible chime as it did. Like a bell being struck.<br />
<br />
As the chime faded out, the dice came to a halt, stopping finally and leaving their faces open. Jewell grabbed a card from the stack, not bothering to look at her dice. Liberty took a look, it was a four and a six. The words began to manifest on the card, but before she could read it, Monique spoke,<br />
“Well, newbie, I can tell you it’s not a double,” Jewell struck her an angry look, Monique raising her eyebrows, “sorry, puffy,”<br />
“Excuse me?” Jewell said, taking her eyes off of the card, looking back at Monique,<br />
“Is it all the marshmallow fluff pouring out of your ears?” Monique said, teasing,<br />
“Funny coming from someone with lips the size of Kansas,” she stated,<br />
“OH!” Monique said, clapping on her own, letting out a deep chuckle, “you really are angry, aren’t you. Keep it up, and you’ll be as big as me one day,” she stated, then said, “well, in more ways than one,” she giggled to herself.<br />
Jewell decided not to indulge her any further, looking away from her, back to the card. She didn’t even glance at Liberty, still feeling betrayed by her. Liberty had noticed this, but didn’t say anything. Obviously.<br />
<br />
“A young girl, so plump and thick,<br />
Lets fix that brand with black lipstick.”<br />
Jewell placed the card on the table, face down. She took a deep breath, then out again.<br />
She slowly approached the same mirror that Monique had been looking into, taking herself in before her incoming makeover.<br />
<br />
First, of course, Jewell watched as her lips darkened, covered in a deep coating of rich, black lipstick. They were dark, but had a perfect shine to them. They were very glamorous, aside from their darker colour.<br />
Next, to continue the trend of makeup, her eyeliner thickened, as did a deep and mysterious eyeshadow. Aside from that, her face remained the same. However, that couldn’t be said for her hair. Her blue hair untying itself from the two buns at the top of her head, it fell down one side of her face, shortening as it did. The blue shifted to a strong black as the hair turned shorter and shorter, becoming lightly buzzed on one side, the other growing until it touched her left shoulder. It covered her left eye as well, making her now blatantly obvious goth-inspired getup even more apparent.<br />
As her head came to end of it’s changes, her clothing began to manifest itself. The first thing to appear was black and silver choker around her neck, in the centre was a mystical looking purple gemstone that shined as the light touched it.<br />
Her torn apart sweater began to shift. It’s red and white knitted fabric became a fairly thick, tighter material coloured an expected black. It continued to change, the sleeves shrinking into two straps over her shoulders. As the middle of the sweater began to repair itself, especially over her bust, the top continued to be very low-cut, accentuating her bust significantly. To add to this, her tight bra expanded, finally being comfortable over her engorged breasts, however it did morph itself into a push-up bra, making her breasts even more accentuated in the newer tank-top. The edges of her bra appeared, barely cut off from the edges of the tank, showing off their dark purple colour. Although the tank-top had grown to fit Jewell more comfortably, which she did appreciate, she did notice that with her enlarged belly, the top didn’t cover it all the way, leaving the middle of her belly poking out from beneath.<br />
Along her arms, two long, black gloves made of a thin fabric appeared, spreading right up to where her breasts sat. Both wrists covered themselves in black and silver jewellery, along with a few red rings on her right hand.<br />
Her shorts, which had been torn from her weight gain, fixed themselves, expanding to fit over her increased body. This also accounted for her underwear underneath her outfit, which increased to fit her. However, her modest underwear shifted to a tight purple thong, which Jewell was not in any way used to. Her shorts got shorter, very short. They lifted higher up, covering most of her belly button. Belts and chains attached themselves to the shorts, making her appear even more gothic than before. They completed the look and weren’t too uncomfortable, but were far from Jewell’s style.<br />
Underneath the belts and shorts, a pair skull and rose inspired tights rolled up from her feet, making her legs appear darker, but a solid black colour where the artwork appeared.<br />
Her final change, at her feet, were a pair of large high-heeled boots, lifted just underneath her knee. The boots were black and definteily made of a high quality leather.<br />
And with the boots, the change was completed.<br />
New hair, a new style, finally some clothes that fit! Jewell couldn’t help but feel relieved that this was all her transformation entailed.<br />
Her took her finger and wiped the lipstick. Like she thought, it didn’t smudge. It was actually on her skin… at least until the game was over.<br />
<br />
She looked back at Liberty, who was staring at the table. She decided to approach her and speak, “I’m sorry, Liberty,” she started,<br />
“Don’t be,” Liberty replied, “it’s my fault,”<br />
“It’s not,”<br />
“It is!” She cried, “I swear, I just want the game to end. I haven’t had any terrible changes yet, and even I want this to end!”<br />
“Liberty please, we just…”<br />
“Need to finish the game,” Monique chimed in. No sarcasm. No insult.<br />
“Yeah.” Jewell said, “the rules say that at the end of the game, we all return to normal, right?”<br />
“It does,” Liberty says, “and the winner gets a single wish to use however they want,”<br />
“Wait…” Monique said, “so we don’t have to wish ourselves back to normal?”<br />
“I don’t think so…” Liberty says, “let me check,” she says, reaching over to find the rules,<br />
“We need to be really clear about this,” Jewell starts, getting both women’s attention, “if, at the end of the game, we’re not returned to normal, we have to agree that we’ll all wish ourselves back to how we were. None of us can live like this…” Jewell says, taking a look at Liberty, “well… by the end of the game, none of us will be able to live like his forever. So have to make a deal,”<br />
“I agree,” Monique says, shockingly raising her hand out for Jewell to shake,<br />
“I mean, obviously I agree,” Liberty says, raising her hand as well,<br />
“Good,” Jewell says, relived. She takes Liberty’s hand and shakes. She hesitates, but takes Monique’s hand and shake it as well. Liberty and Monique look at each other, and shake each other’s hand as.<br />
<br />
“Great,” Jewell says, “now let’s finish this goddamned game!” She says, handing the dice to Monique…</p>
