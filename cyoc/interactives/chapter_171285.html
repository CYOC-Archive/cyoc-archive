<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mason entered class a couple minutes late on the day of the assignment.  He didn’t attract much attention because he had Vince make up an excuse to cover up for his tardiness.  <br />
<br />
“Did you go up already?” Mason whispered.<br />
<br />
“Really? No wonder Cobalt only gave me a C.  Are the ears really that subtle?”<br />
<br />
“So you went with an Elf then?”<br />
<br />
Vince nodded “Cobalt gave me a C+ because I “hardly look any different.”  When he gave us this assignment he said  magical creatures get extra points, how was I supposed to know he meant it had to be some crazy monster?!”  Vince crossed his arms in frustration.  “Anyways, Isaac is up now.  He went through with his animal part idea and is giving himself monkey feet.  Don’t ask me why...”<br />
<br />
Mason turned his attention towards the front of the classroom where Isaac had just finished his spell.<br />
<br />
Isaac gave a smug grin as he scratched his chin with his changed feet.  “Ta-da! 4 hands are better than one am I right?”<br />
<br />
Cobalt smiled.  “Prehensile feet, quite useful indeed.  But can you explain the other primate traits?”<br />
<br />
“Huh?”<br />
<br />
Isaac froze when the realized what had happened. He had sprouted a full on tail!  His felt around his head and face and felt his ears had also grown bigger.  <br />
<br />
“Solid B Isaac, you did indeed complete your desired transformation but your recklessness added several undesired traits.  Now please take your seat and discover the rest of your accidentally changes after class.” Cobalt scribbled some notes as he continued to go down his list of students. <br />
<br />
“Ah finally Mr. Thorne is here, maybe you could show the rest of these students what REAL magic is.”<br />
<br />
“Sure thing Professor, but I have a small request if it’s not too much trouble.”<br />
<br />
“A request?  Does this mean we’ll be moving outside for your demonstration?” Cobalt said with a hint excitement in his voice.<br />
<br />
Mason chuckled.  It seemed even Professor Cobalt was expecting a grand transformation into a dragon or some other massive creature. <br />
<br />
“No no, I just wanted to let you know that my spell is a bit on the “risqué” side, is nudity alright?”<br />
<br />
The classroom began to chat amongst themselves.  Just the thought of Mason nude had some of them almost drooling.<br />
<br />
“By all means.  Clothes would in fact just obscure the view of your magic.”<br />
<br />
“One more thing, it’s actually a spell meant for two.  No magic assistance from the other party though.  Is that alright?” Mason asked. <br />
<br />
“Hmm, a bit informal to request this last minute but I’ll allow it since you say they won’t be assisting you magically.  Now who exactly is your other subject?” <br />
<br />
“Wendall Hughs.” Mason casually declared. <br />
<br />
“WENDALL?!” The class erupted. <br />
<br />
- Did he say Wendall? <br />
<br />
-Since when do those two get along?<br />
<br />
-I would kill to be Mason’s assistant!<br />
<br />
Wendall Hughes was a quiet and somewhat awkward student.  He had ginger hair, a pale complexion, and was very skinny.  He often blushed so red that he earned the infamous nickname  “Twinker bell,” Tinker bell’s goofy looking cousin.  He was a shy boy who tried his best to stay out of trouble.  Everyone was scratching their heads wondering why Mason needed HIS help of all people. <br />
<br />
Nudity might seem a bit much for just a classroom demonstration but that didn’t stop Mason from quickly undressing in front of the entire class.  He stood just as unbothered in the nude as if he was fully dressed. <br />
<br />
Wendall on the other hand did his best to cover his groin.  It was clear that he was uncomfortable by his iconic red faced blush.  The students began to giggle as he nervously shuffled over to the front of the class to stand by the school hunk.<br />
<br />
“Whenever you’re ready Mr. Thorne.” Cobalt said leaning back into a large chair.<br />
<br />
Mason nodded as he pulled out his wand.  He held it vertically between both of his hands and began to concentrate on the spell.  Most warlocks had to verbally recite spells but Mason had been studying mental magic for quite some time now.  A bright blue smoke began to radiate around both boys.<br />
<br />
Mason stayed calm and kept both hands firmly placed around his wand as the magic washed over him.  He could feel his facial structure shift as he developed an ever so slight overbite and his strong jawline began to soften a little.  His normally neatly styled chestnut brown hair began to lengthen into Wendall’s shaggy, hard to tame, red locks.   <br />
<br />
Wendall couldn’t believe his eyes as he felt his flat stomach begin to develop muscle mass.  He began to feel some discomfort as his stature began to increase.  He was soon plagued by Instantaneous growth pains as his height increased. The freckled in his body began to fade one by one.<br />
<br />
Mason could feel the magic began to move further down his body to his pelvic region.  The feeling of the magic was euphoric, he desperately wanted to grab hold of his penis before the transformation was complete, but he restrained himself.  His tightened his grip on his wand once again as he felt his thick cock began to slim down. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Wendall tried his best to stifle his lustful groans as his own cock began to take on Mason’s traits.  His balls began to expand and were soon nestled between a pair of toned thighs.  <br />
<br />
The brilliant glow of Mason’s wand began to dim, which finally marked the completion of the spell.  Before anyone could speak, the sound of clapping cut through the room. <br />
<br />
“Bravo! Excellent work Mason!  Or should I say Wendall?”<br />
<br />
Mason took a deep breath as he tried to push his fatigue behind him. <br />
“Whichever is easier for you Professor!”  He gleefully replied, successfully hiding the fact that the spell took a lot more out of him than he anticipated. <br />
<br />
The professor gave Mason a playful grin. “A bit cold, isn’t it?”<br />
<br />
Mason was confused by the professor’s comment.  It didn’t seem feel noticeably cold or drafty?  His confusion was short lived when he noticed the professor gaze briefly dart down.<br />
<br />
“Oh I see, very cheeky professor. But I’ll have you know it’s not the size of the wand that matters, it’s how you use it!”<br />
<br />
“Haha, quite right my boy!  I appreciate the optimism.  Though it seems your choice of subject was a bit unorthodox, might I ask why you chose young Mr. Hughes as your subject?”<br />
<br />
“Glad you asked professor.  I asked Wendall here to assist me because our bodies were so vastly different.  The stark contrast made for an excellent challenge.  I believe you already narrowed in on one difference.”  Mason said, standing up straight, showing off his little penis.  Poor Wendall’s previous attempt to keep some modesty at the start of the spell was thwarted by what seemed like Mason’s unwavering self confidence.  <br />
<br />
The students were all speechless at what they were currently witnessing.  It was crazy to see the usually timid Wendall making such casual banter with the professor, and in the nude no less!  <br />
<br />
It was also pretty miraculous to see a sheepish Mason off to the side, trying (and failing) to conceal his new endowment behind his hands.  <br />
<br />
“Well excellent work!  And do pardon my comments Wendall.  I truly meant no offense.”<br />
<br />
“Non taken professor. Can I please just.. um... get dressed now?”<br />
<br />
“Why in such a hurry?  I would enjoy the freedom if I were you.  Come here and let’s get a better comparison.”<br />
<br />
Wendall nervously shuffled over closer to Mason. <br />
<br />
“Please face each other boys, and keep your hands to your side.  Wouldn’t want to obscure the view now would we?” <br />
Mason turned to face his old body.  It felt so odd to need to look up at someone now, much less at his own face.  He could tell that Wendall was doing his best to avoid eye contact.  Probably because he was ashamed of facing Mason with his own throbbing cock.<br />
<br />
“As you can see students.  Perfect transformation!  Every detail of their appearance has been swapped.  And it seems Mr. Hughes is a bit excited about this judging from that erection.  Now that’s quite wand!  It seems to be around 8 inches full mast.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry sorry! it’s just-“<br />
<br />
“Don’t be embarrassed my boy, It’s not everyday your get transformed into such a fine young man!”<br />
<br />
Mason would’ve been more flattered by the professor comments if he was actually currently in the body receiving them.  But temporary humiliation is just that, temporary.  “Oh stop it professor you’re making he blush!” He said trying to reinforce the idea that he was unbothered. <br />
<br />
“Just let me give one last piece of praise.  You went above and beyond with this assignment.  Not many can perform such a flawless transformation, much less manage to transform 2 subjects simultaneously!  Now you two you better hurry along and get dressed.  You and your classmates have an interesting week ahead of you!”</p>
