<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony snuck past his mother who was napping on the couch. He was horny from watching the transformed girls, Alyssa and Presley, on the bus fucking again and he wanted to hardcore fap in his room. Plus he had gotten his first handjob from a girl today, so that was another thing that got him randy.<br />
<br />
Tony wasn’t very close with his mother. She worked three part time jobs to support the family of two, so she didn’t have the time to spend with Tony. Perhaps that was the reason for Tony becoming a loner and a transformation pervert, too much time on the internet. While his mother’s hard life weighed heavily on him, Tony was riding on his transformation and first handjob high and only thought of sexual things at the moment.<br />
<br />
Wait a second, Tony had the app on his phone, so why not use it on his mother?<br />
<br />
Looking over his mother, he could conclude she was cute for a lady of her age. She was no milf, but she was cute. He could tell that when she was younger she was one of those cute neighborhood girl types. She looked dead tired though, even in her sleeping state. <br />
<br />
The sentence generated on the app showed, “Tony’s tired mother is worried about how to make ends meet.”<br />
<br />
Well first thing first, adjectives. With one hand on his erected bulge, Tony pondered for a moment while looking at the word tired. Should he make his mother younger or make her a sexy milf? Fuck, while he liked milfs, he also really liked the liked it when young women acted like a mother. Making his mother younger would also probably give her needed energy boost, so younger it is.<br />
<br />
With the word “young&#39;&#39; in place of “tired”, Tony watched his mother regress in age. Her 48 year old features smoothed out as if a painter was fixing what time had worn down. Her faded hair grew dark, long, and lush again, while her slightly wrinkled face smoothed out to youthful tightness. Tony’s mother now looked like she was a youthful 22 years old.<br />
<br />
Tony’s mind swam as he understood that while his mother was younger she was still his mother. The new reality of how this could be possible was that through the power of science, Tony was born via surrogate mother using an egg from his mother. Not only was she younger now, Tony’s mother was a virgin as well. She also didn’t have to work due to getting yearly payments for being used in the experiment at an early age. She was still tired though, because now she was a college student.<br />
<br />
Tony’s brain was fried by this point due to horniness and information overload. He would have coomed in his pants by now, if he hadn’t jerked off in school earlier. Tony looked upon his sleeping mother’s cute form. His hand, not satisfied with rubbing his bulge, unzipped his pants and fished out his penis. Slowly he started fapping, getting off to the perversion of the situation. While his mother wasn’t overly sexy or drastically transformed, like the other girls in his school, Tony still found the situation hot. She was a sleeping young virgin girl in his own home, and that girl was his mom. He was fapping off to her! Of all of the degenerative changes he made with his app this was probably the most simple yet lewd change of them yet!<br />
<br />
Like the loner he was, Tony didn’t hold back as jizzed on the cute woman that was his mom. His cumshots plastered her sleeping face like in those videos online. On the lips, cheeks, forehead, and a bit on her hair, it was the defiling of an innocent. The eternally hormonal teen boy thought of using the app to further change his mother, but the cumshots seemed to awaken her. Before she opened her eyes, Tony scampered away, grinning, to his room.<br />
<br />
Lauren weary opened her eyes to see Tony’s form disappear into the hallway to his room. Feeling something warm and sticky on her face, she wiped the stuff off with her hand. Great good gophers! Lauren was a virgin, but she was sure this white sticky liquid was jizz! Tony must have fapped off to her. It was unacceptable, and as a mother Lauren would have to have a talk with him. <br />
<br />
Though on the other hand, Lauren licked her hand, tasting the bitter salty substance. It felt really nice, hot even, to be wanted by her distant son.</p>
