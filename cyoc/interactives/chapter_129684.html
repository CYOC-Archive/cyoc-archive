<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the indigent look on his face gave the impressive he was dismissive of the idea, Tom was nonetheless internally finding some excitement in the idea.  In the temptation it offered.  So as it was, after clearing away any errant thought of the moment and just letting his mind try to answer the question, a dull pain started in his gut that grew into a searing javelin piercing his bowels.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh!  Oh, God,&quot; he moaning, hunching over to grip at his stomach which felt like it was churning a mile a minute.  As a cold sweat started on his brow and trickled down his whole body, Tom began to shake while nausea had him clenching his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh boy, he didn&#39;t take long,&quot; Kate said when she noticed Tom&#39;s sudden turn.  &quot;What did you pick there, Tommy boy?&quot; she asked, placing a hand on his back.  Kate immediately felt the heat and sweat on him but more than that, Tom felt a good deal fatter.  Stepping back and looking him over quick, she could see the slight strain all his clothes had.  <br />
<br />
However, under Tom&#39;s arms, he wasn&#39;t trying to cope with any pain but the swelling bulge in his crotch.  Undoing his belt and subtly as he could, he quickly relented and just unzipped and tugged his pants to his ankles, scared of what he would see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, no, no.  I didn&#39;t mean to,&quot; Tom whimpered.  His balls, which had felt numb and then like they were being filled with cream, were swollen together to about the size of a basketball.  Worse than that though, his cock had shrunk and been absorbed somewhat by the pink, veiny growth of his former testicles.  Once cut, the head of his dick looked more like some misshapen teat than a cock.  That was what had made Tom realize the passing thought, the desire he kept hidden in, was about to be impossible to hide.<br />
<br />
Dropping to his knees and then on his hands and finally elbows, sweat dripping off of his chubby face, Tom tried to catch his breath but found it sunk away when the nearly ten pounds of flesh swung down under him.  Grunting, Tom spread his knees and hips apart to try and bring some relief to his sore pelvis and back.  Reaching down to try and shield the growth from the ground, Tom could feel more nubs, similar to what his cock had become.  There was also a light fuzz over the thing, and it was still filling up.  Getting heavier.<br />
<br />
&#39;You&#39;ve always wanted to know what it was like to have an udder,&#39; a voice in Tom&#39;s head told him, causing a blush to cover his face.  His hand crept back further, up his hairier taint until he found it.  A hot gasp escaped before he could bite his lip, the early folds of his slit just taking shape. &#39;And to be mount,&#39; it added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you thirsty or something?&quot; Kate laughed when she to recognized the growth now sagging down to the ground.  &quot;Are you gonna need to be milked too?&quot; she joked, noticing some pale white liquid leaking from his former cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Tom answered, shakily getting onto his feet and outstretched arms in order to allow more room his his udder to swell.  A nearly thirty pound weight already, Tom couldn&#39;t help but smile to see the thing along with feeling it. From the base of his spine, squirreling out was tail that seemed to be wagging in delight.  &quot;And bulls,&quot; Tom started before he realized but he was saying, &quot;I&#39;ll need... uhhh,&quot; but he trailed off as a tightness came up his legs and struck his hips.  <br />
<br />
Pops followed along with a shifting hos flesh, muscle, lengthening of bone and the continued organ growth that was removing anything human, or male, about Tom.  Even as some of the brief pain subsided, warmth and tingling replaced it while fat and thinly growing fur was starting to sprout over what could almost be called hind legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll need a bull to fuck you pregnant?  Is that it?&quot; Kate asked blunted.  Tom&#39;s fingers and toes curled from the odd arousal the question brought.  When he tried to open them again, he couldn&#39;t.  Looking down at his hands, the fingers were starting to merge together while the entire hand was starting to blacken over.  &quot;You know that means giving birth, a lot, right?  My uncle owns a farm where you could really get put to work,&quot; she noted with a smirk as she looked at Tom&#39;s bovine backside, complete with tufted tail, pink asshole, swelling cow sex and a sagging udder between thickening haunches.<br />
<br />
&quot;If works means getting bred,&quot; Tom began, the words causing his new sex to quiver and swell out, dripping.  Kate backed off ass he continued, his voice sounding deeper, and more feminine, &quot;and being milked like the cow I am,&quot; he said, moving just enough to cause the udder to sway and slosh.  &quot;And, and,&quot; but rather than finish, his bowels having been groaning themselves, Tom strained his new asshole with a cascade of cow shit, making the first of many cow pies.  Crap still plopping out of him, his body swelling with fat and overall mass, Tom managed a smile.  &quot;And being an animal then work... work...&quot;<br />
<br />
But as Tom tried to finish, his face- which has so far only gotten fatter- started to tingle before a sore jaw turned into an aching one.  Opening his mouth to hopefully bring some relief, Tom only felt it all start to growth and push itself away from him.  Nostril flaring with every breath, the sensation was only made odder but his elongating neck and pushing past 1,000 lbs in total weight, and climbing.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s really happening it&#39;s... I&#39;m turning into a fat cow,&quot; Tom said nearly crying from the influx of hormones.<br />
<br />
Kate just stayed silent while, all this time, Matt could only stare and watch while his roommate rather happily transformed into a cow.<br />
<br />
His breath catching, the fur coming over his face to take his head while his snout and new tongue got used to the feeling of bigger and flatter teeth.  Wavering from side to side, Kate helped steady him as the last few changes took him.  Now down to the floor, and almost 100 lbs full, Tom&#39;s new udder was ready to burst with a simple shake of his head shedding most of Tom&#39;s old hair away.<br />
<br />
When he could finally breath, Tom&#39;s every attempt at a word was a bellow or moo.  His mind was flooded with instincts and sensations he struggled to process.  Meanwhile, while texting her uncle at the farm, Kate strode towards Matt while carefully avoiding Tom&#39;s still growing cowpie.<br />
<br />
&quot;One down and you to go.  Bull might be helpful to your friend but it would be up to you,&quot; she said with a smirk to the wary Matt.</p>
