<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">President Rodham had won a second term as the leader of the free world, but just barely. To her chagrin, she finally admitted to herself that for all her many accomplishments, most people just didn&#39;t like her. <br />
<br />
Rodham sighed sadly as she poured herself a drink inside her New York brownstone, watching snow fall in pretty waves just outside the window. When she was a little girl, this was *not* how she had imagined her dream job would go down. <br />
<br />
For the past four years, the Republican led Congress had done its best to block, sabotage, or dilute everything she had promised during her campaign to make her appear weak, just as they had done with the previous President.<br />
<br />
They lied about her all the time across the media, blaming her for everything bad under the sun, demonizing her in the eyes of half the country. That demented Pizzagate conspiracy theory was even making the rounds again across the darker/dumber parts of the internet. <br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t even the name calling that pissed her off, it was the brazen denial of reality. She recalled when one of Drumph&#39;s bimbo minions used the phrase &quot;alternative facts&quot; on CNN a few years ago to explain why Drumph was actually right when she said on Twitter that Rodham was a Satanist who was directly responsible for The Great Change. <br />
<br />
What angered Rodham the most was how they blamed her for the Covid-19 pandemic. She had done her damnedest to fight that evil little virus while these congresswomen and governors had all called it a hoax back in March and downplayed the need to social distance and wear a mask when in public. So many people had needlessly died when they didn&#39;t need to. <br />
<br />
Then there was that...other thing. The Transform Or Dare? curse. <br />
<br />
The first incident, where that poor teenage girl in California had mysteriously transformed into a young man by an unknown caller over the phone had received far too much attention from the media to just cover it up. <br />
<br />
Like Covid-19, this magical curse had spread from person to person like wildfire. First with Jennifer Smith&#39;s therapist, who had been accidentally turned into a giant pair of testicles with a mouth and legs, and then with the therapist&#39;s wife who had been dared into dancing like a ballerina twenty-four hours a day, and that was only the beginning. Rodham had to admit that it was all kind of terrifying, but the girls in the Occ-Opps had done a great job in getting to other victims of this demon before they had a chance to cause a scene, de-curseing them whenever it was possible. De-curseing was difficult, because the magic was a type than anyone were used to dealing with, but entirely doable. Jennifer Smith was already back to her lesbian female self, and had done her best to put her ordeal behind her. <br />
<br />
If only politics had straightforward solutions. Rodham silently thanked whoever was responsible for The Great Change that they had taken care of global warming.  <br />
<br />
**<br />
Elsewhere...<br />
<br />
Millie and Juliana Quesada were having a quiet candlelit dinner inside their kitchen. Both women were dressed up to the nines, pretending to have a romantic night out together, as they couldn&#39;t actually go out to a restaurant due to the pandemic. They giggled as they fed each other Chinese food with forks and spoons from across the table while fondling each other&#39;s thighs underneath. One thing that had not changed in the last few years was Millie and Juliana&#39;s passion for each other. Later that night they would have another amazing round of sex. <br />
<br />
Christmas Day had come and gone, and little Paloma had gotten a mess of new toys and dolls to play with. After two days of near nonstop goofing around she had *finally* tired herself out and was fast asleep in her bedroom upstairs. Millie had shared so many silly pictures of Paloma doing Paloma things on her Instagram profile with her friends over the last few days, but she was happy that she finally had some alone time with her wife. <br />
<br />
&quot;I love you&quot; she half whispered to Juliana. <br />
<br />
&quot;I truly madly deeply love you&quot; Juliana half whispered back. <br />
<br />
&quot;I truly madly deeply deliciously love you&quot; Millie said as her hand reached towards Juliana&#39;s ass. <br />
<br />
This was one of their little games.<br />
<br />
Millie had gradually gotten used to Christmas over the last few years. She had never celebrated it before The Great Change due to the fact that she was Jewish, but she had started to treat it as a secular holiday and an excuse to splurge on her two favorite girls, and overall just loved seeing them be happy. She literally could not imagine an existence without them anymore.<br />
<br />
Life was good. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Life was not so good for Regina Chung. <br />
<br />
The Transform Or Dare? pandemic was a lot worse than anyone knew about. Her partner Aziza was doing her best to fix up all the innocent people being cursed into perverted chimeras and dared into never stop singing, but it was still *her* fault for allowing this demon to enter their reality in the first place.  And what&#39;s worse, this demon was too powerful for even the combined powers of the Sorceresses Supreme to stop. All they could do was try and contain it without letting the magic Gestapo be aware of their existence. <br />
<br />
Regina had begged Aziza to lift the spell of amnesia from her girlfriend Kylie so Kylie could use her own considerable magic powers and provide that extra ounce of oomph to put the monster back in his cage, but Aziza had blocked every attempt, arguing that the old Kylie was too mentally broken to ever be trustworthy. <br />
<br />
Regina thought this was just a rationalization and that Aziza had more self serving motives, but whatever. Let the kids have their fun. For now. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s not like she could say that she was one to talk about relationships. As a man, Reese Chung had gone through a failed marriage due to focusing too much on his career. He had sucked as a husband. <br />
<br />
As a woman, she had done pretty much the same thing. The only reason why was at this bar two days after Christmas was because she and Jenna had broken up. <br />
<br />
Regina had slowly pushed Jenna away from her private life because she didn&#39;t want Jenna to get hurt. Jenna didn&#39;t understand, and called things off. <br />
<br />
Honestly, Regina didn&#39;t understand either. She never asked to be Earth&#39;s magical defender. <br />
<br />
&quot;Goddess, I&#39;m so fucking lonely&quot; she thought to herself. She quickly admonished herself for falling into self pity, but it was true. She had nobody really in her life that she could really connect with. Aziza was more of a work friend than a partner, and Sheena was more of a pet. <br />
<br />
Already a little tipsy, Regina looked away from the drink she was nursing and gazed around the bar. It was only 25% full due to the pandemic. <br />
<br />
She saw an absolutely stunning redheaded woman in the corner, also alone. Against her better judgement, Regina stumbled over to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, my name&#39;s Regina&quot; she slurred.<br />
<br />
The redhead said her name was Savannah. Regina sat down next to her, and they began to flirt.</p>
