<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Early August rolled around.  The sun was starting to shine and the birds were chirping.  However, Monica didn&#39;t know that.  She was content to have tummy time on the floor playing with a water filled mat that when she pat it fish moved around.    She was wearing her customary diaper that had a black Y printed on it above fifteen black drips.  Her pink special needs helmet extended down her ears and down the back of her head almost to her shoulders.  Her chin was rested firmly in its pink chin cup that was attached to the strap that secured her helmet to her head.  On her hands were thick pink padded mittens that had kittens printed on them.  She had to start wearing her mittens because the girl would stick her hand down the back of her diaper to collect the feces sitting in the seat of her pants and pull it out and smear it all over her body while chortling.  With the mittens on, she could no longer do that.  But in reality, she never knew anymore when she pooped her diaper and thus didn&#39;t think of doing it anymore.  If her diaper wasn&#39;t sticky, it wasn&#39;t sticky and when it was sticky, it was sticky.  The only other thing she wore was a pink silicone bib that had a crumb catcher.  on the bib was printed the outline of a white kitty with a bow.  She no longer wore socks or shoes.She had just woken up and gotten changed for the day.The seven year old&#39;s room was sound proof and didn&#39;t have a window.  Her cinder block walls were painted mint green and her cement floor was covered in white vinyl tile like one would find at a department store.  In a corner, a camera recorded her every move.  There was a mirror on one wall of her room.  If that other girl would just get out the way, Monica could just go through the mirror and see what&#39;s on the other side.  Had Monica done so, she would have discovered a different room full of people watching her and taking notes.  Her nurse walked into the room through the steel door that had no way to open it except through reading her nurses palm.  The door would open automatically and then slide close only to be magnetically locked again.  Monica found that if she crawled to the door, it wouldn&#39;t open for her.  In reality, the door had an RFID scanner built into the palm reader that would inform her nurse that she was too close to the door and to be mindful  The nurse grabbed Monica&#39;s wrist and scanned the RFID tag that was implanted under her skin to let the computer know that Monica wasn&#39;t missing.  Earlier in July, Monica went to visit a nice man who put her to sleep, removed her ovaries, removed her teeth, removed her breast buds, implanted her RFID chip, and started her off on estrogen so that she could begin growth attenuation treatment.  The purpose of growth attenuation treatment was to stunt her growth leaving her as big as she is now.  Other benefits were that she would never grow breasts or have periods.  A week after seeing the nice man, she went to see another nice man who gave her surgery to blur her vision.  He had given her very nearsighted vision as she could only see clearly about six inches in front of her face.  Monica&#39;s limited repeating routine and lack of access to the outside world had done a number on Monica&#39;s mind.  She could no longer walk and she could no longer remember anything that happened to her beyond an hour.  She only ever got to play with three toys since she was given her mittens.  She had her water filled aquarium mat that she could pat.  Or, she could lie on her back and play with the play gym that towered above her.  Her third option, a mobile, was reserved for when she was in her hospital youth crib which was covered by a clear hard plastic top so she couldn&#39;t stand up and fall out.  The mobile was designed for a newborn baby and it had four plastic circles with four simple shapes printed on them and facing downwards so that the one it was trying to entertain could see them.  Those shapes were a black spiral on a white background, a red diamond on a black background, a white square on a red back ground, and a red triangle on a white background.  It was a good idea to put a clear plastic top on Monica&#39;s crib.  It was instrumental in helping Monica forget how to walk.  Inside the crib was a thin white vinyl mattress covered in pink and blue foot prints.  On all sides of her crib even the side that slid down.  tall white vinyl bumper pads had taken up residence.  The pattern on the bumper pads were the same as on her mattress.  The crib itself was painted white.  Going back to the nurse, she lifted the little girl off the floor and placed her in her lavender and gray colored special needs stroller.  First, she buckled the locking five point harness around Monica&#39;s torso.  The nurse had a special key to unlock it when needed.  On either side of Monica&#39;s hips were two thickly padded hip abductures used to make sure she didn&#39;t move her hips too much.  in between Monica&#39;s legs was a leg abductor, the thickest and largest made for the stroller.  It separated her legs allowing the nurse to see the crotch of her diaper.  The nurse adjusted the thickly padded wings adjustable wings on Monica&#39;s head rest so that she wouldn&#39;t be able to move her head too much, but was still comfy.  She then worked her way down to Monica&#39;s leg resting plate so that she could secure Monica&#39;s legs to it using the leg flaps and lock them in place with her key.  The leg flaps were specifically designed to Monica&#39;s specifications so that she couldn&#39;t move her legs, but still be comfy.  The nurse then moved onto Monica&#39;s foot plate and secured the specially designed straps across her bare feet before locking in them in and securing them inside the special foot cups.  Finally, the nurse clicked in her tray that had a two inch tall lip running around the corners.  The tray had two arms protruding from it that extended all the way back to near where the seat backing and covered the entirety of the stroller arm rests on both sides.  The nurse pushed a button on the stroller leaning back Monica so that she could feed her.  She produced a clear baby bottle that had a clear silicone nipple that was similar in shape that breast fed babies use when they have to drink out of a bottle and don&#39;t want to suffer from nipple confusion.  It was surrounded by a white ring and had numbers running down the side of it.  Sixteen ounces of white fluid was inside,  It was enough to provide Monica 500 calories and a third of her DRVs of vitamins, minerals, and proteins.  She rubbed the nipple against the side of Monica&#39;s cheek and Monica turned to latch on and start sucking.  In Monica&#39;s POV, the formula was heaven.  She loved it so much that it was all she ever got.  Meanwhile on the other side of town, a grown 30 year old man stood at the end of his driveway waiting for a school bus to pick him up for his first day of Pre-K  The night before, he was at a department store and found some training pants that had cool looking cars on them.  They looked better than the plain white cloth training pants he had at home.  He knew he didn&#39;t really need to wear disposable training pants, but they would be so cool to wear to Pre-school the next day.  Aside from the disposable training pants he wore, he also wore blue shoes with puppies and blue LEDs that flashed with every step he took, yellow socks with navy blue trim that went to just above his knee, a thin navy blue pair of shorts that were really short, and a yellow school polo which had the school&#39;s name and grade stitched into it.  The training pants bulged out his shorts a little bit, but a peak of a smiling red car could be seen under the leg cuff of his shorts if someone took the time to look.  It didn&#39;t take long for the bus to arrive to pick him up for his first day of Pre-K.</p>
