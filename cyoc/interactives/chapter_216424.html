<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks for the idea, ChronoSeth</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Veles was hidden in the passageway with the rest of the party when Charlie returned.<br />
<br />
The only sign the well-muscled cougar had was the tracks Charlie left in the dust and the shift in air pressure. Charlie was invisible after all, thanks to Veles’ spell. <br />
<br />
“Not there either?” Veles whispered.<br />
<br />
“No.” Charlie sounded frustrated, his voice a snarl. “I’m going to look in the East Wall.”<br />
<br />
“The one with the unstable floor?” Veles asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, where they are storing the villagers that are Trimmed.”<br />
<br />
“Rodrigo was never Trimmed.” Oswin whispered fiercely.<br />
<br />
“Maybe he adjusted himself once or twice, or enhanced himself with a potion or two.” Veles suggested.<br />
<br />
“That,” Oswin paused. “No, that does sound like something he’d do. Be careful.”<br />
<br />
Veles couldn’t see Charlie nod.<br />
<br />
They waited before a loud crashing sound came from beyond the East Wall, muffled only slightly from the stone.<br />
<br />
“What was that? Investigate it!” A voice boomed from somewhere overhead.<br />
<br />
The golems turned as one and investigated the noise. A few moments later, Veles heard rubble being shifted and more sounds of collapse. There was the sound of scuttling and splashing.<br />
<br />
“The floor fell out?” There was a chuckle. “My jailers really should have been more careful. Even if the miners hadn’t broken the magical barrier surrounding my tomb and awakened me, that floor would have. Resume your assigned duties.”<br />
<br />
The golems returned to their positions.<br />
<br />
Oswin groaned. “Dammit! Did he get himself and the Mayor killed?”<br />
<br />
“You’re still alive.” Veles pointed out. “So either the Mayor is dead and the curse doesn’t exist, or he’s still alive.”<br />
<br />
“We should take a long rest and recover.” Gregory, the lithe mink Prince (though Oswin didn’t know it), insisted. “That way we can simply defeat the golems and help Charlie as fast as possible.”<br />
<br />
“I suppose.” Oswin said, his eyes on the East Wall. “If they are dying, we won’t make it to them quickly enough to help them.”<br />
<br />
“True.” Veles nodded.<br />
<br />
They made to turn back and set up camp outside when a figure rose from on of the glass coffins.<br />
<br />
It was one of the big, muscled pitbull warriors that were being mass manufactured, though there was something different about this one. He wasn’t naked, for one thing, and for another, he was making a beeline straight to the party. None of the golems paid him any mind.<br />
<br />
Oswin grit his teeth and pulled out a bow.<br />
<br />
Veles’ mind whirred as he wondered who it could be.<br />
<br />
Oswin’s bowstring stretched taut, aimed at the figure’s heart.<br />
<br />
“Wait!” Veles gasped, shoving Oswin’s bow down. “That’s… Charlon.”<br />
<br />
Veles blinked even as the name left his mouth.<br />
<br />
Charlon? Who was Charlon? Confusion swept through the rest of the party. <br />
<br />
Then, as though a switch had been flicked, everyone else seemed to relax. Veles wondered what had happened to them when his mind tingled and memories of Charlon began to insert themselves into his brain. Charlon was Charlie’s character, of course! <br />
<br />
He found himself relaxing too, but there was something wrong about this. It niggled at the back of his mind. If Charlon was Charlie’s character, then who was Charlie? The two conflicting memories were the only way he had to know something weird was going on here.<br />
<br />
Charlon approached Veles, his towering form and massively muscled build drawing the cougar’s  attention. <br />
<br />
The wolfdog’s bone-white fur, with patches of gray and black, highlighted the rugged contours of his face. His lupine features, including sharp ears and a strong snout, blended seamlessly with his pitbull traits, including a powerful jawline and top-heavy physique. His amber eyes glinted with a fierce intensity, hinting at his warrior spirit.<br />
<br />
Veles couldn&#39;t help but notice Charlon&#39;s scars, visible in places where his armor left him exposed. One jagged scar ran across his bicep, another across his chest. They only added to Charlon&#39;s allure, a reminder of the battles he had faced and the victories he had won. The cougar couldn&#39;t help but be impressed by Charlon&#39;s size and strength. Every inch of him was bulging with muscle, giving him an aura of raw power and physical dominance. <br />
<br />
His leather armor hugged his toned body, revealing the impressive bulges of his biceps, triceps, and abs. The armor was adorned with various trinkets and trophies, including the symbol of Ajax, his former master. As Veles noticed the emblem, he couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of unease, but the feeling was quickly replaced by a strong attraction to Charlon&#39;s commanding presence.<br />
<br />
Charlon&#39;s natural Charisma was immediately apparent. The wolf-dog&#39;s infectious confidence and sensual aura commanded Veles&#39; attention. It was clear that Charlon was a mighty warrior, one who had seen his share of battles and emerged victorious. His bulging muscles only added to his rugged appeal, hinting at the strength and power he possessed. Veles couldn&#39;t help but feel both admiration and desire towards this formidable figure.<br />
<br />
Despite Charlon&#39;s fearsome appearance and past, Veles felt drawn to him, unable to resist his charm and charisma. His eyes traveled down to the wolfdog’s crotch, where it bulged lewdly, practically bursting from his leather thong. Veles could see the root of his massive red dong and some of the meat as it swayed with every step Charlon took.<br />
<br />
“Hey boys,” Charlon’s voice was a rough, sultry baritone that sent shivers up Veles’ spine, making his fur stand on end. “Miss me?”<br />
<br />
The others stiffened and shook as Charlon, approached, their hips bucking. Charlon grabbed Veles, encircled the cougar in his arms and kissed the puma deeply. Veles stiffened as new memories entered his brain.  They were hard to fight off while being kissed by such a strong, handsome beast.<br />
<br />
Veles’ eyes fell on the wolfdog’s big cock and moaned as he recalled it stretching out his tailhole almost every night since he’d arrived in this world. <br />
<br />
He felt his sphincter spasm rapidly, as though being fucked a hundred times in as many days in over the course of a few seconds. Veles felt the wolfdog grip him tighter and the cougar yowled, bucking his hips. A dark wet stain appeared on the front of the cougar’s pants. The orgasm kept coming and coming, jism streaming into Veles’ pants. <br />
<br />
The cougar shivered and moaned into Charlon’s deep kisses. He was so big and handsome, always bringing each member of the party to orgasm. Veles felt his worries fading with every spurt of cum. He relaxed into the pit-wolf’s kiss and stroked the handsome wolfdog’s back.<br />
<br />
“I missed you a lot.” Veles whispered.<br />
<br />
“I can tell, sweetheart.” Charlon chuckled, sticking a paw down Veles pants into the sticky mess there and then pulling it back out, strings of cum on his fingers. He looked Veles in the eye and licked his fingers clean. “You’re really needy today. Don’t worry, I’ll stretch you out nicely during the long rest.”<br />
<br />
“I can’t wait,” Veles purred, feeling his hole throb needily.<br />
<br />
Charlon was the party top, after all.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Oswin glowered, pushing Charlon away from Veles. “Hands off my Ein!”<br />
<br />
“Of course, your… Ein.” Charlon grinned playfully, letting the cougar go with a slap on his bum. “You seem pent up too, Oswin. Maybe you could use a nice prostate massage?”<br />
<br />
“That…” Oswin’s eyes glazed over as the pit-wolf’s naturally charm worked its magic. Then he shook his head. “I-I’m a top!”<br />
<br />
“Of course you are.” Charlon growled, flicking Oswin’s firm nipples. “Why not let yourself have a break tonight? Relax, let go.”<br />
<br />
“I…” Oswin swallowed, his eyes darting frantically around the room, looking for help. It was a strange look on the stoic, burly buck. “M-maybe later! Let’s just focus on finding somewhere safe to rest.”<br />
<br />
Charlon grinned as the buck led them back to the secret room in the first chamber. Veles couldn’t help but notice the wolf-dog’s attention was entirely on the stag’s firm buttocks.<br />
<br />
Honestly, he was a bit jealous. He never got this much attention from Charlon.</p>
