<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When he got home, Cory noticed that his mom had not yet arrived. He decided to leave a note telling her that he was going out that night. His empty stomach immediately demanded his attention. There weren’t many options and of those options none seemed any good. So he just ate cereal.<br />
<br />
After his meal he headed towards his room. However just before he reached the stairs he looked at the photos above a chest of drawers.<br />
<br />
His favorite photo showed him with the whole family. It was taken some years ago, before his father and brother were sent to jail. They looked happy in the photo. <br />
<br />
Cory missed his brother the most. Even as a kid Cory loved spending time with his brother who was 5 years older. Harry could sometimes be mean to him but they were very close nonetheless. He remembered when Harry gave him a cigarette for the first time at age 12 and even gave him a joint to try when he was older. However he refused to give him any other drugs, realizing Cory could get into a downwards spiral of drug abuse and traffic like he was. He really didn’t want to drag Cory to the life he had.<br />
<br />
It was horrifying when Harry and his father went to prison. His dad had dragged Harry to the world of drug dealing and consumption. Cory found out his brother had made his dad promise he wouldn’t drag Cory as well. Ever since then he avoided meeting with his father. He blamed him for taking his brother away. However Cory did stop thinking about doing heavier drugs, he just kept smoking tobacco and pot and refused to sell drugs even when the budget was tight at home. He made a promise to his brother that he would never get sent to jail and he’d get some work and get some money after finishing school. Then when Harry left jail they could go leave home. They would get a fresh start. Sure his mom would worry but he felt that was the right thing to do. <br />
<br />
He sighed feeling nostalgic. Then he went upstairs to his room. It was rather messy but that’s the way it always was. Despite the smell of pot and tobacco he found it weird that he had no ashtray in his room. It seemed odd as well as if something was missing. Shrugging his shoulders he opened a drawer and shoved his bags filled with pot in there. There he found a pipe. Sam had offered him that pipe on his birthday. Still feeling nostalgic he remembered how they had met.<br />
<br />
Cory had been a nice kid in school. Though not the most intelligent person in class he did fairly well. Still he didn’t have many friends but he did have already some strong beliefs despite his young age. It was in his third year of school that he became best friends with Sam. Some bullies were making fun of Sam’s red hair and pushing him. Those “friends” Sam usually hang out with either left him alone or some made fun of him as well. Cory felt his blood boil. Apparently no one cared about Sam, whose tears streamed down his face. In his anger he punched those who were making fun of him. Soon he was kicking and punching and the other kids kicked and punched him as well. When the fight was stopped Cory was sent to detention. He told the teachers the truth: those kids were making fun of Sam so he started that fight to protect him. He wasn’t sorry and wouldn’t apologise so he ended up being the one who had to spend the most time in detention. <br />
<br />
After that he became angry with everyone. His schoolmates were basically bullies, cowards or jerks. His teachers didn’t even care about what was right and what was wrong. After that Cory found it very hard to trust in any kind of authority. Soon afterwards Sam came to see him and thanked him for standing up to him. Cory felt happy for Sam and felt good about himself as well. They both became best friends very quickly. They would go to each other’s house and play some video games and they also did some mischief together. At the same time, Cory’s interest for school fell. His pride couldn’t let him forget the betrayal he felt. Teachers talked a lot but they didn’t care at all about students and what was right and wrong. No one would be there to help him so he decided to follow his own rules. His grades went down and he had some problems about trusting people. He also became short-tempered and cursed a lot. After his brother gave him a cigarette he and Sam started smoking and eventually they smoked pot as well. Pot meant a lot to him. His worries seemed to vanish and he felt good, relaxed. He loved smoking pot especially with his best pal Sam. He couldn’t imagine his life without him. Maybe he should ask Sam to come with him and his brother. The three of them together searching for somewhere new. Who knows? A guy’s got to have dreams.<br />
<br />
He closed the drawer and went to the bathroom. He shaved his beard and undressed himself. “Looking good as always” he thought. His hair was now curly and sandy brown and looked rather unkempt. It hid a small scar on his forehead, where he broke his head when he was ten. Sam had dared him to climb a huge tree but he fell just before reaching the top. For a moment he saw something weird so he moved his hair away from his left ear. Nothing was wrong. He had that small flesh tunnel for a while now. Above his right eyebrow he saw that he had a piercing as well. That wasn’t surprising. He had told Sam he was going to make one as soon as he turned 18 so that’s what he did.<br />
<br />
He took his time in the shower organizing his thoughts. It felt like every time he thought about his life something new, both new and old crossed his mind. The thoughts excited him. Every action he had done, everything that happened to him was now like a bright light. Even thinking about his mistakes and sadness in his life made him feel somewhat good, like pieces of a puzzle fitting together. A puzzle that was almost finished.<br />
<br />
He got out of the shower and dried himself. He took a last glimpse at his naked form. No girl would resist him. Even if he wasn’t as built as the athletes at his school he looked good and above all he knew how to please a girl. Just thinking about that made his penis harden. He remembered plowing Leigh against the wall. Her hands all around his neck and shoulders as his hips went back and forth, back and forth. Her screams of pleasure compelling him to fuck her harder and harder. Shit, he needed to calm down and save that horniness for later.<br />
<br />
He headed back to his room, his same old room. There were lots of posters on the walls from his favorite bands and video games. He had a stereo which belonged to his brother with dozens of CD’s. On his desk was his computer with his usual wallpaper of a MJ leaf on a green background with the words “Got cannabis?” underneath. On the desk were also a lava lamp and an ashtray. If the heavy scent wasn’t enough the amount of ashes on his ashtray showed just how much he enjoyed smoking. He also had a small TV in his room and a PS3 with two PS3 controls for when Sam came to visit. Yeah, everything was just the way he liked it.<br />
<br />
He checked his wardrobe and grabbed a black sweatshirt and some jeans. Then we wore his old DC shoes. Since he was on time he put some pot in his pipe and smoked it.<br />
<br />
--- <br />
Cory arrived at the party alone. The loud music and the people he saw through the window showed him that the party was alive and well. As he entered a cloud of smoke hit his nose. He knew most of the people present. Most of them were sitting on the couches and passing blunts and joints. Others were drinking some booze. Sam had come earlier and was now sitting on one of the couches. He took a drag from a blunt that was passed to him and he then passed it to a girl next to him, Leigh. Cory approached them and Sam’s fist slowly met Cory’s.<br />
<br />
“Wazzup Shorty my man?” He slowly asked.<br />
<br />
“Fine, dude. Hey Leigh how’s it hanging?”<br />
<br />
She exhaled the smoke and said with a grin “Feeling super! Here, want a drag? She asked as she pointed at the half burnt blunt.<br />
<br />
“Sure” Cory answered and took a vigorous puff.<br />
<br />
“Gee, it’s not all just for you, man!” Darnell complained as Cory passed the blunt to him.<br />
<br />
“You all could barely smoke that shit, I’m just helping you fuckers” Cory answered with a dumb laugh. He then turned to Leigh “So, where is that girl you were talking about?”<br />
<br />
“Trying to keep an eye on the prize, man?” Sam asked with his dragged speech.<br />
<br />
“I’m not the only one, it seems” Cory mocked looking at Leigh. She noticed it and kissed Sam on the lips without hesitation.<br />
<br />
“You bet, Shorty” She said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
“Hey, only the guys get to calm me that.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, it’s a cool nickname. Cody Shorty” Leigh said with another laugh.<br />
<br />
“Cody…” He tried to think about that but his mind felt slow. He couldn’t think much at all.<br />
<br />
“Hey look it’s her” Leigh said pointing at the front door.<br />
<br />
Chloe stepped in. She was hot. Cory (was that his name?) looked at her in awe. She was blonde with a nice pair of breasts. She had piercings on her ears and one on her right nostril. A tattoo covered most of her left arm. Her body was great and her ass was good as well. He couldn’t wait to make that girl his. Without hesitation he approached the girl. <br />
<br />
“So, you’re Chloe?” His self-confidence was actually a bit shaken by how that girl made him feel.<br />
<br />
“Yeah. Leigh has told me lots about you.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t pay much attention to what’s been said” he leaned towards her ear. “Tonight you’re getting the real deal” He concluded feeling his confidence returning. <br />
<br />
“Can’t wait for it” She replied with a wink.<br />
<br />
They both seat on a couch. They spent some time together, smoking and drinking a bit. They didn’t talk much, just an occasional whisper and some “accidental” touches on her boobs and ass. While she touched his face and put a hand on his groin.<br />
<br />
After a while he made a signal to Dylan. He understood what he meant and nodded. The guy known as Shorty whispered something into Chloe’s ear and they both went upstairs. On the way up he noticed that Leigh and Sam were kissing each other but then his eyes fell upon Chloe again, his heart beating faster and faster.<br />
<br />
The couple upstairs entered a bedroom as they were kissing each other. Their kisses were only broken as they started to remove their clothes but not before the guy took a condom out of his pocket. As they both lied on the bed, he took Chloe’s thong. He kissed her on the lips lustfully and he licked her body as his head made its way towards her nether regions. As he used his tongue on her clit the girl moaned in pleasure.<br />
<br />
“Oh Cody… oh fuck me, fuck me Cody!”<br />
<br />
He eventually lifted his head and gently rubbed her nipples. Chloe was horny. She needed it in her! Slowly he pushed his penis into her warm vagina. As he felt his meat halfway inside her he pushed it all the way in, making her moan in pleasure. He lied on top of her as he continued to fuck her increasing in rhythm. Her moans were getting louder. Soon afterwards they changed positions. She was on top of him, riding his cock. His hands moved on her beautiful body. Before he reached his climax they again exchanged positions so that he was now on top with her legs on his shoulders. His thrusts were quicker by the second. He could no longer stop.<br />
<br />
“Cody… Cody”<br />
<br />
That name… he continued plowing her.<br />
<br />
“Don’t stop, Cody!”<br />
<br />
He increased his rhythm.<br />
<br />
“Oh, fuck me Cody! Fuck me!” She screamed.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t stop. His name… his true name was…<br />
<br />
“CODY!” She yelled as they both came.<br />
<br />
Feeling exhausted both Chloe and Cody fell asleep.<br />
<br />
--- <br />
A week had passed. Cody Rayne woke up. He noticed a text message from Sam to go to his place, smoke some pot and play some video games. The usual. Despite all the bad things in his life he knew he could count on Sam. He was glad to be Cody “Shorty” Rayne and he was happy with his life. Still he dreamt of both of them and his brother go search the world. Who knows? None of them seemed to have much of a future stuck in that city so why not try the world? Like himself Sam saw that as an interesting idea. They would make their own future together.<br />
<br />
He opened his drawer. As he took a bag of weed he saw a strange paper. It read “I hope you enjoy your new life Cody!” He looked puzzled for a second. In a blink of an eye the note was gone. Cody looked at the transparent bag with pot inside. No, he hadn’t smoked it yet. “Oh well, whatever.” He shrugged it off and dressed himself. As he left home he was greeted by a bright sunny day.  He enjoyed his life. It was a simple life and he had simple dreams. He lived his life like he had always done: being himself and living day by day each day. Maybe his dreams could come true or not but he would never let the world get the best of him. He placed a cigarette on his mouth and smoked it as he walked towards Sam’s house.<br />
