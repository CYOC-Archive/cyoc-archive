<br />
Later that night, Morgan found himself in Seth&#39;s bedroom alone. His room mate, it turned out, had actually dropped out. Seth had texted him. He was going to get his stuff some upcoming day. It was fortunate timing for Morgan however, being able to deal with a body swap with some privacy... but also for what he planned on doing tonight.<br />
<br />
He opened up the meet up app he had seen on Seth&#39;s phone before, and started probing around for interested parties. It actually didn&#39;t take long to get a response from someone nearby on campus. At the point of swapping pictures, he sent a newer photo he took that evening of Seth&#39;s body done up in clean clothes and showered. Morgan had to admit, when Seth was cleaned up and smiling, he wasn&#39;t that bad looking. And Morgan actually had a thing for nerdy guys. It all came back to how hard Seth tried, and it wasn&#39;t much. <br />
<br />
When he started to get messages back from the other guy, he was pleased to see who it was. There&#39;s a guy Morgan had seen around campus who was quite preppy and cute in the nerdy way he liked. Ryan was a ginger-haired boy who was somewhat flamboyant, but in his old body, had just been too fat for Ryan to find attractive. It seems he liked other thin guys.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long before he had Ryan knocking on the door. Letting him in, they made some light small talk, but it was not too long before they were pulling their shirts off and dropping pants. In Seth&#39;s bed, they made love like Morgan had never known. It wasn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t have sex, or wasn&#39;t able to get off. But something about this felt a bit more... energetic? In Seth&#39;s scrawny body, he just naturally had more stamina and vigor. He was twisting around and contorting his form to meet the curves and arcs that Ryan&#39;s taller body was naturally creating. <br />
<br />
Even beyond his surprise at what Seth&#39;s body could do, he was intent on giving Ryan a great time. With every thrust, lick, and sensual touch, he was trying to impress him. He was heavily attracted to Ryan, and would be sad if this was just a one time thing. Almost more exciting than his rock-hard boner, or Ryan&#39;s for that matter, was making out. Every time his lips touched Ryan&#39;s, he was over the moon. They were soft, not chapped, which he felt his own - or Seth&#39;s, rather - were. And when their tongues would flick into each others, he was suddenly feeling like a secret agent again, but this time in a good way. Like there was something sinfully erotic to be making love to your crush, while in the guise of another man.<br />
<br />
Ryan seemed to be enjoying himself, moaning often and grunting with pleasure as Morgan would thrust and gyrate. He took Ryan&#39;s love right in the ass, an arrangement he usually did not indulge in with his old body. And when Ryan maneuvered around, he slid his soft, delightfully red lips onto Morgan&#39;s borrowed penis, and sent wave after wave of extreme pleasure throughout his body. The sensation was intolerable, he nearly lost control of his extremities. Decadent, euphoric pleasure resonated down his legs, tingling into his toes, and back up through his torso, rushing a near cosmic experience to his head. Sweat dribbled down his forehead, and the two collapsed in a heap together. <br />
<br />
They looked into each others eyes, and while they did kiss every once and a while, they mostly just felt a strange affection foment between them. Little did Morgan know, but for Ryan it was unusual for him to spend the night with a fling. He usually liked to return to his single and freshen up before getting a good nights sleep. But something seemed different about this hook-up. There was a spark and a... passion, he hadn&#39;t ever felt before. It was like this cute little nerdy twink was giving him everything, and only him. It was like a secret that was shared with him, and never with anyone else.<br />
<br />
The two eventually drifted off into sleep. Morgan thinking about the bizarre turn of events that lead to him even being to bump uglies with Ryan, someone who he has lusted after for a while. But maybe having been switched with Seth wasn&#39;t all too bad. Perhaps he could find a silver lining to this in Ryan...</p>
