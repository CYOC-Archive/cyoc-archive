<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack crashed on his new bed.  It was a long day, and he could barely stay awake.  Everything finally caught up to him.<br />
<br />
His litte sister Mila got home from school and came up the stairs.  She noticed Uncle R&#39;s office door open.  She peeked in, and couldn&#39;t believe what she saw.  It was completely different!  She couldn&#39;t believe her eyes.<br />
<br />
Then she saw jack laying on a big bed that wasn&#39;t there before.  She went over to her sleepikng brother.  She looked at him and her eyes bugged out.  It was Jack, but he looked different.  He looked good.  She couldn&#39;t believe her eyes.  This couldn&#39;t be Jack, it must be an imposter.<br />
<br />
Mila nearly screamed, then she heart something.  It called to her.  She walked over to the new desk.  It whispered to her.  &quot;Yes?&quot; She asked uncertainly.  It spoke to her, and she listened.  She found the pen, and picked it up.  She shuddered, and her eyes rolled up into her head.  Her eyes closed, she floated a few inches above the floor.  Her eyes opened again as her feet found the floor again.  They were the same, but they looked different, like someone else was looking out of them.  Then, the whispering stopped.<br />
<br />
Mila went back to the bed.  She looked down at Jack sleeping.  He looked like an angel.  Then she wrote something on his arm.  She didn&#39;t know why, but for some reason she wrote &quot;always naked&quot; on his arm.  She gasped as his clothes immediately disappeared, along with all the clothes in the room.  She giggled.  He looked like the boys in magazines, all muscly.  She didn&#39;t really know why, but she wrote more on him.  &quot;Gay bimbo always sleeps with his boyfriend the captain of the football team.&quot;<br />
<br />
She knew Jack wasn&#39;t gay, and she sometimes wished he was becuase her friend Eva&#39;s big brother was gay, and he was so nice becuase he always listened to the girls and was happy to play with them.  She gasped as she saw his body.  It became soft and hairless, and the hair on his head grew out long and blonde.  His lips puffed up like a girl&#39;s, and his body became more curvy.  His pecs turned into big boobs, and his butt grew nice and plump.  The last thing that changed was his dick and testicles shrank down really really small.  Mila giggled again, he looked funny like a girl, but had little boy parts between his legs.  &quot;I think you&#39;re called a shemale now.  That works.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then a big hand reached around from the other side of Jack, cupping his small genitals protectively.  She nearly screamed, then remembered that he always slept with his boyfriend.  Sure enough, there was Ethan, big and muscular next to Jack, looking confused, but then seeing Jack and quickly getting aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Ethan.&quot;  Mila stood smiling at Ethan, far more confidently than any little girl had the right to stand.  But with the reality-warping power she wielded, it wasn&#39;t so far-fetched for her.<br />
<br />
Ethan looked around confused and embarrassed to see Mila watching him.  &quot;I don&#39;t know where I am or how I got here.&quot;  He realized he was holding Jack&#39;s small genitals in his hand, playing with them.  He stopped, his face beet red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s okay, you&#39;re at your boyfriend Jack&#39;s house, and you&#39;re playing with him.&quot;  Mila smiled innocently.  &quot;It&#39;s normal, since you&#39;re gay lovers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack stirred.  Ethan was playing with Jack&#39;s large, beautiful breasts.  He really couldn&#39;t help himself, somehow Jask was everything Ethan was attracted to - even the tiny dick and testicles!<br />
<br />
Before Jack woke up, Mila scribbled something quickly on his arm.  &quot;Jack forgets about the pen and all the ink on his body disappears.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stuffing the pen in her pocket, Mila retreated.  She passed her mom in the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mila, what were you doing in your Uncle&#39;s office?  You know it&#39;s off limits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was wondering what&#39;s going on in there.  I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s happening, mommy.&quot;  Mila ran to her room, pretending to be scared.  But as she closed the door to her room, she smiled as her mother screamed from the other end of the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Jack&#39;s mother screamed from the doorway, not believeing what she was seeing.  The room was all changed, completely redecorated with furniture that hadn&#39;t been there this morning.  But what really shocked her was the she-male sitting up in bed with a start... and with her son&#39;s face, just different - beautiful now, with full lips and long blonde hair framing his - her? - face, and a young jock next to Jack - Jack? - holding one of her son&#39;s DD breasts.  &quot;Jack?&quot; she whispered in disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; His voice called, also in shock.  It was a higher voice, and Jack didn&#39;t know what was going on.  His chest felt heavy, and he looked down and saw two double D&#39;s hanging - off of him!  He cried out in shock, they were so big and heavy, and so very THERE... he suddenly felt like he was nothing more than a milking cow!  He removed Ethan&#39;s hand and covered his breasts with his arms.  Then he thought - Ethan - why was he here?  He gasped in desbelief - why was Ethan so gorgeous?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, Jack...&quot; Jack&#39;s mother couldn&#39;t stop staring at her... &quot;son&quot;.  &quot;What the fuck happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, mom,&quot; Jack was confused and panicking, &quot;I swear to God I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan looked just as confused, but moved protectively next to Jack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your breasts are larger than mine,&quot; Jack&#39;s mother gasped.  She stood in the doorway without the slightest clue what to say or do next.<br />
<br />
Jack looked at Ethan, the boy was so dreamy.  Jack moaned in horror.  He saw his tiny cock pointing straight up, and realized it was too late to stop it.  He felt Ethan playing with one of his big heavy boobs again, and he had the strongest orgasm of his life.  He moaned as a little shot of cum flew into the air.  It hit hit his mom on the cheek.<br />
<br />
Jack had never been so turned on or so embarrassed in all of his life.  He waned to die.  Yet the orgasm was so strong, all he could do was sink back into Ethan&#39;s arms.  He felt as lost as his mother, as this adonis held him and he continued cumming.  As if it couldn&#39;t get worse, Ethan came all over Jack&#39;s belly and boobs with his own huge dick.  Both boys moaned, unable to help themselves.  <br />
<br />
Jack&#39;s mom stood in shock, her &quot;son&#39;s&quot; cum dripping from her cheek.</p>
