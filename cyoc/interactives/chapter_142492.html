<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd woke the next morning, feeling refreshed. Glancing around his girlfriends dorm room he could see Liz and Beth getting dressed, it seemed both girls had classes this morning. Liz turned, smiling warmly as Todd stretched. “Morning,” she said happily. “How did you sleep?”<br />
<br />
“Great,” Todd said with a yawn. “Where are you two off too?”<br />
<br />
“Class,” Beth said quietly. “Me and Liz have a lecture at 9.”<br />
<br />
Todd nodded as he watched the petite goth girl get dressed. Despite stripping the girl of her height and sexual experience he was pleasantly surprised she knew how to dress well. Beth’s knee high boots, dark leather pants and form fitting shirt accentuated the small girls curves. As she brushed back her dark hair Todd had to admit that the girl was more attractive than his own girlfriend. Despite this though, Todd’s heart amazingly belonged to his socially awkward girlfriend Beth. Liz chanced a glance in Todd’s direction, blushing crimson as she saw the older college boy looking at her. <br />
<br />
“Todd,” Liz laughed, noticing her roommates shyness. “Stop freaking Beth out okay. She’s still a bit shaken by everything that happened last night. She’s never made out with a girl before, let alone sleep naked next to a boy.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Todd chuckled. “Didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”<br />
<br />
Liz blushed slightly as she finished dressing. “No it’s okay,” she said shyly. “To be honest, hadn’t really done anything like that before either. Guess it was the blind leading the blind last night.” Todd grinned leanin back slightly as he gazed at the two shy girls in front of him. “So it was enjoyable then,” he smirked. “Guess I did pretty good then.”<br />
<br />
Liz giggled embarrassingly, while Beth blushed averting her gaze from Todd. “Don’t flatter yourself Romeo,” she teased, placing a gentle kiss on her boyfriends lips. “Yeah, may not Be the coolest or most experienced person in the world but it was um, nice. Just don’t get too full of yourself though, hate those cocky guys that think they’re gods gift to women.”<br />
<br />
“I promise Liz I’ll stay humble,” Todd smiled. Liz smiled, giving her boyfriend a tight hug before opening her door. “Anyway I don’t want to be late,” she said. “Me and Beth have a class to go to but we’ll be done around noon. You want to have lunch with us later?”<br />
<br />
“Sounds great Liz,” Todd said happily. “I’ll meet you in the dining hall.” Happy to have set up a lunch date for later Liz happily waved goodbye as her and her roommate now headed to class. For Todd it was truely astonishing how much things had changed in the past 24 hours. Liz had transformed from an elderly and cranky librarian to a shy, socially awkward teen girl. A girl who happened to incredibly adorable and that Todd felt he was falling in love with. Beth’s changes were even more dramatic. She had gone from classic mean girl to a petite goth girl who appeared even more socially awkward than his girlfriend. What was even more astounding was that the two roommates had gone from not being able to stand one another to very close friends, despite their obvious differences. Dressing quickly Todd now began to walk back to his dorm.<br />
<br />
The joys of being an upper classman in college meant that Todd didn’t have any classes until later in the day. Liz and Beth were still only freshmen meaning they would have earlier classes than Todd. As Todd now looked at the remote he tried to decide what to do with his invention. <br />
<br />
He had used it alter Beth and Liz extensively over the past 24 hours. He had tested many of the options within the remote and had even altered memories of people around campus to believe that all of the changes he had made were the way things were supposed to be. No one remembered the elderly Liz or sorority girl Beth now, instead it was the geeky teen Liz and her petite goth roommate Beth. As he pondered his next test subject he paused. Tood had been so deep in though he had inadvertently wandered into one of the many lecture buildings. Glancing into one of the classrooms Todd smiled wickedly.<br />
<br />
Professor Sterling was in the middle of her lecture. Todd remembered having the woman a year or two ago when he took a Political Science class. The woman was close to 50 and a classic example of a burnt out teacher. Sterling droned on, making her lecture points and not wishing to engage her students in discussion. This resulted in a class that was quite boring for students. Todd had tried to engage the professor in a debate once, only for her to shout him down, even though the point he was making was correct. As a result of his actions the professor had gone out of her way to make the class difficult for him. This resulted in Todd earning a B minus in that class. Looking at the woman Todd now realized this would be his chance for revenge.<br />
<br />
Glancing down at the remote Todd decided to conceal himself from view. After skimming through some various options in the submenu Todd was able to make himself invisible to anyone around. Todd activisted the remote, noticing a distortion of light seem to appear around his body. Satisfied that he was now concealed from view he looked at the tried Professor.<br />
<br />
Professor Elaine Sterling had a thin frame, which appeared to be rapidly approaching the bird like appearance of a spinster. Glancing at the woman’s hair he could see a considerable amount of grey was mixed into the woman’s chocolate brown locks, who chaired were done up in a tight bun. To complete her ensemble Professor Sterling sported a dark blue blazer over a white turtleneck, skirt, white nylons and almost puritanical looking shoes. Rubbing his chin thoughtfully Todd now had a mischievious idea. “Bet she looked a lot better years ago,” he smirked. Glancing down at the remote Todd smiled. Professor Elaine Sterling wAs 49 years old, at least for now. Thumbing through the various options Tood pointed the remote at Professor Sterling and activated it.<br />
<br />
The changes were subtle at first. Todd could see the grey in Professor Sterlings hair begin to vanish as she crept back towards 40. Although Todd could not clearly hear what the woman was saying he could hear her voice seeming to rise, becoming stronger in tone. Looking at the woman he could see her body filling back in, her curves returning while her breasts began to regain some fullness. Glancing at the remote Todd smiled.<br />
<br />
“Not bad,” he whispered. “She looked good at 39. Let’s rub a few more years off though.” Activating the remote once more Todd watched in anxious anticipation.<br />
<br />
Professor Sterlings body continued to youthen, her curves returning with a vengeance as they now strained the woman’s clothing. Professor Sterling paused in her lecture as she tried to adjust her clothing. The woman seemed puzzled as her skirt seemed tight around her womanly hips, while her blazer seemed tight as well with the returning muscle appearing on her shoulders and chest. Surprisingly Todd could see the woman’s hair had returned to its previous chocolate brown and appeared to be growing out. Todd watched fascinated as the once tight bun seemed to loosen as she grew younger, strands of hair seeming to grow out from the woman’s well kept locks. As she became 29 Todd was truely astounded.<br />
<br />
Professor Sterling was a very attractive woman with a gorgeous face and a beautiful lean body. As he listened to the woman’s voice he could imagine that when she was 29 the first time she must have been a very engaging teacher. The woman’s voice was powerful yet feminine, in her prime she was probably one of the most popular professors at the college. “Not bad,” Todd said. “But I wonder what would happen if we shaved off a few more years.”<br />
<br />
Todd watched as Professor Sterling turned towards the board, he recognized what she was about to do. Professor Sterling always made a habit of tapping on the board to reinforce her main points in her lecture. As she did Todd goosed the remote, wiping away one year at a time with every tap of the board. Fortunately for Todd their were several points she wanted to convey to her class. As she pointed she shivered slightl, growing steadily younger until a woman of 24 stood at the front of the class. As an added bonus Todd watched as her bun continued to unravel, with a final tap of the board her thick chocolate locks finally broke free, cascading in thick tresses that cascaded to her upper back. The young woman let out a gasp of surprise before pushing her thick hair out of her eyes. The woman paused, she sensed something was amiss but couldn’t put her finger on it. Looking over her hands Todd could see her eyes grow wide as she marveled at her youthful hands.<br />
<br />
Todd stifled a laugh as the woman now examined her body. She couldn’t wrap her mind around what was happening, turning towards her class she was puzzled that no one seemed to notice what was happening. Todd had done this intentionally, making sure no one would be aware of what was happening. Clearing her throat Professor Sterling now gave the assignment to the class before dismissing them. As Todd watched the class shuffle out of the room he watched Professor Sterling intently. A large athletic looking boy had come to the desk to ask her a question. The boy who appeared around 21 or 22 seemed to want to ask her about a previous lesson. As he did so Todd was surprised to see the woman looking at the boy with a look of longing. “Why professor I had no idea you liked the athletic type,” he thought. “Let’s see if we can out you and him on equal footing.”<br />
<br />
Tapping the remote Todd watched as the woman began to grow younger  yet again. Sterlings face became more youthful and innocent as she went from 24 to 20 in only seconds. Swooning slightly she braved herself against her desk before turning up toward the boy, her face flushing with excitement. After stammering a response the boy nodded before leaving. As the classroom emptied the now 20 year old professor sighed before sinking into her chair. Taking out a mirrror the girl gasped as she saw her youthful reflection. Running her hands over her face and inspecting her curves she seemed astounded by what she saw. “It seems you like your youth,” Todd smiled. “Wonder if you’ll feel the same way in a few moments.” <br />
<br />
Elaine smiled happily at her youthful college appearance. The girl was a college age girl once again with beautiful chocolate brown hair, full and perky c cup breasts and a lean figure with just enough curve. As she gazed at her face she suddenly felt a small chill run through her body. Shaking her head in confusion she looked back at the mirror, her mouth slowly going slack.<br />
<br />
The girl in the mirror appeared more innocent than just a moment before. Elaine’s hazel eyes  looked bigger and more innocent than only moments ago. The girl now looked like she belonged in high school instead in college. Glancing over her body she was startled as her once tight fitting outfit seemed to become baggy on a now teenage frame. Elaine gasped in shock as she looked at the 16 year old in the mirror. A 16 year old who was rapidly approaching 15.<br />
<br />
The teen let out an audible shriek as she watched herself grow even younger. The girl was now beginning to relive a growth spurt in reverse as she left high school behind. Elaine watched as the cuffs of her blazer rose over her wrists slowly engulfing her hands. Todd listened as the girl now pleaded for the process to stop as she became a young teen of only 13, her clothes becoming baggy while her breasts continued to shrink. Todd finally stopped the process as Elaine became a girl of 12.<br />
<br />
Elaine sat in shocked silence as she gazed at her youthful hands. The blazer now half covered the preteens hands while her breasts had been reduced to softball sized mounds inside her now baggy blazer and turtleneck. Elaine’s shoes had grown too big for her tiny feet, falling away leaving the girls feet swaying in her chair, the nylons bunched and sagging on her skinny childish legs. Todd watched as the girls bottom lip began to tremble before she buried her face in her young hands and began to cry. Todd smiled as he looked down at his remote, now he needed to decide what to do next.</p>
