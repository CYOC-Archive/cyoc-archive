<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mika and Claudia were sleeping together in their bed, when Mika felt the urge to go to the bathroom. Quickly running over to the bathroom, she felt a little light headed before reaching the toilet and vomited before flushing. Mika groggily stared at the toilet for a moment and blinked before she climbed back into bed next to Claudia who felt her getting back in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika, honey, are you okay?&quot; Clauida asked sleepily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine dear. I just threw up, I think I&#39;m pregnant again.&quot; Mika replied with a yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are? Oh....that&#39;s nice.&quot; Claudia sleepily replied back as she nearly went back to sleep.<br />
<br />
There was an uneasy silence before Mika and Claudia&#39;s eyes both shot back open wide and looked at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Mika and Claudia both shouted at the same time to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t....I don&#39;t understand....how....how is this possible? I mean, sure we&#39;ve done it before and the last time was.....&quot; Claudia struggled to find the words.<br />
<br />
&quot;A complicated story.&quot; Mika shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly, so how in the world did this happen? How could it happen?&quot; Claudia asked.<br />
<br />
 Reaching between her legs, she found that nothing had changed down there. That in itself was a good sign, but it didn&#39;t explain Mika&#39;s predicament. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay are you 100 percent sure?&quot; she asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I mean I think so?&quot; Mika shrugged. &quot;Last time i was sick like this was when I was pregnant with the twins. Or at least when my doppelganger was...ugh freaking timelines and magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah don&#39;t remind me,&quot; Claudia sighed. &quot;I had to check in between my legs real quick.&quot; Mika smirked, understanding why. <br />
<br />
Both of their doppelgangers were involved in some rather interesting escapades before merging with the young couple. Claudia now rubbed her neck sheepishly, gazing at her wife. &quot;Okay don&#39;t be mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something tells me I&#39;m going to be.&quot; Mika replied, drawing a sour look from Claudia. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be an ass I&#39;m being serious,&quot; she frowned. Mika folded her arms across her chest, awaiting what would certainly be a foot in mouth moment from her wife. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure it&#39;s mine?&quot; Claudia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it&#39;s yours dumb ass,&quot; Mika exclaimed. &quot;I haven&#39;t been with anyone else! How could you even think that?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get your panties twisted it&#39;s just a question,&quot; Claudia fired back. &quot;And in case you didn&#39;t notice, I&#39;m not exactly sporting the right equipment! So unless we&#39;re dealing with a immaculate conception, there&#39;s alot of questions to ask.&quot; Mika sighed, angry at Claudia&#39;s question yet understanding completely. Right now, they needed a drink. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go to the kitchen,&quot; she sighed.<br />
<br />
As the two of them walked into their kitchen when they turned on their lights and gasped in shock to see a strange woman sitting at their table eating an apple.<br />
<br />
The woman in question was wearing floor length summer dress, her faded golden blonde hair fell to her waist as she gave a kind wave before swallowing some of the apple pieces she was holding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, don&#39;t try anything funny lady. My dad was in the army, I&#39;ve got three kids, I&#39;m having a really weird night, and I&#39;m not afraid to kick your ass.&quot; Claudia warned the woman putting up her fists.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, please, you don&#39;t have to do that to me Claudia Harris, and Mika Tozawa Harris, I love seeing you up and about and looking so lovely as a mother should.&quot; The woman said to the two with a warm smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, you seem to know us, but we don&#39;t really....know you.&quot; Claudia said as she looked to Mika who shook her head too in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, forgive me. I forgot you haven&#39;t yet to meet me. I am Life, yes, the real embodiment and physical manifestation of life itself. My husband&#39;s Death and as Life and Death go together as you both are no doubt aware.&quot; Life explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re really life itself, huh? I think I met your husband before...didn&#39;t I?&quot; Claudia asked feeling a little confused about the matter of time.<br />
<br />
&quot;The short answer is you did and you didn&#39;t. He was there the day your mother died saving her daughter in-law. She carried her spirit off to meet your loving father there at the afterlife.&quot; Life explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, but wasn&#39;t I the one who....?&quot; Mika began to say before Life interrupted and put her fingers on the lips of the women.<br />
<br />
&quot;That matter has been discussed too much already before. So I&#39;ll say this: Claudia, your mother and only your mother was supposed to die that day and NO ONE ELSE, understand? Now do not bring up that question to me again.&quot; Life said with a grim look before turning back to her more cheery attitude.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, but you know as they say &#39;Life can be hard sometimes&#39;. Now, not too long ago, I gave my son&#39;s girlfriend&#39;s parents a gift: the ability to have a child without a male. So I thought after the whole fiasco you all went through, you two deserved a little happiness. That&#39;s why Mika, Claudia, I put a new seed into Mika. A human child, no kitsune biology to speak of. I can also tell you a little bit about him: it&#39;s a boy, he&#39;s got your eyes Mika, and Claudia, he&#39;s got your beautiful family hair.&quot; Life explained excitedly with a clap.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is....Life, this is surprising, but this is a lot to take in. We already have three mouths to feed, now we&#39;re going to have a fourth?&quot; Claudia asked in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika, Claudia, listen to me: I&#39;m the one who brought you two together, I put you through all the hardships, I guided you two the kitsunes where you had Aaron and Haley, then adopted Kari as well. I&#39;m sorry that you lost both your parents Claudia, and I&#39;m sorry you had to lose your mother, Mika, but sometimes everyone isn&#39;t always on the same path. Your new child will have his own destiny awaiting him one day. He&#39;ll discover what that is with the friends his make along the way. Claudia, the other reason I gifted a child again to you both is because I know you&#39;re still in pain from losing your mother, but she would want you to continue living and raise your new son like how your parents raised you. Every life is precious to me in one way or another, this one is no different.&quot; Life explained as Claudia was near to tears from hearing all this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mika....we&#39;re going to be parents again and I&#39;m so happy we get to be.&quot; Claudia said with tears in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you&#39;re happy, then I&#39;m happy. You me, and the children will all welcome this new one to the family. What should we call him?&quot; Mika asked touching her stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, my mom was a little disappointed we didn&#39;t name one of the kids after her. Let&#39;s name him....Mason. It&#39;s the closest name to Marjorie that I can think of.&quot; Claudia said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Major?&quot; Mika jokingly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding? Even my dad would hate that name.&quot; Claudia chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thanks....Life?&quot; Mika said as she and Claudia turned to see that the woman was gone.<br />
<br />
Before the happy couple headed back to bed, they saw their three children up and rubbing their eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you all think you&#39;re doing out of bed?&quot; Claudia asked crossing her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;We heard you guys talking, what&#39;s going on?&quot; Aaron asked his mothers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well children, we just learned that you&#39;re going to have a new baby brother!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are?! Do we get to play with him when he comes?&quot; Kari asked excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And can we help feed him like you do mommies?&quot; Haley asked just as excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on now, it&#39;ll take a while for your new baby brother to get here. He&#39;s growing inside me like you and Aaron did Haley. Mommy&#39;s tummy is very small now, but it&#39;s going to get much bigger soon and when he&#39;s ready to come out....he&#39;ll let us know.&quot; Mika giggled as the kids laughed too a little unsure what their mother meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, that&#39;s enough questions, you all need to be in bed now.&quot; Claudia said as she began to guide the three back to their beds with the exception of Aaron who Mika motioned she would take care of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron, did you get up because you heard us talking or your bad dreams?&quot; Mika asked concerned for her son.<br />
<br />
&quot;....bad dreams. Mommy, grandma died, but you both said she was strong. I don&#39;t get it.&quot; Aaron said confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will one day. Maybe when you find someone, do you want a girlfriend?&quot; Mika asked with a smile as she picked up her son.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No, girls are icky.&quot; Aaron said holding out his tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, your sisters are girls and you like them.&quot; Mika reminded her son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but they always want me to play girl stuff with them. How come girls are silly?&quot; Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;One day....you&#39;ll understand. One day, now go to sleep. Grandpa Hideo is coming over to visit tomorrow to play and you want all your energy.&quot; Mika said as she kissed Aaron on the forehead and he began to go back to sleep.<br />
<br />
Claudia came over to Mika having put Kari and Haley back to bed as well. Claudia and Mika held each other&#39;s hands as they leaned in and kissed each other gently on the lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our family just keeps expanding.&quot; Claudia said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is. Little Mason Harris, I love that name.&quot; Mika said as the two headed back to bed for a relaxing sleep.</p>
