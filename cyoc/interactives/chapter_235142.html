<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You find a ring. It&#39;s fairly plain and appears to be made out of brass, not particularly valuable. You take it to the clerk, who has the air of an old Asian wizard, and speaks in slightly broken English with an unusual accent. <br />
<br />
&quot;How much for this?&quot; you ask, holding up the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five dollars,&quot; he replies, eyes twinkling with a mysterious gleam.<br />
<br />
That seems reasonable to you, so you hand over the money. &quot;Why is it in the faulty product section?&quot; you inquire.<br />
<br />
The clerk leans in and speaks in hushed tones. &quot;Very slow first time, faster next times. Do not interrupt the first time. Takes about three days.&quot; He pauses, looking you over carefully. &quot;You have friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Confused but intrigued, you nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good!&quot; he exclaims, handing you another ring identical to the first. &quot;Two for one offer. It&#39;s a personal thing,&quot; he adds with a knowing smile.<br />
<br />
Perplexed yet curious, you pay and leave the store with both rings in hand.<br />
<br />
As you walk home, your mind is abuzz with thoughts. Fortunately, you&#39;ve already finished your grocery shopping for the week, and with a long weekend ahead, you&#39;ve got &quot;about three days&quot; to spend at home without needing to step out.<br />
<br />
Upon arriving home, you swiftly store the groceries you bought on your way back. Eager to relax, you plop down on the couch, your gaze falling on the two rings you just purchased. They look almost identical, but upon closer inspection, one has a faint blue hue while the other has a slight green tinge.<br />
<br />
Green is your favorite color, so you decide to slip the green-hued ring onto the ring finger of your left hand. It fits perfectly. You stare at it, wondering, &quot;What now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, your skin begins to change—a dark shade of green spreading from the ring outward. You watch in a mix of morbid fascination and fear as the green hue engulfs your finger, then extends to your entire hand. You can feel your hand hardening, the skin transforming into a metallic surface painted a deep green. Golden lines start to appear, segmenting the metal into individual plates, finishing the hand portion of what looks like a gauntlet.<br />
<br />
The green spreads upward along your arm, forming an elaborate gauntlet sleeve that widens as it progresses. Intrigued and slightly terrified, you flex your new metallic hand. It feels different, but not as if you were wearing a glove. Instead, it feels like an extension of your own body.<br />
<br />
You decide to test it further. Placing your new metal fingers gently on the edge of the table, you can feel its texture as clearly as if you were touching it with bare skin. Next, you poke your transformed hand with a toothpick. It is as hard as steel. The transformation is both eerily fascinating and terrifyingly surreal.<br />
<br />
You notice a sort of rash forming on your arm. Upon closer inspection, you realize that it isn&#39;t a rash, but very fine chain mail, slowly creeping up your skin. Panic mixes with curiosity as you watch it inch its way upward, weaving itself into your flesh.<br />
<br />
Two hours fly by. The door creaks open, and Ted, your friend, roommate, and occasional lover, walks in. He catches sight of your arm and his eyes widen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ted, you won&#39;t believe what&#39;s happening to me,&quot; you blurt out, desperately trying to explain the bizarre transformation as best as you understand it yourself.<br />
<br />
Ted listens, his expression shifting from shock to a strange sort of fascination. &quot;Wow,&quot; he finally says, a mischievous grin spreading across his face. &quot;I&#39;m a little freaked out, but also… turns out, armor is one of my fetishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shake your head, managing a weak smile despite your anxiety. &quot;Only you, Ted. Only you would find this hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
He steps closer, carefully examining your arm. &quot;So, what do we do now? Do you have any plans to, I don&#39;t know, stop this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s stoppable,&quot; you reply, your voice tinged with desperation. &quot;It’s been gradually covering my arm... all the way to my shoulder. I just don&#39;t know what it’ll do next.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted thinks for a moment. &quot;You know what might help? Let&#39;s watch a movie. It&#39;ll take your mind off things, and maybe we can figure out more about this afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
His casual suggestion feels like a lifeline. Nodding, you agree. &quot;Yeah, a movie sounds perfect. Anything to distract me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted grabs the remote and flicks through the channels until he finds a comforting, familiar film. As the opening credits roll, he settles in beside you, brushing your non-gauntleted hand gently to reassure you. You lean against him, the warmth of his body a stark contrast to the cold, unsettling metal gradually consuming your own.<br />
<br />
As you and Ted settle in to watch the film, the changes continue to spread. The transformation creeps up your left shoulder, the skin morphing into a spaulder, ornate and green with golden accents. The sight is both mesmerizing and disturbing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think I&#39;ll even be human by the time I wake up?&quot; you wonder aloud, your voice trembling slightly.<br />
<br />
Ted squeezes your hand gently. &quot;I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;ll hold you all night long if it helps,&quot; he says with genuine concern.<br />
<br />
You both prepare for bed, the casual intimacy of undressing together bringing some semblance of normalcy to the situation. Despite the dire changes in your body, there’s a comforting constancy in Ted’s presence.<br />
<br />
Climbing into bed, you feel his arms wrap around you. The warmth of his body contrasts sharply with the cold metal spreading across your skin, and you cling to that human warmth as long as you can.<br />
<br />
Over the night, the metal continues its relentless advance. By morning, it has spread across your chest and started making its way down your right arm, forming the right gauntlet as you both awaken. Everything below your chest remains untouched, as does your neck and head.<br />
<br />
As you pull yourself out of bed, you notice that your shoulders and chest have bulked up considerably. Your old clothes won&#39;t fit anymore—everything is too tight, too restrictive.<br />
<br />
Ted, ever the charismatic joker, runs his hands over your smooth, green metal surfaces. &quot;Well, looks like my morning show just got a serious upgrade,&quot; he quips with a grin.<br />
<br />
You manage a chuckle through your anxiety. &quot;It’s going to make shopping for clothes a nightmare, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted nods, still examining your metal-encased body with a mix of curiosity and… something else. &quot;We’ll figure it out. One step at a time.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you both sit down for breakfast, Ted&#39;s eyes widen, and he points at your back. &quot;Hey, hold still for a second,&quot; he says, leaning in to get a better look. <br />
<br />
“What is it now?” you ask, turning your head but keeping your torso still.<br />
<br />
“There’s a thin green line running down your spine,” he explains, tracing the air above it with his finger. “And it splits at the end, running down each of your legs.”<br />
<br />
You twist around, trying to see for yourself but eventually giving up. &quot;Great, now I&#39;m a walking map,&quot; you mutter, though there&#39;s a hint of humor in your voice.<br />
<br />
Ted chuckles, patting your metal-clad shoulder. &quot;Hey, at least it&#39;s a pretty cool design. Maybe more will connect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite the unsettling changes, you find yourself oddly at ease. The realization that you’re still yourself—physically capable, mentally present—brings a newfound confidence. You grab your fork and knife, cutting into your pancake with ease, even though both of your arms are now fully metallic.<br />
<br />
“Look at that,&quot; you say, gesturing with your fork. &quot;No problem at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted grins at you from across the table. “Almost like those changes were designed not to hinder basic tasks, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe,” you reply thoughtfully, taking a bite and savoring the familiar taste. “It’s strange, but I feel... functional. Even powerful.”<br />
<br />
Ted nods, chewing thoughtfully. &quot;You know, if anyone could pull off being part-metal, it would be you.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Ted,” you say, smiling warmly. “I’m glad you’re here with me.”<br />
<br />
He raises his coffee mug in a mock toast. “To new adventures and unexpected upgrades.”<br />
<br />
Clinking your metallic fingers against his mug, you laugh. “To whatever comes next.”<br />
<br />
As you both continue eating breakfast, you shift uncomfortably in your chair, a surreal sensation blooming at the base of your spine. Ted leans over again, wide-eyed as he points out, &quot;The lines are now reaching your soles.&quot;<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re kidding,&quot; you mutter, feeling a tingling sensation spread down your legs. You give up the battle with curiosity and stand up, feeling the ground beneath your feet begin to change.<br />
<br />
The thin green lines run down the length of your legs, branching further as they reach your feet. The tingling intensifies, and you can feel your soles becoming thicker and more rigid. It&#39;s as if your bones are hardening and expanding against your will. You lift one foot, watching in morbid fascination as it transitions into a solid green.<br />
<br />
The transformation is unsettlingly intricate. Your toes merge and reshape, the flesh condensing and hardening into a solid mass. The skin bulks out, forming layers of interlocking metal plates, each one tinged with a deep green and bordered by golden rims. These plates extend outward, evolving into the soles of armored boots.<br />
<br />
You move your foot experimentally, feeling the boots’ solidity against the floor. They feel like extensions of your body, each movement fluid and intuitive despite the newfound rigidity. As you shift your weight, the transformation continues to progress upwards, the metal crawling along your feet and calves like a living entity.<br />
<br />
The plates build upon one another, creating an intricate lattice of overlapping sections. Each piece locks seamlessly into place, forming the armored boots’ shafts up to your knees. The golden accents shimmer in the morning light, adding an almost regal touch to the menacing green armor encasing your lower extremities.<br />
<br />
As the transformation reaches your thighs, the familiar sensation returns—your skin morphs into a fine layer of chain mail, intricate and delicate but undeniably strong. The mesh tapers upwards, connecting seamlessly with the gauntlets already adorning your arms and shoulders.<br />
<br />
Ted, who has been observing in stunned silence, finally speaks. &quot;Your legs... they&#39;re just like your arms now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod, still processing the transformation. &quot;Yeah, and I can still feel through them, just like with my hands. It’s not like wearing boots; it feels... integrated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted runs a hand gently down your armored leg, marveling at the craftsmanship. &quot;The detail is incredible,&quot; he says, almost reverently. &quot;You could be a character out of a fantasy game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite the bizarre nature of the transformation, you can’t help but feel a strange sense of admiration for the intricate design enveloping your body. &quot;It’s surreal,&quot; you admit, flexing your now-armored toes and legs. &quot;Surreal but... incredible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted chuckles, a lighthearted tone breaking through the tension. &quot;Well, if this keeps going, who knows what you&#39;ll look like by the end of the day. But hey, you’ll definitely be the best-dressed person around.&quot;<br />
<br />
You laugh, a mixture of anxiety and acceptance in your voice. &quot;Here&#39;s hoping the rest of me can keep up.&quot;<br />
<br />
You and Ted decide to go about your usual household chores, trying to maintain a sense of normalcy despite your ongoing transformation. By noon, the chain mail has crept up to your groin area, and a wave of anxiety hits you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ted, what am I going to do when it reaches... you know,&quot; you stutter, your concern clear.<br />
<br />
Ted looks at you with a mix of compassion and determination. &quot;We&#39;ll figure this out together,&quot; he assures you. &quot;Come on, let’s see what’s happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
He helps you remove your pants to observe the changes more closely. The fine chain mail, previously confined to your thighs, now encroaches on your groin, the intricate, metallic weave shifting as it moves upwards. The sensation is unsettling, a blend of tingling and pressure as the metal aligns itself with your anatomy.<br />
<br />
Soon, the chain mail reaches your bum, and green metal plates begin to form around it. Each plate materializes seamlessly, sporting a deep green hue and golden rims that add a touch of elegance. The plates interlock with one another, forming a protective, yet flexible layer over your bum while skillfully avoiding your member for the time being.<br />
<br />
&quot;How am I supposed to... you know, use the bathroom like this?&quot; you wonder aloud, looking back at Ted with growing concern.<br />
<br />
Ted, ever the empathetic companion, steps closer. &quot;Let’s take a closer look,&quot; he suggests, cautiously examining your newly formed metal armor. His fingers gently prod around the area, and he soon discovers a small flap integrated into the armor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got something here,&quot; Ted announces, his tone a mix of curiosity and relief. &quot;Looks like it’s a functional flap, probably designed for, well, that.&quot;<br />
<br />
He fiddles with the flap, demonstrating how it can be opened and closed with ease. &quot;See? You’re covered.&quot;<br />
<br />
You breathe a sigh of relief, marveling at the thoughtfulness of the design. &quot;I guess I won&#39;t have to worry about that part,&quot; you say with a small chuckle.<br />
<br />
Ted grins, giving your armored rump a light pat. &quot;Looks like whoever—or whatever—made this transformation happen knew what they were doing. You’ll be alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Ted steps back, satisfied with his findings, you suddenly feel an unsettling tingling sensation around your groin. You glance down to see your penis starting to change—the skin turning a deep, verdant green. A shiver of anxiety courses through you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ted,&quot; you say, trying to steady your voice, &quot;I need you to use it while it&#39;s still... here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Understanding the urgency and gravity in your voice, Ted nods without hesitation. His hands move to your groin, gently rubbing your rapidly transforming member. The caress sends waves of arousal through you, amplifying the already strange sensations.<br />
<br />
You watch, almost in disbelief, as the transformation continues. Your penis begins to elongate and thicken, the green skin taking on a leathery texture. The shaft wraps itself in green leather, forming the grip of a sword. An emerald orb materializes at the tip, glistening with a brilliant, otherworldly light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ted… it’s changing...&quot; you gasp, a mix of pleasure and panic in your voice.<br />
<br />
Ted&#39;s touch does not waver. His fingers trail down to your ball sack, which is merging into the forming sword&#39;s rain-guard. Each motion fuels your arousal, a confusing blend of longing and fear.<br />
<br />
As he continues to rub, you feel the hilt extend outward, revealing more and more of the blade. The transformation is intricate, the blade materializing with exquisite craftsmanship—a mix of green and silver, shimmered with golden accents.<br />
<br />
Despite the bizarre nature of the transformation, the arousal heightens with every inch that forms. Ted&#39;s touch guides the changes, his fingers tracing the emerging blade. The pleasure crescendos as the sword reaches completion, the entire length detaching from your body.<br />
<br />
In a sudden and profound shift, the arousal dissipates, replaced by an overwhelming sense of calm. The sword, once an integral part of you, now lies completed and separate, an artifact of your transformation.<br />
<br />
Ted looks at you, then back at the sword. &quot;Are you... alright?&quot; he asks, his voice tinged with concern.<br />
<br />
Realizing the profound calm that has settled over you, you breathe out, &quot;Yeah, I think so. It&#39;s strange, but... I feel okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted picks up the sword, examining it closely. &quot;This is extraordinary,&quot; he says, running his fingers over the emerald orb and the green leather hilt. &quot;It’s like unlocking a piece of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, you agree. &quot;A piece I never knew existed until now.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you marvel at the completed sword in Ted&#39;s hand, you feel another unfamiliar sensation in your groin. Looking down, you see your exposed flesh closing up, forming a green codpiece that seamlessly integrates with the rest of your armored form. The transformation doesn&#39;t stop there; the changes creep upwards, molding into a sturdy green belt and an ornate holster designed specifically for the sword.<br />
<br />
You glance at Ted, who’s still holding the sword. &quot;Mind handing me that?&quot; <br />
<br />
He nods and passes it to you. Taking the hilt in your metallic hand, you casually slip the blade into the holster affixed to your belt. &quot;Don’t want to lose it,&quot; you quip, trying to inject some levity into the situation. &quot;It might come in handy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted chuckles, catching the subtle undercurrent of your apprehension. &quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; he says reassuringly. &quot;Better safe than sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
The afternoon and evening pass in a strangely routine manner. The changes to your body progress slowly, methodically, almost becoming a rhythm you come to expect. Your torso morphs into plated armor, each segment an intricate piece of green metal edged with gold. Beneath the armor, a fine mesh of chain mail ensures flexibility while adding an additional layer of protection.<br />
<br />
As the evening light dims, Ted takes a moment to step back and truly look at you. His eyes trace the contours of your newly transformed figure, and a soft smile forms on his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; he says, his voice gentle and sincere, &quot;you look incredible. Actually, I have to admit, I find you very attractive this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
The words catch you by surprise. You&#39;ve been so focused on the strangeness and fear of your transformation that you&#39;d barely thought about how anyone else might perceive you. &quot;Really?&quot; you ask, your tone half-disbelieving, half-curious.<br />
<br />
He nods, stepping closer and placing a hand on your armored chest. &quot;Absolutely. You&#39;re like a guardian or a knight out of a legend. There’s something profoundly striking about you now. And it&#39;s still you in there—that’s what matters most.&quot;<br />
<br />
A warm smile spreads across your face, and for a moment, the unease of your changes fades into the background. &quot;Thanks, Ted. That means a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
He leans in, his forehead resting against your armored shoulder. &quot;Whatever happens next, I&#39;m here with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You embrace him as best you can, your fully armored arms—holding him close. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want anyone else by my side.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the changes continue their relentless advance, you feel the subtle yet inexorable creep of chain mail climbing up your neck. An unsettling yet curious sensation spreads across your scalp as your hair begins to shift. The once familiar strands move and concentrate, consolidating into a single, centralized point as the rest of your head is gradually enveloped in the same green metal plates that have overtaken your body.<br />
<br />
You watch with a blend of fascination and apprehension as your hair transforms into a flamboyant feather, extending proudly atop what is becoming your helmet. The vibrant feather contrasts sharply with the deep green and golden hues of your armor, creating a striking visual. <br />
<br />
&quot;This must be it,&quot; you think, &quot;the final change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted seems to sense the significance of the moment. He steps closer and wraps you in a gentle, tender kiss. As his lips meet the cool metal, you feel a shiver of warmth and love. Slowly, gradually, you feel the changes envelop your face. Your eyes are replaced by a sleek metallic visor, your vision shifting to a sharper, more focused clarity. The sensation is both disorienting and empowering.<br />
<br />
Your mouth and nose seize up, the flesh and tissues solidifying into metal. Your head completes its transformation into the helmet of this incredible suit of armor. You suddenly become aware that you no longer need to breathe, which sends a wave of panic surging through you. But just as quickly, you realize that you&#39;re alright—more than alright, in fact.<br />
<br />
Ted&#39;s eyes widen in horror as he takes in the final transformation. You reach out instinctively, wanting to reassure him, but realize in your current form, you can no longer speak. Instead, you lift one of your armored hands and give him a firm thumbs up.<br />
<br />
Ted&#39;s expression softens, relief flooding his features. &quot;You&#39;re okay,&quot; he says, more to himself than to you. His trembling hand reaches out to touch your helmet, testing the reality of the situation.<br />
<br />
Feeling a surge of newfound energy and power, you decide to show Ted just how alive you feel. You strike a pose, standing tall and broad, no longer bound by the limitations of your former human body. <br />
<br />
You now resemble a fully animated suit of medieval-inspired armor, both exquisite and formidable. Your entire body is covered in intricately designed green metal plates edged in gold, interlocking seamlessly to form a flexible yet unbreakable shell. The golden lines accentuate every joint and curve, glinting in the light. Your shoulders and chest are bulked up, the spaulders robust and regal. Chain mail peeks out from beneath the armor, providing the necessary flexibility.<br />
<br />
Your gauntlets are detailed with fine craftsmanship, each finger articulated, moved by unseen mechanisms. The feather atop your helmet flutters slightly, an elegant flair amidst the imposing design. The visor where your eyes once were is opaque, giving nothing away, yet you see with perfect clarity.<br />
<br />
Ted takes a step back, eyes wide but filled with admiration. &quot;You... you look incredible,&quot; he manages to say.<br />
<br />
Nodding your helmeted head, you feel a rush of exhilaration, a sense of being more alive and powerful than you ever were as a human. You are a living embodiment of strength, a guardian forged from metal and magic, ready to face whatever comes next.<br />
<br />
The surreal day draws to a close as Ted wraps you in his arms once more. The two of you climb into bed, yet you soon realize that sleep is no longer a necessity for you as an enchanted suit of armor. Ted&#39;s warmth against your cold, metallic frame provides comfort, and as he drifts off to sleep, you find yourself entrenched in thought.<br />
<br />
As the hours pass in contemplative silence, you begin to explore your new form both mentally and physically, becoming more attuned to the unique sensations and capabilities it offers. Eventually, a notion surfaces in your mind—a faint whisper of an idea—that you might be able to change back. It feels almost like discovering an unused muscle you never knew you had. Tentatively, you concentrate, willing yourself into a particular mental state, flexing this newfound &quot;muscle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly but steadily, the metal plates soften, the chain mail loosens, and your flesh and bones begin to reemerge. The transformation is deliberate and methodical, taking time as you carefully reverse the changes. The helmet retracts into a face, the armor morphs back into skin, and by the time Ted stirs awake, you have fully returned to your human form.<br />
<br />
Ted stretches and sits up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. He looks at you, a hint of disappointment flickering across his face. &quot;You&#39;re... human again?&quot; he asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; you say, a bit sheepishly. &quot;I figured out how to change back last night while you were sleeping.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted furrows his brow, trying to process this. &quot;I mean, it&#39;s good that you can switch back and forth, but... I kind of liked your armored form.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod, understanding his sentiment. &quot;The seller did mention that the first transformation is slow, but it gets faster next times.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted&#39;s eyes light up at the prospect. &quot;Really? How fast do you think it will be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only one way to find out,&quot; you grin. &quot;Let’s have some breakfast first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted eagerly agrees, and the two of you head to the kitchen, preparing a hearty meal. The mundane task of cooking and eating brings a sense of normalcy, though both of you are buzzing with anticipation. You can’t help but wonder how fast and different the second transformation will be.<br />
<br />
As you finish the last bites of your meal, you look at Ted, who’s practically bouncing with excitement. &quot;Ready for round two?&quot; you ask, your heart pounding in anticipation.<br />
<br />
Ted nods enthusiastically. &quot;Absolutely.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a determined breath, you take off the ring, expecting a change that doesn&#39;t come. With a shrug, you slide it back onto your finger.<br />
<br />
Within seconds, you feel the familiar tingling sensations spreading rapidly across your body. This time, the transformation happens much quicker. The green metal plates envelop your skin, locking into place with seamless precision. Your spine once again aligns into a fine chain mail, your feet reshape into robust armored boots, and your chest and arms form the protective gauntlets and plates.<br />
<br />
As the changes reach your head, your hair consolidates into the flamboyant feather and your face is enclosed by the helmet again. In less than 30 seconds, you are once more a formidable, animated suit of armor. The sword materializes and falls to the floor between your legs, glinting brightly with its emerald orb and green leather hilt.<br />
<br />
Once transformed, you realize you cannot speak. Ted’s eyes gleam with enthusiasm as he steps forward and hugs you tightly, the warmth of the gesture comforting against your cold metal frame. You can feel his heartbeat and the life within his embrace as he holds you close.<br />
<br />
After a few moments, you concentrate once more, flexing that mental &quot;muscle&quot; and willing yourself back to human form. The transformation reverses swiftly, your flesh and bones reemerging from the green and gold metal, the intricate chain mail fading back into your skin. In a flash, you are human again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was quick,&quot; you note, catching your breath. &quot;This could be really useful for defense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted&#39;s eyes shine with excitement. &quot;It really could be! And you did it so fast this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod, then remember the second ring. &quot;Hey, there&#39;s another ring... the blueish one. Maybe you should try it out yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ted looks at you, his excitement tempered by a touch of curiosity. &quot;You think it’ll work the same way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only one way to find out,&quot; you say, holding the blue-tinged ring out to him with a grin.<br />
<br />
Ted hesitates only for a moment before taking the ring from your palm. &quot;Alright then,&quot; he says, slipping it onto his finger.<br />
<br />
Both of you wait, eager to discover what changes might come next.</p>
