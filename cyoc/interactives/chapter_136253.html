<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa was still in her nightgown, so she picked clean clothes for the day. Cute black and purple striped panties and matching bras, a pair of denim short shorts, and a purple crop top.<br />
<br />
She found it harder than usual to slip into her shorts. She had gone through a growth spurt the past few months and had outgrown several of her outfits. Today again, she found it hard to stuff her asscheeks into the shorts, and harder to button it up. Her belly had always had a bit of a cute chub but now it was firmer - bulgeing from the massive amount of cum Max had shot. She had no idea dog balls had so much in stock...<br />
<br />
Of course she was oblivious to the fact that it had not been a regular dog that she had had sex with in the dark, but Erika in her mutant canine form.<br />
<br />
When Melissa put on her bra, it was even worse. Her breasts, already quite big for her age, looked especially swollen. The aerolas also seemed a shade darker than she remembered, and quite puffy. She cupped the overflowing orbs and they felt oversensitive.<br />
<br />
Her brother knocked on her door and barged in; she immediately stopped gropping her breasts, though the fabric of her top still outlined her nipples visibly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want, Cole?&quot; she asked in a moody voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sis... just wanted to talk about last night&quot;, Cole started, uneasy.<br />
<br />
Melissa gave him a somber look, but he went on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I just wanted to say, it&#39;s not Erika&#39;s fault. I know you played &quot;spin the bottle&quot; with the vodka from the cabinet last night, and, well, ok I was stupid... I bumped into Erika last night when she went to the bathroom and she was drunk, and maybe I took advantage of it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa couldn&#39;t know that this was a lie, but Cole thought the truth would be worse. How do you explain to your sister that her best friend turns into a canine creature unless she jerk off or ingest mutant cum?<br />
<br />
&quot;Cole!! you asshole...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok ok listen, I know this was a dick move... I mean! I know this was shitty. We didn&#39;t do much anyway, it was really more of a &quot;playing doctor&quot; thing that went overboard. I&#39;m sorry for making you mad, but don&#39;t hold grudges against Erika ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You better watch your back &#39;cause I won&#39;t forget this, dickhead&quot; Melissa hissed.<br />
<br />
Cole went to his own room and Melissa stayed in the doorframe for a moment, trying to control her anger. Perhaps her brother was saying the truth. Perhaps a part of her wanted to hold onto this belief; she didn&#39;t want to lose her best friend and crush...<br />
<br />
Suddendly she got hit with an even stronger nausea and had to run to the bathroom, emptying her stomach content in the toilet. Her whole body was shivering.<br />
<br />
The doubt started creeping in.<br />
<br />
She had seen the movies; women feeling morning sickness, discovering they were pregnant. Melissa let the idea sink in, terrified. How could that be possible though? From all she knew, dogs and humans could not have babies together.<br />
<br />
She opened one of the drawers in the bathroom, looking for pregnancy tests she&#39;d seen before. Her mother was supposedly on birth control but she still kept them at hand just in case.<br />
<br />
Dropping her shorts and sitting on the toilet, she read the instructions and took one of the weird sticks. It was probably too early for the test to work... but since she sounded like she had symptoms anyway, she released the pressure of her bladder to pee, placing the stick into the urine stream.<br />
<br />
She waited a few minutes for the results to show and held the box next to the stick to compare.<br />
<br />
It read as positive; she was pregnant.<br />
<br />
&quot;No no no no... this can&#39;t be possible!&quot; Melissa whimpered. She pulled up her panties and shorts and paced in the bathroom. She burried the used stick in the trash, hoping no one would look too closely into its content.<br />
<br />
She needed help, but she couldn&#39;t ask anyone. She couldn&#39;t tell her family or even a doctor she had sex with a dog! And the only trustworthy friend she had was Erika...<br />
<br />
After a moment of hesitation, she grabbed her phone and started texting.<br />
<br />
<b>Melissa</b> - <i>we need to talk</i><br />
<br />
She waited anxiously for an answer. Seeing how angry she had been after catching Erika sucking on her brother&#39;s dick, maybe her friend would refuse to talk to her... She stared at the screen, waiting for the familiar chime, hopeful.<br />
<br />
Finally, the reply came in.<br />
<br />
<b>Erika</b> - <i>I&#39;m sorry about Cole, please I don&#39;t want to lose you</i><br />
<br />
Melissa didn&#39;t want to talk about this matter right now. Her problem was a bigger concern.<br />
<br />
<b>Melissa</b> - <i>i know, he told me it&#39;s not your fault</i><br />
<b>Melissa</b> - <i>look i&#39;m still mad but this isn&#39;t about that</i><br />
<b>Erika</b> - <i>I&#39;m listening</i><br />
<b>Melissa</b> - <i>please don&#39;t tell anyone, i can&#39;t tell the other girls</i><br />
<br />
She paused for a minute before typing, not sure how to phrase the next part.<br />
<br />
<b>Melissa</b> - <i>i think i may be pregnant</i><br />
<br />
She waited for seemed like an eternity. Finally Erika sent a reply.<br />
<br />
<b>Erika</b> - <i>Who did you have sex with?</i><br />
<br />
Melissa&#39;s hands were trembling. She tried very hard not to think about the memory of what the hard canine knot felt like inside her.<br />
<br />
<b>Melissa</b> - <i>look this is personal, it happened that&#39;s all</i><br />
<b>Melissa</b> - <i>what should I do now? i&#39;m in the bathroom, just threw up</i><br />
<b>Melissa</b> - <i>my belly feels bloated, my breasts are super sore</i><br />
<b>Erika</b> - <i>are you sure you&#39;re pregnant? maybe it&#39;s just bad cramps</i><br />
<b>Melissa</b> - <i>just stole a pregnancy test from my mother</i><br />
<b>Melissa</b> - <i>it&#39;s positive</i><br />
<b>Erika</b> - <i>can&#39;t you take one of those morning after pills</i><br />
<b>Melissa</b> - <i>maybe</i><br />
<b>Melissa</b> - <i>i guess i&#39;ll try</i><br />
<b>Melissa</b> - <i>please don&#39;t tell anybody, i&#39;m freaking out</i><br />
<b>Melissa</b> - <i>i&#39;ll see you at school tomorrow</i><br />
<b>Erika</b> - <i>take care ok?</i><br />
<br />
What a waste of time... It&#39;s not like Erika could find a magic solution to her situation anyway. She was barely 12, a year younger than Melissa.<br />
<br />
Looking up to her own reflection, Melissa knew she didn&#39;t look her age. Her developped hips, her full ass, her swollen breasts constricted in her small crop top... Even her own face looked a little older somehow.<br />
<br />
Melissa turned this and that way, absorbed in her own thoughts and forgetting for a minute her predicament. In spite of what was happening to her, she found some comfort in looking prettier and prettier, instead of a dull childish figure. Granted, she had always been more mature than her peers, but this morning especially she felt... almost like a real woman.<br />
<br />
Looking into the drawer again, Melissa grabbed the boxes of contraceptive her mother kept, looking for morning after pills. Swallowing twice the amount the instructions advised, she then put everything back and exited the bathroom, trying to act normal.<br />
<br />
The day passed with Melissa in anguish, waiting for the least sign of her body that she was no pregnant anymore. She worked on her homework, since it would be Monday next morning. She expected to get her periods or some physical proof the pills had worked, but nothing so far.<br />
<br />
Mostly her nausea lessened and she started getting mild cramps, but nothing spectacular.<br />
<br />
She was quieter than usual for dinner that evening. So was her brother Cole. Each retreated to their own room after that, no speaking a word. Their parents didn&#39;t seem to notice.<br />
<br />
Laying in her bed at night, Melissa kept thinking about Erika and Max, her thoughts switching from one to the other restlessly. She already knew she had feelings for her friend, but now she also felt attraction to her friend&#39;s husky. It felt gross, although a little part of her was somehow excited to hold some dirty secret.<br />
<br />
In her sleep and dreams, she shivered; her body was still growing in subtle ways.</p>
