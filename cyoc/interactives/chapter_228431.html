<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The day would have been among the greatest days in Amanda’s life if it hadn’t been for the fact that they had no idea where they were. The six of them all mounted on their horses had moved through open fields with tall grasses and lots of wildflowers, they had moved through some old wild woods following well worn animal trails. They had even crossed a few streams which went up to around the horses’ bellies but yet there was no sign of life.<br />
<br />
“Got some berries is anyone wants some.” Offered Wendy as she sat bareback on her horse. <br />
<br />
They had seen no sign of human life, no road, no houses, not even farm fields, they hadn’t even found trash which you could find almost anywhere you went. They had gotten no cell phone signal and seeing that the phones were quickly losing power, they had turned off all but one. When that one had died they turned on another. <br />
<br />
“Are you sure they are safe?” inquired Marcus.<br />
<br />
“For the most part, they seam to be blue berries, the plants looked identical to what I know.” Explained Wendy “But given how strange this place is…”<br />
<br />
“I’ll wait until we see if anything happens to you.” Stated Lucy <br />
<br />
“That is what I was thinking as well.” Confirmed Wendy “But thought I would offer anyhow.”<br />
<br />
A few hours later and yet nothing had happened to Wendy, they all began to eat of the berries and other plants which seamed to be the same as back home. <br />
<br />
“Anyone got an knife?” inquired Luke <br />
<br />
“I do.” Confirmed Ben which was among the most he had spoken the entire day. As he pulled out a pocket knife. <br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Said Luke as he began to strike a rock with the knife to make a fire. <br />
<br />
They had stopped about an hour before sundown, finding a small hill which was surrounded by open grassland, a stream was at the bottom of the hill which they were using to water the horses and to get something to drink themselves. <br />
<br />
“We still no idea where we are.” Confirmed Marcus as darkness began to fall and the fire began to glow as Luke got it going. <br />
<br />
“I am more concerned that we saw no signs of people.” Stated Amanda “We had to cover what…12 or 15 miles and yet nothing.”<br />
<br />
“We even saw deer that didn’t react to us.” Added Marcus “Something strange is going on.”<br />
<br />
“I can say that…look at that.” stated Ben as all of them turned toward him, he was pointing at the sky. The darkness had quickly fallen and the stars were out and in the distance the moon was rising. Everything seamed normal.<br />
<br />
“Look at what?” inquired Wendy<br />
<br />
“The stars are in the wrong place for one.” Stated Ben as the shy guy seamed somewhat for sure which was strange for him. <br />
<br />
“Are you sure?” inquired Amanda but her questioning of him disappeared as coming out from behind a distant mountain and a large amount of clouds which seamed to be there was a second moon.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck.” Said Marcus “Where the hell are we?”<br />
<br />
“Wh…ere ar…e we?” Came a new voice as everyone jumped and looked toward the source but saw nothing but the horses which where all looking at the moon as well and then at one of the horses. <br />
<br />
“Who said that!” yelled Luke as he picked up one of the sticks by the fire and using it as a torch held it in front of him.<br />
<br />
“Can…can…you he…hear…me?” said the voice in broken English as one of the horses came forward. <br />
<br />
It was Midnight, a large black stallion which Marcus’s rode. Then to everyone’s amazement its now almost human lips moved, and it spoke.<br />
<br />
“Can…you, hear me?” inquired the voice much stronger than before.<br />
<br />
“Did my horse just talk?” inquired Marcus.<br />
<br />
“They can hear us?” Said a female voice in amazement as Amanda’s mare, Daisy a golden honey color mare came forward and to everyone confusion large clumps of her hair around her neck had fallen off. What was under it, however, wasn’t normal horse flesh but flesh that looked very human.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” inquired Luke as suddenly he winced in pain and dropped his torch as he fell to the ground. <br />
<br />
Amanda picked it up as she looked down at Luke.<br />
<br />
“I must have stepped in something.” Stated Luke as he pulled off his shoe, as he did everyone noticed that his sock had ripped apart, his toes had fused together and had started to turn black, like the hooves of a horse.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck is going on?” inquired Amanda as every human looked at Luke’s now semi Hooven foot while the horses looked at the flesh on Daisy. Everyone wondered what was happening.</p>
