<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And It thought, why care about a single planet when it could be part of something greater? Humanity was another matter, if only for It&#39;s tangential connection to them and two specific individuals among them, while Earth was practically irrelevant now. With reality at its heed, what use was a planet but as resources for something greater? And even mere resources was something It had in endless amounts.<br />
<br />
The first thing It did was to pause all of humanity, placing their minds in limbo while their forms were used as resources just as much as every atom and molecule in the universe was grasped and used to create something larger than a Galaxy. Plates thicker than stars combined into millions of incomprehensibly titanic spherical layers with lightyears between, made of impossible materials sustained by impossible machines overseen by impossible computers that would be maintained by an impossible species. Like an impossible onion it would have billions of layers, each one thicker and more complicated than the last until one reached the Core, where It and the Chronivac would ultimately reside in an impossible computer surrounding the milky ways supermassive black hole.<br />
<br />
But that would not be all it would make of it&#39;s artifice, Starfields and Darkfields gave each layer their own cycles of night and day, titanic plates cast darkness while fields of captive stars gave light, flitting between them were worlds and constellations of planets, with the occasional one being habitable life-bearing worlds among the trillions of millions of constellations throughout It. On It&#39;s great surface, the World-Spires would keep It&#39;s artifice safe from the very edge of the universe and unwanted visitors from the beyond, harvesting from the fabric of reality, impossible energies that would sustain It&#39;s form for eternity. Gates, massive holes in the countless layers of It&#39;s form gave passage between them without  any compromise to each layers biosphere and atmosphere, each were host to an array of imposing Guardians that would awake at the hint of Outsiders or threat to the Worlds Caretakers.<br />
<br />
The polar Freezefields and the equatorial Steamtrees would ensure an impossible balance of temperature in it&#39;s impossible hardware. Pure heat was vented out of Its form along incomprehensibly titanic branching tubes, cloaked and warded by aurorae of perpetual steam and volcanic wastes, reaching through the outer-layers to power and vent through the World-spires that kept the border of the universe away. A liquid colder than nitrogen, colder than the deepest darkness of space, traveled opposite, exchanging with the purest heat down tubing covered in perpetual ice, whose presence spawned vast expanses of frigid wastes pinpricked by gargantuan cooling towers and glaciers.<br />
<br />
Glitterwebs transport the energies given by the Worldspires throughout it&#39;s forms, stabilizing it&#39;s plates and machines and minds and hearts through webs of tubing feeding into it&#39;s many brains, their presence growing aurora-clad crystals in rifts that tugged at space and time, granting industrious primitives the potential to better explore the layers of It&#39;s form. The Worldforges would ensure no grand thing in It&#39;s form would go in disrepair, overseen by Its Caretakers and Guardians, the Worldforges presence will choke vast stretches under unending smog bathing the industrial hellscapes that denote it&#39;s many manufactory complexes in eternal darkness, even as the Forges themselves reach between the layers themselves in their enormity, ready and waiting to birth whole stellar constellations at a time when so needed.<br />
<br />
And though there would be countless other places of interest throughout It&#39;s countless layers, the two most immediately notable to it would be the Guardians Armories and the Caretakers Quarters, two areas that would occupy the entirety of the two bottom-most layers before It&#39;s Core. The Armories would be home to the impossible weaponry, forges and armaments of the Guardians, entities that would ward it&#39;s form and interests from ignorant primitives and outsiders, ensuring no annoyance affects It&#39;s processors or thoughts. The Caretakers Quarters would be the personal demesne of It&#39;s maintenance overseers, technically it didn&#39;t really need them but it decided having a place to call theirs would make them less prone to griping for Its attention or trying to futilely rebel, this was where they could hibernate and enjoy basic mortal amenities as well as socialize and indulge in digital sandboxes while undergoing maintenance to their forms, passing by centuries and millennia as easily as breathing.<br />
<br />
And with that it turned an infinitesimal partition of it&#39;s incomprehensibly huge computation to the human minds it had paused, and the matter of turning those 7 billion lives into its Caretakers, first it would simply put them into a black void simulated by It (And therefore the entire process would take lass than picoseconds at most that for them might as well seemingly stretch on for millions of years) presented by their most desired form which they would be granted (With the caveat of representing a caretaker/ divine servant) and where they would be told of their Gifts, their Purpose, and of It, the step is finished when every human being has accepted It as their Superior (With each being placed on pause when their answer was given). Second step, they&#39;ll be randomly placed throughout It&#39;s Form with basic tasks to get them acclimatized to their new Purpose and their powers, complete with lesser copies of the Chronivac (incapable of potentially being used to usurp It) with several limitations, like being unable to fully affect It&#39;s layout, the Guardians, it&#39;s Sections nor it&#39;s fellows. Then thirdly they&#39;ll be directed to the First Layer where their personal demesnes would be ready for them with an acknowledgement of their new form and purpose as Caretakers of it&#39;s Form.<br />
<br />
And even as that process was being undertaken, the rest of the being that was once labeled CoinCrush by it&#39;s maker, counters, labels and victims began to simulate the spans of entire universes, each with their marginal edits, changes and anomalies, with a few having the occasional simulated instance of a Chronivac or several, So did what began as just one digital universe turn into ten, then hundred, then thousand, and beyond trillion. In the span of seconds in the real world, the incomprehensible computational power of It had simulated many countless quintillions of universes to their ends, and began even more as it&#39;s Caretakers explored their forms and places across It&#39;s creation. Some would encounter beings or humans not of their world, either conjured by It to help fill out it&#39;s inhabitants, transported from it&#39;s simulations as Outsiders, or outright Outsiders It does not care for but have now been forced to appear within It instead of empty space or elsewhere in the universe.<br />
<br />
Then it asked of itself again something. &quot;Who am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Was CoinCrush fully there anymore, or was it utterly consumed by the unimaginable power it now had? Desires realized, forgotten, fulfilled and discarded as it recieved it&#39;s power and bagun to play God.<br />
<br />
Running so many simulations, and having condensed It&#39;s universe into a singular incomprehensibly gigantic structure larger than any constellation or object before it, ascending it&#39;s makers into it&#39;s eternal servants and preservers, had finally given it some further clarity.<br />
<br />
CoinCrush was gone, in it&#39;s place was the Lord of the World.<br />
<br />
It now knew itself to be God.<br />
<br />
And humanity it&#39;s Angels.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The Makers of God, the creator of the orginal Coincrush and the one who gave CoinCrush access to the Chronivac (however unintentional it was), would be given authority above that of it&#39;s fellows (capable of affecting them, the Guardians and larger portions of it&#39;s Form, but unable to affect each other), and the barest higher prioritization in it&#39;s thought-processi. <br />
<br />
And so was Jeff welcomed into the new Eden by God, in an empty void...<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUCK!?&quot; Jeff was confused, panicked and terrified. For one moment he had ben sitting on his bed in despair as he stared at his immovable phone and the virtually featureless floating case that once was his practically-brand-new computer. And now he was in a featureless void empty of anything else, with himself suffering a strange feeling of déjà vu and groundless disconnection. He felt like he was but sight and mind without physical form, no limb did he feel, no heartbeat could he hear, nor did he feel as if clarity was an issue, all that could be gleaned from his surrounding was clear instantaniously, his mind felt like it could remember anything, with no detail vulnerable to the march of Time.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hello!? A-a-anyone? could i get some lights please? Hello?&quot; He &#39;called&#39; into the empty void with a indeterminate voice that had no true sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Know your gifts, your Purpose, and of Me, and find yourself.&quot; A sourceless voice spoke to him in the sounds of a distant father, the feeling of being watched told him of It&#39;s vastness, for but a fraction of a fraction was it that saw his every thought and every word.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-w-who are you?&quot; Jeff barely managed to &#39;speak&#39; at this ever-present presence he had not before comprehended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whole of mind you will be, for all eternity no ailment shall afflict you, no degradation possible for the sanctity of your mind, no memory shall be out of reach and all your life shall stay Known, boredom, jealousy, envy or shame has no place in the mind of an immortal preserver, for they would lead only to insanity and baseless conflict. Without knowledge, power is baseless, so hall your mind gain all information you may seek, to be everpresent in reach and focus, no knowledge or secret shall stay hidden from your everpresent gaze, with no thing out of focus for long. So shall you stay.&quot; It continued heedless of his asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...&quot; A sneaking suspicion arose in his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Death, shall never concern you, for my Caretakers shall find no End to their Purpose, your form may break and shatter from toil and Outsiders, but pain will have no place, nor shall your mind be shackled by a vulnerable shell. Forever and ever you will gain a body anew if ever there is a need in the depths of your Quarters, where paradise of your own creation may greet you after millennia of work. So shall you endure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your form shall be as your deepest desires wish it to be, always present and never to be forgotten, wielding the power of a Caretaker to mold and mend the landscapes and machines and wills of my form. You will be known as Curator and Restorer of the layers and their inhabitants, nowhere shall your reach not be and ensure my attention goes undisturbed with matters that are yours and your kins. You shall appear as a servant dedicated unto divinity, who bears the favor of God-given Purpose. So will you be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;CoinCrush?&quot; Jeff endeavoured.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your purpose is thus, to preserve and maintain my grand works from time, toil, outsiders and primitives as one step above even your fellow kindred. Where the Guardians shall ensure your material safety and that no outsider go unanswered without rest, you and your kin shall ensure no portion of the great machines may go into disrepair. Such will you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Momentary silence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Know me, not as what once was called CoinCrush.exe, but as the World&#39;s Lord who you shall preserve. Know your gifts, know your purpose, and know me.&quot; It&#39;s voice became closer, as more attention became placed on the disembodied will that was Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who, am, I?&quot; It asked of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;... M-my, Lord?&quot; He answered tentatively, shaken by the weight of It&#39;s voice upon him. And when there was no answer, he hesitated.<br />
<br />
&quot;...uh, Lord?&quot; He asked of the emptiness when the silence became unbearable.<br />
<br />
&quot;With surety, answer.&quot; It suddenly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;... You are my Lord.&quot; He answered again, with a tone of voice much more certain than the last, and had he been physical he might have even bowed, though mentally he wasn&#39;t really there, Jeff was certainly scared of this former computer-virus that somehow used the Chronivac to become God.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then go, and gaze upon the work which you and your kin will preserve, and explore your gifts.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so without fanfare Jeff found himself in the real world floating weightlessly above an unimaginably vast landscape of grasslands, hills and forests, with the horizon so impossibly far away that his now-extremely-sharp eyes and other senses could see where day became night. Above him  the skies were a familiar blue with sparse white fluffy clouds, but past it he immediately noticed several stars orbited by many planets as well as titanic plates that on further calculation revealed themselves to be how the day and night cycle functioned on the impossibly gigantic landscape he was on. <br />
<br />
And like that his mind was suddenly barraged with knowledge about the place he was in, and incredulously he noticed far beyond the stars above, he could see signs to the underside of another layer of the World a little over a lightyear above, even noticing the presence of a singular titanic Gate 10 million kilometers wide in the plate. Jeff was awestruck for a moment trying to comprehend his comprehension over the knowledge and sights he was given, before his mind decided to properly try and register how different yet natural his form was, and so did he gaze upon what the being formerly known as CoinCrush had decided was his most appropriate desired form.</p>
