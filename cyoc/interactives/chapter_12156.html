<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took them almost a half an hour to reach the place where the store had been, but once their they found an empty store front...and nothing else.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Shit! Wha' da fuck we gonna do now,'Belle?&quot;<br />
<br />
   Annabelle sat and puzzled over the situation, feeling her body tingle all over. She looked-up at Beulah and her otherf friends and couldn't think of anything else to do.<br />
<br />
   &quot;You ladies seem disturbed by somethin. Is there anything I could do to help?&quot;<br />
<br />
   Della suddenly felt her attraction to Candy dwindle. Candy too stopped making out with her obese friend and instead turned to look at the person who'd spoken.<br />
<br />
   Standing before them...was the Fat Man.<br />
<br />
   Annabelle shot to her feet and confronted the man, her tone naturaly angry.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Wha' da fuck did you do dis teh us, fo? We didn' be doin' shit to you!&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;That's not true, Annabelle. You did the worst thing you could do to me. You laughed at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;But dat ain' no reason to fuck wit us like dis!&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;I think it is. You've gone from being young, slim young white ladies to fat, middle-age black whores. I think it's quite an improvement. Infact...it seem to me that the four of you havn't been punished enough. I'll fix the situation.<br />
<br />
   The Fat Man snapped his fingers and all four woman found themselves in a new situation. <br />
<br />
   Annabelle was dressed in a brightly colored smock and holding a brush and a comb. She looked around and saw she was in a beauty parlor called &quot;African Queen's&quot;. She looked down and saw that she was doing the hair of another black lady. Infact evenyone in the parlor was black.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Do it nice for me, Annebelle...&quot; said the woman she was working on. &quot;...I've got a hot date tonight.<br />
<br />
   Annabelle suddenly became animated, gestureing with her brush and she said &quot;Don' be worryin' bout nuttin, girlfrien'. Belle gonna make yo look hotta den you eva' done befo!&quot;<br />
  <br />
   Knowing that she couldn't do anything about her situation, Annabelle started on her coustomers hair. She seemed to have a natural skill for the work, and soon she was chattering away like a proper hairdresser.<br />
<br />
   Beulah found herself standing on a stage...stark naked! That wasn't quite true, as she had tassels on her nipples and she could feel earings bouncing in her ears. They were bouncing because she was in motion...<br />
<br />
   She was in motion because she was dancing!<br />
<br />
   Beulah was jiggling and swaying her 600+ lb. body in time with a pulsing african beat. She looked out and saw that the crowd was full of black men, all of whome were either laughing ore calling to her.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Give it up for the power of Africa! Give a big hand for the mighty Queen Beulah!&quot;<br />
<br />
   Beulah stopped dancing, and though she wanted to run off stage, she instead took a mike handed to her and bellowed &quot;Any man what want's to bounce wit de Queen, Betta get's day ass into de back room now! Ah ain't got's all day!&quot;<br />
<br />
   Then she lumbered off stage...followed by atleast a dozen large black men. As she waddled she thought &quot;Ah can't waits untill I got's dem all in de back! Den I's gonna sho dem all what a REAL Queen fuck's like!&quot;<br />
<br />
   Candy was dressed in a huge, black uniform with white trim. She inspected herself for a moment before she heard her mother shout &quot;Candy! Would you please come here?&quot;<br />
<br />
   Her first thought was that the Fat Man had forgiven her and returned her to her pld life. But as she saw her mother she realized that that wasn't true at all. Her mother said &quot;We'll be having 20 or so for dinner tonight, Candy. I'll want you to cook that goose in the fridge. Also, remember that I want you to be preasant for the meal, serving the guests. I want all my friends to see just how &quot;Ethnic&quot; my house maid is.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Chasity had gone from being her mothers daughter, to being &quot;Candy&quot;...her family's house keeper and cook!<br />
<br />
   &quot;Yez, Miz Parnell&quot; she answered.<br />
<br />
   &quot;And make sure you tell them what a wonderful boss I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Yez, Miz Parnell.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Is there any word of my daughter yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;No, Miz Parnell. Ah ain't heard nothin' fum de Po-lice.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Well, she'll turn up.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Candy waddled into the kitchen to start dinner. Her mother wasn't even worried about her! What was she going to do? If she didn't find a way to convince that Fat Man to forgive her, she'd be her mothers 500 lb. housekeeper for the rest of her life!<br />
<br />
   Della blinked and found that she was dressed in a huge blue dress and nice, flat shoes. She looked around and saw that she was in school. In her school! She looked down and saw that she was standing infront of her own class!<br />
<br />
   She was a teacher. <br />
<br />
   She looked back at the black board and saw she'd just written her name on the board. &quot;Miss Della Biggs&quot;<br />
<br />
   She turned towards the class (which had been her own class, and now realy WAS her own class!) and said &quot;Good morning, students. I am Mrs. Biggs, but you can call me Della. I'll be your teacher for the next year, so we might as well get to know each otheron a first name basis.&quot;<br />
<br />
   She continued to speak not as she'd spoken befor, but in a clear and educated tone. She searched her mind and saw that she was now a highschool teacher and her subjects were Math, Social Science and Black American History. She still spoke with an easy &quot;Hey Girl&quot; accent when dealing with her many friends, but she wasn't forced to act like a &quot;Skeezer Hoe&quot; anymore.<br />
<br />
   As her day passed she found that she had a natural knack for teaching, and that she realy enjoyed the job. Durring her break for luch she did some checking and saw she'd been a teacher for ten years, and that she'd won &quot;Teacher of the Year&quot; awards twice!<br />
<br />
   Little did she realize that the Fat Man had taken some pity on her, still punishing her for laughing at her AND for being a racist, but also letting her live a normal life. She worried about her friends though. Where were they, and were they as happy as she was?</p>
