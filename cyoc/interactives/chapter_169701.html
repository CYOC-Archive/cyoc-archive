<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Moving in actually took a lot less time then she originally thought it would, that was because she didn’t take into account the help of four rather large male monsters helping her move in. Monica’s boyfriend Sam had gotten his four roommates to help move her in and besides the werewolf Sam, there was a dragon man, an orc and a snake man. Together they had gotten all of her stuff minus the couple of boxes of his male cloths up into her room. Since as a man she had lived in a studio apartment with the largest item she had being a coach which folded out into a bed. The room she had now was actually about the same size as her old place. <br />
Once everything was settled she sat down on her coach/bed and looked around, she had her TV and her videogame system on a small TV stand in front of her bed, a chair and a small table in the corner of the room and an currently almost empty dresser in the other corner. She still had to go through her limited kitchen supplies, there was no reason for all of them to have their own private set of kitchen supplies. However as Barbara had told her, they kept 2 blenders because Sachi made insects smoothies every day.<br />
“All settled in?” inquired Monica<br />
“Basically.” Confirmed Chris “I still have to return the U-haul and find somewhere to take my male cloths.”<br />
“Well that is easy answer, there is something a kin to a goodwill but they will exchange your male cloths for some woman’s clothing or other supplies.” Stated Monica<br />
“Wait…do you need to go cloth shopping?” inquired Sachi as she stuck her head into the room. <br />
“Yes…but you don’t wear cloths anymore, same as me.” Countered Monica <br />
“Still it is fun to go shopping, besides you haven’t been cloth shopping as a woman before have you?” inquired Sachi as Chris shook her head. <br />
“Then lets go.” Stated Sachi and within a couple of minutes they where off along with Barbara. The building was set up like a good will on a massive scale with a lot of people dropping off their old cloths to either get it modified to fit their new body or exchange them for new cloths. She ended up choosing to have some of the more personal cloths adjusted to her new body, like her high school sports jacket but for the most part everything was donated and with a given amount of store credit she was pulled onto the shopping floor by Sachi with Monica beside her and Barbara walking behind. <br />
She had never been in so many different types of cloths before, it was like one of those stereotypical movies where a group of women take one of their friends to the mall and try on dozens of cloths before some big event. Here they even convinced her to try on a full dress and then a short skirt, however while they convinced her to get them the bulk of what she got were basic shirts, shorts and jeans. <br />
Once that was done it was nearing dinner time so as a thank you Chris decided to treat her new friends to dinner. So now they sat in a restaurant with an attached sports bar, there where types of monsters she had never seen before. She almost jumped when an actual Ghost floated by their table, somehow the ghost was able to hold a tray of food which he brought to the next table over. <br />
“I never asked what do you do for a living?” inquired Monica as Chris lowered her head a bit.<br />
“Well…I work at a call center.” Answered Chris before she rushed to defend herself. “I went to school for Architecture and interior design however I could never get a job out of school, with the economic downturn a few years ago and then the virus hit I never got hired.”<br />
“Wow…” said Sachi raising her hand up. “You don’t have to defend yourself to us, we all became monsters so we know life sucks.”<br />
“They are always redesigning buildings around here to better work for monsters maybe see if you can get a job with one of the companies doing that.” Offered Barbara as Chris blinked. <br />
“Ya…at least you will not have to relearn a bunch of stuff…I work as a dental assistant and now I have to learn about all the new type of teeth that monsters have.” Said Monica “Now I also have to worry about venom when I do my job.”<br />
“I work online doing IT.” Said Sachi <br />
“I work as a paralegal.” Added Barbara “We have been working on the lawsuit to get the isolation law overturned.”<br />
“My sister said she signed the online petition to get that overturned.” Added Chris before giving a sad smile. “Can I ask you guys something personal?”<br />
“Of course.” Said Sachi as everyone nodded their heads. <br />
“Alright…I was disowned by parents, most of all my older brother and parents but not my younger sister…I will say most of my friends still talk to me but my whole family minus my sister has disowned me.” Said Chris “Is it similar for you?”<br />
“Not for me.” Said Monica with a shrug before getting slumber. “However that is a story I have heard a lot, my folks live in California and they where well are hippies so they accept everyone and everything.”<br />
“I don’t know about my family.” Said Sachi her voice soft and almost weak. “I try not to think about my parents, I came to the US for school from Hong Kong and I stayed here, became a citizen thanks to my company but since the virus started there is no word coming out of China. So I don’t know what happened to them.”<br />
“Sorry.” Said Chris wondering why she had brought this subject up. <br />
“I hope they are alright but I simply don’t know.” Added Sachi as everyone looked to Barbara.<br />
“My parents died when I was younger and I have no siblings but when I got infected my girlfriend broke up with me and I learned that since then she has gotten together with a man and last I heard she got pregnant.” Stated Barbara, that caught Chris’s attention, so Barbara was a lesbian, she wasn’t sure if she was a lesbian or bi-sexual she had caught herself looking at both man and women since she turned. <br />
“Sorry I brought it up.” Apologized Chris<br />
“No…you have to know us and we have to know you.” Stated Barbara with a smile. “Still I recommend you apply to one of the Architectural and design companies, they have to design/redesign a lot of buildings because of monsterhood.”<br />
“Thanks…they would pay a lot better then working at a call center.” Stated Chris with a smile, she liked these women whom he had just met maybe in time they could become very good friends…possibly more.</p>
