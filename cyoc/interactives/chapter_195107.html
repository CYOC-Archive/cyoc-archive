<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a lot of unease that went through the Chapmans as they looked to Father Moughlin after his offer of sanctuary. The mission had been one to gain some knowledge that would help them deal with Edward Cupple&#39;s apparent scheme that had either transformed two innocent women and enslaved them into Slug Women and lead to the Chapmans also becoming Slug People. Grace had felt especially defeated in that much of starting with the Catholic Church figuring that their longer history and organization would be a greater source of knowledge on dealing with real magic in a way that most people wouldn&#39;t have experience with. But Father Moughlin really didn&#39;t have much he could provide, at least not immediately. That would mean that any lasting help would take time to be gathered and that would ultimately depend on what the Church&#39;s leadership would say with regard to Father Moughlin&#39;s request.<br />
<br />
The one thing that made them pause for a moment was the offer of shelter and sanctuary. It was true that they had escaped Cupple and had ultimate plans to make it to the Slug Person colony north of town, but that had been more for additional information. The plan was to see if the Slug People might know of a way to defeat Cupple, something that could be shared with the police or someone that would be able to take Cupple down. However, beyond that, none of them really knew on where they were to stay. The Slug People might welcome them, but that hadn&#39;t been thought out on and there was the question on whether they&#39;d be accepted. There was also the behind the scenes worry that if they settled in with the Slug People, if Father Moughlin did get a positive response from his superiors, he might not be able to contact them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d be offering us sanctuary?&quot; Whitney asked to the priest to at least confirm the offer.<br />
<br />
&quot;While waiting for what my superiors can say with regard to your request for information and help,&quot; Father Moughlin nodded, &quot;it isn&#39;t much, but it would be better than nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would it be a place where Cupple&#39;s magic couldn&#39;t penetrate?&quot; Zoe asked, moving one eyestalk to look to the priest and the other scanning over the rest of the Chapman family, noting Jeff holding Grace&#39;s hand as if to comfort her a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re talking literally neutralizing sorcery, no,&quot; Father Moughlin explained, &quot;but for the most part these sorts of people have tended to respect the sanctity of the church. The church itself might, as its consecrated ground... but the areas for those that would be given &quot;sanctuary&quot; is not actually part of the church itself. Most may not know that... but I can&#39;t say for certain on what this Cupple knows for sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t know for sure what he knows either,&quot; Jeff spoke, &quot;but we also know he&#39;s a threat and why we&#39;re out here. Trying to find something that might help find a way to protect people from his spells beyond a Slug Person&#39;s mental link to his or her &quot;hive.&quot; Which means we will need to see if any of the other churches might have some information...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And would also include contacting the Slug People&#39;s colony north of town,&quot; Lucy said in agreement with her brother, &quot;so... if we were to agree to take sanctuary, would there be a number we could call later for directions and so on? As this will likely take a good portion of the day and something we can&#39;t not do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll go get a notepad and write my cellphone number on it,&quot; Father Moughlin nodded and moved to head in and leaving the Chapmans alone to discuss the offer, &quot;Though I trust that none of your efforts will violate the law?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Whitney assured the priest, &quot;merely to defend our family and our freedom. Once we can prove Cupple&#39;s crimes, we&#39;ll deliver that evidence to the police along with what they&#39;d need to protect themselves from Cupple&#39;s magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Moughlin nodded and moved on to go inside and get the notepad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry the idea didn&#39;t work out,&quot; Grace said weakly as the priest reached the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;We knew that we weren&#39;t necessarily going to gain everything with the first try,&quot; Jeff told her, &quot;It&#39;s why we agreed to check with every church.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Zoe agreed, &quot;you may have said this was the &quot;best shot,&quot; but that doesn&#39;t mean that the others also have nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the Slug People colony might have more,&quot; Whitney added, &quot;and more space and protection... which would bring things to the father&#39;s offer of sanctuary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a kind offer,&quot; Lucy commented, &quot;but if what protection against Cupple&#39;s magic is limited, and he can&#39;t get it directly... it&#39;d be wiser to move on. Cupple is a threat now and will surely do something with his magic that&#39;s underhanded.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But would he not just move on,&quot; Zoe wondered, &quot;look to enslave people BEFORE Megan and Jenny turn them and thus bring them into their own hive mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might be part of it in the short term,&quot; Jeff countered, &quot;but you all confronted him, and mom identified him as being involved in dad&#39;s death. And while you have no proof at this time... it&#39;d still be a loose end that he can&#39;t afford to let go free. As there would be inconsistencies in his story that you could reveal, which could hurt his cover as a realtor. He&#39;d thus need to get at us again eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a degree of nervousness go through the others, and that was understandable. Cupple didn&#39;t look at strong physically, but none of them could match his magic and about the only reason they managed to get away from the Chapman house had been a result of their neighbor coming to help them and Cupple likely not wanting a fight that would attract attention that could get him in legal trouble. That gave Jeff some understanding that while Cupple&#39;s plan was likely criminal to some degree, it was still having to play to some kind of legal pretext. Which means they hadn&#39;t forced anything beyond a certain level of &quot;legal risk&quot; that Cupple didn&#39;t want to take. It&#39;d also mean that if given the chance or the perception that his actions wouldn&#39;t present any &quot;legal trouble,&quot; Cupple might go a lot farther to close any lose ends that the Chapmans represented. Though there was one bit of calm that puzzled Jeff and brought his eye stalks to focus on his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, mom?&quot; Jeff asked with Grace also looking up to Whitney. It also attracted attention from Zoe and Lucy as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree that Cupple is likely to keep coming after us,&quot; Whitney spoke, &quot;the man pretty much IS slime, given how he saw your father&#39;s funeral as a &quot;business opportunity,&quot; but that&#39;s then when all the other legal stuff comes into play. If we ultimately make some statement for sanctuary that claims fear of Cupple&#39;s actions or possible retaliation... it&#39;s likely he might not do much because it would only draw negative attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... he&#39;d want to get us but can&#39;t for fear of confirming what we&#39;ve &quot;accused&quot; him of?&quot; Zoe wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d only last for so long, though,&quot; Lucy commented, &quot;he&#39;d either come up with a new scheme... or something where the connections to him wouldn&#39;t be obvious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might give us the time needed to wait and see what Father Moughlin&#39;s superiors will say with our request,&quot; Whitney pointed out, &quot;and with an organization that Cupple would have more reason to be hesitant with than with the protestant churches that don&#39;t have the history or the Slug People that may not get as much legal protection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They may have more immediate knowledge,&quot; Lucy pointed out, &quot;and our present status... may not help us all that much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The natural magics Slug People would protect us from outright attack,&quot; Grace pointed out, &quot;people may be uncomfortable... but it&#39;s not going to be where we&#39;d get attacked outright.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which may only make defeating Cupple harder,&quot; Lucy grumbled, &quot;he might not be able to attack... but we&#39;d be under additional pressure to let him get away with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it could still be protection if we can&#39;t get any other immediate information,&quot; Jeff commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or we get rejected by the Slug People colony,&quot; Zoe added off hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; Lucy asked looking over to Zoe.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re talking about this sanctuary idea like you WANT to be accepted by the Slug People colony,&quot; Zoe commented, &quot;even though you were the most against becoming a Slug Person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None of us wanted it and all of us were afraid by what happened to mom,&quot; Lucy argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t deny that,&quot; Zoe replied rolling her head, &quot;but we also all know that while Megan and Jenny were forceful and went beyond what is the norm for Slug People with regard to interactions with humans... particularly when comes to when humans end up becoming Slug People... but they weren&#39;t too far removed from how Slug People often act with each other. I mean... we&#39;ve all felt it after our transformations. Seeing me change was enough to get you, Grace, and mom to orgasm... seeing Jeff complete his transformation did the same. So, it&#39;s not as though the Slug People colony are going to suddenly become super reserved in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not against them having their own culture,&quot; Lucy countered, &quot;and in that among themselves... they&#39;re perfectly free to be themselves, so long as they don&#39;t FORCE anything on me. That&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so,&quot; Zoe said back, which Lucy couldn&#39;t reply to, &quot;but that&#39;s still what it sounds like. And unless we get some way to stop Cupple... or at least counter his magic... the whole sanctuary thing wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea. For the Slug People might only know the more subconscious abilities they have and wouldn&#39;t be versed in the kind of magic that Cupple&#39;s tried to use against us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d vote we at least leave things open to consideration for sanctuary,&quot; Jeff spoke raising a hand, &quot;if we get more information and a safer situation later, we can let Father Moughlin know that and if not... we&#39;d then still have a safe place to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Whitney, Grace, and Zoe raised their hands in agreement. Lucy sighed and then nodded and accepted the vote. As she accepted the vote, Father Moughlin returned and offered the note pad to Whitney.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you go,&quot; Father Moughlin spoke, &quot;this should provide you with my number. Should you ultimately accept the offer of sanctuary... give me a call.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll let you know on what happens regardless,&quot; Whitney promised him, &quot;but a lot of this may take up the rest of the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable,&quot; Father Moughlin nodded, &quot;but... patience IS a virtue.&quot;</p>
