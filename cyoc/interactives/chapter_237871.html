<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The boys were whisked away by the company, Genodyne Innovations, to a sterile, high-security facility where they’re held naked for days. In this strange, clinical environment, they endure a series of blood tests and hourly “milking” procedures that make them feel more like livestock than people. The milking machines reminded Gavin of those used on cow udders, but smaller to tightly slip over their constantly erect cocks. Gus had two additional milking pumps on his cock-nipples as well. Myles, who had to be transported to the facility in a truck, separately to the rest of them, had his own corner to occupy. Due to the size of his balls, he was immobile and company workers would give him routine sponge baths rather than have him join the other boys in the communal showers. Myles was milked every hour, while Gavin, the twins and Phil got milked every four hours. The others, Aaron, Gus, Oscar, Axel and Roy, were milked twice a day. The whole ordeal was humiliating and stripped them of any dignity, treating them as specimens rather than people. They weren’t able to contact their parents either, but were assured by their carers that they had been informed where they were.<br />
<br />
A day later, more familiar faces were brought into the facility. All of their classmates that had participated in the weekend party had been collected, stripped and escorted inside. The majority were furious about what was happening and blamed Gavin since it was his pills they took. Phil noticed there was one missing, Samuel. He had left Myles’s place a few hours before the company had picked them up. They were surprised he avoided being brought in at the same time as their classmates. Gavin assumed that it was just a matter of time.<br />
<br />
Finally, after a week in the facility, they were all released back to their parents, who were horrified at the irreversible changes the boys’ bodies had undergone. Gavin’s parents, normally supportive, were freaked; conversations for months were tense and filled with disappointment and worry. Being released back home was not the end of the nightmarish situation however. The families were immediately thrust into a legal battle, as Genodyne Innovations asserted ownership over the boys’ bodies due to the experimental drugs they had ingested. While the case dragged through the courts, the boys were kept out of the public and forced into homeschooling, as judges and lawyers debated the ethical and legal ramifications of the Genodyne’s claim. During the two years of home study, Gavin becomes withdrawn, finding it increasingly difficult to engage with everyday activities or enjoy his old hobbies. The boys’ physical changes made them the subject of public gossip, international news and invasive medical check-ups. <br />
<br />
It was humiliating that due to the sheer size and visibility of his exercise-ball-sized testicles, his parents were constantly seeing them. It was impossible to cover himself fully as no clothes were made for this. Every glance or moment of eye contact with his parents made him cringe. He could see the discomfort in their eyes, though they tried to hide it, and that only made things worse. Additionally, his need to masturbate several times a day and the volumes of cum he produced was something his parents had to get used to as just something their son had to do, like eating, sleeping or going to the toilet. His parents tried to be supportive. They’d politely avert their eyes if he started to grow a boner or try to act casual if they walked in on a wanking session, but he could feel the tension in every interaction. They also had to completely ignore the house constantly reeking like cum. It was as though their home had become a silent battleground of embarrassment and sympathy, where his parents were as much prisoners to his body’s alterations as he was. The loss of normalcy weighed on him constantly.<br />
<br />
He was able to keep connected with his friends through social media and would often call up each other through group video chats. They learnt that Samuel escaped their fate because his mum had him surgically castrated before the company had picked up all those affected. When she saw how large his testicles were when he got home, she assumed he had some sort of fast growing testicular cancer and took him to a doctor immediately. A surgeon cut off his massive balls, and Genodyne chose to collect Samuel&#39;s testicles instead of Samuel himself. In one way Sam was lucky to avoid living like a human experiment, but it was in exchange for his manhood, and a lifetime of taking testosterone supplements. <br />
<br />
Myles seemed to be the only one enjoying the new situation. His parents built him a shed in the backyard that could properly house his balls that were the size of a minivan and included all the facilities he needed with his limited mobility. He admitted to Gavin that his one regret was that they couldn’t spend any time together in person, being both stuck in what was basically home detention. Unlike those with testicles too large to fit in their pants, the other boys were free to go about their lives, so Aaron and Gus weren’t impeded to hang out together. However, they were strictly supervised by their parents to prevent any fornication between the couple. They did not want the boys’ bodies morphing even further from sexual activities between the two. In the group calls, Myles was the only one to refuse to put on clothes. The others, despite seeing each other’s naked bodies for days before, were keen to try to bring back some normality through modesty. However Gus would still leave his shirt unbuttoned since his cock-nipples were uncomfortable when erect and pressed up against the material of closed shirts.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a fierce legal battle ensued, with the courts debated the ethics of whether the boys should be considered property of the company, to be further experimented on at its will. After months of legal arguments and appeals, the courts arrived at a disturbing compromise: while the boys are granted limited freedom, Genodyne Innovations would retain control over their bodies. The court&#39;s decision is clear—Gavin and his classmates are allowed to return to school and live with their families, but they remain bound to the company’s experimental programs. The fine print of this ruling means that Gavin and his friends, at school, could be subjected to any ongoing body morphing research. Additionally, laws are written so that the boys, who were now forcibly nude at all times, were able to continue to be seen in public without issue. <br />
<br />
When Gavin first heard the court&#39;s decision, he felt a mix of disbelief and dread that sent a chill down his spine. The initial relief at being allowed to continue living at home and return to school was crushed by the stark reality of the ruling. He’d imagined, at worst, a few monitoring check-ins, maybe some strict health protocols, but nothing could prepare him for the realization that he would be treated as company property, subject to further &quot;modifications&quot; at their whim.<br />
The idea of permanent nudity in public horrified him. He could barely stand the thought of being so exposed in the privacy of his own home, and now he’d have to endure it daily, in front of parents, classmates, strangers, and teachers. Especially with the amount of times he gets unwanted erections. Gavin felt stripped of any normal life—his privacy, his dignity, even his sense of self were now reduced to terms and conditions in fine print. Each step of his day would remind him that he was no longer just a teenager but an experiment, forever visible, forever observed.</p>
