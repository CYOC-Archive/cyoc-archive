<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I&#39;ve looked over old chapters and it would seem that Sophie and Roland&#39;s parents have never gotten first names and have been referred to as the parent of Sophie or Roland or Mr./Mrs. Albers/Luwrie... if they&#39;ve gotten names and I&#39;ve missed it... please let me know.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The plan for Sophie&#39;s parents, Remington and Vera Albers, and Roland&#39;s parents, Tyler and Persephone Luwrie, had in a way been years in the making, now. The seeds were there with the start of Animalia as the eruption of a society of well anthropomorphic animals had some measure of curiosity, though at that time for both sets of parents the draw was more in support and tolerance for them. For the Albers it was because Abby Brown had gotten caught up in the initial outbreak and they knew that their daughter was friends with Abby and likely wouldn&#39;t abandon her friend. Thus, as good parents they would do what they could to support Sophie&#39;s efforts to help her friend and provide what support they could for Abby, even if they didn&#39;t necessarily interact with the Browns all that much outside of times when Sophie and Abby had had sleepovers in the past.<br />
<br />
But for the most part, the two sets of parents had kept things at that level as Animalia developed. There wasn&#39;t much of an urge for them to become Animalians, even though in Lyre/Animalia it became pretty obvious that people who became Animalians were enjoying many of the perks that came with it. In some ways it was hard for Animalians to hide their rather active sex lives, even if those acts remained in private. Often because signs of that activity would become obvious as Animalians began having children, and Thomas and Julia Wesley, the parents of Sophie&#39;s other friend, Sarah, having Belle and Bash after their dog was uplifted and leading the Wesley family all being Siberian Husky Animalians. For a while, the Albers and Luwries were content to be happy for those that got a new start at life and were having families, but the revealing of the potential for Animalians based on prehistoric species began to change things.<br />
<br />
While Heather&#39;s apologies were accepted in that she had been in a bad place when she first converted and had done so under conditions that left her overwhelmed by the predatory instincts that came with the various pieces of fossilized Theropod &quot;DNA&quot; when it happened, there was some measure of parental protectiveness that would never go away. Particularly for Tyler and Persephone, as it had been their son who had been wounded in Heather&#39;s attack on Lyre High. But Remington and Vera found themselves remaining proud of their daughter, who had seemed to lead the way on the efforts that were done to reform Heather after the attack, even if this included Sophie making the statement that she&#39;d been looking at wanting to be an Animalian and had been looking at becoming a Dinotopian after that became an option. This brought about additional contact with the first group of Dinotopians while they were living in Lyre/Animalia and that sparked all sorts of other things in the background. Among them was meeting Andrew during the first Thanksgiving after the Dinotopians were discovered.<br />
<br />
Vera knew there were some clearly sexually oriented ideas that came out of that meeting. For seeing Andrew&#39;s overall size was enough to lead to plenty of wild imaginings at how big he was where it counted and given the rather healthy sizes that all Animalians reached, that would have to be huge. However, Vera knew that neither she, nor her husband, were too old for sex and the idea of Remington having equipment that big was attractive. Finding out that Persephone didn&#39;t think too differently was a bit of a surprise when they&#39;d discussed certain elements of their children&#39;s relationship, which like many other Animalian couples, seemed to be headed for marriage and a &quot;happily ever after&quot; of its own, but Vera accepted that, and to a degree also agreed with Persephone&#39;s wish to be able to protect her son if push came to shove. Thankfully, their husbands seemed to accept going along with the idea.<br />
<br />
All of those things narrowed things down the Sauropods, and particularly some of the larger ones. For a time, both sets of parents wanted to keep things relatively quiet from Sophie, JC, Pauline, and Roland, though there was some agreement that they&#39;d likely pick up on parts of things, but given that they were adults, it was also expected that their children would accept the decisions made. Particularly when both the Albers and Luwries intended to retain their lives in Lyre/Animalia after converting, so they wouldn&#39;t be following their children to Dino City. The ones they did end up talking with proved to be some of the Sauropod Dinotopians they&#39;d already met and seen around Lyre/Animalia before Dino City was established. Andrew, Jen, Luke, and Marjorie were all happy to give their input, though they also made the point that most of the Sauropod Dinotopians that were in Dino City at present were largely from Sauropod groups closely related to the types of Sauropods they were... Brachiosaurs or Diplodocids, certain other types weren&#39;t there.<br />
<br />
That in turn got them to agree on Sauropod species that didn&#39;t necessarily have many representatives at present. Remington and Vera ultimately settled on Mamenchisaurus, and specifically Mamenchisaurus Hochuanensis, a roughly 70-foot Sauropod from China that was known for much of its length being in its extremely long and strong neck. It was also one that had had its taxonomic placement in the Sauropod family move around with them being grouped with various different lineages over time before being grouped within a grouping that would be considered part of an &quot;earlier&quot; lineage, regardless of when Mamenchisaurus Hochuanensis lived. Tyler and Persephone had settled with Alamosaurus, one of the last Sauropod Dinosaurs to ever live, and particularly among the last in North America. The massive Titanosaur was just under 100 feet long and was far more robustly built than most other Sauropods. The species split between them was ultimately agreed on for the Luwries to take the larger specimen in order to provide the security issues they wanted in regarding Roland&#39;s defense.<br />
<br />
Much of what came next was logistics in being able to set up being able to remain in Lyre/Animalia after converting. This meant that both ended up putting more into their savings and preparing for loans and other actions that would be needed for a new wardrobe, new vehicles, and new homes. Some of that took time, and the home construction took some negotiation with one of the construction companies working in Lyre/Animalia, and apparently included a male Maiasaura Dinotopian that was living in Lyre/Animalia. The homes would be ready to move into in mid to late February, and conveniently after the Year of the Dragon Celebration, and the new vehicle could then be traded in Dino City after the conversions. Once the basics were in order, both sets of parents took leave from their respective jobs for the duration of the Year of the Dragon celebration in Dino City and were soon on the road to Dallas, as mostly there were other things that would have to be handled before the actual celebration began... namely the conversation with Sophie and Roland...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The drive from Nevada to Texas took time, as it wasn&#39;t as though the two states were next to each other and had small land areas. Texas was the second largest state in the union by land area after Alaska and Nevada wasn&#39;t exactly a tiny state either. It made coordinating on hotels a bit difficult, but both the Albers and Luwries managed and used the coordination for base scouting on what would work on the return trip, as while Animalia&#39;s development had led to new construction of public buildings like hotels and things being bigger in some places, but it wasn&#39;t always easy. And from there, once in Texas, they would have to go to SMU&#39;s campus in order to chauffeur Sophie, Roland, Pauline, and JC to Dino City for the start of the celebrations, and there had been a call ahead to make sure that everything would be okay.<br />
<br />
The pair had gotten a bit better with dealing with Dallas&#39;s busy street traffic and they were able to make it to SMU&#39;s campus and came to the pre-set area where they would pick up their respective children, and technically &quot;adopted&quot; grandchildren when counting the fact that JC still saw Sophie as a mother figure to him. The conversation about what was to come would then take place on the drive to Dino City for the first night of the ceremony. There would be some prep work for Sophie, Roland, JC, and Pauline to work on, so they wouldn&#39;t have to follow their parents as they went through with their conversions, getting new clothes and trading their vehicles for appropriate trade ins, but both parents wanted to talk with their children before the conversions happened, if only to explain things, and some of these were rehearsed a bit so that the conversations would be about the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you drove all this way,&quot; Sophie said as she climbed into the back seat after waving goodbye to Roland for the drive to Dino City.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t think we&#39;d come to watch you in the competition?&quot; Vera asked, &quot;you mentioned a fair bit of it during the course of Christmas break.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have thought you would have flown and rented a car,&quot; Sophie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Airplane tickets are pricy, and right now it would appear that some of the planes are having issues with keeping their doors on the plane while in flight,&quot; Remington commented as he put the car in gear after Sophie buckled herself in, &quot;and besides... there are some other things going on at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Other things?&quot; JC said slowly while looking between Remington and Vera and then to Sophie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Vera nodded while looking into the back seat through the mirror and noting that while Sophie looked calm, her beak was down to allow her eyes to dart back and forth between her parents in the front seat, &quot;such as... what would say if your father and I were to convert? Become Dinotopians... different from you and Roland and from JC and Pauline.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what you want?&quot; Sophie asked, tilting her head to a side for a moment, &quot;and I mean REALLY what you want? I mean... you didn&#39;t convert when Animalia got started. You didn&#39;t become a Dinotopian when that option became available.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right there,&quot; Remington nodded, but kept his eyes on the road, &quot;we had more time to sit and think... and in a way, a lot of that initial drive that saw many willing too convert was not there. Neither your mother nor I are &quot;furries&quot; who are into that sort of thing, and we&#39;ve been healthy enough that the regenerative side of things in conversions hasn&#39;t been the most pressing thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... when you converted, or at least from when you said you wanted to convert, there were some things that changed,&quot; Vera picked up as they were soon maneuvering their way back toward the highway that would lead from Dallas to Glen Rose and Dino City, &quot;you showed a great deal of maturity, strength, and compassion... particularly in helping get Heather Greene&#39;s head on straight. And as such, your father and I are very proud of you... in a way, both you and Roland, who has been quite the gentleman since you introduced him to is...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie thought back on that meeting. She and Roland were still Human back then.<br />
<br />
&quot;And after you both converted, things have seemed to progress further and in a fairly steady way,&quot; Vera continued, &quot;I mean... both of you are legally old enough to marry now... though, we&#39;d hope you wait until you&#39;ve graduated college to get started on all those sorts of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we will wait for that... Roland will have some stuff coming up next year that will relate to student teaching, and he says they could well assign him to go just about anywhere, and thus the semester that he does that may only have that on his class schedule and then the other semester would be jampacked with other coursework,&quot; Sophie nodded, &quot;throwing wedding planning in would be even bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Vera spoke, &quot;but with all that... it&#39;s created some other thoughts for your father and I. To be there... in some way for you and Roland when you marry... have children, or I suppose hatchlings. I mean... there is a part of us that would like to be in good shape as our grandchildren grow up in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;d want to be young again?&quot; Sophie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there would be some other things, things best left private between your father and I,&quot; Vera answered with a weak smile, &quot;as I&#39;d assume you wouldn&#39;t want me asking about the squawking when Roland comes over for a sleep over during the summer or things like Christmas break.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie only managed to open and close her jaws a few times and her cheeks flushed hot under the pycnofibers on her head. It made a bit of a clicking sound for a few moments, as she was embarrassed a bit, mostly because she thought that she and Roland had managed to stay quiet on those nights. The two of them had managed not to be active after that one night after she and Roland first became Animalians. Covering the opening of Dinotopia Aquatica and then getting caught by a big rainstorm that came from nowhere and managed to cancel flights in the area had led to their taking the other&#39;s virginity, and it had been fun. However, Sophie did wish to remain in control of things, though after turning eighteen, she and Roland did make up for lost time when they could, as it felt good to be young and in love. Though, she didn&#39;t necessarily want to discuss her love life with her parents, and at the same time, that was also something where if they wanted to become Dinotopians for the sex, it wasn&#39;t her place to complain.<br />
<br />
&quot;There would also be the wish to provide at least the image of a protective shield,&quot; Remington commented, &quot;for you and Roland... in case something like what happened with Heather happens again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heather&#39;s gotten past that, dad, and she&#39;s apologized!&quot; Sophie found herself arguing.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know, and to a great degree, we&#39;d even accept the apology,&quot; Remington spoke calmly, &quot;and from what you&#39;ve reported, it would seem like whatever reforms that her grandmother knocked into her have worked. But the world can be a stressful place, and we can&#39;t always predict what would happen. After all, did Horizon actually expect their initial experiments would lead to Animalia?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Pauline commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s all the base concern that we have would be there,&quot; Remington answered, &quot;though, this may be truer for the Luwries than for us... but still. We convert and can then provide at least the image to show that you have loving parents who would drop everything and come to your aid if need be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And would you be moving to Dino City?&quot; Sophie asked carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Vera spoke, &quot;we don&#39;t want to crowd you and Roland. The Luwries and us have been working out the logistics for appropriately sized homes in Animalia... and arranging them so that our jobs will be able to handle the new us. As your father said... it&#39;s more for the reminder that you have people that will love and defend you if we have to... and that can come in multiple ways. To a degree... it may not be likely that Heather has a relapse... as we do have faith in your ability to work at these sorts of things... but we would like to provide something that would show that we would always be in your corner... and who knows... the thing that we may need to protect you and Roland from may not be another Animalian... it&#39;d be some idiot politician with dreams of dictatorial power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... so... what exactly where you looking to become, if I may ask?&quot; Sophie then wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That will be a bit of a surprise, rest assured, we&#39;ll be your biggest fans for the competition,&quot; Remington made a small smile.<br />
<br />
Sophie blinked at that, but then nodded and shrugged. To some degree, a part of her expected something like this. The one thing that remained was to wonder what kind of Dinotopian her parents would be, and there were lots of different species to pick from.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
They dropped Sophie, Roland, JC, and Pauline off at the Dino Dome, as they had some things that would need to be done to prepare for the opening ceremony for the Year of the Dragon contest that would take up the time that Remington, Vera, Tyler, and Persephone figured would be needed to go through their conversions and then handle the logistics of both trading in their cars at a local dealer that handled a lot of the trade ins for new Dinotopians, and particularly those becoming some of the larger Dinotopians. The first stop was Horizon, and unlike in Lyre/Animalia where the Horizon Offices and the sponsored hospital, Horizon Light, were in two different areas, in Dino City, they were all in one place. The arrival came with predictable paperwork and meeting with a familiar face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m actually a bit surprised you two didn&#39;t go with a species of Pterosaur,&quot; Jeremy said to Remington and Vera as he led them along as the Albers had the earlier appointment. Though, much like Horizon&#39;s main offices in Lyre/Animalia, the office in Dino City did have multiple conversion rooms and he would move to handle the Luwries&#39; conversion as soon as Remington and Vera&#39;s conversion was started.<br />
<br />
&quot;We would like to provide some measure of difference from our daughter,&quot; Vera answered, &quot;and from some of the information we&#39;d found... there have been some depictions of Pterosaurs riding on the backs of Sauropods at times... like some of the birds in Africa riding on Cape Buffalo. So, while Sophie&#39;s species didn&#39;t live with Mamenchisaurus and may not have lived in that exact lifestyle... we think it would be complementary in a way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes sense, I suppose,&quot; Jeremy gave a shrug, &quot;though... with regard to Mamenchisaurus, we did have to do a bit of engineering with the formula. Adding in some features from the Green Tree Python...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This would be for the neck, I assume?&quot; Remington asked, &quot;the information we found gave an indication that the portions of the neck vertebrae that were underneath the main spinal bones were long enough that it would have a relatively limited range of motion in order to avoid putting those long thin bones and tendons through the neck muscles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a way,&quot; Jeremy nodded as he opened the door to the conversion room, &quot;the number of bones in the necks of most Sauropods, including Mamenchisaurus wouldn&#39;t render your necks completely immobile... BUT they wouldn&#39;t have the serpentine necks that have often been depicted in early artworks. Likely because those drawing the pictures weren&#39;t entirely skilled on anatomy and how the bones would work inside the body. The addition of the Python DNA should improve the range of motion further, and because it is a tree dwelling species, it should also provide for the muscle control to stabilize the neck once the conversion is done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Remington and Vera made their way in and found the room rather spacious. It wasn&#39;t as big as the hotel room they had, though the bed was about as big. A lot of this was probably to be expected as these conversion rooms, as Horizon sold them, were intended for short term use and the bed was really only there for cases like Remington and Vera&#39;s. Jeremy was to give Vera the shot that would double dose her and then she would handle Remington&#39;s conversion and a good part of Vera was looking forward to that point, as neither of them were necessarily too old for sex. The two of them climbed up onto the bed and finding that while it was a little bit taller than their bed at home, there was a sense of both strength and softness that was there that was hard to describe. Vera pushed at the mattress, and while it did go in a little, there was no creaking or anything that indicated that she was pushing on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may want to strip,&quot; Jeremy advised as he readied the alcohol swab to deliver the shot, &quot;while Mamenchisaurus Hochuanensis isn&#39;t the largest member of the Mamenchisaurus family... it is still quite big. And even if you were becoming the smallest member of that family of Sauropods, Mamenchisaurus Constructus, it was also just under 50 feet long and weighing several tons... the resulting Dinotopian from that species would still be big... TOO big for what you&#39;re wearing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can understand that... Mamenchisaurus Hochuanensis had an estimated size at between 69 and 72 feet long and up to 20 short tons,&quot; Remington said slowly, &quot;that won&#39;t be small. But we are a married couple, and while Animalians in general may be more comfortable with things like nudity... we&#39;d like our assuming new forms to be between us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it isn&#39;t like the change is instantaneous, right?&quot; Vera asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t,&quot; Jeremy nodded. as the rolled-up Vera&#39;s sleeve and began to swab the skin there.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... I should have time to strip down as I start to change,&quot; Vera spoke, &quot;and you&#39;re on your way out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable,&quot; Jeremy nodded as he checked the specialized syringe that had been engineered for his hands and could carry the volume for a double dose in one shot. He then carefully delivered the shot to Vera&#39;s arm and pressed down on the plunger and then finished with, &quot;and welcome to Dinotopia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Remington watched as Vera flinched a little as the shot was given, but that didn&#39;t last long, and Jeremy did leave after administering the shot. He knew that Tyler and Persephone&#39;s conversion would soon follow. However, for the moment, it was his wife&#39;s changes that had the most attention for him, and many of them were already beginning to come into effect, even as the door opened and Jeremy left the room. As the door shut, Vera was quick to begin undressing, as while the transformation wasn&#39;t instantaneous, it wasn&#39;t slow, either. She was quick to kick off her shoes and pull down her socks. Remington could only watch as her fingernails seemed to enlarge a bit and widen into a dark and blunt hooflike structure, with the exception of her thumb. That digit was seemingly growing a claw from its tip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it hurt?&quot; Remington asked her as he heard a few small grunts escape Vera.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... just feeling a little... odd,&quot; Vera answered as she got her socks off and as flakes of emerald green scales began to appear in patches on Vera&#39;s skin. They weren&#39;t snake scales or anything quite like most other reptiles, but neither were they entirely like the bird-like skin that Jeremy had. There was also the fact that her toes were seeming to merge with dull claw-like or hoof-like nails growing out on what rapidly became three visible toes that seemed to angle toward the outside. &quot;It&#39;s like a lot of things tingle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Remington watched as Vera actually hopped off the bed for a moment, and he thought she actually looked a bit taller. She carefully set about undoing her pants and then sliding her panties down, giving him a clear view of her back and rear. The normal pink skin was increasingly being replaced by the emerald green scales, though he also noted some sporadic bright yellow spots in places on Vera&#39;s butt and running up to her shirt. It was here that Remington then remembered the species of snake that Jeremy said they used to help with the potential issues regarding the flexibility of Mamenchisaurus&#39; neck, the Green Tree Python, which was largely an emerald green color with sporadic yellow spots on its dorsal side. It appeared as though Vera was gaining the snake&#39;s coloration pattern as she changed as well, though that could be also hit and miss. For there weren&#39;t a lot of soft tissue samples out there for a lot of Dinosaurs, which made all details on their coloration and patterns fairly speculative.<br />
<br />
The one thing that Remington wanted to hide was that as he looked at his wife&#39;s butt, which was beginning to widen out a little bit and a small nub had begun to push out from the base of her spine, was that it was arousing in a way. Granted, he wasn&#39;t a young man and since until now, becoming an Animalian and gaining their higher libido hadn&#39;t been on the agenda, but it wasn&#39;t as though he and Vera had been completely celibate over the years. Of course, when Sophie was young, some of that was rather limited as there had never been the desire to try and explain to a little girl what sex was and that &quot;mommies and daddies did it because they loved each other.&quot; When Sophie got old enough for the talk, going into seventh and eighth grade on what to expect when puberty came, that had been left to Vera, and from there things didn&#39;t go further because of mutual embarrassment on the issue.<br />
<br />
It was only when Sophie got involved with Animalia Ambassadoria and travelled a bit more that Remington and Vera had private time for it, and on some nights they did. Remington liked to pride himself on being a gentleman.  Though, as Vera pulled up on her shirt and was soon wrestling with her bra, that only raised reminders on how much things were changing. Vera jogged on occasion, but was never a big fitness buff, and yet the definition of the muscles on her back was starting to look sharper and stronger... and larger. She didn&#39;t seem to be losing her femineity, but it was becoming clear that she was gaining muscle mass and more youthful vigor again. It was enough to turn Remington on and he could feel his penis starting to stir in his pants. He let his hands fall to his waist to try and hide the bulge in his pants, even though Vera&#39;s head was presently hidden in her shirt and with her hair falling to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey... are... are you... interested?&quot; came Vera&#39;s voice and that drew Remington&#39;s eyes up. Vera&#39;s voice was more youthful but also deeper and sultrier.<br />
<br />
Remington looked up to see that in a great surge of growth, Vera had not only gotten taller but that her neck had grown longer. She&#39;d gotten her arms out of her shirt, but for the moment it was now hanging from her head as it rose up and up. The alterations that had been done for the neck vertebrae had worked out quite well as Remington could see that Vera could turn her head and neck without too much trouble and without putting a neck bone through her skin. Though for the moment, the shirt was acting something like a blindfold and that all that Vera was going on was her sense of smell, and it had to be improved a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always been interested in YOU, dear,&quot; Remington admitted as he watched her finish pull her shirt off and note that her bra was in her shirt.<br />
<br />
What Vera then revealed was a rapidly competing Dinotopian. The overall coloration mirrored a Green Tree Python with an emerald green dorsal side, along with emerald green scaled nipples along with pale greenish-white belly. Her eyes remained the same as they&#39;d always been, though, now they sat a bit further back on her head as there was a bit of a crest that rose up between her eyes that then arched down and forward before moving into an almost U-shaped muzzle with rather Human-like teeth as Vera&#39;s lips pulled up into a smile. Some of this was a surprise, as Sauropods were generally known to have rather peg like teeth that was more suited to stripping pants of their foliage and any and all &quot;chewing&quot; was done by stones that swallowed. Though some of the papers that Rex had written on Dinotopian anatomy hypothesized that particularly with many plant eating Dinotopians that much of their tooth and digestive system actually took more from the Human side of the conversion rather than the Dinosaur side. It was something he couldn&#39;t confirm, but suspected mostly came from the fact that many of the sorts of trees and plants that were dominant in the Triassic and Jurassic Periods were now either gone completely or greatly declined.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great,&quot; Vera answered, as she swung her growing tail behind her, &quot;because... it&#39;s really starting to feel good for me... and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m done growing, yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not done growing...&quot; Remington began and then looked down from Vera&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
It was here that he noticed that Vera WAS still growing. Her neck was growing longer, and her tail was as well, though at a slower rate than her neck. In terms of height, Vera had passed Jeremy&#39;s and kept on growing.  Her muscles were also still growing that marked increases in definition while still remaining feminine. Her hips had grown wider to support a generous posterior and her lengthening tail, but they weren&#39;t where the most growth had occurred. That happened to be at Vera&#39;s chest. Vera had always been a bit on the smaller side when it came to her breasts, and they only grew to an &quot;average&quot; size when she&#39;d been pregnant with Sophie. In fact, when Sophie first became a Dinotopian at the end of her sophomore year in High School, Sophie had grown bigger breasts than Vera had at that time. And while Sophie had the smallest breasts of her friends as an adult Dinotopian, it would be noted that as a Pterosaur, Sophie also still needed to save on weight for flight, and still proportionately fit within the D cup range which seemed to be the cup size where Animalian females started. And it left the Human Vera in the dust.<br />
<br />
Now, as Vera changed, that difference was changing. When Vera had taken her shirt and bra off, she had already caught up with the adult Dinotopian size that Sophie had grown up to. But Vera was right in that she wasn&#39;t done there. Her presently pale whitish-green scaled breasts kept own growing and being round and firm. With each breath Vera took, Remington watched them swell larger and larger, and that served to keep his penis hard. It actually finally got him to undress himself, and which seemed to raise a smile on Vera&#39;s lips, as it raised no hints of what they would be doing, either to begin his transformation into a male Mamenchisaurus Dinotopian or shortly after his conversion began. For while Vera hadn&#39;t grown quite to the size that the Brachiosaurus Dinotopian Jen had actually &quot;shrunk&quot; to, Vera was now much bigger than she had ever been. Jen and the Diplodocus Dinotopian Marjorie weren&#39;t that much bigger than what Vera as a Mamenchisaurus Dinotopian had grown to.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; Remington spoke, &quot;and part of me is really eager for the pleasure that will make me your Dinotopian mate.... and maybe the father of your eggs in future. The other part of me is embarrassed by the fact that you really are turning me on right now. Like all that is there... is lust...&quot;<br />
<br />
Vera sat down beside him on the bed and wrapped her tail around behind Remington, noting how she could now truly feel the bed&#39;s mattress compress under her now much larger size. Feeling the scales of Vera&#39;s tail against him, and feeling a large hand softly touch his shoulder, and then finding himself having to look up just to look at the bottom of Vera&#39;s gigantic bosom, made Remington feel a bit small at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no need to be embarrassed,&quot; Vera told him, “This is what we wanted... and it was a decision made with love in mind and by mutual agreement.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Remington found himself scooped up into Vera&#39;s arms, and he found himself marveling at how muscular they felt, and was lifted up to her right breast, and he could see some milk leaking from the ready nipple. As he was lifted to it, he opened his mouth and carefully wrapped his lips over that nipple. And he found that despite his presently small size, his lips were strong enough to draw milk from Vera&#39;s breast. And as emerald green scales began to appear in patches on his own arms, he hoped that Tyler and Persephone&#39;s conversion was almost as good as his and Vera&#39;s.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The Luwries were actually enjoying things and were a bit further along than the Albers. There was some expectation that the conversion would be arousing in and of itself. Just about everyone they&#39;d talked to that had already become Animalians had mentioned that the feeling was there, even if they didn&#39;t engage in it at the time of their conversion. There was also some mention on things that also related to the specific type of Dinotopian they were becoming. This related into the knowledge on what seemed to happen with Sauropod Dinotopians in general. Dino City had at least four male Sauropod Dinotopians, Andrew as a Brachiosaurus, Luke as a Diplodocus, Tyler Pug as an Amargasaurus, and Quintus as an Apatosaurus. And while Persephone didn&#39;t ask about everything, from the conversations she did have with those that they and the Albers had been able to contact, &quot;large&quot; was something that &quot;didn&#39;t even begin to describe&quot; the equipment these Dinotopians.<br />
<br />
That then formed an image that sat in the back of Persephone&#39;s mind that because Alamosaurus would be easily bigger than all of the existing Dinotopians, her Tyler Luwrie would be even larger when he changed. To some degree, that had her thinking on it even before Jeremy came to collect them for their conversion and for the shot that would start Persephone&#39;s transformation. And almost as soon as the door shut, she made her move on Tyler, providing a series of kisses and working to get him out of his clothes. It resulted in some things getting ripped in the process, but Persephone was well aware that both of them would be too big for the clothing they&#39;d started the day in and one set of clothes that wouldn&#39;t be able to be given or donated to a charity wouldn&#39;t hurt that much. The forwardness on Persephone&#39;s part also served to get Tyler interested, and Persephone&#39;s Human hair began to fall out and there were some cracking sounds as she began to grow new neck vertebra, he began to push his erect penis into her already moist vagina and finding that she&#39;d REALLY been looking forward to this.<br />
<br />
From there, while Persephone hadn&#39;t transformed, the active Animalia Virus in her system was enough to start Tyler&#39;s transformation, and technically gave him two doses between the kisses and Persephone&#39;s vagina wrapping around his penis as he thrust into her. That was enough to provide for both of their transformations and things began to accelerate from there. And at first, Persephone could only barely feel it, as she had already started changing and could feel herself growing larger, with her head and neck sliding up the bed and her thrusts to counter Tyler&#39;s at first were enough lift him easily and giving her growing tail room to grow beneath her. But it wasn&#39;t long before Tyler&#39;s changes became more obvious and even began to catch up with her. And as her shirt and bra began to grow tight on her as she grew, she could feel Tyler growing as well.  And the most tactile part of it was in his dick. It was growing in girth with each thrust into her and Persephone was sure it was also going deeper into her with each thrust, and that felt good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.... god... keep... ohhhhhhhhhh... groooooooooowing,&quot; Persephone moaned out as Tyler thrust into her.<br />
<br />
And she could also see his changes rapidly beginning to catch up with hers as well. There were some cracking sounds as Tyler grew new neck vertebrae, but while his growing neck was growing longer, it was not a thin neck. Titanosaur Sauropods, and particularly the larger species, of which Alamosaurus was one, could have thick spines on the back of the vertebrae. They weren&#39;t long enough to erupt through as spikes as seen with Amargasaurus, but they were enough to make paleontologists think that many of these large Titanosaurs would have relatively thick and even muscular necks. These bones were also found to be wide enough that they could support a wide and thick neck, and while some of the same long thin bones on the underside of the neck were also present, they weren&#39;t as long as those in Mamenchisaurus, and made the modification with snake DNA not necessary for Tyler and Persephone.<br />
<br />
She could also see the developments in Tyler&#39;s changes as he continued to catch up with her as he changed. His muscles were growing, and in fact massively growing, and each pleasure filled thrust into her was gaining greater vigor and pleasure as they continued, but what Persephone found herself most drawn to was some the changes happening with Tyler&#39;s face. His pleasure filled moans indicated he was in no pain, but she could still hear some soft cracks as his lips began to push forward into a low and U-shaped muzzle, as it did so, his nostrils shrank down to two slits above his muzzle while his eyes pulled back toward the upper back of his skull while his ears shrank away to become nothing more than a membrane covered opening toward the back of the head, which fit with how the heads of non-mammals worked.<br />
<br />
Some may have considered that a bit odd, and when Persephone started working with Tyler on the research into Alamosaurus had brought in some corrections on their anatomy on various misconceptions. Many early depictions of Sauropods often placed the nasal passages high on the skull and between the eyes, often because that was where the nasal openings on the skull was. However, much of this was also something that came about because many very early scientists figured that animals as large as Sauropods needed to be submerged in water to support their massive weight. And when looking at Sauropods that were more vertical than horizontal, which fit the Brachiosaurs and the Titanosaurs that came after them, that seemed to fit, but that was also a misconception. Often as many Sauropods were not found in areas found to be marshes, lakes, and deep rivers in the Mesozoic. Not to mention that because so many Sauropods had hollow bones, they weren&#39;t necessarily as heavy as one may think and that they would be too buoyant to really be adaptable to water. Titanosaurs like Alamosaurus were a bit more solid, and thus heavier, but all discoveries had pointed to all Sauropods being quite effective land creatures that could support their own weight and didn&#39;t need to be in water to stand.<br />
<br />
But the placement of Tyler&#39;s nose wasn&#39;t the thing. It was the color. Persephone had found that much of her coloring was in various shades of a light and faded grayish blue, something that reminded her of the color of French World War One uniforms in 1916... a &quot;horizon blue&quot; color. Tyler was actually a bit brighter, as a fleshy part of his skull was actually a brilliant orange color that contrasted with the brighter blue scales that were coming in. That drew all the more attention to him from Persephone and she raised her head up to nuzzle his, and getting a closer loot at the raised scales forming the spines like those on an Iguana on the back of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re... look...ing am...az...ing,&quot; Persephone moaned as she marveled at the brighter blues that came in on Tyler. It was only on his neck and upper chest where Tyler&#39;s colors matched her grayish-blue color. Though, now there was also a bit of pain and Persephone could also feel why.<br />
<br />
Her shirt and bra were tightening around her own growing body, and the straps and wires on her bra were digging into her. She&#39;d always been a bit on the &quot;average&quot; side of things, but knowing how big the female Sauropod Dinotopians were, including one new female Brontosaurus Dinotopian in Mesozoic Enclave, she knew she wasn&#39;t going to be &quot;average&quot; anymore. All Animalian females had proportionately big breasts, but it seemed that female Sauropod Dinotopians took this to extremes and as Persephone felt her breasts grow and grow toward that truly massive size, the shirt and bra for an average Human woman was too small and that created a mix of pain and pleasure as she grew and clothing tightened trying to contain her. Tyler seemed to be going through the same as his muscles stretched the fabric of his own shirt. And the pair of them kept thrusting as Persephone could feel their mutual pleasure building and they weren&#39;t too far away from a tremendous orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ke...ep go...ing,&quot; Persephone moaned out as one of the front buttons on Tyler&#39;s shirt popped.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... me..an... GRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW...ING,&quot; Tyler moaned heavily as his shirt burst away sending a hail of popped buttons and as the seems tore apart under his muscular frame as his growth continued and kept going.<br />
<br />
Persephone wasn&#39;t too far behind as her cotton shirt was soon strained heavily, though the thing that was the most alerting was a loud snap that was soon heard. That gave Persephone some relief, as it wasn&#39;t her shirt that broke, but her bra. The clasps and straps could no longer handle or contain her growing glories and they actually bounced a bit as Tyler continued to thrust into her. It was also bringing a surge of milk as her growing breasts were no longer as held by the straps and constraints of her bra, and as she continued to grow, her shirt wouldn&#39;t last much longer. She did notice a bit of confusion on Tyler&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a REAL... bra bus..ter now,&quot; Persephone moaned out as she kept growing and watching her husband grow as well. One hand reached around her husband&#39;s back and her hoofed fingers soon felt some of the osteoderms, which she could not see but they were a bright silver color.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just... keep... GROWing,&quot; Tyler moaned back as the cotton on the front of Persephone&#39;s shirt ripped and popped open as the two of them kept growing as they continued to mate, and it wasn&#39;t long before Persephone&#39;s clothes finally lost the battle as the two mating Dinotopians grew into their full sizes and Tyler then thrust hard as he felt Persephone&#39;s vagina clinch hard on his now massive cock. From there, the erect member went from twitching in anticipation of an orgasm into erupting in a massive orgasm that shook both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhh... YEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!&quot; both Luwries found themselves moaning as they climaxed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... the guys we talked to were right,&quot; Persephone managed as they came down from the climax, &quot;Dinotopian sex is the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would say that YOU are the best,&quot; Tyler said to her and then looked Persephone over, &quot;though... that could be my biased opinion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Biased?&quot; Persephone raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I love you,&quot; Tyler answered, &quot;I&#39;m sure Mr. Albers will find his wife to be the best for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly,&quot; Persephone answered, &quot;though... you&#39;re better... and you&#39;re bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alamosaurus is bigger than Mamenchisaurus,&quot; Tyler answered, &quot;in fact from what we&#39;ve found... most of the fossils of the species found were actually from what are thought to have been immature. At full size... we&#39;re actually going to be BIGGER than any of the other Sauropod Dinotopians at the moment... The Albers are going to be closer to Jen and Andrew in size, as Mamenchisaurus and Brachiosaurus are of comparable lengths. Meaning, Vera will be closer to Jen in size... while you look like you might be a bit bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Persephone moaned again as Tyler softly caressed her left breast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alamosaurus is bigger than Brachiosaurus,&quot; Persephone smiled and noted Tyler&#39;s massive penis beginning to telescope out of the slit between his legs, &quot;though, as much as I&#39;d love to go another round... we do have some more work for the day. Get cleaned up... get clothes that will fit the new us, trade in our car... watch the opening ceremony live and then provide Roland with the surprise on what Dinotopian we became.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler than slowly nodded. As with the Albers, they had let Roland know they would be converting and that was in part why they&#39;d driven down to take advantage of a car dealership in Glen Rose that did a lot of business with Dino City and got deliveries from various car manufacturers that had begun to build cars and trucks that would fit Dinotopians. Vehicles that they and the Albers would now need. They had taken enough logistical steps to be ready for this and handle the appropriate mailing instructions for bills and handling things that would now be too small for them and related to the vehicle trade. And the whole trip was all part of the start of the Year of the Dragon and to also root for their son, and as Persephone flexed her own arms and noted the impressive shoulders and biceps that her husband gained, there was also the confidence that no one would ever pose a threat to her son and his mate, be it some run amok politician believing lies or anything else.</p>
