<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt quickly gathered his composure, reaching for his newly designed communication device that had earlier morphed from his mobile phone into a handheld digital panel matching his robotic form. Navigating through the menu with ease, he dialed up his friend Paul&#39;s number.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paul, it&#39;s Matt,&quot; he started, his voice reverberating in a low, almost robotic tone, &quot;You need to see something.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a moment of silent contemplation from the other end before Paul responded with a laugh, &quot;Did you finally manage to solve that Rubik&#39;s cube or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, nothing like that. Just come down,&quot; Matt pressured, a faint smile crossing his newly transformed face.<br />
<br />
The wait was excruciating. He unsteadily paced around the room, the heavy thuds of his metallic feet reverberating around him. As thrilling as his transformation was, the new reality of his situation was quickly sinking in. He suddenly wondered how Paul would react.<br />
<br />
When the knock on the door startled him, he opened it, revealing a stunned Paul standing in the corridor. His friend was gaping at Matt, eyes wide and mouth opening and closing like a fish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; Paul managed to stammer out, &quot;What the hell happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chronivac,&quot; Matt let out proudly. His mechanized voice echoed in the narrow hallway. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bullshit!&quot; Paul blurted, disbelief in his voice. &quot;The transformation device from the internet stories? That stuff is a myth!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Believe me, the legends are real,&quot; Matt confirmed, walking over to his workstation, gesturing for Paul to follow. <br />
<br />
When Paul still didn&#39;t move, paralyzed with shock, Matt shrugged before he pressed a button on the digital panel integrated in his body, a soft light blinking to indicate a software startup.<br />
<br />
The entire room was lit up in an electrifying array of light. Paul&#39;s shocked expression was suddenly replaced with awe. As the lights dimmed, Paul noticed with wide eyes that Matt had reverted back to his human form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you believe me?&quot; Matt asked, trying to keep his voice casual, though internally trembling with adrenaline.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude...&quot; Paul managed, folding onto an available chair, &quot;This... I can&#39;t believe... It&#39;s unreal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can try it on you,&quot; Matt suggested, letting Paul consider, &quot;If you want to. It&#39;s entirely reversible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul took a deep breath, swallowing hard as if preparing for a leap off a cliff. After an agonizingly long minute he nodded, &quot;Alright. I want to try this.&quot;<br />
Matt entered the parameters into the Chronivac and pressed the &#39;transform&#39; button. An energy field bubbled up around Paul, lighting him in a neon blue aura. Within seconds, the transformation began.<br />
<br />
Paul&#39;s face was the first to change. His features blurred and shifted, disappearing as the skin hardened and stretched over his skull. His head transformed into the shape of a motorcycle helmet, covering his eyes with a dark, impenetrable visor. His ears flatten and disappear into the leather surface, his nose morphing into neat air channels on either side of the helmet. The process gave him a peculiar sensation, as if thick syrup was being poured over his head, hardening almost instantly. He reached up to touch the smooth expanse, where his facial features once were, only to find only cold, hard surface of his helmet.<br />
<br />
Despite the drastic external transformation, he could still see and hear everything. There was a sense of disconnect, but no discomfort. Quite the opposite, to his surprise. He was feeling a pleasure he had never felt before.<br />
<br />
His excitement peaked as the transformation rolled down his neck, causing him to shiver. The sensation of his neck thickening, lengthening out into a molded collar was incredible, like someone was gently kneading his flesh, reshaping it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; he gasped, a thrill winding through him in a delightful gust.<br />
<br />
Matt watched as Paul&#39;s body began to morph, the arousal visible on the transformed young man&#39;s face. Paul&#39;s chest bulged out slightly before rapidly compacting, taking on the appearance of protective chest armor of a motorcycle suit. The once soft flesh of his chest turned solid and ridged with the bulk of protective paddings forming underneath. His nipples disappeared, the skin stretching and smoothing over them until there was no trace left. <br />
<br />
Gulping, Paul reached down to touch his chest, the sensation amplified by his arousal. His hand rubbed against the matching leather, groaning when his fingers brush over a now sensitive region where his nipples used to be.<br />
<br />
He looked on with amazement as his arms were quickly enveloped in a wave of transformation. He could see the skin tone changing, darkening into the rich black of sturdy leather. His fingers distorted and reshaped into thick leather gloves, each finger growing a hardened tip. He flexed his fingers experimentally, his excitement notched up to eleven as he discovered they responded perfectly, giving him a similar degree of motor control as his original fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep going,&quot; he growled, his voice a whining rasp, the excitement causing him to prematurely ejaculate but his erection remained.<br />
<br />
Without missing a beat, the changes flowed down his abdomen and expanded over his loins. His penis convulsed, retracted and quickly was smoothed over a visible bulge formed in his new leather groin. His ass hardened, twitching into something resembling a motorcycle cushion, fitted perfectly for someone to rest on. He reached down impulsively, groaning at the feel of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, that feels...,&quot; he started, but was cut off as the feeling rolled down his legs.<br />
<br />
His legs twitched and contracted as they took on the shape of leggings and reinforced knee pads formed under the thickening leather covering. The changes made their way down to his feet, reshaping them into heavy-duty motorcycle boots with sturdy soles. He gasped, looking down at his new form with a pleasant shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...wow,&quot; he breathed, his body still tingling with lingering pleasure from the transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; Matt asked, an amused smirk playing on his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I can&#39;t believe, this is amazing!&quot; Paul finally settled on, after admiring his new form. &quot;I never could have imagined it would be so... intense.&quot; He breathed, still catching his breath. And despite all the abrupt changes, all he wanted was more. It was unbelievable. And yet... he loved it.<br />
<br />
As Matt&#39;s hand reached out to touch him, Paul flinched slightly, bracing himself for unfamiliar contact. He let out a throaty moan as Matt touched his leather-clad groin, the sensation still exhilarating despite the lack of a physical member.<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s fingers traced over the ridges of the leather texture, his friend writhing and chuckling with delight under the unexpected touch. The sensation was different, unlike any other he had experienced before and in an exciting way, much more pleasurable than he could ever imagine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God...&quot; Paul gasped, each word punctuated by another heavy shudder of pleasure.<br />
<br />
He tried to reach down, yearning to experience the sensation himself but his leather-clad hands were too bulky to offer the intimate touch he desired. That’s when it hit him, the sheer helplessness of his form, a motorcycle suit without his control over his conduit of pleasure. The realization sent another wave of nervous anticipation through his system. <br />
<br />
His face visor lit up with a soft, crimson glow as his built-in suit features activated, matching his rising body temperature. The sensation was overwhelming, each touch sending him into spiraling waves of pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;More,&quot; he gasped, his voice unsteady in the throes of pleasure. &quot;Oh, Matt... more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt watched Paul squirming and writhing, a bemused smirk playing on his face. &quot;Alright, time to turn you back. This is getting too intense,&quot; he said, moving back towards the Chronivac. <br />
<br />
Toggling a switch, a retract mechanism activated, and a bright blue orb initiated from the device, focusing on Paul. A transparent bluish energy field enveloped Paul, and he could feel the sensations beginning to ebb.<br />
<br />
His groin was the first to feel the changes.The thick black leather faded into soft skin, the sensation of touch becoming more intimate and familiar. His shaft reformed, growing back into its original size and state, making Paul let out a soft sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
Next, his legs began to change. The hardened leggings softened, turning back into muscle and flesh. His kneepads transformed back into regular knees, the transformation seamless and oddly satisfying.<br />
<br />
His arms, too, slowly began their reversion process. Gloved hands reshaped and reformed into regular human hands, the heavy mate black leather gradual shedding, replaced by his original skin colour. His fingers wriggled and stretched as the feeling returned to them, no longer trapped inside the tight leather gloves.<br />
<br />
His chest and abdomen staggered and shifted back to their original shape, the armor and jacket attributes disappearing. His nipples emerged from their flattened state, his chest muscular and as lean as before. The strange sensitivity was gone too, much to his relief.<br />
<br />
Finally, his face began to change. The helmet that had replaced his head loosening and melting away. His hair regrew, short and spiky as it had always been. His mouth reappeared, lips parting to groan in pleasure and his eyes reformed, blue and twinkling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; Paul mumbled, his voice back to a familiar tone, the deep echo of the helmet long gone. &quot;That was... quite something.&quot;<br />
<br />
His body was back to human form, his clothes once more fabric and cotton rather than leather. Matt switched off the Chronivac, gave his friend a knowing grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was one intense ride, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; Matt asked, catching his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can say that again,&quot; Paul agreed, his voice weak but his grin shining brighter than ever. &quot;I&#39;m glad I tried it though.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two friends laughed, the mood easing in the room just as easily as had the excitement minutes ago. It was back to just another day, with one slight memory of an experience they could hardly forget.</p>
