<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah was spending her lunch at her desk looking over paperwork because someone dropped the ball again, just hours before some important client meetings. She was one of the youngest lawyers at the law firm, at 25 years old, after a short time as a law intern. She thinks it was because of her skills as a corporate lawyer, techie, and investment banker, but she sadly suspected it wasn&#39;t that. She was a &quot;drop-dead gorgeous woman,&quot; that&#39;s what she overheard one of the partners say while they thought she was out of earshot. A natural D cup and bound and was slightly on the tall side (about 6&#39;2), she was almost everyone&#39;s type, apparently at the firm almost. The people who didn&#39;t find her attractive at first were her jealous co-workers, who would pile on the paperwork or &quot;forget&quot; to inform her of some significant work that needed to be done days or even weeks ago. Like the graph sheets someone &quot;forgot&quot; to compile to talk some big Chinese corp into investing in one of the US&#39;s many failing industries.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, why isn&#39;t the secretaries handling this shit!!!&quot; she screamed to herself as she opened up the mixed fruit salad she got from the local deli. she scouped down the fruit, some of which looked as if it tasted completely alien. <br />
&quot;what was in this fruit salad?&quot; But unfortunately, she didn&#39;t have much time to process that thought as she worked at getting her Microsoft office to dance for her one-handed. <br />
<br />
It was about 5 minutes after finishing the salad and finally getting enough data plugged into the computer to start compelling on its own when she began to note how much colder the room had gotten. She shivered as she pulled out a blanket from one of her desks draws and wrapped it around herself as she watched the data sheets compare. <br />
<br />
&quot;God, this isn&#39;t the time to get a cold, not before a meeting.&quot; she thought to herself as she slowly felt an itch growing over her arms. She unconsciously scratched at them, too preoccupied with the screen to take note of her nail becoming hard black claws or her skin drying out and flaking off to reveal thick scales yet to gain their color. She kicked off her work shoes and pulled them up to her body, trying to keep up the body heat that was rapidly draining from her. Sarah&#39;s clothing was getting even more uncomfortable by the minute, as they felt like they were shrinking on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;o god, what&#39;s happening to me? Is this a panic attack? Maybe I should have been in for that tropical Vaka like Jill suggested...&quot; <br />
<br />
Rip was what she heard as she looked down to see that four of her toenails had ripped through her stockings. They were thick, dark, and had curved claws. Sarah reached her feet with her hands when she spotted her long claw-like nails. The skin on her hands was flacking away to scales, scales turning green in the exposed air. She rubbed the palms of his hand, the skin taring away like a snake&#39;s skin or dead skin after a bad sunburn.<br />
<br />
&quot;O God, I should have gone on that vacation,&quot; she screamed as the seat of her back ripped apart, throwing off her balance as she fell off her chair, hitting the floor hard.<br />
<br />
While in a daze, she felt her tail break through her panties, as long as half of her body, a thick heavy green limb that began to move amount in a mix of newfound life and its owner&#39;s confusion as it knew over plants and smashed bookcases apart. She tore at her shirt as her chest barred outward with muscles, trying to free her chest enough to get a good breath in. she felt what little fat was on her body melt away, revealing an 8-pack of rock-hard abs. Her nipples faded shorting, followed by her breast deflating as her mammary glands dissolved into her body as her ruined bra slid down her body. She continued to scream and grunt as she tried her best to get out of the remains of her suit. She clawed and pulled on her legging and sleeves, took equal amounts of skin, and did clothing.<br />
<br />
The pops and cracks died enough for her to climb onto her feet to see that Sarah covered most of her body in green scales. For the most part, she looked to be a muscular woman in green spandex with a very realistic-looking lizard tail. &quot;ok...this is fine...this is all in her head.&quot; she thought as the computer climbed to notice her that the sheets were complete. <br />
<br />
&quot;well, at least that one less thing to worry about,&quot; she said as she pressed the print key, pressing the keyboard, breaking it. <br />
<br />
She looked annoyed as she took deep breaths, &quot;well, at least the changes seem to have stopped-ahhhh,&quot; she spooked too soon as she dug her claws into the desk.<br />
<br />
Her back bucked up with muscles as her spine grew, sending her up by a good two to three feet. Her heels moved up her legs, forcing her onto her tiptoes, toes that swollen up to become her foot paws on a pair of digitigrade legs. Her hips and shoulders broaden farther, ruining her hourglass figure as her arm and leg muscles inflated like helium balloons hooked up to the tank. As her muscles spasmed and locked up her head just inches away from the ceiling tiles, the pain was unbearable, and then an odd bit of bliss as she felt something happening to her groin. <br />
<br />
Her private hair fell out and onto the floor and desk like her dead skin as her anus sealed away and regrown below her vigina; her lips expanded to incorporate her anus and urinary tract into her new reptilian cloaca. She did a quick gender check as she shoved her fingers; sharp claws are damned; after the 3rd hole she fished in and a hissing sexual moan, she could confirm that she was still a woman...just the green monsterous type of woman, god sound like one of their comic books the IT staff keep reading in the break room. <br />
<br />
She breathed heavily as he felt the changes reach her head, the last of her hair on her body, the long golden locks falling to the floor as her neck shrank down and became thicker. The first change she felt was the ears shrank away into small holes in the sides of her head, followed by her nose becoming two small holes above her mouth. The following change was an unpleasant one: her teeth fell out of her mouth and onto the floor. It wasn&#39;t one at a time; she struggled not to choke on her teeth as nearly all of them came loose simultaneously. If that wasn&#39;t unpleasant enough, her mouth soon flooded with crimson red blood as her new sharp teeth grew in. She opened her mouth to try to take some breaths, blood draining out of her mouth and a thin forked tongue shot out of her mouth, sampling the air become shoot back. Finally, the bones in her face cracked and popped as he pulled out into giant scary lizard maws. As her head panned back to let out a beastly bellow, she hit her head agast, dropping her down to her knees.<br />
<br />
She pulled out her make-up mirror to see a pair of slanted red lizard eyes staring back at her. Sarah was an 8-foot, something like a lizard monster, covered in blood, sweat, and bits of discarded hair and skin. <br />
<br />
&quot;fantastic, and the meeting is in half an hour. What the hell happened? People don&#39;t change species out of nowhere!&quot; she pondered as the door to her office opened. <br />
<br />
It was one of the firm partners throwing a file onto her desk, not even looking up from his phone. &quot;some fruit company had several Lilith Fruits end up in their production line; now people are turning into freaking furries. I was hoping you could develop an excellent class-action lawsuit letter to send to a few hundred or so people. I was hoping you could send it to PR in o I don&#39;t know, a few hours from now. Thanks, hun.&quot; he said as he closed the door after himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilith fruit like the supernatural fruit that grants people superpowers?&quot; Sarah thought to herself as she thought, what gift did the fruit give her?</p>
