<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been two hours since Lucille had given her son the medicine, <br />
dissolved in a glass of orange-juice. &quot;What will it do to him?&quot; she <br />
thought, half concerned, but also thrilled of the idea what it COULD <br />
do to him! Everything seemed possible. He was a young, healthy <br />
boy without any erective disfunctions. To the contrary! He was also <br />
still a bit skinny, not precisely the target group of the medication, <br />
but that was reason enough to administer only half a portion to him. <br />
&quot;Who knows whether it has any effect at all?&quot; Lucille was wondering. <br />
<br />
Occupied with those thoughts she had been preparing lunch, only <br />
interrupted from time to time by her opening the Aspirin-package <br />
now and again to check on the remaining sachets and follow the <br />
trail of thoughts. She hadn&#39;t heard of her son since she had brought <br />
him his juice. &quot;Oh well, maybe it wasn&#39;t working at all?&quot; She thought, <br />
preparing the meal. When she had put the plate down on the table, <br />
and put rice, vegetables and chicken on it, she took the open sachet <br />
out of her pocket and without much of a thought, sprincled the remaining <br />
portion on top of her son&#39;s lunch and then put some gravy on top <br />
of it. &quot;If that doesn&#39;t do the trick!&quot; <br />
<br />
When she called on Raul to come down for lunch she began doubting <br />
her decision, but it was too late now. Raul came stompig down the <br />
stairs, only dressed with his boxers and a t-shirt, even though it was <br />
early springtime and not that warm around the house. His head <br />
was fiery red and one could tell that there was something about him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What happend to you?&quot; Lucille asked gravely concerned. &quot;I don&#39;t <br />
know, I felt kind of hot all of the sudden!&quot; Raul replied. &quot;You haven&#39;t <br />
caught a flu haven&#39;t you? Don&#39;t run around in shorts, its not yet that <br />
warm for it&quot; Lucille said. &quot;I can&#39;t help it, Im just so hot. I don&#39;t feel <br />
sick mom! Im all right, just really, really warm!&quot; He sat down and <br />
started to eat or more: he was wolfing it down! He seemed to be <br />
incredibly hungry and after he had finished the plate he was asking <br />
for another serving and yet another. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really all right?&quot; Lucille was asking again. &quot;You never eat <br />
that much!&quot; She remembered how she always had to talk him into <br />
eating and how she had always been concerned that he wasn&#39;t eating <br />
properly, but this was a different child now. &quot;I am fine!&quot; he said, <br />
got up said a quick &quot;Thanks for the meal!&quot; and was heading back to his <br />
room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe the second half of the medicine was too much for him?&quot; <br />
Lucille wished she had not given him the second half as well, after <br />
seeing him like that. &quot;This must be the effect of the medication! <br />
If thats what half of it does to him, what does the full portion do?&quot; <br />
Lucille cleaned the table, turned the dishwasher on and spend <br />
a good hour sitting on the kitchen table, deep in thoughts about <br />
the whole issue and contemplating as to her decision of trying <br />
out an unknown medicine on her own son. &quot;If anything was to <br />
happen to him? I could never forgive myself!&quot; <br />
<br />
She jotted down the shopping list for the following week, but <br />
couldn&#39;t concentrate. She went to the living room, turned on <br />
the TV but did not pay attention to the channel or program. <br />
Finally she went to her room, turned on the computer, and <br />
checked the camera that had been installed in her boy&#39;s room. <br />
<br />
She was half expecting him sitting at the computer, pumping <br />
away. Maybe with a fully erect penis, eventually larger than <br />
it had been before even? But Raul was on his bed, fast asleep. <br />
Was Lucille disappointed? Was she relieved? She couldn&#39;t <br />
really tell. Maybe he was sick after all? <br />
<br />
But he couldn&#39;t be sick. He was fine that very morning and <br />
he had told her how good he felt at lunchtime. Lucille went downstairs <br />
again, going on her housework. Raul was sleeping the whole afternoon. <br />
When his friends came to ask whether he would join them for <br />
a game of football Lucille had to send them away. &quot;No, Im sorry! <br />
Raul is sleeping. Im afraid he might have caught the flu!&quot; They <br />
left disappointed. Raul was skinny, but a fast runner. Just what <br />
the boys had needed to take on the kids from from down the road. <br />
<br />
What was wrong with that boy? Was it the medication? Had it been <br />
too much? Maybe she shouldn&#39;t have added the second half of the <br />
portion? ... Lucille was tormenting herself throughout the day, <br />
rethinking her decision to order that medicine and giving it to <br />
her little boy. She was also ashamed that she had peeked on him <br />
via the camera every night, ever since she had become aware of <br />
him masturbating and she was ashamed of herself for touching <br />
herself while doing it. What a terrible mother she was: getting all <br />
wet and horny by watching her child, her own flesh and blood, <br />
masturbate. What else would she be able to do? Had she become <br />
a total failure as a mother? Why did she test that medication on <br />
him? What else would she do? <br />
<br />
The day passed that way, her thinking about herself, her boy <br />
and what she did. The house was terribly quite. Not a sound <br />
to be heard. &quot;Raul must still be sleeping.&quot; Lucille thought when <br />
the clock had passed 8 P.M. and Raul who would usually <br />
come down for either lunch or because all the weekend <br />
movies on tele were about to start, had not shown himself. <br />
<br />
Gravely concerned, Lucille prepared two turky sandwiches, <br />
took a glass of milk and brought it up to his room. She listened <br />
intently, but there was nothing to be heard. No music, no <br />
computer. Noting. Lucille carefully opened the door and slipped <br />
into the room. Raul was still on his bed, sleeping. She put down <br />
sandwiches and milk and closed up on him. &quot;Was he still <br />
sleeping? He must have slept for eight hours now. All the time <br />
since lunch.&quot; Lucille checked on him. She carefully put her <br />
hand onto his forehead. It was still hot, not as hot as before, <br />
but still ... his shirt and boxers, however, were all sweaty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank Lord! He is only sleeping!&quot; Lucille was more relieved <br />
thatn she was willing to admit to herself. But he could not <br />
stay like this. If he kept sleeping in his sweaty clothes he <br />
would definitely catch a cold. Lucille carefully grabbed <br />
his shirt and dragged it over his head. He did not wake up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just how deep is your sleep?&quot; Lucille was thinking. She <br />
then took off his socks and after that took a hold of his <br />
boxers to push them down and down they went. But <br />
what Lucille saw in the dim light of her son&#39;s bedroom <br />
was not expected for and completely took her by surprise.</p>
