<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Damn you, Kaitlyn,&quot; Emily thought crossly as she worked through her younger sister&#39;s homework.<br />
<br />
Her mind continuously wandering as she did so, as she found the take-home assignments easy, she wondered why her sister had done what she&#39;d done and how she, Emily was going to explain to Jacob when he came home later what had happened. No answer coming to her as she finished the last bit of Kaitlyn&#39;s homework, she looked over at her mom, who had not moved from the table since she&#39;d sat Emily down and was reading one of the magazines she subscribed to. Clearing her throat, Emily announced, &quot;Done,&quot; disliking as she did that she was hearing her younger sister&#39;s voice when she spoke.<br />
<br />
Her mother, after she&#39;d set aside her magazine, gave her a look of disbelief then reached for the homework that had been steadily piling up on the table as Emily had worked through it. Slowly going through each one, she eventually set aside and said, &quot;There. Now that wasn&#39;t too difficult, was it,&quot; to which Emily shook her head.<br />
<br />
Mrs Johnson, watching who she believed was Kaitlyn, smiled and stood. Looking at her youngest daughter, she explained, &quot;Good. Because from now on, the moment you get home, you will sit at this table under mine or your father&#39;s watchful eye and complete all your homework. There will be no TV, no outside activities, none of your weird experiments, none of it until you have finished. Do I make myself clear, young lady?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mutely, Emily nodded. Her hate of her sister growing, she listened as her mom said, &quot;Now, as you are still grounded for the next two weeks, you will make the most of that time. For the moment, you will go upstairs and clean the pigsty you call your room. Afterward, I&#39;ll find you some other chores to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
A tone of finality in her mother&#39;s voice, Emily understood she meant business. Her dislike of her sister growing even more, wanting only to be her old self and be on her date with Michael, she stood and plodded upstairs to Kaitlyn&#39;s room. There, she slowly began cleaning her sister&#39;s room, tossing out all the weird stuff the thirteen-year-old girl had collected, figuring if she had to be Kaitlyn, she was going to punish her sister as much as she could.<br />
---<br />
<br />
Jacob didn&#39;t want to admit it, but once he relaxed, he found he was actually enjoying himself. Sure, dinner had been uneventful, as Micheal had attempted to act like a gentlemen throughout the meal. And there was only a couple issues afterward, as he had asked Michael to stop calling him by pet names as they left the restaurant, which at first seemed to upset the boy, but it was all smoothed out. Then, as they arrived at the movie theatre, Jacob had become aware that he had to use the bathroom, which caused him a mild bit of anxiety, as he felt not only like a pervert going into the lady&#39;s room but also rather uncomfortable touching Emily&#39;s body once he figured out what he was supposed to do.<br />
<br />
When he&#39;d finally finished, glad he hadn&#39;t peed all over himself or Emily&#39;s clothes, he stood for a moment in front of the mirror, studying Emily&#39;s face. Absently starting to wash his hands, he took a couple deep breaths and reminded himself that he only had to get through the movie then he could go home and figure out how to switch back to his body. Finishing, he took another deep breath and feeling himself relax a bit more, he exited the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Quickly locating Michael, Jacob discovered the the boy had bought tickets to an action film. Thinking that the rest of the evening would go smoothly and that he&#39;d be too engrossed in movie to pay attention to Micheal, he listened at the boy told him, &quot;Film starts in ten minutes. You want any popcorn or soda or anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
A quick shake of his head and Jacob replied, &quot;No thanks. I&#39;m good,&quot; as he watched Michael head over to the concession stand.<br />
<br />
Hormones and emotions getting the better of him as he continued to relax, Jacob watched Michael and before he could stop himself, began checking out the boy. Thinking, &quot;Even though he is egotistical and full of himself, he does have a cute, tight ass,&quot; he smiled shyly and took the boy&#39;s hand when he returned from the stand with a try balanced in one. Allowing himself to be led, Jacob tried to tell himself, &quot;Stop. This isn&#39;t your life. And you will have to give it back,&quot; but once the house lights dimmed, he found himself leaning comfortable into Michael, barely paying attention to the movie, liking how the secure it felt to have a big, strong guy with him.<br />
<br />
Afterward, they passed the ride home in silence. When they reached Emily&#39;s house, Jacob listened as Michael asked, &quot;So, will I see you again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Coyly, Jacob looked over at the boy and whispered, &quot;Maybe,&quot; and before he could stop himself, the biological functions of his body took over and feeling hot and flushed, he leaned over and kissed Michael.<br />
<br />
The boy returning the sign of affection, the two remained locked together a bit longer before Jacob gently pulled away. Smiling sweetly, he whispered again, &quot;Maybe,&quot; before getting out of the car and heading up the front walk. A light and airy sensation that mixed nicely with the hot and flushed feeling washing over him, he let himself into the Johnson residence and slowly closed the door, watching Michael drive away as he did so.<br />
---<br />
<br />
She hadn&#39;t wanted to take Jacob&#39;s body, but when the fortuitous option presented itself, Kaitlyn had seized it. Her original plan of course, once she&#39;d located the Toroid of Transformation, was to turn herself into a boy and see if she could make her life better by doing so. Now, being Jacob, unsure if she had actually switched with Emily or Jacob, and not really caring, she lay on the boy&#39;s bed, staring up at the ceiling. Idly playing the bit of metal that had allowed her to make the change, she thought about how the laws of reality would eventually set in place as if nothing had changed, making her Jacob and whoever she&#39;d switched with Kaitlyn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much the same way concrete hardens,&quot; she muttered and liking the sound of her masculine voice, she sat up, looked over at Jacob&#39;s desk, where his homework waited, considered having a crack at it, and instead let her mind wander.<br />
<br />
Despite her efforts, she was kind of curious as to who she&#39;d swapped with. Yet, at the same time, thought whoever it was, deserved it. If it had been Jacob, she figured he could finally stop pining over Emily and would be able to see her any time he wanted &quot;Granted,&quot; she reasoned, &quot;he wouldn&#39;t be able to date her. But, than again, he never really had a chance,&quot; and smiling, she considered that if it had been Emily in Jacob&#39;s body, her sister deserved to be Kaitlyn.<br />
<br />
&quot;And live my wretched life,&quot; she mused as she considered how their mom had always harped on about how she didn&#39;t take school seriously, which Kaitlyn didn&#39;t because it didn&#39;t challenge her, the way the girls in her class acted like stuck-up, mean bitches who teased her about having zits instead of tits, how weird she was and all the other things they did, plus how she didn&#39;t like being a girl, as her clothes didn&#39;t feel right anymore, her chest was constantly sore and tender, she had fluids leaking from her body, her mom and Emily went on how she should act more mature and be more like a girl, and the list went on.<br />
<br />
&quot;But all that has changed,&quot; Kaitlyn thought as she walked over to Jacob&#39;s desk and setting the Toroid next to a pencil cup, she sat down. Absently pulling the nearest book close, she figured that if she was going to have a shot at making a change in her life, she might as well make the best of it.<br />
<br />
When Jacob&#39;s dad called her down for dinner, Kaitlyn had only made a partial dent in the boy&#39;s take-home assignments. Some of it was easy and came to her no problem. Other things were beyond her, which frustrated her. Thinking the answer lie with the Toroid, she wondered what she could do to help her situation. Not wanting to switch back, she barely listened as Jacob&#39;s dad, &quot;My dad,&quot; she mentally corrected herself, told her that after dinner she had chores to do and what they were.<br />
<br />
Not to thrilled with the idea of doing Jacob&#39;s chores, Kaitlyn made a half-hearted comment of, &quot;Okay,&quot; or &quot;All right,&quot; when her dad paused and she figured she was expected to say something.<br />
<br />
After dinner, she set about completing Jacob&#39;s chores. When she had finished that, Kaitlyn went back upstairs. Ignoring Ashley&#39;s snide comments, Kaitlyn ducked into Jacob&#39;s room and sat back down at his desk. Starting once again on the homework before her, she soon found herself distracted as she thought about what she could do, what she should do and all that she had planned to do once she had found the Toroid of Transformation. Knowing that it was because of her astute mental capacities that had allowed her to easily tap into and use the the thing, she figured that if her sister and Jacob had switched, the boy might probably possessed an inkling of the same mental abilities and so had likely activated the Toroid accidentally. Looking down at the assignment she was working on, Kaitlyn asked herself, &quot;If I am to be Jacob, why not take this one step forward?&quot;<br />
<br />
An idea starting to form, she understood that before she did anything, she must it flushed out. And by the time it was time for her to go to bed, she thought she had it perfected as much as she would be able to. Taking the Toroid with her, she lay in Jacob&#39;s bed and listened to the house as Ashley and Jacob&#39;s parents eventually retired for the evening. Getting up after about a half hour, she moved as quietly as she could across Jacob&#39;s bedroom, opened the door and crept down the hall to the bathroom. There, she shut the door and flipped on the light. Looking into the mirror, she clutched the Toroid tightly. Relaxing, allowing her mind to go to work as she activated the bit of metal, she began working over herself another transformation.</p>
