<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You thinking what I’m thinking,” Ty smirked. Eileen nodded a wide smile spreading across her face, without another word Ty now began to focus his powers on Melissa, Diana, and. Victoria.<br />
<br />
The three 40 year old women didn’t notice the first changes taking place. As Ty and Eileen peaked out they could see the three of them, their faces looked a little smoother, while the grey in their har seems to vanish. The two teens could see them adjust their clothing as they now hit 30. “How far are they going to go back,” Eileen asked. “Well if they’re going to act like brats then that’s how young they’re getting,” Ty stated. Eileen now began to watch intently as the women got younger, Ty’s statement was open for interpretation meaning she wasn’t sure how young these three were about to end up.<br />
<br />
As the three women now journeyed backwards through their 20s the two teens could see their bodies firming up as their faces smoothed. Eileen begrudgingly had to admit that they were all very attractive. As they hit 25 she was stunned by their beauty, now she understood why they had been so arrogant. “Wow they were hot back in the day,” Eileen whispered, noticing Diana brush her auburn hair over her shoulder.<br />
<br />
“They may look pretty but their ugly deep down,” Ty said. “Maybe they’ll grow up better this time around.”<br />
<br />
“Wait your going to leave them as kids,” Eileen exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Ty shrugged, he was definitely considering it. “I don’t like how they talked to you Eileen,” he whispered. “They need to learn some manners.”<br />
<br />
“That’s so sweet,” Eileen smiled, placing a gentle peck on Ty’s cheek. As she turned once more towards the women she let it an audible gasp,<br />
<br />
Victoria, Diana, and Melissa looked like high school seniors now. Thenthree 18 year olds seems non the wiser that they were now half their original age. Eileen could see the three of them fidgeting in their seats as their clothing grew ever baggier in their narrow teenage bodies. “What is taking June so long,” Melissa groaned. Standing up the brunette teenager stumbled in her heels, surprised to find them loose on her feet. “What is going on here?”<br />
<br />
“I was going to ask the same question,” Melissa said curiously. “My clothes feel so loose now. Even my shoes seem a bit big on me.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe that diet is finally working,” Victoria shrugged. “Lord knows you two could stand to lose a few pounds.”<br />
<br />
“Says the drunk,” Melissa scoffed, glaring angrily at the raven haired teen.<br />
<br />
As the three seniors began to argue, Eileen and Ty continued to watch. The three teens were continueing to bicker, trading barbs back and forth as they raced back through high school. They now watched as June’s friends began reliving puberty in reverse, the teenage beauties growing more innocent in appearance. By the time they became freshmen once more, Ty and Eileen beheld three teenage girls with innocent looking faces, small breasts, and flared teenage curves. <br />
<br />
“I think they’re our age now,” Eileen said quietly. Crinkling her nose, she glared at the three 15 year old girls. “Ugh they sound like the kind of girls I hated in high school. Classic mean girls with their noses in the air belittling everybody.”<br />
<br />
“Well let’s see if they were just as nasty back in grade school then,” Ty smirked.<br />
<br />
Victoria, Diana, and Melissa continued growing younger now, exiting high school and renetering junior high. The young teens, while very pretty, still had nasty attitudes as they traded barbs with one another. Somehow they remained oblivious to their changes, even as their once impressive breasts continued to evaporate into their chests. As the girls went from 13 to 12 Ty and Eileen could see the girls now rapidly losing height as they descended further into childhood.<br />
<br />
As the three of them continued arguing they paused, the room seemed somehow bigger than before. As they carefully looked at one another the gravity of what was happening finally hit them. “Whats happening,” Diana exclaimed. “We’re, we’re shrinking!”<br />
<br />
“No,” Melissa whispered, glancing first at herself then the others. “We’re not getting smaller, were getting younger!”<br />
<br />
The three sixth graders gazed in horror at the Youthening bodies, grabbing their small softball sized breasts as they looked at each other’s innocent faces. “How is this happening,” Diana cried, wincing as her voice began to crack in a childish soprano. “I don’t know,” Melissa whined, “But we need help now!” Frantically the three now began to try and find the source of their predicament to no avail. As the trio went from 12 to 11 they let out a small shriek as their pants finally collapsed around their ankles.<br />
<br />
“We need to get June hurry,” Victoria said, stepping out of her shoes and pants. Victoria and Melissa followed suit as the three 11 year olds now began running barefoot through the house. As they reached the stairs they tried to push the cuffs of their sleeves over their hands. “June are you upstairs,” Diana called as she shrank back to 10. “June it’s us we need your help.”<br />
<br />
“Where is she,” Melissa whined stomping her foot in annoyance as the trio became 9. “Look at us! We can’t be more than 9 years old.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to be a little girl,” Victoria cried, wiping her eyes and nose on her massive sleeve. “”Stop being such a crybaby,” Diana frowned as the girls shrank down to 8. “Crying about it won’t help. We need to do something.”<br />
<br />
“What can we do,” Melissa groaned. “Look at us, were kids and were still getting younger. We could pass for first graders right now.” The girls looked themselves over, realizing Melissa was right. The trio were now 6 years old, their blouses hanging past their knees as the nexk hole of their shirts gaped around them exposing useless bra straps. Even the sleeves of the girls shirts now completely covered their hands. As they inspected themselves further they realized no one would believe them to be adults.<br />
<br />
“What are we going to do,” Diana moaned. As the girl gazed at herself she could see her auburn hair had returned to the bright orange tint of her childhood. “I don’t know,” Melissa the tiny brunette whispered, wiping her eyes on her large sleeves. Victoria’s lip now began to quiver as she sunk down to the ground, her ebony hair falling over her face. “I want my mommy,” she whimpered. The others now sank to the floor to, crying like the children they had become.<br />
<br />
“Wow,” Eileen gasped. “They’re So small...and cute. Too bad they have shitty attitudes.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe they’ll change when they grow back up,” Ty shrugged. “Only question is what do we do with them now?”</p>
