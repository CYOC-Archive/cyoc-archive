<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the most part, November 5, 2015* was as normal a Thursday as anyone had ever seen.<br />
Everyone in and around Moon Lake, Washington went about their daily business, although their main topic of conversation was another matter...<br />
<br />
&quot;So, have you heard anything about what this <i>special</i> meeting tomorrow night** is supposed to be about?&quot; Alex Ramsey asked Ben Twist when they encountered each other in the halls of Moon Lake High School during a class change.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; admitted Ben. &quot;Mom usually doesn&#39;t talk about town business unless it&#39;s something I should know,&quot; he replied, referring to Samantha, the Town Chancellor. &quot;Then again, I&#39;ve been more concerned about trying to figure out how to get Frances to change her mind and let me play in the Thanksgiving Day exhibition Flag Football game,&quot; he added, referring to his other mother.<br />
&quot;Well, Nate and I have been thinking about that too, and we&#39;ll put our heads together during lunch and see what we can come up with,&quot; promised Alex, referring to their Junior class period lunch and study hall hour. &quot;In the meantime, I&#39;ve got to hustle to my next class.&quot;<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; replied Ben, before the two friends parted company.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
&quot;Hey honey!&quot; Eric Anderson said to his fiance, spotting Julie Stovall in the hallway.<br />
&quot;Hello darling!&quot; Julie replied, happy to see a friendly face.<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; Eric asked, concerned about the woman he loved.<br />
&quot;I swear, if one more person asks me if I know anything about tomorrow night...&quot; protested Julie. &quot;Just because I&#39;m the mayor&#39;s daughter doesn&#39;t mean dad takes me into his confidence about everything under the sun or sea,&quot; she added, referring to the fact they were all were-mers.<br />
&quot;It will be okay,&quot; promised Eric, knowing words were the best he could do right now with the school&#39;s policies regarding public displays of affection. &quot;Another class and then we&#39;ll get to have lunch together. Then after school I&#39;ll—&quot; but then he stopped himself.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Julie asked.<br />
&quot;Mom made me an appointment to see Doctor Twist this afternoon, so I can&#39;t be with you,&quot; he replied, disappointed in losing time with her.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay. Depending upon how your appointment goes and whatever happens at this meeting tomorrow night, maybe we can spend the weekend together?&quot; offered Julie. &quot;Mom and dad did say we can use the pool cabana whenever we want,&quot; she added with a smile.<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it starting to get a little chilly for swimming?&quot; wondered Eric.<br />
&quot;Depends upon how you intend to swim,&quot; answered his fiance, hinting of more pleasurable things they could do.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to clear it with my folks, so unless any of our parents say no, count me in my Jewel,&quot; said Eric happily. &quot;See you at lunch,&quot; he added, before hurrying to his next class.<br />
<br />
AND AT MOON LAKE COLLEGE...<br />
Karen Yuletide sat in the classroom, dutifully listening to the lecture on computer technology in the 1980s, compared to its current status while taking notes, yet her mind was off in another universe, happily dreaming of the upcoming weekend with her fiance as Peter Talbot ushered her into were society as she truly became his lioness.<br />
<i>He says I&#39;ll need a whole new wardrobe after I become a were and promised to help reoutfit me, but I wonder just how much my statistics will change once I gain my fursona?</i><br />
&quot;And what major change was most noticeable as technology advanced... Miss... Yuletide?&quot; asked the professor, picking a student at random.<br />
&quot;What size?&quot; Karen blurted out, still thinking about tomorrow night.<br />
&quot;Correct. Size,&quot; agreed the professor, not realizing what was on her mind, let alone exactly what she said. <i>I thought for a moment she wasn&#39;t paying attention, but at least I have one student not talking about whatever is supposed to be happening at that town meeting tomorrow night.</i> &quot;As computer technology improved, it not only got more powerful, but the equipment didn&#39;t need as much space with the advent of—&quot; as the professor continued his lecture.<br />
<br />
AND ELSEWHERE ON CAMPUS...<br />
Harry Jenkins wasn&#39;t sure where exactly his wife was at the moment.<br />
He and Jenny were supposed to meet after their respective classes, but she never arrived.<br />
Through the life/soul mate bond they shared as a devoted couple and members of the Skulk, Harry knew his beloved vixen was <i>physically</i> okay, but emotionally seemed to be another matter.<br />
He decided to start his search from her last class.<br />
Although still in his human form, it was easy for the werefox to pick up her scent, which quickly led him to the one place he couldn&#39;t enter: a woman&#39;s restroom.<br />
Placing his ear to the door, Harry could barely hear Jenny&#39;s voice and thought it sounded stressed, but the acoustics weren&#39;t good enough for him to make out any words.<br />
Realizing there wasn&#39;t much he could do until she came out, Harry found a spot across from the restroom entrance and waited.<br />
<br />
Harry was happy to finally see her, but surprised it was another 20 minutes before Jenny emerged from the restroom.<br />
He was about to ask if everything was okay when she rushed into his arms and hugged him.<br />
Harry held his wife close to comfort her. He felt her head on his shoulder as he lovingly ran his hands across her back. She wasn&#39;t crying, but definitely wasn&#39;t happy.<br />
&quot;Jenny...&quot; he said after a while.<br />
&quot;James Junior called me just as I was getting out of class, so I ducked in there to take the call,&quot; she began, wrapping her arms around him to embrace her mate tighter.<br />
&quot;Is everything all right?&quot; Harry asked cautiously.<br />
&quot;Kind of,&quot; was her reply, before gathering her thoughts to continue.<br />
&quot;At first the insurance company was wanting a second opinion on the matter, and you know how long that might have taken. But the doctor back there said dad might not make it through this weekend without the operation, and got emergency permission to proceed,&quot; began Jenny. &quot;Big brother called me after he got out of surgery. Dad will be fine, in time.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s good news,&quot; was all Harry could say.<br />
&quot;Not the rest of it,&quot; replied his wife. &quot;While they were operating on him, a lawyer for Dieter Wilhelm tried to serve dad, but couldn&#39;t because of the surgery. It appears that there&#39;s some kind of non-disclosure agreement in dad&#39;s employment contract with the power company, so talking to the police or any other authorities about Wilhelm&#39;s actions against me might be in violation of it.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s bullshit,&quot; blurted out her husband.<br />
&quot;True. But at least for now—pending further review of the situation—it doesn&#39;t stop the power company from suspending dad from work, which also suspends his medical insurance,&quot; revealed Jenny.<br />
&quot;Ouch,&quot; was all Harry could say.<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; agreed Jenny. &quot;I mean, dad isn&#39;t going to be able to work in any capacity for quite a while, if ever, but the medical insurance, let along the short and long term disability insurance he had—even though it would have only paid 60% of his average pay check—would have helped mom out somewhat financially.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t your brother find a lawyer and fight this?&quot;<br />
&quot;He promised to look for one as soon as possible, but he stayed with mom all night in the waiting room while dad was in surgery. The poor guy sounded totally exhausted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He does have a lot to deal with,&quot; agreed Harry.<br />
&quot;Which is why I would love to see James and his girlfriend move here after they graduate college next Spring,&quot; replied Jenny. &quot;You know, get a fresh start. Be among friends and family. Maybe even go furry...&quot;<br />
&quot;A nice thought. But everything, especially that last part, has to be their decision and theirs alone,&quot; Harry reminded her.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; said Jenny. &quot;As it is, between ICU and initial recovery, dad&#39;s going to be in the hospital for at least the rest of the month, if not longer. You can imagine how the bills will mount up.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; was all Harry could say, thinking of what might happen if his parents, the only members of the Jenkins clan who were NOT weres, were in a similar situation.<br />
&quot;And with rehab and whatever, it would be sometime at this point next year before dad could even think about the possibility of reentering the work force, provided that&#39;s physically possible without hurting himself. Although for the power company in any capacity is probably out.&quot;<br />
&quot;What about Dieter Wilhelm and all the charges he&#39;s facing?&quot; wondered Harry.<br />
&quot;All James knew was that his lawyers were fighting them,&quot; replied Jenny.<br />
&quot;That will be an uphill battle at best, especially on the Federal level.&quot;<br />
&quot;But there is some good news. A court representative did visit my folks in the hospital yesterday. They made their statements and signed everything, so as soon as all the paperwork is processed and made official, John and Janice are officially in my custody.&quot;<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; Harry said with a smile before kissing his wife. <i>Instant family, but I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.</i><br />
When their lips parted, he asked, &quot;So, when can they start school? I know John&#39;s chomping at the bit to do so because of that Ginger O&#39;Toole...&quot;<br />
&quot;If all goes well, hopefully in early December, depending upon when the district actually wants to accept them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, but by then they&#39;ll have missed almost a full month, easy. There&#39;ll probably be some kind of a placement test for both, since I know Washington state will want to confirm what they do know, versus what they think John and Janice should know.&quot;<br />
&quot;Plus whatever make up assignments there might be,&quot; realized Jenny.<br />
&quot;Hey, they&#39;re bright kids. It may be work, but they&#39;ll get through it. After all, look who they have for guardians,&quot; bragged Harry, before hugging his wife again.<br />
&quot;Thank you darling,&quot; said Jenny, laying her head affectionately against his chest.<br />
