<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Walking down the street, looking at all of the people wearing costumes, the three 
continuously looked for candidates. Kat, who was 
eager to use her powers to turn several others into the things that they were wearing. 
Nate, getting into his new persona decides to hang 
back a little bit behind Kat. Nate felt different, but he couldn't put his finger on this new 
feeling.</Br>
<Br>Pat, having walked with Kat, looked to his right of Kat and noticed that Nate was 
walking slightly behind both of them. Curious to 
know what Nate was up to, he slowed and walked beside Nate while Kat was in her own 
world. Knowing that Kat wouldn't even notice what 
was going on behind her, Pat decided to ask Nate what exactly he was up to.</Br>
<Br>Whispering, to ensure Kat did not hear the conversation, Pat decided to ask his 
question. "Nate, bro... what's up?"</Br>
<Br>Nate, disturbed from his thoughts, looked at Pat blankly for a moment. Then, Nate 
smiled showing off his fangs and Pat knew that he 
was up to something.</Br>
<Br>Whispering, like Pat had done, Nate made the same effort to keep Kat from hearing 
their conversation. "Pat, nothing is up really. I just 
have this strange sensation since Kat made me into a real werewolf. Do you feel anything 
strange?"</Br>
<Br>Saying nothing, searching within his feelings, Pat stumbled upon the same strange 
feeling Nate felt. Watching Pat, Nate noticed that 
Pat's face was contorted  slightly and Nate knew Pat felt the same thing now that Nate 
turned Pat on to it.</Br>
<Br>"So Pat, you do feel it... don't you?"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah... I do! What is it?"</Br>
<Br>"I don't know... it feels like I want to turn people. I want to make them like me and 
make a family of werewolves. I'm sure you want to 
make others into vampires, like yourself, to have your own family."</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, I do! Do you think we should act on that impulse, that drive?"</Br>
<Br>"I would love to, but do you think Kat would do something to stop us?"</Br>
<Br>"I know she would, she is my sister and I have known her my whole life. She is just as devious as we are and she would make sure 
to undo what she has done."</Br>
<Br>"Then... I guess that means we need to take her out of the picture, completely and for good."</Br>
<Br>"How exactly do you think we should do that Nate? I mean, she is my sister and I 
can't exactly kill my own family member. Secondly, my 
other brother Dan would wonder what is up. Most importantly, Kat is a witch and if you 
remember, she was the one that made us like this in 
the first place. Don't you think something would go wrong?"</Br>
<Br>"I will take care of both Dan and Kat at the same time. Then, once they are both 
taken care of, we can go and do what we want."</Br>
<Br>"So what exactly did you have in mind?"</Br>
<Br>"Just leave that up to me Pat. Believe me, what I have in mind would work out the 
best for everyone... well, everyone except for 
Kat."</Br>
<Br>"Alright, I trust you. Do what you think is necessary."</Br>
<Br>Nate nodded, then reached out to tap Kat on her right shoulder with his clawed paw. 
Kat, having been in her own world the entire time 
and not paying attention, she was a bit startled by the unexpected touch. Stopping, then 
turning around to face her werewolf friend, she 
smiled and looked at him with curiosity.</Br>
<Br>"Yes Nate, what's up?"</Br>
<Br>"Oh nothing, Pat and I were just talking and I had a thought that I should run by you 
quick. Pat told me about your other brother, Dan 
and I thought he could be of some use."</Br>
<Br>"Yes, my other brother Dan... I forgot about him, even as annoying as he is. I do not 
think he would be of much use to our plan Nate, 
but I will hear what you are thinking."</Br>
<Br>"Well... you have made me into a werewolf and your brother Patrick into a vampire. 
Both of our species have the ability to turn others 
into what we are."</Br>
<Br>"Right... and how would that serve our purpose? You know from the various monster 
movies that vampires all have their own will and 
don't follow plans if it doesn't serve their purpose... so how exactly would that be a good 
thing?"</Br>
<Br>"Like you said, vampires have their own agendas, just like humans. You also know, 
just like I do, that anyone turned into a werewolf is 
always subservient to the one who turned them, ultimately all werewolves are subservient 
to their leader."</Br>
<Br>"So you think Dan should be turned into a werewolf like you and help to do what 
exactly?"</Br>
<Br>"Well... he would be just one more to help turn others, whether they become 
vampires, other werewolves or other creatures of the night 
can be up to you. You would choose who and what they will be. If you think they would be 
better off like me or Pat, Dan would be able to 
help corral the choice and ensure they would comply until they have become 
whatever."</Br>
<Br>"It sounds like you have been doing quite some planning since I made you into the 
werewolf that you are now. I like the idea and we will 
go back to my house so you can turn Dan into one of your brothers of the pack."</Br>
<Br>"No! That would not be a good idea. What would happen if your parents came home 
and saw me attack Dan, or saw him transform like I 
did? No... it would be best if we met at the park somewhere secluded so no one would see 
what we were up to and if someone did see us 
after we left, then they would just think we are dressed in some really realistic costumes... 
I mean it is Halloween after all."</Br>
<Br>"Alright, we will do things your way. I will tell my brother to meet us under the 
bridge. It is the most secluded and out of view, especially 
this late at night."</Br>
<Br>Now that the plan was settled, the three walked towards the park, cutting through 
the neighborhood to get to the park as quickly as 
possible. It wouldn't be long before their chance to wreak havoc would be up and it would 
not be until the next costume party, or the next 
year when Halloween would roll around. To Kat, that was how it was, but to Nate and 
Patrick... things weren't so cut and paste. What Nate 
had in mind started here and now, but what he was truly planning would come to fruition 
in the days ahead. When they neared the park, Kat 
took out her cell phone and called her brother to find out where he was.</Br>
<Br>"Hey Dan, where are you right now?"</Br>
<Br>"Oh, hey sis... I'm near the park... why?"</Br>
<Br>"That's great news! Nate, Pat and I are headed there and we were hoping to run into 
you. Pat and I were talking and Nate wanted to 
show you his super realistic werewolf costume. You wanna see it?"</Br>
<Br>"Oh man, do I ever! You know how much I have been wanting a realistic looking 
werewolf costume and if Nate has one, he could tell me 
where to get one too! Where are you guys going to be so we can meet up?"</Br>
<Br>"We are going to be under the arc of the brick bridge, that way it is a bit more private 
and you could even try on Nate's costume."</Br>
<Br>"Sweet, I will meet you guys there in a couple minutes."</Br>
<Br>As the conversation ended, Kat put her phone away and motioned for them to 
continue. Nate smiled inwardly, knowing that his plan 
was working exactly how he wanted and soon Kat would be out of the way so that the two 
real life monsters could have their way. Within a 
matter of minutes, they were in sight of the bridge and Nate could see someone waiting in 
the dim light under it. A few steps later, Nate 
could see that it was a man dressed in a very cheesy looking werewolf costume and 
something told him that the person was Dan. This was 
perfect, Dan would make a perfect werewolf and he would more than likely follow Nate's 
directions. As the trio walked up to Dan, he 
immediately locked onto Nate and Dan's eyes went wide. If he didn't know better, he 
would say that Nate was a real werewolf, but he also 
knew that Nate couldn't be a werewolf since werewolves didn't exist in real life. When Nate 
stood under the bridge in close proximity to Dan, 
Dan was eager to touch Nate.</Br>
<Br>"Dan... this is Nate. What do you think of his costume?"</Br>
<Br>"Oh wow sis, when you told me his costume was realistic, I had no idea how realistic 
it could have been. If I didn't know better, I would 
say he is a real werewolf. I mean... costumes never look THAT realistic!"</Br>
<Br>Nate approached Dan, placing his clawed paw on Dan's shoulder and smiled showing 
off his fangs. Since Nate was so close, Dan looked 
into Nate's mouth and saw that it was attached to a realistic looking throat.</Br>
<Br>"Man... where did you get that costume?! I have to know because I want one!"</Br>
<Br>"Dan... what if I told you that this isn't a costume and that I am a real werewolf?
"</Br>
<Br>"Come on Nate, I mean yeah your voice is a bit deeper than normal, but there are no 
such things as werewolves."</Br>
<Br>"What if I prove it to you that I am a werewolf? Would you believe me then?"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah... I guess so, but how..."</Br>
<Br>Before Dan could finish his sentence, Nate moved quickly toward Dan and bit into his 
shoulder, then smiled with his fangs dripping with 
Dan's blood.</Br>
<Br>"Fuck man, what the hell?"</Br>
<Br>"This is how I can show you that I am really a werewolf, thanks to your witch sister of 
course."</Br>
<Br>Within seconds, Dan's skin started to itch and heat up. HIs muscles started to twitch 
and spasm, hair started to thicken all over his body 
and Dan's eyes widened when he realized he was changing. Quickly, Dan's eyes shifted 
from a spectacular sky blue to a brilliant amber hue. 
Dan's ears lengthened to a point, his muscles bulked up while his whole body became 
covered in a rich chestnut brown fur. As his body 
continued to shift, Dan ripped off his tightening clothes happily ridding himself of the 
dorky costume with his now pawed and clawed hands. 
His feet shifted, changed and grew ripping through his sneakers while his claws sprouted 
from his toes. Once Dan was free from the once 
confining costume, his changes progressed rapidly. His face pushed out into a muzzle, his 
nose darkening shifting into a snout, his teeth 
changed into fangs, and his ears moved to the top of his head. As the final stage of his 
transformation occurred, his tail grew out from the 
base of Dan's spine and he howled, filled with joy becoming something he had dreamed 
about for so long.</Br>
<Br>With Dan's transformation complete, Kat looked at her other brother and smiled. She 
knew that it would be easier now to continue as 
she thought, but little did she know, things wouldn't go as she had planned.</Br>
<Br>"Alright, so now we go on as planned?"</Br>
<Br>"Yes, you are right Kat, but not as you think!"</Br>
<Br>"What the hell is that supposed to mean Nate? This was your idea!"</Br>
<Br>"Yeah, you are right... it was and still is my idea. I had you help me turn Dan so that 
MY plan could go on unhindered. You see, we need 
you out of the picture so we can go about our business."</Br>
<Br>Stunned, Kat looked at Pat with shock as he nodded.</Br>
<Br>"So, you two were in on this from the start? Without my magic, you two would be 
nothing!"</Br>
<Br>"You are right sis and thank you for that, but you have outlived your usefulness and 
now your role in this has come to an end."</Br>
<Br>"You think so do you? I will show you, I will show all of you!"</Br>
<Br>Kat, in a fit of rage, started spouting off an incantation of a sort. Fearful of what she 
might weave, Nate pounced on Kat, ripping her 
throat open and leaving her unable to complete her incantation. As she fell to the floor, 
her lips curled into a devious smile and the three 
monster's eyes flashed with illumination for a second. Needing to get rid of the evidence 
of the dead body, Nate and Dan fed on the corpse 
of the witch, while Pat stood there slightly dazed. Quickly, the two pretty much left little 
remnant of the person Kat once was. Covered in her 
blood, the two werewolves looked up at Patrick the vampire. At first, they were as 
bewildered as Pat was, but within mere moments, Nate 
and Dan felt something toward Pat. Pat stared at the two werewolves, hissed and moved to 
attack them both. Quickly dodging Pat's 
movements, Nate and Dan moved to fight back. Knowing that he was outnumbered at this 
point, Pat fled off into the night, leaving the two 
werewolves to their business.</Br>
<Br>Nate and Dan looked at one another, then howled at their first victory over their 
nemesis, the vampire. Not knowing what Pat would do 
to overcome their kind, Nate knew he needed to turn others to combat whatever vampiric 
forces that may come after his kind at some point. 
Whatever the witch did in her dying breaths, Nate nor Dan would ever know, but she 
started the real-life feud between the two species. The 
question is, which side will you follow... werewolf or vampire? </Br></p>
