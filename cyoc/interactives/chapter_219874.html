<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>No actual acts of violence committed. But veiled threats are made.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The cakes that Rachael sampled were absolutely divine; almost heavenly for the new demon. Finding the cakes that were fruitier instead of the standard chocolate she was served throughout childhood more appealing. Maisy as well noticed the vast varieties; gravitating towards what was a cake made from crepe; with layers of meringue and topped with mixed berry compote.<br />
<br />
“Can we not have all these cakes,” Astaroth looking at Lilith; “preferring to ask the mother of demons these questions in lieu of the wedding planner. A wedding planner that Astaroth had little patience for and has already threatened to commit several act of violence. Acts that would earn her several years in a correctional institute on earth. Sadly for the planner, Astaroth and company were not on earth; they were in hell and the planner had little means to defend himself from a demon sporting a green Mohawk and attitude for those trying to put on airs.<br />
“How about miniature cakes,” Maisy speaking up; “and have them at each table for the wedding feast.”<br />
“I can go with that,” Rachael nodding; “not everyone likes chocolate.”<br />
“Or caramel,” Rachael’s mother blanching as she pushes one of sample away from her; grabbing a glass of wine to help wash out the sticky sweet mass of sugar sticking to the roof of her mouth.”<br />
“That could work,” Lilith nodding; “its unconventional, but this is going to be an unconventional wedding.”<br />
<br />
The wedding in question was a union between Maisy and Rachael. As well as Astaroth and Rebecca. Plus Penemue marrying Josh; brother to Rachael, son to Rebbecca. Now an angel, where Rebbeca and Rachael opted to become demons. All managed to escape the thumb of the abusive patriarch of the Church family; Reverend Church, who is now in heaven as a new angel in Kusheil’s inquisition.<br />
<br />
**************************************************************<br />
<br />
Hecate sighed as she read the first draft her spouse Lamashtu just created as the new President of the senate. Her heart feeling heavy over her lover’s extreme view in regards to humans becoming demons. While she herself opted to marry one who was demon born; that demon being Lamashtu Morningstar; Hecate knew that this new law was going to be fraught with issues.<br />
<br />
One issue being that rights of succession would be near impossible to implement as those self styled hardliners in court have children that chose humans to bond and mate with. Those humans becoming demons; they themselves starting their own families. Grandchildren that the hardliners love and dote on; spoiling them rotten despite their issues regarding parentage. With these new laws in place; those descendants would be denied dutchies, positions in parliament and the senate. Positions and estates that are considered hereditary.<br />
“Oh my love,” Hecate putting down the document; “is your heart truly made of stone that you would do this just to get back at those who teased and tormented you?”<br />
<br />
“I take it,” Lamashtu entering her office feeling like she is on cloud nine; “that you just read my opus.”<br />
“More like our societal suicide note,” Hecate crumpling the paper in question; “I know you have issues with your aunt and most of your siblings. But to foist this and have your father ratify it in court,” Hecate throwing the crumpled paper as she leaves the office; “I hope you are prepared for the fallout.”<br />
“It’s the way things should be here in hell,” Lamashtu confused as to why Hecate is displeased with this; trying to catch up to her; “humans are nothing more than cattle to us.”<br />
“No,” Hecate turning around to Lamashtu; “that is what you believe. You and a few of the old guard,” Hecate shaking her head in disappointment. “While I am sympathetic to your beliefs,” Hecate softening her voice; “I do not share them. While I indulge in your creative avenues of sexual release,” Hecate pausing to choose her words seeing Lamashtu is already getting upset. &quot;Allowing you to keep your pleasure harem and going so far as to join in on a few wild romps; I will draw the line in you trying to pass on your bigotry and hate towards our children. Children that both you and I bore together,” Hecate opening a portal to leave but pausing to say one more thing; “I’m heading to earth to see a performance your brother Enoch mentioned. It’s called The Merchant of Venice by William Shakespeare. You are more than welcome to join me; see how humanity has progress since your last visit to pluck Pallaca from the slums of London.&quot;<br />
“I’d rather endure one of Loki’s insufferable pranks then head up to that filthy world,” Lamatshu grabbing the crumpled paper that Hecate tossed.<br />
“Suit yourself my love,” Hecate sighing; “I’ll see you in few hours. Use that time to reflect on what you are missing out of and maybe think about how this will affect the old guard’s progeny. Progeny that took humans for spouses; and chose to treat them equally and not as a slaves like you feel they should be.”<br />
<br />
*********************************************************<br />
<br />
“If I may make a suggestion,” the wedding planner speaking up; making sure to be near Lilith and away from Astaroth. “Would it not be prudent and practical to have a vegan friendly dish or two, so those who attend the wedding can eat something other than water or bread?”<br />
“A vegan demon,” Astaroth scoffing before erupting in laughter; “that is the most amusing thing to come from your dick sucking lips!”<br />
“There will be angels present my love,” Rebecca countering; “there could be vegan among them.”<br />
“I suppose you’re right on that,”Astaroth nodding; “very well lets add some salads. But if you try to keep the suckling pig and lamb roasts off the menu,” Astaroth glaring at the wedding planner; “then I will personally toss you into the lake of fire and jill myself off to your screams of eternal torment!”<br />
<br />
“Aunt Astaroth,” Maisy speaking up; “perhaps you’ve had enough wine. Why don’t you take my aunt for a walk,” Maisy looking at Atargatis; “Lady Tenebra and I can handle the rest. And we will make sure that the pig and lamb stay on the menu,” Maisy smiling at her clearly inebriated aunt.<br />
“That would be wise,” Lilith opening a portal; “perhaps a stroll in my husband’s garden.”<br />
<br />
Watching the two demons head through the portal; everyone present feels somewhat relieved. Only the wedding planner made any audible noise as Astaroth was what the man clearly viewed as a Bridezilla.<br />
“Can we have this quiche for the wedding,” Rachael helping herself to another slice; “maybe as an hor d&#39;oeuvres?”<br />
“We can include it,” Lilith nodding to the wedding planner; “but I don’t think this recipe will translate well as a bite size morsel.”<br />
“No cocktail weiners,” Maisy twisting her face; “those little tubes of meat are just awful.”<br />
“Lips and assholes,” The wedding planner commenting; “that is what they are made of.”<br />
“Which is why I don’t want them,” Maisy stomping her deer hoof on the stone floor.<br />
“Stuffed mushrooms,” Rachael speaking; “those could be tasty to serve.”<br />
“Agreed,” the wedding planner nodding; sounding more confident that Maisy and Rachael are showing a refined taste that doesn’t border on an all you can eat buffet at a strip club. “Do either of you have any objections to a croquembouche tower?”<br />
“Oh now that would be perfect to pair with mushrooms and crab hor d&#39;oeuvres,” Lilith nodding; “be sure to add Champagne.”<br />
<br />
It went like this for another hour. With Astaroth out of the way, the wedding planner was able to get a good idea what the brides wanted for their big day. Sensing that Rachael and Rebbaca; Tenebra and Atargatis to the wedding planner had similar tastes he was able to infer what the missing bride would like and not like. Maisy or Miasma as she had to be referred to as this was an official family function; did have different tastes. Fortunately they were not as extreme as Astaroth; who’s tastes border on random act of violence and sexual orgies at the same time. Maisy did want some excitement and odd foor pairings; combinations the wedding planner never heard of but was soon informed that the foods in question were native to the nine circles and were quite popular.</p>
