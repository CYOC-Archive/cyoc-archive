<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joanna struggled to stand upright.  This second udder that had replaced her vagina was already pressing for space against her legs.  Even empty, the mass was large enough to force her to straddle the fleshy appendage.  She remained bow-legged as she desperately sought some way to walk.  Shoving it behind her was pointless.  Not only was there too much to shove, but it hurt and her oversized rear already took available space behind her.  She couldn&#39;t shove it forward because her larger, original udder demanded that space.<br />
<br />
She set about to face her mother, ready to give this woman a piece of her mind.  Fortunately or otherwise, her agonizingly-slow and awkward movements gave Joanna ample time to realize most of what she could speak about could easily be seen as complaints.  She calmed herself down.  &quot;Mom, I still have to go to school and do other stuff.  I can&#39;t if I&#39;m naked from the waist down and can only move at a crawl.  Don&#39;t you think this punishment is too severe?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother reeled backwards, rage apparent in her eyes.  &quot;Punishment?!  You thought this was the punishment?  I gave you a *gift* so you could practice twice as much, and you call it a punishment?&quot;  She moves over to the milk machine and unplugs it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I&#39;m not done-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your punishment was to go a week without your udder support, but apparently you&#39;re an ungrateful cow on top of everything else.&quot;  With a few clicks, Joanna felt both udders fill at an impossible rate, until that familiar feeling of pent-up need for removal had returned.<br />
<br />
Joanna struggled to stay on her feet as her legs were splayed wider and wider, until she heard her high heels snap and she collapsed to the floor, landing painfully on her lower udder and causing some of its contents to spray onto the floor.  She jolted backward to use her rear as support, but the damage had been done.  It ached with a need for release and from the weight she&#39;d sat on it.  She tried to get up, but the combined weight of both udders and her now-broken footwear left her flailing uselessly on the floor.<br />
<br />
It was then a new sensation passed through her.  It started at Joanna&#39;s hips, a deep heat and the sound of cracking, repeatedly.  Even with her udder and read concealing her true hips, it didn&#39;t take her long to realize they were widening.  The gap between her legs widened far beyond human proportion as her hips became large enough to make her oversized rear appear reasonable.  The sensation then passed into her legs.  Every muscle strained against her will as she felt the subtle creaking of her femurs following her hips&#39; lead.  Veins appeared along the sections of leg she could still see as they bulged beyond their normal capacity, and they steadily grew.<br />
<br />
Last to feel the burn was her feet.  Joanna felt a distant pressure as her presumably-growing feet briefly struggled against the remains of her high heels.  This resistance was put to an end as the material buckled in the presence of her apparently-larger feet.  Unlike her hips or legs, she felt something melting from her heels.  More concerning was the numbness still remained in her toes.  As the transformation dissipated, Joanna lifted one of her legs to get a better look at what had become of them.<br />
<br />
Hooves!  Her mother had caused her feet to transform into hooves, which looked terribly out of place with her still-human skin.  What was once her toes were now two keratinous black blobs, attached be a too-long foot to the rest of her legs.  She folded the lower limb to touch her hoof, but was shocked by how much larger her legs had actually become.  Her upper leg was easily as thick as her torso, and each claw of this hoof was larger than her hand!<br />
<br />
Her mother apparently didn&#39;t care.  &quot;Look at what you&#39;ve done!  You spilled some milk on the floor!  Get off your fat ass and clean up your mess!&quot;<br />
<br />
Still disoriented by the change, Joanna simply tried to get back on her &quot;feet.&quot;  As she heaved herself upright, she noticed several differences.  First, her lower udder was a tight, but much easier, fit than before.  With it properly milked, she might even be able to walk normally.  Second, she felt close to a foot taller.  The ceiling had never felt so disastrously close as before.  Third, she was heavier, but it felt like weight she could control, rather than weight that controlled her.  Her butt still jiggled, but it wasn&#39;t a body-swaying, balance-destroying jiggle.  Her muscles felt the strain, but she didn&#39;t feel nearly as exhausted as she had just moments before.  Lastly, she felt far more stable on these hooves than she had with her high heels.<br />
<br />
Her mother shoved a roll of paper towels and a sponge into Joanna&#39;s hands.  &quot;After you&#39;re done cleaning, time your next milking session.  You&#39;ll need to know how much earlier you&#39;ll need to wake up tomorrow morning so you can get to school on time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, school will send me home if I go naked, so-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care!  I could make the world see you as nothing more than a burger with legs!  Do you think I can&#39;t get away with sending you to school naked?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Joanna remained silent as she carefully lowered herself to the floor to clean up, but her action was interrupted by a familiar pulse from her upper udder.  It was full again, and it was back to growing!  She turned to her mother with a pleading look, but she simply continued to glower.<br />
<br />
That is, until her sadistic smile returned.  &quot;Hmm, maybe...&quot;  <br />
<br />
With a few more clicks, Joanna felt a something shift within her lower udder.  She started to sweat as the pain from the pressure mounted, reaching a ridiculous heat as it became the only thing she could focus on.  She could feel the brisk air across its entire surface, every millimeter of leg pressing into either side, and every drop of milk being held back.  She reached a hand to take care of it, but gasped as an orgasmic shock went through her body.  It was so powerful that she&#39;d somehow caused milk to squirt from the thing.  &quot;Wh-what have you d-done, mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Decided that it wasn&#39;t fair that I stole one of the best parts of being a woman and replaced it with an udder.  It&#39;s bigger than your average clitoris, so I scaled its sensitivity accordingly! Now, clean up your new mess and time yourself already.&quot;  Her mother accentuated her final sentence by leaving the room.<br />
<br />
Joanna sighed.  Every movement of her vagina-mounted udder was broadcast to her brain as it happened, and it demanded to be at the forefront of every thought.  It made cleaning difficult, but it gave her time to adapt to this newest hurdle to normal living.  Plugging the milker back in, she first started with her original udder to keep it from growing any further.<br />
<br />
It was a relieving experience.  The slow removal of her milk.  The steady reduction in the size of her milky appendage.  The repetitive switching out of bottles.  As the flow slowed down, she began to grow apprehensive.  What was her mother&#39;s sensitivity modifications going to do while being milked?<br />
<br />
Her original udder took 45 minutes until the flow was too slow to really consider worthwhile to continue.  She unhooked the machine, and with utmost care, attached the nozzles to this second one.  The teats were much easier to slip in, but even the act of sliding the tubes on was enough to cause shivers.  Knowing how orgasmic she had been when she first touched the milkbag, she lowered herself to the floor in case it knocked her off her feet.  Or hooves, now.  With apprehension, she turned the machine on.<br />
<br />
Nausea and bliss washed over her entire being.  Every pull of the machine caused unfathomable pain, but the release felt like it she had found her one true meaning in life.  She instinctively moaned and started to grind the countertop, trying to release more milk and keep the feeling going.  Her focus was purely on her udder, until the sensations abruptly stopped.<br />
<br />
The high deescalated just as quickly, and reason returned to Joanna.  She was horrified at how quickly her mind had fallen to the sensations of this ball of meat and milk.  She looked to the machine, and realized the only reason why she had been freed was due to the small bottle size.  It had filled the bottle, and needed to be replaced.  She didn&#39;t want to lose herself like that again, but she needed to finish milking this thing.<br />
<br />
She replaced the bottle, turned on the machine, then bit down on her hand.  This barely worked long enough for her to slap the backside of her udder with the other hand, causing nausea to win out over the euphoria of being milked.  Her mind was on alert for being attacked again, giving her enough time to build enough of a wall to be able to think while being milked.  It still caused her heart to flutter with every pulse, but she was slowly grow accustomed to it, rather than consumed by it.<br />
<br />
*     *     *<br />
<br />
It had only taken 17 minutes to milk the second udder, but it was smaller.  Joanna had needed to use the restroom, which was something she&#39;d worried about earlier in the day due to the sheer distance between her anus and her vagina, but that wasn&#39;t a problem any more.  Dinner was done in silence as her mother mocked her form.  She&#39;d fortunately not changed Joanna further, so that was a plus.<br />
<br />
Joanna slipped into her room, and moved to her PC out of daily habit.  As she looked over the machine, she realized the chronivac program was still open!  Peeking in, she realized it was now password protected.  Her mother must&#39;ve set something up to keep her out!  Why didn&#39;t she set the password first?  That would&#39;ve prevented this entire mess.<br />
<br />
She considered what to do next.</p>
