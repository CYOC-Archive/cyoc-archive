<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Lisa continued to look at herself versus the now giant room, she didn’t really pay attention as Eric walked over to his pet rat’s cage. Eric opened the metal door and reached in to remove the plastic igloo that his rat Tomtom was sleeping under. With his house suddenly removed, Tomtom opened his eyes and began sniffing around his cage in a sleepy daze until he was greeted by his master’s hand. Being a very friendly rat, Tomtom started licking Eric’s hand before crawling onto it so he could be taken out.<br />
<br />
Eric lifted his friend up to see that he was becoming more awake, and that some minor changes he had made to Tomtom had indeed taken effect. “Good boy. Glad to see your ready to be awake now. You ready to meet a special friend?” Eric whispered to his rat. “Oh, you’ve met her before, but now the two of you can play in a much more fun way.” Eric finished and put Tomtom on his shoulder as he sat down into his rolling chair. He was now ready to address Lisa again.<br />
<br />
“So part two has already been completed, but since those changes were mostly mental I didn’t think it was important to bring the mirror closer. However, while I explain what those changes were, I thought you’d like to play with a friend.” Eric then extended his arm to his bed to let TomTom run down and greet Lisa.<br />
<br />
Lisa was unsure of what mental changes Eric was talking about, but she was happy to see Tomtom and greeted with a loud “Tomtom, get over here rat man!”, to which Tomtom happily obeyed. Tomtom, in a way, was a special rat to Lisa. Originally Lisa had been a typical girly-girl when it came to rodents, but after Eric had convinced her to hold Tomtom and play with him, he quickly grew on her and she let her prejudges go. Tomtom bounded up to her, and it was now that Lisa could see that they were close to the same size, with her maybe just a little taller.<br />
<br />
Eric, seeing the distance between the two close, continued. “So for the mental changes, you could say that I have given Tomtom an upgrade. He’s not as smart as say a person, but he is now smarter than a top breed dog with a better understanding of human language, although he still only squeaks. I also upgraded his mind socially so he knows more about what people like and what to do in certain situations.”<br />
<br />
Lisa was intrigued by this and decided to give Tomtom a test. “Hi Tomtom” Lisa said while waving her hand in a greeting. To Lisa’s surprise, Tomtom sat up on his hind legs and waved back at her. “No way. This is too cool. Tomtom, give me a hug!” Lisa proceeded forward and wrapped her arms around her same-sized, furry friend. This time she felt Tomtom wrap his front paws around her in a hug, and he was even gentle enough that his claws did not scratch her at all. Even nicer for Lisa was that Tomtom snuggled his head onto her shoulders and leaned into the hug like a close friend or something more.<br />
<br />
As the two broke their hug, Lisa could hear a booming chuckle from Eric before he started again. “Good to see you like the changes, but that brings me to your changes.” Lisa was confused by the idea that she had changed in anyway. She didn’t look or feel any different, so she just listened to Eric. “You see, I knew we were going to get up to some really kinky and bizarre stuff with the Chronivac eventually, but I thought we’d work our way into it. I had some plans for things we could do, but since we moved the time table up, I had to make a change or two. Before I tell you what changed, I want you to remember that conversation we had about fetishes two months ago on my couch. I want you to remember what you eventually told me was a strong fetish you had, but it was something you said you didn’t think you could ever do.”<br />
<br />
Lisa remembered the conversation well enough. It had started out simply with Lisa revealing that she was bi-curious when a sunscreen commercial came on TV with a female model she thought was cute. This in turn lead to Eric revealing that he was also a little bi-curious, but only in the realm of guys that looked girl-ish. Each wanting to know more, the two lovers promised no judgement, and started down a conversation that revealed a lot to one another. However, it was the end of the conversation that Eric was talking about and Lisa remembered. With her guard completely down, Lisa had revealed one of her deepest secrets, that she didn’t think it was wrong to be sexually attracted to an animal or wrong to even want to do something with an animal. She had even gone so far to admit that while she could never see herself realistically doing something with an animal, she had fantasized about it, allowed herself to get turned on by actual animals she knew, and even masturbated to the idea of having wild sex with a dog or a horse.<br />
<br />
With the revelation of the conversation fresh in mind, Lisa has an incredibly red blush on her face as Eric spoke again. “Yeah, so your thing with animals, and how sexual they can be to you. Well I thought about changing myself into a dog at some point so you could try your hand at something you really wanted, but that’s before we decided to go this far. So instead of that, I decided to give you the chance at trying something with an actual animal that you knew, but still keeping it weird by shrinking you down to his size. But beyond just size, what I changed is your mental resistance to what you want to do. You see, if this is honestly too weird or not at all what you wanted, then that’s what you will still think and feel. However, if you look at the rat you called handsome a hundred times and decide that he’s now handsome in a much more personal way…well just don’t expect there to be a voice in your head anymore telling you that it’s wrong or that you need to stop.”<br />
<br />
It was a lot for Lisa to take in, going this far this soon…but this is what she asked for. However, her primary attraction had always been dogs and then horse. She had never actually entertained the idea of sex with another animal, much less something as small as a rat. And yet here she was, the right size for Tomtom and the rat was mentally upgraded to the point she knew she wouldn’t get hurt. The real question was, was it only dogs and horses that she wanted, or could it be something else if things were right? Lisa looked at Tomtom, a rat she really did like and thought was handsome, and thought about him in ways she had never considered. Eventually an answer came to her.</p>
