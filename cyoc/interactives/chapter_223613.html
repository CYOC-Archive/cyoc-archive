<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan Ballard is Josh&#39;s classmate in various classes. He is the talk of the classroom for his cute, innocent look that infatuated half the girls in class. Ethan has fair, lightly sun-kissed skin that compliments his ethereal blue eyes. He keeps his strawberry-blonde hair neat and combed. However, his looks are wasted by his fanaticism for his religion. Back before everyone knew what religion he was part of, everybody assumed he was a Mormon for always wearing that signature missionary attire. And lo and behold, he was indeed a Mormon when he started giving out pamphlets encouraging other students to join his religion. Still, people would ignore that side of him to be with such a handsome guy. Perks of having good looks, Josh guessed. <br />
<br />
Josh came to school at eight in the morning. There weren&#39;t many students yet in class but as usual, Ethan was already seated in his corner by the window, reading a small religious booklet. Josh didn&#39;t waste a second before he uttered the spell&#39;s activation phrase.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Posses,</i>&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
As the final whisper escaped his lips, the deep sound of a bell rang in Josh&#39;s ears. The sound of a ticking clock sounded everywhere, even though the small, plastic clock above the classroom chalkboard already stopped moving. Everyone was frozen in place. Stacy was powdering her face, and the plume of make-up had eternally floated in front of her. Her eyes were open, forever staring at her small reflection in the make-up kit. Two sets to her left, Kyle was forever suspended in the air. He was mid-jump toward his seat when Josh stopped the passage of time. And finally, in the corner of the room, Ethan&#39;s blue eyes twinkled in the sunlight, his gaze reading the edge of the page. Josh approached him and caressed the shape of his soft cheeks. He traced the outline of his supple lips and found them supple and moist. <br />
<br />
Josh could possess him right then and there, but he realized that would be too boring. He dragged Ethan&#39;s chair and Ethan&#39;s frozen body to the back. He may be frozen, but he could still move his limbs with little resistance. Josh straightened Ethan&#39;s arms so there would not be any hindrances to what he was about to do. <br />
<br />
Slowly, Josh unbuttoned Ethan&#39;s shorts. It seems the smell still works perfectly in this frozen world. He smelled of baby powder and cool perfume, and that only intensified when he removed Ethan&#39;s shorts. Under the fabric, Ethan wore tight white underwear. It surprised Josh when he realized there was a massive bulge between Ethan&#39;s legs. Little, cute Mormon boy was hiding a monster in his shorts, huh?<br />
<br />
Like the shorts, the briefs were completely powerless against Josh&#39;s stripping. Slowly, he pulled the edges and let Ethan&#39;s flaccid penis plop out. From the bounciness from which it emerged, it seemed his weiner was thirsting for freedom. And Josh just gave what it wanted. It&#39;s large compared to Josh&#39;s, and quite developed for a boy his age. And to his surprise, Ethan was uncircumcised. Folded pale skin sits on the tip, and they peeled away when Josh pulled the foreskin. Ethan&#39;s cute pink tip emerged, and the smell turned from pleasant to noxious. <br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t clean this place, huh?&quot; Josh asked, but he knew no one would hear him from this frozen world. He looked above and saw Ethan&#39;s face looking at him, his interested eyes still transfixed at the book that had long since been removed from his hands. While Josh lost himself in those blue, beautiful orbs, he swallowed the entirety of Ethan&#39;s cock. <br />
<br />
Josh had no prior experience with blowjobs, so his only teacher was the porn he watched online. He swallowed the tip, then worked his way down the shaft. Aside from the intense smell, the taste was the same. He lapped his lips on the glans while his tongue repeatedly licked from base to shaft. Time may have stopped, but it didn&#39;t stop Ethan from getting an erection. Josh spread Ethan&#39;s legs, and within this expanded space, his head bobbed up and down, sucking the delicious cock of his classmate. <br />
<br />
Josh doesn&#39;t know why, but he could sense Ethan was close to release. He hastened the speed of his head, but no times passed, and no ejaculation had come. Frustrated, Josh returned Ethan&#39;s erect cock to his underwear and buttoned his shorts. He dragged Ethan back to his desk, and that&#39;s when Josh proceeded to possess his Mormon classmate. <br />
<br />
Josh closed his eyes and pressed his nose on Ethan&#39;s neck, smelling his baby powder aroma and feeling the smoothness of his skin. He bit into him and tasted the neutral flavor of his skin. He imagined melting into him, becoming one with Ethan&#39;s form. Josh did not need to open his eyes to feel his desires becoming true. He lost his shape and seeped into the body of Ethan. It&#39;s strange, feeling one moment and losing it at the other. He lost every tactile sensation of being alive. He lost the ability to feel the cold crisp air, taste the lingering flavor of Ethan&#39;s cock, smell the baby cologne, or hear the deafening silence of the unmoving world of his making. There was only him and this void. But as soon as it came, Josh was pushed back into the world of the living.<br />
<br />
Josh heard the laughter of his classmates and the rank, rubbery smell of their classroom. He could taste the mint from this morning&#39;s toothpaste and feel the rush of his heartbeats as his cock stood erect against the tight fabric of his underwear. Josh sucked Ethan&#39;s cock, but failed to make him cum because time had stopped. But the pressures remained and resuming time uncorked the bottle. <br />
<br />
Josh lurched forward and buried his face in the book Ethan was reading before. He hid the blush, and his strange moans as his cock creamed relentlessly inside his underwear. He felt the warmth and slickness of his semen dripping and filling what little space remained on his crotch. He whimpered in Ethan&#39;s voice and cried his tears. When he gained some semblance of strength, he rushed to the bathroom and locked the door behind him.<br />
<br />
In the mirror, Josh sees Ethan&#39;s crying and blushed face. Just like that... He became Ethan.</p>

What did Josh do next?</h3>
