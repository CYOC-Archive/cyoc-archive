<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Let’s start with the smaller animals and work our way to the bigger animals.” offered Amber with a scared laugh as she moved closer to her boyfriend, both of them uneasy by how well this haunted house was set up.<br />
<br />
So they moved left heading toward the “smaller” arctic animals. The area was set in a large open area with small pens along the right most wall which Chris knew from working at the zoo backed up to the tanks for the water animals on the other side of the wall while larger pens lined the left side which had opens so that the wolves and foxes could go outside when the weather was good. The area in the middle was open with multiple seats and interactive areas for kids. <br />
<br />
The place was trashed with what looked to be a graveyard set up which was already creepy given that a fog machine was covering the ground with a light amount of smoke. However, some of the fake headstones were torn apart showing that they were made of plastic which would ruin any attempt to be horrifying. However, the fake headstones where nothing compared to the number of bodies on the ground, they were torn to shreds, some had heads gone, some had multiple limbs gone and others looked more like wild animals had eaten them.<br />
<br />
“Chris…I don’t think those are fake.” Said Amber as Chris’s eyes widened, he recognized some of the people, they were his coworkers.<br />
<br />
“Help…” said a weak voice as a figure came stumbling into the room from one of the storage areas. However, the figure was clearly not human…at least not fully.<br />
<br />
It was like watching one of those “fake” videos on the furry virus which was going around on the internet but in real life.<br />
<br />
The woman, still wearing what looked to be a zombie outfit was in the middle of a horrifying transformation. Her face was changing as her lips became a beak as feathers grew out of her skin. It was painful just to watch and looked even more painful to go through, the feathers where a white color but with black tips. Longer feathers formed on her arms and new flesh grew out to make a new “finger” on her hand but that was more like a wing which could fold up under her arm allowing possible flight while still giving her hands. One of her shoes was burst open to show talon feat, her cloths ripped apart to show her bare chest which was now half covered in shorter feathers giving a humanoid outline and even a slightly sexy outline to a horrifying image. <br />
<br />
Her head turned, far more then what a human could possibly do but much more in line with an Owl. Her eyes one still human but the other much larger were looking at them. The animal eye with what looked at them like prey while the human one was begging for help.<br />
<br />
“Amber Run.” ordered Chris as both turned to leave only to see two more figures standing behind them. <br />
<br />
They weren’t human but looked like giant white weasels each standing almost as tall as Amber but still shorter than Chris. One of them still wore the vest which all zoo employees had to wear most of the day.<br />
<br />
“We have newcomers.” said one of them.<br />
<br />
“We should get them.” said a new voice as out from the side came four rabbit man but two were clearly women. There fur was white but some still had human like hair styles and colors. They were taller than the weasels but not by much and that could be only because their ears almost grazed the ceiling.<br />
<br />
“No…we should.” added yet another voice as coming out of the clearly broken glass of the pen was a white fox looking women.<br />
<br />
“No, our pack needs more members.” came a gruffer voice as a wolf man stepped out from where the pen for the wolves would be. “We need more to spread our hunting ground.”<br />
<br />
“If we are talking numbers, I have the fewest.” stated yet another voice as coming out of the storage area where the women who was now fully transformed had been came an owl man. <br />
<br />
“You just got that one.” countered the <br />
<br />
“We could split them?” offered the wolf, as Amber held on to Chris tighter even as he did the same his eyes darting around trying to find a way out.<br />
<br />
“They seam to be a mated couple that wouldn’t be wise.” Offered the owl <br />
<br />
“But it could be done.” countered the weasel <br />
<br />
“Worse case we just eat them.” said the rabbit as he bent down and picked up a leg from someone and actually started eating them. <br />
All the animal people eyed each other, not fully trusting the other group while not wanting to fight either. <br />
<br />
“What do we do Chris?” whispered Amber</p>

The animals where debating but that wouldn&#39;t last forever, so what do you do?</h3>
