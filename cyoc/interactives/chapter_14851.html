<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd drove home in a daze.  It wasn't far -- he lived about a mile away -- and traffic was <br />
so light he barely noticed the trip.  Sitting at the very front of the seat, he was able to <br />
manage the pedals as the big steering wheel rolled under his hands.  His truck gave him a <br />
little elevation over most of the other cars, but his reduced vantage was clear every <br />
moment of the trip.  Pulling along side a convertible, he looked over and down at the large <br />
man who drove it.  Of course the driver wasn't unusually large, but every man seemed <br />
large to Todd now.  &quot;I've shrunk,&quot; he mumbled aloud.  &quot;I've actually, fucking shrunk,&quot; he <br />
said louder, with a shake of his head, still somewhat disbelieving it despite his senses.<br />
<br />
Pulling into the driveway and turning off the truck, Todd wrestled his toolbox out of the <br />
car.  It was heavier, but the real inconvenience was its volume.  Along each dimension the <br />
box was larger than usual.  To make matters worse, his hands and arms were smaller.  For <br />
a split second, Todd thought of leaving it in his truck, but he had plans for the magic <br />
wand which was hidden inside.  He couldn't afford for that to go missing.  With a little <br />
awkwardness he got out of the truck, toolbox in hand, and headed to the front door.<br />
<br />
This brought up a new problem he hadn't really noticed while driving.  Cumming in his <br />
clothes had seemed extremely hot at the time, but was getting very uncomfortable.  As <br />
everything dried and started to stick in place, the skin and hair in his crotch was getting <br />
yanked with every stride.  Sliding the key in the lock, he quickly went inside and started <br />
stripping off his clothes for a shower.  His roommate wouldn't be home for another half <br />
hour, but he stashed the toolbox deep in his closet anyway.  He thought about taking the <br />
wand out just for a moment -- just to look at it, but his groin discomfort brought him <br />
back to his original plan of getting in the shower.  He tossed his clothes into a pile and <br />
closed the door to his room behind him.<br />
<br />
Once in the bathroom, naked, with the lights on, Todd was reminded of his new smallness.  <br />
He had never forgotten his size, but for a few moments his mind had been crowded with <br />
more mundane thoughts.  The man in the mirror looked oddly small as Todd watched his <br />
synchronized movements.  The proportions were wrong for a child, but the size was <br />
wrong for an adult.  Watching the small creature move off the edge of the mirror as Todd <br />
approached the tub was both arousing and disturbing at the same time.<br />
<br />
The shower, on the other hand, held none of the afternoon's other discomforts.  Todd had <br />
the water on in a moment, and it had the same familiar feeling as always.  The soap was <br />
large, but not so dramatically that it was a problem.  The shower head was a little high, <br />
and the angle was a little funny, but it was really just like he remembered from being a <br />
kid.  He looked at his body in the shower.  It wasn't particularly masculine.  He had no hair <br />
on his chest or face, and only a little on the rest of his body below the neck.  Pulling the <br />
shower curtain back slightly so he could look out into the rest of the large bathroom he <br />
wondered if he really was just a kid -- maybe he wasn't an adult and his body had never <br />
&quot;grown up&quot;.<br />
<br />
Todd often had such fantasies.  Sometimes they were about age regression, and other <br />
times his body just shrunk or had always stayed small.  As a child he had wanted to be big <br />
and manly, but after all the intervening years he had long since given up on that and <br />
instead really enjoyed the idea of serving a musclebear's pleasure.  Just thinking about it <br />
made his little dick stand up again in the shower.<br />
<br />
Soon the afternoon's events were replaying in his mind's eye as he jacked off.  For years he <br />
had wanted to get a close look at Paul's body.  Today was so much more than that.  Paul <br />
had actually been holding him and kissing him like he really enjoyed Todd too.  And then <br />
the shrinking!  First, realizing he'd shrunk, and then continuing to reduce while the hairy <br />
bear jacked off next to him.  At first Todd was Paul's same height, then eye level with <br />
Paul's nose.  Todd was stroking himself faster now as he went through the reverie.  Paul <br />
started shooting and Todd's eye level was reduced to Paul's chin.  The shrinking seemed to <br />
go faster while Paul's dick was unloading, squeezing Todd down.<br />
<br />
Visualizing Paul's swelling dick, remembering the weight of the larger man's balls and the <br />
warmth of his arm was too much for Todd.  He started shooting hard, with cum flying high <br />
in the air as his short rod spat out the pressure.  Shot after shot, Todd's orgasm gradually <br />
wound down and he looked at his hardon.  It had always been small, but right now -- fully <br />
hard -- it seemed even smaller than usual.  Todd measured it against his palm with a sigh <br />
and said to himself, &quot;Well, you finally have a good reason to be so small.&quot;  While the rest of <br />
his body had contracted proportionally, his penis had definitely taken an extra hit of <br />
shrinking.<br />
<br />
Todd turned the water off and was soon wrapped up in a big towel, and in his own <br />
thoughts.  Drying off, he took in more of the bathroom than he had on his way to the <br />
shower.  Reality started to set in about just how small he was now.  It was impossible to <br />
tell his height for sure, but he guessed it had to be around five feet based on his <br />
recollection of standing next to Paul.  His cock started stiffening again at the focus on his <br />
diminution, and he caressed it thoughtfully.  &quot;Maybe we can do something about your <br />
size,&quot; he said, wrapping the towel fully around his body and looking forward to holding <br />
the silver wand again.  In truth, he wasn't sure if he would use the wand to enlarge his <br />
dick, or shrink it even more.  Just the thought made his erection pound at full-mast.<br />
<br />
Safely back in his room with the door closed, Todd let the towel drop.  He had planned to <br />
go straight to the wand, dick in hand, but the room felt cold against his damp skin and his <br />
boner was wilting.  Looking over, he saw the window was open.  Instead of closing it, he <br />
turned towards his dresser, now taller than he was.  With some difficulty, he managed the <br />
drawers and soon had a few clothes handy.<br />
<br />
Stepping into his underwear, he knew immediately that it was wrong.  He pulled it up <br />
anyway just to confirm, and it fell promptly back to his ankles when he let go.  These <br />
clothes were too big for him -- way too big.  It was like playing with his dad's clothes <br />
when he was 8.  Obviously this wasn't going to work, and it suggested that there might be <br />
a lot of problems with being small that he hadn't included in his fantasies.  On the other <br />
hand, he realized he could correct everything with the wand in a minute anyway.<br />
<br />
Kicking the clean clothes aside, he went back to his pile of used ones.  They had shrunk <br />
with him, so they should be able to keep him comfortable while he decided which wish <br />
was his most important one.  The underwear were beyond salvaging, so he started with his <br />
shirt.  The neck and sleeves which had fit perfectly when he pulled them off were clearly <br />
meant for someone much larger.  His jeans barely stayed on his hips, and he rolled the <br />
extra material on each leg into cuffs.  The clothes weren't comically large, as his normal-<br />
sized underwear had been, but they were definitely many sizes too big.<br />
<br />
Todd had a sinking sensation in his gut.  Grabbing a pencil and tape measure off the top <br />
of his dresser, he quickly stood against the wall and marked his height.  Holding the tab of <br />
the tape measure with a toe, he counted out the inches up the wall mumbling, &quot;12, 24, <br />
36.&quot;  At 36, he knew something was wrong... he wasn't bent over enough.  &quot;Come on 60,&quot; <br />
he coaxed the tape measure as it passed 42, knowing that 60 inches would confirm his <br />
previous expectation of being 5 feet tall.  But the tape didn't go to 60.  Instead, it stopped <br />
at 51.<br />
<br />
51 inches.  That was 4 feet 3 inches.  He double-checked his measurement.  Maybe it was <br />
51 1/2 or maybe 50 1/2, but he knew he had done nothing incorrect.  Todd's mind <br />
wheeled, shocked.  &quot;4-3,&quot; he mumbled.  Todd knew Paul was 5' 10&quot;, so that would make <br />
him more than a foot and a half shorter than his hunk.  But Todd knew there was no way <br />
that he had been that small standing with Paul.  On top of the evidence provided by his <br />
reduced yet still oversized clothes, Todd knew he had to accept what was happening.  &quot;I'm <br />
still shrinking,&quot; he whispered harshly, simultaneously thrilled and terrified.<br />
<br />
Terror became the dominant emotion as he heard the front door open.  Brad was home.  <br />
Now Brad was also a hunk, but their relationship was cordial, not close.  Todd dropped the <br />
tape measure with a clatter and backed away from the door as he felt his enlarged <br />
roommate softly vibrate the house with each step.  Brad was the subject of many of Todd's <br />
fantasies -- probably most, in fact, because it was easy to see Brad's hairy chest around <br />
the house and occasionally catch a glimpse of something more.  Brad was blissfully <br />
oblivious to Todd's interest, and Todd planned to keep it that way.<br />
<br />
Like a sudden sugar rush, Todd felt his face flush with excitement.  He had a magic wand <br />
in his closet!  What was he worried about?  A few inches?  An alarmed roommate?  Brad <br />
was about to become a horny sex god, enjoying every moment of being worshipped by a <br />
slowly shrinking supplicant!  Todd practically threw his small body into the closet and <br />
dove for the toolbox.<br />
<br />
The lid flopped open in the dim light, and Todd reached exactly to where he had placed <br />
the wand.  His hand closed around the long, rough handle of a wrench.  Leaning back, <br />
Todd looked hard at the top tray of his toolbox.  He saw his old, familiar tools, but <br />
nothing that could be mistaken for a magic wand.  Heart beating faster, Todd pulled the <br />
toolbox out of the closet and tipped it over.  Maybe the wand had fallen into the bottom of <br />
the box.  But the wand was nowhere to be found.  With escalating alarm, and noise, Todd <br />
spread the contents of his toolbox over the floor.  After 60 seconds, there was plenty of <br />
hardware arrayed at his feet, but no wand.<br />
<br />
By now, terror had completely won Todd over.  His head was spinning from the emotional <br />
roller-coaster.  His dick was soft and small, his skin cold but dry, and his heart pounding <br />
in his ears.  Without the wand, what was he going to do?<br />
<br />
As if in answer, he heard a knock on his door.  &quot;Hey, Todd, I need to do some work on my <br />
car in the driveway.  Can you move your truck to the curb?&quot; Brad called in, his baritone <br />
voice loud in Todd's small ears.<br />
<br />
Todd froze, except for his eyes.  They slid around the room looking for options.  He had <br />
made way too much noise to pretend he was asleep now.  The window was open... he <br />
could escape, but then what?  The bed... at his size, he could slip under the bed, and Brad <br />
wouldn't look for him there.  The door... he could open the door, all 51 inches of him, and <br />
watch Brad levitate in shock.<br />
<br />
The knock came again.  &quot;Hey.  Todd.  Open up.&quot;</p>
