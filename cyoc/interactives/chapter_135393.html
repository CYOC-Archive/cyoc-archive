<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning you wake up feeling dazed, but mostly sluggish, more than your body usually is. &quot;Hello Vortex,&quot; a nonthreatening feminine voice said and you looked over not recognizing it as one of the dragoness concubines, and you saw an attractive fox wearing a maid&#39;s outfit. &quot;Who....who are you? What&#39;s going o....?&quot; You paused when you noticed the area where Gared slept was empty, and the only person here was this vixen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, allow me to help you up.&quot; She said reaching for your hand and you slapped it away and growled,&quot;No! I don’t need a bitch to...urrrgh!&quot; You growled suddenly as you suddenly felt like you had a migraine, so you grasped your head and groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, let me help you, I promise that I won’t hurt you or your expecting clutch, but you must be careful.&quot; The vixen barked taking hold of one of your hands then suddenly a flash of memories hit you like a brick wall. You now looked at the vixen and blushed then muttered,&quot;J....Janice? H...how are you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My previous master Karther said that his highness Gared was looking for an egg breeding mate. Once I heard it was you I asked about it, and Prince Karther donated me to Gared. Now I guess you’re my master now....or mistress, and congratulations.&quot; Janice barked and you groaned shaking your head and asked,&quot;For what? I haven’t seen you in years, and....you say Karther was your Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you later, but sweetheart you’re going to be a mother.&quot; Janice cooed then you roared,&quot;WHAT?!&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point you saw Janice as the vixen you grew up with as best friends, and the two of you did everything with each other since you hatched at an orphanage. You knew nothing about her work, or anything about since you remember seeing her off when you graduated from college together. Then you suddenly see her now, and she tells you that she’s seen you when you haven’t seen her, and what’s more that you were going to be a mother.<br />
<br />
Janice covered her ears as you roared, then she took your hands as you began panting rapidly. &quot;Calm down dear, I wasn’t trying to set you off. Just see for yourself hun, or rather feel for yourself.&quot; Janice said and you pulled off the covers slowly and saw your stomach with a slight bulge on it, and you couldn’t believe your eyes. You then placed your hand on it and felt a warm feeling inside of it, the small fires of young hatchling&#39;s lungs and hearts were warm to the touch from your stomach. &quot;Oh god, M....Master did it, I did it....ugh! We did it on the first try!&quot; You shrieked then groaned feeling the pain in your head grow in response to your loud voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress Vortex please, being the loud one isn’t exactly the best thing right now dear. Please, allow me to take you down to your quarters and lay you down for a nice rest while I fetch a healer, or some medicine. Do you need anything else?&quot; Janice asked<br />
<br />
&quot;How could I rest when you’re here with me? Janice you don’t know how guilty I feel for that insult now, and especially not even noticing your existence back at Karther&#39;s place.&quot; You whimpered then your eyes tearing up as you added,&quot;I&#39;m so sorry Janice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It’s okay, really, I&#39;m just glad I&#39;m here, especially when my best friend is going through her first pregnancy. Here, let me help you up and we can catch up on everything together.&quot; Janice exclaimed and you smiled at her weakly as you were still trying to wrap your mind around your pregnancy and Janice while dealing with a migraine.<br />
<br />
Janice helped you up and she took you outside the room and down into a hallway where she pulled out a key and guided you into one of the rooms. &quot;Easy does it now Mistress.&quot;Janice exclaimed and you giggled a bit as she said this and commented,&quot;I&#39;m flattered, but you’re my friend with or without the title. But....why are you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m here as your servant, to help you with whatever you need, especially during this. I do admit that I don’t know much about dragon pregnancies, but from what Prince Gared tells me you&#39;ll definitely need someone to help you around when you can barely move. Actually he said that I&#39;m well...a gift from him to you.&quot; Janice said and you blushed and smiled at her,&quot;Really? Oh, I know I love that man for a reason. He&#39;s the most interesting individual I think I’ve met.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I wouldn’t know how that would feel. I was Karther&#39;s concubine for a bit, but as time went on I feel it was more an obsession then true love. You’re a lucky girl to find that in someone, and here you are going to mother a litter erm....clutch. So are you going to breastfeed them?&quot; Janice asked<br />
<br />
You looked to her and rolled your eyes,&quot;Well duh, I&#39;m not going to keep my tits swollen and achy for someone else to just do it, and I’m certainly not going to have someone milk me when I can just feed my whelps normally. I mean....&quot; You said then you growled clasping your head and Janice noticed this and put her hand on your shoulder and she sat you down on your bed and said,&quot;I&#39;ll go get something to help you, just sit here and take in the surroundings until I return. Gared also said there’s something for you in the end table here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded to her and watched as Janice left the room and sighed speechless as for what you were experiencing right now. You looked around your room and saw that the walls were purple and matched your scales, and the floors were of course wooden as expected. Your bed was nice and soft against your rump and tail. Off to the side of the room was a small private bathroom for you complete with a bathtub and shower. You also had your own wardrobe, vanity and to the side of your bed was an end table, all looked to be uniquely handcrafted from mahogany wood.<br />
<br />
You looked to your end table on the side of your bed and noticed a drawer on it. You opened it up and found a note inside of it that read:<br />
<br />
Dear Vortex, <br />
<br />
First off, I apologize for my disappearance from the bed, but I hope that you forgive me as I have gifted with you Janice. Karther tells me that you already know her, and he donated her to me after he got wind of what your role was to be here. Janice if now and forever your servant whether you are pregnant or not. This room here is yours, and you may lounge here for as long as you wish until that fateful day comes to us and you truly experience motherhood. I am honored to share this experience with you as your mate and a father to be, until then enjoy your time and life here, my amethyst beauty, Vortex.<br />
<br />
Love, Master Gared<br />
<br />
You smile as you read the note and smiled then looked up and saw a portrait of your sexy prince, Gared himself hung up on the wall. He posed with one foot up on a bed and one hand stroking his erect cock while he grinned with pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, you’re gonna be a great father Master, I love you.&quot; You said kissing the note then you put it back into the shelf and sighed with content with your life yet again, apart from the annoying migraine that is, but as time passed it seemed to almost naturally calm down to a minor headache, odd.<br />
<br />
Still, you should probably treat this mysterious illness before anything else happens, especially since you had eggs on the way. You wondered how the other girls would react to this, and what would happen once you laid the eggs. You put your hands on your stomach again and felt the warmth of your future children again, and you smiled and wondered,&quot;What should I do now?&quot;</p>
