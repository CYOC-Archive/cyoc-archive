<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wish you&#39;d fucking shut up and just listen to me!&quot; Bill roared, and with a deafening crack of thunder and flash of green-gold light, reality began to warp around Bill.<br />
<br />
Unlike before, where the changes had been instantaneous, silent and the light had covered everything, Bill could see that something was had gone wrong. The light was distorted, more gold than green and was washing across everything like a wave, dragging the changes along behind it in slow motion, though Bill didn&#39;t realize it was simply his The hallway of Bill&#39;s home changed in it&#39;s wake, rapidly expanding outward as the carpeted floor turned to elaborate marble, the walls expanding outwards, the ceiling extending upwards. Massive support columns rose out of the floor, stretching upwards until they reached the now vaulted ceiling while the far wall shifted into floor to ceiling windows. Bill&#39;s gaze slowly turned away from the changing interior of the house right as the wave hit Gloria and Tammy, watching the world beyond the huge windows change as well.<br />
<br />
Where there was once a typical American suburb filled with trees, blue sky and nice houses was now a dark, oppressive environment dominated by the seemingly endless sprawl of buildings, silhouetted by the glow of a setting red sun above a lifeless looking ocean as pollution clouds closed around it. Skyscrapers rose out of the gloom, though few reaching the height at which Bill now apparently stood. In the far distance, almost beyond Bill&#39;s line of sight and shrouded in a heavy downpour, were buildings that were so huge that the term Megastructure entered Bill&#39;s mind as a flash of lightning illuminated only a fraction of the building&#39;s pyramidal design. On the buildings below, vast trenches of lights began to appear as the inhabitants of this new world popped into existence and as massive advertisements appeared for brands that Bill did not recognize.Dots of lights began zipping through the sky, smaller than any plane that Bill knew about. And far off in the distance as the sun disappeared entirely from view, Bill could see a intense, large white flash as something huge rose from the dark surface of the ocean and into the cloudy sky.<br />
<br />
The last vestiges of the golden wave faded beyond the horizon as time began to return to normal speed for Bill, and the sound of strange classical music he did not recognize flowed into his ears. He turned around, and was just as equally shocked to see how luxurious his home had become. The walls were so high up that he had to crane his neck to see the ceiling, from which hung enormous drapes that appeared to be made of fine silk and illuminated from above by what looked to be...free floating lights? Huge fireplaces, separated by the towering support columns ran the length of the huge chamber, now longer than any room he&#39;d ever been in in his life. In front of the massive set of windows a very large and expensive looking desk had appeared on top of a thick rug that looked very old yet still in perfect condition. The desk&#39;s clearly wooden frame had ornate carvings; twin lions...no, sphinxes on either side of what looked to be either large beetle within an ankh, or a extremely artistic styling of a gemstone. The surface of the desk was empty, but a thin line of lights around the perimeter told Bill that this was yet something else out of science fiction. For the moment, Bill felt compelled to leave it alone as he turned to look for Tammy and Gloria.<br />
<br />
He was so caught up in the severe changes to his environment that Bill never felt or realized the changes to his own body finalize as the stone went dead and cold, the crack along the side becoming even larger.<br />
<br />
But to his alarm, all he saw was a clearly mechanical version of Gloria, standing silently at attention, dressed in what was clearly a futuristic version of a maid uniform. The black outfit hugged Gloria&#39;s figure, which was still very clearly female, accentuating her bust, hips and legs. Gloria&#39;s exposed skin was a soft, pearl white, a texture that looked something like flexible plastic. Thin black lines clearly denoted joints and other moving and clearly removable parts, especially around the robo-girl&#39;s face, which was still very clearly that of Gloria Vanapolous but...perfected? As if every minor flaw, inconsistency or assymetricalality had been wiped away. Her arms were tucked behind her back but Bill could see similar joint lines there, as well as across the exposed portions of her legs. Gloria&#39;s eyes blazed a bright, electrical blue as they tracked Bill&#39;s movements.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit Gloria, where are we?&quot; Bill said, looking around once more at their new environment and for Tammy, &quot;What happened to you? Where&#39;s Tammy? Did you see what happened to her?&quot;<br />
<br />
But Gloria gave no answer. The only movement on her body were those eyes that simply stared back at Bill, and though they were emotionless, Bill could fill something behind them. Anger maybe? Fear? Bill wondered why the robotic Vanapolous couldn&#39;t speak before he remembered his wish only moments ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Uh, Gloria, you have my permission to speak!&quot; He said, and breathed a sigh of relief as Gloria&#39;s body seemed to adopt a much more casual pose.<br />
<br />
&quot;GL-OR1A unit #698 is currently experiencing a large amount of sensory feedback. Please wait while it undergoes a momentary maintenance cycle&quot; Gloria&#39;s voice was, outside of being precise and exceedingly formal, unchanged aside from a metallic, electrical hum. To Bill&#39;s surprise, the former human turned artificial life form suddenly went limp, the blue light in her eyes dimming to almost nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gloria!&quot; Bill cried out, placing a hand on the frozen form of his changed...well, he wasn&#39;t sure what Gloria was to him, but he was concerned nonetheless. Even with a shake, her inactive form did not move aside from a slight rattle of plastic and metal components jsotling in their positions. Gloria&#39;s skin was also barely warm. Not cold, but cooler than a human&#39;s and had a texture that made Bill shudder, as if it was like if someone had tried to apply the texture of human skin to the hard plastic of a mannequin.<br />
<br />
Shocked by how...artificial Gloria felt (Bill had known she was a very artificial person but this was a level beyond what even the previous adventures with the Stone had prepared him for), Bill took a step back.<br />
<br />
&quot;TAMMY!&quot; Bill yelled, sprinting away from Gloria&#39;s frozen form as he searched behind a nearby column, darting behind the desk, looking in every nearby nook and cranny that he could reach, &quot;TAMMY, WHERE ARE YOU!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill, in his panic did not notice the flicker of light from far above as small slats slid away from the tops of the support columns and small camera lenses slid outwards. What he did notice was a large ball of multicolored lights appear in front of him and slowly assume human shape. Bill stumbled backwards in surprised, but blinked as the blob of light&#39;s shape become much more defined.<br />
<br />
It was clearly Tammy, the face gave it away. But much like Gloria, so much of Tammy&#39;s body had been...perfected. Gone was the cute chubbiness in her form, the girl next door looks. The casual clothes. The adorable dirty blonde hair. Instead this version of Tammy was thin and fit, her cream colored body wrapped in an almost retro looking white business dress that promoted her large breasts while styled blonde hair cascaded down her exposed back. Her face was stunningly pretty, clearly Tammy if she had been a supermodel, and done up with makeup that only increased her attractiveness. Her dress ended slightly above her knees and showed off the almost unending length of her legs, ending in diamond studded, thick heeled sandals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please hold while your Tailored Autonomous Multitasking Intelligence exits hibernation. While you wait, did you know that this model is the latest in customizable holographic assistants from AhnCorp? AhnCorp, bringing the future, today!&quot; Tammy&#39;s face did not move from the soft smile it was in, but her voice seemed to come from the barely see-through hologram that made up her body. Her voice sounded the same, but far more upbeat and chipper, almost like a commercial, and Bill had to struggle to pull his jaw closed as the hologram of his best friend turned wife turned girlfriend turned hologram blinked and began to move naturally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap, what happened!? Where are we? Who are you!?&quot; Tammy cried out, her disembodied voice taking on a much more recognizable tone as her photonic body began spinning around, taking in the changed environment and herself before pointing a flickering finger at Bill, who blinked in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tammy, it&#39;s me, Bill!&quot; He said, but Tammy merely shook her head in denial.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Bill doesn&#39;t look like that, he isn&#39;t a...&quot;</p>
