<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kara’s eyes opened as she sat up in bed, her head leaving Milo’s chest as she blinked for a few seconds. <br />
<br />
This wasn’t their bedroom and then she remembered where they were. They were in the process of becoming merpeople and had sold their apartment, their car and almost everything else to buy a private transformation and then a room in a shared house under the sea. <br />
The room was dark but she knew it was the middle of the night, thanks to a digital clock on the wall. She was about to lay her head back down when she remembered why she had woken up.<br />
<br />
Her bladder was full. <br />
<br />
There were no blankets on this stupid bed as she stepped up from where it was sunken into the floor. She was halfway to the bathroom when she remembered she wasn’t even sure if she had legs when she had gotten up, but the fact that she was walking proved that.<br />
She walked into the bathroom and turned on the lights as her eyes instantly widened. <br />
<br />
Her body had changed, her hair was still the metallic silver color it had become when she had woken up from the hot tube. Her right leg was still covered with scales while her left leg was still totally human. The scales had filled in slightly, with more blue scales coming in among the white and silver. <br />
<br />
It was her face and upper body that had totally changed. <br />
<br />
All the faults and blemishes in her skin had totally disappeared, her now blue eyes seemed larger. Her neck was longer and more elegant. She reached up to touch her face not fully believing what she was seeing only to notice that her fingernails had turned into a royal blue color. She turned her head a bit to notice that her ears had become pointed almost like an elf. <br />
<br />
Around her collar bones were a couple patches of scales which were blue in color like her nails but they where small scales, not even the same size as the scales on her legs. <br />
<br />
Her eyes widened at her chest; she had been lucky to be graced with a B cup size but now she had a solid C size breasts which were super perky. Her core was super strong looking yet very feminine. She ran her hands down the sides to her hips. That is when she noticed that on her left hip the opposite side where her scales had already grown in a thin membrane was beginning to grow. It reminded her of the stereo typical barrier one would see on Hollywood cartoon mermaids between where a human flesh ended and where the tail began. <br />
She as breathtaking beautiful in a way she had never imagined possible. She raised her hands above her head, resting them on top of her head and stretched so that she could see everything she had become at once. A huge smile was across her face as she looked at herself.<br />
<br />
Then she remembered Milo.<br />
<br />
If she had changed, then there was possible that the love of her life was now a women sound asleep still in the other room. In fact the odds where 50/50 because half of the men infected with the mermaid virus became mermaids. Younger kids generally stayed the same gender, those under 21 for the most part but they where not free from the change either.<br />
<br />
“No matter, what he or she is the person I love.” Stated Kara as she decided how she was going to move forward. After doing what she came to the bathroom to do, she turned off the light and headed back into the bedroom.<br />
<br />
She moved softly not to lay down beside Milo but instead with her legs on either side of him. In the dark it was impossible to make out any real shapes, but she ran her hand up from where his calf would be, following the scales until she reached the spot where his dick should have been. It had become internal overnight.<br />
<br />
All merman’s dicks were internal and according to Lindsey, the mermaid they had dinner with the way to tell a mermaid from a merman by their tail was the slit. A straight vertical slit, then Milo had become a mermaid, a Y shape then he was a merman. <br />
<br />
She could have ran her hand up and felt the edge to know for sure but she wanted to show Milo she loved him no matter if he was a merman or a mermaid. So instead, she lowered her head down and began to lick his opening with her tongue. <br />
<br />
When Milo and Aaron, the merman they had dinner with last night had gone to the rest room Lindsay had told her how to give a merman a blow job. While licking the opening would normally be how to pleasure a woman, since a merman’s dick was internal it was now the same process. <br />
<br />
She heard Milo begin to stir as she kept pleasuring him. If a dick came out then she would start a more traditional blow job and she would know Milo was still a man, if not then she would keep going knowing that he was now a mermaid. <br />
<br />
Either way, she would love him…or her, no matter what and soon she would know the answer.</p>
