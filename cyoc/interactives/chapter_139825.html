<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle grinned as he played with his naked jock dog boy Chad.   He should have done this ages ago.  He rolled around with his naked Chad.  Finally, Kyle&#39;s watch buzzed.   He stopped playing with Chad, and put him a headlock.  He scratched Chad&#39;s head and behind his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Chad boy, that&#39;s enough dog time.  You gotta spend the next couple hours walking on two legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad looked confused as Kyle helped him up on his hind legs.  Kyle hooked his finger under Chad&#39;s dog collar, and led him back into the house.  Chad stumbled a bit, as he re-learned how to walk on two legs. <br />
<br />
Kyle struggled to get Chad&#39;s jeans buckled. He then tried to put Chad&#39;s tee shirt over his head while Chad chewed on his own sneaker.  At last Kyle gave up, and grabbed his tablet.  He made a few slight adjustments,  Chad frowned at the sneaker in his mouth.  He pulled the shoe out of his mouth, and pulled his t-shirt over his head.   He looked at the shoe, and over at Master Kyle.   Then Chad put the shoe on his barefoot.  Chad sniffed.  He still had the sense of smell of dog.  He still had monochrome vision.  He remembered enough humanity that he was able to dress himself.  He knew how to speak, and walk, but he still belonged body and soul to his master.  He loved his owner Kyle.  He remembered enough that he knew he shouldn&#39;t, but as he sniffed the air, the fireworks of orangish pink told him he belonged to Kyle.  He wanted to give himself totally to Kyle. <br />
<br />
Kyle grinned and dressed himself.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Chaddy, ready to introduce me to your folks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woo- uh- yes, mas-tuh,&quot; Chad answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad dog, you can&#39;t call me master in front of your parents,&quot; Kyle ordered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Chad said apologetically.<br />
<br />
Kyle rolled his eyes, &quot;Oh, Chad?  What am I going to do with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck my ass really hard?&quot; Chad asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
Kyle laughed.  &quot;Probably, but you cannot talk like that around your family,&quot; he sighed, and played with his tablet a bit more. <br />
<br />
Chad blinked, and frowned, &quot;Oh, alright, Kyle, I&#39;ll behave, but you have to promise to make me your doggy, as soon as we are alone.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle grinned, and tousled Chad&#39;s head.  &quot;Good boy, you can count on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sitting in Kyle&#39;s convertible, Chad stood up to feel the air blowing against his face and chest.<br />
<br />
Kyle pulled down on the leash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit boy,&quot; Kyle ordered, as he pulled over, and buckled Chad in his seatbelt, &quot;Stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad growled softly.<br />
<br />
Kyle grinned. <br />
<br />
When he pulled up in front of Chad&#39;s parents&#39; home. Chad squirmed around in his seat, but he had to stay.  His master ordered him to stay. <br />
<br />
Kyle was halfway up the walk, when he realized Chad&#39;s problem.  He snickered.  He turned around, and trotted back to the car. He reached in the car, and unbuckled Chad&#39;s belt.  His hand brushed Chad&#39;s tented crotch as he unbuckled the belt.  He frowned, and took out his tablet again.  He watched as Chad&#39;s boner shrank away.  Oh, Chad was still hard, but at its current size, his dick would be more appropriate on an infant than on any man.  Still he&#39;d be hard, even if only Kyle and Chad knew.  Kyle was glad he wore a jockstrap.  He was getting hard just thinking about Chad&#39;s baby cock - not that he&#39;d ever be using it again.  Kyle chuckled, then he tugged on the leash, and told Chad to, &quot;Come, boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Kyle led Chad up his own front steps, and looked at his puppy slave, and sighed.  Chad&#39;s tongue was hanging out again.  Kyle tucked the leash under Chad&#39;s shirt, and pulled the leash down below Chad&#39;s waist.  He then took the bit of leash hanging down, and shoved it down the front of Chad&#39;s jeans, and twisted it around Chad&#39;s man-size nuts.  Kyle giggled.  He tapped his tablet a couple more times, and Chad blinked.  His right hand formed a fist, but then he relaxed the fist.  He sighed.  <br />
<br />
Kyle rang the doorbell.<br />
<br />
A minute later, Chad&#39;s mother opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Chad, and you must be Kyle.  Come in, come in.&quot;  She ushered them into the basement family room.  Chad&#39;s father and older and younger brothers were watching ESPN.  Introductions were made, and then Chad&#39;s mother said that dinner would be ready in 5 minutes and that everyone should wash up.<br />
<br />
Kyle let Chad&#39;s father and brothers go first. Then he and Chad stepped up to the sink. Chad closed the door, and immediately began licking both their hands.<br />
<br />
&#39;Wai-wai-what?&quot; Kyle asked.  Then he realized he had typed that Chad would resume doggy mode when they were alone.  &quot;Down boy, Chad.&quot;  Kyle typed on the tablet, and Chad stopped licking and wiped his mouth with the back of his wrist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Kyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound too thankful, Chad?&quot; Kyle commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Kyle.&quot;  This time Chad sounded penitent.  Kyle smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s better.  Now wash up with soap and water, this time.&quot;  He made sure that Chad would use silverware when they ate.<br />
<br />
Soon they were seated at the dining room table.  Kyle had a good time chatting with Chad and his family like old friends.  Soon they&#39;d be up in Chad&#39;s room, and Chad would be his doggy boy again.  After dinner, Chad&#39;s father insisted that they adjourn to the family room.  It wasn&#39;t too bad, fortunately the basketball game didn&#39;t run into overtime.  Kyle spent the last 10 minutes of the game typing Chad&#39;s new programming.  It would take effect 5 minutes after they were alone in Chad&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure you don&#39;t want to stay for the after game show?&quot; younger brother Tad asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or maybe pump some iron?&quot; suggested Brad, the older brother, as he straddled a weight bench in a corner.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to study,&quot; lied Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could stand a little more muscle,&quot; said Brad, &quot;Make Chad train you in exchange for your tutoring him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad, how do you feel?&quot; Kyle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;About the same,&quot; Chad said uncertainly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you still have a few minutes of humanity remaining.  How about you show me around your room before you become my fuck toy again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad swallowed with a loud gulp.  He proceeded to give a quick tour of his room starting with his trophies, photos, and &quot;captured&quot; wrestling singlets.</p>
