<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John sighed and said &quot;I can&#39;t run from this... Never going to touch alcohol again...&quot; <br />
Cindy asked &quot;I get the no alcohol thing but run away? What are you talking about?&quot; <br />
John said &quot;I was contemplating whether or not I should time travel and stop me from drinking that punch.&quot;<br />
Kathy said &quot;That actually sound like a good idea.&quot; <br />
John shook her head and said &quot;No I can&#39;t... or shouldn&#39;t. If i start now I&#39;ll just keep doing it for smaller and smaller things... It&#39;ll be better if I just take responsibility for my actions. Speaking of which I should&#39;ve done this sooner.&quot; Looking at the Older Dolly, the young Cindy, and even younger Kathy John let loose some of her magic and watched them pro and regress to their rightful ages. <br />
Kathy, the only one passing the puberty barrier, complained &quot;Hey, give us some warning first. Although it&#39;s nice being back to normal.&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;Speak for yourself, after being so young for awhile aging this far really starts to make you feel your age. Although that was a mature decision Jane. I&#39;ll see how I can help you tomorrow at school with everything.&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;Wait... so now I have to eat the kid&#39;s meal as a young woman? The portions are way too small for that!&quot; <br />
<br />
Having cleaned up a few things around town the next day at school John met with his friends Kathy, Kyo, and Martha. <br />
Martha said &quot;I can&#39;t believe you left me as some middle-aged lady the whole weekend!&quot; <br />
John apologized and said &quot;It was a complete never ending wave of weirdness that I couldn&#39;t get away from. Here let me fix you.&quot; and saw Martha deflate back into her normal age. <br />
Martha took a breath as the years melted away from her and said &quot;Thanks... Silver lining it feels so refreshing taking a decade or two off your shoulders. <br />
Kathy giggled and said &quot;You sounded just like Ms. Mavis Martha.&quot; <br />
&quot;Jane! It&#39;s a Miracle!&quot; a familiar voice cried out. Jane took a quick look and saw a much healthier Silky running her way. Silky blurted out &quot;Amaterasu wanted me to see the world more so she Cured me! I&#39;ll be able to go to school now!&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Wait did you just enroll at our school?&quot; <br />
Silky said &quot;I just came to do some paperwork... but aren&#39;t you going to introduce me?&quot; Right John may have referred to Silky to her friends in the past, but they never really went to the Shrine or met her. So John went and introduced Silky to her friends in as much detail as she could before the school bell rang. <br />
<br />
In her first class Principal Abet got her out of class for a meeting. In her office was Principal Abet and Silky. Jane knocked on the door and was invited in as Abet finished something with Silky something about working something out with homeschooling credits. <br />
John said &quot;Sorry if I&#39;m interrupting.&quot; <br />
Abet looked stressed and said &quot;Never mind, we don&#39;t have a lot of time a-&quot; Something in her eyes sparked with fear at her choice of words and said &quot;Do Not Make More or destroy reality!&quot; <br />
Silky was a little confused and asked &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; knowing that John had gotten drunk and did some weird things but... what exactly did she do?<br />
John said &quot;After I had that glass of punch I apparently went on more of a rampage than I had originally thought.&quot;<br />
Abet said &quot;Jane, It was on international news. The only reason it wasn&#39;t as widespread as it should&#39;ve been was because of all the nudity and sexual content involved.&quot; <br />
John said &quot;So... it&#39;s going to be more than just going around school and turning everyone back to normal and owing all sorts of favors and good deeds.&quot; <br />
Abet said &quot;Apparently there&#39;s a cult forming. While we do need to get everyone back to normal... You can&#39;t really undo this type of event. Let&#39;s see on this list... the first two that you will need to help will be Victoria and Nessa. Sorry for keeping you Silky you&#39;re free to-&quot; <br />
Silky said &quot;No, please let me help with Vicky, from what John&#39;s told me I think I could help her spiritual state.&quot; <br />
Abet looked like she wanted to something but was holding her tongue for a moment and then said &quot;Fine.&quot; then pressed a button and spoke into a microphone &quot;Victoria and Nessa please come to the Principal&#39;s Office it is your turn.&quot; A few minutes later a red headed Tween entered the door holding the hand of a much smaller girl. <br />
Nessa was coaxing Vicki saying &quot;Come on... don&#39;t worry... no one&#39;s mad at you are going to hurt you...&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Alright, time for you two to grow up first.&quot; letting loose her magic Nessa was thankful for her growing back to normal... <br />
Victoria was confused the scared child very unsure what was going on asked &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?!?&quot;<br />
Nessa said &#39;You&#39;re growing up Vic.&quot; <br />
Victoria said &quot;but... I don&#39;t want to...&quot; Interestingly enough while Nessa was back in her normal clothes Victoria was in her uniform and... they were intact. <br />
Silky said &quot;...Yeah I think my theory was correct... A little adjustment and...&quot; Victoria&#39;s face started to shift and Silky continued &quot;There feeling more like yourself?&quot;<br />
Vicki&#39;s fist clenched and she said &quot;Put her back...&quot; <br />
Silky confused asked &quot;Um... what did you-&quot; <br />
&quot;PUT LITTLE TORI BACK!!!&quot; Vicki yelled a breathe later she said &quot;She deserves... control more than I do.&quot; Nessa, John, and Silky were confused and Lauren Abet was completely lost and debating whether or not she would be justified in taking out a bottle of scotch. <br />
Silky said &quot;But That&#39;s Crazy! She isn&#39;t even-&quot; <br />
Vicki said &quot;It ain&#39;t, little Tori is so sweet and caring and even understands that complex stuff like Arigatoo or whatever... If anyone has to be some sort of subconscious or something better me than her.&quot;<br />
Nessa said &quot;I sorta get what you mean... in a way... but we really shoul-&quot; <br />
Principal Abet said &quot;Before things get out of hand how about... Silky, Nessa, and Vicki get out of my office and talk things out. Today&#39;s a long day and we&#39;re trying to fix weird god stuff not create more weird god stuff.&quot; <br />
Vicki grinned viciously and said &quot;Sure, Nessa how about we show the new girl the view of the roof?&quot; <br />
Abet was seriously debating that glass of scotch and said &quot;I&#39;m just going to pretend I didn&#39;t hear the word roof right now... just remember she is a priestess with weird unexplained god powers.&quot; Vicki hooked one of Silky&#39;s arms into her own with a secure grip, and Nessa followed hooking her arm with Silky&#39;s other and kinda lifted and dragged Silky out of Abet&#39;s office. Abet sighed and said &quot;Well time is of the essence, I&#39;m sure she has to have some sort of divine protection so...&quot; Several hours, one or two bathroom breaks, and a light lunch later Abet was actually happy. &quot;Wow, I can&#39;t believe we actually covered everyone in the student body and staff!&quot; <br />
John sighed and said &quot;Not sure what I believe less. Drunk me figuring out how to turn Chad into a little girl with only time power... or that I somehow figured out how to undo it.&quot; There was a knock on the door and Abet signaled for them to open. It was Cindy who was at the door asking if they were finished. <br />
Johns mother said &quot;So between classes I was checking some newsfeeds. Since Jane only ever called herself Chronos&#39; Priestess and only ever wore casual clothes or... nothing... no one&#39;s completely sure who she actually is... the media is looking everywhere, but since they don&#39;t really know who Jane is... We can just go home.&quot; <br />
Abet says &quot;Sounds great... And I hope you&#39;re telling the truth about the whole sleeping thing.&quot; <br />
John put together a dot or two and said &quot;Wait will Principal Abet be coming home with us?&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;You put a ton on her plate Jane. I told her how refreshing sleeping as a child was and I thought it would be nice to offer something similar.&quot; <br />
John sighed and said &quot;Sure, least I owe anyone.&quot; Abet looked to the place her secret Scotch and debated whether or not she should drink... or... John seeing the weariness in Abet&#39;s eyes said &quot;Well there&#39;s no reason you need to stay an adult now right?&quot; and The middle-aged adult shrank down to the small tot. <br />
Cindy said &quot;I&#39;m not carrying you.&quot; <br />
John seeing Abet still tired decided to lean down and allow her to climb onto John&#39;s back for a small ride... That night was relatively normal. <br />
<br />
Eventually the days grew crazier and crazier for John, but being careful her family was spared the media&#39;s wrath. John&#39;s friends ended up doing alright in the following chaotic days, having a friend with time manipulation was a nice perk. Silky ended up having Nessa and Vicki as light body guards of sorts. More there to intimidate some people from approaching, but When little Tori&#39;s personality was out that intimidation was severely lessened. People quickly put together that two Priestesses were at Abet&#39;s school... With some weird mix of game theory and other complex decisions a lot of priestesses ended up popping up near Abet&#39;s school. When new laws were drafted Abet resigned from her principal position and instead became a consultant from originally being able to organize these super powerful beings... And then there was John. <br />
<br />
In the middle of a city John sighed and said &quot;Alright... The last of the Chronos Cultists were converted to legit worshipers...&quot; <br />
Chronos whispered into John&#39;s ear &quot;Great, Now let&#39;s start on converting the Cthulhu cultists.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright, alright... A bunch of them were at that arcade right?&quot; John sighed and said &quot;Say chronos, between my priestess work, school, and general responsibilities I don&#39;t have time to sleep. Can we discuss hours?&quot; <br />
&quot;Sure, if you want more hours just freeze time and do whatever you want. In actual time your my only Priestess until I can make more. However if you really want to stop you can always have a child an-&quot;<br />
John sighed and said &quot;Alright! But when you get more Priestesses I&#39;ll need to have some actual me time.&quot; <br />
&quot;Less chatting more converting.&quot; <br />
&quot;...yes... Lord Chronos...&quot;</p>
