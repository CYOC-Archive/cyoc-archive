<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Abby stared at her new appendage, horrified at what was happening to her. Wanting to wake up from the nightmare she had suddenly found herself in, Abby turned and slowly exited the spare room that her aunt had been occupying for the last couple of days.<br />
<br />
As if walking in a trance, Abby returned to her room. Inside, she stood in front of the mirror, looking at the purple skinned girl before her. After a bit, she began to undress, discarding the clothes she had carefully chosen to wear that day. Standing naked once again in front of the mirror, watching her tail twitch back and forth, Abby eventually turned and ambled back to her bed.<br />
<br />
Wanting everything to be over, she searched first under her pillow and then under her bed for the note. Unable to find the piece of paper, the feeling of wanting to cry and go running to her mommy overwhelming her, she instead laid down on the bed and curling up beneath the covers, she cried herself back to sleep.<br />
<br />
She wasn't sure how long she slept, but when she did wake Abby found that it was to the fact that she had wet the bed. Embarrassed, she attempted to move, but found that for some reason her body refused to cooperate.<br />
<br />
Scared, she began to roll about until she finally was able to lay flat on her stomach. Exhausted, she lay like this for a moment, wanting to go back to sleep, but uncomfortable because of how wet she felt. After a bit, she pushed herself up, with some difficulty, and as she began to crawl forward, something new came to her attention.<br />
<br />
As Abby slowly crawled forward, unable to fully bring herself to a standing position, it slowly dawned upon her that her bed looked different. And the more she looked about, the more she realised that what she was looking at, was in fact a crib.<br />
<br />
Scared, wondering what the heck was going on, she paused as a voice above her suddenly said, &quot;Is my little Abby awake? Yes she is! Yes she is!&quot; and then Abby found herself being picked up and the voice, which she realised was her mother's, exclaimed, &quot;And she had made a bit of a mess. No wonder she was fussing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Around her, the room shifted, and Abby had a brief glimpse of the mirror. And reflected from within, she saw a round, purple girl of about one year old.<br />
<br />
But what really caught Abby's attention, and distracted her while her mother changed the diaper and outfit she suddenly found herself to be wearing, was the odd fact that her ears looked more equine and were perched on top of her head. And while she dwelt on this fact, she also thought on how strange her face also looked.<br />
<br />
As her mother finished, it dawned upon the not infant Abby that the reason her face looked strange was because her nose and mouth had fused together into a snout.<br />
-------<br />
<br />
Aimee, meanwhile, was puzzling over her own problems. After she had gotten dressed, she had headed for the living room to watch the telly. As she sat there, engrossed by the programme, it slowly began to dawn upon her that she was not who she thought she was.<br />
<br />
And as this strange feeling increased, the sensation of what felt like a veil lifting, shedding information onto her that she was actually, for some reason, really a boy.<br />
<br />
Confused by this train of thought, Aimee had switched off the telly and sat looking at the blank screen. After bit, she rose and headed for the bathroom. Inside, she shut the door and immediately shucked off her clothes.<br />
<br />
Standing nude, Aimee climbed atop the sink and peering into the mirror, she took in the eight year old girl appearance that was reflecting back.<br />
<br />
Looking down, she gingerly touched what she thought of as her girl parts and the asked herself, &quot;Why do I suddenly think of myself as a boy? I look like a girl and I have the girl parts rather than icky boy parts. So why do I think this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure, she slid off the sink and redressing herself, she exited the bathroom, intent on going to her room.<br />
<br />
Halfway there, she was stopped by her mommy, who told her, &quot;I just put your sister down for a nap. So if you are going to play in your room, please do so quietly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, Aimee told her, &quot;Yes mommy,&quot; and continued to the room she shared with her sister.<br />
<br />
Inside, she paused. As she stood in the doorway, she tried to come up with a reasoning as to why she, a four year old girl, would think of herself as a boy. Unable to come up with an answer, Aimee entered and sitting down at her plastic tea table, she picked up her favourite plush animal - a ten inch Angelina Ballerina doll - and cradling it in a motherly fashion, she looked at her sister.<br />
<br />
As she watched her baby sister sleeping, Aimee had a notion that something about the way she felt had something to do with Abby. And as she watched her sister sleep, she saw something interesting happening.<br />
<br />
Before Aimee's young eyes, Abby's hair began to slowly regress backward until the purple skin on her head was completely exposed. As this occurred, the ears of the young girl began to stretch outward until they looked, from Aimee's perspective, like those of a horse.<br />
<br />
Curious, Aimee wanted to wake her sister and tell her what was happening. And then she remembered how her mother had told her how all infants and babies need their sleep.<br />
<br />
Deciding it could wait, Aimee felt her mind slip and the notion that she had ever been a boy once again vanished. Standing, Aimee turned and skipped out of the room and toward the kitchen, where she knew her mother was.<br />
<br />
As she exited, she missed the next change as her sister's bed slowly elongated and stretched upward until it had become a crib. And had she stayed a bit longer, she would have seen her sister's face slowly pushing outward into a snout. But all this wasn't important to Aimee. What was, was asking her mother if she could either go outside to play or go over to Tanya's place to play.</p>
