<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty had walked for nearly an hour, and in that time he had learned to appreciate just how vital his monk skills were becoming.  As he walked he had tried to remember the skills a monk should have in game, and found much to his delight that he had the incredibly useful ability to clear mind, allowing him to suppress, at least for a time, his more baser instincts.  This was excellent considering he now had seven genitals to worry about, and the constant jumbling about of the heavy cocks on his chest, bound as they were with his flimsy cloth wrap, had begun to engorge to unwieldy proportions until he found the inner peace to calm himself down.<br />
<br />
As he walked, his ears picked up something in the distance.  Voices!  Quiet at first, but louder as he careful drew closer, he could make out the high pitched chitter of excited cries and laughing.  Through the dense foliage he could see a soft glow just several yards away.  A multitude of bright colors illuminated a patch of the woods and Ty knew he had to have found the right place. <br />
<br />
As carefully as he could, and it was very careful indeed given his natural dexterity, Ty snuck closer and closer to the glowing lights.  Using the brush as cover, Ty eventually reached the edge of a clearing, and within was without a doubt the hideout of the faeries that had stolen his face, among other things.  Faeries frolicked and flew around the area, light up as it was by strange crystals that had been tied to the tree.  All around the clearing were scattered treasures the fey creatures had stolen; gold, jewelry, someone’s cat, but more importantly, there were dozens of random body parts, all of them still alive and moving about frantically as the faeries toyed with them.  Arms, legs, butts, genitals and even some full faces just like Ty’s were strewn about the area, playthings for the mischievous vandals.  <br />
<br />
A sight made the cocks replacing Ty’s eyes twitch with excitement.  Several faeries were parading something around, waving it to and fro, giggling that it was their latest acquisition.  It was Ty’s tiefling face, eyes open but unfocused, mouth hanging slack without will to control it.  The thieves had taken to vandalizing it, writing vulgar messages and drawing cocks and pussies  the forehead in some kind of ink.  Worse of all, some little blue trickster had a huge green penis that they were humorously thrusting in and out of his face’s slack mouth.<br />
<br />
Ty couldn&#39;t take it anymore, and taking in a deep breath through his facial anus to calm himself, he felt his monk skills overtaking him, increasing his awareness and reflexes to the point of mastery.  He would not be defeated again.<br />
<br />
Ty burst out of the bushes without a sound, catching the faeries off guard as he began to systematically swat and bash each of the little monsters into unconsciousness.  They fell in droves as Ty sped over to the group handling his face.  By the time they had even realized what had happened, a barrage of fists had been driven with such force into each tiny face that they were sent flying far away into the woods.  Quickly, Ty picked up his face and threw away the foul orc cock that had been lodged there.  Lifting it to his shirt, he carefully rubbed off the ink, berries he figured, from his face and held it up to his be-genitaled head.  For a moment he paused, and realized he had no idea how to reattach it.  From behind him, a voice cried out.<br />
<br />
“Hey!  You’re not very nice miss!  We just wanted to play, not fight!,” said a faerie behind him, small and bright pink.  She had her arms crossed and was pouting.  “Take your stupid face back, we’re bored with it anyway.”  Then, just a second faster than Ty could move to strike, she snapped her fingers and the world went… bright pink.  <br />
<br />
Ty awoke with a start, his vision black, his mouth and nose pushed uncomfortably against something hot and musky.  He was laying prone on the ground, but seemed otherwise unharmed.  Ty coughed and felt a breath on his balls.  His lower ones to be precise.  Reaching down into his clothing, he fumbled around his groin until he felt something flapping about around his nutsack, and winced when something poked him in the eye.  He gasped in pain and felt that same breath again.  Finding a smooth fold of the thing, he pulled it out of his pants and suddenly his vision had returned.  Ty felt his stomach fill with butterfly’s as he saw himself from a whole new vantage point, an arm reaching up to his forehead, and his genital covered head facing him from several feet away.  He shook the hand holding the thing, and his vision likewise shook, making him nauseous.  He set the thing down on the ground as his stomach settled, his vision staring straight up into the morning sky.  <br />
<br />
Ty felt around on the ground and saw his arm almost hit his detached face, for what else could it be?  The hand grabbed his cheek gently and lifted his face up, then turned it to face the multitude of genitals on his head.  Hoping against all hope, he turned his face around and using both hands, pressed his face against the cocks and pussy that crowded his head, like he was applying a mask.  He felt his face deform as the dicks pressed behind his eyes and his mouth slid past to feel his facial cunt rub against the back of his face.  He pressed harder, then let go.  Unfortunately, all that got his face was a one way trip to between his cock-cleavage and once more muffled by testicles.  Ty sighed and withdrew his face, knowing that his journey to return to some semblance of normal was nowhere near over, and that the faeires would be of no help to him now. <br />
<br />
Standing up, he picked his face out of his shirt and brushed off some rogue pubes.  Looking around, he found that almost everything had been emptied out of the faeries hiding spot.  Luckily, if you could call it that, he found some ribbon that had been cast aside.  Using it, he tied his face to his stomach, wrapping it carefully so the cloth only barely revealed his eyes.  He did the same with his head, wrapping it carefully and only just leaving a slit where his eyes should be to give the impression of having them.  Looking around was difficult as he could no longer turn his head and had to turn his whole body around.  He spotted what seemed to be a path out of the forest and began walking…<br />
<br />
After several hours, Ty finally escaped the forest and found he had excited into a well marked and cared for road…</p>
