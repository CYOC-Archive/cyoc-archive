<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John moaned in pleasure as Lolita sucked his shaft with a skill that was nearly superhuman, and he wondered if her skill came from practice, or if it was due to her being written and drawn that way. But honestly, he didn&#39;t really care; it was just a fleeting thought. She pushed him backward slightly, keeping her changing hands on his inner thighs; it tickled as her fur grew on her forearms and brushed against his sensitive skin.<br />
<br />
She paused for a moment to smile at him as her muzzle started to stretch. Her long ears pushed through her hair, and the tip of her nose turned black and leathery. Her tongue hung out of her mouth, long enough to wrap around his dick without her ever putting it into her mouth at all, and she took a long lick, sending him to a new plane of ecstasy.<br />
<br />
He looked over and saw his shewolf wife watching them intently, playing with herself harder and harder. She made eye contact with him and prowled over on all fours, licking his left ankle and up his leg as Lolita dove back on him, deepthroating him easily, taking his balls into her mouth now. Carrie continued to lick up his body, lifting his shirt and covering his chest in a mix of wolfish kisses and primal licks. <br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Carrie was on fire with a lust she&#39;d never felt before. She&#39;d had crushes, infatuations, and of course, felt love. She&#39;d felt everything from puppy love to lust. But this was something beyond it all. It was a boiling need not just to fuck, but to fuck until she could fuck no more. She wanted John more and more, even though they&#39;d just had sex, and she wanted him to turn into a werewolf like her. She wanted him to fuck her and claim her again. She knew they were married; being turned hadn&#39;t made her forget a thing in that regard. She was still fully in control of her mental faculties, albeit driven by instincts she hadn&#39;t had until a few minutes earlier. <br />
<br />
She climbed onto the arm of the chair, licking his neck and nibbling his ear softly. She turned his head for a wolfish kiss, and inwardly thrilled as one hand grasped the back of her neck, loving her mate&#39;s touch. John gasped as he neared orgasm from the now fully changed Lolita, letting out a wordless noise of overwhelmed pleasure. “Let her do it, John,” Carrie growled as she nuzzled his neck.<br />
<br />
John moaned again and stammered, “Lolita..I..I want you to..” It was almost impossible for him to get the words out.<br />
<br />
“Please, love..let her do it..” Carrie begged, reaching a paw between her legs and playing with herself, maddeningly wet at the mere thought of him becoming a werewolf like her. She let out another wolfish moan, nuzzling him harder.<br />
<br />
John was on the verge of cumming and reached out with one hand to grasp the scruff of Lolita&#39;s neck. “Do it, change me, Lolita!” John yelled, pushing her head down hard. He winced as he felt the pinch of her fangs penetrating the skin on his balls. It was a practiced move, a simple nip at the seam just on the underside, where there was no danger of biting anything more than skin. He blasted his seed into her muzzle as he arched his back in overwhelmed ecstasy as his eyes rolled back into his head, and then he collapsed back into the chair, feeling completely spent and weak. “Oh..oh shit..” he said weakly, as Carrie climbed up onto him, kissing him happily.<br />
<br />
Both girls reverted once more as their hormone levels lowered enough for their human sides to reassert themselves. Carrie kept herself on his lap, smiling contentedly and staring at him in total adoration.<br />
“Thank you, Johnny boy,” Lolita said softly. <br />
<br />
Carrie let out a low whistle, grinning in anticipation, only for nothing to happen. She did it again, and Lolita shook her head.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ve changed so much in a short period of time,” she told Carrie, “that my body can&#39;t do it for awhile.”<br />
<br />
“But shouldn&#39;t he be changing? Or me?” Carrie asked, sounding mildly annoyed. “I only changed the once, and he hasn&#39;t EVER changed.” She was pouting slightly, a facial expression that John found adorable, not that he&#39;d ever admit it unless he wanted a fight.<br />
<br />
Lolita shook her head. “You can&#39;t make yourself change by whistling, or else most of us would be in a constant state of sexual arousal and transformation.”<br />
<br />
“But what about HIM, then?” Carrie was definitely annoyed. She wanted to let the wolf loose for them both, and be claimed once more by her mate.<br />
<br />
“When Johnny was drawing the comics, male werewolves only changed when female werewolves changed.  The whistle didn&#39;t do it for them. But seeing a she-wolf, or seeing one of us change made them lose control the same way.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Carrie said. “I mean, it makes sense, in a way, I guess..” Carrie said, “Since a wolf-whistle is the sound a horny guy might make in a cartoon, and girls don&#39;t normally do that.” She looked up at John, still with her head on his chest, “And it&#39;s a great metaphor for a beautiful woman making a man lose control of himself.”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t think Johnny boy was making a psychological dissertation, sweetie,” Lolita said with a wry smile.</p>
