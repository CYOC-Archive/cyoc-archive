<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John, Jeff&#39;s father, was a great man, and Shannon loved him dearly, but as any wife does, she had counted and categorized all his flaws and shortcomings over the years, not that they would ever cross her lips. No, they were stuffed away into the &quot;deal with it/can&#39;t win them all&quot; part of her brain, and it served her well. Many things she could easily work around and she has been able to make a wonderful life and family because of it.<br />
<br />
To put it simply, John was risk averse... he has a stable job making decent money, enough to provide for his family, but never looking for something better. Trying something new, be it a new restaurant or way to get to or from work just isn&#39;t something he thinks of doing. If John had his way they would take a stay-cation every year visiting the movie theater and enjoying the local restaurants and attractions.<br />
<br />
Shannon wished her partner was a lot more spontaneous but just as kind, committed, loving, good of a father, and provider. There were other things too, of course, if given the option and thankfully the Chronivac knew them all.<br />
<br />
Jeff was at the trunk suddenly overcome with a pleasurable and relaxing sensation which started at his groin and radiated out. His testicles doubled in volume hanging lower and his scrotum enlarged to accommodate. His penis grew 3 inches longer and thicker, and the modest amount of pubic hair erupted making his genitals well endowed and fully mature. His whitie tighties shifted to boxer briefs as this happened keeping Jeff from realizing anything significant had happened aside from the momentary feeling of bliss.<br />
<br />
Grabbing the next couple bags he brought them in and didn&#39;t realize as he set them down that although his arms relaxed the muscles stayed the same overall size. &quot;Thank you sweetie, I didn&#39;t mean to yell.&quot; Shannon apologized as her concept of Jeff began to shift from subordinate to equal.<br />
<br />
&quot;I forgive you of course, and you were right, I was being a little selfish.&quot; Jeff responded confused by his phrasing. Normally he would have dismissed it with an &quot;It&#39;s fine.&quot; and he never thought of himself as being selfish before, let alone admitted it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you sweetheart, now back to work!&quot; Shannon said emphatically with a playfulness that seemed a little exciting somehow. &quot;As you wish&quot; Jeff replied in a deep whisper as he turned back to the garage. Jeff thought for a second realizing he was quoting The Princess Bride but not remembering when he saw it or understanding why he would quote the suitor rather than  saying something like &quot;Ma&#39;am yes Ma&#39;am!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jeff ducked under the raised trunk door, not realizing that he was now taller than he ever would have been, his clothes shifted keeping his changes out of his awareness but Jeff did appreciate that he was able to reach the case of pop and gallon of milk which slid toward the front of the vehicle.<br />
<br />
He made another trip in and back out. By now he was beginning to age and his face had shifted dramatically to where he could easily be the male lead in an action/romance movie. A sleeve tattoo appeared on his very muscular arm and a stubble beard had appeared on his face. New memories appropriate for a 25 year old were bubbling up as his former reality became more distant and dreamlike in his mind. Upstairs, his and his mother&#39;s rooms were warping as drastically as his body, John&#39;s presence and effect on the house was fading away as Jeff&#39;s grew.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked in the trunk seeing the beer Shannon got for him and smiled, happiness is made up of so many small things. Jeff grabbed the beer and a bag full of cereal making his way back in and out. <br />
<br />
Jeff was now in the last stretch of his early thirties, and now that he was old enough to have caught the eye of Shannon over a decade ago new memories of his 8 year old son & 13 year old daughter, as well as dating his now wife, began to become the new normal as memories of them as siblings and mother faded into the deepest recesses of his mind. <br />
<br />
The Chronivac at this point had to shift Jeff&#39;s family tree and genetics including making Jeff&#39;s new relatives tolerable to Shannon, and edit Jeff and his kids genetically to match being his offspring, A wedding band entered into existence on Jeff&#39;s finger. All personalities shifted wildly as histories changed and the family dynamic was recast.<br />
<br />
Jeff brought in the last of the groceries. The 39 year old looked at his 47 year old wife with awe, still as beautiful as the day they met. &quot;Hey, maybe we should take a drive this weekend. I heard of a new place that does ATV rentals and I think the kids would love it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think the kids are a little too young for that still, don&#39;t they require a drivers license?&quot; Shannon said thoughtfully...<br />
<br />
&quot;Erg..&quot; Jeff grunted grabbing a beer. &quot;Alright, we can go east and rent some kayaks, explore the river. Bathing suits, suntan lotion. Water shoes. Exercise... we can leave the phones and tablets in the car and get some waterproof disposable cameras... After we build up an appetite we can explore the local food and ice cream scene... the kids will pass out on the way back home, and we can sleep in Sunday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds lovely.&quot; Shannon cooed. &quot;You&#39;re everything I could have ever hoped for.&quot;</p>
