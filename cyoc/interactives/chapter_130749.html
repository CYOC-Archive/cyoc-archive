<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Project Cameron was a rather ambitious project. It wasn&#39;t just because of rescuing refugees were victims of human-trafficking, wars, or other hardships, but because of the increasing anti-immigration movements being made by the current government. While it was unlikely that a compete immigration embargo would happen, it might get harder to bring in new refugees to join Animalia. Especially if the current government starts cracking down more on Animalia on a whole. As such, it may require refugees to go to the different colonies to join Project Cameron. Fortunately, the colonies would be well-equipped to help them, particularly the two African colonies that were nearing completion and the two Asian colonies that were currently in progress.<br />
<br />
However, the girls that Ping had brought back from China were already in Lyre and were ready to undergo the process of conversion. They were extremely grateful to have been rescued from the &#39;sex cult&#39; they had been basically slaves in. All of them had been mistreated to some extent, some worse than others. What was shocking was that some of these girls were rather young, the youngest being 14 if not 13. Needless to say, everyone was relieved to see that cult get shut down and Ping became rather popular for punching out the pimp/cult leader.<br />
<br />
Unsurprisingly, several of the girls wanted to become predators or some formidable type of Animalian which would not be so defenseless. The girls were also wanting their former identities completely erased. It wasn&#39;t really about trying to hide from anyone coming for them, as they were not likely to get them in America. But the girls wanted to make a clean slate with their new lives and new identities. It was easy enough to take care of that, even if some of the process was under the table. Their official human records would say that they&#39;ve died of the STDs or the drug overdoses they were being treated for and this new Animalians would be able to enjoy a new anonymity. Five particular girls rose in prominence both for their interest in martial arts and their strong union. Apparently, they were going to recreate the Furious Five from &#39;Kung Fu Panda&#39;, but since mantises and other arthropods could not be affected by the Animalian virus (which was something that was unanimously considered a blessing), they instead became a group based on the Five Elements in Chinese philosophy.<br />
<br />
Huoxing was a red panda, representing Fire and the planet Mars. She was generally considered the most energetic one of the group, showing off with flips, somersaults, tumbles, and handstands. When she was in the cult, she was helping to keep her fellow slaves&#39; spirits up by making them laugh and try to get as much exercise as possible. Her choice in being a red panda was not just because of their popularity, but because red pandas are also known as firefoxes. Though the red panda&#39;s cute and cuddly appearance was also a factor.<br />
<br />
Tuxing was a tigress, representing Earth and the planet Saturn. While tigers were an obviously popular choice, between the five girls, it was decided that Tuxing deserved it the most. She was apparently the youngest at 14 and was more vulnerable than the others. But she also had a strong spirit that didn&#39;t bend easily. Now as a double-dosed tigress, she was definitely not going to be a victim anymore. She was remarkably well-centered for someone of her real age, but she did have to grow up fast for being where she was.<br />
<br />
Jinxing was a snow leopard, representing Metal and the planet Venus. She was known for being on the vain side, often admiring herself in her reflection when she can. Becoming a leopardess was obviously to enhance her beauty. It wasn&#39;t that much of a surprise that she&#39;d be associated with reflective metal. But that wasn&#39;t her only reason as Jinxing had an affinity with technology more than the others. Just because she was prone to self-admiration doesn&#39;t mean she wasn&#39;t smart.<br />
<br />
Shuixing was a water buffalo, representing Water and the planet Mercury. Most people were surprised she wouldn&#39;t have chosen a more aquatic animal or one that was faster and more agile. The reason for her choice was because she was a rather heavyset and burly girl, which made an unpopular choice for the cult&#39;s &#39;clients&#39;. She was often teased for her homeliness as well as being as clumsy as an ox. Instead of converting to a sleeker and more graceful animal, she decided to become one that best reflected her. Though she was prone to self-esteem issues even after conversion.<br />
<br />
Muxing was a tree viper, representing Wood and the planet Jupiter. She stood out from her sisters quite a few ways, not just for being the only reptile in her group. She was the one who held the biggest grudge against her former captors. And even though the cult had been shut down, that didn&#39;t mean she was willing to let that go yet. So in addition with arming herself with kung-fu, she now had a pair of venomous fangs that would make it unlikely for any man to attack her. But her sister&#39;s influence was helping her get over her pain. She was also associated with wood because she had a talent for gardening, though some would worry if she&#39;d start raising poisonous plants.<br />
<br />
The quintet of sisters-in-arms, who soon began being called the Five Elements, were gaining a lot of interest. It wasn&#39;t just because of their shared backstory, their new forms, or their martial arts training. The five of them had a certain gravity of influence and would probably become the biggest campaigners for Project Cameron. They were certainly picking up interest in China. It may be only a matter of time before someone in China offered to make them stars in their own TV show or perhaps their own manhua series.</p>
