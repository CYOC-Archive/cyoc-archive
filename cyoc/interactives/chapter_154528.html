<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I never asked…how old are you?” inquired Kim as Sharon turned and looked at her as the two of them just kept walking. “I know people age down because of the virus and possibly even get older but…”<br />
<br />
“I am 23.” Answered Sharon as Kim nodded. <br />
<br />
“21.” Answered Kim before Sharon could ask herself, she looked down feeling a little sad about asking and for the first time really noticed that Sharon didn’t have any shoes on, only fur covered feet which now had claws on each of her toes. “I go to collage a few hours away for internal design.”<br />
<br />
Sharon blinked a few times and stopped and looked at her. <br />
<br />
“Tell me, is the mascot of this school a stupid looking Eagle?” inquired Sharon as Kim blinked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, you know it?” inquired Kim<br />
<br />
“I go to the same school, sophomore in education.” explained Sharon “I live on South Green.”<br />
<br />
“North Green.” Answered Kim as she thought about it. “Wouldn’t you be a junior or a senior? I took time off from high school to earn enough money to go to school. Even with my scholarship it was hard to do.”<br />
<br />
“Same here and I worked two jobs for two years to afford to go.” Answered Sharon as the two of them walked past the pool area. A few people where swimming and some of them seamed to be talking under the water. “I dropped one once I started school, but I am still a waitress.”<br />
<br />
“My mother has been a truck stop waitress her entire life.” added Kim “I am the first in my family to go to college. Same here, my dad is a janitor and my mom work in a school cafeteria. Not a lot of money growing up.”<br />
<br />
“Same here, Dad died and my stepdad is a truck driver but with so many of us it is hard for them to really do anything.” Admitted Kim “They try their best, but it never is enough.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe there I was luckier then you, only child and my mom’s hours where the same as my school hours so she made it to all the after school stuff and the like.” Said Sharon as she looked toward the pool with sadness in her eyes.<br />
<br />
 “Most horrible part of changing is that I am becoming a cat person and I was on the swim team in school.”<br />
<br />
“Tigers can swim.” Countered Kim as Sharon rolled her eyes a bit.<br />
<br />
“I know that.” Answered Sharon “However wet fur is heavy as hell so now speed swimming for me anymore.”<br />
<br />
“Still you could go for a swim?” offered Kim as Sharon shrugged. <br />
<br />
“Maybe but it will not be the same.” Countered Sharon<br />
<br />
“Nothing will be the same for either of us.”  Added Kim as she let out a sigh. “Maybe I have gotten luckier then most becoming a Nymph but still it will be different for me, for all I know I may become a fire Nymph and going into a pool will kill me and I will not find out what I am fully becoming for two more days. That is the last thing to change.”<br />
<br />
“I guess that sucks a bit.” Admitted Sharon as they kept walking some more talking, neither of them had a destination to go to but soon they found themselves back in the garden area where multiple group counselor meetings where still going on in their own private areas of the gardens. One was just letting out as Haley came walking out of her group and turned toward them. She stopped in her tracks and just looked at the two of them.<br />
<br />
“Are you two following me!” snapped Haley as Sharon rolled her silted eyes.<br />
<br />
“No…hell I don’t even know you, only meet you this morning and believe me you haven’t made a good impression.” countered Sharon as Haley eyes narrowed, and she glared at her. <br />
<br />
“I asked the councilors if you could have given me the virus.” said Haley as she looked at Kim. “They said given that we both know each other it is likely that we got it from the same person.”<br />
<br />
“The only person we have in common is Lisa.” Said Kim “And she isn’t becoming a monster…well not physically.”<br />
“Not everyone comes down with the flu they said, some are carriers but don’t get sick.” Stated Haley “Another way that backstabbing whore got me.”<br />
<br />
“Could I ask what…what she did?” inquired Kim, her inner curiosity winning out over her normal shyness. Haley looked at her for a moment and then at Sharon.<br />
<br />
“When I found out about my condition, I went to Bill’s apartment to get some comfort and found the two of them in bed together.” Stated Haley “If that wasn’t bad enough, she said it was no big deal and that she slept with all of her friend’s boyfriends. When I brought up her boyfriend she shrugged and said as long as he marries her he can cheat on whom ever he likes. He is one of the best linebackers in the nation, NFL scouts are already after him, so she gets to be the rich wife of an NFL superstar and he gets to wife who doesn’t care who he sleeps with. A win win in her book. I wouldn’t care if she didn’t go after my boyfriend, I want to strangle both of them starting with Lisa.”<br />
<br />
An idea began to form in Kim’s head, could she really risk it.<br />
<br />
“I want to get back at Lisa for everything she did to me…everything you all did to me.” Said Kim her voice low. “All the bullying, all the torment and everything. You may have played a part in that but Lisa she was the ringleader.”<br />
Sharon tilted her head and raised an eyebrow as she crossed her arms over her well-endowed chest. She followed where Kim was leading her. <br />
<br />
“An alliance?” inquired Haley<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Kim<br />
<br />
“I hope you two aren’t planning to kill her, if it is just revenge, I think I will help, she sounds like she needs to be brought down a few pegs.” Stated Sharon<br />
<br />
“As much as I would love to see them dead, that would put me in jail not worth that.” Stated Haley <br />
<br />
“Agreed.” Confirmed Kim “I guess if we are going to do something once we get out of here, we need to tell each other what we are becoming.”<br />
<br />
“I guess we do.” Stated Haley clearly not happy to be working with someone like Kim but the old saying about an enemy of an enemy of enemy is your friend came to mind.<br />
<br />
“A Nymph.” Answered Kim as Haley blinked. “I am becoming a Nymph.”<br />
<br />
It took a few minutes to explain what a Nymph was and the powers but soon it was Haley’s turn to share what she is becoming.<br />
<br />
“God damn it…alright.” Started Haley “I am becoming a….”</p>
