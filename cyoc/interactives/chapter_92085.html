<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day, the two of you enjoyed school quite a bit. It was fun, checking out all your formerly-male friends and seeing their new identities--even though you already had imposed memories of this new reality. You had fun going to the massive girl&#39;s bathroom (next to the personal male bathroom for male staff) and see how generally casual and pleasant everything was with no sexual tension going on.<br />
<br />
However, what you quickly realized, is that a lot of your classmates were dating older men. That is, men 21 years or older. Reality had adjusted to make that more socially acceptable. You and Maya consider changing this (making all teenagers incapable of being attracted to older men), but you realize that would leave you all romantically hungry. You come to realize that dating older men is generally an okay idea; they&#39;re (usually) more mature and supportive, so the awkwardness and emotionally-driven teenage stupidity was greatly reduced. So you decided to keep it this way.<br />
<br />
You and Maya didn&#39;t ever get a relationship, though. You knew that you&#39;d be back together in normal fashion in a few years, and your friendship was enough to tide you over. You did both fantasize about men quite a bit, though. Some 20-something guys that you knew in particular you had crippling crushes on, but using your newly-minted feminine ability to cover those feelings up, you survived.<br />
<br />
Notable was how news and science reports would say things like &quot;the genetic anomaly wherein no baby boys were born from 1999 to 2009&quot;; which was how reality reconciled how no boys existed in that certain age range. Every passing year, though, it became &quot;from 2000 to 2010&quot; and so on.<br />
<br />
As the two of you went through high school, your bond became progressively stronger as you used the notebook to stop serial killings and shootings, then eventually wars and poverty and viral illnesses. On March 23rd, 2022--a few months before you and Maya&#39;s senior/junior graduations respectively--you decided to address the fact that the 180 page note book had only 12 remaining pages. You thought it over carefully, and wrote, &quot;this notebook now has an addition 300 pages.&quot; And boom, it worked exactly as you hoped, and that problem was resolved.<br />
<br />
You went to college, and couldn&#39;t be with Maya quite as much--you both decided not to mess with your educations/knowledge to override that; especially since you were able to meet up at least once a week anyway.<br />
<br />
It was true, though, that dealing with world problems became less pleasurable when the both of you were so much more stressed out about life. Particularly that you were working two jobs in-between college, your get-togethers were more brief and a little more awkward. Dealing with things like hunger and war aren&#39;t as easy as they sound. Writing &quot;the end of world hunger&quot; simply means that no one becomes hungry any more, which turned out to make everyone depressed; so you went back on that one.<br />
<br />
Same with &quot;there will be no more war&quot;, it resulted in an end to human conflict altogether, including even the internal conflict of one&#39;s own mind; resulting in a total collapse of society and the entire human race. It took you and Maya three weeks to build up the nerve to even lift the pen to change it back and reverse everything.<br />
<br />
In other words, you and Maya had to pay attention to the news and solve these problems on a case-by-case basis. You also didn&#39;t want people thinking there was some guardian angel making the world better; once people started thinking a God was taking care of their problems, they became lazy. But if you just write, &quot;no one will believe in God&quot;, it killed the sense of faith and belief in higher powers that people all need on some level, so like everything else, you and Maya have to deal with it on a case-by-case basis.<br />
<br />
In other other words, you didn&#39;t solve nearly all the problems after a while. People still get slaughtered, people still starve, and people are still homeless. It&#39;s only a 20th of what it was back in 2020 when you and Maya first started using the book, but it&#39;s still millions every year.<br />
<br />
When Maya graduated high school and managed to get into the same college as you, the two of you decided to take a break from solving world issues. Then on the night of her 19th birthday, you both made a few more changes, and then decided to retire from it altogether. You weren&#39;t even going to hand the book&#39;s power over to anyone else; so much prosperity had been made, so many new inventions had come that made life better, that you both felt that a supernatural power won&#39;t be necessary any more; if humanity is ever going to have true perfection in society, it&#39;ll have to make it happen organically.<br />
<br />
After making that tough decision, you fell Asleep in Maya&#39;s bed; locked in each-other&#39;s arms; something the two of you hadn&#39;t done since high school.<br />
<br />
The year that followed was really simple and fun for the two of you. You just used the book for little pranks and daily conveniences. After a while, seeing each other once a week wasn&#39;t so bad any more. You started taking turns with the book more regularly, and before long you had filled up nearly 200 of the added 300 pages.<br />
<br />
Then you graduated college after three years, and moved in with Maya. Now, the two of you started seeing each other more than ever, and your bond had become as strong as it was before. You both gradually grew distant from the other groups of friends you&#39;d made independent of one another, and became obsessed with each other again. You didn&#39;t even use the notebook that much.<br />
<br />
The week leading up to your 21st birthday, you went on a mini-vacation together; meeting up with all your old friends and family. Even if only you and Maya were aware of this fact, it was sentimental to be effectively be giving them one last time to see you in the form that they&#39;d known you as for the last five years. Friday was &#39;Julie&#39;s&#39; 21st b-day party at your parents&#39; house, and you all had a fun, eventually drunken time. [Note: The legal drinking age in America dropped to 19 in November 2024, so it was something very new to both you and Maya.] [Another note: Self-driving cars are common now, so getting back to your apartment was a non-issue.]<br />
<br />
Saturday morning, you and Maya hung around the house. For fun, you decided to bust out an old, half-used package of teenies you had in your closet and soil yourselves for an afternoon. As teenagers, a slow pottytraining process began when you were each 17. You were in teen pull-ups by the time you were 19; Maya was in them by 18 and a half. Now at 20 and almost-21, Maya was still having little day-time accidents in her pull-ups a few times a week--and wetting the bed moderately every other night--, but you were far along enough that you only needed them at night--though you barely wet them like twice a month--and out of the house for long road-trips or situations you wouldn&#39;t have quick bathroom access. It had been odd, 8 months ago, getting used to wearing panties (and feminine pads, for that matter; something never needed with diapers), as it was something you&#39;d never done before in any version of your life, and now wouldn&#39;t be doing for much longer.<br />
<br />
Neither of you had experienced messing yourselves for, man, two years at least. You taped one another into your old diapers, relaxed your bowels, and had a great fun time sitting down at the couch together, watching TV in messy diapers. Only after four straight hours of laying and rolling and squishing around in them did you both remember that it used to smell really bad, and that you used to get skin rashes for not changing quickly (something you both eliminated entirely a mere 2 months into your notebook-using career.) You gave each other a change, and within 25 minutes you&#39;d soiled and messed them completely all over again. By the time you&#39;d both wet and messed through your 3rd diapers each, it was 9:40. With only four diapers remaining, you stuffed them back into your closet, and went to the bathroom together. You cleaned each other off, threw the diapers away, and thought about what to do next.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if we enjoy your female body for the last time together, and take a shower?&quot; Maya suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;...okay! Excellent idea.&quot; You said as you both started taking off the rest of your clothes. You realized that you&#39;d never actually taken a shower together before, but since then you&#39;d both become so close that it seemed completely natural. You still were completely straight young women; you were just so emotionally affectionate for one another that you felt you could completely open up to one another.<br />
<br />
You binge on snacks as your hair dries, then you finally put on your pull-ups and crash into bed together; the both of you slip asleep as you both clutch tightly and longingly onto your breasts.</p>
