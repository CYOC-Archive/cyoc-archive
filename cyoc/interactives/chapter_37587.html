<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter's stomach was now a massive, larger than life orb protruding from his body like a grotesque, perfectly round tumor.  It was tight and hard to the touch, along with the rest of his body, which resembled that of an enormous professional bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Joce, this is awesome!&quot;  Peter said, rubbing his giant orb of a belly, which hung down between his mammoth muscular thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't it though?&quot; Joce replied gazing dreamily at her massive boyfriend.  She peeled back the extraordinarily tight white undershirt, which had survived the swelling of his belly, and now clung tight to the top of the orb, and strained across his giant pecs.  She peeled it back to just below his nipples to get a glimpse at his rock-hard very large pecs.  The shirt clung tightly around his biceps and shoulders.<br />
<br />
Down below, the once semi-tight gym shorts now clung desperately for dear life, having been pushed down his body by the tremendous stomach of his, they now wrapped around his quads like saran wrap, so tight that it would be impossible to get the thinest piece of paper between them and his skin.<br />
<br />
Peter took another swig of the bubbly champagne.  Almost instantly he felt it...the tightening of his skin and muscles, knowing that growth was coming, said out loud,  &quot;how can I grow anymore stomach?!  it's already huge!&quot;<br />
<br />
Before either himself or Joce could say anything, his question was answered.  His shoulders and biceps began to puff up with even more muscle, becoming laughably round and enormous.  Peter's traps started to push up his neck, quickly brushing his ear lobes on their ascent up his neck.  Peter's back began to bloat as well, as thick muscle blimped out in an obscene fashion, pushing him away from the back of the couch.<br />
<br />
His forearms weren't far behind as they too swelled up with even more thick muscle, each one plumping out obscenely, till his forearms were each the size of a large watermelon.  By now Peter's biceps had reached their height of growth, and the sleeves of the stretchy white undershirt couldn't handle it anymore, and split as the gigantic biceps reached the 60 inch mark, more than twice the size of most men's waists.  To go along with his giant, bloated biceps were triceps of unseen size.  Peter's shoulders had become a force to be reckoned with at nearly 6 and a half feet wide.<br />
<br />
Peter's pecs were quick to follow his arms' and back's growth, swelling quickly and blimping out with immense, raw power.  They quickly split the remains of the white undershirt at the neck, along with more growth from Peter's upper back, and Peter was left a swelling, shirtless muscular mass on the couch.  The growing and distending of Peter's pecs seemed to push his massive round belly even closer to the floor.  Once his pecs had reached the size of roughly two large pillows, though much harder and rounder, the growth seemed to slow for a moment.<br />
<br />
Joce giggled slightly at this point, her boyfriend looked utterly ridiculous with his massive upper body, and very much smaller (if you want to call them that) legs.  Her giggle was quickly stifled though, as the growth, which seemed to be skipping by the stomach, though Joce was sure she saw it inflate a couple of inches in each direction, reached his thighs.<br />
<br />
Instantly, Peter's quads bloated with more muscle.  Peter was quickly forced into a reclining position as his stomach was pushed out from between his legs and up on top of them as his quads pressed together and outwards in every direction.  Quickly, his shorts started popping their seams, and it was too long before they simply shredded off of him completely.  Peter's legs were constantly being pushed into a wider and wider angle as the inner muscles of his thighs fought for space and pressed hard into one another, finally stopping at just under 170 inches around each, nearly triple the size of his biceps.<br />
<br />
His calves were not to far behind as the swelling finally reached them, not slowing down a bit, as they blew up the back of Peter's already muscular calves, and pushing his feet far off the floor, not stopping until they reached the size of giant beach balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;WOW.&quot;  Was all Peter could manage to say, taking deep and heavy breaths as he lay, nearly completely reclined.  His gigantic arms stuck out from his body, pushed away by his traps, nearly a foot thick and several times wider than any pro bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
Joce gazed at her grotesquely massive boyfriend, but with love and longing.  She loved how he looked when he was huge.  So content and happy, even though he could barely move.<br />
<br />
Peter's belly was still just as large as it had been, even a few inches bigger, but now it seemed slightly more proportional to the rest of his blimp-like body.  Which was a fitting description, as he resembled a small parade-balloon that had been mistakenly over-inflated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you move this time, honey?&quot; Joce asked loveingly at her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know.  Lets find out...&quot;  Peter answered.</p>
