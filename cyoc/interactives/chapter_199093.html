<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">****Two Hours Earlier****<br />
<br />
Abolith frowned, glancing at the team of mercenaries she was traveling with. She could already tell they weren&#39;t going to survive.<br />
<br />
Despite the joyous announcement of her sons divine nature, a glaring issue remained. Shizen, nor anyone else, could tell Abolith who had leaked her sons divine nature to the Normal. For almost a month Abolith had stewed on this &quot;elephant in the room&quot;. How was she to trust any of her so called allies if they were so willingly to give the Normal information on her son. That was when she was contacted by Shay.<br />
<br />
The nekomata mercenary had been contracted to fly the latest kill team to the Normals location. Abolith had learned that despite the Normals power, they had made a tremendous amount of enemies over the years. Many had tried to assassinate the Boss yet all had failed. That was how Abolith now found herself flying to this undisclosed location. Stretching the elf now made her way to the cockpit to have a talk with Shay.<br />
<br />
&quot;How far are we,&quot; Abolith asked. Shay now glanced towards her, her white ears twitching as she checked her location. &quot;Id say 10 minutes from the drop point,&quot; she said. Abolith nodded, frowning as she glanced back at the six men dressed in black special forces gear. &quot;These idiots will be dead in six.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arent you optimistic,&quot; Shay chuckled. &quot;You know these guys are all former special forces. Spetnaz, SAS, SEALS, Green Berets. They know how to handle themselves in a fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Against humans,&quot; Abolith countered. &quot;The Normal. This...Boss. They are something quite different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then its a good thing you&#39;re tagging along,&quot; Shay stated. The nekomata now turned studying the elf carefully as she affixed her veil across her face. &quot;That reminds me. Why the hell did you take this job? Isn&#39;t Fukushu going to have a stroke if he finds out your trying to kill the Boss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not trying to kill the Boss,&quot; Abolith stated much to Shay&#39;s surprise. &quot;I only need information.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Information?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Normal know what my son is,&quot; she said. &quot;Someone told them he is a celestial. I need to know who.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shay gasped, she hadn&#39;t know of Raiden&#39;s celestial nature until now. Thankfully, she realized that that was in her favor. If Abolith had suspected her she would probably be dead. &quot;I had no idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s why your not dead Shay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shay simply nodded, realizing that was probably the friendliest thing the elf would say. &quot;After touchdown ill be with communication range. When your ready for extraction just call.&quot; Abolith nodded, returning to the cargo area and taking a seat. She needed to mentally prepare herself.<br />
<br />
Making her way to shore, Abolith now glanced at her traveling companions. The group was skilled at silent incursion and armed to the teeth. If the Normal had been simple terrorists she had no doubt they would have succeeded. Instead she realized they would simply become another set of bodies for the Bosses tally. They were simply a distraction to allow Abolith to gather her information and leave. Watching the team advance, Abolith quickly broke away from them.<br />
<br />
The Normals headquarters was on a small island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. While known to many, few dare attempt an incursion. All who had tried to take out the Boss had met with a grizzly fate. As Abolith now made her way through service tunnel, she checked with Shay. &quot;How much further.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About 100 yards,&quot; Shay stated over the radio. &quot;Good news is the Normal are distracted with the team. Bad news they&#39;re at high alert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was expected,&quot; Abolith stated. &quot;Any sign of the Boss or any other heavy hitters?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet but I&#39;m pretty sure they know they&#39;re under attack so be ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith kept pushing forward, her investigation into who had betrayed them had proven fruitless. The elf was at her wits end when she finally got in contact with Shay. Luckily the nekomata was able to inform Abolith that a hit team was making a strike against the Normal. Abolith of course insisted on coming along, not to assisted the Boss but to discover who had discovered her sons divine status. Unscrewing a ventilation grate, the elf assassin now eased herself onto a gangway that beheld the Normals massive base.<br />
<br />
Abolith could see Normal soldiers running around, securing escape points as others moved to engage the intruders. While it meant security was high, it also meant other less essential areas were left lightly defended. &quot;Gonna need a terminal Shay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Move along the walkway,&quot; Shay replied. &quot;Theres an access terminal you can hack. You should be able to find what your looking for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith now crept along the walkway, scanning the area carefully. The security terminal she was looking for lay in a secondary control center that monitored the bases ventilation systems. Thankfully Abolith had enough computer skills that she could hack the terminal and gain access to the Normals main computer. With luck, she might be able to find what she was looking for.<br />
<br />
Glancing into the control center, Abolith now noticed two lone guards monitoring the terminal. While killing these two would be easy, she didn&#39;t want to start stacking bodies just yet in case she couldn&#39;t find what she was looking for. Quietly the assassin now crept behind the two guards before leaping into the air. Placing one guard in a headlock while putting the other in a scissor lock, the assassin now flipped, slamming the guards to the ground and knocking them unconscious. &quot;I&#39;m in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good timing looks like the Boss and a couple of his toys just took out the team.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you they wouldn&#39;t make it,&quot; Abolith smirked. Shay could only sigh, telling the elf to hurry. Abolith now furiously began to work, searching for anything about her son. &quot;Damn there&#39;s nothing here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now this is intriguing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith spun, withdrawing her sword as she now glared at where the voice had come from. A grin now formed on Casseus&#39;s cracked and grey face as the red lit eyesore blazed with anger. &quot;Why are you here Abolith?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who told you about my son!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is none of your concern elf,&quot; Casseus hissed, a spell beginning to form in his hand. &quot;You have no idea how long I&#39;ve waited to do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith lept into the air, dodging Casseus spell. The two old allies crossing spear and sword as a battle now began. Abolith though was more skilled, quickly sweeping Casseus&#39;s legs. Pressing her blade to his throat the elf now removed her veil as she grinned maliciously. &quot;All your power Casseus and you still can&#39;t beat me. Now, who told you about my son!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Casseus said nothing, a sinister grin forming across his cracked face. Before Abolith could strike she felt a massive blow from behind, someone else was here. Groaning from the impact, she now looked up as Evan Harris glared at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you were right Casseus,&quot; Evan smirked. &quot;The hit team was a distraction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan Harris,&quot; Abolith snarled. &quot;The prodigal son. Tell me boy, do you think you can kill me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I know I can kill you,&quot; Evan stated. &quot;But killing you quickly just wouldn&#39;t be fun. Besides, want to know what your doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you working with,&quot; Abolith bellowed as she got to her feet. &quot;Who told you about my son?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan paused, a look of confusion  rousing his face before he began to laugh maniacally. &quot;Thats why you here,&quot; he laughed. &quot;Because of your brat!&quot; Evan laughed harder, firing a spell that Abolith was barely able to avoid.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think someone betrayed you,&quot; he yelled, firing off yet another spell as he advanced. &quot;Thats always been your problem. A lack of trust. Let me tell you who betrayed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a yell Evan now caught Abolith in his telekinetic grasp, slamming the elf into the walls before throwing her back. Abolith coughed spitting up blood as she furrowed her brow at the dark wizard.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the one that discovered you kids divine status,&quot; he sneered. &quot;It was me, no one else. Hope the information was worth Abolith because now...you die.&quot;</p>
