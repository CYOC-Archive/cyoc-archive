<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Next thing I know, I&#39;m being shaken awake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ender. Ender honey, time to wake up and go to school!&quot;<br />
<br />
I confusedly open my eyes, and see Liz&#39;s mom waking me up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-what....where am I?&quot; I ask as I look around at a strange bedroom. A familiar bedroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on now, honey. Don&#39;t play dumb. It&#39;s time for you to go to school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;School?&quot; I ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Now get ready and don&#39;t dawdle!&quot; she said as she turned to walk out the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; I said in my now higher-pitched voice. More confused than ever as I sit up and look around. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; I say again, as I recognize this bedroom. It was Ender&#39;s room at Liz&#39;s house, scrunching up my face in a little sneer.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell am I doing here?&quot; Barely even noticing that my voice sounds different. Softer. <br />
<br />
I sit all the way up, and the bed sheets slip down to my waist. I&#39;m wearing a small white undershirt. I don&#39;t wear undershirts to bed. I don&#39;t even have any undershirts. Hell, I don&#39;t wear shorts to be at all. <br />
<br />
I lift my arm up, and see that it&#39;s more than normal. And....HAIRLESS! <br />
<br />
&quot;What the HELL,!?&quot; I say a second time as I look at my other arms and my hands. There....the hands and arms of a kid! <br />
<br />
Next thing I notice, is that my chest is flat. I had really nice pecs, but now, I&#39;m sporting the chest of a young boy!<br />
<br />
I go lower, and fail to feel my 8 pack and I worked so hard and diligently for the past five years on!<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell!?&quot; I say for the third time. I throw the sheets off my lower body altogether, and am greeted with a pair of boxers that reach halfway down my thighs. My tanner, smaller thighs!<br />
<br />
I gaze down at my now much shorter legs, with no hair on them whatsoever! Perfectly smooth! My calves have a nice little round shape to them.<br />
<br />
My heart beating, I jump out of the bed; Ender&#39;s bed. And dash over to his closet where he has a full-length mirror hanging from it. Staring back at me, with a cute, shocked expression with wide puppy-dog eyes, is none other than Ender! <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck!?&quot; I see the mirrored image of Ender mouth the words I had just spoken aloud at the exact same time. <br />
<br />
I reached up, and felt my now-soft little 12 year old cheek. I then held out both of my hands in front of me. Turned them over back and forth. Such youthful hands! The long, skinny fingers of a child that has just lost their baby-fat less than a handful of years ago! <br />
<br />
I then start feeling my skinny little chest and belly. I feel all around my torso. Then looked back up at the image of Ender&#39;s warm brown eyes staring back at me!<br />
<br />
I step closer to the mirror to get an extra good look. I look very closely at the face. Perfectly smooth. Not a blemish on sight. The nose barely a bump in the middle of the face. Perfectly-sized. A slightly broad-shaped nose with a small rise off the cheeks. <br />
<br />
I open my mouth, and see Ender&#39;s signature crooked tooth on the top row of teeth. The right inciser bends a bit backwards, behind the front teeth. All the teeth are perfectly white, and the front teeth that of a child&#39;s adult teeth that haven&#39;t even begun to wear down yet. In other words, they&#39;re big in his mouth. In....my?.... Mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wtf?&quot; I say again, silently, as I close my mouth and stare at Ender&#39;s cute little face, reflected back at me from his mirror. <br />
<br />
I then hear knocking on the door. &quot;Oooohhh ENDEEERRR!&quot; I hear Liz&#39;s voice as she likes her head in the door. She sees me standing by the mirror, looking shocked. <br />
<br />
She which walks into the room, and walks over to me. She towers over me! It was highly disconcerting, and a bit intimidating, to be looking UP .....Way up....at my girlfriend. Rather than looking DOWN at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there, ENDER,&quot; She said with a suspicious little giggle. &quot;It&#39;s almost time for you to go to SIXTH GRADE today,&quot; emphasizing &quot;6th grade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is this!?&quot; I say in my new little boy&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on now, ENDER. You know you shouldn&#39;t swear,&quot; she says. Again, with a snicker.<br />
<br />
I know she&#39;s mocking me, and that she has something to do with this! <br />
<br />
I screw up my face, cock my head to the right a little bit to the right, and look defiantly at her. A mannerism of Ender&#39;s, and is always so endearing when he does that. Now I&#39;M doing it! <br />
<br />
&quot;You! You had something to do with this, Liz!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With what?&quot; She said with mock innocence. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know I&#39;m not Ender!&quot; I say forcefully. Well, as forcefully as my now 11 year old little voice could say anything. <br />
<br />
Giving a couple of more chuckles, she bent down at her knees so she could be eye-level with me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. I did it. I found this pair of socks you had lying on your coffee table at your place. I saw they claimed to be magic, and I brought them home. Long story short, I discovered they are, in fact, magic. All you have to do, is out then on, then wear a pair of shoes, and you&#39;ll turn into the person who wears those shoes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice try,&quot; i started to say. But as far-fetched as her story sounds, I AM her little 11 year old brother now! That&#39;s pretty far-fetched!<br />
<br />
She laughed as she stood back up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom is going to start yelling at you if you don&#39;t start getting around for school,&quot; she said. I was left looking back up at her from my much short stature. <br />
<br />
&quot;She isn&#39;t my mom, and I don&#39;t go to school!&quot; I said <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes you are. You&#39;re going back to 6th grade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Says who? I ask, acting more like the 11 year old I now am.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do, unless you don&#39;t want to go back to being yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you just told me me-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you go to school today, I&#39;ll give you your socks back,&quot; she interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;But. Why?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is April fool&#39;s. This is my prank on you. You&#39;ll spend the day as my little brother Ender.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But. This is humiliating!&quot; I said. &quot;I don&#39;t need to go to 6th grade!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to go back to being a college grad tomorrow, starting your new career in the fall you will.&quot;<br />
<br />
I started to speak, but closed my mouth, seeing that she&#39;s veing serious. Or else, she&#39;s a damn good actor and I didn&#39;t know that. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, where are the socks?&quot; I ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about that. They&#39;re safe. Ender has them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ender? And where is he!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Lizzy&quot; i hear a deeper man&#39;s voice. I then see....myself....!? Walk into my....I mean Ender&quot;&#39;s room. <br />
<br />
&quot;You-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup,&quot; he interrupted. &quot;i tried on your shoes with those magic socks my sister brought home. You&#39;ll be me for the day, and I&#39;ll be you! It&#39;llbe fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was wierd hearing my own voice. I sound way different than I ever thought I did. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh. So all I have to do is go to school for the day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup!&quot; Said both siblings simultaneously. One of the siblings as me. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. But what should I wear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here. Lemme show ya,&quot; said Ender. He walked over to the closet, reached in, and pulled out a white button-up shirt with a tie. Laid them on the bed. Then went over ti the dresser, and pulled out a dark blue sweater wuth a logo on the left breast, and a dark blue pair of pants. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is your uniform,&quot; he said holdng it up.<br />
<br />
My stomach twisted in knots.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uniform?&quot; I ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup. You&#39;ll be going to my school; St. Joe&#39;s!&quot;<br />
<br />
Great. I&#39;m not just a 6th grader. I&#39;m also a Catholic school 6th grader. I forgot he goes to St. Joe&#39;s. This sucks. <br />
<br />
As Ender was holding up the clothes I was supposed to wear, he kinda giggled a little and said, &quot;damn, these pants sure are small. I didn&#39;t realize how little I was,&quot; he said, looking at me and winked. &quot;Here ya go. Kid. Have fun!&quot; <br />
<br />
He walked out. So did Liz. Leaving me alone with my new  elementary private school uniform on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; i said and sighed.</p>
