<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fang&#39;s powerful taloned hand gripped my wrist tighter, almost painfully so.  She rolled onto her side, facing me, but also pinning my left arm under her, as she masturbated herself with my right hand. <br />
<br />
“MOORRREEEE!” she roared. “SO GOOD..FEEL SO GOOOOOD!”  My hand was practically paralyzed by her tight grip, but I did what I could to push her faster to orgasm, wiggling my fingers and pushing against her inner walls when I was able. At one point, a burning pain went through the back of my hand; she must have nicked me with a talon, I thought, but the pain quickly faded, and I was only concerned with getting this beautiful werewolf to cum.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, she did, letting loose with a long howl of release. She relaxed against me, pulling herself more tightly against me as she panted and shuddered in a post-orgasm glow. As she began to revert, she tossed a leg over mine and wrapped her furry arms around my shoulders, grinding herself against me and soaking my jeans with her cum, and my shirt with her sweat.<br />
<br />
Once she&#39;d fully reverted, she smiled at me. We were eye to eye again, her massive size having impossibly disappeared. She gave me a long kiss, soft and tender, before seeming to suddenly remember who I was and where we were. “Oh shit..James!” she exclaimed. “I...shit..” she said with a pause. She rolled off of me and chewed her bottom lip again, clearly conflicted.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll hear none of that, Cathy,” I said as I sat up. I shook my hand a bit, trying to gain feeling back into it. I glanced at the back of it, noticing an angry red welt, but it didn&#39;t appear that the skin had been broken, so as far as I was concerned, it was nothing to worry about. This would be somewhat ironic, given what I knew about how lycanthropy was transmitted, I suppose. (It would also be blatant foreshadowing, wink wink. Yes, that&#39;s right. I&#39;m quite aware that you&#39;re reading this right now, and how this story goes. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll say much more right now, kind of like Nan.)<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s only a half-moon, James. It&#39;s still a week until she&#39;s at full strength, and you saw how dominant she was!” Cathy protested. “I could have gone on a rampage, or hurt or killed you! Hell, you were trapped in that elevator with her!”<br />
<br />
“She was only hungry for one thing, really,” I said with a smirk. <br />
<br />
Cathy blushed and looked at me, her eyes twinkling a bit playfully. “Part of me isn&#39;t sorry about that aspect, I&#39;ll admit. I..wasn&#39;t so aware of how..,” she paused, considering her words, “enthusiastic you&#39;d be about helping tame that side of me.” She stood up, then suddenly seemed to notice her nudity.<br />
<br />
“Shit, James! Uhh...” she glanced around, “Is there any way I can borrow your shirt? I&#39;m kind of naked here, and I don&#39;t think that anyone else in this building is going to accept the story that it&#39;s not my fault I&#39;m naked.”<br />
<br />
I was six feet tall, and she was five ten. I figured my shirt would fit her well enough, and peeled it off. She took it from me, and paused to inhale the mingled scents of our sweat.  An almost blissful expression came over her face. “Mmmhh..” she said, burying her face in the fabric. “This smells wonderful,” she mused. “The scent of a man, wolf, and sex..” Her nipples hardened again, and she stood there for another moment, clearly lost in a pleasant fantasy. Then her eyes popped open in surprise and embarrasment. “Oh..heh...sorry..” she said, darting her eyes side to side nervously. “I&#39;m a little..err..weird after a change. Hormones and shit still going back to more human levels..sometimes I&#39;m still a bit wolfy for a bit after.”<br />
<br />
She pulled the shirt over her head, and luckily enough it fit, though just barely. Her sizable chest pulled the shirt up enough that her mound was just barely covered. “I need to be getting home,” she told me. “Walk me to my car?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Sure,” I agreed. She struggled for a minute to remember where she&#39;d parked; the garage was decently sized for our building. As we walked, I couldn&#39;t help but notice her eyes lingering more on my bare chest; I wasn&#39;t exactly muscular, but I was in decent enough shape. Meanwhile, I couldn&#39;t help but stare at her almost-bared ass as the shirt rode up slightly when she walked, or how outright adorable she looked in it. Her amazingly buoyant chest bounced satisfyingly when she walked, and I realized that while I&#39;d always thought Cathy was cute (particularly for her age, compared to mine), the knowledge that she was a werewolf made her ten times hotter in my mind.<br />
<br />
We got to her car and she turned around. For a moment, she stared at her feet. “James..I..” she paused. <br />
She looked at me, and I could see confusion on her face for a moment.  It was a conflicted expression.<br />
“Thank you..for tonight.” She leaned in and gave me another long kiss.  “And..umm...” she blushed hard suddenly and shook her head. “N-Never mind. Have a good night. Tell your mom I said I&#39;ll call.”<br />
<br />
She hurredly got into her car and started it, pulling away quickly.<br />
<br />
I headed back to the elevator, wondering how much I&#39;d have to explain to my mother, who probably realized why Cathy left. As I got back in the elevator, thankful that somehow we hadn&#39;t been discovered by any more tenants (aside from the guy I saved by wishing he&#39;d never been there), I pushed the button for our floor. <br />
<br />
My eyes fixed on the back of my hand, which was still covered in the remnants of the she-wolf&#39;s juices. The welt, which I was quite sure I had, was gone. “Must&#39;ve been my imagination,” I said to the empty elevator as it made its way back up the shaft. In hindsight, maybe I already knew and was in denial. Maybe it was the wolf side, already starting to come into existence protecting itself from immediate discovery. Maybe it was simply that this was what I&#39;d always wanted, in my heart of hearts. But for whatever reason, I gave it no further thought.<br />
<br />
When I got back to the apartment...</p>
