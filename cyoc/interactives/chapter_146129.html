<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Micheal headed down to his family mobile, rubbing his temples, subconsciously groaning to himself about his son’s response...even though it was partly ‘justified’.<br />
<br />
After all, the Kohs were raised to be a family who upheld their traditional beliefs. With ancestors stemming from Korea and Taiwan, China. They had to follow their traditional roots, and while Mr Micheal Koh had hints of softness within him as compared to the way his dad raised him up to be, he definitely raised their child is a similar fashion according to the Koh lineage...toning down on the homophobia and excessive tradition...but incredibly shocked their son had turned into one of those American Asian Frat bullies...<br />
<br />
He was so...foul mouthed, crude, rude, he never imagined that Ray..., I mean Raiden grew up to be a complete asshole...it was incredibly disheartening. Though deep down, he kind of envied him, a tall strong muscular frat boy who was free to be him...and had his family’s wealth to fund his loud-mouthed American ways...<br />
<br />
But it was enough! He had stood hidden and succumbing to his father’s...his ancestors wishes long enough. Raiden was still his son, and he had to be the man of the house...even as a gay father-! Trying to brush aside the feelings of attraction, lust and envy towards the asian jock, he immediately had dialed his son’s number- <br />
<br />
Little did he know it was the last time he will ever officially a Koh. <br />
<br />
PICK!<br />
<br />
“WHAT DA FUCK DO YOU WANT GHEY?<br />
“WHO YOU CALLIN’ GAY? YOU GAY?”<br />
<br />
————————————<br />
<br />
Raiden starred wide eyed at the response from his fath...., the words trailed off, almost like it was nonexistent anymore as the honorific seemed belonged to someone who was clearly more uptight and strict in terms of tradition in the Koh household. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile...the words comin’ from the other end of the receiver were far more brash... like, he was one of their kind...memories shifting as the roster in the hardcore gaming group he was in had revamped. Messages stemming from Bow...had passed onto a long time veteran in gaming, pranking, and overall shit-talking as a new number rose to becoming the founder of the chat group.<br />
<br />
Of course! How could he forget his brah? Specially when the brah usually sends DMs of hawt ass babes who were so damn fine. Nother’ one of his bros and his roomie, as posters of an incredibly asian frat boy...or frat boi hetuber plastered itself on the room next to Raiden. <br />
<br />
Somewhere further down the campus... Ramesh rolled his eyes at the narcissism that overflowed in it....but tolerated it as at least it screamed...<br />
<br />
“NO HOMO BRAH!”<br />
————————————<br />
“NO HOMO BRAH!”<br />
<br />
The two said in unison, as Micheal could feel his grey matter slowly but surely decreasing as though his knowledge of business and accounting went down the drain. Giving him a stoned look before his mouth naturally continued on the conversation.<br />
<br />
“Jus got wasted MAN! After my latest CON-QUEST! Gah that bitch be fine!”<br />
<br />
Micheal paused briefly, wasn’t he at Raiden’s place earlier? But as he tried to recall earlier, an incredible haze clouded up his mind...must be drinkin’ too much. They say dont drink and drive kids....but he says....you gotta do it when drivin’ in bed.<br />
<br />
“Know it bruh....eh, just now my....some pair of fags tried to PRANK Da PRANKSTER!”<br />
“You joshin’ me bruh!”<br />
“No joshin’!”<br />
<br />
They continued to chatter, as he felt a sense of connection...and bonding with his...son? Though from their conversation, they seemed more like best buds of some sort, though he recalled Raiden behaving the same way to most of the clique....as well as he himself doing the same as well..though as he recalled the face of Raiden....envy rose upward.<br />
<br />
He has to one up the man! It was cool...but he gotta be more-<br />
<br />
WOOSH!<br />
<br />
Nobody even remarked at how odd it was for a middle age man...to slur like a undergraduate who just got up from a hangover. As he turned to the car, his face contorted slightly and give a disgusted and ungrateful look at the mobile...like he deserved far better.<br />
<br />
“Course Ive got a sports car....Im fucking loaded” Micheal went on, a part of him believes he was ‘pretending’ to impress... Raiden, yet all those...slurs and derogatory remarks seemed so...real, like he really MEANT THEM! Like he actually had-<br />
<br />
Pressing the side of his semi-well off car, the roof top descended itself as the walls took on a fresh coat of paint, blasting a bright red as the seats renovated itself, warm as though the driver had just been on it until now. Polishing up was an expensive sports car as the dad....the dude gingerly fished out his keys, feeling the weight-noting the shininess and luxury as he give it a TWIST-<br />
<br />
VROOOOM<br />
<br />
Continuing on his convo, he leaped youthfully onto the front row of the car, as he does so,uncharacteristically to a father or just someone who loves cars, he KIIIIICKED and!<br />
<br />
VROOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br />
<br />
“AW YEAH BABY!”<br />
<br />
PRESS! down the accelerator, his dress shoe rebelling itself as patterns and spices of styles remove the polished quality of them.... basketball sneakers, aw yeah, limited edition for a stud like em....as the soles stretched hard and tougher beneath those newly worn ankle socks of his. Far stronger and more assertive...actually, like overconfidence as he knew the Lim blood was DA HOOD blood, just like his cous.<br />
<br />
Wiggling his feet to the completely douchebag mindset, LOUDLY-as those confined office feet fully stretched into those size 12 basketball-golden meshed trainers, the high end stereotypical rich kid brand as his feet typically LEAPED onto the spotlight,<br />
making loud Vroom-VROOMS as the noise escalated around campus, almost like announcing his presence with loud breaths as this guy was one that demanded attention. <br />
<br />
And he liked that, he deserved the best after all.<br />
<br />
VROOM VROOOOOOOOOOOM!<br />
<br />
Satisfied with those revs, as he kicked back his legs onto the front porch, passing the wheel. STREETTTCH longer, toner and more muscular as a load of energy reinforced his bad attitude, as his long young man legs crossed over the other, straining the suit pants obviously which were too tight fitting to the younger, and far taller thighs as the natural-born basketball brah.  Sweat meshing into the material. Turning lighter, reaching a light blue and shifting into a pair of sandblasted jeans, totally casual as compared to the ex father.<br />
<br />
‘Ex? Hah! These bitches be MY EX, not the reverse!’<br />
<br />
Hot sun tanning the complexion within, reflecting a less korean and taiwanese tone as it emphasized the rowdy parts of da hood in America, mixed with ancestors of kings from China. The mixture ultimately produced the perfect fuck boi coloration in the Lims, which rose up and forcibly made those powerful thighs of his into its territory... screaming rebellion...almost as though he-<br />
<br />
‘Yeh I scored detention nonstop with my bros back in high skool, and it was AWESOME!’<br />
<br />
Reality shifting, as his belly was bubbling, memories of being the king of The Asian Fuckers was DA BLAST! Shame those school days were ovah, as well as those fights with Carl Anderson to be the leader, The Lim’s gotta be in charge yo!<br />
<br />
With the growing pride comes douchebaggery and arrogance, as his abdominals solidified into a hardcore six pack, his buttoned down melted into a single tee, with black ink sprouting out, intricate as it tattooed a large zodiac chinese dragon print on his X-L sized shirt, over so slightly oversized, emphasizing  his HOOD nature.<br />
<br />
As his pectorals pushed out cockily against the tee. Ones belonging to a loudmouthed know it all as his nipples were erect due to all the trouble he caused in his life, though he knew there was something else hotter flowin’ in his brain.<br />
<br />
———————<br />
Unknowingly, as former were hets revert, their former heterotypical traits have passed onto a a new host... Chat logs of swears and boyish insults from Bo...Bo...,one of the former asian were-het forms, have been transferred and amplified over to the new kingpin of douchebaggery. Something the former Italian princess would drool over had she remained the pure Italian bitch she once was.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, as memories of pure rude nastiness from his high skool days flooded the former victim of bullying...and he would bully them hard, specially the fags....with a-<br />
<br />
“NO HOMO-“<br />
—————<br />
“NO HOMOS- ere’ , man!”<br />
“Course no fags be round’ brah, you give them a loudass NO HOMO POUNDIN’...”<br />
<br />
The remaining bits of Micheal watched as his mouth had a mind of its own. Barely even managing to cover it, almost like mirroring another gay guy before his momentary transformation after the hollering mouth. <br />
<br />
His member is loving the trash talk, voice slowly being corroded into a far cry from a gay dad as his dumbing down mind is barely processing his former data...deleting his former last name and history as there was no reason for this man to even NOT want to receive an update.<br />
<br />
A HOMO POUNDIN’, Flexing his biceps, almost overtly proud of his heterosexuality as it oozed through the suit sleeves. Puffing em out as it took on a mandarin orange tone, with a black underside as his signature puffer jacket styled him like one of his Chav homies from across the pond.<br />
<br />
“Course’, the Lim family are da hood family. Ain’t no way any of us be ghey!”<br />
“The Kohs are DA SAME! No gheys in da Koh family!”<br />
“No gheys in da Koh famileh....”<br />
<br />
He may be a Lim...but something seemed off...<br />
Like...how at least one of them was gay...<br />
<br />
“Oh shit! Time to run my laps dude, stay straight!”<br />
<br />
The other men hung up, as the young man Lim nervously adjusted the the belt he had below, as it singed into an arrogant but loose click, a golden dragon buckle in the center as the golden belt loosely hung like the doors to HIS dragon are already open.<br />
<br />
And the furst instinct was to-<br />
<br />
GROPE! AW ELL’ NO HE AINT GAY! The unsatisfactory ring on his fingers further intensified the Dragon’s greed, as the long inch member gaze into the middle age watch-into a pure gold playboy accessory to match his new marital status which is INCOMING. AND YEAH BABY WAS HE SINGLE!<br />
<br />
As the loosely warn tie fell without a father to hold on, it singed and coiled into a pair of sunglasses round his vision, which the Lim Boi HAD to put over his head as he was too HETERO! <br />
<br />
‘Better to be free than be tied down to a hag or a fag’<br />
<br />
“DAMN STRAIGHT!” He thought to that remark in his brain And yeah...even thinking he was straight...speakin’ of which, if he was straight-<br />
<br />
He tried to recall her...but all that came up were hot sexy babes that crowded around him, teasing and stroking him as though he was a kingpin.<br />
<br />
Its not just good enough to be NO HOMO-He gotta be-<br />
<br />
“DAYUM GURLLLLL!”<br />
<br />
AVAILABLE! Micheal turned the wheel to the side, car luckily stationary-as with recklessness comes youthful and fresher hands which swelled slightly larger. Unknown that the two of them had a connection in a former reality, his wedding ring turned bling, golden as many more loops slid onto the rest of his fingers-both hands. Hands of a man who did his reps and grew out leanly in order to impress the ladies as you gotta be single in order to mingle.<br />
<br />
AND SINGLE HE WAS! <br />
<br />
Kickin back, loudspotted an a blonde Aussie chick...He yelled the top of his lungs, his member leaking as a result of his never satisfying apetite as the hetero seed touched and turned his briefs into GOLDen Boxers, A shiny ass kind as his buttocks hardened beneath his seat.<br />
<br />
“Must be-DrEAMiN’” He slurred at the end, not only was his boner at full mast at the Aussie, but man were his vocal chords so loud and douchebaggery, it rivaled his obnoxious sports car as well!<br />
<br />
Ironically, the woman raised an eyebrow briefly, for she had a real ‘daddy’ down the beach. But she did admire the heterosexuality of this man, swishing her booty right at the man’s point of view, even the rear mirror could see it as she sexily moved past the car and out of sight.<br />
<br />
“WHERE ARE MY BABES!”<br />
His seat fell backwards, almost like chill-axing as his kicked his long legs on the top of the sports car, it was fuckin’ his, AND HE DOES AND FUCKS WHOEVER HE WANTS-IF HE WANTS BABES HE HAS-<br />
<br />
“Hey there gamer~”<br />
<br />
As he heard the sexy tone of an iconic triad, he got right up, rubbing his clear vision, only wearing specs to taunt those who had to wear em, he could clearly picture Erika Erotica’s crew comin’ after em’, and boy-was he CUMMIN’<br />
<br />
“AWWWW YEAH!”<br />
<br />
As the ladies surrounded him, he expertly performed yet another round of his move-set on da ladies, expertly roughening’ em up, like a bonus level in order to exceed the high score.<br />
<br />
“Youse think Raiden bad? Youse think Darius aims are pro? Wait till ya see ME!”<br />
<br />
Lim was without inhibition, as one could not only tell this man was straight but a complete douche. As his face was as young as his revving bod, a stereotypical but stylish undercut cropped at the top of his head as it stuck there like its the only kind of haircut a man like him would get!<br />
<br />
His eyebrows had singe from an adult to college fucc boi, as his lips thinned. His tongue leaped out past flashed perfect pearly whites as it had only one goal in mind, and so did his nose and ears as they turned youthful, snorted and only wished to hear loud douchebaggery and moans by his different conquests over the years.<br />
<br />
As the college man was in bliss, his jaw widened with his larger oval-shaped facial features, as this wealthy man was born to BE A CELEB! His eyes narrowed in goals, and so did his patience as the ladies REVVED all the gay-<br />
<br />
VRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<br />
“Those fuckers could only wish to have a taste of my hot bod!”<br />
<br />
Smirking to himself, Lim Mian Chao, swearing in his american-chinese ways as he gave a loud boisterous HAHAHAHAHA as he prepared for round two.</p>
