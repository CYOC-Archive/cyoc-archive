<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright kids, go get changed. I&#39;ll get everything laid out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa ushered her kids towards the changing room as her and her husband began getting their chairs set up. It was a lovely day for a trip to the water park. The sun was shining, temperatures were at record highs and, luckily for her, she had the day off work. The only damper on the day were the rising rumors of unusual events across the country. Something about people changing into monsters or some oddness like that. Melissa smiled at the thought. What silliness she thought to herself as she continued to set out the family&#39;s picnic. <br />
<br />
Eventually finishing setting everything aside, Melissa settled into a chair beside her husband, idly chatting about random topics as they looked out on the chaos of the water park. People young and old ran amok engaging in the numerous activities the park offered. Melissa and her husband had gradually settled into a relaxed state before they were interrupted by excitement at a nearby pool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa Tony man, chill out this is a public place bro!&quot; a young man could be seen gesturing to his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Tony, that&#39;s really weird. Maybe you should find a bathroom or something until you calm down.&quot; a petite woman agreed.<br />
<br />
Melissa and her husband directed their attention toward the excitement. Shockingly enough to the two of them they noticed that Tony, as his friends referred to him, appeared to be sporting a massive erection. For his part, Tony appeared to clearly be flustered by the whole situation, awkwardly getting out of the pool while covering his thick package. After a few steps, things got weird. Instead of trying to hide the package, Tony looked to be rubbing it. Sure enough, his friends took notice of the change in behavior.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man, you can&#39;t do that here, you&#39;ll get us in trouble!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony did not stop, but instead wrapped his hands around his growing member and began to stroke. Tony&#39;s friends continued to try to usher him away, but by now numerous other park goers had noticed the ruckus. Words of disapproval rang down on Tony and his friends, many of the group&#39;s families insisting that the park was for families and people of all ages. Apologies followed from Tony&#39;s friends as they continued to try to usher him away. Just as they got Tony moving, he shuddered, shouting &quot;guys, please help me!&quot; as a rocket of spunk erupted through his shorts.<br />
<br />
All surrounding bystanders were in shock at the display they had just witnessed. That was until a scream emitted from a nearby hot tub.<br />
<br />
Similar to Tony, a man could be seen in the pool frantically jerking himself off. The stranger part, however, was the pig tail emerging from his bathing suit. The other recipients of the tub looked in shock as the man continued to jerk, his nose extending into a pig snout as he did so. Eventually, with a squeal the man came in the tub.<br />
<br />
The park erupted into chaos.<br />
<br />
People pulled themselves from the hot tub, running every which way. A girl and her boyfriend ran a short distance before sprawling onto the ground. The girl&#39;s legs merged into a tail befitting a snake as her boyfriend&#39;s arms and legs shortened into that of a lizard. Another couple only make it a short distance before the wife tackled her husband to the ground and started madly thrusting herself at his backside. A tail could be seen extending from the woman&#39;s bathing suit as antlers extended from her and her husband&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
Back with Tony and his friends, Tony had taken on a rough, ogreish appearance as he continued to pleasure himself. He was not alone. His male friends had joined him in jerking themselves off. More shocking was the girls in the group. Sizable bulges could be seen extending into the girls&#39; bikini bottoms. It wasn&#39;t long before one of the girls began stroking her own member. Another girl, unable to control herself lunged at a friend&#39;s new cock, enveloping it in her mouth. Cries of ecstasy erupted from the group as one after another succumbed to their changes.<br />
<br />
Similar scenes could be observed around the park. In one area, a boy began spouting hair all over his body as he ejaculated in a throaty roar. Elsewhere a girl gasped in surprise as her neck extended into that of a giraffe. An attendant ran to try to assist the mass panic, only to stop in surprise as a spontaneous, earth shattering orgasm propelled her into rubbing herself vigorously.<br />
<br />
Across the grass from Melissa and her husband, a family had gathered their kids from the park and were looking to make their retreat. As they gathered their things together, the family was interrupted by their youngest son asking &quot;mommy, what&#39;s that in your skirt?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure enough, a tent could slowly be seen forming in the woman&#39;s skirt. Shock and panic flashed across the woman&#39;s face before she composed herself and continued to try to usher her family toward leaving. Unfazed by his mother&#39;s actions, the boy reached up to touch the growing object in his mother&#39;s skirt. The mother didn&#39;t have time to push the boy&#39;s hand away before he brushed the tent. Melissa and her husband watched the woman&#39;s eyes bulge as she turned herself from her son. The woman was clearly fighting with a wave of intense feelings. In an instant, however, the fight was over. With a cry, the mother emptied a torrent of spunk through her skirt. The woman looked up from her messed clothing in a state of desperation. &quot;Mommy?&quot; the boy asked.<br />
<br />
The boy&#39;s only response was his mother jumping to her feet and tackling a nearby woman to the ground. The mother ground at the woman in madness, eventually cumming a second and third time. The boy&#39;s father quickly hurried the remnants of the family away, looking back distraught as his wife cried in agony as her body bulked up with muscle and cock continued to spasm.<br />
<br />
Melissa and her husband had seen enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, we need to find the kids!&quot;</p>
