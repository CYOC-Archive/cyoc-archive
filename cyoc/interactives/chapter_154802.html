<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad woke up the following morning in the clamshell-shaped underwater bed that Vanessa had furnished his deepest tank with. But all day long that day, he saw no sign of Vanessa. Apparently, she was busy elsewhere and had no time to visit her pet merman today.<br />
<br />
Around 9 AM, though, Chad did get his first real visitor to the pool-area where he lived now (discounting Vanessa, as she was both the owner of the pool-grounds and technically Chad the merman himself). It was a pool-girl, who was going from pool to pool with nets to scoop up debris, and little test-tubes to check on the water salinity and acidity and other chemical qualities. She wasn&#39;t wearing a uniform or anything like that: just a pair of daisy-dukes and a red bikini-top.<br />
<br />
Chad surfaced in the pool nearby so that he could get a good look at her. The pool-girl, upon seeing the merman, squeaked in surprise and actually fell forward into the water with a terrific splash. The moment that happened, Chad kicked up his tailfin and dove down deep into the pool, took hold of the struggling pool-girl, and heaved her back up out of the water, shivering and sputtering.<br />
<br />
Now that he was up close to her, Chad could see that she was about his age (his real age, that is, maybe 18 or 19), and she was really pretty. She had a model&#39;s face with a natural beauty to it, and a figure to match. She didn&#39;t ooze sex the way that Vanessa did, and Chad actually found that he liked it better that way. Frankly, just looking at this girl, he was smitten.<br />
<br />
When the pool-girl finally managed to free her lungs from the salt-water, she looked curiously down at Chad, whose head and shoulders poked up out of the surface of the water. &quot;Oh,&quot; she said after a moment of surprised and curious staring. &quot;You must be Neptune. Ms. Bishop said that you&#39;d be in the pools, but I thought she was joking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad shrugged, nodded, and then pointed at the pool-girl until she got the message.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha—? Me? My name is Amy.&quot; (Chad reached out to shake her hand, which Amy took and shook, giggling.) &quot;Nice to meet you, Mr. Neptune.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad shook his head and made a cutting gesture at Amy&#39;s last couple of words. <br />
<br />
&quot;What, you mean your name *isn&#39;t* Neptune?&quot; (Chad shook his head.) &quot;Oh, of course not, that&#39;s a stupid thing for me to think. You&#39;re a merman, your real name is probably in some squealy dolphin-sounding language I can&#39;t pronounce.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad sighed and gave up at that point. <br />
<br />
Amy looked apologetic. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t figure out your name.&quot; (Chad shrugged.) &quot;Is it okay if I just call you Neptune, like Ms. Bishop does?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad nodded, but it was clear he wasn&#39;t happy about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Amy after a brief, awkward silence. &quot;I&#39;d better get back to cleaning the pools. Erm, your pools. Your home. Whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy was startled when Chad suddenly reached out and snatched her hand in his. This caused Amy to freeze and to look Chad in the eye. Chad stared, and he tried to *think* his distress at Amy. Through his eyes, he tried to convey his discontent with his circumstances, and his overwhelming desire to escape. It was a silent plea for help from a pathetic, captive creature with a human soul and a drive, a *need*, to be free.<br />
<br />
Amy surprised Chad by suddenly leaning down and kissing him on the lips.<br />
<br />
Chad sighed. Apparently, she didn&#39;t get the message.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; said Amy. &quot;I don&#39;t know what came over me. I&#39;ve never just *done* that to someone before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad shrugged again and smiled, as if to say that was no big deal, he didn&#39;t mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, well . . .&quot; Amy stood up, straightened her bikini-top, and picked up her pool-cleaning net. &quot;It was nice to meet you, Blue-Eyes. See ya around.&quot;<br />
<br />
She went back to work, and Chad mostly stayed out in the middles of the pools and watched her from afar for the rest of the day, until at last she finished up and left.<br />
<br />
* * * * * * * * *<br />
<br />
It was evening of the following day when Chad finally saw Vanessa again. The heiress came to the side of his &quot;bedroom&quot; pool and motioned for Chad to meet her in the little grotto of waterfall-connected jaccuzi-tubs. Vanessa wore only a black bikini-bottom, not even bothering with a top today, and Chad didn&#39;t know whether to be excited or annoyed by that—excited at the prospect of getting his dick back, versus annoyed at the presumption on Vanessa&#39;s part.<br />
<br />
She walked around and lowered herself into the uppermost tub, while Chad had to swim through the connecting canals to get to the bottom tier. &quot;Oh, Neptune!&quot; Vanessa called down to him. She jiggled her bare breasts at Chad in a highly suggestive manner, and she held up in her hand a little trinket—a golden bracelet, shaped like a winding sea-serpent. &quot;I&#39;ve got a little present for you, my pretty little dickless fishboy! Slither up here and earn a snake from your mistress!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad understood that Vanessa was saying humiliating things on purpose because she got some sick thrill out of it. Maybe she was just trying to get a rise out of him, or maybe she really liked hearing herself spout weird-sounding bullshit. Whatever, he thought. If I&#39;ve gotta climb and crawl to get my manhood back, so be it. He came up to the first waterfall and tried to pull himself up with just his arms; but here the flow of water was too strong for that, and so he next tried swimming against it. In the end, it took a combination of a swimming start, the best leap he could manage over such as short distance, and frantic pulling with his arms and flopping with his tail—and that was just to get up the first waterfall. Two more to go. He struggled, and he struggled again, and at last he belly-flopped into the uppermost tub and landed next to Vanessa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, good boy!&quot; she said delightedly. &quot;Now come to mistress and get your reward.&quot; Chad moved to take the bracelet, but Vanessa stopped him, kissed him, and said, &quot;Ah-ah, not just yet. First let&#39;s get you really good and excited first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, thought Chad. Oh, no.<br />
<br />
And so Vanessa initiated another round of one-sided love-making with her merman boy-toy, using ever trick she knew to drive his level of arousal to a horny, frustrating brink, while at the same time using Chad&#39;s body to make herself wet and ready. She kissed Chad all over and bade him do the same, and she rubbed her breasts against his chest, and down his abs, and up down the front of his tail as if to simulate a titfuck for Chad&#39;s nonexistent dick. She stripped herself of her bikini-bottom and humped the front of his tail, grinding her clit and her labia against his fish-scales, making herself dripping wet with arousal and causing Chad to groan in a haze of vexing, unending horniness.<br />
<br />
And just when Chad was certain that he couldn&#39;t take anymore, Vanessa snatched up the golden bracelet from the side of the tub and slipped it onto Chad&#39;s left wrist. Chad felt something in his core shift painfully, and he and Vanessa both looked down in awe and relief as the line of scales at Chad&#39;s waist shrank down his body a further handspan, so that his fishtail now began not right at his waistline, but just beneath his buttocks in the back—and just beneath his cock in the front. Chad&#39;s ballsack was still absent, his testicles remaining internal to his fishtail, but he had his penis back at long last! The base of his cock was surrounded by bare human skin above and to either side (no sign of any pubic hair); and by the line where his fish-scales started just below, at the spot where his scrotum should have been. There was still no sign of thighs or any bifurcation to his tail, no gap that led from front to back. And it was similar from the other direction: his buttocks were two separate cheeks again, and bare-skinned; but in between them, the flesh was filled in and featureless: Chad still didn&#39;t have a human asshole, and his taint was buried under fish-scales along with his testes.<br />
<br />
All of that, Vanessa and Chad quickly discerned from a few brief and discreet explorations. When Vanessa saw the results of the transformation, she said, &quot;I think you&#39;re almost perfect now,&quot; while at the same time squeezing his ass-cheeks and making a very obvious point of not yet touching his painfully stiff, eagerly awaiting cock. &quot;If only you could talk to me, and tell me what your life under the sea was like before you came to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, brother, thought Chad, if only. Did this batty broad somehow actually think that he was in fact a &quot;genuine&quot; merman who had been captured from the sea and delivered into her custody? Or was she just engaging in some one-sided role-playing, and really getting into the fantasy? Chad didn&#39;t know. Chad didn&#39;t care, particularly when he felt Vanessa&#39;s fingers wrap around his shaft and stroke him. God damn, after a months&#39;-log dry-spell, that was almost enough to make him cum right then and there.<br />
<br />
But the middle-aged woman was more skilled than that, and she didn&#39;t let him off the hook so easily. No, she took her time, and drove Chad to new heights of ecstasy that he had never really imagined before. In fact, in a weird way, Chad was starting to get into the fantasy too, and he was kind of starting to hate himself for it. By the time Vanessa was riding Chad in the grotto-tub and pumping up and down on his cock, he was groping at her tits and slapping her ass with the flukes of his fishtail, and they were both on cloud nine and the brink of climaxing together. &quot;Cum for me, fishboy!&quot; shouted Vanessa as Chad cut loose and filled her with seed, &quot;Use that cock before I take it away again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Even as Vanessa was quaking with her own orgasm on top of him, Chad felt his veins turn to ice upon hearing Vanessa&#39;s words. She wouldn&#39;t . . . couldn&#39;t do that to him, surely. Surely not now that he had finally gotten his manhood back at long, long last. Surely, Chad hoped and prayed, this bracelet was stuck to him just like the necklace, and he wouldn&#39;t be forced back into his dickless and assless, scales-up-to-the-waist merman form. Right?</p>
