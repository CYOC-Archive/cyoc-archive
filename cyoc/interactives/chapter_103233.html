<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What makes you think I agree with this?&quot; Time asked in despair.<br />
 <br />
Nothing. I know you don&#39;t agree, but you don&#39;t get a choice. I do.<br />
 <br />
&quot;You&#39;re no fun. Hopefully Diana treats me better.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Off with you. But only one I spend the rest of this segment explaining the <i>all too tragic</i> backstory of this character.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Fun.&quot;  Time sighed sarcastically.<br />
 <br />
We start when he was a kid, about the age of 15.<br />
 <br />
&quot;You have a weird perception on what are kids are.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Just shut up, alright?<br />
 <br />
&quot;Yesh, no need to get hasty.&quot;<br />
 <br />
As I was saying before I got RUDELY INTERRUPTED, when he was 15 his family was killed in front of him.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Talk about cliché.&quot;<br />
 <br />
SHUT UP WOULD YOU? I&#39;m trying to explain you backstory.<br />
 <br />
&quot;You mean the backstory you&#39;re making up on the spot?&quot;<br />
 <br />
No. The backstory I&#39;ve created with the well over 5 extra hours of awake-edness I get at night.<br />
 <br />
&quot;That&#39;s not even a word.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Is now. <b>Anyways</b>, he saw his family and everyone he loves get killed, not to soon after that, he found a way to enter and travel thrgh the mutiverse.<br />
 <br />
&quot;THE CLICHÉ IS KILLING ME.&quot;<br />
 <br />
If you don&#39;t shut up I litterally will kill you.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Try me.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Don&#39;t test me.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Testing testing, 1 2 3.&quot;<br />
 <br />
<i>Suddenly out of nowhere, TIME felt an excruciating pain. One that hurt more than he&#39;s ever felt before. It felt like he was slowly being blown apart from the inside out.</i><br />
 <br />
&quot;Agh, I get it I get it. Fine I&#39;ll,  I&#39;ll stop.&quot; Time exclaimed, feeling the pain start to leave at the words.<br />
 <br />
Leave it that way. Intetupt me again and I will not hesitate to kill you. AS I WAS SAYING, he found a way to travel through and harness the power of the multiverse, but this came at a cost, he became immortal. BIOLOGICALLY, immortal. Meaning he won&#39;t age. You may be thinking, &#39;Well how is that a bad thing? He&#39;ll love forever.&#39;. You&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s a terrible thing once you get to thinking. He wouldn&#39;t be able to make any friends because he would outlive them. He didn&#39;t want to watch someone he cares about die in his arms AGAIN so he travels alone.<br />
 <br />
&quot;You make it sound like a minor annoyance...&quot; Time interjected with a calm rage that would give even The Doctor nightmares. &quot;Maybe once Diana reads this she&#39;ll realize how much like YOU I am. How much you&#39;ve made me resemble you. The likes, the dislikes, the fears, the thoughts, the SASS.&quot;<br />
 <br />
<i>And it started again. The pain. It came back with it&#39;s steadily increasing strength. TIME lurched over, much to his despair, there was no table to lean against, as he was on a empty void. It just kept getting stronger and stronger, and worse and worse. But what came next was unexpected to the reader, Time flickered, like a light that&#39;s about to burn out. This just added to the pain because every time he flicked back in the pain was twice as strong as the last. By now he just wanted to die. The pain had gotten to impossible levels, but still somehow got worse. He just wanted to end it all and give up. To curl up into a ball and die. And soon his wish shal be granted. He started to increase is size rapidly. Getting twice his size, four times his size, eight times his size, all happening in the blink of an eye. Then he blew up. It didn&#39;t matter where you looked, you could still see part of him. He was dead, for now...</i><br />
 <br />
Anyways, now I can continue. He didn&#39;t want some one he cared about to die in his arms again so he travelled the multiverse alone for so long even I&#39;ve lost count of the centuries. All the universes he&#39;s seen die, all the new ones created in their place, he&#39;s seen universes where nothing formed because there was too much dark matter pushing everything apart, he&#39;s seen universes where people evolved from birds instead of monkeys, he&#39;s seen things You can&#39;t even imagine. But how many universes died because of his actions? How many universes no longer exsist because of him? I&#39;ve lost count of those as well, he carries around the weight of an uncountable amount of deaths on his shoulders. It haunts him. And it always will. But let&#39;s look on the bright side. How many universe still exsist thanks to him? How many universes are still there because he opted to let Hitler stay in art school? How many universes are still going on because he stoped Bush from being elected president? How many lives did he save? Does it outweigh the deaths? Who knows. There is no number big enough. Dispite all this He still stayed happy, or at least acted happy. He never liked going into universes with magic in thrm beause his main mode of transport is physics. If the physics of a universe are replaced with magic, then he gets stuck. Luckily, this universe still has fairly solid grounding the the scientific field. So he can still move about, so long as he doesn&#39;t break the rules of a multiverse explorer. These rules are,<br />
<br />
1. Not coming in direct contact with anything old and powerful. This is especially present in ancient charms. I.E. Excalibur.<br />
<br />
2. No coming in direct contact with another you. This will cause you both to be remove from the multiverse forever.<br />
<br />
3. Do not stay in the void for more than 5 hours. This will erase you from the multiverse forever.<br />
<br />
4. 42.<br />
5. Never show a work of literature to the universe that sprung off it. This will kill the universe.<br />
<br />
6. Do not ask &#39;What is outside the multiverse?&#39;. This is like asking what is outside the outside. It&#39;s annoying.<br />
<br />
7. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT, move too much mass out of a universe without putting it into a universe. This will end everything. Multiverse included.<br />
 <br />
All but the last one he found out by trial and error. Don&#39;t ask how he figured out the last one, he doesn&#39;t know. But Alas, my time is drawing to an end. Let me set a few things up for Diana then I&#39;ll be in my way.<br />
 <br />
<i>It was like magic. Time found himself back in the room where he meet Deena, Milly, and Sandra. It was confusing. He could have sword he had died at his authors words. He remembers is clearly, the pain, the blowing to pieces, but it must have just been a bad thought. But, alas, he will read this and know it was not. Even though he was back before Sandra whisked him away to read about her past. Deena and Milly don&#39;t remember a thing, because for them, it never happened. For Sandra, she&#39;ll read this and know it happened, but not remember any of it. It was like everything amwas paused at the Dade out of Time, and now it has unpaused and he&#39;s just snaped out of his distant thoughts.</i><br />
 <br />
Good luck Diana. You&#39;d better keep him under tabs. He&#39;ll mess everything up when you&#39;re not looking.</p>
