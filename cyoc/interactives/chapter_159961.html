<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">still holding out the fruit to John that to her surprise, she refused the fruit as she shook her head side to side to say no, even though John had the option of saying it. Carrie was surprised that what shocked her more while she stopped was this revelation of her husband wanting this. he actually looked happy about it that John began to wag his new tail around, as if it was a dogs while Carrie was thinking about what had happened to her husband when her book sucked John in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? John, Are you sure? You really want to be like this for the rest of your life?&quot; Carrie asked her that John sat down next to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;it&#39;s only temporally, or at least that&#39;s what they say here. still, its not every day you find yourself walking around in the opposite sex while becoming a toon version of your sweetheart&#39;s drawing. what i&#39;m trying to say is, I want to spend some time with this cute body I got here as I want to try what being being a girl really means. until I change back however, it&#39;s Jessica now.&quot; John said for it was now now Jessica that Carrie seen her nodded in response before she told her how she felt on being a woman, instead of returning back to being a man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I can relate to what you&#39;re saying about wanting to try out being the opposite sex, Jessica. I mean, I know you look amazing as you might even be cuter like this then me that the boys won&#39;t keep their eyes off of you. that being said, won&#39;t it be difficult being, well... a giraffe as you&#39;re also in a girl&#39;s body? an anthro giraffe girl?&quot; Carrie said as Jessica gently lifted her hands up to her cup breast when she then play a bit with her black colored bangs while finding her new her was silky, and long that it reached down to the edge of her tailbone would of been and where her small tall she has now begins.<br />
<br />
&quot;well, I suppose it&#39;ll take some getting used to. still, as long your around by me while helping out with this that you could say we&#39;re still in this thing together.&quot; Jessica said that to Carrie&#39;s surprise, she actually shrugged her shoulders off about this in response for it was as if Jessica was saying she didn&#39;t really mind the issue at hand at all.<br />
<br />
Carrie was surprised by her response, but she soon realized that she could suddenly interpret animal&#39;s gestures so well all of a sudden when a white bunny decided to hop on by. She usually could only guess what an animal was trying to do, yet she wasn&#39;t able to translate small gestures like this and turning it into a complete sentence before that she thought Perhaps it was a secondary result of what the gambler fruit did to them. however, this was hardly important to her right now as there were even more important things to think about that the fact Jessica seemed to be more comfortable on being her drawing of a female anthro giraffe girl companion then what she was on being her husband did concerned her at first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess it&#39;s alright then, so long as you&#39;re ok with this that is.&quot; Said Carrie while pondering the situation they were now in, yet as she was lost in thought about what to do that she didn&#39;t pay mush attention on to where she was walking and tripped over their suitcases while also dropping the fruit on the ground in the process. with The force of her bumping into the suitcases caused her to undo the lock on Jessica&#39;s case that it opened up to reveal instead of what John would of had originally packed were now replaced with makeup, jewellery, and most of her new clothing as her undergarment went flying everywhere for this made Jessica blush red while wanting to scream and hide them back in her suitcase.<br />
<br />
thankfully though, no one noticed how her things went flying out of her briefcase as she quickly tucked her supplies back in. Carrie told Jessica that this was convenient for her as she thought this was appropriate though, saying it might be a sign of her actually be more suited to be better like this. to this response that she happily jumped with joy a bit as she shortly after hugged her wife when her foot kicked the fruit away from them hard enough to send the partially eaten fruit down a nearby hole, where it hit something underground.<br />
<br />
still wagging her tail that soon after, a small gambler oak sapling emerged from where it had fell into. With the fruit now gone that a decision was clearly made for they walked over to the greatly amused kiosk worker. Carrie asked him if there was away to make the changes permanent, while leaving out why as she wanted to prevent it from happening to her husband who is now an anthro giraffe girl. to this response however, the toon simply told her that the only way for this to happen was to have her be impregnate by another guy while also saying it didn&#39;t had to be a toon.<br />
<br />
&quot;well Jessica, where should we go for our honeymoon?&quot; Carrie asked Jessica that after she went over to their suitcases and picked them up, even though they felt light weight to her now is when she perked up her ears to something. In a response, Jessica happily pointed to a direction with her head as a pointer while saying to go this way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, excuse me. can you tell me what&#39;s in the direction that she&#39;s pointing to, with her head?&quot; Carrie said to the kiosk worker, the toon then looked at the cutest giraffe girl as the toon smiled while telling them what lies beyond that direction. what did the toon tell them that was over there?</p>
