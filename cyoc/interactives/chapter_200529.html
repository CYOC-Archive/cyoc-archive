<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan looked at Jeremy with intense fear. Somehow they had turned into duplicates of Jared and reality had altered again. But were they really stuck like this? &quot;Where are you going young man?&quot; a voice from outside bellowed. &quot;I was going to play outside with Ryan and Jeremy,&quot; they heard Jared say. They assumed he had also stripped at this point due to the disapproval they heard from the voice. &quot;Sorry but you have to go put some clothes on,&quot; the voice said again. The voice sounded familiar to the brothers but they were unable to place it. <br />
<br />
&quot;But Ryan and Jeremey are naked too!&quot; Jared said as he began to protest, &quot;That&#39;s not fair! Go see for yourself.&quot; Rapidly some footsteps could be heard approaching the door before it was opened forcefully revealing the figure. It was their Father. Except he looked much younger than they remember. He also was much bigger now towering over the two brothers. &quot;What are the two of you doing in the guest room?&quot; he asked them.<br />
<br />
&quot;The guest room?&quot; they both said surprised. They passed their fathers legs to see their room had become an empty room except for a single bed. The room was also much more plain and in fact looked somewhat new. What had happened this time?<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay now go get dressed then you can play outside.&quot; Their father stated shooing them out of the room. Jeremy and Ryan looked at each other before they made way to Jared&#39;s old room. If their old room wasn&#39;t theirs anymore it only made sense they would be sharing one as triplets. They assumed correctly as they found Jared&#39;s room now containing three beds placed side by side with much more toys and clothes than they remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what happened this time?&quot; Jeremy asked Ryan as they made way to the dresser where they assumed all their clothes were stored. He opened a drawer and started to take clothes out he would assume made a decent oufit for a five year old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so obviously reality altered so that we&#39;re triplets now with Jared. But I think it also made us go back in time to when we were five.&quot; Ryan said as he put on a pair of red briefs. He quickly donned some jeans and a shirt with a cartoon figure he couldn&#39;t recognize before he turned around to see Jeremy with a look of shock. &quot;Wait... how do you know that?&quot; Jeremy asked.<br />
<br />
Ryan pointed at the calendar on the wall. Just as he had said, they were 11 years in the past. Suddenly the door slammed open as Jared ran inside. His face was red as if he was incredibly angry. &quot;You guys suck! I can&#39;t believe you got me in trouble&quot; he said as he ran alongside them and glared. Jeremy also realized how weird it was to be at eye-level with Jared. After all, he had always been nearly eleven years older than him. Now they were the same age which added more to the mind fuck he was experiencing. After the three of them had finished getting dressed, they made their way down the stairs. Jared ran past them toward the back door while the two leered behind talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so now what do we do?&quot; Jeremy asked Ryan, which slightly annoyed him. He knew he was still the older brother a, even if reality had altered a few times, and due to this he was used to Jeremy always asking for his guidance.<br />
But it was getting irritating having to answer Jeremy&#39;s questions all the time when he also  had no idea on what was happening!!! &quot;Ok maybe we just need to wait til tomorrow to see if our powers work&quot; Ryan told Jeremy &quot;Worst Case Scenario: We&#39;re Stuck Looking Like Jared And Have To Grow Up Again. Best Case Scenario: We get our power back, touch each other, and turn back to normal&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jeremy still had a worried expression but that soon faded when they went outside. The brother found their backyard transformed back to their old childhood layout. It was exactly as they remembered. Lost in nostalgia, the brothers found themselves quickly forgetting their troubles as they play with Jared, which was much more enjoyable when they were the same age, and soon found it was time to head inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok the tub is ready&quot; Their Mom said &quot;Come back downstairs when you&#39;re ready for dinner&quot;. The brothers ran upstairs to the bathroom. &quot;Wait...all of us?&quot; Jeremy said as he realized the situation. &quot;Obviously&quot; Jared said with a snicker as if Jeremy was completely accustomed to it. Ryan followed along with Jared&#39;s stride and realized how odd it was to see all three of them exactly with the same body side by side. Slightly feeling embarrassed and humiliated that his physique now matched his youngest brother Ryan hoped they could turn back to normal tomorrow. They quickly bathed and had dinner.<br />
<br />
As they settled into their pajamas that night, Jeremy and Ryan looked as each other before climbing into their respective beds. Tomorrow was Sunday and also their only hope in seeing if their powers returned, if not they would be stuck looking as Jared forever. The next morning...</p>
