<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(AN: You're always on time while I keep being unable to keep a time table. I apologize for <br />
that.) <br />
<br />
Julie thought. If she tried to run, the wolves would block her escape. If she tried to fight, <br />
the two police trained she-wolves would break her arms and legs. And her husband would <br />
still belong to this 'Master' or may or may not be as evil as she had first feared (and whom <br />
Fran was implying their conversion was even an accident), and they'd still have her <br />
daughters. <br />
<br />
She grabbed the bat and took one swing down on Alice squarely down the middle. The bat <br />
stung in her hands and clattered to the floor, now having a perfect impression of Alice's <br />
head on it like an side view outline. <br />
<br />
Abbey and Samantha also gasped. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Aunt Julie,&quot; Alice curtsied, &quot;I am indestructible.&quot;<br />
<br />
The twins felt shock and aggression for Julie's attempt to harm Alice but it was the object <br />
of her attack herself who spoke first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not be angry Mother, Aunt Fran. Aunt Julie is not in her right mind, that is all.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The twins thought of Mr. P, Marcy, and Kevin, and understood. <br />
<br />
Julie felt like this was someone's sick joke, she had come prepared to smash the head in of <br />
the mirror thing that had stolen her babies, and now found out it had been a hopeless <br />
quest from the start, it stank of someone or something bloody cheating. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's not fair.&quot; Julie lamented almost silently to herself, knowing what a nonsense set of <br />
words it was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Life is not fair Aunt Julie.&quot; Alice said simply putting a comforting paw on the shoulder of <br />
the woman who had just tried to kill her. <br />
<br />
Julie looked at Alice, what had been her girls, what had been Frank, and apparently what <br />
had been Daryl.  'What do I have left to lose?' <br />
<br />
&quot;Do it.&quot; Julie groaned. <br />
<br />
The twins nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do not bother answering Dare Aunt Julie, you will just be Dared to answer Transform <br />
next.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's cheating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I verily agree Aunt Julie, it is quite nonsense, but I am told the witches who started the <br />
game quite enjoyed nonsense so it makes sense that it is nonsense.&quot; <br />
<br />
Julie looked at what had been her husband, &quot;Just do it.&quot;  'Madam Serenity, please, you and <br />
Trevor are going to be my family's only hope now.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare?&quot; Fran asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform.&quot; Julie breathed out. <br />
<br />
Fran only made a half hearted attempt to hide her glee. Abbey and Samantha looked on <br />
excited. <br />
<br />
&quot;You will become our identical triplet Julie, and we, all three of us, you me, and Darla, shall <br />
be triplets in mind, body, soul and spirit.&nbsp;All three of us members of the Big Bad Wolf Pack.  <br />
We shall act the same, look the same, think the same, feel the same, be the same.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
'That's not how real triplets act.' Julie thought agitated.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will have all the vast medical knowledge and skill to be the long term doctor to all <br />
the pack in treating injuries, tending to sickness, and caring for the pregnancies, births <br />
and newborn care of our kind the Big Bad Wolf Pack.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You will love, serve, and obey Our Master.&nbsp; You are totally submissive to all his needs and <br />
wants. When he's not available&nbsp; you will listen to Kaylee as his Alpha Female.&nbsp; Your loyalty <br />
and adoration of Our Master: your&nbsp; lord and master, is unbreakable and unquestionable. <br />
You will use the Transform or Dare&nbsp; only to further Master's pack.   You will be loyal and <br />
true to the pack and to your pack mates.&quot; <br />
<br />
And with that. Julie's fate was sealed. <br />
<br />
Dirty blond fur began to grow on her body as her children and Alice looked on like <br />
children seeing Disneyland for the first time. Julie saw her hair turn the same dirty blond <br />
color and grow out in a matter of moments to the same length as the she-wolves around <br />
her.<br />
<br />
  Her shoes and socks became uncomfortable as her feet twisted into the wrong shapes. <br />
Darla actually came behind her and gently pulled the shoes and socks off her warping feet <br />
as they became digigrated as her nails became non-retractable claws. <br />
<br />
&quot;There there,&quot; Said Darla in the kind warm voice she had always known Frank to have. <br />
<br />
&quot;It'll be over soon dear.&quot; Said Fran in the same tone. <br />
<br />
Julie felt her muscle mass increase, bulging underneath her skin and fur, then increasing <br />
again, her body's length increasing as well. That wasn't the only thing increasing as she <br />
felt her bra become snug, then tight, then constraining, and finally almost cutting into her <br />
skin. Julie still hesitated to removing it. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay dear.&quot; Said Darla. <br />
<br />
&quot;We're all ladies and all naked and free her anyway.&quot; Assured Fran as they calmly and <br />
carefully removed Julie's jacket, then her shirt, and finally TORE OFF her bra with their <br />
claws cleanly, her entire torso now covered in the same pattern of dirty blond fur as they <br />
were. Her breast had grown to a C-Cup and was still growing. &quot;Your Master is a pervert.&quot; <br />
Julie managed to shoot off eyes on her increasing chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's actually just how we filled out naturally dear.&quot; Said the twin together. <br />
<br />
Julie felt like she was in some badly written fantasy comedy were the man turned into the <br />
woman always had the biggest bust line. <br />
<br />
Julie's legs no longer resembled anything human, and her hands were warping into clawed <br />
paws with opposable thumbs, not looking like a mix of wolf and human but more like if <br />
wolves had become the tool users instead. <br />
<br />
Julie moaned in pain and shuddered as she felt something pushing it's way out of her <br />
spine. Without hesitation Abbey and Samantha came along her sides and pulled down her <br />
skirt and then pulled down on her panties as if they were nothing important. Julie <br />
shuddered, her girls had never been ones to run around naked and had loved their <br />
dresses, now they didn't seem to mind that they were going around naked in the least. <br />
<br />
Julie saw what she knew she'd see, a giant wolf's tail the same color as the rest of her fur. <br />
Then her ears became triangular and moved to the top of her head as face as if it was <br />
rubber pulled foreword her mouth and nose becoming one as her teeth all became canines <br />
and fangs meant for devouring flesh and bones and little else.  Her sense of smell and <br />
sense of hears exploded as she could now smell Darla and Fran and knew they smelled <br />
exactly alike. Alice and her daughters had no smell at all. Like they were ghosts.  She didn't <br />
see it but her eyes became bright blue. <br />
<br />
Darla and Fran helped her up as her body and features continued to grow, until she stood <br />
as tall and oversized as they were, her musculature mass easily supporting the extra <br />
weight, the entire world seemed to fall beneath her as she stood seven feet tall, she also <br />
found the new globes on her chest made it rather impossible to see her own feet. <br />
<br />
Alice and her cousins/half-sisters calmly gathered and looked at the three perfectly <br />
identical she wolves, impossible to tell apart, almost, one of them didn't have the same <br />
mannerisms and body language as the other two, but that was about to change. <br />
<br />
Julie was going to ask if that was it when she thought of Master who she didn't know but <br />
knew she loved dearly, and thought of her pack mates whom she didn't know either but <br />
knew as day was light and night was dark that they were her family to look out and protect <br />
as they would with her! She thought how overjoyed Fran and Darla were that she was now <br />
finally part of the pack and their family was finally united and back together again!  She <br />
was overjoyed she was now finally part of the pack and their family was finally united and <br />
back together again!  She felt her love of Abbey and Samantha, and of course Alice.  Abbey <br />
her daughter. Samantha Fran's daughter. And Alice Darla's daughter.  Still she loved each <br />
as if they were her own child.   Julie righted her as she stood properly next to Fran and <br />
Darla, no longer her husband and friend, but her sisters, and that was more than enough! <br />
<br />
Alice and the girls watched with growing energy as the third blond she wolves' <br />
mannerisms became a mirror reflection of the other two and theirs of hers. <br />
<br />
Darla thought, and so they all thought, how it was almost regretful she wasn't loved the <br />
way she loved both Fran and Julie, and so the triplets felt a pang of sadness at this.   It was <br />
as if a dam broke next and Fran and Julie felt the same love towards Darla as they had felt <br />
towards each other.  The triangle was complete. The pyramid was whole. <br />
<br />
Julie took one shoulder of Fran and Darla as her sisters did the same: they all said together <br />
in the same excited voice, &quot;We really are identical now! We really are the same now! We're <br />
finally whole!&quot; <br />
<br />
The triplets as they were now hugged each other tightly their tails wagging back and forth <br />
as their maternal material smooshed into each other now being on equal levels, all three <br />
fully enjoying the feeling of their bodies touching each other.  The three howled together. <br />
Alice and her cousins joined in a second later. <br />
<br />
The triplets rested their paws on each other's rears leaning into each other, just drinking in <br />
the feeling of being together, a sense of unity and completion the likes of which they had <br />
never felt before, and how did they love each other, oh how did they love each other. <br />
<br />
They stayed that way for several minutes, the glass pups beginning to get bored as they <br />
finally broke apart.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope Master finds us still desirable even though there's three of us now dears.&quot; Julie <br />
said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry honey.&quot; Fran began. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes honey,&quot; Darla nodded, &quot;Master we're completely sure will still desire us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I'm completely sure!&quot; Julie laughed. <br />
<br />
The  triplets then looked at their daughters and said together, &quot;Come along dear, it's time <br />
to go home.&quot;  Julie then added, &quot;It'll be a first time for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We still have to gather some things from my apartment assuming it hasn't been all <br />
thrown out by now.&quot; Darla said. <br />
<br />
&quot;And at our house too before that happens.&quot; Fran finished. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, with our help that'll be easy peasy.&quot; Samantha said confidently. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know it will be.&quot; Fran nodded, Darla and Julie nodded in agreement. <br />
<br />
Each mother took the hand of their respective child. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait till you see what we can do now moma!&quot; Abbey said excitedly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then why don't you go first dear?&quot; Fran suggested. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Abbey nodded confidently as she pulled her mother along out of the light and into <br />
the darkness, and in front of a large mirror delivered to the warehouse just that day. <br />
<br />
Darla and Fran felt Julie's surprise as Abbey walked right through the mirror as if it was <br />
water on it's side still pulling along her mother.  Alice pulled along Darla and Samantha <br />
with Fran as they all entered the mirror, leaving the warehouse silent and empty. <br />
<br />
Julie was perhaps even more surprised when she found herself being pulled along by a <br />
flesh and blood wolf pup on the other side of the mirror with long blond hair where in the <br />
real world she had been 'balled.' Abbey was also wearing a white dress with a blue <br />
decorative apron with an obvious opening for her tail. <br />
<br />
Julie looked behind to see Samantha looking just the same with the same dress, while <br />
Alice was two and a half years older than her cousins with a blue dress with white trim. <br />
<br />
Julie started as she finally focused on her own sisters and realized they were wearing <br />
victorian era clothing of their own, with Fran's purple and red while Darla's was red and <br />
purple. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sister.&quot; The two triplets pointed. <br />
<br />
Julie looked down and saw she was in the same dress as her triplets, only hers was a <br />
completely different color. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm starting to think whoever made this Game really liked the color green.&quot; Alice <br />
commented seeing the bright green dress with white trim her aunt was wearing. <br />
<br />
The lack of symmetry in color made Julie somewhat uncomfortable in wearing the dress, <br />
but at the same time, she felt it would be much worse not to wear it. While in the real <br />
world she felt all her inhibitions and modesty to be gone with the wind: in here in this <br />
mirrorverse, this dress felt, natural for her to be wearing. <br />
<br />
&quot;So in this world... you're alive?&quot; Julie asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Myself, Abbey and Samantha, are always alive.&quot; Alice spoke politely, and kindly, &quot;It is just <br />
inside this world inside the mirrors that we need to eat and sleep, we do not need to in the <br />
least in the universe outside this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean the real world?&quot; Julie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This world is real is it not? It is here is it not? We are here are we not? How is it not real?&quot; <br />
Alice asked simply.<br />
<br />
Julie blinked at being verbally routed by a seven and a half year old. <br />
<br />
Alice then snapped her fingers, &quot;Almost forgot!&quot; Alice let go of Darla and ran back out the <br />
mirror and came back a few seconds later holding Julie's discarded clothes and purse, <br />
&quot;Can't go leaving these around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darla rubbed Alice's head and gently gave her a hug, &quot;That's my girl!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Come.&quot; Fran said, &quot;We need to tell Master that we don't need to relocate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relocate?&quot; Julie asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;When we thought the woman with you was a witch,&quot; Darla explained, &quot;Master selected a <br />
deserted island in international waters to move the entire pack to so our pack wouldn't be <br />
broken up by being reverted back.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Julie nodded, &quot;Then it's good you made me part of the family again before that <br />
happened or we might have never seen each other again!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Said Darla and Fran, &quot;Very good.&quot; <br />
<br />
Other children might have been crept out by the triplicate behavior of their parents, but <br />
for Alice, Samantha and Abbey, there was nothing to it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you both remember where the estate is?&quot; Alice asked her cousins. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; They answered together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Estate?&quot; Julie asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;We all lives at the Smiths now.&quot; Fran said. <br />
<br />
&quot;You'll love it.&quot; Darla nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure I will.&quot; Julie nodded in turn. <br />
<br />
&quot;You sure you guys can do it on your own this time?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bet!&quot; Abbey declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'll be easy.&quot; Samantha nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;What will be?&quot; Julie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just you watch sister!&quot; Fran giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the fun part.&quot; Darla giggled too.<br />
<br />
Alice spoke, &quot;All right then, one step, two steps, and three!&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish we had time to buy a portable generator!&quot; Kaylee lamented thinking of her precious <br />
video games. <br />
<br />
&quot;It would just run out of fuel anyway.&quot; Jensen shrugged.<br />
<br />
Kaylee got a determined look in her eyes, &quot;Not if I had the click hook up bicycles and <br />
pedal!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;MASTER!&quot; Declared Fran stepping out of the mirror with Abbey leading her out. <br />
<br />
&quot;We have returned!&quot; Added Darla with Alice stepping out. <br />
<br />
&quot;How did it go?&quot; Jensen asked worried that the witch had got them. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are no longer twins!&quot; Happily declared the two. <br />
<br />
Then an identical she wolf stepped out being led by Abbey, &quot;We are triplets.&quot; Julie finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it's time to go.&quot; Jensen said surprisingly without any of the fanfare that should have <br />
been.  <br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Said the triplets together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master you don't need to!&quot;  Darla said, &quot;It turns out the woman who is helping, was <br />
helping Julie is no witch at all! She is merely a victim of the game who can sense when it is <br />
used!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; Jensen wondered. <br />
<br />
&quot;It true...&quot; Fran added. <br />
<br />
Kaylee looked relieved at not having to leave behind her precious creature comforts. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master? Alpha Female?&quot; Julie looked at the nine foot tall black male wolf and the seven <br />
foot tall reddish brown she wolf next to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Jensen asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's me.&quot; Kaylee nodded and pointed at herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;I love you!&quot; Julie leaped through the air and landed on Jensen, only not knocking him over <br />
due to his own massive strength, pressing her body against his. <br />
<br />
Jensen had to admit, it was very comfortable. <br />
<br />
&quot;So now we get to formally introduce Julie to the pack?&quot; Fran asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Abbey and Samantha too?&quot; Darla added.<br />
<br />
&quot;After a bit,&quot; Jensen said prying Julie off her for a bit. &quot;First, tell me every single thing you <br />
know about this -not witch.-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Master!&quot; Julie nodded eagerly happy to be of service and use to Master. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
A minute or so later a familiar fifty year old African woman stepped inside the church. <br />
Trevor of course recognized her instantly. Then a man in pastor's robes came out of he <br />
pack of the church to greet her. <br />
<br />
He was an unassuming, averaged, middle aged man . . . with a monkey's tail? <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings and Hello.&quot; Said the priest kindly, &quot;And you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Madam Serenity.&quot; Said the black woman calmly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. And you are here for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My cat of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
The father nodded, &quot;Sorry about that, I've had impostors pose as someone they were to get <br />
a hold of someone before after they reached sanctuary.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity of course saw it too, &quot;Are you a victim of the Game? Forgive me, but I happened <br />
to consider myself a trouble consultant on these things.&quot;<br />
<br />
The priest sighed, apparently having told this story before, &quot;Myself and my brother. An <br />
Atheist, Nihilist, or something I didn't really catch it at the time asked if I believed in <br />
evolution outside the chruch. I said there was nothing in the bible what so ever that <br />
actually contradicted it,  and she looked agitated and asked the game of both me and my <br />
brother the game. We both ended up choosing transform, she was disappointed in that, <br />
apparently she wanted me to walk in front of the mass naked and declared everything I <br />
ever said to be a lie. So instead she gave me the monkey's tail you see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... He's an orangoutang now. He kept his intellect and ability to say no to his instincts but <br />
the asker left a few unpleasant sub-clauses for him. They're rather private. He keeps <br />
himself mostly out of sight now. People seem to think my tail is normal so I eventually <br />
stopped trying to hide it, I'm surprised you noticed it as unnatural.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it's part of the same side effects that enable me to feel when the Game is used.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Side effects?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was once a Irishman.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As long as we're being open about secrets...&quot; Trevor groaned getting everyone's attention. <br />
Judas stared in surprised. <br />
<br />
&quot;The game?&quot; The priest asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The game.&quot; Trevor responded before Serenity could. <br />
<br />
~Amazing.~ Meow Judas. <br />
<br />
Trevor ignored the feline,  &quot;Serenity... I'm sorry.&quot; 'I'm a coward.' &quot;They got Abbey and <br />
Samantha.&quot;&nbsp; 'I am a coward.' <br />
<br />
Serenity slowly shook her head, &quot;They got Julie too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor worse than before. &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She called me and said how her girls were gone and a note on where to meet for them. ... <br />
She didn't say where since the note said to come alone. I tried to warn her that there was <br />
no way her daughters were still human but she wouldn't listen.   I felt the game being used <br />
a while later, I got the underlying feeling it was her somehow.&nbsp; I think if I knew the person <br />
before, I can sense when who it was who used the game or the game was used on. Since <br />
every use the game itself feels unique.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's more,&quot; Trevor said, &quot;I don't think Abbey and Samantha were changed with the <br />
game, I think they gave the power to change people to one of the harem.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;That would explain why I didn't sense them taking part in the game. More to worry <br />
about.&quot; Serenity sighed, &quot;Julie means the giant dogs now know where we live, and that we <br />
can't be changed due to our respective curses. There goes our element of surprise. And <br />
they can just come at midnight and kill us in our sleep.&quot; <br />
<br />
'I am a coward.'  &quot;We're screwed.&quot; <br />
<br />
 &quot;Oh it gets worse. Now they know the old man saw them too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Crude... &quot; Trevor cursed, they had to warn the old man before he needed a sexy she-wolf. <br />
'I am a coward.' <br />
<br />
&quot;It's possible still that Julie and her daughters will come back for their things and possibly <br />
try to clean up any legal loss ends. We might be able to catch them off guard there. Not <br />
that it would easier if we knew where they were too.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I am a coward.'  Trevor spoke, &quot;The Smiths! Serenity I saw it! .... the wolves are at the <br />
Smiths... and..&nbsp; There has to be over thirty of them!&nbsp;They're wolf people! Big and bad! From <br />
what I saw, they're rebuilding the place into a fortress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You found their scent?&quot; Serenity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Close enough.&quot; 'I am a coward.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you run into any trouble?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I talked with.. you're not going to believe this... but KIDS at the mansion who were wolf <br />
people too.&quot; 'I am a coward.' <br />
<br />
&quot;The owner of this harem must be truly degenerate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... don't think so... they didn't quite act like that... the point is, I asked them for some <br />
information, that's just about useless now... then this wolf the size of a bull came and ... <br />
these living glass wolves who I think used to be Abbey and Samantha recognized me. I <br />
ran, the monster followed me... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you didn't get out without a scratch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Queen was with me.&quot; 'I am a coward.' <br />
<br />
&quot;What? That cat who been pursuing you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... she actually helped me get in... and... she distracted the monster while I ran...&quot; <br />
'Because I am a coward.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe when we see her again-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Queen is dead.&quot; 'Because I am a coward.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor you don't know that. She could have gotten away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Disembodied heads don't get away.&quot; 'And I am a coward.' <br />
<br />
Serenity, and all present were stunned silent. <br />
<br />
Judas himself shuddered in horror. <br />
<br />
'Why...' Trevor thought, 'Why did she have to figured out JUST THEN what it meant to do <br />
something for someone other than number one?! Oh who I am I kidding, I have no clue <br />
why she did what she did. For all I know she figured out I was human and wanted to kill <br />
me in my sleep to 'purify the race.' I just don't know... Queen I'm sorry. You're dead <br />
because I am a coward.' <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care WHO started this horrid game or what reason,&quot; The priest said putting his face <br />
in his hand overwhelmed at the insanity he had just heard, &quot;This game is the work of the <br />
devil, I don't care who started it. It's evil.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think everyone agrees with you on that last part.&quot; Madam Serenity said. <br />
<br />
Trevor said, &quot;We need allies... and plenty of them.&quot;</p>
