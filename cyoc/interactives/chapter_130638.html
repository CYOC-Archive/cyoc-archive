<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stephen got to the party as people began to arrive. Nobody really noticed him. He went over to the keg and pulled himself a draft. Then he poster up on a chair with his laptop and began to watch as people began to loosen up and really party. <br />
<br />
Dylan or D-Rod as his frat bros called him was overlooking the party goers at a balcony at the front of the house. As he watched people stream in, he knew that this was going to be legendary. <br />
<br />
Stephen sat by himself. He watched as a tall Asian guy made his way up to a group of people. Stephen saw on his device that the man was named Dean Yang. He high-fived his friends Derrick and Paul and said hi to his friend Jenny who he had met last year in his psychology class. Jenny gestured to a quiet girl who had been standing next to her. <br />
<br />
Ashley wasn’t really in the partying mood. She didn’t know anybody there and had only shown up because Jenny had begged her. <br />
<br />
Dean tried to make an impression on her. He told jokes and stories that he thought made him look cool. He laughed loudly at his own chatter. Ashley was not impresssed.  She just balked at him. Finally he said, “Come on girl. I just want to get to know you.”  She scoffed rudely and she said, “It’s not gonna happen.”<br />
<br />
Derrick, Paul and Jenny all laughed at him. <br />
<br />
Dean gave up, got a beer and found a quiet seat. Then, he heard a guy he hadn’t noticed say, “Hey how are things going?”<br />
<br />
———————————————————-<br />
“I guess things are as good as can be expected.” I said. <br />
<br />
“I’m Stephen,” said the guy happily, holding out his hand.<br />
<br />
“Er, hi, I’m Dean,” I replied, shaking his hand distractedly. I thought about going back over to my friends. Even though I’d just bombed in front of them they weren’t as weird as this guy. <br />
<br />
He had a laptop on his knees, but I couldn’t quite make out the screen. It was like my eyes wouldn’t focus on it.<br />
<br />
A minute or so passed in awkward silence. Well, awkward for me. He was looking at me the whole time, and I was studiously avoiding his gaze.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” he eventually said. I inadvertently looked round, and into his eyes. His beautiful, beautiful eyes... “You’re quite good-looking,” he smirked, head titled to one side.<br />
<br />
I was rather taken aback. “Oh. Um. Thanks?” I wasn’t gay, and I didn’t want him to think I was, but I was looking into his eyes again...<br />
<br />
“No, you’re not gay. I know that. But you’re bisexual, right?” said Stephen. “Being bisexual is pretty cool.”<br />
<br />
Yeah, I thought. Being bisexual is cool. I was lucky to be bisexual. And to be seated next to such a good looking guy, of course. I felt a slight stiffening in my crotch.<br />
<br />
“Heh, being hard is cool too,” he said, looking into my eyes. Yeah, it so is. I’m proud of my erection, I thought as it ballooned to its full length down my thigh, shifting my body slightly so that it made more of a bulge.<br />
<br />
“It sure is,” I told him, noticing that he was hard too. I moved in slowly for a kiss, but he interrupted.<br />
<br />
“But what on earth are you wearing?” he said, leaning back, grinning faintly. “Being an exhibitionist is so cool. Why are you wearing so many clothes?”<br />
<br />
I paused for a second. “I don’t know,” I said, looking down at myself, confused. “I’ll strip if you will,” I winked at Josh, who smiled.<br />
“Sure thing.”<br />
<br />
We both quickly lost our shirts, and took a while getting our jeans, shoes and socks off. We were soon just in our underwear. Both of us wore boxer-briefs. They were cool, both of them tented from our erections. Unfortunately, Stephen’s was somewhat larger than mine.<br />
<br />
“Hey Dean,” he said, and I looked round at where he was pointing. “What do you think could be done to improve them?” He was gesturing at Derrick and Jenny who were chatting to each other. <br />
<br />
I leaned over on the couch deliberately resting against his bare torso. “I dunno,” I said. “Derrick’s fairly bland. I’ve seen him in the school showers. Bigger cock and ass are a must. And I dunno about Jenny. She’s a bit frigid I suppose.”<br />
<br />
There was some tapping on the laptop which I barely registered before Stephen replied. “Yeah, you’re right. Huge cocks and asses are cool. As is being a slut.”<br />
<br />
“Damn right,” I breathed. I knew my ten-incher was a keeper, and my giant bubble butt could turn anyone on. And I used it to its fullest advantage; I’d have sex with anything that made eye contact with me. <br />
<br />
Being a slut was cool.<br />
<br />
I idly pulled the tattered remains of my boxer briefs away from me and tossed them aside. They hadn’t been able to cope with my gorgeous ass and giant pulsing cock (I was always hard). I don’t know why I even put them on that morning, really.<br />
<br />
I glanced over at Derrick and Jenny mid stroke of my dick. Derrick seemed to have had the same problem as me, his huge black ass (larger than mine by a fair bit) and massive, flopping dick had torn his jeans apart at the seams, and his underwear was nowhere to be seen.<br />
<br />
Watching him try to cover himself up, I wondered how big his ass was. Each cheek’s larger than a melon, easy, I thought. His attempts at covering himself up were pretty much in vain. He’d need a lot of hands to do that. And things weren’t helped by a half-naked Jenny determinedly trying to lick his penis. <br />
<br />
She seemed obsessed. It was quite hot, really. Eventually she got the better of him and managed to get the tip of his cock in her mouth, which rapidly expanded. When Derrick realised that no one seemed to mind what was happening, he started fucking her face in earnest.<br />
<br />
And thinking of that, I looked down at Stephen’s package again, and leaned in to suck it, but he interrupted. Again.<br />
“And them, Dean?” he said, nodding towards the pair standing next to Derrick and Jenny. He adjusted his cock, and I licked my lips.<br />
<br />
“Dunno. Paul being a prostitute would be cool. And Ashley acts way too smart. She needs to dumb down a bit,” I said, face in Stephen’s crotch.<br />
<br />
“You’re right. Being paid for sex is cool, and being stupid is extra cool,” he whispered, pushing my head down onto his now exposed hard dick.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it is, I thought. I’ve always been stoopid, and it turns me on so much. And people pay me for sex so I don’t need to have any smarts.<br />
<br />
“That’s right,” said Stephen. “Keep sucking. I’ll pay you good, you dumb shit.”<br />
I moaned and sucked harder. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Paul abandon Ashley and start walking across the party, probably to make some dough. <br />
<br />
His mesh shirt and tight crotch-less leather trousers made him look so hot. It’s was a shame Paul wouldn’t fuck around with other rent boys. And Ashley was sitting there vacantly staring at Derrick and Jenny, drooling slightly. Dumb people are hot.<br />
<br />
I was wanking my ten-incher, head bobbing up and down quickly on Stephen’s dick. Without warning, he came. And came. And came. There was too much to swallow, so I pulled off and was hit in the face by his cum. I drooled and moaned in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Stephen smirked. “Good boy,” he said, and handed me twenty bucks from his jeans on the floor. I smiled and took it, still wanking and fingering my hole. Stephen was completely naked now, and still hard. It was so distracting...</p>
