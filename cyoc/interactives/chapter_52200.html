<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You looked up at Julie and said, &quot;I want to be your daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie smiled and said, &quot;I was hoping you would say that. But are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure Mommy,&quot; you said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really see me as your mommy?&quot; Julie asked looking surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really do,&quot; you said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a sister,&quot; Mandy said hugging you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you do,&quot; Julie said. &quot;And Cassie since you do see me as your mommy you'll change to marble when you sleep. At least you may. I don't know if our transform will affect you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll just have to see,&quot; you said shrugging.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's a good thing Mrs. Cain can speed up the adoption process,&quot; Julie said sighing.<br />
<br />
Charlie came up and said, &quot;Well Matt is looking over the security recordings from last night. Fortunately we don't have to bring up that Amanda saw it as Matt always checks the recordings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's good,&quot; Julie said. &quot;I wasn't sure how we were going to explain her seeing it anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you can go about your business,&quot; Charlie said. &quot;What do you plan on doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well since Mandy just woke up and it's time for lunch we'll go get something to eat then we'll go from there,&quot; Julie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will I have to wear clothes?&quot; Mandy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Julie said. &quot;We'll get some lunch in the community but after that I'm not sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She doesn't like to wear clothes?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to remember that we've been nude marble statues for a long time,&quot; Julie said. &quot;Just as we grew use to being marble statues we grew use to being nude. Now we only wear clothes when it's socially necessary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; you said nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just be back before closing,&quot; Charlie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know Charlie,&quot; Julie said rolling her eyes. Then looking at you she said, &quot;I'm not going to tell you to take off your clothes but I think it would be a good idea. That way you should be able to get a bit use to being nude around others before having to take off your clothes to sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
You thought that over for a few moments. It did make sense and it was clothing optional here. &quot;Don't worry about your clothes,&quot; Charlie said. &quot;We have a room that you can put them in. Julie can take you to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; you said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on then,&quot; Julie said getting up.<br />
<br />
You followed Julie and Mandy into a room close by. There were a few lockers along a wall and a room with an electronic lock on it. Julie input a code and opened he door. Inside there was a wardrobe and a couple of dressers. &quot;Ok you can use the wardrobe and this dresser,&quot; Julie said putting a hand on one of the dressers. &quot;This one is Mandy's but she doesn't have that many clothes so there's plenty of room.&quot;<br />
<br />
You slowly took your clothes off as Julie took her's off. &quot;Come on sis don't be shy,&quot; Mandy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember Mandy that Cassie isn't use to her body yet,&quot; Julie said. &quot;So don't tease her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mommy,&quot; Mandy said.<br />
<br />
You hesitated taking off your panties but you knew that you would be waking up nude and people would be seeing you as a nude statue. Taking a deep breath you took off your panties. Julie took your hand and led you out. You clutched Alexia close to you feeling like everyone was watching you. Of course they weren't. The most they did was look at you and then looked away again. You couldn't help but look at the men's dicks sure that they would have an erection. To your surprise none of the ones you met had any erection. This puzzled you.<br />
<br />
When you got to the restaurant you found that nearly everyone was nude. The wait staff did wear aprons but that was about it. After eating you went to see a movie and after that you spent time in the park. By this time you had gotten at least a bit use to being out in the nude. You had decided to lay in the grass and you had to admit that it felt good. The breeze blowing across you also felt good. You hadn't expected this and you had to admit that no one stared at you. Being nude was oddly liberating. You stayed in the park for awhile and you even played with a couple other girls that Mandy introduced you too. You had wanted to stay but the time came to get some dinner then it was back to the Galleria.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok do either of you two need to use the restroom before you go to sleep?&quot; Julie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Mommy,&quot; you and Mandy said at the same time then giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then lets get situated,&quot; Julie said.<br />
<br />
You yawned as you followed Julie up to the pedestal. &quot;How do we turn to marble?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just decide to go to sleep,&quot; Julie said. &quot;Now I usually sit on the bench and Mandy usually stands though we do change our positions.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked at everyone walking past not looking up at you. &quot;Why aren't they looking at us?&quot; you asked as you continue to watch them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because they don't notice us,&quot; Julie said. &quot;Since they're not looking up at you that means our transform is affecting you. Now go ahead and pick a pose.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrugged and decided to lay down like you were looking up at the sky. When you did lay down you noticed that there was a skylight above you so you could look at the sky. Mandy sat down at your feet and looked up to the skylight too. Julie kissed her and then you. You heard the crumbling again and Mandy turned to marble. You took a breath and decided to go to sleep. The moment you decided that you felt a tingling sweep over you. You tried to move but you couldn't and you stopped breathing. You panicked a bit but then you remembered that stone doesn't breath. You couldn't move your eyes but you could still see. You could focus on anything that was in your field of vision though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well she definitely became marble,&quot; Charlie said somewhere near your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Julie said with a sigh. &quot;I'm happy that she did decide to become my daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
'So am I Mommy,' you tried to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you are Cassie,&quot; Julie said as if she could hear you.<br />
<br />
'You can hear me?' you asked.<br />
<br />
'Of course Mommy can hear you,' Mandy said. It wasn't a sound that came from outside like Julie and Charlie's voices were. Instead Mandy's voice was in your head.<br />
<br />
'Well this is weird,' you said.<br />
<br />
'Shouldn't be that weird for you,' Alexia said in your head. 'You are able to turn into glass after all. The only thing that's different is that you can't move.'<br />
<br />
'I know you two will be awake most of the night but please keep quiet so I can sleep,' Mandy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll see you in the morning Charlie,&quot; Julie said sitting down on the bench with a book in her hand. Soon she was also marble. 'Now people will notice us,' she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh look at this one Jeremy,&quot; a girl said. &quot;Don't they look happy?&quot; When she said that you realized that you had been smiling when you changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;They can't help but look happy Jenny,&quot; a guy you guessed was Jeremy said. &quot;The sculptor made them with smiles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that,&quot; Jenny said pouting a bit. You could just barely see her. &quot;They're so life like though that it's easy to think of them being happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you're right,&quot; Jeremy said. &quot;I've never really paid that much attention to how life like they were before.&quot;<br />
<br />
'He's seen you before,' you said starting to panic.<br />
<br />
'Don't worry Cassie,' Julie said soothingly. 'He only remembers three statues here in the same positions we are now.'<br />
<br />
'So he just thinks we're statues?' you asked.<br />
<br />
'Yes,' Julie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think the girls are looking at?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're not looking at anything,&quot; Jeremy said. &quot;They can't see anything since they're just marble statues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh do you have to ruin it for me?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You let your imagination run away with you,&quot; Jeremy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure this Bradley Thorpe let his imagination run away with him,&quot; Jenny said. &quot;How else could he have created this work of art?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you're right,&quot; Jeremy said. &quot;Lets hide out behind the statue until the Galleria closes then we can have some fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I'll be right back,' Julie said and woke up. Rising from her seat she stepped off the pedestal.<br />
<br />
Jenny looked a little nervous and then after a few quick glances around said, &quot;I don't think I could have sex with you with those girls here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're just statues,&quot; Jeremy said. &quot;Besides it might be fun doing it up there. Maybe they'll come to life and they can join in the fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're sick Jeremy,&quot; Jenny said with a look of disgust on her face.<br />
<br />
'Pervert,' you, Alexia, and Mandy said at the same time.<br />
<br />
Julie sat back down and turned to marble again. Once she did she asked, 'So why did you three yell?'<br />
<br />
Before any of you answered Jenny said in a raised voice, &quot;I can't believe you would consider having sex with children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep it down,&quot; Jeremy said urgently. &quot;You want me to go to jail?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me you two,&quot; Charlie said. &quot;I'm sure the police will be interested in hearing this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now look what you did you cunt,&quot; Jeremy said with anger in his voice.<br />
<br />
You saw a hand hit Jenny and then heard a scuffle. 'Charlie just tazed him,' Alexia said. 'Serves him right.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok ma'am?&quot; Charlie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so,&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; Charlie asked. &quot;He hit you pretty hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don't think anything's broken,&quot; Jenny said.<br />
<br />
Charlie called for a couple more guards to come help him move Jeremy.<br />
<br />
'I didn't think that would happen your first night here Cassie,' Julie said. 'I'm sorry that you had to hear that.'<br />
<br />
'Well hopefully he'll be in jail for a long time,' you said. 'Though I don't think he will be.'<br />
<br />
The rest of the time till close was uneventful and soon the lights were turned off. The Galleria became quiet and you stared at the stars watching them pass overhead.</p>
