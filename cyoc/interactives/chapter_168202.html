<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Terry observed Denise intently, curious to see how she finally reacts. Rather unsurprisingly, she simply began sobbing, the shock and anger proving too much to bear. Terry looks to the old man with a disappointed face. &quot;Hey old man, this kinda sucks! I mean look at her, she&#39;s a crying mess, that&#39;s not what I wanted!&quot; <br />
The old man chuckles. &quot;Heh, well we can fix this issue if you wish. Here, let me show you something&quot; and he grabs a device that looks like a small remote control from a cabinet in the back of the room. &quot;This here is the controller for the ADAM-01 biosuit. Basically we just need to link it to the unit Denise is wearing and we can adjust a variety of behavioral and even aesthetic options...&quot; <br />
While Denise still cried and mumbled curses laying down on the floor in a fetal position, the old man finished calibrating the remote and gave Terry an overview of the various commands. &quot;Here, with this setting here we can activate the suit&#39;s personality override...&quot; He pointed towards Denise and clicked. Suddenly she stopped crying, got up on her feet in a swift athletic motion. She simply stood there silently, back straight, looking at Terry serenely. <br />
&quot;Wow, she calmed down instantly, amazing...&quot; Terry comments. <br />
The old man then shows Terry the aesthetic preference options on the remote, telling him that the current appearance was simply one of a few variants available for the ADAM model. Since the suit&#39;s synthetic flesh is easily reshaped by nanites in a matter of seconds, you can toggle between the predefined appearances as often as you please without any risk of damaging the biosuit. <br />
Terry browsed through the various options and decided to select one of the African presets. He clicked on the desired picture and almost instantly the ADAM-01 morphed into a man with lean, defined musculature, a smoothly shaved head and the darkest skin tone he had ever seen, almost pitch black and with an almost bluish sheen. The face now had purebred and youthful south-Sudanese features. Terry always thought Denise was too pale anyway... well not anymore she isn&#39;t! &quot;From white girl to black man, eh?&quot; The old man commented, amused. &quot;You really got yourself a hell of a makeover Denise, here take a quick peek at your new face&quot; He raises a little round mirror up to Denise&#39;s face. When she sees her reflection, her plump new lips part into a wide, big smile with perfect white teeth. Her new masculine face seemed to light up with mirth and her handsome smile broadened even more as she felt and caressed her new features and her black, smooth and shiny head. &quot;No more need for makeup and hair care products!! From now on, just shaving cream and a good razor for me and I&#39;m good!! So much better this way!!&quot; She said, sounding liberated and incredibly happy. Her voice was now even deeper and with a distinct Sudanese accent. Terry knew now that her mind was being hijacked by the suit&#39;s A.I., but still he was kind of surprised she sounded this excited! <br />
Denise finally tears herself away from the mirror and, still smiling, slowly walks up close to Terry and gives him a tender kiss on the lips. &quot;Thank you Terry&quot; She tells him, the words dripping with pure love, then she quietly walked over to pick up the formal clothes from the metallic table. She also selected a pair of compression shorts and a large size jockstrap for herself. She smiled as she showed the large hard cup to Terry. &quot;Mmm... I think I want to wear a jockstrap under the shorts, what do you say? Isn&#39;t this one just perfect for me!? Please excuse me just a minute Terry, while I make myself presentable and I&#39;ll be right back with you!&quot; She says in a friendly yet professional sounding voice, then walks to the full length mirror nearby. <br />
Terry observed her incredulous as she calmly began dressing herself in the fancy waiter uniform, while smiling at herself in the mirror like a maniac. She looked almost like she couldn&#39;t get enough of her new masculine and athletic appearance, like she suddenly fell madly in love with this artificial man and was euphoric to be under his ebony skin, literally... Even the way she buttoned up her shirt looked almost erotic! <br />
&quot;Wow, she looks... really really happy with herself now, doesn&#39;t she? This default personality override really works wonders!&quot; Terry says to the old man while finalizing the credit card payment for the biosuit. <br />
&quot;Certainly does, sir, I trust this is satisfying. However, if I may... you should stop calling Denise a &quot;She&quot; now. HE is, for all intents and purposes, a hundred percent MALE now. Physically and mentally. Let me explain... You see that maniacal, shit-eating grin on his face?&quot; <br />
Terry turns his eyes to &quot;Denise&quot; again... smiling and breathing somewhat heavily, she or rather HE just finished tying his black satin bowtie. He folds his starched white collar down and as he adjusts and straightens it and the bowtie to perfection, he lets out a soft moan(soft but manly moan, NOT feminine!). Denise then kept caressing his tie and collar with one hand while the other one went lower and cupped the rigid codpiece of his jockstrap through his slacks. He gently fondles the hard shell, which was now crammed tight with his big Black erect cock, eyes unblinking and fixated on his own gaze reflected in the mirror. A bit of drool escaped his grinning mouth and dribbled down his strong chin. <br />
&quot;As you can see&quot; the old man continues, &quot;Denise is not quite herself right now. This sort of, ehm, sexual and narcissistic arousal is caused by the suit&#39;s personality override when the wearer is a chick. It doesn&#39;t happen when worn by a guy though. Basically the suit simulates an extreme testosterone level which Denise&#39;s brain perceives as actual level of testosterone. This along with the personality pattern ensure that the resulting identity is 100% male and also has the skills specific to the suit&#39;s model. In this case, the perfect waiter/cook/housekeeper. He also has a significantly higher IQ now, as well as advance notions of etiquette, fine manners and speaking skills. Denise is acting this way because well, she has a HUGE crush on herself. On himself rather... Oh, don&#39;t worry the hornyness is not permanent! It hits intensely only when the suit is activated for the first time, but then you&#39;ll see, he&#39;ll calm down once he gets over himself, ha ha.&quot; <br />
&quot;Interesting...&quot; Terry says just as Denise walked up next to him. It appears he was finally done getting dressed and he now looked impeccably elegant with an added black blazer over his white shirt and bowtie. Denise had also gathered his discarded female clothes and heels and put them all neatly folded in a bag. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m ready Terry&quot; he says, &quot;Let&#39;s go home now and I shall answer all of the questions I&#39;m sure you have about the new me.&quot; <br />
&quot;Of course! Let&#39;s go Denise, we&#39;ll have a long chat and I think I&#39;ll even think of a new name for you... an African male name! Would you like that?&quot; <br />
Denise lunges at Terry and gives him another horny kiss, basically sticking his tongue down his throat! &quot;YES!! I absolutely want a new name!! I love you so much Terry!!!&quot; <br />
&quot;I love you too!&quot; <br />
<br />
The two of them then head back to the apartment and.......................</p>
