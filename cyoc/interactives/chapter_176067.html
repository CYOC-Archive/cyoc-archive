<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Door asks to her, &quot;Progress more? Are you sure about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy smirks back to the door and lets the changes continue. She could feel her body growing again as she could feel another growth spurt happening, shooting up another couple of inches. Her body then continued to mature further as her cones upgraded to size A cups, small but round. She could feel her hips expanding as her waist gotten a little curvier then normal. Tracing her finger to her hourglass, she was amazed at how shapely she’s becoming. “Wow… Look at me.” she said in a lower voice, “I’m really growing up fast.” She felt a minor migraine as she could feel her brain growing as well. Years of knowledge are filling her mind, as she was getting smarter by the second. In fact, common knowledge of kindergarten and grade school are easier for her as knowledge of high school entered her head. But that’s not the only thing that is entering her head. Ever since she was five, she always like going outside to play, rather it is hide and seek, ball, or playing tag. But now that she’s growing, her body is becoming predisposed and more athletic. She then started to stretch as her muscles beginning to strain, as she could feel the tone of her muscles improving after years of working out and surfing competition. She checked her face again and could see its journey through adulthood. Face looking so much oval like, nose getting longer and thinner a faint freckling on her nose, and eyes smaller and less childlike. She also noticed her lips puffing with cartilage and darkening to give her something to be kissed with. Looking at herself, Candy could tell that her body was a little toned then before as she was gaining both energy and metabolism from the ‘years’ of sports. Her mind was also being filled with memories of the many years she participated in sports including T-ball, soccer, and gymnastics. Katie looked on in disbelief as her body was developing faster then before.<br />
<br />
She now felt her body growing more pronounced as she raced through the teen years. Her growth spurt got to a couple of more inches and she could feel like she was rising on the elevator. Her chest started to feel heavy as she looks down to see the mounds growing bigger and looking like AAs. Hips widening and curving as she had the hourglass of a young teen. Candy stretched her legs as she she could feel them growing longer and shapelier, letting her free foot dangling as she moved her dainty foot to the beat. Her arm took the same direction as well and grew longer with muscles swelling to young athlete status. Candy decided to dig into the pockets of her newly-formed capri-pants and pulled out a wallet that had a learner&#39;s permit inside &#39;Candice Melbrooke, Age 15&#39; She then noticed a few spots on her slimmer cheeks and one on her sleeker nose. Another noticable feature is her wide smile traced with metal pieces, and as if on cue, Candy (Candice as she is known now) could feel a little discomfort in her mouth. Opening her mouth, she noticed braces appearing on her teeth. Realizing she was going through the gawky mid-teen phase of her life, Candice yelped &quot;More! And don&#39;t stop til the Zits are gone!&quot;<br />
<br />
Candice watched as she rose as if she was on an elevator, Her maturing body continued its crossover through adulthood as she could see her body shaping very finely. Her breasts expanded a little more, shaping into a pair of perky B cup breasts. Her hips and waistline curved up some more, as the hourglass shape was looking well defined. Her arms and legs stretched further and her muscles grew to athletic proportions. gained more feminine muscles as her biceps were bloating and her calves were bulging with years of jogging and push-ups. Her face continued to mature as her lips started to puff out and her nose grew long and thin but alas, two more zits emerged on her forehead and one on her left brow. At least she has a driver&#39;s licence now...<br />
<br />
Tingling again, Candice could feel herself growing into a teen of seventeen. She’s inching closer to the six-foot mark and was near her adult size. She took a deep breath as she her body matured into a young adult status. Breasts now teetered on C-Cup status in her pink tube top and his hips flared more and more, getting curvier by the second. With her arms and legs stretching, the muscle tone expanded and toned to the point of athletic status. She could feel her face maturing more and more as her cheekbones were looking a little high and there were fewer pimples dotting her face, leaving most of the skin really smooth. Other changes of her face took place with her eyes getting smaller, nose thinning and getting longer, and lips getting a bit puffy. Her hair lower down her waist and was reaching her posterior. She put a hand on her hips and felt her body language change. Candice was a young woman in body and mind, and stripped away her top to cradle her blossoming breasts as they grew bigger still.<br />
<br />
Her hourglass figure grew curvier as her hips expanded further and her rear inflated bigger. The muscles on her arms and legs grew thicker and harder and although they are not body builder level, she does show that she was very athletic. All the remaining pimples on her face disappeared as well, leaving it smooth and flawless. She could even feel her braces magically removed from her teeth as she opened her mouth partly to reveal her teeth looking all evened out and pearly white. Along the way, she could see no trace of her childish innocent anywhere. Instead it was a complete beauty with lips to kiss, sultry eyes, and an elegant nose. Her hair grew longer and was at the hips and was shining a dirty blonde hue. Her mind matures as well as knowledge and memories were changing incredibly. Most of which involve sports as she now knows how to do the hurdles, light weight training, and yoga to make her feel flexible. At eighteen years of age, Candice was amazed to see how grown up she looked. She might even make her mother jealous of her body. &quot;Damn, ain&#39;t I pretty scrumptious.&quot;</p>
