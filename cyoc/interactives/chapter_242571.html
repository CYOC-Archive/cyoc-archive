<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Barbara was first instructed to put on a hospital gown. As the sundress and underwear lay on the chair, Barbara was now only in the hospital gown and was being taken into the imaging room. As she got in, a different man led her on, who got her to wear a lead apron and lie down on a table. The man instructed Barbara to hold her breath for a few seconds, and as she held it, the man got the X-ray photo. After being brought back to her room, Barbara was told to wait as the photo was being examined. During that time, the nurse from earlier would come into Barbara&#39;s room with a big nozzled tank, and as the nurse left, Barbara had a feeling of what this tank was supposed to be. But she was left back with some time all by herself in the room, so Barbara would pull out her phone from her purse and start messaging Martin.<br />
<br />
As more time passed by, the two men would come back into Barbara&#39;s room to bring up her x-ray. &quot;Well Barbara, after me and McGraw took a look into your x-ray, we are definitely convinced you are a perfect fusion,&quot; Dr. Blomes would just say to her. As the x-ray is shown to Barbara, Greg continues, &quot;As you can see here, it appears your bone structure is barely existent, and you are steadily losing what lumps of built-up fat you used to have pre-fusion, hence the lighter weight from the check-up.&quot; Barbara saw an outline of her body with very thin bones and small organs in between a huge outline with nothing in between the two. &quot;This must be the balloon&#39;s compromise of being full with air, in exchange for your once strong body structure. We are going to have to run a couple of tests,&quot; Greg finishes, as the nurse pulls up that air tank brought in earlier. &quot;Please put your balloon lip in the tank,&quot; the nurse requests Barbara, to which she gets her balloon lip securely put in the nozzle of the tank. The nurse and men take a step back to just behind the opposite side of Barbara and the tank, and Dr. Blome tells Barbara, &quot;Okay Barbara, we want you to open up the helium tank, put in as much air as your body can handle, and then tie yourself as full as you can get.&quot;<br />
<br />
With the instructions all clear to her, Barbara started to open the helium tank and felt a powerful release of helium going inside her body. As the helium blasts through, Barbara starts to feel her skin start to protrude like before, starting at her belly. However, this time Barbara is taking enough for the helium to start building up to her thighs and breasts, making her float up to the ceiling with little to no movement to go back down. Yet Barbara didn&#39;t necessarily feel any pain, so the helium continued to push. Feeling her arms and legs extrude and start to feel limited, Barbara was as comically big as she could have gotten to. The hospital gown Barbara was wearing would start to tear up and eventfully rip and fall to the ground. Barbara still kept rounding and rounding out, even with her full body exposed to the three people nearly across the room. The air tank emptied, and Barbara, feeling nothing but air, was as round as a man over six hundred pounds. Her arms and legs were enormous and constantly floating against the wall, and even her neck and head grew some, which Barbara didn&#39;t even know she could have done. The three others all looked at each other in awe, making some comments and noting down in a notebook. Barbara would release her balloon lip, and grasp its neck to make a knot out of it.<br />
<br />
Now preserved, Barbara, in her purest balloon form, was stuck to the ceiling of the room, taking up some space. &quot;Barbara,&quot; Greg asks, &quot;Do you not feel any form of pain or discomfort in your state?&quot; With a nod of approval, the two men talk some more, as Barbara could only look down at the floor and her exposed breasts. They get a couple of blunt objects and start poking around Barbara, who doesn&#39;t feel anything, and even got some minorly sharp objects against her skin, to the same response. They go back into talking, while Barbara still stays afloat, and she is directed to release her helium gas. The nurse would grab the chopstick out, and getting a grab on Barbara&#39;s left palm, release the balloon lip and all of the helium out from the helium tank. Feeling all the air rush out as hard as it came in, Barbara would elevate back down to the ground, still naked and bare in the room. Being allowed to be clothed back like before, Barbara would dress herself up with her underwear and sundress as the two men continued discussing. The nurse would be told something Barbara couldn&#39;t hear, and the nurse left for a moment as the three waited.<br />
<br />
The moment wouldn&#39;t even pass in its entirety before the nurse came back with a small table with wheels, which has a big monitor and a small camera device connected to it on the table. As the nurse gets the monitor and camera set up, Dr. Blome tells Barbara, &quot;We are gonna do a form of an endoscopy now Barbara, through your balloon lip.&quot; Getting a nerve struck, Barbara tried to stay as calm as she could, looking away as she felt the tiny camera being put in through her balloon lip. Taking a look at the monitor before turning back, Barbara could see white bone and some reds of her own palm. Hearing more talk coming out of it, Barbara turns back to see the camera being turned around to look closely at her inner skin layer. All of this was making her squirm a little, so Barbara couldn&#39;t look much more after that, but she could tell that the two were talking about it. After feeling the camera being pulled out of her balloon lip, Barbara looked back to see the nurse turning off the equipment and pushing them out of the room, and Dr. Blomes made his final remarks, &quot;Alright Barbara, we got all the noting we think we&#39;ll need for now. We should be all done for the full check, just take this with you and you should be all good.&quot; Barbara grabs a paper that Dr. Blome gave to her, which appeared to be a written medical document saying that she was a perfect fusion.<br />
<br />
With that, the two men walk out of the room, and the nurse walks back in, this time holding a plastic bag with what Barbara could tell is her work shoes and socks that she left back from the check-up. &quot;I believe this is for you,&quot; the nurse says as she gives Barbara the bag, and after grabbing her purse, Barbara is escorted back to a different ambulance vehicle, filled with four different people of different fusions. As Barbara sat next to one of them on the left side, the vehicle started moving, but unlike the ride to the hospital, the others were quiet and reserved. Barbara could only smile, thinking how well this full-check went for her. Seeing two different people being called and dropped off, it would be Barbara&#39;s turn. As the vehicle drives off, Barbara looks up and into the same building of residence. Picking up her first trick like the first day, Barbara would make her run up and high jump to save her some stairs. After a couple more jumps, Barbara would just simply walk up to her room number. Dropping off her bag of shoes, putting down her purse on the kitchen table, and grabbing her phone as she lays down on her couch, Barbara gets back into the familiarity she has been in all week and turns on the television to play some background show. Barbara would enjoy her last day of the government shutdown, being in a state of relaxation. As she prepared to go to bed for the final night, Barbara had a thought she could do about her dreams. Unlike the previous nights, she fills herself up with some of her air, not filling up too much. Tying her balloon lip, Barbara would get herself in bed and drift to sleep, filled with air.</p>
