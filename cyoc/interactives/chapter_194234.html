<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Think on it, that is an easy change to do before we begin the process of changing you into a succubus.” Said La Fay as Barbara nodded her head. <br />
<br />
She had decided on the famous sex demon because not only was her number 2 pick on her list of top choices of what to become. She picked it because while Succubus was something most people would want to avoid, she actually was looking forward to it. Over her years in the system she had gone to too many super religious foster families and considered them almost if not worse then those who would take her just for the money. Becoming a succubus would be a huge middle finger to those family who would beat her just because she was bi-sexual.<br />
<br />
Besides becoming a sexy she demon who feed off sexual energy sounded great, she had been sexually active for a while but none of the people she had been with had really meant all that much. Besides from what she had seen from her “brief” view of this world it didn’t seam like different creatures where treated all that different. True she had seen stuff like certain creatures having to use certain doorways but a Giant isn’t going to fit through a normal door. <br />
<br />
“Alright…follow me.” Said La Fay as they headed out the door and Barbara followed her out of the office and across campus again. Night was falling but she soon found herself in what looked to be an old stone building but turned out to be their medical school. <br />
<br />
What followed was something kin to a physical, the weighed her, measured her, took blood work but they also did a lot of measurements like her bust size, her arm length and so on. Finally, she sat on basically a hospital bed with an IV in her arm, dressed in only a white gown. <br />
<br />
“Alright, we have it set for a succubus…are you sure?” inquired a nurse who was a type of fawn, the IV bag was a giving off a strange purple/black liquid which glowed a bit. <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Barbara as the nurse opened the value as the liquid that would transform her began to flow out of the bag and into her arm.<br />
<br />
She took a deep breath and waited, for a while nothing happened as far as she noticed, so she just sat there looking at the IV bag which was emptying at a slow but steady rate. The first change she noticed was her finger nails of all things. They began to change into a burnt orange color.<br />
<br />
“So this is real after all.” She said as she looked up toward a large mirror and noticed her blue eyes had also shifted to purple lilac color which really popped as her skin began to change. Then she noticed the color of her skin beginning to shift, her white skin didn’t darken pure say but began to shift into a orange color, slowly but surely her skin turned to an almost bright orange color, her lips and after looking down under her gown her nipples turned a darker burnt orange shade.<br />
<br />
Her long blonde hair, always a point of pride with her also began to change but it became even brighter and fuller. Then with some pain two curved horns began to grow out of her skull. It was painful like having a monster headache, but two curving horns grew out of her skull before coming to a stop a good 9 to 10 inches long. They where smooth and the same burnt orange color as her nails. <br />
<br />
By now the bag was almost totally empty but she felt more changes, all her arm and leg hair fell away leaving them smooth. In fact every bit of hair minus her head and between her legs had disappeared, her arms and legs became more shapely as well as her core. She had always been proud of staying in shape and was often in better shape then most of the people she slept with. Her strong feminine core remained but took on a greater sex appeal. Then she noticed that while all this was happening her large bust had grown even more, she went from a D cup to at least an E cup and somehow, they became even perkier. <br />
<br />
“About done.” Said the nurse as Barbara winced in pain as she sat up, out of her tail bone grew a long-forked tail which went down to her ankles. She thought that was it until she almost doubled over in pain as out of her shoulder blade area grew a pair of wings similar, she thought to a pterodactyl only with burnt orange skin flaps. <br />
<br />
She was breathing heavily as the wings folded themselves up so that small claws at the end of each wing could sit on her shoulders without touching the ground. <br />
<br />
“You are done.” Answered the nurse as Barbara looked at herself, a drop-dead sexy succubus with orange skin, dark orange nails/wings, a forked tail, long blonde hair with purple eyes. <br />
<br />
“Wow…” said Barbara her voice parched as she looked at herself in the mirror. Only then did she notice she now had a small pair of fangs and her tongue looked slightly longer as well. “I am really a succubus.” <br />
<br />
“Yes, you are.” stated the nurse “Welcome to your new world.”</p>
