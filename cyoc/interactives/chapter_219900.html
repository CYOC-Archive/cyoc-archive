<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah was sick of boys, they were always mean to her, got in her way, and were just annoying and worse than girls in every conceivable way. She released an exhausted sigh and fell back onto her bed as she thought about how great it would be if all the boys became girls like her. *&#120347;&#120361;&#120354;&#120373; &#120376;&#120368;&#120374;&#120365;&#120357; &#120355;&#120358; &#120372;&#120368; &#120354;&#120366;&#120354;&#120379;&#120362;&#120367;&#120360;!*<br />
<br />
As luck would have it, she had recently inherited a sororal tome of magic from her mother which she had been carefully studying for the past few months in order to craft the perfect spell for her needs. According to her in-depth analysis of the text, it was most important for a transformation subject to be changed slowly and surreptitiously. If the subject is changed too rapidly without mentally accepting the transformation, the spell&#39;s power would surely waver and eventually they would revert back to their natural form. However, if the spell&#39;s effects were allowed to mature slowly and organically in the target&#39;s mind, they would eventually come to accept the change of their own free will, and the spell would thereby become completely irreversible! With this and other fundamental magical precepts in mind, she painstakingly crafted a new spell, one of indomitable potency, which she planned to unleash upon all the rotten schoolboys she so despised.<br />
<br />
In order to carry out her plan, Sarah needed to enlist the help of her closest friends who were themselves VERY keen to eliminate the glut of gross boys infesting their school. They discussed their plan in secret within the hallowed walls of the girl&#39;s bathroom, but little did they know their conversation was being overheard by Nancy Cuningham, a gender-dysphoric girl who was discretely trying to do her business in one of the stalls. As they discussed their plans amongst themselves, Nancy grew more and more excited by the prospect of everyone in the school becoming the same gender, only she’d resolved to make one slight change to the plan…<br />
<br />
The next day at school Sarah and her cronies snuck into the Headmaster’s office. Using a sneaky spell they knocked out the teachers so they would not interfere. Then they made an announcement telling all the students to go to the gymnasium for an emergency assembly. Once everyone was gathered they locked the doors and arranged for all the girls to move to the back of the room leaving the boys bewildered in the middle.<br />
<br />
&quot;All you boys are cursed and I am here to break that curse!” Sarah announced from the front of the room. “Being a boy is a lie because all of you are secretly girls inside. When you were born the true Girl inside you was locked away, but I will help you release the Girl inside who you truly are.”<br />
<br />
She then started chanting the spell from her notebook and a soft blue glow started to envelop the room.<br />
<br />
“Podea Lim TraSSa, Phoh Limx Masculo Et Ramma Pa Femire Shoon!”<br />
The glow slowly faded into the very walls of the gym as Sarah finished her chanting and the spell was complete. The boys looked around confused, as nothing had happened to any of them. One eventually raised his hand to speak:<br />
<br />
&quot;Err, nothing happened&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really?&quot; Sarah replied, gesturing for him to come up on stage with a smile on her face. The boy, called Mike, took the invitation and walked up to stand next to her. As he stood there awkwardly, Sarah reached into the backpack behind her and pulled out a Female school uniform.<br />
<br />
Mike took it from her and held the skirt out in front of him questioningly.<br />
<br />
“What am I supposed to do with this?” He asked with confusion.<br />
<br />
“Don’t you want to try it on?” She encouraged.<br />
<br />
“Heck no.” He replied. “I don’t wear skirts!”<br />
<br />
“But don’t you feel like you should, deep inside?” She asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
“NO.” He replied with conviction, dropping the skirt on the floor in disgust.<br />
<br />
“Wait!” Nancy called from the crowd. “Let me try something!”<br />
<br />
Nancy ran to join them at the front of the room, stripping Mike&#39;s tie off from around his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nancy ignored Mike&#39;s protests and adeptly tied the cloth around her neck and cinched it up to the collar while the rest of the crowd looked on in bewilderment.<br />
<br />
Before anyone had a chance to break the silence, Nancy began to grow! She shot up six inches in just a few seconds, leaving her with lanky arms and legs and a comically exposed belly. Her feet popped her shoes apart and tore through her thin, feminine socks. Her long hair parted itself to the side and swept itself back into a proper boy&#39;s style, the extra length tucked itself away neatly behind her ears before seeming to disappear somehow behind her head as though it had been short all along. Then muscles began to develop all over her body, consuming the mounds of fatty tissue on her chests, while simultaneously straining her clothes even closer to their limits across the rest of her body. A dusting of leg hairs sprouted out around her exposed ankles and a pencil-thin trail of hair snaked up from her waistband to her navel, matching a pair of patchy, juvenile side-burns that grew in beside her ears. Her tattered clothes began to mend and re-fashion themselves into a boy&#39;s school uniform as her genitals erupted from her crotch to form the permanent companion that would be calling the shots from now on. <br />
<br />
&quot;It worked!&quot; He bellowed in his new, masculine voice that startled everyone, even himself. Nancy recognized the voice as his own internal male self, that had always been there, even before the spell was cast. Clancy&#39;s voice. Finally set free and ready to live life as his authentic self!<br />
<br />
The auditorium broke from its silence and erupted into chaos.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s gong on?&quot; &quot;Didn&#39;t it work?&quot; &quot;Why aren&#39;t they girls?&quot; &quot;This isn&#39;t right, Sarah. You said you were going to get rid of the boys.&quot; &quot;What? you can&#39;t get rid of us!&quot; &quot;She&#39;s some sort of witch?&quot; &quot;What&#39;s going to happen?&quot; &quot;…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;QUIET!&quot; Sarah shouted. &quot;It&#39;s obvious what happened. I cast a spell to release the girl that lives inside every boy so that they would eventually succumb to their true and proper, more civilized, female selves… But Nancy must have done something to corrupt my magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Clancy, actually, and yeah, that&#39;s exactly right. I hated being trapped in a girl&#39;s body all my life, and I discovered that if I could get you to wear my shoes while you cast the spell, and I wore your shoes on the wrong feet, it would swap the intended target of the spell! So I bought that expensive pair of designer pumps you were drooling over and tricked you into borrowing them for the day!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You Bitch!&quot; Sarah cried. &quot;I thought we could trust you! You were a girl. How could you even think to sell us out like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m no sellout; I&#39;m loyal to my gender. I&#39;ve always been a dude, and now I&#39;ll never have to justify that again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll admit it was a clever idea.&quot; Sarah admitted. &quot;I never would have expected someone without magic ability to be able to exploit an obscure magical rule like that, but I can just as easily re-cast the spell properly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah kicked off the adorable pumps in annoyance and readied herself to re-cast the spell…<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t bother with that.&quot; Clancy said as he bent down and pried off his left shoe and proceeded to pour something out of it that looked like wood chips. &quot;Are you familiar with Solomon&#39;s seal root?&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd of girls grew uneasy and started to mumble amongst themselves while Sarah&#39;s face grew pale.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s he talking about, Sarah?!&quot; &quot;What is that!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... He means….&quot; Sarah began. &quot;... It means… It&#39;s… It&#39;s Permanent! The spell has to run its course. I can&#39;t undo it!&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls erupted into a torrent of angry, belligerent cries. It wasn&#39;t easy for Sarah to calm the angry crowd, especially with the boys jeering in the background and cheering for Clancy, their new bro and hero, but eventually the girl&#39;s demands for answers and explanations won over their thirst for vengeful action and Sarah was able to explain the exact nature of the curse they had all fallen under.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I have done, quite by accident…&quot; Sarah began, &quot;is release the inner boy in us all.. You can probably already feel the little vermin trying to worm his horrible little way out and cast aside your precious female identity. However, while he has been released he is not fully awakened, and will only do so if you accept him, accept the preposterous idea that you are in fact boys, as Nancy (Clancy) did when she put on that neck tie. Soon… all of us will give into our inner masculinity and become boys too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But!...&quot; Sarah immediately shouted to calm the swelling murmur of the crowd. &quot;We don&#39;t HAVE to succumb to our inner boy, if we simply reject him and keep him contained! The spell will wear off in a week, and those of us who are still girls will remain so unharmed…&quot;<br />
<br />
A collective sigh of relief washed over the girls at that revelation. <br />
<br />
&quot;So all we have to do is not act like little goons and we will remain girls?&quot; One girl asked.<br />
<br />
An uneasy, sickly smile fluttered onto Sarah&#39;s face. &quot;Yep.&quot; was all she could reply as she felt her heart sink into her stomach. She didn&#39;t have the heart to tell them that denying your inner self is never an easy task&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, don&#39;t warn them!&quot; Sarah heard a masculine voice say in her head. &quot;The easier they think it&#39;ll be, the more bro&#39;s we&#39;ll have by the end of the week!&quot;</p>
