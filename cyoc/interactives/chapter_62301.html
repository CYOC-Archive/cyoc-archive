<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Mike went to Marissa's to practice for the Show Choir finals, they could not practice their routine <br />
there because the air conditioner had gone out. Thinking quick, Mike called his mom Julie who quickly agreed <br />
they should practice at your home. Just last week new wood flooring was installed in the master living area <br />
and the furniture had not been returned from the storage facility, so they had plenty of room to practice, <br />
plus your mother is your twin brother's biggest fan when it comes to Show Choir! (She used to be in it when <br />
she was in school).<br />
<br />
The team consisted of 12 girls, and 10 guys. This was Junior High Show Choir, and they were amazing! You try <br />
to get unstuck, and are trying to tell them to get away from the house! After seeing what happened to your <br />
Dad, you definitely don't want that to happen to the rest of your family and friends. Even worse, it appears <br />
that your Dad doesn't even remember who or what he was (You did break the Chronovac 10 seconds before the <br />
transformation was complete, and maybe that's why you still have your human memories and he doesn't).<br />
<br />
Your mom Julie, hearing the commotion of a Barnyard animals braying and hoof's clopping, says &quot;I hate it when <br />
your father watches the Damn discovery channel! You would think he is in love with those beasts as much as he <br />
watches them have sex all the time!&quot; Clearly embarrassed, she comes into the house with all the kids <br />
snickering behind her. As soon as they come into the house, their snickering turns into coughing as they smell <br />
the retch of Donkey cum, Donkey feces, and Donkey Urine - on top of two adult male donkey's.<br />
<br />
The look of amazement in your Mom's face as she looks at you face to face, and then see's what was your Dad <br />
upstairs! As this the scene and embarrassment quickly becomes an information overload, she faints right in <br />
front of you! All the while, you are trying to tell everyone to RUN AWAY, PLEASE RUN AWAY!, Get out, Get help, <br />
Call 911! - but they only hear Heeee Hawwww, Hee Hawww Haww! <br />
<br />
The show choir girls all scream, and you notice a few run from the house outside. Your brother Mike and the <br />
other guys immediately go to your Mother and try to revive her and get her out of harms way of that Donkey <br />
(what if it trampled her). As Mike tries to move his mother, he starts getting dizzy headed like his father <br />
did earlier! You know the only way to save them is to get out of there and get out fast. Somehow you are able <br />
to get free, Jump over your mother into the crowd of guys (and transfering some of your fathers donkey cum all <br />
over their faces and shirts, and run towards the back of the house.<br />
<br />
As you get further away, you notice everyone begins to regain their composure - but you also notice something <br />
you've never noticed before in your life. Your mother must of been too close to you when she fainted. She was <br />
emitting the most amazingly sweet and tasty smell, and to your horror, Your father could smell it too and <br />
couldn't control himself. As he began to snort and then bray, he managed his way down the stairs until he got <br />
to Julie. He starting licking and nipping at her shorts, and that's when Mike and the guys again went over to <br />
push away the other donkey.<br />
<br />
Your dad wasn't going to be denied that easily as his penis had now become rock hard and started climaxing <br />
again. This time it was like a hose, completely covering your brother, his friends, and some of the nearby <br />
girls. <br />
<br />
All hell broke loose next. As it got into many of their eyes, noses, and mouths, they all began to try to wipe <br />
it off, as they many of them were disgusted and fell into it. Soon before your eyes 20 teenagers and your <br />
Mother were all becoming donkeys. You watched as they all tried to scream and run, just to be fall down and <br />
slip again. Their bodies quickly outgrew their clothes, as they all burst out of them. Their ears began to get <br />
pointy and had the nasty grey, must donkey fur grow out of their heads. Soon long thin tails began to sprout <br />
out of their backsides, and you watched in horror as their fur began to fill in. Their  nails all began to <br />
thicken, and their hands and feet formed into hooves. Next their heads and faces morphed into a Donkey and you <br />
watch as they only thing they can do is bray in terror.<br />
<br />
That wasn't the only thing they began to bray about, as they changes neared completion, the guys began to <br />
smell their female Jenny's - who were all in heat. Shortly the Jenny's came and to show themselves to the <br />
Jacks - and you watch in horror as they all began to have a Donkey Orgy in your house - all because you used <br />
that evil ChronoVac. As they climaxed, they began to become hungry and the donkey's started leaving outside <br />
the house to eat some grass.</p>
