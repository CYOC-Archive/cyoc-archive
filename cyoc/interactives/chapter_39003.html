<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As they were walking to Karthis City Keiko asked &quot;So what's your story Hanna?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't want to hear it&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You better believe I want to hear it&quot; Keiko said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd also like to hear it&quot; Janice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll keep bugging me until I tell you huh?&quot; Hanna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right&quot; Keiko said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I'll tell you&quot; Hanna said. &quot;I guess I should begin with what my name was. It had been Harold though people called me Harry.&quot;<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Five years ago<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle Harry!&quot; a ten year old girl shouted as she ran up the steps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Kathy&quot; Harry said as he hugged her. &quot;Ready to go to the zoo and mall?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we go to the mall first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
A woman in her early thirties came up and said &quot;I appreciate you spending the day with her Harry&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem Harriette&quot; Harry said. &quot;Anything for my little sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harriette turned to her daughter and said &quot;Now you be good for your uncle. Listen to what he says.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mom&quot; Kathy said.<br />
<br />
After Harriette left Harry said &quot;Alright, let's get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the mall Kathy wanted to get a new dress so they went into one of the stores. Kathy had just come out of the changing room to show Harry how the dress looked on her when a guy burst into the store and demanded &quot;Everybody down on the floor! Now!&quot; Of course he had a gun so everybody did as he said. He went around collecting cash and jewelery.<br />
<br />
When he came to Harry and Kathy he said &quot;My what a pretty little girl. I could have some fun with you. I think I'll take you with me when I leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just take the money and leave&quot; Harry said darkly. &quot;Leave her alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a brave one here then&quot; the guy said smiling. &quot;If you don't want to die I suggest you shut up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not afraid to die&quot; Harry said.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a female voice shouts &quot;FREEZE!&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy didn't miss a beat as he grabbed Harry and used him as a shield. He then said &quot;Let me go and I won't kill any one here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just calm down&quot; the female officer said. &quot;I'm going to lower my weapon. No one has to get hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya right&quot; the guy muttered as the female officer lowered her gun. Before she could react the guy shot her two times.<br />
<br />
Kathy screamed and the guy shot her too.<br />
<br />
&quot;You son of a...&quot; Harry began but the guy shot him too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everybody be quiet and no one else gets hurt!&quot; the guy commanded.<br />
<br />
Harry meanwhile was one the ground in more pain then he had felt in his life. Where the bullet had entered was burning. Worse was that the burning was spreading out from the entry wound until it encompassed Harry's whole body. Suddenly his body burst into flame and he let out a howl of pure unadulterated pain.<br />
<br />
One of the women in the store said &quot;Oh my God!&quot; upon seeing this. As for the guy with the gun he could only watch in horror as Harry's body burned.<br />
<br />
Finally the flames died down but instead of a charred corpse a red figure was laying there. The figure stood up and everyone could tell that it was a demon. It was clearly female wearing what looked to be a black latex bikini. Her skin had various shades of red in it, some parts so dark they were almost black. On her head were two dark red horns. She had long hair that was blacker than black. On her back were a pair of black bat-like wings. She also had a black tail with the tip being a spade shape. Her eyes were a bright red and when she smiled two fangs could be seen.<br />
<br />
The she demon looked at the terrified guy and made a little gesture. The guy burst into flames and unholy screams issued from his mouth. Two more police officers arrived in response to the silent alarm that had been tripped. They stood there with their mouths open as the guy burned and the she demon smiled.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the flames died out and the guy didn't seem to have a mark on him. There was a look of unholy fear in his eyes though. He sank down to his knees and didn't move.<br />
<br />
The she demon looked at Kathy and knelt beside her saying &quot;Don't worry Kathy, you'll make it through this.&quot; She looked at the police officers and shouted &quot;CALL AN AMBULANCE YOU FOOLS! SHE'S STILL ALIVE!&quot;<br />
<br />
The she demon placed her hand over the wound in Kathy's chest and begun stemming the flow of blood while one of the officers called for an ambulance.<br />
<br />
The woman who had spoken earlier asked &quot;W-what d-did y-you d-do t-to h-him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just sent him to Hell for a few moments&quot; the she demon said.<br />
<br />
No one else said anything and then the ambulance arrived. As soon as the paramedics entered the she demon fainted.<br />
<br />
Later Harry started to slowly wake up. He had had the most unusual dream but it was over now. He tried moving his left hand but found that there was something restricting his movement. He opened his eyes and saw that he was handcuffed to a hospital bed. Though that wasn't what caught his attention. What did was the fact that his hand and wrist were slimmer than what he remembered. He took a deep breath and felt the hospital gown rub against two unfamiliar objects on his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, you're awake&quot; a female voice said off to his right. &quot;I'll let one of the guards know so he can tell the doctor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry saw the female officer get up and walk to the door. When she came back she said &quot;I'm sorry but I have to question you about what happened in the store.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Harry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;According to witness reports a guy was shot and burst into flames&quot; the officer said. &quot;Once the flames died down you were there in his place. Care to make a statement?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry realized that at least a part of his dream wasn't a dream. &quot;Is Kathy alright?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you care?&quot; the officer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because she's my niece!&quot; Harry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can't give you that information&quot; the officer said. &quot;Now do you care to explain what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A guy came into the store with a gun and proceeded to rob us&quot; Harry said. &quot;He came to me and my niece and said he could have some fun with her. A female cop came and the guy used me as a shield. He then shot her, then my niece, and finally me. After that it gets a bit hazy. I remember feeling the burning from being shot spread throughout my body and screaming in pain. The the pain was gone and I stood up. I saw the guy burst into flame and then a lady ask me what I had done. I remember saying that I had sent him to Hell. I don't remember anything else until I woke up here. Why am I handcuffed to the bed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was told that the handcuffs would keep you from harming anyone&quot; the officer said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could I harm anyone?&quot; Harry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to have some sort of power&quot; the officer said. &quot;The guy who you say shot you was terrified of something. So much so that he told us all of his prior crimes including his involvement in a pedophilia sex ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sick pervert&quot; Harry said darkly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're hoping that we can break up the ring and return the children to their families&quot; the officer said. &quot;By the way, you've been out for four days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then a doctor came in and said &quot;I see your demon girl is awake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a girl&quot; Harry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could have fooled me&quot; the doctor said. &quot;Look in this mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry looked in the mirror that the doctor held up. His face had changed from the one he knew. It was rounder and smoother with no hint of a beard or mustache. His eyes were now blue where they were brown before. His hair was now platinum blond where it was brown before and definitely longer than it had been. He turned his head just to be sure that this wasn't some trick. &quot;This can't be&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ordinarily I'd agree with you&quot; the doctor said. &quot;The evidence says otherwise though. We just got the results of the DNA test we did. With the exception of one chromosome you are Harold Rains.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did I switch gender?&quot; Harry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have a scientific answer for you&quot; the doctor said. &quot;Though your gender wasn't the only thing to change. Your age changed as well. By our estimates you are now thirteen years old.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is just great!&quot; Harry said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now that we know who you are those handcuffs can be taken off&quot; the doctor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't do that&quot; the officer said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she a suspect in a case?&quot; the doctor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As far as I know she isn't&quot; the officer said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then remove them&quot; the doctor said. &quot;I will not have my patient in handcuffs. Besides the priest said that once we found out who she was we could remove them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead and remove them&quot; a male officer said coming into the room. &quot;I am Lieutenant Dan young lady. I would call you Harry but I just can't bring myself to do that. So what would you like to be called?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry thought it over as the female officer removed the handcuffs. After they were removed he said &quot;I think you can call me Hanna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Hanna I'm sure your curious as to how we found out about who you were&quot; Lieutenant Dan said. &quot;After we had called your sister to inform her what had happened to her daughter we brought her in here and she recognized you as her brother. She was quite confused by it but your parents said the same thing. They'll be happy that you're awake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How is Kathy?&quot; Harry, or should say Hanna, asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's sore and not quite out of the woods yet but she'll be fine&quot; the doctor said. &quot;She's been asking where her uncle is and why he hasn't come to see her. We're going to keep you a few more days so we can move you into her room if you wish. That way your family can visit both of you at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like that&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll make the arrangements&quot; the doctor said.<br />
<br />
Later that day Hanna was being moved to Kathy's room. Hanna had discovered that she was sore even though there was no mark on her. As soon as Kathy saw her she said &quot;Uncle Harry! You came to see me! What happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know Kathy&quot; Hanna said. &quot;As long as I'm like this though call me Hanna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Aunt Hanna. Are you ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just sore. How about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sore too. That was scary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it was.&quot;<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Present day<br />
<br />
&quot;So we stayed in the hospital for a couple more days&quot; Hanna said. &quot;During that time a priest came in did all types of spiritual tests on me to see if I was evil. I was also shown the security tape and I saw what I was for the first time. It wasn't until many months later that I found out I was a half demon when Lucifer came to me to join his army. At least I was able to refuse his 'invitation'. Since then I've been doing my own thing. I do still see my family though my niece is physically older than me now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was interesting but we're coming within site of Karthis City&quot; Tabra said. &quot;Remember that women and girls are subservient to men here so act accordingly.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they topped a sand dune they saw Karthis City. It had grown quite a bit since Tabra and the others had escaped.</p>
