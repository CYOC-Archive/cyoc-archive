<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The hotel lobby smelled faintly of stale carpet and industrial air freshener, a sharp contrast to the cool night air they’d just stepped in from. Clarissa led the way, striding toward the check-in desk with the same determination she brought to the volleyball court, while Ryan trailed behind, hauling two of their duffel bags over his broad shoulders. Amelia and Stacey lingered near the entrance, their eyes flicking around the lobby’s tacky floral wallpaper and aging chandeliers.<br />
&quot;Classy,&quot; Ryan muttered under his breath as he adjusted the weight of the bags.<br />
Clarissa turned, rolling her eyes. &quot;What did you expect? A five-star resort?&quot;<br />
Stacey smirked, tugging on Ryan’s sleeve. &quot;C’mon, Ry. This is an elite athlete experience. We’re roughing it.&quot;<br />
He groaned dramatically. &quot;Elite my ass. I’m just here for the free breakfast.&quot;<br />
After a brief exchange with the receptionist, they made their way down the dimly lit hallway, the carpeted floors muffling their tired footsteps. Room 214. The key card beeped, and Clarissa swung the door open, stepping inside first.<br />
A beat of silence.<br />
&quot;Two beds?&quot; Ryan deadpanned, staring at the cramped space. The room smelled faintly of cheap air freshener and fresh linen, the beds neatly made with stiff white sheets and an overabundance of pillows. A single nightstand with a flickering lamp sat between them, and across from the beds was a small desk with a TV bolted to the wall.<br />
Clarissa didn&#39;t hesitate. She dumped her bag on the bed closest to the window, tossing a knowing glance at Stacey, who grinned and followed suit. &quot;This one’s ours.&quot;<br />
Ryan blinked, standing in the doorway. &quot;Uh, excuse me? No discussion?&quot;<br />
Stacey plopped down with a satisfied sigh. &quot;Nope.&quot; She stretched her arms above her head, her crop top riding up slightly to reveal a sliver of toned stomach. &quot;Claimed. House rules.&quot;<br />
Ryan turned to Amelia, who stood stiffly beside him, her fingers tightening around the strap of her backpack. Their eyes met, and a mutual sense of awkward resignation passed between them.<br />
&quot;Guess that means we’re bunking, huh?&quot; Ryan said, offering a half-smile.<br />
Amelia’s cheeks tinged pink as she nodded, carefully setting her bag down on the remaining bed. &quot;I... guess so.&quot; She hesitated, eyes darting to the edge of the bed as if calculating how much personal space she could claim.<br />
Ryan flopped onto the mattress with a groan, spreading out like a starfish. &quot;Oh yeah. This is luxury.&quot; He patted the spot beside him. &quot;Don’t worry, Amelia. I don’t bite... much.&quot;<br />
She rolled her eyes, but a small smile betrayed her amusement as she sat cautiously on the edge of the bed, hands neatly folded in her lap.<br />
Meanwhile, Stacey had already begun rummaging through her suitcase, clothes flying in all directions as she searched for pajamas. &quot;We should’ve all shared one giant bed like they do in the movies,&quot; she mused.<br />
Clarissa shot her a look. &quot;Yeah, hard pass.&quot;<br />
Ryan peeked over his shoulder. &quot;I dunno. It could be fun... or terrifying, depending on Stacey’s sleep habits.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Stacey pouted before a mischievous grin spread across her face. &quot;Speaking of fun...&quot; She turned, dragging out the ornate box from her duffel bag and plopping it onto the bed between her and Clarissa. The swirling golden patterns caught the dim light, giving the game an almost ethereal glow.<br />
Amelia frowned at it, pulling her knees up to her chest. &quot;You actually brought it?&quot;<br />
&quot;Of course, I did!&quot; Stacey beamed, tapping her fingers on the lid. &quot;We need something to do tonight other than overthinking tomorrow’s matches.&quot;<br />
Clarissa sighed, eyeing the box warily. &quot;You realize we&#39;re supposed to rest, right?&quot;<br />
Stacey waved her off. &quot;Relax. We’ll just play a few rounds, have some laughs, and maybe make fun of Ryan when he inevitably loses.&quot;<br />
Ryan sat up, stretching. &quot;Why am I always the target of your bullying?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because you&#39;re a good sport,&quot; Stacey teased, winking.<br />
Amelia reached out hesitantly, tracing the gold designs with her fingertips. &quot;It looks... old.&quot;<br />
&quot;Exactly!&quot; Stacey grinned, leaning in conspiratorially. &quot;The guy at the shop said it’s enchanted.&quot;<br />
Ryan groaned, flopping back down dramatically. &quot;Oh great. Here we go. Stacey&#39;s thrift store treasures strike again.&quot;<br />
Clarissa sighed but couldn&#39;t hide her curiosity. &quot;Fine. But if this thing curses us or something, I&#39;m blaming you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Noted!&quot; Stacey giggled, lifting the lid with a flourish. &quot;Let’s see what kind of magic we&#39;re working with.&quot;<br />
The group gathered around, the tournament momentarily forgotten as the game revealed itself piece by piece, the air thick with curiosity... and maybe just a touch of apprehension.<br />
<br />
Stacey plopped The Enchanted Path onto the bed with a dramatic flourish, her eyes gleaming with excitement. The box was larger than expected, the dark wood casing etched with swirling golden patterns that seemed to shimmer under the dim hotel lighting. The old-fashioned logo, carved in an elegant script, practically whispered promises of mystery and adventure.<br />
Clarissa, standing by the bathroom mirror wiping off her makeup with quick, efficient strokes, glanced over her shoulder with a skeptical arch of her brow. &quot;Seriously, Stacey? That thing looks like it came from a garage sale... or a horror movie.&quot;<br />
Stacey ignored her, flipping her hair over one shoulder as she carefully traced the intricate carvings with her fingers. &quot;That’s what makes it cool, Clarissa. It’s got... vibes.&quot;<br />
Amelia, curled up on the bed with her knees drawn to her chest, eyed the box warily. She adjusted the sleeves of her oversized hoodie, biting her lip in that nervous way she always did when something felt off. &quot;Where did you even find this?&quot;<br />
Stacey shrugged innocently. &quot;That weird antique shop on Fifth. The old guy behind the counter practically begged me to take it. Said it’s ‘one-of-a-kind.’&quot;<br />
Ryan, sitting cross-legged on the other bed, lazily leaned back against the headboard, watching the scene unfold. He had changed into a loose T-shirt and gym shorts, his toned arms stretching as he propped himself up with a tired sigh. The sight of Stacey rummaging through the board, Clarissa pulling her hair into a tight bun, and Amelia nervously fidgeting with her hoodie gave him a familiar sense of being the odd one out—always the friend, never more.<br />
&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; Ryan said, rubbing his hands together with a smirk. &quot;I’ll bite. What’s the deal with this thing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Finally!&quot; Stacey grinned and popped the lid open, revealing an old parchment-style instruction sheet resting atop the game pieces. The paper was slightly yellowed, its edges worn and curled, with the words A Journey of Transformation Awaits... elegantly scrawled across it in looping calligraphy.<br />
Clarissa rolled her eyes but stepped closer, crossing her toned arms over her chest. &quot;Transformation? That sounds... ominous.&quot;<br />
&quot;Or fun!&quot; Stacey countered, plopping onto the bed and holding up one of the game pieces—small, beautifully carved figurines that looked almost too lifelike. Each piece seemed eerily unique, a tiny hint of personality captured in the details.<br />
Amelia leaned forward cautiously, reaching out to examine one of the pieces. The cold, smooth texture sent a shiver down her spine. &quot;They feel... weird.&quot;<br />
Meanwhile, Clarissa disappeared into the bathroom, the sound of water running as she went through her nighttime routine—rinsing her face and brushing her teeth with her usual militant precision. Ryan tried not to glance too long in her direction, but the curve of her silhouette against the frosted glass door was hard to ignore. He quickly averted his gaze, scratching the back of his neck awkwardly.<br />
Stacey, ever the entertainer, held the instruction sheet up dramatically and cleared her throat. &quot;‘To those who dare to play... each roll of the dice will shape your path, testing your mind, body, and desires. Will you embrace change, or resist it?’&quot; She paused, wiggling her eyebrows at Ryan. &quot;Sounds like your kind of game, huh?&quot;<br />
Ryan smirked, adjusting his position on the bed. &quot;You know me. Always up for some self-improvement.&quot;<br />
Stacey tossed a game piece at him playfully. &quot;Yeah, you could use it.&quot;<br />
Amelia fidgeted with the hem of her hoodie again, her eyes darting toward Ryan before quickly looking away. &quot;I don’t know... it sounds kind of intense.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what makes it exciting,&quot; Stacey insisted, pulling the board out and unfolding it across the bed. The design was stunning—intricate paths winding across a fantasy-like landscape, with various color-coded spaces and cryptic symbols scattered throughout. The board felt oddly heavy, like it was waiting for something.<br />
Ryan reached over and gave the board a quick tap. &quot;Feels solid. I say we go for it.&quot;<br />
Clarissa, re-emerging from the bathroom with her hair wrapped in a towel, sighed as she sat down beside Stacey, already resigned to her fate. &quot;Fine. But if this thing starts glowing or levitating, I’m out.&quot;<br />
Ryan chuckled. &quot;You’re no fun.&quot;<br />
Clarissa smirked. &quot;I&#39;m practical.&quot;<br />
Stacey clapped her hands together, the excitement bubbling in her voice. &quot;Okay! Amelia, you in?&quot;<br />
Amelia hesitated, hugging her knees closer, stealing a glance at Ryan before sighing softly. &quot;Yeah... alright.&quot;<br />
&quot;That’s the spirit!&quot; Stacey grinned, quickly setting up the pieces and handing out the carved tokens. &quot;Let’s see who survives the Enchanted Path!&quot;<br />
As the game board lay open in front of them, the hotel room felt suddenly... smaller. The hum of the air conditioner seemed distant, and the weight of the box, the pieces, and the parchment filled the space with an unfamiliar energy.<br />
Ryan stretched out one last time before rolling his shoulders and picking up his token—a tiny figurine resembling a traveler with a satchel slung over their shoulder.<br />
&quot;What’s the worst that could happen, right?&quot; he joked.<br />
Stacey giggled. &quot;Famous last words.&quot;<br />
Amelia swallowed hard, staring at the dice in Stacey&#39;s hand as it hovered over the board. The game was set, the pieces in place, and whether they were ready or not, The Enchanted Path was about to begin.</p>
