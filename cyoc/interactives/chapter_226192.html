<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I studied how to work with time, with materia and with magic powers. And than I&#39;ve started to change the world for my own because each planet has only one representetive. And I was going to be a god.<br />
My first worshiper was my little bro, John. I went into a house and found him in a bed, it was an evening. I opened a door and call him.<br />
-Joey??!! He was so excited to see me. He off the blanket and I saw his hairy muscular chest, he has 3 inches hair in there, I also saw his cock&#39;s head on his abs, his cock was as big as my forearm. I totally forgot about my former body. I went near and sat on a bed. John looked at me with his sparkling eyes.<br />
- I&#39;m here to stay. But before it let me help you to finish. I slowly and gently put my arm on his hard, throbbing cock and I started to stroke it. His cock was like a stone but very soft like skin, it was very smooth, I loved it. It took some time but after 5 minutes he was ready.<br />
- Joey!! He called me orgasmically. I felt his hot cock&#39;s flesh vibrated under my palm as my hand was full with hot white man juice. <br />
And with this call I felt my body is answering. Answering with bliss and joy, and a feelling like hot orgasm. I started to grow in height and mass, my muscles bulked up, I was growing to a huge 8 foot 10 giant. But not just muscle mass I was growing bigger cock too. At one point my hand couldn&#39;t take the growth so it fell away, and I started to sprout thick, heavy and long pre-cum like a fountain, John&#39;s bed was covered with my white stuff in seconds, but I was growing and I didn&#39;t know how to stop it, my balls was the size of the grapefruits, each testicle was over the size of his palm, my cock was bigger and harder.<br />
He tried to put it into his mouth and started to lick and suck my growing meaty, juicy cock. And after some minutes I came and gave him my cum. And he was started to grow too. Not that fast but when he finished he was 1 foot higher and 40 pounds heavier.<br />
Jooooeeeyyy.... he moaned with his trembling bass. And than he repeated and reapeated my name. And with my very name I was growing taller and bigger. Suddenly the floor started to cracking under my new weight so I chanted a spell and we teleported to the nearby woods. <br />
John was too horny and he didn&#39;t realise what just happened. He was lost in his growth and his thoughts were only about my size, my cock and my cum. He was helping with his hands and when I came he wasn&#39;t capable to keep it in his mouth, so he was spitting cum in his chest. But I was cumming more and more and it covered his entire body. And it replies with his own growth. I felt he wanted to grow to my size and I was a god and he was just a human. My brother, but just a human. I put him into the dream and teleported to the mister Olympia show, which was just about to start.<br />
There were bodybilders with these disgusting muscle guts which they made with all juices they didn&#39;t used properly. But with my wish it changed. They kept their mass but it was reshaping procidure for them. Someone became taller, someone thicker in arms and so on. They asked my name, because I was taller than a suburban house and I said &quot;Call me Joey&quot;. And when they repetied it with sparks in their eyes I felt that I wa growing again and much faster. After 3 minutes I was over 25 foot. I was getting stronger, I was feeling I have all power in the world. <br />
TV cameras did their job and my magic power started to blow up. I had to do magic or I would be destroyed by this power. And I casted a spell. Every men on the planet started to grow. They were getting bigger. Bigger than before and bigger with each word they said &quot;Jooooeeeyyy&quot;. Even some women became taller, I think it&#39;s because they had hormones but it didn&#39;t matter because I  didn&#39;t want to do a genocide.<br />
I teleported to my brother. He waked up and finished eating my cum. And when I was there he asked me to share my power again with him. And you know, I didn&#39;t hesitate but he was a reason of my state. He was smaller than a head of my cock so I helped myself to cum. And each drop of my cum was as a size of his head. He put his body and started to drink the lake I make. The lake of white and very powerful liquid. He didn&#39;t want to share it and was drinking like a little child who is afraid that other may steal his toy.<br />
With every sip he made his body was growing and it was growing much bigger than before. He drank, drank and drank when the lake was over. Now he was a size of a big mountain and he wasn&#39;t satisfied.<br />
&quot;Joey. I love you so much!&quot; he shouted. And his feeling was love, adoration and obedience. And it made me to grow again. He was big enough to contain my dick in his mouth now and he used is a straw. He and the whole word were worshipping me and all my cum were going inside my brother&#39;s mouth. I wished the whole planet growth to fullfill new sizes of human kind and my brother&#39;s size.<br />
&quot;Joey. I love you. You&#39;re the greatest and most powerful god.&quot; they repeated and they repeated again and again. I was getting taller, much taller.<br />
And now, when the Earth was my size, and my brother was as big as a moon. I came so many times and John was full of my cum and was so full that I think his body couldn&#39;t contain this liquid so he grew bigger to be able to drink more and more of my cum. I guessed it will never ended and it became the time of paradise.</p>
