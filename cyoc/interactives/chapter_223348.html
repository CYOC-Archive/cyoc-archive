<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How about we split the difference?&quot; Lesily probed back, &quot;A ten-year-old girl and her thirty-five year old mom nets 45 years, that would put you in you both in your final year of college.&quot;<br />
<br />
As she spoke, two digital time counters appeared on the stage, each having their full names above them. The counters themselves were showing the years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds, with the second counter ticking upwards. &quot;You sure that&#39;s the twinning yer going for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, Yep, Yep!&quot; Candy chimed back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, let&#39;s start twinning!&quot; The two counters responded to Lesily&#39;s words. Candy&#39;s counter started going faster, the seconds, minutes, hours, and days quickly becoming an unreadable blur. Only the months and years were still readable as they moved faster in time. Amanda&#39;s counter sped up the same way, but her months and years were going backwards. Amanda wasn&#39;t impressed with this as she still didn&#39;t believe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m feeling weird,&quot; said Candy. Amanda looked at her daughter and froze in surprise. Candy was definitely getting taller now. Her sundress was being pulled up her legs as she gained more inches. And if that weren&#39;t enough to convince Amanda, a pair of bumps appeared on Candy&#39;s chest that began slowly pushing out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Candy, you&#39;re getting older!&quot; cried Amanda in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re getting younger, Mom,&quot; said Candy, her voice getting a little deeper as her face was becoming less round.<br />
<br />
Amanda looked at the mirrors and saw she was right. The changes were subtle right now, but they were getting more obvious. Her grey hairs were regaining their full color as her wrinkles were fading away. Her muffin top was shrinking as her breasts were regaining their perkiness. The faded tattoos were getting more vibrant while the C-section scar on her stomach became deeper.<br />
<br />
Turning back to Candy, Amanda saw she had entered teenagerdom. She gained more height as her hips started to flare out. The bumps on her chest had grown into full A cup breasts that were rapidly heading into B cup territory. Her face no longer looked childish as pimples appeared and disappeared regularly. But more importantly, Candy&#39;s clotehs have also changed. Her sundress had split in two, becoming a halter top and a skirt. Her midriff was being put more on display as she gained height.<br />
<br />
One look at the counters showed that Candy was now 15 years old while Amanda was 30. Amanda gaped at not only her increasingly adult daughter but at herself. This was impossible, people couldn&#39;t alter their age.<br />
<br />
Yet, it was hard to deny what she was seeing. Amanda, according to the counter, was about to pass her 30th birthday. The months were ticking away faster than she could have envisioned, her body firming with the loss of years. As she studied her reflection closely, she could see her skin smooth, the small amount of grey vanish, even her physical body was improving her breasts hefting beneath her shirt.<br />
<br />
Entering her twenties Amanda was still in shock. Not only was this incredible, it seemed impossible that no one had said a word about this. Gazing at her tattoos and c-section scar she could see then become more prominent, standing out on her otherwise flawless skin. Even her hairstyle was changing as it regained it&#39;s youthful luster. Gone was short cut of a mother, now replaced with a punky, pixie cut that covered her ears. Amanda gently touched her growing locks, amazed to see her hairstyle returning to the previous style of her youth.<br />
<br />
As Amanda&#39;s counter hit 25, the young woman winced. Something was happening, her body was racked with pain for a moment as her mind began to fog over. Gazing at her stomach, she watched in amazement as her scar began to fade.<br />
<br />
Little by little the c-section scar grew smaller, fainter, until at last vanishing completely as if it had never existed at all. New memories flooded her mind, intermixed with the old. She remembered being a mother but, those memories almost felt alien. New memories now existed, one telling her she had a younger sister. A sister who only moments ago had been her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;OH my god Amanda look!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda glanced over, still in a daze as she observed a now 20 year old Candy. Puberty had been kind to the young woman, blessing her with CC cup breasts and ample curves. Candy&#39;s dirty blonde hair cascaded to the middle of her back, glowing with youthful vitality. Even the girls face was amazing, the pimples and roundness of early adolescence wiped away, revealing a mature and gorgeous face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Candy,&quot; Amanda asked, her voice little more than a whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Check it out,&quot; Candy giggled. &quot;I think I have a better body than you sis.&quot; Amanda frowned, wanting to correct her former daughter but, pausing. She certainly didn&#39;t look like Candy&#39;s mother anymore, she looked like an older sister. A sister who felt a slight pang of jealousy as she gazed at her well endowed younger sibling. &quot;Okay Candy I think that&#39;s enough,&quot; Amanda stated, trying to sound authoritative.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh cmon Amanda don&#39;t be such a buzzkiil,&quot; Candy groaned. Amanda frowned, once more turning to her reflection before gazing at the counter. The months were still falling away from her as Candy gained them. Amanda looked at the woman who was formerly her daughter. Her sundress had become a pink halter top and a Demin skirt that goes down her thighs. Her midriff was more on display and showing off her curvy waistline. Her pink sandals had shifted around her growing feet as they became a pair of pink sneakers with rhinestones on the sides forming an outline of a heart while ankle socks grew out of them. Her pink diamond ears had extended down by the chains and shifted into a pair of hearts. And to top it all off, she had a pink fitbit watch on her wrist and a necklace wrapped around her neck with the word &#39;princess&#39; on it. The timers slowed to a crawl and before too long, the timers were ticking at their usual second-a-second rates. Amanda&#39;s Timer had been shaved to 22 years, 6 months, 4 days, 5 hours, 20 minutes. One look to Candice&#39;s timer and it read more or less the same except the minute counter was on 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Candice ran a hair through her long blonde ponytail as she looked at her reflection. &quot;Damn, I grew up to be a total knockout,&quot; she said, running her fingers through her dirty-blonde ponytail as she posed before a mirror. Amanda felt a little jealousy at how Candice&#39;s CC breasts filled up her halter top. f course, Amanda herself wasn&#39;t homely. Now that she was back before she got pregnant, her figure had slimmed down to before she got the baby weight. Her skin no longer sagged and her tattoos looked more vibrant. With no grey in her hair and no wrinkles around her eyes, she looked as fresh as a college girl. Which considering she was 22 and a half, she probably was one now. She would be enjoying this more if her former daughter weren&#39;t of nearly the same age and outranking her in the curves department. &quot;Ok, this is fun, but maybe we should change back,&quot; said Amanda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Already?&quot; whined Candice, &quot;But I just got like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll see it again when you grow up the natural way,&quot; said Amanda.<br />
<br />
Candice pouted and said, &quot;You can&#39;t tell me what to do. I&#39;m an adult now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m still your older sister,&quot; said Amanda.<br />
<br />
&quot;By only 10 minutes, which you&#39;ve been hanging over me my entire life,&quot; said Candice.<br />
<br />
Just then, both women felt a tingle through them. Amanda looked at Candice and noticed some changes. Her blonde hair had already changed to a dirty blonde as she aged up. But there were also changes in her eyes and facial features. It took Amanda a while to realize that Candice was losing all the traits she had inherited from her father (which Amanda was having a harder time picturing) and becoming more like her. Similarly, Candice noticed that Amanda was getting a little bit taller until she was of equal height. Similarly, her hips and rear pushed out more to match hers. Her crop top suddenly bulged out as her breasts surged up to CCs. And her light brown started to change to dirty blonde.<br />
<br />
When the changes stopped, it had become clear that the two of them weren&#39;t just twin sisters, but identical twins. Amanda had gained her sister&#39;s figure while Candice gained her sister&#39;s features. In fact, asides from their hairstyles, clothes, and Amanda&#39;s tattoos, they couldn&#39;t be told apart from each other. Memories soon flooded their minds of growing up together on similar but slightly different paths. Now the two of them were in their final year of college together.<br />
<br />
Candice adjusted to their new reality first. &quot;Well, Mandy, ready to have some fun now?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you call me?&quot; asked Amanda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Candy and Mandy, a pair of eager twin bachlorettes looking to have a good time at our fair?&quot; Lesily probed back. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re getting cold feet now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda found herself slipping into this new mindset rather easily. She had to admit she missed her wild days and now she had a sister to be her wingwoman. &quot;Is there anything you want to do?&quot; asked Mandy to her twin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hear there&#39;s this primo tattoo artist a short walk from here.&quot; Candy chimed back. &quot;I wanna see if I can get some matching ink done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, just try not to break the bank, alright.&quot; Mandy complained as they walked on their way to a cheering crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s hear it for them, folks, huh!&quot; Lesily bowed before her audience. &quot;Think we can squeeze in one more act before we vamoose?&quot;</p>
