<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was woken by Mum knocking on the door at 9 am. &quot;Sorry to wake you Jenna but we are heading out to brunch with the Naismiths. I have washing on the line. If it looks like raining can you take it off&quot;<br />
<br />
Sleepily I replied. &quot;Ok Mum&quot; <br />
<br />
I lay in bed and thought about getting up, but didn&#39;t. My legs hurt. Maybe it was all the dancing I had done in the high heels last night. I heard my new parents leave and their car drive off.  I was on my own. <br />
<br />
I lay there and contemplated what I should do today. I wasn&#39;t hungover just tired. I knew I needed to do a load of washing. If Jenna had not let anyone into her room for years then certainly Mum didn&#39;t do her washing. I probably should change the sheets as well.<br />
Then there was the emails I should try and follow up. Jenna might have an email account on the family PC. I must check that out. There was also the diaries to look at and the iPad to try and break the lock. I lay on the bed. I haven&#39;t even looked in the boxes up the top of the wardrobe. I would need to get a ladder to reach them. This body was too short to reach.<br />
<br />
A bath would be nice as well, maybe that would ease the pain in my legs. I should ring Sarah also. I think today they were going to try to bring Rod&#39;s body out of the Coma. Should I tell her about last night?<br />
<br />
Oh well things won&#39;t happen on their own. I climbed out of bed. I had grabbed the first sleepware I had lain my hands on, I now found myself in a black satin babydoll type nightie with lace trim. I still had the G-String on underneath. I went to the toilet then returned to my room and picked up the basket in which I had deposited all my dirty clothes near the end of the bed and walked down to the laundry. <br />
<br />
I knew enough from helping my deceased Mum and living alone to wash colors and white clothes separately. The majority of my clothes were colored so I decided to do a colored load first. I looked at the tags. Many of them said use the delicates wash. I would have to sort them out as well. How many loads would I need to do? The red dress I had worn last night didn&#39;t have a tag I could see. It looked like a delicate. Maybe the color would run? Maybe it should be dry-cleaned? I didn&#39;t want to ruin it. I would ask either Sarah or Mum.<br />
I started with a load of colored delicates. Then I thought none of the clothes were dirty at all. A couple of paw prints on the skirt I had worn on Thursday was probably the extent of any dirt. I ended up throwing all the coloreds in except the red dress. <br />
<br />
Down the bottom of the basket were a few items that Jenna must have thrown in the basket before our bodyswap. There was a lime green miniskirt and a silver singlet top, More interesting was what to me looked like a running outfit, some shin length black leggings and what I now knew to be a pink and black sports bra. I would ask Sarah if Jenna was a runner. It was a habit I had both when I was Zach and when I was Rod, something I would prefer to continue to do. Also there were some bikini panties that went in the pile of whites and a green G-String. I wondered whether she wore the G-String with the miniskirt.<br />
<br />
Once all the colored items were in, I added some detergent and set the machine to a delicate wash. I returned the red dress to my room hanging it in the wardrobe and stripped the sheets and pillow cases off my bed. They could go in a second load with the few white clothes.<br />
I looked outside. It was overcast but windy. The clothes should dry quickly if it didn&#39;t actually rain. I could see Mum&#39;s load of washing flapping on a clothes line halfway down the yard. <br />
  <br />
I was still in my black nightie but I was home alone and it wasn&#39;t cold. I went to the kitchen and searched the cupboard to see if there was any cereal other than muesli. Much as I didn&#39;t mind muesli I had always been a Weetbix eater. I found a opened Weetbix box and decided that I could risk being out of character just this once. <br />
<br />
I sat in the kitchen eating my breakfast looking out on the backyard. It was a long skinny yard with Dad&#39;s sheds in the back right hand corner. There was a small deck with a covered BBQ area just outside the sliding glass door I was looking through. There were fruit trees in a row down the right hand side of the yard and a vege garden against the fence on the left hand side. The rotary clothes line was just past the end of the vege garden. There was a cat in the yard down by the back fence. Maybe it belonged to the neighbors. I watched the cat run off, jumping up the fence behind the clothes line. Maybe it was trying to get out of the rain.<br />
<br />
Rain! Mums clothes! There was a basket just outside the door. I opened the door, picked up the basket and ran down to the the clothes line. As quickly as I could I started pulling the clothes off. The rain had only just started and they still felt dry. It was very windy the clothes were flapping madly. I was almost finished, there were just a few socks and a pair of Mum&#39;s knickers left to get off. I had to reach up high to get the peg. Suddenly I couldn&#39;t see. My nightie had blown up into my face I dropped the socks and pulled it back down. How embarrassing, I was glad no-one was home to see that. I got the remaining items off the line then bent over to pick up the socks I had dropped. Another gust and the nightie was back over my head again.  My G-String clad bum was exposed to the world. I held onto the socks this time as I pulled the nightie back down. I threw them in the basket picked it up and ran back toward the house. It was only then that I realized the house next door overlooked that section of the yard. I could see heads looking out the window. <br />
<br />
To make matters worse by the time I had got to shelter near the back door, the rain had stopped. By the time I finished my Weetbix the sun was shining. I decided it was time for a bath.</p>
