<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was obvious to me at this point that the woman must have been controlling everything that happened since everything literally stopped.  I just assumed that the ring she wore was the source of that power.  I wondered if either mine or hers was more powerful.  Something told me it wasn’t a good idea to find out.<br />
<br />
It occurred to me that every decision I had made since I got the ring had been a bad one.  I would only classify myself as having average intelligence, and that intelligence told me that both running away and staying put would be bad decisions.  At this point, pure morbid curiosity got the best of me.  I figured the consequences would be worse if I tried to run, and I was honestly curious what might happen.  I thought this was a “nothing to lose” situation.<br />
<br />
I looked her in the eye and said, “OK, see ya.”  With that I took off down the street as fast as I could.  I made it about ten steps and then I felt my legs lock into place.  I was about to look over my shoulder when my body lifted off the ground.  I floated up in the air about fifteen feet.  My body turned around and I was now facing the woman again.  The look on her face was a mixture of anger and exasperation.  <br />
<br />
I was being pulled closer and closer to the woman when suddenly my own clothes disappeared.  Now I was just as naked as the woman.  “Well, my, look at that,” she said.  “I suppose you would have been angrier if I had called you ‘little boy.’”  She was most definitely referring to the size of my cock.  I was pretty average in all respects.  I had average height, average looks, average build, average speed, average carpentry skills, average whatever.  But I did proudly brandish a well above average sized cock.<br />
<br />
Eventually I was lowered back into the same spot where I stood just a minute ago.  As soon as my shoeless feet hit the ground, I tried to see if I could move.  I was not surprised to find that I could not.  I just stood there in front of her.  She didn’t say anything so I took it that she wanted me to say or do something.  I figured I couldn’t make things much worse at this point, so I smirked and said to her, “Don’t act like you’re not impressed.”<br />
<br />
This got her talking again, though she ignored my bragging remark.  “Now why did you run, young man?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, come on,” I said.  “I knew you were going to do something to me either way.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” she said.  “So you wished to test what I could do to you.”  I was about to respond to her but she cut me off and said, “That was a statement, not a question.  I would hope you know by now that it is this ring that has allowed me to do all of this.  I have a few more questions for you, but as I said, you need to be taught a lesson.  I think that will begin now.”<br />
<br />
Suddenly she was fully clothed again.  I, however, remained in my birthday suit.  Then, to my great shock and horror, the world around us resumed.  People and cars continued on their way, sounds of life returned and I quickly realized that I was fully naked in a public street.  “Aw, shit,” was all I could say.<br />
<br />
She grinned at me and said, “Have a nice day!”  Then she crossed back to the other side of the street without another word.  <br />
<br />
“Oh, my god!” I heard a female voice behind me shout out in distress.  <br />
<br />
I knew that I was in a bit of a pickle now.  But, like the idiot I was, I forgot that I had a ring that could grant wishes.  Without turning around I wished for my clothes to reappear.  They did so immediately.  Now that I was clothed again, I turned around to face the woman and said with a smirk, “I’m sorry, is there something wrong?”<br />
<br />
The woman was a professional-looking, middle-aged woman who also looked like she attended church every day.  Her look of shock did not go away, however, and she said, “Have you no decency?”<br />
<br />
“What?” I asked.  Then I realized I felt a draft.  I looked down and saw that I was naked again.  I yelped a bit and then wished for my clothes to reappear.  They returned, but within two seconds, they were gone again.  I turned around to the other side of the street.  I looked for the woman I had made naked, but I could not see her.  Obviously she could still see me and had the advantage.  I decided to make the best of the situation, if that could be said.  I turned around to the shocked woman and said, “Oh, come on, don’t act like you’re not impressed.”  The woman promptly fainted.  “That turned out nicely.”<br />
<br />
“Excuse me, sir,” I heard another voice off to the side.  I looked and saw a policeman approaching me.  “I think you’d better come with me.”<br />
<br />
“I think that’s a good idea,” I said.  I allowed the policeman to lead me directly into the back of his squad car.  “Well, this has turned out to be a splendid day.”</p>
