<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You pull into the driveway of your house and quickly rush inside to make sure everything is ready for when your     friend gets there. You make some quick dinner, steak and baked potatoes, her favorite meal. You then decide to set up the fold out couch bed in your living room, somewhere for her to lay down while you give her a massage. After double checking everything to make sure it's perfect, you hear a car pull up outside. You hurry to the door and open it to see your     friend standing there. You think back on how lucky you are to have her as a     friend. She has a near perfect body, nice ample C cups, gorgeous        hair that flows like a beautiful serpent down to her tight attractive rear. She smiles at you and you wordlessly embrace her and kiss her, not passionately, but enough to indicate your close relationship. You lead her inside and pull a chair out for her to sit at for dinner. She sits down and you go to your own seat. You don't talk very much at the table, only the casual how was your day kind of stuff. After dinner was finished you lead her into the living room. You have her lie down on the bed and tell her to take off her clothes. She looks at you in confusion and asks you why. You respond that it's a suprise that you think she'll love, and wink at her. She gets the message and begins to remove her long skirt and sleeveless t-shirt, while you go and get the massage oil. You come back with it to see her sitting on the bed, her feminine glory radiating. You tell her to lie down on her stomach and she complies. You squirt some of the oil on your hands and begin rubbing it into her back. she moans in delight as the oil is rubbed in. She had always hinted that she was turned on by massages, but you were never quite sure. You continue with the massage and once you finish her back, you move down to her legs. you begin rubbing it into her waist and thighs when you get an interesting thought and grin in delight. You take the bottle and position it by her lips. She feels the touch and moans louder, the sudden arousal making her      begin to moisten. You grin and squirt a large amount of oil into her     . She screams from the sudden feeling of the oil inside her. She begins to writh on the bed. Her shuddering and moaning on the bed really turns you on and you continue the massage with a passion. You finish with her legs and tell her to roll over. She does and you decide to prolong the pleasure. You start at the tips of her toes and work your way up. When you reach her waist again you decide to repeat your previous actions. This time you want her to scream more, because it really turned you on last time. You shove the entire top of the bottle inside her already soaked      and squease the bottle hard. She screams louder than before and begins to writh wildly on the bed. You continue to squease more and more of the oil into her, while taking your free hand and rubbing your very hard member. Her screaming increases in volume and you decide to finish it as fast as you can. You take the bottle out of her, much to her dissapointment. You squirt more onto your hands and quickly massage the oil into her stomach. Whe  you get to her         you begin to knead them and rub them passionately. This makes her even more arroused than she already was. She screams loudly, making your member even harder. Her eyes are closed but when you start on her neck they flutter open. You rub some into her forehead and cheeks. She opens her mouth to try and tell you something. You stop to let her speak. &quot;In ... my ... mouth&quot; She manages to get out, between gasps. You put the bottle to her lips and she begins to drink. She swallows two mouthfulls and then you pull the bottle away. after all, you don't know if this stuff is toxic. You are done with the massage, but there is still a small amount left in the bottle. It's not enough for another massage, so you decide to please her again. You move towards her      again. She realizes what you are trying to do and arches her back to try and make the oil go in farther. You take the lid off completely and dump the rest of the contents down her     . She screams again at this and her body begins to twitch. You realize she is trying to hold it in until the whole bottle is down so you try and force the oil out faster. Once it is empty and you see that it has all gone down, you nod to her. She sees the signal and her body loses all control, she twists and writhes on the bed, rolling over to her stomach and grinding her C cups, and soaking croth against the bed. She screams at random intervals throughout this. She slows down and looks up at you. &quot;I ... need ... you.&quot; She pants out. rolling onto her back and arching her back again, presenting herself to you. You grin and turn around, stripping as fast as you can. Before you finish she begins to scream again, you turn around to see her on her stomach, but...something is wrong with her back. You look closer and see her back, where you started the massage, slowly being covered in glistening green and black scales. You can only stare in wonder as the scales spread, quickly covering her back and going downward. When the scales get to her crotch it is as if something exploded. Scales rose up almost instantly around her     , rushing down her legs like a waterfall. As soon as her legs were covered, they began drawing together, starting at her crotch and moving down her body. Her legs combined and began to lengthen, growing to almost 12 feet in length. You continue to stare in awe as the scales begin working upwards from her waistline. She rolls over onto her back as if to accomadate you. The scales on her chest change to a dark yellow color. Working up her stomach slowly, as if to prolong the beauty of the moment. When they reached her chest her C cups seemed almost to expand outwards, like someone was inflating them. They quickly passed D and E, finally settling at an amazing F! She felt them expanding and became hot again, the scales covering her chest, working their way out to her hard       s, which were now the size of your index finger! The scales seemed to stop at her neck and instead went down her arms. When they reached her hands, the scales went down each finger and ended in a 3 inch long claw at the end of every finger. Then the scales at her neck continued, covering her head. Her eyes became slitted, going from their normal shade of light blue to pale green. Her nose stayed the same, and as her mouth opened in a gasp, you could see a long forked tounge and her canines completing their transformation into long fangs. After her face and head were finished, her hair began to change. It lengthened, stopping at a total length of about 5'10&quot;. Then it changed from the vibrant        that you loved to black. This seemed to signal that the change was finished, and she slowly raised her upper body. She wasn't entirely aware of what had happened, only that something was different. She slowly opened her eyes and gasped in shock. She looked over her body, stopping suddenly at her chest, which she could still easily see over since her neck had lengthened slightly. Her gasps of confusion slowly began to change to sighs of...arrousal? She began to moan again, quietly. She was getting arroused again from the sight of her own body! She finally looked up at you, and caused your heart to almost stop when she peirced you with her eyes. She began to hiss, her forked tounge flicking out of her mouth. She grinned evilly and looked you over with an inspecting gaze. She sighed sadly when she got to your waist. &quot;That'ssss pathetic. You could never ssssatissssfy me with that ssssmall thing. Your are usssselesssss to me.&quot; She said, and began to turn away, as her gaze left you, you felt your breath return in small gasps. Then she suddenly turned back, causing you to gasp sharply. She had an evil malicious look on her face. &quot;On ssssecond thought, maybe you can be of usssse to me.&quot; You almost choked on your own tounge as you stood completely still, frozen to the spot by fear. She slithered over to you. She bent her head towards you and embraced you with a kiss. Your brain sighed slightly in relief, but this was short lived. She stopped kissing you and swiftly drew back her head. Darting foreward and plunging her venom filled fangs into your neck. You screamed and thrashed about in shock. Her fangs pumping your bloodstream full of the toxic venom. She pulled away and reclined her body, the malicious smile still on her face. You stared at her in shock, then everything began to blurr. your vision went black and you collapsed, the venom performing its job and stopping your nervous system. You fell heavily onto the floor. You were dead. She slithered over to your corpse and began to eat. She opened her mouth, much wider than before thanks to her new anatomy, and swallow your still body whole. After she had completely swallowed you, she layed back down on the bed, falling into a light sleep as she waited for the meal to digest. As she drifted into her light slumber, she decided to change something about herself. What was her old name? She couldn't remember, but decided on calling herself Vipriss. She smiled and fell into her slumber, your dead carcass being digested inside her.<br />
