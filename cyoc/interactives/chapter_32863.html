<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick wondered what Jenny and her parent's house looked like. He figured he would find out soon enough. To occupy his time until then he thought about what had happened so far. He had somehow transformed into a four year old girl. These people claimed that they were his family yet they said they knew he wasn't their daughter. How did they have pictures of him in this body and have an id for him? Things just didn't add up. In order for them to have those things he would have to be their daughter which he wasn't. He kept going over it in his<br />
mind but it didn't make sense.<br />
<br />
Soon they pulled up to a two story white house and Rick was led inside. Once inside they took off the coat he was wearing and sat him down on a couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell us what you remember&quot; Jenny's mother said. &quot;Do you have any memories of being our daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Rick said still surprised by his little girl's voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who were you before?&quot; Jenny's father asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a thirty-four year old guy and my name is Rick&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you have any brothers or sisters?&quot; Jenny's mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I have a brother&quot; Rick said. &quot;I also have nieces and nephews. Now perhaps you can tell me what's going on here. Why am I a four year old girl? Why do you say that I'm your daughter? Why have you said that you know I'm not your daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a couple more questions then we'll be able to answer your questions&quot; Jenny's father said. &quot;Did you have or see a medallion?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I did have a medallion&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did it look like?&quot; Jenny's mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It had a picture of some winged deity on the front&quot; Rick said. &quot;It was blank on the back. It looked like it might have been made from copper.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny's mother sighed and said &quot;Just as we thought Tom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It appears so&quot; Jenny's father said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you think?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The medallion transformed you&quot; Jenny's mother said. &quot;The medallion you had is called the Medallion of Zulo. We have a book that has the description of the medallion and it's powers. Here's a quick explanation though. The medallion was created to transform the wearer when a piece of clothing was touched to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So the medallion transformed me into a four year old girl&quot; Rick said. &quot;But I wasn't wearing it when I touched it and the dress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we've heard that one of the fifty medallions was changed a bit&quot; Jenny's father said. &quot;It is now suppose to work just by touching it and an article of clothing. Another change that's suppose to be on this particular one is the ability to alter reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why did you say that you know that I'm not your daughter?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We said that you weren't our daughter earlier today&quot; Jenny's mother said. &quot;Now with reality being changed you are our daughter. It's a shame that you don't have any new memories of being our daughter, it would make things so much easier. As it is we have to tell you about yourself as Hannah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'm not your daughter&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are in a new reality now&quot; Jenny's father said. &quot;In this reality you are our daughter. You'll just have to accept that your old life is no more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to call my mother&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She won't recognize you&quot; Jenny's mother said. &quot;Reality has changed and you, as you were, were never born. Instead you were born a girl four years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to call my mother!&quot; Rick shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok you can call&quot; Jenny's father said. &quot;I should have known you would have to find out for yourself. Here's the phone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick took the phone and called his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello&quot; his mother answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don't freak out&quot; Rick said, &quot;but it's me Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; his mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's me Rick&quot; he said. &quot;Your oldest son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this some type of joke?&quot; his mother asked. &quot;I only have one son and his name isn't Rick and he certainly doesn't sound like a little girl. Now I would like to speak to your parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick hung his head as he handed the phone to Jenny's father and said, &quot;She wants to talk to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that&quot; Jenny's father said. &quot;My daughter insisted on calling you. She had a dream last night that she was really a thirty-four year old guy. We've had this happen once before with another person. She was so insistent that she was a different person then too.&quot;<br />
<br />
He listened a bit then said &quot;We think we know what it is. Both times we had tried some different food the nights she had the dreams. It must not agree with her, giving her strange dreams that seem so real to her that she believes them to be true. You can be sure that we won't be having that again.&quot; He chuckled at something and then said &quot;Well you know kids and their beliefs. I'll let you get back to<br />
what you were doing, bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jenny's father hung up the phone he looked at Rick and said &quot;I'm sorry that you had to find out for yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick just sat there and didn't say anything.<br />
<br />
Jenny's mother, now Rick's mother too, hugged him and said &quot;It's ok, we're here for you. We'll make you as happy as possible from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick looked up at his new mother with a smile on his face and said, &quot;I'm happy now. You see I had always thought that I should have been born a girl and now I am a girl. This is a dream come true for me though I will miss my old family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course you will sweetie&quot; his mother said. &quot;At least it won't upset you to know that we couldn't find the medallion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why couldn't you find it?&quot; Rick asked. &quot;It should have been right on top of the dresses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We think that the lady that came up to you took it&quot; his mother said. &quot;We also think she took it because she is a member of the Brotherhood of Zulo. You'll learn more about them when you read about the medallion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do have another question&quot; Rick said. &quot;How come you know that I wasn't your daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reality shifts don't affect us since we have been trained to notice them&quot; his new father said. &quot;We'll be training you to notice them too along with other things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When will you be teaching me?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can start now&quot; his mother said. &quot;What color is your dress?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's red of course&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was pink before&quot; Jenny finally said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I saw myself in the mirror&quot; Rick said. &quot;I saw myself wearing the same red Christmas dress I have on now. I haven't changed it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I changed reality a bit so that instead of a pink dress you are wearing a red one&quot; his mother said. &quot;Now how long is your hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's down to my waist&quot; Rick said. &quot;Wait a second, it was just a little past my shoulders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good Hannah&quot; his mother said. &quot;You're starting to notice reality changes. Now what pair of panties are you wearing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They were pink with Disney princesses on them&quot; Rick said, &quot;but now they're white with Minnie Mouse on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good Hannah&quot; his mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;My turn&quot; Jenny said. She mumbled a few words then asked &quot;What am I wearing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a blue dress with gold trim&quot; Rick said. &quot;Now you're wearing a tan shirt and black pants. Why don't you change back to your dress. What your wearing now will not look good in the family portrait.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True&quot; Jenny said and mumbled some more words. Her dress reappeared in an instant.<br />
<br />
&quot;How have you been doing that?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're using a time spell&quot; his mother said. &quot;It allows us to change things in the past which naturally causes reality to shift.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I changed my dress I actually went back in time and chose different clothes to wear&quot; Jenny said. &quot;You'll be able to do the same thing before long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I go back and decide not to pick up the medallion?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then things should return to the way they were&quot; his father said. &quot;Only you can go back and do that but it may not work. The medallion is blessed by a god after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's all for now&quot; his mother said. &quot;I'll show you your room and then I'll get dinner ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
They went upstairs to Rick's new room. There was a sign on the door that read 'Hannah's Room'. When Rick opened the door he saw that the walls were painted a pastel pink. The carpet was a very light, almost white, pink color. There was a white dresser with a pastel pink top and knobs. The bed was a canopy bed with pink curtains and 'Princess' in gold flowing script on the canopy. There were dolls and stuffed<br />
animals in nets and on the dresser. The curtains on the windows were a light pastel pink. There was a pink Disney Princess TV on a stand in one corner. There was also a pink Disney Princess bean bag chair in front of the TV. A shelf out of his reach had some thin books on it. There was no doubt that it was a little girl's room.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you like it?&quot; his mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love it!&quot; Rick exclaimed. &quot;It really makes me feel like a little girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad you love it sweetie&quot; his mother said. &quot;Now it's time for me to get dinner ready.&quot;</p>
