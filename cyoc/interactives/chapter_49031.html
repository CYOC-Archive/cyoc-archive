<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">‘The next three different creatures of myth you think of will become part of you..’<br />
<br />
“Creatures of myth? As in like Fairies? Oh no!” An acute sense of vertigo overtook Jen. Everything around her grew! “No! I don’t want to be a fairy!” Her voice was already much higher, but not shrill, she could feel her body changing in more ways then just height, the muscles she had built up through cheerleading disappeared, her features became pointed, inhumanly so. <br />
<br />
Her hands shrunk, adopting the appearance of the hands of a princess, someone who never did anything with her hands, let alone athletics. Her feet also shrank going from a womanly small size to an impractically delicate state, making it a slight challenge to stand.<br />
<br />
Her skin seemed to become fleshy glass, to smooth to be real. The few scars she had, mostly on her hands vanished. The changes seemed to stop. <br />
<br />
She looked around herself, taking in the new perspective, she no longer could see over the counter, hell, she could barely reach the bowl which was only a few inches away from the edge. “Well, I’m bigger then I thought I’d be…do I have wings?” Jen reached around herself and felt around on her back, nothing.<br />
<br />
“What a jip! I became like 3 ft. tall and I don’t even get wings?” She also felt weak. She could tell she’d have great difficulty with her backpack, assuming it was proportioned to her. “Hey my clothes still fit! They feel a little odd though.” her clothes felt rather ruff, probably do to her literally perfect skin.<br />
<br />
She looked at the note again, now seemingly twice as big as it had been, the writing had changed, now saying ‘the next two different creatures of myth you think of will become part of you.’<br />
<br />
“’will become part of you?’” she said, “As in not all the way? I guess that’s why I’m three foot and have no wings.”<br />
<br />
“Well it could be worse, I could’ve become part medusa, NO! WHY DID I HAVE TO THINK OF THAT!” This time the sensations were much more localized, focusing on her hair, eyes, and legs.<br />
<br />
Her hair came to life, twirling sections of itself together  and fusing together into scaly bodies. On some level of consciousness she could feel the different minds in the snakes becoming part of her. She knew where everything in the room was, even though she couldn’t see it. “Oh god! I’m truly a freak now!” She burst into tears, the snakes that her hair had become became upset and started moving about restlessly, causing her to cry harder.<br />
<br />
Her legs suddenly stopped working, causing her to fall forward. She was able to catch herself before she hit the floor. Her legs started fusing together, thickening and becoming much longer. She knew her legs were becoming a giant snake’s tail.<br />
<br />
“No…please no…”<br />
<br />
Her eyes started to sting. The stinging stopped just as quickly as it started.<br />
<br />
She felt power in them. She new her gaze held terrible magic in them, but she also knew that it was too weak to kill instantly. Perhaps a few minutes would turn someone permanently into stone, but short of that they would eventually recover.<br />
<br />
Slowly she raised herself  into what ammounted to kneeling. She was about two and a half feet tall this way. “Kyle…you bastard. I’ll kill you!” she screamed.<br />
<br />
She started to try and move with her new body and to get used to her knew awareness from her snake hair.<br />
<br />
“I wonder if this is what it would be like to have multyple heads.” she thought, “like that one thing, the hydra? DANM IT! Another freaky snake thing! AAAARGH!”<br />
<br />
Her fear had progressed into absolute fury. Kyle was going to pay dearly for what he’d done. <br />
<br />
She could feel herself becoming larger again, along with four mounds, two next to her neck and two more right behind them near her shoulder blades. She stopped growing when her head was about 5 ft off the ground, her tail was taking up quite a bit of her room now.<br />
<br />
Abruptly, the strangest and most unsettling change so far took place. She suddenly saw five different views, heard five different sets of sounds, smelled her room five separate times all at once. Then these new area’s of perception started to shift, moving farther from her body. She knew what had happened, she now had four new heads, and their necks were lengthening. Her new minds while linked together, were still separate, giving her a truly bizarre look at the world. “My other heads are lizard heads!” two of her heads said simultaneously, looking at the rest of her from their new vantage points, about 3 feet worth of strong serpentine neck. <br />
<br />
Another was examining her new hair, “That’s almost as disturbing as these other heads.”<br />
<br />
The final head was looking at her tail, “If it wasn’t part of me, it would actually look rather pretty.” it sighed.<br />
<br />
Jens original head stared strait ahead trying to grasp this new change. “I’m more of a freak then those monsters in those old stories. I can’t believe it.”<br />
<br />
The head that was looking at her hair responded quickly, “I’m so going to kill that dweeb.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll make him part of my houses garden, no one messes with me and gets away with it, especially like this.” one of the heads that had been looking at the other heads hissed.<br />
<br />
“Maybe I should crush him? He should have a taste of every part of my change.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll bit his legs off!”<br />
<br />
“Break his ribs!”<br />
<br />
“Poison him!”<br />
<br />
“Strangle him!”<br />
<br />
“Turn his flesh to stone!”<br />
<br />
“I’ll KILL HIM!” they all roared.<br />
<br />
Jen stopped suddenly, “I-I-I honestly want to kill him. I really want to kill someone.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to be a monst-”<br />
<br />
“He’s already made me one!”<br />
<br />
“I’ll kill him for thi-”<br />
<br />
“Do I really want him dead? Or is it just these monsters that are part of me that want to kill him?”<br />
<br />
“Does it really matter?”<br />
<br />
“Of course it does! What if I kill him and can’t stop? What if I kill everyone in town?”<br />
<br />
“No I won’t let that happen!”<br />
<br />
“But if I let myself kill Kyle, who’s to say I could control myself?”<br />
<br />
“But-but”<br />
<br />
“It’s  his fault!”<br />
<br />
“I can still change back though!”<br />
<br />
At this all of her heads turned towards the bowl of cookies, she began to reach for them only to be stopped by an invisible shield.<br />
<br />
She hissed in anger, her hair, her heads, even her ‘human’ one.<br />
<br />
“I’ll find him first! Then I’ll decide what to do!” She roared, the extra heads echoing each other.</p>
