<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After his would-be twin clicked on the save button, Jeff wait expectantly for a few moments. He had believed that he would have an epiphany of sorts, and just remember everything. However, nothing seemed to change except their shared profile&#39;s cool down which reset and doubled in time. Twenty-four hours and counting. Jeff glanced at his brother, but he seemed to have the same quizzical look. &quot;So... do you remember anything?&quot; Jeff asked aloud anyways, hoping that something positive happened to make-up for the increase in the timer. <br />
<br />
Cameron shook his head. &quot;No, nothing...&quot; he sighed heavily. Cameron shifted his hand away from the mouse, and Jeff laced his arm with his to from crossed arms over their chest. At the same time, Jeff pushed with his leg to spin the chair around while they jointly placed both feet on the ground, a moment later, to stop the spin so they faced the door. &quot;Now we&#39;re stuck together for a whole 24 hours while knowing nothing of each other...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff braced his leg as he felt Cameron cross his leg over. &quot;Not only that. We don&#39;t anything about how our family, school, or anything else that directly effects us has changed.&quot; <br />
<br />
A moment later, both Cameron and Jeff took account of their crossed legs and arms. &quot;Did we...&quot; they spoke at the same time. &quot;We did!&quot; they cheered. Each unlaced their arm and slapped the palms of their hands together in a resounding high five. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I redact my earlier comment.&quot; Cameron smiled. &quot;The program did give us memories.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff matched his brother&#39;s smile. He remembered from science class when learning about the brain. The Chronivac had gifted them with procedural memory; they had the knowledge and experience of moving together their entire lives. They would not have to stumble around and fane some lie to explain their lack of coordination to their family. Jeff, in his excitement, pushed himself out of the chair but his brother lagged behind in following the movement. They stumbled a few steps forward before regaining balance. &quot;Sorry.&quot; Jeff hastily but genuinely apologized. &quot;Right, we have the experience of sharing a body for years, but we&#39;re still....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two pilots in the same plane.&quot; Cameron said. &quot;No worries J. I knew you were just excited. Even still, communication is going to be key for us, just as it always has been.&quot; Cameron looked up for a moment and smiled. &quot;Remember that time we were playing lazertag with the family. Talk about an epic fail in communicating...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff did remember that incident, as if a lightbulb went off in his mind. They were 10 at the time. On the rare occasion, their sisters of the same age, Jill and Julie, were teamed willingly together, opposite of Cameron and himself. During the elimination lazertag game, Jeff and his brother were in hot pursuit of their sisters. Jeff and his brother had already had several brief arguments during and before the game, so their teamwork was not what it usual was. It was Jeff&#39;s turn to be the trigger hand, which meant that Cameron had to hold the gun under the base so it would fire. The gun apparently needed two hands to fire, as there were two sensors. However, both of them wanted to be the aimer which meant that their shots were often off target. Their sisters, being a little devious in their own rights hatched the perfect plan. As he and Cameron chased them down the hall, firing wildly, they split up at a T-intersection. Julie went one way and Jill went the other. It did not work out so well when he and Cameron attempted doing the same thing. He remembered that they both tried leaning into the turn, to signal the other of their intention; while at the same time, their momentum propelled them forward, into the wall. <br />
<br />
Jeff smiled, &quot;Yeah, not our best moment. At least we learned from it... Don&#39;t you remember...&quot; Several new memories seemed to rush into his mind, where he and Cameron were in complete sync. Next year at lazertag, they changed strategies and ended up with the highest score. They were playing a mortal kombat and earned a perfect kill against a friend. While pulling a late night to finish both of their essays for class, they typed flawlessly together to finish each other&#39;s words, sentences, and finally the essays. <br />
<br />
Cameron smiled knowingly, &quot;Yeah, I think I do remember...&quot; After pausing for a moment, he continued, &quot;You know, I think this will work out just fine. I was worried there for awhile about my decision to experience being a conjoined twin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me about it...&quot; Jeff agreed, mirroring his brother&#39;s smile. In truth, he was regretting his decision. But now that he and Cameron &#39;knew&#39; each other and experienced at least some of their new memories, he felt a powerful bond between them. They were not strangers anymore but truly brothers. <br />
<br />
&quot;See you guys...&quot; The voices of Josh and Chris spoke in tandem from the first floor. Jeff figured that their older brothers&#39; football team buddies must be leaving. The heavy steps of their older brothers climbing the stairs followed the front door being closed. Jeff listened intently as their older brothers turned the corner for their bedroom, which shared a wall with the room he and Cameron were currently in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Say Cam, how do you feel about pulling a prank on our elder brothers...&quot; Jeff smiled deviously. &quot;I, or we, must have modified them to share a body originally, right?&quot; Cameron nodded his head. The corners of his lips also raised into a smile, seemingly understanding Jeff&#39;s unspoken idea. &quot;What do you think would happen if we shifted their personal memories from fully altered to unaltered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like the way you think.&quot; Cameron smiled. The two then rubbed their fingertips together in the likeness of an evil mastermind coming up was a scheme. &quot;They may be much nicer to us now, but that does not mean they haven&#39;t been a little cruel in the past with their pranks on us. Lets do it.&quot;</p>
