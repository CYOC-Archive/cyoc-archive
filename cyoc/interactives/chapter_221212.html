<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After lying about Eric’s whereabouts, and satisfied that the “dumb” kids believed it, the disguised grown up grins inwardly, ‘man, kids are so dumb and naive,’ he thinks to himself, ‘hehe… when I am done, everyone will ask themselves what has happened to the kids, unaware that they are with me!’<br />
<br />
The 12 year-old continues to play and have fun with the other boys, keeping his act up, ‘being a kid again is kinda sweet,’ Ryan thinks to himself, ‘hehe… won’t be the last time I transform myself into a kid.’<br />
<br />
Eric himself, now simply clothes been worn by Ryan, continues to try and figure out why he… it feels so confused. Every time one of the kids bring up this “Eric” fellow, it feels as though they mean it, the “clothes” feel a part of themselves scream out to its… friends?… trying to get them to help it… but why? Clothes don’t have friends, right? Their only purpose is to be worn, which they are being right now. His owner feels so good inside of it, it feels so good feeling itself hugging its owner’s body, smelling its owner’s strong and dominant musk… this is what it has been made for, so why was it questioning everything. The “clothes” mentally grumble, hoping that everything will become clear soon.<br />
<br />
Ryan senses his “clothes” frustration and confusion, the “boy” smirks inwardly, reaching up a hand to his “necklace”, rubbing the dog tags, between his fingers, mentally smirking when he feels his clothes seeming to shiver slightly. The two small tag, which had been Eric’s balls, have Ryan’s altered year of birth stamped on them, the right “tag” as a “20” and the left “tag” as a “11”, since it’s the year 2023, this matches Ryan’s “age”, which is currently 12. Would Ryan make himself younger or older, the year of birth on the “tags” would adjust to the right year. The big “tag”, which has been Eric’s cock, as “Ryan” stamped on it.<br />
<br />
“Hey, guys,” Ryan then hears Ben, Jeff’s little 12 year-old brother, pipe up, “Eric has been gone to long. I’d better go and check on him.”<br />
<br />
‘This is my chance to have some more fun,’ Ryan thinks to himself, ‘I need a new t-shirt, I’ll think of something to do with the rest of his body later.’ The “boy” then gets up, “let me help you search,” he says, “four eyes see more than just two.”<br />
<br />
Ben, who is already heading out the door, shrugs, “suit yourself,” he says, not noticing that Ryan is typing in his phone.<br />
<br />
As he follows Ben, Ryan pulls up the boy’s file:<br />
<br />
Name: Ben Davis<br />
Age: 11<br />
Gender: male<br />
Race: Caucasian<br />
Hair colour and style: black, short undercut<br />
Eye colour: brown<br />
Sexual orientation: straight<br />
Relationship status: single<br />
Awareness: off<br />
<br />
Just as with Eric, Ryan deletes all of the unnecessary detail: name, age, gender, sexual orientation and relationship status. Ryan smirks, this would cause Ben to become confused and would believe anything Ryan would tell him.<br />
<br />
At that point, the two boys reach the bathroom, Ben knocks on the door, “Eric, you okay,” he asks, when there is no answer, Ben knocks on the door, “Eric, hey… you in there?”<br />
<br />
Ryan acts quickly, he types in a command which will make Ben enter the bathroom, he confirms the command.<br />
<br />
“I’m coming in,” Ben says, reaching for the door knob, “so, you better pull up your pants,” he adds, opening the door and stepping inside, not seeming to question why the door wasn’t locked.<br />
<br />
Ryan follows Ben into the small bathroom and closes the door behind them, locking it, he then confirms the other change and looks up to see what will happen.<br />
<br />
When Ben enters the bathroom, finding it empty, he stops for a second, scratching his head, enough time for Ryan to confirm the change. Ben suddenly feels light headed, the boy groans, clutching his head with a hand, while he leans against the wall, to prevent him from falling over.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” Ryan asks, acting concerned, “you okay, Ben?”<br />
<br />
Ben, his back turned to Ryan, answers in a weak voice, “I… who’s “Ben”? Who… what am I?”<br />
<br />
Ryan smirks, “right, silly me,” he says, “a mannequin has no name.”<br />
<br />
“Ma… Mannequin?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Ryan replies, “why are you leaning to the side? Mannequins stand up straight!”<br />
<br />
Not thinking, Ben straightens himself, “s-sorry,” he says, turning around to face Ryan.<br />
<br />
“Why are you moving,” Ryan asks, tilting his head, “mannequins don’t move!”<br />
<br />
“R-right, I… I forgot,” Ben says, standing totally straight and stiff.<br />
<br />
Ryan smiles, “now, you look pretty confused,” he says, “tell me, what is confusing you?”<br />
<br />
“I… I don’t know,” Ben says, “it is as if I am split in two. Like… a part of me knows I am just a mannequin, but the other part seems to tell me I am a human,” he looks at Ryan, worry in his eyes, “pl-please… c-can you help me figure out what is wrong?”<br />
<br />
Ryan grins, “of course,” he says, “first, you never were a human, if you think hard you must know this to be true, right?”<br />
<br />
Ben scrunches up his face, thinking hard, “I… I don’t know.”<br />
<br />
“Well, do you have a name?”<br />
<br />
“N-no.”<br />
<br />
“How old are you?”<br />
<br />
“I… I don’t understand,” Ben says, “I… I mean I am a pretty new mannequin… if… if that is what you mean.”<br />
<br />
Ryan smirks, “are you a male or female mannequin?”<br />
<br />
“Um… we mannequins are genderless, so… I dunno.”<br />
<br />
“Well, there you have it,” Ryan says, “only humans have a name, age and gender. So, what are you?”<br />
<br />
“I… I must be a… man… mannequin,” Ben mumbles.<br />
<br />
Ryan nods, “very good,” he says, “you are a smart mannequin. But mannequins don’t usually talk, so, no talking, mannequin!”<br />
<br />
Ben abruptly closes his mouth.<br />
<br />
Ryan smiles, “now, I’m going to tell you why you are here, but first: I need you out of those out-dated clothes,” he says, Ryan then pulls out a knife from his new jacket, which he had taken from the dining room table without anyone noticing. It is a sharp knife, which will easily slice through the “mannequin’s” clothes, Ryan first slices Ben’s shirt down the middle and pulls it off of the boy’s body. Ryan grins, “what a nice athletic plastic torso you have,” he says, looking up at Ben who remains silent and with no noticeable emotion on his face, Ryan grins and goes to work on the jeans. Slicing through the jeans is a little harder, due to the thicker fabric, but Ryan soon has the jeans seams sliced open and removes them from the boy’s body, he then slices the boy’s briefs, discarding the pieces onto a pile on the floor. Ryan then kneels down and undoes Ben’s shoes, pulling them off along with the socks, he looks up at Ben, grinning when his eyes notice Ben’s flaccid tiny cock dangling between his legs.<br />
<br />
Ryan straightens up and looks Ben in the eyes, “okay, now let me tell you what I need you for,” he says, “your head will become a pair of medium sized black boxer briefs, which will fit my body once I am back to my old self, your torso will become a cool white t-shirt with the image of a big black scull, which will match the scull on my jacket, your cock and balls will become a delicious hot-dog, while the rest of your body will shrink to fit in my jacket until I come up with an idea what to do with them.<br />
<br />
While explaining, Ryan is typing into his phone, he then grins at Ben, “but, I should disassemble you, I don’t want your body parts creating a noise when they fall to the ground,” Ryan types in a second change, after saving the changes for Ben’s body.<br />
<br />
When Ryan confirms the change, he grins when he notices seams appear around Ben’s neck, shoulders, genitals and waist. Ryan then reaches both of his hands and grabs Ben’s head, with a strong pull, Ben’s head pops off his body, “creepy, but also cool,” Ryan says with a grin, he places the head gently on the floor and then does the same with the arms, placing them next to the head. Ryan detaches Ben’s cock, the hole left behind seals itself, leaving a genderless torso with legs behind. Grinning, Ryan lies the cock and balls to the pile of body parts and then moves his hands to the torso, gripping it tight and after a little wriggling and pulling, it pops off of the waist, Ryan winces at the weight and quickly but carefully, not wanting to make a noise, places the torso next to the rest of what once was Ben’s body.<br />
<br />
Ryan smirks down, staring at Ben’s head, the boy’s eyes, the only thing moving, looking up at Ryan, not a trace of emotion on the dismembered boy’s face and even his eyes look empty, “now, ready to become what you are meant to be,” he asks, “I promise, you’ll enjoy your new purpose in life. But… should I start with you head, since I am hungry, maybe I should first change your cock and balls? Maybe even have one of the other boys eat the yummy “hot-dog”? Hehe… hmm… or should I first change your torso into my new and much cooler t-shirt?”<br />
<br />
Ben, of course, stays silent, after all, he is a mannequin and mannequins don’t talk, Ryan grins, “I think I know what you want me to change first,” he says, starting to type into his phone.</p>
