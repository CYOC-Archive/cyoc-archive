<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad decided to play along...he'd kick Kyle's ass for this later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, transform.&quot;  He chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really shouldn't have said that, Bradley.  You're a strong man, Brad.  You like to use <br />
that strength to get anything you want.  Like force yourself on a girl.  I don't like that, so <br />
I'm taking away your power.  Bradley Preston, I'm going to make you transform into the <br />
thing you like so much...a pretty, powerless girl.  Ciao!&quot;<br />
<br />
The line went dead.  Something about that little girl's voice...it was familiar...and <br />
frightening.<br />
<br />
And then he felt a sharp pain in his abdomen.  Cold sweat covered his body and he <br />
doubled over, falling onto his bed.  &quot;Oh God...what...what's happening to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Jenny giggled as she set down the phone.  &quot;I bet that's going to hurt.  It's going to be a few <br />
hours before we see him...why don't you get us something to eat?   I'm starved after <br />
waiting outside all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle shivered.  &quot;I'm going to be honest.  You scare the hell out of me, Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled at him cutely.  &quot;Good.&quot;<br />
<br />
He hurried upstairs to raid the fridge.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Brad came to some time later.  He felt better...he was breathing easier.  &quot;Oh man..&quot;  He <br />
groaned.  Then stopped.<br />
<br />
That wasn't his voice.  It sounded softer, feminine...<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
Same voice.  He sat up quickly, and regretted it.  There was a sharp pain in his head, and <br />
his vision blurred.  When he could see again, he found himself looking at his hand.<br />
<br />
It wasn't his hand.  The skin was fair, smooth...it was small, delicate.  The nails were short, <br />
but still longer than his own....it was a girl's hand.   He looked to his other hand, which <br />
was barely poking out of his sleeve.  His clothes felt loose, he was practically swimming in <br />
the shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no...God no...&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned to face his mirror.  Looking back at him was a petite, pretty girl.  She looked <br />
young...maybe 15 or so.  She had the same color eyes, and the same general features...but <br />
much more delicate and feminine.  His brown hair was longer, falling to his....her <br />
shoulders.  He looked positively tiny in his clothes.  He fumbled with the buttons of his <br />
shirt, and pulled it open, revealing a pair of small, yet perfect breasts.<br />
<br />
In shock, he touched one of his breasts.  The nipple hardened at his touch, and he felt a <br />
strange sense of pleasure run through his body.  He shivered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a fucking girl?!  No...no, I can't be....&quot;<br />
<br />
And then he remembered.  KYLE!  <br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Kyle's parents had come home, and went to bed early after dinner.  When Kyle came <br />
downstairs, he found Jenny playing Soulcalibur II on his old X-Box.  She'd chosen Talim, <br />
and it was obvious that Jenny was very very good.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't think you liked video games.&quot; <br />
<br />
Without even looking away from the screen, Jenny answered.  &quot;Jennifer doesn't.  Personally, <br />
I've been dying to play.  I think I'm pretty good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are.  Mind if I join you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, not at all.&quot;  She smiled at him.<br />
<br />
They'd been playing for about an hour when the doorbell rang.  Kyle was glad, his hands <br />
were tired.  Jenny was better than he was, and it was getting harder to beat her.<br />
<br />
Jenny turned off the game and reached for the gun.  &quot;Ok, answer quick before your folks <br />
wake up.  I got your six.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle nodded and went upstairs to answer the door.<br />
<br />
A pretty girl wearing guy's clothing stood there, her eyes wild.  She was a small girl, <br />
perhaps 14 or 15, and definitely under 5' tall.  Normally, he'd find the sight appealing, but <br />
he knew who it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there Brad, how's it going?&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl pulled a knife.  &quot;Change me back or I'll kill you!&quot;  It was obvious she'd been crying.<br />
<br />
And then Jenny was there, pointing her gun at Brad.  &quot;Be quiet, Brad.  We're going <br />
downstairs now.  Give Kyle the knife.  I -will- shoot you, but I'd rather not wake up Kyle's <br />
folks.  Do you understand?&quot;  She cocked the hammer back, a lot more easily than Kyle <br />
would have thought possible for her.<br />
<br />
Brad paled and meekly went along with them, giving Kyle the kitchen knife.<br />
<br />
Downstairs, Jenny motioned for Brad to sit on the couch.  The girl was barefoot, and her <br />
pants were barely staying on, even with the belt cinched as tight as it could go.  She <br />
reached to hold them up.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  Take them off.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Brad looked aghast at Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;You heard me.  You can keep the shirt, but take off your pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blushing furiously, Brad let his pants slide off his slender hips.  His boxers followed suit, <br />
pooling around his (rather shapely) legs, revealing a soft downy patch of sparse pubic hair.<br />
<br />
Jenny whistled.  &quot;Nice legs, Brad.  But what's this?  You barely have anything between your <br />
legs...you're practically a little girl down there.  Now sit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad sat, instinctively pulling his legs up to his chest and hugging them, looking very small <br />
and young in the too-large shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look good, Brad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare!&quot;  The girl blurted out.<br />
<br />
Jenny shook her head.  &quot;Sorry Brad, doesn't work that way.  No tagbacks.  You want to <br />
curse someone, you got to curse Kyle.  Go ahead, but if I don't like what I hear, I'll kill <br />
you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not Kyle's sister...who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny laughed, and it was a cold, mirthless thing.  &quot;About time you figured that out...I <br />
guess being a girl has made you smarter.&quot;  She trained the gun on Brad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm the girl you raped, you son of a bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't rape anyone!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well of course I didn't say no...what, and have THE Brad Preston tell everyone lies about <br />
me?  It would ruin me socially...so of course I let you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;....Jennifer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhm.  Well, I -was- Jennifer.  But call me Jenny now.  I know, you're going to say she liked <br />
it.  Well, what can I say, Jennifer is a dumb slut.  But I didn't want to have sex with you, so I <br />
call it rape.  See how that works?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...but how...you're a kid?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny rolled her eyes.  &quot;Looks can be deceiving.  Come on, jerk, you got tits.  Figure it out.  <br />
Kyle changed me into a girl.  I couldn't change myself back, so you have to give him the <br />
power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...why didn't you ask me for help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I don't like you anymore.  In fact, we're through.&quot;  Jenny threw something at the <br />
other girl, apparently quite hard, because she whimpered.   It fell on the floor, and Kyle <br />
recognized it as Brad's class ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now...go on, curse Kyle.&quot;  She trained the gun on Brad.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll shoot me no matter what I say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Try me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad looked at Kyle.  &quot;Transform or Dare.&quot;</p>
