<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie and Bobby walked down the beach, looking for an appropriate child to test their magic with. It didn&#39;t take them very long to find a candidate. A group of preteen girls were picking on a younger girl. She was only 7 years old with cherry-red hair, heavily freckled skin, and emerald eyes that didn&#39;t quite match the lime green of her two-piece. However, those eyes were now leaking tears as the older girls were laying into them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Connect-the-Dots,&quot; teased one girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ginger Pox,&quot; teased another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, leave her alone!&quot; called Bobby. The older girls looked at him before quickly walking away. <br />
<br />
Katie knelt down besides the crying girl and asked, &quot;Are you ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl sniffed and said, &quot;Those big girls are so mean. It&#39;s not my fault I have so many freckles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it&#39;s not,&quot; said Katie soothingly as she put a hand on the girl&#39;s shoulder. She could feel a slight tingle and knew that the magic was starting. She had 20 seconds before the girl would start to grow and she wanted to make sure she put on the right track. &quot;You&#39;re beautiful in your own way,&quot; said Katie, &quot;If they can&#39;t see that, it&#39;s because they barely know what beauty means.&quot; She smirked a little before saying, &quot;In fact, if I were you, I&#39;d go over to them and tell them how they are to be saying you&#39;re ugly.&quot;<br />
<br />
The redhead could feel a slight tingle, but she didn&#39;t pay it any attention. For some reason, this lady&#39;s words were filling her with confidence. &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right,&quot; she said, &quot;Who do they think they are, making fun of people like that. I&#39;m gonna give them a piece of my mind!&quot; With that, she turned and stomped off in the direction the older girls had watched.<br />
<br />
As she walked, she wasn&#39;t aware that her body was growing. Her limbs started stretching out, making her strides longer, covering more ground than they had before. Her torso lengthened, extending the gap between her upper and lower pieces. The chubbiness started draining from her body, making her lankier than she was before.<br />
<br />
Eventually, she spotted the girls from before and called, &quot;Hey, stop right there!&quot; When the girls turned, they saw a preteen girl not any older than them. The subtle changes in reality prevented them from noticing her change in size, but they recognized her pretty easily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come back for more, Ginger?&quot; asked one of the girls mockingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name isn&#39;t Ginger!&quot; snapped the redhead, &quot;You can&#39;t just call people names like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better get used to it, Freckles,&quot; said another one of the girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who do you think you are?&quot; snapped the redhead, &quot;You&#39;re not any better than anyone else! You think just because you think you look pretty means you can pick on people who don&#39;t seem pretty enough?&quot; As she went through her tirade, the redhead continued to change. By then, she had reached the girls&#39; ages and passed them. Her body kept stretching upwards, limbs getting longer. Her top piece started to bulge as mounds appeared under her nipples. Her bottom piece was also stretching as her hips started to widen. Curiously, the freckles on her skin started to become thicker, swallowing up all the white spaces between them. And yet the rest of her skin was gaining a darker color.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not everyone is going to be as pretty as us,&quot; said one of the girls a bit uncertainly, suddenly unsure why they were arguing with this older girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, really?&quot; snapped the redhead, &quot;That seems like a pretty stupid way to behave. You think acting like you&#39;re the elite is going to get you many friends in life?&quot; Her vocabulary was growing along with her body. Her cherry red hair was extending further down her back. Her curves started increasing much more dramatically. Her mounds quickly inflated into full globes that kept getting bigger while her hips spread widely as her butt started gaining mass. Her two piece struggled to keep up before it started to change. The color deepened, changing from lime green to emerald like her eyes. They changed shape, becoming a bikini set better designed to show off her considerable assets. The freckles on her body had merged together into a darker shape across her body that was lightening as the same time that her unblemished skin was darkening. &quot;You girls are starting down a bad path,&quot; said the redhead, her face becoming more mature and more beautiful, &quot;If you keep being rotten to others, they will hate you, no matter how pretty you are. Popularity isn&#39;t about who is better in looks, but better in attitude. A terrible personality will never compensate for a pretty face. Now don&#39;t let me catch you picking on any more kids or I will find your mothers and tell them about how you are behaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; said the girls sullenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Now go be good girls and play nice,&quot; said the redhead before walking off. Instead of a preteen girl with too many freckles, she walked away as a gorgeous young woman. Her emerald bikini hugged her body closely, showing off the curve of her breasts and ass. Her skin was a gorgeous flawless tan, something that few people would have expected to be possible with her heritage. She tossed her long red hair, feeling the sun and wind against her body. Telling off those little girls felt better than she would have thought it would have. But now she was ready to have some fun in the sun. She could work to make sure her tan wasn&#39;t fading in key spots.<br />
<br />
Katie and Bobby watched with excitement as the magic worked. If they hadn&#39;t been watching, they wouldn&#39;t have believed that fiery-haired tanned hottie was just a little girl with freckles minutes before. Though now they were the only ones who knew she was a little girl. And now that it&#39;s been proved to work, it&#39;s time to change some more kids.</p>
