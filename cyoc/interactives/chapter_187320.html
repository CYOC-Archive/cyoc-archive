<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cindy woke up elated. She didn&#39;t know how or why but she was sure that she gained a wish per day. Although it sounded unreal, she was certain it was true. Tomorrow she was definitely going to have a lot of fun messing with that bitch Sandra, but for now, she was going to have some private time with her boyfriend before her parents got back this afternoon.<br />
She crawled under the covers until she arrived near her sleeping boyfriend&#39;s manhood and started gently kissing it. Cindy always knew she was... different than other girls. Her boobs were the most obvious characteristic but what very few people knew, was that she absolutely loved giving blowjobs. The sensation of having a penis on her tongue was as if someone was also licking her clit. And since she controlled exactly where the pressure and stimulation was applied it felt even better than cunnilingus. And when she actually put it inside, it was like fireworks. Sliding over her tongue towards her throat stimulated both her clit and vagina. Roughly teasing her nipples while she sucked on a dick was pure bliss. It often led to her having orgasms that made her unable to speak for a couple of seconds. She wondered what it would be like if whilst she did all that, someone was also fucking her, or licking her clit too and she was certain it would be absolutely divine. <br />
Nevertheless, it was really embarrassing so she always tried to hide this from everyone. Even her boyfriend. He did know that she loved giving blowjobs, but he thought it was one of her kinks that turned her on. He attributed the orgasms to her sensitive nipples instead. Of course, that&#39;s not to say that the mental part wasn&#39;t there. She already had so many orgasms from sucking dick that just looking at it made her salivate and turned her on. Which was something that she really didn&#39;t want anyone to know.<br />
After sensually kissing the flaccid head of the penis, she slowly pulled back the foreskin and started liking around the crown. This caused her boyfriend to stir and open his eyes.<br />
&quot;Someone is an early riser. Couldn&#39;t wait?&quot;<br />
&quot;We already overslept. My parents will be home soon. Consider this your going away present.&quot; Cindy responded with a smile.<br />
&quot;Well, if we only have time for a quickie gimme a sec. I&#39;m already hard, just need to get a condom.&quot;<br />
&quot;Leave it. Just tease my nipples. I&#39;ll work the downstairs. For the both of us.&quot; Cindy again revealed a devilish little smirk. Although he wasn&#39;t as good as her at toying with her nipples, since the sexual sensitivity was so much higher than the irritation threshold, the skill needed to get her revved up was pretty low. Combine that with a blowjob and her ministrations on her clit, and she was certain it would be amazing.<br />
And was it. A few minutes in she already couldn&#39;t help herself. She was already being pushed over the edge.<br />
&quot;Mmh! Mmgh!!Huh, fuc-!Ghhh! *Pant* *Pant*.&quot; Being driven into ecstacy, she let a few muffled screams on his cock before taking it out to let out a final guttural grunt, before she took a few moments to compose herself. She usually kept quiet during her blowjob orgasms to make it seem they weren&#39;t as strong as the full-on penetrative ones. After all, she wanted him to think that they were just nipple orgasms. But having the four pronged assault on her mouth, both nipples, and clit resulted in an orgasm that was too hard too stifle.<br />
&quot;You know, babe, you&#39;d be a pretty bad lover if you were a guy, being such a quickshot and all.&quot; It was now his turn to reveal a smirk as he made a joke. Even though Cindy stopped blowing him for a few seconds whilst she was riding through her orgasm he didn&#39;t really mind. Her O face was enough to keep him ready when she could to continue.<br />
Cindy put her mouth back on the head of the cock but she stopped teasing her clit, only pretending to do it from then on. She didn&#39;t want him to tease her about not being able to give a bj without cumming her brains out. She knew that it was dumb, and she only thought that because of her stupid pride, but she still didn&#39;t want to be that open with him. What if he made fun of her, like the others made fun of her for her boobs? Or worse yet, what if he told everyone?<br />
She doubled down her efforts to try and bring him to orgasm faster before she came again. After all, even if she took it slower with her mouth, her nipples were still played with. Just as she was feeling she couldn&#39;t take it anymore she felt something on the back of her mouth. The bitter taste of semen gushed from the entrance of her throat all the way into her mouth. Pulling her head away only resulted in the final couple of spurts to land on her lips. <br />
&quot;Babe, what the hell?&quot; Cindy was fuming. They  had this fight a couple of times before. He was always quiet during sex, and more importantly during blowjobs. Although Cindy really liked the sensation of giving head, the taste of semen was still awful for her so she made him agree that he would always warn her when he was close. A promise he sometimes &#39;forgot&#39; since he knew that giving blowjobs was one of Cindy&#39;s kinks. He still didn&#39;t do it often, but it was definitely common enough that it wasn&#39;t accidental forgetfulness.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I thought I could stop myself, but then you did that thing with your tongue and it pushed me passed the point of no return. Really, babe, it won&#39;t happen again.&quot;<br />
Under normal circumstances, Cindy would just be mad for a little bit, and make him get her a small gift or take her out someplace nice before she forgave him. But today was different. She had the power to stop this from happening again. She quickly thought of two ways she could go about doing it. The first was simple. She could wish his semen tasted great. That way, she wouldn&#39;t mind if he came in her mouth or not. But she didn&#39;t want that. He already did it way too many times and she wanted some revenge. So she opted for the second way &#39;I wish Jake couldn&#39;t suppress his voice when he was turned on. The more turned on he was the higher the volume. And when he got close to cumming, he would always announce it just before he went over the edge. The stronger his orgasm, the higher the volume of his voice, and if he tried to somehow suppress it, it would manifest as shaking, weakness in his legs, or involuntary thrusting of his hips&#39;<br />
&quot;Hah, hah. Babe, please, I&#39;m so close, just let me cum already!&quot; <br />
Cindy was momentarily surprised to see that she no longer tasted any cum in her mouth and she couldn&#39;t see any on Jake&#39;s dick either. It seems he still hasn&#39;t cum yet. And despite Jake&#39;s previous ejaculation, she was still relatively close to her own second orgasm.<br />
&quot;In a bit babe. I&#39;m really close too. We can cum together.&quot; Cindy responded in a somewhat arrogant tone as she placed her head back in position for continuing the blowjob. <br />
&quot;Hah! Mmhm! Yeah. I&#39;m- I&#39;m gonna cum!! Babe, I&#39;m gonna-&quot; Just a few moments later, it seems Jake was again about to burst so Cindy quickly lifted her head and stopped him from going over the edge.<br />
&quot;Babe, please! I can&#39;t take it anymore. Please?&quot; Jake&#39;s eyes already seemed like they were watering a tiny bit. The previous Jake would definitely not be this passive. It seems like this edging play wasn&#39;t anything new in their relationship now. Although her orgasms were always great, Cindy always wondered what it&#39;d be like to finally be the one that was in control instead of the one passively submitting, but it was hard to do so because of her height and her breasts&#39; condition. Now, she finally knew what it was like, and that along with the continuous teasing of her nipples Cindy was already about to pass over the edge. But she didn&#39;t go back down on him. Instead, she climbed on top and started grinding her pussy on his shaft.<br />
&quot;Yeah, you like that? Cum for me baby. Cum!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna cum. Babe, I&#39;m gonn- I&#39;M CUMM-ARGH&quot; With Cindy&#39;s encouragement, and the ecstasy that was slowly taking over her face, Jake was finally pushed over the edge and started cumming all over his stomach. <br />
After Cindy was done with her own orgasm she looked down and wondered if she should make him drink his own cum to see what she had to go through. But disregarding whether or not he would even accept, he probably wasn&#39;t even the same Jake who made her drink his cum. I guess she could think about it the next time they were together. For now, They should clean up before her parents get home. Tomorrow is gonna be a big day after all. Both for her, and that bitch Sandra...</p>
