<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two women jumped as Henry’s fist collided against the doorframe, crashing into the wood with a thud. “Jess! Jennifer!” He shouted, successfully gaining the two girls attention. He had hoped that the sudden shock was enough to break through the lust that had quickly overwhelmed his daughters. He stood tall, trying his best to project what authority he could muster, all the while desperately pushing the encroaching thoughts from his mind, lest he succumb to the same urges. He knew it would be all too easy to give in, but these were his daughters, he had to set an example.<br />
<br />
“D-Dad?!” The both yelled in unison, momentarily drawing both their attention. The girls glance at one another briefly, both noticing a look of guilt that adorned one anothers face, before turning their attention back towards Henry.<br />
<br />
<br />
“You need to cool off. Both of you. Now.” He said, the brevity in his words barely masking the strain he was under trying to maintain his composure. He could feel a bead of sweat forming on his brow, but it was worth it. He knew that he’d managed to break the Cabin’s hold over them. At least for now. All he had to do now was make it out of the room himself.<br />
<br />
Both girls let out a weary sigh, looking back at one another with mutual regret. They were so close to caving. In that brief moment when their eyes locked they both knew that if Henry hadn’t come along, things would have ended badly. Jess counted her blessings, feeling her irritant cock beginning to soften, thanking god that her udder shielded it’s presence otherwise both Jenn and Henry would’ve found out. She shuddered at the thought of having Henry find out - though she wondered how long she could keep up her charade.<br />
<br />
Jennifer on the other hand was panicked, scared at how close she’d come, now two days in a row. She could feel her own juices dripping down her leg, her pussy warm and her cock aching. As she led herself from the Barn, she couldn&#39;t help but inhale Henry’s musk on the way past. He smelt strong, authoritative. But most of all she could smell the arousal on him. She had to wonder how difficult this was for him, how close he was to caving like the two of them were. She sympathized with him. Her own legs were still shaking as if they resisted moving, wanting nothing more than to stay put, but the more distance she put between herself and that room, the easier it became. Her resolve strengthened as she tackled the stairs. Her stomach still rumbled in defeat as she lifted one leg at a time, careful to focus on that simple process. One leg at a time. Finally she made it and could see the familiar shower door is still hanging open from her last visit. <br />
<br />
She slipped into the bathroom and began stripping her clothes with the utmost care. She could see the still present bulge in her dress, the damp stain where her tip rested and pre leaked through. She lifted the dirty cloth up and over her twitching shaft, before peeling her damp underwear off of her still human testicles, dropping them on the floor. With a reluctant sigh she stepped into the tub and turned on the cold water - Blasting her senses back into her. Her cock bounced under its own weight before the water&#39;s calming effects took hold. Shrinking it down into a much more manageable form. Jennifer sighed. “How many more times can I scrape by like this?”<br />
<br />
Downstairs Jess watched Jennifer leave with bated breath. Her tongue darted out from her mouth, wetting her dry lips as she did her best to calm her thoughts. Her attention now turning towards Henry, she suddenly realised the pained expression on his face. The last shred of lust was pushed from her body as she became overwhelmed with Guilt. “D-Daddy…” She mumbled, tears beginning to well in her eyes as the gravity of her actions washed over her. Her Henry had put himself on the line to protect her. Even though she almost cheated on him. “I almost…”<br />
<br />
“Shh” Henry said, shaking his head, while the rest of his body remained still. “We had a deal, remember?. Even if things didn’t work out, we still would have been together. Don’t go thinking like that.”<br />
<br />
Jess nodded, lifting her sleeves to her eyes as she mopped up her tears. She took a half step towards Henry to embrace him, but was met with a stern “No!” Jess stopped as quickly as she could, her fat still jiggling with momentum<br />
<br />
“I need you to go and clear your head. Just … Put some distance between us.” He groaned. <br />
<br />
Jess could see why. The thick outline of his erection tented his pants, begging to be freed. She pulled her eyes away from it, wishing she hadn’t seen it at all. She swallowed, nodding in acknowledgement as she inched her way backwards, Taking the Barn’s back door outside. To her surprise, she was greeted by a shrinking metallic trough, attached to the back of the barn. Inside it was filled to the brim with cool glistening water, waiting for her to dunk her head.<br />
<br />
“Was this… Always here?” She wondered, for a brief moment, before the tingling in her loins returned. “Ngh, no time to question!” She moaned.<br />
<br />
She gripped the side of the metal trough and quickly thrashed her head forwards, plunging her nostrils into the water as it shot up her nose, the burning sensation quickly putting an end to any arousal. Her penis subsided, her sex cooled and everything seemed right once more.<br />
<br />
With the girls gone Henry finally released his grip on the doorframe. He gasped for breath, taking in large gulps before he himself made for the kitchen. Frantically he dashed for the sink, turning the tap as cold water spilled from the faucet. He splashed at his face, before giving that up entirely and dunking his head directly into the water. He held himself steady, his rear end sticking outwards into the kitchen, waving around ignorantly as slowly his erection subsided; and so too did the pink slit that had come to adorn his taint.</p>
