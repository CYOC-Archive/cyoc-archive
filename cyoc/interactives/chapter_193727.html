<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave looked over his shoulder at Chet, then nodded, bracing himself against the shower wall. Chet grinned as he let his hand explore, first caressing then slipping between Dave&#39;s ass cheeks, the other stayed diligently on Dave&#39;s cock, stroking long and slow. Dave gasped softly as he felt a finger slide inside of him, then another. It was an unfamiliar sensation to him, but it did feel strangely good. &quot;Get ready.&quot; Chet warned before he placed the tip of his cock between Dave&#39;s cheeks, then slowly guided it in.<br />
<br />
Dave let out a low moan, wincing slightly as Chet&#39;s thick tool pushed him apart. It hurt, but at the same time, it struck something inside of him that made his knees want to give out. No wonder Todd was so eager to jump him. Chet pulled out slowly, leaving a hollow feeling inside of Dave that made him thrust his hips back. &quot;Oh yeah, you do like that, see?&quot; Then Chet thrust in again, soliciting another deep moan from Dave.<br />
<br />
Chet took is slow at first, then slowly picked up his pace, the warm water sliding over their bodies as Dave bottomed for the first time. He came first, his cock twitching in Chet&#39;s hand, shooting thick globs of seed to the shower wall and floor. Then Chet hilted himself, growling deep in his throat as he came inside of his friend. He held them together until he softened and slipped free.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, why have we never tired dating?&quot; Chet asked with a grin as Dave turned around to look at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you&#39;re a horn dog and have never been able to settle down with one person for more than two months.&quot; Dave shot back, light-heartedly joking, but also knowing it for fact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I just need the right person to tie me down.&quot; Chet ran a hand over Dave&#39;s chest and for the first time Dave noticed he could look his friend right in the eye. Up until a bit ago he had always been shorter, though slowly catching up.<br />
<br />
&quot;And would you bottom for me if I asked?&quot; Dave asked, and Chet sighed, shaking his head slightly. &quot;See, I might try it once in a while, but I still prefer being on top. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll find you someone.&quot; He did lean in to kiss Chet though, which was returned eagerly. &quot;I should get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re falling for that guy, aren&#39;t you? What&#39;s his name? Todd?&quot; Dave hadn&#39;t realized he had told Chet about Todd, but with even reality shifting around him, why wouldn&#39;t he have told his best friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure. Maybe.&quot; Dave thought about the slender man and felt his cock give a little twitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;See if he&#39;s into threesomes.&quot; Chet said as he left the showers, giving Dave a wink. They both dried off in relative silence and got dressed. Dave did stop by Frank&#39;s office to say goodbye and promise once more to see him the next day about the job and headed out. As he walked back to the apartment he lost himself in thought. Chet was fun to fool around with, but definitely not relationship material, for him anyway. Todd though. He always found his thoughts drifting back to him, but something made him uneasy. He couldn&#39;t help but think that Todd was somehow at the root of everything that had been happening to him this weekend.<br />
<br />
If he was, was Dave angry or grateful for the changes? He stopped and looked at his reflection in the window of a building he was passing. A young man in his mid twenties look back. A gym rat if not a body builder, shaggy black hair and a rough beard didn&#39;t do much to hide his youthfulness. He was beginning to feel like this was who he should be, not that dumpy office worker in his forties. He continued on his way, eventually coming to the apartment building and taking the stairs up. He stepped inside and smiled as soon as he laid eyes on Todd who was in the kitchen cleaning some dishes from last night. It felt right to be coming home to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;How was the gym?&quot; Todd asked from the kitchen as Dave went to go flop on the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, Chet may have gotten me a job there.&quot; He turned enough to watch Todd in the kitchen as the other man dried off his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great! Desk jobs were never you, anyway, and you can get your workouts done while I&#39;m at work.&quot; Todd stepped into the living room, dropping down onto the couch next to Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Todd. Did you do this?&quot; Dave asked, trying to sound serious as he looked at the other man.<br />
<br />
&quot;This?&quot; Todd asked, trying to sound innocent though it didn&#39;t work. Dave just stared a bit more and the other man sighed. &quot;Kinda. Yes and no.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave suddenly didn&#39;t know if he should be angry, happy, kiss Todd, or punch him. &quot;That makes no sense? And how did you even..? Why me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd sighed and reached for his phone, tapping on it. &quot;It&#39;s this weird program that just kind of appeared on my phone one day, I don&#39;t know how to explain it. It lets me open someone up to changing their life. I&#39;ve used it on a few people, including myself.&quot; Dave must have looked skeptical because Todd went on. &quot;It lasts two days and only works once on anyone. It..&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You picked me to be your... what even are we? Boyfriends?&quot; Dave leaned forward, putting his hands over his face for a moment then turned to look at Todd once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not dating. I mean.. I like you and I wouldn&#39;t say no, or you might still change that. Like I said, two days, you have a few hours of being able to shift things around.&quot; He looked at his phone, then showed the screen to him. &quot;I just tell it to start working on someone. The changes were all you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? I wouldn&#39;t have picked any of this. Other than maybe being younger and fit. I mean, it made me gay, and a whole lot younger than I would have picked, and a job at a gym? I wouldn&#39;t have wanted that until.. this morning.&quot; Dave sat up a little, eyeing the screen. There were thoughts listed out, thoughts he could remember having even at the very back of his brain. One of the first wishing to be more like Todd. Then one wishing to have a better relationship with him. Wishing to have a real romantic relationship with someone. Even wondering what it would be like to have Chet&#39;s muscles and confidence. More recently deciding maybe he could bottom once in a while. &quot;I did do this, didn&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It uses your subconscious thoughts. I guess people don&#39;t always know what they want so it tries to dig deep. I didn&#39;t expect to get caught up in your changes either, believe me. I don&#39;t regret it though. Definitely haven&#39;t had much luck dating recently.&quot; Todd set his phone down then reached out to grip Dave&#39;s shoulder with a grin, trying to cheer him up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you used it on yourself?&quot; Dave found himself asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;First person I tried it on.&quot; Todd said with a nod. &quot;Believe it or not I&#39;m older than you.&quot; He broke into a grin. &quot;Bitter old man who knew he was gay but never came out of the closet. Wanted to be some successful young stud confident in who he was and what he was.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;Seemed to work right. And then when I found someone who seemed unhappy with their life, I&#39;d.. let the program work on them. You seemed so sad but seemed like a nice guy. I just wanted to see if I could help you find a little happiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I actually kind of hated you.&quot; Dave said, looking  little abashed. &quot;More jealousy than hate, but yeah. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; Todd shrugged. &quot;You still seemed like a nice guy, anyway. Just down on your luck and not happy with some young hot shot around. Made me want to help you more. Still hate me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Dave answered honestly, reaching out to pull Todd in closer. &quot;I can&#39;t stop thinking about you. And knowing I picked this, well, makes it a bit easier to go with.&quot; Their lips met hungrily, tongues exploring each other&#39;s mouths as Todd pushed Dave back onto the couch. Clothes were discarded in a flurry.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, you&#39;re even more buff.&quot; Todd said as he ran his fingers through Dave&#39;s curly black chest hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was around Chet again. Like?&quot; Todd nodded excitedly and let his mouth start exploring Dave&#39;s body. Dave could only grin as he felt those lips wrap around his cock. That had grown as well in the last few hours he knew, his foreskin having returned after seeing Chet&#39;s and Todd&#39;s.  &quot;What&#39;s your thought on threesomes?&quot; He asked idly. Todd pulled off Dave&#39;s cock and looked him right in the eyes. &quot;If it&#39;s one of your new muscly gym friends. Just say the word.&quot;</p>
