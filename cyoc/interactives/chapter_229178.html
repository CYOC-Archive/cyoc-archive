<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Laura looked into the remote as she slowly teased herself. She looked over at the description of the option once again to make sure she understood how it worked properly: &quot;The Enhance option upgrades and iterates on the attributes of the target, from efficiency for inanimate objects to physical attributes and more extreme personalities for entities: what is short becomes shorter, what is toned becomes muscular, what is one becomes two and much more. The factor by which a target is enhanced can be modified as well&quot;. It seems Laura had missed that last detail and upon checking the factor, it was at a x1.5 enhancement. &quot;Then it was simply not enough&quot;, she thought, before pausing after the description settled in her mind: it talked as though it was capable of actually changing her body... there was simply no way, right? Laura was perfectly happy with her beautiful body, but... it did mention that it could make it better. Sexier. Whether it was real or not didn&#39;t matter to her, the sheer idea of making herself better was working her up. In the sexual haze that was starting to cover her mind, she scanned herself into the remote to make sure it was actually in there (perhaps that was all that was missing), upped the factor from x1.5 to x3, closed her eyes and Enhanced<br />
<br />
After reopening them, Laura slithered towards the giant, ornate mirror she possessed and assessed what had changed. At a first glance, the lamia queen was still at her resting height of 12 feet tall, and with such a large body, perhaps she needed to look more closely. She extended her almost foot and a half long serpentine neck to look at every single detail of her immense self. Gold scales in a halo still adorned the top of her hood, crowning her as the naturally born queen she was. Her violet eyes were still in a permanent come-hither gaze, sublimed by her eye of Ra makeup. She licked each and every single fang and her large lips, &quot;Still the same so far&quot; she remarked, her husky voice still oozing with lust without even trying. Continuing downwards, her enormous breasts were still held up by a delicate silk lingerie bra. Even if she were a regular human, her ZZZ cups would crush the world record, but proportionate to her size, they almost allowed an average person to sit on the bouncy, yet firm orbs. Continuing past her toned abs were her 3 feet wide broodmother hips with an ass that could equally serve as transportation as her bosom. Her large cloaca was still excited and thus visible, but Laura knew it would close tight enough to be invisible if she calmed herself down - thankfully, she didn&#39;t need to wear panties, her bras were already expensive enough to get. Finally, there was her 48 feet long tail, sinuous and adorned with patterns made out of gold scales that almost looked like sensual tattoos on her otherwise black tail. It was tipped with a large, ridged, golden rattlesnake-like tip.<br />
<br />
Her usual, royal self in sum. Perhaps she wasn&#39;t using it correctly? No, she couldn&#39;t have made a mistake, it was the remote that wasn&#39;t working properly. &quot;Queen Laura Orochi doesn&#39;t make mistakes”, she reminded herself. There was a number of factors for why Laura became queen: she came from a rich family descended from royalty themselves, she was blessed with her royal, serpentine form, she had the power to take the country by force but that had never been necessary because everyone was simply enthralled by her beauty. Thus with her fortune, power and appeal, she became queen and resided in a luxurious castle befitting of herself, with hallways large enough for her body - though she would ask her servants to extend them, she had yet another growth spurt. s for why she became queen? Simple: worship excited her. She was already loved by many, she simply knew that it was for the best of everyone. And she cared about her people - despite how narcissistic and vain she was, she wasn&#39;t unnecessarily cruel -, which loved her in return. Her great libido and the amount of “thanking” she was ready to give after someone gave her tribute also helped.<br />
<br />
This trip down memory lane combined with the sheer amount of sun rays she absorbed, her earlier teasing and her body examination left Laura quite in heat. Slowly, the remote left her mind as her own image and self-love took its place. She groped her large, heaving breasts and expertly controlled her tail towards her cloaca and proceeded to penetrate herself with her long, hard, ridged tip. &quot;Hmmm~ I&#39;m simply too sexy, even for myself~&quot; she seductively moaned. Laura played with herself faster, harder: she was the raw embodiment of sex appeal and lust, she was made to be queen. &quot;Fuuuck yessss~&quot; she moaned again, her large tongue let out as she trusted the almost human-sized tip, panting. She was beauty incarnate who deserved to be painted and exposed throughout her castle by the best of artists like the goddamn work of art she was! The snake queen let out a roar of pleasure that could be heard throughout the castle - a sound her servants were used to - as she came a first time, &quot;Fuuuck yeaaassss~! I&#39;m a fucking goddess!~&quot;<br />
<br />
Laying besides her massive body, the remote laid there as Laura pleasured herself</p>
