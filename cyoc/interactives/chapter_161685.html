<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie and Katie shrugged, testing Liliths potion was going to be problematic. &quot;Any idea who would be willing to try this,&quot; Katie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good question,&quot; Kiko shrugged. &quot;I mean the idea of regaining your youth and being able to give birth to a child. Kind of a win win.&quot; Kellie and Katie glanced at Kiko, watching the six tailed kitsunes eyes go wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa dont look at me,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Like it or not I&#39;m in charge while the folks are out of commission. How the hell am I going to run things when I&#39;m in diapers?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention the possibility that it could wipe her mind,&quot; Kellie said solemnly. &quot;Its not so much the physical regression but the mental part that&#39;s the problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it affects the mind,&quot; Kiko said quietly. &quot;Ugh this is frustrating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about a kitsune that&#39;s already a child,&quot; Katie asked. &quot;The other Ckaudia and Mika are caring for Kari. The potion wouldnt even make her physically younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but then you have to inspect her to see if shes able to have children,&quot; Kellie grumbled. &quot;Something tells me Claudia and Mika wouldnt exactly be thrilled with us experimenting on their child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of Mika I&#39;m just saying this now shes off limits,&quot; Kiko stated. &quot;Have a feeling if we cant think of anyone she would volunteer.&quot; As the trio now racked their brains a thought came to Kellies head. &quot;I think I have an idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finding Mika outside, Kellie, Katie and Kiko now journeyed towards the hospital. As they went Kellie explained her idea. While it technically made sense, the group was still worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why her,&quot; Kiko asked as they gazed into Aiya&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just here me out,&quot; Kellie said. &quot;Aiya has been depressed because she feels like she doesnt matter. What better way to make her feel like she matters than being the first to be able to give birth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not disagreeing with you Kellie,&quot; Mika said quietly. &quot;But if this doesn&#39;t work, if Aiya has the mind of a child we will have lost her for good. I dont want to lose her like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiko placed her hand on sisters shoulder, a grim look on the fuesha furred kitsunes face. &quot;I dont like the possibility of losing Aiya either,&quot; she sighed. &quot;But, this is too good an opportunity to help the clan. Aiya has always felt like she let the clan down. We should ask her and tell her the risks. I leave the decision to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the four of them now entered Aiya&#39;s room the pale, thin kitsune looked upnat them with tired eyes. &quot;Have you come to end my suffering,&quot; Aiya sighed. &quot;Have you finally come to end my life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Aiya of course not,&quot; Mika exclaimed, throwing herself into a tight hug on the three tailed kitsune. &quot;Aiya weve always loved you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiya remained quiet, her face devoid of emotion as she gazed at the quartet. &quot;Aiya,&quot; Kiko said solemnly. &quot;I need to talk with you seriously. It concerns the future of the clan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No matter what the future holds I know I wont be a part of it,&quot; Aiya said sadly.<br />
<br />
Kiko could only groan, rubbing her eyes. &quot;This will never work,&quot; she whispered to Kellie. &quot;Shes not in her right mind. I can&#39;t on good conscience use the potion on her. She might just take it if she thinks it could kill her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me try something,&quot; Kellie said. Kiko nodded as Kellie now approached Aiya and Mika. &quot;Aiya,&quot; Kellie said quietly. &quot;Look I&#39;m not going to dismiss the pain you&#39;ve been in. I want you to know, I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve always felt as if you dont belong. I&#39;ve felt that too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would you know,&quot; Aiya scoffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Aiya for most of my life I didnt belong either,&quot; Kellie stated. Aiya gave her a curious look as Kellie sighed heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aiya,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I dont know how much you know of me so I&#39;ll tell you my story. I&#39;ve lived alot longer than you might think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean,&quot; Aiya asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve lived two lifetimes,&quot; Keliie said. &quot;The Ring of Age has given me that. It&#39;s been a blessing and a curse. In my first lifetime I was a closeted woman, ashamed to admit that I was a lesbian. I came into possession of the ring, used it selfishly, and it ended my first life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiya watched the teenage Kellie intently as she began to pace. &quot;I was so miserable with my first that I ended it. I was given a second chance, a chance to be better. It meant though traveling from timeline to timeline. I was lonely, alone, had no friends. I could remember everything from my first lifetime and realized how much I wanted it back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie stepped forward staring directly into Aiya&#39;s tired eyes. &quot;I&#39;ve spent my second lifetime trying to makeup for the mistakes of my first,&quot; Kellie shook her head, chuckling softly to herself. &quot;AND damn do I keep making mistakes. But the one thing I&#39;ve learned is that our mistakes dont define us. The world is better as long as we try to make good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie grasped the potion in Kiko&#39;s possession, holding it before Aiya. &quot;Aiya listen,&quot; she said. &quot;The potion I have will give your clan the opportunity to have children of their own. The problem is that it could erase you. You think no one understands the pain of life? I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you asking of me,&quot; Aiya asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to see if the potion will work,&quot; Kellie said. &quot;This potion will reduce you to infancy. It will give you a second chance at life, a life in which you can be the one that saves the clan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you said that you miss your first lifetime,&quot; Aiya exclaimed. Kellie nodded, a smile spreading across her face. &quot;Yes I do but I also know that I wouldnt trade this second lifetime for anything. I have made mistakes yes and it&#39;s not perfect but I&#39;ve done more good than I could have imagined, and now I offer you that gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiya gazed at the potion, outstretching her hand she grasped it. Taking a deep breath Aiya took a small sip before handing it back. &quot;So what happens now...owwwwww!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiko, Kellie, Katie, and Mika gaped at the three tails kitsune as she shuddered grasping her thin body tightly. Aiya appeared to glow as her body began to change. Aiya&#39;s already thin body, slimmed down even more. The kitsunes pale fur seemed to brighten slightly as her face rounded. Finally the group could see the third tail shrink away, leaving Aiya a skinny teenage two tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; Aiya breathed, her voice sounding lighter. Looking herself over she seemed stunned at the youthful and trim body she now possessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aiya are you okay,&quot; Mika asked. &quot;Can you still remember everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Aiya stammered. &quot;I remember making the deal with the reaper. I remember being placed in the hospital. I&#39;m still MEEEEEE AHHHH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiya shivered once more, the two tail kitsune growing thinner. The group watched as Aiyas body continued to youthen, her second tail shrinking away. The group watched as Aiya&#39;s breasts now began to shrink, dropping down in cup size until a nearly flat one tail kitsune sat in the bed. Aiya now tried adjusting her overly large hospital gown.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so weird,&quot; Aiya said in wonder, her voice cracking as she inched closer to prepubescent. <br />
<br />
&quot;How does it feel,&quot; Kiko asked nervously. &quot;Are you still you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can still remember everything,&quot; Aiya stated, still shocked by her transformation. Looking at the others she could see the worry on their faces. &quot;And in case you wondering this doesn&#39;t hurt. It almost feels like going down a slide. I&#39;m excited and a bit flsutered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiya gasped as she began to glow once more. The pale kitsunes eyes went wide as she watched her hands now begin to grow smaller. Glancing down the front of her hospital gown her jaw dropped as her barely their breats melted back into her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gosh I&#39;m a child,&quot; she whispered in a youthful tone. Giggling she looked up at the others. &quot;This is so odd. I know I&#39;m an adult, but I look at myself and I just keep getting littler.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aiya chuckled looking at Mika in wonder as she watched the one tail seem to grow in front of her. &quot;You big,&quot; Aiya lisped, becoming a kit of only 6.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I am,&quot; Mika whispered. &quot;Are you still there Aiya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Aiya said as she became a preschooler. &quot;I know I big girl.&quot; Aiya frowned slightly as she spoke. &quot;I just talk wike I wittle.&quot;  Turning her tiny head, the Aiya looked up at Kellie. &quot;Tank ewe,&quot; she lisped.<br />
<br />
Kellie watched as Aiya now exited preschool. The tiny kitsune growing smaller, her pale fur brightening as her body began to fatten with baby fat. As Aiya&#39;s hospital gown fell off her tiny body the pale furred kitsune looked herself over before gazing up at Kellie with wide eyes. Finely becoming a kit of one Kellie gazed at the child Kellie could see an adult intelligence in her eyes. As the glow subsided Aiya tried to speak, giggling like an infant at her baby babble. The only thing left now was to grow Aiya back up and see if the potion worked.</p>
