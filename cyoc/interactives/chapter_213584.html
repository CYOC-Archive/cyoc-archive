<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ellen was about to flip on the TV to catch the news before she began to work on her midterm paper, but then a rather bad smell reached her noise. She wrinkled her nose, that yoga work out must have worked up more of a stench then she thought. So she placed the remote down and finished her coffee before heading back down the hallway. Walking pass the second bedroom/office area and the small bathroom across from it before entering the “master” bedroom with it’s attached bathroom and shower. She picked out some new cloths from the closet before heading toward the shower. <br />
<br />
She turned on the water, just as she heard some police sirens go screaming by. <br />
<br />
“I hope everyone is ok.” Said Ellen as she turned on the water and let the warm up filling the room with steam. She stepped in and began to shower, just as the front door unlocked and a pair of mountain lion humanoid creatures slaked into the room. <br />
<br />
Chris now fully transformed held, Helki’s son his now adopted son tight with one arm as he closed the door behind them and locking it. Luckily the door had a keycode unlock so it was easy enough to open.<br />
<br />
“She is in the shower.” Whispered Chris<br />
<br />
“This will be fun.” Agreed Helki “I’ll transform her if you do it she will become something random.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll stay out here and let you two get to know each other.” offered Chris as Helki smiled and gave him a quick kiss on the lips before rubbing her head against the side of his head purring a bit before she turned and headed down the hallway. <br />
<br />
The hallway was designed for a normal height person but in her new form, Helki’s head brushed against the ceiling and Chris would have to duck. Still Helki without a sound, her padded feat making no noise whatsoever on the carpet as she opened the master bedroom door. <br />
<br />
She could hear some soft singing coming from the door to her right as she prepared, this was the most important hunt she had ever been on and she was a master hunter.<br />
<br />
The door was locked with a dead bolt, something there so that if anyone did break in a person could hide in there while the cops came. A person would have a problem with that, not Helki as she extended a claw and slipped it between the door and the frame. She felt the bolt and with a tug the metal broke under the strength of a simple pull. <br />
<br />
In the shower, Ellen had been in the middle of singing something to herself when she thought she heard something. She paused for a moment listening but after a couple of seconds she went back to singing as the hot water and steam hit her body.<br />
<br />
Ellen never heard the door open or heard the footsteps on the floor but she did feel it when the shower current was ripped down a half second before she was forced against the wall. One hand went to grab both her hands trapping them behind her while the other was placed against one of her hips hard enough to actually pin one of her legs. She was about to scream but stopped as she came face to face with something that shouldn’t be possible.<br />
<br />
A humaniod cat women, covered in tan fur with a short muzzle which was now only an inch or two away from her face. Their breasts where pressed together, while one of her hands held both of Ellen&#39;s behind her back while the creature&#39;s other hand pinned a leg while her other leg was pinned by the creatures own leg. The shower was still going quickly soaking the creature&#39;s fur.<br />
<br />
“Don’t scream.” She ordered as Ellen gulped and nodded her head as her eyes moved around trying to figure out what this thing was. It looked like one of those furries that she had seen in those “fake” videos on the furry virus. Clearly those where not fake, it had White fur ran between this creatures massive breasts but given her size which had to be larger then a human it would been normal size if a human women could be that size. Honey brown hair fell around her face but it looked as if it had never been stylized. <br />
<br />
While Ellen was studying Helki, Helki was studying her. Large breasts which would only get larger when transformed, great shape something to pass down to cubs and she was beautiful for a human in general.  She was strong, yet seamed graceful and Chris had said she was smart, all great things to have in the new world to help them live. What helped a lot was that she was turned on by this human as much as Chris turned her on when he was a human. She would only be more beautiful to her once she became like them. <br />
<br />
“Chris sure knows how to pick them.” stated the creature as she quickly moved her hand which had been holding her hands behind her back out before using her larger size to pin them to the wall with Ellen’s own body. <br />
<br />
Helki bit down on Ellen’s neck, infecting her with the virus. Ellen’s scream was killed as the now freed hand shot up and covered the <br />
mouth. Helki’s hand went into Ellen’s mouth to quiet the scream so tightly that Ellen tried to bite down to get rid of it. However Helki’s skin was now able to take shots from anything but high powered rifles without breaking Ellen’s human teeth stood no chance. <br />
<br />
Helki bit down long but not too hard, she wanted the infection to get a good start. When she pulled back Ellen’s blood was still on her lips even as both of them stood in the shower together. The wound quickly healed and Helki could already spot some fur starting to grow.<br />
<br />
“Hello, Ellen I am Helki.” Said Helki as if they where best friends and as if Helki wasn’t still suppressing Ellen’s screams or pinning her to the wall. <br />
<br />
“You loved Chris as a human, I loved Chris as an animal.” Started Helki “Now all three of us are both, he is in the first room right now.”<br />
Ellen’s eyes widened. <br />
<br />
“I claimed him as my mate but he wants you.” Said Helki “So I think we should share him, we would be safer together and raise our clubs together.  We could enjoy him both alone and together…as well…”<br />
<br />
Helki ran a hand down the outside of Ellen’s bar leg even as she pressed closer. Already the transformation process was underway. <br />
<br />
“As well…as enjoy each other. So Ellen…what do you say?” inquired Helki as she pulled her hand out of Ellen’s mouth even as new fangs began to grow in place as her human teeth. “Shall we become one pride together, hunting, sleep and mating together or shall we fight each other? So Ellen what do you choose?&quot;</p>
