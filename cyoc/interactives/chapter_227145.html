<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“HELLO,” Jeff then suddenly hears someone call, “JEFF? YOU THERE? ANYONE?”<br />
<br />
Jeff immediately recognizes the voice to be that of his best friend Ben, this causes Jeff to wag his tail and let out a bark.<br />
<br />
“Hu,” he hears Ben say and soon hears footsteps walking up the stairs, then his door opens and he sees Ben standing there.<br />
<br />
Ben is a 15-year-old athletic boy, with short brown hair, a natural olive skin tone for being half Mexican on his mother’s side, and brown eyes, which are wide in surprise as Ben spots the large dog in Jeff’s room.<br />
<br />
At first Ben hesitates, but he soon relaxes when he notices that the dog is happily wagging and panting. “Jeff didn’t tell me that he got a dog,” the teen says, stepping into the room, he then kneels down, smiling at the “dog” and holding out his hand, “hey there,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff walks over to his friend and sniffs his hand, immediately his mind is bombarded with informations of his friend: that Ben is a kind hearted person, but that he is also dominant and strict, Jeff feels his instincts tell him to obey Ben, that Ben is the one in charge, but Jeff manages to push those thoughts back, ‘can’t let my dog-side take control,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I’m unsure what might happen and I don’t want to lose myself’.<br />
<br />
Ben smiles and starts to stroke, pat and scritch the dog, “so, Jeff named you after him,” he chuckles when he sees the tag. The teen shakes his head, “typical for Jeff,” he mumbles, “so, Jeff, do you know where your owner is?”<br />
<br />
Jeff wags his tail, enjoying the attention, he then lets out a bark.<br />
<br />
Ben chuckles, “I guess he went out to get something and left you here, hm,” Jeff barks once again, “thought so,” Ben then says, assuming that is what the “dog” meant, instead Jeff actually meant “I’m here, idiot,” but of course Ben is unable to understand him.<br />
<br />
Ben gets to his feet, “knowing Jeff, it’ll take a while for him to return,” he says, he then notices the registration form open on Jeff’s computer, “looks like he registered you, so that means you are chipped and got your vaccinations. At least Jeff got around to do that, but he forgot to send it off”. With long strides, Ben walks over to the Laptop and confirms the filled out form, “there, that should do it,” he says.<br />
<br />
The teen is about to power Jeff’s Laptop down, hating it when people leave electronics running for no reason, but he then notices a weird looking icon and clicks on it.<br />
<br />
Jeff has followed Ben to the desk and is now lying by his friend’s feet, unaware that Ben just spotted the icon of the program.<br />
<br />
Being curious by nature, Ben clicks on the icon, when the window reopens, the screen has returned to the welcoming screen, ‘welcome to the Chronivac,’ Ben thinks to himself, “this looks like some weird game. Jeff always gets the weirdest things,” he then says with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
Ben decides to read the manual, being a gamer himself he’d like to see if this game would be something for him. When he reads through the manual, his eyes widen, ‘so, it’s some kind of reality editor? Apperantly able to transform anyone and anything into various things,’ he asks himself, ‘cool, but does it really work? I guess there is only one way to find out’.<br />
<br />
The teen activates the scanner and soon Ben is scanned, when he opens the “saved files” screen he sees a file with Jeff’s name, but he does not open it, not wanting to mess up Jeff’s “game”. If he would have opened it, Ben would have realized that the dog at his feet is his friend Jeff, but since he doesn’t, Ben remains unaware of Jeff’s transformation.<br />
<br />
Ben opens his file and his eyes widen, ‘holy crap, this thing knows EVERYTHING about me,’ he thinks to himself, blushing, ‘even stuff I’d rather NOT have displayed’.<br />
<br />
After a while, Ben decides to do a subtle test by changing his skin color from olive to pale, the teen’s eyes widen when after confirming the setting he witnesses his skin color change, ‘unbelievable,’ he thinks to himself, ‘it actually works!’<br />
<br />
Ben checks his watch, “damn, I have to head back home,” he says, ‘but NOT without this game,’ he thinks to himself. The teen hooks his phone to Jeff’s Laptop and copies the program over, after copying the program, he opens the App and deletes Jeff’s file, not needing it. The deleting of Jeff’s file from the App does not affect Jeff’s original file, which is still saved in the original program on Jeff’s Laptop.<br />
<br />
The teen puts his phone back in his pocket and gets to his feet, this causes Jeff to wake up, the “dog” stretches and yawns.<br />
<br />
Ben chuckles, “sorry, buddy,” he says, “didn’t mean to wake you. I have to go, I was hoping Jeff would have been around. I wanted to tell him that I got myself a dog, didn’t know that he too got himself a dog”.<br />
<br />
Jeff tilts his head, ‘Ben got himself a dog,’ he asks himself, ‘I thought he wanted to wait’.<br />
<br />
Ben chuckles as the “dog” tilts its head, “you sure are a cute boy,” he says, “I think you and Rex would get along pretty well,” he adds. Ben’s dog Rex is a male German Shepherd with the traditional colouring. Looking down at the “dog” a thought pops into Ben’s head, ‘Jeff got himself a fine and beautiful dog,’ he thinks to himself, ‘it’s just a pity that it’s a male. If “Jeff” were a female, she and Rex would produce fine pups, I could make lots of money! Hm… maybe Jeff wouldn’t find changing “Jeff’s” gender for a while. If he does, then I’ll just do it without him knowing, I better scan “Jeff” now, just to be on the safe side’.<br />
<br />
Jeff watches Ben take out his phone, the teen smiling down at Jeff, “you don’t mind if I’d take a picture of you, eh buddy?”<br />
<br />
The “dog” barks and wags, unaware of what Ben is really planning to do.<br />
<br />
Ben chuckles, he then points in front of him, “here, boy,” he says, “sit,” he then adds once Jeff has moved in front of him. The teen then aims his phone at the “dog” and activates the scanner, with a ping sound the “dog” is scanned and Ben pockets his phone. Ben leans down and scratches Jeff behind the ear, “thanks for that, buddy,” he says, “I’ll see you around. Hopefully soon, I’ll send Jeff a text and ask him if he’d like to meet up so you can play with Rex,” with that Ben leaves.</p>
