<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian made the final decision easily.  For all practical purposes he already was a horse, and the temptation of the equine form and thought was probably even stronger to him than it was for Mike.  He drove forward with a screaming whinny and stomped his hind hooves as he emptied his straining ballsack into the mare.  The orgasm was so intense that he was aware of nothing but the pulse of seed.  Then he nearly collapsed over the mare&#39;s back, sliding back until he pulled free, and his still-erect shaft bobbed stiffly under his belly. <br />
<br />
Brian shuffled forward to nuzzle the mare and drink in her scent, capturing an identity and a sense of &#39;mine&#39;.  The mare rubbed against him, both of them still heaving from the prolonged sex.  He felt totally exhausted, spent, drained, and... incredible.  He had fulfilled a great purpose, completed a primary goal of life.  A small part of him recognized that he had simply mounted a mare, but that did not diminish the pride and absolute sense of accomplishment that filled him.  <br />
<br />
The stall door creaked open and Llandros came in.  He chuckled as he approached and patted Brian&#39;s equine rump.  &quot;I expect you are feeling pretty pleased with yourself right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian flicked his ears back and turned his head so he could see the young human with one eye - he did not trust this one.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, get over it.&quot;  The Wizard walked confidently up to Brian&#39;s head and rubbed under his  heavy jaw.  It felt very nice.  &quot;You made the choice.  Granted, I had the advantage of knowing just how hard it is to resist once you get a good start.  Geldings are another matter, but a mare or stallion?  Never had a single person or centaur turn back once they started down the equine road.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was interesting to know, and explained Mike&#39;s fascination.    Brian&#39;s ears went back up and he automatically rubbed his muzzle against the Wizard&#39;s chest to signal more grooming.  The young man laughed and used his knuckles to massage Brian&#39;s thick neck.  &quot;Getting right to it, huh?  Aren&#39;t you even a little surprised?  I mean, about still being you?&quot;<br />
<br />
It took almost a full minute for Brian&#39;s brain to process what Llandros was saying, but when he finally understood he jerked his head in surprised.  He wasn&#39;t a horse!  Well, not completely.  He remembered his past, being an elf, Tye and his friends, and his life before he came to this world.  Granted, some of it was fuzzy and hard to connect with.  Walking on two legs?  Getting meaning from odd marks and sounds?  At the same time, he WAS the Percheron, totally at ease and content.  There was no sense of having been changed into a new creature.  Being a horse was..  well... right.  More than right.  Hard as he tried, he could not comprehend ever wanting to be anything but a horse.<br />
<br />
Llandros patted his neck affectionately.  &quot;Yeah, you are a horse, but a horse with benefits.  You understand what I am saying, or should.&quot;  he paused and said &quot;Stomp your right forehoof three times if you understand me.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Brian obeyed automatically, yet was not even annoyed realizing he was following orders as a trained animal.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent!  OK, that is one of the benefits.  Another is that you are very smart for a horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian felt a little annoyance at that - very smart for a horse?  He was pretty smart for a human!  Or had been.  He remembered being good at something called chemistry, and making music using a box with strings.  That was as far as his mind went.  The details were gone, and he sensed much more had been lost when his brain transitioned from human to equine.  Brian felt no sense of loss, however.  The missing knowledge had no bearing on the life of a horse, and therefore had been of no real value anyway.  <br />
<br />
&quot;One big one that will make your future owners happy, even if you don&#39;t really fully appreciate it, is that you will age like a human.  So instead of being dead of old age when you are 20 or so, you&#39;ll be strong and productive until you are at least 50 and maybe even 60!&quot;<br />
<br />
Something about that did sound important.  Years.  They were collections of months, which were collections of days, which were....?  Brian snorted, not sure where he had been going with that thought.  And, like the loss of his schooling and musical talents, the comprehension of time was dismissed as irrelevant and gone forever.  <br />
<br />
Brian dropped his head again and snuffled the Wizard&#39;s robes, hoping to smell a treat.  He felt content with this human, safe from harm.  The human had made him like this, and he was grateful.   Llandros laughed and dug into his robes to pull out some crude lumps of brown sugar.  He fed one to Brian and one to the mare, then gave Brian a pat on the neck and let himself back out of the stall.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll let you two rest and enjoy each other&#39;s company tonight.  You may even have another round or two before morning.  Then we&#39;ll see about getting you ready for market.  I know a particularly wealthy young knight who will pay any price I want to name for a mount like you!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Market?  Price?  There was something unsettling about those words, but Brian could not quite grasp what it was.  As was becoming his custom, he simply forgot about the momentary concern and was content to simply stand by the mare and mutually groom her, thinking about nothing at all.</p>
