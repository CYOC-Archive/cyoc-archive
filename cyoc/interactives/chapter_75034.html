<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the clerk is distracted, the nerd notices some photos on the wall next to the bed he's got Titus <br />
stretched out on.  He stares. He pulls a photo off the wall, and goes over to the dresser mirror.  No wonder <br />
everyone thought he belonged here. He stripped off the Green Lantern outfit, and checked out some of the <br />
clothes in the closet. It was like it was tailor made for the frat boy, he was wearing.  <br />
<br />
Jeremy looked back at Titus lying drooling on the bed, and felt a pang of pity.  He had been dissed by frat <br />
boys in general, and wanted revenge. But this guy hadn't done anything to him.  Neither had the guy whom he <br />
was now wearing.  How was this possible.  It just had to be a costume that used the guy as a mold.  Yeah, <br />
putting on a skintight costume always adds six inches in height and 60 lbs of muscle. He reached for the <br />
zipper hidden on his chest, and pulled it down.  There was a hissing sound like air rushing out. The tight <br />
skinsuit sagged around him.  He was his old normal self. He stepped out he was all sweaty, and worst of all he <br />
was hornier than ever. <br />
<br />
He decided to shower.  He had no compunctions about using the frat boy's soap or towels, hell he'd been inside <br />
the guy for like 2 hours now.  As the water coursed over his body, he couldn't help but think how good it had <br />
felt. He felt so strong, so confident while wearing fratboy.  He turned off the water, and looked at the frat <br />
boy skin lying on the floor.  <br />
<br />
&quot;How'd'ya let this happen to you, uh, Paul?&quot; Jeremy asked holding the skinsuit by its hair and looking down <br />
into Paul's face.<br />
<br />
Paul's perspective was a lot more freaked out.  One minute, the nerd was going to have sex with his frat bro <br />
thanks to roofies, and Paul was strangely okay with that.   The next minute, he's holding a photo of Paul up <br />
to the mirror, and looking at his reflection. Then he took off the Lantern costume, looked again, and then he <br />
unzipped.  To Paul it was the most painful experience ever. The zipper coming down was like him being ripped <br />
bodily apart. He felt his essence waver.  He had never felt so empty.  He was furious, how could his owner <br />
disgard him like this on heap on the floor of his own bedroom.  When he had been unzipped the first time, <br />
there had been no one inside, but this time there was.  That made all the difference in the world. <br />
<br />
They guy was using his shower to wash off Paul's kooties, Paul imagined.  As he lay there on the floor, he <br />
felt something crawling on him.  It was probably a bug, but he couldn't move to see or to make it get off. It <br />
just kept crawling on him like he was an object. Oh, that's right, he was an object - a recently discarded <br />
object. Paul felt more resentment at Jeremy than he had against any of his former girlfriends.  Being <br />
someone's skinsuit was a lot more intimate than just sex. <br />
<br />
Now the guy stepped out of the shower and shoved his wet junk in Paul's face as he looked down.  How had I let <br />
this happen?  Dude, I was just trying on a costume, and the next thing I knew I was on the rack, and then you <br />
put me on! Paul tried to say all this, but of course costumes cannot speak.  Jeremy shrugged, and lifted the <br />
costume close to his face and sniffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you smell ripe too.  Guess, you I should clean you up,&quot; Jeremy said hanging up his towel, and turning <br />
the shower back on. <br />
<br />
It started out like a good thorough cleaning.  Paul was turned inside out and warm water raced over his slick <br />
insides. Then Jeremy turned him right side out, and stepped inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;One last time couldn't hurt, right?&quot; he said to himself.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, he was still in shower, he was still wearing Paul, and he was just jacking off his third <br />
load.  He rinsed off and toweled off, and sat on the toilet.  He took a big piss and dump, and sighed. He felt <br />
so good.  He wondered how much of it was him, and how much was the suit. His index fingers toyed with the <br />
zipper tab dangling from his chest.  He had to make a decision.<br />
<br />
Paul was in heaven.  He was being worn again. He was telling his master never to ever take him off again. He <br />
hoped it would somehow sink through.<br />
<br />
Jeremy stretched Paul's body and yawned. He stood in the room. Should he put on Paul's clothing, and take over <br />
Paul's life?  It had to be better than his own.  Should he take Paul back to the store?  Should he take him <br />
off, and go home to think about it?  If he took Paul off, he'd be naked, and Paul's clothing was way to big <br />
for him.  Maybe the Green Lantern outfit?  It seemed to be pretty stretchy, it might fit.<br />
<br />
Titus moaned and smacked his lips. He pulled his thumb out of his mouth and mumbled that he had been <br />
practicing. Jeremy reached over and grabbed the half empty beer can and drained it.</p>
