<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cole woke up, feeling very aroused.  This wasn&#39;t unusual, but she couldn&#39;t be sure that being in the arms of a very pretty demoness wasn&#39;t somehow responsible.  She really wanted to relieve herself, but she couldn&#39;t exactly do that while in bed with someone!<br />
<br />
Dantalyon...Lee...opened one eye.  “Oh good, you&#39;re awake.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah, sorry, did I wake you?”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t really need to sleep, though resting has it&#39;s own merits.  Oh excellent, I see you&#39;re physically aroused.”  The demon smiled.<br />
<br />
Cole&#39;s eyes got wide and she felt very embarrassed.  “Uh...a little...”<br />
<br />
“Now, I don&#39;t mean to &#39;cure&#39; you of your predilections, but you have a lot to learn, and being unable to engage in sex is a hindrance.  I will take care of it, but you need to pay attention.  There will be a test.”  <br />
<br />
Cole didn&#39;t know what to say, but then Lee got up and moved lower on the bed, gently pushing Cole&#39;s legs apart.  Cole wanted to protest, but really...couldn&#39;t find the will.<br />
<br />
Lee frowned.  “Feh.  Pubic hair.  Can&#39;t stand the stuff.  I know why you have it, but in this day and age, it should be easy to stay clean.”  Gently touching Cole&#39;s soft tuft of hair, it was instantly burned away, leaving behind the lingering scent of burnt hair.  Cole would later find that even her follicles were sealed, and she would never grow hair there again.<br />
<br />
Right now, however, the sudden warmth filled her with an almost agonizing burst of pleasure, and she gasped.<br />
<br />
Lee then leaned in and started...doing things...with her tongue, that Cole couldn&#39;t even describe.  She groaned and lay back.  She then heard Lee&#39;s voice in her mind.  “I understand it&#39;s hard to learn in this situation, so I will give you a teaching aid.”<br />
<br />
She could suddenly see, in her mind&#39;s eye, a detailed picture of what Lee was doing, as if her body had become translucent.  Even more intense, she could feel what Lee felt, including scent and taste- the sensation was almost like she was going down on herself!<br />
<br />
This only made her more aroused, and she whimpered as she quickly came to an orgasm.  Lee cleaned her up with her tongue, then moved to her side to hold her, idly stroking one of Cole&#39;s nipples with her fingertip.<br />
<br />
When Cole finally came down, she managed to speak.  “Guh”, she said, quite intelligently.<br />
<br />
“Good, you&#39;re ready for another lesson.”<br />
<br />
Cole whimpered.<br />
<br />
<br />
She lost count of how many times she&#39;d orgasmed.  Her sheets were soaked with sweat and smelled like sex.  She just lay there, feeling like she&#39;d been turned into so much jello.  But she recalled what Lee had done quite vividly!<br />
<br />
“I...need a shower.”  She managed to stammer out.<br />
<br />
“Ah yes, you don&#39;t know how to clean yourself magically yet.  Allow me, then.”<br />
<br />
Lee started to grow in size...no wait...the whole room was growing!  She was shrinking!<br />
<br />
She let out a frightened squeak, as soon she was small enough that Lee was able to grab her with her hand.  The demoness smiled and started licking Cole with her tongue.<br />
<br />
The sensation was incredible, and Cole had no ability to resist.  Soon she was soaked, although the demon&#39;s saliva was more like hot water.  Then she dwindled even more, and Lee popped her into her mouth!<br />
<br />
It was hot and steamy inside the demoness, and she held Cole captive against the roof of her mouth, making the girl feel like a Jolly Rancher.  It was incredibly intense, and she soon orgasmed again, wondering if you can die from too much pleasure!<br />
<br />
Then she was spit out into Lee&#39;s hand, steam rising from her body.  She felt very clean and refreshed.<br />
<br />
“There, how was that?”<br />
<br />
Cole whimpered and nodded, even as Lee set her down on the bed.  Slowly, she began regaining her size, but she stopped at what she guessed was the 3&#39; mark.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll restore you in a bit, for now, you&#39;re rather cute like that.”  Lee grinned.  “Breakfast?”<br />
<br />
Lee exited the room, still naked, heading for the kitchen.  Cole carefully slid off her bed, landing on her feet.  She felt very nimble at this size, and amused herself by jumping around for a bit.  She could get some impressive distance, and found that bounding around was easier than walking!<br />
<br />
She made her way to the kitchen, and managed to get on the table in two hops, first landing on the seat of a chair.<br />
<br />
Lee was standing by the stove.  She was waving her hands, and causing things to move through the air on their own accord!  Soon a meal was being prepared, and she turned to face Cole.  “Telekinesis.  A useful talent.  I&#39;ll add that to the curriculum.”<br />
<br />
“I...thank you, teacher.”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re quite welcome!  I&#39;ll teach you to shrink and grow things as well, I could hear you giggling from down the hall.  Having fun?”<br />
<br />
“Yes!  I never thought being tiny would be so much fun!”  Cole smiled.<br />
<br />
“My spell allows you to retain more of your strength than you would have proportionately.  Sort of like having the best of both worlds.  Most wouldn&#39;t bother- Angels and Fallen can change their size at will, and if you need to be stronger, you can just get bigger.  But there are times when it can be convenient to be the size of a doll with prodigious strength.”<br />
<br />
Cole just nodded, amazed at what Lee could do.<br />
<br />
A plate of food floated over to her,   Lee shrank a knife and fork for her, as well as tiny glasses of juice and milk.  “Now, I can tell you normally eat like a bird, but that stops now.  Magic takes a lot of energy, so you need to eat a lot to sustain it.  Don&#39;t worry, if you actually do get fat, there are spells for that as well.”<br />
<br />
Cole never felt so hungry in her life, so she attacked the food with uncharacteristic gusto.  And it was really good!  “Oh, like what?”<br />
<br />
“Well, you can transmutate fat into air, or even directly into muscle, if you know what you&#39;re doing.  Or you can alter your metabolism, but that&#39;s risky for magicians.”<br />
<br />
“Man, my cousin is always griping about her weight.  But she refuses to work out because she thinks she might lose her curves and her boobs.  Dumb bitch.”  Cole frowned.<br />
<br />
“Oh, what&#39;s this?  You have an enemy!  You&#39;re positively seething with hatred!  Do tell me more!”  The demoness sat down with her own meal.<br />
<br />
“Huh, so you need to eat?”<br />
<br />
“Not exactly, I have access to more efficient ways to gather energy.  But I -like- the taste of good food and drink.”  She demonstrated by slicing a piece of her waffle and popping it into her mouth.  She closed her eyes and slowly chewed, savoring the flavor, making soft sounds of pleasure.<br />
<br />
Cole had never been turned on by someone eating before, but Lee made it look sexual!<br />
<br />
“I think I&#39;ve outdone myself.  Not bad for a kitchen full of common ingredients!”  Lee seemed happy.  “But go on, tell me about your cousin.”<br />
<br />
“Linda.  My bio Dad&#39;s niece.  She&#39;s an entitled princess.  A year older than me, and she thinks the world revolves around her.  She&#39;s always been taller and prettier than me, and she never lets me forget it.  Just a big bully.  Normally, I wouldn&#39;t give a damn, but my Gramma died a few months back.  We were...close.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, Gramma had her old engagement ring...”  Cole showed off the brown diamond.  “And she promised I could have it when I got older.  She wanted to be buried with her wedding ring, but felt she should pass something on.<br />
<br />
But after the funeral, Linda tried claiming all of Gramma&#39;s jewelry.  I had to fight her to get the ring from her!  She threw a big fit and demanded I give it to her, and some of the relatives backed her up.  I told her I swallowed it...which made people even more pissed off.”<br />
<br />
“You didn&#39;t, did you?”<br />
<br />
“Ah, no, but the place I hid it was still probably disrespectful.”<br />
<br />
Lee raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“I put it down my pants.  If I wasn&#39;t so angry, it would have been kind of embarrassing when it started rubbing against my clit every time I moved.”  Cole blushed.<br />
<br />
Lee laughed.  “Oh my.  You really are a brash thing!  I approve.  I&#39;m sure your Grandmother would laugh, unless she was a prude.”<br />
<br />
“I...I don&#39;t think so.  She never went for lurid details, but she was a free spirit, and I got the impression she was a tomboy when she was younger.”  <br />
<br />
“I would have liked her.  Probably went to Heaven though.  You know, you were awfully laissez-faire about giving up your soul.  Doesn&#39;t dying and going to Hell bother you?”  Lee asked.<br />
<br />
“Eh.  I&#39;ll probably regret it, but I was tired of feeling powerless in this life.  And what kind of fun can you have in Heaven anyways?  You&#39;re not allowed to do anything naughty to get in.”  Cole shrugged.<br />
<br />
Lee laughed.  “You&#39;d be honestly stunned at what goes on in Heaven.  Lots of sex, for one.”<br />
<br />
“Seriously?  In church they always made it sound like it was a sin.”  Cole frowned.<br />
<br />
“One of the problems with the system- mortals can believe in whatever they want, it&#39;s part of Free Will.  But that means they often believe in completely wrong things as well.  Like, say, that nothing can escape a black hole other than radiation.  Angels totally can.”<br />
<br />
“Huh.  So what are the actual rules for going to Heaven?”  Cole asked.<br />
<br />
“Too numerous to list, eat your breakfast.  Let&#39;s just say that it somehow works, mostly.  Probably because of us, really.  We weed out a lot of the bad ones.  Now granted, there are some who would have been just fine if we hadn&#39;t tempted them to give up their souls, but I&#39;d like to think they&#39;re happier anyways.  Some parts of Hell are a lot like Heaven, just with less singing and praising the Creator going on.”<br />
<br />
Cole nodded but kept eating.  It wasn&#39;t hard- at her height, her plate was gigantic..but she still ended up asking for seconds!<br />
<br />
“Being small must really mess with my metabolism, where is all this food even going?”<br />
<br />
“Ah, well, I cheated a little.  The spell keeping you at that size, and letting you function normally is being paid for with your magic, not mine.  So you&#39;re literally feeding the spell, on top of, yes, a heightened metabolism.  A weasel has to eat three times it&#39;s body weight each day, for example.”<br />
<br />
“Oh wow, so I could starve if I&#39;m not careful?  This is weird for me, I&#39;m borderline diabetic, so I usually have to watch what I eat.” Cole explained.<br />
<br />
“Well I assure you, -that- won&#39;t be a problem for you anymore.  So about your cousin...you say she&#39;s overly proud of her female assets?”<br />
<br />
“God she is.  I think her tits are too big, but I overheard her talking about wanting a boob job!”<br />
<br />
The demon smirked.  “I have a spell in mind, then.  I&#39;ll teach you a basic weight loss spell first, so you understand the theory.  This one I&#39;ll cast and let you observe.”<br />
<br />
“What are you going to do to her?  Is this going to be like &#39;Thinner&#39;?”<br />
<br />
“Ugh, gross, no.  I&#39;m going to alter her metabolism so she loses weight easier.”<br />
<br />
“How is that a punishment?”  Cole frowned.<br />
<br />
“Because she&#39;ll lose her weight from her breasts, hips, and ass before anywhere else.”<br />
<br />
Cole chortled, then coughed as she swallowed a piece of food.  Talking was a bit difficult for a moment, so she gave the demon a thumbs up.<br />
<br />
“You mentioned she likes tormenting you?  Anything else?  I like a good comeuppance.”<br />
<br />
“She&#39;s super homophobic, and she&#39;s convinced I&#39;m gay.  I mean, she&#39;s kind of right, but you&#39;re the first girl I&#39;ve ever been with.  But she likes to make snide comments about it.”  <br />
<br />
“Tch.  I really don&#39;t like her.  Then I&#39;m going to show you how to cast an orientation spell.”  The demon made a face.<br />
<br />
“Woah.  You can do that?  Just...make someone gay or straight?”  Cole&#39;s eyes widened.  “So if you wanted to, you could have made me...uh...more normal?”<br />
<br />
“Why would I want to do that?  You&#39;re unique, and it&#39;s one of your more fascinating traits!  I mean, I guess if it really hinders you, you can cast it on yourself sometime, but honestly, I would rather break a stained glass window.”  Lee shook her head.<br />
<br />
“Even one in a church?”<br />
<br />
“I rather like churches.  My problem is with my Creator, not the people who believe in Him.  Also, I&#39;ve met Yahosua.  He&#39;s really a sweet kid.”<br />
<br />
“Who?”<br />
<br />
“You call him Jesus.”  The demon replied.<br />
<br />
“Urk.  Sorry, seriously lapsed Catholic here.  I guess some things stay with you.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, was that blasphemous?”  Lee grinned.<br />
<br />
“Maybe a little bit?  It&#39;s just weird to hear someone talk about Jesus so...I dunno, naturally.”<br />
<br />
“She said, talking to a Duke of Hell.” <br />
<br />
“Oh...shut up.”  Cole frowned.<br />
<br />
“If I did that, you wouldn&#39;t learn much.  So I refuse.”  Lee teased.<br />
<br />
“Bah.  You&#39;re lucky you&#39;re hot...and all powerful...and amazing in bed...”<br />
<br />
“Compliments will get you everywhere, my dear.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Later, they sat in the living room.  Lee had picked out some clothes from Cole&#39;s wardrobe, and given the girl back a foot of her height (making her 4&#39; tall), so she was wearing a t-shirt that currently came down to her knees.  <br />
<br />
“Say, Lee, you could just make clothes out of thin air if you wanted, couldn&#39;t you?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, are you bothered that I&#39;m borrowing your clothes?”  Lee asked.<br />
<br />
“Uh, no...actually...it&#39;s kind of hot for some reason.  I was just curious.”<br />
<br />
Lee laughed.  “I hope it has nothing to do with the fact that I&#39;m wearing your underwear.  Well yes, I can, and it&#39;s fairly easy to do.  To be honest, it&#39;s part of my getting to know you better.  Though I admit, I like your scent.”  <br />
<br />
“You do?”  Cole sniffed herself.  “I don&#39;t wear anything other than deodorant.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, well, you&#39;d be surprised how few people have that pleasant, neutral scent.  I like how you taste as well.”  She showed her teeth.<br />
<br />
Cole gulped.  That could be taken a few different ways.  “So you were going to teach me how to lose weight?”<br />
<br />
“More specifically, how to transmute mass into nothing- or at least, nothing physical.  You can use this to gain a svelte figure, or even shrink in size- though getting back to normal can prove to be difficult, so I would only suggest doing that in an emergency.  We&#39;ll start with an inanimate object, but organic materials use the same principles.”<br />
<br />
Lee went on to explain, but even though Cole was paying close attention, she didn&#39;t quite understand.  “Maybe I should be taking notes...”<br />
<br />
“Hm.  It has been awhile.  You understand that what we think of as physical objects are just mostly empty space, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but I guess what&#39;s tripping me up is, how do you shrink something without losing something important?  You made me small enough to fit in your mouth, but I could still breathe and think...”<br />
<br />
Lee smiled. “Ah, I see.  You assumed that a human the size of a bug can&#39;t possibly function in the same way.  What you have to come to terms with is, physical laws don&#39;t exist.  No, I see that look, let me explain.”<br />
<br />
She held up her hand and a black sphere just sort of appeared in mid air.  It was about the size of a basketball.  “This is a model of the primordial universe.  We call this Kaos.  It&#39;s an extremely low-energy state.  It&#39;s a whole lot of nothing.  Just empty space and some proto-matter floating around.  No light, barely any movement.  Then, something happened.<br />
<br />
Within this dead space, a consciousness began to form.  It became aware of itself, and things that were not itself.  This was a very slow process- though in such a place as Kaos, time almost has no meaning.  This consciousness finally came to an inevitable conclusion.<br />
<br />
It had no purpose, no Creator.  It was, and it was all that was.  It was alone.  So it began to play with these bits of matter, bringing them together, creating motion and activity.  And one day, two chunks of matter collided.  And there was...a very loud explosion.”<br />
<br />
“No dramatic &#39;let there be light&#39;?”  Cole asked.<br />
<br />
“Only you know who was there, so maybe, maybe not.”  She shrugged.<br />
<br />
“You don&#39;t really care for the G-word, do you?”<br />
<br />
“No, but that&#39;s a whole other story.  Fallen don&#39;t care for it because...well there are painful memories.  Lesser demons can find talking about the Creator, or even being around strong faith or Heavenly beings, to be physically painful.”<br />
<br />
“Oof, that&#39;s rough.  Wait, lesser demons?  Where do those come from?”<br />
<br />
Lee pointed at Cole.  “What do you think I&#39;m going to do with you when you die?”<br />
<br />
“Me?!  I&#39;m going to become a demon?”  Cole blinked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, and if you continue to be interesting, you&#39;ll have a very high station.  Now stop changing the subject- you&#39;ll learn everything in due time.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, teacher.”<br />
<br />
“Good girl.  Do you want to be taller?”<br />
<br />
&#39;Hm, so this is my reward for good behavior?&#39;, Cole realized.  “Can I take a raincheck?  It&#39;s...kind of cool.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, dear.  You&#39;re adorable.  I&#39;m tempted to keep your permanently smaller.”  Lee smiled.<br />
<br />
“That might get people asking some questions...but I can&#39;t say I&#39;d mind too much.”  Cole said.  She wasn&#39;t ready to say so, but having someone as beautiful as Lee call her &#39;cute&#39; and &#39;adorable&#39; made her feel pretty good.<br />
<br />
“We can talk about that later.  Alright, so...” the black orb turned bright.  “The universe as you know it was born.  The Creator just watched as it expanded, stars were born, died, and new ones appeared.  Around stars, primordial matter gathered and through accretion, formed into planets.  The universe was on autopilot at this point.<br />
<br />
Eventually, on some long-forgotten world, life began.  It was a strange sort of life, and very fragile.  The first living things only lasted for a short time before the climate of the world changed and they died.<br />
<br />
Our Creator mourned.  As they watched, it happened again, and again.  Each time, failure.  The odds of life surviving in this universe were very very slim.  And eventually, something would come along to snuff it out.  So what do to?<br />
<br />
Obviously, the odds needed to be changed.  So the next time life began, D, as I will call him/her/it from here on out, observed what the living things needed to survive, and made sure that the lifeforms would have plenty of those things.”<br />
<br />
“D?”  Cole asked.<br />
<br />
“For Deus, but it can also be Dumbass or Dickhead, depending on my mood.”  Lee winked.<br />
<br />
“Right.” Cole pulled her knees up to her chest.  She was starting to get a handle on Lee&#39;s expressions, and sure enough, the demoness seemed very interested in Cole&#39;s movements.  &#39;I think Dantalyon has a weakness for cute things.&#39;<br />
<br />
“Now then, after awhile, the living creatures stopped changing.  They were alive, but only because of D&#39;s intervention.  Wondering why this was so, D watched as they expanded until they covered their entire planet.  Then something strange happened.  The living creatures started killing each other!<br />
<br />
They had everything they needed, but space.  So in order to survive, they had to make room!  And over time, they started to change, becoming better at surviving- and better at killing.<br />
<br />
Adversity!  That was the key.  A thing won&#39;t change unless it needs to.  But D had no control over how this change occurred, and how long would it take before a living thing became aware?  D was tired of being lonely, so they cheated a little.  They tried to create a copy of themselves.”<br />
<br />
“Oh wow, how did that go?”<br />
<br />
Lee spread her arms.  “D created the first Angel.  A being that exists in a state beyond matter or energy, yet lives and is aware.  But despite D&#39;s efforts, the Angels were less than it was.  And their evolution was practically stagnant, because they could do anything they needed to.”<br />
<br />
“So to make you evolve, Go...er...D...would have to find something that would force you to.  Which means they&#39;d have to find something that could force them to evolve?”<br />
<br />
“The Plan in a nutshell.  You have no idea how long it took us to figure it out, and here you are, a girl barely 17, and you get it.”  Lee seemed very pleased.  “And we were there, doing D&#39;s bidding, and it never occurred to us to ask questions.  We were...too perfect.<br />
<br />
But D had discovered something.  If a living thing is given a pattern to follow, it&#39;s evolution can be guided, and directed.  They started creating all manner of creatures, not by creating them in their final form, but giving them the...instructions, I guess could say, for what they -could- become.  The results were still unpredictable, as responses to adversity are nearly infinite, but there was now an end goal.<br />
<br />
Humans were the first thing D created with the sole purpose of becoming a thing like themselves.  Potentially beyond even the Angels.  To do this, they needed more than just instructions, however.  The evolution could take many many lifetimes.  So a human has two components.  Their physical body, and their immortal soul.<br />
<br />
The soul evolves in response to the experiences of it&#39;s many lives, even if it doesn&#39;t remember them.  A successful soul evolves a tiny bit more each time, goes to Heaven, then after a time, is reborn.”<br />
<br />
“And that&#39;s why you can turn souls into demons?”  Cole asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, but that&#39;s not the answer I was trying to give you.  Those operating instructions are, in a very real way, why you are the way you are.  But it goes beyond that.  Since you are just a tiny bit like D, you have the ability to alter reality around you, on a very small scale.  In aggregate, that is what gives humans their incredible luck- even with divine intervention, you really should have died out a long time ago.  But you persist as a species, because you are each demanding the universe change it&#39;s rules to allow you to survive.  <br />
<br />
When I shrank you, you should have ceased to be human.  But your soul is capable of making changes to reality sufficient enough to bend physical laws to allow you to survive.”<br />
<br />
“...wait.  That&#39;s magic, then?”<br />
<br />
Lee clapped.  “Yes!  Yes!  Magic is simply forcing the universe to do what you want.”<br />
<br />
“So magic words and rituals...don&#39;t matter?”  Cole frowned.<br />
<br />
“No, they do.  Because humans who believe in magic, believe you need these things.  Thus, while you can do magic without them, it&#39;s much easier to go with the flow.”<br />
<br />
“Huh.  But you don&#39;t need to cast spells.”<br />
<br />
“No, but that&#39;s because humans don&#39;t really believe metaphysical beings have much in the way of limits.  Many don&#39;t believe things like myself exist at all, if we&#39;re being honest.  In time, you can dispense with the trappings as well.  Though I sometimes use them myself.<br />
<br />
It does make things a tiny bit easier, but mostly, I like doing things with style.”<br />
<br />
Cole nodded.  “And when I&#39;m small, the changes I need to make are smaller so they are easier.  But if you made me 20&#39; tall, I&#39;d have problems.”<br />
<br />
“The energy required would be immense.  You think you have an appetite now!  It&#39;s not impossible, but you&#39;ll need to learn both magics that can compensate, and how to tap into outside sources of magic to do it- am I assuming you want to be a giant?”<br />
<br />
“Well...it could be fun.”  Cole said.<br />
<br />
“A later lesson then.  Now, your shirt.  Make it fit you.  You have everything you need, you just need less of it.  Imagine what it has to look like, what size it needs to be.  Then gather your will, and try to have a little style.”<br />
<br />
Cole took a deep breath.  “That which was made for middling tall, become a thing for someone small!”<br />
<br />
The shirt started glowing, and it began to shrink!  The glow got very bright, and then, it was gone.  She was now naked from the waist down.  “Ack!”<br />
<br />
“Hm.”  Lee got up and examined the shirt.  “How curious.  Despite what I told you, you did it wrong.”<br />
<br />
“I did?  I&#39;m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“No, it&#39;s not a bad thing.  I&#39;m just curious how you did it.  You didn&#39;t transmute the matter into a gas as you were supposed to.  Instead, this shirt has the same amount of matter, it&#39;s just more dense.”<br />
<br />
“Oh shit, really?  I didn&#39;t notice.  So it&#39;s heavier than it should be?”<br />
<br />
“And much more durable.  I&#39;m just not sure where the energy came from, you should be unconscious.  Are you hungry?”<br />
<br />
Cole thought about that.  “I mean, I could eat, but it&#39;s not a big deal.”<br />
<br />
“An unexpected talent!  Ah, I should warn you, don&#39;t do that to anything alive.  Despite what I said, most people don&#39;t have the strength to compensate for suddenly becoming denser.”<br />
<br />
“Eep!”  <br />
<br />
Lee patted Cole on the head.  “Let&#39;s get you some pants.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Lee made Cole a more normal height, though still quite tiny compared to her usual size, several inches below 5&#39;.  She demonstrated the proper technique by shrinking some of Cole&#39;s clothes to fit her new size, and the two went for a walk.<br />
<br />
“What if people recognize me?”  Cole asked.<br />
<br />
“Hm, good point.”  Lee snapped her fingers.<br />
<br />
At first Cole didn&#39;t feel any different, but her center of gravity seemed to shift, and she realized her breasts were much smaller.  Looking down her shirt, she saw she only had buds, not even enough to wear a training bra!<br />
<br />
“Holy shit, you made me younger?!” She was astonished at her higher-pitched voice.<br />
<br />
“Indeed.  Now you&#39;re a girl of 11.  That should be enough to make people realize you can&#39;t be Cole.”<br />
<br />
“Unless I somehow fell in the Fountain of Youth, I guess.”  Cole wasn&#39;t sure what to think about this turn of events.<br />
<br />
“Oh here, I know.”  Cole felt her scalp itch, and there was more weight on her head. <br />
<br />
“My hair!  It&#39;s growing!”<br />
<br />
“Yes it is.”  Deft fingers started to brain Cole&#39;s hair, and she felt...giddy...every since she was little, she liked it when her hair was touched and played with.  “There, and now, the finishing touch.”  She produced a hairband with a large blue bow attached to it, and put it on Cole&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
Lee produced a mirror, and saw her hair was now past her shoulders, and instead of being straight, it was styled into gentle curls.  The bow made her look stupidly cute.  Cole smiled up at Lee.<br />
<br />
“I like it.”<br />
<br />
“Good!”  Lee smiled, and they went outside.  Lee explained the spell she was going to use on Linda and how it worked.  “As I said, I won&#39;t let you cast it, not yet.  But we&#39;ll need something to establish a connection to her.  A part of her body, like hair, or a personal possession.”<br />
<br />
“Huh.  I don&#39;t have anything like that.  We&#39;re related, does that help?”<br />
<br />
“Only if I was trying to cast the spell on your whole family.  Even at low power, it would hit you, your cousin, her mother...and any siblings your cousin has.”<br />
<br />
“Aunt Beth isn&#39;t a prize either.  You could cast it on me and dispel it, right?”  Cole asked.<br />
<br />
“I could, but there&#39;s another way.  We can go visit your Aunt.”  Lee grinned.<br />
<br />
“Uh, looking like this?”<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry, remember what I said, that I can be invisible and intangible?  I can do the same for you.  Now all we need is a car.  Which is why we&#39;re taking a walk.”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re going to buy one?”<br />
<br />
“No, dear.  I&#39;m going to steal one.”  Lee grinned.<br />
<br />
“Oh.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Lee finally came across a classic car that an old man on the other side of her block owned.  He only drove it on Sundays.  Today being a Saturday, it was out in his driveway being cleaned.<br />
<br />
“My, he really enjoys that car.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, that&#39;s Mr. Gideon.  He&#39;s a nasty old guy, but he loves his car.”  Cole supplied.<br />
<br />
“Not for long.”  She walked up to Mr. Gideon, who looked like he was about to yell at her, but Lee instead rose on the balls of her feet (Mr. Gideon was still a tall man) and whispered in his ear.<br />
<br />
Whatever she&#39;d said, he looked shaken to the core.  “No...please...I don&#39;t want to...”<br />
<br />
“A simple choice, Mr. Gideon.  Sell me your car, and you&#39;ll have twenty more years to make the people on this Earth miserable.  Otherwise...”<br />
<br />
The old man looked defeated.  “I&#39;ll get the title for you.”  He shuffled off.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit, what did you do?”  Cole asked.<br />
<br />
“I told him exactly when he was going to die, and how.”<br />
<br />
“And he believed it?”<br />
<br />
“I can be very persuasive when I need to be.  So I offered him more life, if he gave me his car.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m shocked you didn&#39;t try to get his soul.”  Cole remarked.<br />
<br />
“That old thing?  He&#39;s already going to Hell, and I have no use for someone who is kept alive on sheer spite.  I do feel sorry for Mrs. Gideon though.  So what I didn&#39;t tell him is that the stroke won&#39;t kill him, but the quality of his life will depend greatly on his wife&#39;s good nature.”<br />
<br />
“I mean, he deserves that, but damn.  Remind me not to piss you off.  Ever.”<br />
<br />
Lee patted Cole on the head.  “Don&#39;t worry, my pet.”<br />
<br />
&#39;So I&#39;m a pet to her&#39;, Cole thought.  &#39;I guess it could be worse.&#39;<br />
<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later, they were crusing down the road in Lee&#39;s new ride- a 1958 Series 62 Coup deVille.  The car looked and smelled brand-new, and it rode like a dream.  The only change Lee had made was “lower it&#39;s carbon footprint” and change the paint job to black.<br />
<br />
“Do you think I could drive your car sometime?”  Cole asked.<br />
<br />
“If you&#39;ve been a very good girl, I may consider it.”  Lee winked, turning on the radio.  An old song began to play, which Cole guessed was by The Moody Blues, though she didn&#39;t recognize it.<br />
<br />
<br />
When they arrived at her Aunt&#39;s house, Cole was surprised.  They had covered a lot of distance in a short time!  “Did you cheat?” <br />
<br />
“A little, yes.  I had to limit it, you&#39;re not ready for the Backroads just yet.”<br />
<br />
“What are the Backroads?”<br />
<br />
“Shortcuts through time and space.  D put them there for reasons no one is quite sure about.  Only a few Angels and Fallen know about them, let alone how to navigate them.  It&#39;s hard for humans to travel that way, because you perceive time in a linear fashion.  It&#39;s hard for you to handle time that flows in other directions.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, so what could happen?”<br />
<br />
“Well, for example, if you traveled to a point in time before you were born, you might disappear completely, as if you never existed, or change into one of your familiar ancestors.”<br />
<br />
“Um.  Yikes.”<br />
<br />
“Yikes, indeed.  It&#39;s a rare reaction, but something similar happened the last time I tried it.”<br />
<br />
“Uh, did the person...disappear?”  Cole shuddered.<br />
<br />
“Yes, but it wasn&#39;t that bad.  At first I thought it was, when they started to shrink unti they were nothing more than an infant, and then....poof!  But I later found out that their prenatal form had been transferred into the womb of a young woman at the time.  Causing her to be reborn in the past!<br />
<br />
Which made a teensy little paradox, especially when she started to remember who she was and thought to use her future knowledge for her own gain, the little minx!”  Lee chuckled.  “I gave her such a spanking for that.  But I did admire her moxie.”<br />
<br />
“I mean.  I&#39;d be tempted to do the same if I was born a hundred years ago.”  Cole admitted.<br />
<br />
“And I&#39;d swat you just the same.  Though I wasn&#39;t too harsh on the girl.  I gave her a choice.  She could stay in her new life, without her memories, or to come back with me.  She chose to stay, and that was the last I saw of her until she died.  And then some busybody Angel tried to say that since she died before she was born, I couldn&#39;t possibly claim her soul, because she hadn&#39;t sold it to me yet!”<br />
<br />
Lee frowned.  “Quite vexing, to say the least.”<br />
<br />
“Did she go to Heaven...on a technicality?”  Cole was surprised.<br />
<br />
“Well since I&#39;d wiped her memories, she had regained her purity in Heaven&#39;s eyes.  I called foul, but ultimately, Lucifer told me to accept the win.  I had gotten a corrupted soul into Heaven.  Not many Devils can say they&#39;ve pulled that off!”<br />
<br />
Cole giggled.  “I&#39;m sure they made some new rules about that, so it won&#39;t happen again.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes, Hell may have all the bureaucrats, but no bureaucracy invented can match Heaven.  Anyways, let&#39;s go in.  Nobody can see us, and we can walk through walls, but I suggest you limit yourself to doors and windows.”<br />
<br />
“Let me guess, humans have a hard time moving through things not meant to be moved through?”<br />
<br />
“Very good!  Gold star!”  Lee smiled.<br />
<br />
<br />
Linda wasn&#39;t home, but they did find a hairbrush, which was all Lee needed.  “Should we curse her mother as well?”<br />
<br />
“Yes please.  She&#39;s more insufferable than Linda is!”<br />
<br />
Lee explained the spell in detail before casting it.  It was a simple matter to extend it&#39;s scope a generation back, though as Lee explained, it would also affect Linda&#39;s female children.  “Sins of the Mother, and all that”.<br />
<br />
“So if my Aunt had more kids...the same?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  But since they will both turn into lesbians, that might not be a problem.  Now how bad should we hit them?”  Lee grinned.<br />
<br />
“Define...bad.”<br />
<br />
“Well, we can go from bi-curious all the way to completely girl crazy.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m liking girl crazy, but I don&#39;t know if my Aunt can take that.  She&#39;s...pretty religious, and a prude.”  Cole explained.<br />
<br />
“Ah, thinking she might double down on that, or go quietly crazy?  I mean, I could increase her libido so she can&#39;t ignore it but...since she&#39;s about to become a woman with the figure of a tween boy, that might be difficult.  Is she good looking, your Aunt?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah she is.  It&#39;s where Linda gets her insufferable good looks from.”<br />
<br />
“So a hookup isn&#39;t beyond the realm of possibility then.  I&#39;ll add a dash of increased luck with their new preferred genders.  Though if they can&#39;t fix their rotten personalities, that won&#39;t help much.”<br />
<br />
“In that case, go for total girl crazy.  But can you have it, sort of sneak up on them?”  Cole asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes.  Good call.  Each day they become a little less heterosexual maybe without even realizing it, until one day...your poor uncle.”  The demon chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Eh, Uncle Jared?  I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be fine.”  Cole shrugged.  He wasn&#39;t a bad guy, but since he rarely stood up to his wife and spoiled brat daughter, she wasn&#39;t too worried about his well being.<br />
<br />
“So be it!”  She gathered her spell, like threads of magical energy, wove them together, and released it.  “There, should take a few days before they notice the weight loss.  High five!”<br />
<br />
Cole giggled and leaped up to slap Lee&#39;s palm.  “You&#39;re awesome, Lee.”<br />
<br />
“Why thank you!  But you must be hungry by now.  We&#39;ll find a good restaurant.  Then...ice cream!”<br />
<br />
Cole cheered.  Being young apparently made her extra happy about ice cream.  Not that she was complaining about that.</p>
