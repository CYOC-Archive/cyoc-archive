<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When I woke later that night I found myself in a big muscled body. A Greek god. Where was my blubber butt? My man boobs? My double chins? My gargantuan girth? <br />
<br />
What the hell happened?<br />
<br />
I looked around as I lifted my massive muscled for from the wreckage of the chair I had been seated upon.<br />
<br />
There in the wreckage was the Chronivac. Smashed beyond repair. And on the screen was a muscled man that would only be seen in comic books. And it looked like I was stuck this way unless I could get it fixed or get a new one but this one came from an anonymous source so how could that ever happen.<br />
<br />
I was so depressed that I decided to go out drinking. It looked like I would always be this muscled man.<br />
<br />
Now I also noticed on the screen that it had changed my sexuality from hetero to homo. 100%. I did notice that I had an 18&quot; penis but it also said I was 100% bottom. It seemed as though everything I could read on the screen was filled with opposites.<br />
<br />
The screen could no longer scroll and soon it went dim and flickered out. I wish I could have read the other changes but it was not to be.<br />
<br />
I did go out to get a drink and found myself in a leather bar where I sat down at the bar and soon had a bevy of cute young men huddling around me. Cute? Did I just call them cute? But they were cute. Jeff, Bob and Ryan were three of the sexiest ones. <br />
<br />
Jeff was a slim twink of a man. About 180 and 6&#39; tall.<br />
<br />
Bob was a muscled man, not in my caliber, well then no one could be in my caliber. He looked like he had just gotten out of high school football and had kept up his training. He had quite the six pack.<br />
<br />
Ryan was more of a bear. Not fat but had that middle eastern look to him that had more fur than flesh showing. A bit of a paunch around the middle and a full beard. Each one was 18, Ryan almost 19 in about a month. But I decided to take them home with me. Where we played all night. And in the morning we all came to the conclusion that they had to move in with me.<br />
<br />
I found out one of the settings of the Chronivac fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
I had wanted to be a gainer but it made me a feeder and each one of these men began to gain weight very quickly and there must have been some gainer pheromone that I was exuding because they each one embraced the gainer life.<br />
<br />
Jeff became quite pear shaped. He was bottom heavy. His six inch penis almost enveloped in the fat pad but as I sat on his lap while feeding him I could feel his little pecker poking at my hole and as I stuffed him he would cream in my ass, well just at the entrance.<br />
<br />
Ryan just kept growing equally all over. He too had somewhat of a small penis but his was thick as a beer can but he stretched my hole out as he fucked me. He would usually have me on my back while he ate his buffet off of my abs. This gave him a little more control of how he used me.<br />
<br />
Now Bob had the greatest gains. He, in less than 6 months had more than doubled his weight, closing in on 500 pounds. He had huge man boobs. The kind I dreamed of. I would suck on his for hours. His belly was what you might call perky. It stuck out from his torso such that it made him look even bigger. He had to wear suspenders attached to a leather belt to hold up his pants. He had the largest penis of them all, one I loved to ride, almost 12 inches. He could have been a porn star when he was slimmer but now he was a whale. And I was just so jealous of his size and in awe of it at the same time. If I couldn&#39;t be the gainer it was good to find some men to fatten up. To live out my fantasies vicariously through their bodies.</p>
<hr/><h3>
And they enjoyed it. Or was that the pheromones talking for them?</h3>
