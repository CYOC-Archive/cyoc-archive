<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The smell of tomato sauce and sausage wafted through Rusty’s nose.  He had talked some more with RK about how to handle Muffin before Rusty’s rumbling belly had prompted RK to go into the kitchen to cook dinner.<br />
<br />
Rusty still felt that they should do something to help Muffin, to help Troy, but RK had held firm that they just had to leave her like this.  <br />
<br />
Rusty looked at the books scattered on the table in front of him.  The Book of Beast was too risky.  Even if Muffin couldn’t read, Troy still knew all of the spells in it.  That meant there was a chance that Muffin did as well, and that could easily end in disaster if she tried to fix herself with something like Polymorph.<br />
<br />
The Book of Transmutation was just out.  The last thing that they needed was a paradox being triggered by Muffin turning herself into a sex doll.<br />
<br />
RK always kept Divination tucked under his shirt so that wasn’t an option.  Not that Rusty thought anything in there could help Muffin, but Rusty honestly had no idea what was even in that book so who knows.<br />
<br />
That just left Body.  Rusty flipped the book open and looked through the spells.  There was no way that he could let Muffin use most of these.  Then his attention was drawn to a spell that might be able to fix this without screwing everything up in the process…<br />
<br />
“I’ll be back in a bit, I need to take a dump,” Rusty said, having clandestinely slid the book under his police jacket.  Not that he really needed to - RK was too preoccupied cooking their dinner to turn around as Rusty walked down the hallway to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Opening the door, Rusty saw Muffin squatting down in the shower with a small pool of feminine lube pooling on the tile below her.<br />
<br />
Muffin’s eyes were squinted shut while her beak was pressed closed.  She had wrapped her arms under her belly, which was being pulled taut by straining muscles.  Behind her, Rusty could see her tail feathers quivering while she took deep, slow breaths.  Then Rusty’s gaze was drawn slightly below Muffin’s bottom, where a blunt, white eggshell was just barely visible crowning.  Rusty didn’t need to ask to know that she was mid contraction.<br />
<br />
Rusty didn’t want to bother her, so he just walked over to the toilet, dropped his pants and sat down.  As he positioned himself on the seat, Rusty heard Muffin exhale a long breath of relief.  Her muscles relaxed, her tail stopped quivering, and turned to look at Rusty, a look of embarrassment over having been seen like this evident in her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Sorry man but I didn’t go all day and you kind of got rid of the other bathrooms…” Rusty said, trailing off as Muffin just kept looking at him.<br />
<br />
Neither of them said anything, and Rusty felt awkward going to the bathroom in front of Muffin like this.  But it didn’t take long before Rusty realized exactly what Muffin was looking at – his red canine cock was hanging flaccidly from his crotch, and Muffin was staring directly at it.  Rusty didn’t say want to say anything… he didn’t want to presume… until he saw the tip of Muffin’s tongue run along the edge of her beak.<br />
<br />
“Look Muffin I’m sorry but…” Rusty didn’t really know what to say, he remembered being in love with Troy, but it wasn’t Troy he was staring at squatting in the shower, “I mean, I’m not really into chicks.  Like, you know, I’m not really into chickens or girls and you’re kind of…”<br />
<br />
Muffin didn’t say anything, she didn’t have to.  Rusty saw her eyes get a bit duller and her head hang a bit lower.  He couldn’t imagine being stuck like that.  He couldn’t imagine what it was like to be Troy right now.<br />
<br />
“Look uh, I mean maybe we can get you a strap on or something, we can maybe figure something out, I’ll talk to RK, maybe he’s into something like that,” Rusty wasn’t sure that he intended to follow through on that promise, but what else could he say to her?<br />
<br />
Muffin barely had time to appreciate Rusty’s offer before another contraction hit.  Rusty saw the muscles in her stomach visibly suck in, pulling her bulging belly first back towards her spine, then down towards her hip.  Even from his position on the toilet, it was evident that every muscle in her body was working in unison to try press down on the egg – every fiber that she had was taut, every limb slightly quivering.  Her eyes were once again squinted with determination as she pushed as hard as she could.<br />
<br />
But for all of her effort, and for how much the egg looked like it was moving in her stomach, Rusty noticed that the crowning shell below her didn’t seem to move much.  He could see a slight ring of flesh protruding around the side of it, and while it was hard to tell from the toilet, it looked like her vagina was stretched as wide as it would go.<br />
<br />
None of which changed the fact that Rusty had come to the bathroom for his own business, and he took Muffin’s current predicament as an opportunity to take care of his own needs.<br />
<br />
_________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
The two of them finished at about the same, with Muffin’s contraction subsiding as Rusty flushed the toilet.  Glancing below her once again, Rusty noted that, for all of her work, it didn’t look like Muffin had made any progress on the egg.<br />
<br />
“Does that hurt?”  Rusty asked Muffin as she squatted in the shower, panting.  He wasn’t sure that he wanted to know the answer.<br />
<br />
Muffin looked at him with sad eyes and nodded.  <br />
<br />
“Yes,” she said with a quiet cluck.<br />
<br />
Rusty’s heart broke for her.  As much as Muffin was sitting in front of him, Rusty knew that it was Troy inside of that chicken body.  He knew that Troy was suffering, and he had to do something to stop that.<br />
<br />
“You can’t read right?” Rusty may want to help, but first he had to make sure.<br />
<br />
Muffin shook her head.  <br />
<br />
“No,” she said between pants.<br />
<br />
Rusty reached into his police vest and slid the Book of Body out.  <br />
<br />
“RK says neither he nor I can do anything to help you, but he didn’t say that you can’t help yourself.”<br />
<br />
“This is the Book of Body,” Rusty continued, “one of the spells in here is Gestate, it lets you start or stop a pregnancy in someone, even turns them into a woman if they’re not already one.”<br />
<br />
“But you have to promise me Troy.  You have to promise that you will only use this on yourself to stop the eggs.  No reality change.  Nothing that is going to trigger paradox.  Just make your life tolerable while we deal with the other books, then we’ll change you into whatever you want.”<br />
<br />
Excitement filled Muffin’s face.  “Thank you, Rusty, thank you so much…” she started.<br />
<br />
“You have to promise me Troy, promise me that is all you will do.”<br />
<br />
“I promise,” Muffin replied.<br />
<br />
“Good, I’ll be back in 10 minutes to get this back from you, fix yourself before then,” Rusty said as he slid the book over to the shower.</p>
