<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ugh, honey, why y&#39;being so loud?&quot; Came a slightly slurred southern sounding drawl as the womanly figure stepped into the light...And Bill&#39;s heart and lungs about exploded. On the counter, the tiny version of Tammy seemed equally stunned before the redhaired girl that clearly was NOT Willow said something and rushed for a nearby dust-covered jar...Before darting back out and physically dragging the dumbstruck blonde back to the hiding place with her. But Bill failed to see any of this, as his eyes were locked on the stranger shambling up the narrow hallway from the bedroom.<br />
<br />
There, draped in a ratty looking shawl and a cheap looking pair of panties and NOTHING else, was a woman that looked remarkably like Willow! Only...there were differences. Her breasts were larger, her hair was darker, longer and less curly. That cute button nose that &#39;Dad Bill&#39; had booped so many times was a bit longer, and her lips were puffier, more pouty and...sluttier looking. Her brown eyes were more of a hazel, and flecked with green...And contained no visible recognition of the Willow that Bill knew.<br />
<br />
But she still looked like Willow. The cheekbones, the way she was carrying herself, the wide hips, and her voice (despite the accent).<br />
<br />
The woman that had been his daughter sauntered over to Bill, her tiny feet knocking aside beer cans and bottles (and softly cursing in the process) and fell into his arms. She was tiny next to him, but then again, most people likely were now, and this new Willow seemed at least four inches shorter than she&#39;d been before. And she smelled like...smoke. And beer. A LOT of beer. And with a tipsy sounding giggle before she wrapped her skinny arms around Bill&#39;s neck and lurched up, planting a heavy, sloppy as puffy lips collided with his own. And despite himself, despite the warning bells going off in his mind...Something made Bill stay there for a moment before his sane mind re-asserted itself and he firmly, but gently pulled out of the kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for breakfast...Baby when you gonna get on those patches? I love you but kissin&#39; you is startin&#39; to get like frenchin&#39; an ash tray!&quot; Willow said with a cough, sliding past Bill as her red-nail tipped fingers traced along the bulging muscles of his huge new arms as she headed for the fridge. There was a gust of cool air as it slid open, and Bill caught site of the appliance&#39;s interior; beer, beer, more beer, a sock, an opened can of beans, a bag of Reese&#39;s and a half-open box of pizza that didn&#39;t look safe to eat. But then the view was blocked by Willow&#39;s incredible ass as she bent over and dug around in the fridge before rising back up with two bottles of Briers, the local cheap beer. The new Willow stumbled around, knocking the door shut with a wiggle of her hips and handed a bottle to Bill, who, seeing no other option as he stared at the freely swinging breasts beneath the see-through shawl, took it dumbly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ima go get ready for work, baby. You workin&#39; today?&quot; Bill&#39;s former daughter turned sister turned shrunken sister turned...Roommate? Girlfriend? ...Wife? said as she popped the top off the bottle and took a swig. She closed her eyes and let out a groan of pleasure as the alcoholic beverage slid down her throat before she stared at Bill once more. The befuddled boy was silently for a moment before he realized she was waiting for a response.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, uh, don&#39;t think so? I thought I had to get to school...?&quot; He fumbled, and one of Willow&#39;s eyebrows arched up.<br />
<br />
&quot;School? Honey, you dropped out last year! That&#39;s why you can&#39;t get a job worth shit beyond mowing Ingerman&#39;s grass! And, I might add, why I gotta work at the gas station AND the club just so we can afford the rent in this dump and the cars!&quot; Willow&#39;s face and voice shared the same look of disappointment as she shook her head, formerly curly hair sloshing this way and that.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh god, I&#39;m a high school dropout? And I work for Big Jon!?&#39; Bill&#39;s mind began racing, but the strange new Willow in front of him kept the changed teen from descending into an internal scramble of trying to put together all this new information. He faked a smile he was certainly NOT feeling and twisted off the cap of his own bottle, taking a swig and expecting it to taste like dirt like the first time he&#39;d snuck a beer with Tom...Tammy...His...dad? Bill suddenly realized that there were MANY different lifetimes worth of memories starting to compete in his head as the alcohol swished in his throat and tasted...surprisingly good! He actually felt a bit of the soreness in his throat cool as he drank a little more than he should have. And then the other thoughts began. The ones about how...great Willow looked, and those huge tits just hanging there with nothing covering them...<br />
<br />
&#39;Wait what the FUCK Bill this is...was your daughter! Get your head in the game!&#39; Bill&#39;s inner voice yelled at him. But just when it seemed as if Bill was about to be in the doghouse in this newly twisted version of reality, Willow&#39;s face seemed to brighten.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, did...Oh baby, did you get the mowing job at the collegel?&quot; She suddenly gushed, &quot;Oh Billy, that&#39;s gonna help SO much! Maybe I can quit my job at the gas station!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure. Yeah. I uh, got the job. Yeah?&quot; Bill nodded, and then Willow was in his arms again, pressing her lips against his.<br />
<br />
&#39;But then again, this isn&#39;t exactly 2050...whenever.&#39; Another, darker voice said in Bill&#39;s mind as he felt something twinge in his pants. But then she released him with a giggle, and practically PRANCED back to the bedroom, leaving Bill stunned and with a growing erection pressing against pants that suddenly felt too tight on him.<br />
<br />
That was when he heard it. The tiny, shrill, unbroken shriek of rage coming from the counter, and his reverie was broken as he spun back to face a VERY upset looking Tammy standing in the middle of the counter next to a dirty spoon, jumping up and down and very clearly screaming at the top of her tiny lungs up at Bill. The redheaded girl was peering out from behind the dirty jar, casting looks between Tammy, Bill, the REST of the trailer, and herself as an errant hand continuously pushed a cascade of red hair out of her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck!&quot; Bill exhaled, and the downward force and volume of his voice LIFTED Tammy up and tossed her backwards, though that didn&#39;t stop the pint-sized and her giant-sized fury from immediately pulling herself up and continuing to scream until she was red in the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-&quot; Bill began, but then stopped as Tammy hunkered close to the counter, &quot;...Sorry!&quot; He whispered, &quot;Tammy, what the hell is going on!?&quot; He leaned in close, closer than he had when Tammy had been three inches tall, and tilted an ear towards the enraged blonde.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said, what the FUCK do you think you&#39;re doing, William Elias Strasserman!? That is your DAUGHTER and I am your WIFE! HOW DARE YOU ACT LIKE THAT! JUST LIKE A TYPICAL MAN THINKING WITH HIS DICK FIRST! YOU&#39;RE LUCKY I&#39;M SO SMALL OR I&#39;D KICK YOUR ASS RIGHT NOW!&quot; Tammy screamed upwards at the enormous ear that was dominating the sky above her.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t believe it. How...How DARE he do that!? First he SHRANK all of them and then Rob caught them and now Rob was some top heavy sexpot that had nearly gotten both of them killed and now...Now her...Tammy felt her fury fading as her knees went weak and she collapsed to the counter-top, hot tears rolling down her face.<br />
<br />
SHE was Bill&#39;s girlfriend! His wife! His...his soulmate! She was, literally, made for him! And for him to look at another woman like that, to KISS another woman...and for that woman to be their DAUGHTER!? It was too much, and Tammy considered herself a rather tough cookie, having been a suicidal athlete and then a loving mother and then a spunky girlfriend, but this was just too much. And now they were in some dump! Gone was HER immaculate home, gone was the pleasant and upkept home of the Strassermans (whoever they were now) and instead they were in this filthy pigsty!<br />
<br />
And...And why did Willow change!? It was bad enough to have these memories of her baby girl NOT being her baby girl and instead being Bill&#39;s older sister and the one who got Bill and Tammy together in the first place and now she was this...stanger! AND WHY DID SHE GET TO BE BIG AGAIN WHILE TAMMY WAS EVEN SMALLER THAN BEFORE!? The tiny blonde couldn&#39;t take the stress of it all anymore and collapsed in a pile of hot blubbery tears as her impossibly tall (and now scary looking) beau turned back to stare at her with a mixture of concern.<br />
<br />
Of course, that was when a tiny, blood-curdling scream filled the air.</p>
