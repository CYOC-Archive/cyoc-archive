<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The seven body bros looked out over the basketball court from the bleachers. They had chosen the highest one so that they could get a good view of their friends on the court and the crowd beyond the fences. As they expected, each and everyone had at least two heads on their body, with the number of arms and legs going no lower than two each. Inside the court, warming the benches and bleachers, were some of the bros&#39; friends, and some of their friends&#39; friends, or some of their friends&#39; brothers.<br />
<br />
One pair was ten-year-old Ryan, combined with his ten-year-old cousin Bradley--two heads, four arms, three legs. Some of the body bros were a bit confused that cousins were combined, but then some of them remembered that the pair&#39;s parents were each two sets of twins, and had married as such--since Ryan and Bradley&#39;s dads and moms were now conjoined, so were Ryan and Bradley themselves. Flanking Ryan and Bradley were their older brothers--since each had one older brother in the original world, in this world there were new brothers conjoined with the old ones. Next to Ryan were his older brothers--Derek and new brother Eli--and next to Bradley were his older brothers--Terry, Dylan, and Thatcher, of which only Thatcher originally existed.<br />
<br />
There were Mark, Max, and Zack. In the original timeline, Mark and Max were identical twins and Zack was a few years younger. In this world, Mark and Max were now conjoined, and Zack had two new brothers--Mac and Jack. The three original brothers were also good friends with Luke, a teenager who was Mark and Max&#39;s age, but apparently was not there. Maybe Luke was somewhere else in the city--Ty and his bros decided that they would swing by Luke&#39;s house later to see him and his new brother(s), as well as Luke&#39;s parents.<br />
<br />
Beyond the fences were even more people in the crowd--each body had at least two heads, two arms, and two legs. One pair of guys wore a brown shirt and jeans, with four arms, two legs, and two heads--their right-hand head had long blonde hair, their left-hand had short dark hair. There was a trio of girls in a dark grey shirt and black shorts--from their left-hand to their right, the heads had wavy black hair, curly brown hair, and long black hair. There were four brothers together in one body--four heads, eight arms, and four legs. Ty swore that they must be the quadruplet brothers Leo, Donnie, Raph, and Mikey--they were not quite identical brothers, but there was always a way to tell them apart.<br />
<br />
Another male group caught the bros&#39; attention. This group was somewhat bizarre, mainly because not all the heads looked as though they were the same age. The body had four legs, six arms, and six heads--two in front of two in front of another two. In the front, their right-hand head had a short beard but looked like a middle-aged man. The one next to him looked as though it were a child, possibly even a young teenager. Behind the &quot;middle-age&quot; head, there was another teenage-looking head, this one having fringes hanging over the right-hand side of his forehead. Next to him was a head looked to be the same age as the first head, but this one had a more feminine appearance--lipstick, eyelashes, and all. Behind the &quot;fringes&quot; head was yet another teenage-looking head, only this one had a lazy eye, stubble, and looked as though he were a mouth-breather given how his mouth looked. Behind the &quot;female&quot; head was one that looked as though he were the oldest--he had a long beard, and something of a stern expression on his face. The six-headed brothers wore a green shirt, and wore blue pants over their legs.<br />
<br />
At this point, the seven body bros decided that they had scoped enough of the crowd. Jack and Drake wanted to go back to the house to see if their parents had been added to the conjoined group&#39;s conjoined moms and conjoined dads when they were added to the group. Steven and Allen wanted to swing by and see their girlfriends from the party last night--maybe Jack and Drake&#39;s girlfriends had been added to theirs. Dustin and Peter wanted to stay and try a little fooling with the friends that were here playing basketball--not just the ones on the bleachers, but the ones that were playing and had been listed in the previous chapter. Ty&#39;s head was in the middle of their broad shoulders, and he dealt with the requests of Peter, then Steven, then Drake to his left, as well as those of Dustin, Allen, and Jack to his right. Ty was the one who controlled the wishing power, and it was his idea to make him, his friends, and everyone on Earth into conjoined siblings. The final decision for this debate was his own...</p>
