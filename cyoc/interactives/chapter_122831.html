<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danny had returned home from school, feeling tired and annoyed. He&#39;d been caught by his best friend staring at his cock at the urinal and it hadn&#39;t gone down well.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fuck Danny?!&quot; James spat when he noticed Danny leaning towards him slightly, his eyes making a line for his cock.<br />
<br />
Danny stood bolt upright in a moment, his piss splashing noisily against the porcelain, red colouring up his cheeks. They stood in silence, Danny was desperate to speak but there were no words. James just stared ahead, his face in a twisted angry look that meant don&#39;t fucking speak to me.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day James was clearly avoiding him. He went to the library and spotted James at one of the tables. James looked up and saw him, pulled a disgusted face and slamming his books in his bag stormed past him, shoulder barging him in the process. Danny wasn&#39;t sure but it sounded like he muttered fag as he passed. He was hoping he was wrong but deep down he knew this was the end for their friendship.<br />
<br />
Danny lay back on his bed, legs over the end of the bed, arm crooked over his eyes and silently cried.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later his Mum and little brother, Adam, came home, his Mother whistling cheerfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;You home sweetie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m home.&quot; Danny called back sniffling back tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;A package came this morning. It&#39;s in the living room.&quot; She hadn&#39;t noticed the sniffling and was busy getting her day sorted. His little brother ran up the stairs, thundering past his room into his own. For an eight year old he made so much noise.<br />
<br />
Wiping his face he pulled himself up and dragged his feet down the stairs. Maybe it was a one way ticket to Bermuda or a winning lottery ticket. In the living room there was a small box, wrapped in brown paper and tied up with string. He picked it up and shook it gently. There was a jingle, like maybe keys inside. Maybe it was the keys to a car. He knew none of these things were likely but after today he was hoping for anything to cheer his mood.<br />
<br />
Cutting the string with his own keys the paper opened out lightly. The box wasn&#39;t sealed and was just a plain cardboard box, maybe 10 inches long and wide and 5 tall. Opening the box inside he found a card and a small chain with a medallion attached. A bit like a St. Christopher but he didn&#39;t recognise the person carved into the silver coin shape.<br />
<br />
He opened the card:<br />
<br />
Dear Danny, I know I&#39;ve not been the greatest father to you and Adam but I hope this makes up for it all. The chain inside is called a St. Methuselah, it grants wishes. It was why I left, I never meant to but my wish took me away from you all. As the man of the house I hope you&#39;ll respect his gift and be thoughtful and kind with it. I know your mother will have done a fantastic job raising you and now you&#39;re 16 I give this gift to you. Wear it and wish and I promise you won&#39;t look back.<br />
<br />
Love Dad<br />
<br />
P.S. Don&#39;t tell anyone what the chain can do, I made that mistake, that&#39;s why I had to leave. Think your wishes through, there can be unexpected consequences!<br />
<br />
Danny stood staring at the card, tears forming in his eyes. His Dad had left when he was 8, just before Adam was born. 8 years and no contact, he left the family with nothing and now this.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it sweetie?&quot; His Mum called from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Danny croaked back, emotion taking his voice for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;The package, what did you get?&quot; His mother&#39;s footsteps began to move towards the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s... it&#39;s a necklace is all. Saw it on Amazon and ordered it with my birthday money. It wasn&#39;t expensive though.&quot; He lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s nice, it&#39;s pork chops tonight.&quot; His mother&#39;s footsteps turned back to the kitchen again.<br />
<br />
Danny rushed upstairs to his room, the necklace clutched in his hands.<br />
<br />
Facing his mirror he put the necklace on, admiring the shine reflecting off it from his lights. At least it wasn&#39;t ugly or too big, it looked understated and was easily hidden under his t-shirt due to the length of the chain.<br />
<br />
His phone buzzed. It was James. He was shaking a little. James had been his best friend since he was 6, and he was terrified he&#39;d just lost his friendship.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna come over and talk. I&#39;m really mad at you Danny. I&#39;ll be at yours in 5 minutes. We need to sort this shit out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuck, fuck, fuck. This was it. His friendship was going to be over. He&#39;d hidden his sexuality from James for the past 3 years and now... how could he have been so stupid. He wasn&#39;t even thinking when he looked, it wasn&#39;t intentional, he just did it.<br />
<br />
5 minutes can feel like hours. These 5 minutes felt like months. Eventually he heard the door bell.<br />
<br />
&quot;James is here Danny! Is he staying for dinner, I can pop another chop in!&quot; His mother called, letting the danger of loss in the door without a clue of what was going to happen. What he knew would happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Err... I don&#39;t know... Come up...&quot;<br />
<br />
James climbed the stairs. His footsteps sounded slow and deliberate, not like he usually sounds, taking two steps at a time, bounding up them.<br />
<br />
Danny was sat at his desk when James walked in. He looked a mixture of sad and angry. It was breaking Danny&#39;s heart. He really did love James and this was it. The final moment. Danny&#39;s heart was beating loud enough for him to hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Danny...&quot; James sighed and sat on the end of the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, don&#39;t. I don&#39;t want to hear it dude. What the fuck was that at school? Seriously what the fuck?&quot; James was staring at him, Danny could feel it. He was too busy examining his shoes it seemed. He neck wouldn&#39;t move, his eyes locked on his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck dude, are you...? Are you...gay?&quot; The last word was whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I what dude?!&quot; James stood up and for a moment Danny looked up at him and then back to his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Danny finally whispered. This was the first time he&#39;d admitted it to anyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck dude. Fuck!&quot; James sat back down again. He put his head in his hands. He looked on the verge of tears himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it... Is it that big of a... deal?&quot; Danny asked quietly, knowing the answer he was going to get.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Of course it is! I feel betrayed you didn&#39;t tell me, angry at myself I didn&#39;t notice and disgusted cause... well... you checked me out dude! I&#39;m not fucking gay!&quot; James was glaring at him now intently.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... I wish you were.&quot; Danny whispered to himself.<br />
<br />
James froze a moment. There was no flash or sound. Nothing extraordinary happened, Danny had forgotten all about the chain around his neck.<br />
<br />
James then laughed. A deep belly laugh. Danny looked up at him, confused, hurt and scared all at once.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what&#39;s funny?&quot; Danny asked, near to tears for the third time this evening.<br />
<br />
&quot;You dude! You thought I was serious! Fuck I&#39;m gay too!&quot; James was laughing again.<br />
<br />
Danny sat there totally confused now. &quot;You... You&#39;re... You are...?&quot; He sputtered out not knowing what to do or ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gay dude. I like cock. I want to fuck guys. I love men. I was angry before as I didn&#39;t know you were and you didn&#39;t feel like you could tell me.&quot; He walked over to Danny and hugged him, Danny sitting, James leaning down to hold him.<br />
<br />
Danny broke and the tears came, lots of tears. James stood shushing him and hugging him tightly.</p>
