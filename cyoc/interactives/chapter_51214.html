<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the pride and Madam Serenity were discussing things in Gill's office a young girl in another city was packing what clothes she had in a backpack and bag tears rolling down her cheeks. A porcelain doll that was sitting on her bed turned her head and asked, &quot;Are you sure you want to run away Cassii?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I can't stay here anymore Cindii,&quot; Cassii said shaking her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;But to run away you'll be revealing what you can do to the McKenzies and you have said you don't want anyone to know,&quot; Cindii said looking a little puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm about ready to kill them Cindii and I don't want that,&quot; Cassii said trying not to break down. &quot;If I killed them you know I'd be going to juvie and we wouldn't be able to see each other until I get out and I don't want that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it would be in self defense,&quot; Candii said shaking her head. &quot;No judge would convict you for killing them. And they wouldn't need to know that you killed them if you went adult wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would just make me feel really guilty,&quot; Cassii said stopping and hugging herself. Her bra, panties, and dress contracted hugging her too. &quot;Thanks Mom, Mike, Mark,&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where will we go?&quot; Cindii asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back to Glendale,&quot; Cassii answered opening her eyes again. &quot;Gill will listen to us and he'll do what he can to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sis, you know that if you go to Gill he'll have to report that you ran away,&quot; Cindii said. &quot;How will you explain how you got clear to Glendale in just minutes? Also the McKenzies can say that you're a troubled young girl if you run away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I won't be able to explain it to Social Services,&quot; Cassii said putting the last of her clothes in the bag. &quot;If need be I'll live in the mirror world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could drive you crazy!&quot; Cindii said sounding really shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have you, Mom, Mike, and Mark with me,&quot; Cassii said putting the backpack on. &quot;I can also visit this world if I want more company.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But running away from your problems isn't the answer,&quot; Cindii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you saying you'd want me to stay here?&quot; Cassii asked stunned. &quot;Stay here and possibly kill the McKenzies or commit suicide?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want you to commit suicide,&quot; Cindii said sadly. &quot;But...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;BUT NOTHING,&quot; Cassii screamed. &quot;IF I STAY HERE I'LL EITHER END UP KILLING THEM OR COMMITTING SUICIDE. IF I KILL THEM I'LL PROBABLY END UP COMMITTING SUICIDE ANYWAY. IF THEY MOLEST ME AGAIN I JUST MAY SNAP. I'M THEIR EIGHT YEAR OLD FOSTER DAUGHTER. THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSE TO MOLEST ME. THEY'RE SUPPOSE TO PROTECT ME.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They... they molested you?&quot; Cindii asked shocked. After Cassii nodded she asked, &quot;Why didn't you tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Cassii admitted sitting down on her bed her anger spent. &quot;Maybe it had to do with them possibly hearing me talking to you and saying that I evidently had some issues and making up the molestation to get attention. You know that I wouldn't lie in a court of law and if they brought up I was talking to you... She stopped sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you're right and we need to get out of here,&quot; Cindii said. &quot;We should have before this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had been looking for a way out,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;They just never left me alone long enough over the past three days to find it. This is the first time that they have and they lock me in my room.&quot; She gave a little giggle looking at her escape. Her mom, Mike, and Mark constricted around her again giving her hugs.<br />
<br />
'Oh honey,' Cassii heard her mom say in her head. Her mom was her dress. 'We're here for you. I wish it could be more.'<br />
<br />
'You'll get through this sis,' Mark said who was Cassii's bra. <br />
<br />
'Wish we could do more than just talk to you and give you our hugs,&quot; Mike said with an angry tone. He was currently Cassii's panties.<br />
<br />
'I'm sorry guys,' Rachael said sounding sad. She was the one that transformed Cassii's family into what they are today.<br />
<br />
Hearing Rachael in her mind saying sorry yet again Cassii thought back to that night a little over three months ago. They had been a happy family just getting ready for dinner when Rachael came barging into their house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Cassii's mom had asked the teenage girl.<br />
<br />
It had been clear to Cassii that Rachael was struggling with something. After a couple of seconds Rachael had said, &quot;This question is for all five of you. Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Knowing that she couldn't be transformed thanks to Cindii's wording when she transformed her Cassii had said, &quot;Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare,&quot; Mike had said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare,&quot; Mark had said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare,&quot; Cassii's mom had said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare,&quot; Cindii had said.<br />
<br />
Rachael had used the dare loophole to make them choose transform. After she had pointed to Cassii and said, &quot;Cassii, since you answered transform without the dare loophole you'll be the first to be transformed while the rest of your family watches. For your transformation you'll become a one piece swimsuit with your mind fully intact. You'll shrink or grow in order to fit whoever wears you. If you're torn or burned to ashes or otherwise damaged you'll reform to be a whole one piece swimsuit again. You'll be a one piece swimsuit forever more. No one can transform you into anything else. As soon as your transformation begins your clothes will disappear so we can watch your transformation unhindered. Your transformation will take five minutes to complete and it starts NOW.&quot; Rachael had gotten a confused look on her face when Cassii's clothes didn't disappear and after five minutes asked, &quot;Why aren't you a swimsuit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cindii already made me immune to being transformed when she transformed me,&quot; Cassii had said with a smile.<br />
<br />
For a moment Rachael had looked relieved then an inner struggle had occurred again. After a moment she said, &quot;Candii, Mike, Mark...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO leave them alone,&quot; Cassii had cried out tears rolling down her cheeks because she had a feeling she knew what was coming. Sadly that was all she could do. She couldn't move from where she was standing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I can't... I have... no choice... I'm sorry,&quot; Rachael had said in a barely audible voice. In a stronger voice she said, &quot;Candii, Mark, Mike your transformations will be into clothes for Cassii with your minds fully intact. Candii, you'll be a dress for her. Mark, you'll be a pair of panties for her. Mike, even though she doesn't really need one yet you'll be a bra for her. All three of you will be white with red and pink hearts. When Cassii wears you you'll be able to talk to her in her mind and with each other and others through her. You'll be able to constrict some to hug her. You'll always fit her. If you're torn, burned to ashes, or damaged in anyway you'll reform to be the whole form of your respective clothes. If you're separated from Cassii for more then a day and over a distance greater than thirty feet you'll be teleported to her. You'll be your respective articles of clothes forever more. No one will be able to transform you into anything else. Once your transformation starts your clothes will disappear so we can watch your transformation unhindered. Your transformation will take five minutes to complete and starts NOW.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as &quot;now&quot; left Rachael's lips their clothes disappeared. Over the next five minutes they transformed with looks of horror on their faces. The first thing that happened was every single bit of hair pulled back into their bodies. Then their skin turned white with the heart pattern. Once their skin had changed they started to shrink. Not only did they shrink but parts of their bodies seemed to melt into their bodies. All three lost their feet, hands, and heads. For Mark his entire upper body melted into his lower body. His legs melted up into his groin area and his penis and balls melted into his body. The inside of what was left of his body hollowed out and what was left turned to cotton leaving a pair of panties where Mike once stood.<br />
<br />
Mark's lower body melted into his upper body and continued until his chest on up remained. His nipples melted into his chest leaving it smooth. His arms melted into his shoulders and they kind of scooped out a bit. His neck scooped out giving him the shape of a bra. He hollowed out and what was left turned to cotton. Where Mike had stood was now a pull over bra.<br />
<br />
Cassii's mom's arm melted only up to a short sleeve length. Her legs melted together and billowed out a bit. Her breasts melted into her chest leaving it flat and smooth. Her neck scooped out a bit. Finally her body hollowed and what was left turned into cotton. Where Cassii's mom had stood was a dress. Cassii had to watch but as soon as as there transformations were done she dropped to her knees putting her head in her hands and cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Cindii,&quot; Rachael had said. &quot;For your transformation you'll become a porcelain doll that looks like you even wearing the dress and shoes you're wearing now with your mind fully intact. Like with your mother and brothers if you're torn, burned to ashes, broken, or otherwise damaged in anyway you'll reform into your porcelain doll form. You'll be able to move and talk though if you try to ask the question &quot;transform or dare&quot; you're mouth will close and you won't be able to open it again until you stop trying to ask that question. When Cassii holds you your mother and brothers will be able to talk to you in your mind through her if she's wearing them. You'll be a porcelain doll forever more. No one will be able to transform you into anything else. Your transformation will take five minutes to complete and starts NOW.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassii still had her head in her hands crying so she didn't see Cindii's skin become pale and porcelain nor her hair turn into artificial hair. She didn't see her shrink down to a height of 17 inches. She only saw when she heard Rachael start bawling herself. Rachael kept saying, &quot;I'm so sorry,&quot; over and over. Finally she stopped and looked at Cassii and Cindii and said, &quot;I didn't want to do that but I was dared to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Cindii had asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rachael Monroe,&quot; Rachael had said. &quot;Though that name soon won't matter because now I'll be transforming myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who did this to you?&quot; Cassii had asked believing her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't tell you because of the dare prohibiting me,&quot; Rachael said wailing at the end. &quot;The only good thing is I get to choose what I transform into as long as it's an inanimate object like I got to choose with you. I know what I'll transform into. For my transformation I'll transform into a gold heart locket with chain for you Cassii. Inside there will be a picture of your family before I transformed them and a picture of me so you don't forget what we looked like. I'll always fit around your neck. When you wear me I'll be able to talk to you in your mind and to your mother and brothers through you if you're wearing them and with Cindii if you're holding her. If I'm separated from you for more than a day and the distance greater than thirty feet I'll be teleported to you. If I'm broken, melted down, or otherwise damaged I'll reform back into my locket form. I'll be this locket forever more. No one will be able to transform me into anything else. When my transformation starts my clothes will disappear so you two can watch my transformation unhindered. My transformation will take five hours to complete and starts NOW.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachael's clothes disappeared and her skin turned gold while her body hair pulled back inside. Over the next five hours she had shrank and her legs melted into her body. Her breasts melted into her chest leaving it flat. Her arms melted into her body and her body took on a heart shape. Her neck became a short chain while her head was squashed into a little tear drop loop. Her hair changed into a gold chain with a clasp in the back. During her transformation Cassii and Cindii found out about her life and that she had thought she would be released since she couldn't transform Cassii. She had been dared to transform them all. They figured that since she did try it counted. Once her transformation was done she had looked down to see that she had pissed her pants sometime during it.<br />
<br />
'Earth to Cassii,' her mom interrupted her flashback. 'If you're going to go without them catching you you need to go now.'<br />
<br />
&quot;Right Mom thanks,&quot; Cassii said getting up. She looked around and stuffed her pillow and a blanket into the bag then slung it over her shoulder so she was wearing it. She picked up Cindii and said, &quot;Well it's time to go back to Glendale.&quot; What she was wearing disappeared as her body and hair became glass. Her feet lengthened while her thighs shortened giving her a digitigrade stance. Her nails on her toes and fingers became claws. Her face pushed out into a muzzle while her ears migrated up her head and became triangular. A tail extended out of her spine Finally the fur raised up out of her skin. She was now a humanoid glass wolf pup. Without any hesitation she stepped through the mirror in her room and as she did she became flesh and blood again. What she was wearing also reappeared.<br />
<br />
'That was weird,' Mark said. 'It was like I was floating in a white mist.'<br />
<br />
Mike, Cassii's mom, and Rachael agreed on that. Cassii sighed and took on step. Then a second step in which everything blurred. And finally a third in which the blur stopped and the mirror of Gill's office. She was just in time to hear the end of the conversation the occupants had been having. Stepping out of the window of Gill's office she said, &quot;I may be able to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian turned around and let out a roar. He then grabbed Cassii by her face and lifted her in the air then brought her down onto the floor very hard causing her to shatter. &quot;What did you do that for?&quot; Gill just about shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was a wolf and she came out of the window,&quot; Brian said. &quot;Looks like they can use any reflective surface. Doesn't matter now that she's dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian had spoken too soon since Cassii's shattered body reassembled itself as did Cindii's body. Once both were reassembled and the cracks had vanished they said together, &quot;You know that hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian's eyes widened in shock as he said, &quot;You should be dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She can't die like that,&quot; Gill said, &quot;and she isn't part of Jensen's pack. She's been this way for four years now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's a friend,&quot; Madam Serenity said. &quot;She is only one of a few whose lives improved because of the curse but it came back to bite her three months ago. Her mother and brothers were transformed into her clothes and her sister was transformed into that doll.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So be nice to her,&quot; Gill said with a hint of a threat in his voice. &quot;Now what brings you here Cassii, Cindii?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll tell you later Gill,&quot; Cassii promised. &quot;Right now I think I can help you. If you can tell me where this Jensen is I can go get him and bring him to you. I'll keep him in the mirror world of course,&quot; she added looking at Brian. &quot;That way you can talk without the worry of them trying to kill each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He needs to die,&quot; Felicity said in a low tone full of menace.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's an innocent person in this,&quot; Madam Serenity said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides if you kill him you'll be charged with murder Mrs. Hardy,&quot; Cassii said.<br />
<br />
Felicity looked shocked and said, &quot;You can't be the Cassii that Mary has played with so often.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassii smiled and shifted back to her human form saying, &quot;It is me Mrs. Hardy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian's eyes got even bigger in his shock and said, &quot;We thought you had moved Cassii.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I did Mr. Hardy,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;Though it wasn't by choice. After Mommy was transformed into this dress, my brothers into my bra and panties, and Cindii into a doll I had to be placed with a foster family. We'll have enough time to catch up later though. Right now I could help. If you know where this Jensen is I can get him for a meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's taken over the Smith estate,&quot; Madam Serenity said. &quot;He may not be there though since his pack seems to be able to travel in the mirror world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if I don't catch him there I can sniff out where he went if he's traveling through the mirror world,&quot; Cassii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you do bring him bring his alpha female too,&quot; Serenity said. &quot;Tell them that I want to talk to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know where we'll be?&quot; Gill asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Cassii said shifting into her glass wolf pup form. She looked at Cindii and said, &quot;I may need both of my hands so you'll need to stay here Cindii.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course sis,&quot; Cindii said. &quot;You be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't have much to fear,&quot; Cassii said laughing and jumped into the window then disappeared from view.<br />
<br />
Brian had to admit that she didn't have much to worry about.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
At the mansion Jensen was getting the pack together to evacuate. He had already sent the pups ahead along with Martha and Mr. P. Alice, Abby, and Samantha had gotten every one else to the safety of the island. The shadows and grotesques were staying here. Now the only ones that were left was himself, Kaylee, Darla, Fran, and Julie. The little ones came back and pulled them through the mirror. Kaylee looked back and sighed saying, &quot;I hope we can come back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure we'll be able to love,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;It'll just be a matter of time. We need to go now though.&quot; Before they could move however a figure blurred into the room with them. After a little yelp of surprise Jensen asked, &quot;Who are you? How are you able to be here? And how come you look like a member of my pack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Cassii though you may remember me as Rick Jennifer,&quot; Cassii said smiling.<br />
<br />
Jensen rummaged through his memory trying to think of who Rick could be. After a moment he said, &quot;I don't remember anyone named Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I only helped you with your school work for a year five years ago,&quot; Cassii said rolling her eyes. &quot;You also had me dress up as a cheerleader quite a few times.&quot;<br />
<br />
It clicked with Jensen then and he said, &quot;I remember now. How could I forget? You were about the only servant that I liked since you never told me I was spoiled and you were such a good sport when we dressed you up as a cheerleader. I remember when you said you were moving on to something else. I was sad that day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you can see why I had to leave,&quot; Cassii said with a little frown. &quot;I was starting a new life. And I was sad too since I had fun with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you doing here?&quot; Jensen asked. &quot;You seem to have the same power as three of my pups.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I came here to invite you and your alpha female to a talk with Madam Serenity,&quot; Cassii said.<br />
<br />
Jensen's heart started pounding wildly. Trying to keep the fear he was feeling out of his voice he said, &quot;I won't talk with her. She's tried to break up my family and she has a couple of lions with her now. It's not a good idea for me to go talk to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won't need to worry about Mr. and Mrs. Hardy,&quot; Cassii said with conviction. &quot;We'll stay in the mirror world so they won't be able to harm you. Mr. Hardy shattered me when I emerged because he thought I was a part of your pack so I have a good idea of how he'll react if I take you out of the mirror world around him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He shattered you,&quot; Jensen said angrily. &quot;He shattered one of my pups.&quot; He realized what he said just a second later. He had called Cassii one of his pups. But she was transformed four years ago so how could she be one of his?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well since I got here I've had this urge to call you Daddy,&quot; Cassii admitted. &quot;We'll figure out why later. Right now will you talk with Madam Serenity?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen had to think about that for a bit. If they remained in the mirror world they would be safe. Of course they might have created someone that can enter the mirror world by now. Maybe he should bring Alice along just in case. Of course that depends on if he goes. And could he subject Kaylee to possible danger?</p>
