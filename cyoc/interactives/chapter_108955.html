<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jack didn&#39;t let his new pet go right away after waking up. Nor did he undo the gag.<br />
<br />
He patted Oliver gently and caressingly as they lay in the little lawn. The spoon was still on the brick path. Jack picked it up. Oliver watched it skeptically, but didn&#39;t protest when Jack gently placed it on the boys thy and slowly dragged it up along the boys body, though he did moan threw the cloth in his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Having fun?” Oliver nodded, eyes closed, just feeling the metal move along him. At certain points on his body, Oliver would gasp or give a particularly pleasurable whine. Even still, Oliver covered his privets shyly with his hands.<br />
<br />
Jack wanted to see what happened if he moved the spoon down there, but first he wanted to test something. With interest, he held the spoon to Oliver&#39;s throat. Oliver&#39;s eyes opened wide and a look that reminded Jack of an orgasm came across him, though no noise escaped his gagged lips.<br />
<br />
Jack lifted the spoon and undid the gag. “Did it hurt?” he asked worried. Oliver tried to come up with a way to describe the sensation.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Master. But, not in a painful way. I think. I don&#39;t know. It was as if suddenly electricity was shooting threw my entire body. Along every part of me. Felt as though I was suddenly laying in silver. I couldn&#39;t move at all. And I couldn&#39;t speak. Not even make noise at all.”<br />
<br />
“How interesting.” Jack said with an evil smile, and placed the spoon back on Oliver&#39;s throat without warning. Oliver&#39;s body went limp all at once. An astonished cry died in the boy&#39;s paralyzed throat. Jack made sure that Oliver was still able to breath before going to work. He didn&#39;t need to hold the spoon there. It lay quite peacefully where it was. He lifted away Oliver&#39;s hands to reveal all of the younger boy.<br />
<br />
Oliver was still able to make expressions and to blush wildly even in this situation. Jack gently stroked the teen&#39;s shaft. Oliver&#39;s eyes rolled back into his head as he started to drool. Jack leaned over his pet.<br />
<br />
“Can you still understand me? Blink twice for yes and once for no.”<br />
<br />
“Blink, blink.”<br />
<br />
“I take it you can still feel.”<br />
<br />
“Blink, blink.”<br />
<br />
“Do you feel normally?”<br />
<br />
“Blink.”<br />
<br />
“Is it numb?”<br />
<br />
“Blink.”<br />
<br />
“Is it more intense?”<br />
<br />
“Blink, blink, blink, blink.”<br />
<br />
“A definite yes.” Jack relished this. “I&#39;m going to have fun with you.”<br />
<br />
“Blink, blink.” Jack set to work. Man&#39;s best friend indeed. Around the time when he started to use his tongue, Oliver fainted from shear overwhelming stimulation. Jack couldn&#39;t imagine how that had felt for Oliver. Next time, he&#39;d have to learn how to keep his pet just at the brink of insanity without being allowed to escape into unconsciousness.<br />
<br />
They spent most of the day experimenting. That is, Jack experimented on Oliver. Both conscious and unconscious. One of the most notable discoveries was that in addition to making Oliver paralyzed and extra sensitive, silver also made it ironically impossible for him to have an orgasm. It drove the boy crazy and when he was able, he would continually beg and promise to do anything Jack wanted of him, if only Jack would allow him to cum. Jack loved leaning in and whispering “no” into the boy&#39;s ear before edging him yet again.<br />
<br />
Another fun place to touch the silver to, Jack discovered, was the back of Oliver&#39;s neck. Taping it in place there left the boy just as paralyzed and sensitive as when it was on his throat. Except that when it was only on Oliver&#39;s spine, Jack could listen to Oliver beg and moan and cry and scream with frustration. It got so bad that Jack had to carry his paralyzed and desperate pet back into the house to avoid letting the entire neighborhood know what a horny slut he&#39;d turned Oliver into.<br />
<br />
Placing the silver on Oliver&#39;s sweet spots, such as either of his nipples, his cock, taint, balls or ass got violently spamming fits to the boy, who&#39;d scream for him to never put him through that again. Except that only five minutes later Oliver would beg Jack to do it to him again.<br />
<br />
But perhaps the strangest reaction to the silver was what happened when Jack put the spoon to Oliver&#39;s forehead. Oliver&#39;s whole body went limp and even his eyes glossed over. Worried that he&#39;d gone too far, Jack had pulled the spoon back and the wolf boy had started right up again in an instant. Not even realizing that he&#39;d been switched off. Jack tried it several times, and even when he took a half hour break, leaving the spoon on Oliver&#39;s forehead until he came back, Oliver hadn&#39;t even noticed the passage of time.<br />
<br />
A slave that he could literally switch on and off whenever he had use for it gave Jack quite a few dirty ideas. For now, he didn&#39;t even let the boy know about his own off switch. Jack wished he had more silver to try things with. He would definitely get some more later.<br />
<br />
Oliver was standing on shaky legs, drenched in sweat and completely exhausted by the time Jack had let him have his orgasm. And then he had made him cum four times in a row. Without the silver to silence him, the boy and cried out with as much passion as Jack had filled him with over the last few hours.<br />
<br />
After the third orgasm, Jack had to hold Oliver down forcefully and he continued to masterbate him. Oliver had cried and begged that his dick was too sensitive and that he couldn&#39;t for nearly ten minutes, but just as Jack knew he would, Oliver came a forth time. Part of him wanted to make Oliver cum a fifth time even, but he decided to wait with that.<br />
<br />
“Tyou should take a shower and head home before it becomes too late. Your parents are probably worrying for you.”<br />
<br />
“Let them worry.” Oliver said rebelliously. “You own me now.” It was such a cute statement coming from him. Jack patted him on the head.<br />
<br />
“You sure do.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll come back as soon as I can,” Oliver promised. “Though I might be grounded for a while.”<br />
<br />
“What will you tell them?” Jack asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, not what you did with me, of course. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll tell them anything about you. I don&#39;t want them to know where it is I run away to when I run away, but I will have a talk with them about the hole werewolf thing.”<br />
<br />
“Does it bother you that your a werewolf?” Jack asked.<br />
<br />
“Actually, I think it&#39;s more worrisome that I might be gay. Not that I regret anything,” he added quickly.<br />
<br />
“That you might be gay? You still not sure?”<br />
<br />
“Okay, I am gay. Alright, but only for you.”<br />
<br />
“Dear god, that was a cheesy line,” Jack teased.<br />
<br />
“Fuck you,” Oliver said. Jacked pulled him in closer and kissed him for the hundredth time that day. Their kisses were a lot better now, yet somehow, Oliver managed to make it feel like the first time every time. His knees wobbled as Jacks tong invaded and explored his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Good luck.” Jack said as his pet left to shower and go home.</p>
