<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily turned around, ready to get dressed as soon as possible. Her brief boost in conviction soon faltered, as she saw Olivia -- or rather Oliver -- sitting there with a wide smile, complementing his chiseled jawline clad with subtle stubble. One of his large, burly hands was placed comfortably beside his crotch, drawing Emily to it -- already erect again. She glanced at it with a gulp. He must have been looking at her nude, cum-filled ass sashaying to the bathroom and hallway doors and her massive tits swaying on the way back. How else get so hard so fast? So...hard...her sexy husband&#39;s veiny...thick...<br />
<br />
Ugh, what the hell was wrong with her? Why did she find her former mom so attractive? Hormones and the thrill of sex getting the best of her? Making some kind of mistake with the awareness having her partly think of Olivia as her husband? Some twisted, fucked-up kink? A mix of these? Emily didn&#39;t know, but it made her incredibly uncomfortable. She looked away as she moved to the other side of the room towards a door that led to the closet. At the very least, that&#39;s what her instinct told her. As she passed by the bed, she was now able to feel Oliver&#39;s eyes locked on her. They shifted from her jiggly breasts down to her bouncing butt. She tried not to pay attention to it, but it was impossible -- especially as she felt his seed continue dripping out of her. A few steps left...<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess you changed your mind, huh, hon?&quot; The mom-turned-man cooed. Emily shuddered and stopped. His voice was as gruff as his copious chest hair implied. It was a baritone -- even deeper than his dick went into her ass. It was so masculine, even more than her former father Paul&#39;s. Not to mention being so confident...self-assured...commanding. Such a brief few words showed Oliver&#39;s dominance wasn&#39;t just in bed. Emily said nothing...what could she do to make this any less awkward? Nothing. All she did was move faster than before, arms held tightly to her sides, hands clenched, and tear ducts barely held at bay as tightening her body forced a load of semen out onto the carpet.<br />
<br />
The floodgates burst open as soon as she closed the door behind her, falling to her knees. She tried to stifle her cries, knowing how easy they would be to hear so close by. Why had she done all of this? Trying role swapping, turning off Rick&#39;s awareness, using the camera so haphazardly...hell, even buying the camera in the first place! This could have been entirely avoided if she stopped to think things through. Just a little bit! Then she wouldn&#39;t have...Emily shook her head. No...don&#39;t focus on those thoughts for too long. Both for her own sanity and for the greater good. She needed to find Rick and at least work towards fixing this mess. Standing up, Emily refocused herself, now able to observe this area around her. <br />
<br />
As expected of a mansion, the closet was absolutely massive, big enough to act as a living quarters if it was redesigned as such. The clothing did well to match: dresses, skirts, blouses, jeans, jackets, heels, handbags, bras, panties. All of different styles and colors! There were also half a dozen mirrors all positioned in such a way to give the perfect angle of whatever she wore. Even in her current mental state, Emily gawked at the display. Frankly, it was more than she ever needed in her lifetime. In any case, really any clothes would do right now. <br />
<br />
First, she took out a pair of panties that looked a little less fancy than the rest before wiping away her tears. She was a wreck, but she at least felt like she should be a somewhat presentable wreck. That led her to her ass, where she began wiping off whatever of Oliver&#39;s was left there. Having to force out some of the cum that was deeper in her by clenching made her wince and nearly break down again. Somehow, she was able to keep control. After what seemed like forever, she felt clean enough there, tossing the rag to the side out of sight. She didn&#39;t dare want a full picture of how stained it was.<br />
<br />
Actually dressing herself was a simpler process, grabbing a pair of red cotton panties, gray sweatpants, and a red blouse to match her underwear. She didn&#39;t bother spending the time putting a bra on, deciding to deal with her jugs bouncing around in the time it took for her to spot her former boyfriend. Still, they were heavier than she initially realized. Were they really that much bigger than she was normally? She pushed them up from below for a few seconds, judging that they were indeed massive compared to her normal self. Maybe part of it was getting used to her young teenage form&#39;s flat chest too. A glance in the mirrors. Her face was a bit red, and pants a bit baggier than she liked. Good enough. After a few deep breaths to prepare herself for what was on the other side, she opened the door. <br />
<br />
Oliver wasn&#39;t there. <br />
<br />
Emily let out a massive sigh of relief. He must have been changing in his own closet. She finally had a stroke of luck. Stroke...she&#39;d do the same to his juicy member...ugh, no! Get out and take advantage of this chance. That&#39;s what Emily repeated to herself as she jogged away from the master bedroom off to find her &#39;daughter&#39; and the camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rebecca? Rebecca, where are you?&quot; Emily shouted, using Rick&#39;s reality changed name under the assumption he was still unaware. She expected her search to go on for as long as it took to find the master bedroom. She was mistaken. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Rebecca had heard the shouting very quickly. She was used to it. Sometimes one of the servants relayed the message to her, but most times she heard her mom&#39;s boisterous tones from halfway across the mansion. The girl parted her maroon hair to the side, rolling her eyes as she placed her bright pink phone on her bright pink bed. Her mom was, like, sooooo annoying sometimes, taking time away from texting her besties. Rebecca sashayed out of the room with poise befitting a daddy&#39;s princess, complementing her gold top and purple skirt. She knew she was still relatively young and not truly &#39;mature&#39; but damned if she wasn&#39;t going to try to uphold her status as the daughter of a rich family! &quot;Yeeeeeah! I&#39;m, like, right here!&quot; She shouted back, looking around for Emily without any urgency. She was probably just going to ask something inane, like how she did on a recent test or something.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, Rebecca had to question if she was really living the life her friends said was straight out of TV. Today had to be the biggest case of her questioning that as she saw her mom darting towards her. She knew her parents liked to be pretty casual compared to what she expected of people as wealthy as them, but this was just ridiculous! No make-up, no bra, hair unkempt...she barely looked like her mom at all! The teen couldn&#39;t hide her -- to be frank -- disgust, placing a hand on her hip with clear judgment. Emily either didn&#39;t notice or care, much to Rebecca&#39;s further annoyance. <br />
<br />
&quot;R-Ri-Rebecca...&quot; The MILF sputtered out. &quot;Do you have the...a camera?&quot; <br />
<br />
The adolescent rolled her eyes again. &quot;Um, yeah? On my phone, like, all cameras?&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman&#39;s sweat was clear to see on her face. &quot;N-No, I mean, an old looking camera. It&#39;s like a box? It was near Oli...&quot; A longer pause with a gulp first breaking the silence, &quot;...our room?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seriously, what was up with her mom? An old camera? Why was she so freaked out about something like that? Maybe it was sentimental or something? Rebecca didn&#39;t really get it. &quot;Urm, like, no? Why would I take somethin&#39; like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s already strained expression shattered as her face went from a bright red to a sickly white. She grasped onto her child&#39;s shoulders, her face scrunched up in a way Rebecca never even knew existed. If she had to gather, it was a mix of anger and fear plastered on her face. &quot;What do you mean you don&#39;t have it!? Please tell me you&#39;re joking! This is really, really important. Please, Rick...R-Rebecca.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was insane, even by her mom&#39;s typical standards. To be honest, it was making Rebecca really uncomfortable...she had to say something to at least get off her back for now. &quot;Like, I dunno, Mom! Maybe Jim took it to storage or somethin&#39;. Or, like, Pauline is dustin&#39; it off!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Emily let out a small sigh, some color returning to her face. &quot;Okay...okay, okay. I&#39;ll go check...just...tell me if you find something like that, okay? Please?&quot; Before her spoiled child spoke another sound, Emily ran out of sight.</p>
