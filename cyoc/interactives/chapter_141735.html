<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While they waited, Curt kept an eye on the ray gun as the maid counter suddenly started to pick up. It was only about one or two a second, so he flicked open the profile menu and started watching the most recent. The first three noted that they were recently statues owned by Myra as inanimate objects and humans before that, two of them not being mythics kind of surprised him, but he suspected that wouldn&#39;t last.<br />
<br />
The next set shared Skyla&#39;s family name, and a few other shared family names of Kitsunes. He took a look at some of their profiles. Many had the distinction of being ret-conned in, some starting as female, but just as many seemed to be ret-coned in as male sons or husbands of existing family members only to become maids themselves moments later; the profiles helpfully noting some of these anomalies, as well as whether they were aware or not, with many of the &#39;valid targets&#39; being unaware, while those that shouldn&#39;t have been possible were aware.<br />
<br />
&quot;Skyla... Your family is... Slowly growing,&quot; Curt said, seeing <br />
<br />
Skyla tilted her head. &quot;I... Would have thought they&#39;d all happen at once if it works like the splash mode... Maybe there&#39;s a safety feature to limit how many are effected at once, or maybe the storm just works differently than the ray gun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the splash mode does say one can define how far down the family it effects, so maybe its just getting bottlenecked by how many each person considers part of their family,&quot; Curt said.<br />
<br />
A new batch of maids started showing up, and then another, speeding up...<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
A young couple strode out of the arcade after playing a long co-op beat &#39;em up. The girl looking almost as boyish as the boy, both of them having short hair, hers being black, and his being brown, both being relatively slender and looking more agile than muscular.<br />
<br />
The two gave a fist bump after what was to them was probably the best night, yet standing in the middle of the rain their arms suddenly squished together like wet clay, and shortly found their shoulders fusing together, and down their sides, leaving the boy on the right and the girl on the left; between them trying to pull each other apart, and their middle legs suddenly reshaping into a tail, their balance failed, and they fell forward hands first into a puddle, in time to see them reshape with their thumbs shrinking away, and being covered in scales.<br />
<br />
Their clothes seemed to melt away briefly, allowing a small pair of wings to emerge; only for their clothes to reshape into a dress similar to one of the fighters from one of their fighting games. Then, it seemed like their necks began to stretch, but as a feeling of vertigo came over them as it seemed like the ground was actually coming closer to them.<br />
<br />
The two tried to back away, only to wind up drenched in the stormwater as they backpedalled, it previously would have been up to their ankles, but they were forced to swim out of it, which for an uncoordinated two headed dragon wasn&#39;t exactly easy. Just as they crawled over the edge of the curb, they felt some part of their clothes puff up around their hindquarters as they ducked back into the arcade.<br />
<br />
Somewhat startled by this seemingly random turn of events, they looked into the shiny metal side of an arcade machine. The former boy&#39;s head being covered in deep blue scales, while her girlfriend&#39;s were deep red. They shared a pale yellow underside colour which was visible going up their necks, and their last vestige of humanity was their hair; still short yet more than some of the other western dragons had, and the girl&#39;s hair was still black, but the former boy&#39;s had lightened into a bright blonde.<br />
<br />
They didn&#39;t look back at the apparent diaper they&#39;d wound up with. Their small size was enough that they knew they had turned into a baby dragoness.<br />
<br />
The former boy looked downward, somewhat disheartened, only for her girlfriend to lift her face towards her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No matter how bad this seems, I&#39;m still your girlfriend, always,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
The former boy nuzzled her. &quot;I never thought I&#39;d ever be this close to you... Figuratively or otherwise... I just...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll both be the mother of our kids if that&#39;s what you&#39;re worried about,&quot; the girlfriend said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I... Well... Not quite anyways... I just... Who would we agree should be the father?&quot; the blue head said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master Curt maybe?&quot; the red one said, only to look somewhat surprised that she&#39;d called him master.<br />
<br />
The blue head started blushing. &quot;Well... That makes sense... If we&#39;ve suddenly turned into his maids... And he&#39;s a dragon, we&#39;re... One dragon or two?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two chuckled, slowly dawning on them that their appearance might be a pun; only to be interrupted as a bus pulled up outside, covered in tarps, with a sign hanging off the side saying &#39;evacuation bus&#39;.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
 A handful of people were sitting around a table in a game store, having taken a break from playing a fantasy roleplaying game. There was an outgoing boy who played the party&#39;s sorcerer, a shy nerdy girl who played the party artificer but usually played a wizard, a bearded older man who played the party&#39;s druid, a career woman played the paladin, and a edgy teenager in all black played the party rogue.<br />
<br />
The light above them flicked above them as another lightning bolt struck, and soon the light burst and they were plunged into darkness, the group all tingling with ambient energy from the bulb&#39;s sudden self destruction.<br />
<br />
Their bodies were suddenly pulled under the table as their legs began to fuse together, they tried to grab something to pull themselves away, but only ended up grabbing onto each others arms with went the same way as their legs, and finally their body. As they squirmed they ended up accidentally flipping the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone just stop,&quot; the would be sorcerer cried out, his voice cracking as it became more feminine and he felt his neck elongate, &quot;let&#39;s just... Try to see what we&#39;ve got ourselves into.&quot;<br />
<br />
The former boy who played a sorcerer tried something on a hunch, squeezing eyes shut and visualizing a ball of light. With a flash and a sound like a fire being lit, a glowing mote floated above them, and they looked over themselves, seeing five different coloured draconic heads extending out of a single body wearing a maid dress. Tentatively, they started trying to stand, and after some wobbling, they stood, finding their natural stance to be on all fours, with a large pair of breasts jutting out in front of them. Their body itself was coppery, with a quick look down their dress showing an ash grey on their underbelly<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... I&#39;m not sure if our old names are appropriate anymore, so let&#39;s sound off with our character classes,&quot; the red dragon head in the centre said, &quot;I played Sorcerer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Artificer,&quot; the blue head to the left of her said.<br />
&quot;Paladin,&quot; the white head to her right said.<br />
&quot;Druid,&quot; the green one on the far left said.<br />
&quot;Rogue,&quot; said the black one on the far right.<br />
&quot;Game Master&quot; called a girl&#39;s voice from across the room.<br />
<br />
They all turned and saw a cute little dragoness standing on all fours just like them, who&#39;s scales shone like silver; but she didn&#39;t have the same mohawk like frills as the &#39;silver dragon&#39; they were more acquainted with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weren&#39;t you always a platinum dragon though?&quot; the sorceress red head asked.<br />
<br />
The shiny dragon shook her head. &quot;No, I was a guy before... I got a small shock when I touched the mirror in the bathroom, and then suddenly I looked like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other heads all looked at the red head, who just sighed. &quot;Well, having ourselves turn into a multi-headed dragon is already pretty unbelievable, and yet it just happened. So I&#39;m ready to believe anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other dragoness smiled. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment, they heard their phones make their message tone. &quot;Oh, no,&quot; the would be rogue said sarcastically, &quot;manipulating a tiny device with hands not built for it, my one weakness,&quot; she said, bringing up the messages, &quot;we just got several hours of messages telling us to evacuate once we can find a transport that&#39;s sheltered from magic, and to use whatever magical material or wards we have to shelter ourselves until them.&quot;<br />
<br />
The red head sighed. &quot;I hope we inherited our character&#39;s abilities, because otherwise this will be a pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Three of the teachers at Simone&#39;s school were looking out over the school as everyone else was trying to get everyone ready to evacuate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its weird, when I came in this morning, I could have sworn that only Simone was a dragon, now it feels like half the school is turning into dragons,&quot; the librarian said, toying with one of the bangs in her hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought they were already like that,&quot; the P.E. teacher said, crossing his arms, &quot;but that does make sense, if they&#39;re all practically babies in a physical sense, its not like they&#39;re old enough for the same fitness classes as the rest, so why is my schedule organized by class rather than grade? At least with grade, we&#39;d be able to scrape together enough for a full class, but as it stands half my fitness classes are practically empty.&quot;<br />
<br />
The third was a substitute teacher, his shirt was unbuttoned at the top, and he was looking into a classroom on the opposite side of the school. &quot;They&#39;re definitely changing, I can see some of them changing before my own eyes every time the thunder roars... Not sure why dragons though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, a bolt of lightning struck the stonework just outside their window, and the three of them tripped over each other. The substitute winding up beneath the other two as they sat on top of him. Before he could get out from under them, he suddenly felt his arms fusing into his sides.<br />
<br />
He looked back at the other two, white fur growing over their bodies as their clothes tore themselves apart and dissipated into the air, leaving particles circling them. He looked down, and saw their legs has already fused together, the P.E. teacher&#39;s side having a paw, while the Librarian&#39;s side had a cloven hoof. Between the two, their sides seemed to be coming together like a zipper from the bottom, each loosing an arm in the process.<br />
<br />
The substitute looked over his own body, being covered in ashen scales and connecting itself to the base of the other two&#39;s shared spine. He blushed, realizing just how intimately he&#39;s going to be stuck with them, even as he watches himself cease to be a &#39;he&#39;.<br />
<br />
The newly minted she snake flinched as what remained of their clothes flew at them, and as she opened her eyes; she looked at herself and found all of her body bellow her head wrapped in a tube of cloth with a little flair halfway down her body that imitated the skirt of a maid&#39;s dress. Surprising her, on her body was a tiny pair of breasts poking out of the fabric, something that almost made her chuckle, but it came out more as a hiss.<br />
<br />
looking back over, the other two found themselves stuck on all fours, trying to stand back up on two but were having difficulty. Able to look back underneath them, she could see that they had cute little breasts of their own; and raising herself up, she could see the back of the other two&#39;s heads behind a pair of batlike wings, the P.E. Teacher on the right supposedly having the head of a white lioness, but she looked cuter, more like a house-cat; while the Librarian&#39;s head that was supposed to be that of a goat looked more to her like a horned sheep as it was less scruffy, and somewhat softer looking.<br />
<br />
She blushed when she realized she&#39;s got the perfect view of their panties... Her panties too she corrected herself, she&#39;s just a part of them, not even able to act independently.<br />
<br />
Her blush intensified as she realized she&#39;s now a very different type of &#39;sub&#39; than she was before. No longer a substitute, but something... More scandalous.<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;... I didn&#39;t think something like that was even possible,&quot; Curt said.<br />
<br />
&#39;I can&#39;t see what you guys are talking about, what am I missing out on?&#39; Simone thought at them from within her egg.<br />
<br />
Curt looked down at her egg and rubbed at it. &quot;How much have you figured out already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well... You sound like you&#39;re talking about people changing into different things due to the storm... And yet the same vison that told me you&#39;re... Somewhat responsible for me being.... myself I guess.&#39;<br />
<br />
Curt rubbed at the egg as if to make a nodding motion she could see. &quot;The two are related... I could say this storm is partly my fault, or partly the fault of those who ran off with the tool I use to change people... But no one person deserves blame here. But more to the point, I never really wanted to expected it to happen to this many people... I just wanted people who wanted to be something other than human to be happy... My friends and my family mostly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curt could feel Simone trying to nuzzle his hand through the egg. &#39;Then... I want to say something that... In another world I might not have gotten the chance to say... Thank you for helping me be myself.&#39;<br />
<br />
Curt hugged her egg closer, the others in the cabin looking on and admiring the tender moment, even as the storm raged outside.</p>
