<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The trip just got worse for Mark. She had to sit with and comfort a little girl in glasses called Alice whom Heather thought was suffering separation anxiety. Mark found out the hard way that Alice was suffering from motion sickness. Alice vomited on Marks lap. At least the bus driver stopped and from somewhere produced wipes and with Heather&#39;s help Mark was able to clean herself up. However for the remainder of the three hour trip she could smell herself.<br />
<br />
Mark also had to endure 20 pre-teen girls continuously screaming or screeching. Their voices were just so high and Mark&#39;s or as everyone else thought of her &quot;Anna&quot;, ears were beginning to hurt. Heather suggested a sing-a-long. Anna had a very good singing voice so it was expected that Mark would lead the singing. Mark may have inherited Anna&#39;s lovely voice but she had not inherited Anna&#39;s knowledge of lyrics. Heather gave Mark a weird look when she started singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;. It was about the only song Mark knew. Luckily some of the younger girls seemed to like singing and sang some other songs. Mark picked up on the relatively simple lyrics and joined in. Secretly Mark loved the tones coming out of her throat. Previously he had zero singing ability. <br />
<br />
In the other bus the real Anna was having a much better time. &quot;Jennifer&quot; had been enrolled as junior counsellor for 3 weeks but on the bus with her were two other 17 year old &quot;Counsellors&quot; Kate and Abby, both were friends of Anna&#39;s but did not recognise her in Jennifer&#39;s body. Between the 3 of them they had to watch over seventeen 14 to 16 old girls. None of their charges had separation anxiety or motion sickness. &quot;Jennifer&quot; enjoyed a pleasant bus ride getting to know the girls.<br />
<br />
It was a 4 hour bus trip to the camp. Mark&#39;s bus was late to the 2 hour rest stop thanks to Alice vomiting a second time. At least this time it wasn&#39;t over Mark. However they had to stop in the middle of nowhere while the seat was cleaned up. When they finally arrived at the rest stop the other bus had already left. As they were running late there was no time for anything but running all the girls through the rest rooms. Mark needed to go herself but by the time she had finished, the coffee that Heather had bought her was cold.<br />
<br />
Mark was very relieved when they finally arrived at the camp just in time for lunch. Anna had mentioned to him that the camp had been undergoing a renovation. As they drove through gates Mark observed a new swimming pool and a new tennis/basketball  complex with approval. He saw some girls apparently from a different town, walking around what appeared to be a brand new building. That must be the new accommodation block Anna had spoken about.<br />
<br />
As they were running late they ushered the young girls off the bus straight into the canteen, where a meal was waiting for them. This was in the older part of the complex. To Mark it looked like this area had not been renovated in 50 years - it was due.<br />
<br />
The meal was nice but Mark was unable to sit with Anna. Anna was already eating at another table and by the time Mark had got his charges seated all the seats at &quot;Jennifer&#39;s&quot; table were taken. Mark sat beside Alice as no-one else would sit beside her - She heard someone behind her warn someone else away from the two of them &#39;Don&#39;t sit there. They stink&#39;<br />
<br />
Whilst they were eating their luggage was somehow delivered to the dormitories. The older girls were housed in the new building. They had 4 girls to a room each room having it&#39;s own bathroom. &quot;Jennifer&quot; was in a room with Kate and Abby. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Mark, the younger girls were still accommodated in the old complex. They were all in bunks in one big room. There was a bed in a small room at the front of the building but that was for Heather. Mark found the name &quot;Anna King&quot; on a lower bunk in the middle of the room. All of them had the share an ablution block with another dormitory of young girls from somewhere else.<br />
<br />
Heather took pity on the girl she thought was &quot;Anna&quot;. She told Mark to have a shower and change while she took the young charges down to the hall where they were to be introduced to the activity coordinators. Heather also told &quot;Anna&quot; that she could utilise one of the wardrobes in her little room to store her belongings. Mark was very relieved when Heather and the girls departed and she finally had a moment to herself.<br />
<br />
Anna had packed two suitcases. Mark struggled to lift them onto the bed, she had lost the muscles that &quot;he&#39; had been so proud of. Once more she regretted agreeing to this charade. <br />
<br />
Mark opened the first bag to find an assortment of items; a hair dryer, a make-up kit, other bottles she didn&#39;t recognise, shoes, underwear, nighties and two pairs of bikini&#39;s. She noticed that much of the underwear still had tags on it and consisted of colored bra and panty sets.  These must have been the purchases Anna had made when she went shopping with Mrs K last week.<br />
<br />
In the second suitcase, found neatly folded and wrapped clothing that Anna had packed. In one of the bags Mark found what she had been looking for - jeans and shorts. She did wonder why Anna had packed the fancy long red sequinned dress she could remember Anna wearing at the end of year school dance. Anna had looked gorgeous in that dress. Anyhow Heather had warned her to hurry so she grabbed some blue jeans and a plain white t-shirt and went to have a shower. <br />
<br />
The showers in the ablutions block were pretty simple but at least for the moment the water was hot. For the second time that day Mark enjoyed the sensation of water cascading over a female body. This time she didn&#39;t wash Anna&#39;s hair. Alice&#39;s vomit had not touched her hair.<br />
<br />
As quickly as she could, she dressed. Anna&#39;s jeans were ridiculously tight. Her vacant crotch became oh so obvious. The t-shirt also did nothing to hide her curves. Once dressed she hurried off to the hall where by this time everyone else was congregated. She regretted not changing the shoes she was wearing as well. It was hard to run in Anna&#39;s heels.</p>
