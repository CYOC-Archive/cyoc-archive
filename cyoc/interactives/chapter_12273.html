<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The electric wave passed through Mark and he felt his 115 pound body gaining mass.  He also saw himself gaining body hair on his chest and legs, dark hair.  That ruled out his becoming either Tony or Jack.  He saw Jack next to him turning into Eric so he knew he'd be Jeff.  This was a fairly pleasant prospect for Mark.  Jeff was 6'1&quot; tall and weighed around 200 pounds.  He had more fat to him than Mark would've liked, but it was still a good body.  It was in this cheerful mood of acceptance that MarkasJeff heard Eric, now in his former 115 pound body grousing over and over about being stuck like that.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps emboldened by his new size, or somehow taking up Jeff's typical commanding stance, MarkasJeff went over to hand told him to shut the hell up and that just as he'd demanded that Jack, now in his body, do his best at football, Eric had better do his best in Mark's body at ballet.<br />
<br />
That had shut the former porker right up.  It wasn't long before the meeting broke up and they all went to their new respective homes.  MarkasJeff split up from TonyasJack and JackasEric.  But he realized walking up the front walk to Jeff's house that he knew very little about Jeff's family.  He knew Jeff had an older sister and a younger sister and -ugh- he remembered Jeff's younger brother Richie.  In the 6 weeks time that Mark had taken ballet class, he'd only gotten trouble about it once.  He was leaving the studio particularly late, after 8 pm and had just stepped outside when 3 boys bigger than him had pushed him up against a wall with a seris of laughing jokes.  The next thing he knew, they had picked him up and sat him atop the opening of a high but slender trash barrel.  He could still picture Richie laughing hysterically as he gave a firm push to his midsection and trapped Mark in the trash can with his rear almost on the bottom and only the top of his head and tips of his toes showing over the top.  &quot;Hey you're one flexible little fruit, aren't you?&quot; Richie had said before mussing Mark's hair and then running off.  Mark had had to stay there in the trash can for nearly a half hour before the dance teacher walked out of the building and he was able to shout for her attention.<br />
<br />
With Jeff's memories available to him, he was able to recall knowledge of Richie having done similar things and worse to many other kids.  He could now recall knowledge of Richie being caught by the police breaking into someone else's home and being cruel toward someone's cat.  In fact, Jeff's parents had sent Richie away to military school as a last resort for dealing with him.  So, it was no surprise that when MarkasJeff bounded through the door announcing &quot;I'm home&quot; that he saw Richie in a white shirt and his striped military school pants drinking a coke.<br />
&quot;Hey big bro&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey little bastard&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh . . sorry.  I meant Little bro&quot; said MarkasJeff with a laugh.  Richie laughed too.  As Mark knew from Jeff's memories, he and Richie were friendly but played rough.  And MarkasJeff was more than willing to play rough with Richie.  In the first couple days, he really pressed his size advantage.  Though almost 6 feet tall, Richie weighed around 160 pounds to MarkasJeff's 200.  Mark enthusiastically wrestled Richie, pinning him to the floor and rubbing his face into the carpet.  At first, Richie was defensive, but starting around the third day, Richie started to constantly assume a smirk.  This was the Richie that Mark had known.  And MarkasJeff didn't have all that much contact with him while he was home from military school for the week, but any time he saw Richie over the last half of that period, Richie was smirking at him, be it at dinner or watching tv with the rest of the family. Mark started to wonder if Richie knew something.  But that was silly paranoia.  Richie didn't know anything.  They shared a bedroom but the chronivac was no longer in it.  It was back in Tony's room at the St. Martin house.  He supposed that Richie adopted that loathsome smirk with everyone, not just kids taking ballet and it had only temporarily been knocked off his pointy face by the way MarkasJeff had worked him over the first couple days.<br />
<br />
So, though a little uneasy at first the presence and then attitude of junior sadist Richie, Mark felt free to enjoy his time with Jeff's family.  It was quite a different experience than what he was used to.  Though there was a little friction from his younger sister, both his sisters clearly loved him.  His new mother doted on him and his father, though a bit distant, was clearly on his side.  Mark did his best in school for Jeff.  Though Jeff was three years ahead of him, he wasn't in honors classes and Mark had no particular trouble getting good marks in the week that he was Jeff in school.  Football practices were hard but sophomore Jeff didn't get to play much.  He was a backup linebacker and special teamer and made two tackles on kickoff and punt coverage in each Friday game.<br />
<br />
Jeff wasn't dating anyone at the time, so Mark didn't have to figure out how to deal with that situation.  He masturbated a few times in the course of the 8 days, half out of curiosity about Jeff's circumcised penis.  The size he achieved did not impress him, but Jeff was always a good guy to him so Mark would not mention that.<br />
<br />
So, though it wasn't without its rough patches, Mark was pretty happy to have tried being Jeff when he stripped and stepped in front of the chronivac on Sunday night.  He felt the elecric wave pass through him and his body started slimming immediately.  He lost Jeff's extra body hair and a few inches height.  He was his 13 year old slender handsome self when something out of place caught his eye.<br />
<br />
The chronivac emitter was glowing golden yellow again and he saw Richie step out of the back of Tony's closet with a laugh and a smirk.<br />
&quot;You guys are mine!&quot;</p>
