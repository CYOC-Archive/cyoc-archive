<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>I found myself in a busy store amid girl's clothing. People were rushing up and down the isle with carts full of food, toys, and clothing. 
They all had thick coats either on or draped over the cart. One man that passed was grumbling about a blizzard so that would explain why 
people were in such a hurry. I had to wonder how I got here though without a coat on. Before I could dwell on it though a woman behind 
me grabbed my arm and said, "Don't you wander off like that again Flutrina. That really scared me." She started pulling me through the 
girl's clothing to the changing rooms. As she handed me some clothes she told me, "Now try these on and let me see each one before you 
take them back off. I need to make sure that they fit you properly." With that she kind of pushed me into the changing room.</p>
<p>I stood staring at the door for a moment. Here I was a grown man and a woman just called me Flutrina and pulled me behind her like I 
was a child. I started to shake my head at the idea when I noticed something odd about the mirror in this changing room. Instead of 
reflecting what I looked like it showed the image of a girl who looked about seven or eight. I raised my hand and the girl in the mirror did 
the same. I was puzzled by this since I wasn't a girl. Then I noticed something strange about the girl. At first she seemed to be a normal 
girl with strawberry blond hair and blue eyes but then there seemed to be a second image over her that started becoming clearer the 
longer I looked at her. Her hair was no longer strawberry blond but pink and her eyes became a mixture of blue and green. Also her ears 
came to a point now. Other than that she stayed the same. "We don't have time for you to be messing around in there Flutrina," the 
woman said through the door causing me to jump a bit. She evidently expected me to try on the clothes but I didn't see how I was 
supposed to do that. I mean I was a grown man and not a young girl. I looked down at the clothes the woman had told me try on but 
something else caught my attention. I was now wearing the clothes that the girl in the mirror was. Instead of my shirt and pants I was now 
wearing a pink dress. Instead of socks I was wearing thick white tights and my shoes had become pink instead of black. I could also feel 
that my underwear had also changed. I looked at the clothes I was supposed to try on and shrugged. There was no way that they would fit 
me but I was going to try anyway. All of them were dresses which meant that I wouldn't need to take my shoes off. Once I had taken the 
dress I was wearing off I noticed that it looked like it was the same size as the others. I was sure that I couldn't fit into any of them but 
when I tried one of the other dresses on I found that it fit perfectly.</p>
<p>It took a little bit to try them all on and for the woman to check them. The strange thing was that every time she did it seemed like I 
shrunk down to the size of a young girl. Finally I had tried them all on and we left the clothing department. As we were the woman said, "I 
wish that your sister would wear dresses and skirts more like you. I just can't see why it's such a big fuss to get her in one."</p>
<p>The scene shifted and I found myself standing in the middle of a field alone as the girl that was in the mirror. I looked around for my 
sister, her friends, or Amy but couldn't find them. I thought for sure that they would be here but they weren't. This gave me a bad feeling 
and I knew I had to search for them. Where do I begin though? I closed my eyes and picking a direction I started heading that way.</p>
<p>Things suddenly shifted and I was standing outside of a cave. There was a faint glow coming from inside and I decided to see what it 
was. It could be my sister and the others after all. But I had to be careful since it could also be trouble. I made my way through carefully 
trying not to disturb any rocks that might be laying on the floor. As I made my way deeper into the cave the glow became brighter. As I 
rounded a corner I was surprised to see the the glow was coming from a white door in the cave wall. I didn't want to go through that door 
but the cave started to shake and pieces of the ceiling started to come down, small at first but getting bigger the longer it went on. Just 
then I heard what I thought was a cave in from the way I had come and from the way leading deeper into the cave. If that was the case 
then I was trapped with nowhere to go but through the door. Rocks where still coming down from the ceiling and I was afraid that it would 
collapse too. I looked at the door and took a deep breath. As I opened it I had to hope that the chamber beyond would be stable and lead 
to a way out.</p>
<p>I was surprised once again when the door led into a white room. In the middle stood two figures but I couldn't make them out. The one 
on the left said, "We've finally found you Flutrina or should it be Richard Plunkett. I am Inari and this is Isis. I wish we had more time to talk 
but you are waking up. We have just enough time to warn you that Beth Milansky isn't your friend." With that the room shook and 
everything shattered.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>I woke with a start and looked around. I was still in the clubhouse and it was clearly morning. Jessica was still resting somewhere in 
my mind so I wouldn't have to worry about her trying to take over for awhile. Looking around I noticed that there was a small restroom and 
I really needed to go so I headed over that way. There was a little camp toilet in there and it was clean to my surprise. I was just about to 
use it when my bladder let go. Jessica had some problems with her bladder at times and my mind coming back didn't change that. With a 
little sigh I took off my panties and nightgown looking about for a way to clean myself. I spotted some baby wipes and taking one out I 
cleaned up the pee on me. Now I needed to find some clothes and I figured I'd have to steal them off a clothesline or something. As it 
turned out there was a dress that looked to be my size in the clubhouse. I didn't want to think about why it would be here but I put it on 
thankful that it was. It was at this point that Jessica decided to wake up and she was very angry at being in a dress with no panties on. 
She felt exposed wearing dresses and skirts anyway and with no panties that feeling was increased. I could feel it and I almost continued 
to look for something different. I stopped though and reasoned that it would be best to wear the dress since people would be looking for 
me wearing a nightgown or possibly a shirt and pants. I did need some footwear though and perhaps some underwear. I did find them but 
the panties that I found were crusted with dried cum. Jessica didn't know what it was but she didn't want to wear them. I didn't want to 
wear them either but it would be better than going without. When I put them on however I though that it might be better to go without since 
they scratched against my genitals which didn't feel good. Jessica was a little calmer though with them on and I figured that I'd find some 
clean panties on a clothesline somewhere or maybe in a donation box. I slipped the sandals on and went out the door.</p>
<p>I stopped short as soon as I walked out since Jessica was panicking. She didn't know where we were. She knew where we should be 
but nothing looked the same to her. I looked back to where the clubhouse should have been but it was gone. I couldn't understand it at first 
but then thought that the clubhouse might have had a door to another place in it like the one I had found in Gregorski's. Well there was no 
helping it now since there was no way back that I could see. Jessica wanted to get someone to help her get back to her daddy but I didn't. 
Things weren't going to go good once Greg got hold of us but I was half tempted to find someone to help us. I could say that I had been 
kidnapped but the. Again I didn't know how far away we were and it might raise some suspicions if we turned up too soon. I looked around 
and saw that I was in a fenced in backyard with no way out other than through the house. Well I suppose I could try climbing the fence but 
it wouldn't be easy.</p>
<p>Before I could attempt to climb the fence though a young woman came out of the house. She smiled at me and said, "Hello there little 
one. You must be lost." I nodded figuring that it would be best to play along. She held out her hand and said, "Well come inside and we'll 
find your mommy and daddy."</p>
<p>I knew I shouldn't do that but there was nowhere else to go and Jessica took over running to the woman which I knew was a bad idea 
but then again there really wasn't another option available at the moment. I would just have to sneak away somehow when we get inside. 
The woman takes my hand and leads me inside.</p>
<p>The house looked like any normal house which should have put me at ease but it didn't. Something seemed to be off though what it 
was I couldn't tell. I started getting worried when she led me down a set of stairs into a finished basement. That didn't make sense to me 
and Jessica was becoming a bit confused as well. It was when the woman opened a secret door behind a bookcase that I became 
frightened as did Jessica. We were both wanted to get away so I kicked the woman as hard as I could. She let me go saying, "You little 
bitch," as I ran toward the stairs.</p>
<p>I should have guessed that it wouldn't be easy to get away since another young woman was coming down the stairs and grabbed me. 
I started kicking and was about to scream when the second woman put her hand over my mouth and squeezed my nose shut so I had to 
breath through my mouth. I couldn't breath through my mouth very well though and my struggles quickly diminished. "Good thing I came 
home early Hun," the second woman said.</p>
<p>The first woman came up and looked me straight in the eye with a pissed off look in her eyes. I thought she was going to hit me but 
she just said, "I was going to make you a part of our family but I won't now." She looked up at the second woman and said, "Bring her 
down."</p>
<p>The second woman half carried half dragged me over to the hidden door and down those stairs. When we got to the bottom I noticed 
there were two suits like the kind they wear in labs with hazardous materials hanging on the wall. Looking to the left and right I could see 
what looked to be airlocks on either side. The first woman put one on and went into the airlock on the left. The second one handed me to 
the first saying, "It's really annoying that we have to wear these suits."</p>
<p>"They're necessary though if we don't want to be transformed as well," the first one said her voice coming from a speaker.</p>
<p>"Well how do we know if we'll be transformed or not?" the second one asked getting into the other suit.</p>
<p>"The guy who gave us the mist told us that we would be transformed if we didn't," the first said, "and I don't want to test if he was 
telling the truth or not. But considering that all the others that were exposed to it were transformed I'd say it was a safe bet that we would 
be too."</p>
<p>"I just hate having something between me and the art," the second woman grumbled coming into the airlock and closing the first door.
</p>
<p>As soon as the first door was closed the second opened and I was pushed into the room beyond. I hadn't quite regained my balance 
when I heard a third woman ask, "What are you bitches doing with that girl?"</p>
<p>"We've found a girl to be your daughter in our mother daughter sculpture," the first woman said a smile in her voice. "Now we just need 
to figure out the pose you two will be in." She went over to the third woman who was naked and tied up. She hauled her to her feet and sat 
her on a stone bench. She seemed to ponder over it for a moment before saying, "I think a reading pose will be good. What do you think 
Gemma?"</p>
<p>"I think that's a great idea Greta," Gemma said grabbing my dress and yanking it off. "Oh have we been a naughty girl?" she asked 
when she saw my panties. I blushed as she pulled my panties down. "Now go sit by the lady and pull you legs up."</p>
<p>I figured I'd better do as she said since I didn't have much of a choice. Greta posed me so I was leaning up against the woman with 
my legs up on the bench arranged so from the right angle you could see my genitals. She tilted my head up to look at the woman and told 
me to smile. She then untied the woman while saying, "Release the Medusa Mist Gemma."</p>
<p>The room quickly filled up with a strange mist and my body exploded in pain. It was more pain than I had experienced before and I 
wanted to scream but I couldn't move. I couldn't even breath and my body was starting to scream for oxygen. I noticed Greta posing the 
woman so she had an arm around me and a smile on her face. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Gemma place a stone book in the 
woman's hand and arrange it so it looked like she had just lowered her hand to rest it for a moment. After a couple moments I saw gray 
patches start to form on the woman and I couldn't be sure but I thought she was turning to stone. That would make sense since Greta had 
called this mist Medusa Mist. Through the pain I could feel parts of my body becoming hard like stone and I guessed that I was becoming 
stone too. I didn't know how long I endured the pain before I finally lost consciousness but my last thought before that was wondering if I 
was dying as I turned into stone.</p></p>
