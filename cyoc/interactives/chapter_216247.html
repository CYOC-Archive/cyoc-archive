<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darren and Yuriko gaped as they stared at the scene before them. Morgan had returned to the scene of her crime with Tricia and Kari in tow. Alarmed at Morgan&#39;s presence, it was the enraged kit that concerned them more.<br />
<br />
Neither had ever seen Raiden this angry. The kit had always been a shy if somewhat awkward boy always sporting a warm smile. Kindness would best describe the red and black kit. That kindness though was now replaced with anguish as he lowered his apparently dead mother to the ground. Raiden was incensed, his eyes glowing a dark red. Even the world seemed to be affected by the boys mood as dark clouds now began to overtake the sky.<br />
<br />
With a primal scream, Raiden now embodied his name. Bolts of lightning now raining down from the heavens, cracking the very earth with its explosive power. Morgan and Kari now quickly dodged. Tricia, though, was not as fortunate as multiple lightning strikes passed through her. The Dragon Queen screaming in anguish as an explosion sent her unconscious body sailing into a nearby tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darren!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren quickly glanced at his teacher, understanding what needed to be done. Somehow the teen would need to stop both Morgan and Raiden from not only harming eachother but innocent bystanders as well. As Yuriko now raced to help Tricia, Darren found himself trying to restrain Morgan and calm Raiden.<br />
<br />
Morgan grunted, the lycan sorceress sneering as the kit raced towards her. This child had tapped into the elements of nature, useing it to try seek revenge for his mother. The raw power the kit produced was impressive. Even at such a young age the boy was already able to tap into his divine powers. Still, he was untrained,  unfocused. This display was no more than a temper tantrum with no strategy behind it. All Morgan needed to do was bide her time.<br />
<br />
A simple spell now created duplicates of herself, duplicates that Raiden immediately attacked. Slipping behind the kit, she watched him in awe. Whirlwinds of fire, bolts of lightning, even boulders of ice conjured by the young kit obliterated her doppelgangers. Celestial kitsunes were most certainly impressive, Morgan needed to be careful. As the last of her clones vanished, she now crafted a spell. She had no desire to kill Raiden, but she needed to incapacitate the boy. As her spell now sailed towards the kit she was surprised as a familiar foe now blocked it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You!&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren had observed everything. Raiden, in his rage, was trying to destroy Morgan. Already the kits anger had incapacitated the Dragon Queen. During the boys last spell, Morgan had countered, even with Kari desperately trying to hold her back. Raidens anger was so encompassing though that he had not noticed his aunts efforts. Instead the kit had struck her by mistake, Kari swept up in a whirlwind meant for Morgan and thrown into the forest. In time she would recover but for now she was effectively out of the fight. Morgan had used Raidens mistake to her advantage, appearing behind the kit to counter him. Instead, she found her spell deflected by Darren.<br />
<br />
Darren now readied himself as Morgan looked to charge. Instead though, the lycan sorceress paused, Darren at first confused until he heard Raiden roar. Spinning quickly, his eyes went wide as the angry kit now summoned a massive fireball, sending it hurtling towards Morgan.<br />
<br />
Darren grunted, useing the Dragons Tongue to block the attack, the heat from the blast almost causing him to pass out. Trying to catch his breath, he gasped as the kit and werewolf lunged at one another with Darren in the middle. <br />
<br />
Darren now found himself deflecting blows from not only an enraged kitsune kit but a powerful lycan sorceress as well. Claws, fangs  bursts of magic, Darren found himself the unwilling recipient of them all as he tried to deflect the blows. The teen felt as if he was in the middle of a fight between two rabid wild animals. He was having trouble separating the pair, Raiden seeming beyond reason as Morgan looked to stop the kit and destroy Darren.<br />
<br />
Darren was being battered,. As he looked to strike Morgan with his blade, Raiden attempted to leap over him. Darren stumbled, allowing Morgan to disarm him and strike him with a magical blast of her own. He felt as if he was hit with a sledgehammer, rocketing backwards into the kitsune. Before he could even catch his breath, Raiden now propelled Darren forward with a blast of his own. The teen now tumbling into Morgan who snarled at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;ENOUGH,&quot; Darren roared.<br />
<br />
Both Raiden and Morgan were now pushed back, giving Darren the needed to space to collect himself. This fight was not going to be easy. Raiden was beyond reason and Morgan was willing to destroy him as well as the kit. Looking between the pair, he realized he would need to stop Morgan first in order the calm Raiden down. The only question was could he do it with Raiden bent on Morgan&#39;s destruction.<br />
<br />
As his eyes began tobflow, he paused as a brilliant flash of light now illuminated the space between him and Morgan. At first confused he gawked as he stared at the pair of figures.<br />
<br />
Morgan snarled, incapacitating Raiden to prevent him from being harmed was one thing. The Catalyst sticking his nose into her business was completely different. She just needed the right opportunity to finish him, yet this celestial kit kept interfering. She would have to knock the kit out first before destroying Darren. As she looked to attack once more, she shielded her eyes as a light flashed before her. Slowly her vision began to clear, the lycan sorceress gasping at the pair of figures. &quot;Evan?&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan Hariis smirked, the young man and his girlfriend surveying the scene. Slowly Morgan began to revert to human form. The lycan decreasing in size, her white and black fur receding as her face began to take human proportions. &quot;Evan,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Is..is it really you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Raiden too was confused by the scene, the kits rage subsiding as Morgan returned to human form. As his thoughts began to clear he looked first to Darren, then Morgan, then the two strangers. &quot;Hey kid,&quot; Evan called to Darren. &quot;I&#39;ll deal with my aunt. You wanna take the kit and my girlfriend inside?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Girlfriend,&quot; Lynne bellowed, the ghost finally able to return to a corporeal form. &quot;I haven&#39;t heard from you in over six months and you show up with a girlfriend?!&quot; Evan rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly as Darren gawked at him. &quot;What are you doing here Evan a d how is this even possible?!&quot; Evan simply shrugged, he couldn&#39;t explain it either.<br />
<br />
A soft groan now drew everyone&#39;s attention. Slowly Abolith now regained consciousness, much to Raidens delight. &quot;Mom,&quot; he cried, throwing himself on the battered elf. Abolith was confused, unsure of where she was as Raiden sobbed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ms. Yuriko,&quot; Darren stated. &quot;Can you help everyone inside. I need to talk with Evan and Morgan.&quot; Yuriko paused, not wanting to leave her young student alone but understanding that as the Catalyst he needed to deal with these types of things. Ushering everyone inside, she now turned to Darren, Evan, and Morgan. &quot;Call if you need me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren nodded, gazing at a revived Evan and stunned Morgan. The fight maybe over but so many questions lay before them.</p>
