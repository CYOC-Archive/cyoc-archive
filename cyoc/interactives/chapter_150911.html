<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    &quot;We&#39;re here.&quot;<br />
<br />
    At the human&#39;s words, Thorin&#39;s eyes rose up to glimpse at the building before him. The guardhouse was neither small nor large, a simple wooden door acting as an entrance, walls of stone and a tower extending above the roof. Being a mage, the kobold felt an indescribable feeling of anxiety wash over him, something that did not go unnoticed by his companion.<br />
<br />
    Glancing down at the silent lizardboy, Kairos&#39; voice grew soft; a contrast to his apathetic tone moments earlier. &quot;You want to wait out here for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;N-No…&quot; Thorin&#39;s voice echoed, just above a whisper. Taking a shaky breath, his gentle amber eyes slowly rose to meet Kairos&#39; gaze. &quot;No, I can go in.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Clutching his tome for emotional support, the kobold sucked in a tight breath as he followed the human to the door of the guardhouse, each click from his claws instilling an unfathomable fear within him. He held no reason to be so scared of knights; he was friends with one. <br />
<br />
    The feeling failed to be dismissed, and there was no turning back as Kairos&#39; fingers rapped against the wooden surface of the door.<br />
<br />
    Responding to his knock, various rattling and clicking of locks resounded from behind it, a spine chilling creak echoing throughout the silent streets of Vestra. Wooden door opened to reveal a rugged looking man in his mid-thirties. His eyes contained an almost bestial quality to them, animalistic even. Appearing to wear little clothes aside from what was necessary to preserve modesty, Thorin could only assume he was part beastfolk much like Orveus was, showing similar qualities in appearance and clothing. Or lack thereof.<br />
<br />
    At the sight of Kairos the man&#39;s eyes lit up, although his expression remained stoic; yet Thorin detected a hint of playfulness in the man&#39;s voice as he spoke. &quot;Well, pretty boy&#39;s finally back.&quot; The man&#39;s head tilted in mild curiosity as his gaze fell upon the kobold at the human&#39;s side, face widening into a teasing grin. &quot;And it looks like he got a small little boy to accompany him. New recruit?&quot;<br />
<br />
    Rolling his eyes, a sigh of annoyance slipped from Kairos&#39; lips. &quot;Does he <i>look</i> like a recruit, Moroz?&quot; The blue eyed human raised a finger before the beastman could utter a response. &quot;Don&#39;t... answer that question. I came here to report. Now, quit wasting my time and kindly get out of the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Primal eyes rolled as Moroz hesitantly obeyed the red clad human&#39;s command, floorboards creaking beneath him as he stepped back with a gesture for the pair to enter. The door closed with a slam the moment the pair entered, locks clicking as the beastman fiddled with the door.<br />
<br />
    Thorin struggled to stifle a gag at the thick scent of sweat that flooded the interior of the guardhouse, shoving his maw inside his cloak in an attempt to lessen the presence of the arguably foul stench. Even then, the kobold hastily kept close to Kairos&#39; side as the bestial man guided them around, deeper within the cramped space where the scent quickly intensified.<br />
<br />
    The trio came to a stop before a rectangular shaped table, four chairs on both sides. Motioning for the pair to sit, wood creaked as Moroz exited. Fidgeting, the baldric holding Kairos&#39; equipment was unstrapped, the blonde haired human setting his gear against the back legs of his chair. Clasping the black tome at his belt, it was easily retrieved and set atop the fancy surface of the table. The yellow kobold at his side could not stifle a shiver as he gazed upon the eye at its cover.<br />
<br />
    The gentle ticking of a clock was all that accompanied the pair in their agonizing wait of silence, until the grating sound of creaking floorboards shattered the quietness; beastman returning with company. Circling around to the other side of the table, Moroz seated himself, accompanied by an elderly yet gruff man clad in simple yet rather regal plate armor, dull green eyes wise yet primal.<br />
<br />
    The older man&#39;s eyes glared at the red clad mercenary before him, expression unreadable. Tension choking the air around them, the man&#39;s gravelly voice pierced through the stale silence. &quot;State your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Pausing momentarily as if to process the man&#39;s words, the blue eyed human brushed back a lock of hair, tone hard as stone.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Kairos Leikal.&quot;<br />
<br />
    At Kairos&#39; recital the gruff man&#39;s features noticeably soften, mask of seriousness dissipating. &quot;Good to see you&#39;ve made it back in one piece, Leikal.&quot; Instinctively his gaze shot to the yellow scaled form at the knight&#39;s side, the kobold&#39;s gaze breaking and diverting to the table out of feared respect. The homely smile stretched across his face coupled with his baritone voice gave off an unusual warmth. &quot;Who&#39;s this young lad? Looks far too young to be a mercenary.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Grunting in annoyance, Kairos placed an elbow on top of the desk, tiredly leaning his head on his hand. &quot;He&#39;s a friend of mine from the local academy,&quot; pausing, his eyes narrowed into slits as they shifted to the kobold, &quot;and has no interest in becoming a mercenary. So don&#39;t get your hopes up, Vincent.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Vincent&#39;s lips twisted into a rather displeased scowl, although he did not press the two further. Moroz&#39;s gruff voice took his place to respond, his nose twitching and primal eyes darting to Kairos. &quot;I smell Alpheir. Where is he?&quot;<br />
<br />
    Kairos momentarily froze up at the beastman&#39;s comment, sucking in a breath. Blue eyes drifted downwards to the black tome in front of him, voice almost monotone. &quot;Orveus... couldn&#39;t make it.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Even after being confronted by Orveus&#39; soul in that void, the guilt still chipped away at him. No one in their right mind could feel content at forever being bound to another in such a away; unable to pass on. It had to be a facade, to make him feel better. The same could not be said of Kenos, however.<br />
<br />
    Moroz&#39;s form seemed to tense up, although he simply leaned back in his seat in resignation. &quot;Well, can&#39;t say I&#39;m shocked. The bastard loved to run into things without a care for his own safety.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Vincent&#39;s withered eyes dulled, the elderly man&#39;s fists clasping together to lean his chin upon. &quot;So, Orveus&#39; Alpheir has perished, and you subdued his killer, correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
    As he spoke, Thorin couldn&#39;t help but notice how the old man&#39;s voice remained unusually serene; not a hint of sorrow present after receiving such dire news. Even if he was old and used to battle, such little reaction felt… off-putting.<br />
<br />
    Blue eyes fell to the black tome atop the table, staring into the malevolent eye on its cover in twisted reminiscence. &quot;I did. In fact, it was the very mage we were sent out to kill. Or, the <em>son</em> of the mage, at least.&quot; His head shook to snap him free of the daze, idly scratching at his cheek. &quot;His sacrifice wasn&#39;t in vain. It&#39;s gotten us closer to figuring out the source of the kidnappings.&quot;<br />
<br />
     Vincent&#39;s stoney gaze locked with Kairos&#39; own, lips twisted into a slight smile. &quot;It has. Did you hear the news of what happened last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
    The red clad knight averted his gaze for a few moments, recollecting his thoughts. A switch in his head went off as he knew exactly what the old man was referring to.<br />
<br />
    Kairos mentally grit his teeth. He&#39;d have to twist the truth a bit lest they find out about his role in it or how he managed to obtain the knowledge of what Kenos had said. <br />
<br />
    &quot;...Yeah, something at the library. A group of hooded figures from what I&#39;ve heard.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Nodding, Vincent&#39;s gruff voice continued. &quot;A group of reptilian scoundrels. The scaled dastards probably wanted something. Who knows what that librarian keeps in there.&quot; Closing his eyes and breathing to still himself, the old man gestured for Morzon to explain.<br />
<br />
    &quot;When we went to clean up the mess after getting a few noise complaints, we found it had already been cleaned up for us. That librarian handled them all by herself, apparently.&quot; The beastman paused as he lifted something from behind his seat, a large bag of sorts. &quot;So we had to go through the process of removing the <em>actual</em> mess. Took their gutted bodies in and found some interesting stuff on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Head tilting, Kairos leaned into the table. &quot;What did you find?&quot;<br />
<br />
    Without a further word, Moroz&#39;s large bestial hands dug into the bag atop, rummaging through before retrieving and placing a few curious objects atop the tables wooden surface. Such objects appeared to be a white tome, a small dagger, and a picture.<br />
<br />
    &quot;These are just a few of many other things we got from them, but it&#39;s really all you need to see to get the point across.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Vincent&#39;s hands graced the cover of the white tome, lifting it up to show the pair. His eyes shifted to Thorin, the kobold gulping nervously as his own eyes took in the sight of the eagle-like symbol upon its cover. &quot;You recognize this cover, don&#39;t you lizard boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;Y-Yes…&quot; The kobold&#39;s body trembled wildly as he withdrew his hands from his cloak, the same white tome clutched tightly within his claws. &quot;T-Those are the tomes they give us apprentice mages at the academy…&quot;<br />
<br />
    Laying the white tome flat on the table, Vincent&#39;s hands drifted toward the dagger, lightly twirling it within his hands as he held it up. &quot;This dagger here is a common weapon for trainees over at that academy, usually the lockpicks and wannabe thieves.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Placing the blade back atop the table, the old man placed his fingers above the photo, sliding it to Kairos&#39; end. Flipping it over, he angled the picture for Thorin to see.<br />
<br />
    It was a picture of a boy, no doubt in his mid teens. There seemed to be nothing of interest about the boy appearance wise, instilling confusion and dread within Kairos. &quot;You found this photo with one of the lizardmen Interlopers?&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;He looks like he goes to the academy.&quot; Thorin&#39;s claws nervously clasped over his maw as he took in the boy&#39;s features. &quot;I feel like I&#39;ve seen his face…&quot;<br />
<br />
    Kairos&#39; gaze slowly drifted from the picture to lock eyes with Vincent, lips twisted in a mutual scowl. &quot;A photo of a boy from the academy, along with his tome and a dagger given for close quarters combat. You found these on the same body didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
    Moroz gave a nod in Vincent&#39;s place, a hint of softness in his gruff voice. &quot;Already you can tell what this means. This clan of lizardmen has been specifically targeting boys from the academy, human ones at that and <em>only</em> humans. The others have similar belongings, it&#39;s in plain sight yet we&#39;ve been blind to it the entire time.&quot;<br />
<br />
    The beastman paused to bring a finger up to his chin, collecting his thoughts. &quot;I couldn&#39;t figure out why at first, but now it&#39;s quite obvious to me why they&#39;d go after these young boys, and keep their selection limited to humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Kairos&#39; brow furrowed in confusion as Moroz pointed a finger at both him and Vincent. &quot;Humans are an <em>incredibly</em> malleable species. A single bite from me would be enough to turn both of you into one of me; a beastman, although it&#39;d be a slow and painful process. And that&#39;s <em>just</em> through biting.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;A small rural town filled with protege human mages, ripe for the picking. What more could they ask for?&quot; Moroz&#39;s bestial eyes drifted to the photo of the young apprentice, baring his fangs in a scowl. &quot;And with all these mages being so young, that makes them even easier to mold into their own little slaves. They could probably do it with a snap of their fingers if they really wanted to.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Kairos&#39; blue eyes had long fallen to the items on top of the tables wooden surface, fingers idly rubbing at his chin. &quot;That still doesn&#39;t answer why they&#39;re doing it in the first place. These kidnappings have been going on for <em>months</em>, and only now do we finally make some progress.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Hand clenched into a fist, the knight grit his teeth as he forced himself to lock eyes with his commander. &quot;And that&#39;s not even mentioning the moral dilemma we&#39;re now forced to face by knowing all this. How are we supposed to tell the families of these kidnapped boys? Hell, should we?&quot;<br />
<br />
    Vincent&#39;s eyes dulled in thought, considering the actions they could take. He shook his head in resignation, face softening. &quot;Situations like this are something neither of you have been trained for. I&#39;ll handle telling the people, if needed.&quot; The old man paused for a moment, eyes clouding over. &quot;And with this revelation, I doubt families would take it well knowing it was us who killed their children.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Moroz&#39;s bestial hands quickly recollected the three items from the table surface, returning them to the bag. His primal eyes lit up in curiosity as he glanced at the photo one last time before he slid it back in.<br />
<br />
    Head shaking, the beastman gently placed the bag behind him, a scowl stretched across his lips. &quot;Some guards we are. Can&#39;t even protect our own citizens.&quot; His thick fingers tapped against the wooden tabletop in seeming impatience. &quot;We <em>could</em> try asking the capital for help, but it&#39;s doubtful they&#39;ll provide. Probably think it&#39;s a waste of resources or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Kairos released an exasperated sigh, fingers grinding at his temples in annoyance. &quot;We&#39;ve hit a wall then. Asking for help and alarming the people is out of the question. As much as I&#39;d like to, I know nothing will come out of either.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Vincent chuckled, a laugh without joy. &quot;While we have hit a wall, Leikal, I still have a job for you.&quot; His expression grew stony once again as Kairos returned his attention.<br />
<br />
    &quot;This is an assumption, but with all that&#39;s currently going on, I&#39;d wager even an assumption will make way for a vital revelation.&quot;<br />
<br />
    The red clad human before him groaned, head leaning into his hand in apathy. &quot;You know old man, assumptions in situations like these commonly lead to hasty decisions.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Vincent&#39;s eyes narrowed into knives at Kairos, yet he did not retort. Gesturing for the three at the table to lean in closer, his voice lowered to a whisper. &quot;It&#39;s no question that these kidnappings have been happening right under our noses. While we are notified the moment someone goes missing, no one ever catches sight of the perpetrators in the act.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Moroz&#39;s guttural voice interjected, primal eyes alright in  realization. &quot;So, you&#39;re saying we might have a few defectors, people here in Vestra who are actually helping these scum.&quot;<br />
<br />
    The old man chuckled, giving an amused nod. &quot;I was getting there, but that about sums it up.&quot; His chortling faded as green eyes turned to Kairos. &quot;And that&#39;s why I want <em>you</em>, Leikal, to go around and investigate.&quot;<br />
<br />
    At this Kairos chuckled, leaning back in his seat with an amused smile. &quot;Tell me you&#39;re joking.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;Do you think I&#39;m joking, Leikal? We both know you&#39;re more fit for such a task than me or Moroz, or anyone else in this guardhouse for that matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;...Which is why you&#39;re sending me off to extort people for information we already know? <em>If</em> there are detectors, they&#39;re not just going to come out and say they&#39;re with these clansmen. I can&#39;t tell whether you&#39;re a dumbass or desperate if you&#39;re asking me to do the investigating.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Vincent quickly became silent, closing his eyes in thought. They opened just as quickly, darting to the kobold at Kairos&#39; side. &quot;You, lizard boy. You go to the academy here, yes?&quot; <br />
<br />
    A nod from Thorin was all he needed to be spurred to action, the old man&#39;s face lighting up thoughtfully. &quot;While Leikal here investigates the townsfolk, I want you to keep track of stuff in the academy. Unlike a majority of the mages enrolled, you&#39;re a kobold.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;And that means you&#39;re in no danger of being kidnapped yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Kairos&#39; brow furrowed instantly, teeth grit in fury. &quot;Oh <em>hell</em> no.&quot; <br />
<br />
    &quot;You&#39;re not sending off an apprentice mage to do work like this. We have no reason to be dragging innocents into this. I can&#39;t bear the thought of harm coming to him if he finds something.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Moroz sighed a half growl, tiredly scratching at his cheek. &quot;We don&#39;t have a choice, Kairos. If we&#39;re being logical here, it&#39;s an opportunity we absolute can&#39;t let go to waste. Unless you&#39;d like us to continue smashing our faces into a wall while more are kidnapped?&quot;<br />
<br />
    Thorin gulped, stifling a nervous gasp as Moroz&#39;s primal gaze shifted to him. &quot;Will you accept this task?&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;I-I…&quot;<br />
<br />
    The kobold&#39;s scales shivered in fearful apprehension. It was true; having him investigate the academy along with being enrolled there was a very strategic move, and one the clansmen wouldn&#39;t see coming.<br />
<br />
    Kairos was objective of the idea, yet it was clear he knew the benefits of such an action as well. <br />
<br />
    The kobold&#39;s fingers clutched his tome tightly, teeth clenched as he sighed. Forcing himself to glance up, amber eyes locked with the beastman&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;</p>
