<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick, along with his friends Jason and Vince were walking down the sidewalk towards the old mansion. Nick was feeling strangely compelled towards it. All three were sixteen years old, kinda geeky and went to high school together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are we going to that creepy old place anyway?&quot; asked Jason, clearly bored. <br />
<br />
&quot;What else are we going to do?&quot; replied Nick. &quot;Besides, I've always wanted to check it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick opened the gate and approached the house. It was clearly in a state of disrepair, especially in broad daylight. <br />
<br />
Circe, in her flowing white robes, walked out of the house. All three boys were captivated by the sight of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; asked Vince.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, I'm Circe, and this is my house.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought it was abandoned,&quot; replied Jason. <br />
<br />
&quot;I just recently took ownership of it, silly boy,&quot; she said. She focus shifted towards Nick. &quot;And you are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm...I'm Nick,&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
Circe walked over to Nick. &quot;Yes, won't you three come inside?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; replied Nick as he followed her into the house. Bryan and Tony shared a glance and apprehensively followed Nick and Circe into the house. <br />
<br />
Circe gestured towards the living room. &quot;Why don't you two have a seat in there? I want to have a private little chat with Nick.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bryan and Tony followed Circe's request and sat down on a dusty old couch in the living room. Circe and Nick remained in the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know your hidden desire, Nick. I can sense it, loud and clear,&quot; whispered Circe. <br />
<br />
&quot;You can?&quot; replied Nick. Nick did indeed have a hidden desire. For the longest time, he had held a fascination with werewolves. Not the type in horror movies, who only changed at the full moon, but true shapeshifters, who could change at will, day or night.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I can make it real. If we can come to some sort of arrangement. I would like to take your two friends as laborers, and in exchange for your trust and loyalty, I will give you the abilities of a true werewolf,&quot; said Circe.<br />
<br />
Nick's heart was beating a mile a minute. He looked to his two friends. They were immature morons. He felt no real loyalty towards them, only pity. The experience of working for Circe might actually be good for them. He turned back to Circe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see how this is actually possible, but I agree,&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh this is so much easier when the person is willing!&quot; she exclaimed. With a flick of the wrist, it was done. <br />
<br />
At first, nothing happened. Nick started to absent-mindedly scratch his chest. When he realized what he was doing, he pulled off his shirt. His once hairless chest had a fine layer of brown fur growing over it, quickly growing thicker by the moment. The fur was also growing over his arms, hands and he could feel it growing on his legs as well. He felt a tickle as it grew on his face as well. <br />
<br />
He held up his hands and watched as his fingernails grew out and reformed into claws. He felt a dull pain in his mouth. He ran over to the hall mirror and saw his teeth were growing out into sharp fangs. He noticed something else, his eyes had changed from their usual blue to a dazzling yellow. <br />
<br />
He felt his muscles tense and reform into large, strong muscles, his chest barreling out, seemingly with every breath. He could feel his body filling with immense strength.<br />
<br />
Nick felt a tightness in his shoes as his feet started to grow and reform. He quickly pulled them off and tossed them aside. He slowly grew taller as his feet reformed into clawed digigrade paws. <br />
<br />
Nick felt a tightness in his rear and reached to the back of his pants, ripping a hole with his claws for his new tail to grow from.<br />
<br />
He turned back to the mirror to watch the final bits of transformation. His ears grew to a point and migrated to the top of his head as his face pushed out into a snout.<br />
<br />
Nick howled with approval.<br />
<br />
Jason and Vince ran into the hall and saw the werewolf and Circe standing in the hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!&quot; exclaimed Jason. <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to Nick?&quot; exclaimed Vince.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, I gave him what he always wanted in exchange for you two,&quot; replied Circe.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? He always wanted to be a big slobbering wolf-man?&quot; replied Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently. And who can blame him? I've always had a little something for the werewolf myself. The raw beastliness, the incredibly fur...I'm telling you, it's incredible,&quot; replied Circe. &quot;And that says nothing for his improved equipement.&quot;<br />
<br />
Circe grabbed Nick's crotch while simultaneously running her fingers through his fur, giving him an instant erection. She could feel this through the tattered remains of his jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Nick...down boy,&quot; she muttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do to us?&quot; cried Jason. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you guys are going to help me fix up my new house, as simple wolf men, of course,&quot; replied Circe, giving them both a flick of the wrist.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, please!&quot; cried Jason. But the change had already begun. He looked at his hands, watching the claws and fur grow. &quot;PLEASE!&quot;</p>
