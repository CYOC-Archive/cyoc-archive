<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">David returned to his parked car, he glad to be away from the invocation ceremony; although he did not get away unscathed. His dear wife of seven years had coaxed him to come with her to the magic ceremony, where she had great hopes of her attaining some magical powers. They had left home in such a rush because David had to work an hour of overtime at the market. Marla had heard about the planned ceremony from a friend who could not attend, as she sent her two twin daughters in her stead.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK dear, you coming home with me or prefer to wander and find some goat farm where to live?&quot; David asked his wife, she there by his car seemed to be sniffing the breeze for some tantalizing scent. When David opened his driver&#39;s side door, Marla charged past him, as jumped inside the car, taking a seated position on the passenger front bucket seat.<br />
<br />
David sat down into his Corvette and upon closing the door he put the key into the car ignition and gave it the usual twist. As the car motor started a buzzer sounded and David did as was commonplace for him, he said, &quot;Marla, would you please buckle yourself into the seat?&quot;<br />
<br />
A terse look to what became of his wife and David then offered some needed help with drawing the safety strap across his wife&#39;s furry chest and clipped into the lock if just to silence the warning buzzer. Shifting the transmission into drive mode, David sped away, he felt angry and wondered what excuse he could use to respond about why his wife had ceased residing with him at their house in town.<br />
<br />
David occasionally peered a quick glanced look at what had happened to his wife, seeing her tail as wiggling, hind legs twitching, while she tried hard to crane her neck back and head down for her to lick at her milk bloated udder and teats.<br />
<br />
Halfway back toward where they lived, suddenly Marla began to bleat in a frantic tone. <br />
<br />
&quot;What, what is wrong now,&quot; David asked, as just then he saw a roadside rest stop, where he drove off the freeway, and stopped, parking as far away from any other vehicles. &quot;OK, so we stopped, what was so urgent?&quot; David asked of Marla as he unstrapped his goaty wife, she leaping at the car door, made David move to unlatch as open the passenger side door.<br />
<br />
Marla leaped from off her seat and ran out into the trees surrounding the rest area.<br />
<br />
A still caring husband rushed to get out of his car and closing the door, he locked the car before going to search for his wayward wife turned doe goat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marla,&quot; David called, as the hour was near early morning, 4:00 am of a Sunday morning. David was thinking as he was driving, planning how and where to keep Marla, but not inside the house. His wife was a good hiker and camper enthusiast, she liked living out of doors, in the wilds, sleeping under a starlit sky. &quot;Well then, Marla can get her favorite likes, she can sleep outside the house. Her becoming as hoofed should aid her style for hiking up high hills and over loose rocks. Yet what do I tell or neighbors, Marla has friends, as luckily her mother lives far away, maybe..., yes she got mad at me and went to visit her mother in upstate Maine.&quot; David schemed, he thinking as he was looking for his wild wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, somebody grab that goat!&#39; A man there at the rest area yelled, he was chasing Marla, as she was chasing after another goat, a much larger goat what had long and pointed horns.<br />
<br />
&quot;That goat is my pet,&quot; David yelled, as he took chase along side the other man chasing after both goats.<br />
<br />
&quot;I own that stupid buck goat,&quot; the other man told David. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is he a pet?&quot; David asked as they ran and dodged trees.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no way, but I was paid to transport him to a petting zoo, but your doe goat got the buck interested and he became aroused, smashing the crate door and jumped off my truck.&quot; The man said, as he was so looking at David, he did not see an approaching tree.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thud, boink, ow, and thud,&quot; as the man hit the tree, bonked his head, and fell backwards, down to the ground. Oh crap, I ain&#39;t so young as able to chase that damn goat!&quot; The man said, as David ran back to offer the man any needed aid. &quot;I will tell you what, let me buy the goat from you as a buck for mine to keep her giving me milk!&quot; David said, as he took out his wallet and seeing the money he had planed to spend for a night of lodging after the invocation ceremony. &quot;I got two hundred dollars here, what do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, I was given fifty bucks to pay for that dump goat, if you want him so bad, you can have him for an easy hundred dollars!&quot; Said the man as David offered the man a hand to get standing back up on two tired feet.<br />
<br />
Money traded hands and the other man walked back to his truck and drove away quickly.<br />
<br />
David wondering where Marla might run off to do or her to get it done to her, when he arrived back to his Corvette, there was Marla standing stiff legged, her head hung low. As well there and he over her back laid a buck goat, his tongue lolled out his agape mouth. As David spied the buck the male goat cast a look up at his new owner, having feelings from the last fun few seconds of his semen trailing to a last drip from his efforts.  <br />
<br />
&quot;OK, Marla when your friend finishes his fun with you, he can come home with us as I bought the stud, but ask me why I do not know!&quot; David said as Marla was first to lift her head and taking two steps away from her fun loving buck. The buck goat sliding off the back and butt of Marla, dropping to all fours he followed her when she leaped into the car. As David plopped into his front seat and belted himself in, he looked behind his seat to the truck area, as both Marla and her buck had taken to lying beside the other, both looking as if pacified.<br />
<br />
An hour of fast driving brought the changed family back home. As David drove inside the garage he pressed the button and closed the garage door down before he opened his car door to get up as out of his Corvette. Marla followed the lead of her David, as did the buck goat leap out of the car, his sharp hind hoofs cutting s split-cut in the leather seat.<br />
<br />
David was beside himself and seeing the seat as slit open, he slam,med the car door shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, Marla listen to me and listen good. You are a goat and that is an animal, as you must agree your toilet use is now rather outside the house and not inside. We have that dog run behind the garage, so for tonight and maybe a few days I need for you and your playboy buck there to stay in the fenced area.&quot; David said, as Marla feeling quite well made horny by the buck mating with her, she gave a willing nodding of her head.<br />
<br />
David walked the two goats to the door entering the twenty by twenty foot wide as long dog pen and there a large dog house that belonged to a Saint Bernard. David left the two goats to get even better acquainted while he, David entered his house to retrieve a pail of cold water to allow the goats a drink. It was by then 5:30 am on a Sunday morning and David felt beat. He left his two goat to frolicking as he went inside his house with thoughts to take a needed showering, and then go to bed.<br />
<br />
Tired to feeling weary even if knowing his wife was outside inside a fenced pen with a large buck goat screwing her to being cross eyed. David began to undress, as off came his soiled and sweaty shirt, as then his white undershirt. He sat down to remove his hiking boots, and then removed his thick cotton socks. He lifted high his legs to slide off the denim jeans he wore due to a short notice for their going to the ceremony. It was then that his tired mind was reminded what the Priestess did to his maleness. As if David were unavailing a work of fine art, he ever so slowly slid off as down his pair of jockey undershorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh crap,&quot; David said as he saw his fur covered crotch. There where his manly genitals hung what he had carried through several Marine soldering encounters with bad men, was now his changed scrotum and penis; but the penis set down inside a very buck goat style sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no,&quot; David groaned as he uncovered his buck goat size and contoured genitals. He stared down at his male package, seeing his as said, Kiwi size balls, hung low held in by a fur, brown fur covered skin. As he reached both hands to give his bigger furry balls a cradling, the very touching of them sparked his goat like cock to begin a state of arousal.<br />
<br />
Leaping to stand on two solid feet, and two strong legs, David felt his big balls swaying. The touching of them, the swaying sensation worked to enhance the arousal of his very changed penis turned to a buck goat&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no...,&quot; David moaned as his changed penis poked a pointed head past the outer edge of a furred sheath attached then to his lower abdomen, it two inches below his belly button. As did his cock stiffen and extend, it was much smaller, about the size of a school pencil. His cock was highly sensual and made by plan to fit inside his doe of a goat wife. Although Marla was likely busy with her fun stud buck, David was not thinking about sleep, rather he wanted, needed to go mate with any a doe goat!</p>
