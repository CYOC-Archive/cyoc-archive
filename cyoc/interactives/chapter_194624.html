<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Irritated by the hopelessness displayed by Dracula, the Wolfman growled in frustration at him. A part of him knew that Drac could be right, but the larger part of him wanted to try anyway. They were there to accomplish a goal, a goal in revitalizing monsters and the people that would no doubt be in the audience obviously would want the same thing. He had seen on chat rooms, message boards, and all sorts of places that a lot of humans wished that they could see things return to the old days where all the monsters, especially werewolves, were monstrous, bloodthirsty, ravaging beasts that would fuck shit up and not care about the consequences which the Wolfman longed for as well. Being in his current human form, he looked Drac in the eyes and decided to stand up to the ancient vampire, knowing that between the two of them... he was far more powerful due to how much more ancient he was compared to Dracula. He knew that Drac knew that he was no match for the werewolf, especially if he went into his other forms. For as long as they knew each other, the wolfman never went full werewolf on him... only into his wolfman form, which was about a quarter of the way being a wolf. The strongest, most monstrous form he could take was that of being halfway to have the strength, speed, and senses that a wolf has while having the human mind and all the benefits that come from that, but also brings forth a beast more monstrous due to the beastly nature of the human mind in the first place. The &quot;wolfman&quot; form was just a very subdued version that only let the animal out a bit and allowed the monster a little freedom, but Wolf desperately wanted to be able to go back to the old days... when stories were originally written about them... showcasing what they were, but still would only get bits and pieces of the full story.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drac... come on man, we have been at this for so long and we have put so much into this, if we give up now, then they win and we would have lost out on all of the resources that we used to make this happen in the first place. You&#39;re not as old as I am, but I also know you aren&#39;t someone to throw away opportunities or resources. If you don&#39;t follow through with this, then that is exactly what you would be doing in the end. If you don&#39;t want to go out there, then don&#39;t, but I am not going to waste the people out there. They might not all want to be werewolves, but if you guys don&#39;t come out there with me... then that&#39;s the only option they got.&quot; The wolfman said as he looked toward the stage and noticed that there was no one seated there yet, but Wolf  was certain there would be at least a couple guys there that he would turn... guys he invited personally that loved werewolves, especially the monstrous types.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Wolf, I am not going to risk my eternal life nor the eternal lives of all of the others just to take a bold step to increase our ranks. If you want to go out there and claim every one of the people out there, regardless of who they are, and adding them to your pack... then that risk is on you. We are only immortal... not invulnerable and immortal. There are ways to kill us and the risk is just too high. We have existed in hiding for so long because of our secrecy... don&#39;t you think the monster hunters out there would be doing the same thing?! Don&#39;t you think they would hand down their craft to their families over the ages? It&#39;s too uncertain and I can&#39;t risk everyone! If you want to take your own immortal life into those clawed paws of yours, <b>fine</b> be my guest!&quot; Drac said as he turned his back toward Wolf and walked away from him with all of the others, leaving him to his own vices.<br />
<br />
Wolf just shook his head in dismay with his back turned to the stage and the visible portion of the seats in the front row, feeling sad for Drac and the others, and then turned around to get up on stage to start the one monster show. It wasn&#39;t something he really thought he would be doing, but the reality of the situation was that he was certain that he was about to have at least a couple werewolves to add to his pack... those he personally invited and wanted to have sit front row to get the best view of the show... even though no one had showed up yet that he could see or even smell. The one wolf show that he was about to put on would be one where he&#39;d transform completely, spraying his cum all over the audience and watch them all change from the exposure. It was his favorite way of making new wolves, regardless of their sexual preference because in the end... the wolfman would be having his new wolves howling for him. It&#39;d had been a long time since he went from being in his human form to his anthro form and because of this, he planned on doing it right. He knew people loved watching clothes ripping and the wolf bursting forth from them as a visual showing of the chains humanity places on itself being broken and permanently removed... especially his personal fans whom he invited there!<br />
<br />
Closing his eyes and taking a deep breath, Wolf looked down at his watch and saw that there was about a half hour before show time and not seeing anyone in the audience was making him kind of antsy. He expected at least the couple guys he spoke to directly, going from the message board to a live and private chat space where two guys had eagerly agreed to attend the show, but even they were not there yet. What Wolf also didn&#39;t know was the plans Drac made for their show, which were what caused Drac to get cold feet in the first place. Once Drac had rented out the entire theater for their performance for the single night, potentially having other performances depending on the turn out, Drac cast a very powerful spell on the entire building that made up the theater in the first place. It was a power enhancing spell that would draw only the most serious and avid monster lovers there for it, but would also increase the original monster&#39;s power exponentially. It was originally designed to split the power amongst all the monsters that performed, but what Drac didn&#39;t know when it was cast was that it also would grow in power as the monsters did... so at first it would just be the theater... but with the right amount of people... it could turn into the whole town. Another thing that Drac didn&#39;t consider was the town had a ton of werewolf lovers, but didn&#39;t care for any of the other monsters because they were thought to be boring or dull. Now that Wolf was the only one performing... the theater was an active beacon calling to all of the werewolf lovers in town to join the pack initially and then corrupt the others for the whole town to be a massive pack of werewolves... all to turn Wolf into a beast never seen before... a beast even Zeus hadn&#39;t expected on ever creating. The thing was, as long as Wolf went on to do the show, even without a single person in the auditorium, because of the spell Drac put on the building... even the employees would be affected, being made into werewolves, but they wouldn&#39;t get the full transformation. They would receive small doses of it... effecting their ears, teeth and possibly their muscles and body hair, maybe even having the beginnings of claws forming. It was all unknown and a major variable, but if more were in the auditorium, it was a potential that even the employees would become full werewolves just from the exposure and dosage of the magic.<br />
<br />
The only question was on Wolf&#39;s mind was how many were going to show? He&#39;d have been happy just to see a single person show to add to the pack, but Wolf definitely wanted to have numbers in attendance to really add to the pack... instead of piecemealing it together.</p>
