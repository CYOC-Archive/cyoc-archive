<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty grinned as he came to a decision what he would do with Dustin and in consequence wit his foster-parents. So, with a short thought wish, Dustin would appear in the center of Ty´s room, unable to move.<br />
Dustin had been lying in his bed thinking what the hell had happened to him, how Ty was able to do this and why his parents didn´t notice. At the moment he was only wearing some old black boxers and grey socks of his, luckily fitting, and a blue shirt that was now too big on him. While he was still trying to wrap his head around what happened, he suddenly felt a pull, and after blinking once he stood in Ty´s room, unable to move.<br />
“Oh Dustin, nice of you to drop by.” Ty said grinning. As Dustin couldn´t move, not even open his mouth to speak, he was kept silent, so Ty continued: “You see, I was just thinking about what to do with you.” Dustin´s eyes were the only thing moving, and they widened at that. What Ty would do with him? Wasn´t being pushed back in development enough already.<br />
“As I was saying, I have decided what to do. Since I was adopted into this house I´m much restricted in what I´m allowed to do, while on the other side I get most of the chores. You do nearly nothing and your parents allow you nearly everything, even making my life worse. I will change that for us. Maybe then living in this house will be better.” Ty explained evenly, not showing any anger for being treated worse than Dustin.<br />
Dustin feared what Ty may do now. Whatever he could do, if Ty only made him do some of his chores to even them out between them, he could life with it. But Ty had plans that he set into motion with a silent wish. With a bit of discomfort Dustin felt himself stretch higher, the boxers he wore pressing tightly into his body, his shirt suddenly reaching only down to his navel. Ty had just let him grow bigger, something Dustin would be happy about if it was all. If only his clothes had stretched with him.<br />
“Already better, but I will need to make a few more adjustments.” And with that Ty made another silent wish. The pressure on Dustin´s cock and balls lessened, much to his relieve. Had he known the reason this second, it wouldn´t have been relieve, however. So it was only a couple of seconds later he realized what had happened and his eyes widened in horror. It hadn´t been his old boxers that had grown, but his genitals that had shrunken more than they had before. In fact, he couldn´t feel anything there anymore.<br />
“Don´t worry, you won´t need it anymore.” Ty said with an almost evil grin. Before Dustin really thought about what Ty had just said, he felt his boxers grow warmer around his now empty area. It was only seconds before they felt hot enough to melt metal, and Dustin would have yelped in pain as they melted and merged into his body, before they grew rather cold a second later. Unable to look down, Dustin closed his eyes against the pain.<br />
Next the same heat started to built around his feet, as his socks also melted and merged with his flesh before growing cold. But when the pain had subdued Dustin noticed one thing with his feet, he could now feel the carpet under them rather clearly, as if his feet were flat and naked on the ground.<br />
Ty grinned at him as the cold that before was only in his feet and the empty crotch area started to expand between the to areas, slowly covering his whole legs. It wasn´t a numbing cold, just a coldness in general. After finishing with his legs the cold started climbing up his body, slowly cowering anything up to his neck, than down his arms.<br />
When only his head wasn´t cold Ty´s grin got even wider. “You look good so far, but I think your frame could be a bit leaner. After all, there won´t be much need for that bulk of muscles later anymore.” And then he laughed.<br />
Dustin didn´t notice much difference of what happened next as his arms, his legs and his torso grew slimmer and more agile. It felt a bit as if air was pressed out of them, but it was neither uncomfortable nor painful. Ty laughed even more at the question in Dustin´s eyes. “You don´t have a clue, don´t you? Well then, turn around to face the mirror.” <br />
As Dustin did so, a bit confused why his body reacted to that sentence but not to his own will, he gasped mentally at what he saw in the mirror. With wide eyes he looked on. His shirt now hung loosely from his slim shoulders, still only reaching down around half his torso, maybe just above his stomach, if he still had such. Instead of a flesh-colored human body everything beneath his neck was a metallic silver color. His feet now looked more like flat plates of metal, not even splitting in individual toes. Both his arms and legs looked more like pipes than limbs now, and what he saw of his lower body was just an egg like shape above his pipe-like legs, nothing indicating that there used to be his genitals or even a navel. His hands looked still mostly the same, just in silver metallic, and a bit pipe-like fingers on them.<br />
“Do you like your new body, Dustin? Maybe a bit more if you have fitting clothes?” Ty asked laughing at how Dustin´s eyes looked in horror. Suddenly Dustin´s shirt started to stretch over his metallic skin, expanding down his arms and legs until it covered everything from his neck down. Then it changed from a one-piece cloth cover into several individual parts. Around his feet the cloth turned into black leather, appearing as dress shoes. Out of them stretched white cotton socks, which vanished under a black dress pants. A black leather-belt formed around the area that had been his stomach before. Tucked into it was a white dress shirt, which was covered by a black smoking jacket, which traveled down his arms until just above his hands. They were covered in white gloves. Finally, around his neck formed a small blue band, which in front turned into a bow-tie. All in all, Dustin now looked like a tall butler.<br />
“You look great for your new role, Dustin. Only some small finishing touches left. What do you think?” Ty said, grinning like a loon. Dustin could move his mouth again, and it dropped open as he stood there speechless. It took more then five minutes that Ty waited patiently until Dustin finally found some words. “Ty, please. I don´t think I´m a good servant. Just change me back and we can work out together how to divide the chores and such.” Dustin plead.<br />
“Oh no, I didn´t plan on doing any chores anymore, Dustin. I will leave them all to you now. And I´m sure you will do them all happily.” Ty said, making the next wish. Before Dustin could say more, the coldness crept up his head, while not changing any color on it. His cheeks got a bit flatter, his nose and ears smaller. His hair turned into silk, but still resembled his normal hair, if a bit better cared for. What shocked Dustin even more was he had lost all control now, he couldn´t even blink anymore.<br />
When Dustin didn´t say anything for a minute, Ty smiled at him. “Nothing to say anymore, dear brother? Ah, it can´t be helped then. Let´s finish this and move on.” As much as he tried, Dustin was unable to respond to Ty. That was when he felt a repressing pressure on his brain, on of the last parts human in him. His insides had still been normal mostly, but now everything stopped working the human way. <br />
Becoming a full robot meant he didn´t need blood anymore, so it changed into either oil or cooling fluids in him. Veins changed to small pipes to transport these fluids. Organs turned mostly into cooling operators, with two exceptions. His heart changed into his new power source, something like a never emptying accumulator, while his brain changed into something like a set of memory chips and hard drives. As Dustin´s whole human being was pressed in one such drive with no connection to any commanding function he felt trapped even more. He could feel the new programming take hold after it was placed in the rest of the database his brain now resembled. He was completely helpless, but to further torture him, Ty had made sure he would still be able to use all his senses.</p>
