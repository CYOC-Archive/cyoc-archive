<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trevor straddled the stool, and watched his dog Attila do what it did best. Karl&#39;s weiner dog wasn&#39;t what he expected when Karl called him about getting a dog for Trevor to train as a sex hound. He recalled Karl&#39;s discomfort in talking about the subject then, and resolved to make his latest client squirm even more. So he sat there silent but incent. He liked to train people as well as animals.  The trick was being in control even when the animal or person didn&#39;t realize it was being controlled.  It, he thought as he looked at Karl, it had lots of money, and soon he would be forking over wheel barrow fills happily to Trevor his new best friend. He grinned a toothy grin, and his bulge doubled in size.<br />
<br />
Chad and Karl thought he getting off on the big dog mounting the little one. It was probably a factor, but it was part of Trevor&#39;s standard dog training. He saw it all the time. It didn&#39;t matter if the dog was going to be a sex hound or not, it would be humiliated and dominated by Atilla to break it before its training began. He even did it with dogs sent for only housebreaking training. Trevor liked breaking wills -animal and otherwise.<br />
<br />
He was smiling now because Karl who had been caught enjoying his tiny dog being ruined by Atilla was fixated on Trevor&#39;s bulge, and his own jeans were tented  Trevor&#39;s voice grew softer as he talked. As he expected, Kyle moved closer, and bent forward to hear better.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, um, I named my dog Chad to piss off your brother. I hope you um don&#39;t mind,&quot; said Kyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Karl, I figured that out when you first contacted me about training your new dog Chad, and you couldn&#39;t tell me your new dog&#39;s breed, size or anything. I don&#39;t have a problem with training any dog. As for Atilla mounting your dog, he does that with every dog. He&#39;s the pack Alpha, and the easiest way to train dogs is to first make them betas.  That&#39;s what Atilla does,  he turns other dogs into betas. Once they accept that they&#39;re owned they are trainable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, okay,  would you train Chad the same way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you heard about Atilla mounting my bro at the Lake?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Uh, well, uh I heard something...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently, Chad had been skinny dipping, and playing with his dog Bounder, and was lying on the dock sunning himself, when I arrived with Atilla. My dog mistook naked sleeping Chad because of Bounder&#39;s scent as a dog, and tried to mount him. They didn&#39;t knot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s thoughts typed on Karl&#39;s tablet, &quot;Yeah, right. Bounder was back at home that weekend. And my ass-hole bro admitted that he had been giving Atilla my dirty underwear to sniff for weeks to see how he would react to me. Yeah, right? Then every time after that, Atilla would hump my leg or jump up on me trying to get me down on the ground. Now he&#39;s got me just where he wanted. Ooooh, ahhh, owww fuck, I&#39;m sure Atilla knows just who the hell he is fucking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karl chuckled, &quot;So, Trevor, how would you treat this dog, if I told you that it really was your bro Chad transformed into a dog?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, a dog is dog. Why would I treat him any differently? Hell, if it really was Chad, I&#39;d probably be harder on it, just to make sure it was trained properly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;d have Atilla mount him daily?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, Atilla mounts all the dogs that I train daily. I&#39;d probably let Atilla mount Chad a dozen times a day, if he has time after mounting the other trainees. Heck,&quot; Trevor said grinning-he was getting off on the idea of his brother Chad being a dog for him to train, &quot;I&#39;d make sure Chad knew that I knew he was your dog and Atilla&#39;s bitch. I&#39;d have this photo made into a poster and hung in Chad&#39;s kennel during its training.&quot;<br />
<br />
He pulled a photo up on his phone of Chad naked in a kneeling sit up position on a wooden deck with Atilla and his big red erection trying to mount him.<br />
<br />
Karl gasped, &quot;Oh, my!&quot; Then he said, &quot;Wait you referred to Chad as it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I refer to all dogs that are bitched as it. Your Chad is a bitch now. Atilla bitched it. It is an it. Atilla has never been bitched, so he&#39;s a he. If my bro is dumb enough to let himself be turned into a dog, and gets bitched by Atilla, then he&#39;s a bitch, he&#39;s an it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if he were to become human again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once a bitch, always a bitch. Chad would be an it forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, I want you to train this dog, as if he were your dumb ass brother Chad. Make that poster, and kennel him- I mean it- with Atilla. And email me vids and pix of h-its training.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like wicked fun. I&#39;ll do it, and I won&#39;t even charge you extra.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor spun around on the stool to sit frontwards on it closer to the cage, so that Chad was staring in terror at his bulging crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you gotta see this Karl,&quot; Trevor said bodily repositioning Karl so that his head was resting in Trevor&#39;s lap, and he was staring sideways into Chad&#39;s cockeyed face. The dachshund was shivering in terror, and pleading with its eyes, as Atilla made it his bitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a good boy, Karl, thinking up this whole scam. Chad will freak when he sees your dog Chad reduced to Atilla&#39;s loving bitch, and he sees the training clips of me pretending that dumb dachshund is my dumb jock kid bro. This will be the best prank ever. He&#39;s gonna be 20 in June, I think the two of us should be able to get a birthday roast party together that will totally humiliate Chad. We&#39;ll have everyone bring gag gifts for a bitch dog: rhinestone dog collar in Chad&#39;s neck size, pink leash, big pink dog food bowls, a dog bed, crate, dog food, and more. We&#39;ll do a registry on Amazon, and include it in the invites to his friends and frenemies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Frenemies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Turk Tanner, Roger Crumb, and the like- you know, players from rival schools.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can manage some cool special effects that would make it look like Chad really changed into my dog,&quot; Karl said thinking of the video he made when his nanobots changed Chad from a man into his dachshund. <br />
<br />
&quot;No way! That&#39;s so cool. Chad will be so embarrassed! He&#39;ll be one totally whipped puppy!&quot; Trevor exclaimed happily.<br />
<br />
Chad whined mournfully. <br />
<br />
Karl suddenly realized that his head was resting against Trevor&#39;s warm damp crotch bulge. He tried to get up nonchalantly, but Trevor held him in place with one hand on his shoulder, and one massaging Karl&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
He murmured, &quot;You&#39;re a good boy, Karl,  yes you are, yes you are.&quot; Then he popped a chocolate mint into Karl&#39;s mouth. Karl almost snapped, &quot;I&#39;m not a dog!&quot; But he chewed his candy silently, as Trevor continued to stroke his head, and speak softly to him as they watched Atilla continue to ravage the helpless caged dachshund. Karl felt safe in Trevor&#39;s lap, and assured that he made the correct decision for Chad&#39;s training. He smiled.</p>
