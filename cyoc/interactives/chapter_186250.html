<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle woke up noticed the splatter of cum that he had left in his sheets and kicked them off for Joey or Benson to clean or shred.  He rolled out of bed and went to the shower enjoying the heft of his enhanced package as he walked across the room.  He quickly toweled off and got dressed noticing the new snugness to his pants as they accommodated his bigger dick.  <br />
<br />
Downstairs, he ran into an exhausted looking Mr. Smith still in his clown paint still working  to tidy up the splatters of cum, glitter, and other substances that littered the living room.  Kyle didn&#39;t want to deal with an exhausted Mr. Smith<br />
so he said, &quot;Wow, you look so well rested and the house is completely clean.   It&#39;s amazing how you had time to do all that and still make breakfast.&quot;  Instantly the room that had been in shambles from last night&#39;s party or orgy or crazed nightmare that Kyle created was now clean.  <br />
<br />
Kyle looked Mr. Smith up and down in his giant shoes and his stupid face paint and said, &quot;Now that the party is over, you no longer dress like a clown.  You look like you did when you left school yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instantly, Mr.  Smith was naked again but this time without the expanded feet or shoes.  Go on and get ready for school while I eat breakfast.  <br />
<br />
Mr. Smith wandered off around the house looking for his briefcase and Kyle went into the kitchen.  <br />
<br />
There, he saw Joey pouring coffee for Ben and Benson eating his breakfast out of a bowl on the floor, his large tongue lapping at the stuff.  <br />
<br />
Ben looked over at Kyle and said, &quot;That was a wild night. Get some food.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle did as Ben said and settled into the chair.  He looked over at Benson who was still happily gobbling up his kibble.  &quot;Wow, he&#39;s got an appetite.&quot; Kyle said with raised eyebrows.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to make sure he finished it all so I pumped out a load on top of his food.  It&#39;s his favorite.&quot; Ben said nonchalantly.  <br />
<br />
Kyle looked around for Blake but he hadn&#39;t come downstairs yet.  &quot;Where&#39;s Blake?&quot; He asked Ben.  &quot;Oh, he got up late after all the fun of his party.  He was hoping we could pick up a snack on the way to school.&quot;  Ben said absentmindedly touching himself as he thought of last night.  &quot;We should probably get going. We don&#39;t want to be late.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben got up called Mr. Smith and Blake downstairs.  <br />
Blake came trundling down in what looked like a sexier version of the cheerleading uniform, a kilt so short it looked like a miniskirt and a shirt that just barely covered his pecs.  <br />
<br />
Mr. Smith just said, &quot;Why do you have to dress like that?&quot; <br />
<br />
Blake shrugged and said, &quot;You know why silly.&quot; They both took lingering gazes to Kyle but neither said anything. It took Ben tossing the keys to the SUV to Jake for the moment to break.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s roll.  The school hates it when yall are late.&quot; He commanded.  <br />
<br />
Both men moved into action. Benson&#39;s leash was grabbed and Kyle went to get into the back seat.  Ben pushed him towards the front passenger side and then went to put Benson in the kennel.  Mr. Smith put the keys in the ignition, and in moments, this strange group began their trek to East Hampton high.  <br />
<br />
The car ride went quickly and Kyle wondered why they had made such a big deal about getting on the road early. His question was quickly answered when the pulled up to a stop sign next to a bus stop.  <br />
<br />
Kyle heard Blake&#39;s voice cry out to a man in a construction vest, &quot;Hey, wanna lay some pipe before you head into work? I can give you a free ride!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle looked behind him and noticed something odd.  All the seats except for the back row had been removed and Blake was hanging his scantily clad ass out the window to get the attention of the guy waiting for his bus.  Ben himself was holding a cellphone at the ready waiting to get the shot.  <br />
<br />
The guy didn&#39;t hesitate and opened the back door of the SUV.  Without pretense, Blake unzipped the guys jeans and began to suck him till he was hard.  Ben was busy filming and Kyle noticed that Mr.  Smith had his eyes locked on the rear view mirror.  Kyle didn&#39;t want to die in a  burning wreck caused by the hormones of a dad perving on his slutty son so he said to him, &quot;Pay attention to the road and drive safely.&quot; Mr.  Smith&#39;s eyes focused back on the road but his cock continued to leak pre under the steering wheel.  <br />
<br />
In a few moments, Blake was on his back getting absolutely pounded by the stranger.  Ben kept the camera rolling even when Blake had fished out his cock from the shorts he had put on to go to town and began to suck him off as the guy went to work.  <br />
<br />
The SUV pulled into the school parking lot and it was time to go.  Blake loaned loudly as the stranger finished inside of him.  Then like that, the man tossed a crumpled twenty and said thanks.  Ben picked up the cash and put it in his pocket.  He wished all of his boys well and went to take the driver&#39;s seat from Mr. Smith.  Blake unloaded Benson from his kennel in the back and adjusted his now slightly different school outfit.  <br />
<br />
Ben drove off with the stranger they had promised to take to work and Kyle, Blake, Benson, and Mr. Smith made their way into school.</p>
