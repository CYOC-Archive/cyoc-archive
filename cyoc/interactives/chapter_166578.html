<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ah….we can explain.” stated Damon as he looked at his friends who had now become merpeople, Ana and Tim where still embracing each other while Chloe looked ready to kill them. <br />
“Can we?” added Monica behind him. <br />
“YOU BETTER!!!” yelled Chloe at the top of her lungs.<br />
“What the hell is happening how is this possible!?” yelled Tim as he started to get a grip of what was happening, his brief time in the army taking over.<br />
“Well…we found this merbaby alone on the beach and then we turned into merpeople.” explained Monica as she pulled the still laughing baby close. <br />
“It may sound crazy but maybe it was some kind of magic?” stated Monica “Our…tails are the same as our swimsuits and that is what the baby saw.”<br />
 Damon wondering if that would be enough to answer their questions. It wasn’t.<br />
“SO TURN US BACK NOW!” yelled Chloe as she showed her famous anger, of all their friends she was the hot head, in inclined to fight and rebel and was extremely passionate. “I have a date tonight with Sarah and I am not going to go to it in a fish tank.”<br />
“We don’t have any answers….” Said Damon as he lowered his head, his forehead almost touching the sand. “We where trying to get to the water, so we weren’t found and ended up in some laboratory.”<br />
“Maybe that isn’t a bad idea.” Said Ana “Doctors will help us? I know a few of them.”<br />
“Or rip off scales and take us apart alive to figure out what happened?” added Monica as she looked at the baby who was still all smiles. “Once they find out it was the baby who did this then who knows what they will do to it…”<br />
“If merpeople are real…” started Tim before he noticed everyone was looking at him. “Ok…we know Merpeople are real, then maybe they can turn us back?”<br />
“How do we find them?” inquired Ana, she look like a dumb blonde cheerleader type of girl but she was a nurse and even she knew what would likely happen if they tried to go to a hospital in their state.<br />
“Not on the beach.” Stated Chloe as she took charge and began to drag herself toward the ocean.<br />
“We better get to the water before more people find us.” Stated Damon as he took the baby and began to move forward, moments later Monica joined him. The last ones to move where Tim and Ana and they had the longest distance to travel. <br />
The first to reach the water was Chloe, she was lucky she had been closer to the water’s edge then anyone else so had the least distance to travel. Everyone watched as Chloe pushed her way into the water diving her head into the surf and then she disappeared into the water once she was far enough in. <br />
Damon and Monica reached the water next along with the child, it was strange the water was slapping their faces, but it felt a kin to a strong wind not hard water. Taking a risk, Damon stuck his head under the water and took a breath, he thought his brain would try to force him to hold his breath but instead it felt cool and welcoming compared to how hot and dry it felt on land. It felt so strange to have water come into his body going down into his lungs and then coming out of his gills located on his sides. Monica was having a similar feeling as she pulled the baby close as they began to float. Once that happened each of them gave powerful kicks and shot forward into the water with ease. <br />
The beach was shallow for maybe 200 yards, being about deep enough to full submerge yourself before it went down into deeper water. It took only seconds to cover the 200 yards as Damon and Monica arrived at the edge of an underwater cliff which went down to deeper water. Floating there was Chloe, her rich brown hair down around her shoulder blades not floating up like it normally would with her hands crossed over her chest waiting like any angry woman would. Damon turned to see Monica’s hair was doing the same, it was as if it was weighed. He assumed his was the same. That was when he noticed he could see crystal clear under the water, he swam to the edge and looked toward the deeper water. He could see through it as if it was air, seeing schools of fish in the distance and even a pod of dolphins nearby.  <br />
“Wow…” said Damon as his voice carried normally under the water.<br />
“Yes, it is all pretty if you ignore all the human trash all around.” stated Chloe as she wrinkled her noise, He also saw some human trash on the bottle, beer bottles and the like. “And we where just here a week ago cleaning the beach. I can even smell it, how can I smell stuff underwater.” <br />
“So what now?” inquired Monica as the baby began to swim around them playfully.<br />
“Yes, what now.” added Ana as she and Tim came up, both of them looking similar with the same blue shade of tails however Ana looked like your classic blonde cheerleader type while Tim was muscular from his four years in the army with deep dark skin which could never tan. <br />
“Well…I guess we have to find another mermaid or merman.” stated Damon <br />
“Any idea where to start?” inquired Tim <br />
“None.” admitted Damon</p>
