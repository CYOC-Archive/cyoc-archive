<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That day had started so playful and peacefully. There had been enough time for Melissa and Red 6 to have gotten close, and just that morning they let Ronald use his powers to let Red 6 and Melissa play as dogs in the room. He had kept their minds the same like always and just let them have fun as he tossed a ball around for them to race to catch. Having returned them to normal the three of them and the woman behind the name Oracle had a nice lunch... Of course it happened when the lady who can see anything was distracted... <br />
<br />
It came from an underground bunker that was teleported into the middle of New York. It was quite a large bunker too holding a few hundred people with some sort of super-tech armor and powers that seemed to be tailored for destruction. It wasn&#39;t very subtle so Melissa and Oracle ran back to Defender&#39;s tower, but Red 6 and Twister needed to do something. Twister had been nanny to the most active magical girl unit, and to be effective at healing he had to get used to some amount of combat and learn a few tricks. Such as making his body&#39;s skin into something similar to an insect&#39;s carapace, but scaled to that of a human so he could get close enough to incapacitate someone through removing their limbs or the like. Still against the enemies they were going up against like the guy who could make air explode getting close enough for Twister to do anything to them was hard. Red 6 with a little bit more range was able to wrap them up with her bows, but still they both ended up taking severe injuries with each encounter. A limb torn off here or an intestinal tract ripped out there didn&#39;t physically matter thanks to Twister&#39;s effective healing, but it was mentally exhausting. Along with just the sound of battle and screams everywhere else. Who knew where the rest of the squad was, but Twister and Red 6 had found their way close to the bunker thanks to their last victim who was currently tied up like ham with Red&#39;s ribbons and was in Twister&#39;s head transformation. Essentially they were just a head with a sack of all necessary organs where the neck was supposed to be, and Twister was the guy carrying the monstrosity. <br />
One slamming the head to the retinal scan into the bunker later, and the pair managed to get in and with some hope get to the mastermind. One weakness Oracle had was not being able to see where she didn&#39;t know where to look at, but finding people within a villain&#39;s complex in the middle of New York was not a problem. With intel from Oracle on enemy positions, and the area being more enclosed Red and Twister were functioning a lot better. The only issue came that they kinda left bodies on their way out so an alarm was quickly sounded. <br />
What made things a lot harder for both was with a fight against a teleporter with a gun, and an invisible person who made their presence known by thwaking Twister unconscious... Which allowed the teleporter to get close enough to Twister to teleport the three of them away somewhere else. Red quickly told Oracle what happened and then had to retreat, Twister&#39;s victims bodies twisted as Twister himself was abducted. <br />
<br />
What happened next where Twister is concerned is when his unconscious body was brought to table and restrained, and then the mastermind of the New York attack walked up upon his subject. &quot;Subject Twister, has the ability to change the physical body of anyone within a certain range. Seems to require knowledge that the being is within range though. The ability itself is sufficient and any massive tampering will likely show  negative effects. Will go through some recent memory modifications and additions, should be what we need to give him a proper motive.&quot; The mastermind stopped dictating and started his modification. <br />
<br />
To Twister it was like a weird dream. He was back as Ronald as he was being offered a deal by Oracle. &quot;Go ahead and commit suicide right now. Or the Bitch gets it.&quot; as behind her a monitor flipped open showing Melissa bound and gagged in red ribbons as she seemed to have been tortured by the magical girls. Ronald&#39;s muddled mind wanted him to say something and then there was a *snap* as one of the ribbons tightened just a little too much and twisted Melissa&#39;s head a little too much. <br />
Red 6&#39;s voice came from the monitor &quot;Umm... Sorry Oracle... Still learning...&quot; <br />
&quot;Damnit Red! I suppose we just have to make it look like a suicide anyways. He&#39;s much too powerful to-&quot;<br />
Ronald then felt a hand on his leg as he was teleported to a weird room, and two young adults appeared with one touching Ronald&#39;s leg. In front of the three was a bald man in a wheelchair who said &quot;Glad we got you out of there. The Defenders are quite the bad guys aren&#39;t they?&quot; <br />
&quot;They.... They killed my dog...&quot; Ronald said as his dream awareness was muddled. <br />
&quot;Yes, they&#39;ve done so much evil. They even have a mad scientist create wacky inventions for them. I am Dr. Omater this is my little institute. We investigate the Defenders and are planning on exposing and rooting out their evils. Will you join us?&quot;<br />
&quot;I Will destroy them!&quot; Ronald&#39;s  memory said with a passion.  Some memories got erased and others were added such as him being shown all the evidence that there was not a single Defender who wasn&#39;t evil... the memory of Ronald and Omater burning all the evidence to not be caught with it... and the memories of him using his powers in ways he hadn&#39;t actually ever used it. <br />
<br />
Ronald woke up after Omater&#39;s memory manipulation and said &quot;Omater what happened?&quot; <br />
The mastermind said &quot;Our strike failed, the members we sent weren&#39;t strong enough... and they were blamed for it all.&quot; he started tearing up and said &quot;Look how the news portrays us and now they are going to brainwash those poor souls.&quot;<br />
Ronald got up and patted Omater on the back and said &quot;We&#39;ll get them next time... It&#39;s my fault as well... My morals on the human form... So many of them would&#39;ve been better off with those modification ideas you had! So many Powers aren&#39;t designed to be best used by human forms. I&#39;ll do it, and we&#39;ll destroy the Defenders!&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile back at the Magical Girl room at the Defender&#39;s headquarters there was an Oracle looking everywhere for Ronald, Red 6 was resting her body on the couch, and Melissa was curled up depressed on the other side of the couch. The once dog wanting her owner to come back, and was only more sad knowing he is probably in danger.</p>
