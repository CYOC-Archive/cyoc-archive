<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I know,” Dustin said.  “You should be the champion at twisting your arm around.  Give it a try.”<br />
<br />
Ty was still getting used to his body being Silly Putty and was not yet able to fully control his capabilities other than what were human experiences.  “Dustin, come over here and get the arm started so that I can get a sensation of what it takes to make it happen.”<br />
<br />
With that, Dustin came over and grabbed Ty’s clenched fist and started to rotate his arm.  Once again, Dustin started slowly and watched Ty’s face to make sure that he was not hurting him.<br />
<br />
After about the fifth rotation, Ty said “You can let go now, I have the sensation of what it takes to make it happen.”<br />
<br />
With that, Dustin let go of Ty’s hand and it continued to rotate.  At the same time, Ty started twisting his other arm at the same time.  A few seconds later, he raised his right leg off of the floor and started rotating it as well.  Dustin was standing there in awe at what he saw his brother doing.  After a few more minutes, Ty stopped rotating his limbs and stood there looking at himself in the mirror.  His arms looked like a machine bolt he had twisted them so much.  Ty concentrated again and his arms and leg returned to their original shape.<br />
<br />
“Dustin,” Ty said.  “Come over here and hit me in the stomach as hard as you can.”<br />
<br />
“You are in good shape Ty, but not THAT good of shape,” Dustin said.<br />
<br />
“Remember, that was flesh and blood shape,” Ty said.  “Better yet, so that you do not hurt your hand, use the baseball bat in the closet.”<br />
<br />
Dustin went over to the closet and got out the baseball bat that Ty had used when playing a pick-up game of ball and approached Ty.  When he had almost reached Ty, he tripped over Ty’s shoes left in the middle of the floor.  Dustin fell into Ty and they both ended up on the floor.  After Dustin got his bearings as to what had just happened, he noticed that he was lying on top of Ty.<br />
<br />
“Are you alright?” Ty asked.<br />
<br />
“Yea,” Dustin said.  “I think so.  And you?”<br />
<br />
“Fine,” Ty replied.<br />
<br />
With that, Dustin stood back on his feet and just stared down at Ty.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong?” Ty asked.<br />
<br />
“Look at yourself,” Dustin said.<br />
<br />
He walked over to the door mirror and adjusted the door so that Ty could see himself.  Ty saw that his upper and lower torso were somewhat flattened by the weight of Dustin on top of him.  He also saw that both of his knees had been bent underneath him when he landed and they were flat as well.<br />
<br />
Ty laughed.  “It is a good thing that I am Silly Putty, or I would be in a world of hurt.  You hit the family jewels when you landed on me.  Come over here and give me a hand to get off of the bat that I am laying on top of.”<br />
<br />
Ty concentrated and restored his legs to their original condition so that he could stand.  Dustin come over and grabbed onto Ty’s hand to help him up.  Instead, the arm started stretching.  Remembering the properties of Silly Putty, Dustin gave a quick yank and helped Ty to his feet.  Ty turned around to see the bat that was still stuck in his back.  During the time that they were on the floor, his body had started to wrap itself around the bat.<br />
<br />
“I’ll help you get that out,” Dustin said.<br />
<br />
“No,” Ty said.  “Just for fun, push it through.  I want to see what it feels like to have an object completely through me.”<br />
<br />
Dustin just stood there trying to comprehend what his brother had just said.<br />
<br />
“It doesn’t hurt, Dustin,” Ty said.  “Just do it.”<br />
<br />
Dustin came over and positioned the bat and pushed it through Ty’s torso so that the grip was sticking out the front and the remainder of the bat was sticking out his back. Ty walked over to the mirror and was laughing at the image in the mirror.  Dustin on the other hand still couldn’t believe what he saw.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Ty said.  “Could you come in front of me and push the bat through me to remove it?  Dustin?  Dustin, snap out of it.”<br />
<br />
Dustin grinned.  It wasn’t everyone that could say that they put their hand through their brother and didn’t hurt them.  Dustin came over in front of Ty and started pushing the bat through.  He got to the point to just before his hand entered Ty’s body and hesitated.  He looked up at Ty and continued to push the bat through until his hand came out Ty’s back.  He dropped the bat.  The feeling of the putty on his arm that was put through his brother was a weird sensation.  Before he started to pull his arm out, he decided to have some fun and started expanding the hole as he pulled his arm out.  By the time he got his arm out, Ty’s torso was so extended that he could have put a bowling ball through the hole.  Dustin stepped back and started laughing.<br />
<br />
Ty took off his jeans to see what the full damage of the fall had been.  He looked in the mirror and tried to concentrate, but Dustin’s laughter was distracting him.<br />
<br />
Dustin noticed that he had hit Ty in the family jewels and that they were nowhere to be seen.  This caused Dustin to start rolling on the floor with laughter.<br />
<br />
Ty grinned.  “Why am I having all of this fun with nobody to share the experience?  I wish Dustin’s body had the properties of Silly Putty just like mine.”<br />
<br />
Dustin had heard the wish that Ty had made and immediately stopped laughing.  He got up off of the floor and looked at Ty.<br />
<br />
“Dustin,” Ty said.  “It is a good thing that you aren’t wearing a shirt either, because you are going to share in the experience that I am having.”<br />
<br />
During the time it took for Dustin’s change to take place, Ty had time to concentrate and return his body to the original condition before the fall.</p>
