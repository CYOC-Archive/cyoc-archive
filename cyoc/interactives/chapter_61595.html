<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On the way to the shoe department, Ty noticed all of the shocked stares his friend Jake was getting.  This was <br />
the first time he'd made someone so unusually big and let other people notice; and were they noticing!<br />
<br />
Jake blushed and mumbled shyly as several girls - and a few boys - casually slipped him papers with their <br />
phone numbers on them.  Ty grinned at seeing his friend, who could probably tear walls down at that size, turn <br />
so red.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get it, already.&quot;  Jake grumbled as they both plopped down on benches by the shoe racks.  &quot;I'm big.  And <br />
what's with those sales girls staring at me like they've never seen me before?  I've practically been living <br />
in a clothing store for the last year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Huffing, Jake winced when his deep breaths caused a visible tear to rip his t-shirt at the collar.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we both need new shirts, too.&quot;  He said ruefully.  &quot;Oh, shut up.&quot;  He grinned and shoved Ty playfully <br />
when he saw his friend laughing at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder if they have any purple pants...&quot; Ty rubbed his chin in mock thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO Hulk jokes!&quot;  Jake protested, fighting to give Ty a stern, scary expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or Jake smash?&quot;  Ty asked innocently, sending both boys into peals of laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you two?&quot;  An older clerk asked, drawn over by all the noise.  She quickly looked their feet over <br />
and snorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You,&quot; she pointed at Ty with a friendly scolding expression, &quot;should know better than to try wearing last <br />
year's shoes at your age.  I'm surprised your toes haven't turned blue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty casually considered wishing his toes blue, then thought better of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you...&quot; she growled lowly at Jake before beaming and actually pinching his cheek.  &quot;Good seeing you <br />
Jake.&quot;  She laughed at his expression.  &quot;At least your shoes lasted a few months this time.  Maybe you're <br />
slowing down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so.&quot;  Jake said, smiling.  &quot;It'd be nice to actually wear out a few things, instead of blowing them <br />
up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bite your tongue!&quot;  The older woman clucked playfully as she unlocked a nearby closed cabinet and pulled out <br />
an extremely large shoe box.  &quot;You should see my bonus checks this year; I should give you a percentage!  Take <br />
these, would you dear?&quot; she asked Jake.  &quot;We ordered ahead for the next size last month, when your parents <br />
called.  Can't have our new mascot going around barefoot!&quot;<br />
<br />
While his friend tried on his new shoes, Ty watched the saleswoman bring over a board with some sliders on it <br />
and set it on the floor in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name's Glinda.&quot;  She told him kindly, then laughed.  &quot;My parents both loved the 'Wizard of Oz'.  And I <br />
can't tell you how many times I've heard the 'tap your shoes' line in my lifetime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grinning, Ty followed the woman's instructions as she had him slip off his small sandals and put his foot on <br />
the board.  With easy, professional motions, Glinda manipulated the sliders and jotted down a few numbers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eleven wide.&quot;  She declared, giving Ty a wink.  &quot;Finally an easy customer.  We actually MAKE your size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot;  Jake protested weakly as Glinda wandered off.<br />
<br />
Ty decided he loved this store; if only because it seemed like his last wish had made Jake a regular, and lots <br />
of the staff seemed to like teasing him.<br />
<br />
Maybe, he thought, he could do a little teasing of his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that whenever Glinda brings me a pair of shoes to try, my feet will get bigger or smaller so they <br />
don't fit right.&quot;  Ty wished quietly.  He could always turn the wish off after a few tries.<br />
<br />
And not a moment too soon; Glinda was back with a pair of Elevens in the size Ty had requested.  Immediately, <br />
Ty felt an odd tingle in his feet.  Looking down, he watched his toes seem to stretch out across the floor, <br />
going from the shorter toes he was used to to the long, skinny ones he saw on some people's feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try these on, dear.&quot;  The nice sales lady ordered as she turned to ask Jake some questions about how his <br />
shoes fit.<br />
<br />
Grinning, Ty slipped into the new sandals, only to feel the tips of his toes slip over the front and touch the <br />
carpet before his heals had gotten past the back.  Seeing him stop, Glinda quickly put his foot back down and <br />
remeasured.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirteen regular.&quot;  She muttered, her eyebrows knitting in confusion.  &quot;I could have sworn your foot was <br />
lined up correctly...&quot;<br />
<br />
Shrugging, Ty watched in amusement as Glinda picked up the pair and hurried off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirteen, huh?&quot;  Jake asked, putting his old pair of shoes in the box and hopping up to bounce his feet a <br />
little.  &quot;That's pretty big.&quot;  He commented casually, smirking.<br />
<br />
Ty snorted as he looked over at his friend's shoes; he could probably stand on top of those with his heels at <br />
Jake's ankles, and his toes still wouldn't be close to the ends; Jake's HANDS could probably fill a size <br />
thirteen shoe!<br />
<br />
&quot;Right...&quot; Ty answered sarcastically as he felt his feet start to tingle again.  This time, he watched as they <br />
got both shorter and narrower, shrinking past the size he walked in with, though still easily bigger than they <br />
were when he woke up that morning.<br />
<br />
Glinda was almost beside herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am SO sorry.&quot;  She apologized picking up the sandals as Ty's feet swam around in them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand it,&quot; she muttered, as she carefully lined Ty's foot up and held it in place.  &quot;I've been <br />
doing this for YEARS.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking pity on the poor woman, Ty decided to just end his fun early and wished his feet back to normal.  <br />
Sighing as he felt them stretch out over the cool wooden board, Ty made sure that Glinda and Jake didn't <br />
notice or care about the change.<br />
<br />
With a nod, Glinda went off and came back at record speed; she was clearly trying to make up for her mistakes.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you go, dear.&quot;  She passed over the box.  &quot;Eleven and a half wide.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;  Ty asked, blinking.  He quickly thought back.  &quot;I thought I was an eleven.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what your newest shoes are?&quot;  Glinda asked as she got up.  &quot;I'd better go get you a new pair of those <br />
as well; if you want them that is.  They might not be pinching yet, but having properly sized shoes is <br />
especially important when your feet are still growing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah.&quot;  Ty answered, distracted.  The sandals fit perfectly.  That meant if Glinda HAD measured correctly <br />
the first time, his feet had grown while he was sitting there!<br />
<br />
Taking their purchases, both boys stood and thanked Glinda for her time.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was no trouble dears.&quot;  She smiled and gave Jake another pinch.  She had to really reach up.  &quot;See you <br />
soon, hon.  Don't dent the door on your way out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake just mumbled something in reply.  Ty grinned.</p>
