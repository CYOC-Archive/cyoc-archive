<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;They were from a fox,&quot; Justin thought to himself as his mother opened the front door, holding several of the bags and he realised that he did know what kind of animal the tail and ears that were attached to the onesie went to.<br />
<br />
Unsure how he knew this and why it was important, Justin mentally shrugged it off as he entered the house and followed Mandy into the living room. Flopping down on the couch, his mind preoccupied with other thoughts, including his almost insistence on having a kid's meal for lunch, Justin barely paid any attention to the programme Mandy was watching, only that it seemed interesting enough to pass the time. As the cartoon mouse on the television pleaded with some bird that might have been an owl, Justin let his mind wander.<br />
<br />
Thinking over his behaviour in the department store, he found himself at a lost as to why he suddenly had an interest in dolls, wearing girl's clothes and wanting to play dress-up and pretend with Mandy. Nor could he understand why it was that he could actually fit into a swimsuit that was clearly intended for somebody much younger then himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I put your clothes away,&quot; his mother suddenly announces as she walked through the living room and telling her, &quot;Thanks,&quot; in a distracted way, he wondered if maybe he had hit his head or if there was something wrong with him.<br />
<br />
As the television programme ended and another came on, this one with talking horses that were all sorts of bright colours, Justin started to wonder something. After a moment, he stood, noted that Mandy was too engrossed in what she was watching and listening, he heard his mother doing something in her office. Knowing his father wouldn't be home for another couple of hours, he figured that this would be the best time that he got any sort of privacy as he exited the living room and headed upstairs.<br />
<br />
Making the bathroom his first stop, he peered into the mirrors over the sink, attempting to see if anything about him looked different. When it became apparent that his appearance still remained the same, Justin exited the bathroom and headed for his room.<br />
<br />
Pushing open the door, he thought that something about his room did appear off, but what it was, he couldn't place it. Opening various drawers on his dresser, he took in that except for his underwear and pyjamas, all his clothes looked like the normal clothes a fifteen year old boy would wear. Turning away from the dresser, he thought for a moment, decided, &quot;It must be something in the clothes,&quot; and starting to walk back and forth, he tried to come up with a reason as to why somebody who had no desire to be the opposite sex and gender would suddenly want something like that.<br />
<br />
When he found that he find no connection and no reason, Justin gave up and flopping down on his bed, he curled up into a fetal position and hugged Kitty close, his feelings in turmoil as he did not want to be a girl, but did not really understand why it was that he kept trying to act like one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it does have something to do with clothes,&quot; he thought as he sat up and hugged his Hello Kitty plush close to his body.<br />
<br />
Deciding that the best way to test this theory was to get some clothes for a girl, besides those his mother had bought, he sat for a moment, trying to think of where he could get some girl's clothes besides a store, coming slowly to the conclusion that by trying on something more appropriate for the opposite sex and gender, he could either prove or disprove that by wearing girl's clothing, it was turning him into a girl and making him want to be a girl.<br />
<br />
Completely turned around in his thinking, creating more and more excuses as he lost the train of thought he originally started with as his ideas become wilder and more far-fetched, Justin tossed aside Kitty and standing, figured the best place to get something only a girl would wear was from either Mandy or his mother.<br />
<br />
Hurriedly exiting his room, Justin paused for a moment and when it became clear that everyone was downstairs at the moment, he made a quick beeline for the guest room. Stepping inside, he thought for a moment and after deciding, he walked toward the dresser Mandy's clothes were kept in. Opening various drawers at random, finding he suddenly knew which articles of clothing would look appealing together. Selecting a one-piece, long sleeved underwear that he knew would look like was wearing a long sleeved shirt when worn, Justin then choose a pair of blue, cotton bib overalls and a pair of socks.<br />
<br />
Leaving, he headed back for his room and pausing in the doorway, he tried to place what about his room looked off, taking in the white carpet and the pinkish-white walls as he looked about. Unable to figure out what it was that appeared to be off, but sure that something was, he closed the door, tossed the clothing onto the bed and began to undress, suddenly feeling like he would be much more comfortable in the clothes he had borrowed from Mandy.<br />
<br />
Naked, he picked up the one-piece underwear and after thinking for a couple seconds, he tucked his penis and testicle between his tags as he pulled on the underwear. When a sharp pain in his tailbone caused him to nearly shriek out in pain, Justin paused, unsure why he was suddenly having pains, but knowing for reason that it was because the one-piece was pinching something he couldn’t quite see. Reaching back, he started to adjust the white one-piece underwear, the pain alternating between getting worse and letting up depending on what he was doing. When he finally had the underwear in a comfortable manner, he paused to try and think why it was that he was having pains in his tailbone, but at a lost as to why.<br />
<br />
Absently, he rubbed a hand over his tailbone and when he realised what he was doing, and that there was clearly nothing wrong with that area of his body, Justin mentally shrugged and for a moment, considered taking off the one-piece. Instead he reached for the bib overalls and pulling them on, he was once again greeted by a sharp pain in his tailbone.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;What the hell,&quot; as he pulled on the overalls the rest of the way, shifting them about until they were comfortable to wear, he decided that what he need was a mirror and grabbing the socks, he exited his room and headed for the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Inside, he pulled on the socks and standing once again before the mirror, he peered at his reflection, unsure if he was more amazed that Mandy's clothes actually fit and where kind of baggy on him or by the fact that they for some reason made him look more like a girl. Turning about, Justin attempted to see the seat of his pants, but when he found that he really couldn't unless he was up higher, he turned back around and started to climb up onto the sink.<br />
<br />
As he did so, Justin caught sight of something out of the corner of his eye just as he was starting to once again turnabout and pausing, he leaned his head closer to the mirror. As he peered into the reflective object, he ran a hand over his ears, which, if he didn't know better, he could swear that they appeared to be have a slight point to them and were a couple inches higher.<br />
<br />
Blinking, Justin dropped his hand and for a moment thought, &quot;This is a mistake. I should just return the clothes,&quot; as he wondered what his mother would do if she caught him wearing Mandy's clothes.<br />
<br />
Instead of climbing down from the sink, he shifted about until he was turned around and then gasped in surprise at what he saw, unsure of when it had happened, but knowing that both his mother and his cousin were going to mad when they found out that he had ripped a hole in the seat of the bib overalls. Touching the tear, he noted that it didn't appear to be torn at all and instead looked as if the pants, and the one-piece underwear, had been designed with the hole already in place.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;Great. If I didn't know any better, I would swear that I am turning into some sort of girl with pointed ears and a tail,&quot; as he slid off the sink.<br />
<br />
As he took one last look in the mirror, taking in his short black hair, his pale face and the fact that his ears did indeed have more of a point to them, Justin sighed and decided that what he really wanted was to get out of these clothes and back into his old ones. Opening the door to the hallway, he had only taken one step before his mother's voice called out, &quot;What are you doing, Tama? I thought I told you to take a nap,&quot; and looking in the direction of his mother, Justin suddenly found himself being taken by the hand and led back to his room before he could even register what his mother had just called him.</p>
