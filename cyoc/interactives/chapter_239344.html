<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I forgot to mention that Mona&#39;s torsos that are conjoined with Mrs. Johnson also have her succubus traits (wings, horns, tail), but will proceed while assuming that was implied.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Is it normal for these changes I&#39;m making to myself to affect you too?&quot; Mona asked, suddenly a bit concerned over whether you were okay with what was happening.<br />
<br />
Shrugging three pairs of shoulders, you answered, &quot;Dunno, this is my first time being merged with someone else.&quot;  Tracing your fingers across your tripled pussy, you added, &quot;Not that I mind, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...  I wonder if it works both ways?&quot; the succubus mused.<br />
<br />
Silently wondering the same thing yourself, you asked, &quot;As in, whether changes about me would affect you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  I mean, it would make sense, right?&quot; your bodymate confirmed.<br />
<br />
Grinning with three mouths and two lipples, you offered, &quot;Well, we can try it and find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Licking her lips, Mona agreed, &quot;Mmm, I like the sound of that.&quot;  Needing no further invitation, you took the phone and selected yourself as the target, then generated a new sentence.  However, you were a little put out that it barely pertained to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;This hermaphrodite is staring at Mona&#39;s eye-nipples on Mary&#39;s bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peeking at the screen, Mona played at being offended, &quot;Hey, it&#39;s not polite to stare!&quot;  At first, you were a little startled and were just about to apologize before she burst out laughing.  &quot;Haha, just kidding.  To be honest, they also seem a bit weird to me,&quot; she said calmly.  Speaking with the head on her other torso attached to you, she added, &quot;Like, I&#39;m afraid of massaging her breasts because I might poke my eyes... or worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe we can do something about that then,&quot; you suggested, wiggling the phone in your hand a bit to illustrate your point.<br />
<br />
Snapping her fingers with one of her twelve hands, she answered, &quot;True!  What if we tried changing it to &#39;heads&#39; so that I&#39;ll still be able to see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me a sec... aaaaand, done,&quot; you declared, submitting the change.  As reality changed again, you could see that the eyes were gone from Mary&#39;s breasts, replaced instead with more lipples.  To compensate, she now had two copies of Mona&#39;s head on her shoulders, one on each side of her own noggin.  Curious to know whether it affected Mona any other way, you looked at her real body to see that she now had three heads, each grinning widely about the successful change.  As you began to expect, the modifications propagated to all her other parasite forms, with Erika&#39;s Mona-dicks having three heads each, and your own bodymates getting tripled heads as well.<br />
<br />
Speaking with her three heads in sync on your left torso, she remarked, &quot;&quot;&quot;Nice, now our forms are starting to look really similar, eh?&quot;&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t deny that, though this didn&#39;t really answer our original question,&quot; you replied, still curious whether changes to you would affect her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s try again then, shall we?&quot; she eagerly offered.  Generating yet another new statement, you received one that was very much about you this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;This hermaphrodite is using her numerous prehensile tongues to pleasure her other bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you were puzzling over how to modify this sentence, you felt one of Mona&#39;s spade-tipped tails wrap around your thigh, reminding you of the demonic features on your bodymate.  Getting some tails of your own might be fine, but that might not be different enough to change Mona&#39;s body, either.  Several moments later, a significantly lewder idea came to mind, and you decided to roll with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;This hermaphrodite is using her numerous prehensile cock-tails to pleasure her other bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
After accepting the edit, you suddenly gasped as you felt innumerable new cocks penetrating your mouths and vaginas throughout the limitless house.  Using your other clones to get a better look at yourself, you could see no fewer than nine fleshy, inch-and-a-half wide tubes of flesh emerging from the back of your waist.  As the prehensile cocks wriggled around on their own whenever you weren&#39;t directly willing them to move, it was difficult to accurately measure their length, but you figured they must have been at least five feet long.<br />
<br />
However, you didn&#39;t *just* have nine cock-tails.  Looking at your conjoined backsides, you saw that nine similar but lavender appendages were growing our from the base of each of Mona&#39;s backs around her original tails.  Her real body also had eighteen of them between her two torsos, which were already busy inserting themselves in any hole they could find among anyone with her in the kitchen.  Likewise, Erika&#39;s crotches proved to be an interesting sight, with a total of thirty-six spaghetti-thin, three-foot-long writhing cocks coming out from the backsides of her succubus dicks.  Even Mary was affected this time as nine of those lavender-skinned phalluses grew out from her backside to supplement her tentacles.<br />
<br />
Clearly, the new penises were doing their job well as you felt several billion of your duplicates orgasm as their crowds of shared cocks ejaculated in each other&#39;s mouths and pussies.  After you rapidly multiplied, Mona&#39;s mind seemed blown after her first experience having nine zeroes added to the total number of bodies she had.  &quot;Wow, is it always like this when you split into more clones?&quot; she asked in a daze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Usually, unless I have far fewer bodies,&quot; you replied, no longer phased by the sensory bombardments, but still very much turned on by them.<br />
<br />
Confused, she asked, &quot;What, are you able to reduce how many copies you have or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Smirking, you didn&#39;t say anything and instead had one of your duplicates start massaging your breasts from behind.  As your flesh started sinking into your other self, you envisioned Mona&#39;s breasts getting larger.  After you finished merging, you said, &quot;Look at your chests.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow, did they get bigger from that?&quot; she questioned, cupping all twelve of her breasts and squeezing them various ways.  Seeing you nod in triplicate, she played with her boobs for a few more moments before requesting, &quot;...Can we do that again?&quot;<br />
<br />
This time, you had four of yourselves join in fondling you as you crowded around yourself, aiming for a much bigger growth this time.  Once you finished combining, the breasts on either of Mona&#39;s torsos attached to you had J-cups to match your own.  Seeing how enamored with them she was, you proceeded to mirror the process with the rest of your clones, causing all of the Monas to have the same, massive breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmph, is this why your vaginas and breasts feel so much more sensitive than mine do?&quot; the succubus asked, starting to piece a few things together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup,&quot; you answered simply before offering, &quot;Would you like the same treatment?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would I?&quot; Your bodymate asked before exclaiming, &quot;Hell yeah!&quot;<br />
<br />
Setting to work, you repeatedly absorbed your copies in large groups, gradually thinning out your absurd numbers as you made Mona&#39;s torsos more sensitive.  At her request, you made her tongues twice as long as yours and gave her two more in each mouth.  Seeing as she also lacked any cocks above her pussies, she asked if you could give her five clitorises, to which you readily acquiesced.  Suddenly, she came up with an idea you never thought of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, do you think it&#39;s possible to make my clits longer?&quot; Mona asked before two of her heads whispered in your ears, &quot;&quot;Just think of how fun it would be to insert one of those into your clone&#39;s pussy.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Admittedly curious and turned on by the thought, you decided to give it a shot.  Sure enough, the demoness&#39; clits grew about a quarter of an inch longer after you merged with yourself.  When you asked how long she wanted them, Mona replied that six inches should be a good trial length, so you set about merging yourselves until the target was reached.  After everything was finished, you had been reduced to a mere 1,486 bodies, each one shuddering with pleasure as your bodymate experimentally stroked her abnormally long clitorises.<br />
<br />
As she looked over her torsos that were conjoined with you and compared them against her unaltered real body, she pouted, &quot;Too bad I can&#39;t do that with my own body...&quot;</p>
