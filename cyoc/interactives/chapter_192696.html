<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cody went back to sit on the table, where his parents were eating. Jayce was eating a big burrito and his dad was eating sandwich. They offered a piece of their food to Cody, but he wasn&#39;t feeling hungry so he rejected their offer.<br />
<br />
On the table next to them, Cody could hear the voices of two girls. Discretely, he turned to look at them, seeing a brunette girl and a light blonde girl about the same age, that is, around their early twenties.<br />
<br />
The light blonde girl had a slender body and freckles on her arms and face. She had a small mouth but with thick lips, a droopy nose, and thin eyebrows. Her long curly hair got to her hips. She wasn&#39;t voluptuous. Her butt was small, but even if she tried to accentuate it by wearing skin tight jeans, and her breasts were an A-cup. Besides the jeans, she was a pink crop top with floral patterns.<br />
<br />
The brunette girl had a thicker figure, but just by a bit. She had B-cup breasts and a somewhat stout butt. Her face was the opposite of her friend: bigger face, thin lips, thicker eyebrows, plump cheeks, and an upturned nose. Her hair was shorter, barely reaching the half of her back. She was wearing a long dark blue dress with a white petals design.<br />
<br />
Cody began to look at his phone, pretending to type something, so he could listen to their conversation, but it wasn&#39;t very interesting. The girls were talking about how they got into investing and some seminars they were going to attend together. Cody was ashamed to admit it, but he wasn&#39;t expecting such pretty girls to talk about stuff like that. To him, they were talking like fully grown adults, not even his parents talked about that, and this gave Cody an idea: turning them into older men. Grabbing the remote, he set the age to &quot;60&quot; for both girls, also turning up the &quot;hair amount&quot; setting. Like the many times he did before, he pointed the remote at the girls and pressed the button to transform them.<br />
<br />
Since they were immersed in their conversation, the girls didn&#39;t seem to care about the slight pain felt after the hit of the remote control beam. It was after they saw hair around their bodies when they noticed that something was off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Elise?&quot; said the brunette girl, &quot;You&#39;re growing a beard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elise brought her hands to her mouth and felt all the hair growing there. &quot;There&#39;s hair growing on your arms, Nora!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hair was growing on the entire body of both Elise and Nora, even in parts that weren&#39;t visible. At the same time, their hair was receding on their heads. Elise&#39;s hair got a buzz cut, while Nora, who wasn&#39;t growing a beards, got a bald spot on her head and a thinning hair. Both girls were growing in size and age, as that happened, a bunch of grey hair began to appear on their bodies.<br />
<br />
Nora&#39;s body was gaining more muscle, though some fat concentrated on her belly. Her breasts grew, but to form manly pectorals. Her arms and legs thickened with muscle, her neck likewise. All of this caused her jeans and shirt, which were made to be worn by a slim girl, to burst along with her bra. She let out a scream with her now deep voice, looking at the emerging bulge on her crotch, straining her white panties, tearing them apart with his new penis and testicles. The last remnants of femininity on his face were gone, with a much rougher face, a bigger nose, and wrinkles.<br />
<br />
Still being the opposite of her friend, Elise was gaining more fat than muscle, specifically in her belly, in which stretch marks were appearing. Her skin got saggier and her breasts seemingly deflated, sadly, no pectorals formed. Her butt lost shape but kept the fat, which made her hairy legs thicker. While her dress didn&#39;t tore apart, she chose to remove it for her convenience, and as she did, she could se the hair growing on her armpits. She was left wearing her dark blue undergarments, weird looking on her new body. Her face looked older than Nora&#39;s, with more wrinkles and a double chin. Her nose also reshaped and became hooked nose. Like her friend, Elise also screamed as she saw and felt a penis growing on her crotch, noticing her raspier voice. However, his member didn&#39;t break his panties, so he wasn&#39;t completely naked.<br />
<br />
The two old men stared at each other in shock for a while, once the transformation finished, but they returned to their conversation as if nothing happened. Cody was bored of seeing subjects acting relatively the same after such abrupt transformations, and hearing these old men talking about the same things wasn&#39;t as interesting as seeing the two beautiful girls that they used to be. Cody looked at his controller and found the &quot;awareness&quot; setting. He made it so the subjects would be aware of changes and launched another beam to the transformed girls, waiting to see how they reacted.<br />
<br />
The conversation between the two old men stopped abruptly, as they looked at each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elise?&quot; said the naked man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nora?&quot; said the fatter man.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to us!? Why am I a man? Why am I naked!?&quot; He covered his crotch and chest. As he put his hand on his crotch, he touched his new member. &quot;I have a dick!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least you look better than me. I look like I don&#39;t take care of my body! And I look ridiculous wearing my panties and bra.&quot; He also put his hands on his new testicles. &quot;These panties just feel uncomfortable now that I have a dick,&quot; she said, almost whispering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody is reacting to our changes. Do they think we&#39;ve always looked like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my goodness, Nora. But how can that be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no clue!&quot; Nora exclaimed &quot;Look, for now let&#39;s go buy some clothes. I don&#39;t want to be naked, even if other people don&#39;t care.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I also wouldn&#39;t mind looking at a body as good as yours either.&quot; Elise said, in a suggestive manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elise! Don&#39;t joke when we&#39;re like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez, sorry Nora. I just wanted to lighten up the mood.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody saw the two men leave the food court, and he was really curious about how they would live now, since they&#39;re the only ones, beside Cody himself, who know about who they used to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, man. I&#39;m stuffed,&quot; said Jayce, signaling to Cody that they finished eating. &quot;What are we waiting for now? Let&#39;s go to buy the computer!&quot;</p>
