<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff stood quietly by the door as his mothers and sisters left the master bedroom on their way to get food, and as soon as they were all out he shut the door and then pushed the nob in and turned it to reengage the lock. It wasn&#39;t that he didn&#39;t trust them, but he had to remember the toughness of his situation. They had already completed their transformations into Slug Women and as such could probably handle Megan and Jenny on an even basis outside the room, and he was confident that together they could resist this unknown master of Megan and Jenny&#39;s. He, however, was still a normal human for the moment, and while Slug People weren&#39;t known for superhuman strength, they could be strong enough to make wrestling with one alone, difficult. The wrestling match to free Whitney from Megan and Jenny&#39;s control was proof of that as it ended up taking not just Grace but Zoe and Lucy as well, and that then lead to Zoe and Lucy&#39;s transformations. Jeff couldn&#39;t take the risk that Megan and Jenny might have only moved into one of the other bedrooms and would then try to come into the master bedroom while his mother and sisters were gone and getting food.<br />
<br />
And he was glad they were getting food as the room soon carried the sound of his stomach gurgling as he looked over the room. Light was coming in from the windows on the south and north sides of the room, showing that it was morning and it was time for breakfast, though for now all he could do was wait. It also let him look over the room and note how things had changed. There was a thin layer of slime in some places along the carpet, largely where Grace had been after her transformation, but once Whitney was freed and Lucy and Zoe transformed there were a few more, though this layer was thin and wasn&#39;t that much of a problem. The bigger thing was the bed, where it was pretty much coated  in the cum from his transformed family members from the end of Zoe and Lucy&#39;s transformation. The sight of it was enough arouse him a little, though thankfully for the moment things were quiet enough that that sexual tension had gone down after Lucy and Zoe&#39;s transformation completed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully they&#39;re okay and that Megan and Jenny don&#39;t give them any trouble,&quot; Jeff thought to himself as he moved a bit toward the south window and glancing toward the small closet that was just to the north of the master bathroom, with his mind also racing on the most likely confrontation being between his mother and sisters with Megan and Jenny.<br />
<br />
He then came up to the window and looked out of it to note the activity going on in the neighborhood. It was a fairly quiet day and some normal summer morning activities were going on. Most people were probably having breakfast, but there&#39;d also be some that may have gotten up earlier and were going about a normal routine. Jeff could see some of those neighbors that were up and out going about those things, that ranged from jogging to some lawn work that didn&#39;t require something noisy like a lawnmower. One neighbor to the west of the Chapman house was already out and was trimming branches from a tree with a pair of hand clippers. The houses across the street were largely new and had been built in the past few years, and until Megan and Jenny had arrived, Jeff didn&#39;t think anyone had bought them yet. A few people moved by the Chapman home as they jogged along in front of the home. None looked up to notice Jeff standing in the window, or if they did they didn&#39;t seem to note that he was naked.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s thoughts were then interrupted when he heard a sort of click come from across the room, and he looked back over to see Jenny at the north window and sliding it up, as though it were nothing. That brought up some panic, as he and his siblings had tried to open those windows the previous night, but they didn&#39;t budge. Now Jenny was opening the window with no problem. It wasn&#39;t long before the window was open and Jenny was moving to fit her head through the opening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... hello there big boy,&quot; Jenny said with a smile, &quot;it&#39;s nice to have you waiting alone for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Us...&quot; Jeff blinked and then heard another click and looking back to see Megan at the south bedroom window and that made him back away from that window.<br />
<br />
He then looked over to see Jenny easily squeezing her body through the window opening and was nearly through it completely. In this, it was unlikely he&#39;d make it all the way to the main door. His only escape options were the bathroom or the closet, and he had to make that decision quick as Megan had now gotten the south window open with ease and had stuck her head in while Jenny was now fully through the north window. He picked the closet, it might mean a bit further of a run, but like the main part of the bedroom, it&#39;s floor was carpeted and so far no one else had been in it. Thus he wouldn&#39;t slip on anything and there was likely some slime  in the bathroom from when Grace transformed. Thus he turned, hurdled the be and ducked into the closet.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Jenny screamed and dove forward with the speed one would expect from a human and not from a slug, but Jeff was able to make it into the closet before she could get there.<br />
<br />
He heard a soft thump as he turned the nob on the inside of the closet as he then swung the door shut behind him and then pressed in to turn that knob that engaged the lock. Just as he&#39;d finished that he felt the knob begin to shake a little as Megan and Jenny likely began to try to move on it. Frustrated grunts and moans soon followed showing that the lock was engaged and they couldn&#39;t get in. That made Jeff smile a bit as he found himself falling to the floor and sitting down in the dark. The room normally had a light, but in the rush to get in before being caught by Megan or Jenny, he&#39;d only managed to get in and didn&#39;t have time to turn on the light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on now, this is getting old,&quot; Megan groaned from outside the door, &quot;I mean don&#39;t you want to be with us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be free,&quot; Jeff said softly to himself and then said out loud, &quot;didn&#39;t you go downstairs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We did... but then master came by,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;and he volunteered to deal with your sisters and mother. Help them join the hive, so the only one left is you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you keep locking yourself inside rooms that we can&#39;t get in,&quot; Megan added.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least now we have you in a small space and you&#39;re alone,&quot; Jenny spoke, &quot;your family will join the hive and then so will you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t bet on it,&quot; Jeff grumbled back at them, hoping that hive mind would hold his mother and sisters together and free of this &quot;master&quot; that had to have over powered Megan and Jenny&#39;s minds at some point in the past. He was sure that they could, but he couldn&#39;t know that for sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Megan commented, &quot;and now you can&#39;t escape and your family can&#39;t get in to help you. So... we&#39;ll just get you horney and then you&#39;ll join us and the hive will grow from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff remained privately resistant to that, but alone and in the dark he knew there wasn&#39;t much he could do. They&#39;d timed their entrance in a way that he could not have gotten out into the hallway as had been originally planned and he was now caught sitting on the floor of the closet while Megan and Jenny were just outside it. It wasn&#39;t long before he began to smell a rather arousing scent that drifted through the crack underneath the door and it rapidly began pulling his penis up and back to attention again and having it battle against his hunger. Two sets of husky moans soon followed, which gave him some hint on what Megan and Jenny were doing on the other side of the door.</p>
