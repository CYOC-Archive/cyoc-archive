<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My name is Tom and this is not what you’re used to reading on CYOC.  This is not fiction!  This is my story <br />
and I need you to believe it, before we're all binge drinking and wearing snap backs.  I’m a 20 something <br />
college dorm guy.  Average height just about, go to the gym when I can, short brown hair and green eyes.  <br />
Pretty normal, you could call it boring life of long nights studying to make average grades, working to stay <br />
afloat and staying close to my friends.  I’m probably just like a lot of you, or at least I was.  I know most <br />
people use this site to post fictional stories but something is happening here, something weird and I don’t <br />
know where else to turn.  I wish I could say I trusted my friends but I may not be able to soon.  No one would <br />
believe me if I started a regular blog.  There’s no one else I can go to, so I pray you guys will read these <br />
entries and believe me.  I’m going to try to post here everyday, to learn as much as I can, to share <br />
everything I can.  I need to get this to people who will believe it, I need to warn people.  I don’t want <br />
what’s happening here to ever happen again to anyone.  <br />
<br />
This is Day One.  I’ll start at the beginning, or at least the beginning of my involvement.  I can’t tell you <br />
my last name, or what school this is or even what state I’m in.  I can’t let them know I’m on to them.  You <br />
see, a couple of weeks ago, a video went viral at my school.  Happens all the time right?  I bet everybody <br />
knows Friday… Yeah, well this is a bit worse.  This wasn’t an ordinary video, there’s nothing ordinary about <br />
this any more.  Its not on YouTube, not yet I hope, I haven’t dared search for it.  Its being passed, student <br />
to student.  Its supposed to be an instructional video on how to be a real bro.  You know the type, good with <br />
ladies, hit at parties, tight bro packs.  People like that are popular in college so its no wonder why people <br />
jumped to watch it at first.  It was supposed to just be a how to, give them some points on how to talk and <br />
dress but it wasn’t.  The first cases were just a handful of freshies, desperate to impress the upperclassmen <br />
and make a good early impression.  At first it was funny, they tried to imitate the video.  They tried to <br />
dress and talk like real bros but it was just really sad and fake.  But as the days went on that changed.  <br />
They changed.  The first few people started getting more built.  They started getting really tan.  It was <br />
slight at first, it began with them developing a little more tone and over a matter of days the developed <br />
months of muscle.  Not all over, just their upper bodies mostly, they all got six packs and big pecs and arms.  <br />
Their bodies got darker as if they were spending every moment in the sun, or at least visiting a good tanning <br />
salon.  They started wearing tighter clothing and showing off whenever they got the chance.  They’d take <br />
pictures constantly and start pulling up their shirts in front of girls.  <br />
<br />
Still, no one really gave it much thought.  They put in a little extra effort at the gym, we told ourselves.  <br />
They were getting more sun, its college, people want to change.  They were proud of their accomplishments.  <br />
Everyone gets a little giddy when they first start to notice the results.  But it didn’t stop there, they <br />
started talking differently.  Their voices were deeper, which shouldn’t happen at this age, they were smoother <br />
and tinted with that alpha male confidence that girls drool over.  Again, no big deal we thought.  Even when <br />
their grades started dropping we just passed it off as them spending too much time on themselves and not <br />
enough studying.  Freshies especially just can’t handle it.  It just didn’t stop though, even the most <br />
conservative of them made drastic wardrobe changes.  Polos, short preppy shorts, snapck backs, expensive shoes <br />
and sandals that they shouldn’t have been able to afford.  Eventually even their hair changed, they all got <br />
the same short cuts and their hair somehow, someway seemed… thicker, wavier, ranging from platinum to dirty <br />
blond.  And they weren’t just doing worse academically they actually seemed dumber, a lot dumber.  They only <br />
talked about their bodies, and picking up chicks.  They partied and drank all the time seeing who could chug <br />
the most, or the quickest.  Soon they all started looking the same, all started acting the same and all only <br />
hanging out with each other.  A pack of good looking zombies.  They were few at first but the video started <br />
spreading slowly.<br />
<br />
None of this mattered to me at first, until a few days ago.  Robert, a kid my age, approached me.  We weren’t <br />
like great friends and all that, he was a little nerdy and antisocial but nice enough so we got along.  He <br />
seemed completely out of his mind with fear.  He told me about how some of his friends had watched the video <br />
and had started changing.  He broke down a bit as he described how they began drifting away from him.  <br />
Robert’s friends were, like him, mostly nerds.  It was hard to believe that they’d be lured into the bro life <br />
but Robert insisted watching it had actually changed them.  I felt like he was hiding something so I pressed <br />
him for awhile.  He admitted that his friends had come back and had forced him to watch the video earlier that <br />
day.  He told me he was already starting to have weird feelings.  He wouldn’t elaborate he just shook his head <br />
sadly.  I noticed his arms looked a little bigger than usual but dismissed him as being overly dramatic.  If <br />
only I had listened.  <br />
<br />
I went back to see Robert today.  I opened his door and was greeted by a loud and deep “aye bro!”  There was a <br />
crunch and I noticed I stepped on a beer can, even though Robert didn’t drink, or didn’t before.  He was had <br />
several cans on his desk next to him.  He was dressed like the other bros and was definitely more muscular <br />
than he had been, Hell he was muscular period.  I asked if he was Robert, I wasn’t even sure.  Only his <br />
strange blue eyes held any trace of the nerd that had once come to me begging for help.  He told me to call <br />
him Robby now and eagerly showed off his abs to me with a big cheeky grin that seemed so alien on his face, <br />
altered as it was.  “You like bro?”  He asked me.  I shook my head and he just laughed.  “Just checking you <br />
aren’t a faggot bro.”  It was so unreal, this, change that had happened.  “Robert… Robby, whatever, what the <br />
Hell happened to you man?  You weren’t like this…”  His eyes narrowed.  “Don’t try me!  I know you’re just <br />
jealous.”  He calmed down again and shrugged before going back to drinking.  I let myself out without another <br />
word.  I didn’t know the person in that room, and I didn’t care to.  <br />
<br />
That was hours ago but it still feels like I just left that room.  That’s what this video can do to people, <br />
that’s what its doing.  How many other people have seen it?  How fast is it spreading around?  Have my friends <br />
watched it yet?  God, I hoped not.  I recalled Robert recounting the slow turn, the drift, and then forcing <br />
him into… that thing.  I couldn't bear it, if that ever started happening to my friends.  But I know them <br />
better, Robert was just a nerd.  My friends are great, they're stronger than that, stronger than this stupid <br />
video, I hope.  I hope this all blows over, that it all just ends.  Thanks everybody for listening.  I should <br />
go, I need to try to get some sleep.  Signing off for tonight.  <br />
<br />
- Tom.</p>
