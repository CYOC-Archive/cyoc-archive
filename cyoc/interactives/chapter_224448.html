<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It still feels.... a little baggy in places? Could you maybe put in a bit more?&quot; You asked, a slight tremble to your voice. <br />
<br />
The change had felt pretty good looking back on it, and you wanted to see how much you could push this. Not to a ridculous degree; last thing you wanted was to grow to the size of a parade ballon or pop but just a bit more shouldn&#39;t hurt, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.... okay. If that&#39;s what you want.&quot; Ms Hart said as she flicked the pump on a bit more. <br />
<br />
You felt the air rushing not into the suit but into you. The pressure kept building in spots before your latex skin flexed and bludged out. The shape of your body changing with each creak and pulse of air. Your legs thickened while your arms gained a bit more &#39;muscle&#39;. But most the change was to your main body, with you creaking up several inches and your hips widening out to a good &#39;swaying&#39; size. <br />
<br />
The main change though was in your breasts now, which bounced and creaked in size, going from volleyball straight into basketball size. You were pretty sure you were at least double Ds but the fact they were the kind of &#39;perfect&#39; boobs without any drag or drop, it made it hard to tell. <br />
<br />
By the time she shut off the pump, Ms Hart had to look up at you as you were a head taller than her now. She had been about 5&#39;8&quot; and which meant you were probably 5&#39;11&quot; or six feet tall now. Your hair was a little longer too now, ending at the middle of your back rather than at your shoulders now.<br />
<br />
&quot;That do it for yah? .... oh wow that did a bit of a number on you.. wasn&#39;t expecting you to be this... tall.&quot; Ms Hart said as she looked up at you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Never better, god I don&#39;t have some of the sore mucles when i&quot;m like this. I feel Great!&quot; you said as you posed in front of the mirror, with a few of them being maybe a bit more provocative than intended. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it&#39;s nervous to go through your first change but the rush you have afterward.... feels good huh?&quot; she asked as she playfully poked your check. <br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t mean to but your mouth seemed to ripple a bit with almost a &#39;growl&#39; coming out and your teeth bared. As you went to open your mouth Ms Hart stepped back, grabbed something and shoved it into your mouth. It took a second or two to process, before you gave it a suck or two which made a loud &#39;smack smack&#39; sound as you did so. With a blush on your face you took out the rather large pacifier out of your mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;UH.... what...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It happens, usually for newbies. Something about the shark suit makes you want to kinda... bite people.&quot; Ms Hart shrugged, &quot;So we started having things on hand to shove into the suit&#39;s mouth. Employees found it embarrassing but that actually helped snap them out of it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So do I have to...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; she said with a wave, &quot;You don&#39;t NEED to keep it on you. So long as you have something on you. Food, candy, gum, heck you can chew on your own tail, had one guy do that.&quot; <br />
<br />
You moved your new tail in front of you to check for bite marks but it seemed to be lacking any. Your jaw seemed to act up again so with a sigh you put the pacifier back in while Ms Hart went into storage again and brought out a large red once piece swimsuit, a match for hers. She helped you get it on over your new &#39;body&#39; and even gave you a black whistle to go with it. <br />
<br />
At the end of it you were a semi amazon shark anthro pool tool looking straight out of one of those beach pin up magiznes or perhaps one of those fan service beach episodes. Enough to entice and probably cause some wet dreams but not enough to be outright lewd or pornographic. That is if they weren&#39;t laughing at you cause the pacifier was still there. Ms Hart took it out and put it in the sink to wash later. <br />
<br />
&quot;So... what do I ... do now?&quot; you asked as you ran a hand down the side of your body still taking everything in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well basically what I told you; just being a mascot and helping out around the park.&quot; she said before digging out a few maps of the park, she tossed a few of them to the side before settling in handing one to you, &quot;Here.&quot; <br />
<br />
It was just a simple map of the park, obviously. But unlike the normal maps, this one had a long route draw in red in it. Visiting a couple different parts of the park along with listed times for each visit. A lunch break was also schedlued when you visited the confiction booths or you could excuse yourself and eat out of public site it seemed. Which begged the question... <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm worried about food? Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll cover it for the first day at least. Keep working with us and you&#39;ll at least get a free meal each day.&quot; She gave a slight giggle when she saw where on the map you were staring, &quot;Granted it&#39;s just like park food so like burgers and hot dogs.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And bathroom?&quot; you asked<br />
<br />
&quot;What what piping?&quot; she said, lifting up your tail which earned an eep from you, &quot;As I understand it, the food just turns into pure energy or something to keep you moving while in that suit. Heard some of the more advanced models are more &#39;real&#39; though but those are for like.... adult themed parties or something.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;So what you actually do is just go around the park on this route for the day,&quot; her finger traced along the path as she talked, &quot;Helping out being cheerful, trying to get people to spend more money or come back. Take pictures, answer questions or trivia that sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also you&#39;re supposed to help out with life guard duties.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I am?&quot; you asked before she put a finger to your forehead and tapped on it. Luckily the urge to bite didn&#39;t come up. <br />
<br />
&quot;The suit should have given you enough knowledge to pass as a certified life guard. Hell you can swim like a shark now too. There&#39;s a bit more magic in there than just turning you into a shark bae.&quot; she explained with a giggle. <br />
<br />
Sure enough, you started to think about how you&#39;d pull someone out of a pool and give them CPR and it was there. How to apply first aide for cuts and scrapes, info about the park&#39;s history and rides, a number of funny sayings or good social media poses, along with a decent amount of info about different sea life. This was way better than any of those tutorial vids you watched as background noise. <br />
<br />
Wait did she just call you &#39;bae&#39;? <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I gotta go do my own shift, I&#39;ll see you around the park.&quot; Ms Hart said as she grabbed her own gear and headed out the door, &quot;Catch you later cutie.&quot; <br />
<br />
She started to hum a tune as she left only to duck her head back in with her brow furred and an intense look on her face. She waggled a finger in a manner that reminded you of a mom lecturing a troublesome child. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH One last rule. About that bite thing you might have to control?&quot; You nod before she continues, &quot;Bite, ANYTHING. Candy, food, clothes, yourself whatever. Bite the ground if you have to. BUT NEVER.&quot; her voice raised as she wagged her finger in time with her words, &quot;NEVER Under any circumstances bite a human. Got it?&quot; <br />
<br />
You nod which earned an approving smile from the lifeguard. With that she gave you a wave and left you to your own devices. Looking over the map, you had enough time to make a quick jog to your first stop it seemed. Granted you had to start a couple hours behind the route&#39;s listed start time. So maybe book it a bit to catch up. </p>

Just were did you start your shift?</h3>
