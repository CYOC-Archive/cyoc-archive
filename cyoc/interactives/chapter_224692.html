<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Standing within his sanctum, Fukushu furrowed his brow as he studied the information he had received. There were issues transpiring within both timelines, a threat from the future bringing all together. The nine tail kitsune sighing heavily as he realized any actions he wished to take against the wizards would need to be delayed. &quot;What are you doing at this hour,&quot; Abolith called.<br />
<br />
 Fukushu turned, watching as an obviously exhausted elf now emerged. &quot;Deciding our next move,&quot; he replied. &quot;The wizards of both timelines are on high alert.&quot; Abolith stretched, the elf appearing disheveled as she looked over her beloved shoulder. &quot;I told you Shays information was sound,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Let the wizards deal with this threat. I for one could use the rest.&quot; Fukushu nodded, noting the exhaustion on Aboliths face. &quot;You look tired.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because your son has been ill beloved,&quot; Abolith grumbled. &quot;I&#39;ve tried all the elven remedies I could remember yet the child still has a cough. I&#39;ve only now gotten him to sleep, although I worry he may be running a fever.&quot; Fukushu now tried to hide a smirk as he gazed at Abolith. Since the birth of their child, the pair had been thrust into unfamiliar territory. While Fukushu had some experience dealing with infants, Abolith did not. This had led the usually confident assassin to doubt herself. She fretted over every ailment, thinking any cough or slight sneeze would be the end of her child. On more than one occasion, she had become convinced that the child was running a high fever only for Fukushu to discover that the infant was simply wrapped tightly in too many blankets. &quot;I will check on Raiden,&quot; he said softly. &quot;You however should rest. You haven&#39;t been sleeping well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Raiden is ill,&quot; Abolith said sternly. Fukushu nodded, knowing better than to argue with Abolith. Their child was healthy, yet Abolith feared that even the slightest breeze would bring his demise. The kitsune had never seen his beloved act so irrationally. Abolith had always been the steadier of the pair, Fukushu known for his rage and temper as she coldly went about her business. Becoming a mother had changed her though, the kitsune could tell how much she loved her son, so much so that she was terrified of anything happening to him. For someone who had spent centuries controlling their emotions, finding herself vulnerable once more brought back painful memories of her time as a slave. &quot;I will take care of Raiden beloved,&quot; he said softly. &quot;But please, rest. It will be difficult to care for the child of you too are ill.&quot; At this Abolith seemed to relent, sighing as she turned to leave only to freeze in astonishment as she beheld an intruder.<br />
<br />
Tatsu now stood before the pair, the celestial kitsune adorned in his regal white and gold hikama.  As Fukushu furrowed his brow at his father, Abolith stared at him in wide eyed fear. Fear that only intensified as Tatsu uttered a single sentence.<br />
<br />
Where is my grandson?<br />
<br />
Now it was both parents who felt a pang of abject terror course through their bodies. They had gone to great lengths to hide Raidens existence. After Fukushu attacked his mother, the pair went into hiding knowing that Tatsu would want vengeance for his wife. The two feared that if the celestial kitsune discovered he had an heir, he would stop at nothing to take him. &quot;Go,&quot; Fukushu whispered to Abolith, the nine tail kitsune angrily staring at his father as he withdrew his katana. <br />
<br />
&quot;I will ask again,&quot; Tatsu said slowly as he approached. &quot;Where is my grandson?&quot; A low growl now began to emanate from Fukushu as his lips curled into a snarl. &quot;You can not have him,&quot; he hissed. Tatsu said nothing, his eyes focused on Fukushu as he continued his slow march. For Fukushu, his father&#39;s lack of response only increased his fear and his rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU CAN NOT HAVE MY SON!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu roared, unleashing a blistering attack of magic. The explosion shaking the foundation of his sanctum as fire engulfed the celestial kitsune. For a moment, Fukushu gazed at the inferno intently, only for his heart to drop as Tatsu emerged unscathed.<br />
<br />
A roar of pure hatred now bellowed from the nine tail kitsune as he lept to attack his father.  Now Tatsu unsheathed his own blade, crossing swords with his son who fought with a maniacal fury. The power behind his sons attacks would have fell any other opponent. Fortunately for Tatsu, he was a God.<br />
<br />
&quot;You!&quot; SMASH &quot;Can&#39;t!&quot; SMASH &quot;Have him!&quot;<br />
<br />
If Fukushu wasn&#39;t attempting to kill him, Tatsu would be proud of his sons skill. Over the centuries, Fukushu had trained harder than any warrior the lord of the kitsune had ever seen. Fukushu was powerful, his skill as a warrior surpassing even Tatsu himself. Their was a certain amount of pride in the fact that his eldest son had surpassed him as a swordsman. Still, as powerful as Fukushu was, he was no God.<br />
<br />
Useing his divine magic, Tatsu now launched Fukushu into an adjacent wall. For the moment Fukushu was down, allowing Tatsu to proceed. As he now entered a side room, he raised an eyebrow as he gazed upon Abolith.<br />
<br />
The elf assassin looked ill, her fire red hair  disheveled. Aboliths eyes were wide with fright, the elf standing in front of a crib as she held her blade at the ready in her trembling hand. &quot;I&#39;ve come to see my grandson Abolith,&quot; he stated. Abolith said nothing, ready to sacrifice her life for her son.<br />
<br />
Fukushu roared, grabbing his father from behind. Hoisting the celestial into the air he now slammed him backwards before delivering a vicious punch to the kitsunes face. Slowly Tatsu stood, gazing into the maniacal eyes of his son. &quot;Only one of us shall leave this sanctum alive father,&quot; Fukushu hissed, his breathing coming in ragged gulps. A bemused smirk now crossed the celestial kitaunes face as he slowly got to his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally you understand,&quot; Tatsu said softly. &quot;Finally you realize what it is to care for something more than yourself.&quot; Fukushu said nothing, his eyes still wide as he held his katana at the ready. What was his father talking about? Tatsu now stepped to the side pointing towards the rear of the sanctum. Fukushu, puzzled, as a small figure now emerged from the shadows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu was confused, watching as a black and red kit now gazed at him with wide, innocent eyes. The boy seemed familiar but it was impossible. Raiden lay in a crib behind him. How was this kitsune child standing before him?<br />
<br />
&quot;You recognize him,&quot; Tatsu said softly. &quot;He may be grown but you recognize your son.&quot; Fukushu said nothing, gaping at the kit as he walked slowly towards him. Raiden now whimpered slightly, wringing his hands as he threw himself around his father&#39;s neck. &quot;Its me dad,&quot; Raiden sniffed. &quot;Its Raiden. I missed you dad. Don&#39;t you recognize me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu said nothing, his heart feeling as if it had been stabbed. Squeezing the kit tightly, he now held the boy as his eyes grew damp. He recognized his sons scent, somehow this boy was a future version of his son. &quot;Raiden?&quot;<br />
<br />
As Raiden buried his head in his father&#39;s shoulder, the kitsune found himself gazing up at his own father. The golden kitsunes face stern yet also somehow warm. &quot;Our feud is at an end my son,&quot; Tatsu said softly. &quot;All must be forgiven if we are to ensure the future comes to pass.&quot;</p>
