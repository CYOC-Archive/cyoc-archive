<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I can&#39;t speak for everyone, but as long as you intend to protect the rest of the Jenkins family as well as Harry and myself, I&#39;m agreeable,&quot; said Jenny. &quot;But you all have done so much for me as it is and I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve caused all of you so much trouble.&quot;<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t your fault,&quot; said Lisa, putting a reassuring arm around her future daughter-in-law. &quot;That rogue may have started all of this, and that creep back in your home town adding to the madness doesn&#39;t help, but one thing I&#39;ve learned from all my years of living here is that Moon Lake looks out for its own, normal and were alike.&quot;<br />
&quot;Here, here,&quot; agreed her husband Henry. &quot;Just tell us what you need us to do and we&#39;ll do it,&quot; he said to the Tachibanas.<br />
&quot;For now, please prepare an overnight bag and be ready to leave soon,&quot; requested Akane.<br />
&quot;We will continue to monitor this residence, along with your brother&#39;s and his place of business, but the tasks will be easier with you in a more secured location,&quot; said Daisuke.<br />
&quot;Understood,&quot; said Harry, while grabbing Jenny&#39;s hand. &quot;Come along honey, we better get ready.&quot;<br />
His parents followed suit, leaving the Tachibanas alone in the dining room.<br />
&quot;Will the plan succeed?&quot; asked Akane in Japanese, taking the extra precaution to speak a language none of the Jenkins knew even if they were present at the moment.<br />
&quot;Depending upon when and where we set it in motion, there is no reason why it should not,&quot; her grandson answered in the Skulk leader&#39;s native tongue. &quot;It comes down to the actions and reactions of this agent, though I suspect we will not like what his orders turn out to be.&quot;<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; inquired his grandmother.<br />
&quot;If I was in a position to send someone to observe the lady I thought was mine, no matter how erroneous that belief was, the last thing I would do is tell my agent to simply watch her with another who was not me.&quot;<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t mean...&quot; began Akane, shocked at what her grandson was suggesting.<br />
&quot;While my suspicion has yet to be proven, this Dieter Wilhelm would not be the first with evil in his heart to order the death of a rival.&quot;<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Showered and dressed, at least for the moment if not the entire day, William and Martha Anderson sat down to breakfast for two in the privacy of their kitchen.<br />
During the preparation and consumption of the meal, their conversation had stayed focused on Jenny Harper and Harry Jenkins although in the end, the best the Andersons could do for now was offer the couple their friendship and support.<br />
&quot;But I still feel sorry for her,&quot; revealed Martha. &quot;Even if that damn rogue hadn&#39;t of changed you and her against your will, no matter who Jenny fell in love with while she was out here, she&#39;d still have her family and that guy her father is so gung ho for her to marry to deal with.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know dear,&quot; agreed William, while reaching out and holding her hand. &quot;But as fellow foxes, Jenny and Harry have the full support of both the Skulk and the rest of Moon Lake. There&#39;s no way either group will let anything happen to them or spoil the wedding next weekend.&quot;<br />
&quot;Remember our wedding?&quot; his wife asked him with a smile. &quot;It seemed like it took me forever to convince dad that I <i>wanted</i> to get married, not that I <i>had</i> to get married.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know, and then he still almost brought that damn shotgun of his to the wedding anyway,&quot; recalled her husband. &quot;I still can&#39;t help thinking he might have raised a double barreled objection when the preacher asked <i>If anyone present knows any reason why this couple should not be married...</i>&quot;<br />
The couple got a nice chuckle out of that, and then grew silent for a bit until Martha said, &quot;About last night...&quot;<br />
&quot;Which part?&quot; asked William, recalling the intimate moments between the two of them after the boys left more than anything else.<br />
&quot;Dawn and Douglas Hale,&quot; said Martha, turning her head to look right at William.<br />
&quot;What about them?&quot; he asked in return.<br />
&quot;Would you want to... that is...&quot; began Martha, unable to properly phrase what she wanted to ask.<br />
&quot;Would I be willing to let you be you with Dawn? Absolutely. Like I said, now that you&#39;re a werecat, you can have all the women you want. It&#39;s the least I owe you after all the years I cheated on you while you stayed home raising our sons while you kept denying your bi-side,&quot; William reminded her. &quot;But Dawn doesn&#39;t seem interested in just you, and despite having a werefox&#39;s life/mate bond between them, you would be far from the first female Douglas wasn&#39;t married to that he wants to have sex with. So in return, I need to ask you if you&#39;d be comfortable having sex with another man, let alone seeing me sexually engaged with a woman who wasn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha gave that some serious thought for a moment, and then said, &quot;Truthfully? I don&#39;t know. At first I wasn&#39;t happy finding out Dawn was a werevixen, because that damn rogue left her emotional mark on me as well. But I&#39;ve already come to terms with the fact that I can&#39;t let Yvette&#39;s actions cloud my judgement about the rest of the Skulk. Yet while I&#39;d have no problems in a lez duet with Dawn, a threesome with us and Douglas doesn&#39;t turn me on as much as the thought of a threesome between Dawn, me, and you,&quot; revealed Martha with a smile, as William&#39;s inner werefox silently yipped excitedly at the prospect.<br />
&quot;My times with Samantha and Frances are great, and I&#39;m never going to give them up,&quot; added Martha, &quot;but they&#39;re straight lesbians, for lack of a better term; and sometimes I just can&#39;t help wanting your nice hard cock ramming deep into my pussy, its vulpine top knot penetrating me from behind even as I feel a soft tongue on my clit and all my lovers&#39; paws running across my body simultaneously,&quot; she said, shivering in pleasure at the thought.<br />
&quot;But to have Dawn, you have to at least consider doing Douglas too, let alone Dawn having fun with me while you and him are busy,&quot; William reminded her.<br />
&quot;I know, and I just don&#39;t know whether or not I&#39;m ready to open our marriage THAT far. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t trust you,&quot; said Martha, grabbing William&#39;s hand to reassure him. &quot;Our bond is strong and nothing can ever break it. Yvette Smith proved that. Yet I honestly don&#39;t know how I&#39;d feel about being with another man, let alone you being with another woman.&quot; Again was the unspoken word Martha refused to say.<br />
&quot;I know honey. I promised you I&#39;d never stray again, and a werefox&#39;s word to his life/mate is his bond,&quot; vowed William, reaching out to hug his wife. &quot;But after all the shit you had to go through in Minnesota, I also promised you a fresh start here. I can&#39;t and won&#39;t force you to do anything you don&#39;t want to, but it&#39;s still your decision to make, and I&#39;ll stand by you either way.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; said Martha, after the hug was over. &quot;Now then,&quot; she said, rising from the table and grabbing his hand. &quot;The dishes can wait. Let&#39;s go back upstairs and do some long term planning.&quot;<br />
&quot;For?&quot; he wondered, while standing up next to her.<br />
&quot;While thinking about the Hales can wait until I absolutely need to consider the situation further, we&#39;re going to make a list of bi-weres we&#39;d both like to have while practicing for that future threesome,&quot; replied Martha, even as her werecat fursona started straining against her human clothing, begging for release and its itch to be scratched.</p>
