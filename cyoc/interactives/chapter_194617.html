<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eventually Nina picked up the remote and began flicking through the channels, looking for something to watch. She&#39;d find something, linger on it just long enough for it to catch Kelly&#39;s attention and then flick to something else, making it impossible for Kelly to concentrate on anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you just want to go to bed and see if we can think of something in the morning?&quot; Kelly asked, reaching out to put a hand on her friend&#39;s shoulder, only to stop half way and let her hand fall back limply to the sofa.<br />
<br />
Nina shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;If we go to school tomorrow you&#39;re going to need to talk,&quot; Kelly reminded, trying to get a rise out of her or at least some kind of response.<br />
<br />
Nina shrugged again then slumped forward, wrapping her arms around her knees and hugging them to her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Talking to you is useless,&quot; Kelly snapped, frustrated with Nina and frustrated with herself for being frustrated with her friend. Yeah, this was her fault, but the least Nina could do was try and be helpful, &quot;I&#39;m going to take a shower and when I get out I want you to have pulled yourself together so we can come up with a real plan, not just wishing for a magic fix for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got a response from Nina. Lifting her head she gave Kelly a sad little smile, &quot;Good luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stalking to the bathroom, Kelly slammed the door behind her, only for what Nina had said to sink in. She was going to have to get undressed and see herself. More than that, she was going to have to touch herself including...<br />
<br />
She looked down at her skirt. There was no sign of what it hid, but now that she was thinking about it she was fully aware of the weight of her balls, how tight her panties felt trying to contain them and her dick.<br />
<br />
She had a dick...<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; she said, making a point of keeping her voice above a whisper as she talked herself through what she needed to do, &quot;I&#39;m taking off my shirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pulling off her sweatshirt like she was yanking off a bandage, all at once so that it would be too quick for the pain to hit, she tossed it away into a corner.<br />
<br />
Her bra was next, worn out of habit and completely pointless. The cups hung against her chest, mockingly empty, while the band and straps were too tight despite her best efforts to adjust them. Tomorrow before going out she&#39;d have to fix the straps somehow and stuff the cups, if...<br />
<br />
Her first thought had been if she went out at all, but she wasn&#39;t going to do that, sink into despair and wait helpless for someone to find out what had happened and make fun of her for it. Taking a deep breath she removed her bra and let it fall to the floor. Tomorrow she&#39;d do something about her bra before she went to school if she wore a bra at all. Looking at her flat chest, and small, puffy nipples, the barest buds of breasts, a bra wasn&#39;t really necessary.<br />
<br />
She continued to stare at herself in the mirror, half undressed and not ready to go any farther. Not yet at least, but she was going to have to.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do this,&quot; she said, forcing to keep her voice even, &quot;I&#39;m not going to let Anna win.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her voice threatened to break as she spoke, but she managed to swallow that back down. if she was going to be honest with herself Anna had pretty much already won, but thinking like that wouldn&#39;t get her anywhere.<br />
<br />
Cupping her hands over her chest, where the familiar weight of her breasts should have been she tried to strike a cute pose in the mirror. Her hair was still long, her face close enough to the same that a little makeup could hide, or at least distract from the new angle of her cheeks. having slightly thicker eyebrows wasn&#39;t the end of the world, she could always pluck them back into shape and thin eyebrows were ugly, eyebrow pens had been invented for a reason after all.<br />
<br />
She could still pull off cute with next to no effort, but sexy had always been hard. Now she&#39;d just have to work harder at it.<br />
<br />
Before she could lose confidence she pulled her skirt and panties down all at once. Unable to help herself she let out a sigh of relief once her dick and balls were free of the confines of her panties.<br />
<br />
Not daring to look down she walked grimly over and turned on the shower, feeling the weight and movement of her male anatomy with every step, a sensation that only served to make the lack of weight and movement at her chest all the more obvious.<br />
<br />
Things had changed, but she still had to take care of herself.<br />
<br />
Stepping into the shower she started with what had changed the least. Washing her hair was reassuring and her arms were still lean and slender. It wasn&#39;t like she&#39;d been turned into some hairy caveman of a jock, not that Anna could have even done that to her in the first place if what she&#39;d said about the spell she&#39;d used was true. Anna had stolen her and Nina&#39;s femininity and replaced it with her masculinity split between the two of them and by Kelly&#39;s reckoning that meant that she and Nina were about one tenth guy each.<br />
<br />
It was a bad joke, but it was enough to make her smile and for what came next to be easier.<br />
<br />
The lack of breasts when she washed her chest was a shock, even though she was ready for it, but it was nothing compared to what came next.<br />
<br />
Soaping up her hands, she closed her eyes and reached down, gently fondling her cock and balls. It wasn&#39;t like she&#39;d never handled a cock and balls before, she knew her way around guys, but feeling her hands on her own cock and balls was so gross. Feeling a guy&#39;s balls sliding around beneath loose, wrinkled skin was one thing, but feeling that happening to herself was so weird. Thankfully she was smooth and hairless down there, because if she&#39;d had to shave herself she probably would have died of embarrassment on the spot.<br />
<br />
Her cock was next because she couldn&#39;t not wash it. Having a dirty cock was even more disgusting than having a cock in the first place. Cleaning it presented challenges of its own.<br />
<br />
Logically she knew that it wasn&#39;t a terribly large cock, much smaller than Brent&#39;s and Brent was pretty dead average from what she&#39;d seen, but it felt so big in her hands and unlike Brent her cock was uncut. The feeling of foreskin sliding back and forth against the head of her cock as she cleaned herself was so weird, but it had to be done.She wasn&#39;t an idiot and she knew from health class that uncut guys had to be more careful about keeping clean down there.<br />
<br />
That was a terrible thought, that she was an uncut guy, but she pushed it from her mind as she pulled her foreskin gently back to wash the head of her cock. The feeling sent butterflies to her stomach. Her cock head was so soft and smooth, every bit as sensitive as her clit and she could feel her pulse pounding in it, her cock becoming less and less soft in her hand from the stimulation. By the time she was done she was half hard, her cock bobbing uncomfortably as she moved. Turning the shower as cold as it would go mostly fixed that and she was able to finish her shower and towel off without further incident.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did it,&quot; she said triumphantly as she wrapped the towel tightly around her chest and stepped out of the bathroom. It was a small victory and she had nothing to sleep in, so she&#39;d have to ask Nina to lend her something, but that she&#39;d showered at all was a victory none the less.<br />
<br />
In the time it had taken her to shower Nina had recovered enough to go to the kitchen and get a bowl of ice cream for each of them. She was waiting at the end of the hall with the ice cream and held them up like an offering when Kelly walked towards her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kelly forced herself to smile and take the ice cream.<br />
<br />
Ice cream to celebrate taking a shower. How pathetic was that?<br />
<br />
&quot;How was it?&quot; Nina whispered, holding her own bowl close to her chest as they walked back to the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rough,&quot; Kelly admitted, &quot;But I did it and so did you. The weirdest part was that I&#39;m not, you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
She lifted a hand to make a snipping motion with two fingers.<br />
<br />
Nina&#39;s eyes went wide and she blushed furiously, &quot;Me neither. It&#39;s so bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her voice still didn&#39;t go above a whisper, but she smiled and giggled despite herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to need to borrow pajamas or something,&quot; Kelly said between spoonfuls of ice cream, &quot;There&#39;s no way I&#39;m sleeping naked on your sofa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know where I keep &#39;em, just go to my room and take what you need. Same as always, you don&#39;t need to ask,&quot; Nina giggled again before her expression grew grim, &quot;Bu everything&#39;s changed, hasn&#39;t it? we&#39;re guys, or trannys or something now, aren&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t talk like that,&quot; Kelly said, her voice breaking with how forcefully she&#39;d spoken, &quot;We&#39;re us and we&#39;re still friends, nothing&#39;s changed there, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
She fully expected Nina to tell her that she was wrong, that she hated her for what she&#39;d done to them, but instead she shook her head and wrapped her arms around Kelly.<br />
<br />
Kelly hugged her back and for just a moment things felt normal, the same as they always had.<br />
<br />
One way or another they were going to make it through this.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow might be a disaster or it could go totally fine, there was no telling and because of that there was no point in worrying any more than they had to.</p>
