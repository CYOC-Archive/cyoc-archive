<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think I&#39;ll sell you. Yes! I think I will,&quot; she says. <br />
She carries you to a table, adding things through her conversation.<br />
&quot;I need a bit of cash and captive-teddies bring in lots! I mean, you are the perfect pet and toy for adults! You never age and remain cute. And trust me, you&#39;re one of the cutest I&#39;ve ever seen!&quot; she finishes with a wink.<br />
You wriggle feebly. <br />
&quot;Now, now, don&#39;t be fussy. All are captive-bears go to good homes, we make sure of that. You&#39;ll find the perfect mommy or daddy for you in no time! I&#39;ll make you so cute for the sales pictures!&quot; she says as she claps her hands in excitement.<br />
The sales pictures? Making you cute? That can&#39;t be good! You try to move but again you feel so weak! Like a small baby. Too soon, the girl returns with baby paraphernalia. Oh no! You can see where this is going! She puts you in a thick cloth diaper, complete with an enormous yellow plastic safety pin. She then looked at you, frowning and humming pensively. She looked deep in thought then smiled widely, as if she&#39;d taken a decision. <br />
&quot;Yes! I know what he&#39;ll adore on you!&quot;<br />
Then she tied a pink frilly bonnet on your head, letting out though two holes your two round ears. The same went for your diaper. A bonnet! Pink! With frills! What the hell? You try to cry out your outrage but it only came out as angry gurgles. The girl just places effortlessly a pacifier into your mouth, swiftly ties to the back of your head through its ribbon. She then puts you up in a sitting position and snaps pictures at you. She shows then to you, beaming and you stare at them in horror. You&#39;re not only a teddy bear, but a soft pink one!   <br />
&quot;Oh no, no pouts, little teddy baby,&quot; she frowns. <br />
She tickles you, poking your belly and your armpits and tickles your feet and your sides, with little teases, verbal and tickling, and under your chins, with endless &#39;coochie coochie coos&#39; and &#39;Is the little baby ticklish?&#39;. You cannot resist, racked by spasms. She is rendering you breathless, helpless and even tears to your eyes. When did you became so ticklish? When the witch finally stops, she continues her teasing and pictures. <br />
&quot;There! Plenty of pictures of you smiling and crying tears of joy! You daddy will simply find you scrumptious! Well, both of them at any rate.&quot;<br />
You stare, horrified. Two daddies? A gay couple of faggots? That can&#39;t be true! No! Disgusted at the prospect, you flail your plush arms  and legs around helplessly.<br />
&quot;Now, now, little baby. I know one of them and he will make sure you are treated like the adorable baby you are. And you know him too,&quot; she adds with a wink.<br />
You stare back at her, not understanding. How could you know a stupid, disgusting homo?<br />
&quot;Gabriel. Do you remember him? From your high school, I think?&quot;<br />
You then remember. Gabriel. You haven&#39;t thought about him in years. Since high school, in fact. He was amongst your favorite targets for bullying. If not your top favorite at times. Then you went away to college and other targets and victims, especially when you belonged to a frat, were plentiful. Homosexuals were disgusting and easy to bully. And it was funny to see dorks and idiots cry and be sad like morons that    were too wimpy to defend themselves for the rest of the day. Not your fault they were poor or dorky. Their parents could have worked more or gotten better job to pay for clothes, surgery or told them to like normal stuff like pornography or football. And it was him who was to adopt you as a living teddy bear doll? Oh no. No, no, no, no! That faggot was going to torture you for sure! No! It wasn&#39;t fair! It wasn&#39;t your fault he has a gay idiot!<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be scared, sweet little baby,&quot; the witch smiled. &quot;Although from your reaction I guess your conscience isn&#39;t very clear, am I right?&quot;<br />
You glare at her and she just laughs, completely unimpressed. <br />
&quot;Well, in spite of your bullying, he is now a successful lawyer and on his way to a very good career. He certainly was more intelligent than you. He got married and he helped me out kindly. As payment, I told him I was a witch and that my toy store appears randomly or at different places, punishing the bad people who are allowed to enter. Poetic justice, if you will. And he told me about you and seeing that you hadn&#39;t changed, I told him I could bring you into the store and you&#39;d pick up a toy, thereby punishing the selfish lout that you are. He&#39;ll be delighted that you picked up the teddy bear. Exactly what he and in particular his husband were hoping for. You&#39;ll make a perfect substitute baby to pay back for all your meanness? What do you say?&quot;  <br />
What do you say? What do you say? You say that it&#39;s unfair! Completely! You don&#39;t want to play baby for two morons that want to play house! A house with two homosexuals! Ugh! Revolting! <br />
&quot;Aw, you&#39;ll get used to it, sweetie cutie,&quot; she smiles. &quot;These two are much kinder than you ever were. Hopefully they&#39;ll rub off you.&quot;<br />
She takes out an old-fashioned wicker basket with a top acting as a shelter, the sort used before baby carriers got more practical. The witch wrapped you in a soft blanket decorated with teddy bears, placed you in the cradle, singing a soft lullaby and cooing and poking you in the tummy, making you squirm and giggle even more. She raised her arms and a gust of wind swirled around you both, while the world spun.<br />
<br />
When the phenomenon stopped, you were both in front of a house, normal, rather large but still looking not too decorated. You do reflect that as the home of two gay guys, it could have been more flamboyant and tacky. The witch smiled, picked up your basket and rang the doorbell. Inside, happy shouts were heard and steps got steadily nearer. You could not relax, terrified by what was in store for you. A living teddy bear for two men who were desperate to nurture something. Including a guy you had bullied extensively and who would be happy to take his revenge. And that something was you. A living doll for adults in need of cute babies. Which was what you currently embodied. You hoped that nightmare would go away but it did not. On the contrary, the door opened, sealing your awful fate.</p>
