<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks again to rawr7 for helping me out with this chapter! </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I…I liked…both of you…”   <br />
  <br />
Mark and Xarxos stared at Todd in disbelief. Did he say that he liked them both?!  <br />
  <br />
“So…you didn’t prefer one of us over the other then?” Mark asked. “You liked both of us evenly?” The smaller feline let out a shaky moan and nodded his head. The snow leopard threw his hands in the air and shouted in frustration. “We’re back to square fucking one! Great, just great!”   <br />
  <br />
As he began to walk away from Todd and Xarxos, Mark noticed the book sitting on the coffee table and stopped in his tracks. A smirk crossed his muzzle as he quickly grabbed the book and turned around to point a finger at Xarxos, holding the book close to his chest with his other hand.   <br />
  <br />
“If Todd can’t decide who he should be with, then I’ll decide for him!” the snow leopard shouted. “Shape!”   <br />
  <br />
Xarxos’ eyes widened upon realizing what Mark was doing, and he leaped behind the nearby recliner, just barely dodging the spell that had been cast at him. The spell flew out of the nearby window and out of sight. Neither of them realized that the spell hit a man who was walking down the street, slowly turning him into an everyday, run-of-the-mill crow.   <br />
  <br />
“Oh, so we’re fighting after all, eh?” Xarxos asked, getting himself ready to fight. “You should’ve at least given me a heads up!” The minotaur looked around, grabbing a dildo off the end table next to the couch. He hurled the sex toy at Mark, hitting him on the forehead. The snow leopard recoiled in pain for a brief moment before shaking off the pain, only to find Xarxos charging right for him. Before Mark could react, the minotaur grabbed the book and tried to pull it from Mark’s grasp.   <br />
  <br />
“Give me the book, you stupid cat!” the bull shouted, pulling on the book.   <br />
  <br />
“Like hell, I will!” the snow leopard roared, pulling the book in the opposite direction. Suddenly, both Mark and Xarxos stumbled backward, with Mark slamming against the wall and Xarxos tripping and falling onto his ass. When they looked down at their hands to see who was holding the book…  <br />
  <br />
“You idiot!” Xarxos shouted, holding up a red and silver book with a flask and a dragon on it. “You made the book split!”   <br />
  <br />
“<i>I</i> made them split?” Mark asked sarcastically. “You were the one who tried to take the book from me!” The snow leopard held up a gray and green book with a human body and a paw print on it.   <br />
  <br />
“Whatever!” The minotaur pointed at Mark. “Lesser shift!” A beam of energy shot out of Xarxos’s finger, and Mark leaped out of the way just in time. The beam crashed into the wall behind where Mark had been standing and dissipated.   <br />
  <br />
“What the fuck?!” the snow leopard shouted. “Why can I suddenly see the spells you cast?!”   <br />
  <br />
The minotaur shrugged. “Probably because we’re fighting,” he guessed. “Never seen this before.”   <br />
  <br />
“We’ll question it later! Shape!” A spell shot out of Mark’s finger. Xarxos quickly grabbed a chair from the nearby kitchen table and blocked the spell. He threw the chair to the side before casting a spell of his own.   <br />
  <br />
“Lesser shift!”  <br />
  <br />
The spell missed, flying out one of the windows.   <br />
  <br />
“Shape!”  <br />
  <br />
That spell also missed, flying out a window as well.   <br />
  <br />
Mark growled as his spell missed. “Half!”   <br />
  <br />
The spell shot out of his fingertip towards Xarxos. With quick thinking, the minotaur grabbed a picture frame off the wall and held it in front of the spell. The spell bounced off the picture frame and hit Todd. As soon as he felt a shiver down his spine, the smaller feline snapped out of his lust-fueled trance and looked at what was happening in horror.   <br />
  <br />
“Guys! What the hell are you doing?!” he shouted, but he was drowned out by the sound of spells being fired and either completely missing or hitting an unintended target. As he began squirming to try and get free, the twink failed to notice the changes that were happening to him.   <br />
  <br />
His white fur began to dull, turning orange. As his fur continued to change colors, the fur on the inside of his thighs became stayed white. The white fur encompassed his crotch, stomach, chest, neck, the front of his muzzle, and his cheeks.   <br />
  <br />
Todd’s muzzle grew slightly as his nose turned black. His cock lost its feline appearance, turning red and growing a knot. As the fur on his paws and his hands turned black, his tail grew larger and fluffier, complete with a white fur tip.   <br />
  <br />
As he continued to squirm, Todd’s body began to gain more muscle definition. His pecs grew slightly as his core became more defined, giving him a twunkish physique. As his biceps gained a bit more muscle, the canine found himself able to slip out of the machine’s grasp, falling to the floor with a THUD!   <br />
  <br />
“Ow, that smarts…” Todd said, rubbing his ass. As he pulled his hand back, he caught a glimpse of his new fur color, which made his eyes widen. Standing up, the canine began examining himself frantically before running over to a nearby mirror. He looked in the mirror and gasped at what he saw.   <br />
  <br />
Staring back at him was a twunk anthro fox, with very nice fur and great-looking abs. The young fox flexed his biceps and couldn’t help but grin dopily.   <br />
  <br />
“God damn, I look fucking great…” he said to himself, flexing a little bit more. The sound of something being smashed snapped Todd out of his trance, and the fox remembered why he had tried to get out of the bondage machine in the first place.   <br />
  <br />
Mark and Xarxos were still fighting, casting spells at each other. Neither of them seemed to be particularly accurate with their spells, much to Todd’s relief, but the fox felt his heart sink when he saw some of their spells fly out of the windows. Terrified of what he’d see outside, the large feline slowly approached the nearest window and peeked outside, and his eyes widened in horror.   <br />
  <br />
Outside, numerous animals were running through the street. A raccoon was rummaging through the trash, looking for something to snack on. A crow was hopping around on the sidewalk, looking for anything shiny to pick up. Not far from there, a pair of foxes were busy having sex. A pair of rabbits hopped into view, but upon closer inspection, Todd realized that they were jackalopes. The fox shook his head and backed away from the window, a terrified expression on his face.   <br />
  <br />
The spells that had flown at the windows had hit innocent bystanders.  <br />
  <br />
While Todd had his back turned, Mark swung a chair at Xarxos and it smacked the Minotaur’s side, causing the tattoo on his arm to fly off. As it flew through the air, the tattoo became three-dimensional and changed shape, turning into a thick, black book that landed face down at Todd’s feet. The minotaur held his arm and grit his teeth, but continued to fight Mark, throwing a punch at his jaw. Upon hearing Mark cry out in pain, Todd turned around, all fear in his body being replaced by rage.   <br />
  <br />
“WOULD YOU TWO STOP FIGHTING?!”   <br />
  <br />
Mark and Xarxos immediately stopped what they were doing, and their eyes widened upon seeing the fox.   <br />
  <br />
“Todd?!” Mark asked, looking the fox up and down. “What happened to you?!”   <br />
  <br />
“Oh gee, that’s a really good question!” Todd replied sarcastically. “If I had to guess, and this is just a guess, but I think that one of your GODDAMN SPELLS HIT ME DURING YOUR FIGHT!”  <br />
  <br />
“Oh…yeah…” the snow leopard broke eye contact and scratched the back of his head in embarrassment.   <br />
  <br />
“What the hell were you two even fighting about?” the fox asked, looking at Xarxos.   <br />
  <br />
“Well,” the minotaur started. “We were fighting over-” Xarxos was cut off as a strange feeling washed over his body. It felt like a build-up of static electricity. For a split second, the minotaur was confused, but that confusion quickly gave away to horror. The bull ran to the nearest window and looked out, his eyes widening at the sight.   <br />
  <br />
“Oh fuck…” Xarxos said quietly. “Fuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK! This is bad! This is very, <b>VERY</b> bad!”   <br />
  <br />
“What? What’s going on?!” Mark asked. “Why is my fur starting to stand up?!” The bull turned and looked at Todd and Mark, a terrified expression on his face.   <br />
  <br />
“Paradox is coming.”  <br />
  <br />
“Paradox?!” Todd shouted. “You…I…we…we’re going to get audited!”   <br />
  <br />
“What does that mean?” Mark asked, sounding stressed. “What’s Paradox?! What happens if we get audited?!”   <br />
  <br />
“Bad things!” Xarxos snapped. “Bad things happen! We were so caught up in trying to fight each other that we didn’t think about how badly we could be fucking with reality! All those spells that went out the windows transformed random people, and now reality is going to start shifting, and Paradox will shift us with it!”  <br />
  <br />
“I-Is there anything we can do to stop it?” Mark asked, stuttering slightly. “Surely there’s something, ANYTHING, we can do to fix all of this before Paradox hits!”   <br />
  <br />
The minotaur touched the arm that Mark had hit with a chair and mouthed something, but when nothing happened, he looked down at his arm and his eyes widened in horror.  <br />
  <br />
“My book is gone…” he said. “It must have gotten lost in the fight.”  <br />
  <br />
It’s somewhere in the mess,” Todd said. “Maybe we can find it in time!”   <br />
  <br />
“Uh…I don’t think that’s an option anymore…” Xarxos was staring out the window, shaking his head in disbelief. Todd and Mark looked out the window as well, and they watched as the building directly across the street from them changed before their eyes. It lost height and began to widen, the buildings next to it disappearing as if they were never even there. The walls changed from brick to glass, allowing them to see the various plants that were growing inside the building. As the building finished changing, a sign appeared above the door that read “Forest Trail National Park Conservatory.”  <br />
  <br />
“Fuck, the town is becoming a national park!” Todd shouted.   <br />
   <br />

  <br />
Stan was walking his dog, Rocco, through the town like he did every day. Today, however, something felt off.   <br />
  <br />
A squirrel suddenly ran in front of Rocco, who barked at the small furry creature. The squirrel ran off down the street, and Rocco chased after it, dragging Stan along for the ride.   <br />
  <br />
At first, Stan wanted to tell Rocco to heel and stop chasing the squirrel, but he suddenly felt the desire to chase after the squirrel as well. Letting go of his dog’s leash, the man dropped to all fours and ran with his dog. Neither of them was aware of how they were beginning to shrink.   <br />
  <br />
Gray fur began to sprout all over Stan’s body as his clothes magically disappeared. His face pushed out into a small muzzle as his ears grew rounded and moved to the top of his head. As his hands and feet turned into small paws, a thick, bushy tail grew in. Next to him, Rocco had also gone through the same changes.   <br />
  <br />
The two squirrels chased their friend up a nearby tree, determined to beat him back to the den.   <br />
  <br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-  <br />
  <br />
Steve was out on his normal mail route, delivering the day’s mail. He reached his hand into a mailbox to grab the letters that needed to be delivered, only to feel something sticky inside. The man pulled his paw out to find that it was completely covered in honey! The man certainly wasn’t expecting this!   <br />
  <br />
As Steve began to lick his paw clean, his body began to gain mass, with black fur sprouting all over his body. As his face stretched out into a muzzle, his ears moved to the top of his head and rounded out. Behind him, a small, nubby tail pushed out of his tailbone.   <br />
  <br />
When the bear finished licking his paw clean of the honey, he looked at the hole in the tree that he had just stuck his paw in a minute ago. Could there be any more honey in there for him?   <br />
  <br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==-  <br />
 <br />
Harry was busy fixing potholes in the road on the outskirts of town. As he put another pile of dirt from the truck into the pothole, the man stopped. Why exactly was he filling in perfectly good holes?  <br />
 <br />
Tossing his shovel to the ground, Harry began to dig up the hole he had just filled. As he dug, his nails grew significantly longer, turning into sharp claws that were perfect for digging. His clothes disappeared as gray fur began to sprout all over his body.  <br />
 <br />
As his face pushed out into a muzzle, black and white fur covered his face. His hands and feet turned into paws, his body shrank slightly, though it kept its rather bulky build. The newly transformed badger continued to dig, determined to make this the best possible den for his mate.  <br />
 <br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-==- <br />
 <br />
“Fuck, this isn’t good,” the fox said. “Xarxos, isn’t there any other….” Todd turned around to face the minotaur and the snow leopard, and his heart dropped.   <br />
  <br />
The former minotaur had changed significantly while Todd had his back turned. He had gotten much smaller, and his hooves had completely turned into small dainty paws with black fur. His fur had turned orange, save for the fur on his chest, which had turned white. Behind him, a large, fluffy orange tail with a white tip wagged to and fro. The only thing that was still bovine about him was his head and his cock, but that was rapidly beginning to change.   <br />
  <br />
Xarxos’ massive minotaur meat shrank down, turning red. The head tapered out to a tip as a knot grew in at the base. His horns fell out completely as his ears moved to the top of his head. As his bovine muzzle turned into a canine one, Todd looked into the fox’s eyes.   <br />
  <br />
“Xarxos, fight it!” Todd shouted. “Don’t let the transformation win!”   <br />
  <br />
“I…I’m trying…” the fox spoke, his voice sounding raspy. “But…it hard…to…thi-yip!” Xarxos’ voice changed into a series of yips and barks. Todd could see the intelligence beginning to drain from his eyes, but the minotaur was still there. However, a smaller fox with white fur soon stumbled close to Xarxos, sniffing the air. The intelligence in his eyes was almost gone. The smaller fox looked at Todd.   <br />
  <br />
“I…love…yip!”   <br />
  <br />
The anthro fox watched in horror as intelligence drained completely from the smaller fox’s eyes. It proceeded to walk up to Xarxos and sniff his cock before giving it a few licks. Xarxos began to bark in opposition, trying to stop the smaller fox from licking him, but it was no use. The last of his intelligence drained, and the bigger fox dropped to the ground to lick the other fox’s cock.   <br />
  <br />
“Xarxos…Mark…” Todd said softly, watching the foxes that used to be his friends lick each other’s cocks. “I…I’m sorry I couldn’t help you…”   <br />
  <br />
Todd slumped down, leaning against the wall beneath the window as the room began to change around them. As he did, he felt the smooth leather cover of one of the books on his right paw. The fox looked down, saw the book, and moved it closer to him. There wasn’t anything in his book that could help him. Only the “Dispel Magic” spell from the Book of Arcane could do that. Or at least, that’s what…someone had told him. For some reason, Todd couldn’t exactly remember who told him that.   <br />
  <br />
The feeling of something cold touching his cock snapped Todd out of his thoughts.  <br />
 <br />
The anthro fox looked down and saw the two feral foxes sniffing his erection, pressing their noses against it. Todd laughed in defeat, a few tears in his eyes as he realized that this was the end for him. If he was going to be erased from reality, his last moments should at least be pleasant.   <br />
  <br />
The room began to close in around him and the other two foxes as the walls and floor turned to dirt. A hole opened in the ceiling, revealing the afternoon sky. For a brief second, Todd questioned where he was, but a new memory told him that he was in his den with his mates. Though he was rather cramped, he quickly began to feel more and more comfortable.   <br />
  <br />
The two smaller foxes began to lick Todd’s cock, making the anthro fox moan in pleasure. With his right hand still on the book, Todd spread his legs to let the two foxes get better access. As they ran their tongues up and down his length, the anthro fox began to shrink in size, becoming closer to the size of his feral brothers. His spine shifted and reshaped, locking him in a four-legged position. As his hands morphed into paws, the fox felt his intelligence draining rapidly. New memories began to flood his mind: hunting with these two foxes, sleeping in through the cold nights together in their den, frequently having sex with each other…it was all too good to resist.   <br />
  <br />
As his climax drew near and the last of his old memories began to fade, Todd muttered one last sentence under his breath.  <br />
  <br />
“Wish…I could…dispel…magic…” Todd’s eyes dulled and he couldn’t hold back anymore.  <br />
  <br />
The fox came, yipping happily, and passed out as the spell drained his energy completely, surrounded by his fluffy-furred lovers.  <br />
  <br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  <br />
  <br />
“Todd? Todd, are you okay?”  <br />
  <br />
The fox groaned as he slowly opened his eyes to see his boyfriends, Mark and Xarxos standing over him. He was lying in their huge, heavily reinforced bed. Todd blinked, wondering if that was correct, but shrugged it off. <br />
 <br />
“I-I’m fine,” Todd said groggily. <br />
 <br />
The white fox sighed in relief and hugged Todd tightly.   <br />
  <br />
“Thank God you’re okay…” Mark said, running his claws through Todd’s fur. “I was so worried when you passed out, I-”  <br />
  <br />
“I’m okay Mark,” Todd said, cutting off the other fox. He slowly sat up in bed and looked around the room. The huge, gnarled oak tree Mark had carved out and turned into his gay bar, The Den, was still intact. Everything was…normal?  <br />
  <br />
“What…happened?” Todd asked. “Did Paradox hit?”   <br />
  <br />
“I…think?” Xarxos said, the heavily muscled anthro fox shaking his head. “But…nothing’s changed. Your book must have had a spell in it that got rid of all the magic that was cast. Look outside and see for yourself.”  <br />
  <br />
Todd got up from the bed and slowly walked over to the window. He peeked outside and saw that, just as Xarxos had said, everything seemed to be back to normal. Anthros were walking down the trail, talking and socializing like their reality hadn’t almost been completely rewritten. <br />
 <br />
Steve the mailman was lumbering from mailbox to mailbox, downing a bottle of honey. The big black bear was always delivering their mail.  <br />
 <br />
Harry, a hefty anthro-badger roadworker, tipped his helmet at Steve, shovel over one broad shoulder, and tossed some gravel in a pothole. <br />
 <br />
Todd kept watching and saw a pair of anthro-foxes, three anthro-squirrels, and two anthro-jackalopes enter The Den, lust on their faces. He knew the squirrels and the foxes. Regulars. Across the street, an anthro-raccoon was taking out the trash while chatting with his neighbor, an anthro-crow.   <br />
  <br />
A perfectly normal day in Forest Trail, Arizona, where anthros like himself lived in harmony with nature. <br />
 <br />
“But…I don’t understand…” Todd said, turning back towards Xarxos and Mark. “I thought that only the Book of Arcane could dispel magic like that…”  <br />
  <br />
“I guess we were wrong,” Xarxos said quickly, shrugging his massive shoulders. “Maybe all the books have some kind of hidden spells or powers that we’re unaware of.”  <br />
  <br />
“Yeah…maybe…” Todd paused for a second, thinking about something, before speaking up. “Why the hell were you two fighting?”   <br />
  <br />
Mark opened his mouth to explain, but Xarxos quickly cut him off.  <br />
 <br />
“We can discuss that later,” the minotaur said. “Right now, I think we should start planning our next move.”   <br />
  <br />
“Our next move?” Mark asked. “What do you mean?”   <br />
  <br />
“We’ve been sitting here for long enough. Todd’s use of the book has improved dramatically, and I think that he’s ready to fight Time.”   <br />
  <br />
Todd’s eyes widened. “A-Already?!” he stuttered. “B-But…I’ve only been training for a few days! I don’t even know anything about Time or what his powers are!”   <br />
  <br />
“I’ll explain on the flight to Vegas,” Xarxos said, brushing off Todd’s concerns. “Start packing. We leave tomorrow morning.”</p>
