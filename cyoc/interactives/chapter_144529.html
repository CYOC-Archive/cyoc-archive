<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joe Cambiari swore under his breath: “Fuck that’s going to be a long climb up.” An Out of Order sign hung next to the elevator, and his pizza delivery on the 25th floor seemed as remote as the Bronx. Joe glanced around the lobby, deserted on this late summer afternoon in Manhattan. Just as well, since he felt out of place in such an upscale entryway, his tank top, jeans, and sneakers clashing with the marble floor. Maybe he could call the customer and ask him to come down and get the pie. Joe hefted the large pizza box in one hand as he clicked through the dial pad by the door. This was easy: his hands, like the rest of him, were big enough to handle most things where size was an asset. He had reached 6’3” by sophomore year of high school, and might have played college sports if he had kept his grades up. He had worked at his cousin’s pizza place for a while now: sometimes it paid off to be Italian in New York.<br />
<br />
Finding the customer’s apartment number, he dialed. Joe figured he would be talking to a dude: the large meat lover’s pizza seemed like something a guy would order. His on-and-off girlfriend, Gina, always picked the pepperoni off pizzas like this one and complained about male eating habits. Joe blinked in surprise when a woman answered the call.<br />
<br />
“Hi there. Who is this?” The voice was low but unmistakably feminine, and unquestionably sexy. Joe’s thoughts, which had turned momentarily to Gina, snapped back. The woman continued, “Ah, is this the man bringing my pizza?” She pronounced each syllable slowly, as if she were slightly out of breath. Joe suddenly found himself much more willing to climb up to the 25th floor. This woman sounded like a telephone sex kitten!<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Joe mumbled, “Um, shall I bring it up?” His voice cracked on the last word, and to his embarrassment he heard a giggle through the speaker. <br />
<br />
“Oh I’m sorry to put you through the trouble since the elevator’s out,” purred the voice, “but if you don’t mind, I’ll throw in a bit extra for your effort.” The line clicked, and Joe felt his heart quicken. Seldom had he heard a woman infuse ordinary words with so much suggestion. His cousin had warned him that lonely Manhattanites – men and woman – occasionally came on strong to delivery guys, but this was his first time facing such an encounter himself. Now it didn’t seem like such a bad thing.<br />
<br />
As Joe took steps two-at-a-time up the hot, windowless staircase, he reminded himself that he hadn’t yet seen the customer: for all he knew, she could be sixty. No, surely not with that voice. Maybe she would be ugly? Again, he found it hard to believe those silken syllables belonged to a troll. By the time he reached floor 25, even his frequent gym exercises couldn’t prevent the sweat popping out on his forehead. He looked down at himself again: his tank top, fine for summer afternoons throwing dough and driving his truck, now seemed stupid. <br />
Adjusting the pizza box and making sure the pie hadn’t slid around during his ascent, he stood up straight and knocked on the customer’s door. Soon the door swung open to reveal . . .<br />
<br />
Joe’s mouth dropped open as he looked down. She barely came up to his shoulder, but her body matched her voice for sexiness. Barefoot, and bare legged, she wore only a short white robe with a sash tied tightly around her slim waist, but not tightly enough to conceal her curving cleavage. Her hair fell in bright blonde waves just over her shoulders. Leaning against the doorframe, her full-lipped mouth quirked in an inviting smile. <br />
“Oh you’ll work well” she said, her long-lashed eyes flicking down and then up again, seeming to survey his whole body. It was the same voice alright, but for a moment, Joe wondered what that could mean. But her next words distracted him again. <br />
<br />
“Thanks for the pizza handsome.” She didn’t even reach for it as her voice resumed the same suggestiveness as before. “So what do I owe you for bringing it all the way up here?” <br />
She knew exactly what she was doing, thought Joe. This felt almost like a cliché, something out of a mid-budget porn film. Even her words sounded a little rehearsed, but the sight of those breasts barely held in place by her thin robe, rising and falling as she breathed, kept Joe from thinking about it too much. He only managed to say “Here,” as he lifted the pizza box once more. She giggled again and reached toward the pizza box, but her cool fingers landed instead on his hand. “You must be thirsty after that climb. Come on in.”<br />
<br />
Inside, Joe was in for another surprise. “Is this your place?” The leather couches, tv with a video game console, and the framed football poster didn’t strike him as a single woman’s decorations. Was this her boyfriend’s place? Or worse, was she married? Was he going to have to explain to some guy just what he was doing with his scantily clad girlfriend?<br />
<br />
“Oh yes,” she turned and bent to open a mini fridge tucked into the base of a wooden bar in one corner. The robe she wore rose up, her round buttocks pressing against the fabric. “It’s just me here. And,” she turned back around, two bottles of Mexican beer clasped in her delicate hands, “Now you’re here too.” Joe’s cock twitched and began to stiffen. As she handed him the beer, her eyes swept down and he knew she could see it too. She continued to smile as they both took a drink of beer, and gestured at the leather couch. “Go ahead, I wouldn’t be a good host . . .ess, if I didn’t let you sit.” She had paused mid-sentence, her eyes sliding away toward the hallway, but then returned and locked with his. They were a beautiful gray-green. <br />
<br />
“I . . .” Joe was finding it difficult to focus. He sat down on the sofa, semi-surreptitiously shifting his cock as it pressed uncomfortably against the fabric of his jeans. He knew there was no use hiding it, and maybe he shouldn’t, but he felt like, in her apartment, she had to make the first decisive move. He didn’t have to wait long. Just as he sat back on the couch, the woman leaned forward and placed one knee on the leather surface beside him, shortly followed by the other so that she was straddling him. He gasped as she placed one hand on his chest, and used the other to tilt his chin up to look at her. Her eyes gleamed, and her lips puckered in mock kiss. “Let’s not forget about the pizza big boy,” she said, “I’m sure I owe you more than the tip.”<br />
<br />
He couldn’t hold back any longer, and leaned forward into a deep kiss. She tasted so sweet, her lips felt so soft. He caught a whiff of his own sweat as she yanked his tank top over his head, but she didn’t seem to mind, briefly kissing him through the fabric while it still covered his face before freeing him from it entirely. He grasped both her breasts through the robe, even his big hands feeling full with the size of them, and he used his thumbs to tease open the robe still further. Braless, both breasts fell free, and she pulled him closer to rub his face between them. He began to use his tongue, and she moaned. “Oh god,” she said, “no wonder they like this.” Joe didn’t hear her, or at least didn’t register what she said.<br />
<br />
Joe felt her hand sliding down his hairy chest and over his abs, his sweat speeding its progress downward, before she grasped his belt and began to unbuckle it. He began kicking his sneakers off, using his toes to remove his socks as she finished with his belt and, tantalizingly slowly, began to loosen each button of the fly of his jeans. With only one button left, the woman sat backward, her bare breasts above his head, and removed her own sash. He grabbed her thighs to steady her as she slipped out of her one article of clothing, leaving her completely naked, the mound of her pussy poised just inches above his crotch. <br />
<br />
Joe has lost his virginity at sixteen to a local college girl, but this was by far the most erotic experience he’d had. A stunningly hot, almost bafflingly eager woman with an intoxicating voice and breasts to die for now looked ready for him to do just about anything. He’d never had sex like this, with a complete stranger. Funny, he thought, he’d never skipped oral sex before jumping into the real deal either. Usually, the women he’d been with liked to take things slowly. Not this one.<br />
<br />
“I want you to pound me like there’s no tomorrow” said the woman, running two fingers down toward her own pussy, teasing it herself. “Give me everything you’ve got.” She reached down and yanked so hard that the last button of his fly ripped through the fabric. She tugged at both pants and boxers, freeing his large cock which smacked stiffly against his abs as he kicked to get his pants all the way off. He felt drunk, a little out if his mind as he saw her grab his throbbing cock and squeeze, a shining drop of precum dripping from the tip. “Uncut, nice dude,” she said. Again, something about the way she said it struck him as odd, but he couldn’t get distracted now. She was holding his cock upright, and now she was leaning forward again, lowering herself, her warm, clean shaven pussy lips meeting his cock head.<br />
<br />
The sensation of his bare skin on hers suddenly brought him back from the edge of delirium. He wasn’t wearing a condom! “Hold up,” he said, even as he felt her pussy begin to open up, his cock beginning to slide in at the tip. “Are you on the pi-“ his words were stifled with another kiss from her, her tongue invading his mouth as he felt his cock slide still deeper. She felt amazing, her curving body felt so cool, but the inside of her pussy radiated heat. But still, he wanted to be safe. “Are you on the pill?” he managed to gasp as she broke off the kiss. <br />
<br />
“No, but you might want to be soon.”<br />
<br />
What had she said? Her words tumbled over in his mind as he looked up at her and saw her smirk as she straddled him. What did she mean? The next thing he knew, she had reached down to his waist and pulled him into her with a deep thrust. He felt his cock sheath itself entirely inside her, felt his balls bounce against himself. Her hands were surprisingly strong for her size as they gripped his waist, forcing his cock seemingly even deeper.<br />
<br />
“Holy fuck!” Joe yelled as she began to sway back and forth, beginning a speedy rhythm. Joe had never felt like this before. At his size, he was usually the one calling the shots when it came to sex, but this woman, god, this woman really knew her way around a cock. It was almost as if she were fucking him! <br />
<br />
At this thought, he felt his balls tighten up, and familiar feeling he got when he was ready to blow his load. “I’m gonna-“ he began, but suddenly felt the woman’s finger pressed against his lips. She wasn’t even looking at him, her head tilted back as she moaned – in ecstasy matching his, Joe thought. Then, even as he felt his balls tighten still further, began to feel the tingling sensation spreading from his cock as he got ready to shoot, he realized something. “I,” he panted, “I don’t even know your name!”<br />
<br />
“Mark,” said the woman.<br />
<br />
Joe had no time to be surprised. Just as she said it, the woman reached down behind her, between them, and pressed a finger against his ass hole. Joe had heard guys talk about women doing this, but he’d never felt it done before, and the sensation, on top of everything else, sent him over the edge. <br />
<br />
“Fuck!” He felt himself cumming, erupting into her, his jizz shooting up inside her pussy. His head swam as his vision slightly darkened, black spots dancing across his eyes with the force of his orgasm. He felt the spurts of cum timed with her thrusting hips and the pressing of her finger against his ass, and knew that he’d just shot more than he’d ever cum before. This was amazing, this was, like everything about this hot afternoon, almost magical. But, something wasn’t quite right. What the fuck had she said her name was?<br />
<br />
“Keep going man,” panted the woman – or, Mark if that was really her name, “you’re doing great, but you’ve only just started.” Her voice was lower, more sultry than ever.<br />
<br />
Joe had no time to wonder what she meant. Almost as soon as she had finished speaking, he felt his balls tighten still further, beyond what he would have thought possible, and found he was on the point of cumming again! His cock had not softened a bit. He felt the woman press her finger harder directly on his asshole. This catalyzed yet another stream of jizz to burst from his cock. He’d never had a double orgasm! He closed his eyes, throwing his head back, exulting as he felt shivers roll through his whole body. “Holy shit this feels fantastic,” he gasped, “Look what you’re doing to me baby.” He felt his toes curl, just like in a porn film, felt even his hands going numb with the sheer force of it.<br />
<br />
“There you go stud. You’re nowhere near done.” <br />
<br />
Joe opened his eyes, and swore again. But this time, it was in surprise, and a little horror. The woman’s blonde hair was gone. How had she cut her hair in the last minute? Now she sported a short, almost manly haircut, bangs falling in her face where it had been long before. Joe found himself looking up into a face that no longer resembled the beautiful woman he’d been fucking only a moment before.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck… happened to you?” Joe gasped out. He was stunned by the change in her looks, but found his cock was as hard as ever, and seemed to continue to thrust into her almost as if it were beyond his control. Inexplicably, he felt another wave of cum building up, ready to blow. The tingling in his hands and feet, numb from the last orgasm, seemed to spread further.<br />
<br />
“To me?” said Mark, continuing to play with Joe’s ass, “I’d be much more interested in what’s happening to you, if I were you.”<br />
<br />
Joe gasped as he felt the tingling in his limbs suddenly change, becoming a full pins-and-needles sensation throughout them. It almost felt like they were tightening, just as his balls did with each new onrush of cum. He raised his arms up, removing his hands from Mark’s buttocks where he had gripped her, and took a good look at them. They *were* tightening. Before his eyes, he saw his large hands begin to shrink, his fingers slimming, his nails narrowing. The dark hair that had dusted the backs of his hands since he was a teenager suddenly fell away, leaving his hands smoother and seemingly lighter than before. In a moment, all the hair on his arm had disappeared too, and his thick forearms began to deflate, slimming and shortening.<br />
<br />
“Jesus!” Joe cried, frightened. He tried to wrench himself away, but found himself cumming even though he was scared shitless. Jets of cum left his cock yet again, and Mark’s unusually strong hands held him in place: one now pressed down on the center of his chest, the other still pressed against his ass. Was it even possible for one guy to produce this much sperm? Joe tried to push Mark away, but found his arms felt weak, weaker than they’d been since he was a kid. Tingling surrounded his biceps as they shrank too, leaving his upper arms as smooth and delicate as his hands and forearms had become.<br />
<br />
“Good boy,” said Mark as the cum continued to flow out of Joe. She looked down at Joe’s chest where her hand held him down. “Oh it’s really starting now. This will be fun.”<br />
<br />
Joe looked down as he felt a new sensation, warm this time, begin to spread across his chest. His nipples hardened like they did in very cold weather, but rather than shrinking, they began to widen, the dark areolas spreading wider. As they did, his pecs began to bulge, puffing upward, but even as they did Joe could feel the muscles melt away inside him. He was growing breasts! He was shocked, but still somehow, his cock throbbed and he felt more cum ready to emerge. He could do nothing but moan as he felt his new breasts engorge, feeling as if thousands of new nerves were building inside them. They rose further and further, B cups swelling into Ds and beyond, until their weight became too much and they began to settle, the full curves of them resting a little lower on Joe’s chest as their growth slowed.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing to me?” cried Joe. He found his voice was cracking terribly: he knew something was terribly wrong. Had she slipped him some kind of hallucinogenic drug? He tried once again to pull away, but was astonished to feel the new weight of his breasts against his upper body as he struggled to free himself. Then he saw that the woman, Mark’s, breasts had almost vanished. Mark’s chest was looking more and more manly by the second, the nipples shrinking and flattening just as Joe’s had swelled and rounded. Mark pressed down on Joe’s chest harder, and then grasped one of his new breasts firmly. Joe yelped at the sensation. It was like someone grabbing his balls, they felt so tender! But then Mark lifted his thumb and circled it around Joe’s newly expanded areola, and a wave of pleasure shot through him, causing him to go over the edge again and release more cum up into Mark.<br />
<br />
“Enjoying yourself there?” Mark smirked. She really wasn’t looking much like a she any longer. Joe watched as Mark’s neck thickened, muscles building across broadening shoulders. At the same time, he felt his own shoulders tighten, pulling in on themselves, his own neck becoming smaller. “I think you’ve figured out what’s happening to you Joe,” laughed Mark. “Every time you cum in me, you’re giving up a little more of your masculinity. Come on: give it all to me.”<br />
<br />
Joe cried out, his cracked voice becoming higher pitched as he felt his body change more and more rapidly. His legs, which had been extended way out from the low couch, now barely touched the floor. He could feel his feet shrinking, the blood seeming to leave them as their size diminished rapidly. At the same time his thighs ballooned outward, causing friction as his ass widened on the leather couch. Mark at last removed the finger from Joe’s hole as Joe’s buttocks inflated, swelling with his hips to give him an hourglass figure. His abs shrunk and then disappeared, his midriff becoming smooth but completely unmuscled, and looking down he could see he’d become completely denuded on body hair. He was appalled, shocked . . . but, at the same time, he found he was turning himself on. He was becoming exactly like the women he’d always desired. But, that was crazy!<br />
<br />
In contrast, Mark’s chest began to erupt with hair, far more than Joe had ever possessed. It was dark blond like Mark’s hair, and spread in whorls over his chest and across an emerging six pack. Mark’s arms also became hairy, and his hands, which now both descended to knead Joe’s breasts, sprouted hair on the knuckles. Joe realized he was now thinking of Mark as a definite “he.” All except one thing.<br />
“Go ahead ‘Julie,’” said Mark, placing emphasis on the feminine name as he rolled it off his tongue, “I think one last good cum and you won’t have to worry about cleaning that foreskin again for a while. I can feel you shaking: are you trying to hold back?”<br />
<br />
Joe bucked against Mark’s growing weight, feeling the man’s new muscles holding him down more firmly than ever. “You… you’re turning me into a girl?” he spat, realizing even as he did that his voice had assumed a permanently high tone, “I . . . this can’t be real!”<br />
<br />
“Hmm, why not?” Mark shook his head, and moved his hips some more. Joe’s cock felt like it was literally vibrating, his balls almost so tight that they would disappear inside him all together. “This is real baby,” continued Mark. He leaned down and suddenly Joe could feel Mark’s stubble brushing against his face. “It’s all real, and you’re going to give me one last good cum. Think of that: your last bit of manliness squirting away.” While he spoke, Joe became aware of the musky odor of male sweat emanating from Mark. Towering above as he held him down, Joe could see hair becoming denser in Mark’s pits, where the new scent was strongest, as well as feel coarse hair rubbing against his crotch where they remained joined by Joe’s cock. Joe suddenly began to wonder what it would be like to have a cock inside himself.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, imagine giving it all to me baby. You’re going to feel those chiseled features that have probably gotten you so many girls start to fade away, softening.” As Mark spoke, Joe did indeed feel a pressure in his long, straight nose as it seemed to shrink. He gritted his teeth even as he felt his mouth shrinking, his lips plumping up, his cheeks flushing pink from the exertion of holding back. His scalp tingled now, and he had to shake his lengthening black hair away from his face. Mark’s features sharpened, his nose cracking as it became larger, his eyebrows thickening, his jaw jutting as he grew a strong chin even as the stubble increased.<br />
<br />
“Hey there. You’re really turning out to be hot, Julie.” Mark brushed his fingers against Joe’s increasingly feminine face. “Why don’t you let it all go and enjoy yourself.” Then Mark kissed him, his stubble thickening to a full, soft beard as Joe’s own lips plumped still further. As his tongue thrust one more time into Joe’s mouth, Joe groaned and felt himself cumming. This time, it felt different. Accompanying the feeling was a sensation of releasing a long-held stream of piss, Joe thought. It was deeply satisfying, cumming what felt like ropes of semen, but the feeling also left an emptiness in him. Joe felt his balls shrink to nothing as waves of pleasure emanated from where his body joined to Mark’s, but it was becoming harder to tell where one ended and the other began. Joe looked up into Mark’s face and saw his Adam’s apple clearly visible even under his thick beard. Joe felt his cock shrinking at last, spent, but it didn’t just become soft. He felt it truly shrinking, and looked down between them in time to see it flopping out of Mark looking no more than an inch long. <br />
<br />
“This is it baby!” Mark crowed as his pussy swelled, distending, and then formed into a thick cylinder, rapidly stiffening. Joe felt himself breathing fast. He’d just lost his cock, his last sense of manhood, and now he was watching as this gorgeous woman, at least the hairy guy who had been a woman minutes before, grew a brand new cock. Mark’s cock engorged, thickening, bigger than Joe’s had been. Joe could only stare in amazement, but found himself wondering again just what it was like to have another guy’s cock inside him. <br />
<br />
“Ok, time to really make you into Julie” said Mark, and Joe knew he was going to find out exactly what that felt like.</p>
