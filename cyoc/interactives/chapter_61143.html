<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake's yearbook photo was scanned in, and the screen read &quot;INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION.&quot; There was also a help <br />
note: &quot;Would you like a remote app to scan subject Jake?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dean grinned and clicked yes.  He knew that Jake had one of those Android phones from T-Mobile. After Dean <br />
downloaded the app to his phone, he phoned Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatcha want?&quot; Jake answered. He had no idea, Dean was uploading the app to his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to talk to you about Russell Tanner,&quot; Dean said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's jock boy want with me?  I doubt he wants me to shove my cock into his mouth or ass, unless he's a real <br />
closet case. By the way, where were you today, Dean?  I usually can count on you for an after lunch bj.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I was hampered from coming to school,&quot; Dean said with a snicker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so what's Tackle Dummy want with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He wants you to help him have as much sex as you do,&quot; Dean said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, he wants to score off the field does he?  AC or DC?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, he said to score like you do, Jake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AC/DC it is then. My kind of guy. Well, that improves his odds of getting laid. Since he's on the football <br />
team, he should be getting tail all the time. I'm guessing it's a confidence thing. I'll give him a pep talk <br />
if you like after the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That'd be great, Jake.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dean grinned the the app had downloaded and synced with the Chronivac, Jake's vitals appeared on the screen. <br />
He had been scanned and cataloged and was ready to begin his reprogramming. He was going to be the ultimate <br />
wingman.<br />
<br />
&quot;So boxers or briefs?&quot; Dean asked as he prepared to design Russell's new snakeskin underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which should he wear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Boxer briefs,&quot; Jake replied his intonation implied that there was no other option.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, boxer briefs it is,&quot; Dean typed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, with a cock ring. You gotta lift the genitalia away from the body. It really enhances the bulge, and <br />
makes people stare. As soon as a guy or girl locks eyes on the bulge, you know you can have them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Built in cock ring,&quot; Dean muttered, as he typed, &quot;Which also excrete a powerful aphrodisiac pheromone which <br />
arouses both male and females.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really like being around Russell Beauregard Tanner,&quot; Dean said and typed.<br />
<br />
&quot;His middle name is Beauregard?&quot; snickered Jake, then suddenly he said in contented voice, &quot;I do like being <br />
around Russell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to go into the locker room about 5 minutes before the end of the game. You need to strip out of your <br />
clothing and stash them under Russell's shoes in his locker.  Then you have to shower, and when Russell <br />
enters, you'll be Russell's lucky snake skin boxer briefs hanging in his locker. When Jeff changes back, he <br />
can wear your clothes home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you tal- uh, yes, I'm going to be owned by Russell Beauregard Tanner.  I'm going to be his lucky <br />
undies, and I'll increase his sex drive a hundred fold. He'll be a regular sex machine. He'll have to fuck <br />
everybody, and they'll let him,&quot; Jake said confidently.<br />
<br />
Five hours later, Jake was under the bleachers getting a blow job from the assistant coach, and grinning with <br />
the knowledge that Russell's nine inch cock would soon be penetrating that same coach's ass. Jeff heard <br />
gurgling sounds as he passed the bleachers and entered the football team's locker room, but he didn't <br />
investigate. Jeff was so excited. He had run over wearing only an old pair of grey flannel shorts and some old <br />
sneakers.  He figured he could retrieve them from the lost and found after Russell had finished needing him as <br />
his jockstrap. He shucked the shorts and shoes and tossed them into the wet towel bin. Then he climbed into <br />
Russell's locker and squatted down naked behind Russell's uniform.  At precisely six hours after Russell had <br />
left Jeff's house, he pressed his remote, and Jeff returned to his form as Russell's new lucky jockstrap.<br />
<br />
This had to be the best game Russell ever played.  He was totally on defense this game. The other team never <br />
scored a single touchdown. Russell even managed four interceptions, and one touchdown himself. The other team <br />
managed one field goal, and lost by 36 points. The players came in euphoric with Russell hoisted up on their <br />
shoulders. He stripped out of his gear and paused before putting it in his locker.  There were a pair of shiny <br />
snake skin boxer briefs hanging in his locker. He grinned, it had to be Jake. He was going to get some tail <br />
tonight.<br />
<br />
He showered with his team mates, toweled off, and then slipped into his silky new spandex boxer briefs. Jake <br />
caressed Russell's damp skin. Jake's mind seemed to mesh with Russell's and he guided the novice Russell's <br />
hands in how to secure the cock ring. The effects were amazing. Russell's sex drive kicked into overdrive. His <br />
balls swelled up like baseballs and he began to sweat intoxicating pheromones. He suddenly saw his team mates <br />
as something else besides buds and team mates, they were holes that needed filling. His balls continued to <br />
swell, he started to sweat. He needed relief right away.<br />
<br />
Mike Farrow was the nearest player to Russell when the pheromones power kicked in. Mike gasped. He was a <br />
straight arrow sort of guy, but now he couldn't take his eyes off Russell's bulge. He walked up to Russell and <br />
whispered, &quot;Say, Russ, uh, what say we take in a sauna before we finish dressing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Russell's locker was at the far end of the locker room from the sauna, showers and steam room. Russell simply <br />
nodded and started walking toward the sauna. Like the pied piper of Hamlin town all the guys stopped dressing <br />
or undressing or whatever they were doing and followed Russell. All their mouths and asses were watering in <br />
anticipation of becoming notches on Russell's bedpost.<br />
<br />
The sauna was a regular orgy. Russell was so rapt in sexual ecstasy that he didn't care that the holes he was <br />
filling with his seemingly endless supply of cum. The pheromones that Jake was generating remapped the neural <br />
pathways of all the players.  They accepted this gay sex fest as not only normal, natural camaraderie among <br />
men, but that there was nothing gay at all about it. They filed out of the sauna with their butts clenched <br />
tight to keep Russell's gift inside them as long as possible. They each felt special and happy with Russell's <br />
warm goodness inside their bowels.  They dressed and went to join the girlfriends and families, just like <br />
always. <br />
<br />
Jake strutted out of the sauna as an exhausted Russell slept.  He frowned as he looked at his clothes and at <br />
Russell's clothes.  His clothing was way too small for Russell's body, and Russell's clothing was too thrift <br />
store. He bit Russell's tongue lightly between his teeth.  He liked this body, and he was hornier than ever. <br />
He knew he could have anyone he wanted, and he wanted a big fish tonight. He fished his motorcycle keys and <br />
wallet out of his clothes, and used the remote in Russell's jeans to change Jeff back from being a jockstrap. <br />
He sniffed Russell's ripe jeans and grinned.  Jeff took a deep breath, and found his devotion to Russell <br />
become more extreme. He licked his lips and looked down at the massive bulge in the snake skin boxer briefs.<br />
<br />
&quot;On your knees,&quot; were the words Jeff heard coming from Russell's lips, while it was Russell's voice, it didn't <br />
sound like Russell. <br />
<br />
Jeff shrugged and obeyed blindly.  Five huge loads later, Jeff burped as his stomach felt bloated. Russell's <br />
body was dressed in Russell's clothing, and was out the door. Minutes later, Jake maneuvered Russell's body on <br />
Jake's motorcycle.  The center of gravity was higher, so he had to adjust his driving style. He could already <br />
feel his balls churning up many more loads. He sped down the highway toward his goal. His biggest sexual <br />
conquest to date...</p>
