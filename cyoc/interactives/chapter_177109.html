<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd yawned as the bell rang in the distance to wake everyone up. It was routine every morning at Camp Critterlake, first bell to wake up counselors, second for campers, third was for breakfast. Counselors had to be up and ready to deal with campers as soon as they started filing out of their cabins. Todd rolled over and stared at the cabin ceiling. How the hell did he know that? He brought his hand up to rub the sleep from his eyes and try to even out his thoughts but then caught sight of his hand. His fingers looked tanned and his nails were black, and what was with all that reddish-brown hair on his arm.. no not hair.. fur?<br />
<br />
Everything finally came crashing in and Todd sat up in bed with more ease than he had in years, twisting to drop his feet to the floor. Normally his 50 year old body would have been stiff and his back aching, but he popped out of bed with such ease, and no wonder he thought as he looked down at himself. His body was lean and lithe, much as it had been in college, but that was where the similarity stopped. Most of him, barring his chest and stomach was covered in the same reddish-brown pelt. And his feet.. his feet looked like another pair of hands if maybe a bit longer. He felt his tail twitch in annoyance and looked over to see the long furred appendage snaking out behind him, experimentally he moved it around, curling and uncurling it. Quickly he ran into the bathroom and stared in the mirror. A monkey face stared right back at him, small nose, wide mouth, big ears. He ran his tongue along one sharp canine. The hair on his head was a bit on the long side, instinctively he grabbed a band from the counter next to the sink and pulled his hair back into a short ponytail. He was young, he didn&#39;t know how he could tell but he knew he was nineteen.<br />
<br />
Part of him was shocked, and part of him wondered why he should be shocked. &quot;Jeeze, snap out of it, Todd. This is not normal.&quot; He slapped himself across the cheek, but he still looked the same when he looked back. Then, curiously, he pulled his underwear away from his waist and looked down. That at least looked normalish, if a bit bigger than he was used to sporting. A surprised shout brought his attention back to reality and he popped his head out of the bathroom to peer at the person he had forgotten he was sharing a cabin with.<br />
<br />
George had flung back the sheets to get a better look at himself, and considering he slept naked that gave Todd a full view. George was the buffest rabbit he had ever seen. Long ears sat straight up on his head, twitching furiously, and he was covered from head to toe in white fur, except for brown hair on his head, styled short and a tuft of brown fur on his chin like a goatee. He was slightly smaller than he had been, shorter than Todd was now, but still sported his muscled jock body. Huge feet hit the ground as he stood up and spun in place, as if trying to see his backside, which Todd did get a good look at, a nice butt topped with a short tail. And like Todd he was young, Todd new his bunkmate was 18, he didn&#39;t know how he knew but he knew.<br />
<br />
God, he was kind of cute. Cute?! What was Todd thinking, he had a wife and.. did he have kids? Of course he did. He couldn&#39;t be thinking of his fellow counselor as cute. He couldn&#39;t even tolerate George. But they had worked together all summer so far and were getting along. Todd shook his head, trying to clear it again.<br />
<br />
George finally noticed Todd and strode over, giving him a solid poke in the middle of the chest, those tall ears of his laying backwards. &quot;You! What the fuck did you do this time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?!&quot; Todd said as he brushed away the finger poking his chest. &quot;I didn&#39;t do anythin..&quot; Todd trailed off as he looked down at George&#39;s naked form, especially the morning wood pointed right at him from between the rabbit&#39;s muscular thighs. He felt his own cock stirring in response, tenting out his underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you...?&quot; George looked down as well, and his ears shot right up and quivered. Todd knew that meant he was embarrassed without even having to think of it. George looked like he couldn&#39;t decide between covering up and standing his ground. They were both saved from having to figure out what was going on by the door to their cabin opening.<br />
<br />
Alex poked his head in. Todd instinctively knew it was the head counselor, even though the young twenty something he met yesterday was at the moment a leanly muscled badger. Something about the smile and demeanor was exactly the same though. If he looked perturbed by walking in on two of his employees in a rather provocative situation he didn&#39;t seem to register it. &quot;Good! You two are up! Get dressed and down to the dining hall, you&#39;re on the serving line this morning. You&#39;ve got thirty minutes&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd groaned. He hated standing there dishing out food for the campers, but he nodded. &quot;Sure thing, Alex, we&#39;ll be there.&quot; George was nodding his agreement. Alex gave them a thumbs up and disappeared.<br />
<br />
George snapped again. &quot;Wait! What the hell is going on? Why did I? Who?&quot; Todd just left George stammering there as he turned to grab his stuff for a quick shower, no way he was going to work the food line and reek.</p>
