<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve drove into the garage at what he assumed was 1 mile per hour, managing to get the self-driving to stop right before hitting the front wall.  He waited for the garage door to close and then, once he was sure that no one outside could see his skunky, pregnant body, he set himself to the task of figuring out what to do.<br />
<br />
The first problem he needed to tackle was getting his cell phone out of the back seat.  He felt so stupid for having given into his weak, girly impulses earlier and tossing it back there, especially since his new belly was acting as a heavy anchor that limited his mobility to the point that he wasn’t able to reach back far enough to grab the phone.  Plus, even if he had the dexterity to twist his body around – and he thoroughly doubted that he did – there was no way that he’d been able to climb over the center console with his pregnant belly in the way.<br />
<br />
After a few failed attempts at trying to stretch backwards, Steve came up with a new plan.  Opening his car door, he swung his body to the left.  Cradling his belly with his left hand, he planted his feet on the door molding and used his right hand to push off the steering column.  That let him get his skunk butt up onto the center console, from which he was able to use his tail to push the phone forward.  The skunk tail didn’t have the dexterity to grab the phone, but he was able to move the phone close enough to simply reach back with his right hand and grab it.<br />
<br />
With the phone now in hand, Steve confirmed that the battery on it was thoroughly dead.  It didn’t matter – he could charge it inside.  Still, the exertion of grabbing the phone had left him momentarily exhausted.  After panting on the center console for a moment, he exited the car the same way that he had back at the center, by slowly lowering himself onto his hands and knees.  <br />
<br />
Getting onto his hands and knees took more effort than he’d anticipated.  Lacking clothes, the only way he could carry the phone was by holding it in hand.  Although his body was smaller than it had been, he had no idea how much weight his triple pair of breasts weighed, much less the creature filling his womb.  That meant that he’d been careful not to put too much weight on the hand with the phone in it for fear of damaging it and trapping himself like this.<br />
<br />
Crawling backwards a bit, Steve managed to push the door shut, which left him with one last problem: Steve’s apartment was on the second floor, which meant that he needed to climb up a set of stairs to get up there.  <br />
<br />
Just crawling to the stairs took an inordinate amount of time as he slowly crawled step by step, pausing after every few feet to catch his breath.  Not to mention how uncomfortable it was – both his belly and his swollen breasts uncomfortably jiggled below him with every movement that he made. <br />
<br />
He crawled forward another step towards the stairs and felt his swaying breasts smashing against themselves.  “God,” Steve thought to himself, “I could really use a bra right now…”<br />
<br />
If he’d had the strength to slap himself, he would have.  “No,” whimpered a tired, girly voice, “I’m not a girl.  I’m not lact…”  Steve just sighed, “I don’t need a bra.”<br />
<br />
As he reached the foot of the stairs, Steve realized that what should be a trivial task in his old human body would be a monumental one now that he found himself trapped in the weak, gravid body of an anthropomorphic birthing slave.  Not only had the crawl from the car to the stairs been exhausting, but Steve was distinctly aware that at any moment his crushed bladder could fill up, the baby could start thrashing inside of him, he could have another false contraction or, even worse, his water could break.<br />
<br />
As that last thought went through his mind, Steve looked towards the stairs.  Halfway up was a landing, after which there was a 90 degree turn to the right before the stairs continued to the second floor.  Sitting on that landing was the skunk girl from earlier, panting as she laid on her side.  Her fur was glistened with sweat and her eyes were closed.<br />
<br />
She brought a hand to one of her breasts and cupped it as she tried to catch her breath, but all that managed to do was to cause a few white beads of milk to dribble out of her.<br />
<br />
“It’s ok,” said an exasperated, female voice, “I’m not being challenged.  Its ok for me to go to sleep and finish up tommorooowwwww owww owww owww!”<br />
<br />
The skunk’s words turned into a high-pitched shriek as she grasped at her belly.  As though a faucet had been turned on inside of her, a thick burst of fluid gushed out of her vagina, splashing onto the stairs next to her.  Steve just watched what looked like gallons of fluid poured out of her tight, wet hole.  Then, after a second seconds, the stream slowed and finally stopped, leaving nothing more than the occasional drip leaking out of her.<br />
<br />
“Please!” she cried out, “please not yet.  I… nnnfffff,” the skunk’s fragile body spasmed as the contraction spread throughout it.  “I… uhhnnn… more time… pleeeaaaahhhh!  Please… give me more time, I’ll make it to the top, I’ll…”<br />
<br />
Steve blinked as he heard one last agonized cry, and when he reopened his eyes there was nobody there.</p>
