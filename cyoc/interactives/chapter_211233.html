<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greg decided to help find the missing cat. It seemed simple enough and without much idea how combat worked, he didn&#39;t want to end up getting into something he couldn&#39;t quite handle. Looking at his thick muscular body, it seemed hard to believe much of anything could cause him any damage though either. Thick biceps and toned triceps filled both of his arms. And he wondered if he could fit any kind of shirt over his incredibly wide shoulders and massive pecs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure we should go without Jeff?&quot; Charlie asked.<br />
<br />
Greg rolled his eyes. &quot;C&#39;mon man. He really wanted to go after slimes, he can go after slimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But,&quot; Charlie spoke up. &quot;But what if we get into trouble?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we fight it off ourselves!&quot; Greg pulled out his two great axes, holding one in each hand. He was surprised how light they felt despite being so large. No matter how he tried to move them, they seemed to go exactly where he wanted them to go.<br />
<br />
A bit of a smirk appeared on Charlie&#39;s wolf face as he stared at the lion man holding his weapons out. The amount of confidence Greg was showing off, did put Charlie a bit more at ease. He quietly followed as they went past the edge of town to a small house right at the edge of the woods. Greg pounded on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;One moment dearie,&quot; an old female voice called out from the other side of the door. There was a loud scraping sound of a chair sliding back, followed by the knocking of a cane and shuffling of feet. The door opened just a crack. &quot;Why hello there,&quot; an old black cat smiled up at Greg. She opened the door wider. &quot;How may this old crone help--?&quot; However, it was quickly followed by a hiss as she saw Charlie. The door closed back to just a crack. &quot;What&#39;s that disgusting mutt doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Greg demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t deal with dogs. If you have business with me, leave the filth outside,&quot; the crone said.<br />
<br />
Greg looked to Charlie for some kind of insight. &quot;Go on,&quot; Charlie said. &quot;It&#39;s our first quest. Maybe it&#39;s worldbuilding or something. You know, cats and dogs or whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; Greg asked. Charlie nodded and stepped away from the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll wait over here,&quot; he said going to the edge of the forest. &quot;You need anything just shout.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure...&quot; Greg said.<br />
<br />
As soon as he walked away the door opened again. &quot;I&#39;ll never understand you young&#39;uns...&quot; the old woman said. &quot;To think--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Greg was a bit more terse than he needed to be. &quot;You have a missing cat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; the woman&#39;s face lit up. &quot;That I do! That I do!&quot; She motioned for Greg to come in with her cane and went into the house. The room was oddly homely. An expensive looking green couch and two red chairs sat around a brick fireplace. Something smelled like it was cooking. Greg felt his nose invaded by something overwhelmingly sweet and his massive tail flicked with excitement. <br />
<br />
&quot;It smells good, doesn&#39;t it sweety,&quot; the woman asked as she fished out a bowl and ladled a bit of soup into it. <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Greg tried to decline. &quot;I couldn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonsense,&quot; she demanded, pushing the bowel into Greg&#39;s hand. &quot;I know you have odd tastes, but no one can say no to one of granny&#39;s soups.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg found himself getting more comfortable. &#39;Maybe she just grew up in a different time,&#39; he reasoned. &#39;Or maybe she just had a lot of really bad experiences...&#39; Either way, he noticed just how much this house must have been a home for the old woman as numerous tapestries and fine dishes lined the walls. Greg took a seat on the couch as the old woman went over and stoked the flames of the fire. The strong smell of oak filled his nostrils again. He breathed in, taking it all in and relaxing more into the couch as he took another spoonful of soup.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a good kitty,&quot; granny&#39;s hand gently pet the side of Greg&#39;s mane. Her long fingers went all the way down into the thick fur, gently scratching the side of his face. He naturally leaned into the scratch. His leg jostled at the touch. &quot;Does my kitty like his soup?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm-hmmm...&quot; Greg smiled as he took another bite. Somehow it filled him with an indescribable warmth. The soup would go down his throat and fill his stomach radiating out around the rest of his body. The soft prickly feeling ran through every one of his muscles making it far easier to relax. So much so that he didn&#39;t even notice as his cock emerged from his loin cloth. Greg absentmindedly scratched at it as he took another scoop of soup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my. Does my kitty need some attention?&quot; the woman asked.<br />
<br />
Greg looked at her a bit confused. Then down at his cock.  The massive log had to have stretched nearly 9 inches long and looked to be thicker than most beer bottles. Just like his body, this part of him grew to be just as big. &quot;Oh...&quot; he slurred. &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to be sorry my little pet. Granny has just the cure,&quot; she flicked her fingers around and two blue opaque hands appeared and gently stroked the massive cock. <br />
<br />
Greg let out a loud uncontrolled moan of delight at the soft way they caressed his most sensitive area. They took their time, really making sure that all of his most sensitive areas were touched. He couldn&#39;t believe how good he felt. His body leaned more into the couch as his worries disappeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s my little kitty feel?&quot; the woman whispered in Greg&#39;s ear. Her hands were running over his body, gently petting his fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gooooooooooood...&quot; Greg moaned. His balls rested on the edge of the furniture as his cock pointed straight forward. He could feel something leaking out of him, almost like a faucet that was slightly on. The milky white contents dripped down into a large jug, slowly filling it up. &quot;Granny treats her kitties gooooooood...&quot; he moaned again. His mouth hung open as a bit of drool started to drip out of the side of his maw. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course! Granny loves to see her little pets happy!&quot; her fingers continued to pet Greg, running over his massive pecs and down his arms. However, wherever they seemed to touch, that part of his body seemed to shrink. Slowly the strong muscles lining every part of Greg&#39;s body started to deflate. Their large round status pulling in on themselves. It was all the way down to his bones as his tall 6&#39;8&quot; body dropped down to 6&#39;5&quot; then 6&#39;3&quot; then under 6&#39;. But his body continued to shrink even past that. <br />
<br />
The heavy pecs and thick abs lining his torso pulled in on themselves leaving a near flat body in front of him. Granny ran her finger around his nipple, making the much smaller cat boy squirm. He leaned into her grasp, holding tightly as she nuzzled against his face. He didn&#39;t notice as his maw turned less like a lion&#39;s and more like cat&#39;s. It shrank significantly as the wild mane surrounding his face disappeared. His rounded ears turned into points and his whiskers grew more prominent.<br />
<br />
Greg nuzzled more against granny, feeling her warmth. He didn&#39;t notice as the log that had been between his legs resembled something more like a twig with two small berries attached to it. But with each stroke from those magical hands all he could focus on was the intense pleasure coming off of them. He loved feeling their silky soft touch running down the bottom of his cock. It throbbed with delight as more and more of that milky cream drained out of his body.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before Greg felt his body thrust and the last of that cream spilled out of him. His small body convulsed as the best orgasm he&#39;d had in his entire life rocketed through his system, even if the amount of cum he&#39;d produced was next to nothing. Barely even a dollop dripped out of his cock as he felt himself finish. However, once finished, he nuzzled into Granny, purring happily in her grasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE HELL&#39;S GOING ON HERE!?&quot; Charlie burst in. <br />
<br />
Granny hissed as she stood back up. She jumped over the couch as to grab her cane and fired a spell in Charlie&#39;s direction. The wolf dodged to the right and it hit the door. He rushed forward and grabbed Greg. Granny hissed again. &quot;Give me back my kitten!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely not!&quot; Charlie shouted back. He held Greg tightly as he jumped back for the front door. Luckily there was a hole in it now and he could easily jump through. Granny rushed forward, reached out the front door, only for her hand to start burning.<br />
<br />
Granny shrieked as boils on her skin grew then ruptured. She hissed again drawing her claws out to threaten Charlie. &quot;He&#39;ll be mine one day. I swear it.&quot; The door slammed close and as Charlie blinked it disappeared.</p>
