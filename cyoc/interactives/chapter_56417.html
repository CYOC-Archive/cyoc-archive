<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Back on the yacht Rick was walking away from Eliza and Marie's cabin with Maylene <br />
and Dennis. He knew he had heard Eliza scream and didn't believe that Marie had <br />
taken Eliza on a tour of the mirrorverse. However new memories were starting to force <br />
themselves into his mind of Eliza being a glass woman able to enter the mirrorverse <br />
herself and she was indestructible like Marie. Neither of the two memories would <br />
explain why she had screamed. The only plausible explanation was that Eliza had <br />
been turned to glass. He had to wonder if it was payment for his trying to ask himself <br />
the curse. If it was he had to apologize to her before her memories started to shift. He <br />
turned to Maylene and said, &quot;Maylene, I need to do something. You and Dennis go <br />
back to your cabin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maylene smiled at him and asked, &quot;Does it have something to do with our wedding?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Rick said smiling back at Maylene. He hoped that she didn't see that he <br />
was lying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Maylene said and kissed him. &quot;If you see Eliza and Marie tell them that I <br />
want to ask them something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; Rick said and then watched Maylene and Dennis walk down the corridor. As he <br />
turned around and headed back to Eliza and Marie's cabin he felt new memories <br />
assert themselves again. He, Maylene, and Dennis had gone there so Maylene could <br />
ask Eliza to be her Maid of Honor and Marie to be a flower girl.<br />
<br />
Rick entered Eliza and Marie's cabin looking around with a sigh. He closed and locked <br />
the door then went to the mirror. Looking into it he said, &quot;Sorry Mommy. I know you <br />
told me not to use the Infinite Chaos without a familiar but I think I need to this time.&quot; <br />
He remembered the last time he had seen his mother.<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
A few weeks earlier a woman and little girl had just arrived in Glendale. The woman <br />
looked around and said, &quot;This place is steeped in magic. If there's anyplace that you'll <br />
find a familiar it should be here. Now remember Alison that until you find your familiar <br />
you shouldn't use the Infinite Chaos.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember Mommy,&quot; Alison said looking up at her mother.<br />
<br />
They walked through the bus station and collected their bags. Alison's mother had <br />
brought her daughter to this city in part to find a familiar for her and to continue her <br />
training as a witch. They would probably end up moving here as soon as they could <br />
get at least an apartment.<br />
<br />
While Alison's mother was on the phone to get a cab a man came up and said, &quot;Hey <br />
little girl I have a question for you. Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alison's mother had started to turn around to the but when he had asked the question <br />
she turned back to getting the cab. As for Alison she looked at the man and asked, <br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man didn't say anything for a minute then said, &quot;Well you get both since you didn't <br />
pick one or the other within a minute. Now let's see for your transform you will become <br />
a thirty-six year old man. When reality alters you will always remember the previous <br />
reality as well as the new reality. None of your family or friends will remember you as <br />
you are now.&quot; The man smiled which sent a chill down Alison's spine. &quot;Now for your <br />
dare,&quot; the man said still smiling. &quot;I dare you to leave Glendale and never come back <br />
and to forget that you were ever a little girl until you have sex as a female.&quot; He <br />
laughed and said, &quot;Good luck having sex as a female when you're male.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alison's dress, shoes, socks, and panties disappeared leaving her naked. She covered <br />
up her genitals as they started rearranging. Her clit grew out into a tiny dick and the <br />
lips sagged forming a ball sack. Her ovaries moved into her ball sack and change into <br />
balls. Her slit closed up and her new genitals moved forward a bit. Her brown hair <br />
shortened going from the middle of her back to a short boy's cut. Her earring holes <br />
grew shut and her transformation into a boy was complete. Her transformation didn't <br />
stop however as she started to age. Around thirteen she began to grow some hair on <br />
her legs and crotch. This hair kept growing thicker as she aged and appeared around <br />
her nipples. This too grew thicker and that hair and more hair appeared between her <br />
chest and crotch. Her shoulders broadened as she aged and eventually a little stubble <br />
appeared on her face. She had now stopped aging and briefs, socks, shoes, pants, <br />
and a tee shirt appeared on her new body.<br />
<br />
The man walked away as Alison's mother hung up the phone and turned right into <br />
Alison. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she said looking up into what had been her daughter's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's alright,&quot; Alison said smiling down at what was her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Melissa,&quot; Alison's mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Rick,&quot; Alison said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you live here?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I was just visiting,&quot; Rick said. &quot;My bus is leaving in a few minutes so I need to be <br />
going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright it was nice to meet you Rick,&quot; Melissa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was nice meeting you too Melissa,&quot; Rick said with a smile. &quot;Maybe we'll meet each <br />
other again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Melissa said.<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Rick shed a few tears as he remembered that time. His mother, friends, and childhood <br />
had been stolen from him by that man. He had tried to deny that the memories were <br />
real thinking they had to be a side effect of Kurse twisting their very souls. But now he <br />
knows that they're real which is why he wanted to be a little girl now. He placed his <br />
hands on the mirror and closed his eyes drawing on the Infinite Chaos to shift his soul <br />
into the mirrorverse.<br />
<br />
Rick felt himself move forward and opened his eyes. He knew he was in the <br />
mirrorverse now and he looked around. It looked nice and he knew he wouldn't mind <br />
spending some time here exploring. He looked down at himself and saw that he was <br />
wearing a white dress that looked like it could have come from the nineteenth century. <br />
He reached behind himself and felt longer hair. Smiling he said, &quot;Well at least I can be <br />
a girl in here. I should ask Marie to help me change my physical body back so I can <br />
have my childhood back.&quot; He looked down and frowned then said, &quot;But even if we do <br />
manage to change me back Mommy won't remember me so I'll have no family.&quot; He <br />
would have stayed there for a long time but he remembered what he came for. He <br />
needed to find Eliza before the Infinite Order decided to keep him within the <br />
mirrorverse forever. He reached out his senses and found Eliza's magic trail. Following <br />
it he took three steps and found himself looking at a group of Lupman and one human. <br />
The Lupman pup in the red dress was telling a story and as it didn't seem like anyone <br />
had noticed his arrival so he kept quiet and listened.</p>
