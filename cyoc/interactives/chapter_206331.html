<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The monsters momentarily pause the game as more men walk towards then. More hobgoblins joining the team as Mercer watches from his perch. The group reaching 20 members as they welcome the new arrivals with a slap on the arm and laugh. They&#39;re all having a great time, dividing off into two teams as the hobgoblins strip down to their jockstraps. Ten of them having red undergarments, while the remaining ones have blue. That being the deciding factor as they split between the halves of the field. 5 forwards and 5 backs for each faction, as they call off and start to run.<br />
<br />
Mercer&#39;s envy grows as the game continues. Seeing these tough monsters clash and bash against each other. He remembered the times he got to do this with his friends. How he could actually have fun before this virus had started. Why couldn&#39;t he have a little fun? These &#39;monsters&#39; seemed human enough. Just enjoying a game of Rugby with their team. They&#39;d be fine for him to join in, right?<br />
<br />
His heart starts to pound faster, the thought of breaking his brothers rules exhilarating. Egging him on to just commit to his plan as he throws caution aside and runs down the hill. The hobgoblins focused on their game, until one spots the sprinting human and calls to the others. Their sport dying down, as the creatures help each other up and watch the approaching youth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Wondered if I could join?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mercer asks the hobgoblins, he didn&#39;t even consider what would happen if they said no. One of the older and stronger monsters stepping past his team. Broad and built, neck short and legs long. Presumably one of the teams forwards, maybe one of the props if he had to guess? The monster looking serious for a moment before having an almost comical grin, looking to the rest of the team as he calls out.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the 18+ division, but let&#39;s give this human a shot!&quot;<br />
<br />
That mischievous look is shared by the rest of the team, as the leading hobgoblin steps over to Mercer and offers a sweat covered hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Thomas, and I&#39;ll be sitting out so you can show your stuff my dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mercer mimicked the teams grin. The reality that he was a puny human to their stronger monstrous bodies not apparent. The boy just happy to finally be doing something, as he shakes the creatures hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mercer. I&#39;ll show my stuff then. Maybe even make it onto the team?&quot;<br />
&quot;Always looking for more subs my man. Our big game against the greenbacks is coming up, so you arrived just in time.&quot;<br />
&quot;Great! Then-&quot;<br />
<br />
Mercer goes to join the team, but a firm hand keeps him back. Thomas looking at him with a sly smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you&#39;re not in uniform. You need to strip down.&quot;<br />
<br />
The human gulps. He has been happy to play, but getting naked with these monsters? He should have seen this coming, maybe he could weasel his way out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhhhh.&quot;<br />
&quot;Man, don&#39;t be like that. We&#39;re all dudes here, dudes who like to show off, right bros?&quot;<br />
<br />
There&#39;s cheers and hoots from the crowd. Timothy giving Mercer a wink as he grips his own jockstrap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just one round. You feel uncomfortable and we&#39;ll let you play clothed. That cool?&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s... Cool. Alright. One round.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mercer wasn&#39;t entirely convinced, but they seemed nice enough. He took off his shirt and dropped down his pants. Only in his briefs as he went to go join... And felt a firm hand again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What! C&#39;mon!&quot;<br />
&quot;Man, ain&#39;t uniform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas begins to undo his own jockstrap. The sweat covered underwear dropping between the man&#39;s feet, as his rock hard dick bursts free. This hobgoblins packing, the cocky young adult&#39;s member is at least 11 inches long. He gives it a quick stroke and steps back. Mercer watching the discarded jockstrap with a look of despair. He had already committed, and the team is all staring at him. He had to get fully changed so the game could get going. Slowly, he took off his briefs and pulled up the jockstrap. It barely fit, and was wet with what he hoped was just sweat. Thomas clapping Mercer&#39;s shoulder as he was helped to loosehead prop&#39;s position for the red team, and readied himself for the game to begin. <br />
<br />
&quot;The prop opposite you is Buddy. He&#39;s a nice guy, so don&#39;t worry about getting hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas words did little to reassure the new player. Even now, all the other hobgoblins were staring at Mercer. Sizing up the human, as he himself was feeling weird. His body was so itchy all of a sudden, and he could swear this jockstrap was starting to fit a bit better. It&#39;s probably just nerves... Yeah just nerves.<br />
<br />
As the game begun, Mercer charges forward with the rest of his frontline. Colliding against the Hobgoblin opposite him, immediate pain striking the youth as his bare skin clashed against the other man. Human far weaker than hobgoblin as he was thrown back to the ground, about to recover to his feet until the monster that threw him collapses ontop of him. Mercer sandwiched between ground and jock, as he struggled to get free. Head covered by the Buddy&#39;s pectorals, nose scrunched against his treasure trail. Beads of sweat glistening off the beasts skin and into Mercer&#39;s opened mouth. Despite being bruised and battered, something about this was nice. Though all good things must come to an end, the other prop lifting off the ground and smirking at his human captive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry bro, tripped.&quot;<br />
&quot;No prob, bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mercer smirks back. The pain from his rough impact already gone, as the hobgoblins sweat worked to adapt him to the team. Aging the youth from 16 to 18 as his chest broadens and legs elongate. A few hairs sticking out of his chest as the hobgoblins resume their positions and goes to charge again. <br />
<br />
This time he feels ready. Colliding against the prop once more. Holding his ground for a split second, before being thrown to the ground with the Hobgoblin. Buddy using this tackle to wrap his arms around Mercer. Forcing the humans face against his hair filled pits, before the two hit the ground with a rough thud. Mercer able to ignore the pain and focus only on this new pleasure. Head now covered in his opposites sweat. Absorbing his rank stench. It smells like a lockeroom, and Mercer loves it. Gripping onto Buddy&#39;s hardy back as he presses his nose further against the jocks pits. Hairs tickling his entire face, as the brute helps him with the show. Keeping a firm hand on the back of the humans head, and holding him tight. Another round of the game over as the team gathers to watch Mercer jump from 18 to 21. Legs growing out their last few inches, torso spreading to be better equipped for a forward position. Hairs filling his underarms and creating a sexy trail from abs to dick. His voice dropping ever so slightly, taking on more of what the team requires as Buddy releases him once more. Now looking to the team with that same cunning expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon guys. You can&#39;t keep throwing me into him.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others laugh as Mercer rises to his feet and gets into place. This time he&#39;ll do it. He&#39;ll show the team how he deserves a spot with then. Waiting for the call, and charging the moment he hears it. Moving buddy back a few inches, thinking he has finally gotten it before the Hobgoblin overpowers him again. <br />
<br />
Their bodies now a similar size, chest grinding against chest, head against head, dick against dick. Getting all physical with the other players triggering a hidden lust in Mercer&#39;s mind. One that he needed to explore as he ignored the game and thrusted with his new bro. Jockstraps pressing against each other, stained with sweat and now pre. The two men grasping onto the other as they worked harder and harder to expel their pent up load. Wetting their chest with a mix of their juices. Groaning and grunting to the rest of the players who watched the new show. The other members of the team lowered their own jockstraps as they stroked in unison to the men&#39;s thrusts. Everyone in the squad gathering to see a new hobgoblin be born. <br />
<br />
A few members of the crowd reached their limit early. Their voices strained as globs of cum were shot onto the two men&#39;s chest. Cum which accelerated the changes that had started. Mercer&#39;s proportions becoming more monstrous to match the man he is loving. Growing out even further, as his skin begins to turn a bright red. Mass added to his being to better stand an impact against the other players. A comfortable warmth alerting Mercer to this new surge of power, a feeling that he wholeheartedly embraced as he was brought into a kiss with Buddy. His teeth sharpening and eyes turning a bright orange. Ears gaining points and cock growing another inch. The pleasure concentrating in his lower half as he knew he was ready. Breaking the kiss to roar, and empty his overfilled balls of their new spunk. Filling his jockstrap, with some of the fluid sinking past the fabric and onto his fellows on underwear. Soaking it in seed, as the other hobgoblin joined in the yell. His own juices absorbed into Mercer&#39;s garments and skin. Followed by a flow of cum from the rest of the team as they had finally reached their own climax.<br />
<br />
Reborn as a monster, his mind was glad to accept the situation he was in. The field breaking from a game to an orgy mid practise was normal, and he was happy to be a part of it on his first day. His thoughts momentarily going to the rest of his family, Piper and Hunter needed to feel as good as he did. But first he had a game to do, and then some orcs to beat in Rugby!<br />
<br />
The team broke away, going back to their positions as if nothing ever happened. Buddy stepping off Mercer, and Thomas walking from the sidelines to help the changed man off the ground. Giving him a wink as he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the team.&quot;</p>
