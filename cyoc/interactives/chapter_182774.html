<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tydus King was gay. He knew he was and that was all that matter. No one else ever asked or cared and he didnt flaunt it. He just planned to graduate high school then go off mto college much to the disappointment of his parent who wanted him to stay home his first few years of college. He was gone to an out of state colege and experience life as out gay man.<br />
<br />
But that was months away. right now he was walking home. As he was walking he saw a turtle that looked like it was stuck and struggling. Tydus bent down helped it by releasing the plastic coke bottle holder. once free the turtlre snapped at Tydus finger. Tydus pulled back and felt a little sting that went away after a minute. he continued his walk home. <br />
<br />
That night Tydus had a weird dream. he was in a throne roonwith an old turtle like man sitting on the throne. &quot;Tydus you have saved me from that inconvenience for that I grant you one wish?&quot; <br />
Tydus could only think of one thing he want. &quot;I wish that any guyI youched would turn into a horny young twink. the Turtle man smiled, &quot;Wish granted!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tydus woke up the next barely remembering  the dream. he got dressed and headed to school like any normal day. He went to his first period class which was U.S. History. It was a boring class. The teacher Mr Gibbs would drone on from the book and never look up at the students. Most of whom were on there phone doing anything but listening.<br />
<br />
 Joey Henly was the star quarterback at school, who was already getting scholarship to any college he wanted. He was staring and listening to his phone with buds in his ears. he was laughing at something when he dropped on the floor by Tydus. Tydus still felling in a helpful mood bent over to grab it when he felt josh&#39;s hand. he immediately retracted it and went back to doing his own thing. Joey&#39;s  felt a shock when Tydus briefly touched his hand but it went away as quickly as it came. He grabbed his phone off the floor and went back to watch it.  <br />
<br />
something was churn in joey&#39;s body, it was a sharp pain that wouldn&#39;t go away. He finally couldn&#39;t  stand it anymore and asked to go the bathroom the teacher just pointes to the pass and continued to drone on.<br />
<br />
Joey ran towards the bathroom. Being a star athlete he got to use the teachers private bathroom. it has its own stall and the door can be locked.<br />
<br />
 Joey first lifted his shirt and the shock of pain turned to horror as all the hard work of creating his chiseled abs were evaporated. he still had some toneness but it looked like that going as well. His face had almost  lose all of its former manliness as it became soft and more pretty. The buzz cut hair blossomed into a golden curl that had bangs cover in ng his eyes. His lips started to puff out and his ass started sticking out as well. Joey got on the scale and his weight dropped from 265lbs to barely 115lbs now. The biggest change came when he notice he was looking up at thing instead of down. he shrunk from a tall 6&#39;5 to a meager 5&#39;4. staring at himself in the mirror, he was in a dreamlike state.<br />
<br />
His clothes were the next thing to merge with the new twink as his gym shorts rose up his legs to just above his thighs the navy boxer briefs had shrunk in on themselves and brighten a neon green. his red shirt also started to rise to become a bright green crop top with word bitch in gold glitter lettering on the front. Joey was slowing coming out of his daze as his new twinkified persona was taking over. <br />
<br />
Joey head nack to class after his quick cum session it was part of his morning routine. thankfully he had a key to teachers bathroom so he could have the privacy he needed. he put on his platform neon green flip-flops and head back to class. <br />
<br />
Joeys as opened the door and entered no one seem to notice the massive change former jock went through. That is except for Tydus, who look up when he entered and had completing memory of the former and the new Joey. <br />
<br />
Tydus could take his eyes off Joey the rest of class. Did he do this? Was that Dream real? Just then the bell rung...</p>
