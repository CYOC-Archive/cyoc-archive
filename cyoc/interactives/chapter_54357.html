<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You slowly woke up a little later feeling a bit weird. You could feel that you were lying in a bed instead of on the ground and you thought your experience was just a dream. That didn't explain what you were feeling though. You usually slept in the nude unless it was cold out, which it wasn't the last you knew, but you could feel thin straps on your shoulders and some sort of top. You could also feel that you were wearing underwear and some type of pants. You opened your eyes and saw a lady sitting next to the bed you were in. &quot;Good you're awake,&quot; she said smiling. &quot;We thought we might have lost you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; you asked and noticed that you sounded like a little girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were attacked by Hell Hounds,&quot; the lady said. &quot;They ate a good bit of you before we were able to drive them off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How come I'm not dead and why does my voice sound like a little girl's voice?&quot; you asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well with so much of you missing I had to rearrange what was left with my magic,&quot; the lady said. &quot;One of the Hell Hounds had bitten your penis off and we only have certain clothes available so I decided to make you a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You what?&quot; you asked not wanting to believe the lady.<br />
<br />
&quot;I made you into a seven year old girl,&quot; the lady said. &quot;I know you don't believe me so I'll have to show you.&quot; With that she drew back the covers revealing that you were wearing girl's pajamas. They were pink with unicorns and rainbows on them and they had ruffles at the hems of the top and bottoms. Looking at your shoulder you see the strap tied into a little bow. The lady pulled down the bottoms and you saw you were wearing a pair of white panties with pink hems and pink and yellow hearts in rows which the lady also pulled down. Your eyes went wide as you saw the genitals of a little girl instead of the genitals of an adult man. &quot;I hope this proves it to you,&quot; the lady said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I can't deny what I see,&quot; you said in a state of shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it's a shock but I hope you'll get used to being a girl,&quot; the lady said. &quot;My name is Mary by the way and I've decided to name you Jade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess I did need a new name until I return to being a man,&quot; you said. &quot;How soon will that be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don't know,&quot; Mary said looking down. &quot;I was in a rush to save your life and I didn't work the spell right. You should grow older naturally but as far as becoming male again I don't think you will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
You laid your head back down on the pillow and groaned asking, &quot;How am I supposed to explain this to my family and work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most people outside of the park don't believe in magic and transformations like what you underwent,&quot; Mary said with a sigh. &quot;You can't explain it to them and if you tried you would be considered mentally unbalanced. The best thing is to just disappear which is easy to do in the park.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to put my family through the worry though,&quot; you said groaning.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can't be helped,&quot; Mary said shaking her head. &quot;I wish it was otherwise but it isn't. Now before I forget I need you to drink something since you survived an attack by Hell Hounds. Stay in bed and I'll get it for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Mary got up you pulled the panties and pajama bottoms up and looked around. The cabin was pretty much one room with three beds, one queen size and two twin sizes. There was a dining table and a little kitchen. You figured that there was a little bathroom too. There was a door on the wall between the queen bed and the twin bed you were laying in through which Mary had disappeared. Presently she came back in and handed you a glass saying, &quot;Drink this.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sniffed it and since you didn't recognize the odor asked, &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a potion that will hopefully prevent you from turning into a Werewolf or at least let you keep your mind as one,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I wasn't bitten by a Werewolf,&quot; you said perplexed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I see that I need to give you a little lesson,&quot; Mary said with a slight smile. &quot;At one time there were no Werewolves but there have always been Hell Hounds as far as we can tell. One day a man was walking at night and he came across a Hell Hound which attacked him. The man was able to kill the hell hound but he was mangled. The doctors treated him and he lived but when the full moon came he transformed into a huge wolf like a Hell Hound. The only difference between a Werewolf and a Hell Hound is the Werewolf's eyes do not glow and they can walk on two or four legs. This first Werewolf was just as savage as the Hell Hounds and he killed many people including babies before he was finally killed. A few of the people he had attacked survived and they in turn became Werewolves themselves and spread it to more people. Some of them did have children who were born Werewolves and some of them had children and so on. With each successive generation they seemed to hold onto more of their human minds when they transformed. Now today you can find Werewolves that are the mindless violent type, those that have their human minds while transformed, and those between the two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I'll become a mindless Werewolf?&quot; you asked thinking that it would have been better if you had died.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm hoping this potion will at least let you keep your human mind if you do become a Werewolf,&quot; Mary said. &quot;This potion is just the first part of the treatment. The second part involves you soaking in another potion and then we wait until the first night of the full moon to see if you'll become a Werewolf and if you'll retain your human mind if you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's more than one night of the full moon?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
Mary nodded and said, &quot;You have the night where the moon is at it's fullest and the nights either side of it which constitute the three nights of the full moon. Now drink the potion so we can proceed.&quot;<br />
<br />
You drunk the spicy-sweet potion and almost immediately you felt cramps in your abdomen. You clutched your stomach and asked, &quot;Is this supposed to happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to get to the bathroom before you soil yourself,&quot; Mary said helping you out of bed.<br />
<br />
You just barely sit down on the toilet before your bladder and bowels let go. After a few minutes the cramps went away and Mary told you to wipe your butt with some wet wipes. You thought you were down when she told you that you needed to wipe your slit too which you did. Back in the main room you asked, &quot;Is the second part as bad as the first?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Mary could answer the front door by the bathroom opened and a guy came in saying, &quot;I've got another Gorgon's blood. Maybe this will be the one to restore Lily and Krystal. Oh I see Jade is up. Have you given her the potion yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I have,&quot; Mary said. &quot;Jade, this is my husband Nick and Lily and Krystal are our daughters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to them?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come and see for yourself,&quot; Mary said and went to the back door.<br />
<br />
You followed Mary out back and two statues of girls, one appeared to be about eleven or twelve and the other appeared to be about six or seven. The odd thing was that they were wearing ordinary clothes. &quot;Why are those statues wearing actual clothes?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those statues are Lily and Krystal,&quot; Mary said sadly. &quot;Those are the clothes they were wearing when they met a Gorgon. A Gorgon's gaze changes flesh to stone but not clothes which is why they look like that. Most people believe that once you're turned to stone by a Gorgon you're dead and can't be made flesh again. However I found a book that claims a potion can be made to bring them back to life. One of the ingredients is a Gorgon's blood but it must be from the Gorgon that turned the person to stone. So far the potions I made haven't worked. Maybe the potion never worked but I'm not giving up until I've tried all the potions I can. Now I need to prepare the potion so Nick will help you into your potion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have to strip?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you do,&quot; Mary said going over to a table and began preparing the potion.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I'm a young girl now and he's a guy,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a pediatrician before I came to the park and I've seen boys and girls in various states of nudity including full nudity,&quot; Nick said. &quot;They did extensive tests on me to make sure that I wasn't a pervert. Please trust me that I'm not a pervert and that I won't do anything inappropriate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well alright,&quot; you said trusting Nick for some reason. You stripped and Nick picked you up and set you into a cauldron filled with a silver potion. &quot;This is pretty hot,&quot; you said as you sat down in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's supposed to be,&quot; Mary said stirring potion ingredients together. &quot;It helps to open the pores and allow the potion to seep into your skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked at the potion and asked, &quot;Why is the potion silver? Does it have anything to do with silver killing Werewolves?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Silver doesn't kill a Werewolf anymore than anything else,&quot; Mary said. &quot;A Witch was trying this potion out on a Werewolf but she forgot to give him the first potion. Well he died because of that mistake and a villager had seen it and thought the potion was actual silver. That's how that myth began.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; you said nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure you want to know about the park,&quot; Nick said. &quot;Well the entrances appear at different points in the world at different times. Inside the park the possibility of being transformed is quite high. There's a mall, a carnival, a mansion, an all boys school, an all girls, school, a playground, and others. Each of them has various means to transform you. Also various creatures in the park can transform you too such as the Gorgons and Werewolves. There are lakes and ponds that will transform you usually into a merperson or a fish but they can change you into something else. There are many other things inside the park and many entrances to it. You may step into a restroom at the beach and come out in the park. Now Mary and I are a couple of the caretakers of the park. We keep the park clean and help take care of the transformed people. It can be dangerous at times like when we have to go spray the statues in the Gorgon Garden.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you spray the statues there if it's dangerous?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To keep the statues from eroding and clean,&quot; Nick said. &quot;They were people after all and there may be a way to bring them back. Maybe I'll take you to see them the next time I go to spray the statues. That is if you're not in school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to go to school here even though I was an adult?&quot; you asked shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Mary said filling a spray bottle with the potion she had just finished. &quot;All children in Mystic Park go to school even if they were adults before they came here. Now I'm ready to try this potion on Lily and Krystal. Oh I just realized that we didn't tell you which is which. Lily is thirteen and Krystal is seven. Cross your fingers and hope this one works.&quot; She took a breath and began spraying the potion onto her daughters. You hoped that the potion would bring them back.</p>
