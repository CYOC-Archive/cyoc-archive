<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">NOVEMBER TENTH<br />
JEFF CURRENT AGE - 22 YEARS 6 MONTHS<br />
BRYAN CURRENT AGE - 18 YEARS 0 MONTHS<br />
<br />
After Bryan&#39;s birthday meal, Jeff came home and cracked open his Chronivac. He couldn&#39;t help but notice Bryan wasn&#39;t as jovial as usual. They hadn&#39;t really spoken in days, or even hung out outside of school. Jeff was beginning to worry about his friend. He knew Bryan was incredibly jealous of his growth, and commented on his appearance far more often than anyone else. It was why he convinced him to do Movember. He then used the Chronivac to increase Bryan&#39;s beard density so he would feel better about his own development. Clearly that didn&#39;t work so Jeff felt he should try an alternate path. If Bryan was so eager for a maturity boost, then by god was he going get one.<br />
<br />
Jeff flicked to the Chronivac&#39;s home page and chose Bryan&#39;s profile. He quickly navigated to the age settings and pulled up a familiar page. Although this time around, Jeff thought it wise to be patient and properly fill out the appropriate settings. After a few minutes, Jeff reviewed his proposed changes.<br />
<br />
Name: BRYAN LOMBARD<br />
Current age: 18 YEARS 0 MONTHS<br />
Aging rate: 1 DAY = 1 MONTH<br />
Physical changes: ENHANCED MATURATION<br />
Mental changes: BASIC MATURATION<br />
Participant awareness: 100% AWARE<br />
Public awareness: 0% AWARE (Nobody is aware that the participant is changing, regardless of how impossible it may appear)<br />
OPTIONAL User Awareness: 100% AWARE<br />
Reality change: DISABLED (limited alteration of reality can be achieved manually)<br />
Duration of Proposed Changes: ONGOING (can be manually altered)<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded approvingly, and clicked the accept button. With these settings, Bryan will also age a month every day, and no-one will be any the wiser aside from Bryan himself. Jeff wanted to see how long it would take Bryan to realise something was up. He decided to keep reality changes disabled, wanting Bryan to stay a student for now.<br />
<br />
After finishing with Bryan&#39;s profile, Jeff was curious about his own. He initially rushed through the process, allowing the system to set its own parameters. At the time, he didn&#39;t think much of it. Now, after seeing what he could have set, he felt a little worried. He tapped into his profile and opened the page of ongoing changes. There, he found his altered aging profile. Everything seemed OK until he noticed a timer ticking down. His heart sank a little as he read &#39;Duration of Altered Aging Rate: 365 DAYS. 295 DAYS Remaining&#39;. In his haste to start growing up, he failed to set a proper duration and the Chronivac decided for him... But that was fine, he could just cancel the transformation, right? No harm done...<br />
<br />
ERROR 435! Unable To Cancel Transformation Due To Time Limit Safeguard<br />
ERROR 1013! Unable To Alter Transformation Due To Pre-Existing Parameters<br />
ERRROR 63! Unable To Change User Profile Due To Transformation Currently In Progress<br />
<br />
Jeff swore loudly when he was prevented from making any changes at all. He pulled up the calculator app on his phone. He was currently 22 and a half years old. There were 295 days left until the program stopped. Which meant he would be... 47 years old when it ended. That was older than both of his parents, which wasn&#39;t great... Then again, it was less than fifty, right? Plus, his enhanced physical changes meant he&#39;d stay in good shape. He&#39;d be the hunkiest middle aged daddy in town! He did want to experience some big changes, after all. There was one problem however. How would anyone accept him as a student if he eventually looked as old as the teachers? People were already suspicious of him, especially now he had the porn &#39;stache. Jeff stroked his moustache and looked at the Chronivac. He saw something about manually altering reality. Maybe that was a place to start...<br />
<br />
6 DAYS LATER<br />
JEFF CURRENT AGE - 23 YEARS 0 MONTHS<br />
BRYAN CURRENT AGE- 18 YEARS 6 MONTHS<br />
<br />
Bryan stood in front of his bedroom mirror and applied some beard oil. He still couldn&#39;t believe he had an actual, proper beard growing on his face! Back when he first started this Movember thing, he thought he&#39;d grow nothing of worth, and now his moustache connected to his goatee and he was even having to shave his cheeks on a regular basis. Not only that but he&#39;d noticed his first chest hairs appearing in-between his pecs and around his nipples, along with a thin treasure trail that ran from his belly button to his pubic hair. His lean muscles even looked a bit more defined than usual. Maybe his exercise regime was starting to pay off. Or maybe there was more to the beard oil he got for his birthday than he initially expected...<br />
<br />
Before he could end that train of thought, he heard his mom calling from downstairs. Bryan was running late for school. He grabbed his bag, said goodbye to his moms who made a point of cooing over how their boy was growing up so fast, and dashed to the bus stop just as the school bus pulled up. He joined Shiro and James and shared what they got up to over the weekend.<br />
<br />
It was a typical school day filled with dull classes, flavorless lunch, and lectures about life after high school. The day seemed to fly by and in no time flat, school was done for the day. Bryan said goodbye to his friends and made a beeline for the school gymnasium, where he was to meet with his trainer. He entered the weights room and spotted the man setting up for their session. He was a tall and hirsute man with an impressive body and a gloriously bushy moustache. &quot;Hey, Mr. Cesareo!&quot; Bryan called out, much to the man&#39;s bemusement.<br />
<br />
He frowned and moaned &quot;Ugh, don&#39;t call me that! I&#39;m not a proper teacher yet, I&#39;m not emotionally ready to be called by my last name.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan smirked and joked &quot;I can&#39;t help it Jeff, it&#39;s the power of the moustache!&quot; Jeff was possibly Bryan&#39;s oldest friend, both in age and in length of time knowing each other. Their parents were friends with each other, so they were always together while growing up despite their 5 year age difference. After graduating from college in sport and exercise sciences, Jeff mostly freelanced as a personal trainer. But he desired to teach and struggled to find somewhere to work. After hearing Jeff&#39;s woes, Bryan struck a small deal with him. His uncle was the head coach at school, so he sweet talked him into giving Jeff a part-time job. In return, Jeff provided Bryan with private weightlifting lessons. So for now, Jeff was a teacher-in-training. Something that Bryan loved to tease him about. &quot;So what&#39;s the game plan today, sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff squinted his eyes and growled &quot;We&#39;re doing circuit training wise-guy, and you bet your ass I&#39;m pushing you hard today. Go warm up with some laps round the gym!&quot;<br />
<br />
Two hours later, after a gruelling training session was over, Bryan felt his body crying out for comfort. As they both retired to the changing rooms, he noticed Jeff head to the showers instead. Bryan followed behind, surprised as his friend stripped down and turned on a shower. He&#39;d never known Jeff to be this relaxed with nudity, although they were the only two people in the building. Seeing his naked torso reminded Bryan of those photos he had from Halloween. Why was Jeff at his party again? He couldn&#39;t quite remember. But even then, he never had a chance to see what he was packing. Just as he suspected, his cock was breathtaking. It was a good six inches while still soft and thicker than a salami . The head dangled lower than his walnut-sized balls. Bryan felt lightheaded as he imagined what such a beast would look like fully erect, how it would feel to have it shoved down his throat as he gagged on its girth, or having its entire length slammed straight up his--<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo, you gonna take a shower or just be a peeping tom?&quot; Jeff stood under the shower with his arms crossed. Water trailed down his studly body, plastering his thick body hair to his muscles and streaming down his thick cock. He raised an eyebrow in question.<br />
<br />
Bryan blushed, covered his eyes, and stammered &quot;Ah! Uhm... I was... Uhm...&quot; Before Bryan could answer, he felt a strong grip on his arm and was inadvertently yanked underneath the running shower. He yelled out &quot;Aaahhhhh! What the fuck!&quot; and opened his eyes to see his mustachioed friend grinning from ear to ear.<br />
<br />
Jeff cackled at his friend&#39;s misfortune. &quot;Hah! serves you right! Come on, get out of those wet clothes. You need a proper wash after a workout like that, and I don&#39;t want you stinking up my car!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you&#39;d notice a difference...&quot; Bryan mumbled under his breath as he stripped out of his soaking wet gym clothes. When he reached his jockstrap, he initially hesitated before tucking a hand inside, cupping his cock and balls, and sliding it off with his other hand. <br />
<br />
Now completely naked, Bryan continued to cover himself, but Jeff knocked his hands away. &quot;Nuh-uh, you got to see my dick so I get to see yours. Equality!&quot; Bryan blushed as his half-erect cock bounced from the impact. He knew he couldn&#39;t compare to Jeff&#39;s monster but he felt good when his friend grunted with approval. &quot;You got nothing to hide, bud. You look good, own that confidence!&quot; When he looked up to Bryan&#39;s chest, he grinned and said &quot;Hey, your chest hair&#39;s coming in! It won&#39;t be long until you&#39;re as furry as me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan frowned and said &quot;It&#39;ll take years until I look anything like you do. It&#39;s a little disheartening.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff tutted and gripped his friend&#39;s shoulders. &quot;You can&#39;t keep comparing yourself to me, I&#39;m 5 years older than you! It takes time and effort to get a body like this. And if you stick with me and my training regime, I promise that you&#39;ll be as muscular and hairy and, dare I say, as well endowed as I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan snorted and snarkily said &quot;I don&#39;t know how you&#39;ll achieve that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled that knowing smile of his, like he knew something that Bryan didn&#39;t. &quot;Just trust me on this. Now let&#39;s hurry it up, I promised your moms I&#39;d have you home by five.&quot;</p>
