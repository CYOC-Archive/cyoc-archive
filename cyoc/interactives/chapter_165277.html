<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You tried moving your feet but you couldn’t so you jerked you leg around and you felt something come loose from the bottom of the flower. &quot;H-Huh? W-Wait... nnngh~! I-I think I can....&quot; You muttered, toying with your breasts just to keep yourself from completely going into full on masterbating with vines before you jerked again but with you other legs, and you felt your feet come loose.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m out! Yes!!&quot; You said feeling the lust subside, but not disappear completely. You still had urges to masterbate but not nearly as much as you did before, and you slowly got up and out of the flower using your flexibility to your advantage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew! You... alright birdy? That took a bit,&quot; You said breathing heavily and glancing over at Mike on your shoulder who was staring at your ass, probably was when you were getting up and out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really miss my penis all of a sudden...&quot; Mike muttered which made you blush heavily and shout,&quot;H-Hey, stop staring at me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike spun around and looked at you and protested,&quot;It’s not my fault you’re so voluptuous and busty that you’d knock any man dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed and ran your hands along your ass and breasts and gulped,&quot;Th-They aren’t that big are they...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.... how do I put lightly.....?&quot; Mike paused then chirped,&quot;I’m glad you’re a lot smarter than you look or else I’d call you a bimbo....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What?! Ooooh... shit, how am I going to deal with this? Everything feels weird, these tits weigh a ton, this ass is just ridiculous a-&quot; You were stammering until Mike pecked your shoulder and you shrieked,&quot;Ow hey!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike then moved himself onto one of your breasts and looked you in the eyes. &quot;Hey, get it together, seriously if I had an egg for everytime a man turned woman and complained like you are right now, I would’ve probably found a way to turn back into a man to escape that situation...&quot; Mike chirped then said,&quot;Now I’ll tell you what we’re going to do. We are heading back to my mates and my nest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why would I agree to do that?&quot; You asked crossing your arms cover your breasts that were still leaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what else are you going to do? As I said you shouldn’t trust everything the brotherhood of treeheads as I call them say, so it’s either you follow my word, or you can kiss my tailfeathers and fuck yourself until the tree comes back,&quot; Mike said,&quot;I’m trying to help you, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don’t have to be a dick about it,&quot; You said rolling your eyes and Mike sighed,&quot;I’m a mockingbird, I’m always a dick, and speaking of dicks, if I had one right now I might not be as crabby right now after having to stare at you until you woke up, figuratively not literally of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
You raised a brow then sighed,&quot;You have a point.... but.... keep the comments about my body to a minimum, I’m still having issues with everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I’ll shut up, but that can’t keep me from staring at them and thinking about how much I want my dick back. I haven’t complained about that for months, and now my mates are going to start asking about it,&quot; Mike replied and you sighed,&quot;I guess that’ll be good enough, which way should we go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I’ll fly up from tree to tree, okay? Just follow me,&quot; Mike said before taking off and landing on a tree branch. You sighed once more and shrugged and decided to follow Mike’s lead, no matter how much you wanted to put him in a cage.<br />
<br />
You spent about an hour walking and your feet were sore and felt like they were throbbing from how long you’ve been walking. Your breasts bouncing about and ass jiggling while you walked didn’t help either, and if there was one solace to all of this your nipples stopped dripping with nectar. Still you had to look up and call to Mike,&quot;How much farther is it?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We’re almost there dolly trust me, calm your tits,&quot; Mike chirped before flying to another tree.<br />
<br />
You groaned and facepalmed and kept walking groaning,&quot;That’s what you said like twenty minutes ago... or at least that’s how it feels...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike then suddenly flew down next to a cave and looked at you and said,&quot;Just through here, now if any of my mates asks, and I know at least one who would, you are not a new girlfriend of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Well... obviously! If the last god knows how long has been any indication, I don’t like you very much,&quot; You replied,&quot;Hell you’ve been so focused on my tits and ass you haven’t even asked my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... I apologize for that then, how about you tell me it now, and I can let you live here and call it even?&quot; Mike asked before flying up onto your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex....&quot; You replied then sighed,&quot;It’s a start I suppose. Now.... you said mates plural... how many do you...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Three, two turned recently became birds, one of those two was a dude so...&quot; Mike explained and you paused,&quot;And the third?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pregnant,&quot; Mike replied and you raised a brow,&quot;I cannot see you being a father with that mouth,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah they’re all trying to help me fix that....&quot; Mike replied then sighed,&quot;Just start walking, it’s a tunnel.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sighed and started walking into the cave, seeing a light not too far down. You didn’t talk to nor want to talk to Mike as he perched on your head and stayed there the whole time, it was nice while it lasted. Then you got to the other side and when you walked through Mike announced,&quot;I’m hoooome~&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked around and saw lots of trees, but all around you were cliffs, and there was a large pond in the center. It was like you just walked into a basin, and you actually thought it looked like a nice little private grotto. Then as soon as you came within sight of a tree two birds flew down and landed on a nearby shrub. One of them was a cardinal, and the other was a blue jay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike!! Who the hell is this?!&quot; The blue jay squawked and Mike replied,&quot;H-Hey it’s okay, she’s not a new girlfriend, and certainly not a hooker or whore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gee thanks for the support with my new body,&quot; You sighed rolling your eyes and the blue jay paused,&quot;New body? Wait she’s recently changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, except last night, I’ll explain more after I check on Ash, how is she doing?&quot; Mike asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike she’s really close to laying, she thinks any day now, we were all worried sick when you didn’t come back!&quot; The cardinal chirped,&quot;Where were you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I might’ve saw this person I’m on get changes, said a few things, and ended up having to watch her for the trees and see how she was doing,&quot; Mike replied<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what?&quot; The cardinal asked and you blushed,&quot;P-Please don’t judge me based on how I look now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of the female birds looked at each other then Mike chirped,&quot;Look, I’m going to check up on Ashley, Briana... take it out on me after I’m done, and well.... Andy would you Uh... like to help our new friend here move in? She used to be a man, and just changed last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Staying here?! With us?!&quot; The blue jay screamed<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know, but where else is she supposed to go, she said it herself that she isn’t what she appears to be, take it out on me later okay? I need to see Ash about the eggs,&quot; Mike said before flying off towards a tree. The blue Jay then sighed and followed him then the cardinal paused and looked at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-So uh....&quot; You muttered and the cardinal asked,&quot;You used to be a guy too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah.....&quot; You muttered blushing,&quot;You’re lucky you don’t have to deal with these and a perverted bird breathing down your neck,&quot; You said lifting your tits and sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn.... I hope Mike wasn’t too harsh on you, I’m Andrew, Mike likes calling me Andy,&quot; She chirped before you leaned down and watched her jump onto your shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are you?&quot; Andrew asked and you sighed,&quot;Well... my name is Alex, and as for what.... it’s hard to explain. As much as I don’t want to be called a bimbo it looks like everything my body wants me to do is just that, and masterbate like crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;U-Uh..... maybe you can elaborate a bit to help me understand, and... sorry about Mike,&quot; Andrew replied <br />
<br />
&quot;Why is he always such a dick?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike being Mike? Unless his personality can be explained like you claim your body wants you to be a bimbo, I’d just tune him out. He’s actually really nice, so don’t take anything he says personally,&quot; Andrew said,&quot;I’d say it’s safe to say you have a lot of questions about us, and I have a lot of questions and curiosities about you... so let’s ... mingle I guess...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And hope I don’t start rooting into the ground again and start fucking myself,&quot; You sighed,&quot;Deal,&quot; And so it seems you have made your first actual friend, and the two of you started talking.<br />
<br />
Some time later the blue jay returned and by then....</p>
