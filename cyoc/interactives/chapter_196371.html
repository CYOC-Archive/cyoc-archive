<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><i>‘Gonna play some basketball with a friend, wanna join us?’ -Milo</i><br />
<br />
Dare left the dorms as soon as he got the message and made his way to the campus athletics center with a bounce in his step. He’d been studying all morning and had just gotten a head-start on his next paper, so he had been in a great mood when he got Milo’s message. <i>He actually remembered that I like to play</i>, Dare thought with a big smile on his face, happy for a chance to enjoy himself without worrying about the matter with Curtis and Ollie. <i>Milo’s such a great guy. Way too good for me, let’s be real. Not that I’d ever tell him that...</i><br />
<br />
Dare’s ears perked up at the familiar rhythmic <i>thud</i> of rubber against concrete, and he knew he must be getting close. He turned the corner of the building and spotted Milo’s familiar silhouette in the distance, so he jogged over to the outdoor basketball court and to his favorite boar’s side.<br />
<br />
“Dare, you made it!” Milo said, pulling Dare into a hug and pressing the skunk’s muzzle into the damp fur on his bare chest. Dare nearly passed out from the intensity of the musky scent filling his nostrils, and it took all his focus not to spring a boner right there in front of everyone. He shoved Milo away with a laugh, then he glanced around the court.<br />
<br />
“So, where’s that friend of yours?” Dare asked casually, picking up the basketball from the ground and giving it a dribble. “Yeah, still got it…” he smirked, enjoying the feel of the textured rubber against the pads of his paws.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Keith’s over there with his boyfriend,” Milo replied, pointing to a bench on the sidelines, where the brown bear and his slim squirrel boyfriend were laughing and making out. Dare’s ears flattened against his head as soon as he saw that brown fur, which seemed to trigger a flood of memories.<br />
<br />
In his mind’s eye, he saw two young men; a human and a bear, their faces blurring together until Dare couldn’t even separate them. He focused on the young man’s lips, seeing them grow closer and closer until he could practically feel their soft, warm touch against his.<br />
<br />
<i>A sudden shove against the gym wall, a sharp pain in the back of his head. “What the fuck are you doing, you fucking creep!?” Keith shouts, getting the attention of everyone in the entire gym. “Jesus Christ, have you just been being friendly with me so you could try to fuck me? Is that it, huh!?”</i><br />
<br />
<i>“K-Keith, I-“</i><br />
<br />
<i>“Don’t you fucking say another word, asshole! Get the fuck away from me!”</i><br />
<br />
Dare snapped back to the present and saw the bear strutting over to him and Milo, and their eyes locked. An odd look crossed the tall bear’s face, a look Dare had seen on many of his fellow students’ faces whenever their old and new lives clashed, when their memories fought for dominance.<br />
<br />
“…Daryl? What the fuck are you doing here?” Keith whispered in shock, his arms falling slack at his side.<br />
<br />
Dare was already moving before the words had left Keith’s mouth, his fist raised and flying though the air.<br />
<br />
“Not in his face, please!! Anywhere but there, okay!?” Terry shouted from the sidelines, and luckily for him Dare was aiming right for the center of Keith’s chest, knocking the wind out of the bear’s lungs and sending him crashing down to the ground.<br />
<br />
“You fucker!! Don’t you fucking call me that!!” Dare screeched, winding up for another swing. “Daryl’s the name of the guy whose life you fucking ruined, remember!? You remember how you made high school a living hell for me!? Asshole!”<br />
<br />
Dare began to swing his fist, but Milo caught his arm from behind and stopped the punch dead in its tracks.<br />
<br />
“Pig, you let go of me right now!” Dare snarled, his eyes still furiously locked on Keith.<br />
<br />
“Dare, you need to calm down. This isn’t-“<br />
<br />
“Nah, don’t worry about it, Milo,” Keith said quietly as he stood up. “I deserve it, probably at least a few more of them, too.”<br />
<br />
Keith cautiously approached Dare with his arms raised above his head, ready to accept whatever Dare had in store for him.<br />
<br />
“I always wanted to say I was sorry, Daryl… Or, I guess it’s ‘Dare’, huh?” Keith said slowly, avoiding Dare’s glare in shame. “I’ve always regretted what I did to you, but by the time I realized how big a mistake I made, you’d already gotten kicked out of school. I even tried to get in contact with your parents, but they weren’t much help… So, I applied to this college, and when I got a chance to forget about everything that happened before, I took it. That was cowardly of me, I know, and now I want you to give me what I deserve…”<br />
<br />
Milo let go of Dare’s fist, not believing what he was hearing. Keith, the friendly guy that had been helping him in the gym for the past few days, was the same guy that had turned Dare into the neurotic wreck he was today? Coincidences were one thing, but this was on a whole different level.<br />
<br />
Dare kept his fist clenched, pressing his claws so hard into his palms that they drew blood. With a furious snarl, Dare spun around on his heel and stomped out of the gym, leaving Milo, Keith, and Terry staring after him in silence.<br />
<br />
After a couple moments, Terry spun around and slapped Milo across the back of the head with his big, fluffy tail, shaking Milo out of his daze. “What the fuck are you doing standing there, you idiot? Go after him!” Terry growled in disbelief. “God, I can’t fucking stand freshmen… Buncha hormonal nightmares, I tell you…”<br />
<br />
Nodding shakily, Milo slowly began to walk toward the exit, picking up the pace with each step until he was full-on running to catch up with Dare…<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“Are you going to forgive him?” Milo asked quietly once the two of them got back to their dorm. Milo began to strip out of the sweaty athletic shorts he had been wearing, and the pair of sweat-soaked boxers clinging to the boar’s body filled the entire room with Milo’s powerful, masculine muskiness.<br />
<br />
“…Why? To make him feel better about what happened?” Dare muttered, sitting on the bed and crossing his legs to cover up his tented jeans. Milo’s scent always had such a strong effect on the skunk, and the humid scent wafting around the room made it even harder for Dare to think straight. “It was years ago anyway. It doesn’t matter anymore…”<br />
<br />
“Dare, you don’t believe that. It still hurts you, and smacking Keith might have felt good, but I doubt it actually made things better,” Milo sighed, slumping down next to Dare on the bed and pulling his skunk into a hug. “Keith’s still my friend, and I think he really does feel terrible about how things turned out. He felt bad enough that he wanted to leave his old life behind just to forget about it… And he hurt you bad enough that <i>you</i> might want to do the same thing.”<br />
<br />
Milo stopped when he heard a quiet sniffling and short, gasping breaths coming from next to him. He looked over and saw huge streaks of tears dampening the fur around Dare’s eyes, which the skunk desperately tried to hide by covering his face with his paw.<br />
<br />
“Fuck… Fuck!” Dare finally managed to cry out, his voice equally furious and pitiful. “I… Fuck, I wondered for years what I’d do if I ever met that asshole again. Y’know, I even thought I’d try to kiss him again, just to see if he’d like me back if I gave him another chance… Once, I thought I’d just tell everyone who knew him what a fucking monster he was, just so he’d know what it’s like for everyone he knew to hate him… B-but, then I actually get the chance, and… and I… Fuck!”<br />
<br />
Milo didn’t want to say anything, he just let Dare vent and rant. The situation between Dare and Keith was so complicated and fraught with emotions that trying to intervene would just make things worse. But Milo did know one thing; no matter what happened, he didn’t want his skunk to be in any more pain.<br />
<br />
“Dare… Forget about Keith for a moment, okay? I just…” Milo said quietly, biting his lip and wondering if he should say this. “…Dare, I love you. Maybe I’m an idiot for loving you. The others probably think so, but I can’t help it. You’re smart, you’re funny, and you smell like a fucking bakery and I don’t even know how that’s possible, but it is. So, no matter what happens, I won’t let anyone ever hurt you again. Not Keith or anyone else.”<br />
<br />
Dare’s sniffling stopped and he pulled his paw away from his face to reveal his big green eyes, still glistening with tears. “…T-thanks, pig. I mean, <i>Milo</i>,” Dare said with a quiet laugh, resting his head against Milo’s shoulder. “And I really l-… I like you too…”<br />
<br />
Dare looked up at Milo, marveling at how much taller and stronger he had gotten in just over a week. Or maybe Dare had gotten smaller? It didn’t matter, since Dare knew that Milo loved him. His boar loved the skunk that Dare had become. With a shy grin, Dare pressed his muzzle against Milo’s snout, tenderly kissing the big boar all over his fuzzy face. Milo responded by reaching out and gently brushing one hand across Dare’s chest, inching closer and closer to the little green piercing that he knew would drive his skunk wild.<br />
<br />
Dare’s paw shot out and grabbed Milo by the wrist, holding the boar back for a moment. “If you touch me there, you know what we’ll have to do, right?” Dare muttered with a sly wink, wiping his eyes with his free paw before beginning to unbutton his jeans.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I do.”<br />
<br />
Milo pushed back against Dare, pressing him against the bed and giving the skunk’s pierced nipple a firm tweak. Dare arched his back and groaned in arousal, thrusting his hips into the air and nearly cumming right there from the intense stimulation. In an instant, both Milo and Dare had stripped off their remaining clothes and tossed them aside while the room filled with the intense scent of their combined musk. Dare knew the whole floor (hell, probably the whole building) would be able to smell what they were about to do, and he didn’t care. He rested his chin on a pillow and lifted his furry ass up into the air, giving it a sexy wiggle to entice Milo to keep on going.<br />
<br />
Milo took the bait without even a second of thought, lining up his cock with Dare’s ass and slowly rubbed it back and forth along the small of the skunk’s back. “Feel that, skunk?” Milo growled, a wave of confidence surging through him as he teased Dare. “I’m gonna make you memorize the feel of every fucking inch. I’m going to pump you so full that you’re gonna taste it.”<br />
<br />
Dare smirked and nearly burst into laughter at Milo’s attempts at dirty talking, but as much as he didn’t want to admit it Milo’s words were having a real effect on him. He could feel Milo’s dick growing harder and drooling all over the fur on his back, twisting and curling into its fully-erect spiral. “Ooh, go for it, pig~” Dare teased. “Or are you all talk?”<br />
<br />
Milo was <i>not</i> all talk. With a loud snort, he pressed the tip of his curly dick against Dare’s pucker and let out a growl of pleasure as it slipped inside with barely any effort. Inch by inch, Milo watched as his spiraling erection <i>screwed</i> itself into Dare, and Dare let out a series of animalistic yelps every time he felt another coil of the boar’s cock slipped inside him. Once the entire thing was stuffed up Dare’s backside, Milo and Dare both let out simultaneous sighs of relief, while Dare glanced back and said, “Don’t you dare stop there, pig. You haven’t even gotten started yet…”<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Milo began to jerk his hips back and forth, feeling his dick expanding even more inside his partner and drooling a stead stream of precum into Dare’s insides. Dare could feel every coil of Milo’s spiral-shaped cock rubbing against him, pressing against every sensitive spot and making his eyes roll back in pure pleasure. Milo seized his chance and reached around to grab Dare&#39;s erect nipples, teasing and tweaking them mercilessly and evoking another round of desperate moans from the smaller skunk as his cock throbbed harder and slapped against his belly. Little spurts of precum stained the sheets under Dare, getting the fur on his chest slick and sticky as it combined with his and Milo’s sweat, adding to the hot and humid environment of the dorm room.<br />
<br />
With one final hard thrust, Milo buried himself to the hilt inside Dare, slapping his massive balls against Dare’s thighs and letting out a loud, porcine snort. Dare thought he knew what to expect after experiencing Milo’s incredible load before, but having that volcano of boar cum go off inside his body was something else entirely. Thick, stick, hot ropes of cum coated every inch of the skunk’s insides, with Milo shuddering and pumping in and out of Dare’s stretched-out asshole for a full minutes before finally pulling out and shooting off one final squirt against the back of Dare’s neck.<br />
<br />
“Jesus christ… That was amazing…” Milo panted, looking down and seeing a river of his cum spilling out from Dare’s gaping ass. “W-was that okay, Dare? It was my first time, so… Hey, Dare? You okay?”<br />
<br />
Dare was shaking and panting as he helplessly painted the bed with his cum, emptying his balls onto the bedsheets before finally collapsing in exhaustion.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I think I did pretty good…” Milo chuckled, relaxing a bit and giving Dare’s ass a light smack. “And if that’s our first time, it’s only gonna get better from here.”<br />
<br />
Dare let out a quiet moan in response, and Milo saw something began to twitch under the fur at the base of Dare’s back. Milo raised an eyebrow before curiously getting closer to get a better look…<br />
<br />
<i>Fwoomph!</i><br />
<br />
As soon as Milo got close, a truly massive, fluffy, black-and-white furred tail exploded out of Dare’s backside, nailing Milo in the face and sending him stumbling backward across the room. “Oww… Fuck!” Milo groaned, rubbing the back of his head and pulling himself up from the ground. He started at the huge tail currently pointed straight up in the air and waving back and forth. Despite having just nearly knocked him out, Milo couldn’t help but admire the enormous appendage attached to his roommate’s back. It was coated in some of the softest, most beautiful fur that Milo had ever seen in his time at Claw Valley, and had to be nearly four feet long when fully uncurled.<br />
<br />
“…Fuck, I wanna brush that thing so bad,” Milo gasped as he ran his hand though the thick fur in amazement. Dare was still completely conked out from the intensity of their sex, which Milo took as permission to rub his entire face into the thick black-and-white fur and inhaling deeply. “Oh, thank god… It still smells as amazing as the rest of him. I was a little worried there for a second…”<br />
<br />
While Milo enjoyed his new toy and Dare slept off his exhaustion, the rest of the floor tried to ignore the sounds and scents that had been emanating from room 315 over the past half-hour. At long last, it was time for the Floor 3 betting pool of “When are Dare and Milo finally going to fuck?” to pay off. <br />
<br />
Naturally, Max made out like a bandit, and was already planning a lavish date with Stripes using the proceeds.</p>
