<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John took a deep breath. &quot;Let&#39;s start with length, I guess. Just make it, say, double the size.&quot;<br />
Paul nodded and closed his eyes, his fingers twitching slightly. John felt a strange warmth and tingling sensation spread through his groin, and before he knew it, his penis began to stretch and swell. He watched, half in amazement and half in horror, as his three-inch member grew to a solid six inches in length.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit,&quot; he murmured, his hand reaching out to touch his now-substantial cock. It was definitely his, but... different. The sensation was oddly arousing, and John had to fight the urge to get hard.<br />
<br />
Paul&#39;s eyes remained closed, a look of intense concentration on his face. &quot;You want it to be wider too?&quot; he asked, his voice tight with anticipation.<br />
John nodded, still in disbelief. &quot;Yeah, go for it.&quot;<br />
The warmth grew stronger, and John watched as his cock thickened, the skin stretching until it was six inches in circumference. He couldn&#39;t help but let out a low groan as the sensation grew more intense. It was like nothing he had ever felt before, and he was both intrigued and slightly scared.<br />
<br />
Finally, Paul opened his eyes and took a step back, his cheeks flushed with excitement. &quot;How&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
John stared down at his crotch, his mind racing. He had seen a lot of things in his life, but nothing quite like this. &quot;It&#39;s... it&#39;s incredible,&quot; he managed to say, his voice thick with wonder.<br />
Paul&#39;s face broke into a wide grin. &quot;I told you it was a good power!&quot;<br />
<br />
John had to admit, it was certainly an impressive ability, but he couldn&#39;t help but feel a little uncomfortable. &quot;Okay, okay. That&#39;s enough,&quot; he said, waving his hand. &quot;You can put it back now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul looked confused. &quot;Put it back? I can&#39;t do that,&quot; he said. &quot;My power only goes one way.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; John&#39;s voice was tinged with panic.<br />
&quot;Once I&#39;ve made the changes, they&#39;re permanent,&quot; Paul explained, his tone matter-of-fact. &quot;It&#39;s like I&#39;m unlocking their full potential. I can&#39;t take it away.&quot;<br />
John&#39;s jaw dropped. &quot;Are you serious?&quot;<br />
Paul nodded solemnly. &quot;Yeah, man. That&#39;s the deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
John felt his heart racing as he looked down at his now-hung cock. He had been expecting some kind of reversible demonstration, not a full-blown transformation. &quot;But... but why would anyone want that?!&quot;<br />
Paul shrugged. &quot;Some guys are into it. And like I said, it&#39;s all about confidence, right?&quot;<br />
John sighed heavily, trying to wrap his head around the situation. &quot;Alright, alright,&quot; he said, taking a deep breath to calm himself down. &quot;We&#39;ll... we&#39;ll deal with that later.&quot;<br />
<br />
He quickly pulled his pants back up, the extra bulk feeling strange and unfamiliar. He sat back down at the table, his mind racing. &quot;So, let&#39;s say I do take you on,&quot; he began, trying to focus on the task at hand, &quot;How do you propose we use this power for the greater good?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul leaned back in his chair, a smug look on his face. &quot;Well, think about it,&quot; he said, &quot;It&#39;s not just about the size. Imagine the boost in confidence it would give to someone who&#39;s been bullied or struggling with self-esteem issues. And, you know, it could be useful for, uh, certain missions that require a... a bit of extra persuasion.&quot;<br />
John raised an eyebrow at that, not entirely convinced. &quot;I don&#39;t know, Paul. It&#39;s definitely a unique power, but I&#39;m not sure how we&#39;d explain that to the community.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, John,&quot; Paul protested, &quot;You can&#39;t say you&#39;re not at least a little bit curious about the possibilities. And think of the good we could do!&quot;<br />
John leaned back, stroking his chin thoughtfully. The potential was certainly intriguing, but the potential for misuse was equally concerning. &quot;Okay, let&#39;s say we find a way to justify it. What&#39;s your background? Have you used your power for anything other than personal gain?&quot;<br />
Paul&#39;s smile faltered a bit, his eyes dropping to the floor. &quot;Well, no,&quot; he admitted, &quot;But that&#39;s only because no one&#39;s ever given me a chance to do anything more than, you know, party tricks.&quot;<br />
<br />
John nodded slowly. &quot;I get it,&quot; he said, his voice softer. &quot;Look, I&#39;ll think about it. But I need to see how this works in a more controlled environment, understand its limitations.&quot;<br />
Paul perked up at this. &quot;You mean you&#39;re considering it?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m considering all options,&quot; John replied, his mind already racing with potential scenarios where such an ability could come in handy. &quot;But we&#39;re a long way from deciding anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
They talked for a bit longer, John asking more questions about the extent of Paul&#39;s power, the range of changes he could make, and any potential side effects. Paul was eager to prove himself, rattling off answers and examples with the enthusiasm of someone who hadn&#39;t been taken seriously before.<br />
<br />
John scribbled notes on a clipboard, his brow furrowed in thought. &quot;Alright, so let&#39;s talk side effects,&quot; he said, looking up at Paul. &quot;You said it&#39;s permanent. Are there any other, uh, consequences to your &#39;adjustments&#39;?&quot;<br />
Paul nodded, his expression turning more serious. &quot;Well, there can be some, yeah. Sometimes the changes can be a little... unpredictable.&quot;<br />
John&#39;s stomach churned. &quot;Unpredictable how?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sensitivity can increase, which can be a good or a bad thing,&quot; Paul began, &quot;And sometimes the growth can cause discomfort if it&#39;s too much, too quickly.&quot;<br />
John felt his cock throb in his pants and winced. &quot;Too much, too quickly,&quot; he murmured, suddenly very aware of the weight of his decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there&#39;s the issue of, uh, proportionality,&quot; Paul continued. &quot;If I go too big too fast, it might not look, you know, natural.&quot;<br />
John nodded, his mind racing with images of men stumbling around with comically oversized genitals. &quot;So, you have to be careful with the sizing.&quot;<br />
Paul nodded again. &quot;Exactly. It&#39;s all about finding the sweet spot, making sure the changes fit the person&#39;s body type and desired outcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
John leaned back in his chair, his gaze drifting to the ceiling as he considered the implications. &quot;So, out of curiosity, what&#39;s the biggest you&#39;ve ever made someone?&quot; he asked, trying to keep his voice steady.<br />
Paul leaned back too, his eyes going distant as he thought. &quot;Well, there was this one guy,&quot; he began, &quot;He was really insecure about his size, so I went all out. I got him up to... eleven inches, I think. He was pretty happy with the results.&quot;<br />
John&#39;s eyes nearly popped out of his head. &quot;Eleven inches?&quot;<br />
Paul shrugged, a smirk playing at the corner of his mouth. &quot;Yeah, it was a bit much, but he was happy. I had to be careful, though. It&#39;s not like you can just make someone&#39;s dick eleven inches long without some serious side effects.&quot;<br />
John felt his cheeks heat up at the thought, his own recent &#39;adjustment&#39; feeling rather trivial in comparison. &quot;Jesus, what kind of side effects are we talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, walking can get a bit awkward,&quot; Paul said with a chuckle, &quot;And it can mess with their self-image, you know? Some guys get too cocky, start thinking they&#39;re all that just because they&#39;re packing heat.&quot;<br />
John nodded, his mind racing. &quot;I can see how that could be a problem,&quot; he said, his voice trailing off as he considered the potential for his team. &quot;But let&#39;s say we find the right balance, how do you manage the, uh, practicality of it? The size, I mean. Surely it&#39;s got to be a problem for clothes and, uh, other things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul nodded thoughtfully. &quot;I&#39;ve got a few tricks up my sleeve for that. I can make it so that it&#39;s only when they&#39;re, you know, excited that they get that big. The rest of the time, they&#39;re a more manageable size.&quot;<br />
John felt a slight pang of relief at that. &quot;That&#39;s... actually quite clever,&quot; he said. &quot;What about, uh, performance?&quot;<br />
Paul grinned. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about that. I can adjust for girth and length, sure, but I can also tweak the sensitivity and stamina. It&#39;s all in the wiring, really.&quot;<br />
<br />
John leaned forward, his curiosity piqued. &quot;Are you saying that you can make some one bigger when they&#39;re hard, but not change their soft size?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul nodded confidently. &quot;Exactly. It&#39;s all about potential. Like, right now, your cock is, what, three inches? But when it&#39;s erect, it&#39;s double that.&quot;<br />
John felt a blush creeping up his neck. &quot;Well, it&#39;s usually more like four, but yeah, you get the idea.&quot;<br />
Paul grinned. &quot;So, if you wanted to, say, keep your day-to-day size the same, but become a real beast when it counts...&quot;<br />
<br />
Without waiting for a response, Paul leaned forward and placed his hands on the table, focusing intently on John&#39;s crotch. The warmth and tingling sensation returned, more intense than before. Unlike the last time Paul used his powers on John, John&#39;s penis seemingly remained unchanged staying at its soft size of 6 x 6 inches<br />
<br />
&quot;Paul, what are you doing?&quot; John asked, somewhat confused.<br />
<br />
Paul looked up, a glint of excitement in his eyes. &quot;I&#39;m just making sure that your new size is, well, functional. You know, so it doesn&#39;t get in the way when you&#39;re not using it for... community service.&quot;<br />
<br />
John felt his face flush. &quot;I appreciate the consideration,&quot; he said dryly. &quot;But I&#39;m not exactly planning on flaunting it around the office.&quot;<br />
Paul chuckled. &quot;Fair enough. But you never know when you might need to... whip it out, so to speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
John&#39;s mind raced as he watched Paul&#39;s hands hovering over his crotch. He had never been one for flashy powers, preferring the subtlety of his own telekinesis. But as the sensation grew stronger, his skepticism began to wane. &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; he said, his voice strained. &quot;I think I&#39;ve had enough for one night. You can stop now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul opened his eyes and leaned back, his hands retreating from John&#39;s pants. &quot;It&#39;s all done,&quot; he said with a satisfied smile. &quot;But remember, it&#39;s only when you get hard that you&#39;ll really see the difference.&quot;<br />
John felt a twinge of disbelief. &quot;Wait, what? You didn&#39;t just change me again, did you?&quot;<br />
Paul&#39;s grin grew wider. &quot;No, no, I just made sure it&#39;s all set for when you need it to be. Trust me, it&#39;s gonna be a game-changer.&quot;<br />
John stood up, his hand reflexively reaching for his crotch. His soft penis felt the same size as before, and he couldn&#39;t help but feel a little disappointed. &quot;But it&#39;s still the same size,&quot; he said, his voice betraying his confusion.<br />
<br />
Paul winked. &quot;Like I said, it&#39;s all about potential. When you&#39;re ready to, you know, rise to the occasion, you&#39;ll see.&quot;<br />
John felt a bead of sweat trickle down his forehead, his mind racing. &quot;But why would you do that without asking?&quot;<br />
Paul shrugged. &quot;I figured you&#39;d want to be prepared. And it&#39;s not like you can&#39;t handle it. Besides, think of it as a little... bonus for giving me a shot at the team.&quot;<br />
<br />
John sighed, trying to process the new information. &quot;Okay, okay,&quot; he said, his voice shaky. &quot;But we need to be clear about this. We&#39;re using our powers to help people, not to... give them pornstar dicks.&quot;<br />
Paul held up his hands in a gesture of innocence. &quot;Hey, I&#39;m just saying, if it happens to make someone happy along the way, it&#39;s not a crime.&quot;<br />
John rolled his eyes, trying to ignore the growing sense of unease in his stomach. &quot;Fine. But let&#39;s keep it professional, okay?&quot;<br />
Paul grinned. &quot;You got it, boss.&quot;<br />
<br />
John took a deep breath, trying to refocus on the task at hand. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s get down to brass tacks,&quot; he said, his voice firm. &quot;If we&#39;re going to use your power for the team, I need to know that it&#39;s reliable and controllable. No more surprises, got it?&quot;<br />
Paul nodded. &quot;I get it. And I&#39;m sorry about before. I just wanted to show you what I can do.&quot;<br />
John nodded, his expression still stern. &quot;I appreciate that, but from now on, we need to communicate better. No more playing fast and loose with my... equipment.&quot;<br />
Paul nodded more earnestly. &quot;Understood. I&#39;ll be more careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
John took a moment to compose himself, then leaned back in his chair. &quot;So, tell me again,&quot; he said, &quot;What exactly did you do to my penis?&quot;<br />
Paul&#39;s eyes lit up with excitement. &quot;Well, I set it so that when you&#39;re aroused, it&#39;ll grow to eleven inches in length. And I made sure it&#39;ll always get rock hard, like 110%, no matter what.&quot;<br />
John felt his cock twitch in his pants at the thought. &quot;Fuck, eleven inches,&quot; he murmured, his mind racing.<br />
<br />
&quot;But here&#39;s the kicker,&quot; Paul said, leaning in closer, &quot;You won&#39;t have to worry about the size unless you&#39;re ready for action. It&#39;s all about the mindset. So, no awkward moments in the office or anything.&quot;<br />
John couldn&#39;t help but feel a mix of apprehension and fascination. &quot;And what if I don&#39;t want it to get that big?&quot;<br />
&quot;I made sure you won&#39;t have any issues getting that big, every time. Plus, my powers are permanent, remember, so you&#39;ll always be sporting huge hard meat.&quot; Paul said.<br />
<br />
John shifted uncomfortably in his chair, his mind racing with the implications of an 11-inch erection. &quot;What if it gets in the way of my work?&quot;<br />
Paul chuckled. &quot;Well, it&#39;s not like you&#39;re going to be fighting crime with your dick out, right?&quot;<br />
John&#39;s frustration grew, his voice tight. &quot;You&#39;re not listening. I can&#39;t just ignore it when it&#39;s that big!&quot;<br />
Paul held up his hands. &quot;Okay, okay, I get it. But think of it as an asset, not a liability.&quot;<br />
<br />
John rubbed his eyes, feeling overwhelmed. &quot;Look, I need some time to think this over,&quot; he said, his voice firm. &quot;You should go home, and we&#39;ll discuss this again when I&#39;ve had a chance to consider everything.&quot;<br />
Paul looked crestfallen. &quot;But what about the demonstration?&quot;<br />
John&#39;s jaw clenched. &quot;It&#39;s more than enough for now,&quot; he said, his tone leaving no room for argument. &quot;We&#39;ll be in touch.&quot;<br />
Paul nodded slowly, understanding the unspoken message. He stood up, looking slightly defeated. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll go. But you&#39;re not going to find anyone else with a power like mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
John watched him leave, the sound of the garage door closing echoing through the space. He leaned back in his chair, his mind racing with thoughts. The potential for misuse was alarmingly high, but the idea of using Paul&#39;s power to boost the confidence of those in need was undeniably appealing. He knew that if he was going to move forward with this, he had to set strict boundaries and guidelines.<br />
<br />
Finally, unable to resist, he unzipped his pants and pulled out his now-impressive cock. It lay there, thick and heavy, the head a deep shade of pink that contrasted with his pale skin. The sheer size was intimidating, and John found himself both repulsed and intrigued. He gave it a tentative squeeze, the new girth surprising him. It felt... powerful. He couldn&#39;t help but wonder what it would be like to be with someone and have them look at him with a mix of awe and desire.</p>
