<br />
“Right then,” you heard a muffled male voice say from just outside the truck, “let’s have a look at our new stock…”<br />
<br />
With that, the truck’s automated rear ramp slowly started to lower; blinding you briefly as bright light flooded in from outside. You could feel your heart beginning to race, though you tried to remain focused on the task at hand rather than letting yourself feel afraid. You were determined to get yourself, Jessica and your family out of here on two legs; and you didn’t know how far you would go in order to achieve this.<br />
<br />
You continued to think about this until the ramp finally finished lowering and a couple of burly men noisily stomped their way inside. You then couldn’t help letting out a deep growl when the men started to roughly handle Jessica’s cage. You and the bald eagle managed to briefly meet each other’s gaze, and this caused you to settle down when you sensed that your girlfriend was just as determined to succeed as you were.<br />
<br />
“Hmmmm… yes, a very nice specimen,” you heard the same male voice say from outside, “I’m sure she will lay many fine clutches of eggs once she gets used to her new surroundings.” You guessed that this voice belonged to Mr Hamilton, the sadistic manager of the North American Trail exhibit who Nat had pre-briefed you about. This man was your main target. This bastard was the one who had kidnapped your hostage.<br />
<br />
“Oh I agree,” you heard Nat say back to Hamilton in a friendly tone, “she has the makings of a fine mother, once she is in the right mood that is. Perhaps leaving her alone for a few days to let the curse fester will help ‘loosen her up’ so to speak?”<br />
<br />
“Not a bad suggestion,” Hamilton replied. “How did you say you acquired these two again?”<br />
<br />
“They were both caught breaking into one of our subsidiary businesses, a place called Manor Farm” Nat flatly lied. “Personally I wanted a couple of nice healthy heifers out of them, but I understand that the North American Trail is so popular these days that you always need more animals to satisfy the growing demand.”<br />
<br />
“Well you’re not wrong,” Hamilton said proudly, “business is booming and our turnover of guests is one of the highest in the Zoo. We have also made sure to tighten up our security and procedures, especially following that fiasco over at the Stables.”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made a chill creep up your spine as your confidence started to falter. You were now starting to wish you hadn’t agreed to this suicide mission, but sadly you knew it was far too late to turn back now.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I heard about that,” Nat said in pretend curiosity, “I also heard that a couple of livestock managed to escape. Do you think we should be worried?”<br />
<br />
“No I don’t think so,” Hamilton confidently replied, “a handful of daring individuals have managed to escape the Zoo before, but they tend to either find their way back to us or to disappear completely without a trace. As for our most recent escapees, I’m sure they’ll soon return, now that we have both of their families safely behind bars.”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made your head spin in both hatred and dread when you realised that Nat and Hamilton were talking about you and Jessica. You wished you could just rush in and save your loved ones right now, but you knew that you would have to be patient and wait for the best opportunity to strike.<br />
<br />
“Anyway, enough gossip,” Hamilton finally announced, “let’s get our new cougar settled into his new home.”<br />
<br />
With that, the two burly men that had removed Jessica now moved towards your cage at the back of the truck. You tried to remain calm as they loomed large over your new feline body. You looked up, only to see that one was pointing a tranquilliser gun at you while the other started to unlock the bolt and lock of your cage.<br />
<br />
“Try anything and you’ll wish you’d never been born,” the guy with the gun said as he kept it trained on your crouched form, “now be a good little pussycat and run along. You belong to us now, so you’d better get used to doing as you’re told.”<br />
<br />
Listening to this made you want to pounce up and murder both of these bastards with your razor-sharp claws and massive crushing jaws. However, you knew that such an attempt would only end badly, with you likely spending the rest of your life in the cougar exhibit; if not something worse…<br />
<br />
With this in mind, you obediently followed the two men out of your cage and down the ramp towards where Nat and Hamilton were standing. It was now getting late in the evening with the sun starting to set. You knew you just had to survive the night, after which Nat’s plan would finally spring into action.<br />
<br />
“Ah, magnificent,” Hamilton said as he turned to admire your new cougar body, “another healthy young male for the breeding programme. I suppose I’d better give you some time to settle in like your eagle friend over here, but come the morning I want to see you putting some of our new females through their paces!”<br />
<br />
Hearing this made you feel sick as you tried not to think about cougaresses or breeding programmes. Thankfully, Nat’s promise that your mind would remain intact seemed to be holding true for now, given that you currently couldn’t think of anything more disgusting than fucking some dirty animal; especially one which used to be human!<br />
<br />
“I’m sure he will do a fine job,” Nat replied to Mr Hamilton as she subtly winked at you, “especially in such capable hands as yours. Now though I had better leave you to it, thanks again for taking them off my hands.”<br />
<br />
“Oh it’ll be my pleasure,” Hamilton said in a slightly sinister tone as Nat climbed back into the truck, “soon we will have broken them like all the others. Give it a month or so and they will accept what they now are; just a pair of mindless beasts completely under our control.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds promising,” Nat said in pretend agreement, “just give them a chance to settle in and I’m sure they’ll both serve you well. Anyway, I’d best be off. Hopefully see you and your new pets soon.”<br />
<br />
With that, Nat fired up the truck’s engine and pulled away; leaving you and Jessica alone with Mr Hamilton and his thugs.<br />
<br />
“Right then you two,” Hamilton said with a sinister smile, “let’s get you settled into your new home…”</p>
