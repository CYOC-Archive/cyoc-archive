<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, he&#39;s a dick, so if I probably hopped the fence he wouldn&#39;t hesitate to call the police.&quot; She muttered to herself. Hana began to think back through her various, conflicting memories. It took her a bit, but eventually recalled that she had never met this guy, only when she was Henry had they actually interacted.<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t even remember his name.&quot; She realized with her hand held in dismay against her forehead. &quot;But I know he deserves whatever comes to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hana checked her pant suit to make sure that former cop hadn&#39;t dropped anything on her and then made sure her dark hair was looking neat and respectable. She cleared her throat, and began to think of the best excuse to get inside as she pressed on the call box.<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; A hoarse grunt rose from the speaker. Hana, or rather Henry somewhere within Hana, managed to immediately recognize it as him. She smiled, but composed herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, hello, this is Hana Abed from the... Union, and I&#39;d like to ask a few questions if I may&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap... listen lady I don&#39;t have to do jack!&quot; He retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh quite right sir, you don&#39;t. Though, I can&#39;t say your side of the story will be at all represented if anything does arise with the property managers.&quot; She bluffed, hoping that his workers would&#39;ve already had some compliant with him.<br />
<br />
He was silent for a few moments, and Hana began to wonder if she should try to just sneak in when a buzz sounded and the gate opened.<br />
&quot;Bingo.&quot; She whispered as she strut confidently up to the front door. It swung open quite aggressively to reveal an older, chubby man. He was wearing a wifebeater shit and crappy sweatpants, his blonde hair was thinning, and he clearly hadn&#39;t shaved recently. He scowled at Hana, scoffed and gestured for her to go inside.<br />
<br />
As Hana walked in, she took note of everything around her. It wasn&#39;t exactly a rich man&#39;s house, but it was still a nice place. Large furniture, a full kitchen, and even a cat which stalled by Hana as she glanced around. Hana could feel anger boiling up, mostly from the memories of Henry. She remembered those cold winter nights, and how this man could have clearly helped her out but chose not to do so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pfft, what&#39;s with the chunky camera?&quot; He asked rudely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, just potential documentation.&quot; She replied, while petting the cat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, you&#39;re not taking pictures of valuables to rob me later are you?&quot; He joked.<br />
<br />
Hana froze. Now this was something she felt more close to. The amount of racial prejudice she experienced in her life was unmatched, and even if he had meant it as a joke it still stung. She turned around and forced a smile. <br />
&quot;No sir, of course not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Had a couple darker guys try to do that back in the day.&quot; He said as he shook his head and prepared coffee. &quot;They were unhappy with a perfectly fine residence or something. I don&#39;t know it&#39;s been a while. Look if this is about that then you can take it up with the police and tell them Kyle Reid had nothing to do with that bull.&quot;<br />
<br />
Internally, she snapped. This guy was about to get what was coming to him. The cat hopped up on the counter and Hana seized her chance.<br />
&quot;Hey, say cheese!&quot; She laughed, quickly taking a photo. <br />
<br />
Kyle barely had time to yell before he and the cat warped. The house around her suddenly shifted too, as everything inside became a little different, mostly in style and color. She turned back to see that no one was in the kitchen. She began to wonder if she had accidentally made someone inanimate again when a sudden voice from behind spooked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I&#39;m sorry ma&#39;m, I didn&#39;t see you there, are you here for the open house?&quot; A quiet mousy voice arose behind her. <br />
<br />
Hana was greeted by an adorable young lady in a tight dress skirt and blue blouse. She was a little younger than Hana, and was African American. She had a curly, dark afro, beautiful brown eyes, and an adorable smile. She had moderately sized breasts but crazy wide hips and quite the ass. Hana was starting to get a little wet but shook herself out of it and focused back on the young ladies&#39; face.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when she realized who this new person was. She would&#39;ve preferred a more cruel punishment, but this could work.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry it&#39;s not problem... ms?&quot; Hana asked, extending her and to shake hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jackson, Kylie Jackson.&quot; She laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cute name Kylie.&quot; Hana beamed, extremely proud at her change.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, thank you ma&#39;m. It actually recently changed.&quot; She giggled, showing a pearly ring on her finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, he must really love you!&quot; Hana marveled, noting its size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well he better, seeing as he&#39;s gonna be the father of my ch-&quot; Kylie suddenly stopped, covering her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you pregnant?&quot; Hana asked, figuring she now knew what had happened to the cat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, oh god, I haven&#39;t even told Germaine yet.&quot; She replied, beginning to tear up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey hey hey, it&#39;s ok, that&#39;s just pregnancy brain talking.&quot; Hana reminded her. &quot;I promise I won&#39;t tell a soul, and Germaine will never know.&quot; She laughed, pretending to zip up her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, you&#39;re sweet.&quot; Kylie sniffled. &quot;Oh dear, I am being COMPLETELY unprofessional. Why don&#39;t I show you around?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually if you don&#39;t mind I sorta need to be somewhere soon, I really only had time for a quick glance.&quot; Hana lied, feeling the rush of power and the need to get more revenge on others.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s too bad, I&#39;ve been a little bored with not that many people coming by.&quot; Kylie joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, with a place like this?&quot; Hana asked, gawking at its beauty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I normally wouldn&#39;t say this to potential customers but seeing as you won&#39;t be buying, there&#39;s been a little uptick in crime around here.&quot; Kylie whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Hana asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I&#39;m almost positive that once they replace the local officer who retired recently that&#39;ll be going down.&quot; Kylie assured her.<br />
<br />
Hana, however, was a little worried. Was this uptick in crime her fault? After all, she transformed the police officer of the area into a pot head girl. She figured reality would just replace him, but apparently it replaced him with his former predecessor who was now too old to continue, meaning they needed fresh blood stat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well, thank&#39;s for your hospitality.&quot; Hana replied as she walked away in a hurry.<br />
<br />
She jumped back into her car and drove off towards Henry&#39;s old apartment complex. She glanced by and noticed the place looked more disheveled than it had been when Henry lived there. That meant there was no landlord that replaced Kylie! &quot;Shit, shit I may be getting rid of awful people, but if I don&#39;t replace their direct positions I may be making things generally worse if I keep this up.&quot; She mumbled, slapping her forehead for being so stupid as to not take more consideration fo the magical, reality changing device.<br />
<br />
Now, the question was, did it matter? Surly a temporary slight tick in minor crime and a slightly shittier place to live were better than having a manipulative, harsh landlord and a cop that would take sex as bribery... right? And what about her other plans? She still wanted to teach others a lesson. There was Hailey’s abusive stepfather, the town mayor Dewey Johnson who abused his power for petty and hurtful reasons, and Hana’s neighbor who frequently made racist comments to her. </p>
