<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ms Q had a passion for metal work, including making artwork muriels out of scrap metal. She invited Todd around to have a view. The 13 yo with a large backpack and a portly frame showed up at her door. Todd was 5 foot, 110 pounds, Ms Q however saw a six foot plus man with a chiseled body. Her heart skipped a beat as she took him in. She wore a maxi shirt dress that wrapped around her busty figure showing just enough of her cleavage. <br />
<br />
At first they went through her artwork before going into her house. On her wall was a picture of her Bella and her ex on the wall. When Todd asked about him Ms Q mused about how young men were, she made him hot chocolate in a bowl and they started eating. Through her contacts the otherwise pasty white zit riddled face of Todd looked like the smooth olive skin like a latino hunk. <br />
<br />
As they sat on the couch she felt a surge of girlish glee as she started to paint his button nose with the rich surgery brown chocolate on.Todd shifted and snorted with fear, to Ms Q it sounded like a laugh, she started to paint a line on either cheek. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I made a mess here, only one way to clean it up...&quot; <br />
<br />
She started to lick his face like a dog licking a bowl clean. Todd felt her hot tongue shoved down his mouth as she fondled him. His hand reached for the patch of her exposed leg, reaching for her panties. Suddenly she pushed him away and left the room as if disgusted with what she saw. <br />
<br />
But out of sight she turned of the lights, then she called for Todd to turn off the lamp. He was scared of what was happening then she threw her sweater onto his lap, what did this mean?<br />
<br />
Ms Q walked into the room her shirt riding up her legs as she walking into the room. Todd was rooted to the couch, as she placed a knee either side of him and started kissing him. She found it somewhat difficult to mash her face against his as if he seemed shorter but she was so intoxicated with Todd that she made her body work him.<br />
<br />
Was he gay?! she wondered she guided his hands to her breasts Todd had no idea what to do so she massaged his hands to give him the hint. He seemed mesmerized, was he a virgin? Todd was way over he felt the extra 30 pounds and the foot or more that his teacher had on him. Her weight was pinning him to the couch as he squirmed like a child trying to escape a high chair.<br />
<br />
Taking control she guided his hands to take her shirt back, pushing the fabric to fall to around her ass. Her breasts were restrained in a tight fitted black lace bra. The beautiful mounds bounced and shook even in such a tight fabric, Todd decided to push her onto the ground so he could try and think of a way out. <br />
<br />
Still thinking him a grown man Ms Q rolled with Todd on the floor, she thought that he seemed weaker than he looked, what kind of body building supplements were he on? She could see him tower over her, but he felt lighter than he should. What the fuck was going on? <br />
<br />
Ms Q ran a hand over Todd&#39;s face to see if he were a real man but he had moved down to her panties. Todd now understood, the witch had made it clear that what she was seeing wasn&#39;t what she was feeling. He moved down her body past her huge Ds and down to her panties as Todd started to work on her pussy, tugging inexpertly at the black lace.<br />
<br />
More sound effects than actual pleasure she moaned in a way to encourage him. Frustrated she helped him take off her bra. He fumbled with her breasts but she grew more frustrated  with him. Surprisingly easily she flipped Todd on to his back and pulled down his pants making him grope her breasts she started to ride him.<br />
<br />
Todd felt like he was being pinned by school bullies, would she force his head into the toilet? She guided his dick into him and started riding him with a lust reserved for desperate women. Despite being pinned by her weight Todd played along fondling her  breasts until with a limp jerk he came.</p>
