<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh got up early the next day and followed his brother instructions began working out. His brother had written a set of instructions to follow and afterward had to drink some disgusting protein shakes. Shaken up a bit, Josh went to take a shower and found someone inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joe? What are you doing up so early?&quot; Josh asked. Joe had just stepped out of the bathroom with a towel around his waist. &quot;I&#39;m so used to waking up early that I decided to go ahead and shower&quot; He responded. Josh shrugged and went inside the bathroom and began undressing. &quot;What are you doing?!&quot; Joe exclaimed. He closed the bathroom door from the inside and decided to continue talking with his brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen that&#39;s my body but I don&#39;t anyone else to see it&quot; Joe said. &quot;Why? Your pee pee is huge!&quot; Josh said and shook it around. &quot;Yeah but...&quot; Joe stammered. Josh then pulled the towel off Job&#39;s waist. &quot;What the-&quot; Joe tried to cover himself but Josh pushed his arms away. &quot;I forgot my pee pee was so small&quot; Josh said as he inspected it. &quot;Stop! Josh this is really weird&quot; Joe said but Josh continued to examine his body. &quot;Woah!&quot; Josh hoisted Joe by the arms and turned his around. &quot;I never knew I had a birthmark on my right butt cheek&quot; Josh said with excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please stop&quot; Joe exclaimed. He was blushing and extremely embarrased. &quot;It&#39;s not weird Joe in fact you can look at your body now&quot; Josh said and placed him on the ground. Joe still blushing saw Josh turn around. &quot;So do you also have a birthmark or what?&quot; Josh asked. Joe pushed away his old naked body and answered a solid &quot;no&quot;. Things were getting way to weird for comfort.<br />
<br />
Joe grabbed his towel wrapped it along his waist and left once more. He entered Josh&#39;s room and found some clothes. He grabbed and put on the superhero briefs he had grown to like and went downstairs to eat breakfast after changing . Joe had prepared to eat some chicken and vegetables when he recalled something. &quot;Wait! This is Josh&#39;s body I can eat anything in his...&quot; Joe thought and instantly grabbed some milk and a cereal box full of sugary flakes. All he needed was a bowl. They were located in the leftmost cupboard but Joe couldn&#39;t reach. &quot;I&#39;ll just go get a chair...&quot; Joe said but Josh entered the kitchen fully dressed and looking quite refreshed and said &quot; Let me help out bro&quot;.<br />
<br />
 Josh easily opened the cupboard and pulled out two cereal bowls. &quot;Why&#39;d you bring out two?&quot; Joe asked. &quot;One for me of course&quot; He said. &quot;Actually Josh you can&#39;t eat cereal in my body&quot; Joe said and Josh soon made a face of distress. &quot;Really?&quot; He said downridden. &quot;Sorry Josh but if you eat a bowl you&#39;ll have to work out harder and have extra helpings of my diet&quot; Joe said. Josh made a face of disgust and said he wouldn&#39;t mind missing cereal for the day. Joe grinned.<br />
<br />
After eating their breakfast  (Joe had cereal and Josh ate the meal Joe had made earlier) the door bell rang. &quot;I&#39;ll get it&quot; Josh said happy to have an excuse and opened the door to see one of Joe&#39;s classmates. He was wearing running gear and was holding a pamphlet. &quot;Joe why aren&#39;t you dressed? Don&#39;t you remember today&#39;s annual fun run?&quot; His classmate asked. &quot;Uh...&quot; Josh said but Joe pushed him aside. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Jacob he&#39;ll be there soon&quot; Joe said and closed the door. &quot;Shit! I forgot about the fun run&quot; Joe said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that mean...&quot; Josh said. Joe nodded. &quot;You&#39;ll have to run in my place&quot; Joe said. Josh frowned again. Being stuck in his brothers body so far had gotten him icky food and tons of exercise and except for his amazing body Josh was ready to swap back. &quot;Go get changed and I can help you stretch and work out before the race&quot; Joe said and Josh went upstairs.<br />
<br />
After getting hanged Joe led his brother through stretches and made his do a few work outs. By the end Josh was exhausted and dehydrated. &quot;Here! Remember to drink lots of water&quot; Joe said. &quot;There you are Josh&quot; A voice said. Joe and Josh looked up to see their mother coming toward them. They had practiced in the neighborhood and we&#39;re lying in the front yard. &quot;Josh you remember that play date I got you well it&#39;s about start so go inside and get ready&quot; She said and pushed Joe to the front door. &quot;Oh I hope you do well at your race sweetie&quot; She said and gave Josh a quick kiss on the cheek.<br />
<br />
1 HOUR LATER<br />
<br />
Josh stood at the line next to a few other runners. Why did he feel so nervous? &quot;On your mark... get set...   GO!!!&quot; A man yelled through a microphone and they began running. Josh stared to feel on ease but then felt an odd sensation. He didn&#39;t feel tired in fact he felt amazing! He easily passed the other runners and was soon in the front. No wonder his brother was a star athlete. His body was incredible! Josh finished the race in first and spent the rest of the day at home relaxing.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Joe was taken to one of his mother&#39;s friends house and left to play with her son, a boy his age, in the backyard. &quot;What do you want to do?&quot; Mark, the boy, asked. Joe grunted and the two soon were playing on the swing sets quietly. Mark kept talking about some nonsense that Joe had no interest in. All he wanted to do was go home. &quot;Hey Josh?&quot; Mark asked. &quot;Hmm?&quot; Joe responded. &quot;I think it&#39;s time for you to go&quot; He said. Joe looked and up and smiled. His mom had indeed began walking over to him. Joe ran up to her excited. &quot;Looks like you two had a fun time&quot; She said and Joe shook his head in confirmation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry we have to go but I&#39;ll bring you back tomorrow&quot; She said. Joe gaped at her but heard Mark&#39;s cries of joy behind him. After saying farewell Joe went back home and raced to the phone and called Mr. Adams. &quot;Is the game system fixed yet?&quot; He asked. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Josh. It should be done by 3:00 in the afternoon. You can come get it after school.&quot; He hung up leaving Joe is distress.</p>
