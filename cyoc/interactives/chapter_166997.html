<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There had been a thought, when she first started attending college - for a moment back then, Cassandra had wondered if she was going to end up experimenting with other women. Just a brief thought, not really brought to the forefront throughout the rest of her university days. Back then, though... she definitely hadn&#39;t imagined that if she did end up in an experience with a member of the same sex, that it would involve... well... any of this wild shit.<br />
<br />
But she wasn&#39;t exactly opposed to it. &quot;Please just be...&quot; Gentle? That was the cliche, what she instinctually started to say, but... no. No, this body she now possessed, it wasn&#39;t made for gentle action. &quot;Rough.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was all the invitation her companion needed. With a passionate thrust her lips pressed against the redhead&#39;s, tongues rapidly becoming entwined with each other. Her hands shot up around the Succubus&#39;s back, carefully navigating around her wings so that she could pull the woman closer. Her companion responded with razor-sharp claws digging into her skin - they could cut through leather with ease, but failed to draw blood on Cassandra&#39;s enchanted body, merely causing immense pain. She relished in it, loving every second that her nails dug in, every moment that passion caused that delicate grip to tighten.<br />
<br />
The amazon&#39;s hands moved away from the silky skin of her lover&#39;s back, not for long - merely needing enough time to rip away her remaining armor pieces, and the robe still half-draped on the body of her demonic lover. The garments were soon scattered across the steps leading up to the fountain, Cassandra&#39;s hands and legs now wrapping around Elizabeth, forcing their bodies hard together. The unabated kiss was filled with moans as their bosoms smashed together, stomachs struggling to touch with such massive chests creating space between them.<br />
<br />
A tingle crawled up her leg as something brushed by it - the spade end of Elizabeth&#39;s tail, its tip trailing from her foot to thigh at an alarming rate. It was not meant to tease or excite, but merely to travel fast, before slipping between pairs of hips that had begun to crush and rub agaisnt each other. She offered no warning before the considerably-sized spade thrust itself within the amazon. She screamed in wonderful pain, squirming as it wormed its way deeper and deeper, its girth and sharpness pushing the resilience of her new body to the edge.<br />
<br />
Her hands shifted to the succubus&#39; hips, grasping at her rear end and shoving her crotch towards the tail; her smoky voice let out a surprised cry of delight as her own moistened entrance was shoved against her tail, unable to move away thanks to her lover&#39;s inhuman strength. At the same time, her upper body was no longer restricted, allowing her to lean up, clawed hands trailing from Cassandra&#39;s shoulders to her bountiful chest. Where her nails dragged, painful red scratches were left behind, earning new gasps of excitement from the redhead.<br />
<br />
She was unprepared for the surge of pleasure that rocked her body as Elizabeth&#39;s hands gripped her breasts as tight as they could manage, the large masses of soft flesh squeezing through her fingers. Black-feathered wings struggled to keep Cassandra still as her lover bent down, suckling on one pert nipple for just a moment before her sharp teeth clenched around it. Fangs sunk deep into the sensitive flesh, producing new waves of agony that caused her back to arc in ecstacy. She was certain that the yanking back of her lover&#39;s head would tear the skin straight from her chest, but her body yet held out.<br />
<br />
It almost made her feel guilty, to be assaulted with so much agonizing joy, and to offer so little in return. Instinct screamed at her to do more, to show the succubus her own newfound power. In a sudden swing her legs came up, taking over the job her hands had been performing on Elizabeth&#39;s hips, so that she could shift her hands up behind the woman&#39;s head. Entwined in rich blonde hair, she pulled down and squeezed at the same time, forcing her face against her massive chest. She could feel under her hands the struggle of Elizabeth&#39;s skull to resist the pressure of her strength, and it occurred to her that this mystical woman was not nearly so indestructible as Cassandra had become.<br />
<br />
The realization was an exhilirating one. A thrilling discovery made in her mind, that this demon who might have ripped a normal woman to shreds was, ultimately, quite helpless before all this power raging in her body. She yearned, ached, to express that might; with ease she rolled over, her scuplted body now using all its weight to hold Elizabeth against the floor. Moans of surprise with a hint of panic left the woman - she knew what conclusion Cassandra had come to, and it scared her as much as it excited her. <br />
<br />
No longer needing both hands to keep the succubus in place, she reserved one to press down slightly on the woman&#39;s neck, as the other grasped her tail. With a single strong tug, she pulled it directly from her fold, screaming at her own new pain and the dizziness that briefly followed its removal. Juices splashed from the now-writhing spade as she dragged her moist clit up the succubus&#39; stomach, painfully bull-rushing through the hills of her chest before the entrance came to rest against Elizabeth&#39;s mouth. She needed no other instruction - her tongue shot out instantly, licking furiously as teeth gnashed helplessly against any flesh where they might find purchase.<br />
<br />
She struggled more and more even as she attended to the amazon&#39;s heated folds, kicking and clawing as breathing was constricted by the sheer weight of so glorious large a posterier pressing into her throat. It was all for naught, her head unable to so much as slightly turn as Cassandra&#39;s thighs held it in place. One of her hands reached back, easily forcing down the writhing crotch of the demoness, fingers pushing forcefully into soaking-wet lips. She was certain that if she pulled in just the right way, she could rip the woman in half; as horrific as the thought was, that she had the capability brought a carnal glee to her heart.<br />
<br />
That heart skipped several beats as she felt her muscles tense, the first wave of orgasm crashing over her in a moment of screaming, bellowing bliss. She could feel it rippling across her lover soon after, followed by another, then another - surge after surge of pleasure like she&#39;d never before imagined. Every new rush was like a lightning bolt ripping through her every fiber, cascading into another in a storm of mind-numbing bursts. It was an energy that she could only have imagined would have annihilated her before, fried her brain and every nerve - even in her superhuman form, she could feel a delightful strain with every surge, the magic coursing through her just barely able to prevent her from being torn apart.<br />
<br />
She had lost count of how many times it had happened when exhaustion set in. She wanted more, desperately, but she could hardly even move anymore - her muscles ached, her mind staggered, overwhelmed with primal sensations of lust and pleasure. With one final sigh she fell off to the side, leaning against the edge of the fountain for support as she glanced at her lover. Elizabeth&#39;s flailing had been replaced by a shocked gaze upwards and rapid, haggard breaths, her lungs and heart working overtime in the wake of so much raw ecstacy. That she even lived after such an experience was enough to impress Cassandra right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;That...&quot; the redhead could barely get out a single word, her breaths coming only with concerted effort. &quot;Wow...&quot;<br />
<br />
The succubus couldn&#39;t even speak, merely nodding in agreement. Recognizing how difficult it had been for the woman, Cassandra reached over, calling up what strength she could still muster to drag Elizabeth to her and prop the woman against the fountain next to her. As seductive as the blonde was, in her utterly worn-out state, there was something... cute, almost, about her. <br />
<br />
Whether her brain was just muddled from their encounter or whether she was developing some affection for this strange demoness, Cassandra couldn&#39;t say - and it really didn&#39;t matter right now. She was, quite simply, content to pull her arm around that hourglass frame, nestle their heads together, close her eyes, and rest for a little while.</p>
