<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam couldn&#39;t help staring as Melissa adjusted the water&#39;s temperature and sprayed her legs in preparation for the shaving session. Not only did she sport several rows of breast-looking teats below her large bosom, but the dark hair over her crotch looked a little bit like fur. Her legs also seemed more hairy than girls her age, though perhaps it was just because she also looked more mature, Sam couldn&#39;t say for certain. Some part of her wondered if her own body was bound to turn into this.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s best to wet your skin before applying the shaving cream. You go ahead and I&#39;ll show you&quot; Melissa states, handing over the shower head. She grabbed the cream and applied a generous amount on her legs. Sam wet her legs and repeated the same process. Melissa then took the razor and showed Sam how to do it. Sam realized it was not different at all from when she shaved her beard as a guy, and much easier in fact because the area was larger and smoother than one&#39;s chin or jawline. She also shaved her armits.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if want to do my crotch too&quot;, Sam hesitated. &quot;Maybe just a trim?&quot; Melissa handed her over the scissors and she reduced the amount of her she had. The texture felt different than the rest of her body hair, and she wondered if it was turning more dog-like.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are some important things you should know as well&quot; Melissa continued umprompted. &quot;If you go to the loo and poop, you need to wipe front to back. You do NOT want to bring bad stuff in your vagina, so always wipe away from it. If you see any weird discharge coming out of there or feel super itchy , you should see a doctor. Now we rince our legs, and take a shower.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two girls stepped into the shower to wash away the cream and body hair. Melissa wet her dark brown hair, the curls straightening somewhat under their own weight. They both squirted liquid soap into their hands and began rubbing their own bodies vigorously. It was difficult for Sam not to stare as Melissa&#39;s heavy breasts moved and bounced around under the running water. She felt almost envious. She also had a ton of questions to ask, but didn&#39;t know where to start.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, uh... What is it like, masturbating as a girl? I mean, I haven&#39;t done it yet and it makes me kinda nervous now to think about it. Like, what if it doesn&#39;t feel as good as before&quot; Sam asked and blushed. Melissa didn&#39;t laugh at her though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s not that different really. I mean I&#39;ve never had a dick, but with a little of rubbing and tugging, you get just the same effect. Minus the semen of course. You should definitively try it&quot; Melissa suggested. &quot;Dicks are clearly overrated, you can get much better orgasms from your clit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s hand lingered over her crotch, unsure of herself. &quot;I don&#39;t even know where things really are... I haven&#39;t had the time to look at myself that closely. I don&#39;t know for sure where is my clitoris&quot; she blushed even harder.<br />
<br />
She felt Melissa step behind her back on the wet tiles and grab her wrist, directing her hand. Sam&#39;s finger brushed against her own crotch, over her lips, circling around.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll know it when you find it&quot; Melissa said in a soft, gentle voice behind her. She directed Sam&#39;s hand, sliding up her lips, and it brushed against a tiny wet bump. The touch immediately provoked a pulsating warmth under Sam&#39;s her finger, and made her quirm in need.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what do I do when I&#39;ve found it&quot;, Sam asked holding her breath. Was it okay to even ask Melissa? Is it something other girls do? She had no idea. She felt Melissa&#39;s breath closer in the back of her neck. Melissa on the other hand felt confident in herself and amused at her hold over Sam, but did not want to overstep.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s up to you&quot; Melissa replies close to her ear. She held Sam&#39;s hand more firmly in her own and pushed slightly, Sam&#39;s fingers pressing more firmly over her newfound clitoris. Sam could tell the tiny nub was hardening faintly in response, making her feel weak on her knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I need to know... what it&#39;s like&quot;, Sam whispered, devoured by curiousity and some amount of lust.<br />
<br />
Melissa passed her other arm around Sam&#39;s body to bring her closer. A shiver of pleasure ran down Sam&#39;s spine as she felt Melissa&#39;s breasts pressed against her back. She could swear Melissa&#39;s nipples were hard against her wet skin, and she couldn&#39;t deny the sensation was turning her on. She felt some muscles clench in her lower belly in anticipation.<br />
<br />
Melissa entertwined her fingers with Sam&#39;s, guiding the hand in precise motions, gently flicking Sam&#39;s swelling clit. Sam felt herself engorge with blood and feared for a second that she would grow back a dick right in this instant, but nothing of the sort happened. Instead, the pleasurable pressure and tingling from her clit intensified under the expert guidance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never too rough to begin with&quot; Melissa whispered in Sam&#39;s ear again, &quot;but once you feel warmed up, you can go harder.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam pressed her and Melissa&#39;s fingers more firmly over her clit, and a wave of pleasure radiated from her crotch, a weak moan escaping her throat. Melissa doublebacked and rubbed Sam&#39;s clit again in circular motions, alternating light and fast touch with slow and firm pressure.<br />
<br />
By now Sam was panting heavily and doing her best to keep quiet. It was too late to stop and she didn&#39;t want to anyway, but she knew Cole wouldn&#39;t be too pleased if he caught Melissa with her. Damn, she felt a little dirty actually, doing something like this with her boyfriend&#39;s sister, but it&#39;s not like there was any feelings with Melissa, right? Sam thought to herself. She had known for a while she was trans and into boys, but she wasn&#39;t too sure about girls. How can you tell if you like girls because you want to be like them, or because you actually are into them?<br />
<br />
Right now she didn&#39;t care anymore if it was one thing or both, she simply let herself focus on her own pleasure, guided by Melissa&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
Melissa was outwardly keeping her cool, but thoughts were racing in her head as well. In the beginning she just wanted to be helpful. Then, she saw an opportunity to get back at her brother for fucking Erika - he had put his dick in her friend and lover, it was only natural she gets her hands on his girlfriend. And now, she was just enjoying getting intimate with another girl again. She hadn&#39;t had the occasion to do anything since her strange pregnancy over the past couple days, and she couldn&#39;t deny Sam&#39;s curiousity was endearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I think I&#39;m getting close&quot; Sam whispered, her back still pressed against Melissa&#39;s soft breasts. She was really on edge.<br />
<br />
Melissa grabbed the shower head with her free hand and let the hot water run over Sam&#39;s crotch while they both rubbed her hard clit. The small hood was getting yanked left and right, exposing the head of the clit. Sam felt the hot water rush over it, Melissa&#39;s fingers and her own, all the sensations melting together has her insides clenches. Her clitoris tensed and seemed as if about to explode, and she got hit by her strongest orgasm to date, refraining a lewd yelp of surprise. Her whole body shook and a black veil fell over her eyes.<br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s body bucked a few times in Melissa&#39;s arms before going almost limp. Her legs couldn&#39;t support her anymore, but Melissa hold her tight until she recovered. The two girls finished rinsing themselves under the warm water.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was... wow&quot;, Sam finally said as they were getting out of the shower.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know! And the fun is only starting, you&#39;ll figure it out for yourself. For real though, guys don&#39;t know how to treat girls properly.&quot; Melissa went on. &quot;I don&#39;t understand what you see in my brother. He&#39;s immature and only thinks with his dick. I hope the best for you, but I caught him fucking around before. How can you be sure he&#39;ll behave himself if he&#39;s turned into a breeding machine?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam didn&#39;t know what to answer. She wanted to believe his feelings were sincere, but they were only teens. And he had sprayed himself with the salve. Perhaps Melissa was right?<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Cole wouldn&#39;t do that&quot;, Sam protested. &quot;I do think he likes me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you be sure he really likes you as a girl though, when you started fooling around with him when you looked like a boy though?&quot; Melissa teased with a mean streak. &quot;What if you end up pregnant, and he gest bored with playing house with you? He&#39;s too immature to be a parent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam felt irritated by the relentless questioning. She wrapped the towel around her and left the bathroom quickly to get new clothes. Melissa&#39;s mom had left a pile in the bedroom for her so she put on underwear, a woman&#39;s pair of tight jeans, and a cute black crop top that fit her new chest. There were other clothes for her to borrow and bring home, until she would get her own.<br />
<br />
On that thought, she heard her mom&#39;s voice in the living room, talking with Cole and Melissa&#39;s mom. She had arrived! With a knot in her tummy, she meekly walked down the corridor to meet with her mom, trying to forget Melissa&#39;s words even though her body was still warm from the afterglow.</p>
