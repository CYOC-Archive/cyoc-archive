<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He sighed as the light faded from around him. While used to teleportation, the spell tended to leave it&#39;s user rather disoriented. Glancing around the open clearing, his sight was met by countless trees.<br />
<br />
As he looked to the night sky, a full moon greeted him, bathing him and the forest in it&#39;s magnificent luster. The shadows from the countless trees stretched across the ground, giving the grove a rather eerie atmosphere. Yet at the same time, there was a serene beauty to it.<br />
<br />
The faint scent of smoke drifts to his nostrils, forcing him to cough. A faint glow in the distance signalled a campfire. Adjusting his hood, a rather ornate looking tome is revealed from beneath his robe, an unusual eye-like symbol at it&#39;s cover. He sighs, feeling protected by it&#39;s presence.<br />
<br />
“Quite unusual to be wandering the woods by yourself at this hour, don&#39;t you think?” A voice echoes throughout the clearing.<br />
<br />
Tensing up at the voice, he desperately spins around attempting to find it&#39;s source. Glancing at a tree, his gaze lands upon a young man appearing to be in his early twenties, glaring directly at him. The red tunic he wore theoretically should&#39;ve made him stick out in a forested environment, but even then the shadows from the countless trees easily concealed him. As red clothed man stepped out from the shadows, his features were illuminated by the moonlight. The man&#39;s fair skin was deathly pale in the moonlight, his blonde hair parted down the middle. Eyes as blue as the ocean glared at him.<br />
<br />
Twirling a sword in his right hand and brandishing a shield in his left, his knees were bent and posture stiff as if he&#39;d be ready to attack at any given notice.<br />
<br />
“I could ask you the same thing,” the hooded figure replies. Pointing a finger towards the faint glow of fire in the distance, his head tilts. “That campfire, is it yours?”<br />
<br />
The blue eyed human&#39;s eyes follow the direction he pointed. “And if it is?”<br />
<br />
“I… seem to be lost at the moment. Would it be any trouble for you if I could stay at your campfire for the night? Wandering these woods at such a late hour would be for the dim-witted. As soon as dawn breaks I&#39;ll be on my way.”<br />
<br />
The blonde haired youth frowns at this, falling silent as if in consideration. “Now, why exactly should I believe such a tale? I recall there being a flash of light mere moments ago, and in it&#39;s place was <i>you</i>.” He points his sword to the hooded figure, lowering it until the tip is at the figure&#39;s tome.<br />
<br />
“Not to mention that tome you&#39;re carrying. You know as well as I do that a blast from such a thing could kill me. Who&#39;s to say you haven&#39;t already charged a spell to end my life as soon as I turn the opposite direction?”<br />
<br />
Glancing at the tome in his hand, the figure hesitates. Already it&#39;s pages lay open. A sight like that would make anyone uneasy. <br />
<br />
Untrusting.<br />
<br />
“I understand your caution, warrior. If I was in your position I&#39;d probably react the same way.” Holding the tome with both hands, he gently closed it. Puzzlement washes over his face as the human remains in his battle ready position.<br />
<br />
“Is there something else I must do in order to prove to you I mean no harm?” He asks. The blonde haired human nods.<br />
<br />
“Remove your hood. I want your name too.”<br />
<br />
The figure pauses. <br />
<br />
<i>Should he?</i><br />
<br />
The tome quivers in his hands, as if threatening to open. <br />
<br />
“How can I trust <i>you</i>?” His purple eyes glint from beneath the hood, causing the warrior to step back as they stared into his soul.<br />
<br />
The pairs conversation is interrupted by the loud crunching of underbrush. The hooded figure&#39;s mouth opens in awe as a large shadow rises from behind the youthful warrior. What shocks him more is that the human remains unflinching.<br />
<br />
“Took you long enough to show up, Orveus. Enjoy changing?” The human asks the figure behind him. A feral grin spreads across Orveus’ now canine like face.<br />
<br />
“I meant it when I said being a werewolf earns you a life of bliss. Still up for the offer, Kairos?” <br />
<br />
Kairos mockingly laughs in response, but ends it with an exhausted smile, &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
Orveus shrugs. “Your loss.” Glancing at the hooded figure in the clearing, the werewolf&#39;s golden eyes fill with puzzlement.<br />
<br />
“You were the source of that light, weren&#39;t you?” No answer came from the purple eyed figure. The lupine&#39;s feral yet intelligent eyes glance down at the closed book in his hands. “That’s quite the interesting tome you have there. I&#39;ve never seen such a curious design. Who taught you your craft?” <br />
<br />
“You wield magic too?” The figure asks, ignoring the question. Both human and wolfman glance at each other in confusion. The figure sighs, pointing to the object in Orveus’ clawed hands. “That book you hold in your claws. I&#39;ve never seen a werewolf hold a tome before.” Orveus chuckles at the statement.<br />
<br />
“I am no mage. This book is simply filled with countless legends of our world. I was planning to read over them with the stubborn human beside me, but you happened before I could even take it out.” A subtle frown crosses the figure&#39;s face. <br />
<br />
“...I see.” He whispers, the disappointed look on his face obscured by his hood. <br />
<br />
“You haven&#39;t answered my question though. Where did you learn your craft?” The figure falls silent once again.<br />
<br />
Kairos only shakes his head. “You&#39;ve refused to remove your hood and tell us your name. Now you dodge a question completely. I&#39;m aware of how such questions can cause unease, but unfortunately we&#39;re looking for someone who also happens to wield magic. The silent treatment isn&#39;t helping your case.”<br />
<br />
Awaiting an answer, the entire forest goes silent.<br />
<br />
“...My name is... Kenos.” He whispers, bringing a clawed hand to his hood. The figure&#39;s, <i>Kenos’</i> skin, was grey and scaly, a detail previously obscured by the hood and robe he wore. Pulling his hood away, his lizard-like face beared a displeased frown. His reptilian eyes shone with a dangerous luster.<br />
<br />
“A lizardman mage? Quite the rare sight.” Orveus scratches his ear in bemusement. “I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve revealed yourself to us so easily. It&#39;s quite an honor to be <i>blessed</i> by your presence.” <br />
<br />
“I imagine it must be. You both came here to seek me out. Foolish of you to come without protection though.” The grey lizardman&#39;s purple eyes narrow in slight disappointment. “I&#39;ll admit, I didn&#39;t anticipate there being two of you. Even if I am out-numbered, I&#39;m kind enough to give you the chance to turn back and flee.” <br />
<br />
Both warriors remain in their positions. Kairos readies his weapon while Orveus cracks his knuckles, flexing his claws in anticipation for the coming bloodshed. Kenos shakes his head and sighs.</p>
