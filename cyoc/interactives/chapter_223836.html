<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> Ashley felt a pang of sadness as she realized that she would never experience the pleasure and intimacy of sex again. She covered her naked form with a blanket, feeling empty and alone.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, watching the videos of the people of this world sensually cuddling and rubbing bodies had made her horny in a bizarre way which she had never felt before.  She opened up her phone,  and desperately flipped through her contacts for someone to be sensual with. <br />
<br />
There was no one she could think of who would be up for something like that, so she settled for the next best thing: masturbation. She lay down on her bed and started stroking herself, trying to conjure up sensations of sex and excitement. But no matter how hard she tried, she couldn&#39;t feel anything.  She was still horny,  but stroking the bare skin between her legs just made her hornier, with no relief. <br />
<br />
The urge to kiss someone and to rub her bare body against someone else&#39;s was becoming overpowering.<br />
<br />
 She wondered if any of the other people in this world had similar urges, or if they were just content with being asexual. As she continued to masturbate, she wondered if this was what being asexual felt like.  She realized it must not be,  because she still felt such a strong urge.   <br />
<br />
It was a struggle, but she finally managed to sign up for this world&#39;s version ofva dating app, through her horniness.<br />
<br />
 She created a profile, describing herself as a &#39;curious, open-minded quantum physicist looking to experience pleasure and intimacy.&#39; She didn&#39;t know what to expect, but she figured she&#39;d give it a try. The app was pretty simple to use, and she soon matched with a few potential partners.  They all looked like different types of slightly androgynous but pretty females. <br />
<br />
She clicked on the closest one to her,  who seemed cute. <br />
<br />
 Ashley was nervous, but decided to message them anyway. She explained that she was looking for a way to experience pleasure and intimacy, and they seemed to be open to it. They invited her over to their apartment, and she accepted.<br />
<br />
 As she arrived, she was greeted by a tall, lanky woman with auburn hair and deep green eyes. Ashley introduced herself, and they sat down to chat over drinks. They chatted for a while, and the conversation was pleasant and light.<br />
<br />
 Ashley couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense nervousness about what to expect. But as she chatted with the woman, her nervousness faded. The woman seemed kind and gentle, and Ashley felt comfortable with her,  to the point,  she sat next to her,  and wrapped an arm around her.   The woman&#39;s name was  Luna, and as they talked, Ashley could feel the connection growing between them. They held hands as they talked, and Luna leaned in close to kiss Ashley. As their lips touched, Ashley felt a wave of excitement wash over her.<br />
<br />
 Ashley couldn&#39;t believe it!  Just kissing Luna felt like a mini-orgasm throughout her whole body! She pulled away slightly, catching her breath, then looked deep into Luna&#39;s eyes. They locked gazes for a moment, and Ashley knew this was what she wanted to do.<br />
<br />
Luna chuckled,  gently: &quot;Have you never mixed before?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Ashley didn&#39;t even know what she meant, so she just whispered, &quot;No&quot; <br />
<br />
Luna giggled a little and said, &quot;it&#39;s okay ... i really want to it with you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ashley shook her head yes,  still not understanding, but feeling uncontrollably horniness throughput her whole body for Luna at this point. <br />
<br />
Luna took her hand, and the contact felt shocking and erotic.  She lead her into the bedroom,  and began to undress.<br />
<br />
 Ashley did the same, and as she took off her clothes, she noticed how smooth and unblemished her skin was, just like her own.  She had no scars, no stretch marks, no imperfections, no boobs, and no pussy.  <br />
<br />

<br />
 She barely noticed that a thick sweat, almost like a film was beginning to coat her body.   She only noticed when Luna ran a hand over her and whispered, &quot;Wow, you&#39;re really,  really wet already. &quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley blushed, embarrassed, but she didn&#39;t really mind. She continued to touch and feel Luna, her naked body pressed against hers. It felt so wonderful and intimate, like a perfect fit.  <br />
<br />
She noticed that Luna was starting to sweat the thick film all over her body too, from every pore, though not as much yet as herself.   It felt weird but incredibly good.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of intense exploring, Luna moved on top of Ashley and began kissing her deeply. Ashley moaned as she felt Luna&#39;s lips and tongue against hers, her body heating up even more. Luna began to rock her body against Ashley&#39;s, andv she moaned: &quot;I think we&#39;re ready. &quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley nodded, her heart pounding wildly. She wasn&#39;t sure what to expect, but she knew this was what she wanted. Luna started to rub their bodies, especially their blank crotche, together with intensity, and Ashley felt a jolt of electricity run through her body.<br />
<br />
 Suddenly, she felt something warm and wet against her bare skin, covering her body.   It was the sweaty substance coming from Luna&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; she gasped, as Luna&#39;s wetness spread across them both.<br />
Luna looked down at her and smiled. &quot;I&#39;m excited.  We&#39;re mixing,  baby!  We&#39;re really mixing!  Ohhh, it feels so good!&quot;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Ashley wasn&#39;t sure what Luna meant, but she didn&#39;t care about knowing anymore. All she could feel was the pleasure coursing through her body, overwhelming her senses. She returned Luna&#39;s kiss, unable to stop herself.<br />
<br />
 When she briefly opened her eyes,  Luna looked ... different ... more like ... her!<br />
<br />
 Their bodies were merging together, and Ashley could no longer tell where one ended and the other began. She could almost feel Luna&#39;s thoughts and emotions, like they were a part of her. It was dizzying and exhilarating, and she wanted it to go on forever.<br />
<br />
 Finally, they collapsed in a heap of spent energy and spent desire, breathing heavily into each other&#39;s mouths. Afterwards, Ashley lay there, still trying to catch her breath. She looked up at Luna, stunned by what had just happened.<br />
<br />
Luna now resembled a mix between herself and Ashley. She looked down at her own body: she was taller, lankier, and had curly auburn hair!  In other words,  she looked much more like Luna!  <br />
<br />
As she examined herself, she felt Luna&#39;s arm slide softly over her skin,  and Luna mosned: &quot;Mmm, that was great. it&#39;d been way to long since I last mixed. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
 They fell into silence, content to simply enjoy the afterglow of what they had just experienced, as Ashley tried to process what had happened.</p>
