<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By now your body was basically running on auto-pilot half the time, and you were actually ok with it doing so. It made what you currently were tasked with all that much easier to handle as well as ensure that you did it properly. Eric had instructed you to begin the final processes of &quot;converting over to bitchdom&quot;, as he so phrased it. Essentially, you were just tasked with finishing both of your physical and mental transitionings into a proper Bitch, and to finish them ASAP. <br />
<br />
You currently were in Eric&#39;s bathroom. For a pet, Eric was treated very well by Stacy. It was almost like in her eyes, Eric was a normal human, something which very soon, you would no longer ever expect to experience again. You didn&#39;t know what worried you more. That the thought of you losing the rest of what little humanity remained didn&#39;t really even phase you anymore, or the fact that now you were getting very eager to finish your conversion so as to not disappoint your Alpha. You even have by now repressed your old name and identity to somewhere deep within a dark reccess of your mind, so that unless you really dig at it for a while, and likely even get some kind of external aid, you couldn&#39;t remember being called any name other than Suki. <br />
<br />
If someone were to ask you to state your identity, you would tell them that you were Suki, a Bitch who is a German Shepherd mix. You belong to Eric, who is your Alpha. However, your owner is a human named Maria, who has an intimate relationship with Eric&#39;s owner, Stacy. You were not 100% sure what their exact relationship was, but it was clearly more than just simply friends. You figured this was the case because for the entire time you were giving Eric a blowjob, Stacy and Maria have been making out on the couch while completely naked. <br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t know exactly how humans reproduced in this alternate universe, but you did have a pretty good guess. Humans likely were just naturally born female dogs. In other words, if Eric and you mate and get you pregnant, if you were to give birth to a daughter, she would be considered a being a new human, and not as being a new dog. If this was how it worked, you wondered if you would be the one to raise her, or would your owners do that instead? Either way, you could worry about it later. You had an important task to complete. <br />
<br />
Just about an hour has passed since you accepted Eric as your Alpha. And the results of doing that were clear as day. It seemed that a big portion of this transition was stimulated by your mental state. If you repressed your acceptance of becoming a bitch for an alpha, then the transition seemed to slow down. Not ever stopping completely, but slowing down enough to where it would be a long time before you finished. The inverse was also true though. The faster you accepted it, the faster you transitioned into it. This was made all the more obvious to you by the speed of which you were now changing. <br />
<br />
Before you even met Eric in person, you had begun changing from just your memory of him stimulating your urge to become his Bitch. However this was a slow process because you were against it. But now that you accepted it, you were flying through the changes. In the last hour alone, you:<br />
<br />
• gained a female sounding voice<br />
• mentally swapped your pronouns <br />
• had your posture alter slightly to better suit your now quadropeddle lifestyle <br />
• had your arms and legs even out in length a bit more<br />
• developed a powerful urge to please your Alpha<br />
• had your dick begin to widen in its diameter as your urethra hole started to expand and become more and more sensitive<br />
<br />
All of these changes happened almost simultaneously too. It must have been when you swallowed your first of what would surely become countless loads of Eric&#39;s cum which set you off. You could only laugh at how ironic it was that now you were very addicted to it. You for a moment even had wondered if the Eric from your old universe would have ever considered dating you. Only to remember that you were a guy back then, so likely no.<br />
<br />
Eric walked over to where you were sitting as he returned from using the bathroom a.k.a. taking a piss outside. He even used the human door and not the built in doggie door that Stacy had installed. The moment your eyes met, you felt a warmth run up and down your front as 8 very small, and very red dots appeared, forming 2 columns. <br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like the transition is going smoothly. You were even chosen to become a breeder it seems.&quot; If Eric didn&#39;t point them out, you would never have even noticed them. But sure enough, you now were the proud owner of 8 new tits, to now accompany your already budding first pair which had by now reached a B cup, and were still steadily getting even larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by breeder?&quot; You asked Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are going to have 10 tits. Any bitch with more than 6 is considered to be a breeder. Basically it means that you are abnormally more fertile than the common bitches, who usually only have around 4 or 6 tits at most. Having 8 tits means you likely never will birth any less than at least 4 offspring at a time. Having 10 practically guarentees at least 6 each pregnancy, but often more. There has never been a case where a 10 tit breeder has only birthed a single offspring before&quot; explained Eric. The thought of you walking around being bloated from the added mass of 6 babies entered your mind, and it made you feel warm and excited.</p>
