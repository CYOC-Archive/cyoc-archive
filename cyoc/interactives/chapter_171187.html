<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brendon had a secret. He was a crossdressing pervert, and he knew it. It wasn&#39;t like he wanted to be a girl or anything of the sort. He just had a fetish for their clothing. However he wanted to keep that secret for the rest of his life. Unfortunately, he also just happened to enter the wrong forest with a bag full of his older sister&#39;s old clothing that he was supposed to be donating. As an 18 year old boy, of course he was intrested in sex and what not, and his college sister was a massive party slut. Sure she had a stable boyfriend for the last several years, but she just loved the party life so much that she would buy new sexy outfits all the time, wearing them maybe 2 times, then donating them. Little did she know that her expensive dresses, heels, panties, tights, etc... had gotten used more by her brother than by herself. His collection was steadily growing every month. <br />
<br />
When Brandon was a kid, he had discovered this abandoned shack in the woods near his home, and had made it into his fetish nest. From the outside, it was just a rundown shack, but inside it held several thousands of dollars worth of bairly used women&#39;s clothing. <br />
<br />
That was until the witch had stumbled upon it. Now she would wait every day hoping to find the horder, so that she could prank the unsuspecting girl. But the clothes belonging to a boy had been out of her expectations. But that was part of the fun. She would need to change her approach... or would she? Wouldn&#39;t just treating him like a girl also suffice as a prank? Well, unless he actually wanted to be one, but she had a feeling that wasn&#39;t the case.<br />
<br />
Several minutes later, Brendon unlocked the latch, and after making sure he hadn&#39;t been followed, he slipped inside. He was met with a grown women sitting in the chair smiling him down. But what really scared him was the floating ball of yellow light behind her head. That wasn&#39;t natural. &quot;Good afternoon my bold young lady. My name is Clarice, but you may call me Mistress. I hope you are prepared to keep me entertained for a good while, my dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brendon was about to drop the bags and run for it when Clarice waved her hand and the door shut tight, with an audible clunk sound as it locked itself. Being an old door, it was a 1 sided lock, meaning that it was impossible to open from the otherside a.k.a. inside the shack. Brendon was now trapped inside unless he jumped through the single large stained glass window. However Clarice put a stop to that immediatly by standing up and moving over to infront of it, blocking his escape. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please let me go. Or at least tell me what do you want from me, although you should know that I don&#39;t have any money or anything like that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please little girl, if I wanted your money I could have just made you want to give it to me. But I don&#39;t find robbing young women of their cash very amusing. No, I would rather play pranks on them or mess with them, corrupt them, or even train them to be whatever I wish them to become. For you my dear, I was thinking of making you my dress up doll for starters, but I believe that after today, we will be spending a lot of quality girl time together at my home. I think in the end, you will become a lovely head maid and maybe even find yourself a loving husband or something. What do you think young lady?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I think? I think you are nuts. And stop calling me a girl. Clearly I am not one.&quot; Argued back Brendon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Do men typically carry around bags of sexy women&#39;s clothing to a secret stash of more sexy women&#39;s clothes? In my opinion, only a young lady would do something like that. By the way, what issss your name GIRL?&quot; Clarice asked, really emphasizing the last part.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brandon&quot; Brandon said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Eww, no. From now on your name is Brie. OK, try again young lady. Tell me your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You can&#39;t just rename me you crazy woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I? Tell me again, what was your name, young lady?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its Brie! God! Wait what? No, it Brie. My name is Brie. Brendon issssn&#39;t my name... What the hell did you do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing, Brie. Why did you want me to do something to you? I haven&#39;t had a young lady as my target for quite some time.&quot; Clarice joked, feigning ignorance about doing anything to Brie.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name, you changed it. Please, change it back. My name is Brie, no Brianna, what? Fuck.&quot; Brie struggled to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl! Aw whose a good girl!&quot; mocked Clarice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, I am not a dog. Why are you doing this?&quot; begged Brie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly because I am bored as fuck. But also because you are such an interesting human Brie. A girl, who is in a man&#39;s body, who also thinks like a man, acts like one too. But has a desire for pretty clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what, are you saying I&#39;m trans or something? Because I am not, I assure you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no. I understand that point completely. You have been a lesbian since birth Brie. Now then, lets play a game. I want you to come here at least once a week wearing one of these outfits by the time you enter. And while inside of this shack, you are Brie, a young lady, who is also my dress-up doll, for now. If you can do this until I am satisfied, which for starters, lets make it a year at minimum, then as a reward, I will grant you any single wish you desire, within my power at least. If you miss a week however, one part of you becomes Brie, permanently. Also comming here more than once a week doesn&#39;t cover for another week. It can be any day too. And lets make a week, begin on Sunday and end on saturday for simplicity. That way you could spend the night and cover for both weeks. Oh, and for a session to count, you muat stay for at least 3 hours per day. Now then Brie, since today is day one, lets get you properly dressed, and don&#39;t worry sweetie, my magic can help fill you out so that these form fitting dresses hug your every curve.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brie felt an odd draft flow over his body as various parts of him shifted about. But the moment 2 breast like mounds pushed out of his chest did he finally understand how bad he could have become if she was a cruel witch instead of some crazy one who was simply bored. She could easily kill him, or just make him a girl amd force him to act like one for the rest of his life. &quot;At least she was willing to keep this between ourselves.&quot; Thought Brie as he removed the last of his male clothes and began slipping on a lacy black thong.</p>
