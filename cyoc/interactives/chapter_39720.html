<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Matt and Cole separated, obviously Matt was furious. His brother was such a pain in <br />
the ass... he was so small, weak, and a big wimp. <br />
<br />
He lied down on his bed, sighing. He really felt like masturbating, but for some reason he <br />
just couldn't get his boner up. He remembered that he carried around some viagra in his <br />
bag. Obviously he didn't need it most of the time, but sometimes it added in a little fun <br />
for him.<br />
<br />
He reached into his bag and fished around for one of the packets he kept the viagra in. <br />
Eventually he found one -- well, he found what he believed to be his viagra. Instead, it was <br />
that strange pill he found earlier -- but Matt had no idea.<br />
<br />
He opened the packet and dry swallowed the pill. Immediately, he felt his cock tent up in <br />
his pants. &quot;Oh yeah, the big boy is coming up now...&quot; He said, stroking his cock through <br />
his pants.<br />
<br />
His desire exploded suddenly, and he just pulled down his pants, his fat cock flopping <br />
about. He was quite well endowed already -- seven and a half inches long, and quite thick <br />
around.<br />
<br />
Growling, he wrapped his big meaty hand around his manhood and began pumping it up <br />
and down. &quot;God, I'm so hot... my cock is so big, too...&quot; He moaned, talking to himself <br />
while he masturbated.<br />
<br />
He was surprised when his cock suddenly exploded -- usually he could last longer than <br />
that, but apparently not. &quot;Ah, fuck...&quot; He was pissed that he blew his load so fast.<br />
<br />
But suddenly, he felt an incredibly hot tingling sensation crawling all over his body. It felt <br />
strange, but fantastic. Maybe it was a new effect from the pill?<br />
<br />
Matt wasn't sure why, but he started to feel like his clothing was much tighter than before. <br />
His shirt looked like spandex now, and his pants were squeezing his big legs very tightly. <br />
Little did he know, but he just grew. <br />
<br />
Matt was too absorbed with himself and his horniness to realize. He saw his cock become <br />
rock hard yet again, and grinned. &quot;Ah, good.&quot; This new viagra felt fucking fantastic.<br />
<br />
He could've sworn that his hands and cock looked bigger, but he was too busy <br />
masturbating to notice it at the moment. <br />
<br />
Grunting and moaning in his even deeper voice, once again Matt reached his climax within <br />
a few seconds. This time, he heard his shirt rip, and his pants were so tight he felt like <br />
they were going to rip, too. &quot;What the fuck is happening?&quot; He decided to peer into his bag. <br />
He saw that all six of his viagra pills still remained. He must have taken that strange pill <br />
he found earlier by accident. &quot;Shit...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This is awesome.&quot; He was too much of a musclehead to realize that masturbation lead to <br />
his growth, but since he was so incredibly horny it didn't matter anyway. He stood up and <br />
kicked his pants off, as well as pulled his torn shirt off. He was just in his boxers now that <br />
were incredibly tight on him.<br />
<br />
Matt looked in the mirror, gasping. He was pretty big and hot before -- but now, he was <br />
beyond that! His cock was at least ten inches now, and his body was so wide that it barely <br />
fit in the mirror that he had used his entire lifetime. He flexed his gigantic biceps and <br />
pecs, grunting the entire time. He could see that his cock was leaking precum everywhere <br />
-- it wanted another go, and he was happy to oblige.<br />
<br />
Just as he wrapped his huge meaty hand around his equally meaty cock, he heard his <br />
brother calling him. His voice sounded sort of deep, but what did he want? <br />
<br />
Matt grinned. He figured he could show off his new hot bod to his brother... he opened his <br />
door and walked out, then walked into Cole's room... only to see his brother was much <br />
bigger than before too and completely naked!<br />
<br />
Both of the brothers looked equally surprised as they stared at each other. Matt was still <br />
bigger than Cole. He flexed his arm and laughed. &quot;I'm still the bigger, hotter one...&quot;</p>
