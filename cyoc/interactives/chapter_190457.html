Rick entered in the parameters. The transformation would take 5 minutes, slow enough that they could examine the changes as they happened but quick enough that it wouldn’t leave Max in a weird in-between stage for too long.<br />
<br />
He’d stay changed for an hour. Pretty long for a first time test, but Max insisted it all be worth his time. Rick knew that once the parameters had been submitted, he couldn’t change them, even if one of them made him regret pressing initiate. This way if Max hated his change, he wouldn’t be trapped too long.<br />
<br />
The animal would be a snake. Specifically, a Smooth Green Snake, small enough to be manageable and an awesome color. Max and Rick had a common interest in their transformation fascination; they wanted to still be intellectually intact insofar as they would remember they were actually human. They liked the idea of getting lost in their animal instincts, but they wanted to be aware that it was happening, understand what they were doing, and be able to resist it if possible. <br />
<br />
Rick couldn’t believe he’d met a straight friend who was into animal transformation like this. Max was always cool about it, ecstatic as he was, even though Rick knew for Max it was less sexual and more fascinating, exhilarating. Rick found the whole thing erotic, taking or losing powers through transforming others or himself into a powerful beast or tame creature. He chuckled to himself as he thought of the erotic implications of turning his straight best friend into an impotent phallic animal, a  harmless little snake to be held in his hand.<br />
<br />
Max heard his friend snicker as he worked on the Chronivac. “You are going to turn me into a bug or something, huh?” <br />
<br />
Rick shook his head, still leaning over the computer. “Not yet. I promise.” He took one last look at the parameters. He left the universe altering options alone, confident that the two of them would be in his home and only in his home. <br />
<br />
“Come on, Rick. It’s gonna be fine.” Max tapped his foot, anxious to finally start his change.<br />
<br />
Rick looked at his impatient friend, Max’s dick wiggling as he shifted back and forth. Soon, his friend wouldn’t be able to stand, much less have arms, a dick and balls, or be able to speak.<br />
<br />
Unceremoniously, Rick pressed SUBMIT on the screen, and a message popped up that the changes were underway. “Transformation complete in 4:59… 58… 57…”<br />
<br />
Rick turned from the computer and just turned to see the changes began. “You’re so impatient! What would you do without me to make sure you didn’t end up a table lamp or something.”<br />
<br />
“Come on! You take this way too seriously! I’ve been waiting for weeks…months to try this out! Let’s start!” Max absentmindedly started itching his leg and arm. Rick watched as all the places he rubbed shed hair to the floor.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure,” Rick teased. “You look like you’re coming down with something.”<br />
<br />
Max started scratching his bare ass. “What the hell are you talking about? I feel fine.” Where Max’s arm rubbed against his side, Rick noticed Max’s skin began to fade and reveal scales.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. You might not be up to a transformation today. You look a bit green to me.” <br />
<br />
Max about opened his mouth to object when he noticed his arm as well. He kept rubbing his arm and realized his skin was being replaced. “Are these scales? You dork! You didn’t tell me it started!” Max’s dick then grew quickly erect. “I’m getting a bit hot. What are you turning me into? A dinosaur?”<br />
<br />
“You’ll see soon,” Rick replied. “But no, it’ll be something much less pre-historic.”<br />
<br />
Max couldn’t stop himself from grabbing his own erection. “Damn, this feels…super good. Sorry, I can’t stop myself…did you turn some kind of pleasure setting on high?” <br />
<br />
Rick looked back at the Chronivac. He did notice there was a “pleasure” setting that was on. “Yeah, I just though it meant it wouldn’t be painful. I guess it make you really…”<br />
<br />
Just then, Max spurted a massive load from his cock. Some ended up on the floor, but some went far enough to hit Rick’s foot. <br />
<br />
“…horny. Damn, Max.” Rick wiped the cum from his foot. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, it just happened,” Max replied. He continued to feel his body as more and more scales appeared on his torso and legs.<br />
<br />
Rick noticed as his friend’s junk began to shrink. Max didn’t seem to notice as his balls deflated, seemingly emptied of all human DNA. His pole began to shrink as well, disappearing in a new vent that would house his snake genitals. <br />
<br />
While his head seemed mostly unchanged, Max’s legs were shrinking as a tail began to appear above his ass. It grew longer and longer, completely covered in scales, as was his entire body now.<br />
<br />
“My arms and legs are getting so short,” Max noticed. “I guess I better get on the ground. Am I going to be a lizard?”<br />
<br />
“Still nope,” Rick said. “And yes, soon your legs won’t be able to support you standing at all.”<br />
<br />
Max laid instinctually on his belly, his tail so long now, his rear nearly gone and his asshole merging into a cloaca. While his arms and legs grew less relevant, Rick began to observe his friend’s head change. The hair from the top of his head started to rapidly shed. Max wasn’t speaking words as much as he was just moaning pleasurably, his entire skeletal structure rearranging.<br />
<br />
Max’s eyes took on a snake like glow, his face began to flatten out, and his tongue started to spit out like a snake’s. His teeth disappeared, his face becoming scaly, his ears becoming internal organs.<br />
<br />
As his arms and legs finally were gone, Max started to shrink to his final form. If he hadn’t guessed by now what he was going to be, he never would. In the last minute, his cute little nostrils formed at the end of his head, his green scales solidified, his tan underbelly wriggled on the floor, and he settled into his new two-foot long shape.<br />
<br />
“Look at you, Max the snake!” Rick beamed at his changed friend. Max seemed to rouse out of his transformation stupor and start to wriggle around. He got into the groove of slithering, eventually looking up at Rick.<br />
<br />
“Gosh, I wonder what you’re thinking right now. How does it feel to be so small on the floor? Will you let me pick you up?” Rick reached down and picked his tiny friend up easily. He held Max up to his face, and Max responded with tiny tongue flicks Rick could only interpret as friendly.<br />
<br />
Rick looked back at the Chronivac. They had a little under an hour before Max turned back. “I wonder if you are hungry after all that transforming? Maybe you’d like some of these…”<br />
<br />
Rick carried Max to the kitchen and placed him on the counter. He then went into a closet and pulled out some live crickets. “I wanna see if you have any hunting skills.” He shook a cricket onto the counter and it began hopping towards the sink. Max knew exactly what to do, slithering toward the cricket, waiting until it settled down, and then struck at it. First try, he caught the cricket in his mouth and began to chomp on it.<br />
<br />
Rick watched as his friend turned animalistic as he gobbled down his snack, digesting it slowly into his long form. Once Max was done, Rick picked his friend back up. “Let me put on some pants, and I’ll take you outside for you to slither around in the garden.”<br />
<br />
Rick rushed to his room and slipped on some sweats, opting to go commando as usual. He went back to the kitchen and picked up Max to carry him out the back door. Once in the garden, he set the tiny snake down, setting up a chair to just watch as Max roamed a more natural habitat. He watched Max sunbathe a bit, duck into some bushes, attempt to burrow a bit to no avail, all the while periodically looking back at Rick for approval. Rick took out his phone and took pictures of Max to show later.<br />
<br />
Max was loving his new snake form. It wouldn’t have been his first option, but transforming had felt really good and weird. It was so foreign to be a long, slinky creature, but now in the moment it felt so right. Even Rick setting him up with a live cricket felt cool, instinctual. There was also a tinge of humiliation he felt, having orgasmed in front of his friend while turning into a tiny pet. Crawling around on the ground, he realized he had very little power. Rick could make him do anything, though he knew he wouldn’t hurt Max on purpose.<br />
<br />
Rick looked at his watch intently. “Okay bud, it’s about five minutes until you turn back. Let’s get you inside.”<br />
<br />
Max had a plan, though. He slithered toward a his friend as if he was getting ready to be picked up. As Rick bent over to grab his friend, Max dashed up Rick’s pant leg, wrapping his body deftly around Rick’s ankle and crawling up.<br />
<br />
Rick would have stepped back in shock if it wasn’t for the fact he didn’t want to hurt his fragile little friend. He felt the cold scales of Max’s body slide up his leg and into the crotch of his pants. “What the heck are you doing?”<br />
<br />
Max knew that Rick would hate this, but he found it so funny. He made sure to cover as much of his leg area as possible as he slithered up to freak out his friend. He then poked his head directly into Rick’s dickhead. Max snickered in his mind, and then used his tongue to tickle Rick’s urethra.<br />
<br />
Rick began to jump. “Max, what the fuck!” He wanted to grab at his pants crotch and get Max to stop, but he didn’t want to hurt his friend! He also couldn’t just pull down his pants in the backyard for his neighbors to see a snake getting ready to bite his dick off.<br />
<br />
Carefully, he began shambling towards the back door of his house. Once inside, he pulled down his pants to find his snaky friend beginning to tease him.<br />
<br />
“Max, stop!” Rick said spreading his legs. “That tickles!” Despite his best efforts, his dick started getting hard. Once it was slightly erect, Max the snake slithered up and around it, wrapping himself once and using the perch to angle himself under Rick’s taint. He tickled Rick’s undercarriage jokingly. Rick was all the while embarrassed and trying to figure out a way to nicely remove Max from his leg and dick.<br />
<br />
He looked towards the Chronivac and noticed that Max’s time was up in nearly ten seconds. Rick decided to just let it go, as Max would be turning back soon. <br />
<br />
Max tightened his final wrap-around Rick’s cock. Just as the transformation started, Max started to feel a bit itchy. He knew his time was up. He started to slink down Rick’s other leg and back to the floor where his transformation began.<br />
<br />
Rick watched as his friend started to grow in size. This time, his scales started to shed and disappear. His eyes started to become more human, his tail shortening as his legs and arms started to sprout by his sides.<br />
<br />
His head began changing back quickly, as his ears, nose, and mouth grew on his original head. His hair sprouted back as well, ensuring he wouldn’t be left bald from this experience. As he grew back to normal size, his arms and legs reappeared as normal, his tail fading behind his reformed butt. His holes had diverged and Rick saw as Max’s asshole returned. <br />
<br />
Still on his belly, Max had regained the ability to vocalize. “Woahhhh.” He said at last. Once his normal spine was back, he rolled over to his back, just in time for Rick to see Max’s vent sprout his normal human cock, as well as his ballsack reforming and growing to its normal size. His body hair returned, and while his cock was hard, Max ignored it, opting to feel his body all over. <br />
<br />
Finally back to normal, Max looked up at Rick. “That was intense, from beginning to end, dude.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck, it looked like it, you little horn dog,” Rick said, gesturing to Max’s erection. “You seem to have a new fascination for cock since transforming.”<br />
<br />
Max chuckled. “I was just teasing you, dude. I knew you wouldn’t try to hurt me or anything. Come on, admit it was funny.”<br />
<br />
“I though you were gonna bite my dick off at first,” Rick replied. “I swear, I thought it’d be fun to see you as a cute little snake, but it wasn’t so you could do that. A bit taboo you think?”<br />
<br />
Max slowly sat up off the ground. “Relax, dude. I wasn’t gonna do anything insane. Just wanted to have you by the balls. Now you’re even with me: you saw me ejacualate my entire sperm collection out and now I know that you get turned on by snakes crawling up your legs.”<br />
<br />
“It tickled!” Rick retorted.<br />
<br />
“Help me up,” Max said. “I hope my legs still work!” <br />
<br />
Rick hoisted Max back into the land of the walking. They looked at the mess of hair, sperm, and scales on the ground. “I guess I’ll get a broom,” Max said. “Hey! I wanna see those pictures you took of me.”<br />
<br />
As Max swept the floor, Rick flipped through the pictures of the Smooth Green Snake that was his friend moments before. He showed Max his favorites before forwarding them all in an email.<br />
<br />
“It was a good choice,” Max said, dumping the dust pan. “Cute even. But it won’t be as cute as I’m gonna make you.”</p>
