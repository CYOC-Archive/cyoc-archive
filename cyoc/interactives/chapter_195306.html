<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ollie groaned and finally gave up trying to sleep. He rolled over to grab his phone, but stopped when his head caught on his pillow. Or rather, something on his head caught on his pillow. He reached up and felt a bony protrusion coming from the side of his skull, towards the back. <i>No wonder he hadn&#39;t been able to get comfortable all night.</i> He sat up in bed and grabbed his phone. <b>5:56 AM</b> flashed at him in the dark. He glanced over to Barton&#39;s bed but found it empty. His roommate must have spent the night with his latest conquest.<br />
<br />
It was too dark to really see anything so he threw off the covers and climbed out of bed. He walked to the light switch as he idly scratched at his balls, though paused. <i>Did they seem bigger?</i> Once the light was on he was able to get a better look. <i>They were definitely bigger</i>. Ollie nodded appreciatively, admiring how they hung low under his morning wood. He always slept in the nude, even if it made him horny. His fingers touched his burgeoning horns. He was horny in more ways than one now.<br />
<br />
The horns weren&#39;t in the easiest place to see in the front-facing camera of his phone. He tried taking some pictures, but without being able to see they ended up being blurry or out of frame. He&#39;d have to ask Curtis to take a better picture, at least until their daily session with Milo later that afternoon. His dick pulsed at the thought of Curtis. He typed out a quick message.<br />
<br />
<i>&#39;Hey, you up?&#39;</i><br />
<br />
While he waited he fondled himself a bit, leaning forward to get a better view of his growing testicles. He wondered how big they&#39;d get. He wondered how it would feel to have Curtis&#39; tongue lap at them. He wondered how long he should wait before making a move on his dog. <i>His dog.</i> He liked that. It had hardly been two days since their first kiss, but everything just felt so natural. Would Curtis be cool with making things official? The way his tail wagged every time they touched? <i>Fuck, why couldn&#39;t they have been roommates like Milo and Dare or Todd and Sam?</i><br />
<br />
He checked his phone again. The message was delivered but not read. Curtis was probably still asleep.<br />
<br />
<i>Might as well go for a morning run.</i> He&#39;d grown larger in the last couple of days and stood taller than Curtis now, but he seemed to be developing a belly in addition to his growing muscles. He had always been slim and fit, and even though he knew it was probably a part of the changes it bothered him, though he would never admit it out loud. Especially not around his friends, who had their own problems to deal with.<br />
<br />
<i>Definitely morning run. After coffee.</i><br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Ollie&#39;s breath puffed in front of him as he ran. It was still pretty chilly out, but his thickening hair <i>fur</i> kept him warm as his shoes pounded against the outdoor track at the student athletic center. His heart pounded in his chest, though whether due to his nerves or the caffeine he wasn&#39;t sure.<br />
<br />
Running always helped to calm his mind. It&#39;s actually why he wanted to go into Sports Medicine. Having a physical outlet always helped him to process things, and his desire to help others as they helped themselves was very appealing. <i>Healthy Body, Healthier Mind.</i> Plus, it gave him some time to himself, since running isn&#39;t exactly the type of activity you do to have deep conversations. As much of a social facilitator as he was, he hated verbalizing how he truly felt. Much easier to confront alone. Safer, too.<br />
<br />
Honestly? He felt conflicted. Despite his outward appearance--calm, cool, collected--the last few days had been a <i>lot</i>. Everything was changing, even if most of it was for the better. Hell, it was obvious. <i>Milo was sure coming into his own, Sam was going to be gorgeous once he finished changing, Todd was really coming out of his shell, and even Dare was coming around. Not to mention Curt.</i> His beating heart quickened. <i>God, that boy was cute.</i> His excitement after his first music class had been infectious as his eyes glittered and his tail spun in happy circles. He couldn&#39;t keep himself off of him and they spent a good portion of the night making out.<br />
<br />
<i>Yeah. I think it&#39;s time to ask him to be my boyfriend. I just hope he still likes me once I&#39;m done changing.</i><br />
<br />
Ollie pushed himself harder, determined to burn off his stomach. He wanted to be fit and attractive, even under all of his future wool. He continued to run as foreign thoughts snuck into his mind.<br />
<br />
<i>Run all you want, it&#39;s in your genes. Everyone in your family&#39;s always been a bit heavy-set. It&#39;s out of your control.</i><br />
<br />
<b>NOPE!</b> He shoved that thought aside. He knew his parents and older brothers were all fit--they ran marathons together as a family. Ollie was stubborn, and he loved his current family. If that changed he wasn&#39;t sure what he&#39;d do, or if he could even handle it. Life was about bringing people together, not tearing them apart. And if that caused issues with his physicality as well? No. He&#39;d butt that away in an instant. Isn&#39;t that what horns are for?<br />
<br />
The sun was out completely now, and he&#39;d been running for at least an hour. Curtis might be up, and he wanted to see him before class--Concepts in Health and Fitness. He finished his lap and grabbed his bag. The earlier message was still in Delivered status. <i>Perfect. Time to grab another coffee. And a Chai for His Dog.</i><br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
&quot;Another one, Ollie? Already? I know you get a discount but don&#39;t give yourself a heart attack!&quot; The civet barista joked as she handed over the drinks and breakfast sandwiches. He knew her name without having to look at her nametag: Prisha.<br />
<br />
&quot;This one&#39;s to get me through class!&quot; Ollie laughed, &quot;Plus I wanted to surprise Curtis with some breakfast. How much longer are you workin today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m almost done. Oh, that reminds me. Would you be willing to cover my shift on Friday morning? I&#39;ve got a test.&quot; She made a face as she worked on the next order.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez. Already? It&#39;s the first week!&quot; Ollie shook his head with a laugh. But he didn&#39;t have anything that morning and Curtis had class anyway. &quot;Sure. But you owe me.&quot; He winked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the best, Ollie. Thank you so much!&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until he was knocking on Curtis&#39; door that he realized the strangeness of the conversation. <i>Cover her shift? He didn&#39;t work at Bushytail Coffee, did he?</i> And yet he could remember his interview so clearly, though the timing didn&#39;t make sense at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ollie!&quot; Curtis pulled him into a deep kiss the second he opened the door. Ollie loved the way the dog&#39;s longer tongue brushed against his own. It was almost enough to distract him from his thoughts. Almost.<br />
<br />
<i>I never applied to work a the coffee shop. I didn&#39;t get here until the day before Orientation. That&#39;s impossible.</i><br />
<br />
Curtis was tilting his head and looking concerned. &quot;Olls, is everything OK? Did something happen?&quot; The way his ears drooped as he searched Ollie&#39;s face brought everything back into focus.<br />
<br />
<i>I&#39;ll deal with it later. Curtis has enough to deal with without worrying about me.</i> He shook his head and blinked, banishing the conversation at the coffee shop from his mind. He smiled and gave Curtis&#39; darkening nose a quick peck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope! Everythin&#39;s great! Hey! Check out my new horns!&quot;</p>
