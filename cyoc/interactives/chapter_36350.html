<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It's the girl from the forest, the one who inflated you from a normal person into a hulking, scaly monster. You step forward in awe, intending to thank her, but suddenly there is a bang from behind you. You spin around as fast as your bulk allows, and you see that a swollen soldier has broken a hole in the corridor wall. He is pig-like, like the guard on the watch-tower, but he is not as badly bloated, his shirt has ripped off to reveal his rough, pink, slightly hairy, and muscular chest, but his legs are less blown up, his trousers still fitting, albeit torn slightly near his massive trotters, and straining a lot, with a seam burst near the top. With a grunt he sees you and charges forwards. You leap out of the way, but the bulked-up soldiers mass is too great for him to stop and he smashes into the tank, cracking it and knocking himself out. As he slumps, you notice a pink, curly tail poking from his large rear. The liquid drains from the tank, and the woman steps out. But as you step forward, she shimmers and changes into a young man, dressed in a strange, grey, tight-fitting suit, with dark hair. &quot;What?&quot; you cry. &quot;I thought you were female!&quot;. He floats up into the air a few feet and looks down at you. &quot;Well, no. I had to find some way to get you to come close.&quot;. He looks pretty embarrassed and you snigger. &quot;Don't you dare laugh!&quot;, he yells at you, and instantly your muscles seize up, trapping you. He waves a hand and the ceiling vanishes, revealing the blue sky. &quot;Wait!&quot; you yell, but he flies out, leaving a blue trail behind him. Your muscles relax, and you can move again, but the man has gone. You hear another noise from the corridor, and see the two transformed soldiers have broken free and are chasing you. You turn around, and see a heavy blast door, behind the glass tank. You easily wrench it away, and see a hanger full of planes. You try to scramble into one, but your massive, bulky body won't fit. But then you see a jet without a cockpit. Curious, you climb in the back. You see a touch-screen on the wall, and realize the plane must be automated. A radar on the monitor shows a blip. Figuring it to be the man, you select the follow option (no easy feat with your fat, salami-sized fingers) and settle down to enjoy the ride as the door closes. The plane, which would have been more than enough for six normal men, is cramped to your swollen, hulking body, and you are glad when the screen flashes that the target has stopped and the plane is searching for somewhere to land. Soon, you squeeze out of the jet, and look around you.<br />
You are on a tropical island. The palm trees sway, and the nearby beach is white. But there are people here, the metal building in the distance and the concrete platform you landed on is evidence of that. You suddenly feel very warm. The tropical sun beats down on you, and you realize that as you are a lizard, the environment must be perfect for you. But suddenly, your body begins to react. You hold out a scaly arm, and the muscles swell out even further. You look down, and see your pectoral muscles punch out, puffing up in front of your face until you can't look down. The gaps between your abs and pecs have become canyons, your chest muscles bulging out even further. With a sound of creaking bones, you begin to hunch over, grunting as your head pushes out into a horizontal position. Your head is now horizontal, your bulky chest facing diagonal allowing you to look around freely. You feel great, and you lumber off towards the metal building.<br />
20 minutes later, you push open the doors of the building, leaving some transformed guards writhing face down on their hulking chests. The man is standing at a massive indoor lake, hovering over it. He turns, and sees you. &quot;Not you again!&quot; he groans. &quot;I'm beginning to regret using you as my first test subject.&quot;. He waves a hand, and suddenly you see your chest forcing it's way outwards, your limbs swelling up too. Soon you are lying on the ground, not able to move a inch of your heavy, incredibly overmuscled body. You can't even see over the hills that were once your pectorals. &quot;Much better&quot;, the man exclaims. You feel heat rising in you over your fate, and have a idea. &quot;Now, if I leave you here, the scientists can-&quot;. He doesn't get any further, as with a mighty effort you burp the muscle gas back at him. It smacks him in the face even as you deflate back to the bulk you inflated into in the sun's rays. He instantly explodes outwards with muscle, clothes ripping open, and he falls to the ground, nto able to hold his bulk hovering. His skin has become grey and leathery, and even as you watch a horn bursts from his face. He is a rhino mutant. But with a tremendous effort, he squeezes his body back into normal size. Shaking his fist, he smashes through the ceiling and out towards a mountain in the distance. You heart sinks. You could never climb it, even with your powers. But suddenly a force draws you to the man-made lake.<br />
You bend your massive body down and begin to drink. The liquid fills your stomach, and then suddenly seems to be sucked away. You drink again, and again, and then turn around. With a shock you see your rump has become incredibly swollen. It is the size of three lorries, and looks like a scaly balloon attached to your chest and legs. You turn back to the lake and take another gulp. At the far end of the room you see a screen. It shows a view of you, and as you drink the water flows into your chest, then into your leg muscles, which expand. The drink again and again, your legs fattening up, becoming bigger than tree trunks, then bigger than buses. Then your arms bloat up. Turning to them you see your massive biceps, bigger than it is possible for a man, veins bulging out that are bigger than water pipes. You rest on your stomach to avoid being pulled away, even as your hands inflate, palms like cars, fingers swelling to the size of a dining table, all chance of any delicate work you had vanishing as your hands become heavy, clumsy and monstrous. Then, your chest begins to bulk up. You begin to rise off the ground, pectorals becoming bigger than caravans, abdominal muscles becoming big as melons, then bigger than tables. You feel the concrete walls pressing against your back and rear. You gulp even more, gasping at the pressure. Suddenly the walls and ceiling crack open with a sound like thunder. Your house-sized chest finally pushes your head away, and you realize you have drained the lake. You rise to your caravan-sized feet, and with a thrill of horror realize your head is too small for your massive body. You can't see over your bulk. But even as you think that you feel gas from drinking to fast in your stomach, and you burp it up. But is does not come out. Suddenly you feel very light headed. You close your eyes and hear a snapping sound. When you open your eyes again your head is now the same scale as your body, and then your body hunches over again, giving you a better view. Thankfully your bones have expanded too. You look down at your huge, hulking, reptilian body, big as three houses stacked on top of each other (and as wide too) and give a triumphant roar. You could now take on anything!</p>
