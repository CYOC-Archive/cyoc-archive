<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Curtis was starving as he walked quickly back to the dorms. He was excited to see Ollie after such a productive day and grabbed some food on his way (a bean burger for Ollie and a cheeseburger for himself), which he carried in a bag in his mouth since his hands were full with his keyboard and equipment. Class had gone well and he had gotten some good advice from Bergling: don&#39;t try to force inspiration, but don&#39;t give up--<i>an imperfect something is better than a perfect nothing.</i> That last part would be the hardest, but he was willing to try.<br />
<br />
His mood had also been bolstered at the prospect of potentially being able to move in with his sheep. He already had plans to push the beds together. Based on his conversations with Bethany as they stumbled through their scene, she had already made the decision. The hang-up was which dorm to transfer to. Hopefully she&#39;d make her decision soon, because Curtis was already impatient at the possibilities.<br />
<br />
Ollie had given Curtis a copy of his key based on the last few nights, so he dropped off his stuff in his room before crossing the hall and letting himself in. The sheep was bustling around the room but turned to look as the door opened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Curt! How were yer classes?&quot; He grinned and rushed over as the dog took the bag from his mouth. The sheep was clearly excited about something as they kissed and closed the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eventful! You&#39;ll never guess who I met today in Drama.&quot; Curtis couldn&#39;t help but smirk.<br />
<br />
Ollie looked him over and cocked an eye, &quot;Who?&quot;<br />
<br />
Curtis jerked his head in the direction of the empty bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Barton&#39;s in yer class? Did you ask him where he&#39;s been?&quot; Ollie chuckled and shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>She</i> goes by Bethany now.&quot; Curtis grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way! Seriously?&quot; Ollie&#39;s eyes went wide, &quot;Is it the Valley or..?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. She&#39;s turning into a mink, and I can only assume. I didn&#39;t know how to ask. But! She&#39;s planning to switch dorms so I was thinking I could ask about switching rooms. If you&#39;re OK with that, I mean. It&#39;d be nice to not have to always cross the hall...&quot; Ollie didn&#39;t look as excited as Curtis expected him to at the news. In fact, the revelation seemed to actively bother him. &quot;...Unless you don&#39;t want me to?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Panic on the brain, world has gone insane<br />
Things are starting to get heavy, mm</i><br />
<br />
The sheep nodded and pulled Curtis into a hug. &quot;I would love that, but I actually wanted to talk to you about somethin.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>I can&#39;t help but think I haven&#39;t felt this way<br />
Since I asked you to go steady</i><br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Curtis felt his ears droop.<br />
<br />
Ollie kissed Curtis&#39; nose and pulled him to the bed so they could sit down next to each other. After everything that had happened over the last couple of days, the dog was beginning to worry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promised to be more open so I&#39;m gonna. I met with Professor Oakton today,&quot; Ollie began tentatively, &quot;He&#39;s been studyin the Valley and everythin that&#39;s goin on, though even he admits to not fully understandin how it all works. Apparently he&#39;s been real busy this week due to the change over period, so I wasn&#39;t able to talk too much about what was happenin to me specifically. But he was able to tell me some of his theories.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curtis felt a little better, but there was something about the way the sheep was talking that gave him pause, &quot;OK? Did that help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Ollie continued, &quot;Yes and no. But. Apparently the Valley isn&#39;t the only cross-over point. There are more, like a Ski Resort in Utah or a Correctional Facility in Arizona. There&#39;s also a camp nearby. And they have different cross-over periods aside from the three months here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; Curtis tilted his head as a knot formed in his stomach.<br />
<br />
<i>Or is this the way it ends?</i><br />
<br />
Ollie sighed and reached up to pet Curtis&#39; ear as he thought for a moment. &quot;Puppy, I can&#39;t do this. I can tell that things are startin to change in my head and I&#39;m not willin to forget my family. I know the sheep parents popping up in my memories aren&#39;t real, but they&#39;re gettin stronger and stronger and I can&#39;t let things go all the way. My little sister called today. <i>I don&#39;t have a little sister.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Bring down my level of concern<br />
Just need you to tell me we&#39;re alright, tell me we&#39;re okay, yeah</i><br />
<br />
Curtis felt his eyes beginning to water as the weight of possibility was settling directly on his heart, &quot;You&#39;re going to leave?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>&#39;Cause I told you my level of concern</i><br />
<br />
Ollie simply nodded as his eyes danced across the dog&#39;s expression. &quot;Oakton said the camp was dangerous, so I&#39;m gonna take the bus tomorrow night to the Ski Resort. I got paid today and I need to try at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>I don&#39;t really care what they would say<br />
I&#39;m asking you to stay</i><br />
<br />
The brunt of Ollie&#39;s decision came crashing down on Curtis&#39; head as he sat there stunned. He had never expected this as a potential possibility and...<br />
<br />
&quot;Curtis, will you come with me? I&#39;ll even buy yer ticket.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dog felt his stomach drop at the idea. He felt sick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ollie...I don&#39;t know. I...&quot; His heart was racing. &quot;What would even happen? What if we change faster? Do you even know if we can leave through the Ski Resort? What about our friends? What about my family?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ollie took Curtis&#39; paws into his hooves, &quot;I don&#39;t know. But the guys will be fine. And what family are you talkin about? Yer real family is on the other side, Curtis. I don&#39;t wanna forget you. I need you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Need you now<br />
I need you now</i><br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d forget me?&quot; Curtis was surprised to feel even worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not on purpose! Puppy. I could never forget you, but what do you think happens to our families?&quot; Ollie was insistent, &quot;Oakton said that people who leave don&#39;t remember this place. If you come with me we&#39;ll still be together. What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ollie, this is too much. I need to think. It&#39;s so sudden. Classes just started.&quot; Curtis whimpered at the impossible choice he suddenly faced: give up his new life or give up his sheep? And either decision would have to be absolute with no middle ground whatsoever. He&#39;d only just started to come into his own and to have it suddenly yanked away from him like this? What the actual fuck?<br />
<br />
The sheep nodded and leaned forward to kiss the dog. &quot;I know that what I&#39;m asking isn&#39;t fair. Think about it, please?&quot; He looked like he regretted asking. &quot;Hey, Shro says there&#39;s a party goin on down the street tonight. Let&#39;s go and drink a bit and dance, OK? Maybe that will help you take yer mind off of things for a bit.&quot; He smiled sadly and ran his fingers across the top of Curtis&#39; nose, &quot;The fur on yer muzzle is comin in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Curtis sighed but didn&#39;t feel better as he nodded in a daze. He definitely wasn&#39;t hungry any more. He wanted to throw up and wished everything were different.<br />
<br />
<i>In a world, where you could just lie to me<br />
And I&#39;d be okay, we&#39;ll be okay<br />
(My level of concern) we&#39;re gonna be okay<br />
(Just need you to tell me we&#39;re alright, tell me we&#39;re okay)<br />
(I need you)</i></p>
