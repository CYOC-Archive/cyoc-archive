<br />
Samantha and I were walking to the infirmary to talk with one of the soldiers who would be brought back. It had been a heated argument in council. We couldn't decide on whether or not to bring them back. Samantha and Jack were in the chamber while we were arguing this. I was surprised when Samantha had spoken up and said she might have a solution. Her solution was to bring them back but too young to fight.<br />
Jack had then suggested that their gender could be changed also.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like to thank you again for your suggestion&quot; I said as we walked. &quot;It seems like the best choice right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just thought that it's better than leaving them dead&quot; Samantha said. &quot;Or bringing them back and holding them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We really don't have anywhere to hold them anyway&quot; I said. &quot;Though this could blow-up in our faces.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it could&quot; Samantha said. &quot;They're at your mercy as to whether or not you'll turn them back. They'll resent you for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully we can convince them that we will change them back if they want to&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well maybe if this first one can be convinced it will be easier to convince others&quot; Samantha said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we'll see&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
When we arrived at the infirmary we were directed to the area where those that will also change gender as well are kept. In this area we saw an eight year old girl looking in a mirror. Standing next to her was Dianne. She smiled and waved at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Dianne&quot; I said. &quot;I take it that this is the soldier you brought back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is&quot; Dianne said. &quot;I'm glad I found one of the crystals a few days after Mama brought me back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know&quot; I said. &quot;Who is she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pfc Anthony Martines&quot; Dianne said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Snakehead, is that really you?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it's me&quot; Anthony said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're cute&quot; Samantha said. &quot;I wonder if you can still expand your neck like a cobra's hood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've tried&quot; Anthony said. &quot;I can't seem to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should be able to do it again when you're older&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're going to change me back right?&quot; Anthony asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not right now&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't have the right to do this&quot; Anthony said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was the best solution&quot; Samantha said. &quot;Please try to understand their position. They wanted to bring you back but they didn't want to hold someone against their will. They couldn't just let someone go just to have them come back later. I suggested that you be regressed so you couldn't fight. Jack had suggested changing you're gender also.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We left the gender transformation to the one bringing you back&quot; I said. &quot;Dianne has always said that everyone should experience the opposite gender.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is different&quot; Anthony said. &quot;Though I think that I may be starting to like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to being a female&quot; Dianne said. &quot;Now we need to get you back to your unit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're never going to believe that you brought me back to life&quot; Anthony said. &quot;They'll think that you captured me and transformed me because you could.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a sense that is what we did&quot; I said. &quot;We captured you when you were killed. We brought you back because we could. We changed you because we could. We do have our reasons for changing you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that you do&quot; Anthony said. &quot;I didn't like what was happening. I signed up to fight this country's real enemies. Not American citizens who happened to be different. My cousin is Bonded and I don't like being on the opposite side as her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want you can stay here&quot; I said. &quot;Samantha and Jack are already staying here with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then they're traitors&quot; Anthony said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that the British said the same thing about the American men during the Revolutionary War&quot; I said. &quot;Though they were fighting for what they believed to be right. Jack and Samantha believe that the government is in the wrong here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're saying that I should join you&quot; Anthony said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's your decision to make&quot; I said. &quot;If you want to stay here you can. If you want to go back to your unit you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She needs to go back to her unit&quot; Dianne said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will not force them to do anything&quot; I said. &quot;It's bad enough that we are regressing them to an age where they can't fight and in some cases changing their gender. While I'm sure that they'll be thankful that they're alive, it will more than likely be that they'll be resentful that we changed them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like some time to decide&quot; Anthony said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take what time you need&quot; I said. &quot;Right now you need a new name. You're a girl for now and you need a girl's name. You get to pick your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want my name to be Anna&quot; Anthony said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If your sure on that then we will call you Anna&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure&quot; Anna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; I said. &quot;Go with Dianne so we can get you set up in a residence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Anna said.<br />
<br />
Once they had left Samantha turned to me and said &quot;I take it that my mind won't change much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mind won't change at all&quot; I said. &quot;The crystals don't do any mental changes. If your mind seems to change it will be because you change it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I won't just suddenly start thinking and acting like a twelve year old boy&quot; Samantha said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you want to role play being a twelve year old boy&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I think I'm ready&quot; Samantha said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take off your clothes then&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Samantha quickly stripped. She must really want to be transformed. I saw a few scars on her body when she stripped. A few of them were on her breasts and her crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;My father was a sick pervert&quot; Samantha said. &quot;He started cutting my crotch when I was nine and my breasts when I was thirteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The scars on your breasts will be taken care of but not the ones on your crotch&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;My father did it because I was a girl&quot; Samantha said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't matter&quot; I said. &quot;We had a similar case here not too long ago. Her mother had done the same thing your father did. She too decided to change her gender but it didn't work. The scars were still there. Is that why you had wanted to change your gender?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes&quot; Samantha admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you really want to get rid of those scars I'd suggest that you regress to eight. You can still change gender if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I do like being a girl&quot; Samantha said. &quot;I have wondered what it would be like to be a boy though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At that age there isn't that much of a difference&quot; I said. &quot;The most obvious is you'd have a dick instead of a pussy. Other than that the bodies are pretty much the same. It's just the clothes, societies views, and the genitals that make the difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could I change into a boy for a day or two?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I suppose it wouldn't hurt&quot; I said. &quot;Though understand that I'm making an exception in your case. We want to save our crystals for the dead first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But there are more than enough Bonded to bring back all of the dead&quot; Samantha said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is the only reason why we are granting your request&quot; I said. &quot;In a couple of days we may not be able to grant your request. Think about that. Do you think you can remain as a boy if you want to go back to being a girl. I will tell you that being trapped in the wrong body is no fun. There were times that I thought that I would go crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you have surgery to correct your gender?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn't&quot; I replied. &quot;To me that wasn't natural and I wouldn't be a true female.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha seemed to think for a few moments before finally saying &quot;Change me into an eight year old boy. I think I can handle it if I want to change back to a girl but can't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then&quot; I said as I held my hand open, palm up. &quot;Crystal in hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
It always delighted me when the crystal teleported itself to me. When it did I usually thought about the T.V. show Stargate SG-1. That show could have been closer to the truth then people thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just hold it right?&quot; Samantha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; I replied as I handed her my crystal. Once she had it in her hand I said &quot;Eight, male.&quot;<br />
<br />
The changes started immediately. Samantha lost height as she regressed in age. Her breasts melted away until they were no longer there. Her hips slimmed while her waist widened. Her hair grew down to her mid back which I thought was a bit odd. Her hair wasn't long by any means but it was longer then your typical male hair and here it was getting longer. Her body plumped up a little bit and all the hair she had gained during puberty pulled back into her body. Now she was an eight year old girl and the scars she had were gone. I<br />
couldn't understand why she looked like an eight year old girl. She was suppose to be an eight year old boy. Suddenly her hair started to get shorter until it was a typical boys hair cut. Her face became a bit more like a boys. Then her labia started to droop and become ball sacks. Her dick poked out and moved forward to the correct position. I could see when her balls dropped into her ball sacks. Of course being eight her dick and balls were small and close to her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was weird&quot; Samantha said. &quot;It was like I was full of Novocain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that the transformation would be painful if you weren't numb&quot; I said. &quot;So what should your name be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it will be Sam of course&quot; Samantha said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Sam it is&quot; I said. &quot;You had longer hair when you were an eight year old girl didn't you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was a typical girl so of course I had long hair&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought so&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a question&quot; Sam said. &quot;I didn't start turning into a boy until I was an eight year old girl. I thought that I would be changing gender while I regressed. Why didn't I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; I admitted. &quot;It seems that the crystal will change your age and gender separately. Maybe the order in which it changes you depends on what order you say the age and gender. Like I said the age first so it changed your age first. Then it changed your gender.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can we find out if that's true?&quot; Sam asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we'd have to ask someone in which order they say the age and gender&quot; I said. &quot;I always say the age first. There are those that always say the gender first. Dianne is one of those that say the gender first. I should talk with her and see if Anna had changed gender first.&quot;</p>
