<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two days after the tumultuous group session, Jackie now sat within the conference room awaiting Fukushu&#39;s return.<br />
<br />
While breakthroughs were made with the others, Fukushu remained closed off. That he even talked of his old apprentice Isao was progress, yet Jackie felt that would be as far as it went. When it came to Fukushu, Jackie realized something. This was not where he belonged. The sound of the door opening drew Jackie from her musings as custody staff escorted him inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I here?&quot; Fukushu asked as his restraints were removed. &quot;I would have thought our last conversation would have shown I am not one to open up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a seat,&quot; Jackie asked, taking a breath before looking directly into Fukushu&#39;s eyes. &quot;Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu did as he was asked, sitting across from Jackie as he stared directly at her. The wizard now taking a breath, a somewhat defeated look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s nothing I can do to help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why am I here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I wanted to talk to you,&quot; Jackie stated. &quot;I&#39;m hoping you&#39;ll talk with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine human,&quot; Fukushu grumbled. &quot;Say your peace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jackie sighed. &quot;Although can you please not judge me? I hate it when you look at me with such disdain. I&#39;ve known you most of my life and, yeah we may have been adversaries at one time, but I think we&#39;ve moved past that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you forgotten the time you threatened to shave me bald and called me Swiper?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I was being a bitch okay?!&quot; Jackie exclaimed. &quot;But you were being really nasty to my daughter. I think we both have that in common. We&#39;re very protective of our family. That&#39;s why you&#39;re here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu raised an eyebrow, his posture relaxing slightly as he stared at Jackie curiously. &quot;Explain?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll start from the beginning,&quot; Jackie stated. &quot;Look, obviously something really messed up happened to you as a kid.&quot; Fukushu tensed, his expression souring as he continued to glare at Jackie.<br />
<br />
&quot;And obviously I&#39;d be a fool to keep pushing,&quot; Jackie continued. &quot;There&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to tell me ever. Honestly, sometimes some wounds can&#39;t be healed. They leave scars and they shape us into the person we become. You have your scars, I have mine. And that&#39;s why I think that at this point, what&#39;s best is that you return home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll explain,&quot; Jackie said. &quot;You see the group was designed because those within it are broken, but can be redeemed. The thing is though, you&#39;re not broken. As for redemption, that&#39;s a question only you can answer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting theory,&quot; Fukushu replied. &quot;Tell me how you came to this conclusion?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way you interacted with the others in the group,&quot; Jackie said. &quot;And don&#39;t look at me like you don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about. You may be quiet and standoffish in here, but when you speak, it&#39;s helpful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu raised an eyebrow, unsure of what Jackie meant as the wizard continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trisha,&quot; Jackie continued. &quot;You don&#39;t know her, but after hearing her story, you sympathize with her. You felt sorry for her to the point you offered her a job AND your protection within the kitsune capital. She&#39;s a complete stranger and you reached out to her. If you were as evil and unredeemable as you seem to think you are you wouldn&#39;t have done that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trisha is a kitsune,&quot; Fukushu countered. &quot;And I protect my people from humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that brings me to Misery and May,&quot; Jackie stated. &quot;Two humans you reached out to. You apologized to Misery for the losses she&#39;s had and offered her words of encouragement. You took responsibility for things you had no part of. She&#39;s a human and a wizard. Two things you obviously despise based on personal experience. And then there&#39;s May. You didn&#39;t have to say anything to her but you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you were under the impression you could repair someone no one else could,&quot; Fukushu exclaimed. &quot;If I hadn&#39;t intervened she would have reduced us to ash!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Jackie replied sarcastically. &quot;Misery and myself yeah. Maybe even Trisha, but you? Come on! You forget my daughter was in the kitsune realm during the civil war. She&#39;s dating your nephew! She saw you fight Hinata, you overwhelmed a supposed celestial AFTER tanking a point blank blast from the enemies artillery! Am I supposed to believe that a magical girl has enough power to kill you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s not an ordinary magical girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would take an army of dark magical girls to take your stubborn ass down,&quot; Jackie exclaimed. &quot;And as powerful as May is, let&#39;s be honest, she&#39;s powerful enough to maybe give you a really bad sunburn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Despite my fur wizard, a kitsune can still be sunburned,&quot; Fukushu grumbled. &quot;And I hate sunburns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s besides the point,&quot; Jackie groaned. &quot;The fact of the matter is, May posed no threat to you. You could have easily said nothing and watched May incinerate us all, but you didn&#39;t. Instead, you helped the rest of us help May gain control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what is your theory then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason,&quot; Jackie said. &quot;And to a lesser extent Akira.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you think that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because both of them got hurt during the whole Superior Church fiasco,&quot; Jackie said. &quot;And you feel guilty about it. You feel like you caused their injuries. You feel like the two of them getting hurt was your fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In case you forgot I dueled Akira,&quot; Fukushu growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you weren&#39;t trying to kill him,&quot; Jackie stated. &quot;Same with Natalia MacGregor and the other S.P.E.A.R agents. They were human and simply knocked them out the way. A bit rough yes, but you didn&#39;t kill them. No, you had no intention of killing them, only the Superior Church. That is until Mason showed up and that&#39;s why I think you&#39;re here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu scowled, the kitsune&#39;s fur beginning to bristle at the mention of his nephew.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw the cut on his forehead,&quot; Jackie continued. &quot;It was a small scratch. He could have easily said he ran into a wall or something. I thought he did until I overheard him and Anjelica talking. He&#39;s not angry at you. Mason gets it. He understands that in your own way, as weird as it is, you were trying to protect him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Fukushu replied softly. &quot;But why would you consider my ways weird?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most people don&#39;t start chopping off people&#39;s heads if someone they care about is in trouble,&quot; Jackie said. &quot;But, that&#39;s just you I guess. Even the angels need a sharp sword. My point is this, no one thinks you belong here except yourself. The only reason you&#39;re here is because of guilt. You feel guilty that your actions almost hurt Mason.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu was quiet, he had no answer for Jackie as he simply lowered his gaze to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get it okay,&quot; Jackie stated. &quot;For whatever reason, Mason made an impression. He&#39;s a great kid. He&#39;s funny, likable, humble, he&#39;s hard not to like. The idea of something happening to him...its something unfathomable, especially at your own hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackie now stood, her arms crossed as she stared at Fukushu.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we both know the only reason we&#39;re sitting in this room is because you feel guilty about Mason,&quot; she said. &quot;If I&#39;m wrong, we can continue therapy. If I&#39;m right? I&#39;ll go straight to Director Meyers and tell her it&#39;s time for you to go home. You&#39;re not a danger to your family Fukushu. In fact, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a danger to anyone who would call you friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu was quiet, letting out a sigh before nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps you are right human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Jackie smirked. &quot;When I talk with Director Meyers, I&#39;ll make it look like I&#39;m the screw up not you. Hate to hurt your pride by saying the mighty kitsune general got it wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu chuckled, flashing a grin towards Jackie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be so hard on yourself Fukushu,&quot; Jackie grinned. &quot;As prickly as you are, your heart&#39;s in the right place. Now, let&#39;s get you home.&quot;</p>
