<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jeremy pressed the button to initiate changes he felt a pulse radiate from the remote. Something instinctively in him told him that the remote worked as advertised. He had changed all women, but with the tv off and no representations of women in the room Jeremy didn&#39;t immediately see his changes. Knowing the woman he wanted to be his first view of the new women forms he texted his girlfriend Gloria. <br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
Jeremy: Something weirds happening can you come to my apartment?<br />
Gloria: Yeah something crazy is going on and... I think I&#39;m going crazy, I&#39;ll only be a few minutes<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
Jeremy patiently waited for his girlfriend, and at the buzzer being pressed Jeremy let Gloria in. His mental image of Gloria being the sporty athlete just an inch and a half shorter than himself ingrained as he prepared for whatever she now looks like. The apartment door fully opened as Jeremy looked around eye level he didn&#39;t see anyone. He felt something hug his leg as he heard the voice of a little girl say &quot;Jeremy, thank god you think something else is weird. Every woman around just shrank into a child, but almost no one seemed to notice!&quot; <br />
Jeremy looked down and saw a little girl in what looked like a woman&#39;s jogging gear made in a kid&#39;s size. Jeremy leaned down a bit and patted her head as he said &quot;There there, how about we talk about this inside on the couch.&quot; Jeremy could feel Gloria&#39;s head move up and down. Then the two left for the sofa where they could sit somewhat closer eye to eye.<br />
<br />
Jeremy could see the fear Gloria had as her whole world changed and the nervousness that the world might just randomly change at any moment. Looking at her body though while it was the size of a 6 year old or so a lot of the baby fat that would normally be there wasn&#39;t, and there was the barest hint of a curve in her figure that a 6 year old wouldn&#39;t. It wasn&#39;t very much and anyone who could tell the difference would be an incredible deviant... However Jeremy could tell. <br />
Jeremy said &quot;Well... I was watching some TV, and then when reality changed so did the characters on the screen. Then I did some google searches to figure out what had changed and I figured out a few things.&quot; <br />
Gloria asked &quot;What exactly changed?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well it seems that women stop growing at around 4 to 6 years old, and puberty for women is mostly about allowing the body to become pregnant.&quot;<br />
&quot;But what about all those women who weren&#39;t toddler sized?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well if you get pregnant your body starts developing quickly. You grow taller to about the size of a regular woman along with things like your boobs and hips.&quot;<br />
Gloria curled up her short legs into her arms and said &quot;So I&#39;m small until we fuck?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well small until we fuck, you get pregnant, and then develop enough after eating tons of food to fuel over a decade worth of growth in a few months. Bright side it seems like reality changed, and most people seem to think this is normal. So there&#39;s going to be a lot of conveniences in society for people of your height.&quot; Jeremy coughed and said &quot;I know that I want a kid at some point, but I&#39;d feel more comfortable doing that once we got married.&quot; <br />
more curled up Gloria leaned into Jeremy as she said &quot;Mind if I stayed with you for awhile?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure Gloria. I have some pajamas and toiletries from the last time you slept over... which should&#39;ve also changed.&quot; Jeremy opened the door to his room, went to the dresser, and opened the drawer that he kept Gloria&#39;s things in. Inside he easily found some small underwear without even a bra, a small dress, and a pink kitty onesie. Jeremy gave her something to change into and said &quot;Well... That&#39;s what I&#39;ve got. I&#39;ll go order some pizza.&quot; Gloria nodded and silently went to the bathroom to change. Jeremy was calling the local pizzeria and then heard the shower turn on. By the time Gloria got out she was squeaky clean, and encased in her onesie with the hood on. Seeing Jeremy on the couch laying down she jumped up, and laid next to Jeremy who moved further into the couch to give Gloria a little room.<br />
Jeremy asked &quot;Comfortable?&quot; <br />
&quot;It&#39;s soft and warm... It&#39;s been awhile since I could feel like a little kid again. I just wish I could be big again soon...&quot; she shifted her lower body a little and said &quot;But... it&#39;s a little embarrassing.&quot; <br />
Jeremy hugged Gloria tighter and said &quot;I think it&#39;s only natural your a little embarrassed right now.  However don&#39;t mind me. You&#39;re still a cutie and you aren&#39;t a little girl but a short woman... Also evolution&#39;s different so maybe my sexual preferences changed a little.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ugh! Jeremy! I didn&#39;t want to hear my boyfriend&#39;s suddenly became a pedo while I&#39;m like this!&quot; The buzzer rang.<br />
Jeremy said &quot;Pardon me.&quot; as he picked up and set Gloria to the side so he could get up. <br />
&quot;Could you not manhandle me!&quot; Gloria yelped as Jeremy went to get the pizza. Instead of it being the usual pizza girl it was some guy. Jeremy paid and tipped like usual but he imagined that maybe women who weren&#39;t pregnant or given birth yet would have a harder time doing physical work. Jeremy also noticed Gloria didn&#39;t eat as much pizza leaving them with more leftovers. <br />
<br />
As it got later they started to go to bed, Jeremy helped Gloria to the top of the sink to brush, spit, and rinse. Then as they were going to bed Jeremy was about to change the sofa into a temporary bed, but Gloria tugged on Jeremy&#39;s pajamas and asked &quot;Could I sleep with you tonight?&quot; The little woman&#39;s heart was beating fast and the suspension bridge effect was going hard. She was nervous and afraid a bit. She had some love for her boyfriend Jeremy, and also wanted someone big to help protect her from the much bigger world. They easily fell asleep together, and Jeremy was glad he put the gender changing remote on the top of the dresser where Gloria probably would never look. Well least till he found a better place to hide the thing.</p>
