<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was late by the time Darren had finished his lessons with Yuriko. Bundling up against the cold, the young teen now made his way home with Steph by his side.<br />
<br />
&quot;So any idea what you want for your birthday,&quot; Steph asked. Darren paused, he had been so busy lately he hadn&#39;t realized his 14th birthday was next weekend. &quot;To be honest I hadn&#39;t really thought about it,&quot; he said. &quot;Any ideas Steph?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cake and maybe a movie with friends,&quot; Steph shrugged. &quot;You know I have your favorite recipe in my memory banks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren smiled, he liked that idea. It was simple and would allow him to spend time with those he cared for.  &quot;Sounds good Steph especially if your there.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the two now made their way past a darkened park, Darren braced himself against the cold. He always hated how early it got dark in the winter, not that he liked cold weather anyway. For a moment he thought that maybe as the Catalyst he could just make it so that it was summer all the time but quickly dismissed it. One of the things he began to understand as the Catalyst was that just because you could do anything, doesn&#39;t mean you should.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look there,&quot; Steph said quickly. Darren now glanced over at where the Soul Drive was pointing. There sitting on a bench was a little girl with red hair who couldn&#39;t be more than 8 years old. The girl had a forlorn expression on her her face, like she had been crying. &quot;I think she&#39;s lost,&quot; Steph said in alarm.<br />
<br />
As Steph now made her way towards the child, Darren paused. Something didn&#39;t seem right. He couldn&#39;t quite put his finger on it but he had a feeling something bad was about to happen. &quot;Steph wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steph paused, casting a curious look in Darren&#39;s direction. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something feels, I don&#39;t know, wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Darren,&quot; Steph stated, her wolfish face forming into a frown. &quot;There&#39;s a little girl in trouble. Its in my programming to help any human in distress.&quot; Approaching the child, Steph now stood in front of the girl, trying to get her to make eye contact. &quot;Are you lost little girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann, raised her head, the vampire gazing at Steph with wide eyes. Tilting her head slightly, the vampire gave the Soul Drive a malicious grin.<br />
<br />
STEPH!!!!<br />
<br />
The sound of metal being torn echoed through the park. The vampire girl Ann had punched through Stephs torso, tearing a hole straight through the Soul Drive. Steph glanced at the damage fearfully before turning to Darren, the Soul Drive unable to form words as she collapsed backwards with a large metallic thud.<br />
<br />
Darren charged forward, unleashing as series of spells before unsheathing the Dragons Tongue. The lessons with both Fukushu and Akira kicking in as he now attacked. The vampire girl though was quite agile, ducking and weaving to avoid Darren&#39;s attacks. As the teen now looked to stab her, he was surprised as she lept in the air, delicately landing on his blade.<br />
<br />
Darren gaped, shocked by this. Ann simply tilted her head to the side, curiously studying him before kicking him directly in the face. <br />
<br />
Darren was seeing stars now as he laid sprawled out in the ground. As he tried to gain his bearings, he could see the girl standing above him like some unworthy predator. The girls face was emotionless, her head tilting from side to side, like some wild beast gazing at wounded prey. The girl now hissed, Darren for the first time noticing the set of fangs in her mouth.<br />
<br />
As Ann looked to strike, she was taken by surprise as a figure lept from the darkness  kicking her away. Tumbling away from her quarry the vampire girl growled as she gazed at her attacker.<br />
<br />
Akiras eyes now went wide as he gazed at the girl. Yuriko had tasked him with tailing the Catalyst since the re-emergence of Evan to ensure the boy got home safely. The job was usually quiet and Darren had no idea Akira was following him. Tonight was a different matter entirely as he witnessed Darren and Steph attacked. The attacker though was someone he had not anticipated.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can&#39;t be,&quot; he whispered. Akiras mouth now formed into a snarl, the kitsunes dander standing on end as he now roared.<br />
<br />
&quot;We killed you. WE KILLED YOU!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Akira now roared, unleashing a blast of destructive magical energy that leveled the surrounding trees Ann was standing in front of. As Darren sat up he could see the girl vanish from sight, Akira now standing between them as he screamed. Darren now made his way quickly to Steph, skidding to a stop as he looked at the damaged Soul Drive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Darren,&quot; Steph whimpered, the hole in her chest sparking from internal damage. &quot;Am...am I going to be okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have fixed up in no time Steph,&quot; he replied, squeezing the Soul Drives hand as he gave her a reassuring smile. &quot;Your going to be okay.&quot; As he turned to Akira, he could see the kitsunes breathing was ragged, his eyes wild as he searched the darkness for their attacker. Whatever that girl was Darren wondered if they would be okay too.<br />
<br />
*******************<br />
<br />
Casseus now followed the Boss, the man talking excitedly as they approached the lobby entrance of their base. From what Casseus had gathered, the Boss had decided to send one of his new toys out into the field. Casseus thought it would be Morgan Carlson or even the kumiho. Instead he had decided on the mute vampire Ann.<br />
<br />
Casseus did not know too much about the vampires. They were strong but had refused to the offer to join in his old masters war. From the stories he had heard though, Ann was brutally efficient in her work. As they now entered the area, Casseus could see several guards nervously gazing at the young child standing in the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Ann were you able to get what I asked for,&quot; the Boss asked. Ann stomped her foot once, signaling yes, as she held a small mechanical part in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I have it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann stomped her foot twice for no, the vampire child furrowing her brow as she clutched the small part to her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann,&quot; the Boss said sternly. &quot;Dont make me have to use the remote.&quot; The Boss now held a small remote aloft for the vampire to see. The child grunting in annoyance as she now handed the part to the Boss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that,&quot; Casseus asked as he watched the vampire child walk away. &quot;This,&quot; the Boss said happily. &quot;Is one of the sub processors from one of the Soul Drive units. I asked Ann to get it for me. And if possible to take out the Catalyst or one of his friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If the Catalyst were dead we would have heard,&quot; Casseus stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never expected Ann to be able to kill the Catalyst or his friend&#39;s,&quot; the Boss shrugged. &quot;But this right here makes all the difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Boss now called over one of the Normals soldiers, Casseua watching as he handed the robot part to him. &quot;Get this to our guys in the lab,&quot; he said. &quot;Lets see if our techs and alchemists can replicate the Soul Drive process.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You intend to build a Soul Drive,&quot; Casseus asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I intend to mass produce them,&quot; the Boss replied happily. &quot;Imagine an entire line of Soul Drives loyal to us. I want you to help get this project off the ground Casseus. Gonna need your help if we&#39;re going to build an army.&quot;</p>
