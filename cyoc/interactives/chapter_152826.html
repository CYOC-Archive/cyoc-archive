<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suzy quickly finished her morning routine and walked to Jen&#39;s house. Still, even moving fast, it took her about thirty minutes, all told and including walking. Suzy bit her lip as she turned onto Jen&#39;s street. She knew that it wasn&#39;t her fault: if anything it was that shit hell Kyle, who Suzy was still trying to think of ways to get back at. But still, she hated to think of Jen laying there on her bed in a wet diaper, wondering when Suzy would come to rescue her. <br />
<br />
Rescue her...<br />
<br />
Suzy hadn&#39;t really had the chance to stop and think about this whole situation. It was weird, to be sure. She would never get used to changing her best friend&#39;s diapers. It was disgusting, and she gagged thinking of the ways in which Jen was infantilized my the change. The talking was the worst one, as well as the most frequent. Still, Jen had been a bit of a fair weather friend before this, preferring to hang out with her cheerleading squad instead of a weirdo like Suzy. Now, Jen *needed* her. She felt like her knight in shining armor a bit. She had to admit, she kind of liked being relied upon by Jen. After all, Jen was really quite sweet when she wanted to be. She had the capacity to be kind and funny and...<br />
<br />
And nothing, Suzy told herself. You&#39;re just helping out your friend. Just so happens that the help your friend needs is with some perverted diaper curse.<br />
<br />
By the time Suzy arrived, Jen was all cried out and was patiently waiting. Suzy knocke&quot;.d on Jen&#39;s door and waited until Jen squeaked out a weak &quot;who is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Suzy&quot; she said. She didn&#39;t wait any longer before opening the door to see Jen, dressed in a frilly pink princess outfit, her legs spread open, with a yellow-stained diaper between her legs, and a little cow tail sticking out to the side.<br />
<br />
Jen raised a hand and awkwardly tried to wave. She was clearly struggling to force he hand to move the way she wanted it to, but it looked clumsy and imprecise.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Hi Suzy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen tried her best to force a grin. <br />
<br />
Suzy closed the door behind her, locked it, and walked over to Jen. <br />
.<br />
&quot;Christ, this is bad, Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if you keep wetting the bed?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I, uh, I don&#39;t know.&quot; <br />
<br />
Suzy sighed. She reached down and wrapped her arms around Jen&#39;s torso, tugging her into a hug, feeling her soft, slightly flabby body.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok, Jen. I&#39;ll help you. Don&#39;t worry, ok?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen didn&#39;t expect the hug, but she welcomed it. She, with much effort, lifted up her arms and curled them around Suzy, burying her head in Suzy&#39;s shoulder. feeling her hair rub against her face. She inhaled, getting a whiff of her shampoo. Apricot. It smelled nice. Suzy was right, she would help Jen. In fact, she HAD been helping Jen, with almost no complaints, for weeks. She had put up with every stinky diaper, every bit of toddler babble, every thumb sucking and every pair of my little pony tights. She had ALWAYS been there for Jen, and Jen loved spending time with her. Maybe it was because she was still emotional at wetting the bed, and being unable to even walk. But Jen felt so close to Suzy, and their bodies touching, rubbing against each other in the hug, Jen felt flush. She blushed. What the heck was she feeling? <br />
 <br />
Jen let go of Suzy and looked at her. Suzy gave her a warm smile, and Jen blushed again. Without thinking, she closed her eyes and started to pull closer to Suzy, planting a kiss on her lips. Suzy blinked a few times, and then leaned in herself, closing her eyes as well. But, just as soon as she did that, they shot open and she pushed Jen away, back down onto the bed.<br />
<br />
Now Suzy was blushing too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.. what was that?&quot; Suzy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;.I... don&#39;t know.&quot; Jen responded. she looked away, not wanting to meet Suzy in the eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just kissed me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you do that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I... I don&#39;t know. Because you&#39;re here for me. Because you&#39;ve always been here for me. Because I like you i guess?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t think you liked girls.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Yeah, well, i didn&#39;t think i was gonna wet the bed this morning either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suzy touched her lips, thinking about their kiss. It had felt nice. But then Suzy looked down, and revulsion filled her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jen, I... I like you too, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But right now you&#39;re dressed like a baby, in a wet diaper, and you can&#39;t even walk.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not my fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but it&#39;s just too much. Like, if we&#39;re going to do this, that&#39;s fine, but I&#39;m not going to, erm, you know, be... intimate... while you&#39;re like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen scoffed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then change my diaper, ok?&quot; <br />
<br />
Suzy blinked a few times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, r--right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suzy reached down and undid the tapes on Jen&#39;s diaper. As she pulled away the sides, Jen felt the strength return to her arms. She squirmed out of the princess dress as Suzy pulled the front of the diaper down, revealing Jen&#39;s moist snatch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Up&quot; Suzy commanded.<br />
<br />
But Jen had other ideas. She sat up, grabbing Suzy by the shirt, and pulled her down on top of her, planting a kiss on her lips and shoving her tongue into Suzy&#39;s mouth. She didn&#39;t even care that she was still sitting on a wet diaper. Suzy was bewildered at first, but then closed her eyes and gave into the kiss. Before Suzy knew it, she was aggressively massaging Jen&#39;s breast as Jen fumbled to take off Suzy&#39;s shirt. The two grinned as Suzy reached down and carefully stuck two fingers into Jen&#39;s pussy, twisting them up and down and stimulating Jen&#39;s clit. Jen arched back, squealing with delight. She hadn&#39;t even so much as masturbated since this stupid curse started. Jen&#39;s squels soon turned to gasps as Jen approached orgasm, squirting cum right onto her wet diaper in an ecstasy of pleasure. She panted, glistening with sweat, not even thinking about the wet diaper between her legs or the curse or anything but her still-growing feelings for Suzy. Jen pulled her in for another kiss as two continued to make love.</p>
