<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morgan rubbed her chin as she gazed at the ruins of her shop. It had been more than 80 years since she had set foot in here. Now, covered in a thick layer of dust, the sorceress found little that could be useful. Despite this minor set back she still had a back up plan.<br />
<br />
When the barrier between the timelines had thinned it created a unique opportunity for magic. This was how several Rings of Age as well as Rings of  Change had come into existence. Morgan, at the time, had seized upon this opportunity acquiring a Ring of Change.<br />
<br />
From that point on though, things did not go as planned. Morgan was defeated by Katie, the previous Catalyst, and reduced to infancy. The sorceress was essentially reset, growing up without knowledge of her previous existence until she was nearly grown. Morgan sighed as she remembered those times, how shaken she was at the thought of her villainous nature. At the time she could not fathom ever returning to those ways. Things changed though. <br />
<br />
Captured by the Normal and forced to stand idly by as her one remaining family member died had unlocked Morgans vicious nature. She would have her revenge on this newest Catalyst as well as the Normal in due time. First though she would need to gather her forces.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the Ring of Age, which belonged to her mother Katie and Aunt Gloria, was now in possession of the Catalyst. The same could be said of the Ring of Change that belonged to Sasha. A third Ring of Age that had once belonged to Jackie had been passed to her daughter and Morgans former apprentice Angelica. None of those rings could be taken easily meaning Morgan would have to venture to the other timeline.<br />
<br />
In this timeline is where Morgan would find success. The Ring of Change she had gifted to Mary Elise, now resided with Jack. For Morgan it seemed somewhat poetic, Jack had come to power as her replacement following her demise. He had amassed power, gained immortality, and now maintained the balance between light and darkness with Morgan&#39;s grandmother Kellie Pendragon. These two immortal beings had guarded the rings since the passing of their owners. Now Morgan would take them back.<br />
<br />
Gazing at Circes Amusement Park, Morgan grinned. In her second childhood she recalled many found memories of exploring the park. The residents would see her and welcome her with open arms. It would be child&#39;s play acquiring what she needed. Entering she was proven correct as the animatronic Vixi now gaped at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;OMG Morgan,&quot; Vixi squealed.<br />
<br />
Morgan smiled, giving the animatronic a shy wave as she bounded towards her. Groaning under the constructive hug of the robot, she now tried to have Vixi put her down. &quot;Having trouble breathing Vixi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Vixi replied meekly, releasing her vice like hug on the sorceress. &quot;Its just, we thought you were dead! How..how did you survive?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its a long story,&quot; Morgan smiled. &quot;A story I need to talk with my grandfather about. Can you take me to him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Vixi replied happily. The animatronic now paused, reaching her hand ul as she now touched Morgans dark locks. &quot;Huh did you dye your hair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just trying a new look,&quot; Morgan said quickly. Vixi nodded, the animatronic now guiding Morgan towards Circes castle.<br />
<br />
Morgan now studied the amusement park as Vixi talked excitedly. Morgan wasn&#39;t paying attention to what the animatronic was saying, simply studying the grounds and noting everything that had changed in her absence. Jack had obviously been busy, the park appeared twice as large as the last time she had visited. Glancing at various anthros she was pleasantly surprised to them wave happily to her. None suspected what she was her to do.<br />
<br />
As they now entered Circes castle, Morgan took note of the structure. Jack had obviously placed several enchantments upon the building, strengthening it to prevent its destruction. He had also transformed the castle into a type of Nexus, Morgan able to sense a convergence of dark energy within the building. Entering the throne room, Morgan smirked at the dim lit interior with a massive golden throne towards the back. Slowing, she now narrowed her eyes  as Vixi sprinted towards Jack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack,&quot; Vixi said excitedly. &quot;Look! Morgans come back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack paused, the dark lords eyes growing wide as he passed some paperwork to Amanda, the pink anthro cheetah attorney. Slowly, he now stood, descending the stairs to now confront his granddaughter. &quot;Vixi you should go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vixi was confused, her mechanical eyebrows arching as she looked between her master and Morgan. &quot;Is everything okay,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything is fine,&quot; Jack said quickly. &quot;I need to talk with Morgan. In private.&quot; Shrugging Vixi now exited the throne room, leaving Morgan, Jack, and Amanda alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats the matter grandpa,&quot; Morgan sneered. &quot;Aren&#39;t you happy to see me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cut the crap Morgan,&quot; Jack growled. &quot;We both know the Normal got their claws in you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Normal,&quot; Morgan laughed, emerging from the shadows to give her grandfather a better view of herself. Jacks eyes narrowed, a stern look crossing his face as he gazed at Morgans dark hair. Already he could sense the dark magic emanating from her. &quot;I parted ways with that organization,&quot; she smirked. &quot;Think of me as an...independent party.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I see,&quot; Jack replied, his voice low. Slowly he now approached, standing between his attorney at Morgan. &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My property,&quot; Morgan stated. &quot;Wheres my ring?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That ring is unavailable,&quot; Amanda stated, the anthro attorney now poking out from behind Jack. &quot;The ring was lawfully placed into Jacks care upon the passing of Mary Elise. As it stands you have no legal grounds for its possession.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she serious,&quot; Morgan asked in annoyance. Jack simply smirked, approaching Morgan as his power began to wash of the room. &quot;Afraid so,&quot; he sneered. &quot;You see, the universe has changed up quite a bit since you were last active. The powers that be want to keep things nice and orderly. And I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m just going to hand over that ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why is that Jack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell what you&#39;re going to do,&quot; he whispered, his eyes burning into Morgan. &quot;You&#39;ve gone dark Morgan. Let that old Lefay energy boil over. You get that ring your going to start all sorts of problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Morgan grinned, the sorceress now preparing a spell of her own. &quot;You think you can stop me? Grandpa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Inter-dimensional law forbids you from engaging in direct conflict with a guardian,&quot; Amanda exclaimed, the anthro cheetah woman now standing in front of Jack. Morgan simply smiled, turning to Amanda with a sinister smile on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hes not the one I&#39;m attacking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda now screamed as Morgans spell washed over. Jack gasping in fright as he watched the anthro cheetah womans body beginning to shudder. Jack now watched as Amanda began to shrink, her clothing sagging on her body as she collapsed to the floor. Amandas cries now began to rise in pitch, the anthro vanishing inside her clothing. As the spell completed, Jack stared in horror as a pink cheetah cub now emerged from Amandas clothing mewling up at her boss.<br />
<br />
&quot;I read a bit of law before I showed up Jack,&quot; Morgan grinned. &quot;You maybe untouchable but your underlings aren&#39;t. They rely on you for protection but, you attack me and its game on. So what do you say, care to go one on one Grandpa?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack roared, unleashing a powerful blast of magic at Morgan. He understood that by letting his rage get the best of him he left himself open for attack. Still, he couldn&#39;t let those he protected be assaulted by Morgan.<br />
<br />
Morgan now crashed into the adjacent wall, a grin spreading across her face. &quot;You have made a grave mistake Morgan,&quot; he growled. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Morgan smirked, the dark sorceress now preparing to take back her ring and take a step towards her revenge.</p>
