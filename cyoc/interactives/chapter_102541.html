<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been pouring over the city for two days. The sewagge pipes were clogged what that provoked floods all over downtown, but the rain and the lightning weren&#39;t enough to keep people out of the streets, especially gym people.<br />
 Martin was one of them - he never thought of himself as a jock, nor did he ever wanted to be one. But after so many beer pong games in college his beer gut started to develop and he decide to fix it. Eight months had been enough to flat it and pump up his chest. It was his final weeks and he couldn&#39;t miss a training day - it was an escape, a kind of zen moment.<br />
 In one of his days he had met a beautiful girl named Ivy, she was hot and winked at him a lot.Ivy had a tanned skin and dark hair with green clear eyes - an indian mistycal vibe that made him crazy. That day, when they met she pulled the conversation topic. Which was unusual; for the past days it had been the other way around, he used to talk to her only getting giggles and laughs in return, Behind her smiles and shy looks she confessed that she actually wanted someone to help her fix her window that had broken with the bad weather&#39;s window.<br />
 <br />
 Martin didn&#39;t know anything about repairs, but she and the boner panic would certainly inspire his inner handy-man, so he said &quot;yes!&quot; with enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
 Now he was waiting for her at the gym door. She had gone to get the car out of the parking zone and soon would pick him up. He was stroking his chin, covered by a hair. He had honey colored hair and greenish eyes too. His nose was somewhat big, he was never too fonded of it, but over all he was a cute, average guy. The only thing he had more exotic was his hair length which helped him having a man bun.<br />
<br />
 The car pulled over and he ran throughout the heavy rain, he opened the car&#39;s door and got inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you OK?&quot; she asked with her sweetheart voice. Ivy was was still wearing her sport bra she used to the gym. Her boobs were perky and rounded, and Martin was having a hard time looking in another direction. The car ride was mainly listening to her explaining the problem all over again and giggling for no reason. When they arrived- to a building complex, she parked the car in the garage and they took the lift up to the fifth floor. Becky took him throughout the house to the kitchenette paired with the living room.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Wow...you like pets!&quot;Martin stated the obvious as he looked to two aquariums, a shelf with terrariums: many of them empty and a hamster house where an energetic squirrel lived. She brought him a chair for him to climb and fix the living room&#39;s window. Martin did so and started looking at the broken window . In the other side the heavy rain battered the glass with a rhythmical melody.<br />
<br />
 &quot; I&#39;m going to make some berries juice. I always do after working out, do you want some?&quot; &quot; Hum...yes, please.&quot; he answered. Martin was actually concentrated into fixing the window, and for what he knew about the issue it was not such a difficult case as she made it look like. &quot;Women...&quot; he thought with a mental sigh. Some minutes passed by. He could hear Ivy behind him working on the kitchenette, the habitant squirrels and what looked like a tortoise coming out from under the sofa. He mentioned it, feeling the room empty for some time. Ivy said it was her sister&#39;s and she was sitting it, right now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here&quot; she finally said presenting him a glass with red juice.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I&#39;m almost done”. Martin told her. He then stretched his arm and took the glass of red juice from her hands.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Someone is sweaty&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
 Martin blushed with embarrassment. His pits had betrayed him, he was never that he must have started sweating. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...that&#39;s weird. But I swear I took a shower before leaving&quot; he said. Ivy giggled amused with his embarassement.<br />
 <br />
&quot; I trust you...I don&#39;t mind the murky scent&quot; she said. She dropped a hair pin, in front of the chair, on purpose, and bent over to catch it, leaving the college boy even crazier. &quot;In fact it&#39;s been a while since this house as felt a musky manly scent like yours. How&#39;s the juice?&quot;<br />
<br />
 Martin drank it in one gulp.<br />
 &quot;It&#39;s great, it&#39;s really good&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot; I think the window is ready&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot; Oh I still have to...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot; Just take a rest. Sit here next to me and talk for some time.&quot; she pleaded.<br />
<br />
 Martin didn&#39;t think twice and went. Ivy was giggling when he sat.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Who&#39;s your friend?&quot; she asked pointing at his crotch where a bulge was saluting them. Before he could say anything she hopped on him and sat on his crotch, facing him. Martin could feel her womanhood rubbing against his shorts. He couldn&#39;t believe that was happening. Ivy leaned forward and kissed him passionately. The poor guy was now trapped under her spell! Her hands removed his shirt; with clumsy moves he eagerly helped her and tossed it aside on the sofa. She ran her fingers along his chest, happy trail and right into his pants. Ivy snuck her hands inside and folded her elegant fingers around Martin&#39;s shaft. The college boy was going crazy, he must have gussed after all the giggling and the winking at him. But he never had the confidence in himself to make the move and seduce her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I knew you were pathetic, but not this much&quot; she laughed. Martin&#39;s expression questioned her. The atmosphere between them wasn&#39;t hot anymore. Ivy sighed in a condescending tone and looked right in his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you think I brought you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because...because you want the D?&quot; he stuttered. Ivy rolled her eyes, stiff and cold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know who I am? I&#39;m a witch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A witch, Martin.&quot; she repeated annoyed.<br />
 <br />
&quot;You see… as a witch I make a favor to humanity. I make the ones who are not leading anywhere in life into something less pathetic. Martin, you&#39;re a geeky guy, cute, but the moment I saw that virgin baby face and a goatee, I knew you had to be punish. That&#39;s my contribute to the world, that&#39;s what I do, I make guys like you discover their place on life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My place on life? You said you wnated to punish me! But punished for what&quot; his voice was shaky and high pitched, he wasn&#39;t just nervous and scared but too confused. Ivy looked up wondering for a reason, and clearly mocking him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Punished for... let us see. For being ten years after the nineties and you still think that goatees are hot, what about that?&quot;<br />
 Ivy felt he wanted to get up and pinned him against the sofa and whispered.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Don&#39;t fight it. You became my bitch and propriety the moment you drank that berry juice. Now...how can I make your life better, humm I know...&quot; And with these words she snapped her fingers.<br />
<br />
 Then...</p>
