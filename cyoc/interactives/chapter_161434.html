<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Corey just stared at the sheets of paper. He&#39;d joined this class in hopes of lightening his school load a bit. He had somewhat overloaded himself in his freshman year and was hoping to improve that in his second year. Now instead he&#39;d have to join a culture club. He flipped the sheets and looked where he&#39;d be expected to spend a large chunk of his time this semester. <br />
<br />
He got assigned to the Latin Student Association, the project form listed a few things he&#39;d have to do and had a schedule of the club&#39;s activities for this week. <br />
<br />
&#39;You&#39;re grade will also depend on how well the club says you&#39;ve integrated and socialized with the culture clubs, so be sure to make a good impression&#39; Corey read sighing, seemed there was no way to half ass this if he wanted to keep his GPA up.<br />
 <br />
Some of these tasks seemed kind of vague. It was also pretty clear he&#39;d have quite a few things to do, such as learn a bit of the culture&#39;s history and traditions. Attending the club&#39;s meeting regularly and helping out at events would take up a lot of his time.<br />
<br />
At least he got a culture assigned that he was somewhat tied to. Not only was his new roommate a Hispanic guy, but his own great-grandmother had been a Mexican immigrant. So he guessed he&#39;d have the chance to learn a bit about his heritage, even if he didn&#39;t really identify with it too much.<br />
<br />
Still with his light brown hair, green eyes and pale complexion he&#39;d probably stick out quite a bit in the club. He hadn&#39;t inherited any of that great-grandmother&#39;s ethnic traits, even his mom barely had any besides her dark brown eyes.<br />
<br />
Class was dismissed early after Professor Martinez talked a bit more about the syllabus, exams and answered. <br />
<br />
The first Club meeting was tonight after his last class of the day. So he just went about the rest of his day normally. He dumped his school stuff in this dorm room before heading to the Club room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo Cor! What are you doing here?&quot; Miguel, Corey&#39;s roommate, shouted as Corey was heading to the club room.<br />
<br />
Miguel was most likely what you&#39;d picture when you hear about a Hispanic man, excepts maybe for his height. He had tan skin, black hair and dark brown eyes. Corey was actually a bit shorter than Miguel, though the 2 inch difference between his 5&#39;11 and Miguel&#39;s 6&#39;1, wasn&#39;t that noticeable. And where as Corey had managed to keep the freshman 15 off, Miguel&#39;s chubby physique gave the impression that he wasn&#39;t as lucky.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey Miguel. I&#39;m heading to the Latin Student Association... my culture study class assigned me to it and I&#39;ll have to attend meetings and activities for a project...&quot; Corey said matter of factly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way! That&#39;s cool. I&#39;m heading there myself!&quot; the chubby Hispanic man said enthusiastically. &quot;I heard rumors about someone from that course joining our association for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? I didn&#39;t know you were a member.&quot; Corey looked surprised at his new roommate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I&#39;ve been a member for almost a year now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh. Well I might need your help for my project, if you don&#39;t mind Miguel. I&#39;m suppose to get acquainted to culture the club represents&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all. I&#39;d be happy to take you under my wing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two entered the room together and Corey went about scanning the room. He had expected to see a lot more guys somewhat fitting the stereotype, with tan skin and on the shorter side. <br />
However there was a large range of different skin tones and heights. Some members almost looked black, while others looked fairly white and one of the tan looking guys was standing out of the crowd at least 6&#39;5&quot;.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when he spotted Professor Martinez talking to a beautiful young lady. Once Martinez noticed him he waved him over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to see you taking this seriously... &quot; he quickly checked his clipboard &quot;... Corey Anders. This is Marisol, the current president of the Latin Student Association, she&#39;ll be in charge of your evaluation regarding participation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; Marisol held out her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Likewise&quot; Corey shook her hand. &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to learning about your culture.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Marisol and Prof. Martinez smiled, seemingly glad to hear him say that.<br />
<br />
A beeping went off from Martinez&#39;s pocket and he swiftly excused himself &quot;I&#39;ll best get going. Corey I look forward to seeing how you adjust to this club.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Today should be just an introduction to the club and this semester&#39;s schedule.&quot; Marisol explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope I won&#39;t need to know any Spanish. I only took one year of it in high school and I can&#39;t really recall too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marisol smiled kindly &quot;No need to worry, all our clubs official communications are in English, both to accommodate the members whose parents didn&#39;t pass the language down to them and to not show preference. Seeing we include both Spanish and Portuguese speaking territories.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... right...&quot; Corey said not really sure where in Latin America they spoke Portuguese, geography never was his strength. At least he didn&#39;t have to worry about his lack of Spanish being an issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;That said, trying to pick up some Spanish or Portuguese would most likely help you with integrating, so I&#39;d encourage it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah that makes sense, I&#39;ll see if I can pick up something, but with my schedule...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s understandable.&quot; Marisol nodded &quot;Because of my own schedule, I was actually thinking of organizing someone to help you out a bit with this project.  Being a senior and the president I won&#39;t always have time to assist I&#39;m afraid. <br />
<br />
I&#39;ll let you know if I find someone willing. I have a few people in mind already. <br />
<br />
Don&#39;t worry I know what tasks you have to do and will make sure you&#39;ll pass as long as you participate.&quot; Marisol smiled friendly<br />
<br />
Corey smiled &quot;Oh that&#39;d be great. I already asked my roommate Miguel, if he&#39;d help me out, but I&#39;d be happy for any assistance I could get.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah I thought I saw you come in with him, he&#39;s actually someone I was considering for the role. Anyways I bet be off. Here&#39;s my contact info. Let me know if you have any questions” Marisol and Corey exchanged contact information and then she hurried off into the crowd.<br />
<br />
Corey decided to get back to his roommate. Hanging around a familiar face would be nice while he got acquainted with the club. Miguel was hanging out with a few other guys near the buffet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Cor! Seeing your project is about getting acquainted with another culture I figured there&#39;s no better way to get to know a culture than by it&#39;s cuisine.&quot; Miguel said, grabbing a plate and turning to the buffet. He filled up a plate of various snack foods and handed it along with a soda of sorts to Corey. &quot;Here you go Cor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks...&quot; Corey just said a bit puzzled as his roommate turned back to the buffet, to fill his own plate. If this is how Miguel always ate, it was no wonder that he&#39;d develop a gut like that. Miguel&#39;s friends seem to similarly have their own plates with food.<br />
<br />
Still he didn&#39;t want to be rude so he started to snack on what his friend had given him. He listened to Marisol give her speech, welcoming new members and explaining the club a bit. There seemed to be a sale coming up soon, in which members of the association would try and raise more funds for the semester.<br />
<br />
Sometime later after Corey lost track of Miguel and was about to head back to his room. Marisol called out to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Corey, good, you&#39;re still here. I found someone that&#39;ll help you with the project and to integrate into the club. it&#39;s ...&quot;</p>
