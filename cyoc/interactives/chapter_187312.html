<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It seemed unbelievable, the divine kitsune had fallen.<br />
<br />
Darren had cradled the body, bringing him back to the palace. Tatsu&#39;s family, his people, all were shocked and in mourning as the body of the proud kitsune lord now lay upon an alter. Already monks had performed cleansing rituals, cleaning the body and dressing him in a funeral robe. Laying in waiting, inside an antechamber surrounded with incense and candles, the body of Tatsu now awaited the viewing by his family.<br />
<br />
From the shadows now two figures emerged. One was a slight figure, dressed in a dark robe. The otber was a dark orange nine tailed kitsune, a forlorn expression on his face.<br />
<br />
Fukushu was stone faced as he approached his fathers body. The prodigal son leaning heavily on the alter as he gazed at his fathers corpse. In death Tatsu seemed to wear a serene expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did not hate my father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith was taken aback, glancing at her kitsune lover, noting the mournful expression he now had. &quot;Beloved?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My father Abolith,&quot; he sighed. &quot;I did not hate him. I respected him. He was a powerful warrior, a just leader, a loving husband, a....wonderful father. I never said these things when he was alive. Now...&quot; Fukushu&#39;s trailed off, his shoulders slumping. Abolith could only squeeze his arm to comfort him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he knows,&quot; Abolith said softly. &quot;He is at peace now. We have paid our respects and should go now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu did not move, so consumed with grief and anger. He blamed himself, his wrath, his thirst for revenge. He had spent the years since Yomi&#39;s death inflicting pain on the very wizards who came to his peoples aid. Now karma was taking its brutal revenge on him. Part of him now wanted the wizards to come for him and put him out of his misery. <br />
<br />
&quot;You SON OF A BITCH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu turned slightly, watching as his siblings now entered the room, along with Yuriko and Darren. Kiko now stomped forward, the fuscha seven tail glaring at him. &quot;Little sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiko now slapped her older brother across the face. Fukushu remained emotionless as Kiko glared at him. &quot;Have you come to gloat,&quot; she yelled. &quot;Or did you come to finish the job and takeover.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I came to pay my respects Kiko no more, no less.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bullshit,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;You almost killed mom. You&#39;ve always hated them, hated us. Now you return to be what? The savior? Our new lord? Over my dead body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiko growled, a spell beginning to form in her hands as her siblings now joined her. &quot;Do you find it so hard that I simply wish to pay my respects,&quot; Fukushu asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah brother I do,&quot; Chisai growled. The massive kitsune now grabbed his older brother the the throat. Abolith now sprang forth, kicking the six tailed kitsune away before drawing her sword. Things were breaking down quickly. Kiko and Kari preparing spells as Takeo and Chisai looked to attack. Yuriko now tried to step in between the siblings, not wanting anymore blood shed. Darren was too stunned to act, clutching Tatsu&#39;s sword to his chest he failed to notice his rings begin to glow.<br />
<br />
The kitsune siblings shuddered, a glow now surrounding themselves. Gazing at their hands, they now curiously watched one another. &quot;What magic is this,&quot; Fukushu growled.<br />
<br />
Yuriko&#39;s eyes went wide as she stared at the kitsune siblings. Very quickly she watched as each one of them lost a tail. They were growing younger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats happening,&quot; Takeo asked as he became a teenage two tail. The kitsunes body growing slimmer as his voice rose in pitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you doing this,&quot; Fukushu asked angrily as he glared at Kiko. <br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t me,&quot; Kiko exclaimed, the kitsune regressing into a 5 tail. <br />
<br />
&quot;How is this happening,&quot; Chisai asked. The burly kitsune going from 4 tails to 3. The massive kitsunes body still bulky yet appearing more fit.<br />
<br />
Kari now glanced at Darren sighing as she regressed to 5 tails as well. &quot;Its the ring,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Its making us all younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you shitting me,&quot; Kiko exclaimed as she became a 4 tail vixen. &quot;How young are we going to get?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari simply shrugged, over the years she had seen the ring regress far to many people into children. Most often to depower individuals whose power could destroy worlds. Considering the amount of power Kari and her siblings had she had a feeling they would end up pretty young.<br />
<br />
Already Takeo had regressed into a one tail kit of 7 or 8. The formerly adult kitsune shrinking down into a skinny tan kit with overly large glasses.<br />
<br />
Chisai was the next to join Takeo in kithood. As he went from a 3 tailed adult into a teenage 2 tailed, Darren and Yuriko watched as his muscles lessened, becoming far less barrel chested and taking on a flabby appearance. As he became a one tail kit the formerly massive kitsune began to shrink. The kit gazing at Yuriko and Darren as he found the two of them looming over a rather chubby child of 8.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t you stop this Kari,&quot; Kiko asked as she became a 2 tailed teenager. Kari shook her head no causing the fuscha kitsune teen to groan. Kiko watched as her womanly curves evaporated, her body becoming waifish as she inched closer to childhood. Grasping her stylish clothes to her she seemed to gaze up at the others with pleading, wide eyes as she descended into her preteens. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a kit again,&quot; she whined, her voice rising several octaves as she became a skinny and tiny child of 9. Huffing in annoyance she now looked to her older siblings Fukushu and Kari.<br />
<br />
The two nine tails were barely 3 tails and quickly approaching 2. Both kitsune watched as their adult bodies slimmed. Kari watched her curves melt away while Fukushu&#39;s muscles became thinner. Now a pair of teenage two tails they gaped at the others, watching as they shrank down into young teens.<br />
<br />
The two 13 year old two tails now gaped at one another before looking to Darren and Yuriko. Fukushu now found himself a skinny teen about the same size as Darren, while Kari was a bit shorter, her body only beginning to show signs of puberty. &quot;I think it stopped,&quot; Kari whispered, wincing at the girlish tone of her voice.<br />
<br />
Abolith was in shock gazing at her beloved Fukushu. &quot;No,&quot; she whispered in horror. Tearing off her veil, Darren now beheld the dark elf assassins delicate features.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change him back. CHANGE HIM BACK!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith now launched herself at Darren, her eyes full of murderous rage. Yuriko now beckoned Akira to her side, the six tailed kitsune tackling Abolith as she continued to rave like a mad woman.<br />
<br />
&quot;Abolith,&quot; Fukuahu stated, his voice a boyish alto. &quot;Abolitb stop its okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith seemed to relax, her breathing fast but controlled as she fearfully gazed at Fukushu. The teenage kitsune now assisted the elf to her feet, his eyes growing wide as he realized she was now taller than him. &quot;I&#39;m okay,&quot; he stated, trying to sound confident. &quot;Wait outside. I need to talk with my siblings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith said nothing, her eyes wide and fearful as Yuriko and Akira escorted her out. Now Darren found himself alone with the regressed kitsune siblings. &quot;I thought she was going to kill me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was,&quot; Fukushu stated. Sighing he now tried to adjuat his clothing before looking between Darren and his siblings. &quot;Come Catalyst,&quot; he stated. &quot;We have much to discuss.&quot;</p>
