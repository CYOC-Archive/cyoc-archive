<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Colt knew that going through the wilderness unprepared guaranteed that his men would befall the same fate as Thomas. &quot;we are unprepared to go through the wilderness. However, tell your king my men will go to his palace on their way to the volcano&quot; he said. The drones nodded and flew off heading east. Turning he gave the doctor the order to get those suits ready. &quot;Kent once he gets four of those suits ready take X and go see what we&#39;re dealing with&quot; Kent nodded as the group left. Colt went to his office and checked on the evacuation. As expected every mode of transportation out of Las Sombra was gridlocked. &quot;mayor remember to tell your citizens not to head east.&quot; he then hung up. He did his best to control his nerves. Pulling up the map of the area he watched the wilderness grow. If there was another surge then they could be out of time. His eyes widened as the center of the wilderness pulsed and the outskirts grew. However, now the edges of the wilderness show different readings. It looked like shattered glass mixed with ocean currents. He got a call from Cynthia not two moments later. &quot;sir the readings&quot; she sounded frantic. &quot;I see them. Tell Avery his time is running short. If he can&#39;t build those suits before the energy hits us then all is lost&quot; he hung up. With this surge, the number of victims will likely increase faster than expected. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Of course, even during an evacuation, there are still people who will refuse and even deny that something like this could happen. Granted a reality-altering wilderness is stranger than people randomly turning into random things. Such is the case with Tyler and Sarah. The two lived in the suburbs east of the city. When all their devices said that a wilderness was approaching they believed they had been hacked. Even when their neighbors began to pack up or straight up leave they refused to budge. As a result, when they finally saw footage from a helicopter showing the wilderness they realized they were wrong. However, as they headed outside an energy blast hit them. Their clothes vanished as Sarah was thrown to Tyler&#39;s crotch. Her rear ended up fused with him as his lower half grew. His ass rapidly grew away from his legs taking Sarah with it. On either side of her two new legs grew. Brown furn that covered his second body as his feet became hoofs. A long tail hug above his ass and Sarah below. Sarah&#39;s legs then darkened to black the same color as her hair. They then lost their bones as fluids filled them like hard water balloons. The skin on her hips became a sheath with a bit of horse meat connected to her.  <br />
<br />
Sarah threw up as Tyler moaned. She tasted not bile but cum. They soon realized they were now a centaur with Tyler replacing a horse&#39;s head and Sarah replacing the horse&#39;s other head. Looking up in the sky they saw several other multi-colored blasts of energy rain across the suburbs. Hearing a rumble they looked and saw a forest heading their way. However, before it hit their street it stopped. The land was now sparsely covered in trees while grass and the occasional rock covered the rest. The houses around them were becoming large trees mounds of dirt or boulders, some were straight up disappearing. The road became a river. Their driveway became a shallow creek connected to that. They watched as the area that used to have houses on the other side became a group of trees. Their home faded no different. Left in its place were two trees and some strange plants between them. The sinking car morphed into a rigid curved plant. It looked a little like a banana. Weirdly apart from their odd predicament, the two felt like they loved what became of their subdivision, and it turns out they weren&#39;t the only ones. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Those who hadn&#39;t evacuated in time were either hit by the energy or transformed by the landscape. Rachel also believed it was a hoax and was lifting weights when the landscape changed. Unlike the chaotic wilderness, the new energy needs only to pass over a person. Rachel continued to pump iron as a nose ring appeared. Her long hair went from dyed blue to short and black. She gained a beard as her muscles replaced her feminine physique. Her crotch hid an eggplant-sized bulge as her clothing dissolved. His body got boviner as he packed on muscle. Within a minute a pudgy sixteen-year-old had become a seven-foot another bull. He flexed before looking at the speedo&#39;s in front of him. Picking one up she found out it and lined his two-foot cock nicely. His house now looked like a mixture of a gym and a barn. Randy went and stood outside his home. There was barely any civilization around him and he liked it. It seemed like not all who were changed by the land became feral but Randy didn&#39;t remember his last life. <br />
<br />
However, some didn&#39;t get so lucky. Ross was a single man playing with his dog outside. He didn&#39;t have any of his devices outside so he didn&#39;t even know about the evacuation. Hearing sirens he looked around confused. A rumble soon shook the ground. His fence broke into tall grass as changes overtook him. he soon became nothing more than a bouncy dog toy that looked like a clown. His dog now had a long serpent-like neck and a humanoid body covered in his fur. he played with his life-sized bouncy toy.   <br />
<br />
Oswaldo was a flat earther and figured this was some ploy. However, by the time he felt the rumble he was too late to change his mind. His house deteriorated around him. he now found himself in a cave. He tried running only to find his shoes had disappeared and he was fused to the floor. His legs fused into a white crystallized mass that stopped below his hips. His clothes vanished as he found himself flexing a double bicep pose and smiling. His cock then became as big as a horse while remaining human-shaped. Larry&#39;s muscles grew before the crystal overtook him. He had become a beefy statue made of salt when the energy hit him, allowing him to stay conscious but unable to move or talk.   <br />
<br />
Daisy was taking a long shower when the rumble started. Afraid for her life she went for the doorway. To her shock, the house&#39;s roof was gone. The rest of her home became mud and grass. Like Oswaldo, she soon found herself unable to move from that spot. However, her reason was that her feet had become roots and that she had dug deep into the ground to find water and nutrients. The green chlorophyll-filled skin replaced her pasty white as she gained some muscle. Her ass became smaller as did her chest, her breast disappearing completely. Her hands became giant leaves as her inner skeleton was replaced, allowing her to be incredibly flexible. Her face then turned yellow as she lost her nose and ears. Her hair became petals and surrounded her face. The final piece was a massive cock and balls hanging from her crotch as his legs fused. Daisy had become a bad-tempered flower man rooted in the ground. He felt like being stuck in the ground was unfair. He would have to wait until a creature came into his domain and... speak and you shall be answered. A tiny mouse-like creature flew in close to his face. His cock extended and blasted his special cum all over it. It squeaked in pleasure as it grew roots and sunk into the ground, and out popped a shrub with the face of the creature forever stuck in endless lust.   <br />
<br />
 With the landscape changing more people were affected. A couple became big roaring lions. A kid ended up with his feet being replaced with gator heads, and that was just the beginning for him. A man hit by the energy became a female version of himself. A teen became a furry bat-woman.   <br />
<br />
These were just some of those who either didn&#39;t believe the warnings or believed it was some hacker attack. Some were able to keep their minds because they were hit by the energy blasts first. Others kept their intelligence of some of it when they changed but lost their memories. The worst would be those who lost their minds completely, reduced to feral beasts or objects. The decent-sized suburb was now the teal plains, named that by the color of the grass.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Doctor Avery and his assistant were busy designing the suits and getting materials. John didn&#39;t like taking shortcuts, but if he didn&#39;t, he wouldn&#39;t have built the suits before the cosmic energy came and turned him into who knows what. X, meanwhile, was tasked with making the proper calculations. &quot;Okay, hopefully, the design works,&quot; John said as he looked over the materials and blueprints. &quot;let&#39;s get to building, first part is the cerebral protection unit,&quot; Avery said. The other two nodded as they got to work. Cynthia would hand John the parts. Then the doctor would put them into place. Finally, X would weld the structure together. Doctor Avery knew this was the most important part. Even if the suits failed as long as the protector was operational the group should retain their minds. The keyword is should. The energy from that chaotic volcano will be the highest concentration they can encounter. Hopefully, once they get to it and examine it they can figure out a way to stop it.</p>
