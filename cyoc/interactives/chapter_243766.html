<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the accidental conversion of the Evan’s Family in Alaska, as well as the illegal conversions of Christina Moore and Marcella Waller, Project Animalia began a general effort to lessen the possibility of unsanctioned outbreaks. <br />
As a part of this initiative, scientists within Animalia’s research and development division managed to synthesize a “2 in 1” Hybrid conversion formula. This product was advertised as a safe alternative to clinic conversions, combining the active virus with a compatible vaccine that would instantly take effect when the subject&#39;s transformation was complete. Essentially, anyone who converted with Hybrid formula would undergo the normal transition from human to animalian, and would be unable to spread the virus through physical contact or bodily fluids.<br />
The product was launched, and immediately conversion rates soared as many households and communities which had been hesitant to use the conventional formula for safety purposes placed their orders.<br />
However, despite the built-in safety that the Hybrid formula offered, logistical errors were still a reality of the shipping industry. Thanks to a single mistyped digit in the delivery address, a canister of Double Dose, African Lion, Hybrid formula, intended for a single, wealthy client, was delivered by accident to a small household in a suburban district of South Dakota.<br />
***<br />
Daniel Parker leaned against the wall in the living room of his family’s house. The sixteen year old ran one hand through his brown hair, green eyes glancing lazily at his phone. There was a look of boredom on his youthful face.<br />
“Danny!” A voice called from the kitchen. Light footsteps carried into the room as a middle aged woman rounded the corner, wearing an apron over a short sleeved blouse and a pair of capri pants. Meredith Parker had her dark hair tied into a ponytail, and stood at average height, just a little shorter than her son. She looked at Daniel expectantly with matching green eyes. Her cheeks were freckled, and her body was a little on the heavier side. “I could use some help in the kitchen…” Her tone was playfully demanding.<br />
Daniel sighed. “Okay mom.” He put away his phone.<br />
Meredith smiled at him. “Thank you sweetheart.” She planted a kiss on his cheek as he followed her into the kitchen.<br />
A few minutes later, the doorbell rang.<br />
Daniel went to answer it, and came face to face with a taller woman in a bright tank top, shorts and flip flops. She was about his mom’s age, and very pretty, with suntanned skin and golden blonde hair that ran down her back. Felicia grinned at him as she pulled him into a tight embrace. <br />
“Daniel, look how much you’ve grown!” she exclaimed in a bubbly voice.<br />
“Hi Mrs. Erickson.” Daniel replied with shyness as his neighbor squeezed his cheeks.<br />
Felicia gave his arm a squeeze as she moved past him. “Thank you for having us over for dinner! I’ve gotta go say hi to your mom.” She made her way into the kitchen.<br />
Behind her was a younger girl about Daniel’s age. She looked much like her mother, golden hair, blue eyes, and beautiful features, but she was shorter and sported a lanky adolescent build. Like Daniel, Amelia wore shorts and a t-shirt alongside tennis shoes. They looked at each other for an awkward moment before Amy stepped forward.<br />
“Hi Danny.” The girl spoke as she hugged him softly.<br />
“Hi Amy.” Daniel flushed as he returned the gesture.<br />
Both teenagers blushed heavily, looking away as they broke off from each other.<br />
“Happy Mothers Day.” Daniel offered shyly, not sure what else to say.<br />
Amy chuckled under her breath. “Thanks.” The pair smiled at each other as their moms laughed loudly in the kitchen.<br />
The two families sat down in the living room at a large wooden table, quickly bowing their heads and saying grace. Felicia looked up with a glint in her eye.<br />
“Guess what came in today?” The woman reached into her bag and pulled out a small metal cylinder. “The cream I ordered! I’ve heard it’s great for cooking!”<br />
Meredith stood excitedly, “Are you willing to share? I just made coffee.”<br />
“Sure!” Felicia replied.<br />
“I’ll have some too.” Amy said.<br />
“Daniel?” Meredith looked at her son.<br />
Daniel shook his head. “I don’t really drink coffee.”<br />
The young man grabbed a soda from the fridge as his mother poured three steaming mugs of freshly brewed coffee. She took the canister and carefully poured a generous helping into each mug, before placing it in the fridge.<br />
“To Mothers Day!” The table raised their cups, all three women taking a deep sip of the coffee.<br />
“Cheers!” Felicia exclaimed.<br />
Meredith brought out the meal, a well seasoned meatloaf. Daniel helped himself to a good sized portion, but to his surprise, the women pilled the meat onto their plates with no restraint, licking their lips. They started to dig in ravenously.<br />
Lively conversation filled the living room, dominated by the two mothers, who talked about work and hobbies and made plans to go out together in the near future. Daniel kept to himself, slowly picking at his food. Amy kept glancing at him when he wasn’t looking, blushing deeply. <br />
Daniel felt his own face go red. They had known each other since they were kids, having grown up as next door neighbors, and ever since they started high school, he had developed a crush on her, though he never admitted it.<br />
The conversation shifted. “So…what do y’all think about this Animalia business? I keep hearing all about it in the news.” Felicia asked the table.<br />
Amy brightened. “I think it’s really cool! I would love to convert someday!” She looked closely at Daniel. “What do you think?”<br />
He shifted under the table. “I mean, yeah it’s cool. I don’t really know about conversion though…I think I’d rather stay in my own skin.”<br />
A flash of sadness came across Amy’s eyes, before she covered it with a smile. “Oh, um, okay.”<br />
“Well, I think it’s very strange.” Meredith harrumphed. “Why would anyone choose to become an animal?” She took a deep drink from her coffee mug.<br />
The women started to argue. Felicia was scratching at her chest absentmindedly, while Amy’s ears started to twitch. All of them were shifting in their seats, faces beginning to turn red.<br />
“Goodness it’s hot in here. Sweetheart, could you turn up the A/C?” Meredith asked Daniel.<br />
He looked confused. The temperature felt normal to him. “Uhh, sure.”<br />
Daniel got up and adjusted the dial. As he sat back down, he looked at his mother and his eyes went wide. Her blouse suddenly looked tight, hugging her body like a second skin. A few inches of her stomach were exposed under the hem of the shirt, and the gap seemed to be widening.<br />
Daniel looked up, and realized with a start that she was eye level with him sitting down. He watched incredulously as her head seemed to rise up an inch, her eyes surpassing his.<br />
“What is it Daniel?” Meredith reached out to him, looking concerned. “What’s wrong?”<br />
Daniel’s jaw dropped as his mother’s pupils dilated, changing shape into dark slits. All three women were breathing heavily. The conversation had halted, and they stared at him intently. Somewhere deep inside, he felt a tinge of primal fear. He wasn’t sure what to say.</p>
