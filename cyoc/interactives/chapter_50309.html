<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The main meeting in the office quickly began to break up. Isabelle, Grace, and Hope went in search of Zack, having no second thoughts about spying on him for their master. Kaylee and Darla drifted to Jensen's side while Mr. P and Martha began to gather up the pups, intending to take them up to the study. Jenny and Marcy were no problem as they were still riding on Mr. P's back. Bart and Kevin slowly followed the black and gold wolf with Martha's prodding, while Alice approached Fran.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I do well, Auntie?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did marvelously,&quot; Fran smiled at the glass wolf, relieved that her and Darla's disappearance hadn't sent the police into a panic, which meant that as long as they were careful they could bring Julie, Abbey, and Samantha into the pack. She still privately wanted her daughters to be flesh and blood wolves, but her parental instincts weren't about to deny Alice glass playmates if they wished it, &quot;Soon our family will be complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice nodded with a bright smile. She liked her cousins and liked the fact that they seemed to like her more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, like a proper family,&quot; Alice nodded, &quot;May I ask a question, Auntie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do Abbey and Samantha go to school?&quot; Alice asked, &quot;I want to tell them the good news, that they will be joining us and will be with you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran looked at the glass wolf for a moment. It seemed that she was just as anxious to bring her family into the pack as she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would wait until they return home, Alice,&quot; Fran said firmly, &quot;Their kindergarten school does not have mirrors in the classrooms. Their only mirrors are in the bathrooms, which would mean you have reveal yourself to the other children, and I do not think the Master would want you doing that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I love my cousins, Auntie,&quot; Alice pouted.<br />
<br />
Fran lifted Alice up and hugged her tightly, &quot;I know. I love them too, but we must be patient. Soon, they will be with us.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile on the other end of town, Trevor cleaned himself while sitting in one of his favorite places, a window sill where the sunlight came in throughout the day. He didn't like the fact that his only way to clean himself was to lick himself, but for some reason his human mind couldn't overcome his cat side's dislike of water.<br />
<br />
The yowling from outside had finally stopped during the day and Trevor hoped the female cat had left. He was tempted to simply name her &quot;Queen&quot; but he sensed that was also his &quot;tom-instincts&quot; that did want to mate with the cat. The thought of that made him shudder. He didn't know which was worse. The female cat wanting him to mount her and being pushy about it, Serenity urging him to take the Queen up on her offer, or his own instincts wanting to take the Queen's offer. His human mind was disgusted by much of it and depressed at Serenity's wish for him to give in to his &quot;cat side&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hello, Trevor,&quot; came a voice from outside the window.<br />
<br />
Trevor nearly fell of the window sill when he heard the Queen's &quot;voice&quot; call to him from outside the window. He turned to see her perfectly balanced on the outside edge of the window sill looking at him through the screen of the window.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Trevor answered nervously, &quot;Queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Queen?&quot; the female tabby lowered one ear in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;You act like one,&quot; Trevor retorted, &quot;I thought it'd be a good name for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you name me?&quot; Queen inquired,&quot;Naming things is a human thing... never understood why. I mean, we all look different, smell different, act different. Why do they insist on naming things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Things need names, I guess,&quot; Trevor gave the best attempt a cat could do at shrugging.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your human has really broken your spirit, then,&quot; Queen answered, &quot;You're sounding like them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want?&quot; Trevor asked as he began to feel annoyed and didn't really want to hear a lecture on why cats were superior to humans.<br />
<br />
&quot;The same as before,&quot; Queen pawed playfully at the screen, but did not extend her claws, &quot;to have your kittens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't you find some male that doesn't have a human?&quot; Trevor retorted, &quot;I do not want to be a penis with legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the males around here have seen the evil man with the scissors,&quot; Queen replied, &quot;You're my only choice, and besides, you're a fine male.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor guessed that that meant that most of the cats in Glendale had been neutered. It did not change his opinion. He still would not consummate any relationship with someone who didn't love him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not want you,&quot; Trevor answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mouth says no, but your scent says yes,&quot; Queen pawed at the screen again, &quot;and I know I drive you wild.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor shuddered. He could smell her scent, and something about it was intoxicating, which made his battle against his &quot;cat side&quot; harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am engaged in important work with my human,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;I have no time to start a family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No time to mount me?&quot; Queen retorted, &quot;Once I am pregnant, your job is done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you care about anyone you're with?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I cared for my past litter, and I raised them well... but they're adults now and on their own,&quot; Queen answered, &quot;that is my purpose. To perpetuate the greatest race that has ever existed. Remember, Trevor, the humans used to worship us as Gods.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't mean we are Gods,&quot; Trevor answered, trying to stick to his Lutheran upbringing, &quot;there is only ONE God, and it not Bast or whatever Deity the Egyptians worshiped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You follow the human God who lives in a book?&quot; Queen asked, sounding shocked, &quot;You are a strange Tom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, best not mate with me then,&quot; Trevor tried, &quot;your kittens might inherit my strangeness. Now leave me be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will not be denied,&quot; Queen answered, &quot;and it would be in YOUR best interest to mount me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor looked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;You never know when your human might need someone who's seen things that many humans miss,&quot; Queen pawed at a portion of the screen, claws extended, cutting some of the wires.<br />
<br />
&quot;My human is smart,&quot; Trevor answered nervously as he saw what Queen was doing, &quot;She does not need your help. Now, go away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor then moved to push on the other end of the glass window pane on his side. He had to close it before she clawed her way in. After about a minute, the window finally moved, and sent Trevor flying to the floor. Thankfully, with cat-like agility (which comes without surprise), he landed on his feet. He then faintly heard Queen call through the glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll meet again Trevor,&quot; Queen called, &quot;and you WILL father my new litter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor only shuddered.<br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Yourssh sho nis to me,&quot; Pearl slurred as Beatrice moved the drunken she-wolf to a couch in a different room.<br />
<br />
The green she-wolf also intended to get a bucket, as she didn't think the pearl colored female would be able to hold all the alcohol she had consumed down. She also wondered why Pearl had thoroughly plastered herself on the Smith family's wine collection. She also never noticed that the Master didn't find out... which was possible, as they all seemed to drink water more then anything else, or the blood left on the floor after they'd consumed the meat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you do this, Pearl?&quot; Beatrice asked as she began looking for a bucket.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel bettteerr...&quot; Pearl slurred, &quot;after helschping Ssshhack.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made Beatrice blink as she placed a large bowl underneath Pearl's drooling muzzle as her head was draped over the side of the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Beatrice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;After helping Sschack,&quot; Pearl answered slowly, &quot;You know Miss Buttersworth. Darrd Ju tu schollow im...&quot;<br />
<br />
Beatrice then cringed as Pearl emptied her stomach into the bowl, thankfully getting none of it on the floor and leaving her head over the side of the couch as she then passed out. Beatrice carefully did her best to clean Pearl's lips and make sure that she wouldn't choke on her own vomit. All the while, however, she was nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;She heard Nick tell Nicole what Zack said about Roger and Lawrence,&quot; Beatrice thought quietly, &quot;why would she help him... and more importantly why would she use up her turn on June, who still had her turn. Both Nicole and the Master will be furious. Nicole for Pearl not sticking with the other she-wolves, and the Master for the unauthorized use of a turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beatrice then looked down at Pearl.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I do?&quot; Beatrice wondered.</p>
