<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex couldn’t think straight as the video of Schick de Clique and that Doberman stud started playing again on loop. The young girl just stood their wide-eyed, her breath jittering outwards in lusty huffs as she starred at the tip of that dog cock peeking out from that black tube of fuzz. She was enraptured at how heavy that sheath looked with what must have been over a foot of hot doggy penis buried inside.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, Heather…” Alex groaned, pulling her hand out of her panties and using those soaking wet fingers to input her best friend’s changes.<br />
<br />
“Species: Dog. Breed: Doberman. A big one.” Alex narrated herself, her fingers swiping along the “Size” slider to make sure Heather wasn’t any sort of runt. She quickly scrolled down the list, finding options for “Penis Size” and “Ball Size”.<br />
<br />
“A reeeeaaalllly big one.” Alex repeated herself, increasing those options until they reached their absolute maximum. <br />
<br />
The girl starred at the screen for a moment, looking at all the options now fitted to her specifications, her best friend ready to be changed into a horny canine stud. Her finger hovered over the “Transform!” button as Alex’s mind wrestled once more with whether it was okay to do this… whether it was okay to turn Heather into this Adonis of a dog to fill her own desires.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, Alex.” She tried to reassure herself, her finger wavering over the button to finalize her friend’s change. “I know this isn’t good to do… but it’s just for a little while – You’re just being a bad friend for a little while, so you might as well get it all out. You’re just gonna make her change, touch her sheath, rub her cock… lick her…”<br />
<br />
Alex blushed, realizing she didn’t know how far she wanted this to go. She turned her attention to the slider on the app indicating the “Duration of the Change”. Alex didn’t know how much time she’d need to get all her desires out or whether she’d need to quickly change Heather back. For now, she left that option blank – she would just go back to the app and change her back manually when she needed to.<br />
<br />
“It’s fine… Heather’s going to like this too… I’ll treat her really nice. She’ll be a really happy dog…” Alex egged herself on to press the button, her finger finally sinking down onto the phone’s screen and approving the change.<br />
<br />
As she pressed the button, an animation on the screen played showing a cartoon of a person kneeling down to all fours. “Congratulations on your new form! Please assume a quadrupedal pedal position so your change can proceed as smoothly as possible!”<br />
<br />
Alex felt relieved and worried at the same time. Heather was still in the bathroom and she hadn’t told her a thing about this. Hopefully she wouldn’t freak out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heather didn’t know what happened. One minute she was using the toilet like she always had done – she was able to sit down and pee like always, but now…<br />
<br />
The little girl winced as a stream of piss ejected perpendicular to her groin, arching up until it splattered on the rim of the toilet seat and sprayed all over the bathroom floor.<br />
<br />
“Eww…” Heather sighed queasily as she pinched off the flow of urine. She managed to stop it, but for some reason she just felt like she needed to piss much more than she needed to when she’d started. Reaching down, her clit felt a tad swollen, the tiny button peeking out and rubbing between her labia as it seemed to push out her urethra along with it.<br />
<br />
As she toyed with that growing bulb of pink flesh, a jolt suddenly rocked her little body, eliciting a surprised yelp as Heather leapt off the toilet, the ten-year-old left shivering as she leaned onto the sink, grasping it for dear life.<br />
<br />
“F-frick.” Heather panted out, her tongue hanging out of her mouth as she looked down, spotting a tiny red tip peaking out of her adolescent pussy lips. The girl writhed as another spurt of piss suddenly eked out, her nose curling up as she perceived the smell of her piss suddenly becoming eye-wateringly pungent. She tried to stop peeing but couldn’t. Urine puddled around her feet as Heather sprinted for the shower, leaning her weight against the wall finally feeling safe to let loose.<br />
<br />
Unusually acrid piss erupted from her growing clitoris like a geyser, a half-inch of nascent doggy cock sliding through her piss-soaked pussy lips as the pressure on her bladder began to give way. All Heather could do was let it out, the little girl hiking a leg up like a dog pissing on a fire hydrant to angle the stream into the shower. Her tongue slipped out longer from her mouth, growing thin as her nose was forced to huff in that miasma of scents wafting through the air. Her piss still smelled strong, but it didn’t seem to distress her as much as it did just a few moments ago. It smelled a little like her, making anything it drenched smell like her too… making anything it touched smell good.<br />
<br />
The girl’s cute button nose extruded out slightly as her mouth followed suite, Heather licking her chops as gooey drool began to seep from her growing proto-muzzle. Her legs arched up as they began to stretch on their own. Her heels shifted upward as the soles of her feet elongated like rubber as the oblivious girl became digitigrade. Canine piss streamed around the her toes as it hurried down the shower’s drain, the skin becoming soft and sensitive wherever it touched, spongey-soft paws swelling out as claws erupted from her delicate toe nails.<br />
<br />
Heather felt light-headed, humping the air as the last few drips of canine urine oozed out. It felt so good for some reason, the little girl almost disappointed as that little red tip retracted back between her labia, a tiny bit of black-peach fuzz beginning to spread around her groin. She winced as a tiny noodle burst from her tail bone, a fleshy shrub of skin wagging fitfully as it grew out into a short canine tail.<br />
<br />
“Oh… this feels so weird…” Heather groans, shakily stepping out of the shower as she wobbled on her new dog-like feet. She still couldn’t think straight, new sensations wrestling each other for Heather’s attention as the overwhelmed girl tried to think of someone who could help…<br />
<br />
“Alex…!” She yipped, her tail wagging quickly like a dog greeting her owner as she thought about her best friend. For some reason, Alex just seemed so amazing all of a sudden - so smart, capable, and perfect. She’d know what to do!<br />
<br />
The changing girl rushed for the bathroom door, finding it a little awkward to open it as her fingers started to shorten, puffy paw-pads swelling out as she managed to grasp the door handle enough to turn it. She rocketed to her bedroom, opening the door to her room as her hands shifted into nothing but a large pair of canine paws.<br />
<br />
“A-alex!” Heather barked to best friend as she barged in to find Alex still masturbating to the video of Schick de Clique and her Doberman. Alex’s expression was an impossible-to-read face of surprise, fright, and lust – her own Doberman suddenly barging into the room.<br />
<br />
Alex’s eyes dilated to the size of saucers as she took in the changes. She looked like canine limbs had been attached to her torso, obnoxiously large canine musculature bulging as new attachments were made to suite her new form. A dark, glossy coat converted to pristine girl-skin to beast flesh as her limbs quickly lost any trace of humanity, forcing Heather to lean against her dresser to keep herself upright. A loud snap erupted from her hips, forcing the changing girl to become a quadruped. Despite all this, Heather didn’t seem to be in any great pain. Her tail wagged, tongue panting out with a dull-yet-excited look in her eyes as she huffed a panting smile towards her best friend.<br />
<br />
Alex nervously stepped towards her, reaching out a hand as she stroked the dog-girl’s back, feeling her rock-hard muscles shift and reform as she pet Heather. “G-good boy…” Alex managed to mumble through her lust-drenched stupor, her hand drifting up to Heather’s scalp as she lightly scratched the long auburn hair that hung off her stubbornly human head. Now, almost everything about her was canine – the only trace of her humanity relegated to her still mostly-human face.<br />
<br />
“B-boy?” Heather whined, her voice growing gruff as black doggy pelt collared her neck. “Alex… I think something’s wrong…”<br />
<br />
“I know I should have told you… b-but…” Alex muttered before being interrupted by the sound of water splashing against the carpet… but it wasn’t water…<br />
<br />
The girl kneeled down under Heather, a drooling gasp erupting from her lips as she saw the underside of her friend’s belly. It was decked in black and brown Doberman fur, that ocean of doggy hide leading up to the girl’s fuzz colored pussy lips, an inch of crimson red puppy meat sticking out, marking the dresser with a heady stream of canine urine. <br />
<br />
Heather’s clit had evolved into a dog cock and it was exactly what Alex wanted – exactly what was in that viral video. Without wasting another word, her shaky hand grasped that plump, fuzzy labia as she gently stroked it, feeling Heather’s girl honey mixed with doggy pre dribble onto her fingers as another inch of penis slid free.<br />
<br />
The ten-year-old girl on her knees below her changing friend was absorbed in the sight. Every inch of that red flesh was soaking wet, the steaming piss drenched the air in must, surrounding Alex in a sauna of blossoming canine pheromones. Her head pressed into Heather’s groin, her lips gently nipping the shaft of that molten-hot blood-red cock as her new dog’s stream of piss began to abate.<br />
<br />
Alex almost went limp, her hand holding onto Heather’s strong canine hindlegs for support as she experienced her first time with a boy’s dick – not to mention, her first time even kissing a boy. That skin was so smooth, firm and slick with irresistible male juices coaxing the girl to nurse on Heather’s boner like a pacifier. She knew how wrong this was, but she felt magnetized to the taboo tinge of bestial sex lining every cell of Heather’s doggy pride. That cock demanded Alex’s attention, Heather’s new body drooling out an interspecies message of lust to Alex even though both her and Heather were both virgins.<br />
<br />
A howl erupted above Alex as the new dog’s front paws struck the piss-soaked carpet, Heather leaping away from her friend, running to the other side of the room as she starred back at Alex with a worried look on her face.<br />
<br />
“Wrong… Very wrong...” Heather barely managed to say through her mostly human face, her body quaking as her dog cock slurped back inside her fleshy labia. As her cock disappeared inside her, her pussy lips extended out, covering her bone like a blanket until it grew into a proper canine sheath, a drooling strand of pre dripping out of the tip as Alex began slowly approaching her new dog.<br />
<br />
“I know it’s weird…” Alex said as sweetly as she could to Heather, rubbing the girl’s cheek as another hand dipped down to the hem of her pants. “I promise this isn’t permanent… it’s just a game… it’s just for fun. You remember when we used to play house when we were little, right?” Alex slowly pulled down her pants, thumbing down her panties along with them as her young vagina slopped free, her pale skin still soaking in her own juices from masturbating. “Well pretend to be the dog in the house, okay? I promise this will be more fun than anything else we had planned for tonight…”<br />
<br />
Alex gently pushed Heather’s head down, guiding her short muzzle to her plush labia, the girl gently rubbing the wet skin on her new dog’s nose. “Good boy, Good dog.” Alex tenderly praised her while trying to hold in her own lust, her fingers running along Heather’s reddish locks of hair as she felt them easily give way, falling onto the floor as black fur blanketed her scalp. Alex tried encouraging her, grinding on top of Heather’s short snout as her girl honey oozed out, but Heather just held still as if she were in a daze. The almost-completely-changed girl didn’t react – her eyes wide and glossy as she stood completely still as if she didn’t understand what to do.<br />
<br />
Alex dismounted her friend’s muzzle, getting on all fours as she tried to tease Heather just like Schick he Clique did to that other Doberman. She waggled her bare rump in the dog’s face, shooting Heather a lust-soaked look as she tried her best to attract some sort of attention. “Go on, doggy! Good boy!” Alex tried to entice the dog to her butt. Heather’s head dipped down, her wet nose stroking that lush, girly rear. She sniffed a few times, a little drool dripping out onto Alex’s butt, but Heather still seemed confused about what her friend wanted. Alex sighed, “You still don’t get it… umm… maybe this?”<br />
<br />
Backing up more, Alex crawled between Heather’s front legs, pushing her rear up in the air until she felt that fuzzy tube hanging off Heather’s belly smoosh right into her butt crack. A switch clicked on in Heather’s head, the big Doberman’s hips suddenly pistoning into Alex’s butt. The girl yelped out a shriek as Heather knelt down, covering her girlish frame in over one hundred pounds of muscular dog as a searing hot inch of doggy poker begin drilling into the crevice of her butt. Alex’s skin seemed to sizzle against that molten-hot canine meat as her head screamed-out second thoughts. The girl tried to pull away only for Heather to hug her friend with those thick, powerful paws, kneading her flat chest as the dog forced her to stay in place.<br />
<br />
Inch after inch of canine love branded her blushing-red butt with sloppy thrusts, dotting her soft skin with acrid dog precum until that tapered tip hit gold, nestling against those pillowy soft adolescent pussy lips. In one fell thrust Heather buried three inches of cock inside her friend, her new male instincts kicking into overdrive, resolute on breeding the little girl underneath her.<br />
<br />
Tears slipped down Alex’s cheek as her hymen was battered by her friend, that thin tissue of virginity tearing as another three inches of animal penis slipped down her birth canal. Alex whimpered in pain as a few trickles of blood trickled out of her engorged pussy lips, the red fluid mixing with Heather’s pre until it diluted in those doggy juices – serving as nothing more than lubricant to the canine stud bearing down on her.<br />
<br />
That chorus of sloppy wet slaps increased in volume as Alex felt a fuzzy sack the size of a tennis balls spank against her thighs. Heather had finally grown balls – pendulous puppy factories marking the former-girl as male. As Heather accepted her new role, her small muzzle finally pressed out into a proper canine snout, ears fixing into fuzzy points as her eyes shifted, losing their intelligent glow until nothing but a dull, happy dog’s took their place. Alex was oblivious to her friend finally losing HIS last trace of humanity, her entire being focused on a baseball sized lump of scolding hot flesh at the fat end of that dog cock battering her stuffed vulva.<br />
<br />
Alex could already feel her inner walls pressed flush with Heather’s doggy pride, every neuron screaming in pain and pleasure as they were massaged by the dog’s penis. The girl knew that she couldn’t take any more, but the Doberman was forcing it, jackhammering her jiggly rear with brutal humps, squashing her pussy against his knot until there wasn’t anywhere else for that cock to go but inside.<br />
<br />
Alex felt like she was about to be ripped apart, but her plaint, young body managed to hold under the assault of canine lust. A loud, sopping-wet slurp sounded out as Alex screamed in unison, that tapered tip stabbing her uterus as that dog knot anchored Heather inside. The young girl below the Doberman was seeing stars, feeling those fuzzy doggy nuts jolt upwards as a flood of boiling hot puppy batter doused her insides like a fire hose. Heather kept delivering short, messy humps as his groin plapped against Alex’s rear, keeping an air-tight seal around his friend as he treated her like a stud would a horny bitch, the Doberman finally relaxing after he was satisfied Alex was tied. Heather licked the back of Alex’s head before lifting a leg, getting off the girl as he turned. That knot anchored him and his friend butt to butt as dog semen continued to seep inside Alex, cum drooling down her rear, seeping down her legs.<br />
<br />
“N-NO! DON’T MOVE!” Alex screamed out, trembling and shaking as Heather seemed to obey, plopping on the floor behind the girl as his bristly fur and tail wapped against her rear. Alex collapsed then and there on the carpet, trying to just live through the experience there for as her stretched out insides gradually molded to the shape of Heather’s cock. The girl let out a gasp each time she felt another hot dollop of dog seed spray inside her, making her feel warmer than she ever had. Her body began to bask in post-coital bliss as she finally started to relax, letting that throbbing doggy hard-on do what it wanted to her. She was just along for the ride at this point, masculine heat radiating inside her as Heather idly bred her.<br />
<br />
“Good boy…” Alex blushed, reaching back behind her to pat Heather on his muscular flank. The male Doberman arched his head back to lick her hand before laying his head down on the floor, Alex’s changed friend beginning to fall asleep after the long ordeal.<br />
<br />
Alex reached out to grab hers and Heather’s smart phones, but all she could get to was her own. Heather’s was far out of reach, and since it seemed that Alex was stuck there tied to that huge Doberman, Heather was going to need to stay a dog until that knot comes loose.<br />
<br />
Alex flipped through her phone to the Yiffr app, spotting a profile on Heather the Doberman, a flashing sign reading “NEW” on his profile.<br />
<br />
“That was so fast...” Heather said, amazed that the app really did all this. She flipped to the “Transformation” tab, wondering if she should really do this…</p>
