<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric did ultimately find his bag and put on a clean pair of clothes while Julie did the same. Neither of them noticed that the intercom&#39;s button was stuck, though his mind, always active, couldn&#39;t help but think over things that Julie had said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No shame over nudity among other weres...&quot; Eric thought to himself and thought over the past weeks that his family had since their move to Moon Lake and each Anderson joining Moon Lake&#39;s were society.<br />
<br />
He remembered the conversation in which he learned that weres had a higher libido than normal humans. Now that he was a were, himself, he could feel that. Just seeing Julie was enough to make him feel rather warm and brought the thoughts about what he and Julie had been dreaming over now and their future family. He didn&#39;t feel ready to be a father, but as he looked at Julie and saw her beauty, and had a good idea on what Julie would look like when she grew up, nearly identical to her mother, he did want to ultimately have children of his own with Julie. It would be part of their whole &quot;happy ever after&quot; that seemed to reinforce things. There was also the fact that while he could feel the urge to make sweet love to Julie, he felt in control of himself and wasn&#39;t going to just try to have sex with her because she was there. In that, it didn&#39;t feel bad to have a were&#39;s libido now.<br />
<br />
He thought on the condition of his parents marriage. When they&#39;d first moved in, while their marriage was loving, it was still recovering from his father&#39;s past affairs. The fact that Yvette Smith tried to claim his father as hers and infected him, making him a werefox, only added to that issue. Yet his father forged a werefox&#39;s bond to his mother and in accepting that she was bi and becoming a werecat, both his parents began to rapidly heal their marriage from even the stress that Yvette added to it. They did their best to help assure him that even though they were weres that they loved him and that there was nothing he had to worry about. Eric also remembered hearing enjoying each other&#39;s company almost every night since the two of them became weres, which seemed to remind Eric on how strong a were&#39;s libido could be.<br />
<br />
Then came the battle with Yvette. It put an end to the strain and threat the rogue vixen posed and marked the beginning of his family&#39;s real welcome to Moon Lake as they would have dinner with the Stovalls once Julie was assured that he was okay. Eric remembered coming down to seeing his parents, Ben, his brother, and Frances all in their were forms and all either naked as a result of their transformations or from the fight with Yvette. Yet all of them were standing rather comfortably with each other as if being naked and in their fursona was rather casual. The only thing that had seemed to make his parents nervous when he came down wasn&#39;t that they were naked but that they were likely getting ready to start having sex there in the dining room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weres do seem to have no shame with each other,&quot; Eric realized as his thoughts went over the end of the battle with Yvette and his report to his parents on the invitation to the Stovalls.  He then wondered to himself, &quot;how long will it be before I&#39;m fully like them and don&#39;t think about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; came Julie&#39;s voice, snapping Eric out of his thoughts.<br />
<br />
Eric shook his head to see his girlfriend/fiance standing before him in a pair of knee length shorts and a tee shirt, yet looking as beautiful as if she were in a fancy gown to his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I  was just thinking,&quot; Eric answered, &quot;about how much things have changed... how much my family has changed since coming here... how much I&#39;ve changed since you came into my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric came forward and pulled Julie into a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;How much joy I&#39;ve had hearing you say, &quot;I love you&quot; and how much I&#39;ve loved telling you the same,&quot; Eric smiled to her, &quot;with some things being a bit odd... like the no shame issue... but none of it is bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just a part of being a were,&quot; Julie smiled as she began to lead Eric out of the cabana, with both of them carrying their bags, &quot;and it isn&#39;t like we have much to be ashamed of... You&#39;re a very handsome weremer, Eric. You have every reason to be proud in your form... regardless of whether or not you&#39;re transformed or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric found himself blushing heavily, which only made Julie giggle when she noticed. Her laugh made Eric feel better and the two of them made their way inside from the cabana in the backyard. They found Melissa Stovall working quietly in the kitchen with what smelled like pancakes, fruit, and sausage patties. It smelled good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s good to see that you&#39;re up,&quot; Melissa commented, &quot;and I trust that nothing has changed since yesterday?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Other than our love growing stronger?&quot; Julie answered, &quot;No... though we are looking forward to a happy future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Junior and Melinda?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
Melissa managed to stifle a chuckle as both young weremers looked a bit surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;The intercom button must have stuck,&quot; Melissa said to them, &quot;I&#39;d just ask that you both WAIT to start your family until your older.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve both seemed older in our dreams,&quot; Eric commented, &quot;like we&#39;re in our twenties or thirties...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just remember that while your lifespan has extended by becoming a were, your aging is going to stay the same as a normal&#39;s until you turn either eighteen or twenty,&quot; Melissa spoke, &quot;so that could mean that if Julie becomes pregnant now... in seven years you&#39;d look like you&#39;re in your twenties with a seven year old son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did take my pill for today, mom,&quot; Julie told her, &quot;you don&#39;t have to worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I have to,&quot; Melissa smiled and then then rubbed Julie&#39;s head, &quot;I&#39;m your mom. They&#39;d take away my &quot;mother&#39;s licence&quot; if I didn&#39;t worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be careful,&quot; Eric promised, &quot;as... I don&#39;t think either of us are ready to be parents yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie nodded in agreement. With that Melissa gave a small smile and felt some relief at that. She could easily see that the two of them were destined for each other based on what Julie had told her about her relations with Eric and how the two acted together. Eric might still be adapting to how open many things in Moon Lake were with regard to sexuality and so forth. She mentally chuckled remembering once asking Martin if Moon Lake was founded by hippies before she found out about weres as she thought about many of the things that Eric would be adapting. In time, Eric would be like just about every other were in Moon Lake that had once been a normal from outside it. The main thing that she hoped for was that Eric and Julie remembered to take it easy and tried their best not to get too into the more &quot;adult&quot; aspects of life that married, and even a fair number of unmarried, weres engaged in. She knew she couldn&#39;t stop them, but she also knew they would have centuries for that. It wouldn&#39;t necessarily hurt either of them to wait or to at least limit the amount of love-making that the two of them engaged in.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Melissa commented, &quot;pancakes are almost ready... there is some independent fruit slices along with some sausage patties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Julie and Eric both said together.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what&#39;s the plan for today?&quot; Melissa wondered as she moved to place servings on a set of plates sitting on the island in the Stovall&#39;s kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;We figured we&#39;d go for a nice walk and enjoy life,&quot; Eric commented, &quot;enjoy being together... and let me get a look at Moon Lake now that I&#39;m a were now myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie squeezed his hand lovingly with a devoted smile, and was something that Melissa didn&#39;t miss. It reminded her of when she and Martin were dating. Eric was quite a handsome young man, even before he became a weremer. He wasn&#39;t as handsome as Martin was to her eyes, but to Melissa no one could be as handsome as her own husband, her own one true love. However, that didn&#39;t mean that Melissa couldn&#39;t be happy for Julie finding such a polite young man for her own one true love. There might be a lot that she personally worried over, but that didn&#39;t change that she was happy for Julie and Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll be very nice for the both of you,&quot; Melissa spoke with a smile as Eric and Julie collected their plates and the three of them headed for the dining room to have brunch, where margarine and syrup were already waiting. As they arrived, Melissa then asked, &quot;what will you two want to drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Milk would be fine,&quot; Julie spoke. Eric nodded.<br />
<br />
The two of them sat down to brunch while Melissa went back to the kitchen to get two glasses of milk and to retrieve her coffee.</p>
