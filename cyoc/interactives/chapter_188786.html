<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the car approaches the town, you notice more and more that all of the residence walking on the side walks are large breasted women. Actually, you haven&#39;t seen a single man at all. It is all women. Many of them even appear pregnant, so there must be some men around somewhere. But even what appears to be dating or married couples are entirely all women. <br />
<br />
Another thing you notice is that apparently, cow print is in high fashion. Every single woman is wearing at least something cow print, and many even have a bell around their necks, though it appears more for show as the clappers have been removed in them. And speaking of unusual fashion trends, a number of women have their septum pierced with a larger golden ring too. It is like they are trying to actually promote the cow motif. The last of the similarities in terms of fashion are that everyone seems to be wearing black high heels, black gloves and varied amount of cow costume parts, particularly the tail, horns, and the ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, am I missing something here? Why is there all these women wearing cow themed outfits? Is there some kind of cow celebration going on or something?&quot; You ask very confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;A celebration? Not that I know of at least. It looks like everything is just as it always is around here to me. Oh, but I guess to someone who isn&#39;t aware yet, this must look extremely unusual! Right, this town is the dairy production center of the entire country. I think 100% of all residence are women too. And this place has a few... unique rules, but everyone seems to be fully supportive of them.&quot; explains the driver. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unique rules?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, things like you must not leave your stall without your ID bell, and you must be clothed when someone is visiting or arriving to town when you go out. Yeah, normally, almost everyone here is perfectly ok with being naked. But they all put on clothing for whenever I make a trip here so as to not disturb any of my passengers. No need to worry though, everyone here is very friendly, though they can be a bit too curious about new people they haven&#39;t seen before. And a fair warning. Licking here is considered more of a sign of friendship than anywhere else. So be prepared to be licked and expected to return the licking quite often with your new friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Licking?? That sounds kinda... gross.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! That&#39;s what they all say at first, but I have yet to see anyone who lives here not take to the custom almost immediately, or at least within the first week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok...&quot; You are not sure what to say in response to that. So you just keep watching the various women pass by as you ride through the town.  &quot;Hey, you said something earlier about changing to &#39;fit in&#39;? What did you mean by that exactly. I know you said it should be pretty apparent by now, but I still dont quite understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, well, I guess it isn&#39;t too obvious, seeing as it is not something exactly <i>normal</i>. Basically you will, over the course of about half a month, be turned into a cow girl like the rest of the women here, and join them in the dairy production workforce. But just to be clear, by cow girl, I do not mean the compliment to a cowboy. I mean a girl with real, functioning cow parts and traits. You see how all of these women have cow ears and tails? Those are not costume parts. Those lady&#39;s who look pregnant? They are simply covering up their udder is all. The big secret is that the majority of the country&#39;s milk isn&#39;t milked from a cow, but instead, milked from a woman. Isn&#39;t it fascinating? And don&#39;t worry. You are pretty handsome, so you will definitely turn out to be quite the beautiful cowgirl. And I peeked at your file before we left. Your genetics apparently will make you grow a nice and large pair too. Honestly, if what is projected on the file is true, then I think your tits might be larger than all of the ones on the women we have passed by so far. Not by a large amount, but definitely up their with the bigger ones. And if you are worried about becoming a fat cow, then don&#39;t be. As you can see, hardly anyone here is considered overweight. All of the excess body fat and such is actually just turned into more milk you see. So the more you eat, the more you the more milk you will produce. Though do keep it in some moderation, as not everything can be converted into milk. So unless you love spending the entire day on the toilet, don&#39;t just endlessly stuff your face either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, I think I am going to be sick.&quot; You say as your face turns pale. You are going to be turned into a cow girl? Why would the company send you here to do this and not tell you about it? No, they couldn&#39;t tell you or of course you would have never agreed to go here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, its too late to turn back now. This is your new life. Everything already has been taken care of and processed by now. So you better get use to the idea quickly. It isn&#39;t nearly that bad of a thing either. Didn&#39;t you notice how almost no one here seemed unhappy? This place is a literal paradise for cow girls. You will adjust soon enough.&quot; Said the driver. He then didn&#39;t say a word more for the rest of the trip. <br />
<br />
Eventually you left the town center and moved to what you guessed to be the housing section. Instead of normal houses, all of them were barn shaped. Many had their door wide open allowing you to see inside. Each of them were an open concept, much like a barn is. And had the full range of promised furniture. There was no bed though. But you soon understood that the &quot;bed&quot; was just the hay pile inside of the barn stalls lining the one wall. <br />
<br />
You were brought up to a rather larger barn than what you have seen so far. It was even up on top of a small hill too. It clearly was much taller, meaning that it even had a second story. The driver got out and opened up your door while saying, &quot;This is your new home. Your items have already been delivered, so all you have to do is claim the last unclaimed stall in side. The others should be eager to meet you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! Others??&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, you have 3 others who are sharing this home with you. Why did you think this barn was so large? You are to become the one of our top milk producers, thus you get a nicer place to live as a bonus. The other 3 here are also 3 of our most productive cow girls. I hope you all can get along nicely. Oh, and feel free to fuck them, while you still can that is. It&#39;s not like you could impregnate them anyways. So don&#39;t try and hold yourself back since you don&#39;t have protection if one of them offers. And I am dead serious. They cannot be impregnated by any human man. Only an actual bull has that ability now. So just go and have fun.&quot; And with that said, the driver gets back into his car and takes off, leaving you standing there alone in front of the large barn door.</p>
