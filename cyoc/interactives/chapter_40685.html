<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">... become my twin sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at Maggie in surprise. She wanted me to become her sister? I had to wonder if this had anything to do with her being an only child. &quot;Are you sure that's what you want?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I am&quot; Maggie said with a grin. &quot;I think that you'll make a great sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; I began. I didn't get any further as I couldn't find a reason not to. I didn't have any kids or a girlfriend so I wouldn't be leaving them. My parents died when I was twenty-five and I don't have any grandparents either. My brother is the only one of my family that I'd be leaving behind but we hadn't spoken in so long that it's like I didn't have a brother. My brother would do fine without me. If I was looking for family to be an excuse I couldn't find it there. James would still be in my life but as my dad instead of my best friend. Emily would be my mom. Also, if I was honest with myself I was always curious what it would be like to be a girl.<br />
<br />
Maggie seemed to be growing impatient with my indecision. She looked at me with her arms crossed and asked &quot;Well? If you're not going to make the wish give me the ring and I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled and said &quot;I'll make the wish. I just need to think how to word it. We don't want anything to go wrong now do we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maggie sighed and said &quot;I guess not.&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought about how I would word the wish. There was something that I needed to know so I asked &quot;Do you want me to be your fraternal twin or identical twin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the difference?&quot; Maggie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I was your fraternal twin I'd look different than you even though we were born at the same time&quot; I explained. &quot;If I was your identical twin I would look almost exactly like you. I may have a different hairstyle than you or I may wear different clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don't want someone looking exactly like me&quot; Maggie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I'll make sure that I specify that I'm your fraternal twin sister&quot; I said and smiled. I thought that I had the right words for the wish and so said &quot;I wish that I am Margaret May Sharp's fraternal twin sister and that no one, except for myself and Margaret May Sharp, have memories of me being anything other than Margaret May Sharp's fraternal twin sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as I finished making the wish my clothes disappeared leaving me completely naked. It was a bit embarrassing but I figured it was fair since Maggie had been completely naked herself because of a wish of mine. A tingling sensation spread throughout my body like my whole body had fallen asleep. As such I couldn't feel the changes happen but I could see them. My dick shrank until it looked like it was gone while my balls pulled inside my body. My ball sack shrank. The skin around my ball sack grew over my ball sack. What remained of my ball sack stuck out a bit from the fold of skin. This moved down to between my legs becoming my new pussy. I watched as my body slimmed down to feminine proportions. The body hair I had retracted into my body leaving it smooth. A lock of hair fell into my view and it was a lighter red than Maggie's. My nipples grew and mounds formed beneath them until I had what I thought were B sized breasts. I knew my face had changed but I couldn't see or feel it.<br />
<br />
The tingling left my body and I was standing there in the park, a naked thirteen year old girl. I wasn't left naked for long though as clothes started to appear on me. The first things to appear were a pair of low cut pink panties and matching bra. A pink v-neck appeared next and then a denim skirt. I felt my hair pulled back and I guessed that a hair tie had appeared. I felt a minuscule weight on my ears and figured that I had a pair of earrings in my ears. A pair of brown sandals appeared on my feet. I noticed that my toenails were painted a light pink and looked at my fingernails to see if they were painted too and they were. Finally a purse appeared slung over my shoulder.<br />
<br />
I looked at Maggie and realized that we were wearing about the same thing except her v-neck was yellow and she was wearing denim shorts. She had a look of utter shock on her face. It was a few minutes before she could speak. When she did she asked &quot;Is that... is that really you Rick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it is&quot; I said surprised by how high my voice sounded. &quot;You saw me change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I just can't believe this!&quot; Maggie said sounding a little excited. &quot;I finally have a sister. Look in your purse for your school id. I want to know your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
I opened my purse and dug around inside it until I found what I was looking for. Taking it out I said &quot;Well according to this I'm Miranda Ann Sharp.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's a nice name&quot; Maggie said. &quot;Can you make it so we have memories of you being my sister while still leaving our memories of you before your change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I should be able to&quot; I said lowering my head in thought. After a few moments I looked back up, realizing that I had shrunk a bit, and said &quot;I wish that Margaret May Sharp and I have memories of me being Miranda Ann Sharp while retaining our memories of me as I was before my last wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt a sense of vertigo as new memories came flooding into my mind. As soon as it subsided I said &quot;Well that was strange. Are you alright Maggie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm ok Randi&quot; Maggie said. &quot;That was weird though. What are you going to do with your ring now?&quot;<br />
<br />
I shrugged y shoulders and said &quot;I'm not sure. Did you have something in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maggie looked at me with a grin on her face and said &quot;I do have something in mind. Why don't you wish...</p>
