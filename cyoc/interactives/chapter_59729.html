<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as Kat said &quot;I'll turn you into a donkey!&quot; Dan was immediately <br />
turned into a donkey! One second her fully-clothed brother was <br />
standing in front of her, the next, an ugly smelly &quot;naked&quot; donkey.<br />
<br />
After hearing the word &quot;donkey&quot; Dan immediately felt dizzy, so he shut <br />
his eyes. As soon as the feeling passed, he opened them again, and his <br />
vision was somehow strangely altered. He could see from two different <br />
directions, with a rather large blind spot directly in front of him. <br />
All the colors he was used to seeing, were also all washed out, giving <br />
him a black-white, and gray color range. <br />
<br />
Wanting to ask &quot;What happened?&quot; Dan only heard the sounds of a jackass <br />
escaping his mouth. His mouth! Speaking of which, his mouth felt very <br />
strange. It was almost as if it was stuffed with cotton. Attempting <br />
once again to speak, Dan could only bray like the jackass he was <br />
discovering he was turned into in the matter of the blink of an eye. <br />
<br />
Craning his neck behind him, he saw the elongated body of an <br />
equine,with a long ropey tail with a tassel on the end at the rear end <br />
swaying back and forth. Making another futile effort at speech, he <br />
brayed some more.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Kat was standing there, watching her brother's antics, <br />
discovering himself. Laughing, Kat told Dan &quot;Hahaha, now you can <br />
actually sound and act like what you really are! You jackass! hahaha!&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting scared and angry, he wanted to tell his sister to turn him <br />
back! But once again, only made the &quot;Heee haaaww&quot; sounds that he was <br />
now only capable of. Hearing those sounds come out of his mouth, Dan <br />
started to get desperate. He wanted to to say at least one word in <br />
English. His attempts at speaking resulted in more &quot;hawwwing&quot; than <br />
&quot;heeing&quot; as he breathed out, trying to make the sounds of words. <br />
Reaching forward with his front right hoof (which was about to hit him <br />
that he no longer had hands!) he started falling to the right. <br />
Catching himself with his hoof, the sound on the sidewalk rang loudly <br />
in his now over-sized ears. <br />
<br />
Letting out a pathetic little &quot;haawww&quot; as his way of sighing, Dan <br />
thought &quot;If she doesn't turn me back, the rest of my life is gonna <br />
suck! What am I supposed to do? Just stand around all day, doing <br />
nothing? I suppose that's what all donkeys do anyway.&quot; <br />
<br />
Thinking about his former fingers, he can still &quot;feel&quot; them on the <br />
ends of his &quot;hands.&quot; He wanted to stretch his fingers, because it was <br />
starting to feel sort of cramped down there in a strange sort of way, <br />
knowing they are now just hooves. His former arms (now legs) just end <br />
in a couple of blocky immobile hooves. He also wanted to stand <br />
straight up and down, rather than remain quadruped. His teeth and <br />
tongue also felt obnoxiously over-sized. He now has the nasty mouth of <br />
a big-old smelly donkey, hooves on the ends of legs rather than hands <br />
attached to arms, and can only stand on all fours! <br />
<br />
Feeling more and more trapped inside of this disgusting beast, his <br />
penis started to get aroused. The more he thought of being trapped as <br />
a donkey, the harder and longer his new penis became. The arousal <br />
started becoming so overwhelming, he wanted to reach back and grab it. <br />
Alas, he couldn't even really move his front legs in that direction <br />
all that well, leaving him feeling more trapped than ever.  <br />
<br />
Getting desperate, as his penis got longer and he got hornier than <br />
ever, he started braying again, wanting out of this horrible body, and <br />
back to his normal life again. The only thing keeping him sane, was <br />
the thoughts of his parents. If Kat became a witch at the age of 18, <br />
then mom was probably one as well, and would turn him back when she <br />
got home. All he had to do was remain as patient as possible. <br />
<br />
As Dan was concentrating on his own internal thoughts, Kat was taking <br />
a stroll around her brother with a video camera, looking him up and <br />
down. She spotted his totally engorged penis, which was several feet <br />
long! Laughing about this, she said &quot;you're really enjoying this, <br />
aren't you? You should see your HUGE penis! Jeez, boys are <br />
disgusting.&quot;<br />
<br />
She came back around with the camera, pointing it at his face, and <br />
said &quot;smile! You're on TV!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing her say this, and forgetting he lost the ability to talk, he <br />
opened his huge mouth to ask her....plead with her....to end this <br />
living nightmare. But once again, all that came out, was a horrible <br />
&quot;Heeee-Haaaww, Heee-Haaawww!&quot; as his new, huge, blocky and yellow <br />
teeth were displayed for all the world to see, especially that camera!<br />
And to make matters worse, he was standing there feeling naked <br />
(because he was,) knowing she had to have captured the largest most <br />
obnoxious erection of his life!</p>
