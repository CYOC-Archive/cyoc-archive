<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Midwest America, 1983<br />
<br />
<br />
Paul was a nerd with glasses, and he wasn&#39;t popular. His bullies often called him &quot;Paula&quot; and he wasn&#39;t popular at school. He was often teased and harassed. Every day brought new torments from a dozen different jerks that loved to push him around. It had not been great for him before in grade 5 but when he began attending the junior high, which was grades 6 to 8, he found himself surrounded by a sea of taller boys that all saw him as an easy target. Even fat kids that got made fun of could push him around. <br />
<br />
Paul&#39;s life was a living hell. His parents were both alcoholics and his father was in jail. His mother was often spending time in bars trying to attract a boyfriend. Her boyfriends usually only lasted a few months. Kids at school called his mother a whore just to make Paul cry. Paul lived in a trailer park, and his only consolation was books. <br />
<br />
Paul&#39;s mother gave him ten dollars, which was a lot of money for Paul, for his birthday. He went inside an old shop to buy some nature magazines. What he found instead was a blank journal with no title, an old but thin leather tome that said on page 1 &quot;think about what you want to know and then turn the page&quot;. He did so, automatically wondering if any of his bullies was going to wind up in prison for assault some day. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bruno Pitts and Bradford Franco will both go to jail. Bruno Pitts will go to jail for assault when he is 19 and spend two years in prison. Bradford Franco will spend ten years in jail for accidental manslaughter, sentenced at age 24. Do you wish to amend this history?&quot; <br />
<br />
Paul blinked. What? Was...this book magic? He began breathing heavily. There was no price sticker on the book so he peeled one off of another book and slapped it on the journal, rushed to the counter and paid a few dollars for it before hastily leaving. He felt like he was getting away with something. Whoever had left this book would probably want it back. Paul was very highly intelligent and assumed that any kind of magical book could help him no matter what...his life was garbage...how could it get worse?<br />
<br />
He went to the railroad underpass where homeless guys sometimes slept. It was his secret hiding place. He got out the book and a pencil and wrote down &quot;How do I amend history?&quot; <br />
<br />
The book responded by writing automatically in the same old fashioned font it had been communicating: &quot;You can change the settings for your current universe to shift into another. Would you like a list of options?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; he automatically wrote. A few pages filled in with options such as worlds where dinosaurs still existed, where the Roman Empire never fell, where men could get pregnant and women had penises, where blacks were still slaves, where whites were slaves, where poor people of all colors were slaves, where everyone sang in musical numbers...the list went on. His eyes bulged. He began to think. He turned the page.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I request a universe based upon my own criteria?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; the book replied.   <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to go to a universe where boys with glasses are bigger and stronger...the biggest and strongest men usually have glasses. We grow faster than other boys and are adult sized by the age of 9 so everyone is real nice to us. We don&#39;t even have to work out, we just have big muscles but if we work out we can become even bigger. And we can get jobs and not go to school. We get better vision later in life, but we are very popular and boys who can see just fine will wear glasses just to be like us.&quot; <br />
<br />
He blinked. &quot;Are you finished with parameters?&quot; the book asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;No. I want one more thing. Bruno and all my other bullies are now fags.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you finished with parameters?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m also rich, and all my bullies from this universe are poor....and they do everything I say.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you finished with parameters?&quot; <br />
<br />
Paul thought about it. His heart was racing. &quot;Yes.&quot; <br />
<br />
There was a flash of light.  He stood up. He was still at the underpass but he was wearing a dress shirt and tie, which strained against his magnificent body. His muscles heaved as he walked, his thunderous muscular football player thighs straining against the fabric. True, men with glasses couldn&#39;t see as well as normal men until they hit their 30s but they were still sought after athletes, and Paul was no exception. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I play football?&quot; a stranger asked. The voice was coming out of his mouth but sounded like some kind of movie actor. <br />
<br />
I have to get back to my car, he thought. Car?? I&#39;m only 11 years old...and I&#39;ve had that car for two years now! <br />
<br />
Reality had changed. He walked back to his car, the Jaguar was his fuck car and brought him all the pussy he could possibly want, along with his enormous frame. He looked at himself in the rearview mirror. He looked to be about 20 years old, with stubble and he remembered that he was 6&#39;3&quot; now. He confidently drove to school. He was a businessman giving a speech there for career day, and he got along well with the principal of the school when he had offered to come talk about the responsibilities of being a young Superior in society. That&#39;s what they called men with glasses. Superiors. He was highly intelligent as all men with glasses were, and considered to be an adult by the age of 7. He had zoomed through college and was the youngest employee at the local fruit juice company here in town. He was financially independent from his mother and he lived in a house that he had purchased just the previous year. <br />
<br />
He noticed the fags right away. Bruno and Bradford were now Runtboy and Dudford according to everyone. Those were the names everyone called them. He smiled. Fags like them deserved it, though. <br />
<br />
Fags, he realized, had their place in society. There were rules for them, and they almost always were attracted to and wanted to serve and be submissive to men with glasses, who were the clear Superiors in society. All of his former bullies were scrawny and effeminate faggots, limp wristed and practically begging to be fucked as they sashayed their 13 year old asses across the schoolyard hoping to attract attention from the bigger and stronger boys. Being gay was a little bit more common, Paul realized with shock. Straight men often received blow jobs from fags, especially Superior men with glasses.<br />
<br />
There were a few men in the school that had chosen to be there, all of them wearing glasses. They were all muscular studs, bigger than everyone else topping out at 6 feet but often taller than that. They all gave Paul approving nods. Some men with glasses kept going through the school system at a normal pace because they liked dominating the younger boys around them and the schools encouraged this because men with glasses qualified for sports teams and often gave their schools a HUGE advantage. Most men with glasses went to college and the average age for graduation with a degree was 14. But Paul was a whiz kid, and he made a lot of money. He was practically made of money. Everyone looked at him with lust, especially the female teachers who he noticed were flirting with him when he introduced himself. They used to look down on him and now they couldn&#39;t be more turned on, he thought, and realized he wanted to fuck a few of them. He had never had sex before in his own universe and he couldn&#39;t wait to go home and strip naked to see what he was packing!<br />
<br />
In his house (HIS HOUSE!) he found that he could strip quite comfortably while being amazed at his new body. He was absolutely gorgeous. His body rippled everywhere. He was the definition of manhood now. The scale told him he was 289 pounds. It angered him that he wasn&#39;t up to 300 pounds yet, but he just had to eat more and try to work out more than three times a week, his doctor had told him. His dick was also magnificent. 11 inches. Incredible. He touched himself and it sprang to life. He had never even jerked off before. He hadn&#39;t entered puberty before and...<br />
<br />
Sensations overwhelmed him as well as thoughts of fucking women supermodels and all those little fags that used to make fun of him. He thought of fucking Bruno and Bradford in their new sissy bodies in front of his former teachers, thinking about them laughing at their tiny little baby dicks. Runtboy and Dudford sucking his cock...the thought was overwhelming as well as the thought of fucking Miss Marlin who taught health in front of them both, fucking her lithe frame as she screamed his name and begged for his cum while Runtboy and Dudford touched themselves...<br />
<br />
He screamed and a half pint full of cum jettisoned onto his bathroom mirror. He flexed a bicep and jerked off with his other hand. He was so hot now, it was unbearable! 21 inch arms! He was a total stud! A fucking MAN!!!! He continued pumping cum everywhere and it sprayed on the wall, the toilet, the sink....by the time he was done his bathroom was spattered with cum eveywhere. <br />
<br />
The cleaning lady will get all this, he thought nonchalantly. That&#39;s what I pay her for, after all...<br />
<br />
What should I do next? he wondered lasciviously.</p>
