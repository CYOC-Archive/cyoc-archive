<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The 3 of them were now inside the cabin. Dr Jenkins currently was on her hands and knees underneath Prince, who was sitting on her bac while Princess was eagerly giving him a blowjob, which had been going on steadily for the last 20 minutes. Apparently, something had gone very wrong with her. But her former boss had apparently taken quite a liking to this new Princess though. <br />
<br />
Speaking of her former boss, she was completely, mentally fine. However, she had started to like being male, so she ensured that she first corrected Dr Jenkins&#39; mental image of her, replacing it with her new, male body, while also adopting Prince as her current temporary name. She also didn&#39;t mind being considered male, even if she still looked mostly female, if you could just ignored her giant horsecock, or her softball sized balls that is. Her face had returned back to her normal female one, and although she clearly had lost a few sizes, her boobs were technically still there. But her current AA-cups were no where near their original size. It did hurt her initial pride, but once her horsecock began getting sucked by Princess, she no longer cared, having realized that having balls of this size was way better. <br />
<br />
Apart from that, she had similar features to Dr Jenkins. Horse tail, hoof toes, hoof fingers, plant exclusive diet, the works. On the other hand, Princess had almost completely returned to being human. But she had become a women, not the former male she use to be. Her large, black horse pussy, quadropeddle preference (she can easily walk on 2 legs, but greatly prefers to be on 4), heat cycle, blond hair (blond horse tail too), and even her mating mannerisms such as presenting her soaking wet, winking pussy to Prince when horny or the fact that she had completely accepted the submissive role to Prince, declaring him her mate for life even.<br />
<br />
The former male had completely assimilated with Princess, and had been overwritten entirely. Dr Jenkins believed that if given the time, she could seperate them once again, saving the male, but Prince had vehemently refused to allow it. <br />
<br />
Currently, Prince had complete authority over Princess, and now Dr Jenkins as well. She didn&#39;t want to admit it before, but when Prince&#39;s transformation had finished, she had nearly orgasmed from the scent of his ball sweat alone. Seeing the horsecock had finally broken her last mental restraint on her ever growing heat. She had desperately needed someone to fuck her at that time, and Prince was more than willing, as long as Dr Jenkins agreed to become his sex slave mate, along with Princess, who at that time, had immediately submitted her all over to him happily. <br />
<br />
If she was asked to describe how she felt after being fucked by Prince, Dr Jenkins would have simply answered &quot;full&quot;. It was no joke either. Her cow pussy was packed to the very limit with Prince&#39;s horse jizz. It felt like she had no room left for anything. That feeling was extremely satisfying too. Like she had done a good job with being a breeding cow for Prince. And that her soon to be pregnant self was finally able to be claimed by a proper mate. She could only agree with Princess about this. It felt extremely comfortable knowing you were the mate of such a powerful male. <br />
<br />
The feeling of his gigantic balls resting on your back was heavenly. She would now gladly become Prince&#39;s ball shelf again when asked. Her purpose in life no longer just was about curing herself. She was Princes second wife, brood mate of his pack. She would be his baby factory since Princess was tasked with being his sex doll. A role even she felt suited her best. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think you need a proper name Dr&quot; Prince announced. &quot;From now on you are to be called Alice. Please keep that in mind when we go out for food and such, Alice.&quot; Alice could only accepts her new identity. At least Alice was a pretty name. &quot;Oh, and also make sure you don&#39;t somehow cure us entirely. I want my cock to be exactly as it is. Same with the 2 pussies I have at my disposal, understand?&quot; Barked Prince.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand dear, I wouldn&#39;t dream of removing it. It is as much of a gift to us as it is to you&quot; you respond. You were not lying either. You both practically worshiped it.</p>
