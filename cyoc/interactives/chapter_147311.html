<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve woke to something shining in his face. His head was still foggy from waking up but he guessed it was the sun. He groaned before sitting up and stretching. He scratched his head and quickly began to freak out as he felt his suddenly very long hair. Then his mind caught up and he sighed as he realized it wasn&#39;t all just some crazy dream. <br />
<br />
His life changed so that the world thought Steve was always a woman, despite what his genitals might say. He turned to see his wife, Janet, sleeping still in the passenger seat. He didn&#39;t want to tell her since she was already pissed enough, but Steve was not a fan of the beard she had magically grown. <br />
<br />
Glancing back, he saw his daughter snoring with her new boyish haircut, and his son sleeping soundly in his cheerleader dress. Steve hated that this happened. He hated that he had no idea what was going on. He hated that all his body hair was gone and the makeup still stuck on his face, and the panties and everything else that the book did.<br />
<br />
He saw that Janet had fallen asleep with the book and that she definitely would not appreciate being woken up after the night they had. Steve decided to pass the time by having fun with his reflection. He looked in his side mirror and saw that woman that so looked like him staring back. Even if she did look a ton like him, Steve still found her attractive.<br />
<br />
He lifted himself up slightly and saw her massive rack staring back. He looked back again to make sure Janet was still asleep, and then gleefully turned back to the mirror. &quot;I guess it&#39;s not all bad.&quot; He thought as he began to play with them. It was weird. He still had his male pecs, but when he moved them, his reflection did the equivalent but with large knockers.<br />
<br />
Steve jiggled them around for a minute before he got bored and decided to see what else had changed. Janet had shown him the picture already but he wondered if it was just images. Unfortunately, that wasn&#39;t the case as Steve opens &quot;his&quot; purse to find tons of stuff that definitely wasn&#39;t his and wasn&#39;t Janet&#39;s. After looking for another minute, he finally found a driver&#39;s license. It was a photo of his female self. The stuff that likely could be the same was stuff like age and home address, but all the other changes freaked him out.<br />
<br />
The gender read female, the height and weight were totally different, and instead of &quot;Steven Donaldson&quot; it now read &quot;Stephanie McCoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.&quot; Steve thought to himself. &quot;McCoy was Janet&#39;s last name before we married. I guess it&#39;s my name now. This is crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Steve could explore further, he heard a yawn next to him. Janet rubbed her eyes as she sat up and stretched. As she blinked her eyes toward Steve, her happy morning smile slowly shifted to a fearful glare. She sat back and groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God.&quot; She said aloud. &quot;It wasn&#39;t a dream. I actually have a beard.&quot; She whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry honey, but magic is apparently real.&quot; He sort of joked.<br />
<br />
The kids woke up soon after with similar opinions to that of their parents. After a few minutes of debating and whining, Steve decided he had enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;-and I&#39;m dressed like a stupid cheerleader!&quot; Alan finished complaining.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright. I know you may be dressed like a girl but you&#39;re still my son. No more whining, from any of you!&quot; He screamed. The car seemed to quickly simmer down before he continued again. &quot;Now we&#39;re gonna go back home, and in the comfort of our own freaking house, we&#39;re gonna figure out what happened and fix this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t we try it now?&quot; Megan asked, trying not to sound too whiny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I&#39;m your father, and I know what&#39;s best.&quot; He commanded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Technically Mom is the father now.&quot; Alan mumbled under his breath. Steve just stared and Alan averted his gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; He continued, &quot;If everyone is done making slide remarks, I&#39;d like to get out of this dress now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve, somehow in a dress, managed to change their tire before hoping back in. He started the car up and steered the car back onto the road. The family was mostly silent on the way back. Partially to avoid pissing off Steve more and partially because they were too busy looking at their warped reflections. As Steve drove he kept trying to hide his head behind the frame of the car window. He knew others didn&#39;t see him as a guy in girls clothing, but it didn&#39;t stop him from turning a little red.<br />
<br />
After another hour of driving, they finally pulled up to their little suburban home. They were all relieved to get away from that dingy house and couldn&#39;t wait to get inside. They all quickly ran inside, somewhat due to excitement but also due to embarrassment as they all stormed in and shut the door.<br />
<br />
Steve and Janet sat down at the kitchen counter with the book as Alan and Megan watched. They only watched for a minute, however, before both realized that their parents weren&#39;t going to try to use the book yet. After watching them walk off, Janet and Steve finally got to talk without worrying about what the kids would hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Janet, what the fuck is going on?!&quot; He whispered loudly. &quot;I mean...&quot; He began before tugging at his new dress &quot;...what the hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you said, I guess magic is real. Holy shit.&quot; She said as she leaned back in the chair. <br />
<br />
Steve stared as she did so since she was no longer wearing a bra, and Steve wanted some fun out of the situation. Janet noticed and slapped him on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve, focus. We have to figure this thing out before our friends or relatives stop by or something!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think that would matter too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Janet asked. Steve pulled out the purse and then his new license. Janet read all the little changes and looked back up in awe. &quot;What are you saying Steve?&quot; She asked, clearly spooked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- I think this thing changes reality itself. Like, up until this morning, I had sorta hoped that we had accidentally sniffed some drugs or something. But, after seeing the photo, my license, and even people on the road, I think the world has really changed and what we see in the mirror is what others see and remember.&quot; He explained.<br />
<br />
The two sat back for a moment before Janet reached into her pocket and pulled out her differently colored phone. Steve stared in confusion before figuring it out as Janet suddenly said &quot;Hi, uh, mom.&quot; Steve wanted to keep listening but Megan and Alan suddenly came running down, both looking pissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad dad!&quot; They both yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;All our stuff is different!&quot; Megan yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean your stuff changed? Like to match your clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Alan yelled. &quot;All my clothes are dresses or girly skirts, my room is pink, and all my freaking games are gone! Where my Ps4 and Switch normally sit just had pompoms and makeup!&quot; He sadly yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;All my clothes are stupid boy clothes, and my boyband posters are replaced with stupid wrestling stuff.&quot; Megan exclaimed, practically crying.<br />
<br />
As Steve tried to console them, Janet walked over looking baffled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Janet? Are you okay?&quot; Steve asked worried.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not really. I just called my mother. She called me, Jake. She thinks I&#39;m a man.&quot; She said quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Alan asked. &quot;If Grandma thinks you&#39;re a man. Then she also thinks me and dad are girls, and Megan is a boy! Then... does the whole world think this is normal?!&quot; He yelled confused.<br />
<br />
Nobody answered him. It didn&#39;t need to be said. They all quietly sat down at the kitchen counter. They all stared blankly for a while, before finally snapping out of it, and then looking down at the book that had caused all this.</p>
