<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Bunni!&quot; came Owen&#39;s voice ringing through the apartment in Lyre that had been arranged for the two of them.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t big and most of the furniture that came with it had actually come from the foster residence where Owen had lived, and nearly all of that was in the room that Bunni had set aside for Owen. There were some things that Bunni had bought for herself and for a general set up to start with, mostly through some of the modelling money that had been made. Animalia wasn&#39;t strictly known for business wear, and to some extent Bunni felt that Animalia leaned far too liberally with regard to things related to sex and sexuality. Being a statuesque rabbit woman did NOT mean she had to wear V-neck shirts that gave everyone a view of her cleavage. <br />
<br />
Most of those that did dress more conservatively when it came to more formal occasions were those that were either working for Horizon or in Animalia&#39;s city government, which technically meant there was a market for the clothing, but there just weren&#39;t the models available for it. With her drive to care for Owen and give him the loving home that people seemed unable or unwilling to give them, Bunni had agreed to provide a few shoots for that sort of business formal wear that would show and demonstrate that Animalians could dress appropriately to set a good example for others and for children. It had earned enough to pay for the apartment&#39;s rent, the furniture, and to secure Owen a safe place that the state of Nevada was confident in allowing Owen into Bunni&#39;s care. She might have to participate in some more shoots as time went on as new suits were devised, but that would go a long way to help pay for the college courses she was taking online to help her work her way toward a child-therapy license.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m in the kitchen, Owen!&quot; Bunni called back to him and soon heard the patter of feet as Owen came from the living room into the kitchen. As he entered, Bunni looked over to him and asked, &quot;what is it dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just wondering something,&quot; Owen answered, but didn&#39;t elaborate on what he was wondering on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wondering on what?&quot; Bunni asked as she turned to look to the boy who&#39;d owned her as a pet and had loved her. She knew that much, and she remembered him looking so scared when she was sick. She remembered seeing family after family come and look at Owen and for some reason decide not to adopt him. Some of it may have been finances, but it only reinforced the image in Bunni&#39;s mind that Owen needed close care and parental love, someone to love and protect him. And given how he&#39;d doted on her when she was a mundane pet rabbit, part Blanc de Termonde and Argente Clair with the likely possibility that somewhere in her family tree there was some Flemish Giant Rabbit. She couldn&#39;t quite tell always why families had passed over Owen, but she could tell that he was a kind and loving young boy, and after her uplifting, saving her from Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease, Bunni was determined to return the favor and give Owen a loving home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Owen said slowly, &quot;on why you haven&#39;t gone looking for a Mr. Bunni.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bunni blinked with some surprise, but didn&#39;t say anything. Technically it would be Mr. Clair, but Owen was also young enough that it was likely that he wouldn&#39;t fully recognize the differences between first names and family names. He went with what he knew, and he knew that Bunni preferred he refer to her by her first name or by &quot;mom.&quot; He did use the latter, a lot, as Bunni did everything she could to show that she loved Owen and did a lot to make sure Owen had clothing, ate well, and got exercise. Though, there were some times when he did refer to her by her name, which often came when he had something &quot;serious&quot; on his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I have you to look after,&quot; Bunni said back and placed one hand on Owen&#39;s shoulder while setting the knife she&#39;d been using to chop lettuce with down on the cutting board, &quot;to love and raise and protect and give you all the things you need to grow up healthy and happy... and to repay you for all the love you gave me before I was uplifted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But wouldn&#39;t you want to be happy?&quot; Owen asked as he came forward and hugged Bunni, managing to get his arms around her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seeing you happy, makes me happy,&quot; Bunni answered, &quot;It shows me that I&#39;m doing the right thing in caring for you and giving you a loving home... a family that you deserve.&quot;<br />
<br />
She slowly reached down and gently rubbed Owen&#39;s back with one hand, trying to show him some assurance.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what will you do when I grow up?&quot; Owen wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take pride in all my son has achieved,&quot; Bunni answered as she lifted Owen into a hug, &quot;as any loving mother would.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... you can&#39;t have everything be &#39;bout me,&quot; Owen pointed out, &quot;all the other Animalians seem happy with each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bunni sighed at that. The line showed her just how smart Owen actually was. He wasn&#39;t a teenager and he wasn&#39;t quoting great philosophers, but he was well aware of the world around them. A day or two before, they&#39;d been by the park, where Owen was able to interact with some of Lyre and Animalia&#39;s other kids around his age, which Bunni thought had gone well. And she did notice that many Animalians seemed to pair together. She saw a pair that looked rather bird like, though their wings had three fingers on them and from a distance, it looked more like they had hair rather then feathers. They held hands as they walked along and nuzzled their straight toothed beaks together as they walked by. Bunni had to admit they looked happy, though she kept to her own personal mission of making sure that Owen got the happy home he deserved.<br />
<br />
&quot;They do indeed, Owen,&quot; Bunni answered, &quot;but many of them have only the one they&#39;re in love with and thus are quite free to pursue their romantic engagements. But, until you grow up... you&#39;re the most important person in my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But wouldn&#39;t you want someone to make you happy?&quot; Owen asked, &quot;Someone you can be with after... after I grow up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that would be nice,&quot; Bunni answered, &quot;but that would still require that that male is willing to put YOU first as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if there was one who would?&quot; Owen then asked.<br />
<br />
This made Bunni raise one eyebrow as she looked back to Owen. The young boy kept a strong hug around her legs and looked up to her and she thought she saw a hopeful smile on his face. It was nice and made her happy, as it reinforced her decision to adopt Owen for all the kindness Owen had shown her before her uplifting, however, at the moment it felt like something else was going on. She&#39;d thought she&#39;d heard a knock at the door a few moments before, but that was pretty typical. Usually it was someone dropping by a welcome gift and thus Bunni ignored it, but it was after a few moments that Owen had called for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what as gotten you so interested in playing matchmaker, Owen?&quot; Bunni asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because a big boy bunny is at the door,&quot; Owen answered, &quot;He said Horizon sent him here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bunni did her best not to faint at that answer, but it was clearly something she didn&#39;t expect to hear. Horizon had kept in touch, usually in relation to trying to find out why Bunni was as big as she was, but she didn&#39;t think that would mean they would be running a dating service. She managed to compose herself and then lead Owen through the modest Clair living room to the front door to their apartment. Once she got to the door she found a massive male rabbit Animalian. He wore pair of jeans and a tee shirt. He had brown fur with what looked like dark brown speckles in there as well. He was extremely well muscled for a Rabbit Animalian, and the most telling thing was that he was huge. In fact he even stood taller than her. He noticed her and gave a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you Bunni Clair?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Bunni said slowly, &quot;Do you need any help, sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment in just getting used to Lyre and Animalia,&quot; the male Rabbit Animalian answered, &quot;I&#39;d just been uplifted... an odd, yet interesting sensation. The people at Horizon were quite amazed by my size and said the only other Rabbit Animalian of comparable size was you... So... I thought I&#39;d come here in the hopes of looking around Animalia and see as what to see and do, as you would know what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Bunni said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And to my surprise... I was greeted by a bright young lad who seemed to be quite protective of you and even curious about me,&quot; the male Rabbit Animalian commented, &quot;and was particularly keen on wanting to make sure as to whether or not I could make you happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be my son, Owen,&quot; Bunni answered, &quot;I suppose... he&#39;s seen many of the Animalian couples since we&#39;ve moved here and he wanted me to have something comparable to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would mean he loves you, I suppose,&quot; the male Rabbit Animalian answered, &quot;because everyone wants to be happy and there is nothing wrong with that... and to be honest... if given the chance I would love to make you happy and help you with your son. He&#39;s struck me as very friendly and... well... he sort of reminds me of my brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your brother?&quot; Bunni wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the male Rabbit Animalian explained, &quot;I&#39;m a Flemish Giant Rabbit and I came from a happy home that raised the breed as pets for people. I had a brother who your son reminds me of. He was sold to a family looking for a pet rabbit before I was donated to Horizon for uplifting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your name?&quot; Bunni asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The staff called me Rockwall,&quot; the male Rabbit Animalian answered, &quot;I suppose it fits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it does,&quot; Bunni answered, &quot;why don&#39;t you come inside. I was getting some things ready for dinner. Owen and I can show you more of Animalia after that.&quot;</p>
