<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We stayed there a little longer and only when it was starting to get really dark did we decide to retire. As we had nowhere to stay and it was too dark to venture into the forest, it was decided that Angela and I would stay at Arwen&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
On the way I realized that the only source of light was a torch placed at the entrance to the houses. Arwen took my hand to make sure I wouldn&#39;t get lost.<br />
<br />
When we arrived at Arwen&#39;s house, her mother was waiting for us with dinner ready at the table, she served a mix of fruits and vegetables that I had never seen before, but that were really tasty. Later we retired, I was going to sleep with Arwen in her room and Angela was going to sleep with Wilka.<br />
<br />
Already lying in the dark room, I couldn&#39;t sleep because I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about what had happened on this day and about what the future would be like, without knowing if I could return home someday or live forever on this island.<br />
<br />
I wasn&#39;t the only one who couldn&#39;t sleep, because suddenly Arwen asked me &quot;So, Tori, what did you think of the island?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what to say about the island as I still don&#39;t know it well, but I actually liked this village. The staff here is very receptive and friendly and I like it.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad. I noticed you weren&#39;t getting any sleep and I thought there was something on the island that was bothering you.&quot; Arwen said<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see a problem with the island itself so far, but after everything that happened today I&#39;m a little unsure of what the future will be like.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand what you mean. Well, then let me help you, in this village we know something that helps a person with insomnia to sleep.&quot; Arwen said<br />
<br />
&quot;That would help a lot, I won&#39;t have a good day tomorrow if I can&#39;t sleep properly.&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
I then realized that Arwen got up from her bed and came over to me, but I was taken by surprise when she kissed me on the mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, why did you do that?&quot; I asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just a kiss to make you feel more in the mood.&quot; Arwen said and seconds later I heard her take something in the dark room, which were stones which she hit each other and with the sparks lit a lamp, which lit up the room. As soon as I could see her I noticed that she had her three dicks hard, that were not small since each one had 8, maybe even 9 inches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, do you want to have sex?&quot; I asked<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right. In addition to being very pleasurable you will be able to sleep very well afterwards.&quot; she said<br />
<br />
I was going to deny it because I have no interest in girls, but when I remembered that I was on an island where the only men were those who arrived on the same plane as me and that they would probably also change sex just like Arwen&#39;s mother, so I accepted the invitation. I then got up and kneeled in front of her, where I started by sucking her middle cock. Not that I wanted to brag, but I was actually good at it, since I had already practiced with my ex-boyfriends. I couldn&#39;t handle three dicks at once, just as I got interested in her balls and grabbed them. The biggest proof that I was doing it right was that she kept moaning, which increased when I found her pussy behind her balls (what I had almost forgotten that she had) and stuck my fingers in there.<br />
<br />
As I continued to suck Arwen&#39;s middle cock, I was getting more and more wet and wanted to feel her inside me, but before I gave the idea she announced she was going to come. I tried to prevent her from dirtying the room with her cum so I closed my mouth around her cock trying to swallow everything, meanwhile I put my hands in front of her other cocks. When she finally came I thought it was a little strange, not because I wasn&#39;t able to swallow all the cum that came in my mouth, but because nothing came out of her other two cocks.<br />
<br />
When Arwen&#39;s orgasm was over, I stood up and looked at her, with cum running down the corner of my mouth, before realizing that only her middle cock went limp, while her other two cocks continued rock hard. &quot;How strange, why did cum only come out of one dick and only that one went limp?&quot; I asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It is because the elves&#39; dicks work separately, as it is only possible to reproduce after cumming with all three inside a pussy, but the three cannot fit all at the same time.&quot; Arwen said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that means you still have the energy for one more time. Now I want you to fill my pussy.&quot; I said and took off my clothes, which already seemed strange since Angela and I were the only ones in the entire village that were wearing at the time.<br />
<br />
Arwen looked at me while I undressed and as soon as I took off my panties and she saw that I didn&#39;t have a dick she said &quot;Wow, I found it hard to believe when you said you didn&#39;t have a dick, but it&#39;s not that you don&#39;t have it. It is the first time that I see something like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is how the women of the world outside this island are.&quot; I said and lay on her bed, offering my pussy to her.<br />
<br />
Arwen wasted no time to put her right dick in my pussy, she tried to penetrate her left dick in my ass, but she couldn&#39;t do it from the angle, so I stood aside so that she can fuck my two entrances down there at the same time.<br />
<br />
While Arwen fucked me, her middle dick got hard again and she said &quot;You are very good Tori, there are few who can make aby of my dicks hard again after having cumming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I say so. It&#39;s hard to believe that a girl alone is filling me up like this.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
After that we didn&#39;t talk anymore, we just moaned with pleasure until we both came. I just didn&#39;t expect an orgasm as intense as I did and, I don&#39;t know if it was because of it or being tired, but I just blacked out after that.<br />
<br />
When I woke up it was already dawn. I was still lying naked on Arwen&#39;s bed, which was next to my backpack with  my cell phone on her hands. She noticed that I had woken up and said &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Tori, I was curious and checked your stuff. I never saw anything like this thing here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a cell phone, but now it&#39;s useless. Since we arrived on this island it doesn&#39;t work anymore.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you said that you fell here on the island because many things in what you call an airplane stopped working.&quot; Arwen said<br />
<br />
After that I got up and noticed something different between my legs, which I examined and Arwen confirmed what I was thinking when she looked too. It was small at just 2 inches, but a dick had definitely grown just above my vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently I already started to transform.&quot; I said before putting on my clothes, because I still didn&#39;t feel comfortable walking around naked.</p>
