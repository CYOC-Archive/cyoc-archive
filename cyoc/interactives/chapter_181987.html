<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zoran a 14 year old boy with short blond hair, brown eyes and an athletic built, is sitting in his room at his laptop. He had received a program in the mail today, it is a strange program called “Transformations of all kinds”. According to the manual, the program is able to alter reality, change a person&#39;s gender, transform a person into an animal and lots more. While the program is installing on his laptop, the boy is thinking about what to try out first. His mind keeps drifting to his mom and how hard she works, she does everything for him and the rest of the family, she would deserve a break from that stress. Zoran though is unsure how he could give her this break, then the idea of transforming his mother into him and vice versa popped into his mind. First the boy felt disgusted, why on earth would he want to be a 30 year old woman?! But then again, he sure was a curious boy, he kind of would like to know what it would be to be the other sex. Him and his mother are home alone for the weekend, his father is out on a business trip and his older sister is staying with friends. It would not hurt to swap roles at least for the weekend, “MOM?! Could you come to my room,” he calls out, “I&#39;d like to show something to you.”<br />
<br />
Soon his door opens and his mom enters the room, “what is it, dear?”<br />
<br />
“Have a seat,” Zoran says, “I&#39;d like to suggest something,” the boy waits for his mother to sit down.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” his mother says, sitting down on her son&#39;s bed.<br />
<br />
Zoran takes a deep breath, “I noticed over the last couple of weeks, that you seem to be pretty stressed out,” he start.<br />
<br />
His mom, Grace, nods, “yeah... work is just pretty stressful as of late,” she says, “I got to work more hours and I have no time to rest since I have to take care of you lot.”<br />
<br />
Zoran nods, “I... would like for you to take a break from everything,” he says.<br />
<br />
His mother chuckles, “I wish I could.”<br />
<br />
Zoran rubs his hands together, “well... there is a way you can take that break,” he says.<br />
<br />
“How?”<br />
<br />
“Well... you see mom, I got this program which can do all sorts of things,” Zoran says.<br />
<br />
“Oh really? Like what?”<br />
<br />
“For example you and me could transform into the other, you&#39;d become me and I&#39;d become you,” Zoran says, “it&#39;ll only be for the weekend,” he adds quickly.<br />
<br />
“Why would you want to be a 30 year old woman?”<br />
<br />
“For one, you deserve a break and for two: I am curious to know what it&#39;d be like.”<br />
<br />
His mother thinks for a while, then she smiles, “okay... but ONLY for the weekend,” she says.<br />
<br />
Zoran smiles, “I promise mom,” he says. He turns to his laptop and aims the camera at his mother, “first I need to scan you,” he says. His mother watches as her son scans her and her stats appear on the screen.<br />
<br />
Name: Grace Davis<br />
Age: 40<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Cup-Size: C36<br />
Eye colour: blue<br />
Hair colour: blond<br />
Hair length: middle of back<br />
Built: slim<br />
Sexual orientation: straight<br />
<br />
“Wow,” his mother says.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, now for myself,” Zoran says, after he scans himself his stats pop up, “okay, let me do the edits and set the timer. Would you like the transformation to start straight away, or would you want it to be slow?”<br />
<br />
“Hm... straight away,” she says.<br />
<br />
Zoran nods and starts typing, first he changes the stats of his mother and sets her timer, then he edits his stats and sets his timer. He moves the mouse to the “save changes” button and turns to his mother, “ready, mom?”<br />
<br />
“I... guess so,” she says, “it&#39;ll be weird to be my son, but I am curious and it&#39;d be nice to be young again.”<br />
<br />
Zoran presses the button and they both feel a tingle, Zoran notices himself growing, his waist slims as his hips widen and his bum becomes bigger, rounder and firmer. His blond hair smooths out and lengthens, reaching the middle of his back. The boy moans as his penis and sack wriggle and start to get pulled into his body. Zoran groans as his tummy gurgles as a womb forms, pushing his insides out of the way. His clothes strain against his changing body, he starts to tear the clothes from his body, “I... should have... t-taken my clothes off f-first,” he says.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile his mother watches in shock and amazement as her son transforms into her, “unbelievable,” she whispers. Grace then notices as she shrinks, her hair becomes short and turn into a boy&#39;s haircut. The woman notices as she shrinks, her clothes feeling lose on her, her eyes widen as she feels a wriggling between her legs, looking down she sees a penis and sack replacing her pussy.<br />
<br />
Soon both have transformed into the other, Grace looks at herself, “w-wow...,” she clasps her hands over her mouth as she hears her new voice, “this is so weird.” The former woman turns and gasps, “ZORAN!”<br />
<br />
The former boy turns, “yes mom?”<br />
<br />
“A woman your age should not be naked around her 14 year old son,” his mother says, blushing hard, “but damn... I sure am a hottie”.<br />
<br />
Zoran blushes, “well... then give me your clothes,” he says, “they look ridiculous on you... son,” he adds with a grin.<br />
<br />
Both laugh and then his mother hands her body the clothes and heads to her son&#39;s closet and takes out a new outfit. After both are dressed “Zoran” turns to his “mother”, “so... “mom”... what now?”<br />
<br />
“Well, how about you call some friends? You could have a movie night,” “Grace” suggests.<br />
<br />
“Great idea,” the boy says, “and you could get some food ready,” he adds.<br />
<br />
“Sure, anything you&#39;d like,” Grace asks.<br />
<br />
“How about pizza,” the former woman asks, “pizza always works for a movie night.”<br />
<br />
“Grace” nods and leaves the room, “Zoran” grabs his phone and starts calling a few friends. Grace is standing in the kitchen and is working on the dough for the pizza, she decides to make a hawai pizza with ham, pineapple, and cheese. As the pizza is backing the doorbell rings, Grace walks to the door and opens it, she sees her friends Mark, Judy, Jason and Mandy standing there. “Aah you must be my son&#39;s friends,” she says, “come on in, Zoran is in his room.” The teens greet the woman, unaware that it is Zoran in his mother&#39;s body, and head upstairs. An hour later the pizza is done and “Grace” cuts it into slices and puts them onto five plates. She carries the plates on a tray up to her “son&#39;s” room, “boys, pizza time,” she says as she enters.<br />
<br />
“Zoran” turns and hurries over to help his “mother” set down the tray on his small coffee table, “could you get us some drinks, please?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, anything you would like,” she asks.<br />
<br />
“Coke, please,” all of them say, Grace nods and gets the drinks. The rest of the evening is uneventful for “Grace”, she watches the news and cleans the kitchen, but then she decides to just call it a night. Zoran walks upstairs and into his mother&#39;s bedroom, he opens her closet and takes out a night gown, after getting changed and brushing her teeth, she climbs into bed and falls asleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“Grace” woke the next morning, after showering and getting into her clothes, she goes to check on her “son”. She knocks on the door and slowly opens it, “mom, are you awake,” she asks after being sure that the others were not there.<br />
<br />
“Zoran” stirs and slowly opens his eyes, “oh, hi “mom”. Sorry, it was a long night,” he says, slowly sitting up.<br />
<br />
“No problem, dear,” she says, “so, how was you night as a 14 year old?”<br />
<br />
“Refreshing,” “Zoran” says with a smile, “I had to get used to being a 14 year old boy, but that didn&#39;t take long. What about you?”<br />
<br />
“Well... this body does feel weird and alien,” Zoran says, “but I had a good night sleep,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Zoran” smiles, “so, what have you got planned for today?”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t know, mom,” he says, “do you have something on your mind?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I wanted to do some gardening,” his mother says, “I bought new plants which I wanted to plant.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, mom, I&#39;ll take care of that,” Zoran says, “what have you got planned?”<br />
<br />
“Zoran” looks at his “mother”, “Mark asked if I&#39;d like to do a gaming evening at his place, I&#39;d stay the night.”<br />
<br />
“I can tell you that Mark has really cool games,” “Grace” says, “you&#39;ll enjoy it and I&#39;ll be okay by myself, I still have some pizza left over from yesterday.”<br />
<br />
“Zoran” smiles, “cool, thanks for giving me your life for a weekend,” he says.<br />
<br />
They hug each other, “it is the least I can do for all you do for me... mom,” the real Zoran says. He then lets his mother go, “why don&#39;t you get ready, don&#39;t forget to take “your” phone with you,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Zoran” nods, “will do... mom,” he says with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Grace” leaves the room, smiling to herself, “feels so good to see mom so relaxed and happy,” she says to herself. She walks into the kitchen and makes herself something to eat and for “Zoran” a little snack to take with him. Her “son” enters the kitchen an hour later, “all set and ready to go?”<br />
<br />
“Yep, I packed fresh clothes, my phone, some chips, a coke and my PJ&#39;s,” the “boy” says.<br />
<br />
“Good, here, I made you a little something to eat to take with you,” Grace says, “the drive to Mark&#39;s is around two hours,” she adds.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, mom,” “Zoran” says, they then kiss good bye and soon “Grace” is by herself.<br />
<br />
After planting the plants and doing some other garden work, “Grace” heads back inside to do some laundry. “Man, now I know first hand what my mom has to do all the time,” Zoran mumbles to himself, “I am really exhausted and my back hurts.” After the laundry is done Zoran decides that it is enough for one day, “I&#39;ll do the rest tomorrow,” he says. “Grace” looks at her watch and her eyes widen, “8pm already,” she says, “man, time flies when you do stuff,” she decides to warm up some of the pizza and make herself comfortable in front of the TV.<br />
<br />
“Grace” is half way through the newest X-Man movie, when she suddenly hears the front door open. “BABE, I AM HOME,” she hears the voice of her father call, the door to the living room opens, her eyes wide in surprise and shock.<br />
<br />
“D-Don?! H-how come you are back a day earlier,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Don walks towards her and gives her a kiss on the cheeks, which caused “Grace” to tense, before sitting down next to her. “It took less than expected to get the contract done,” he says, grinning happily to have surprised his wife, unaware that the “woman” next to him is his son. The man lies an arm around his “wife” and looks to the TV, “what are you watching and are the kids in bed?”<br />
<br />
“Th-the newest X-Man movie,” she says, feeling uneasy with her father&#39;s arm around her shoulder, “Zoran is staying at a friend&#39;s house and June is also with friends”.<br />
<br />
Don raises an eyebrow, “oh? I did not know that you enjoy action films,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Grace” shrugs, “there is a first for everything,” she says.<br />
<br />
Don nods, “true, true,” he says, he takes his arm from around her shoulder and lies it on her leg, starting to stroke it, “BUT... I am in the mood for something much more... fun,” he adds with a wink.<br />
<br />
“Grace” shudders inwardly as she understands just what Don means, she pushes his hand away, “not tonight,” she says, “I am not in the mood, I really had a long and tiring day.”<br />
<br />
But Don is not a man who takes a “no” for an answer, especially when he feels so horny, he missed his wife and he wanted to make love to her. It has been a while since they were alone at home, he did not have sex for weeks. Don needed his wife so badly, “oh, come on, babe,” he says, “we hadn&#39;t had sex in a long time. I really, really need you, I miss the fun times with you, I know you want it too,” he starts to stroke her leg again, “I&#39;d love to have another child and I know you&#39;d love to have another son or daughter too, so come on, let&#39;s take the chance”.<br />
<br />
“Grace” pushes his arm away again and stands up, looking stearnly at him, “I said “no”, I am not in the mood,” she says, “and two kids are enough and they are a handful, I do not want to care for a third child, a baby at that. I am stressed enough.”<br />
<br />
Don lowers his head as he sighs, better not make her mad, “okay, okay... sorry,” he says, “I just missed you and this would have been the best opportunity since the kids aren&#39;t home.” The man stands up, “I hope tomorrow you&#39;ll be in the mood,” he says, “I&#39;ll just go and check on some E-Mails,” he adds. Don walks past her, “don&#39;t stay up to long, babe,” he says, giving her a kiss on the cheek and leaves the room.<br />
<br />
“Grace” stands there for a while before returning to the coach and the movie, &#39;phew, that was close,&#39; she thinks to herself.<br />
<br />
Don walks up the stairs and past his son&#39;s room, the door wide open, “Zoran” forgot to close it before leaving for Mark&#39;s house. The man notices that his son&#39;s laptop is running, &#39;that boy,&#39; he thinks to himself, shaking his head, &#39;no wonder the internet bills are so high.&#39; He walks into the room, to turn off the computer, but then he spots the program, he raises an eyebrow. &#39;Why is the program showing my wife&#39;s stats and why is there a timer counting down,&#39; he asks himself. Don opens the manual and his eyes widen as he reads it, &#39;I heard of this program,&#39; he thinks to himself as he recalls one of his colleges bragging about how he used the program to turn his wife into a slut. The man grins, &#39;maybe I WILL get to have sex with my wife after all,&#39; he thinks to himself. He opens his “wife&#39;s” stats, unaware that they are actually his son&#39;s, and starts to type. Don changes the percent of his wife&#39;s libido from 10% up to 100%, then he changes the fertility chance from 5% to 100%. He then moves to the timer and tries to delete it, but fails, he then tries to change the setting of the countdown, his eyes widen and a big smile appears on his face as the countdown stops and the numbers start to blink. &#39;I&#39;ll lower the percents tomorrow evening, before the kids return, so that they don&#39;t wonder why their mom acts so weird,&#39; he thinks to himself and sets the timer, after checking the changes, the man nods happily and saves the changes, then he down loads the program onto his phone, &#39;might come in handy,&#39; and closes the program and shuts off the computer. Don then walks out of his son&#39;s room and closes the door, he walks into the office and turns on the computer, pretending to check on e-mails, &#39;now I just have to wait,&#39; he thinks with a smile.</p>
