<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hikari rubbed her eyes as she now tried to take in her surroundings. The teenage Kitsune had no idea where she was, her surroundings were even more unfamiliar than the forest she had just fled. Huge buildings looked over the girls head as vehicles she was unfamiliar with sped by at speeds she was unaccustomed too. Shrinking back into the shadows she hugged herself tightly. <br />
<br />
Hikari was scared, she had never seen such a place, the Kitsunes home in Hokkaido looked nothing like this. Unfortunately for her Liliths magic had wiped most of her adult memories away. Hikari had no memory of the modern world, she only remembered what the world looked like when she was a teenager 800 years ago in Japan. “This is madness,” the young Kitsune whispered. <br />
<br />
Hikari now tried to compose herself as she tried to think. The teens parents had always told her she was smart and resourceful. Looking down at a puddle of water, the young Kitsune realized she was still in her fox form. Hikari knew that an anthro fox girl would be looked at fearfully (even in her time Kitsune would be seen as an oddity). What was even worse was Hikari’s dark fur. Dark furred Kitsune were seen as evil omens, Hikari was often discriminated against because of this. Deciding that she didn’t need any undue attention she now focused on assuming human form. Focusing her powers, Hikari now began to shift forms. The girls face lost all fur while her tail vanished. Soon a young Japanese teen in traditional clothing stood in the alley. Satisfied that her human appearance wouldn’t lead to problems, she slowly stepped from the alley and into the crowd.<br />
<br />
Mika groaned as she rubbed her eyes. It had been a long day at class and the only thing she was looking forward too was getting a bite to eat and going to bed. As she now made her way back to her apartment she ran head long into a teenage girl. “Hey watch it,” Mika states as she gazed at the young teen.<br />
<br />
Hikari had not even seen the girl as she ran into her. Falling backwards the girl looked up at the curiously dressed girl as she now tried to apologize.<br />
<br />
Mika sighed as the teenage girl in front of her now began speaking. All of her siblings, Mika was the only one who couldn’t speak Japanese. “Ugh great,” she mumbled. “Wish Shiro and Naomi were here. Hell wish I paid attention when my folks tried to teach me the language.” Mika now looked down at the girl, taken aback slightly at the girls very traditional kimono and dress. “Sorry,” she said. “Really don’t speak the language. Do you know English?”<br />
<br />
Part of the Kitsunes magic allowed her to be able to understand all language. Hikari had at first been happy to see another Japanese person. It confused her the girl did not speak Japanese but a different language entirely. Fortunately Hikari was able to use her magic to now be able to speak to Mika. “Yes,” she said, her voice accented. “My name is Hikari. Can you help me?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah sure,” Mika said, concerned at the frightened look on the teens face. “Is everything alright? Are you hurt? Where are your parents?”<br />
<br />
“I do not know,” Hikari said. “I can not remember. I’m lost. Can you please help me?”<br />
<br />
“Okay Yeah sure,” Mika said quickly. Although Mika was tired and a apprehensive about helping a complete stranger, she couldn’t leave the young teen alone. The girl in front of her looked barely 15 and seemed to stick out like a sore thumb in the bustling New York crowd. Keeping her magical defenses high, Mika now helped the young teen up onto her feet. “My names Mika,” she said. “Did you say your name was Hikari?”<br />
<br />
Hikari nodded earnestly as she bowed slightly to the older girl. “Okay um that’s an od name for a girl. How about we call you Kari Okay?” Hikari gazed curiously at Mika befor smiling shyly. “Okay that sounds nice miss.”<br />
<br />
“Right,” Mika said curiously, surprised at how formal the teen was. “Listen, Kari. I was just on my way to grab something to eat. Are you hungry?” Hikari nodded earnestly, she was hungry. Hopefully after filling her stomach she would be able to find help. “Okay Kari follow me,” Mika said. “I know just the place.”<br />
<br />
Mika knew of a couple of Japanese restaurants close to her apartment. One of the nice things about living in New York was the wide selection of food. Mika knew of a restaurant that had takeout at a reasonable price. Placing an order for curry she now looked at her teenage companion. “See anything you like,” she asked. “Go ahead, the meal is on me.”<br />
<br />
Hikari looked over the various dishes being served, her mouth watering at the smells. As she glanced over the dishes her eyes went wide as she spotted her favorite meal. “Can I have some Abura-age” she asked happily. “Don’t see why not,” Mika states. Grabbing their food Hikari and Mika now made their way back to her apartment.<br />
<br />
As the two Japanese girls entered Mika’s apartment they made they way over to the couch. Mika’s apartment was modest. A small studio apartment with a kitchen and small living space that her family happily covered after she earned a scholarship to college. Various projects lay scattered around the apartment while Mika’s clothing and bed lay neatly made in a corner. Hikari casually glanced around the apartment, curious at the place Mika lived. “This home is quite spectacular,” Hikari said in awe as she slipped off her shoes. “Wow Your too kind,” Mika smirked. “It’s really not much, but it’s close too school. Just grab a seat anywhere and enjoy, well try to find your family after we’ve eaten.”<br />
<br />
Hikari thanked Mika sincerely as she now sat on the floor. Saying a small Shinto prayer the Kitsune now began eating in earnest, savoring every bite of her dish. “Someone’s hungry,” Mika smirked. Hikari looked up from her dish, apologizing if she seemed rude. “No it’s nothing,” Mika said kindly. “Just seeing that your hungry. Guess you had a bit of a rough experience.”<br />
<br />
Hikari nodded quietly as she returned to her dinner. Her memories were fuzzy but she did recall a dark presence, one that was trying to attack her. It frightened the poor girl but now she was beginning to feel at ease once more. Mika had proven to be very kind to the girl, going  so far as to not only invite her into her home but give her food. “Thank you for your kindness,” Hikari said meekly. “It is more than I deserve.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t say that,” Mika smiles. “Look can’t have some kid just wandering the streets of New York alone. It’s dangerous out there. Now eat up and if your hungry we have a little extra.”<br />
<br />
Hikari smiled as she once again began eating with earnest. The girl Mika was a kind hearted woman, one that was treating her well and making her feel completely at ease. Unfortunately for the young Kitsune she was feeling too at ease as she slowly began to shift once more into her Kitsune form.<br />
<br />
Hikari’s fox ears slowly began to sprout from her head as her tail now emerged from under her kimono, swaying happily back and forth. The Kitsunes facial features also began to change, her mouth pushing out slightly into a muzzle as black fur began to cover her body. In only moments a happy and content teenage Kitsune sat smiling on Mika’s floor smiling up at the college age woman. “Thank you again for your kindness Mika,” she smiled.<br />
<br />
Mika at first turned to smile before screaming in shock. “Holy shit a Kitsune,” she yelled, her eyes going wide as she readied herself for battle. Hikari looked on in shock as the woman now readied a spell to strike her down. Terrified the young Kitsune shrank backwards covering her face as she pleaded for mercy. “Please don’t hurt me,” she said meekly. <br />
<br />
Mika paused as she looked at the girl. This Kitsune, unlike the ones she had battled recently, was terrified of her. The girl seemed more afraid of Mika than Mika of her. “Wait hold on,” she said, slightly confused. “Your not here to hurt me?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to hurt anyone,” she moaned, grassing her tail. “I’m lost. An evil witch was chasing me, I fled from her when she tried to attack, I...I just want to be safe.”<br />
<br />
Mika stared slack jawed as the teenage Kitsune now clutches her tail, crying softly. She had a feeling the girl Kitsune was talking about Lilith yet she wondered if this was just a trick to put  Mika at ease. “And I was hoping for a quiet night,” Mika sighed. The college girl now rubbed her eyes as she gazed at the frightened teenage Kitsune, her life was about to get a lot more complicated.</p>
