<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I am ready to please you now, Rider,” Anija said breathily as she crawled toward her Rider, her eyes hungry.<br />
<br />
At that, Vaestro put a staying hand on the dragoness’ shoulder, looking at her with a mixture of deep love, bemused uncertainty, wry mischief, and terrible pity. Being a very complex man, Vaestro could feel all of these emotions at one time.<br />
<br />
Anija, having magically amplified empathy, sensed her Rider’s feelings, and she frowned a little bit indignantly. The hen ended up looking very cute as a consequence, just like any female does when she is caught off-guard. “Did I do something bad?” she asked.<br />
<br />
Vaestro’s amusement welled up as he asked, “You never explored your sexuality as a hen, did you?”<br />
<br />
“I liked being bred like one, when I was a drake,” she answered a little bit defensively. “You should know, I am hardly a virgin.”<br />
<br />
At this, Vaestro turned the little hen around and pulled her close in a snuggle, and for a while, he just held her close to him as he laughed lovingly. How much his pretty hen knew...and how little. “So what is sex, between two drakes?” Vaestro asked. “How do you feel about it, emotionally?”<br />
<br />
Anija tilted her head to the side as she thought about it. “I guess that I want some big, masculine hunk to slam me against the floor and pound me to a pulp,” she admitted. “It excites me, surrendering my masculinity to another male. I feel a little bit liberated by it. The need to prove anything or be anybody takes a backseat. I am free to just let things happen. A rough, hot, feral rutting. For a little while, that&#39;s all that matters.” Anija thought about that for a few seconds. “I can imagine how it might be different if I did not have any such thing to be surrendered,” she admitted. &quot;Not having any throne to be taken down from makes things...&quot; she paused, stuck for words.<br />
<br />
“...a little...&quot; Vaestro said, starting to finish the thought for her but stopping himself, thinking it best to let his little dragon think this through on her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;...a little...gentler, I guess,&quot; Anija finished softly. &quot;I will assure you, though, drake sex is good. We do it almost constantly for a reason. It&#39;s just hot, hard, rough, and feral. But yes, I will acknowledge that it could never be the same as really being a hen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vaestro smiled. &quot;It sounds like there is a sort of child-like innocence in it, really,&quot; he said mysteriously. He stared off into space for a little while, and Anija&#39;s empathy sense picked up that he felt perhaps a little jealous over that, although it was a jealousy without animosity. A pensive melancholy might have been there, but Vaestro was too enlightened a man to despise anyone for having something that the gods had meant for them, rather than for himself. They sat there quietly for a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I see what you look like under that, though?&quot; Vaestro asked, after a little while, referring to the lingerie that Anija had borrowed from Luka.<br />
<br />
Having never worn clothes of any kind before, Anija was finding out why humans were always reluctant to take them off. Well, that was not entirely right: during combat missions, she had worn barding, and Vaestro had drilled safety deeply into her head. She had learned to never take off her barding while on a combat mission, except during routine bathing and grooming. He had said, she remembered, &#39;it might feel uncomfortable to sleep with barding on you, but a spear through your gut would be even more uncomfortable. At least, that is what I have heard from comrades in arms, shortly before they died.&#39; This was a little different, though. It felt like admitting to guilt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can remove mine first, if it would make you more comfortable,&quot; Vaestro said as Anija hesitated.<br />
<br />
Anija shook her head. &quot;No...it&#39;s not that...just...the clip in the back...would you?&quot; As Anija turned around, Vaestro reached forward, and he undid the clip. From there, he pulled her cleanly out of the garment. Anija felt she was being shelled like a shrimp, but the thought excited her a little. Soon, the little dragoness lay there on the bed without any clothing on at all.<br />
<br />
Without the oversize lingerie on her, though, the anthro dragoness at least looked half her age, rather than like a very little girl that might reach at any moment for her stuffed animal and begin sucking her thumb. As the angelic dragoness lay there in the nude, the moonlight struck her hide, and it bathed her in feminine glory, making her look a little bit like an ancient nymph. Her two pairs of wings were partly furled around her, looking very much like the petals of a lotus, in which her naked body sat. Her claws, on both her hands and her feet, glinted with gold. Her paws were an incredibly soft pink. Her change into an anthro had made her muzzle a little bit flatter against her face, rather than protruding like the muzzle of a horse, and her expression was more mobile. Her tail, with its huge tuft at its end, was tucked anxiously between her legs, obscuring her genitals and acting as a veil over her breasts, and the tuft flicked nervously from side to side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oddly, that is a little more dignified,&quot; Vaestro said to her. &quot;I only wish that a male were as comfortable to look at as a female,&quot; he added, a little bashfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t judge you,&quot; Anija assured him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I am a little...&quot; Vaestro started. However, he realized that he trusted his dragon. With that, Vaestro unbuttoned his shirt a few buttons, letting his ample chest hair spill out, and he made a chagrined, apologetic sort of look. &quot;It&#39;s a little gross,&quot; he insisted.<br />
<br />
Anija shook her head absentmindedly, and she leaned over to lie her head against that chest, taking in a few breaths. &quot;You make me feel so safe,&quot; she said. The feeling surged through her entire body. Every breath made her feel more this way. Vaestro&#39;s strong, masculine scent was making her detached, lightheaded, and happy. At some point, she became vaguely aware that the rest of his shirt had come off, but she didn&#39;t remember when, and Vaestro was holding her tiny, frail body up to his, looking very contented and caressing his dragoness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mruf-fanfururmfurmfuvul,&quot; Anija mumbled at some point.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that, dear?&quot; Vaestro inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;The pants are uncomfortable,&quot; Anija said a little more clearly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Vaestro replied. He rolled his hips to the side, repositioning Anija a few times, and soon, he had the trousers off. &quot;Is that better?&quot; Vaestro asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmhm,&quot; Anija said as she snuggled up to his bare body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just need to warn you, though,&quot; Vaestro said as he held his dragoness, &quot;when you take me inside you, you will change in ways that your magic alone could never change you. When you cease to be a virgin, you will be transformed forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...I&#39;m not...&quot; Anija started to protest.<br />
<br />
Vaestro kissed her on her head. &quot;What a hen can feel is something that could never just be explained to you,&quot; Vaestro whispered. &quot;You have a right to feel it...and a right to refuse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are...my Rider,&quot; Anija said. &quot;You have any right over me that you choose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vaestro almost began to sob. &quot;I would not want this one,&quot; he said in a broken voice. &quot;Can I just have one thing? To have you truly willing? For you to love me as I do you? I don&#39;t want to feel alone, Anija.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anija&#39;s instincts as an angelic dragon told her what she needed to do. She needed to speak truthfully and from her heart, like she never had before. She had to focus on this truth, and focus all of her magic on this one statement. She needed to make sure that Vaestro believed and understood the unbridled, devoted love that she had in her. &quot;I want to be yours, Vaestro,&quot; she projected through her power. &quot;Please...just make me yours forever.&quot; As if a spell had been cast--for one truly had been--a blast of pure empathy flowed forth from her, projecting a deep, oceanic feeling of willingness. &#39;Yes, she was willing,&#39; it shouted. &#39;SHE IS WILLING!&#39; it proclaimed, the magical voice ringing with authority, purity, and certainty. &quot;I love you, Vaestro, and I want you to love me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I do love you, Ania, forever and ever,&quot; Vaestro responded truthfully. With that, Vaestro hugged Anija emotionally to his chest, and he began making slow, sweet, gentle love to the dragoness. Coos, moans, and sighs would fill the night, and the air would bear the aroma of their sexuality for a long time to come.</p>
