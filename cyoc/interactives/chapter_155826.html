<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Many hours later Daniel and Sam returned to the cave toting two large duffel bags each. They showed no surprise at the three enhanced Sophies tangled in a sapphic knot. <br />
<br />
Sophie had used her alien mass to grow a ring of thick tendrils around the living pillar. Inside the ring, finer strands had grown into a woven solid mat of rubbery  flesh. The end result was a round soft springy platform surrounding her central mass, a raised living bed. Her three drone bodies had been making good use of it as she explored the limits of her enhanced bodies&#39; strength and flexibility.<br />
<br />
A mental tug had both femboys drop their bags and begin stripping. <br />
<br />
Sophie disentangled one of her selves and met the brothers at the edge of the bed. Far stronger than even her fit appearance would suggest, she effortlessly tossed Sam halfway across the platform, and took a long standing leap to straddle him. No need for foreplay with mind controlled thralls, Sam was hard and ready. Sophie slid down on his shaft, taking all 7 inches and hilting him inside her. Replaying the previous night, she looked over her shoulder and slapped her ass. No compulsion needed, Daniel hopped up on the bed and mounted her.<br />
<br />
Their previous lovemaking had been a furious affair with no technique. The was slower, more tender. Sam ground his cock in a circle, pressed as deep as he could manage. Every time his motion passed &#39;12 o&#39;clock&#39;, he pressured her clit just right.<br />
<br />
Daniel made long slow thrusts from behind, his hands wrapped around her, rolling Sophie&#39;s nipples in time with his strokes.<br />
<br />
Her other two bodies had shifted and sat with their backs to the pillar, allowing Sophie to enjoy watching her own double penetration. The two clones arms reached into each other&#39;s laps, sliding in two fingers to jointly jill off as she watched the main event.<br />
<br />
A perk of her growth into a hive minded creature was she was now the ultimate multitasker. While basking in pleasure and rolling with the orgasms of her bodies, she contemplated what she had become.<br />
<br />
She was now effectively immortal, her central mass didn&#39;t age and could regenerate any injury or disease. She could replace any drone bodies with a thought and a few hours of growth.<br />
<br />
Sophie McKenna had come out here to choose between two lives. Now if she wanted, she literally could live both if she so desired. She debated for hours while her bodies fucked. Eventually the twins tired, and she resumed her selfcest.<br />
<br />
She could feel a primal desire to spread what she had become, to make puppets out if any who challenged her and infest anyone worthy with a queen larva to birth other hive minds like herself. She knew that any young woman or suitably feminized young man could easily become as she. Another bit of instinctive knowledge emerged; she had hard limits to how drones and puppets she could control. As more bodies were linked, the mental difficulty increased exponentially. She probably could manage a couple more puppets, but another Sophie drone would probably have to wait months until her central mass had grown considerably.<br />
<br />
She decided to deny this desire to spread aggressively, instead she would offer this to just her friend Melissa. Mel had been her best friend since grade school and they had decided to attend Palmetto State as it was the best college that accepted both of them. The two of them would decide what next. No matter what she would keep this quiet, no missing people or drones marching naked down the street.<br />
<br />
On the missing people thought she flinched. She felt guilty about the twins, the part of her that had been the creature had acted out of instinct. It needed mass for the change and it needed protection while it fused with Sophie. Aggressively draining and puppeting the brothers satisfied both.<br />
<br />
Probing their sleeping minds, she saw again how much they had lost. All their knowledge was there, but their actual memories were swiss cheese. The spark in them had dimmed, they had little imagination or personality left. She promised herself she wouldn&#39;t do this to anyone else... who didn&#39;t deserve it. She would find a way to help these two somehow.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t feel any guilt about feminizing them. The dark part of her that had reveled in their girly looks on the hike to the lake had gotten stronger. She knew that her alien body&#39;s filter feeder at the cave was also flooding the pond with estrogen. In a few weeks she would have its waters crystal clear and completely saturated with female hormones. Any guy who swam in it a few times would find himself needing a bra. Anywhere that hives became established, the contaminated water supply would gradually erase all masculinity.<br />
<br />
Sophie let the boys sleep and she let her mind wander. She no longer needed rest, and by extension neither did her drone bodies. However she did enjoy daydreaming. She wondered how Melissa would perfect her own drone bodies once she had transformed.</p>
