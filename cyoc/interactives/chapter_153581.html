<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Selicia was back in her forest abode from so long ago. Before her stood the local Kingdom&#39;s Princess of all people... She was according to her, sneaked out on her own to seek out Selicia. The princess was a rather average looking girl barely an fully grown adult with copper locks, hazel eyes, and a so so figure. Pleading with Selicia to help her save her ailing kingdom, she practically threw herself at her feet. Meanwhile, Selicia pondered on what to do with her, surely this will cause knights to break down her door...<br />
<br />
Standing up from her favorite chair Selicia walked around and stood just beside the princess helping her to her feet. After she was on her feet, she positioned herself behind the princess with hands on her shoulders. &quot;You know whom you&#39;ve come to deal with don&#39;t you?&quot; The princess nodded with a mild shake coursing through her body. &quot;And still you&#39;d ask me to do whatever it takes to save your kingdom?&quot; Once again the princess nodded an affirmative as she tried to steady her shaking. She wouldn&#39;t have to worry about shaking for much longer. &quot;Very well then, we have no time to waste.&quot; Walking around the princess to stand before her, Selicia regarded the now stiffened princess.<br />
<br />
Her fearful eyes darted around her as the princess had realized she couldn&#39;t move. &quot;First we must deal with those...&quot; With a snap of Selicia&#39;s fingers, the princess&#39;s average body was put on display as her fine clothing vanished. &quot;Good, Good... Next we need to make of you the proper material to save your kingdom.&quot; A sneer played across Selicia&#39;s face as metallic gold slowly consumed the princess&#39;s legs. Seating herself on her table, Selicia watched a flow of fluids run down golden thighs as the princess&#39;s eyes rolled up in ecstasy. Selicia was going to at least let her experience one orgasm in her life before she could no more. The princess&#39;s flowing lips froze into gold and glistened enticingly enough that Selicia might have a taste.<br />
<br />
The change had overtaken the princess&#39;s midsection when Selicia gave her golden clit a flick getting some of the sticky fluid on her finger. She waited to lock eyes with the woman before gave the finger a long sultry lick. &quot;Well, at least something about you wasn&#39;t average, that was rather pleasant.&quot; Selicia grabbed one of the princess&#39;s breasts for a firm squeeze and light suckle. Breast turning gold in her mouth, Selicia backed away to see it shine and maintain form from her grip. Once the change reached her neck, the princess&#39;s eyes locked on to Selicia&#39;s with pleading practically pouring forth with the tears. &quot;Remember, you chose this...&quot; Those were the last words, she&#39;d ever hear as the change overtook her head turning copper locks to gold. <br />
<br />
Appraising the statue, Selicia helped herself to a few squeezes and cups here and there, as was her right after all. Nodding, she flicked her wrist toward the statue and watched as it dissolved into a massive pile of golden coins. Picking up one of the coins that had rolled into her foot, she saw the nude from of the princess proudly parting her vagina lips and firmly grasping one of her breasts. On the flip side was a close up and rather detailed view of the opened vagina. So detailed that she felt she could almost stick something down into it. With that out of the way, she called a few of her more mobile servants to gather the coins in bags and deliver them to the king. She held her end of the bargain, the princess would save the kingdom and everyone who wasn&#39;t a prude would know it.<br />
<br />
Rising from her dream with a smile on her face, Selicia stretched and yawned. Gently scratching the underside of her breast, she dressed modestly by her standards for a day out. No scheduled meetings for today so she&#39;d decided to venture into the city proper. Marina had been ordered to take the day to rest as well, since they was little that needed done as it was. Poor thing was liable to work herself to death if not watched carefully. Not that she&#39;d get the chance to die, after all it was in Selicia&#39;s nature to preserve her better servants. A slight chuckled escaped her as she stepped out into the drive to leave the house. She glanced at the Manor&#39;s former owners still frozen in marble in the center of the fountain, they&#39;d been maintained to keep them moss free.<br />
<br />
Heads turned as Selicia passed and they should turn, who shouldn&#39;t feel blessed by her passing. Passing by so many shops, eateries, and more, she wondered where she might stop to have a bite herself. Now, a ritzy upper class restaurant might be her speed and style but, she didn&#39;t want someone grating on her nerves till she&#39;d break her day off promise... Seeing a cozy looking diner ahead she decided that it would do and entered to see it filled with mostly the elderly. Perfect, they were unlikely to cause her a headache as she chose a place to seat herself not far from the register. A young woman with petite yet somehow firm features came over with menus. She had auburn hair that curled just above her shoulders and green eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Debbie and I&#39;ll be your server for the day. If you need anything just give me a holler.&quot; She smiled demurely and walked to another table to take orders. Oddly, Selicia found herself contemplating the woman&#39;s features, where had she seen the like before... Having decided on a breakfast sampler dish, Selicia waited for Debbie&#39;s return. Having given her order, she gently tapped Debbie&#39;s elbow as she made to leave. &quot;Darling, I have the striking notion, I&#39;ve seen you around before. Tell me, what is your family name?&quot; The woman seemed to contemplate telling Selicia and sighed with a shrug. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t matter anyways, we&#39;re not who we used to be.&quot; Interest piqued, Selicia asked her to sit with her a moment. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll compensate you for any trouble. Tell me what you meant by that last statement.&quot; <br />
<br />
Debbie glanced around seeming to make sure she wasn&#39;t needed. &quot;Arthur! I&#39;m taking my break. Last order is right here!&quot; She passed the booklet to a stubby man who must&#39;ve been the cook before continuing. &quot;So my family was originally one of the six noble families to take power with the of the kingdom, at least that&#39;s the story of them... Anyway, so years and years go by of us ruling the roost and then comes Great Grandpa, the bastard... Gambled away the family fortune and left us destitute. Did the others even care? No... They figured if we won&#39;t watch for some evil witch to return, they won&#39;t help us...&quot;<br />
<br />
Evil witch... Could it possibly be... &quot;Tell me, they&#39;ve been keeping watch for a... Witch?&quot; Selicia leaned forward with a genuine grin on her face as she awaited the answer. Now that she was settled onto the seat before her, she could almost see it.<br />
<br />
Debbie nodded and rolled her eyes. &quot;Yeah, apparently our families were charged by our mutual &#39;Founding Father&#39; to watch for some crazy witch to come back. Our family decided well before the rest that the bitch was gone and gave up. The rest of them? They&#39;re still keeping it up like it&#39;s a damn crusade, they&#39;ve hit me up a couple times. &#39;Oh, if you&#39;ll swear to watch again, we&#39;ll talk to our parents to help you out. The hell with that, I&#39;ll make my own way thank you...&quot; She made a disgruntled face about the same time the cook set the plate in front of Selicia. <br />
<br />
There! When Selicia saw the face she made, it had hit her like a blast of fire. She must be the descendant of that large kingsmen and judging by &#39;Mutual Founding Father&#39; that means. Having taken a bite of the food Selicia almost choked. Renault, you old bastard, you actually laid with each of them. She choked from the almost loose fit of laughter and the blandness of the food. Seeing there was no salt or pepper and not wanting to loose the rapport with Debbie, she glanced around the diner finally hearing the commotion at the front. A fiery ed headed woman with a full figure was arguing with the cashier over a hair in her food. Even from here Selicia could tell it was one of the woman&#39;s but, she insisted otherwise. <br />
<br />
Glancing at Debbie and then getting a coy smile, she turned slightly toward the commotion and flicked a bit of magic at the woman. Clothes fading to nothing behind her, the redhead shrieked and attempted to cover herself with her purse. Said purse however was becoming to large to hold to quickly for the woman as she rapidly shrunk in size where she stood. As she shrunk her face took on a lustful expression and she sat on her legs thrusting her fingers into her vagina. Roughly groping his sizeable breast, she belted out smaller and smaller moans. With a final orgasmic cry, her body froze becoming transparent glass and a silver cap crowned her head. The bright red of her hair had transferred inside of her as her transformation to a season shaker completed. The three inch high shaker and its purse hovered over to Selicia who casually caught it and shook it over her food.<br />
<br />
Taking another bite, letting the crowd have it&#39;s stunned awe while she tasted her food. Deciding it was passing, she sent a line of magic through the diner purposely avoiding Debbie. The rest of the diner had resumed what it had been doing before the redhead had become a condiment and Debbie had turned white as a sheet. Selicia smiled at Debbie as she continued to eat her food. &quot;So, what were you saying earlier Dear? We were so rudely interrupted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mouthing the words before she could finally say them, Debbie stared at Selicia. &quot;Y-Y-Y-You&#39;re her, oh god, you&#39;re real.&quot; Debbie&#39;s eyes flashed from the shaker girl to Selicia and she swallowed hard. &quot;Wh-what are you going to do to me?&quot; Too proud to ever admit it but, understandably Debbie wet herself a little in fear. <br />
<br />
Selicia casually waved her fork away from Debbie. &quot;Nothing Dear, I&#39;ve come to enjoy your flare and you said you&#39;re not watching for me so I don&#39;t care to harm you.&quot; She grinned deeply as she took in the sight of Debbie&#39;s fear. &quot;However, I&#39;ll make you a deal. You provide me with some information from time to time and I&#39;ll take care of those pesky &#39;siblings&#39; of yours, hmm?&quot; Debbie slowly nodded as Selicia perused the redhead&#39;s purse and pulled out enough money to cover the meal. Setting it on the table before Debbie, Selicia stood to leave. &quot;Well be in touch Darling, I promise. Oh and keep the change... d...&quot; She slipped the d on the end as she waved toward the table. Debbie picked up the purse and must&#39;ve caught on because she stowed the shaker girl in it as well. <br />
<br />
Selicia silently reveled on her way to further exploration on a serendipitous find, she had watchers posted for her... She&#39;d hate to disappoint them without a show.</p>
