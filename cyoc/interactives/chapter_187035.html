<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Blair stared at the narrow strip of curly hairs on her lower leg as she felt them. Blair had to admit, she really liked the way they tickled her fingertips. But that wasn&#39;t what mattered. She had to get to the bottom of this! Blair immediately ruled out going to her parents. Mr. Belville was barely aware of Blair&#39;s existence and would probably respond by buying her an expensive present so she&#39;d quit bothering him. As for Mrs. Belville... Blair shuddered at the thought of her mom seeing her with even a scrap of leg hair. She&#39;d probably also be pissed that Blair had touched the brush without asking. And regarding Spencer... well, what the hell could Blair&#39;s eleven-year-old brother do?! Probably just take a picture of her leg with his phone and share it with his wisecracker friends.<br />
<br />
That just left Sierra. Sierra, the understanding older sister Blair had always been able to count on to help her. Much more promising. Even better, Mrs. Belville had stolen that brush from the sex party Sierra had been having with her college friends. She might actually know what in the name of God was going on! Blair threw the brush into her backpack, headed for the BMW M8 convertible her dad bought her for her sixteenth birthday, and set off for the house near the university campus that Sierra was renting.<br />
<br />
When Blair arrived, Blair noticed a bike and a motorcycle in the driveway. Sierra was apparently having company. Blair was greeted at the door by greeted at the door by Sierra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Blair!&quot; Sierra smiled. &quot;I love the way you&#39;ve grown out your hair! It&#39;s so long and thick, and—&quot; Sierra cut herself off. &quot;Wait, shouldn&#39;t you be in school? It&#39;s a Monday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably,&quot; said Blair, &quot;but this real freaky thing happened while I was getting ready and I need your help!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sierra nodded. &quot;Come on in, then. I&#39;m always happy to lend an ear. I&#39;ve got company, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blair followed her sister into the living room. Sitting on the couch were two girls around Sierra&#39;s age. One was a sweet-faced girl with brown hair and kind blue eyes. She was wearing a tie-dye T-shirt, a floral print skirt, sandals, peace sign earrings, and a pink headscarf. Her arms and legs were coated in dark, shaggy hair, and Blair thought she even saw a few hairs on the girl&#39;s upper lip. This had to be Meadow Larkin, Sierra&#39;s hippie friend who Blair had heard so much about from her mom&#39;s ravings. Blair tried not to rudely stare at Meadow&#39;s hairy limbs, but the sight was seriously turning her on.<br />
<br />
The other girl had hair dyed neon green that matched the darker green of her eyes. She had piercings in her ears, nostril, septum, nose bridge, eyebrow, philtrum, lower lip, and right cheek, and Blair suspected the girl had even more metal in her body hidden beneath her clothes. Blair marveled; all her mom let her get was earrings and a bellybutton piercing (the latter only after weeks of arguing). This girl was dressed in a black hoodie bearing the logo of a punk band called blink-182 that Blair&#39;s mom never let her listen to, a tartan miniskirt, torn-up fishnet stockings that showed off her tattoos, a black beanie with a skull-and-crossbones symbol, and Doc Martens boots. Blair&#39;s face flushed with envy. The girl was dressed exactly the way Blair had always wanted to dress, if only her control-freak mother would let her. Going off the description from Alejandra&#39;s fateful phone call, this girl was probably Krystal Brock, punk rocker extraordinaire.<br />
<br />
Blair felt the roof of her mouth go dry. She had heard her mother rant for hours about the incredible size of Krystal&#39;s pussy bush, and Blair longed to see the punks thick pubes for herself. Not that she would dare ask a stranger to show her pussy to her; Blair didn&#39;t want her gossipy school friends calling her a slut or a lesbian behind her back. (Even if she actually WAS the latter.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; said Krystal, waving. &quot;Friend of yours, Sierra?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Blair, guys,&quot; Sierra answered. &quot;My younger sister. She said something weird happened this morning, and she wants my advice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope it can be solved fucking quick,&quot; said Krystal. &quot;We&#39;re in pretty deep shit ourselves. We gotta finish making our plans if we&#39;re even gonna see than damn thing again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Krys, be nice,&quot; Meadow said reproachfully. She turned to Blair. &quot;So, Blair, how can we help you? My name&#39;s Meadow, by the way, and this is Krystal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Blair began, &quot;I woke up with my hair looking like crap as usual, so I went looking for a brush to fix it. Pretty normal so far, right? I went downstairs, and then I found THIS on the dining room table!&quot; Blair reached into her backpack and pulled out the magic hairbrush that had turned her day upside down.<br />
<br />
&quot;HOLY SHITBALLS!!!&quot; yelled Krystal. &quot;Look, Sierra! The brush! The fucking brush!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gaia&#39;s womb!&quot; Meadow swore. &quot;My brush! It&#39;s back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God!&quot; gasped Sierra. &quot;You found it, Blair!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a feeling Mom stole it from you guys,&quot; said Blair. &quot;She said you tried to hit her with it, Meadow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did not!&quot; Meadow retorted. &quot;I just stepped toward her while holding it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe you,&quot; said Blair. &quot;Mom&#39;s a nut.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Meadow agreed. &quot;She was giving off some pretty bad vibes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still can&#39;t believe you found our brush!&quot; cried Sierra. &quot;Meadow was gonna use it to undo my laser hair removal, but Mom stole it before she could get started!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy to help,&quot; Blair smiled. &quot;So, where&#39;d Meadow get a magic brush, anyway? Is she a witch or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Meadow, &quot;but I know one. I visited this magic supply shop because I wanted to thicken my body hair, and Circe herself sold me this baby!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez!&quot; said Blair. &quot;Maybe I was jumping to conclusions when I stopped believing in Santa Claus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what&#39;s your story with the brush?&quot; asked Krystal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Blair continued, &quot;I tried to brush the knots outta my hair with this thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would explain why it&#39;s so much longer,&quot; Sierra cut in. &quot;It was only an inch or two past your shoulders when I last saw you, and now it&#39;s growing down to your butt!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly!&quot; cried Blair. &quot;And then I dropped it and it hit my leg! Look!&quot; Blair gestured at the strip of leg hair beneath her shorts.<br />
<br />
Krystal leaned in. &quot;Fuckin&#39; sweet! Surprised you didn&#39;t add more after you found out what it did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;MORE leg hair?!&quot; shrieked Blair. &quot;With MY mother?! And I&#39;m on the cheer squad! I HAVE to stay shaved!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So brush some hairs on your cunt of a mom!&quot; scoffed Krystal. &quot;Those bitchy cheerleaders, too! That&#39;ll fucking teach &#39;em! Who knows? They might even like it. Point is, don&#39;t let some shit-stain establishment control your life. I worked that out when I was twelve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s got a point,&quot; said Sierra. &quot;I know you&#39;ve always liked how female body hair looks. Every time you see a hairy bush on HBO, you stare at it with your eyes bugged out. Don&#39;t be afraid. We can let you have a turn with the brush as soon as Meadow&#39;s done restoring me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blair thought about it. This was her dream, what she always thought about when she masturbated: herself as a shaggy cavewoman with a thick, luxuriant pelt of red hair from head to toe. She now had the power to make it happen! But what would the fallout be? Her mother would probably throw her out of the house, but she could always come live with Sierra. But what about school? The principal would probably give Blair hell about poor hygiene, and the cheer squad&#39;s coach would probably throw her off, or at least suspend her. Then there was Lacy Cunningham. Lacy was the captain of the cheer squad, a senator&#39;s daughter, Blair&#39;s &quot;best friend,&quot; the most popular girl in their expensive private school, and a totally vicious bitch. Blair could only imagine how LACY would react! But... could it be worth it to have the body of her dreams?</p>
