<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mandy felt himself bursting with pride but he could not admit to being an experienced kisser.<br />
<br />
Melissa had picked up the elephant and was now hugging that tightly to her chest. Mandy didn’t know what to do. Then their privacy was interrupted by 3 youths who began to play at the next machine.<br />
<br />
‘How about we go and get a drink while we wait for your sister?’ Mandy suggested to break the silence. They still had at least half an hour before the sister’s show would be finished.<br />
<br />
‘Sounds a good idea’ lead the way.<br />
<br />
Forgetting how old he was supposed to be Mandy led Melissa out of the arcade and down the street. There was a bar on the corner that seemed to be humping. Mandy went to lead Melissa through the door. Suddenly Melissa stopped her tight grip on Mandy’s hand stopped Mandy from proceeding as well. ‘We can’t go in there!’ <br />
<br />
Mandy immediately realised his mistake. ‘Opps! Sorry! What was I thinking. I thought this was a café. …… I thought we were on that corner’ He led the girl across the road. <br />
<br />
They took a seat in the café and ordered a coffee each. Mandy was upset that he had slipped up.<br />
<br />
Melissa asked ‘Does your Mum let you have alcohol?’<br />
<br />
Mandy pictured the real Paul wearing her body and her silk dress, sprawled on the recliner and chuckled inwardly ‘Just once. I drank a bottle and a half of wine. I had a terrible hangover’ <br />
<br />
‘I’m allowed 1 glass of wine when we have special dinners at home. My sister has let me taste her spirits. I like wine much better than spirits’<br />
<br />
‘I’ve learnt to take only a little at time’ Mandy replied. He hoped the real Paul had learnt that lesson.<br />
<br />
Melissa got a text. ‘We have to meet Linda at her car in 15 minutes. She is happy to take you home’ <br />
<br />
‘Where is her car?’<br />
<br />
Melissa led the way. They held hands. They found the car with 5 minutes to spare but Melissa didn’t have a key. It was near a park. Melissa pulled Mandy out from the street lights so they were in the shade of a tree. No one else was around. She pulled Mandy’s face down and they shared a second kiss. This one was still very good but did not last so long as the first kiss. Melissa pulled out. She asked “Paul” ‘Would you like to feel how bouncy my breasts are?’<br />
<br />
Mandy’s penis was once more causing a tent in her crotch. Surely Melissa must have noticed. He didn’t hesitate. He was probably as eager as the real Paul would have been. His hand reached up and felt Melissa’s breasts. Cupping them and bouncing them tenderly. They were large for a young girl. He could feel the lace of her bra through her dress. Mandy was fearful she would explode in her own trousers. <br />
<br />
‘That’s enough. I can hear someone coming’ <br />
<br />
Mandy immediately withdrew his hands and tried push his penis down. All that did was to draw Melissa’s attention to his tent.<br />
<br />
‘I see you approve’ was her comment<br />
<br />
By now Mandy could hear the sound of high heels on concrete. Melissa straightened out her dress. <br />
<br />
Fortunately, Mandy’s penis wilted quickly at the prospect of being caught by Linda and her boyfriend. He guessed they would not be happy if they knew what Mandy had just been doing.<br />
<br />
Linda proved to be an attractive redhead as well, an older version of Melissa. Her boyfriend was introduced as Thomas. He was a big guy and seemed a bit older than Linda. He looked at “Paul” closely as if checking him out. Mandy actually felt a bit intimidated.<br />
<br />
“Paul” was introduced by Melissa and they all got in the car. They were in the rear seat with the giant fluffy elephant placed between them. Mandy was feeling very nervous. It was only when Melissa reached across, behind the elephant and found his hand that he relaxed a little.<br />
<br />
As she drove Linda asked about the movie they had seen and what they had done while waiting. Mandy let Melissa answer. In return Melissa then asked Linda about the show they had seen. Mandy didn’t actually pay attention to Linda’s answer. He was too busy recalling how nice Melissa’s breasts had felt. He did wonder if his own breasts had felt so nice when he had owned a pair. No wonder men were breast obsessed.<br />
<br />
Mandy was initially unaware that Linda was asking where he lived. It wasn’t until Melissa repeated the question that he answered. He felt a bit guilty that Linda had to drive out of her way to drop him home. He supposed it was his reward for keeping Melissa company. He didn’t actually need a reward for doing that. <br />
<br />
The drive home was much quicker than the bus ride in. Before he knew it Linda had pulled over on the curb outside his house. He thanked Linda and her boyfriend for the ride but before he had finished Melissa had exited her door. Mandy exited the car herself. Melissa took his hand and led him halfway up the driveway, far enough away from her sister that they had some privacy.<br />
<br />
‘I need to do some shopping at Canvel Square tomorrow. Maybe I’ll see you there? I’ll text you a time’<br />
<br />
Mandy found herself tongue tied. This girl was direct. ‘Uh yeah sounds good’ She had no idea if the real Paul had any other plans for the next day. If he did Mandy would tell him to drop them. This girl was a catch.<br />
<br />
Should he give Melissa another kiss in front of her sister. He didn’t know. He was waiting for a signal from Melissa. She didn’t say goodbye. Mandy took that as a signal.<br />
<br />
‘Can I kiss you in front of Linda?’<br />
<br />
‘Please do’<br />
<br />
The kiss lingered. When she finally broke it off Melissa said ‘See you tomorrow’ before turning and returning to the car. If she waved Mandy couldn’t see. He remained where he was and waved to the car as it departed. It had been a good night.</p>
