<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Heee hhaaww hheee hhaaww hheee hhaaww!&quot; We both begin braying in unison. This is humiliating. I know they&#39;re watching. My mind is screaming, but my body doesn&#39;t care. I&#39;m taken back to the very first time I mated. This always happens in the throes of hot nasty donkey sex. My screaming mind is taken back to when I lost my virginity. As a donkey. I was also a virgin as a human, but I lost my virginity my very first day as a donkey, all those years ago. Though somehow, it doesn&#39;t seem like that long ago. <br />
<br />
They were there. My family. To see me off in my new home and environment. My parents took me to the facility, and my twin brother went along. There were government agents there. Doctors. Veterenarians. Handlers. Breeders. <br />
<br />
We were first taken on a tour  of the grounds of my new home. I still couldn&#39;t believe that I would be walking around on four legs by this afternoon. My brother stopped treating me with hostility throughout the last week of my human anatomy. But he was still treating me with a newfound underlying contempt. He wasn&#39;t happy when our friends and classmates found out what my fate was. He was embarrassed. But HE wasn&#39;t the one to live this deviant, nasty, humiliating, and limiting lifestyle. I was. <br />
<br />
My stomach was churning, as the tour guide directed us towards a barn. <br />
<br />
&quot;And here, we have Vin&#39;s living quarters, where he will be stabled tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
She opened the barn doors. I was nearly in tears, saying &quot;I just want to go home.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But dear, you are home. This is where you will belong from now on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please. No.&quot; I remember saying weakly, as a security guard roughly ushered me after the group.<br />
<br />
&quot;We already have everything set up. Over in this corner, is our little grooming area. We already have a set of horseshoes ready to protect your son&#39;s hooves from wear and tear. We know they&#39;ll be the right fit, because his future donkey twin wears this size.&quot;<br />
<br />
We were already briefed that I would have all of my DNA replaced by a real, natural-born donkey. Not many left in the world, which is why this program exists. To both reduce the human overpopulation, and increase the dwindling animal population.<br />
<br />
The tour guide passes around what is apparently the horse shoes that would end up adorning my hooves later on in the early evening. I didnt want to touch the things. Lord knows, I would be touching them all the time soon enough. <br />
<br />
&quot;The tour continued deeper into the barn. This here is going to be your stall.&quot; <br />
<br />
It looked clean enough. Bare, with nothing to do but apparently chew on some straw. Not even a bed, or a night stand. Nothing. Inside a smelly old barn. There was a name in large wooden letters on the stall door. &quot;Dominick.&quot; Next to what was apparently supposed to my stall, was a donkey who was chewing on some straw. <br />
<br />
&quot;And over here is Nestor. Hey Nestor! How you doing!?&quot; The tour guide said in a sing-song voice, as a large flared nostril surrounded by white fur poked out of the stall. The tour guide started scratching that snout, which was chest-high. The animal snorted a couple of times, as it bared its large flat teeth in a sign of relief. The name &quot;Nestor&quot; adornes his stall door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vin, come on over here and meet your new brother, Nestor.&quot;<br />
<br />
I hung back, stomach churning. That was him? That was the animal that would soon wipe away what makes me,  me? That huge snout with the large flared nostrils would soon belong on my face?<br />
<br />
I started trembling, while my family gathered around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,  Nestor! Look honey, he&#39;s so cute!&quot; said my mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;He stinks,&quot; said my brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you said you take care of them? Why does this lowly ANIMAL,&quot; said my dad derisively, &quot;have disgusting teeth!&quot; He continued, &quot;and will my son end up with teeth like those?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We do take care of them, of course. But some donkeys naturally have better teeth than others. This particular donkey does have bad teeth. But with so few animals, we don&#39;t have much to work with. This is what we have. And yes, young Max here will have those exact chompers inside his mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;s he so large? I thought donkeys were smaller?&quot; asked my brothers.<br />
<br />
The tour guide chuckled. &quot;They can typically reach 1,000 lbs. Nestor here, is on a special diet, as he has a weight problem. He weighs in tipping the scales at 1,356 lbs. As you can see, he is a bit rotund. Nestor is, in fact, obese. He has a thyroid problem, and a slow metabolism. He also tends to stuff his face whenever he can.&quot;<br />
<br />
The donkey suddenly made a horrific terrifying sound. &quot;Heee hhawww heeee haaww hheee hhaaww!&quot; he brayed. Then went back to chewing his straw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to sound like!&quot; said Ant. I wanted to puke. My dad huffed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Moving on....&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
I quietly rounded the corner to take a good, long look at my near future fate. Nestor. Tje damn animal looked up at me, and sniff. I then heard heard a loud splashing stream, and saw the uiest sight I&#39;ve ever seen. A HUUUUUUUGE black penis down between its legs letting loose a long, strong, steaming stream of hot, acrid piss all over i side its stall. It began pooling around all four of its hooves. Then its tail lifted, and let loose a foul-smelling fart as a huge lumps of grassy turds came tumbling out of it&#39;s rear-end. <br />
<br />
The damn animal looked directly at me, and I swear it grinned. Huge blocky, yellowish-green teeth with black around their edges. He then let loose with a loud, throaty &quot;heee HAAAWWWWW heeee HAAAWWW heeeee HAAAWWWW!&quot; as if in greeting, welcoming me to its life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee HAAAWWW hee HHHAAWWW heeee HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWW!!!&quot; I loudly brayed, my bodily deed done for this semi-annual affair. I come back to reality. This is when I most strongly desire to be rid of my disgusting, humiliating, handless donkey form.<br />
<br />
During my extra long extended climax, I feel like myself. My brain goes haywire in the most intensely realistic dream. In the dream, I&#39;m still me. A 15 year old teenage boy. Me, as I last was when human. My face. My hands. My two legs. My boyish good looks. My youth. <br />
<br />
When the climax is nearing completion, I am so thoroughly convinced that I am me. Vin Salvatore; rather than Dominick the Donkey. I am so convinced that I can just move freely and nimbly about. I am so convinced I am back in my childhood bedroom, and ready to run downstairs to eat something from the fridge. I am so convinced that I can still speak as a human.<br />
<br />
Once the climax is over, i slowly take a couple steps back and try to stand. Only to confusingly and fall forward. For a terrifying second, I am convinced I am going to fall flat on my face. Only to catch myself before I do. My &quot;arms&quot; oddly hold me up. They seem oddly long. Too long. Reality slowly dawns on me, as I realize I am on all fours. <br />
<br />
In my mind, I can &quot;feel&quot; my hands constrict and become hard and immobile. I feel a tail swaying rapidly back and forth in agitation. I then &quot;feel&quot; my face stretch out and reshape. Then it comes to full fruition in my mind. I&#39;m a donkey! I&#39;m still a fucking donkey! I dont want to be a donkey anymore! &quot;Heeee haaww hheee hhaaww!&quot; I bellow, unable to utter a single syllable.<br />
<br />
In my mind, out of pure desparation, I try to will myself back into human form. But of course, no matter how powerfully you will yourself to change physical appearances, you are stuck as you are. And so, I am cruelly kept prisoner in my donkey form.</p>
