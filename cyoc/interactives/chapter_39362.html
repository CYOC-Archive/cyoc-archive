<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time John and Jennifer arrived at school she had more or less forgotten about what had happened. There were so many other things for her to worry about, like how she and John were going on a date tomorrow and she planned on going on a shopping spree after school that day to have something fabulous to wear on it. It left her no time to consider the childish ramblings of a loser like Kyle.<br />
<br />
Thanks to her boyfriend she got to school right on time. Before heading off to class she gave John a big hug and kiss, &quot;Thanks so much, you're a real lifesaver.&quot;<br />
<br />
He just laughed, &quot;It was nothing, really.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that said, they went their separate ways. Jennifer's first class was biology, where she was alarmed to discover that there was a test. As one of the best cheerleaders in the school she spent so much time practicing and hanging out with the other girls that she had no time to worry about studying. Luckily for her, most of the teachers tended to let grades slide for the best athletes, since if their grades fell too low they were taken off the team. Jennifer still had to at least try on the tests though, and it ticked her off to no end. Like there was any place where she would use half of what she was learning in biology.<br />
<br />
Sitting down at her desk she read over the first page trying to see if there was anything she could answer. Luckily it was a multiple choice test, so she could guess and still have a chance of getting some right. Her mind was drawing a blank though, the only thing she could recall was Kyle's stupid dare, that she would turn partway into the next plant or animal that she touched. The thought made her smirk, he probably knew that biology was her first class of the day and figured that they would be dissecting frogs or something disgusting like that and that his dare would make her freak out. Well, the joke was on him, it was just a boring test.<br />
<br />
As she tried to guess her way through the test she found herself distracted by the tingling coming from between her legs. By the time the class was over it had moved up to her stomach.<br />
<br />
Her next class was physical education, which was a nice break after a terrible test. In the locker room she stripped down to change into her gym outfit. While getting undressed she noted that her legs were starting to get a bit hairy, which was odd since she was sure she had shaved them recently.<br />
<br />
Once again being a cheerleader came through for her, she and the rest of the girls on the team were allowed to go to the weight room rather than join in with what the rest of the class was doing. In theory they were supposed to workout to help them get ready for preforming, but in reality they mostly just sat around and gossiped.<br />
<br />
For some reason the gossip bored her today. Instead her mind kept going back to the phone call from Kyle, specifically all of the details. She was sure that there had been more to it than just changing into the next thing she touched, but the specifics escaped her.<br />
<br />
As she thought she found herself looking at her fellow cheerleaders in a new way. Normally she was dismissive of those who were not as attractive of her and jealous of those she considered to be prettier than her, but now she was realizing that they were all quite attractive, with their nimble bodies and ample breasts. She found herself smiling as she watched the way Tiffany's perky breasts bounced as she ran on a treadmill. Any other day she would have been upset by the sight, for Tiffany was one of the few girls that was regarded as having a better body than her, on this day she was willing to accept that Tiffany was attractive and not just attractive, but hot. Just the sight of her was enough to cause the tingling between Jennifer's legs to intensify.<br />
<br />
Blushing, she looked away before anyone realized that she was watching Tiffany so closely. It was then that she recalled more of Kyle's dare, that her sexual needs would increase. Could that be what was causing her to be so interested in the other girls?<br />
<br />
As soon as she had that thought she dismissed it, the curse was just a myth. She was just doing this to herself by thinking of it.<br />
<br />
Still, she spent the rest of the class watching the other girls, thinking about what they looked like in the locker room in nothing but their underwear.<br />
<br />
She left the weight room a little early, unable to handle the way her thoughts kept turning to what the other girls would look like naked. It was starting to creep her out that she couldn't get herself to calm down, not to mention how strong the tingling between her legs was getting.<br />
<br />
She went straight to the bathroom to look herself over, wondering if maybe the tingling was due to something being wrong down there. When she looked there was nothing out of the ordinary as far as she could tell. Maybe her clit looked a little bigger, but that might have been because she didn't normally look at it very closely.<br />
<br />
While she was looking she figured that she might as well have a little fun. She began to gently rub at her clit and was instantly rewarded by intense feelings of pleasure. Rubbing the little nub of flesh between her thumb and first finger she fought back a moan of pleasure. It felt even better than normal, probably because this was what she had needed all morning. Once this was over she was sure that the tingling would be gone. Something felt a little different, but since her eyes were closed with pleasure, she failed to notice that her clit was much thicker now, and the tip, a deep red color, was protruding from under the hood of skin that normally concealed it from view.<br />
<br />
When she finally found release she pulled her panties back up and got changed as though nothing had happened. The last thing she wanted to have happen was for the other girls to know about what she had done. Then again, if it was going to be that much fun, she would take the chance again. It had been like no orgasm she had ever experienced before, all focused in her clit and all the more intense for it.</p>
