<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max was walking alone down the street.<br />
 He wasn&#39;t walking to lose weight or going to hang out with someone. He was walking because he never knew how to drive. So all of his shopping and traveling to a dead-end job has to be within walking distance of his house. Well, it wasn&#39;t even his house to begin with. It was his stepfather&#39;s house that Max moved into when his childhood home was destroyed by one of the many &quot;Acts of God&quot;.<br />
<br />
Max is a heavyset man, with more fat than muscles. His face is covered with a thick, brown beard that matches his long hair that he always puts up in a bun. He mostly walks around in a simple graphic tee, jeans, and a side bag to hold his things, making him look more like a hipster even though he isn&#39;t one. And while Max can be social with everyone, he prefers to be alone most of the time.<br />
With today being his day off, and not wanting to stay in his cramp room any longer than he should, Max decided to take a short walk out and window shop for a bit. An hour later and finding nothing of note, Max heads home. But along the way back, Max&#39;s thoughts and attention drift away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why couldn&#39;t I escape from this? I mean, here I am in the prime of my life and haven&#39;t done much with it. My work takes so much out of me. Not to mention it also took my social life as well. All I wanted was a bit of freedom, to learn and explore life in general. Is that too much to as-&quot;<br />
<br />
Max&#39;s inner thoughts halted when he accidentally walked into a little sign on the sidewalk. On it was a sale for 50% off of select items. Max looks up to read the banner in front of the store. &quot;The Magic Shop: Your One Stop Shop with The Magical Materials&quot; with the establishment having disintegrated due to time. &quot;I could&#39;ve sworn that it was abandoned for months,&quot; Max thought out loud. &quot;Well, let&#39;s check it out. What is the worst that can happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
The first thing Max noticed was the smell of the shop. It was like a dozen incense were burning all at once, with none being pleasant. While trying to recover from the stench, Max tries to keep looking around. <br />
It was like a thrift store and a witches&#39; hut got a baby together and the baby was training to be like a new age store. In one corner of the shop, it was taken up with shelves of jars upon jars that contained plants and spices. Yet in another corner were glass cases filled with not only jewelry; but also electronic devices from the very recent to the 80&#39;s.<br />
In the middle of the store is the register where people pay for their items, but it is currently empty with no workers in sight. Walking around the empty stand, Max could see even more shelves and glass cases going deep into the store. Feeling a little unnerved by the sheer depths of the store, Max decided to take a closer look at the glass case by the front.<br />
<br />
Much like the quick glace from when Max first entered the shop, the glass cases have appliances and accessories from the commonplace to the bizarre. While there are decent devices to purchase, Max barely has enough money to pay for them. Let alone taking them home without some means of transport. So he shifted his attention to the jewelry and then he saw it.<br />
It was a ring placed amongst a bunch of other rings. But what drew Max&#39;s attention to it in the case was that it was a solid black ring with some specks of colors. Looking closer at the black ring revealed that it looked like a minuscule galaxy that gleamed and glowed without a light source.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think?&quot; a feminine voice snapped Max from his mesmerized stare, to which he freaked out. &quot;Ahh!&quot; Max turned around and started apologizing to what he presumed to be the worker or owner of the shop. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for scaring you like that. I was looking at -,&quot; was as far as Max&#39;s apology went until he saw the lady.<br />
The lady&#39;s breasts were the first thing Max saw when he turned around, and it wasn&#39;t because he was a perv. No, her breasts dominated her entire torso. It was stretching her dark blouse enough to see her ill-fitting bra. Max was sure that anyone could see her breasts, even looking from behind her. Speaking of behinds, Max could also see beyond the swell of her tits that the skirt looked like it was painted on her. After Max embarrassingly gawked at the woman&#39;s figure, he looked up at who the killer curves belonged to. <br />
It was a face that could only be found in a wet dream. Big, blue eyes that seemed to stare deeply at Max. Stylized, blond hair that her manicured hands were playing with. And a big set of lips that were made to suck that was currently frowning.<br />
Wait, frowning?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry to stare at you, Miss... Jackie,&quot; Max apologized again, finding her nametag pinned right on her left breast. &quot;It&#39;s just that I have never seen anyone like you before.&quot; Jackie, looking none too happy about the length of time Max was staring at her chest, accepted the apology. &quot;It&#39;s fine. Happens all the time.&quot; &quot;So,&quot; Jackie then walked around the glass case that contained the rings while her assets jiggled in their confinements, &quot;Did you happen to find something you liked?&quot;<br />
Max, not wanting to say that he liked her figure, said, &quot;Yeah, the black ring with the colorful spots on it that look like a little star system.&quot; Very carefully, Jackie squatted to open the case and grab the ring. &quot;Ah. This one, right?&quot; Jackie placed it on top of the case and presented it to Max.<br />
<br />
Now outside of the case, and nestled in the hand of a sexy woman, the ring seems to appear more colorful and appealing. &quot;It&#39;s beautiful, but I don&#39;t know if I can wear it or have enough money for it?&quot; Jackie giggled and said, &quot; Don&#39;t worry about the sizing, it can fit. As for the price, it was originally $20. But it is one of the few items that is a part of the 50% off sale, so only $10.&quot; Max pulls out his wallet and grabs the ten-dollar bill; the only bill in his wallet. &quot;Look at that, one ten-dollar bill,&quot; Max said as he handed the single note for the ring. &quot;And now I&#39;m broke once again.&quot; Max stared at his empty wallet, hoping more money was hidden in the folds.<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t have to be.&quot; <br />
<br />
Max looks back up at Jackie, who is returning from the register with his receipt. &quot;This is a magic store you walked in. And you have in your hand is The Universal Ring.&quot; Max can only look in disbelief (and arousal due to the jiggle-fest in Jackie&#39;s clothes). &quot;You can make and do anything you want with that ring, &quot;Jackie continues without any prompting from Max, &quot;All you have to do is to put it on and think about what you want to do.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hang on here,&quot; Max recovered his senses when he was given his receipt, &quot;If this ring can do anything, why was it on sale for half-off?&quot; &quot;Because as long as you keep wearing the ring, any random thoughts will trigger it. Enjoy.&quot; And with that, Jackie closed the front door in front of Max. This doesn&#39;t make sense since he was nowhere near the door before Jackie closed it. And yet, Max was outside of the store. Ten dollars poorer and one ring richer.</p>
