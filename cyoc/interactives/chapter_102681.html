In a mad dash, Kenya quickly dressed herself in her usual “work” clothes. A dress so tight you’d have thought she was born in it. The gold really stood out against her dark skin. She need only apply a little makeup to her face. She only wore it for “jobs”. Otherwise, Kenya felt she was beautiful enough as is. <br />
<br />
She did feel a bit guilty, since she had sort of kicked Nate out of her house. But she’d make it up to him, many times over. Kenya check the time as she left her house. Thankfully she still had ten minutes to spare to get to the pickup spot. Which happened to be five blocks down near the bridge. It  crossed over a small stream that was fed from the lake.  <br />
<br />
Kenya leaned against the rail and waited until a white limo pulled up along the side of the road. The driver was a normal named Alfred*, also Ashford’s right hand man so to speak. He was more than just a butler, or so Ashford had told her once. Alfred held the door for Kenya, taking his cap off as he did so. She always enjoyed the older man’s company. He treated her well, despite what she did for a living, or what she let him think she did. <br />
<br />
“It’s a pleasure to see you again Ms. Smythe. Did you have a good holiday?” he asked as Kenya ducked down to climb into the limo. <br />
<br />
“Yes, thank you for asking. And yours?”<br />
<br />
“Interesting. Master Ashford just spent most of the evening holed up in his office. His brother offered to come down, but you know how Master Ashford is. Stubborn as a mule, even if he takes after his father.” Alfred said before he got into the driver’s seat. <br />
<br />
“Mmm,” Kenya poured herself a glass of champagne. The bar was fully stocked, with everything from $200 bottles of wine, to some of the oldest liquors Kenya had ever seen (from the 1800s). As she sipped her drink, she watched as the small town became a blur. But they turned a corner, and Kenya thought she spotted Nate in the back of a Jeep. And for a brief second, she thought he spotted her too. <br />
<br />
 But as the car in question disappeared, so did Kenya’s concern. Nate wouldn’t find out. How could he? And this was a one time occurrence. She’d spend a one fun night with Jack Ashford, and also let him know she would be leaving the escort service. And that would be the last of things. <br />
<br />
“It’s not cheating if it’s just recreational. Besides, I’m sure Nate would do the same thing in my shoes. He’d be mad to turn down 10K for a night’s work.” Kenya thought. Her body loosened, as the champagne started to kick in. She sighed, and eagerly awaited <br />
<br />

<br />
Across town…<br />
<br />
Martin Stovall had throughly enjoyed his Friday. Not a sign of Alyssa, and his wife and daughter were getting along. Though Melissa and Martin both noticed that Julie seemed a bit preoccupied. With what Julie wouldn’t say. All she told them was that she had a few things on her mind. <br />
<br />
“I’ve made a doctor’s appointment for you Tuesday morning. You’ll miss the last few hours of school, but I think that’s a small price to pay.” Melissa told Julie. The two were sitting in their living room, Julie reading while Melissa was watching a program on TV. <br />
<br />
“You mean that specialist you wanted to take me to? How’s you get an appointment so soon?” Julie asked. Part of her agreement with her mom, regarding the mitigated sentence for her cheating on Eric, was that she went to an endocrinologist to see if any of her “crazy sex drive” was hormonal. <br />
<br />
“It was originally for me. But you need this more than I at the moment.” Melissa said. Martin came in from the kitchen, offering the two each a bowl of fruit salad. Melissa smiled and accepted the bowl, a bit surprised her husband made fruit salad. If there was one thing Martin hated, it was when fruit touched other fruit. But here he was, eating the melon and strawberries like nothing was out of the ordinary. <br />
<br />
“You feeling alright dear?” Melissa was worried something happened to him. First Martin nearly swam headfirst into a rock, and now this. Did some kind of brain parasite work its way into her husband’s brain, and started to rearrange things? <br />
<br />
“Never better.”<br />
<br />
“Really? You do realize you’re eating fruit salad don’t you?” <br />
<br />
Martin nodded as his mouth was full of several chunks of pineapple. <br />
<br />
“You hate fruit salad.” Melissa felt the need to remind him. <br />
<br />
“Ya, it’s not my favorite. But beggars can’t be choosers, and I know you two DO like it so here we are.” Martin said. He left the ladies to their own devices, wandering into his study to get some work done. Melissa and Julie both gave each other bewildered looks. But neither wanted to look a gift horse in the mouth. Martin was in a good mood, and things for all of them seemed to be looking up.<br />
<br />
Martin sat down in front of his computer, and was about to start working on some letters he needed to respond to when the screen flashed that he had several new emails. Most of them were spam, but there was another one from Alyssa. He groaned, and considered just trashing it. After he go home last night, the first thing he let her know that he was NOT interested in seeing her again, and that aside from any business they might see each other over, he did NOT want to even speak to her. <br />
<br />
Yes that was a little harsh, but Martin wanted a clean slate with his wife. And fooling around, let alone seeing, this girl was not how he wanted to start things. <br />
<br />
“Martin Stovall are you really dumping me (and I don’t mean like dumping like we were going out) over an email? Dick move buddy, a real classy act. Look, I get it. You’re married now right? Hey it’s not cheating until someone says it is. All I’m asking for is coffee or something. What’s the big deal? Could you please just call me? I’m going to start taking this personally. <br />
<br />
I miss hanging out with you. Maybe I could meet your wife, would that make things easier? You can just tell her I’m a friend, that’s all. No need to bring up our past. Unless she already knows, in which case if she wants to join us, I’m game. Let me know, or else I might have to track you down.  Alyssa” <br />
<br />
“My god she’s not going to give up until she sees my face is she?” Martin thought. <br />
<br />
His options were limited. Either he got this meeting over with, and then made sure he never saw Alyssa over again, or Alyssa would make a choice for him. Introducing her and Melissa was out of the question. Alyssa didn’t know Martin had a long list of former lovers. Melissa would immediately jump to the conclusion that Alyssa was just another one of Martin’s whores. <br />
<br />
“What am I going to do? I don’t want to see her, and I can’t seem to get rid of her. What am I doing to fucking do?” Martin put his head in his hands. <br />
<br />
He decided not to dwell on the problem for now. He buried himself in mountains of work. filling out forms, reading proposals, answering emails and returning phone calls. Martin kept his mind occupied, because he feared if he didn’t he’d think up some excuse TO see Alyssa And there was no way he could justify that. <br />
