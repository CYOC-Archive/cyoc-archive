<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE: Once again, great minds think alike folks. S1 managed to post &quot;Updates From Last Night and Frantic Warnings&quot; before I got home from work to post mine. S1 also managed to work in the Twists and another of the ongoing Moon Lake story lines too, so here&#39;s an <i>alternate</i> version of Martha&#39;s morning for your reading enjoyment.—tmw2015}<br />
<br />
Martha Anderson kissed her sister werecats and lovers goodbye, as she reluctantly left the Twist&#39;s house and walked back to her own.<br />
Inside, she found William cleaning up the dining room table from breakfast.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that honey. I&#39;ll take care of it,&quot; she said, while walking up to her husband and giving him a big, lusty kiss.<br />
&quot;How did your date night with the girls go?&quot; he asked, after they broke for air.<br />
&quot;Purrfect,&quot; she said with a smile, while nuzzling his neck.<br />
William put his arms around Martha and said, &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; while returning the neck nuzzle with one of his own.<br />
The married couple felt the sexual arousal rise in each other, so Martha asked, &quot;What time do you have to be at work, dear?&quot;<br />
&quot;Before ten,&quot; replied William, as he started to unzip the back of her dress.<br />
Martha glanced at the wall clock, and saw it wasn&#39;t even 7:30 yet. &quot;Grrrreat,&quot; she said, as she reached down to free the bulge rising in her husband&#39;s pants.<br />
<br />
They never made it upstairs to their bedroom. The two hastily undressed each other, stepped out of the pile of clothing that gathered around their feet, and then William Anderson mounted his wife right there on the carpet of the dining room floor.<br />
As if by mutual agreement, neither immediately changed into their respective were forms. Martha felt the carpet&#39;s shag pile rub against the bare skin of her back as William drove deeply into her, his weight upon her body as he caressed one breast while licking the nipple of the other.<br />
He alternated breasts as she playfully nipped and nuzzled his neck again, running her hands all over what she could reach of the bare skin of his body.<br />
As they experienced a mutual orgasm together, she kissed him, their tongues dancing within each other&#39;s mouth.<br />
A couple of minutes of tender kissing and caressing later, Martha felt her husband&#39;s cock hardening within her once more.<br />
&quot;Want to go again?&quot; she asked, as William saw her start to change into her werecat fursona.<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; he said, releasing the werefox within him as he started to make love to her once more.<br />
<br />
Martha screamed in pleasure as she felt her fox&#39;s top knot drive deep within her already moist and well used vagina. Last night with Samantha and Frances was wonderful. A completion of her soul beyond description that she looked forward to on a regular basis.<br />
Yet there was no denying that she also deeply and truly loved William Anderson, and not just for moments like this. He was her friend, lover, husband, the father of her children; and despite their rocky moments of the past, William was also her present and future. Even without the werefox life/mate bonding, William Anderson was the only man in her life, and Martha wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.<br />
She wrapped her furry legs around him as she grabbed his shoulders (careful not to claw him), urging William to penetrate her as hard and as deeply as he could, even as she shouted &quot;Take me! I&#39;m yours! Now and fur-ever Mister Anderson!&quot;<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m yours Mrs. Anderson!&quot; he shouted in return, their tails thumping in unison, before the happy couple passed out from mutual orgasmic bliss.<br />
<br />
Waking up from their brief nap around 8:25, the weres went upstairs and resumed their human forms before taking a long, pleasurable shower together.<br />
They managed to restrain themselves from further sexual activity afterward, as William dried off and got dressed for the day.<br />
The Andersons discussed other matters. They shared their thoughts on Nate and Alex Ramsey. It was good that Nate had come to terms about his sexuality, had told them, and found somebody who liked him, but realized that any long term relationship between the boys would need to be based on more than just being sexually active gay werewolves with high libidos together.<br />
They then discussed the growing relationship between Eric and Julie Stovall. William and Martha both agreed that the two Freshmen truly loved each other, and would be surprised if Eric didn&#39;t become a were-merman before his Senior year. &quot;If he waits <i>that</i> long,&quot; realized William.<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; asked Martha, before her husband recounted their conversation of last night. &quot;But what if he doesn&#39;t become a were-mer?&quot; she asked afterward.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; admitted William, shrugging his shoulders while straightening his tie and making sure he had everything in his briefcase for the day.<br />
&quot;We know Eric has had his own issues growing up so far, even without having to deal with our problems and Yvette Smith too. Should I have Frances talk to him?&quot;<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s keep that option in reserve, for now,&quot; suggested William, as he started to head downstairs.<br />
<br />
Martha followed him, wearing just a robe and a contented smile, asking William if he had any dinner suggestions for hosting Alex, to which all he could answer was &quot;Keep it simple, but include meat.&quot;<br />
Alone in the house, Martha finished cleaning the table and the kitchen from breakfast, took out a pot roast from the freezer to start defrosting, made herself a cup of coffee, and then sat down at the dining room table with all the study material William gathered from the college for her teaching recertification.<br />
<br />
Intently pouring over the material, it took Martha completely by surprise when she looked up from her now empty coffee cup and discovered it was noon!<br />
Taking the empty cup to the kitchen sink, she checked on the thawing pot roast, which thankfully would be ready to cook and eat in time for dinner tonight.<br />
As she walked back into the dining room, she looked around the empty house, before her eyes settled back down on the study materials.<br />
<i>Thanks to our new a-were-ness, there&#39;s no rush to having another child right away now,</i> she realized. <i>William and I have the time to get organized and enjoy our new lives here in Moon Lake. A couple of years after I&#39;m a full time teacher again, then I&#39;ll stop taking the werecat birth control pill and we&#39;ll have another child. By then Nate will be in college and Eric graduating high school, although I can&#39;t help wondering if at least one of them will be proposing to their significant other by then?</i><br />
Martha smiled at the thought as she went upstairs.<br />
Back in the master bedroom, Martha let the bathrobe drop to the floor as she assumed her werecat form again while walking to the king sized bed she shared with William.<br />
She stretched out across the mattress and yawned before settling down for a catnap.<br />
Martha&#39;s tail twitched in contentment as thoughts of welcoming a daughter werecat into the world before becoming a grandmother danced in her mind as she dozed in the afternoon sun shining through the bedroom windows.<br />
