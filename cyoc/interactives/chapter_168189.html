<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">October rushed into the room. Kelvin watched, a little confused, he made his way down the few steps before the bottom and looked into the room. What he saw, he couldn’t have even imagined.<br />
<br />
October was standing next to a girl, she was red, all over. Her hair, her skin, her lips, eyes, everything. Her body all over was big, like everywhere possible was rounded like a ball. Her belly looked pregnant, bigger than it should be. Her breasts were incredibly round. Her hips formed a circle, her butt, each cheek formed what looked like a bowling ball of shape. Her arms, each part as rounded as possible, her hand looked swelled up, her fingers. It looked like she was having some sort of allergic reaction. Her nose, the tip of it was rounded, her lips were circled, her cheeks were puffed up. Her head was rounded, unnaturally rounded. Her eyes were bulging, the pupils red as red an Apple. But as Kelvin looked at her face, her hair, he recognised who she was. Yuri.<br />
“Wh-what happened to her!?” Kelvin asked October, who was already preoccupied with the red girl,<br />
“I told you I put a curse down here, I didn’t know anyone else would be down here,”<br />
“Oh my god!” Kelvin yelled, “w-where’s Chelsea,”<br />
“Behind you,” October said back. Kelvin was looking at Yuri, he saw a green stem looking thing grow out of the top of her head. He turned himself around, expecting to see another bloated in many areas, red version of his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Instead, he was his girlfriend. But she wasn’t like before. She was grey, dull. Her hair was grey, getting greyer by the second. Her face was wrinkled, her skin looked frail and worn. He saw his girlfriends decently sized B cup breasts sagging, through her shirt, reaching just above her belly button. Her body was frail, weak. Her skin was thinner than before. Kelvin didn’t know what to do,<br />
“Kelvin...” the old woman Chelsea said, her voice decaying. She looked around 90 years old, and still rapidly aging.<br />
“Chel!” Kelvin said, he didn’t want to touch of fear he’d hurt her, “October!?” He quickly turned and yelled,<br />
“Here!” October yelled back, she conjured up a red mist, she reached her hand in and pulled out a small green yellow vial. She said, “catch,” and flicked the vial towards Kelvin. Without any ounce of bad coordination, Kelvin caught the vial without moving his hand too much. He pulled the cork right off the top of the vial and poured it down his girlfriend’s throat.<br />
<br />
He watched as her face almost immediately began to lighten. Her skin thickening, becoming a little more youthful. Her hair became a little darker, but retained its grey colour. Her wrinkles became a little less prevalent, but not disappearing completely. She seemed to have de-aged around 30 or more years, which would be pretty amazing if she hadn’t started at 90 years old. Kelvin was relieved, Chelsea looked down, she let out a breath, almost as if she’d been holding her breath for a while. But before anyone could get too comfortable, the now 60 year old Chelsea felt her stomach begin to gargle, like her stomach wasn’t reacting well to a food. Kelvin watched as her belly began to bloat outwards. Not with air, but with fat. Her belly got fatter and fatter, sticking out further. Her jeans button popped right off and flew across the room. Her flabby belly drooped over her waistline. Her legs thickened as this was happening her butt growing larger too, not huge but bigger. Then her breasts, they were already saggy, Chelsea wasn’t wearing a bra was not helping, but each breast grew a cup size, then another. By the end, her breasts were DD’s, sagging down to her stomach and resting in top of it.<br />
<br />
“What just happened to me!?” Chelsea yelled as loud as she could, her voice was still wobbly,<br />
“You drank an Age potion I made earlier today,” October said,<br />
“Why the hell did you make that?”<br />
“I didn’t mean to make it that strong, you’re lucky I had that vial, you would have become too old and might have-”<br />
“Yeah, yeah I get it. I’m guessing you didn’t mean to make that Apple do that, then?” Chelsea pointed to Yuri, who’s eyes were lost to space, dazing away somewhere completely different.<br />
“No I didn’t. And please don’t freak out but I can’t fix you,”<br />
“What!?” Chelsea yelled, immediately freaked out,<br />
“Wait! I can’t fix you yet, but when I get the power of my grandmother I will be able to. But you’re just going to have to be patient. Kelvin, you can go.”<br />
“What? No, I’m staying here with Chelse-”<br />
“Kelvin.” Chelsea said, looking right at him, Kelvin saw only her eyes, the only part of her that hadn’t changed, “please go. October knows what she’s doing, and I promise I’ll come to you when I’m back to normal,”<br />
“N-no I... I...” Kelvin looked as if he was about to cry. He turned to October, “please try and fix her. Please,”<br />
<br />
Kelvin looked at Chelsea again, in her eyes. He gave her a huge hug. There was a bit of an inconvenience when it came to her stomach, Kelvin leaned a little further but still, he hugged her. He turned his head and kissed her on the cheek, he whispered something in her ear before backing away. October didn’t hear what he said, and though she knew how to use magic to hear it, she chose not to. Kelvin walked to the staircase, he turned his head again, October was back to work with Yuri, looking through book after book for something. Yuri was still bumpy all over. October had conjured a magical tape measure and was looking at the green stem that had sprouted out of the top of Yuri’s head. Chelsea was looking at him, she smiled, a few wrinkles outlined as she did. Kelvin made his way up the staircase and to the front door. He opened it, stepped outside, and closed it behind himself. As he began walking down the sidewalk, he said to himself,<br />
“She’ll be okay,”<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“So. Good news and bad news,” October said. Yuri was right next to her but her mind was clearly elsewhere. Chelsea responded,<br />
“The good news first,”<br />
“I should be able to fix you both,” October started, “that’s the good news,” she looked at Chelsea, who gave her a look of, ‘go on’, “but I won’t be able to do it until this new power comes through,”<br />
“And how long is that gonna take, October? I don’t want to be stuck here as an old woman for-”<br />
“You’re not an old woman, Chelsea,” October remarked,<br />
“October. How old am I, use your magic,” Chelsea replied, October reluctantly waved her hand, a green mist grew from it and surrounded Chelsea, it flew back to October’s hand. She quietly said, in her posh accent,<br />
“Sixty-six...”<br />
“October! I’m old enough to be my grandma!!” She yelled, coughing after, her voice wasn’t made for yelling in her current state, “Wait...” she said, thinking for a moment, “October I’m older than my grandma, I’m a year younger than my grandfather!?”<br />
“I know, but I’m doing everything I can. You should thank my dad, he’s the one that brewed that potion that saved your life. You made it to ninety-four, and would have gotten older,”<br />
“October!!” Chelsea yelled, once again coughing afterwards, “I bet you I was older than your great grandmother even was,” October couldn’t help but chuckle at Chelsea’s remark, “what?”<br />
“My grandmother was two-hundred and twenty-eight,”<br />
“Oh,” Chelsea said, a little embarrassed, “I kinda forgot your family are magical,”<br />
“It’s fine. But seriously, Chelsea, I will have this under control. We just have to be patient. The book said that the effect’s could begin anywhere between five minutes and one hour. So they could start at any point,”<br />
“Okay, will you be able to like... feel it?”<br />
“I don’t know, if I’m honest,” October said,<br />
“That’s unlike you,” Chelsea said, both her and October chuckled,<br />
They stood in silence, October looked back at the book on the table, still searching for some sort of cure for Yuri’s condition, Chelsea’s was clearly much less severe, but would still be hard to figure out,<br />
<br />
“So... October. I have been meaning to ask you this,” Chelsea said,<br />
“M-hm,” October said, a little preoccupied but didn’t say anything,<br />
“You know...” she hesitated, “it’s not a conversation you usually get in on, dating,” this made October’s head fly up, she turned it to Chelsea,<br />
“Yeah...”<br />
“Well... y’know. Me and Yuri, she dates all the time, like that girl she was dating a couple months ago, and that other boy who we met at... where was it?”<br />
“Chelsea? What are you saying here?”<br />
“Well... since I got a boyfriend, I just... I wondered why you haven’t dated anyone before. I mean me and Yuri talk about boys all the time, and you never seem too interested in it,”<br />
“Wow,” October said, she leant back in her chair, taking a breath, “you’re starting to sound like my mom,” she looked Chelsea up and down, “and you don’t look far from her right now,”<br />
“Oh please. Your mom has a great figure,”<br />
“Oh you haven’t seen her recently,”<br />
“Oh yeah. I totally forgot about that,”<br />
“but the question...” October was looking up at the ceiling, thinking,<br />
“October, if you don’t wanna answer the question just tell me,”<br />
“No... no it’s not that. I guess I just... don’t really think about people that way. I haven’t ever really had a crush, or wanted to kiss anyone, or do anything with anyone. I’m not sure.” October said, she removed her eyes from the ceiling and looked at Chelsea, “I guess it’s just not the way I work,”<br />
“Hm. That’s okay, I mean I’m not sure what kind of answer I was expect-”<br />
<br />
Chelsea was interrupted by the sound of October’s front door bursting open. October heard the lock break, she quickly summoned a dagger and held it close to her chest, she ushered Chelsea behind her, next to Yuri who still wasn’t thinking straight... or at all.<br />
October couldn’t help but think that her parents had been awoken by that. She heard the stairs creaking, step by step, whoever it was was in a panic. October sensed whoever this was get closer and closer. Each step made October’s heart beat a little faster. She hoped for a familiar face.<br />
<br />
Then, stumbling down the stairs, revealed a woman. Her whole face was green, in fact, her whole body was green. Her hair, it was coloured in segments of different shades of green from her skin, all different. Her teeth were all pointed, like slightly more dulled shark teeth, not very sharp but definitely not human. She was slim, her waist was thin and her hips were fairly large. Her breasts were decently sized, just slightly larger than average size. Her butt seemed to match her breasts, just slightly larger than average. Her face was very attractive, good structure, symmetrical. Her arms were covered with tattoo’s. Filled with pictures of ancient creatures and writing in a language so old October couldn’t even read it. The tattoo’s covered her arms, and partially her legs. She had a large tattoo from her neck that travelled down to the top of her chest in an arrow like shape. She was tall, she must have been six feet or above, taller than anyone in the room. She had the body of a model.<br />
Her clothes, they didn’t match her look at all. Her look was elegant, attractive, well balanced, but her clothes seemed to be regular clothes. They didn’t fit her either. Her stomach was showing, it was toned, very flat and admirable. She didn’t have a belly button. Her shoes looked too small for her feet, then she spoke,<br />
“W-what...” she let out, before covering her mouth. Her voice was deeper than any other girl in the room. It was mature, sultry. Her eyes were dark, the outside of her eyes, instead of white, were black.  October felt her shoulder be touched, she turned her head and saw Chelsea slowly push her out of the way and look at the green woman up and down,<br />
“K-Kelvin?” She questioned,</p>
