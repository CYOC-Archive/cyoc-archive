<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was surprised by the knock at his bedroom door, so soon after he finished talking to June. Was there something she had forgotten to tell him? Did she want another transformation? He wanted her to be happy, but he didn&#39;t want to constantly be transforming her. He opened his bedroom door, about to tell her that, when he saw that it was Mark standing there. &quot;We need to talk,&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
Ty was afraid that he was about to get a royal chewing-out for what he&#39;d done. &quot;OK, Dad,&quot; he said, looking down at in shame. &quot;Come on in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty was irritated that private talks with his parents in his bedroom were becoming a routine occurrence, and since there was only the one chair, at his desk, he always had to sit on his bed. I can at least fix that problem, he thought. He waved his hand, and his bedroom expanded to accomodate a small conference table with four executive chairs. Mark did a double-take, but Ty just said, &quot;Have a seat,&quot; and took a chair opposite him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m very sorry for what I did to Mom,&quot; Ty said. &quot;We don&#39;t have the formal rules that Lisa&#39;s parents insisted on, regarding my powers, but I still take June&#39;s safety very seriously. I would never deliberately hurt her, but I take full responsibility for what I did, and will accept whatever punishment you think I deserve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;What?&quot; Mark said in surprise. &quot;I&#39;m not here to punish you. June told me what happened today, but it was she who overdid it, and you that made sure she was wasn&#39;t hurt, then fixed her when her transformation went awry. No, son, I don&#39;t think you did anything wrong. In fact, I&#39;m very grateful that you handled the problem so well, and protected June!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty looked up in wonder. &quot;But Dad, I thought you didn&#39;t like my transforming Mom. At dinner last night, when you asked whether she&#39;d enjoyed being the dryer, you seemed... disapproving? Disgusted?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that,&quot; Mark said. &quot;You&#39;re right that I wasn&#39;t happy about it at the time. June had called me about her idea to have you transform into the clothes dryer. I didn&#39;t much like it, but I appreciated that she checked with me. Of course, she&#39;s an adult, and can make her own choices, so I told her that as long as you could transform her safely, that I didn&#39;t object.<br />
<br />
&quot;My unhappiness over her transformations was due to... well, she had previously told be how much sexual stimulation she got in app form, and she was expecting that of dryer form as well. I was unhappy that she was going to get so much sexual stimulation without... without me. I was jealous. Of the clothes dryer, can you even imagine?<br />
<br />
&quot;And... I hate to admit it, but I was afraid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty hadn&#39;t expected that. &quot;Afraid? Dad, what were you afraid of?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was afraid that I&#39;d lose her,&quot; Mark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I would always transform her back! I&#39;d never let you lose her!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not like that, Ty,&quot; Mark said. &quot;I know you wouldn&#39;t hurt her, or leave her permanently in some non-human form. I was afraid that I&#39;d lose her, because she&#39;d no longer need me. Her needs would be met by being a clothes dryer. Or whatever other things she had you transform her into.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Dad!&quot; Ty said. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry! I never thought that transforming June might hurt you like that! You&#39;re not...&quot; Ty swallowed. He had a hard time even asking the question. &quot;You&#39;re not going to get divorced, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Of course not, Ty! I love her!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But if you and she are no longer...&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;d divorce her even then,&quot; Mark said. &quot;Love is about a lot more than just sex, you know. Or maybe you don&#39;t yet. With your amazing powers, it&#39;s easy for me to forget that you&#39;re a 15 year old boy. No, I wouldn&#39;t leave your mother over not getting sex, though I&#39;d be very unhappy about it. But Ty, did you notice that my attitude was different at breakfast this morning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes &quot; Ty admitted. &quot;And I was very puzzled by that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, last night, June told me in more detail about her experiences as the dryer, and how wonderful it was. I was convinced that the transformations spelled the end of our love life. But I was wrong! Being the dryer had been very stimulating for her, but it made her very needy! I wasn&#39;t losing that aspect of her. Instead, our sex was better than ever!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty was a bit embarrassed, but also quite relieved. And he&#39;d seen for himself this afternoon just how needy the transformations made her.  &quot;Oh, Dad! That&#39;s great! I&#39;d thought I&#39;d somehow driven a wedge between the two of you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;d thought, too, though I knew you didn&#39;t intend to.&quot; Mark said, &quot;But that was why I had a bad attitude at dinner last night. However, it seems that everything will be fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to thank you for one other thing,&quot; Mark said. &quot;June explained to me even some of the, um, details of what she did today, and I also want to thank you for not taking advantage of her when she was in that state, despite her demands.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad! You don&#39;t have to thank me for that! I would never! I&#39;m not attracted to her like that! And I knew she wasn&#39;t in her right mind!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, Ty. I&#39;m glad to hear it. I think you&#39;re more mature than I was at your age. I would have fucked anything with a hole. If my mother had demanded that I fuck her, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have said no.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Dad, I don&#39;t think I needed to hear that! Too much information!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, well, sorry,&quot; Mark said. &quot;But the point is that I appreciate your integrity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty thought for a moment. &quot;Well, if you&#39;re not here to punish me for what I did to Mom this afternoon, and if I haven&#39;t screwed up your marital relations, ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what did I want to talk to you about?&quot; said Mark. &quot;Well, everything isn&#39;t _completely_ perfect. I do have a few requests.&quot;</p>
