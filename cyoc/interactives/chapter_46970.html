<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark's weekend started with a bang. He found his favorite cereal in one of the kitchen cupboards. Lucky Charms. Apparently it was also the dog's favorite too, as Mark realized when the bigger of two went bat shit crazy over the box whilst the smaller strolled in as relaxed ever. Mark then remembered that the dogs ate human food so he just poured them both a bowl and left them to chow down. Yet something was still wrong. It then hit him when the smaller of the two put his paw on the refrigerator that they wanted milk on their breakfast. Mark got the milk out, wondering when the last time he had put milk on his cereal, and poured it into the bowls labeled &quot;Jazz&quot; and &quot;Titus&quot;, the smaller of the two heading to &quot;Jazz&quot; and the larger headed toward &quot;Titus&quot;.<br />
<br />
It was halfway through the meal that Mark started to wonder why the pets were being fed human food. He decided to check to see if there was any dog food in one of the cupboards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strange, there isn't any&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day consisted of the other things on the list of things to do. Taking Jazz and Titus out for walks, cleaning the house, making the meals for him and the dogs. It wasn't until around 11 o'clock that Mark got to relax. He decided to lay down on the bed. That was when he saw the TV and DVD player next to it. He remembered that Tom and Jeff had once showed him porn films before they set off on having their first three-way. He decided that he would have some &quot;happy time&quot; so started to search for something to watch. It wasn't until he found something an unlabeled case that he found anything he didn't actually own himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great men with great taste in sex&quot; Mark said to himself.<br />
<br />
He opened the case and found the title handwritten on the DVD.<br />
<br />
&quot;Home movie&quot;<br />
<br />
The title was &quot;Doggy with Jeff and Tom&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doggy style. This is defiantly a watch&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark turned on the TV, closed the door and put the DVD into the player. He then stripped off all his clothes and grabbed the lube and tissues he'd been shown last time. The film started. Jeff was the first in the film, laying butt naked on the bed, with Tom appearing from behind the camera, which was obviously on a tripod, also in his birthday suit. Tom and Jeff then started to make out on the bed, the two locking lips like they hadn't seen each other in years. The two then started to look at each other, and something weird started to happen. Tom was panting; his mouth seemed to be stretching, turning into a... muzzle! His body started to become really hairy... no, furry! His legs shifted, the bones cracking. For some reason, this didn't make Tom cry out in the pain, but rather pleasure, his dick becoming erect. This wasn't the end of this weird event though, his dick then started to turn into that of a DOG'S! Tom's moans started turning into howls. Mark didn't have a clue what was going on until Tom finished his transformation into a dog. It was then that Mark made the connection. Tom had turned into a German shepherd, a LARGE German shepherd. He tried denying what he had seen until Jeff, now sporting a hard on said &quot;Here Titus&quot;.<br />
<br />
Tom, Titus, Jeff, Jazz, human food, the perspective of the letter! It all made sense now, Tom and Jeff were the dogs! The title of the DVD, &quot;Doggy&quot; literally meant DOGGY!<br />
<br />
It was then Mark turned back to the TV screen, apparently Jeff had decided to go into his doggy form as well, the finishing touches now appearing such as the tail full stretching out. The two then started to have passionate sex on the bed.<br />
<br />
Mark watched the film for about an hour. He wasn't scared. He wasn't curious. He was, however, most definitely aroused. He had been jacking off for ages. The film was something he had never dreamed about before but transformation of his bosses appeared to be a turn on for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;We see that you are very happy then&quot; said a voice coming from behind him.<br />
<br />
Mark fell off the bed. He turned around to see Tom and Jeff behind, both naked. Patches of fur seeping back into their bodies.<br />
<br />
“How did you get in!?!?” Mark screamed “I closed the door!”<br />
<br />
“We’ve been in the en-suite” said Jeff “We were in there when we heard you coming into the bedroom. We were going to come out until we saw what you were watching. We decided it was best for you to know rather than to lie.”<br />
<br />
“Besides, we couldn’t really come out when you were in a state of shock. The last thing you needed was a heart attack.” Tom continued.<br />
<br />
“We need to do some explaining.”<br />
<br />
“It was ten years ago, we were in gay bar in San Fran. A German man approached us, said he knew we were looking for a different experience. Said he could give it to us. We followed him back to his apartment. It was there that he showed us he could turn into a dog, a German shepherd to be more precise. He told us if we drank his canine sperm that we could also turn into dogs. He told us our sex lives would improve, our bodies would become more muscled and we would be able to experience life like we never had before.”<br />
<br />
“We now want to give you the same chance”<br />
<br />
Jeff started massaging Tom cock, giving him a hard on. At the same time, Tom started change, the muzzle coming first along with the legs and fur.<br />
<br />
“If you suck Tom’s, or should I say Titus’s, cock you’ll gain power that we have. The ability to turn into what we can, to become a bigger man, to experience life like never before.” Jeff said. “The choice is yours. If you don’t want to do this then you don’t have to.”</p>
