<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Once things reformed I found myself running through a forest naked my large breasts bouncing painfully on my chest. My legs were 
turning to jelly but I didn't dare stop. I didn't know what I was running from but I was afraid for my life. I heard branches snapping behind 
me and pushed myself harder. I had to get away or else I would die. Suddenly I felt a sharp prick in my ass which caused me to 
stumble and fall down. I went to pick myself up but as I was my arms decided to stop obeying me and just relaxed causing me to drop 
back down. Fortunately I was able to turn my head so my nose wasn't broken and I could breathe. More branches snapped getting 
louder telling me that whatever I was running from was getting closer. I tried moving but my body wouldn't obey.</p>
<p>A pair of boots came into my view and the owner of those boots said,"I told you I'd be the one to take her down Jim."</p>
<p>"Ok Ron you win," another voice said behind me which must have been Jim.</p>
<p>"Well she led us on a good chase for a guy transformed into a woman," Ron said laughing. "The others had stopped after a bit to 
fuck themselves."</p>
<p>"And fuck themselves they did making it easier for us to catch them," Jim said a smile in his voice.</p>
<p>"Well time to gut her," Ron said rolling me onto my back giving me a look at the two. They were obviously brothers sharing the 
same features. The only difference I could see was that Ron wore a beard whereas Jim was clean shaven. They must be identical twins 
though if they had transformed me then it was possible one or both of them had been transformed to. Though how did they transform 
me? I wasn't as old as I seemed to be and I didn't have these large breasts.</p>
<p>I didn't get to wonder long as Ron took a sharp knife and cut me from my pelvic bone to my sternum. The pain was more than one 
could bear without screaming which I wanted to do but couldn't. Jim parted my skin some and Ron cut me again. He then spread my 
legs and cut around my pussy. They rolled me onto my other side and my guts spilled out onto a tarp. Ron carefully cut out my 
diaphragm and let it spill out onto the tarp as well. I couldn't breathe now and I was expecting to black out soon. Ron took a couple zip 
strips and tied off my digestive tract above my stomach and then just about at my asshole where he cut letting that end spill out. Finally 
he reached up into my chest cavity and cut my windpipe pulling my lungs and heart out. As they separated my guts into separate bags 
they discussed how they were going to cook me. I was going to be cooked over an open fire on a spit. Finally as they were washing me 
out a black haze settled over my eyes and I slipped into the darkness of death.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>I woke up and sat bolt upright in my bed breathing heavily. I looked around wildly expecting to be in that forest but only saw the 
room I share with my two older sisters. I slid out of bed and lifted up my nightgown to double check my belly. I was relieved to see that 
I hadn't been cut. I shook my head chiding myself for thinking that I would be cut. It was only a dream after all but it had seemed so 
real. I shook my head again reminding myself that I was twelve years old, not eighteen or however old I was. Sighing I notice that my 
diaper is wet so I go over to my dresser and get a fresh one. I kinda wished that I could wear regular underwear like other girls but then 
I wouldn't be able to shift like my mommy and sisters. For some reason the shifters in Mommy's family have a problem feeling when 
they have to pee so it's become a necessity to wear diapers. It may be embarrassing wearing a diaper and being called a baby but it 
was better then wetting my pants. After I changed my diaper I grabbed my diary and a book and went climbed back into bed. I've been 
sick for the last few days and Mommy wanted me to stay in bed. I tucked a loose strand of red hair behind my ear and started writing 
down my dream in my diary.</p>
<p>I was reading my book when Mommy came in with a tray and asked, "Do you think you can eat something Ariel sweetie?"</p>
<p>"I'll try," I said putting my book down and sitting up a bit more.</p>
<p>Mommy set the tray across me and sat down on my bed. As I started eating the chicken noodle soup she said, "They haven't found 
Erika or Ann yet."</p>
<p>I looked at Mommy and asked, "Is it really related to what happened to Janet?"</p>
<p>"Witnesses did say there was a strange woman seen before Janet died and Erika and Ann went missing," Mommy said after a few 
seconds. "I've been having second thoughts about letting you go to Janet's funeral. Not only are you still sick but I'm afraid that whoever 
killed Janet and took Erika and Ann will be there and see you. I don't want you disappearing too or being killed. I don't know what I 
would do if that happened."</p>
<p>"I need to go Mommy," I said a plea in my voice. "Janet was my friend."</p>
<p>Mommy sighed and said, "I know that Ariel but I'm scared."</p>
<p>"I'm a shifter Mommy," I said putting my hand on hers. "Janet wasn't and Erika and Ann aren't shifters. They couldn't turn to mist to 
escape or a bear or elephant to fight whoever this strange woman is. I can so I'm not in as much danger."</p>
<p>I could see the fear in Mommy's eyes but she tried to hide it and said, "Alright I'll let you go but I want you to be very careful. I'm still 
worried that something will happen to you too."</p>
<p>"I'll be careful Mommy," I promised and then finished my soup. After Mommy took the tray away and I laid back down my stomach a 
bit upset but I didn't feel like throwing up. As I drifted off to sleep I had to wonder why Janet and her family were killed but Erika and 
Ann just disappeared. Were they really related in some way or was it just a coincidence that a strange woman was seen in both 
circumstances?</p></p>
