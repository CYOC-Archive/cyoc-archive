<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I&#39;ll be with my friends. Joshua said. I think I&#39;ll be better with them.<br />
That&#39;s right! Nick said. There&#39;s nothing better than your friends!<br />
Randy made an annoyed face but he agree his brother&#39;s choice.<br />
Ok, you can stay with the pipsqueaks. Randy said. Just don&#39;t smother them with your rankness, hahaha!<br />
Joshua lifted his arms a little bit to smell his armpits. They hadn&#39;t bad odor, but he knew from his brother than bushy armpits make a lot of stinky sweat.<br />
Ehm... Randy... Joshua said. Can I take one of your deodorants? Just to be sure I won&#39;t be reeking all night.<br />
Randy nodded and Joshua followed him, but before he was far from his friends he said them than he&#39;ll be back soon.<br />
Joshua will be with us later. Nick said. Let&#39;s go to his room and look for some clothes to wear; it&#39;s getting darker and colder outside.<br />
Joshua&#39;s a dumb! Kenny said. I want to be with Randy and the coach. I bet they&#39;ll have way more fun than us!<br />
Why do you think that? Raul said.<br />
Because they&#39;re grown ups. They can drink beer, ride cars and use those mammoths to get whores!<br />
I think you&#39;ve been playing too much GTA... Nick sighed. And talking about it, we can play videogames, order pizza and watch a movie!<br />
Boring! Kenny said. Nothing is better than fucking! Right, Raul?<br />
Raul didn&#39;t answer. He was thinking of his mom. Where is she now? Did she managed to find a solution to this problem?<br />
The three kids arrived at Joshua&#39;s room. It wasn&#39;t as big as Randy&#39;s room but it had a big bed and a large tv on a wall. Joshua&#39;s laptop was over a small desk on a corner and a very large window gives them a direct look to the horse stable. Joshua had his clothes in a white wardrobe next to the window.<br />
Kenny opened the wardrobe and took some clothes for him, Raul and Nick. They were thin, so fit in the clothes wasn&#39;t a problem for them. Kenny wore a TMNT gray t-shirt and orange shorts. Raul took a Captain America t-shirt and blue pajama pants, and Nick wore a long sleeve white t-shirt and red pajama pants. Kenny refused to wear any underwear and, despite Raul tried to find one that fit him, he wasn&#39;t able to get it. So, Nick was the only one who was wearing underwear, white briefs.<br />
After they finished dressing, Nick turned on the TV and looked for a movie to watch. Meanwhile, Raul was looking through the window at the beautiful horses in the stable and Kenny was playing with the laptop. A few hours later, the door opened and Joshua entered. He was wearing just a wife beater and he was holding a plastic bag.<br />
Sorry I&#39;m late. Joshua said. I was looking for something to wear in Randy&#39;s room. You know he&#39;s a completely mess, so it wasn&#39;t an easy task. At the end, I just found this wife beater.<br />
We&#39;re on the same. Nick said. Fortunately you have a lot of clothes.<br />
I tried to wear boxers, speedoes and even jockstraps, but this thing refuses to fit! Joshua said. Sorry, but you&#39;ll be seeing me like this all time.<br />
Don&#39;t worry, dude. Kenny said. We aren&#39;t wearing underwear too. Well, except for Nick...<br />
Nick smiled a little bit.<br />
What do you have in that bag? Raul asked Joshua.<br />
A deodorant and some... stuff... Randy had given to me. Joshua said.<br />
What stuff? Nick asked.<br />
You know... deodorant... razors... foot powder... Joshua hesitated.<br />
Condoms, lubes, playboy maganizes... Kenny said as he was looking inside the bag.<br />
Hey! Don&#39;t look that! Joshua said as he take Kenny&#39;s face off the bag. Anyway, he insisted I take them, so I had to.<br />
Please, Joshua. Don&#39;t use them. Raul said. Remember, you&#39;re a kid like us and you&#39;ll be back to normal when my mom arrives.<br />
Joshua nodded and he threw the bag to his desk. Nick, Raul and Kenny sat on the bed to watch a movie on the TV but when Joshua tried to sit on the front he realized that he was too big that the other kids wasn&#39;t able to watch the movie. So, he went to the back of the bed where he sat crossing his legs. But his legs were too long he wans&#39;t very pleasent sat on there.<br />
When the movie finished, they began to play some videogames.<br />
Kenny tried to make a prank to Joshua hitting him with a pillow, but when Joshua responded, his pillow hit was too strong that Kenny fell on the floor.<br />
I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry! Joshua said to Kenny. I don&#39;t know how strong I am.<br />
Around the 1:00 am, they began to feel sleepy. Nick fell asleep on the left side of the bed and Raul did the same on the right. Kenny took a sleepbag that Joshua had under his desk and fell asleep in there. Joshua wasn&#39;t as sleepy as the others and the saw how they fell asleep in the room. After some minutes, the room was completely quiet.<br />
He was a little bit curious of the things his brother had given to him, so he sneaking to his desk and then he left the room. He walked into a near bathroom and closed the door. He saw the maganizes, but he didn&#39;t feel anything. He was too worried about his body that he can&#39;t think on anything else.<br />
I will pee and then I&#39;ll go to sleep. He thought. Oh, god! This thing is like a hose!<br />
He peed for a while and then he returned to his room. As he hasn&#39;t any place to sleep, he decided to sleep on the floor.</p>
