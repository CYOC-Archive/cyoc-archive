<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Leslie, what the fuck are you doing in my room? &quot; yelled Elizabeth, as she put her hands on her hips and glared at her. Jeff wiggled around her massive body, and entered the room, standing slightly in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re too late! It&#39;s already started! You can&#39;t stop it now!&quot; Leslie said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Jeff saw the computer was on, and the program running. He quickly realized what was going on. Les was trying to change something that He prayed it wasn&#39;t him or Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see about that!&quot; Jeff said as he jumped into the desk chair. He tryed to read the computer screen to see what she had done.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; screamed Les, as she brought both of her fists down on the computer as hard as she could that the computer monitor exploded in a spark and a flash, sending small shards flying in all directions. She didn&#39;t know if the computer was able to complete its task like this, but she couldn&#39;t let them try to reverse her program for This was her one and only chance at true power.<br />
<br />
Jumping back as the computer exploded that It had taken Elizabeth a little longer than Jeff, but now she knew what Leslie had been doing as it really pissed her off. The girl looked pretty beefy that Liz was not looking forward to a tussle with her, even if she had the height advantage. Still, she did invaded her home - let alone her private room - and even destroyed their property that She was now furious as she was going to take it out of Leslie&#39;s hide for She then charged towards Les.<br />
<br />
Les saw the look in Elizabeth&#39;s face, and knew she was in trouble. She was more than just pissed - she looked like a raging animal! Les did the only thing she could think of to defend herself that She quickly grabbed Jeff, still sitting dazed nearby at the smashed computer and pulled him in front of her like a shield.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay back, or the little guy here gets hurt! &quot; she said shakily while She held Jeff with one arm around his waist, pulling him closely against her body as the other arm was around his neck. He was pretty small compared to her, but she could get her hand around his entire neck that all it would take was One quick squeeze, and it would be all over for him. She was only bluffing of course as She was no killer, But she hoped that Elizabeth would believe her.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth stopped herself from charging as she didn&#39;t want any harm on her brother. Still, her gaze were still full of venom for her. She understood the implications of Leslie&#39;s hold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let my brother go! Now!&quot; she said, through her gritted teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you let me out first, then you may have him back. What do you say, do you want him?&quot; she said nervously, still gripping Jeff tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way. You aren&#39;t getting past me with him. &quot; she said while she shook her head no as she was standing to her full height, placing her hands on her hips and blocking the door. &quot;Let&#39;s take about this, but you have to let him go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leslie was starting to panic now as She knew she couldn&#39;t&#39; get past Elizabeth and out the door while holding Jeff, But if she let him go that she knew she was in for a beating. Her body felt strange, but she didn&#39;t know if it was the device or her fear. Even if she was changing, it would take 1 hour to complete that She couldn&#39;t keep Elizabeth at bay for long She looked around the room for another to escape.<br />
<br />
She did see a large window which was leading to the outside as She knew she was on the second floor, but she didn&#39;t think she had another option. She let go of Jeff&#39;s waist, then quickly grabbed the desk chair with her free arm that she then threw it out the window. Before Elizabeth could react, she jumped out the window with Jeff in her arms while cutting her shoulders on the jagged glass. She landed with a thud on the grass below as Her legs ached, yet she was afraid that she had broken her ankle.<br />
<br />
She thought dully as they shoot horses with broken legs as She stood up on her hooves, and was happy to see that at least she could bear weight on it. She dusted the grass and glass off of her body. grabbing Jeff, she limped off into the nearby woods.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth cursed that She didn&#39;t dare follow Les out the window. She knew enough about horses to know that it was a bad idea, But she had to go rescue Jeff. She ran back down the stairs and out the front door, trying to track them through the forest.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t too worried about the computer right now for she had gotten what she wanted out of it as Jeff was back to normal. Although, it might be a problem for Brittany and Cindy. She guessed that they were stuck as anthro-horses like her.<br />
<br />
She thought Maybe because Brittany was an anthro-horse that it will be popular for her. She had no idea what Leslie had been trying to do with the program, but She guessed that Leslie was trying to turn herself back to normal. Whatever she was doing, it seemed like it didn&#39;t work as Everyone in the room - Les, Elizabeth, even Jeff - they all looked the same.<br />
<br />
She thought that she must of destroyed the computer, before it could complete whatever it was she was trying to do. Thank God! The girl was really weird that God only knows what she would do with this kind of power.<br />
<br />
However, Because the computer screen was destroyed that Elizabeth had no idea what it read as it would take about 1 hour for Leslies&#39; change to complete. Ever way, this is where her transformation was only just beginning.</p>
