<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Both Caleb and Luke were very eager to head off to the beach - Caleb due to wanting to try to find some women on the beach in the hopes of &quot;broadening his experiences&quot;, and Luke due to wanting to catch some waves...and also probably to find some babes who were fans of his surfing influencer page. Caleb did feel a degree of trepidation as he and his friend headed off toward the beach. He thought about how there might be some beach bodybuilders there, and how despite being substantially more muscled than the typical nerd, he might still not stand out...though after a moment, the blond boy shrugged and figured it was just nerves.<br />
<br />
Much like he wrote off the strange tingling feeling he was feeling. Luke it seemed was twitching a little, to which the more relaxed boy responded by simply scratching his back and moving on. Caleb honestly felt a lot of admiration for Luke - as it seemed like he was by far incredibly confident in his chances. By now, Luke had taken off his Hawaiian shirt and folded it to hold between his arm and chest, and as they got closer to the beach, Caleb noted Luke was grinning broadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude,&quot; Luke pointed at the waves and some figures nearby, &quot;Check those gnarly waves! And it looks like we got some babes enjoying the sun here too! Maybe they&#39;re fans of my channel!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or maybe they&#39;re just vacationers here to enjoy a good time...&quot; Caleb suggested as he stretched. <i>Did I pull a muscle last night working out?</i> Caleb wondered as he and Luke kept walking. Though he swore as he looked at Luke it felt like there was something very slightly off with him. He couldn&#39;t precisely put his finger on it, but it was presently only just enough to trigger a feeling in Caleb something like deja vu. He shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah don&#39;t be harshing my vibe, bro,&quot; Luke punched Caleb&#39;s shoulder lightly, &quot;Besides, if you&#39;re a friend of mine, maybe any fans of mine might be interested in a little one on one time with you...&quot; Luke drew closer and whispered in Caleb&#39;s ear, &quot;A little romantic time. Maybe a lovely college gal might wanna put your dick in her---&quot;<br />
<br />
And there was Caleb&#39;s interest. The nerdy teen swimmer before long had his shirt off, tightly muscled body on full display. An eager smile on his face - most if not all uncertainty banished from him. Caleb liked to say that he wasn&#39;t much like his older brother Dylan, in that he could well control his carnal needs...but the idea of a college age lover was still a subject that Caleb viewed with some degree of anticipation - and a fetishistic desire. Thankfully, Caleb&#39;s shorts weren&#39;t so tight as to make his half-erection too obvious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude...&quot; Caleb whispered back, &quot;If any of em <i>are</i> you gotta set me up bro.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What are bros for?&quot; Luke put an arm around Caleb&#39;s shoulders, &quot;You got it. If any of the ladies are fans of mine, I&#39;ll make sure that you get a nice, hot time at the beach. Just so long as you don&#39;t mind me getting in on the action too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Long as our dicks don&#39;t touch.&quot; Caleb answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got it!&quot; Luke then hurried off when they got close enough to the beach. While he hadn&#39;t brought his own board with him presently, Luke was pleased to see there were some loaners at a rack by the beachside, near a beach chair. Swiftly borrowing one and starting to look around the beach, Luke waved at Caleb as he started surveying the beach. Clean, open, people running about having fun...it seemed like the perfect place for the two of them to enjoy themselves.<br />
<br />
So far as Caleb walked on to the beach, he felt a weird bit of muscle tightness in his back and shoulders, though a quick bit of stretching alleviated that. Not that Caleb noticed his shoulders were slightly broader, the muscles tighter, more toned and packing on a little bit more size even as he stretched - his back likewise spreading wider, lats growing in very slightly more impressively. <br />
<br />
The women on the beach indeed all appeared to be around college age, which got him very excited indeed. He had to restrain himself from outright popping a boner out here, so as to make it less obvious how eager he was to have sex on vacation. Still, as he watched Luke run around, Caleb found himself contemplating. Something about Luke, again, seemed slightly off. He just couldn&#39;t presently put it into words.<br />
<br />
What it was was that Luke - and indeed, Caleb himself - had started aging as soon as they set foot on to the beach.<br />
<br />
At the present, both were verging on nineteen years old - with Luke in particular growing more toned while Caleb&#39;s anxieties about his muscular size seemed to inform his changes as his physique broadened and strengthened. While he wouldn&#39;t quite be one of those beach bodybuilders just yet, that was the destination if not the present.<br />
<br />
Before long, as Caleb waited for some sign of success, he saw that two young women approached Luke as he went about on the beach.<br />
<br />
One of them was a blond bombshell - obviously a beach babe herself and the type Luke probably had some experience with already. Caleb, eager to appear more relaxed and &quot;cool&quot; rather than overexcited, took a seat at the beach chair, grinning. The other woman was obviously a friend of the blond, a darker haired young woman who looked less outgoing. She was probably following her friend along into vacation. Going by the body language and looks they gave him, as well as pulling out their phones, it did indeed seem they knew Luke.<br />
<br />
Though, as Luke brought them toward Caleb, he swore again that something seemed different with Luke. Maybe it was just the way the light came down on the beach. Maybe it was just how long they&#39;d all been on that fucking boat. But he swore he could tell something was off...ah well. He figured. He could think about it later - when he wasn&#39;t in the midst of possibly the opportunity to get laid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, so, you&#39;re that friend of Luke&#39;s right?&quot; The blond said as she and her friend approached, &quot;Caleb?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess my buddy told you about me. He&#39;s a pretty awesome guy, teaches me how to surf and all.&quot; Caleb answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We both like, follow Luke on all the social media, so imagine finding him here like this!&quot; The darker haired woman responded, &quot;It must be a one in a million chance!&quot; Caleb evaluated the two of them now that they were here. The blond woman seemed athletic, lean, and tight-bodied, and she was checking out Caleb very obviously. The dark haired woman seemed more thin, homelier, but still quite cute. <br />
<br />
Luke nodded, &quot;I&#39;m always down to meet my fans on the beach! You ladies want a selfie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe,&quot; the blond said, &quot;I was thinking about something else too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Claire!&quot; The dark haired woman said, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you know you wanted to go for it the moment you saw him too, Beth. And it&#39;s not like you&#39;re subtle about checking out Caleb here.&quot; Ah, so there were their names - Claire the blond athletic beach babe, and Beth, the more wallflower-ish woman who was pretty obviously brought along by her friend for vacay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Caleb said with a smile, &quot;I&#39;m not averse honestly to being checked out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beth blushed and looked at Claire, who seemed to be moving toward Luke - letting him put an arm around her - and then looked at Caleb. &quot;Well...okay,&quot; Beth stated, &quot;I...came out here to try and enjoy myself like Claire always does. And...you really are amazing looking, Caleb.&quot; A smile of victory graced Caleb&#39;s lips as he leaned back upon hearing that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I try, Beth, I try.&quot; Caleb ignored the fact his pecs seemed like they were bigger than he remembered them being, and just figured it was the sun making him look better or something. But the more this went on, the less he was just able to ignore it.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Claire said as she and Luke started getting handsy with each other, &quot;This is a sex-positive beach. I&#39;m thinking Luke and I might be feeling like getting to know each other better. Beth, you said you wanted to toss out that V-Card. Well, Caleb&#39;s right there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-Right now?&quot; Beth blushed again, looking at Caleb for some sort of assurance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if everyone&#39;s good with it,&quot; Caleb shrugged, leaning back in his beach chair, &quot;I don&#39;t see any reason to deny it. Kinda fast, but then, we&#39;re on vacation. You go on vacay to have fun. Just gotta make sure we have safe sex stuff ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no worries about THAT~!&quot; Claire announced, &quot;I made sure to bring enough of the pill here for Beth and I to enjoy our time here with you hot beach boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke just grinned and snapped his fingers as he and Claire started moving off to try and find a good place for their torrid session to begin. Meanwhile, Beth looked at Caleb, awkwardly glancing over the tightly muscled nerd and trying to think of how to deal with this. She shyly asked, &quot;Well uh, I&#39;m good to like, make out and stuff. Let&#39;s just...take it kinda slow for now...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you like, babe.&quot; Caleb figured that she could take this at her own speed. He wasn&#39;t gonna try and force her to go any faster. If she felt like doing more with him she would. He just again found himself thinking about the way Luke was looking. He just couldn&#39;t ignore how weird it was. How was he the only one, it seemed, to notice...? Ah well, maybe it&#39;d be over when they got done with...well, their present day diversion.</p>
