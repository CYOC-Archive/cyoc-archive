<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Oscar hid in the bushes he scanned the area with his new eyes, he saw a couple walking hand in hand only a few yards away down the side walk which followed the edge of the road. He could attack them and either kill or infect them, somehow, he knew that he could infect them with ease. Something within him was telling him, almost forcing him to spread the gift of what he had been given but he was still human enough to know that going after them would be foolish. He could see a police car sitting within sight of the couple and he knew even with his new strength and speed he was not strong enough to stop bullets. His cat like eyes scanned around and spotted the long line of tall oak trees with thick branches which shaded the street. They were a symbol for the university, and they were going to be very useful to him. <br />
He leapt from cover and ran to the tree jumping nearly a quarter the way up the tree. His claws extending outwards as he sank them deep into the wood. With ease he pulled himself up into the tree, the combination of the darkness and no one expecting to see a cat man meant no one saw him. He began to gracefully move down the line of trees leaping from branch to branch, sometimes on all fours sometimes standing on two. He could feel the rush of this moment, it was far stronger, far faster and far more flexible than he had ever had been as a human. He knew where he was going, he passed over more people walking around but he paid them no mind, he could infect them, but he had more base instincts driving him now. <br />
He landed in front of her door and did not mess with knocking, he entered the house, entered the same living room where only a couple of hours earlier he had come in to see her outside of class for the 1st time. The room was much the same, but he could smell her, his heart rate quickened as his ears focused on the sound. The room had little light and the curtains over the windows had been drawn tight so no one outside could see him…them. <br />
He heard her a second before he could see her, however the scent of her was already driving him crazy, something within him a knowledge which had been given to him by the transformation told him she was in heat. She appeared on the stairways like a goddess to his eyes, her reddish tan fur, those spots where perfect for her. Her long frame, was meant for speed and her breasts while not large where prefect for her new form. Her long tail, longer then his moved back and forth behind her, as she looked at him.<br />
The two eyed each other as she came ever closer, without saying a word. They circled each other like a pair of animals would do in the wild, Oscar standing still but following her with his head and his eyes. Lindsay moving around him her eyes moving up and down. He knew what she was doing, she was eyeing him because he was eyeing her, not just her frame but now what that frame could help bring to any future clubs. She seamed to lack the climbing abilities he had and she looked more fragile as well, but she looked so much faster, her speed would be a great trait to hand off to their cubs. Somehow just like before he knew even though they where different types of cat people they could mate and their cubs could share their traits.<br />
It wasn’t just all animal instincts, his human love of her still remained and her love of him only now more animal like instincts had pushed themselves more to the front but not totally to the front. She did show off a playful mood but flicking her tail up and brushing his nose with it, it was covered with her scent, her heated scent. That caused his member to stand up even more for her inspection and she liked what she saw. Finally she stopped face to face with him.<br />
“Oscar.” She purred as she rubbed her face against the side of his face like a cat. <br />
“Lindsay.” He purred back as he rubbed his face against her, while resting a hand on her fur covered hip. She responded by stepping closer to him and wrapping her arms around his neck and her tail around his hip. “What happened to us?”<br />
“I don’t know….” Said Lindsay “I shouldn’t like it, I should be freaking out but I am not.”<br />
“You are loving it, just like I am?” inquired Oscar as Lindsay nodded and came ever closer to him, her breast pushing up against him. <br />
“This is wrong, but it feels so right.” Stated Lindsay before correcting, she felt so wet so horny and his member was pressing against her. “Not you and me of course, but what we became.”<br />
“I agree…” said Oscar, the scent of Lindsay driving him crazy and she seamed to be at that point as well “What should we do?”</p>
