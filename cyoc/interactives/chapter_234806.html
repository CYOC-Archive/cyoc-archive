<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Charlie and Brady entered the room. “Well, here we are! My toys are over there, my computer’s right there, and—ooh! There!” Brady ran to the chest of things on the side where his closet was, digging through it. “This is where my sports gear is!” He said cheerfully. Charlie looked around the room. Nothing too out of the ordinary, it was pretty whatever. A room covered in posters and other fandom related things, half of it sports and half of it about things a kid Brady’s age might like.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, it’s pretty cool, little dude. You ready now?” Looking back to Brady, Charlie felt like something was off. What he failed to hear over the rustling of Brady’s stuff was the sound of growing bones. It was hard to notice, but Brady was now ever so slightly taller than a second ago. The kid turned back to him smiling. “Yeah! Let’s go to the backyard!” He went quickly ahead and Charlie followed him down the hall and down the stairs.<br />
<br />
As they walked down, though, Charlie could now hear the faint sounds of stretching and growing. The lengthening of Brady’s limbs made him lose his balance for a second as he got to the bottom, wobbling a bit before falling back into Charlie’s arms. “Woah! Ugh!” Catching him, the teen didn’t feel anything different. But holding him was making him feel…comfortably warm inside. The same was going for Brady, who looked back up to him staring. “…Uhh…thanks.” He said. “Uhh, yeah, whatever, kid.” Charlie replied. “Just be more careful, alright?” He righted him and had them continue to the back door, having him put his socks and shoes on to go and play.<br />
<br />
It was a pretty warm sunny day out. The perfect weather for an outdoor activity. And yet, despite the calm air, something just felt off. Charlie decided to ignore it, though, and continued on into the yard. “Alright, you get over on that end, I’ll be on the opposite. We can toss it to each other for a bit.” He said. “Okay! Let’s do it!” Brady nodded, and the two began their little game of catch. At first, Brady’s arm was tossing it without much power, probably due to how young he was. But eventually, his throwing got better. <br />
<br />
One might think it was because he was learning, but Charlie wasn’t much of a sports guy. No, the reason is because Brady’s arms were getting stronger. His body was growing ever so steadily as they played, his limbs getting longer, his muscles getting bigger. Eventually, the little eight year old had hit double digits and started moving past ten to eleven years old, his body now having shown significant progress. As they moved, Charlie could vaguely notice small details about Brady, like the fact he could start seeing his knees below his shorts, and his t-shirt looked less baggy on him, a little of his waist showing when he jumped up to catch the ball. Overall, the boy seemed just a bit…thicker somehow. <br />
<br />
Charlie stopped after he threw the ball back to him. “…Umm…hey, Brady?” Catching it almost perfectly in his somewhat larger hands, Brady tilted his head curiously. “What’s up, bud?” The kid felt heated in his face when he blurted that out. They weren’t friends, right? Well, they were, but they weren’t THAT close, were they? As far as Brady recalled, he met Charlie during one of his school events, and really took a liking to him. He asked his parents if the teen could be his babysitter, and they agreed. He didn’t feel like he needed someone to care for him, he felt he was mature enough to fend for himself now as an eleven, almost twelve year old middle schooler just starting to grow into manhood. But if he HAD to be looked after, he was glad it was Charlie. He liked him a lot. In fact, he looked up to him.<br />
<br />
Charlie just brushed it off. “Nothing. Just uhm…checking in on you. You ok?” Brady seemed confused. “Yeah, why? I don’t feel weird.” Though, that wasn’t entirely true. He WAS starting to feel odd, but not in the way Charlie thinks. His clothes felt a little snug on him now, his body continuing to steadily grow as he stood there, hitting his twelfth birthday. Where once his shoes were fine, they now felt like they had a lot less room in them as his feet grew bigger, his toes curling as they were beginning to touch the end of the shoe. The waist of his shorts were shrinking around him, and the upper part of his shirt started giving a very gentle hug to his chest, which had very slight definition. “Mmmgh…except maybe my clothes. But I could still wear them.” Brady said, trying to stretch out his body to feel a little more comfortable. <br />
<br />
Hearing his voice, it sounded a little…different to both of them. It was a little lower. Still high pitched, just more rich and loud like that of an older kid. His face began to get a little longer too, less round. Charlie’s eyes narrowed a bit quizzically. Something was wrong…but why couldn’t he figure it out? Brady was always this big, right? He was twelve, of course he’d be big. In fact, he came up to his chin. But something told him he shouldn’t be. Still…he was a cute kid. He&#39;s starting to look almost…handsome too. Charlie shook his head. Where the hell did THAT thought come from?<br />
<br />
Coming back to his senses, he continued. “If you say so, little dude. But maybe later, I should take you clothes shopping, shouldn’t I?” Charlie smiled, the kid returning the expression. “Heheh, you’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Brady joked, but then he stopped smiling. Why did he say that? Charlie just chuckled awkwardly. “Yeah, totally, man. Would you?” The preteen boy just gave a little sheepish smile. “Y…Yeah…I would like that.” Brady felt anxious now. He would usually think nothing of the idea of a shopping trip. But…he felt that now, he saw it as a way to spend time with Charlie, and he really wanted that for some reason.<br />
<br />
Getting back to the game, Brady bent over, getting in position. He gripped the football tightly in his hands. “Okay, it’s the finish line. I’m gonna try and run past you now for a touchdown. You try and block me.” As he stood there, he could feel his butt taking up more room in his shorts, his thighs doing the same. They were thickening with muscle, starting to give his waist more of a shape apart from his upper body. The very beginnings of a manly adult figure.<br />
<br />
“Alright. Come at me.” Charlie smirked. With how much bigger he was than him, there’s no way the kid’s getting past him. Watching Brady pull back as if he knew professional posture was odd, though. How did he know what to do? He’s only in middle school…right? But something started telling him otherwise. Before he could think about it further, Brady yelled “Hike!” In a surprisingly powerful way before charging forward.<br />
<br />
Brady knew his goal was to get past him…but he didn’t want to try. The kid purposely ran straight into Charlie, slamming into the teen and knocking him over playfully. The ball fell out of his hands as they tumbled back onto the grass, Brady on top of him. “Hrk! Ungh…” Charlie grunted. “Damn, little dude…did you get heavier?” The boy could feel Brady’s body weight laying on top of him. It was definitely much heavier than when he met him a while ago. Brady looked up at him wide eyed and smiling. “What are you talking about, bro? I’ve ALways been this biG!” His voice cracked as he spoke.<br />
<br />
Charlie just gave a small scoffing sound. That’s right. At least…it feels right. After all, Brady’s thirteen years old now, and at the end of middle school. He’s gonna be trying out for junior varsity when he gets into highschool, so he has to build up his strength. These thoughts had started manifesting as Brady continued to grow bigger and older on top of him. Grunting and breathing deeply, the boy hit puberty as he grew across Charlie’s body, the now thirteen year old getting heavier and heavier by the minute. <br />
<br />
With his arms wrapped around him, Charlie could feel Brady’s back broadening, his limbs thickening with the beginnings of athletic muscle. Gains from workouts he had just started doing, but in reality, had never actually done. Small biceps began to form, Brady’s chest pushing against Charlie’s as it grew into a little pair of pectoral muscles. They were very small, yet were pretty visible for his age, and sat above a lean stomach that was feeling a little meatier, more firm. He still had quite a bit of baby fat, which he could still see on his face, but said face had begun to sharpen with the angles of manhood. <br />
<br />
“Uhhnngh…” Brady’s grunting had started shifting into moaning, his voice sounding a bit deeper as his neck thickened and lengthened, an Adam’s Apple becoming visible while he started feeling a tingle down between his lengthening legs. Now that puberty had begun, his balls had dropped, creating the chemicals needed for his sexual development as they grew bigger. His boyhood had started growing bigger and thicker beneath his tightening briefs, creating a bulging package that throbbed and pushed against Charlie’s waist as Brady felt himself harden for the first time in his life.<br />
<br />
From running around in the sun so much, Brady’s body was sweating, but now that he’s in adolescence, he began to sweat in more places than just his head. The area under his arms started growing damp as some hairs had started growing out from them, his shirt getting drenched in sweat, and so were his shorts as his legs were secreting a layer of their own. His feet felt hot inside his ill-fitting shoes, the footwear starting to bulge and stretch as his feet grew too big for them. A light, musky scent had begun to emanate from Brady’s entire body that would only get more potent as he matured.<br />
<br />
Charlie should be highly concerned. He should be very turned off by the smell. And yet…he didn’t mind it. In fact, he kind of liked it. As he watched his young charge getting bigger, he ended up  feeling a little of Brady’s exposed waist due to his shirt finally riding up to the point it can’t fully come down to reach his shorts. It revealed the beginnings of a v-shaped waist, which gently laid against him as they laid there together comfortably. Now closer to his face, the two of them stared at each other, wondering why a redness was starting to form beneath their cheeks. Brady…really wanted to move in closer to his face, but couldn’t quite get himself to do it just yet. Something was nagging at him, but he didn’t know why he was feeling this way in the first place.<br />
<br />
Little did they know that the bear in the living room had been making up memories for them as it went along, fitting them into Brady’s development so that he grows up to become not just someone who could care for Charlie, but someone he can love. Someone who fits his true desires. And it was far from finished…<br />
<br />
As the two continued their staring contest, Brady suddenly snapped out of it. “…O-Oh, I’m so sorry, bud! Are you okay? Here, let me help you up, bro.” Hearing his voice, he now sounded like a young jock just about to start his freshman year. Still high, but significantly lower from where it started with a bit of weight to it due to him bellowing out his words like a dudebro. Bending his longer limbs, he lifted himself off of Charlie, grabbing his hand to help pull him back to his feet. Getting up fully, Charlie now noticed the kid, who had just officially become a young man in his early teens, was almost his height now. It would appear he had hit a growth spurt, and knowing how old he was, he was still in the midst of it.<br />
<br />
“Let me take a look at you…” Brady carefully looked and felt all around Charlie, being unusually attentive and caring for someone he just met. But his mind had told him he was always this protective. He looked out for Charlie just like he did for him, even though he was a few years younger than him. They met when he was on a class tour of the highschool Charlie went to, and from there they seemed to hit it off very well. From then on, they became pretty close friends. Charlie laughed. “I’m fine, man. What are you, my dad?” Brady just gave a warm smile when he was done checking him. “I don’t have to be to care about you.” Though, the idea of being like his dad didn’t sound that bad to him. He knew Charlie didn’t have one. So if he could be like that to him, he’d be happy to. The boy patted him on the back with surprising strength, the teen feeling Brady’s larger hands have a bit more oomph to them. “Yeah, you’re okay. We should take a break for a bit.” Brady turned to start walking back to the house. “So, what do you wanna do next? I’ll let you decide now, bud.”<br />
<br />
Charlie had to think for a moment. His mind was all over the place, and right now, he couldn’t take his eyes off of Brady, the short haired blonde teen casually walking around in clothes a few sizes too small. His growing body was starting to distract him. He stared at Brady’s exposed skin, noticing blonde hairs covering his forearms and calves. Said hairs were starting to rise up to his thighs, a little bit of pubic hair starting to stick out of his shorts. What was even more evident was Brady’s cock, which was still hard and bulging from the front of his shorts. There was no doubt about it, Brady was officially a teenager now. Testosterone was starting to rush through his body, beginning to change him into a man…and Charlie was finding it harder to resist him. He needed a nap for sure. But…a part of him wanted to do more than just rest. He wanted to…snuggle up with Brady. The brown haired teen just rubbed his temples, trying to look nonchalant, but in reality, he was really trying to shake these feelings off. What was going on?<br />
<br />
Brady shifted in his clothes as he stood there. It wasn’t uncomfortable, but it was certainly snug. With the way it hugged him, it felt kind of…stimulating. “Oh, and when we get back in, I’m gonna take my shoes off. My feet are killing me in these things…ungh, I should tell my mom to buy me new ones when she gets home.” He said kind of exaggerating his current state. Charlie replied, “Hahah, no kidding. Why the hell are you even wearing that shit, man?” Brady shrugged. “Fuck if I know, bro. These things look like they’re made for a kid.” The older teen gave him a raised eyebrow, not realizing Brady had just dropped an f-bomb for the first time. His vocabulary was certainly maturing. He wasn’t speaking like a kid anymore. “…W-Well, a kid younger than me, anyway.” Brady responded sheepishly, making Charlie chuckle. The kid really wanted to be taken seriously, but he&#39;ll always be a cute little scamp to him. Though, it seems like that perception of him might vanish eventually, unbeknownst to either of them. With that, the resident babysitter thought about their next activity. “Hmm…let’s see…”</p>
