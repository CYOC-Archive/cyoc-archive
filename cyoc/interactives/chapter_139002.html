<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A bark-like laughter erupting from her, April could handle with what she was seeing. Feeling like she was cracking up, she yipped, &quot;Not possible. No way. No way. Now way,&quot; and grasping the penis, she tried pulling on it, but only managed to bring tears of pain to her eyes. Reaching a hand down between her legs, she searched furiously for the familiar genitals she knew she should have and believed she did still have. Finding nothing but flat skin that also felt a little hairy, she uttered another bark-like laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not seeing this. I don&#39;t deserve this. It&#39;s not possible,&quot; April yipped silently and her mind flashing from scenario to scenario, she tried to come up with a way to reverse what was happening.<br />
<br />
An idea coming to her, she found herself loath to try it, but seeing no alternative, she marched to over to the vanity sink and began searching the cabinet behind the mirror and the space beneath the sink. Finding a bottle of lotion, she set it on the porcelain surface and glared at it. Hating the idea of what she was about to do, but needing confirmation, she took a deep breath, reached out one hand, cupped it beneath the nozzle and with her other hand, pressed a dollop of lotion out. <br />
<br />
Slowly lower her cupped hand, unsure what she was doing, but needed some proof, she slapped it against the organ and after a moment of trying to figure out what to do, she curled her hand around the member and began sliding the appendage back and forth. Growing erect as she stimulated it, April yipped and moaned as she shuddered in horror at how good what she was doing felt. Moving slowly over to the shower, wanting it ready for the next part of her plan, she flipped it on and pulled the curtain partially closed. Feeling more and more aroused, she guessed it wouldn&#39;t be long before she blew and yipping some more, she waited a bit long before stepping into the shower.<br />
<br />
Moments after she&#39;d done so, her penis let forth a stream that she tried to keep from spraying the wall by cupping her other hand in from of the organ. Gazing at the sticky fluid covering the palm and some of her fingers, thinking it looked almost like the vaginal discharges she had every so often, she glanced down and groaned as she watched her penis retract into a sheath. Unsure when it had formed, she also noted that her pubic hair appeared white, with a red tingle along the very edge. Thinking that it must be sexual feelings and masturbation that worsened the curse, for she saw no other way to describe what was happening, April resolved not to touch the wretched thing or even think about anything might make it erect. Turning to the spray of water, she stepped under it and closed her eyes at the feeling of the warm water and letting it wash over her, she tried to think of a way to outwit the curse completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe even make it take back the horrible thing that has been forced upon me,&quot; she thought as raised her head so that her face was directly in the path of the incoming water.<br />
<br />
An idea coming to her, she wondered, briefly, if maybe she could scrub the penis and testicles off her body. But quickly talking herself out doing so, as she figured it would be touching them, she reached for a body wash and, oblivious to how she was feeling, she took a dollop of it and began to rub it against her breasts, liking the sensual sensation it created. Uttering a serious of excited yip and barks, she started to press on her breasts, running her hands over the flesh and after a bit, play with the erect nipples. Losing herself more and more, April remained unconcerned with what she was doing, the warm water only spiking the plethora of emotions she was succumbing to, as she tried to work out ways to stop what was.<br />
<br />
Suddenly realising that, at some point, her penis had once again become hard, April felt her mind snap back to the here and now and trying to force herself to stop, she grew alarmed when she felt her breasts growing smaller and smaller beneath her hands as they regressed back through the four years of grow they&#39;d undergone since she began puberty. Within moments, she found herself touching flat skin and wanting to weep, she instead furiously cranked the handle that regulated the water temperature to cold and sank to the floor of the tub.<br />
<br />
The cold water washing over her, sobering her up, April began to cry as she hugged her knees to her now flat chest. Thoughts of how unfair it was that this was happening and that she looked like a girl, April shifted until she was lying down in the tub. Nearly curled up into a fetal position, still crying, she nearly screamed out, &quot;What did I do to deserve this,&quot; as she became aware that it wasn&#39;t just her chest that changed, but that she now had hair, red and white, growing up her abdomen, down between her legs and around toward her butt. A feeling of hopelessness washing over her, she wanted to talk to someone, but she found herself questioning who, as, for all she knew, nobody had ever been cursed to become the opposite sex like she had.<br />
<br />
Unsure how long she&#39;d been lying there, April eventually reached over and shut off the flowing water, but didn&#39;t climb out of the tub. Instead, she lay in the bottom for a bit longer, still trying to think of ways to outwit the curse. She reasoned that she could never take a warm shower again and that touching any part of her body that was sensitive would likely trigger feelings of being horny, which left her dreading what would happen if she ever needed to pee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially since I don&#39;t know the first thing about doing so as a boy would,&quot; she barked out and standing, she climbed over the edge of the tub, thinking as she did that it for some reason seemed bigger.<br />
<br />
Perplexed by this, April grabbed a towel and quickly dried herself off, being careful about where she touched the soft terry-cloth as she did so. Afterward, she clicked off the light and stepped out of the bathroom, but froze the instant she stepped out into the hallway. Alert, smelling a human nearby, she snapped her head in the direction the scent was the strongest and wary, she crept toward her bedroom. Inside, she tossed the towel into her laundry basket and not even giving it a second thought that she hadn&#39;t bothered to turn on the light, but could see just fine, April took a spaghetti strap dress from her closet and pulled it over head.<br />
<br />
When the garment nearly slipped off her, and the straps refused to stay put on her shoulders, April barked in alarm and peered down at herself. Thinking she must had somehow shrunk, she yipped, &quot;How is that possible,&quot; and wanting to be sure, she tried to remember where her mother get the cloth ruler for taking body measurements. Recalling it was downstairs in a drawer in the kitchen, April huffed and still fighting to keep the dress on, she slunk back across the room and out.<br />
<br />
Back in the hall, she crept warily past the source of the human scent, thinking for some reason it smelled female and finding it odd the smell was coming from her brother&#39;s room. Not wanting to deal with it at the moment, she yipped, &quot;One problem at a time,&quot; before starting to creep down the stairs, ignorant that her ears had moved up to the top of her head, had become pointed and where helping her hear better.<br />
<br />
In the kitchen, she stopped and sniffed the air. The scent of humans starting to really bother her, April tried to calm the skittish feeling that was threatening to overwhelm her. Confused as to why she was feeling so, the sixteen-year-old started toward the odds-an-ends drawer, but changed direction at the last minute and instead headed for the fridge. Pulling open the door, the sudden light making her squint and back away, April quickly looked about the kitchen, adjusted the dress so it didn&#39;t slip off her shrinking frame, scratched and sniffed the air. Suddenly feeling scared to the point that her bladder might loose, April turned and dashed across the kitchen. Whipping the backdoor open, she stepped out on the back stoop and began taking great, gulping deep breaths.<br />
<br />
The cool air having a calming sensation on her, she suddenly questioned why she was wearing any clothes. Letting the dress slip off her, she took another deep breath and enjoying the air against her body, which was slowly becoming furrier, she whispered, &quot;Get control. Figure out a way to stop this. There is nothing that stop you,&quot; and glancing back into the house, she knew she had to go back, but was leary to do so.<br />
<br />
After a bit, she told herself, &quot;Only as long as it takes to find the tape measure,&quot; and satisfied with this train of thought, forgetting why she needed the clothe ruler, April slunk back into the house. Stopping in front of the fridge, smelling the tantalising aroma of meat, she began to salivate. Cautiously approaching the open door, scared of the light, she darted a hand in. When nothing happened, she relaxed slightly and after a moment, pulled some raw chicken off of a plate. Needing no second thought to what she was about to do, April buried her face in the raw meat and started chewing furiously. After a couple bites, she dropped it to the floor, pulled a couple more pieces out and onto the floor and dropping to all fours, her spine, hips and shoulders realigning themselves to a more quadruped form as she did so, April sniffed, yipped and began feasting on the raw chicken.</p>
