<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The audible gurgling from Jeff&#39;s stomach at the mention of breakfast by Grace was enough give enough of an indication of what would be the next matter of conversation. Granted the situation wasn&#39;t one that would normally leave breakfast as the most important thing, given that Lucy and Zoe had just transformed into Slug Women and Megan and Jenny were still bound and determined to try and get the entire Chapman family under their control, but no one had eaten since dinner the previous night and even Jeff figured that certain aspects of his mother&#39;s, then Grace&#39;s, and now finally Lucy and Zoe&#39;s transformations had to had enough of an energy drain that breakfast would be necessary. He blushed a bit when his siblings turned their eye stalks to him at the gurgling of his stomach, but their stomachs soon gurgled, almost as if in answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think it best if we focus on breakfast first,&quot; Jeff said weakly, &quot;figuring a way out or at least getting Megan and Jenny to leave the house... if not finding a way to defeat their master would be best done when we&#39;re not all hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few nods from the others, though Jeff also assumed there was some confusion as his sisters looked to each other and then to their mother. At present he couldn&#39;t tap into the sort of hivemind that connected all Slug People, though Grace had said that wasn&#39;t exactly telepathy, but he did get the sense on that there was concern over what would have to be done regarding their food situation. As while breakfast was big, there was still the fact that they were trapped in the master bedroom by Megan and Jenny and thus far had found no way to get out of the room that wouldn&#39;t go by Megan and Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not just breakfast,&quot; Lucy said slowly, &quot;as we&#39;re still going to have one heck of a puzzle on figuring out how to get out of here... or beat this master of Megan and Jenny&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting out and getting help might be the only thing we can do with this master,&quot; Grace said slowly, remembering seeing a figure in the backyard when she first got up, &quot;but we&#39;d need to eat something before trying to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That part should be easy,&quot; Whitney commented, &quot;the room here has windows and not only should we be able to open them, but it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to go down the outside walls before getting help. We could even carry Jeff if we have to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... that&#39;d only work if we could open the windows,&quot; Zoe commented, &quot;we found we couldn&#39;t open them and jump out last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would have broken your legs!&quot; Whitney gasped and grabbed Zoe and Lucy into a firm and very motherly hug with images flashing in her mind of her children injured.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all a part of this master&#39;s magic,&quot; Lucy said as she got the sense that her mother was worried and hugged her back, just to assure Whitney that she was fine. &quot;He had to have made it that we couldn&#39;t get out once we were trapped here and Megan and Jenny have known that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thus why they&#39;ve played to it,&quot; Jeff nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why we&#39;ll need to get more than just breakfast,&quot; Lucy commented as Whitney released her and Zoe while rubbing her own stomach, as if to try and stifle its own grumblings for food.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d think we&#39;d be here through lunch or dinner?&quot; Whitney asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Potentially,&quot; Lucy nodded, &quot;particularly with Megan and Jenny staying here in order to try and get at Jeff... not to mention that trying to figure out how to beat this master or at least getting Megan and Jenny OUT of OUR home will probably take time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... we&#39;d be getting things like cereal and anything that wouldn&#39;t need to be refrigerated,&quot; Grace surmised as she looked to her eldest sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which we can then store while we&#39;re up here and then plan out what to do next,&quot; Lucy nodded.<br />
<br />
Jeff quietly listened to this and began to rub his chin as he tried to think over things. It wasn&#39;t a bad suggestion on Lucy&#39;s part as he knew they were presently trapped and so far as he knew they couldn&#39;t get out of the bedroom in a way that wouldn&#39;t take them past Megan and Jenny. Thus they&#39;d be facing either starving to death without food or having to send someone out to get food and risking a conflict with Megan and Jenny in a way that the door to the bedroom wouldn&#39;t be the barrier that it had been so far when the other two had come to it for their taunts over Grace&#39;s transformation and then Lucy and Zoe&#39;s. At the same time, he had no way of knowing haw to get out, and while some of his experience with video games and things like that had all sorts of theoretical strategies that dealt with those sorts of situations, Jeff also knew that none of them were presently viable. Which meant someone would have to go out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;The real question, I&#39;d suppose would be on who goes out to get breakfast and any food that we may need,&quot; Jeff then stated.<br />
<br />
All eyes then turned to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t be you,&quot; Lucy said firmly and in a protective voice, &quot;you&#39;re the one they want to transform and take from us. The rest of us are already Slug Women, one of us will go. The rest will protect you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan and Jenny might want you as well,&quot; Jeff pointed out, &quot;remember that Slug Women are hermaphrodites. Only the rare males have only one gender. They may want to have sex with you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but we&#39;re also already Slug Women,&quot; Zoe pointed out, &quot;what more can they do? We&#39;re free of their direct control and the worst we&#39;d get out of it would be a few orgasms. They can&#39;t enslave us and they wouldn&#39;t be able to physically dominate us to the point of taking us to this master of theirs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if he comes here?&quot; Jeff countered which got Grace to blink and her mind flashing to the figure she&#39;d seen when she first got up. She didn&#39;t recognize the man, but she&#39;d known the man wasn&#39;t one that lived in the area and seemed to also be trying to avoid observation, and likely didn&#39;t expect anyone to be near the north master bedroom window. That was enough to alert the others to Grace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grace?&quot; Whitney asked, feeling sudden feelings of nervousness wash over her youngest daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff has a point there...&quot; Grace said slowly, &quot;we may be able to resist Megan and Jenny&#39;s control... but their master is likely someone different. And with as hazy as Megan and Jenny&#39;s minds seem to be at times, it&#39;s quite possible that he enslaved them first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we know that already,&quot; Zoe countered, &quot;what&#39;s this about him coming here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... when I got up, I looked out the window,&quot; Grace spoke and pointed to the window, which her sisters and mother turned one eye to while keeping the other eye focused on Grace, &quot;and I saw... or at least thought I saw someone moving about in the backyard. He didn&#39;t look like one of our other neighbors. He looked like he was trying to avoid being seen... It left me thinking that that guy might be Megan and Jenny&#39;s master. He may not have come in the house, but he does seem to be in the area.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got a few blinks from the others and Grace could feel some nervousness rise from the others as well, particularly as they knew that while they could resist Megan and Jenny, this master might be a different issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d wish we had actual telepathy now,&quot; Lucy sighed, &quot;then we might know how this guy enslaved Megan and Jenny. As other than a haze in their minds around him... and where they seemed to lose their sense of triumph at Zoe and I transforming... it&#39;s likely that he enslaved them before they came here to transform us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe they were alone,&quot; Jeff mused, &quot;they weren&#39;t close to other Slug People and this master had some spell that overpowered them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think the Hive Mind would protect us?&quot; Lucy wondered, sounding a bit more optimistic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I can&#39;t say anything on it with experience, since I haven&#39;t transformed, yet,&quot; Jeff answered, &quot;but from what I&#39;ve been able to observe, it would seem like it can be something that would reinforce Slug People when together. You confronted Megan and Jenny through the door, they got one barb in at you... but when Zoe and Grace came to back you up, you more than got your confidence back. Maybe that&#39;s a part of how it would all work in dealing with this master&#39;s magic. Being together. He could overpower one or two minds or minds that willingly opened themselves to him, but not a group that was already united against him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes sense,&quot; Grace commented, &quot;we can sense each other&#39;s feelings and get some sense on what we&#39;re doing without saying anything. Thus how we can sense on what Megan and Jenny are doing or intending... thus we can reinforce each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it&#39;d be best that we all go together,&quot; Whitney said slowly, &quot;we&#39;ll reinforce each other and Jeff can remain safe in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if Megan or Jenny then come around through the windows?&quot; Jeff wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you could escape and join us downstairs,&quot; Lucy answered, &quot;from there, getting away should be easy... hopefully. Otherwise, you&#39;d be safe here and we&#39;ll let you know it&#39;s us when we return with breakfast.&quot;</p>
