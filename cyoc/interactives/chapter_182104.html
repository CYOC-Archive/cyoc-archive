<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Jake hung up he can&#39;t help but smile, „so, Emma has a look-a-like cousin, hm,“ he asks himself. The 16-year-old boy with short blond hair, blue eyes and an athletic body grabs his jacket and phone, on which he has the app version of the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
“I just hope Emma has never told her cousin about me,” he says, “I am not a psycho, I just want to finally get the girl I want. Emma is the hottest girl in the universe, she has the body and looks of a princess from the orient, if I can&#39;t have “Emma”... well... I&#39;ll just take her cousin.” Jake looks at his phone, “I actually wanted to use the Chronivac on Emma, but THIS is even better! If I cant have the real thing, I&#39;ll just take the next best,” the boy grins as he walks to his car.<br />
<br />
When Jake arrives at the mall he parks his car as close as possible to the main entrance, he grabs his phone and heads into the mall. Standing in the lobby of the mall, the teen dials Susan&#39;s number.<br />
<br />
“Hello?”<br />
<br />
“Hey Susan, it&#39;s Jake,” he says, “I have arrived at the mall, I am standing in the lobby. Where are you guys at?”<br />
<br />
“We are at the “Good Orient” store, looking at dresses,” Susan replies.<br />
<br />
Jake knows exactly which store Susan refers to, he has walked past that store many times, pressing his face against the glass. The boy finds all the dresses sexy, they look like dresses made for an princess of the orient. “I know that store,” he says, “I always wanted to see Emma in one of those dresses.”<br />
<br />
“Well, you might get lucky,” Susan says, “once you are in the store, make yourself known to me and I&#39;ll grab Emma and Betty and lead them away.”<br />
<br />
“Let&#39;s do this,” Jake says and ends the call, heading straight for the store. The boy soon arrives at the store and enters it, he looks around and spots the four girls, smiling he starts to walk nearer, making sure to stay out of sight until he is behind a pillar, close enough to hear the girl&#39;s talk.<br />
<br />
“This dress would look so good on you, Amber,” Emma is saying.<br />
<br />
“Emma, I don&#39;t want anything sexy,” “Amber” says, “Susan is right, for a girl like me, who is not interested in an relationship, these dresses are not suitable.”<br />
<br />
Susan nods, “true, but it would not hurt to at least try some on,” she says, “you can&#39;t and would not like to stay single your whole life.”<br />
<br />
Jake carefully pokes his head from around the pillar, Susan notices him and smiles, winking at him.<br />
<br />
“I... I don&#39;t know,” “Amber” saying, “it is intriguing though.”<br />
<br />
“Come on Amber,” Emma says, “remember your promise: being my dress-up-doll so that I can see if a dress like these suit me.”<br />
<br />
Amber sighs, “fine, but just one,” she says.<br />
<br />
Emma&#39;s eyes sparkle, “yay, here try this one on,” she says, handing “Amber” a blue dress with golden floral design and long sleeves which reaches Amber&#39;s ankles.<br />
<br />
Amber takes the dress, “you&#39;d look like a princess of the orient in this,” she says.<br />
<br />
Emma rolls her eyes, “stop whining and just put it on already,” she says.<br />
<br />
“Fine,” Amber replies and heads to the changing rooms, while the girls wait for her to return.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later Amber returns wearing the dress, “damn... this thing is tight,” she says, “so, how do I look?”<br />
<br />
Emma, Susan and Betty widen their eyes in awe, “you look amazing, girl,” Susan says.<br />
<br />
“Woah,” Emma says, “you look stunning... I mean: “I” look stunning,” she adds with a chuckle, Amber rolls her eyes.<br />
<br />
“You defiantly have the body of a princess,” Betty says.<br />
<br />
Amber blushes at the comments, “well... thanks.... I guess,” she mumbles.<br />
<br />
“Why don&#39;t you buy that dress, Amber,” Susan asks, “at least you&#39;d have one for when you think you are ready?”<br />
<br />
“Are you kidding,” Amber asks, “haven&#39;t you seen the price tag on this thing?!”<br />
<br />
“Oh come on,” Susan says, “I bet you can afford an 100 $ dress.”<br />
<br />
“I could, but I had other plans what to do with that amount,” Amber says.<br />
<br />
Susan sighs, “okay, just think about it and why not check out some of the other dresses,” she suggests, she then turns to Emma and Betty, “come on you two, let&#39;s leave Amber alone for a while so that she can decide in peace.” Emma is about to say something, but Susan has already hooked her arm around Emma&#39;s and Betty&#39;s, starting to lead them away.<br />
<br />
Once Emma, Susan and Betty have disappeared, Jake steps out from behind the pillar, he quickly scans Amber and pulls up her stats:<br />
<br />
Name: Amber “Jeff” Williams<br />
Age: 16<br />
Breast size: C<br />
Body: normal<br />
Sexual orientation: straight<br />
Relationship status: single<br />
Virgin: yes<br />
<br />
Jake raises an eyebrow at “Amber&#39;s” middle name, “hu? How come she has a boy&#39;s name as a middle name,” he asks himself, but then simply shrugs it off and decides to approach her. “Um... excuse me, miss,” he says, “you look familiar.”<br />
<br />
“Amber” turns around to see a 16-year-old boy, who by all means looks pretty handsome, standing behind her, “oh? I don&#39;t think we ever met,” she says. This is true, Jeff and Jake never met and Emma never spoke to Jeff about him.<br />
<br />
“You kind of look like my crush “Emma”,” Jake says, &#39;good, Emma seems never to have mentioned me. This is my chance to get what I want, but I got to play it wisely, not that she thinks I am a creep,&#39; he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
This makes Jeff/”Amber” feel uneasy, “I... I get that a lot,” she says, “I am “Amber” her cousin, we don&#39;t know why we look so alike.”<br />
<br />
Jake nods, “well, who cares,” he asks, smiling kindly, “you are a very attractive young lady and that dress suits you well.”<br />
<br />
“Amber” finds herself blushing again, “th-thanks... b-but if you think I am interested, I have to disapoint you,” she says, “I am not interested in starting something, yet.”<br />
<br />
Jake nods, “I understand,” he says, “but we could at least get to know each other and see what develops.”<br />
<br />
Jeff thinks for a while, &#39;it isn&#39;t that “Amber” will be around for for ever,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;and I am not planning on ever becoming Amber again after this day is over.&#39; Amber looks at Jake, “sure, you seem like a kind guy,” she says.<br />
<br />
Jake jumped inwardly in triumph, &#39;phase one: success,&#39; he thinks to himself. “Would you like to hang out with me,” he then asks.<br />
<br />
“I dunno,” Amber says, “I am here with some friends,” she turns around and is shocked to see that Emma, Betty and Susan have disappeared. The “girl” feels anger raising in her, “why did they leave me,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Jake lies a hand on her shoulder, Jeff instinctively wanted to jump away, but managed to fight the urge. “Amber” turns to face Jake, “maybe they just headed along to the next shop,” he says.<br />
<br />
“You might be right,” Amber says.<br />
<br />
“Hey, we could head to my place,” Jake says, “you can text your cousin that you&#39;ll meet her back home.”<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;d rather not go with him,&#39; Jeff thinks to himself, &#39;but it is better than searching for those girls, they might have even forgotten about me anyway.&#39; Amber looks at Jake, “sure, but I got to change into my normal clothes.”<br />
<br />
“Amber” is about to head back into the changing room, when she feels a hand on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Keep the dress on,” Jake says, “it really looks great on you.”<br />
<br />
“I can&#39;t afford it,” Amber says.<br />
<br />
“Let me pay it,” Jake says, “I&#39;d really love to do you a favor.”<br />
<br />
Jeff is about to decline, but he gets the feeling that Jake is a guy who won&#39;t take a “no” for an answer. “Amber” thinks what to do, then she smiles, “that really would be sweet of you,” she says.<br />
<br />
Jake almost melts in her smile, “th-then come, let&#39;s get out of here,” he says, so they head to the cashier and Jake pays for the dress. &#39;That was to easy,&#39; he thinks to himself, &#39;I did not even have to use my app. But at least I have her stats, who knows, I might still need it.&#39;</p>
