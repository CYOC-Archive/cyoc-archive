<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake, heart thumping with the exhilaration of the unknown, sat back in his creaking dorm room chair, his fingers hovering tentatively over the &#39;OK&#39; button. With a wry smile plastered on his face, he clicked the mouse, finalizing the entry marked &#39;Printer&#39;. He had images of Mike bustling around a printing press, laughing heartily at what he imagined was a comical but mundane alteration.<br />
<br />
The room was silent but for the soft hum of the laptop and the distant laughter from the hallway. Then suddenly, there was a mechanical whirl, a sound so out-of-place that it sent a jolt up Jake’s spine. He whirled around, finding Mike in the midst of transformation.<br />
<br />
Where his roommate once stood now was a diminutive figure encased in sleek armor reminiscent of ancient samurai, albeit with distinctly robotic finesse. Mike, in his new form, stood at around 98 cm tall. His armor was a matte blend of navy and steel blue, hugging his form like a second skin. Each plate melded with the next with such precision that it was almost impossible to tell where one began and the other ended.<br />
<br />
Two feline ears poked out from the top of his helmet, which sported a red visor protecting his robotic eyes that glowed with a soft amber light. A continuous feed of paper glossed out from a slot on his armored chest as if it had a life of its own, providing both utility and an odd sense of whimsy. Behind the slot, the faint sound of a direct thermal printer at work could be heard. His entire being oozed agility and combat readiness, juxtaposed with a slot that seemed incongruous, yet not entirely out of place.<br />
<br />
Mike, now more machine than man—or cat, stirred to life, his movements rigid and precise. He took a moment to assess his surroundings, his ears twitching with digital sound effects.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the... What the heck happened to me, Jake?!&quot; Mike&#39;s voice now held an imposing robotic reverb, interspersed with the chirps and beeps of electronic processing.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s mouth opened and closed, humor evaporating into a palpable anxiety. &quot;I... Mike, I didn&#39;t think—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;—Print job initiated. Ready to print. Please confirm with &#39;OK&#39; or cancel,&quot; Mike interjected, a dollop of frustration edged in his mechanized tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just... I thought you&#39;d like a job, you know, as a printer. But, not like this! Not as a... a samurai, ninja cat thing with a printer chest!&quot; Jake stammered, gesturing helplessly at the fantastical figure before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Document ready to print. Error. This unit is not familiar with these parameters!&quot; Mike continued, his speech an odd blend of his usual demeanor and a printer&#39;s technical lexicon. His eyes flashed, an inner turmoil ebbing beneath his stoic mask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I&#39;m sorry, Mike. It’s this program—it…it changed you. I didn&#39;t know it would do this,&quot; Jake admitted, gaze falling to his laptop screen, the cursor still blinking expectantly in the echo of his colossal mistake.<br />
<br />
A tense silence filled the room as Mike processed his roommate&#39;s confession. But then, the palpable tension waned, replaced by an intrigue that widened Mike&#39;s glowing eyes. &quot;This unit is... curious. Initiating test of abilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Mike performed a swift, sharp kata, movements precise and elegant. In one fluid motion, he spat a sword of paper from one hand, transformed it into a paper plane with the other, then launched it across the room, soaring and looping before returning as if summoned back to his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this could have been worse. I could&#39;ve ended up as—an inkjet,&quot; Mike said, the corner of his mouth twitching upward in reluctant humor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, man. I&#39;ll find a way to fix this,&quot; Jake hastily offered, though it was met with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
“Let’s just see what &#39;this unit&#39; can do first.&quot; Mike brandished his paper sword with newfound enthusiasm, adopting a pose. &quot;After all, how many can print out their homework and defend their thesis with equal flair?&quot;<br />
<br />
In the cramped space of the dorm room, a sense of absurdity mingled with an air of curiosity. Jake, still grappling with the heaviness of his blunder, directed his focus onto his laptop, hunting down the new network printer that Mike had become.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, if you&#39;re really a printer now, I should be able to connect to you remotely,&quot; Jake muttered as he tapped away at the keyboard. &quot;That is, if you show up on the network.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike, calming into his bizarre new existence, raised his arm, eyeing Jake like a lens before a subject. &quot;Hold still; capturing image,&quot; Mike said, sounding amused by his own robotic directive.<br />
<br />
His eyes emitted an imperceptible flash, almost like the flicker of a shutter, capturing a still image of Jake in his bewildered state. With mechanical precision, the slot on his chest whirred to life as a photorealistic print of Jake began to emerge from within the armored cavity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your photograph is being processed, please wait,&quot; Mike announced, watching as Jake&#39;s face contorted between frustration and fascination.<br />
<br />
Jake snickered despite the situation. &quot;You know, if someone told me this morning my roomie would turn into a walking, talking printer, I would&#39;ve asked what they were smoking.&quot;<br />
<br />
On the laptop screen, a notification popped up, signaling the detection of a new device on the network. &quot;Gotcha!&quot; Jake exclaimed. &quot;Sending a test page, now.&quot; He clicked with intention, following the prompt procedure to print a test page.<br />
<br />
&quot;Receiving data,&quot; Mike robotically intoned. He bent forward slightly, bracing himself as if he expected something more catastrophic than a simple print job. Moments later, a standard pattern of colors, along with the printer&#39;s information and a congratulatory &#39;Test Page Printed Successfully!&#39; slogan, curled stiffly from the slot.<br />
<br />
Jake leaped up to grab the test page, inspecting it closely. &quot;Wow, I&#39;ll be damned. It actually works! I mean, you… work.&quot; He turned to Mike, offering a sheepish half-smile. &quot;Quality&#39;s impressive, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they said print is dead,&quot; Mike quipped, finally allowing himself to relax into a grin, although his expressions were now metallic and fixed. His gaze roamed to the picture in Jake’s hands, then to the test page.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s fingers danced across the keyboard as he navigated through the Chronivac&#39;s mystifying interface, his eyes ravenous for a solution. &quot;Hey, Mike, I think I&#39;ve found the settings panel for... well, you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike’s visor flickered with an illustration of an eyebrow raised in curiosity. &quot;Settings panel? As in, options to adjust my current... specifications?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly,&quot; Jake replied, tilting his screen towards Mike. &quot;Look, it&#39;s got sliders and drop-down menus for everything. We can tweak all sorts of parameters here. Maybe we can even undo this whole mess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike peered over the laptop, his metallic fingers poised as if ready to swipe through the digital controls himself. &quot;Intriguing,&quot; he mused. &quot;Perhaps we could modify a less drastic feature. Just as a test. What about &#39;Language&#39;? I&#39;ve always wanted to be fluent in a foreign tongue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake chuckled, maneuvering the cursor to the specified setting. &quot;Japanese, then? You could become the most high-tech tutor on campus overnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Initiate language alteration to &#26085;&#26412;&#35486; (Japanese),&quot; Mike articulated, clearly fascinated by the potential change.<br />
<br />
With a hesitant click, Jake confirmed the alteration. A brief loading icon spun before them, and the deed was done. Mike&#39;s posture straightened, imperceptible adjustments flickering across his robotic frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#22793;&#26356;&#12364;&#25104;&#21151;&#12375;&#12414;&#12375;&#12383;&#12290;&#12393;&#12358;&#12356;&#12383;&#12375;&#12414;&#12375;&#12390;&#12290;&#31169;&#12399;&#20170;&#12289;&#27969;&#26274;&#12395;&#26085;&#26412;&#35486;&#12434;&#35441;&#12377;&#12371;&#12392;&#12364;&#12391;&#12365;&#12414;&#12377;,&quot; Mike said crisply, his tone seamless and accent authentic.<br />
<br />
Jake stared blankly, his ears catching the language but his mind grappling with comprehension. &quot;Uh, Mike? That&#39;s great and all, but I have no idea what you just said.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike tilted his head, analyzing Jake&#39;s confused expression. &quot;&#12372;&#12417;&#12435;&#12394;&#12373;&#12356;&#12289;&#12472;&#12455;&#12452;&#12463;&#12290;&#31169;&#12399;&#12383;&#12384;&#12486;&#12473;&#12488;&#12375;&#12390;&#12356;&#12414;&#12375;&#12383;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake blanched slightly, the cryptic beauty of Japanese doing nothing to alleviate his confusion. &quot;Right, let&#39;s switch you back to English before we accidentally start a robotics anime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake quickly navigated back to the language settings, switching the option from Japanese to English, and confirmed the change. As the interface processed the alteration, he released a breath he didn&#39;t realize he had been holding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change successful. Thank you for selecting English. I must express a level of satisfaction with the ability to adapt my linguistic capabilities on-the-fly,&quot; Mike reported, his voice back to its original synthesized English timbre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew, there we go,&quot; Jake sighed, a hint of relief lacing his voice. &quot;I gotta admit, this is pretty wild. I can change your language just like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike pondered quietly for a moment before responding. &quot;Indeed, although I must admit, having an array of languages at my disposal was an intriguing prospect.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s eyes lit up as he scrolled through the Chronivac interface, landing on a section that was all-too-perfect for Mike&#39;s current form. &quot;Whoa, check this out, Mike. There are settings here related to ninja skills—stealth, agility, combat... even shuriken aiming. They&#39;ve really thought of everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s digitalized feline ears perked up with interest. “Ah, so my existence isn’t simply for printouts. Let’s explore my... ninja attributes, shall we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s give it a go,&quot; Jake agreed, a newfound excitement in his voice. He read through the options, marveling at the detailed customization available.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, we&#39;ve got &#39;Stealth Mode&#39;, &#39;Agility Boost&#39;, and &#39;Precision Targeting&#39; for starters,&quot; Jake listed off the features.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm, &#39;Stealth Mode&#39; sounds promising. How does it work?&quot; Mike inquired, the glow from his visor intensifying with anticipation.<br />
<br />
Jake clicked through to read the description, &quot;Says here it enhances your ability to move silently and stay undetected. You&#39;ll blend into your surroundings—well, as much as a metal ninja cat can blend in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A worthwhile test. Activate it,&quot; Mike responded with a robotic nod.<br />
<br />
Jake hesitated for a brief moment before clicking &#39;Activate&#39;. A progress bar appeared, and upon completion, Mike&#39;s body emitted a subtle whir as it adapted to the setting.<br />
<br />
Mike looked around, assessing himself. He took a few silent steps, not a sound emanating from his movements. He moved with a fluid grace, his figure blurring slightly at the edges, like a living shadow. &quot;Incredible. Initiating stealth approach.&quot; He slowly crept around the room, nearly invisible if not for the occasional glint of light off his armor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, that&#39;s insane. I almost lost you for a second there,&quot; Jake remarked, not quite believing his own eyes. &quot;How do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;System reports an increase in ambulatory efficiency. Fascinating,&quot; Mike said as he deactivated Stealth Mode and reappeared distinctly in front of Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s try the &#39;Agility Boost&#39; next,&quot; Jake suggested with a mischievous grin.<br />
<br />
On Jake&#39;s cue, Mike&#39;s system recalibrated once more. Soon, the robot cat performed a series of backflips, landing with precision and balance on the narrow edge of their dorm desk.<br />
<br />
He executed a jubilant leap off, easily sticking the landing. &quot;This agility boost is highly effective,&quot; Mike said, almost playfully. &quot;I could navigate any terrain with this level of prowess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now for &#39;Precision Targeting&#39;,&quot; Jake said, moving on to the next feature. Once selected, a targeting reticle appeared in Mike&#39;s visor display.<br />
<br />
Mike instinctively raised his arm, now feeling every bit the part of the ancient shinobi, and from a compartment in his forearm, he ejected a perfectly formed paper shuriken. With a flick of his wrist, he launched it toward a makeshift target on the wall, a poster of their college mascot. The shuriken hit dead center, puncturing the paper with pinpoint accuracy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Target subdued. This could prove highly effective... should the need for office supply-themed defense arise,&quot; Mike reported, with a twinge of humor.<br />
<br />
Jake couldn&#39;t help but laugh, a mix of relief and joy bubbling up. &quot;You&#39;ve got to admit, despite how weird this is, it&#39;s pretty darn cool.&quot;</p>
