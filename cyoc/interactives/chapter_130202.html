<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Doctor Jones rarely had business that actually took him to Horizon, usually as his work often was there to help people adapt to Animalian Instincts and find mates. This meant that he wasn&#39;t needed for a lot of Horizon&#39;s research into what the Animalia Virus could or would do and especially not with regard to trying to refine the virus so that it could be used on humans without turning them into Animalians. He knew that was one of Horizon&#39;s projects, as given the Animalia Virus&#39;s near instant cure for just about everything, it would make sense to find a way for the virus to be equipped for that purpose to help humanity. If people wanted to become Animalians, that was perfectly fine, but for the moment, it meant that anyone wanting a cure for disease, lost limbs, or other ailments HAD to become an Animalian.<br />
<br />
The only place where the Animalia Virus didn&#39;t have that full healing issue often related to psychological issues, and that was where he was often called in. Helping Heather Wrex with regard to dealing with instincts and providing service as part of her probation was one of those things, and often helping those that were fairly shy for various reasons find and converse with potential mates were the things that he had to deal with the most. Especially when one considered that the biggest single problem that most Animalians seemed to have was in finding love and mates, that could be big. Sometimes it came from an instinctual overload, similar to what had happened with Heather and sometimes it came from the fear that their choices had been wrong, which had been a big thing in Jill&#39;s mind after she became an American Alligator. He was glad that she had found love with Beauregard Shucks and wished her well for when they had their wedding.<br />
<br />
The biggest challenges though with regard to mental health issues that Doctor Jones had found himself confronting ultimately related to things like post-traumatic stress. He knew it was something that was troublesome, particularly for soldiers, police officers, and first responders, basically anyone who went into danger and experienced it. Wanda, the Rhino Guard&#39;s Wooly Rhinoceros was confronting issues like that after surviving the fires and horrors that related to 9/11 and the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York City, but she wasn&#39;t the biggest source of worry on that front. That went to Gazette, a woman who had become a Thompson&#39;s Gazelle Animalian and had gone through much worse than what many in Animalia could have gone through,  the Second World War with the shadow of Nazi anti-Semitism hanging over her.<br />
<br />
Her responses to a lot of that had been different from what many had expected, but from what Doctor Jones had found out, he&#39;d figured that much of the concerns that Horizon had with regard to their research  and Gazette had to do with Gazette&#39;s own case of post-traumatic stress. Normally, these things were something that were private and remained within the context of his office, but Doctor Jones had to admit that Horizon and Animalia DID have some concerns regarding the way Gazette&#39;s stresses and actions had manifested. Thus why he had come to Horizon to talk with Doctor Stein on what he&#39;d found.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for coming, Doctor Jones,&quot; Doctor Stein spoke as he welcomed the therapist into his own office at Horizon, &quot;as this is a critical point...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That will depend on your definition of critical,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke in warning, &quot;and keep in mind that Gazette&#39;s privacy is of the most importance to me as a therapist.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein held up his hands apologetically, &quot;I&#39;m not asking for any personal secrets... It&#39;s just that we want to make sure that Gazette&#39;s case isn&#39;t such that we&#39;re going to have cases of nymphomania running rampant... particularly with older people who have become Animalians. Many of those actions that have been reported, while they haven&#39;t been criminal HAVE made people uneasy, which in the present political atmosphere could do Animalia and Horizon a lot of harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones nodded. It was that consideration that was the reason why he&#39;d come to Horizon to inform Doctor Stein on what he&#39;d found so far in his sessions with Gazette. Her stresses from WW2 were in Doctor Jones&#39;s opinion the cause of her nymphomania, as it happened to be the way her PTSD manifested after her transformation into an Animalian. She wasn&#39;t a real threat to anyone, but that didn&#39;t mean that people who didn&#39;t understand or had no intention of welcoming anyone different wouldn&#39;t let her be who she was. He could help her with continued therapy, but Doctor Jones knew that in many ways he needed time that Animalia couldn&#39;t be assured of thanks to the past Presidential election.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke, &quot;and that is why I&#39;ve agreed to talk with you with regard to my diagnosis... though, obviously I can&#39;t give you any specifics.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some generalities and suggestions will be fine,&quot; Doctor Stein assured him, &quot;Most of this is more to make sure all our bases are covered and won&#39;t be something that will come up in other situations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I can agree that Gazette has a case of nymphomania, but so long as she continues to come for therapy, I wouldn&#39;t say that she&#39;s a threat to anyone,&quot; Doctor Jones reported, &quot;You can be assured of that... and to a great extent, I&#39;d say she IS in control of herself. Perhaps a bit more easily aroused than the average Animalian, but not such that she&#39;s out of control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be good,&quot; Doctor Stein wiped his brow, &quot;You&#39;d keep her having therapy sessions?&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Jones slowly nodded, &quot;I&#39;d think that would be best for her. Though there are some things that would be of help for her...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot; Doctor Stein asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The big thing I would advise is acceptance,&quot; Doctor Jones spoke, &quot;not to reject her because some of her tastes are beyond the Animalian norm. Let her know that she is welcome for who she is. As there is nothing wrong with who she is or her choices. That sort of thing would be the best that can be done for her and the best I can give you in relation to therapist/client confidentiality.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein nodded, &quot;We can relay that... Just so long as we&#39;re sure that there isn&#39;t a problem...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as she stays with her therapy and is accepted, there shouldn&#39;t be,&quot; Doctor Jones assured him.</p>
