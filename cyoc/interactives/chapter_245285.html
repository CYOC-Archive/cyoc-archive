<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Although Kari greatly enjoyed spending time with Yomi within the capital, it had been far too long since she had visited Genki and his family. Making plans to pay her boyfriend a visit, Kari was pleasantly surprised as Yomi asked if she could go with her.<br />
<br />
Kari, of course, agreed anticipating the journey with her aunt. As they began though, she became concerned about her aunt&#39;s mannerisms.<br />
<br />
Yomi was anxious, her shoulders tense, her steps measured, as her eyes darted around nervously. Kari curiously watching her aunt, her own anxiety now rising at her aunts behavior.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is everything okay Yomi?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never leave the capital alone&quot; she whispered. &quot;Mother, father, or Jiro always come with me. They say it&#39;s too dangerous. I....I think I did so once, when I did....it&#39;s it&#39;s a blur but something happened. I think it&#39;s why I was gone for so long. Something bad happened...but I can&#39;t remember. I...I shouldn&#39;t have come.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari watched as Yomi nervously pulled on her kimono,, the eight tailed kitsune reminding Kari of a frightened animal. Kari suspected she knew why. Despite her aunt&#39;s memory loss, fragments remained. Those fragments haunting the vixen with her own death. Slowly, Kari reached her hand over, gently squeezing Yomi&#39;s hand in her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yomi,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Yomi listen to the sound of my voice. I&#39;m here, I&#39;ll make sure nothing happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yomi&#39;s breathing was shallow, her eyes still darting around nervously. Taking a breath, she tried to calm herself, listening to the soothing words of her niece.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Kari,&quot; she whimpered. &quot;Your voice, it reminds me of my twin Hikari. I loved my sister, even if she tried to boss me around. She always knew what to say after Jiro left to join the army, You remind me of her, did you ever meet her?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari paused, a sad smile spreading across her vulpine face. Technically she had, everytime she looked in the mirror. Kari was aware of who she once was, but had no knowledge of who Hikari used to be. That part of her was gone, erased by Lilith&#39;s spell. She would never be Hikari, even if she was told she carried many of her personality traits.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I can&#39;t say that I have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you would have liked her,&quot; Yomi said. &quot;It&#39;s odd. As I watch you and your sister Haley, it reminds me of how Hikari and I were when I was young. Hikari acted as the responsible sister, even though we were the same age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Yomi replied. &quot;She sometimes made fun of me, called me a crybaby. But, I remember the time she cried when Jiro left for the army and she didn&#39;t get to say goodbye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You keep saying the name Jiro,&quot; Kari said. &quot;Is there another relative I don&#39;t know about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yomi sighed, her brow creasing at the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;I keep forgetting Jiro changed his name to Fukushu when he joined the army,&quot; she said. &quot;But how can someone change their name? I never heard any other soldier change their name. Fukushu&#39;s name is Jiro and to me it will always be Jiro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari nodded, stifling a grin as she too began to wonder about her uncle&#39;s name. To her knowledge, the name Jiro referred to the second son in Japanese. Why would Tatsu and Shizen name Fukushu, Jiro and why would he change his name?<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; Yomi continued. &quot;The day Jiro left for the army I was the only one who saw him. I had sneaked outside my parents room the night before and heard mother and father arguing. They were unsure of Jiro&#39;s decision. I stayed up all night and stopped him before he left. I didn&#39;t want him to go. He told me he had to, but made me breakfast before he left. Jiro always knew how I liked my breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s oddly sweet of him,&quot; Kari smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jiro has always been sweet,&quot; Yomi grinned. &quot;But, he always feels he needs to be strong and scary. Its how he has become our people&#39;s strongest warrior.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Kari nodded. &quot;So, you were saying something about Hikari?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes silly me,&quot; Yomi chuckled. &quot;After Jiro left, I went to bed in the room I shared with Hikari. I must have slept most of the morning because the sun was bright in our room. I awoke to the sound of Hikari crying. When I asked why, she sobbed that Jiro didn&#39;t say goodbye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what did you do?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got out of bed and hugged my sister tightly,&quot; Yomi replied. &quot;I had seen mother stroke our fur to soothe us when we cried and did the same for my sister. I kept reassuring her that Jiro would come back and that everything would be okay. Eventually, Hikari calmed down. She never talked about it again, but I think she appreciated the gesture.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari gazed at Yomi as the kitsune finished her story, a warm smile spreading across her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure if she was here she would thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Approaching Genki&#39;s farm, Kari waved as she noticed Ikumi emerge onto the porch. The yellow kitsune vixen sporting a solemn expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Ikumi, is everything okay?&quot; Kari asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid not,&quot; Ikumi sighed. &quot;Michiko.... Obaasan, she&#39;s....not well today. It&#39;s her mind, I&#39;m afraid she&#39;s quite agitated. I hate to say this knowing how far you traveled, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be able to have dinner tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari&#39;s shoulders slumped. She was looking forward to introducing Genki&#39;s family to Yomi. As she looked to respond, Yomi stepped forward, bowing politely as she smoothed her purple kimono.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings,&quot; she said. &quot;My name is Yomi. I am Kari&#39;s aunt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kari&#39;s aunt,&quot; Ikumi asked in confusion. &quot;Kari, I wasn&#39;t aware you had any other living aunt&#39;s aside from Kiko. Is this true?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a long story Ikumi,&quot; Kari sighed. &quot;But yes, she&#39;s my aunt. She&#39;s.....been away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ikumi nodded, studying the eight tailed kitsune carefully. She recalled hearing rumors of another daughter of the celestials, but had thought it to be a story. To her knowledge, there were six children. Perhaps this seventh child lived within the castle, never venturing outside. Yomi now stepped forward, peering into the simple home.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I may, would you lead me to Obaasan? I believe I can help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ikumi raised an eyebrow, curiously studying the vixen before nodding. As Yomi and Kari entered, Kari immediately noticed Genki, Emiko, and Nanami the siblings looking distressed as they sat within the living room. Genki now stood, approaching Kari with a solemn expression on his vulpine face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Kari,&quot; he said sadly. &quot;Kind of a bad time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;What happened?&quot; Kari asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its Obaasan,&quot; Emiko sighed sadly. &quot;I don&#39;t know what started it, but she had a fit. She doesn&#39;t recognize anyone and she&#39;s lashed out, it....it was frightening. She keeps calling for her mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was my fault,&quot; Nanami sniffed. &quot;I went into her room and woke her from her nap. I mentioned that you were stopping by and how I visited the capital not too long ago. I asked if she ever visited and she started telling me a story about her mother taking her to the capital when she was young. Then her eyes kinda glazed over and she didn&#39;t recognize me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not your fault Nanami,&quot; Ikumi stated, trying to soothe her youngest daughter&#39;s fears. &quot;Obaasan is just having a bad day. It&#39;s happened before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But never this bad,&quot; Genki added.<br />
<br />
The rest of the family went quiet, staring at Michiko&#39;s room as Yomi rubbed her chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;With your permission I would like to try something,&quot; she said. &quot;I believe I can help soothe her mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; Genki asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A spell I learned,&quot; Yomi answered. &quot;But, I will only cast it with your permission.&quot;<br />
<br />
Genki&#39;s family looked to one another, before turning to Yomi. None of them wished to see Obaasan in this state, it was both frightening and sorrowful. Genki now looked to Kari, as if they needed her confirmation before allowing Yomi to help.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust her,&quot; Kari stated. &quot;Yomi can help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding the family parted, allowing Yomi to pass through as they anxiously watched. Kari now trailed behind her aunt as the white furred kitsune entered the elderly kitsunes room.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the bed, Kari could see Michiko. The elderly eight tails eyes glazed and fearful. She looked confused, frightened, as she clutches her blanket. As Yomi entered, she gasped backing away in terror.<br />
<br />
&quot;W..who are you,&quot; she stammered. &quot;What...what am I doing here? Where is my mother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Yomi said softly. &quot;My name is Yomi. Can you tell me your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mi..Michiko,&quot; she stammered. &quot;I...I was headed to the capital. My..my mother wished for me to meet Lady Shizen. S..she wishes for me to meet her son....Fukushu.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What a coincidence that&#39;s my brother,&quot; Yomi replied, sporting a warm smile. &quot;I can help you with that Michiko, if you let me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michiko nodded timidly as Yomi approached. From a distance, Kari watched as her aunt now gently placed her hands along Michiko&#39;s temples.<br />
<br />
It was hard to describe what she saw. Yomi&#39;s eyes began to glow. Purple, ethereal smoke wafting from the white kitsunes fingertips as they began to swirl around the elderly kitsune&#39;s face. Slowly but surely, Kari watched as Michiko&#39;s face began to relax, her eyes becoming more focused. The look of fear gradually melting away as the serene expression Kari was accustomed to returning to the elderly Michiko&#39;s face. As the spell completed, Michiko blinked as Yomi stepped away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello dear,&quot; Michiko smiled. &quot;You&#39;re Genki&#39;s girlfriend right? Kari I think it was?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes that&#39;s right,&quot; Kari said softly. &quot;Do...do you remember me Obaasan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes dear,&quot; Michiko smiled. &quot;Such a sweet girl. Lady Shizen is fortunate to have such a wonderful granddaughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yomi smiled reaching out her hand as she gently assisted Michiko to her feet. As they exited the bedroom Genki and the others tentatively approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Obaasan?&quot; Genki asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Genki my dear boy,&quot; Michiko replied warmly. &quot;Your girlfriend and her lovely aunt were just talking. We had such a pleasant conversation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are...are you feeling okay Obaasan?&quot; Ikumi stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right as rain Ikumi,&quot; Michiko smiled. &quot;I am a bit hungry though. Is dinner ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
As dinner progressed, Kari could only sit back in awe as she watched Michiko interact with her family. While the elderly eight tail still had memory lapses, Kari could tell that the woman was far more coherent than she had been in quite sometime. Obaasan laughed and joked with her family, able to hold conversations with everyone. Kari began to understand why Shizen cared for the vixen so much. Michiko was a vibrant and charming vixen who seemed to go out of her way to make everyone feel welcome.<br />
<br />
As dinner completed, Kari was surprised as Michiko assisted in helping to clear the table. Ikumi and Emiko insisted they could handle it, thanking Obaasan before escorting her to the living room. Taking a seat, she began telling tales of her family as well as stories of Genki and Nanami, which both siblings laughed along with while blushing. Before Kari realized it, the sun had set.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should probably head home Genki,&quot; Kari sighed. &quot;My aunt and I have a long journey ahead of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Genki sighed before turning to Yomi, a warm smile on his face. &quot;I don&#39;t know how to thank you for what you&#39;ve done for Obaasan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was my pleasure,&quot; Yomi grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Genki,&quot; Michiko called. &quot;Don&#39;t keep the poor girl for too long. Just give the girl a kiss and bid her farewell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Obaasan!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari and Genki blushed as they noticed Emiko and Nanami stifle a laugh at Michiko&#39;s statement. Sheepishly Genki rubbed his neck before approaching Kari and giving her a gentle kiss. Saying their goodbyes, Kari and Yomi began the long journey back to the capital.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aunt Yomi,&quot; Kari asked. &quot;How...how did you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic has always come naturally to me,&quot; Yomi stated. &quot;And...I have always wanted to help our people in some way. When I saw how much pain your boyfriend&#39;s Obaasan was in, I knew I could help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you cured her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No not a cure persay,&quot; Yomi stated. &quot;But I was able to fix her mind. Old age weakens the mind, sometimes before the body like Michiko. I can not fix everything with her, but I can at least help. Genki and his family at least deserve to have their Obaasan to be mentally sound with what little time she has left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I don&#39;t know what to say,&quot; Kari stammered. &quot;Thank you. Thank you so much. You have no idea how much this means to me and Genki&#39;s family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome Kari,&quot; Yomi smiled. As the pair turned towards the road, Yomi paused. The white kitsune fidgeting nervously as she stared down the darkened path.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aunt Yomi?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid of the dark,&quot; Yomi replied meekly. &quot;Would you mind if I illuminated the path?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all Aunt Yomi,&quot; Kari smiled.<br />
<br />
Yomi breathed a sigh of relief, the eight tailed kitsune casting a spell, several orbs of light now circling the pair. Now comfortable, Yomi took Kari&#39;s hand in hers as they began the trip home. Kari beginning to understand her aunt a bit better, and thankful to have her once more.</p>
