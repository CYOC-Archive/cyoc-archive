<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Tell me Miss Burgess,” Cellarius asked. “Was my assessment of you accurate?” She nodded, but figured he’d already known the answer to that. <br />
<br />
“What are you?” She asked.<br />
<br />
“A being who shares his power with this magnificent house. And someone who wants to help you move past your insecurities…”<br />
<br />
“But how?”<br />
<br />
“Well, assume that I can. Ideally, how would you TRULY like to look?” Megan thought for a moment, it wasn’t exactly the type of question you get asked regularly. But she knew exactly what irked her about her appearance, and she answered almost automatically, and perhaps to her detriment… <br />
<br />
“I want to look older than I am. People always assume that I’m a teen for crying out loud! I want to look like the mature woman that someone would expect to see with Brian…” Cellarius nodded in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Then let it be done.” he said, raising his hands as he disappeared from the mirror, leaving only Megan’s reflection.<br />
<br />
Megan felt an overwhelming sense of calm suddenly, and warmth, a warmth that was spreading rapidly throughout her body, especially her loins… She moaned slightly, not remembering the last time she felt like this outside of Brian’s embrace. She closed her eyes to bask in the moment as her clothes disappeared from her body. Megan’s lanky frame began to become puffier as the house’s magic flowed through her, changing her into the woman she exclaimed she wanted to be. Her A-cup breasts began to swell slowly as she bit her lower lip. They expanded as fat poured into them, filling out as Megan always dreamed they would. She opened her eyes and gasped as he watched her breasts inflate before her eyes. Her taut stomach began to grow ever so slightly, as she gained cute love handles. She looked down at her thighs as they too grew, with fat and a little bit of muscle appeared on her otherwise toothpick-like legs. They grew as her hips expanded, giving her an hourglass figure for the first time in her life. Her skin glistened as it became darker, gaining a much needed beach tan over her relatively pale complexion.<br />
<br />
Megan laughed as a tear rolled down her cheek, amazed by what she was experiencing. But as she looked down again at her stomach, she realized something was off. The minimal fat that had grown on her stomach was still flowing, giving her a pudgy appearance in her gut. Her thighs continued to grow, becoming very padded as she felt herself rise slightly under the increased size of her ass. Her breasts continued to grow, exceeding DD’s before her very eyes. She was about to call out to Cellarius before she felt a different feeling. In addition to the warmth still throughout her body, she felt something she could only describe as an ache, in nearly every part of her body. Then, fatigue hit her. She gasped as her stomach stopped growing, leaving her with a pudgy gut. Her breasts also stopped growing at an E-up, but they were still changing, losing whatever youthful perkiness they had, even at their new size. Freckles and other skin spots appeared, dotting her chest. Confused, she looked into the mirror, nearly screaming at what she saw.<br />
<br />
Her face was still the same, but now, lines that were not there before had appeared, mostly around her mouth and in the corners of her eyes. She looked like her mother… The changes continued, as her neck grew with some fat, and her chin sagged a bit as her face was fuller from her new weight. Her lips inflated a bit, and her top eyelids lowered slightly, giving her a more aged look. Her dark brown hair grew out from her bob-hairstyle until it reached below her shoulders, changing color to a dirty blonde, with some brown and slight grays in her roots. <br />
<br />
“What, what is happening…” She said, hearing her deeper voice. Her head began to hurt as she closed her eyes, bracing for the slight pain. And then, just as quickly as it arrived, it had gone, and Megan sat there, panting from the transformation that had just occurred. She opened her eyes and gasped, as the room around her had changed also.<br />
<br />
The once bare bedroom was now an elegant master bedroom with a luxurious four-post bed, mahogany vanity table, leather chair, and multiple closets. It looked like the bedroom of a mature woman obsessed with her looks. And speaking of looks, Megan glanced in the mirror, again gasping at what she saw. Megan still looked like herself, but now more resembled her mother more than anything. She had several age lines that flowed around her mouth and from the corners of her eyes. Her massive breasts hung freely from her chest, just above her pudgy stomach. Her thighs were so large that the inside of them touched each other as she sat. <br />
<br />
“Oh my God…” She exclaimed, covering her mouth, still not used to her mature and sultry voice. Cellarius once again appeared in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“Are you satisfied, Miss Burgess?” He asked curiously.<br />
<br />
“Satisfied?! I’m OLD!” She yelled, holding up her arms, feeling the slight flabbiness in them jiggle. “What did you do to me?”<br />
<br />
“Only what you asked. You wanted to look more mature, and so the house delivered. You are no longer Megan Burgess, 25 years old, but Meredith Burgess, 45.” Meredith gasped; 45 years old… She had lost twenty years of her life in what seemed like an instant. Cellarius said nothing, but only watched as Meredith ran her hands over her curves, now seemingly admiring what she had become. Cellarius waved his hand and the closet doors next to her opened, revealing two large walk-in closets filled to the brim with expensive outfits of all sorts. Meredith looked at him in the mirror as he extended his arm toward the closet, offering for her to look.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps you would feel more comfortable with something on, Miss Burgess?” She swallowed hard, feeling waves of shock, confusion, and arousal, all at the same time. But she could not resist the fact that she now had the curves she had always wanted. She stood up, grabbing the chair as she was not used to her new center of gravity. Her whole body jiggled slightly, which only aroused her more. She walked into the first closet, examining the underwear and lingerie that lay before her. She ran her hand over the smooth silky clothes as a smile slowly appeared on her face. She grabbed a dark purple bra and panties, slipping the panties over her thick thighs, and clasping the bra into place to support her massive tits. There was another mirror in the closet, allowing her to examine her entire body. She wasn’t obese by any stretch of the imagination. She just had enough thickness on her bones to make any man drool at the sight of her. She ran her hands up over her large breasts and squeezed them, moaning as it sent waves of pleasure through her body. She ran her hands down and into her panties, rubbing her older pussy before shoving a finger inside, gasping with pleasure as she came almost instantly. The feeling of her new body was incredible, despite her now older age. She grinned in the mirror before coming to a realization.<br />
<br />
“Wait, what will Brian think of me?!” She exclaimed. Cellarius appeared before her in the mirror.<br />
<br />
“I believe he will enjoy it.” Cellarius said. “But there is something between you two that I have rarely seen before. A deep and powerful love for each other. You need not fret, Miss Burgess. Mister Parker will love you for who you are on the inside, regardless of how you look. But I would argue that this is an improvement that will undoubtedly make him more aroused than he has ever been.” Meredith exhaled. Cellarius’ kind words assured her, and she knew they were true. They both loved each other dearly. But there was still one question that remained.<br />
<br />
“But wait, is Brian changing as well?” Cellarius nodded.<br />
<br />
“Of course my dear. Perhaps you would like to see for yourself?” He said. Meredith ran out of the closet as soon as she could and went to open the door and reunite with her boyfriend, unsure of what he would become…</p>
