<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Some days prior to the meeting between Selicia and Abernathy:<br />
<br />
Emily Rudge, age thirty six, abnormally tall at six foot, three inches tall, her long brunette hair trailing down to her mid-back, deep brown eyes, modest B cup chest, and a perpetual scowl. Having been a member of a branch family of House Rudge, she had to work hard for her current position. She now worked directly for the main house with the prospect of being formally adopted into it. Nothing was going to come between her and her goals, nothing...<br />
<br />
Emily was assigned leadership of the Investigation unit sent by her house in response to the discovery made by the heiress of the reinstated House Dawson. She&#39;d heard about the sad state of the victim brought before the council. Not even a shard of them left in a half baked state of existence. She shuddered at the very thought of it, that was the monster they were going to hunt today. She had brought seven sisters and cousins with her on this expedition of sorts, pray that they either find nothing or succeed today.<br />
<br />
Once they were geared up and ready to proceed, Emily set her group onward to their section of the search. They were to patrol the northeastern hills in the event that the witch was hiding in that direction. As they arrived and unpacked their vehicles to set up their base camp, Emily saw to the placement of everything. There was minor resentment for her micromanagement, she knew, but they would just have to deal with it.<br />
<br />
For two days, they marched through those empty hills... Nothing anywhere except the occasional farm and copse of trees, of course both of these were investigated by their authority if need be. It seemed that there would be no threat for them after all, thank god... However on this day when they returned to the camp, the twin sisters they had left to watch the camp were nowhere to be found. That was until they came to the main tent set on the side closest to the town.<br />
<br />
There the rest of them gathered before the life-size statues of the twin sisters settled on all fours with their arms closest to the tent door raised and hands clutched as if paws. Both of them wore fierce expressions with their mouths open like they were shouting angrily. The breasts hanging unsupported and legs spread wide enough to display their most private areas. Both of them must&#39;ve assumed these positions and then been turned into their smooth stone forms. The perpetrator of their imprisonment stepped out of the tent with a grand throwing open of the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve kept me waiting... Shame on you... I had to entertain myself with these two~&quot; Abernathy stepped forward between the two stone women and place her hands on their heads almost affectionately. &quot;Now won&#39;t you all be a dear and join me on my friendly little visit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking her head, Emily gritted her teeth against the ensuing mental fog. She staggered and held her head as the fog thickened in her mind. Her will would not let her relent however feeling the wrongness in the way the fog pervaded her mind from so many angles. Holding onto the glimmer of herself deep within, the fog began to fade away leaving her a little weary but, still conscious. Standing up to her full height, Emily eyed the woman standing before her and her squad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re goal is here but, you -will- leave or we will -force- you to leave!&quot; Snarling her words, Emily took a step toward the witch watching as her squad closed in with her. The woman didn&#39;t seem intimidated in the least, in fact she seemed more confident than she had stepping out of the tent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my... You&#39;re a resilient one aren&#39;t you? I guess five will do~&quot; She waved her hand dismissively and giggled manically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Six...&quot; Emily corrected the witch vehemently. &quot;Will be more than enough to deal with you...&quot; She took another advancing step as the rest of them hung back awaiting her next move. It seemed they were going to follow her lead in this engagement. That was fine, just more of a chance to show her value to the house and secure that adoption to the main house. Allowing herself a confident grin, she smelled the sweet air around her, it must&#39;ve been her sense of impending victory making the air smell so much better. With another step forward, she felt her body tense with the motion, excitement taking over.<br />
<br />
She rushes the last few steps forward and lands a fist squarely against the witch&#39;s cheek causing her to drape over the back of the younger twin. Grabbing the witch by the collar of her dress, Emily threw her to the ground a short distance away. All the while the others watched in rapt to attention to the one-sided beat-down. Laughing as she swung away on the prone witch, Emily eventually brought her face nose to nose with the witch. As she made to speak, she made particular note of the witch&#39;s open mouth... It was then that the reality of her situation came rushing in all at once.<br />
<br />
As the spell crashed against her and her squad-mates, she was the only one to remain sane afterward. The rest of the squad all stood about dully before maddened grins took over their faces. When the witch taunted her about needing only five, she had sent another spell into Emily. A spell that Emily had no awareness of when it happened... That smell in the air as she took her next step forward wasn&#39;t coming from the hills, it was coming from her... That sweet scent of vanilla... Her body tensed as it started taking on a crumbling crust like texture while her feet combined into her legs that thickened quickly.<br />
<br />
Next, she was laying on the ground unable to support herself any longer, on her legs having become motionless stubs. Shrinking as she laughed hysterically believing herself winning an imaginary altercation while her sex&#39;s fluids foamed out between her legs. As she shrank, her sex spread wide with her once legs sliding into the deep pocket her body now formed. Her foaming fluids took on a texture like whipped cream and reeked of that same vanilla scent. In place of her clit was half a strawberry placed cut inward as she change left her vaguely aware but, completed as a strawberry banana crepe with vaguely human features.<br />
<br />
The witch confidently strode forward and scooped her off the ground taking a deep smell of her body. With a devilish smile, she bit into her taking a whole legs and the corner of her sex that held it. Emily felt exaltation with the feeling of the bites as she was chewed away bite by bite. Soon all that was left was bites containing just beneath her &#39;head&#39; and her &#39;head&#39; itself. The second to last bite taken, the spell released her illusion bringing her back to reality. She panicked as the last piece of her was placed on Abernathy&#39;s tongue. A mental scream, a plea for help unheard as the bite came down...<br />
<br />
Darkness... Pleasure... A heady feeling... Emily came back around in surprise to find her mind bump into another&#39;s. &#39;Help me...&#39; said the voice inside of it. &#39;Where am I?&#39; as another collided with hers. She realized where she was with dread, consumed by the witch she was preserved within her with all the others she&#39;d taken. &#39;Emily?&#39; she heard from another collision the sound of the older twin&#39;s voice. Way above her, she could feel a powerful but, waning presence that bobbed in the space they all occupied. Occasionally a smaller presence would rise up budging the powerful aside momentarily and settle back among them. Maybe the witch wasn&#39;t as in control as they all thought.<br />
<br />
Abernathy licked the cream off her lips and fingers staring at her now captured group of women. &quot;Come along Ladies, we have an old friend to visit~&quot; Abernathy wiped the remaining saliva on her fingers up the spines of the twin statues before marching toward the town proper. &quot;Oh won&#39;t she be -delighted-~&quot;</p>
