<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once home I watched some cricket on TV while Sarah had a bath and a lie down. At quarter to 5 she came and reminded me it was time to go to ‘Mum and Dads’. I noticed she was wearing jeans and a light blue sleeveless top.<br />
<br />
I put Biddy on his lead and into the car. When we arrived Sarah suggested we take Biddy straight into the backyard as ‘Mum’ was a bit fussy about dogs in the house. Ted must have heard us coming as he was walking up from his shed when we had entered the yard. He squatted down, greeted Biddy, and unclipped the leash. <br />
<br />
The commotion must have alerted Eileen and Jenna to our presence and Biddy excitedly ran to greet the newcomers. Jumped on them, then ran through the open door into the house to check if there was anyone else around. I chased after him and shooed him back outside. I was relieved to see Eileen was laughing at his antics.<br />
<br />
While Biddy was lying on his back enjoying a scratch from Jenna. Ted invited me to come and see what he had done this morning, beckoning me to the shed. I had forgotten to ask Sarah what he actually did out there. What I found was a woodworkers paradise with all sorts of tools and a lathe, Ted showed me some pieces of wood that had shaped this morning saying that the set was coming along nicely. I could only guess that he might have been making an outdoor setting of some kind and was determined to ask Sarah at the 1st opportunity. <br />
I was happy to answer yes when Ted asked whether I would like to get a beer and re-join the ladies. <br />
<br />
We passed Jenna in the yard. She was trying to teach Biddy how to fetch a stick, Biddy just wanted her to chase him. She had a huge smile on her face.<br />
<br />
Sarah and Eileen were in the kitchen inspecting some vegetables that Eileen was preparing. It smelt like a roast was in the oven. Ted said “I’m getting some beers. Would you ladies like a drink?”<br />
<br />
“There is a white in the fridge” said Eileen<br />
<br />
“Take a seat Rod. I won’t be long”<br />
<br />
Before long I we were all seated in the lounge with drinks in hand, talking about the day’s events. I found out that Ted also barracked for the might Tiger’s, my footy team. That made the conversation much easier as we could talk about off season team changes and the prospects for the coming year.<br />
<br />
Eileen went outside to check on Jenna and Biddy. They both came back inside and Jenna mentioned she wanted to get cleaned up before dinner, then disappeared up the hallway, presumably to her room. Sarah was helping her Mum to set the dining table in the other room. I heard Eileen telling her “Use the good crockery tonight” <br />
<br />
While we were alone Ted told me “Rod, If you are going to marry my daughter I expect you to always treat her with respect and dignity. The other stipulation I have is that any grandchildren would be raised as Tigers”.<br />
<br />
I smiled at him “I readily agree”<br />
<br />
The oven bell rang and Eileen came back into the kitchen to check on the roast. “Dinner will be in 5 minutes” she announced<br />
<br />
We got up and wandered into the other room where Sarah was laying out cutlery on a beautifully polished dining table. She indicated the seat I should take on the far side of the table, where there were 2 places set. Ted took the chair at the head of the table immediately to my left. Sarah went to help Eileen bring the food in.<br />
<br />
Ted was telling me the latest about their upcoming holiday when Jenna came in. I couldn’t help but notice her as she had put on a lacy, black, knee length dress, along with lipstick and had brushed her long blond hair, which had earlier been in a ponytail. She really was a beautiful woman. I was further surprised when she sat down in the chair on my right. <br />
<br />
I felt very awkward and glanced at Ted. He said to Jenna “Why don’t you sit over here Jenna” indicating the seat to his left.<br />
<br />
“Oh no Dad, I want to sit with Rod, he is going to be my new brother in law” She did not move. <br />
<br />
Just then Sarah and Eileen came in carrying two meals each. Sarah glared daggers at Jenna when she saw where she had sat. Eileen put down the two plates she was carrying in front of Ted and to the place on his left. Sarah looked as if she was about to throw the plate at Jenna. Eileen touched her arm, trying to calm her and quietly said “Let’s not make a scene” She took the two plates off Sarah, placing one in front of me and the other in front of Jenna. Sarah rushed out of the room with Eileen following.<br />
<br />
I got up and followed them into the lounge where Sarah was sitting on the couch sobbing into her mother’s shoulder. I touched Sarah on the shoulder and she saw me with teary eyes, stood up and buried her head into my chest. Eileen left us alone and returned to the other room. “I didn’t invite her to that seat” I whispered. That prompted Sarah to kiss me on the lips<br />
<br />
“Your mine” she said.<br />
<br />
Once Sarah had got herself back under control and used a tissue to wipe her tears, she picked up the remaining plate and we made our way back into the dining room. I was relieved to see that Jenna had moved to the seat on Ted’s left. That allowed me to resume my seat while Sarah put down the plate in front of her mother and sat beside me.<br />
<br />
We ate in silence, which was a shame as the meal was really nice.<br />
<br />
When we had finished the mains Eileen asked Jenna “Can you help me serve out the pudding” Jenna pouted as she reluctantly followed her mother back to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Ted awkwardly asked “Would either of you like another drink?”<br />
<br />
Sarah’s reply was “I need a wine”<br />
<br />
I said “No thanks, I’m driving” <br />
<br />
Ted left to get Sarah’s drink, leaving us alone. Sarah whispered to me “Oh Zach, I’m so sorry about my family”<br />
<br />
“Shhh. Don’t call me Zach” I was actually flattered that she still thought of me as Zach. “While I’m in this body, I’m Rod”<br />
<br />
“I’ll just visit the toilet. Be back soon” Leaving me alone.<br />
<br />
Eileen and Jenna returned with desserts on a tray, one of which went to each setting. They resumed their seats. Eileen asked “How is your job going Rod?”<br />
<br />
“It’s good Eileen, We haven’t been too busy” I knew little about Rod’s job in IT at the council so replied as generically as I could. <br />
<br />
“At some stage I might get you to look at our computer here. It’s running very slowly” I probably looked a bit awkward as I could feel someone’s feet rubbing against my shin. It had to be Jenna, she was the only person sitting close enough. I glanced at her. She gave me a triumphant smile. Eileen obliviously continued “Don’t bother with it tonight but maybe next time you are over could you have a look?”<br />
<br />
Ted walked back in and handed a glass of wine to Eileen and placed another in Sarah’s spot. Jenna’s foot withdrew. “Sure, next time I’m over” I reminded myself to brush up on my IT skills.<br />
<br />
The pudding was delicious, I complimented Eileen and thanked her for the meal. When Sarah had finished her wine we made our excuses saying it was time to get Biddy back to his bed. Everybody said good bye, Ted shaking my hand and Eileen giving me a hug. I was surprised, but then again not surprised when Jenna also gave me a hug goodbye. Her’s was a bit tighter and lasted longer, her hands gave my butt a rub as she did so.<br />
<br />
Back in the car driving home Sarah said “Jenna is getting worse. I’m so glad that I no longer live there. I so happy to be living with you”<br />
I replied “Sarah, remember it’s Zach in here” <br />
<br />
She placed her hand on my thigh and replied “I know”<br />
<br />
We made love again that night. Simple love in the missionary position. Nothing fancy or highly erotic. We fell asleep in each others arms.<br />
