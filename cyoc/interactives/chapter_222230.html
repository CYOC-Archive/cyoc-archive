<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...a copy of one of mom’s kegel balls.&quot; Belle smirked, her blue eyes flashing with mischief.<br />
<br />
Your face turned a bright shade of red, from embarrassment or anger, you weren&#39;t quite sure. &quot;What?! No way!&quot; You exclaimed.<br />
<br />
While Michelle raised an eyebrow, clearly not expecting that request. “You mean those metallic orbs I use for my exercises? Are you sure about this? That seems a bit... intimate.” Michelle questioned, clearly surprised by her daughter’s rather unique punishment idea.<br />
<br />
Belle smirked, “Exactly. Think about it, Mom. He&#39;d be absolutely harmless, and he’d get a firsthand lesson on humility. Liam would know exactly how it feels to be used as an inanimate object. He should have thought of that before lying to us, and trying to get out of a punishment he rightfully deserved. Plus, this will be a good way for him to understand a woman’s vagina, inside and out. That includes the one where he was birthed out of.&quot; Belle nodded, “I’m sure. It&#39;s a fitting punishment, don&#39;t you think mom?”<br />
<br />
You felt a pang of regret and wished you had just done as Belle had originally asked. “Belle, isn’t this a bit excessive?” You tried to plead.<br />
<br />
Your mother crossed her arms. “It&#39;s either this, or I come up with a punishment of my own,&quot; your mother warned.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, realizing the gravity of the situation and fearing what your mother might come up with, you hesitated for a moment before finally agreeing. &quot;Fine,&quot; you uttered, &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot; You could barely contain your embarrassment. The idea of being inside your mother’s drawer, next to her most intimate items, was too much to bear. But you had no choice; the medallion’s time was almost up.<br />
<br />
You activated the medallion just in time, setting the time limit for 24 hours. You focused on the medallion and imagined the sleek, cold, smooth surface of a metal kegel ball. The world around you started to warp and bend as you began your transformation, shrinking and becoming rounder, and ultimately, you felt the cold sensation of metal enveloping you. Within moments, you transformed into a perfectly round and polished metal ball, an exact replica of one of your mother&#39;s kegel balls, with no indication that you were once a human. You still had all your senses but was unable to move or speak.<br />
<br />
For your mother and sister, it was almost instant. Your form shrunk, your limbs disappeared, and you took on the silvery, shiny appearance of a kegel ball. Both Michelle and Belle stared in amazement at the transformation. The transformation was perfect. Belle bent down to pick up her transformed brother, examining you closely. &quot;Wow, it really does look just like your real ones mom!&quot; She marveled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to admit, I didn&#39;t expect him to actually go through with it,&quot; Michelle whispered to Belle.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a lesson he won&#39;t forget,&quot; Belle responded with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Michelle agreed, &quot;It&#39;s uncanny. He looks like a perfect match. Alright, Belle, give it to me.” Holding out her hand, she took the kegel ball from her daughter and headed to her room.<br />
<br />
Walking over to her dresser, Michelle opened her underwear drawer and noticed her two other kegel balls. She then placed the new one, you, next to them. &quot;You&#39;ll be spending some time in here, mister. Maybe you&#39;ll think twice about misusing that medallion next time.&quot; she said, shutting the drawer. You still had all your senses, though you couldn&#39;t move or speak. The darkness of the drawer was silent, save for the muffled sounds from the house.<br />
<br />
For you, time seemed to stretch endlessly inside the dark drawer, the minutes felt like hours. Eventually you lost track of how long you had been in there. It felt like an eternity. The close proximity of the other two balls made it even weirder for you. The thought that she used these, and were inside your mother&#39;s vagina was in a way is such a turn on because soon you&#39;ll be joining them on their endeavour. After a day full of events, Michelle was so exhausted that she completely forgot about the kegel ball that was, in fact, her son.<br />
<br />
The next morning, as she was getting ready for her yoga session. Your mother opened her underwear drawer. The light pierced through the darkness, blinding you momentarily. But when Michelle peered down, she looked perplexed. &quot;Why do I have three of these?&quot; she murmured, but then simply shrugged it off, attributing it to some lapse in her memory. She decided to use all of them for today&#39;s exercise session.<br />
<br />
To your horror, Michelle’s gentle hand reaching into the drawer and picked you up, along with the other two without much thought, and began prepping for her yoga session. Little did she know, one of those balls she picked up was her son. The next moments were a whirlwind. The cool metal sensation of the balls pressing together as Michelle expertly inserted two in her vagina and you into her anus. The sensation was beyond bizarre for you, and it’s turning you on at an immeasurable level.<br />
<br />
With a gentle squeeze, she prepared to insert the first kegel ball into her vagina, its cool metal surface was quickly warmed by her body. Then, the second one followed, and you braced yourself, knowing you were next. However, instead of the familiar sensation of being inside her vagina, you felt the tight pressure of her anus enveloping you. This was not at all what you were expecting.<br />
<br />
Being inside Michelle&#39;s rectum was unlike anything you could have ever imagined. The environment was tight and warm, with the rhythmic pulsing of her muscles providing a constant reminder of your confinement. The sensation was disorienting and intense, making it impossible to think about anything else.<br />
<br />
The walls of her rectum felt soft yet muscular, and every so often, you would feel a slight shift as Michelle adjusted her posture or moved. You were enveloped in darkness, and it was impossible to discern up from down or left from right. You could feel a unique pressure surrounding you. Unlike the drawer where you were placed initially, this was a living, breathing space that was responsive to your presence.<br />
<br />
The environment was also quite humid and had a distinct organic scent, which was not unpleasant but very different from what you were accustomed to. You also realized that you could &#39;taste&#39; the surroundings. It wasn&#39;t like the taste one would get from eating something but rather an ambient taste that filled the environment.<br />
<br />
There were also muffled sounds that you could pick up. The low, steady beat of Michelle&#39;s heart provided a constant backdrop, but you could also hear other sounds like the gurgling of her stomach or the faint rustle of clothing.<br />
<br />
The entire experience was overwhelming. You tried to focus on the time, trying to predict when you would transform back into your human form. The hours felt like an eternity as you awaited for your release.<br />
<br />
This experience was not only humiliating for you but also deeply introspective and erotic. You had to confront feelings of vulnerability and powerlessness in a way you never had before. It forced you to come to terms with the consequences of your actions and the importance of using the shapeshifting medallion responsibly.<br />
<br />
Throughout her yoga session, you felt every movement, every twist and stretch. It was both uncomfortable, giving you an interesting sexual sensation like never before. After her session, Michelle seemed to forget about the kegel balls entirely, and you remained inside her as she went about her daily activities.</p>
