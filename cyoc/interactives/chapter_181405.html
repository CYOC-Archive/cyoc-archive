<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Darren and his friends bid farewell to the Fae, knowing it would only be a matter of time before they found themselves in that realm once again. Emerging from the portal once more, Darren could see Yuriko and much to his surprise Lynne as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it your trip went well,&quot; Yuriko asked. Darren nodded, glancing back at his friends before pausing. &quot;Steph what are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steph appeared to be measuring herself, a look of concern crossing her gynoid face. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m tall enough,&quot; she said with concern. &quot;My processors are trying to determine if I reached my full height or if I&#39;m shrinking again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your fine Steph,&quot; Lynne chuckled. &quot;First time visiting the Fae I did the same thing.&quot; Darren smiled before noticing the frown cross Hannah&#39;s face. &quot;Look,&quot; Lynne stated. &quot;I&#39;ve, I&#39;ve never been good with apologies but I want to apologize to all of you. I had no right to come in here like I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren now looked between Lynne and Hannah, the teenage gynoid wore a dubious expression while Lynne appeared sincere in her regret. &quot;Hannah cmon,&quot; Darren sighed. &quot;She&#39;s trying to apologize.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hannah sighed deeply, approaching the auburn haired woman before holding out her hand. &quot;Okay fine but if you hurt Darren your going to have to deal with me!&quot; Lynne chuckled, shaking the teenage girls hand.<br />
<br />
With Lynne and Hannah seeming to have buried the hatchet, Darren felt a wave of relief wash over him. He would find out though that his relief would be short-lived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yuriko?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko and the others paused, looking over to see a young auburn haired man in his late 20s enter the backyard. Darren looked to see both Yuriko and Lynne&#39;s eyes go wide, their faces going pale. Lynne appeared to tremble as she now gaped at the young man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah mom its me,&quot; Evan smiled. Lynne said nothing, tears freely flowing down her cheeks. Evan now approached Darren, despite his kind smile Darren couldnt shake the feeling something was wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be the new Catalyst,&quot; Evan stated as he rubbed his well trimmed beard. &quot;Whats your name kid?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Darren,&quot; he stammered. Evan simply nodded, scanning the group. &quot;Looks like you&#39;ve been busy kid,&quot; he said softly. &quot;I take it those two are some of your work.&quot; Darren nodded as Evan now gestured towards Steph and Hannah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan how is this possible,&quot; Yuriko asked. &quot;How can you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come back from the dead,&quot; Evan finished. &quot;Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m full of surprises.&quot; Darren gulped as the man now leaned towards him. &quot;Look Darren,&quot; Evan said kindly. &quot;You&#39;ve done some great things here but, here&#39;s the thing. I&#39;m the one that&#39;s supposed to be the Catalyst.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yuriko and Lynne were now both on edge, Lynne now began to approach her son as Yuriko began to call for Akira and Ayami.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to fight Darren,&quot; Evan stated, placing a reassuring hand on his shoulder. &quot;Hell, I&#39;m sure Yuriko can keep training you and your friends in magic. The thing is, I&#39;m gonna need the Rings.&quot; Evan now reached for the chains around Darren&#39;s neck, as he was about to pull them away they glowed white hot, burning his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan stop,&quot; Lynne pleaded as she approached her son. &quot;Please! Evan, son, don&#39;t do this. Please Evan, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lynne collapsed into her sons arms, squeezing the man she had been forced to kill so many years ago, and sobbing uncontrollable. Evan simply patted his mothers back, an opportunity Darren took to back away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom its okay,&quot; Evan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Lynne sobbed. &quot;No its not. I&#39;m sorry son, I&#39;m so sorry. You left me no choice, I didnt...I didn&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know mom I know,&quot; Evan said softly. &quot;But you can make it up to me. Help me become the Catalyst.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lynne cried harder, burying her head in her sons shoulder. &quot;You know that&#39;s not how it works Evan,&quot; she sniffed. Evan simply sighed as he now looked at his mother. &quot;I love you mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without warning Evan now released an incredible blast of energy, Lynne screaming in pain as the blast disintegrated her. Darren gasped in fright as he listened to Lynne scream, watching as only her skeleton stood for a moment before crumbling.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Evan growled. &quot;I&#39;ve been trying to play nice. I mean don&#39;t get me wrong my mom had that coming. But, I didn&#39;t want to fight, so last chance kid. Hand over the rings!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Darren run,&quot; Yuriko screamed. Darren did as he was told, backpedaling as he watched what transpired.<br />
<br />
The world seemed to slow down, Darren watching as his friends lept to his defense. Hannah and Steph amazingly charged forward. Evan simply scoffed, with a wave of his hand Darren watched as both gynoids shrank down. Reduced to a pair of wind up toys.<br />
<br />
Now it was Misaki and Crystal&#39;s turn. The kitsune lept forward while the fairy tried to cast a spell. For their efforts, Evan put a stop to it. Misaki transformed into a stuffed fox toy while Crystal was turned to stone.<br />
<br />
Darren roared with both grief and rage. Concentraring he now lashed out, looking to end Evan. Evan stumbled, the earth beneath him cracking from the power of Darren&#39;s spell. &quot;Not bad kid,&quot; Evan grinned. &quot;But not good enough!&quot; With a wave of his hand Darren was thrown back crashing into the side of Yurikos home.<br />
<br />
Darren coughed, noticing the taste of blood in his mouth. His body ached, his vision unfocused. As he tried to focus he now saw Evan face Yuriko, Akira, and Ayami.<br />
<br />
Akira was the first to fall, which amazed Darren. The kitsune warrior had appeared above Evan, looking to behead the man. Instead Akira passed through him as if he were mist. Evan took that moment to blast Akira through the wall of the house. Ayami followed as she screeched in rage. Looking to avenge her husband she propelled herself forward looking to punch Evans head off. Evan simply caught her arm, slamming her into the ground where she lay unconscious.<br />
<br />
Yurikk was the last, engaging in magical combat with the would be Catalyst. Altbkugh more skilled and perhaps more powerful, she also tired more quickly. In moments Evan had knocked her to the ground, the elderly wizard now struggling to stand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay down Yuki,&quot; Evan yelled. &quot;Or you&#39;ll be joining my mom.&quot; Evan now turned to Darren, furrowing his brow at the young teen. &quot;You put up a good fight kid but its over. Now hand them over.&quot;<br />
<br />
A crack like thunder now rang out, a flash knocking Evan backwards. As he now tried to gain his bearings he sighed. Tatsu, the kitsune lord, Tricia and Matt the Dragon king and Queen, and a small army of fairies stood between him and Darren. <br />
<br />
&quot;Leave at once,&quot; Tatsu growled, his hand tightening on the hilt of his katana.<br />
<br />
Evan sighed, the cavalry had already shown up. The longer he stayed the more allies would arrive. As powerful as he was even he couldn&#39;t take on the armies of the kitsune, dragons, and fairies combine. Evan now glanced towards Darren, narrowing his eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Save yourself the headache kid,&quot; he said. &quot;Renounce your standing as the Catalyst or you&#39;ll find out what a Catalyst killer can do.&quot; Without another word, Evan vanished leaving Darren with much to think about.</p>
