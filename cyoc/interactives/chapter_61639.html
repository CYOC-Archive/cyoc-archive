<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff walked into the locker room and immediately noticed that something was different. The lockers and shower space seemed a lot more open <br />
and Jeff could see the entire shower area from his locker. He happened to be early so he detoured to ask the coach, &quot;How'd they remodel the <br />
locker room so fast?&quot;<br />
<br />
The coach said, &quot;They didn't. I don't know what happened. I woke up this morning and something was different. I've noticed several changes all <br />
day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;Like what?&quot;<br />
<br />
The coach said, &quot;You probably didn't catch the news this morning. Several companies announced out of the blue that they were going to shut <br />
down all their foreign facilities and going to reopen facilities back here in the United States in order to help reduce American unemployment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;That's great. My dad has been out of work and we've been struggling to keep up with the bills.&quot;<br />
<br />
The coach said, &quot;I know. Most of the changes I've noticed have been good changes but still unbelievable. I even saw changes that defied <br />
science. I saw cars transform into fuel efficient vehicles.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;You're kidding.&quot;<br />
<br />
The coach said, &quot;No, I'm serious. Some sort of radical force has been striking randomly across the country and if I didn't know better, I would <br />
say that the entire country is undergoing some form of magical transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I don't believe you. Somehow you remodeled the locker room just so you could pull some sort of prank on us. Where's the camera?&quot;<br />
<br />
The coach said, &quot;I'm serious. I'm sure you'll realize I'm right after you see some more changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Yea, right.&quot; and headed back to the locker room. Several of the other guys were there now and they were all talking about changes <br />
they noticed.<br />
<br />
Terry said, &quot;I'm serious. I'm not gay anymore. I woke up and looked at some of my gay porn and wasn't turned on at all. I couldn't even <br />
remember why I had ever been attracted to men in the first place. I'm freaking out about having such an overnight change.&quot;<br />
<br />
John said, &quot;You're freaking out. I just told Cindy how I've been cheating on her with Cathy for months. I have no idea what came over me and <br />
made me be so bluntly honest. I'm going to suffer now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at the man that walked in and didn't recognize him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chubby, is that you?&quot; Roger asked.<br />
<br />
Chubby said, &quot;Not anymore. I woke up this morning in a completely different body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked closer and realized that it was Chubby. Only Chubby wasn't chubby. He still had the same face but he was taller, skinnier and more <br />
muscular. He looked like a model.<br />
<br />
Jeff asked, &quot;What is going on? What's causing all these changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
John said, &quot;I wish I knew. I'm scared to find out what is going to change next.&quot;<br />
<br />
They continued to talk as they changed for P.E. They noticed that all of them had undergone physical improvements. The smaller guys were <br />
bigger. The weaker guys had more muscle. Even some health problems had mysteriously healed. Jake was still using crutches because of his <br />
broken leg but there was no longer any scar tissue on Jason's leg where he had cut himself with a chainsaw. Every single one of them was now <br />
a model of fitness for the most part.<br />
<br />
When they went to exercise, they got another surprise. The coach acted almost militant like a drill sergeant ordering them through exercises.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what gives, coach?&quot; Jeff asked, &quot;You're tough but you're not usually this tough.&quot;<br />
<br />
The coach said, &quot;I don't know why but I can't help myself. Something is compelling me to shape you into the best of men.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason interrupted, &quot;Hey, have you guys noticed that not one of us has used a dirty word. Whatever is transforming the country has caused <br />
changes to our minds as well. I can't even think of sex with a girl without thinking about words like respect and consider her feelings. I'm <br />
turning into a decent gentleman.&quot;<br />
<br />
They finished exercising and headed back to the locker room. There were more changes to the locker room. The school now had a jacuzzi and <br />
sauna inside the men's locker room and a swimming pool.<br />
<br />
Chubby, who was no longer chubby, said, &quot;Swimming sounds like such a good idea. I've got time before my next class. Would it be okay to use <br />
the pool.&quot;<br />
<br />
The coach said, &quot;I guess it's okay. I haven't heard of any rules against it. Of course, we didn't even have a pool an hour ago. Go ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger said, &quot;I'll come with you except I didn't bring a swimsuit.&quot;<br />
<br />
The coach said, &quot;That's okay. In fact, I feel a compulsion to tell you that swimsuits are no longer allowed and not just here. I've got this strong <br />
feeling that across the entire country, swimsuits are being banned from all swimming pools.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chubby and Roger hesitated but then stripped and headed for the pool. On the way, Roger announced, &quot;Hey, all my tattoos are gone. I saved <br />
up a lot of money to get those tattoos and now they're all gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the locker room, Jason said, &quot;My tongue piercing is also gone and the hole is sealed up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff, Terry, John, Jason and some of the other guys began showering. Then suddenly Jeff felt hands on his body. &quot;Hey, Terry, I thought you said <br />
you weren't gay anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry said, &quot;I'm not. It's strange as I used to have sexual fantasies about being able to wash you but here I'm compelled to wash you by magic <br />
and I don't feel anything sexual.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff then noticed that John and Jason were washing each other and he noticed his own urge to help wash Terry. Jeff said, &quot;This is freakin weird. I <br />
feel like washing you too but you're right. I don't feel anything sexual about it. Instead, it feels like a duty. It feels like a job or like I'm in the <br />
military and I've been ordered to wash you. I don't want to wash you but I feel compelled to fulfill my duty and responsibility by washing you.&quot;<br />
<br />
They finished up and got dressed. They had all started walking with better posture and moving with military precision. They didn't slouch or <br />
stroll anymore. They walked with dignity.<br />
<br />
Jeff found more surprises when he went to his next class which used to be a business economics class but after the changes to the rest of the <br />
country, this class now taught business ethics.<br />
<br />
With everyone Jeff spoke with, he got the same impression. Everyone was surprised and confused by all the recent changes. There were some <br />
complaints but not very many. Somehow, along with the changes came mental changes to help everyone except that the new way was better.<br />
<br />
Jeff himself felt that way too. Although it took a bit to get used to these feelings of duty and responsibility to the point of self-sacrifice and he <br />
was still amazed about how he had just washed Terry in the shower, somehow Jeff felt like everything was still alright in the world. He even had <br />
this idea repeating itself over and over in his mind that he was now one of the best of men.<br />
<br />
