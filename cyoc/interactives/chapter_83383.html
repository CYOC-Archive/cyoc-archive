<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie and Katie made their way to the bar as they sat on the counter waiting for the bartender.  Katie looked to her former mother and was amazed at how much she has changed.  Yesterday when she got the ring, she used it on her mother to make her feel less strict.  But now, she turned her into a complete free spirit without a care in the world.  She never really thought that was going to happen.  But on the plus side, she liked her as a sister more then a mother.  Plus she’s much cooler then before.  So maybe Katie will have a better life with her.  But the day is still early and she has to see where this is going.<br />
<br />
As she was thinking about it, the bartender came in and ask for their orders.  “What can I get you two?”  Kellie looked to the bartender and said, “I’ll have a Budlight for me and a Pepsi for my young sister.”  Katie looked at her and thought to herself, “Yep.  It’s official.  She’s really my sister.”  “Do you have any ID?” the bartender said.  Kellie went to her purse and dig out her wallet, taking her ID card out.  “Here you go.” she said with a pleasing smile.  The bartender took the drivers license and took a good look at it.  Looking back and forth, he smirked and shook his head.  “Sorry babe,” he said, “But I’m not going to give you a drink with a fake ID.”  Kellie was bewildered about it as she argued back, “What?!  I’m not trying to cheat my way into getting some beer?  That is a REAL ID I got there and it’s really legit.”  But the bartender shook his head and explained the ID she was holding.  “Really?” he said, “Cause according to this ID it said that you are in your forties when in reality you’re in the mid twenties.  And the picture on your ID doesn’t do any justice since you look far younger then the photo here.  So long story short, you’re not going to get any beer with this card.  But don’t worry doll; I’ll get you some water instead.”<br />
<br />
He then gave her card back to her and went to get the drinks.  Kellie though slouched with her elbows to the counter and groaned.  “That’s just my luck.” she said, “First the guy at the liquor store couldn’t give me beer and now this guy.  All this because of what?  That they think my ID is a fake???  That’s it!  When I get back, I’m going to get a new ID card for myself.”  As soon as she said that, she heard a voice from behind.  “Having trouble down there sweetheart?”  She turned back to see a woman of 64 with a sundress and a sunhat on top of his gray hair.  Kellie smiled and explained to the woman, “Yeah…  I’ve been rejected for a drink twice due to this stupid ID.  And all I wanted is a beer.”  The woman laughed a little and decided to help her out.  “All that’s so sad…” she said, “But I think I can help you with that.  We got some frozen margaritas in the cooler if you like one.”  Kellie heard this and had a smile on her face the same time the bartender came back with a glass of water and a Pepsi.  Hearing something like that, she turned to her young sister and said, “Come Katie, Margaritas awaits.”<br />
<br />
Soon enough, she grabbed the drinks and headed to the table with Katie soon following behind.  The moment they reached the table with the women, the one that was talking to her handed her a glass and poured a margarita from the canister.  “Here you go.” the woman said, “Enjoy!”  Kellie took a seat with the two drinks on the table while Katie sat next to her big sister.  The moment Kellie took a sip of her margarita; she was eye wide and was in heaven.  Turning to the woman, she said, “Thanks for the drink.  It was really worth it Ms…”  “Oh it’s Mary sweetheart, Mary Elyse.” Replied the woman who is named Mary, “These are my friends, Claudia, Tricia, Samantha, and Mika.”  Kellie looked at the four other women and could tell that they were close friends.  Claudia is a 62-year-old woman with gray and white streak hair that’s tied up in a bun and was wearing a summer like robe for the beach.  Tricia was a black woman of sixty-five with frizzled gray hair and wearing a fitting mumu over around her puffy hips sagging D cup breasts.  Next was Samantha with tanned freckled skin and long gray hair with a white streak on her side wore a one-piece black swimsuit to cover up her withered body.  Lastly, there was a Japanese girl named Mika with a thin and barely frail body with short gray hair in a buzz cut and was wearing a long flowing long beach dress.<br />
<br />
Kellie looked at the four and waved to them, saying “Hi there.  I’m Kellie by the way.  This is my little sister, Katie.”  Katie looked to the women and waved, saying, “Hi there!”  All the women looked to her and her young sister and waved back with their own, “Hello.”  Then Mary came in and said, “All of us our having our little get together today.  We’ve been friends since high school and we thought that a little reunion is in order.  And look at this location, the beach is excellent on a weekdays since no one rally comes here.”  Kellie looked to the empty beach to see nothing but a group of forty-year-old people sun bathing while one person was fishing on the pier.  “Yeah…  I could really see that.” she said, stating the obvious.  Mary then looked to the beach and remembered about the old times.  “This beach really brings back memories.  All of us use to have been your age at the time and we were the center of attention.  We’ve always worn bikinis that are hot in the day and forced the men on that beach to drool.  Aw, those were the days.  A shame that we no longer have the bodies we had and are now nothing but old women.  But you know what, at least we had a great run.  Right ladies?”  All the women looked to her and nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
As they were talking Katie overheard Mary and felt sad for her.  She and her friends use to be the center of attention until they grew old and withered.  She wished that she would fix them and change them back to the way they were.  That’s when she remembered about the ring she still has on her finger.  If she can regress them to Kellie’s age, then they would relive their lives as sexy women.  But how would she approach it?  She should change them all into young college women, but maybe she should test out on one of them.  What should she do?</p>
