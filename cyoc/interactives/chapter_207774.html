<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake<br />
Jake got back to his class. The period had almost passed. Sparky was spent from their endeavour and now much less interested in his new mate. Being spent Sparky went back to his owner who was just finishing her class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah there you are. I was wondering where you had gone of to. I hoped you would have gotten back sooner. You missed most of the class! I appreciate your help but please be a bit faster next time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry ma&#39;am Sparky really had a lot of packed up energy&quot; Jake scratched behind his ears, his face a bit red. The Scrathing felt oddly good.<br />
<br />
The bell rang. &quot;Well you better get going. Maybe you will pick up more next period.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jack watched as the classroom emptied. All his classmates looked really hot. Still it was hard to not compare them to his new experiences. A human could never make him feel like Sparky just had. Thinking back made his 8 ich penis crawl a bit out of his sheath. It now hang half soft in his newly acquired cargo pants.<br />
<br />
Jake was with his head in the clouds. He picked up his backpack with his books and went to the next period.<br />
<br />
Jenn<br />
Jennifer was still shocked to have seen her boyfriend like that. Was he really such a pervert? She was on her way to the school library. She had to do some research for a school project. <br />
<br />
It was not long before she saw that freak Kyle. He was stalking around the corner. It was almost like he was following someone. Jen knew better then to associate with someone like hi.. Kyle was not only a nerd. He was a creep. He thought he was the best. Everything that happened to him was unfair and he thought he deserved better because he was a &quot;nice guy&quot;. Kyle did not seem to have any friends. It is like he was detached from others his age.<br />
<br />
Jennifer reached the library. She opened her laptop and went to work. Jenn could not concentrate on her project. Her thought kept going back to what she had seen. Almost without thought she began to to type her concerns I to the search engine. <br />
<br />
&quot;Weird behaviour boyfriend&quot; <br />
<br />
The results were very generic. Some sited blaming medical problems. Some social media that was only being used to vent frustration etc. There was one more interesting search result.<br />
This link went to a page about old local stories.<br />
One story was about the local transform or dare curse. <br />
<br />
The story gave an oddly detailed report of an former victim of the curse. The curse was used in a man named Barry. Barry had slowly lost his muscle and athletic ability. The curse had striped him of overything he was proud off. His peniss had even shrunk. It had gone from a respected 7 inch slowly swiveling down to 5 then 3 and then eventually 1 inch. He did claim that his balls had not shrunk but even gotten bigger. The curse had doenthis to emphasise how small his junk was. Barry was now curved to forever number a meagre small weak teen who would always attract bullies. No-one would even notice that he always stayed in the same class and never aged. His live in a complete  limbo.<br />
<br />
This was all nonsense of course. Such a thing as a curse did not exist.<br />
<br />
Jake<br />
Jake was going to his next class. He had gym now. On the way there he kept letting distracted. His 8 inch penis was now fully out of his sheath and making a bulge in his pants. The hall was crowded. Jake kept letting stares as people held their noses up. Did he really stink this bad?<br />
<br />
Jkae hoped he would get through gym without incident.</p>
