<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The calm, knowing smile on Tina&#39;s face told Leah everything she needed to know, that somehow this was all her doing. Gritting her teeth as she pushed another log into her diaper, she was about to blow up the the older lady. However, Tina simply put a finger to her lips and &#39;shhh&#39;ed. Whatever words Leah might&#39;ve had died in her throat as she found herself shutting herself up. A little perturbed by the strange sensation, she couldn&#39;t react before Tina was leaning down in front of her with a teasing grin, <br />
&quot;Baby Leah needs to wakey bakey.&quot; She said in a sing song voice. Before even being able to react to the bizarre words, Leah felt a sudden and overwhelming...headache? Light headedness? It was like when one stands up from a couch after a while and feels blood rush to their head, except 1000x times stranger. She couldn&#39;t even get out a word of alarm before Tina shoved something into her mouth. It took her a few seconds to realize it was a pacifier, and a few seconds more to realize she was sucking on it.<br />
&quot;Now stay right here, and only speak when spoken to, okay baby?&quot; Tina asked in a soft voice. Despite that, her words felt powerful, wracking through the girl&#39;s brain. <br />
&quot;O-otay mommy?&quot; She responded as best she could around the pacifier she was STILL sucking, and...did she just call her mommy? Satisfied, Tina stood back up and turned to Rita, while Leah...was rooted to the spot. She wanted to run up to the woman and ask her what the heck was going on, but she just...couldn&#39;t. She was helpless to do anything other than stand there, sucking her pacifier. A rippling fart informed her that she was STILL pooping, though something about that also felt off. Did...she not notice herself pooping until she farted? <br />
&quot;So this is little Leah, huh? You weren&#39;t kidding about your kid being a lil&#39; stinker.&quot; Rita commented, half in jest and half in barely disguised disgust. Your kid? Stinker? Wasn&#39;t Rita supposed to know she&#39;s Tina&#39;s teen step-daughter? The sheer scale of the trap she fell into was starting to become apparent.<br />
&quot;Oh yes, so sorry to put her in your hands.&quot; She said with faux humility. Rita waved her hand in dismissal (and probably to covertly wave away the stench). <br />
&quot;Oh, shush. You know I love kids, stinky diapers and all.&quot; She responded, once again referencing Leah&#39;s mess. To her surprise, she doesn&#39;t feel further embarrassment...but a hint of pride? In fact, she doesn&#39;t feel shame at all. She&#39;s still VERY concerned that her potty training seemed to be diminished, if not out right gone, but she no longer feels the overwhelming fear of judgement she did moments ago. What the hell did Tina do to her?<br />
&quot;Well, Leah, aren&#39;t you going to say hi?&quot; Tina asked, giving her that same knowing smile that made her feel...some kind of way? What that feeling was, she wasn&#39;t sure yet.<br />
&quot;H-hi.&quot; She awkwardly greeted between grunts, giving a half-hearted little wave. She probably should&#39;ve asked Tina questions when she could finally speak, but...she didn&#39;t. Whenever Tina asked her something, she felt she just...kinda had to do it. <br />
&quot;Oh, how adorable!&quot; Rita squealed.<br />
&quot;Absolutely precious.&quot; Tina said with a patronizing tone, making Leah feel...that certain way again (what WAS that feeling). &quot;Now Leah, tell us how old you are.&quot;<br />
&quot;Two.&quot; Leah immediately responded and...why did she say that? It felt so natural to say, that she almost didn&#39;t catch it. Was this some kind of hypnosis? She remembers Tina playing some weird music on the car ride over, and that the journey feel short despite being quite a lengthy drive. It&#39;s weird in hindsight, sure, but...is that really enough to have this massive of an effect on her? Not that she can really contest, giving that she&#39;s acting the way she is.<br />
&quot;Oh, she knows her own age?&quot; <br />
&quot;The words, at least. She&#39;s hasn&#39;t learned how to count yet, but she has a surprisingly large vocabulary.&quot; Tina explained, watching Leah&#39;s reaction carefully. What did she mean by that? She can count fine! One, two...two. Leah&#39;s brain goes blank as she tries to think of what comes next. Can she...really not count? She looks to her fingers in desperation, trying to count them. She has slightly more success, but never gets higher than five. All her understanding of numbers is just...gone. She sucks her pacifier harder, groan of disbelief transitioning into another grunt as she continues to push a particularly bulky log out. <br />
&quot;Alright, Leah, look at me.&quot; Tina requested. The girl meets her stepmother&#39;s eyes, a growing fear truly starting to take root, &quot;Rita will be your caretaker for the week, so as you do everything I say, you will do everything she says. Okay, baby?&quot; Once again, that strange lightheadedness goes through her.<br />
&quot;O-otay, mo-mo-mommy.&quot; She responded, this time catching it to at least stutter. Her tongue felt like lead in her mouth, and she had a feeling that even without the pacifier muffling her words she&#39;d still sound like a baby. Still, calling that woman &#39;mommy&#39; left a rather bitter taste in her mouth.<br />
&quot;Sounds good.&quot; Tina responded, turning back to Rita, &quot;Now, no need to worry about potty training  or anything. Just...let her be a baby for a week. Pamper her, treat her, the like. She&#39;s been having a rough time, and she deserves it.&quot; Leah blinked several times at that. She was somehow surprised the most by that. What...what is Tina&#39;s intention here? Rita gives a nod of understanding, reaching down to give Leah a little cheek pinch (and unsubtly cover her nose) before grabbing her bags and going inside. Finally alone, Tina leans down next to Leah.<br />
&quot;Go ahead and finish up.&quot; She commanded. Leah deepened her squat, scrunched her face, and pushed as hard as her body could. The tiny explosion of poops and farts luckily lasted only a couple seconds before it was finally done, petering off with one last squeaky toot. She let out a desperate sigh of relief, only now fully understanding just how much pain she was in.<br />
&quot;Goodness, if I had known you&#39;d react that strongly to that laxative I put in your breakfast I would&#39;ve used something weaker. Still, the fact that you couldn&#39;t feel it, or release it, until you left the car should get the point across.&quot; Tina casually mentioned, as if this were just a regular conversation with her step-daughter. Leah sucked her pacifier intensely, eyeing the woman wearily. She was at Tina&#39;s complete mercy, and there was nothing Leah could do about it.<br />
&quot;Alright, I&#39;m sure you have questions. You can speak and move freely.&quot; She said with a sigh. Immediately, Leah ripped out the pacifier.<br />
&quot;Mommy, wha da hewl!&quot; She shouted. As she guessed, her speech sounded much more infantile, but the &#39;hell&#39; came across clearly. To Leah&#39;s surprise, Tina started to laugh.<br />
&quot;Oh, never change Leah. I would warn against using that language with Rita, though. I won&#39;t restrict your speech outside of telling others you&#39;re anything but a toddler, but I can&#39;t say anything for consequences you&#39;ll face with her.&quot; Once again, Tina has that smile. This time, however, it&#39;s more warm than playful. &quot;Then again, I really can&#39;t say. Rita having a unique view on child development wasn&#39;t a lie, you could honestly say anything to her and she wouldn&#39;t think-&quot;<br />
&quot;What did you do ta me?&quot; Leah interrupted, more than a little anger present in her voice, but mostly fear. Part of her wanted to go and strangle the woman, but she knew one word was all it would take to stop it. Tina cleared her throat, her confidence waning ever so slightly.<br />
&quot;Well, I hypnotized you. A little hobby of mine that I got scarily good at, as you can see.&quot; She said with a chuckle. Seeing Leah was still staring at her with horror, her chuckle died. &quot;Right. So, you&#39;re under two different commands. One, as I assume you guessed, is just pure obedience. I tell you something, you do it. And don&#39;t worry, none of this is permanent. I&#39;ll lift it at the end of the week, I promise.&quot;<br />
&quot;But why? Why aw ya doing dis ta me?&quot; Leah choked out desperately, shifting her stance in discomfort at her incredibly full diaper.<br />
&quot;Well, that has to do with the second command. Basically, you&#39;re a baby now. You&#39;re no longer potty trained, or feel shame about using a diaper. You&#39;re movement is stilted, you can no longer read or count, you&#39;ll feel compelled to suck your thumb, I think you&#39;ll start to drool?You can&#39;t feed yourself, dress yourself, clean yourself, change yourself-&quot;<br />
&quot;Wha-wha-wha da hewl!?&quot; Leah screamed. How else was she supposed to react to Tina listing all the skills robbed from her like it&#39;s a chore list?<br />
&quot;Hey, hey, calm down!&quot; Tina responded in alarm. Immediately Leah felt her demeanor slacken. &quot;Wait, shoot, didn&#39;t mean to command that. You&#39;re free, just...try and hear me out first, okay? I know this seems scary, but I promise I&#39;m not intent on punishing or harming you.&quot;<br />
Leah felt her body return to it&#39;s proper state and crossed her arms.<br />
&quot;I don weally hav a choice anyways, mo...mo...Tina.&quot; Leah deadpanned, making sure to emphasize the woman&#39;s name. <br />
&quot;Nope!&quot; Tina said cheerfully, &quot;And wow, look at you! Didn&#39;t know you could overpower that. Have to say, I&#39;m a little hurt you don&#39;t want to call me-&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not my mom.&quot; The words came out clear, dripping with venom. Leah felt that bitterness return, a far more angry sadness building behind her eyes as she looked away, &quot;My mommy is gone, an you arn&#39;t her.&quot;<br />
She could see Tina&#39;s face immediately drop, giving her a hint of satisfaction.<br />
&quot;I...know. And I&#39;m sorry. You don&#39;t have to call me or any one mommy if you don&#39;t want to. I just...I don&#39;t know why you wanted to be a toddler that day at the store, but I also know you&#39;re stubborn. If you wanted to be a baby, you&#39;d never come out and say it. Someone would have to force you into it. And, well...here we are. You are now forced to be a baby for a week.&quot;<br />
Though her confidence was gone, Tina still had a smile on her face. Leah&#39;s eyes narrowed.<br />
&quot;Tina...dis is stupid. I don&#39;t wanna be a baby fo a week.&quot;<br />
&quot;Look, just...let yourself enjoy the week. be entirely carefree without anyone to watch or judge. And if you hate it that much?&quot; Tina paused, her face growing worried for a second before she let&#39;s out a large breath. &quot;I&#39;ll make it up to you by...by letting you hypnotize me the same way. Break lasts for a month, so when we get back...you get me as an obedient baby for the month. You can put every indignity you felt onto me ten-fold.&quot;<br />
Leah&#39;s jaw dropped. Having Tina do anything she says? That sounded almost too good to be true. <br />
&quot;You pwomise?&quot;<br />
&quot;I promise.&quot;<br />
Leah realized that Tina did not have to. If she wanted, she could keep Leah as an obedient little puppet as long as she likes. However, part of Leah wants to trust Tina. That, and the thought of seeing the mature woman filling a diaper after all she&#39;s experienced sounds too good to pass up.<br />
&quot;Whelp, with that out of the way, I hope you can enjoy the week,&quot; Tina says as she stands up, giving Leah that playful smile again, &quot;Afterall, you don&#39;t have a choice.&quot; She winks, making Leah once again feel...what was that feeling? <br />
&quot;Now get in there, get that diaper changed, and try and enjoy the week. Bye honey!&quot; And with that, Leah found herself walking into the house. Rita looked to just be coming back, a smile crossing her lips.<br />
&quot;Ah, let&#39;s get that diaper changed, alright? Then let&#39;s have some fun.&quot; Leah let out an &#39;eek&#39; as the woman picked her up. She guessed she was going to have to get used to that. While the woman put her down to change, Leah let her situation sink in. She was now, for all intents and purposes, a complete baby. She couldn&#39;t even try and tell people she&#39;s a teen, if it were at all effective. In addition, she&#39;s completely obedient to Rita. For the next week, she&#39;ll HAVE to live as a baby, having her aunt do everything for her. Among that was the feeling she got every time Tina gave her that smile. Finally, Leah came to a consensus on how she feels, and that&#39;s...</p>
