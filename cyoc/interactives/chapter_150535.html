<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marie&#39;s Perspective:<br />
<br />
&quot;Just one more quest.&quot; Marie lied to herself as naturally as she breathed. So late in the evening as always, she kept her lights off all day anyways. The only time she&#39;d turn them on was to find the next game in her line-up. Of course as most would expect of a gamer of her stature, her backlog was unclear-able. However, she prided herself in that it didn&#39;t outweigh her completion record. Her current task was to finish a Fantasy Game benignly named Elven Knight Princess, it didn&#39;t win any awards for its name but, it was a hidden gem nonetheless. She had just made it to the final boss and had to make the choice of losing for the Bad End or winning to get the Good End first. With fatigue wearing at her again and the boss&#39;s multiple bars of health, she opted for the Bad End first. She watched as her character stood in its horribly ineffective armor and got destroyed by the boss. She&#39;d come back to it later on anyway. <br />
<br />
The main draw to the game was the multiple endings as one might expect but, it wasn&#39;t a game to play with friends. With the =BAD END= screen fading away, the screen faded into the Boss walking toward the fallen princess. &quot;You&#39;ve come so far only to fall before me.&quot; The Boss was your standard fare, suave ancient vampire determined to rule the kingdom. He approached the princess pulling her up by a firm grip on her neck. Marie watched with enraptured anticipation having gotten every bad end thus far, she knew what was coming next. The Boss tore free the armored bikini top snatching a breast in a careless, clawed grip. A yelp of pain and a clatter of armor as the bikini bottom was flung across the floor. The screen flashed and the princess was thrust onto the boss&#39;s large dick repeatedly. Another quick cut and a howl of pleasure from the princess as she released mid-stroke. The next scene was the Boss drinking deep from her neck while she was too numbed to move. At last, the final scene showed the turned princess marching toward the castle as the boss&#39;s side not even bothering to replace the lost armor. =GAME OVER= -Continue?- (Quit?) Marie found herself moist from the affair but, not wet. She&#39;d pick it up again later as she turned off the Television to curl up.<br />
<br />
The morning went by like most did as a blur of blended exhausted memories. Lily woke her up and Marie went to the table to eat breakfast with Lily, Eve, Naomi, and Eliza. When they finished she was about to leave the table when Naomi produced a gorgeous and expensive looking figure. So tired as she was, it didn&#39;t stop her from noticing the attention to detail as Naomi pulled down the lower garments revealing it to everyone. Lily darted back to her room like a rabbit to its den. Naomi, while she laughed said it was for her and not Lily after all. Marie snatched the figurine off of the table with a deftness of one accustomed to handling such things in a furtive manner and left to her room. She sat the figurine on the desk in her room and with a casual sniff realized how badly she smelled this morning. Determined to get a shower, she shew her clothes to the floor and made for the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Feeling the door unlocked, she put on her best exhausted act and strode inside. She even fumbled with locking the door as if she was unaware of Eliza. She could only pull this act a few times a month or they might start to get suspicious. If she&#39;d had her choice, she&#39;d have snuck in on Eve rather than Eliza but, she really was tired enough that either would do. She stepped in the shower behind Eliza and wobbled before leaning into her, pressing her high A cups into her back, and groping Eliza&#39;s modest B cups. A smirk played on her lips knowing that her act was good enough to get away with it. Sure enough, Eliza switched places with her to wash Marie down first. <br />
<br />
Marie wasn&#39;t sure what came over her at that point, as she leaned into Eliza hard enough to knock the two of them down. She landed on Eliza whose leg had pressed firmly against her vagina lips. Oh how it burned with a need for release, so she took the opportunity readily. Sliding her sex up and down Eliza&#39;s leg, she felt hotter than she did in the beginning, it was getting worse with each stroke. Slowly Marie began furtively rubbing her clit along Eliza&#39;s knee selectively. Her soft moans nearly muffled by the running water as she thrust herself faster and faster. Not much longer than she started she stroked one final time freezing up and then releasing down Eliza&#39;s leg. Feeling relieved and more amazing than ever, she laid out on top Eliza falling into a deep sleep. <br />
<br />
When Marie awoke it was time for dinner, the smell alone was what arose her consciousness. She sat up from her soaked sheets with a grimace, she hadn&#39;t bothered to dry herself off after her half asleep shower.  With a soft grumble toward the situation, she got dressed and made for the table. With a keen eye for the out of place, she spotted the ball on the counter right away. She scooped it up and looked it over as she walked to the table. It had the feel of a stress ball but, the design was wild in comparison. The main draw was the life size vagina running down the center and oh was it detailed. She felt the soft ridges and the two small dimples for the holes inside. Of course she gave the clit a little work, why shouldn&#39;t she? Just below the mock vagina was a larger dimple for the asshole and above were two nubs almost as big as the clit designed to be breasts with tiny nipples.<br />
<br />
Knowing how Eve felt about her collections, she set it on her lap while they ate. Seemed the apt place for it while she didn&#39;t have any pockets. Eve insisted that the three of them ate together at the table for each meal. Marie would rather eat while she played her games but, she let it be for Eve&#39;s sake. Lily sat to Eve&#39;s right and Marie to her left, the tall woman&#39;s legs stretched out between the two of them. She ate quickly so she could get to her evening&#39;s work and left cupping the ball in had with a few subconscious squeezes. Once back in her room, she actually turned on her light. There on her desk was a limited edition figure for one of the games in her backlog to inspect.<br />
<br />
The figurine on her desk was wearing the usual school girl outfit in a pose as if she were jumping to cheer. She spun it around with her free hand as she massaged and squeezed the ball in the other. Now for the fun part she thought as she started with the figurines top, a small zipper pulled across and the top fell off onto the base. She stared for a moment seeing that they even included a tiny blue bra, interesting... but, not enough for Marie&#39;s curiosity. Off came the bra which had tiny clips and revealed the large breasts hidden beneath, she rubbed the breasts her free hand feeling the dull points of the tiny nipples with her thumb. So far, she was quite impressed with the details that she found. <br />
<br />
All while she explored the figurine, she rubbed and squeezed the stress ball in so many ways. A pinch on the clit, a finger tip directed into the anus, strokes along the vaginal lips, and an ocassional squish of the breasts. She paused in her inspection of the figurine only for a moment as she looked at the ball. It must&#39;ve had a small leak in it because the ball shined in a slickness it hadn&#39;t before. Her imagination had gotten the better of her or she&#39;d have sworn the clit and even the breast nubs felt just a bit more firm. Setting the ball on the desk as to not cause whatever leak to get worse, she turned back to the figurine. <br />
<br />
Next on her private little strip show was the removal of the skirt, which had clips like the bra, fell to the base. Unexpectedly, the panties matched the bra but were not show panties. The panties looked like silk bedroom panties hiding just enough to be tantalizing. Marie&#39;s curiosity not the only thing being aroused, she pulled them down to the knees as the one raised leg wouldn&#39;t allow them to come off. Feeling disappointed about the circumstance, she instead focused on the allure of having them being part of the whole picture. With the last obstacle out of the way she inspected the main event. The figurine&#39;s vagina was superbly detailed she could see the heart shaped fuzz, the swollen lips, and stiff clit perfectly. As she turned it in the light ever so slightly, she noted that it glistened as if freshly wet. Not bothering to stop herself she picked up the figurine and gave the vagina a gentle flick with the tip of her tongue. She pulled back setting the figurine down once more with a lustful face. Sometimes she&#39;d dreamed of being able to have her way with characters personally.<br />
<br />
She sat back down on her bed leaving the light on to see the full glory of the figurine stripped as it was. She turned on her game system to pick up where she left off the night before. As it booted up, she heard Lily&#39;s door shut and a yelp of surprise. Mildly she thought to herself. &quot;Wow, I never expected Eve to be so bold.&quot; She turned up the game to give them a bit of privacy while she finished her game. While the victory music played from the ending of the Boss Battle, she heard Lily howl in pleasure. Marie just shook her head wishing that her roommate would have a little more consideration with her private sessions. Lily always acted shy around other people but, in her bedroom she was a whole different person some nights. <br />
<br />
Hours whiled by and Marie looked through her game log at past achievements. &quot;100%&quot; showed for every game she left saved, with a wistful sigh the wish she made came to the forefront. &quot;Playing video games, all day, without needing to go anywhere.&quot; If only she could, she knew once this time in the College was up she&#39;d be thrust into life with no time to spare anymore. As she thought about life past the now, she hadn&#39;t noticed the system had gone into sleep mode. She pressed a few buttons on the controller to wake it up and saw the tv blue screen. As she leaned forward to get up for a reset, she felt a sense of vertigo as if the room rushed past her and everything went black. A moment later the darkness cleared from her eyes and she couldn&#39;t believe what she saw. There on the bed was herself with a blank expression sat up just as she had been. <br />
<br />
Taking a step forward she walked into an invisible barrier of some sort, she banged on it with her fists hearing a dull thud from each blow. It was at this time she noticed the lack of sleeves on her arms and then her lack of clothes period. Whatever had just happened to her had stripped her down and yet left her behind somehow. She thought hard about what was going on as she saw a shadowed figure appear behind the other her. While she watched her doubles clothes just fade away the revelation struck her with a vengeance. That on the other side was her real body and wherever she was now was her soul, maybe? In either case, she saw that the figure was looking directly at her with a catlike grin as its hands worked at her body.<br />
<br />
Slowly the figure had massaged away her arms and legs as if tenderly working with clay. The most terrifying part was when her head, chest and waist separated from one another. First of the parts to be picked up and molded was her head, the figure gently rubbed and flattened it down to a thin featureless rectangle split by her once mouth. Next along in the macabre line up was her chest which was slowly whittled down in size, this time she could make out what had been crafted. Especially since the figure took the time to display it to her, it was a peach colored controller like the one she had been holding. There was differences to it however, it had soft grips and the toggles were nothing more than stiff nipples. When the figure picked up the waist, she had a good idea what was coming next. As before with the head it was shaped into a rectangle but, this time thick enough to feature her whole vagina on the front of it. <br />
<br />
With the transformation of her body apparently finished she watched the figure step forward and unplug her game system. This gave her enough perspective to look around to gather where she was. Off to one side was the stress ball and the figurine... She had been sucked into her TV while all of this happened to her. Her attention turned back to the figure who just stuck the plug from her system into the asshole on the back of the rectangle, reflexively she clenched her ass as if she felt it go inside. Strangely, when the figure pressed on her old clit it glowed a dull red and a disc was selected and slid inside her vagina. The whir of the disc sliding in was replaced be a long drawn out moan in her own voice. There was a sudden music and a burst of color, Marie turned to see four nude women approaching her. One of the women looked exactly like the figurine on her desk, something was terribly wrong about that. Just as the women reached her, they grabbed onto her and posed staring lustfully forward. Marie only felt one thing as she saw the figure waving at her, terror and then the disc was slid out of the vagina once more. <br />
<br />
The figure smiled as she took the disc over to the bed where she had left the case for it. On the case was five varying women all staring out with lust under the title &quot;Roommate Relations&quot;. Underneath the tallest&#39;s arm was a black silhouette with the word &quot;YOU&quot;. Admiring her grueling work with this transformation she&#39;d never done before, the figure went about erasing the signs this had been a bedroom replacing the bed at last with a recliner. The gameroom finished, she swept her brow with her arm and sauntered into nothing. &quot;One more wish left...&quot;</p>
