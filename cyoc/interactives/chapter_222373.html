<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was absolutely spellbound by the nymph lounging in front of him. Her perfect, womanly curves, her confidence in her insurmountable power. She oozed seduction, her mere presence twisting the minds of men to serve, and currently Jeff was on the receiving end of her undivided attention. Venus giggled as her pheromones saturated the air and twisted Jeffs devotion to her into an obsession, just like she wanted. Jeff was her life, her love. She had to eradicate any possibility of someone else taking him from her.<br />
<br />
In a trance-like state he took his first steps towards the goddess, wordlessly beckoned by her beauty. She just sat there, leaking nectar that fueled the growth of ever more brilliant flowers, feeding the earth with her power as the planet finished binding itself to its new mistress. This hypnotic sight drew Jeff in, her delicate nipples leaking golden fluid across her body. A primal need was reawakening within him, one that he hadn&#39;t felt since he was a baby. Venus&#39; utter dominance had made her more than a plant, more than a girlfriend, more than a goddess. She was a mother. Origin of life. And Jeff needed her milk.<br />
<br />
Venus knew what he was after. It was obvious in his shuffling movements, his pursed lips, his brain chemistry that she was effortlessly decoding. As a sovereign of nature, all of earth&#39;s creations were hers to command. Including Jeff. A bond was forming between them, deeper than mere love. A familiar bond that manifested as Jeff closed the distance and latched his mouth around her nipple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, my love!&quot; she moaned. &quot;It is high time I repaid you for all your efforts. Drink from me! Take all you could ever need!&quot;<br />
<br />
A gush of nectar exploded into Jeff&#39;s mouth at her proclamation, and any remaining thoughts he may have had faded away. His whole world was now Venus and her bounty, as all other enjoyment lost its meaning. He would never be able to taste food again, not after being subjected to the perfection that was her milk. A miraculous, life-giving liquid that overrode all of his senses with its mere all-encompassing presence. His mortal mind couldn&#39;t comprehend the delicacy he was offered, so his fraying nerves defaulted the taste into honey, though no bee on the planet could ever produce honey that could unleash this sort of euphoria with its warm sweetness that satisfied all his needs. <br />
<br />
Venus gently held his head and stroked his hair as she offered her endless bounty to him. She felt like she could stay here an eternity, caressing the one who had given her so much. And now she was repaying him, smiling gently as her milk started to take its effect on Jeff.<br />
<br />
Such was the power of her nectar, packed to the brim with sugars, nutrients and semi-sentient spores of her goddess essence. A single drop could feed the entire population of Earth for a day, but the amount that Jeff was drawing from her breasts could at this point have turned Mars from a barren wasteland into a fertile paradise. And still he kept going, his body taking in enough nutrients to the entire food production of the planet. He was overflowing with vitality, and it soon caused him to change.<br />
<br />
Jeff moaned into her breast as his body became a paragon of health. Each and every one of his cells groaned as the essence of Venus invaded them, mercilessly whipping the building blocks of Jeff&#39;s being into shape. She would allow his body to have any deficiencies, and with the will of life itself enforced upon it, it complied. Within seconds, frayed nerves started regrowing as his brain sparked with activity, grey matter multiplying under Venus&#39; demands. His liver started working overtime to purge his body of toxins, while his pulse increased as his blood became saturated with more and more red blood cells, carrying increased amounts of oxygen provided by his enlarging lungs to fuel the developments demanded by a goddess. His body&#39;s defenses became impenetrable as white blood cells were produced in abundance, making the possibility of any bacteria, parasite, virus or cancer cells ever showing its face nonexistent. Any damage to his hearing or sight were fixed in a snap as his senses generally became more refined. Soon enough, there was nothing left to fix, his whole body working flawlessly. But more and more nectar kept pouring in, his body running out of places to store the nutrients as Venus demanded more and more. So it had no choice but to expand.<br />
<br />
Venus smiled as she felt his body tremble beneath her touch, the hair she was caressing growing thicker and rougher as the follicles became saturated with her spores. She mercilessly tore Jeff off her breast, the life-giving stream interrupted as Jeff stared at her in stupor, only to be shoved against her other tit as the feeding began once more, with renewed output.<br />
<br />
Jeff screamed into the nipple as his body began cracking, his bones oversaturated with calcium as they began growing, his frame stretching bigger and wider. His vertebrae popped, his ribs trembled as his body surpassed his previous height. It was as if huge but gentle invisible fingers were remoulding him as he grew into a giant, enhanced skeletal structure evident under his stretched skin. His shoulders crunched as they were forced to stretch even wider, giant bowling balls adorning the top of the body that was now well over two meters tall.<br />
His skin began itching as it stretched to fit the larger body, hair follicles beginning to spit out rougher, darker hairs as his body was adorned in masculinity. His legs, his arms, his chest, all of it was covered in a tasteful coating of hair, thick enough to give Venus a delightful coat to run her fingers through but not make his a hairy ape. He was like an underwear model, a look further reinforced as a dark, tasteful beard pushed out of his angular, reinforced jawline. Beneath the skin his subdermal layers were hardening as Venus directed minerals to form a sort of natural armor coating, making her man a biological tank.<br />
<br />
But a tank is nothing without its cannons, and with a pleased coo Venus blasted one last burst of milk straight into his stomach, the liquid that could have made Earth into an overgrown jungle all the way to the depths of its oceans enhancing her man into the extreme.<br />
<br />
Muscles exploded all across Jeff as her finally tore his mouth off the nipple to scream into the heavens as he blew, muscles billowing like a tent in a thunderstorm as endless fibers were grown within the depths of his body, rounding out his stretched out and skeletal body in a blinding display of masculine power. Biceps regrowing his arms into tough meat stick capable of pulverizing concrete. Thighs swelling into boulders, power condensed within making him the fastest creature to ever roam the lands. POPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOPPOP his stomach rumbled as an impossible 10-pack of abs manifested, muscles dense enough to stop a cannonball, and with a final CRUCH his pecs blew up into rippling plateaus for Venus to caress. <br />
<br />
Venus grinned. Jeff was almost complete. Only the master stroke remained. She let his go, the titan of a man collapsing to his knees, panting, struggling to come to terms with his newfound power. Venus gently floated down, assisted by her vines, and crouched to inspect his manhood. It had been painfully erect this whole time, trembling with need. She playfully stroked it with a finger, stifling a laugh as it bobbed, Jeff&#39;s groan accentuating the touch. An adequate penis, after all. But unfitting to a man of his stature. Already she could feel her gift racing to correct that mistake. But why not give a hand herself?<br />
<br />
Slowly she brought her finger down to her womanhood, and plunged it in with a pleased coo. She was so wet. But soon she would have her due. She dug the finer in, deeper and deeper, until it could go no further. But her all-natural fingernail grew, the leafy digit pushing into her depths until her uterus was breached. Her fingernail entered her womb.<br />
With expert precision, she scraped a bit of her womb lining underneath the nail. The process was pleasurable, and whatever she took regrow as soon as she removed the nail. With a little PLOP she removed her finger from her womanhood and inspected her find as the nail shrank back in. There, on her finger, was a tiny piece of her womb lining, a scrap from the most fertile place in existence. Just holding it out she could sense the air around her turn that much richer, the grass growing a bit greener. She ducked back down underneath Jeff, and mercilessly plunger her finger into the depths of his manhood, the organ easily allowing her passage deposited the small morsel within just as her nutrients reached the organ.<br />
<br />
Jeff screamed wordlessly as his manhood was subjected to the touch of a goddess, and a deep masculine shout erupted from his larger Adam&#39;s Apple as Venus blessed him with her being. The womb lining was instantly absorbed as his penis took it in, and instantly harnessed the overflowing fertility to craft a cock worthy of a goddess.<br />
<br />
Venus&#39; finger was ejected as his cannon of man meat grew instantly, hardening, thickening, lengthening into a pole worthy of divinity. It bobbed, it bulged, it twisted around as his manhood was elevated. Within his sac, balls were bulging, hypercharging as they blew up into defined basketballs, and with a mighty heave he erupted, new, thicker cum bubbling to the surface in a dazzling fountain of white.<br />
<br />
It was over. Jeff stood up, panting, finally realizing his cum-covered girlfriend who now stood two heads shorter than him. He was massive. And Venus was more than pleased.</p>
