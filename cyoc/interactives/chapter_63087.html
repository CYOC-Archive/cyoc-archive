<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I lay there in what was a mix of nervousness and what could only be described as a instinctual rage. Now, I had always been somewhat protective of Terri, not obsessively, but still protective when we were married. And a lack of love, as an emotion, and the general compatibility of our personalities wasn't really a factor in our divorce. That had been some rather shallow things on my part. But over time in which Terri had gotten used to being a werewolf, she'd lost many of the things that I had decided were worthy of divorcing her, and we'd begun again... in ways that I would have fantasized about earlier.<br />
<br />
Learning she was a werewolf... and having sex with her while she changed... it merely lit the proverbial fire under many of my old fantasies. And Terri, had either known about them, despite my best attempts to hide them, or her senses really had made her into a sort of living lie detector. I, however, was not going to complain, because she then gave me the chance to act on a secret fantasy I'd long had. To be a werewolf, myself. And seeing what it had done to Terri and now seeing Night... I'd thought I'd made a good decision.<br />
<br />
But the atmosphere in the bedroom was not anyone's real fantasy, and it was arousing instincts in me that surprised me that I was having them. When Terri had explained her &quot;training&quot; she had mentioned that she had had sex with another man, Darren or Devon, or maybe it was a first name and surname, Darren Devon or Devon Darren. My mind didn't really care which. As a human, I was uncomfortable with the fact someone else had had sex with Terri... especially when the Terri in front of me was well toned, extremely sexy, and doing a lot to get a sexual rise out of me... but I had managed to avoid wanting to challenge the guy, as Terri and I were officially divorced. She was free to have sex with whoever she choses.<br />
<br />
But now, now that I had been bitten and was transitioning to what would be my first transformation, a part of my mind was very, very angry. A good part of me wanted to meet this Darren or Devon or whoever he was... and rip his throat out for messing with my wife. That part of my mind didn't even recognize that Terri and I were divorced. The only thing that stopped me from voicing this desire to challenge the guy was Night's obvious worry about him... Terri's  half-fearful look... and the obvious fact that if the guy was Night's Alpha, he had to have way more experience at being a werewolf then I.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Terri,&quot; Night pleaded, &quot;You're my best friend, going back to high school and you've been a good pack mate to have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Night...&quot; Terri began.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know he'll either kill or chase John,here, out of Fangton and will never let him even come into town in human form,&quot; Night spoke, &quot;you'd lose him after you planned out all of this to get him back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And just leaving the pack works better?&quot; Terri wondered, her earlier bravado replaced by nervous worry, &quot;he could also very well decide to chase ALL of us out of Fangton... and John can not relocate to a new town now. He's only just adjusting... shoot... he'll probably end up going through my dad's meat locker tonight and tomorrow night... and that's if I can... or we can... keep him from deciding to go after something alive if he doesn't get enough meat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He could do that if he really blows his top,&quot; Night nodded, &quot;but at least we'd be a pack of our own. You'd have your ex-husband back... I'd be able to bring in this guy I've been seeing between full moons... and it isn't that far to get out of the city limits... If absolutely necessary we can get John to where there are deer to hunt... or at least someone's cattle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't that be a crime?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but the penalty for killing someone else's livestock is a lot lower then murder,&quot; Night answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about my dad's house?&quot; Terri asked, &quot;I'm supposed to be house sitting this week. &quot;Daddy dearest&quot; is supposed be back a few days after the last full moon this month. He'll expect to see me when he returns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've told me a ton of times that he does very little if anything for you,&quot; Night told her, &quot;he'll probably grumble and complain about you being irresponsible, but it'd probably be no different then if you were here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terri didn't answer immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't there a way to do this without a fight?&quot; I asked, sounding nervous... my knowledge that Night's Alpha had to be more experienced then I at the front of my mind for the moment, &quot;I mean... you've listed the options as stay and get in a fight or leave and get in a fight... and from the way you two have been talking, I doubt this guy is just going to let bygones be bygones and welcome me in...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not,&quot; Night replied, &quot;He'll know Terri bit you from her request from last month... or he'd at least be suspicious of her, and catching your scent now... that'd confirm it to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What would happen if Terri wasn't the one who bit me?&quot; I asked, &quot;say like some rogue came into Fangton last night...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lie?&quot; Night asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It might work,&quot; Terri gasped, &quot;I could say that I was house sitting and that's what you were covering for. I waited for night fall and the obvious moon rise and then came to meet you and the others. Along the way, I witnessed a lone werewolf attack John, here, and drove the intruder off... John was only wounded in the attack and I decided it was in the best interest of him to get him to safety.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And where might this attack have taken place?&quot; Night asked, &quot;Fangton has no major river. Devon will want to know the location if an outsider is &quot;responsible&quot; and then track the intruder down. Once he realizes there was no intruder, you'll be in bigger trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is that creek that runs just south of here,&quot; I commented, &quot;we could say he was following it for some reason, jumped me while I was out walking and retreated back up the creek when Terri caught him. And it isn't that far, as you said, for the intruder to have left the town and gone out into the area around Fangton...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And by then, any individual scent would be too mixed up with others... deer, campers, tents, OFF, cattle, us,&quot; Terri then counted down the possible scents to find, &quot;it'd be an overload of scents and picking out one unknown werewolf would be impossible...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might be a plausible story,&quot; Night sighed, &quot;if Devon buys it, he'd probably still expel you from the pack for not reporting the attack to him last night but it would allow you to keep your ex and leave without a fight... I'd probably still have to declare I'm leaving the pack...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But this way you can say it's because you want to be with a friend,&quot; Terri spoke running a hand down Night's arm, &quot;and Devon can't just fight you for wanting to be with me. And don't say that this would make John and I Alphas... we can vote on that later...&quot;<br />
<br />
Night slowly nodded, &quot;so I guess this means you'll both leave with me... if in the oddest possible way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If only to avoid a fight,&quot; I said nervously, &quot;part of me wants to tear him a new one for... for being with Terri... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As a newly bitten werewolf, you wouldn't stand a chance,&quot; Night answered, &quot;and for the most part... we NEED the stimulation, especially around this time of the month. The fact that Terri and I have had sex with him isn't the problem. The problem is that he won't allow any other male to come in and take his harem away from him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was only fulfilling bodily needs, John,&quot; Terri leaned over Night to rub my shoulder and giving me an eyeful of her breasts, &quot;my heart is always with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I only sighed and nodded. Night, meanwhile, sat up.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime,&quot; Night sighed, &quot;You'll both need to get dressed. Devon may come snooping around here, as we did hear you howl from around here... and even if he doesn't, Terri, you'll still need to make your report and get &quot;thrown out&quot;... and that's if Devon buys this whooper of a lie you two have cooked up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about me?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since Terri and I will be leaving his pack, he shouldn't need to see you,&quot; Night answered, &quot;getting dressed on your part is a precautionary measure in case he comes snooping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here's hoping this works,&quot; Terri spoke as she got up and moved over to a drawer and pulled out a clean pair of panties.</p>
