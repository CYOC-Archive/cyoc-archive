<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You guys have it all wrong” Milton mentioned calmly, as he walked up to the side of the table where Allen and Ty were seated. “In order for a guy to attract those members of the opposite sex, he needs to show a keen interest in technological advances and gadgetry!”<br />
<br />
“What? Who told you that?” Allen wondered.<br />
<br />
“Oh boy” Ty chuckled, as he rolled his eyes. Milton was known to be the biggest geek in school. “Here comes the full Doctoral thesis…”<br />
<br />
“According to a recent study done by a panel of expert members of the Institute of Behavioral Sciences in Technological Research and Development, young researchers score more points when trying to gain personal levels of admiration and attraction from members of the opposite sex when they demonstrate qualities which are in complete agreement with those of students who display exceptional knowledge of technological advances, computer and informational technological savvy, experience with programming, implementing, testing and analyzing data which is provided for use in the study of behavioral sciences for advanced technology workers. Those of opposite sex show special admiration for those who have demonstrated abilities and knowledge of technologies which involve numerous calculations involving complex mathematical functions and algorithms involving theories and standards which may be found in areas of study that closely resemble topics of research at major colleges, institutes, universities and other levels of advanced academia, where technological gadgetry is essential for providing services, solutions, and practical applications for uses in every day life. Therefore, it is my predetermined conclusion to state that attraction at any age level regardless of experience, education, wealth, or economic position within the framework of every day society, is profoundly determined by the qualities and the character of those of the opposite sex in combination with practical everyday uses of technology and technological advanced when it applies to household upkeep and maintenance, dress code and visual aspects of clothing, articles of clothing, and combinations of materials, designs, and use of color mixture and backgrounds. Furthermore, uses of technology in the work force, in the family environment, in areas of pleasure and recreation, and times or places used by worship, meditation, reflection and self-worth, evaluation and assessment, further help increase the quality of life, education, tolerance for others, and overall happiness in the family where concerns for patience, finances, and economics are secondary to the level of personal satisfaction and gratification, which can only be attained by a significant level of individual commitment to using and not using technology as a means for attaining personal goals while maintaining a high level of morals and family values.” Milton replied.<br />
<br />
Milton took a deep breath, before he grabbed his cup of water and started drinking from it.<br />
<br />
“So… what does all that mean?” Allen wondered. He rested his chin on the palm of his hand, while his elbow was on the table. He was extremely bored from listening to Milton!<br />
<br />
“If you’re a geek, you’ll get a girl friend!” Ty chuckled. “Eventually!”<br />
<br />
“I think you need to turn Milton into some robotic gadget-collecting apparatus or something…” Allen laughed.<br />
<br />
“That’s not a bad idea! What do you think of that, Milton?” Ty asked his geeky friend. “Would you like to be a robot, which is packed with gadgets?”<br />
<br />
Milton stared at Ty for a moment. Ty could tell that he was thinking about it.<br />
<br />
“Well, considering the fact that your suggestion is in direct correlation with the theory involving the science of combining technology with human organism, your suggestion would be very acceptable to someone who seeks to understand the impact of technological advances on every day life when he is surrounded my electronic means of attaining personal goals on a daily basis, therefore…” Milton began to respond.<br />
<br />
“MILTON!” Allen shouted impatiently, cutting him off. “Just answer ‘Yes’ or ‘No’! I’m tired of listening to all your Doctoral thesis-filled perpetual never-ending technologically-infested techno-babble!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, well… Yes!” Milton replied.<br />
<br />
“Finally!” Allen sighed. “A simple, one-word answer from Professor Milton Einstein. Thank you!”<br />
<br />
“Hey, it must be tough when you’re a teen who has an IQ that is so high, that it’s basically off the scale…” Ty laughed.<br />
<br />
“Absolutely!” Milton responded, as he took his glasses of so he could clean the lenses with a napkin. “Human intelligence is something which cannot be measured or expressed solely by a number which is calculated based on given responses and a written examination. Intelligence is often expressed by the method, speed, and purpose for analyzing a problem, constructing a method of implementing possible options which may lead to realistic solutions to the problem, followed by documentation, education, instruction and demonstration to third parties, in order for similar problems in other environments to be solved using identical methods for problem analysis and solving theories. Furthermore, intelligence isn’t just a quotient of one’s ability to reason, to analyze, and to draw conclusions to complex issues, but it must also be observed as a measure of artistic abilities and ways of artistic expression, formation of human traits and character, and development of good moral habits, tolerance and patience for working in groups involving more than one person. Intelligence is formed by accepting life events, drawing conclusions, documenting different outcomes of behavioral patterns and careful studies of human qualities in the form of expressions, phrases, and emotions, which are a result of…”<br />
<br />
<br />
“SHUT UP!” Allen shouted, as he placed his hands over his ears and closed his eyes tightly. “Ty! Can you change him now? I’ve had enough of all these theories and studies already! Listening to Milton is like reading the Encyclopedia Britannica!”<br />
<br />
“Milton! Get up and stand over there!” Ty ordered, as he pointed to the spot near the end of the table. Milton stood up and walked over to the spot that Ty had pointed out, without saying a word.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Milton began to grow taller! Milton was only 5 ft 6 inches tall, and he slowly started to grow taller as his legs grew longer!<br />
<br />
“Holy GigaBytes! My body is experiencing an increase in height! Wow! This is something that is normally beyond normal rates of aging and growth in modern-day human physiology!” Milton gasped, as he looked down at his longer legs.<br />
<br />
“Just be quiet and enjoy the changes, Milton!” Allen said, while he rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
When Milton’s growth had stopped, he stood a staggering 6 ft and 8 inches tall!<br />
<br />
Next, his clothes began to change, as clothing began to merge with his skin like a wetsuit on a diver. Finally, his shoes had transformed into soles of a metallic color, which began to cover the rest of him. His feet had changed to metal, and the metallic look was slowly creeping its way up his towering body.<br />
<br />
Within moments, his ankles had become metal, with steel plates covering the part where human skin used to be. Milton still looked human, but his skin was slowly turning into steel!<br />
<br />
As the growth crept upwards, his legs were completely covered with metal. His knees, quads, and calves were completely incased in solid steel! <br />
<br />
Milton had to adjust the stance, when his torso grew a little wider, forcing him to spread out his legs more. Not only was he slowly being transformed into a robot, but his strength was increased as well. His torso changed completely. He now sported abdominals of steel and a mighty chest of metal, which stuck out a little, giving him the look of a young bodybuilder. The arms, hands and fingers transformed, followed by his back and his shoulders. Within moments, Milton was completely transformed into a large robot, encased in solid steel from the neck on down.<br />
<br />
He turned his neck and looked down. He flexed his arm and wiggled his metallic fingers, while hearing the buzzing sound of gears and joints in the background. He had a grip of steel, literally, and he was thoroughly equipped with a large number of devices, electronics, and gadgets. He had numerous panels and levers on his body, although most of them were covered by metallic plates, which could slide open at his command.<br />
<br />
“Wow! This is the ultimate in electronic application and industrial manufacturing involving the engineering of bio technology and human physiology!” Milton cheered, as he examined his new, powerful body!<br />
<br />
Then Milton turned towards Ty, while Ty and Allen were staring at him and were completely in awe.<br />
<br />
“Ty, I wish to express my sincere gratitude for allowing this fascinating transformation to take place in me!” Milton chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Uhh… You’re welcome, dude!” Ty grinned.<br />
<br />
Milton looked extremely impressive. He was big, heavy, muscular and tall! He almost looked like a teenage version of the RoboCop character from the movie of the same name. <br />
<br />
Milton raised his arm to the horizontal position, allowing a panel in his wrist to open up, revealing a small satellite dish, which was attached to an extended arm. <br />
<br />
“Ahh… My weather satellite has detected that an increase in temperature will take place in the next 87.7 seconds, where we’ll get 1.639 degrees warmer. I think I’ll walk the 2.7654 mile distance so I can get home on time to download some songs off the internet.” He said.<br />
<br />
Milton then looked at his index finger on his right hand, where the tip of his finger opened up, uncovering the plug of a neatly coiled USB cable.<br />
<br />
“I have my own cables, which will allow my body to connect to any USB-supported device, in order to allow for transfer of data and usage of any hardware which allows for connections to be made via a standard USB port! Kewl!”<br />
<br />
“Alright gentlemen, I must log off our session and continue the informative and intellectual conversation at a later time! I must be home at 1800 hours for supper!” Milton continued.<br />
<br />
Just as Milton had walked just a few yards, a girl came from the other side of the schoolyard. It was Marcie, another student who was known to be an incredible geek. Marcie was only 5 feet tall, she wore large glasses, a long, pink dress with mathematical formulas printed on it, and she was carrying a tablet PC under her arm.<br />
<br />
“Hi Milton! Oooh… You look so… Robotic! You look like a million Bytes!” Marcie chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Would you like to connect with me? We can go to the bookstore or to the library. Let’s go for some ice cream afterwards!” Milton suggested.<br />
<br />
“Absolutely! Let’s get together and download some thoughts and ideas!” Marcie smiled.<br />
<br />
“Ooh Marcie… You make my hard drive spin faster!” Milton grinned.<br />
<br />
“Ooh Milton… Let me count the ways you make my processor go into overdrive!” she replied, with a big smile on her face. <br />
<br />
“Sure! 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 1A, 1B, 1C…” Milton chuckled in response.<br />
<br />
“Ooh Milton… I love it when you talk in hex… That is so awesome! On my PC at home, I have allocated 1,566,973,276 bytes of storage on my hard drive for storing graphic pictures of you…”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah? Wow… You make me feel like I’m in Binary heaven!” he responded. “I have a built-in microwave oven, a radio, and a remote for the TV, an electric can opener, a computer terminal, a food processor, and a satellite dish built in to my robotic body! Not to mention my own CD player, MP3 player, and video gaming console…”<br />
<br />
“Let’s go to that place across the street for ice cream! They have 1111111 different flavors of ice cream over there…” she pointed out.<br />
<br />
Milton and Marcie held hands, as they strolled across the schoolyard together.<br />
<br />
Ty and Allen stared at the couple with wide eyes and open mouths.<br />
<br />
“Look at those two geeks” Allen smirked. “They’re like a match made in heaven!”<br />
<br />
“They’re more like a match made in the science lab! Well, I’ve never seen Milton that happy before! It’s awesome!” Ty said with a grin, while staring at the short girl and the towering robot.<br />
<br />
“So… What’s next?” Allen wondered.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry; we’ll find somebody else to change before the day is over…” Ty said, as he looked around the school grounds for other friends of his.</p>
