<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris busied himself setting the table, trying to calm the nervous energy buzzing through him. He wasn’t entirely sure why Mason coming over for dinner had him so tense. It was just a friendly dinner invitation from his parents. Nothing weird about that. Except, of course, for the fact that he couldn’t stop glancing at the clock, counting down the minutes until Mason arrived.<br />
<br />
Jake wandered into the dining room, an infuriatingly smug grin plastered across his face. “Relax, Chris. It’s not a date.”<br />
<br />
Chris shot him a glare, though his reddening ears probably undercut the effect. “Don’t you have better things to do than hang around and bother me?”<br />
<br />
“Not really,” Jake said, leaning against the doorway with his phone in his paw. “But don’t worry, I’ll keep my commentary to a minimum. For now.”<br />
<br />
Before Chris could retort, there was a knock at the door. Jake snickered and made no move to answer, so Chris wiped his hands on a towel and hurried to the door, determined to act like a normal person.<br />
<br />
When he opened it, Mason stood there, a sheepish smile crossing his muzzle and a bottle of cider in hand. “Hey, uh… hope I’m not too early?”<br />
<br />
“No, no, you’re right on time,” Chris said, stepping aside to let him in. He noticed Mason seemed just as fidgety as he felt, shifting his weight from one foot to the other as he glanced around.<br />
<br />
“This is for you all,” Mason said, holding out the cider. “I wasn’t sure what to bring, but, uh… this seemed safe.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks. That’s… that’s great,” Chris replied, taking the bottle and nearly fumbling it in his haste. He cursed himself silently as Mason chuckled softly.<br />
<br />
They stood there for a moment, neither quite sure what to say. Finally, Chris cleared his throat. “Dinner’s almost ready. I can, uh, show you to the dining room if you want.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, sure. Thanks,” Mason said, following Chris inside.<br />
<br />
Neither of them said anything as they walked past the living room and toward the dining room. Before Chris could lead him into the room, Jake appeared in the doorway, grinning like the Cheshire Cat. “Mason! Long time no see. Hope you’re ready for Chris’s famous pies.”<br />
<br />
Mason’s ears perked up. “Oh, yeah? I’ve heard rumors about those. Looking forward to trying them.”<br />
<br />
Chris shot Jake a warning look before turning to Mason. “They’re just pies. Nothing fancy.”<br />
Mason met his gaze, smiling softly. “If they’re anything like what you used to bake for the school fundraisers, I’m sure they’ll be amazing.”<br />
<br />
Chris felt his face go flush and quickly turned toward the kitchen. “I’ll, uh, go check on them. Make yourself at home.”<br />
<br />
As he retreated, he could hear Jake whisper to Mason, “Don’t let him fool you. He’s been stressing about this all day.”<br />
<br />
Chris groaned internally. This was going to be a long dinner.<br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
The dinner table buzzed with warm conversation as plates were passed around, the clatter of silverware filling the space. Carol had outdone herself, creating a spread that was inviting to herbivores and carnivores alike. Chris kept his eyes mostly on his plate, though he could feel Mason’s presence beside him, closer than he’d expected when they’d all sat down.<br />
<br />
“So, Mason,” Carol said, smiling warmly at their guest, “How’s work treating you? I imagine it’s never dull being an EMT.”<br />
<br />
Mason set his fork down, swallowing a bite of mashed potatoes. “It’s definitely not boring,” he said with a small laugh. “Some days are quiet, but then you’ll get a call that reminds you how unpredictable things can be.”<br />
<br />
Chris glanced sideways, watching Mason’s face as he spoke. His tone was casual, but there was a weight behind his words, a calmness that came from having seen more than most people ever would. Mason caught the glance and offered a small smile, which Chris quickly pretended not to notice, focusing instead on buttering his roll.<br />
<br />
“You’re a good man, Mason,” Frank said with an approving nod. “Takes a lot to do what you do, seeing people at their worst and still showing up the next day.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Mr. White,” Mason replied, his ears flicking slightly. “I like to think it’s worth it. Even on the hard days, knowing I’ve helped someone makes it easier.”<br />
<br />
Chris felt a swell of admiration he wasn’t quite prepared for. Mason had always been easygoing in high school, the type of guy everyone liked, but there was a depth to him now that Chris couldn’t ignore. He found himself wanting to say something, to acknowledge it, but the words stuck in his throat.<br />
<br />
“So,” Jake said, leaning back in his chair with a sly grin, “What’s the weirdest call you’ve ever gotten?”<br />
Mason laughed, his eyes lighting up. “Oh, there are a lot of contenders for that one. But there was this one time—”<br />
<br />
Chris watched as Mason launched into a story, animated now in a way he hadn’t been earlier. The others laughed along with him, but Chris stayed quiet, caught in the way Mason’s face lit up as he spoke. Every now and then, though, he would subtly reach his hand up to feel the growing bump on his head, trying not to draw attention to himself. He’d have to ask Mason to take a look at it while he was here…<br />
<br />
After a while, everyone’s plates had been mostly cleared, the conversation shifting into a comfortable lull. Chris’s mom glanced toward the kitchen and smiled. “Well, I think it’s time for dessert. Chris, would you mind bringing out the pie?”<br />
<br />
Chris nodded, glad for an excuse to escape the table for a moment. “Yeah, sure. Be right back.” He stood, feeling Mason’s gaze follow him as he headed to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
The scent of cherries greeted him as he carefully retrieved the pie from the oven, where they’d been staying warm. He set them on the counter, taking a moment to steady himself before carrying them back to the dining room. As he entered, Jake let out a low whistle.<br />
<br />
“Now that’s what I’m talking about,” Jake said, grinning. “You’ve outdone yourself this time, Chris.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” Chris muttered, setting the pies on the table. He grabbed a knife and started slicing, trying to ignore the way Mason leaned forward, clearly eager.<br />
<br />
“Is that a cherry pie?” Mason asked, his nose twitching as he sniffed the air a bit.  <br />
<br />
Chris couldn’t help but smile, glancing up at Mason as he plated the first slice. “Yeah. Thought I’d try something different this time.”<br />
<br />
Mason’s eyes lit up, and he sat up a little straighter. “Cherry’s my favorite. Didn’t think I’d be lucky enough to have it tonight.”<br />
<br />
Jake snickered from his seat. “Oh, Chris knows it’s your favorite.”<br />
<br />
“Jake,” Chris said sharply, giving his brother a pointed look before turning back to Mason. He handed him the first slice, noticing the brief brush of their fingers as Mason took the plate.<br />
<br />
Mason didn’t seem to notice—or if he did, he didn’t show it. Instead, he stared at the pie like it was some kind of treasure. “Thanks,” he said softly, his ears perking up as he picked up his fork.<br />
Chris handed out the rest of the slices, sitting back down just as Mason took his first bite. The reaction was immediate—a soft, muffled groan of delight as he closed his eyes, savoring the taste.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Mason said after a moment, his tail twitching slightly behind him. “This is… incredible. Best cherry pie I’ve ever had.”<br />
<br />
Chris felt a flush creep up his neck and busied himself with a plate for his mother. “It’s just pie,” he muttered. “Nothing special.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t sell yourself short,” Mason said, pointing his fork at Chris before taking another bite. “Seriously, this is amazing.”<br />
<br />
Carol beamed, clearly proud. “He’s been baking since he was little. Always had a knack for it.”<br />
<br />
Jake leaned back in his chair, smirking. “Yeah, but you didn’t see how stressed he was about tonight. Practically hovered over the oven.”<br />
<br />
“Jake,” Chris hissed, shooting him a glare.<br />
<br />
Mason chuckled, his eyes warm as they met Chris’s. “Well, whatever you did, it was worth it. Thanks for going to the trouble.”<br />
<br />
Chris shrugged, trying to downplay his efforts. “It wasn’t any trouble.”<br />
<br />
As the last bites of pie disappeared from their plates, the table settled into a pleasant hum of post-meal contentment. Chris’s father leaned back in his chair, sighing. “That was a feast. I don’t think I’ll eat again until tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
His mother chuckled, collecting a few of the emptier plates. “You always say that, and then you’re raiding the fridge by midnight.”<br />
<br />
Jake grinned. “He’s not the only one. Pretty sure I’ll be dreaming about that pie tonight.”<br />
<br />
Chris rolled his eyes but couldn’t hide his small smile as he stood to help his mom clear the table. “Glad it lived up to the hype.”<br />
<br />
Mason dabbed at his mouth with a napkin before leaning forward slightly, his expression genuine. “Seriously, Chris. That was amazing. You’ve officially ruined all other cherry pies for me.”<br />
<br />
Chris chuckled nervously, scratching the back of his head as he broke eye contact. It’d been a long while since he’d heard anyone gush about his baking like that. “Yeah, no problem. Glad you liked it.”<br />
<br />
“Liked it?” Jake interjected with a laugh. “Mason practically inhaled his slice.”<br />
<br />
Mason chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. “What can I say? Cherry’s my favorite.”<br />
<br />
“I told you,” Jake said, nudging Chris with his elbow. “Told you it’d impress him.”<br />
<br />
Chris shot him a warning look but didn’t take the bait. Instead, he grabbed a few empty plates and nodded toward the kitchen. “Come on, Jake. Help me clear the rest.”<br />
<br />
Jake groaned but stood, grabbing a couple of glasses. “Fine. Only because I want leftovers later.”<br />
<br />
Mason started to rise as well. “I can help—”<br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t worry about it,” Carol said with a wave of her paw. “You’re our guest tonight. Relax.”<br />
<br />
“Really, it’s no trouble,” Mason said, glancing toward Chris.<br />
<br />
Chris gave him a small smile. “We’ve got it. Just sit tight for now.”<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, Mason settled back into his chair, his gaze lingering on Chris for a moment before joining in the easy conversation with Chris’s parents. Chris caught the look but quickly turned his focus to the plates in his hands, a faint smile tugging at his lips as he headed for the kitchen.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t much, but tonight had felt… good.</p>
