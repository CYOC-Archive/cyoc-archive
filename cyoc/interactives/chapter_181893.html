<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ultimately, Frank decided against trying to return to being straight for now. A rash decision was how he got himself in this situation in the first place, so he really needed to think of a plan carefully this time. Something that would only change his sexuality and not his new body he quickly came to love. Besides, it wouldn&#39;t hurt to be gay for a while... would it?<br />
<br />
Once Frank arrived at school, he noticed that students were treating him differently. Some were intimidated by his new stature, others look at him in admiration, and some of them looked at him with lustful stares. Either way, all the students were treating Frank with respect now. No more jocks being able to push him around, no more students mouthing him off, and it was all thanks to his new beefy body. Speaking of which, the students were probably looking at him like that because he was still wearing his gym stringer. As much as he liked the student body ogling at him, it wasn&#39;t very appropriate now, was it? So, Mr. Maynard gave a quick flex and wink to his admires and headed to the teacher&#39;s lounge to grab a jacket. While he was there, he heard a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Frank! Had a good workout today?&quot; Frank turned around to see his fellow teacher Levi Anderson, the lit teacher. Usually, Frank wasn&#39;t fond of Levi. He was always jealous that Levi&#39;s natural charisma allowed him to control the students better than he ever could. Today, however, he was looking at him in a different light. Was Levi always been this attractive? Frank never noticed how tall, lean and handsome the lit teacher was before. Not to mention he had a smile that just made him melt... Ack! No! His new sexuality was making him attracted to Mr. Anderson! No, get it together, Frank told himself. You&#39;re just a straight man in a gay body, not some lovestruck teenager.<br />
<br />
&quot;U-uh, no. I had to some errands run, so I ended up only getting one exercise in before I had to get back here.&quot; Frank replied while trying not to stare at Levi&#39;s sharp jawline splattered in some sexy blond stubble. No! Frank internally cursed his changed sexuality for making him think of those thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, that&#39;s a shame. You know I should really go to the gym with you sometime. You can show me the ropes and all that. Though sometime later, since I need to head to class. It was nice chatting to you, though, Frank.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah.&quot; Oh god, Frank then noticed how nice Levi&#39;s butt was when the lit teacher walked away. Once Levi left the room, the physics teacher nearly crumpled to the floor. Fuck, this was going to be harder than he expected. Well, no need to panic; all the bodybuilder needed to do was avoid Mr. Anderson until he could figure out a plan... right? Yeah, it wasn&#39;t going to be that easy as on his way to class, he ended up running into Marco Green, the school custodian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey, Mr. Maynard. You&#39;re looking good today.&quot; Marco said to Frank as he passed by. Marco was the only person that the students pushed around more than Frank before the transformation. Yet Marco kept smiling despite that abuse. Frank used to feel nothing but pity for Marco, but now he was feeling something else. He never noticed that Marco&#39;s skin was the perfect shade of caramel, not to mention he had a decent face the was complimented by his well-kept beard. If the janitor worked on his body and face a bit more, Marco could be drop-dead gorgeous... oh no, not again. Frank needed to get away from Marco, so he gave a quick wave before continuing to head to his classroom at a faster pace than before.<br />
<br />
Before he reached his classroom, Frank ended up catching a glance of Joel, the arrogant young jock that Frank transformed into a humble coach. While Joel wasn&#39;t so hot now, just seeing him reminded Frank how he looked before, specifically, when he was in his prime during his transformation. He was so muscular and handsome to boot, and Frank hated the fact he was thinking about Joel this way!<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
The bodybuilding teacher tried his hardest to not think about hot men and instead attempted to focus on his teaching. While it was enjoyable to see his lessons going smoother due to the respect his students were giving him now, his thoughts kept drifting back to men. He wasn&#39;t just thinking of Levi, Marco, and Joel either, but all sorts of men that he now found hot. All of those sexy men just kept swimming in his head, and that, combined with his increased testosterone, made Frank a horny mess by lunchtime. <br />
<br />
Fuck, this was bad. Frank was way too horny to just jack off somewhere; he needed to have sex. The old, bitter part of Frank was both disgusted at the thought and angry at himself for putting himself in this position in the first place. At the same time, however, the new gay bodybuilder part of him felt excited about the prospect of having sex with a man for the first time. Either way, it&#39;s not like he had a choice in the matter, and besides, it&#39;s not like one gay hook-up was going to make him want to stay gay...right? Clearly, denial wasn&#39;t just a river in Eygpt to Frank.<br />
<br />
Of course, the question was who would he have sex with exactly? He probably couldn&#39;t drive to that gay bodybuilding gym and back before lunch period was over, and he was pretty sure all the men in this school were straight. That&#39;s when Frank remembered the remote. He could just change one of the guys to blend in with himself and become a gay bodybuilding teacher as well. Not only was Frank now fantasizing about Joel returning to his prime, but the horny man was also imagining how good Levi and Marco would look with more muscle. He then blinked and shook his head of those thoughts, trying desperately to convince himself he wasn&#39;t enjoying this. Frank would just turn the man he chooses back to normal when it was all done and over.<br />
<br />
Now, who was Frank going to turn into a gay bodybuilder to fuck? Also, perhaps he should double-check the awareness settings. Well, if he wasn&#39;t too horny to think straight, that is.</p>
