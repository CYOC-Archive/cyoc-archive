<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claire was still sitting as the others pinned you down. &quot;Alright, then, something must be done about him. But what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make him a girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make him your brother!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make him your sister!&quot;<br />
<br />
You coughed out an incoherent mumble. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire stood up, walked over, and kneeled down above you, her face uncomfortably close to yours. &quot;You snuck in my room at a girl&#39;s night out. What for? To peek on us getting naked? To see those magical mounds of flesh atop our torsos? To examine...boooooooobs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her taunting was made worse by the stench of bubblegum ice cream wafting from her breath. &quot;Well, I don&#39;t really care either way what the reason is for entering. You invaded my privacy, and for that, there is a price.&quot;<br />
<br />
She pushed a bookshelf, which revealed a hidden closet, glowing slightly purple behind the rack of clothes. It appered to go on, past the seeable point—who needed that many outfits? It wouldn&#39;t be until much later you saw that some of the clothes were meant for guys. Claire pushed through the clothing, revealing mason jars full of glowing purple liquid. The stuff looked toxic at best.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is that?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
 The four pinning you down began to again throw out suggestions. &quot;Younger sister!&quot; &quot;Younger brother!&quot; &quot;Boyfriend!&quot; &quot;Girlfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Josh just left for California, leaving me without my standard GBF.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gulped. &quot;What&#39;s your GBF?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire giggled. &quot;My gay best friend, of course!&quot;<br />
<br />
You broke out into laughter—an impressive feat, pinned as you are. &quot;You can&#39;t turn somebody gay. That&#39;s just impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU can&#39;t turn anybody gay,&quot; Claire corrected. &quot;I...do the impossible from time to time.&quot; She isolated three jars and looked at her posse of girls. &quot;Jock, twink, or cub?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley shook her head. &quot;There&#39;s too many jocks at school already. And they&#39;re dumb and smell gross.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And cubs are great but they&#39;re hairy and such messes and won&#39;t shopping with you.&quot; Kelly, this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, twink?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nods of agreement all around. Claire picked up two of the purple jars—one labeled &quot;Mind&quot;, the other, &quot;Body&quot;. &quot;Honestly, I have a mixed version back there that will lead to a more homogenous result, but it&#39;s more fun to watch you get wildly uncomfortable. We can always homogenize later; after all, Josh was addicted to the stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
You remember Josh. He was nice, but wildly gay. He had a bit of his hair dyed for a while. You hoped you could make it out with the same hair you had now. <br />
<br />
Ashley plugged your nose, but Claire called her off. &quot;That&#39;s not necessary. He only needs one drop—he&#39;ll do the rest on his own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not touching that stuff!&quot;<br />
<br />
Claire took a dropper you hadn&#39;t seen before, sucked up a little bit of the &quot;Body&quot; liquid, and dropped it in your mouth. It tasted like grape juice. You tried to spit it out, but it mixed with your saliva and you accidentally swallowed.<br />
<br />
A warmth began to grow in the pit of your stomach, a euphoric sensation that reminded you of great Christmas choirs, or home-baked cookies. It spread from your stomach up your torso, into your arms and down through your legs. It was like chiming bells, beautiful and charming, that seemed to lift you off the ground. The  warmth spread to your head, and a thousand angels seemed to sing in unison in your mind. It was heaven.<br />
<br />
And then it faded, as fast as it had come. The world was cold and unforgiving in comparison.<br />
<br />
You realized that you were sitting up, unpinned. And yet, you couldn&#39;t flee. You could only think about drinking the rest of that potion.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s amazing, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Claire said. &quot;Josh was addicted to the stuff. That&#39;s why he got a little gayer each year. Maybe he didn&#39;t even realize it. He used to be my boyfriend, you know. Then he cheated. So I turned him into the gay jock he was.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked back at you. &quot;You&#39;re lucky this is the worst you&#39;ll get. I have some interesting jars of potion back there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More,&quot; you croak, hardly hearing her words. &quot;I need more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so fast. First, to the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stumbled down the hall. Her bathroom had a full-length mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naked,&quot; she ordered. You complied. She still had her potion in her hands. &quot;Now, before we proceed, are you sure you want all of this?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod. You don&#39;t want anything more than the entire bottle down your throat—for that warm sensation to return.<br />
<br />
She hands it to you gleefully. In a matter of seconds, you&#39;ve chugged the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Again, the euphoric warmth traversed your body. Time seemed to bend out of shape for the drink as it laced each pore and traced each cell. It was a feeling so good, it was impossible to describe.<br />
<br />
And then it stopped. Coldly. Harshly.<br />
<br />
You looked at your naked self in the mirror. A little pudgy, but broad. Wide neck (that was your dad&#39;s) with a bit of a bumpy nose (that was your mom&#39;s). A flabby chin line (that was yours). Nothing, however, seemed different.<br />
<br />
Claire nearly anticipated the thought. &quot;Just wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
A flash of purple sparks erupted in the mirror, and you nearly fell of balance—the fat that once you had was gone, leaving behind a set of solid abs and pecs. But as soon as you began to celebrate this, in a flash of purple, those, too were gone, replaced by lean muscle that mustered a four pack and some nearly-visible ribs. You were skinny. Skinny as all hell. A flash of purple confirmed it when your shoulders shrunk in, your broad frame a thing of the past. With it, the flabby chin, leaving a skinny but sharp jaw that almost looked out of place on your wide neck. A flash of purple, and that, too, was gone, leaving in its place a skinnier one, with a visible vein down the center. Another flash, and your legs and arms became lean pieces of muscle and bone. The zone downstairs shrunk with the next flash, and with the following, all excess matter seemed to have relocated to the rear zone—your new butt was huge.<br />
<br />
Your face was a more gradual change. First, your lips plumped and grew much redder. Secondly, the nose that now looked mountainous shrunk into a petite, feminine button nose. Your eyes, once hazel, turned electric blue and danced in the light in a way you&#39;d never really seen before. Your bushy eyebrows thinned and trimmed. Your chubby cheeks lost much of the baby fat, leaving behind wild cheekbones, revealing an angular, angelic, attractive face. <br />
<br />
You pleaded a little, &quot;no, not the hair,&quot; but it was too late. The mousy brown mess folded upwards, trimming along the back and sides of your head into a perfect fade, clearly maintained. The hair curled, kinking into tight loops sitting atop faded sides. The majority of it pushed forward, leaving a tall quiff in the front and a fairly flat fringe on top. Then, horrifically, you watched as the sides turned a platinum blonde, as if dyed, and then the color worked its way up the hair, all the way until the coiffe atop was the color of the hair of Maryelin Monroe.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, god! What the hell is this?&quot; you asked. Looking around, the world seemed different, taller. Were you shorter?<br />
<br />
&quot;This is you. Thiiiis is a twink&#39;s body. You live in it now,&quot; came Claire&#39;s response.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is not what I wanted!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I didn&#39;t want some creeper poking around my bedroom, and yet, here we are. But hey, before we get into the mental changes&quot;—mental changes?!?—&quot;I&#39;m going to offer you a choice. You get to pick two homogenizing addons, because we&#39;re making something reaaaaaally gay here. You get to pick one now, and the other later; 2 in total. So tell me,&quot; Claire asked diabolically,<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to be a theater gay, a workout gay, a nerdy gay, a fashion gay, or a boyband gay? Remember,  straight you gets to pick one, then twink you picks one, and then we put them together and hope something amazing comes out. What&#39;s your choice?&quot;</p>
