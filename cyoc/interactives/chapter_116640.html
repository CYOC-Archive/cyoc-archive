<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;ll take it one step at a time for now.&quot;  John sighed.  &quot;After we see what you can do about anti-aging, maybe I could try one of the other treatments?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot;  The receptionist grinned.  &quot;Though I still think a little body sculpting would be beneficial.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you are the expert.&quot;  John grinned.  &quot;Put me down for both, then.  And maybe the bestial treatment afterwards.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl checked off some blocks on the sign-in sheet and then led him into a large, open room with a full balcony overlooking a beautiful green valley.  A swimming pool was set into the floor, maybe sixty by twenty feet.  The water had a curious pinkish tint, and looked cloudy. Off to the side was a small raised octagonal platform with full-length mirrors rising up from three connected sides.   &quot;Wait here.  Allysia will be back in just a moment.&quot;  She pointed to a bench on the side.  &quot;You can leave your robe there.&quot;  Then she left.<br />
<br />
Leave his robe?  That was all he had on!  John looked around, feeling very self-conscious.  Given that there was nothing else in the room, it seemed pretty obvious that he was supposed to get in the pool.  He moved tot he edge and dipped a toe in.  The water - if that&#39;s what it was - felt warm and thick, almost like oil.  A whole pool of body oil?  That sorta made sense - it would be a great way to soften his skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, John.&quot;  He turned to see an amazingly beautiful woman approaching from the entrance.  She was maybe in her late 20s, with blonde hair that flowed down her back and the most intense green eyes he had ever seen.  To his acute embarrassment, he started to get an erection and turned away with his cheeks burning.   The woman laughed.  &quot;Please!  That is a quite appropriate and welcome response.  If you did not find me attractive, I would have left and sent for Dionys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dionys?&quot;  John thought about the name and flushed brighter.<br />
<br />
Alysia grinned.  &quot;My male counterpart.  Understand that we cater to all desires here, with no silly moral judgements or social taboos.  That is part of what makes this Spa so special.&quot;<br />
<br />
John&#39;s eyes widened and he decided he would have to check on limiting what was available to his kids.   They widened even more when Allysia came over and tugged at his robe.  &quot;Into the pool with you.  For the best effect, swim underwater a few times to get even coverage.  Please come out when I tell you, and then I will do the sculpting.&quot;  He looked at the murkey pink liquid and hesitated - then he let her pull the robe off and slipped into the shallow end.  <br />
<br />
The fluid felt really good - he was sure it was not water, but it did not feel oily, either.  Remembering the woman&#39;s instructions, he waded out and found that the pool had a drop-off just a few feet out.  The thick liquid supported him well, and when he leaned forward and dove in, he felt buoyed up.  The pool felt amazing!  The warm liquid made his skin tingle oddly, but did not irritate his eyes at all.  When he came to the surface for a breath, the fluid ran down his face.  He felt his face - it was coated with a thin layer of what felt like jelly or paste.  Diving back in, he decided he would try to impress the woman by swimming a few laps under the surface if he could.  It had been a lot of years since he had done more than a single lap across the top of a pool, but he had a surprising amount of energy.  <br />
<br />
Getting across the pool was a little harder than swimming through water, and he had to surface before he got back.  He blinked, trying to clear the slick fluid from his eyes.  His vision was blurred a little, but since the stuff didn&#39;t burn at all, he did not worry about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little longer, I think.&quot;  Allysia moved to the shallow end.  &quot;But listen and come out when I tell you to.&quot;<br />
<br />
John grinned and nodded, and started back across the pool.  He slipped under the surface to try another couple of laps.  It was easier this time, and he made two full laps before coming to the surface with a  gasp.  Allysia chuckled.  &quot;I was calling you, but you did not hear me under the surface.  You should come out of there now. &quot;  Her voice was muffled and he reached up to find slick gel covering his ears.<br />
<br />
John flushed slightly.  He had enjoyed swimming so much he had forgotten to pay attention to her.  Well, a little longer in the body lotion would just make his skin softer.  He climbed up and stood dripping beside the pool as Allysia walked around him, nodding her head slightly.  His vision was still blurred, and he kept blinking to clear it.  He felt heavy, and was startled to realize he had a thick coating of translucent pink gel covering his entire body.<br />
<br />
The woman gestured towards the mirrors and he followed her over, stepping onto the platform.  The gel was still warm, maybe an inch thick, but had opened up around his nose and mouth.  His vision started to clear as he blinked more of the slime away.  Even with the coating of gel, something seemed strange about his reflection.  Before he could pin the oddness down, Allysia stepped up beside him and started scraping the gel off his face with her fingers.  She was in front of him, blocking his view of the mirrors, her smooth hands sliding over his skin.  He didn&#39;t even feel the resistance of his usual stubble - the lotion was definitely doing its job.  Then she grinned and stepped back so he could see himself.  John&#39;s eyes widened and he gasped.  The person staring back at him from the mirrors was...</p>
