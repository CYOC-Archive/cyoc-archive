<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having convinced his mother earlier that morning he was sick, Kyle spent most of the day lounging around the house, doing nothing more than watching TV and playing video games.  Well, and occasionally rubbing the obscene bulge that rested between his legs, his pants sported an almost permanent wet spot where the head of his cock pressed against the denim.  He&#39;d have to figure out a solution for that, but it was a problem for later.  As the afternoon rolled around he began to get more and more nervous.  Jen was only the first step in his plan.  In fact, he didn&#39;t even need to transform her the way he did, he just needed her doing what he told her for a day.  The rest was just a bonus, and a nice taste of the revenge that was to come.  Kyle had a more important target.<br />
<br />
He looked up just as the clock was rolling closer to five.  It was just about time to go.  He&#39;d be home any moment.  &quot;Wake up, Jen.&quot;  He didn&#39;t need to say it out loud, but doing it felt like rubbing her face in it.  As soon as she was sharing his consciousness again, he could feel her quivering rage, but also relief at being able to see again and not being locked in her own private darkness.  &quot;Time to get to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it this time?  You want to stroke yourself off again?  Forget it.&quot;  Jen knew her words were hollow, worse, she knew Kyle knew it.  She could feel the smugness rolling off of him.  Though he could feel her curiosity peak as he started heading out the door and hit the sidewalk.  He knew where he was going, Jen could feel his eagerness.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  I&#39;m going to get payback, and you&#39;re going to help me.  Be good about it and I might even release you from your cock prison.&quot;  Kyle was serious.  Jen knew it as soon as he said the words.  Though her elation suddenly turned to dread as Kyle turned to walk up the path of one of the nearby houses.  Jen knew this house all too well.  It was were Eric lived.  Eric, football team captain, quarterback and her boyfriend.  &quot;Ah..&quot;  Kyle smiled.  &quot;Now you get it.  He should be home soon, and then I can take him down.  Though it needs to be a surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not do it over the phone, like you did with me?&quot;  Jen watched through Kyle&#39;s eyes as he began to scan the garden on either side of the porch, looking for something.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were a means to an end.  Eric was my true target.  But I can&#39;t act against him directly, you&#39;re going to fix that for me.  Ah, there it is.&quot;  Kyle bent down and picked up a rock, tugging off the spare key taped to the bottom of it.  Eric only told certain people about that key.  Kyle laughed at Jen&#39;s shock.  &quot;We used to be friends, I&#39;ve known about that key for years..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Used to be?&quot;  Jen could feel Kyle tense up at the question as he unlocked the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you even know how Transform or Dare works?  Or are you as much of an air head as everyone thinks?&quot;  Kyle started climbing the stairs, making his way towards Eric&#39;s room as if he knew exactly where it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I.. well.. What does that have to do with anything?&quot;  Jen was starting to feel truly exposed, unable to hide anything from Kyle.  Then again, she was comforted by the fact as long as their minds were meeting he couldn&#39;t hide his emotions either.  And right now he felt angry, excited and eager all at once.<br />
<br />
&quot;You get to use it only after someone uses it on you.  So to use it one you, someone had to use it on me.&quot;  Kyle pushed open Eric&#39;s bedroom door and slid inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric?&quot;  Jen was getting nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not as stupid as you act.  Well.  Not completely.&quot;  Kyle looked in a mirror so Jen could see his grinning face through his own eyes.  Then a thought occurred to Jen, and of course Kyle knew what that thought was.  Perhaps the fact it didn&#39;t worry him should have tipped her off.  But she was so elated she acted before thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;  Jen hoped it worked through thought.<br />
<br />
Kyle just laughed.  &quot;I was waiting for that.  Remember, you still have to do what I tell you for another.. Oh.... 14 hours or so?&quot;  He sat down on the edge of Eric&#39;s bed, seemingly unconcerned as his seconds ticked away.  &quot;I&#39;m not going to answer.  And when time runs out you&#39;ll give me both.  Except you&#39;ll tell me I can set my own transformation and dare.&quot;  Jen wanted to scream, she wanted to throw something, she wanted to punch and kick.  All that pent up rage only did one thing, made the large cock her body had become give one slight twitch.  &quot;Not a great way to convince me to let you go, Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
She settled herself, still seething but holding back most of her rage.  And as the minute ticked away, without any prompting she muttered in her thoughts as if through clenched teeth.  &quot;You get both.  You can choose your own transformation and dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle leaped off the end of the bed, positively giddy.  &quot;Perfect!  Okay, for my dare.  I dare myself to no longer have to follow the dare given to me by Eric Davies.&quot;  Both Kyle and Jen felt a constriction lifting from his mind.  Jen didn&#39;t know the exact nature of the dare, but she could understand how happy Kyle was.  &quot;Second, for the transformation, undo the transformation given to me by Eric Davies, but leave Jennifer Smith&#39;s transformation untouched.&quot;  Jennifer wanted to throw another screaming fit, but Kyle&#39;s emotions overwhelmed hers as he ran over to the mirror.  Already some changes were happening to his face.  His acne was clearing up, his pale skin slowly taking on a healthier tan.  He was also looking older, his jaw more formed, his brows heavier, there was even a bit of dark blond stubble growing in along his jaw.  Something about the face seemed almost familiar to Jen, but she could place it.  But that feeling of familiarity when felt by Kyle only served to make him more excited.  &quot;Don&#39;t strain yourself.  You&#39;ll remember soon enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stepped back from the mirror, getting a better view of his whole body.  The small shirt he had been wearing was now stretched taut over his expanding frame, he must have packed on at least twenty pounds in the last few seconds, much of it muscle.  The rest was just size.  He looked a bit stretched out, taller.  A few inches of flat stomach could be seen between his shirt and the waist of his pants, and a another couple of inches past the bottom of his jeans.  Both Jen and Kyle were seemingly turned on by the sight, making the foot long cock shoved down his pants suddenly swell to full erection, pushing the already strained pants past their breaking point.  The button flew off the jeans, plinking against the mirror as the zipper tore open allow the massive erection to flop free.  The pants had just enough give to drop to the floor, revealing new more muscular legs and a pubic bush that was slightly fuller than it was when Jen had seen it this morning.  Kyle kicked off his shoes and the remains of his pants just in time for his feet to swell five sizes in a matter of seconds, his hands suddenly grew as well to large masculine mitts.  It was like watching some perverse form of puberty in fast forward.<br />
<br />
His face had become even more masculine and rugged as his height soared to 6&#39;1&quot; from 5&#39;5&quot;.  Suddenly, Jen knew that face.  &quot;Kyle?  Oh god.. how did I forget?&quot;  She knew exactly who he was.  Yes, he was Kyle Perkins, but it was a different Kyle she remembered now.  Eric wasn&#39;t captain of the football team.  Kyle was, at least it seemed until Eric got him out of the way.  How could she have forgotten the guy she was practically throwing herself at a few weeks ago, the one she had started dating Eric to get closer to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. That&#39;s what started this mess.&quot;  Kyles voice had taken on a deeper tone.  No longer cracking.  He peeled his shirt off over his head, revealing the developing musculature of his torso, his thickening arms, and the slight trail of hair growing up the middle of his abs.  &quot;Eric though I was trying to steal you, all his jealousy against me was let out in one go.  I told him I didn&#39;t want you, he of course didn&#39;t believe me.  My best friend.&quot;  Kyle rubbed his chest, pressing against his forming pectorals.  &quot;So I told him why.  Gay.  Totally gay.  Didn&#39;t know he was such a homophobe.  He let go with a transform or dare on me.  I laughed it off.  So he turned me into that scrawny runt, made everyone think that was the real me.  The only ones that could remember the old me were him and myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gay?&quot;  But we...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle cut Jen off.  &quot;Turned me straight, too.  Said he&#39;d at least let me be that much of a man.  Fucking homophobe.&quot;  Hair darkened on his arms a legs, a faint dusting spreading on his chest between his pecs and around his nipples.  His muscles giving slight twitches as they grew their last little bit.  Jen knew if she still had her pussy it would have been wet.  Gone was the runty, nerdy, fourteen year old Kyle.  The real Kyle was back, the eighteen year old senior she knew, one of the hottest guys in school, and as she could feel through his thoughts, completely gay as he had said.  That explained why none of the girls could pin him down.  They thought he was just picky.<br />
<br />
Kyle started digging through Eric&#39;s dresser and pulled on a pair of mesh shorts, and a t-shirt that was a bit small for him, hugging every muscle he had.  &quot;It&#39;s why I have to cut this so close.  Can&#39;t let Eric know people suddenly remember me.  If I know him, and I do.  He was driving home this whole time, riding down the road in that truck of his, music blaring still cooling down from a couple hours in the weight room.&quot;  Jen knew it as well as Kyle.  Eric would get home, take a shower, then probably call Jen trying to get a blow job or some sex.  &quot;And now thanks to you, the Transform or Dare is mine to use again.  He had dared me that I couldn&#39;t use it on him, but now that restriction is gone, once again, thanks to you.&quot;  They heard the front door open and close, and Eric&#39;s heavy foot falls suddenly bounding up the stairs.  Kyle quickly ducked into the closet, shutting the door behind him and peering out the slats.<br />
<br />
Eric stepped into the room.  His black hair wet with sweat and plastered to his head, still dressed in his workout clothes.  He pulled his shirt over his head and tossed it aside revealing his muscular chest and his light forest of dark chest hair.  He turned his back on the closet and Kyle didn&#39;t waist anymore time.  He bounded out of the closet and tackled his former best friend, pinning him to the floor.  &quot;Transform or Dare, fucker.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first word out of Eric&#39;s mouth was, &quot;Kyle?&quot;  The second...</p>
