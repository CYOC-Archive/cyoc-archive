<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Judy looked at the balloon and contemplated on how she should use it.  She realized that with the power she had she could get back at Jim for everything he has done and he would not be able to do a thing about it.  She then looked back at Jim and saw how small, helpless and scared he looked as a little toddler and she felt disgusted with the thought of taking advantage of him in such a pitiful state.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what fine, I will make you older.&quot;  She said with a resigned sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;  Jim said, looking hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;But,&quot;  she added.  &quot;Not all the way.&quot;  She finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why, why won&#39;t you make me my normal age?&quot;  Jim asked with a whine.<br />
<br />
&quot;One, I still want to get back at you for everything you did to me.  Two, no matter what you are still my brother and everything you did to me was not enough to leave you like this.&quot;  She answered sternly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is, unless you would rather stay like this?&quot;  She asked with a grin which left Jim fearful.<br />
<br />
&quot;No no, just being older than a toddler is fine.&quot;  He answered nervously, not wanting to lose hope.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, she added.  &quot;The thought of taking advantage of you when you are just so helpless and afraid made me feel disgusted with myself.  She said.<br />
<br />
Jim was surprised with how nice his sister was treating him, he thought he was a goner when she took the balloon away but she was helping him with his problem instead.  He almost could not believe it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Earth to Jim,&quot;  Judy said which snapped him back to reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you to be older or not.&quot;  She asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yeah,&quot; Jim answered.  &quot;I have to ask though, how old are you going to leave me?&quot;  he questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she began.  &quot;You were 3 years older than me before, so why not leave you 3 years younger than me instead.&quot;  She answered him.<br />
<br />
&quot;6 then.&quot;  Jim confirmed.  &quot;Well, it&#39;s better than being a little toddler.&quot;  He said, resignedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot;  Judy said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Jim began.  &quot;How will you be able to know if I am at the right age on sight?&quot;  He asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, good point.&quot;  She said.  &quot;Wait, I have an idea.&quot;  She said with excitement.  &quot;Why don&#39;t we use the marks our Mom made on the edge of the wall downstairs as we grew up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That...might just work.&quot;  Jim said with a little excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, now let&#39;s hurry, my friends will be coming over soon and if we are quick enough then you will be able to retreat to your room before they get here.&quot;  She said as she grabbed his too big shirt and handed it to him, to his confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is not going to fit me.&quot;  Jim said in annoyance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to be naked when you grow back up?&quot;  She asked rhetorically while she picked up my too big shorts and underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, she began as she stood back up.  &quot;I know what I&#39;m doing, so you will just have to trust me.&quot;  She said to him with a smile.<br />
<br />
Shrugging, Jim turned away from his sister and put on his shirt.  Just like before, it fell nearly to his ankles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, he began as a problem just occurred to him.  &quot;How will I be able to go down the stairs when I am this small?&quot;  He asked.  His answer came when he was gently picked up from behind by his sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said,&quot; she began as lifted him to near eye level, turned him around to face her, placed one arm underneath his legs, the other around his shoulder-blades and held him against her chest.  &quot;I know what I&#39;m doing, you will just have to trust me.&quot;  She said to him with a smile and a gentle, almost motherly tone which left him a little embarrassed.  Before she walked out the door with him, he had wrapped his arms around her neck without thinking.<br />
<br />
Jim had to admit, as embarrassing as it was to be carried, it did not dislike it.  As Judy carried him out of his room and to the stairs, he began to feel warm, safe and secure in her arms.  When she began to climb down the stairs, she did so with the upmost of care, which he was glad for.  When they made it down, Judy carried him over to the edge of the wall in the living room where there were marks made to show our growth over the years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here we are, our growth lines.&quot;  She said as she gently set him back down to the floor and dropped his shorts and underwear near him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to ask though,&quot;  she began.  &quot;It felt good to be carried like that didn&#39;t it?  She asked me with a somewhat mischievous smile.  Jim flushed a bit and turned away  from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a little.&quot;  He admitted, embarrassed.  She flashed a knowing smirk and turned to the growth marks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now where is your 6 year mark, oh here it is.&quot;  She said as she pointed to a mark that was around shoulder height to her but to Jim it seemed far above his head.  It was just all too weird to see a growth mark that he passed 6 years ago so far above him in height.  He was glad he was not going to be so small anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait here, I will go find a ruler and tape measure.&quot;  Judy said and made her way to the kitchen.  Jim took the time to look around his the living room as he waited.  Just like in his room everything seemed so large to him.  He could not even remember the living room being so large.  Soon enough, Judy had come back with a ruler and tape measure in hand and had taken out the balloon from her pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Jim,&quot; she began.  &quot;Ready to grow up a bit?&quot;  She asked him with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, the sooner the better.&quot;  he replied to her with a little excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, here we go.&quot;  She said and brought the balloon closer to her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Control, Jim&#39;s age.&quot;  She said and blew into the balloon.<br />
<br />
It was happening, he was finally growing up!  He could feel it as the oversized shirt he wore seemed to shrink on his body as he grew.  With every breath she blew, he grew taller.  With each breath, he grew stronger.  With every breath, he became more well developed.  With a couple of breaths, the help of the ruler and a few adjustments, Judy gave a satisfied smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect.&quot;  She said, signifying that I was at the target age.  &quot;Release.&quot;  She said and let the air out of the balloon, which lucky, he did not shrink to.  Using the tape measure, Judy found that Jim was now 3&#39;9&quot;.  Jim was just glad he was not so small anymore.  The shirt he wore which fell nearly to his ankles earlier now fell above his knees.  Which unfortunately meant it was still too big.<br />
<br />
&quot;My clothes still don&#39;t fit though.&quot;  He said to his sister, glad his voice while now childish in pitch, did not sound like a baby&#39;s anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was about to get to that.&quot;  She replied as she picked up my shorts and underwear and gave them to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Put these on and hold the waistbands up to your waistline.&quot;  She said to me, which he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;What now,&quot;  he asked her.  &quot;I cannot hold these forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot;  She replied and she began to blow up the balloon.  She stopped with several breaths and said, &quot;Control, Jim&#39;s clothing size,&quot; and slowly let out the air.<br />
<br />
Jim felt his cloths shift all around his body and in his hands ans they shrank smaller onto his body.  Soon enough, my clothes shrank to a comfortable fit onto my smaller body and I let go of my shorts and underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Release.&quot;  she said and she let the rest of the air out and put the balloon into her pocket.  Jim looked down at the clothes he wore, glad that they now fit his smaller body.  He then looked up to Judy, seeing the height difference between them, he slumped a bit.  While he was now bigger than he was as a toddler, at 6 years old and Judy being 4&#39;8&quot; in height, Jim was still only about eye level to Judy&#39;s chest so he still had to look up to meet her eyes.  Not only that, everything around him still seemed much bigger than normal.  He then tuned away from his sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s got you down?&quot;  She asks him.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just weird that I am not the big brother anymore.&quot;  He admitted to her, which made Judy feel a little bad for him.  Suddenly, Judy had an idea to cheer Jim up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me,&quot; she said as she took is smaller hand into hers and gently led him further into the living room to the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing.&quot;  Jim asked when they stopped at the couch.  Without warning, Judy grabbed Jim and with surprising strength, threw him onto the couch.  When he turned to face her, she had pounced on top of him before he could react, pinning him down.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing!?&quot;  He asked her startled by her actions.  Her response was a grin along with raising her hands and wriggling her fingers.  Panicking, Jim tried to dislodge her with all of the strength he could muster.  Unfortunately in his current state, she was bigger than he was, stronger than he was, and nearly twice his weight; in short his efforts were futile.  She then began to tickle any exposed spot on his body she could get to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, wait ha ha ha, Judy, shop, stop, ha ha ha.&quot;  He managed to say while laughing hard and having trouble breathing as Judy ticked him nearly all over while he was pinned down.  Every time he tried to block her hands from one part of his body, she would simply move on to another part.  After what felt like several minutes.  Judy stopped tickling him and let him up to catch his breath.  As Jim was catching his breath, he felt strangely exhilarated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feeling better?&quot;  Judy asked him when he had caught his breath.  Jim flushed a bit and turned away from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe a little.&quot;  He answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; she said and Jim felt her arms drape onto him and she hugged him from behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um Judy, what are you doing?&quot;  Jim asked embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;  She began.  &quot;Is a big sister not allowed to hug her cute little brother?&quot;  She asked rhetorically.  Jim, while embarrassed, felt strangely warm in her embrace and did not have the heart to break out.  After what felt like several minutes, the moment ended when the doorbell rang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she she began.  &quot;My friends are here, so you better retreat to your room while you are at it.&quot;  She finished.  Jim nodded and made his way to the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, one last thing,&quot;  She began just before Jim made it to the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;  He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you are good, I will age you back all the way to your normal age in the evening.&quot;  She said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;  Jim asked with excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really, now you better hurry to your room.&quot;  She replied, then Jim made his way to the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are not going to show me to your friends are you?&quot;  Jim asked her at the foot of the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;No promises.&quot;  She said with a smirk, which he then ran up the stairs as fast as he could.  While not as fast as when he was 12, he could at least move up the stairs.<br />
<br />
Jim had made it to his room and close the door just right as Judy was letting her friends in.  He made his way to the mirror to look as himself.  A cute kid of 6 looked back at him.  Sighing, he looked around his room and wondered what he could do when he is younger.  Though he is worried what would happen if Judy wanted to show him to her friends.</p>
