<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Just the director&#39;s cut.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Uhhh….” Jeff swallowed and blurted out the first job that came to mind. “Accountant!”<br />
<br />
There was a click and whir from the machine, along with a steadily building hum as something inside of it powered up. Jeff waited with baited breath as the machine processed his request. Even Mr. Walters was eyeing the machine, a slight frown on his face. Had his Principal wanted him to get defaulted?!<br />
<br />
“Occupation selected.” The machine dinged cheerily. “Accountant-Using Default Accountant stats.”<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed in relief. At least he’d managed to choose his occupation. Anyways, accountant was a solid choice. They got paid really well and-<br />
<br />
“Default stats are:…” The machine continued in a perky tone. “…Homosexual. Overweight. Bald. Small Penis. Bad Eyesight. Drinker. Smoker.” <br />
<br />
“What?!” Jeff’s eyes bulged in horror. “How are those the fucking defaults?”<br />
<br />
“Hahahaha!” Mr. Walters gave a belly laugh. “Sorry to tell you, but you took too long to decide. Have a nice molding!”<br />
<br />
Mr. Walters was still laughing as he left the room. Jeff heard the door lock. His heart pounded in terror as he heard the humming noise within the machine begin to build, the barrel of what looked like a laser attached to a robotic arm on the machine swiveling and pointing at his head.<br />
<br />
Jeff struggled in the restraints. They were only Velcro, but they were surprisingly tight and difficult to escape from. He tugged and tugged, hearing the machine above him powering up. Across the room was a sink with a metal paper towel dispense. He could see the machine’s LED display in the reflection, and saw it counting down. <br />
<br />
59…58…57…<br />
<br />
He cursed and tugged harder. Jeff shot a quick glance at the countdown, noticing the humming grow louder. <br />
<br />
49…48…47…<br />
<br />
He yanked and yanked and heard something give. The Velcro strap felt much looser now. Jeff checked and noticed the plastic ‘eye’ the Velcro had been threaded to had deformed, the plastic stretching. He clenched his teeth and pulled his arm. With a snap, the Velcro cuff came loose. <br />
<br />
Jeff quickly reached over to his other arm and undid the strap. He got to his feet and went to the door. Locked. He glanced at the LED. <br />
<br />
14…13…12…<br />
<br />
Shit! No time.<br />
<br />
He looked around frantically for someplace to hide. The room was mostly empty save for the machine with the laser barrel, which was still targeting him in spite of his escape. Maybe rip off the metal towel dispenser, deflect the laser? No, that wouldn’t work, it was screwed to the wall.<br />
<br />
The humming was building to a crescendo. Jeff’s eyes fell on the one thing in the room big enough for him to hide behind…..the chair he’d been strapped to!<br />
<br />
3...2…1…<br />
<br />
Jeff dove behind the chair just as the beam fired. It was red and warm where it caught the top of his head. Jeff knelt close behind the chair, pressing himself to it so the beam had no target. The tingling receded the moment he was out of the beam’s sight. With a shaking hand, he reached up and found his hair thinner at the top of his head where the beam hit him, loose hairs floating away to the floor. <br />
The beam hit the chair and the leather started growing warm, warping as the transformative ray did its work. <br />
<br />
Jeff could only watch in horror as he saw the form that the machine had intended for him. The arms of the chair slowly plumped, the leather softening into pale white skin, Pudgy hands appeared, a forest of hair trailing from the knuckles and top of the hand, thick and long, and traveled up the arm in tandem with the path of the laser.<br />
<br />
The beam moved in methodical fashion, traveling around the chair’s prone form. It cut across the body of the chair, moving towards the legs. The chair warped and swelled, a chest and pecs plopping out into existence, growing huge and thick with soft fat before sagging into a rather hairy gut and moobs. It got to the legs and they stuck together, growing into two fat limbs with cankles.<br />
<br />
Jeff pressed himself tighter to the chair as it transformed. As the beam moved towards the crotch of the new accountant, Jeff had to control his breathing so the machine wouldn’t detect him. The leather against his face grew warm and began to swell. He soon found his face pressed between two pillowy mounds of flesh.<br />
<br />
With a  mix of disgust and horror, he realized his face was wedged in the chair-turned accountant’s ass crack. He wanted to pull away, but moving at this point would expose him to the laser. So he kept still, praying the laser would move on to the last thing that remained unchanged, the headrest.<br />
<br />
He stared in morbid fascination, a pleasant warmth engulfing his face, as the flesh in front of him began to swirl and sink in on itself, forming an asshole. Jeff let out his breath and breathed in the smell of musk as the skin in the crevice began to pucker and clench. The smell was oddly…pleasant, deep and robust and rather earthy. <br />
<br />
An urge struck him. <br />
<br />
What did an asshole taste like?  It was a chair, the asshole should be completely clean, after all. What would a little taste hurt? His face throbbed gently as his pressed deeper into the forming ass crack, his tongue extended. He gave the new hole a lick, savoring the organ’s flavor.<br />
<br />
The flesh around him was growing hairy, Jeff’s 5 o’clock shadow bristling against it. It nice and warm here, the hole a little moist. The space between the swelling ass was growing a bit tight, so Jeff reached his hands up, gripping the flabby flesh firmly and spread the cheeks wide, giving him better access.  The warmth intensified and the waves of pleasure rolling across his face seemed to only increase as he ate that hot ass out. <br />
<br />
He sucked and lapped at the ass, kissing it with his rubbery lips, his jowls slowly sagging as he did. <br />
<br />
Jeff’s tongue drilled deeper as pleasant tingles continued to engulf his head. A hair fell on his nose, making it twitch. He brushed it away as more hair began to fall around him. His hand reached up and brushed more stray hairs off the top of his severely receded hairline. That should have bothered him, but the ass in front of Jeff had his full attention. <br />
<br />
The warmth and tingles started to fade as the beam moved away, up towards the headrest of the chair. Jeff kept lapping at the twitching pucker, hoping the hot guy the chair was turning into would appreciate it. He’d love it if it were him. Afterwards, he’d have himself a beer and a cigarette and just relax on the couch…<br />
<br />
Jeff’s mind stumbled a bit at that. It sounded pleasant but oddly…wrong. Did he even like the taste of ass? The body above him twitched to life, drawing its first breath. Jeff gave the hole a light sniff and the deeply musky aroma rather appealing. He gave it another lick and swished his tongue around, finding the savory flavor rather satisfying. <br />
<br />
He heard the naked hairy man above him moan in pleasure. <br />
<br />
The man turned his head, glancing behind him, eyes focusing on Jeff. He was bald, only a ring of shaved hair left, and obviously overweight, with sagging jowls and a doublechin that even the beard he’d grown out couldn’t conceal. All in all, a rather handsome middle aged man. With a smile, Jeff lapped at the hole again, his short beard rubbing the side of the man’s ass.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, yeah, that feels good!” The man groaned, reaching behind him and placing his hand on Jeff’s bald patch, rubbing it and pressing him deeper into his crack. “Keep going!”<br />
<br />
Wait, his bald patch? Had he always been bald? Jeff was confused but with the pudgy hand on the back of his head, he could only eat that ass out with gusto. The man above him moaned happily and Jeff couldn&#39;t help but feel a bit hot about the hole thing. <br />
<br />
“Physical and mental changes completed.” The machine’s cheery, mechanical voice echoed in the room. “Applying proper attire.”<br />
<br />
Jeff continued pleasuring the obese man as the laser moved from his head-where a pair of thick glasses appeared-then continued down his body, laser-printing a button down shirt and vest. The pleasant warmth and gentle wave of tingles enveloped Jeff’s head again as the laser targeted the obese man’s crotch. He pulled away as a pair of tightie whities wrapped itself around the man’s crotch and a pair of slacks painted itself on the man’s ass, a belt slithering into place and securing it to his hips. <br />
<br />
While the man unbuckled his belt, Jeff adjusted his glasses. As the man shifted to get his pants down, Jeff was momentarily exposed. While the obese guy fumbled with the belt buckle, the laser finished crafting his slacks and shoes. The machine whirred and clicked, swiveling to and fro before centering on him.<br />
<br />
“Resuming molding.” The machine spoke cheerily.<br />
<br />
Dimly, Jeff heard the machine speak. He wondered what else about the man needed to be changed. The man continued fumbling his belt and Jeff sighed impatiently. There was a hum, and then a red light illuminated his face. <br />
<br />
It was soothing and gentle, making his face tingle pleasurably. The back of his neck tickled and Jeff reached back, ruffling and dislodging the last of the hair on his head, leaving him rubbing a smooth, bald dome. Jeff moaned as the gentle waves envelop his face, making his cheeks puff a bit further, crow’s feet etching themselves into the corners of his eyes and wrinkles furrowing his brow.<br />
<br />
The tingles engulfed his brain, making Jeff shiver. He felt tired as thoughts of spreadsheets and tax write offs filled his mind. There was something off about that, but the pleasant waves gently massaged his worries away, shaping them into lust for the hot obese man in front of him.  Jeff sighed, happy the bear seemed so eager to fuck. He let himself relax, his mind washed away by gentle ripples of pleasure. <br />
<br />
Yeah, after sucking this guy off, he’d definitely be getting a smoke.<br />
<br />
The beam moved lower down his neck, and Jeff’s face was pulled with it, sagging a bit. His chin swelled with fat and his Adam’s apple grew more prominent. Further and further it went, hair tickling as it sprouted along the path of the beam. His nipples puffed and enlarged, hair ringing them, then spreading across his chest as it filled with fat. The beam continued lower, dragging his breasts down as they sagged into moobs.<br />
<br />
Jeff reached up, fondling his soft chest flesh. The light lingered on his moobs as Jeff felt himself up, the warm light tingling his nipples. He tweaked them with puffy hands, impatient for the bear to pull his pants down so he could suck him off. The tingles intensified and Jeff gasped, jolts of pleasure shooting from his nipple straight to his cock.<br />
<br />
Under his fingers, the tips of his nips swelled thicker and longer. Jeff moaned as the flesh swelled out and puffed. His moobs grew thicker and fuller, becoming proper mantits. Each brush against his incredibly tender nipples had him gasping and moaning. His nips grew ever longer and thicker until they were easily the size of eraser heads.<br />
<br />
The light moved on. <br />
<br />
It swept down to his belly and his stomach tingled nicely as it bloated under the warm light. Jeff burped softly as a feeling of fullness enveloped him. He reached down and pressed his fingers into the soft, pliable fat, his hands plumping as the light enveloped them. His belly swelled larger and larger until it sagged into a hefty, hairy beer belly. <br />
<br />
The light drifted lower, centering on his crotch.<br />
<br />
Jeff moaned as the warm red light gently pressed his cock back into him in waves. His proud seven-incher was slowly reduced to three inches long, tingling as it shrunk under the light of the ray. The light tucked his small cock under his belly, a fold of fat slumping over it and his groin engulfing it. Once his dick was snugly nestled in a cradle of lard, the beam moved to his balls. Jeff moaned as they bloated and sagged. There was something wrong with this, but it all felt so good, how could he-<br />
<br />
And then the obese man stepped in front of the light, his pants down, his own small cock dribbling precum. <br />
<br />
Jeff blinked, the warmth receding and his thoughts clearing. What had just happened? He’d been watching the hot bear struggle with his belt. Then a weird light had hit him and-<br />
<br />
“Target lost. Attempting to reacquire.” A cheery, robotic voice said.<br />
<br />
Wait, had the laser hit him? He glanced down at his fat, sagging form. Perfectly normal, right? But there was something else that told him it was wrong, too.<br />
<br />
“Hey, pal.” The man above him smirked.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked up and saw the cock. It was nice and hard and wet with pre.<br />
<br />
“Come on, give it a taste.” The bear waggled his hips.<br />
<br />
Jeff bent forward, raising a pudgy hand and gently pressing the ring of fat surrounding the cock back. He leaned forward and began tonguing the cock. The handsome bear above him moaned, leaning back, giving Jeff full access-and exposing his relatively unchanged lower half.<br />
<br />
Distantly, he heard a cheery voice again. Warmth suffused his lower half again, filling him with pleasant tingles. His legs and thighs bloated, ankles becoming cankles. His feet puffed, hair sprouting from their tops. Jeff’s stomach began to feel nice and full again, the warmth massaging him. A burp escaped his mouth in a warm puff of pure satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Jeff moaned around the cock, loving the light little waves the fat of his body made while he bobbed. His entire body jiggled. Then he felt the bottom of his belly grow cold. He looked down and saw his gut resting on the floor. Jeff leaned back, lifting his gut, playing with the fat as he gently sucked on the other bear’s cock. His belly started to round out, fat growing firmer, jutting out more spherically. Angry red stretch marks zig-zagged across his skin, then were soothed and faded to the same pale white of the rest of his skin as though he’d been fat for years. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, that’s it, look at me.” The other bear said, lifting Jeff’s face up. <br />
<br />
Jeff smiled up at him and then licked the tip of his dick, making the bear shudder and moan.<br />
<br />
“You’re so goddamn handsome.” The bear said.<br />
<br />
“You too. I’m Jeff.”<br />
<br />
“Kevin.” The man breathed a happy sigh. “Time to return the favor.”<br />
<br />
The handsome bear got down on his knees. Kevin spread Jeff’s legs as Jeff laid back and lifted his gut, giving the man better access. His big, soft hand pressed the fat around Jeff’s small dick back, exposing a leaking head that was almost lost in the riot of pubic hair around it.<br />
<br />
“God, a love men with small penises.” Kevin said, suckling gently on the head of Jeff’s little cock, tongue swirling around it.<br />
<br />
“You do?” Jeff moaned, puffy hand pressing Kevin’s head firmly into his soft gunt. He rubbed his lover’s bald pate, enjoying the smooth surface under his fingers as they slid over it. “I wish it was smaller.”<br />
<br />
The beam concentrated on his crotch again. <br />
<br />
Warm waves vibrated his dicklet. Jeff moaned and gasped, the pleasure diffusing throughout his body. As Kevin’s tongue worked at his dicklet, it started feeling oddly bigger. Jeff was confused at first, but the oral sex started feeling even better, like his cock was concentrating all the nerves in one place.<br />
<br />
Three inches became two. Two ever so gently became one. Warm, orgasmic feelings rolled through Jeff’s groin as the warm red light slowly and gently pressed his dick further back into him. All he could do was moan and clutch Kevin’s head deep into his gunt, wrapping his thighs around him to hold Kevin in place. <br />
<br />
As he writhed, the shaft vanished completely and was only the stubby mushroom head remained. <br />
<br />
With the pleasant warmth rolling through his sensitive organ, Jeff gasped and a trickle of cum oozed out of him. Kevin lovingly licked the cum from Jeff’s folds. Jeff shuddered, belly wobbling like jelly as another full-body orgasm rolled through him. The hot bear lapped at Jeff’s cockhead, marveling how small it was.<br />
<br />
The beam intensified and with another roll of Kevin’s tongue, he lost track of it, the nub settling far into Jeff’s cozy gunt, far too deep for his tongue to reach.<br />
<br />
“God, this is so hot!” Kevin groaned, finally giving up his search. “I wanna fuck you.”<br />
<br />
“Okay daddy.” Jeff smiled.<br />
<br />
Warm light bathed Jeff’s face as Kevin lifted his legs over his shoulders. His features gently puffed under the light, swelling rounder with fat.  He moaned as lube was applied to his hairy hole, the coolness of it making him shiver. Warm energy soothed him, made his cocklet twitch harder as he felt the thick three inch dick press against his tight pucker. <br />
<br />
He’s going to fuck my tight hole! Jeff thought. His heart leapt for joy.<br />
<br />
“You’re so tight,” Kevin huffed and pressed his glasses up his nose, “Are you a virgin?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah daddy.” Jeff blurted.<br />
<br />
“Not for long,” Kevin growled, rubbing his cock between Jeff’s flabby asscheeks.<br />
<br />
The beam centered on Kevin’s cock as it prodded his ring. <br />
<br />
Jeff’s ass grew warm and swelled, growing hairy, bulbous, and wide. His hole felt strange and tingly, then spasmed pleasantly. As Jeff’s nub quivered, Kevin’s cock grew longer and thicker, his balls sagging heavily as they grew in his sack. Kevin’s thick dick gently parted his slackening ring of flesh, sliding into him as though it belonged there.<br />
<br />
And it did. <br />
<br />
The beam re-centered on Jeff’s head while Kevin fucked him right. Memories of making love to the big-dicked bear gently inserted themselves into his mind in tandem with Kevin’s fat cock. They were so pleasant that Jeff’s ring simply relaxed, his piss-slit oozing precum. <br />
<br />
“Oh, daddy,” Jeff groaned, rubbing his hands over his fellow accountant’s hairy back. <br />
<br />
Jeff moaned happily as Kevin bucked his hips, smoothly gliding past his prostate. He couldn’t deny the nice full feeling his hole was experiencing. For some reason, he thought this was supposed to be bad, but it felt so right. He simply smiled and pressed into the big cock stretching his hole nicely.<br />
<br />
Years of working as an accountant, using that knowledge he’d been gifted filled his mind. Friends faded into the distant past, hobbies grew unimportant, and then further as the waves gently eroded his old life away.  Jeff felt panic rise as his interests disappeared. <br />
<br />
Then Jeff moaned in relief as his memory of coming here to get molded faded far into his past. Ten years, twenty…he sagged, relaxing as years of memories piled on top of it. <br />
<br />
They were pleasant, comfortable thoughts, long nights spent doing spreadsheets and eating fast food. Jeff burped again, patting his belly. It felt more and more natural as the years went by. He woke up with it every day after all.<br />
<br />
As he grew more comfortable with his new body, the light spread. He grunted as his balls swelled, more dense hair curling across his body. Jeff burped again, stomach gently wobbling as it grew bigger from years of smoking and drinking. White flecks appeared in his beard as it discolored with nicotine stains. <br />
<br />
Then handsome bear on top of him stretched his hole wide, filled him deep. Kevin kissed him deeply.  Jeff relaxed, enjoying the fullness and kissed his lover back. All he needed was right here. A steady job, a fat cock in his ass, and a handsome man groping him.<br />
<br />
“God, you’re so hot.” Jeff murmured into the kiss.<br />
<br />
“You’re so perfect. I love you.” Kevin murmured back.<br />
 <br />
Jeff felt his saggy balls begin to clench.<br />
<br />
“I love you too!” Jeff moaned desperately as a warm , radiant, full-bodied orgasm overtook him.<br />
<br />
He felt his lover slam his cock home one final time. The spasms of Jeff’s hole sent Kevin over the edge. His cock bucked deep in Jeff’s hole and cum gushed in thick spurts. <br />
<br />
Jeff felt warmth flood his insides and moaned happily as his lover ground his cock deep inside of him. Then Kevin pulled out, a trickle of warm seed following his fat cock out, oozing from Jeff’s slack hole. Jeff was too tired to clench it closed. They lay panting on the ground, holding hands as the afterglow began to fade.<br />
<br />
A final memory gently inserted itself into Jeff’s head as a thick gold wedding band appeared on one thick digit.<br />
<br />
As he firmly settled into the life of a fat hairy bear in his forties, Jeff found something he was missing: a husbear. Zach and Jeff continued to kiss, their bodies jiggling as the light played across them. Back hair sprouted, muscles grew and withered. <br />
<br />
 A few minutes later, they got up off the floor and cleaned themselves up, looking presentable.<br />
<br />
Light played across Jeff’s fat form, dressing him in appropriate attire. Cum and sweat from his exertions vanished. He squirmed as a pair of tight white briefs wrapped themselves around his puffy crotch. His new slacks rose up over his belly and belted itself, leaving him with a rather round shape. <br />
<br />
Jess could feel his husbear’s cock grow erect, tenting his slacks. He gave it a rub with his hand, heart fluttering as his husband moaned softly into the kiss. Tingles still zipped through his brain as his old life faded away, forgotten. While they felt each other up, Jeff even forgot ever going to this school for anything other than doing their books at the end of every quarter.<br />
<br />
“Hey sweetheart, when we’re done with the books, wanna go find a nice Italian place?” Jeff asked, taking Kevin’s big, soft hand in his.<br />
<br />
“Of course, babe,” Kevin smiled and pulled Jeff into a long, loving kiss. <br />
<br />
Their soft bodies pressed into eachother sensuously. <br />
<br />
The light and tingles shut off.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
A knock came from the door before it opened. Jeff and Kevin drew apart when Mr. Walters walked in. He looked at the two of them in surprise.<br />
<br />
“Jeff?” Mr. Walters asked, looking between the two heavyset men, one much fatter than the other.<br />
<br />
“Yes?” Jeff replied.<br />
<br />
Mr. Walters looked him up and down, a grin spreading across his face. <br />
<br />
Jeff was the epitome of a bottom bear. His mantits were heavy, the nipples thick and protruding clearly from his shirt. The rest of his body thick with fat, his belly huge and round. Even though he had facial hair, he’d retained a sort of boyish, feminine look to his face.<br />
<br />
“You’ve certainly filled out well, I see.”<br />
<br />
“No thanks to my husband,” Jeff said, looking at Kevin and sharing a smile.<br />
<br />
“Your…husband?”<br />
<br />
“I’m Kevin,” The other accountant stepped forward and extended a hand.<br />
<br />
Kevin, unlike Jeff was clearly more masculine and obviously the top. He was certainly less fat, his face harder, with a glint in his eyes that made him appear somehow stern. There was a sizable lump in Kevin’s pants that spoke of a huge cock and balls. <br />
<br />
Mr. Walters glanced down at the large bulge in the man’s slacks and smirked before shaking his hand, “Pleasure to meet you Kevin. What brings you here?”<br />
<br />
“Just helping my Jeff with the books. No extra fees” Kevin smiled, holding up a hand to forestall any protests.<br />
<br />
“Of course, that shouldn’t be an issue.” Mr. Walters gestured for them to follow him, “the books are right this way.”<br />
<br />
The two accountants followed him out.<br />
<br />
Mr. Walters turned off the lights in the Molding Room and shut the door.<br />
<br />
“So, as you can see, gentleman…” Mr. Walter’s voice droned.</p>
