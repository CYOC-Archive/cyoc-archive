<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maddy spent almost ten minutes staring at herself in the mirror, a large smirk plastered across her face. All those years of having a slightly below average chest were over, she now had a slightly above average rack! She loved the way they looked on her body, especially in this bikini top, they looked amazing! The only thing bothering her was that damn piggy tail. It stuck out and was so obvious… but if a pigs tail was the price to pay for bigger boobs, she could probably make an exception.<br />
As she was checking herself out however, she managed to drop one of her cards. The change card.<br />
She leaned down to pick it up… but it was blank.<br />
“Huh?” She said to herself. <br />
She turned over her action card, ‘No Action Applies’. She moved her eyes back to the card she’d dropped.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
“NOOOOOO!” Louis heard his sister yell from across the house. He was familiar with that sound. Whether it was being broken up with by some asshole boy or finding out a celebrity had a bad haircut; Maddy was the queen of overreacting. He didn’t really have an interest on what happened, so he just sat back and waited for her to run back in the room.<br />
<br />
However, Maddy didn’t return. For at least five more minutes, Louis sat there, awaiting his sister to come running in over something completely pointless. Yet she didn’t.<br />
“I-is it my turn?” He whispered to himself, wondering if he should just take his cards and keep playing.<br />
 The engraving changed again, ‘Yes.’<br />
“O-oh… cool,” he said, reading the lettering. As he grabbed his cards, he asked, “what’re the limits to the kind of things I can ask you?”<br />
‘I Know Everything. Ask Me Anything.’<br />
“Alright… would Penelope West ever be interested in me?”<br />
‘Yes.’<br />
“Shit, really!?” Louis said,<br />
‘Yes.’<br />
“W-why?”<br />
‘She Would Not Like Your Personality.’<br />
“Oh…”<br />
‘But She Is Into Larger Men.’<br />
“Wow…” Louis said, looking down at his belly, poking just out of his original loose fitting shirt, “maybe being a little fat isn’t so bad,” he joked. Then looked ahead of him, realising he was literally talking to a wooden box.<br />
He looked at his action card, ‘Change is Decided by Player (Selection New Action Card)’.<br />
“W-wait I can do anything!?”<br />
‘Yes.’<br />
“Oh my god I… I guess…” his mind flickered back and fourth, but unfortunately his mind was pretty stuck on at being, at least physically, someone Penelope West would be into, “I choose for this card; to weigh the amount that Penelope West would find attractive,”<br />
<br />
As Louis reached over to grab his new action card, Maddy stomped back in the room,<br />
“STUPID GAME!” She shouted. She had her hands covering her chest as he bikini clearly wasn’t supported by anything anymore, “card said ‘Astonishing A-Cup’… BULLSHIT!” She shouted,<br />
“W-wait the game made you lose your new breasts?”<br />
“Obviously, dumbass,” she said grumpily. She looked over and saw him grabbing for the action card, “you were gonna take your turn without me here?”<br />
“You took your turn without me!”<br />
“Whatever,” she sulked,<br />
“Well actually I’ve already got my card. And I got to choose any kind of change,”<br />
“WHAT!?” She said, majorly jealous, “W-what did you choose…”<br />
Louis immediately got a little embarrassed, realising his change was… well it was a little embarrassing.<br />
“What was it!” She pushed him, causing him to drop his action card face up on the ground.<br />
<br />
The two looked down and read it together.<br />
<br />
‘Double Card’<br />
<br />
“Wait what?” He asked, “didn’t you already pull that card?”<br />
“Yeah, but I guess that can repeat,” Maddy shrugged.<br />
Louis looked down at himself, only now realising what was about to happen, “oh no…”<br />
<br />
He felt his chubby body beginning to get even bigger. The majority of the weight went to his belly, causing the t-shirt he was wearing to start riding up again, revealing more of his belly. It grew bulbous like a globe, and following it was his thighs. They thickened and fattened, allowing his calves to follow on. His arms fattening, his face gaining a real double chin as well as just making it appear slightly rounder. And his chest gained two flabby man-boobs. He wasn’t so impressed by the changes.<br />
“You really chose to make yourself fatter!?”<br />
“No!” He yelled, “i-it’s a girl, at college. I guess she likes fat guys,”<br />
“So this is hope fat she would want you,” Maddy said, unimpressed, “weird ass chick,”<br />
“Hey!” He yelled, “she’s super hot,”<br />
“Well I bet she has huge tits too,” she complained, sitting herself down, holding her unfitting bikini over her flat chest.<br />
<br />
Louis was pretty sure the change was over… but something told him he was wrong,<br />
“Uhm…” he said.<br />
Maddy looked over and watched as suddenly her brother gained yet another mass of weight! His belly bulged out, pooling over his legs. His thighs grew like tree-trunks, his arms did very similar. His double chin became a triple chin and his man-boobs almost looked like real boobs. And as he grew, suddenly his shirt tore right down the middle.<br />
<br />
Sitting in his seat was a completely obese man, his chest exposed revealing his dark blonde chest hair. His belly was almost the size of Maddy herself.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit…” Maddy said in awe, “you really are a dumbass.”</p>
