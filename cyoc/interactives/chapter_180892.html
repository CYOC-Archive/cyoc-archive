<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Juliet Renard-Argenté was a bit more comfortable with the second pair of girls from her shelter that had come forward for conversion. She had brought them all while the main building on her estate was being fumigated, though mostly as a precautionary measure. She had long made sure that her home and grounds were well maintained and the staff was well treated, which Juliet found produced happier and more effective workers. This kept her estate clean and free of any trouble, and it had been good for the girls, many of which came to her from impoverished families that couldn&#39;t care for them with their disabilities, many of which were actually inherited. France had a relatively decent economy, and there were times when she felt that people could handle things, and then the families arrived with a young child looking lost and with tears in their eyes. By the time they finished explaining their financial woes, Juliet was often crying too.<br />
<br />
She then poured a lot of her money into caring for them and raising them and helping them grow as people and learn to the best of their ability, and she would invite the families of the girls to come for holidays like Christmas, Easter, and even Bastille Day. Much of it was also to assure that the parents would never lose contact or connections to their children. That also included the notifications on using Horizon&#39;s abilities with the Animalia Virus to convert and heal those in her care. It was met with some support and confidence, which Juliet respected, but also raised worries over other things on how animals could be more vulnerable to parasites and the like. That was what got Juliet to agree to have her entire chateau fumigated to make sure there were no fleas, lice, ticks, bedbugs, or anything else in it. That then won the approval for these conversions. <br />
<br />
Though with Fifi and Mia, some of Juliet&#39;s style had left her worried over their conversions in that they knew about the potential for an Animalian with the Animalian Virus left active could be spread through sex, and once they were assured that becoming an Animalian wouldn&#39;t hurt, Fifi and Mia jumped at that avenue. Juliet did her best to assure that the two that would carry out that conversion wouldn&#39;t take advantage of those that Juliet had looked after and treated almost like family. Partially because of the idea floated about her chateau and vineyard get an &quot;strip club&quot; added to it as part of the colony. After plenty of repeating the word &quot;no&quot; and cursing out the idiot bureaucrat who dared make the suggestion, Juliet took her own personal pleasure in getting them to back down and her girls would not become strippers to be ogled. Though, Juliet had her own concerns over Fifi and Mia choosing sex as the means of conversion... but a lot of that would be something that could be handled later.<br />
<br />
Right now, Juliet&#39;s main task was to help with the next two conversions with two girls that were the same age. One, Josephine, had requested to become a Lakenvelder or Dutch Belted Cow Animalian. From the pictures that Juliet and Josephine had looked at on line, the breed made for an interesting choice in that its head and forelegs  and rear legs were either black or dusky red and with a wide band, or belt, of white fur around the cow&#39;s middle. Juliet liked the hide pattern, though she admitted part of her interest came from watching clips from the Year of the Ox competition that Animalia sponsored. The other, Eloise, had picked the Argenté de Champagne breed of Domestic Rabbit. Juliet had found the choices interesting and was grateful that both Josephine and Eloise had chosen to be converted the way Juliet had been converted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why all the paperwork?&quot; Josephine wondered as Juliet filled out the appropriate information in a the forms that the secretary had handed to her as they came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is to make sure that you and Eloise have gone through the appropriate lessons and actions to handle all the appropriate instincts that cattle and rabbits may have,&quot; Juliet answered, &quot;and that I am also prepared to help you should there be anything you&#39;ll run into.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be good, we promise,&quot; Eloise promised as Juliet continued to work through the last bits of paperwork.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you both will,&quot; Juliet smiled and gently patted Eloise&#39;s shoulder, &quot;this is all just formalities. Making sure that there will be no accidents or repeats of issues that Animalia has had with those not ready for the animal&#39;s instincts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like the dino lady that made the news,&quot; Josephine said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Juliet nodded, &quot;but you are ready and I am ready. We should have no trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josephine and Eloise smiled to that while Juliet then returned the paperwork and was then asked to escort both of her young wards to the the first waiting area for the conversion process. It wasn&#39;t hard, and it wasn&#39;t long before Judy came to carry out the conversions, with Juliet noticing that the pockets in Judy&#39;s lab coat were stretched out a bit to carry the cases for the conversions. Eloise, though, noted more on who was the one delivering the shots.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bunny!&quot; Eloise declared while pointing<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Judy nodded and gave a small smile, &quot;though, I am a Mountain Cottontail Rabbit, and I was uplifted here in the initial outbreak and joined Horizon afterwards. You can call me Judy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do smart stuff?&quot; Eloise wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Judy answered, amazed at how well the young women knew and understood English, though it was possible that Juliet had been coaching them with learning languages among many other things while in France, &quot;and from the forms, it says you would wish to be a Rabbit Animalian as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Argenté de Champagne,&quot; Eloise said with a smile, &quot;they have a lot of silvery fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judy nodded at the contrasting differences between herself and most Rabbit Animalians that were based off Domestic Rabbits. She was largely a tannish gray with tan forelegs and feet. With her head, ears, and shoulders more brown and her hips and legs more tannish-gray. Many of the Domestic Rabbits had color patterns that weren&#39;t present in mundane rabbit populations, though because of the fact that somewhere in her own family tree there had to be a Domestic Rabbit that had escaped or been abandoned to the wilderness, given Jessica&#39;s all white coloration after her conversion years ago, there were times when Judy wondered on her own family tree. Where her babies had gone to, as she was sure many of them had been uplifted as she was and if her own parents had been uplifted.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am sure you will be beautiful,&quot; Judy commented, &quot;why don&#39;t you come with me and we&#39;ll handle your conversion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eloise looked to Juliet who nodded and then let Eloise walk off with Judy. She then sat by with Josephine and waited calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;They won&#39;t make a mistake and give Eloise the wrong shots, will they?&quot; Josephine wondered in French to Juliet.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, they won&#39;t,&quot; Juliet answered, &quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before Judy returned with a largely silver furred Rabbit Animalian with only her nose and ears being a dark gray in color. This new Rabbit Animalian was wearing Eloise&#39;s clothing, though it was now stretched a bit over her now more generous curves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eloise, are you okay?&quot; Juliet asked as she stood up slowly.<br />
<br />
Eloise came forward slowly and with her nose twitching a bit, but she eventually came forward and hugged Juliet gently. Juliet returned it as a loving mother would.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing fine... and I feel much better,&quot; Eloise spoke, &quot;it&#39;s like all the things that used to confuse me don&#39;t confuse me now... And look! My English is better!&quot;<br />
<br />
Juliet smiled. She&#39;d worked to teach English to all the girls in her care, and it generally did work. When asked, it was something that Juliet felt would help her show that while those in her care might not be the fastest to pick up on things, they could still learn and they weren&#39;t helpless. It was something that Juliet hoped to show would be a way for them to integrate into society once they&#39;d grown up, but despite promises to help, Juliet had often found herself doing most of the work on her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is wonderful,&quot; Juliet spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;d think all of us owe you a lot,&quot; Eloise spoke as Josephine was then lead off with Judy. Josephine waived as she walked off, and Eloise and Juliet waived back.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll worry about that later,&quot; Juliet spoke, &quot;right now there will be handling with your changes... and Josephine will likely need a new wardrobe as while you might fit into you old clothes, given that rabbits are smaller than Humans... even the smallest cattle are bigger than Humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was soon proven a few moments later as Josephine returned in a new set of clothes that were rather simple, but also seemed to be a bit big on her. Their black and white coloring fit well with Josephine&#39;s coloring, though Juliet and Eloise could only see the black fur on Josephine&#39;s head, face, arms, and feet. The white &quot;belt&quot; that the Dutch Belted Cattle were known for was covered by the shirt and pants she was wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;The shirt covers the belt,&quot; Josephine announced with some frustration in her voice, &quot;the thing that made this breed as cute as it is... a cross between a cow and a panda.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only other option would be to present your chest for just anyone to see,&quot; Juliet pointed out, &quot;do you want that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Josephine looked down to her chest, which was now much bigger than it was before, and even bigger than what Juliet had grown to. While a part of her wasn&#39;t necessarily opposed to some attention, stories that Juliet had shared about love and romance was such that she wasn&#39;t going to let just anyone play with her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not just anyone,&quot; Josephine answered, &quot;he&#39;d need to be a handsome and kind man, who could sweep me off my feet... and more metaphorically speaking if he&#39;s Human when I meet him and fall in love. Though, I&#39;d think the first thing I&#39;d like to do is see my birth family again when we go back. Let them know that I&#39;m feeling much better and that I owe it to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just glad to see you happy and that you won&#39;t be taken advantage of,&quot; Juliet smiled back.</p>
