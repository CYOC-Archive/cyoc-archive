<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kendall was heading off toward his car, hoping to whatever power was listening that he would not be delayed. He didn&#39;t exactly relish the thought of being seen out and about in...these. They were for the groundskeeper after all. Not someone Kendall typically enjoyed much of an association with. The nerd - however more athletic and prone to sudden mental lapses - figured that people seeing this would make the very same jokes about him for weeks on end. He shrugged and continued walking...right into the path of Coach Mason.<br />
<br />
The newly more athletic nerd found himself doing a double take when the coach walked out.<br />
<br />
Coach Mason was usually a harsh older man who, even in his advanced age, was very capable of outflexing many of his jocks - and many of the other students just as well. He typically dressed in a plain white t-shirt, heavy jeans, and a belt around his waist. His face was usually kept in a scowl, his hair trimmed down to a buzz cut. But now Coach Mason&#39;s usually weathered skin looked a bit softer but not lacking in muscle tone or size - though he did seem the slightest bit less intimidating, maybe lacking a bit of the fat that contributed to his size. His hair seemed slightly thicker, and his features were more handsome than intimidating.<br />
<br />
Not many people really found the thick and intimidating coach very appealing looking. But now it seemed a pair of female TA&#39;s walking out as well found themselves checking out Coach Mason in a way they never had before.<br />
<br />
Kendall was about to try and keep walking, hope the guy didn&#39;t notice him - Kendall was still quite intimidated by the memory of how Coach Mason usually behaved. But he halted when he heard a deep, impressive and less hoarse voice call out, &quot;Hey, hey! Are you...? Kendall? Kendall Denning? Have you been working out a bit lately?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendall turned around and saw the coach, arms crossed over his thick chest. &quot;Yeah,&quot; Kendall started, &quot;Uhh, yeah, I have. I&#39;m...not quite as huge as some of your guys, but I&#39;m...trying to be in better shape.&quot; Trying to be nothing. Kendall could definitely tell he was more muscular than he had ever really been before. Granted still not on the level of a football jock, but he was very pleased with his definition and size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you keep going...&quot; The coach said with some contemplation, &quot;I was thinking about starting a school body conditioning and body building club. If you keep going I&#39;ll say you&#39;d probably in better condition than some of my stockier athletes for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendall for whatever reason found himself feeling a little bit enticed by that. He usually didn&#39;t go for the more athletically inclined extracurricular activities, and he definitely didn&#39;t consider himself a bodybuilder at all. But the more he thought about it, the more he realized it might be something interesting to have on the side. After all, no one ever said a nerd couldn&#39;t be built. &quot;I&#39;ll think about it. If this becomes a thing, then I&#39;ll...definitely strongly consider joining it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Coach Mason grinned, &quot;Glad to hear it, man. Looking forward to seeing how you develop going forward. Now...if you don&#39;t mind me asking, where are you headed?&quot; He tilted his head a little, plaintative.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I was uh, I was heading home briefly...&quot; Kendall winced, and explained himself, &quot;My build comes with certain challenges, and one of them is finding the right scope of clothing. I believe I need to return home to get larger clothes.&quot; Even as Kendall said it though, he found himself thinking that he needed to actually go and buy some clothes for use at school and home.<br />
<br />
Coach Mason tapped his chin a few times, and then nodded, &quot;Alright, I can definitely believe that, looking at those borrowed clothes. Where&#39;d you get THAT, the lost and found?&quot; He chuckled and then said, &quot;I&#39;ll write up an excuse for you to go and get yourself some new clothes. But I really do want you to strongly consider joining that club, understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understood, sir.&quot; And with that Kendall headed off with Coach Mason&#39;s blessing. Not knowing he had been watched. As Kendall headed into his car and started getting ready, he looked at himself in the mirror. He was thinking again of what he saw of Coach Mason. Now that he thought back to what was said, maybe he wasn&#39;t going through anything serious - but Coach Mason probably was. Kendall then looked at how he appeared for a moment in the small mirror in the car.<br />
<br />
The shirt was really tight - tight enough that Kendall decided, being that he was gonna take a moment to go get some fresh clothes, he could do without the shirt. He opened the coveralls up, and then with a practiced ease removed his shirt before slipping the coveralls back on. Ahh yeah, now that felt...weirdly natural. Well, he could probably get away with keeping this for use later on if he needed it. Not like the groundskeeper would miss one coverall.<br />
<br />
As Kendall drove off, he found he was driving pretty well today.<br />
<br />
Maybe one facet of his mind wasn&#39;t exactly drained! He found his way pretty quickly to the shopping center, which included a number of clothing stores. He breathed and figured this was it. He didn&#39;t get paid the big bucks for tutoring for nothing. Kendall got out and stretched, enjoying how his pecs looked in the coveralls no longer held back by his shirt. It was a moment&#39;s indulgence kind of thing. He wasn&#39;t any kind of jock or anything after all.<br />
<br />
First Kendall proceeded inside of a sporting goods and apparel store, and noted the people around there seemed to be staring a bit at him. Fuck, he hoped he didn&#39;t spring wood again. Well, a check downstairs confirmed his manhood wasn&#39;t acting up. And hopefully he could get this done without needing a pitstop here in the restroom. Kendall picked out some light blue and red tank tops from among the clothes there, and even found himself a few pairs of shorts that were a bit shorter than what he typically wore even on hot days. Eh he figured he could do with some room to grow.<br />
<br />
A quick pay and a smile. Kendall was out and heading to pick up something a bit different.<br />
<br />
He then went over to another clothing store, one with a more workman&#39;s theme to it. His eyes went right to the pairs of overalls, noting how the denim and other fabric types looked, and he imagined his newly more muscular figure sticking out of nothing but a pair of overalls. And THAT got him hard. Kendall gulped and decided he could take care of this little happy occasion in his pants later. Checking around, he went ahead and bought four overalls, still imagining himself in nothing but a pair of overalls with a degree of almost sexualized indulgence.<br />
<br />
Kendall paid for his new clothes with his debit card, which had his tutoring money on it, and then hurried off home to get changed. It was still in second period, so maybe if he hurried up, he could make it back in time to indulge Allison. He had roughly fifteen minutes to get back to the school before third period came about.<br />
<br />
Considering what to wear at school, and eagerly anticipating getting his pipes drained - thinking it would help with his current mental issues - Kendall went ahead and quickly got changed. He left the coveralls on the floor of his room, and then put on a light blue tank top that showed off a lot of his chest and arms. Smiling for himself in the mirror, Kendall flexed - wondering what he might look like as a bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
Like this, but bigger, he surmised. He thought about whether Allison would be good with that path. But he figured Allison wasn&#39;t an entirely superficial sort of girl. Surely she&#39;d be down to ride his dick when he was a bit bigger. Well, that was assuming any way that he went for it. Stuffing his erection in a pair of boxers and wearing a pair of shorts on top of that, Kendall headed back out to go back to the school. Hopefully he&#39;d make it in time such that Allison didn&#39;t need to wait.<br />
<br />
12 minutes till third period. Allison was due to meet him at the library study room. Hopefully there&#39;d be no trouble today about their liaison. Kendall consulted the mirror again briefly. &quot;Oh yeah, buffest nerd in the school.&quot;<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Allison and Wes in second period...<br />
<br />
At the same time Kendall went about getting his clothes, Allison and Wes went ahead in their second period class, deciding to check around for anyone else who might be changing. Allison didn&#39;t know what to expect now. It seemed looking at the change log had somehow lifted a curtain that was half concealing her vision. She could see differences in people she had never really considered before. It was both liberating and...a little scary. Wes on the other hand seemed to just regard it all in a more stoic fashion. He didn&#39;t see much reason to freak out now. Not when it wouldn&#39;t help anything at all.<br />
<br />
Allison was still taken aback by how much she noticed. She almost fainted into her chair when she saw how her public speech class was looking. She had even found herself looking over at Wes for some comfort. He had responded by clasping her hand briefly and nodding silently at her as if saying &quot;I&#39;m here for you&quot;.<br />
<br />
The teacher, Mr. Dalton, was usually a tall, thin and gray haired, rather sharp featured man - not exactly a lady&#39;s man. But today his arms seemed to be puffed up with muscle, his features were less thin and more handsomely angular, and his eyes were a vibrant green. He still had gray hair but it was much thicker. His pecs were also stronger and larger, framing a tight, powerful midsection.<br />
<br />
Chubby and shy, short Dylan Spence&#39;s dark brown hair was still as bushy as always, and he still wore glasses, but his chubby and short build seemed to be moving toward a taller look - his fatness seeming to shift. He looked more stocky than fat, his light almond colored eyes more attractive. His chest seemed half moob half powerfully built pectorals, his broad and strong shoulders making quite an impression in his long sleeved shirt. His jeans looking more packed with his legs in a different way. Even his face, while retaining its extra chin or two, looked a bit more handsome than usual.<br />
<br />
Dylan seemed to recognize Allison was looking his way, and he outright beamed with joy before flexing his bicep. A thick, powerful but untoned mass shooting up at the middle of his arm. He looked so absurdly proud of his bicep.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Wes saw that Malcolm Mack, one of the guys on the wrestling team, seemed to be shifting awkwardly in his seat. His own muscled build looking a little thicker and stronger in a few areas. Malcolm seemed to have eyes for his girlfriend - seated next to him - and she really seemed impressed by his rather thicker bicep and shoulder.<br />
<br />
And then there was the TA, Colin Knox. Usually bookish and rather plain, Colin looked more toned and thin today, his plain features developing more into a handsome countenance. Far from one of the biggest growers, but he was definitely putting in improvement feature wise. His polo shirt and slacks seemed to be fitting him worse today than they usually did. Wes wondered what was going on with these people.<br />
<br />
There were others, of course, but for much of the class, Wes couldn&#39;t tell if it was the effects of whatever it was - a wish? - going on, or if someone just had a glow up today, or had been working out lately. Sitting now next to Allison, despite their usual seats, Wes looked over at her and whispered, &quot;You seeing this too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I am. Dylan Spence just flexed. Shy little Dylan Spence!&quot; She answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, it&#39;s sure treating him well.&quot; Wes admitted, running a hand through his hair. Wes did admit, Dylan was getting treated pretty well by this...whatever this was.<br />
<br />
When the teacher cleared his throat and started class, he went right ahead to speech exercises, and both Wes and Allison were left marveling at the fact that the voices of the teacher and students were sounding very slightly different today. Even the ones who weren&#39;t so obviously different. And it still made both Wes and Allison feel a little odd. Knowing that they were able to see what was going on here, and yet everyone else acted like this was just nothing unusual.<br />
<br />
Before long, Wes got up there and Allison admitted that Wes was a pretty charming guy when he wanted to be persuasive. His accent was pretty nice when he let it out a bit, it gave him a certain &quot;latin lover&quot; vibe. Even though Allison knew she was with Kendall, she honestly felt a little bit tempted to try Wes out. Though when Wes started speaking on something particularly relevant she stopped briefly. He said how if you notice something&#39;s wrong, even if nobody else noticed anything&#39;s wrong, you should still go ahead and speak up. Try your best to make sure that your voice is heard.<br />
<br />
That brought it right back around to the &quot;great change&quot;, as Allison started referring to it mentally.<br />
<br />
Before long after that, their class ended, and Allison knew it was time for her little &quot;date&quot; / &quot;study session&quot; with Kendall. She hoped he wasn&#39;t going to be one of the oblivious change subjects she saw around school. She felt he was too smart for that. And even if worst came to worst, she was not gonna take it lying down. She would make a move herself and try and make him remember.<br />
<br />
As she headed out, Wes briefly gripped her shoulder, and said, &quot;If anything unusual starts happening with Kendall, let me know. We gotta keep track of all that&#39;s going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod between the two of them, and Allison hurried off toward the study rooms, not wanting to be late. She hurried, hoping he was alright. The relationship with Kendall was a mostly carnal relationship, but one she greatly cherished. As she arrived, she saw that it looked like he wasn&#39;t here yet. Odd. Considering he usually arrived on the dot. She checked the rooms to make sure if he was already in there. Nope. It looked like he was just...not here yet.<br />
<br />
Maybe he...got a little lost? No, that couldn&#39;t be. She waited for easily five or ten minutes, knowing they&#39;d have time, but anxious about all that was happening and fearing it might be happening to Kendall.<br />
<br />
And then she saw him.<br />
<br />
Allison almost took a step back - conflicted between her reaction to what was obviously changes underway, and also her overwhelming attraction to the nerd-adonis she was seeing. Not a jock yet by far, but easily very toned and muscular, flaunting his chest and arms in a tank top that showed off a little too much. She wasn&#39;t used to seeing him in a tight tank top like that, let alone one with a bright primary color. His shorts were pretty short, and showed his strong quads and thighs. Allison almost drooled at the sight of him. And so smooth!<br />
<br />
He almost looked like he waxed now rather than just shaved! Did...Did Kendall wax? For her? And damn, the lack of any body hair even seemed to make the muscles stand out more.<br />
<br />
Kendall walked over to her, and smiled broadly, &quot;Hey babe, you ready for that study session? I&#39;m ready to help you get ready for the biology of human sexuality class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison gulped - she knew she needed to talk with him about this. But she couldn&#39;t help herself. Not with a tight, toned Kendall here in front of her like this. Hot damn. She smiled - figuring he still sounded like he was interested in their relationship, &quot;Well, ten minutes late, Mr. Denning. I&#39;ll expect a good five or six times today from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;F-Five or six times...?&quot; Kendall grinned, &quot;I think I can handle it.&quot;</p>
