<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa felt as if she was going to explode, this was too much and it needed to be stopped now. &quot;Merlin,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;Thank you for your help, please help yourself to the refreshments we&#39;ll talk later.&quot;<br />
<br />
The elderly wizard smiled, turning to leave.  As soon as Lisa was sure he was out of earshot she closed the door slowly. &quot;Katie, Gloria,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Take my sister and Jackie to my house. I will meet you there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom shouldn&#39;t we talk about...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No GLORIA,&quot; Lisa yelled. &quot;We are not talking right now. Do as I say. Take your friend and aunt across the street. Wait for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria shrank back slightly from her mother. She had never seen her this angry, turning towards Ann and Jackie she motioned for them to follow her. As they left Lisa now found herself alone with Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;A magical god damn clone,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Over my dead body. The fuck is with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom,&quot; Katie said cautiously. &quot;Maybe...maybe this is for the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa spum quickly staring daggers at her adopted daughter. Now it was Katie&#39;s turn to shrink back, she had never seen Lisa look this angry.<br />
<br />
&quot;A magical clone that is and is not my sister is not for the best,&quot; she growled. &quot;I won&#39;t allow it, I wont have it and if ANYONE in THIS FAMILY thinks its a good idea then pack your shit and move out cause you are NOT welcome in MY HOUSE!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie could only nod as she looked at Lisa. Obviously if their was going to be any peace in the house Merlins idea was a non starter. &quot;Okay mom,&quot; she whispered. &quot;We pass on Merlins idea. So what are you going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Im going to go talk with Ann and work this out,&quot; she said. Slowly Lisa opened the door, determined to make her point to her sister as Katie trailed behind.<br />
<br />
Ann, Gloria and Jackie now sat quietly in Gloria&#39;s home waiting for Lisa. Everyone was still stunned by Anns announcement.  Gloria was at a loss for words, she had given people their youth back before but something about this was different. As Lisa entered with Katie the teens now stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before I say anything,&quot; Lisa growled. &quot;Gloria I need you to change Ann back now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom,&quot; Gloria protested along with Jackie and Ann.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO BUTTS GLORIA,&quot; Lisa screamed. &quot;Change her back NOW!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria and the others stared in stun silence at Lisa. She had never seen her stepmother so angry, Lisa had never even raised her voice in anger at Gloria before, preferring to talk things out. Sighing Gloria now wished Ann back to 42.<br />
<br />
Slowly but surely Ann began to growup. The dye in her shoulder length blond locks vanished as her womanly curves returned. As Ann sped through her 20s and 30s her face began to mature becoming more adult. Finally she reached her age of 42. Anns clothing transformed from her teenage gothic style to a simple blouse and jeans she had been wearing when she first arrived for Thanksgiving weekend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gloria, Katie,&quot; Lisa said tensely. &quot;Take Jackie upstairs. Talk with her and see what she has to say about all of this. DO NOT come down here until I say so. Is that understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded quietly as she now motioned for Gloria and Jackie to follow her. The two teens looked apprehensively at their aunt before turning to Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie maybe we should stay,&quot; Gloria whispered. Katie shook her head sadly as she looked at her sister and her friend. &quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;Now is not the time. I&#39;ve never seen mom this angry. We stay, we are only going to cause problems. Now...lets go and talk with Jackie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once the girls were safely upstairs Lisa spun to face her sister. &quot;You bitch,&quot; she spat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me,&quot; Ann said flabbergasted. &quot;How am I a bitch? I&#39;m tired Lisa. I&#39;m tired of being alone, I missed so much. For the past 20 years Ive rarely seen my family. I want a fresh start, a chance to live the kind of life I always wanted. Can&#39;t you see that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I see it,&quot; Lisa snorted. &quot;And thats why your a bitch.<br />
<br />
Ann frowned at her little sister, angry that Lisa was acting like this. &quot;Lisa I....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop,&quot; Lisa yelled. &quot;Dont say another word and listen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa sighed heavily, leaning against a wall. &quot;You dont think I understand Ann,&quot; she questioned. &quot;Because I do. I get having regrets. I get that youve seen how things could of been. Great friends, not being lonely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why are you so opposed to this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Ann,&quot; Lisa sighed. &quot;After all those years, after the strained relationship that we had, that we had with our parents things are finally getting better. Our family is finally healing itself and you want to ruin it by becoming a kid and having a magical fucking clone of you watch you!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann paused as she looked at her sister. She had not considered that Lisa would be so hurt by this decision. &quot;Lisa,&quot; she whispered. &quot;This...this is a shock. You&#39;ve...youve never really wanted anything to do with your family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that Ann,&quot; she groaned. &quot;When I became Katies guardian I pretty much became the black sheep of the family. I was 19 Ann. 19! With no support. Do you have any idea how happy I am that finally after 20 years you, me and the folks are on good terms again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Ann whispered. &quot;No....I..I can&#39;t say that I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa sighed as she looked at her older sister. &quot;Ann listen,&quot; she said. &quot;Your a grown woman. If you want to do this I wont stop you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann perked up as she looked at her sister. &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;But if you do, know this. Im going to be angry. In a few short months I&#39;m going to have another child.  I want my daughter to know her aunt. Not the teen version of her but the older sister I know and love. The one who after 20 years is finally part of my life again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann sat silently, pondering what Lisa had said. Her sister would love her regardless of her decision. Slowly she watched Lisa approach. As she stood in front of her she gave her a quick hug before smiling sadly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I love you Ann,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Whether you stay my big sister or become my little sister that stays the same. Whatever you do though, do not make a clone of yourself. That I wont forgive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa quickly called for the girls to come down before turning towards her sister. &quot;Whatever you decide Ann save it for the end of the weekend. If you want to become a teen again, I want to talk to the adult you one last time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann sat speechless as she watched her sister leave the home. Lisa had gone from ecstatic to downtrodden over this news. Ann rubbed her chin as she now mulled over what would be a life changing decision.</p>
