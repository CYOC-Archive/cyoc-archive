<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a long, deep purple wand engraved with black swirls and silver waving lines, topped by a large silver 4-pointed star engraved with black lightning, as if the star was supposed to be repeatedly cracked, and butted with a black hand-loop. While holding it up towards the nearest source of light, which was an old and aging lightbulb that hadn&#39;t been replaced since the old house was first built many decades ago, Madeline realized the odd wand felt oddly cold to the touch and had a sort of dark aura that dimmed the light that hit it.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the? What, is this?&quot; The 40-year old asked nobody as she inspected the wand, running a hand over it curiously and trying to poke at it&#39;s out-of-place aura. Was this some sort of strange toy bought by the houses previous owners? It couldn&#39;t have been, Madeline and her husband Chester had gone through the loft thoroughly when they&#39;d recieved ownership from her rich aging grandparents, and she&#39;d found the chest only now, among the more recent boxes of forgotten knicknacks.<br />
<br />
Actually, speaking of said chest, when Madeline next looked, it was gone! And closer inspection revealed tracks in the dust that told of a heavy chest-sized object being moved across the dusty floorboards, and then seemed to have just dissappeared from sight. &quot;W-what? I could&#39;ve sworn this thing was in a damn-heavy chest that was just here a moment ago! And it&#39;s just gone!?&quot; Madeline muttured confused to herself as she looked across the entire loft one more time for a distinct, gold-engraved oak chest, only to find nothing, and as if to drive Madeline insane of doubt, the cases she moved out of the way to get the Chest out, appeared to have moved back as if she&#39;d never moved them, and there was never a chest there in the first place!<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; She summarized aptly with a confused exclamation after a moment more of searching, scratching her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom? Is something wrong up there?&quot; She heard a male voice from down the folding ladder to the loft, shaking her mind from the dissappearing chest to the fact she said her confusion out loud, loud enough to attract the attention of her 18-year-old son Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nothing dear! Just, found some old things from my childhood I&#39;d forgotten about!&quot; She said back, not wanting to try and explain the dissappearing chest and the strange wand she&#39;d partially forgetten she was still holding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, anything special?&quot; He asked from out of sight with the tone of voice suggesting he wasn&#39;t expecting it to be anything interesting even if she did say so.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just some old memories i was reminded about, now, go help your father with cleaning and keep Melanie and Melody from making a mess with their project!&quot; She reminded him of his task, and of her 12-year-old twin daughters who were painting for School.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes mooom.&quot; She heard him let out a sigh and walk away. Madeline shook her head in exasperation, she loved Jeff as her son but honestly kids these days were more focused on their phones than hard earnest work, so she needed togive him a stern reminder of what they were doing from time to time so he didn&#39;t walk off and become too engrossed in his computer or phone! Still, as much as she didn&#39;t really get what was so special about the Internet, she couldn&#39;t say she herself didn&#39;t enjoy it and exchanging catvideos with her parents, nor could she say she didn&#39;t understand that it give them all sorts of skills or understanding of niche topics, and she did trust them to be responsible.<br />
<br />
But, she digressed, as much as Jeff really should get off his phone and help his father, Madeline needed to get off her own metaphorical ass and finish going through the heaps of forgotten boxes. And maybe figure out this strange wand she was holding, it was noticably chilly in the loft now. And as she turned her attention back to said creepy toy wand, Madeline found that she was pretty sure the wand had grown while she wasn&#39;t looking, where before the handle looked more appropriately sized for a 12-year-olds hands, now it looked neatly sized for her grown womanly hands to hold two-handed in front of her. It also looked a good deal longer now too, where before it was 1-foot long, now it looked to have doubled, with the hand-loop at the butt having grown as well to a size more appropriate for the hands of a 40-year-old stay-at-home MILF.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; She softly muttered to herself as she went back to being confused over the cold wand- actually, why wasn&#39;t she caring about how cold the hand holding the wand was? &quot;O-ow?&quot; Madeline had never been a very cold-tolerant woman, much preferring the summer heat than the winter snow at any day of the year, so upon registring the fact her hand felt like it was freezing over holding coldest ice, Madeline tried to drop the mysterious wand as she would have had she for some reason not actually registered the cold since now. &quot;H-hey, get- get off!&quot; Only to find her hand be unresponsive, still clutching the black hole of heat that was only getting colder as time went on, unable to get it off even when trying to pry it off with her other arm, and tring to directly pry away the wand itself only resulted in Madelines other hand freezing in place, gripping the wand two-handed in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is this!? Let- go!&quot; She strained as she felt warmth fade from her arms, and noticed the silver on the wand seem to flake away, to reveal gold, with putrid black sludge beginning to leak from the black cracks in the 4-pointed star. &quot;W-what, is happening?&quot; She watched as slowly, the cracks began to fade from a soon brilliant gold star, black goop trickling down unto her hands, elliciting tinges of foreign fear and terror in Madeline&#39;s mind much to her added confusion. &quot;S-stop, stop this! STOP!&quot; She cried, trying with all her might to push away the wand, flailing widely as the sludge turned to mist that crept around her, and in her desperation she felt something she could push inside of the wand. And push she did, in desperation for the cold to stop, for her hands to let go, for this dream, hallucination or whatever, to STOP. And so she did push, with the strength, mental fortitude, and will of a caring mother of 5 (one young boy (8), Two twin girls (12), one young man (18), one young woman with a (hopeful) boyfriend (21), with hope for a sixth) married with a sweet working man, far more than was originally planned for the wielder of the Dark Wand.<br />
<br />
And so was she blinded by the glare of shining Gold, and buffeted by a torrent of dark fog that sought to consume her until the darkness faded to an endless landscape of dark purple skies, and the crashing waves of an endless, restless sea of Darkness. And then her hands regained control, and she let go without thinking. The satisfaction of finally letting go of the freezing wand, was immediately drowned when Madeline could feel gravity take hold, and she fell.<br />
<br />
*GlOrpsh!* Before she could properly cry out after the glowing star that was the wand, Madeline hit the surface of a black sea, and with the sound of wet goo she was submerged under the violent waves.<br />
<br />
&quot;*Gasp!*&quot; Reflexively she tried and succeeded to surface for air, and was immediately taken under again by a cresting wave into darkness. The water-like ocean did not act or feel like any sea Madeline had been in, for had it been like that, she would have easily managed to keep over the surface as best she could amongst the wild and disturbed seas, for she knew how to swim aptly, and had enough practice from when their family was on vacations to claim that she knew how. But to swim through cold, waters of goo-like sludge, which sucked her down like mud? It was a miracle she wasn&#39;t immediately drowning, or was even capable of crawling for the surface.<br />
<br />
&quot;*GASGlkh!*&quot; Yet for all the waves were turbulent, the waters heavy and cloying, the chill seeping away all warmth. Madeline found herself to have some strange source of strength within that surged with the waves, giving her the power to desperately stay afloat and crawl through the waters, to gasp for precious air even as she was forced to swallow gulps of disgustingly myriad tastes of mud-consistent water.<br />
<br />
But the chill, little air, and heavy sludge wasn&#39;t the only thing Madeline had to contend with however, for submerged in these unnatural waters her mind was accosted with Fears, Terrors, Hatreds, Pains and Despairs not her own, but which tore at her without mercy or care for her innocence or irrelevance. And in the relentless darkness she couldn&#39;t help but look into them, for lack of alternative except to crawl upwards, a decision that she would immediatley come to realize as a paralyzing mistake.<br />

<br />
These are but snippets of the foreign sensations that assault Madelines mind underneath the surface of this malevolent sea, broken only by the sparse times she breaches the surface and gazes at the solitary star that was the wand before a wave larger than the last drags her deeper down below, to be assaulted by the crushing depths of countless others woes.<br />
<br />
&quot;*HGAGhk!*&quot; Was this to be Madelines fate? To find some strange freezing wand in the loft which she couldn&#39;t let go of, only to get transported to osme other place and left to drown in a sea of all humanity&#39;s woes and ills? <br />
<br />
 &quot;*GhAHsp, gasp, CouGH!*&quot; No, she plainly refused, if there was such a thing as fate and it deemed this to be her end, it would not be one Madeline would ever recognize, drowning in fear. For high above the forceful woes of uncountable strangers she would never know, her will transended in parity with the determination of a mother to care for and be there for her children, her promise to her dearest mother, and her husband, for 6 children to be born of her. She would be damned before she let life take her from her children, especially not when one of them was yet to fill 10 years and only two were adults!<br />
<br />
&quot;*Gasp!*&quot; And so she breached the surface once more, a nude but shapely figure drenched in unfading black goop that clung to every surface and crevice, dull-gold eyes see a golden star blazing above while black-tainted lips and mouth gasp for relief from the clawing darkness. Above they see the light be obscured by the terrible form of a towering tsunami that came crashing towards her, eyes noticing the vaguest shape of countless arms both human and not reach out from the darkness, all gripped for her to drag this defiant soul into the deeper depths where nothing before has ever reached alive and sane.<br />
<br />
The depths are crushing now, no more could she crawl upwards, and she felt the unnatural strength that pushed her onwards was being strained, reaching a limit she never knew. But still a warmth radiated from within, and even as her mind was clouded by the screams of woes and ills eternal, she still reached, grabbing for the shining star, reaching, clawing for anything she could grip, even as spectral claws and arms and mouths and limbs chained her, dragged at her, pulled at her, drowned her.<br />
<br />
And, on her final breath, Madeline, mother of five, 40-year-old MILF, grabbed ahold of the Wand of Terrible Darkness for the second time. And was finally pulled from the Sea of All Human Fear by the shining, harsh gold that promised deliverance for all and utter freedom from all mortal, and immortal, chains on the soul. Lifting the obscured form of the Mother high above the gnashing waves, covered head to toe underneath putrid and possessive layers and layers of clawing Fear and Terror and Pain that refused to let go of the quarry they finally could latch to in the deeper depths of Absolute Terror.<br />
<br />
From the purple, filth-covered wand that dragged her here, many silverine ribbons flaked out of the golden four-pointed star and reached downwards. Coiling around the completely abstracted body of Madeline Crawford until she resembled a vaguely humanoid mummified teddybear leaking droplets of black sludge, only for the coiling ribbons to constrict, snapping tight into the figure of a thicc MILF, and the ends began to unravel, to reveal the figure underneath.<br />
<br />
Her lithe yet firm hands were tipped with black wicked claws that faded into delicate, soft white skin, with arms that were covered by gold-trimmed black latex bridal gauntlets that reaching to her upper arms where they folded outward into gold and black cuffs joined by a four-pointed star.<br />
Her toes were wicked black claws, that faded into the soft white skin of her dainty feet and transitioned into black stiletto heels and crowned by another four-pointed golden star. Her legs reaching upwards were clad in tight black leggings that neatly framed her thicc drumstick thighs and strong calves, ending at the hips by folding out into a gold-trimmed tailcoats skirt.<br />
<br />
Her broodmother hips and dumptruck rear were practically naked to the world, their glory on full display only marred by two deep-purple latex X&#39;s tightly placed over the MILFs two lower holes, taut lines that dug into naked ass-flesh connected with the leggings and corset completed the strange equivalent of impossible panties.<br />
Her waif-thin waist was clad in a tight black gold-trimmed corset attached to two poofy flaps of black floor-length skirts, to be specific they were completely absent a front and rear, covering up primarily the left and right sides of her lower body while presenting her rear on full display.<br />
Her gigantic chest was primarily covered by two X-shaped straps of taut deep purple that covered her hefty teats and (most of) her areolae, connected with her corset, around her back, and in a halterneck arrangement around her neck, joined by a small gold four-pointed star. The taut purple cross squished her mighty oblong teardrops into bouncy spheres larger than her head.<br />
<br />
And speaking of the Dark Magical Moms head, it too was uncovered to reveal the face of a dark queen, softly-curved with a narrow nose, signs of age served just to accentuate her distinctive features. Purple-painted lusciously-thick lips obscured a jaw filled with sharp teeth, and her piercing golden star-irised eyes were hidden beneath eyelids with purple eyeshadow, beneath which sat purple stars across her cheeks, with lines stretching past her eyes, ears, and to her neck. <br />
Her hair was a wild and flowing butt-length curtain of deep purple tinged black at the tips, two tall golden horn sat atop her head with two shimmering purple wings outstretched behind her from her waist.<br />
<br />
And with the golden light from the wand dimming as the ribbons disintegrated into black flame in proximity to the dark aura that now surrounded her. The eyes of Madeline opened to witness the endless seascape of this realm, and the eternal twilight that consumed it, and she laughed.<br />
<br />
What did she laugh at? She didn&#39;t know. Whether it was the elation at actually being alive. The cold strength she could feel coiled within her, ready to unleash devastating magics at her whims. The energy she felt radiating form the warmth within her chest, reminding her of her promises. The euphoric feeling of unmitigated Freedom. Of relief from being burdened by a constant onslaught of strangers guilts, fears and pains (Though she felt a portion of it within that coiled coldness within her, ready to burn up as fuel for her.). Or was it the laughter of a madwoman, desperate for the warmth of her children again after what felt like an eternity?<br />
<br />
Who could say, as the sudden fit of laughter made her briefly forget the strange feeling of having a moderately different body from before, or the fact her voice and laughter had changed into that of a grown, haughty royal. And as her fit gradually faded, so did her attention grow, and when she had fully ceased, her face had turned confused. And then she looked down upon her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;... Huh? WAIT, WHAT!?&quot; She gaped at the sight of two massive pale-skinned spheres squished underneath the bands of two purple latex X&#39;s, where once sat a pair of much more subdued G-cup breasts with a light golden tan. Bringing up her hands to verify their existence only served to further incite Madeline, as she noticed her more lithe hands were tipped by wicked claws that were also confirmed to be part of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-WHY- WHY THE HELL AM I DRESSED LIKE THIS!? WHY AM I SO MUCH- BIGGER!?? EVERYWHERE!&quot; She shouted in shock as she further observed her tremendously enhanced curves, as well as the undeniably apparent &#39;clothes&#39; she now wore.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-a-and, my voice? MY VOICE!? WHAT THE HELL HAS HAPPENED TO ME!?&quot; Then she realized her voice was drastically different as well from what she knew she sounded like, and bringing her hands to her face, she realized it too had drastically altered from the soft, slightly pudgy face of a grown milf who has had to deal with the stresses, pains and unmitigated joys of raising 5 kids for more than half her life currently. Now it was the soft yet sharp face of a maternal queen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this has to be a dream, right? A horribly vivid dream! An... Extremely weird, nonsensical dream!&quot; She began to pinch herself, only eliciting brief pain or pleasure depending on the location. And looking around for anything to flick around her, didn&#39;t reveal anything, so she couldn&#39;t try flicking a lightswitch. Then she looked back at the wand that she was pretty sure sent her here in the first place, and felt the strange power within her, and the instinctual instructions it gave her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shadow-Flurry!&quot; A solidified swarm of knife-shaped shadows coalesced around her wand, then shot out in an arc as a swarm of bird-like projectiles that could home to a moving target, diving onto a mentally marked point, hitting nothing, then dissipating into the distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eviscerating-slash!&quot; An outstretched swipe of her claws sent a claw-strike of solidified shockwaves slashing through the air with the strength to cut a mountain in twain, fading away once it travelled some short distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dark-blast!&quot; A dark orb of energy gathered at the tip of her wand, and in a throwing motion, shot it forth towards a point in the air where it detonated into black explosion of lashing spectral tentacles and grasping hands that would seek to rip and tear at anything in reach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Terror-lance!&quot; A solid beam of shrieking darkness erupted forth from her wand with the breadth of an entire horse with the power to annihilate entire cities.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolute-Darkness!&quot; A shockwave of pure darkness radiated outwards form her into a gigantic sphere where all light was consumed, which also sealed itself shut, trapping anything caught inside to be at the mercy of herself who was completely undaunted by the darkness she sustained.<br />
<br />
After going through but a portion of the total magical attacks she could do according to the whispered instructions from the strange cold knot inside her, Madeline settled on the warmth that prevented the knot from basically freezing her whole, feeling the presence of her hopes, and the joys she&#39;s had the luck to experience as a mother.<br />
<br />
And all the while, the sinking feeling in her chest made itself apparent, it was the feeling of realization. That this was no lucid dream, this was, somehow, real.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh gosh, oh my gosh! I&#39;ve become unrecognizable! What-, what will Chester think!? What of my children!? Im wearing practically nothing!&quot; She began to panic as the realization fully began to set in about her changed form, and her &#120371;&#120354;&#120373;&#120361;&#120358;&#120371; &#120371;&#120362;&#120372;&#120370;&#120374;&#120358; clothing, with no trace at all of her old clothes (Which she might have lost either in the transition to here, or in the black seas, where they might as well be utterly gone).<br />
<br />
But before Madeline could get more properly settled down with these extremely drastic changes, she heard a voice call to her.</p>
