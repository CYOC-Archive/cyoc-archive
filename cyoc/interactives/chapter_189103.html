<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is a long one, I got carried on! I wanted to build the characters a bit more.<br/>
If you want to cut it earlier, feel free to do so. :)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Timothy Melnick lives in this house with his roomates.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim clicked on roomates and started typing in &quot;girlfriend&quot; in its place, when he stopped, a better idea coming to his mind. Why having only one girlfriend when he could have a dozen of charming women to himself. Sexy women with big bouncy breasts, juicy asses and wide hips, in light, translucent clothing, if any. A group of seductresses who’d adore him, love him and worship him. Obedient temptresses dancing for him, their bodies a canvas of arts. Something so hot and exotic in mind, and most probably romanticized, that he got hard to the thought, has his finger skated on the screen to write the word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Timothy Melnick lives in this house with his harem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim double-checked the sentence before submitting the modification, not eager to the point of forgetting the dismays of auto-correct. Nothing seemed to have changed and, as he listened out, he could still clearly hear Stephen and Oscar in the living room. Was this app only working once? That would be utterly stupid! Curious, Tim stood up from his chair and got out of his room. As he entered the living room, the three students there became quiet. The game on the tv froze and they turned to him, Matt and Oscar speaking at a same time.<br />
<br />
-Are we too loud, Mister Timothy?<br />
-Can we do anything for you, sir?<br />
<br />
Was it all a weird prank? Why else would they talk to him like this?<br />
-Why are you not calling me Tim?<br />
<br />
-Would you rather we call you Tim, sir? Asked Matt, the end of his question muffled by Stephen’s mouth on his.<br />
<br />
Surprised, Tim observed in shock. It took a moment before he realized that he couldn’t look elsewhere because he was simply aroused by this vision. Roughly the amount of time for his erection to become unconfortable in his jeans. Did he just become gay, or something? In a weak voice, he answered to Matt.<br />
<br />
-Tim is fine, yeah.<br />
<br />
Oscar walked to Tim, groped his groin and, with a wink and a whisper, went to the room next to Tim’s.<br />
-I’ll be there if you need an extra biology lesson, Tim.<br />
<br />
-Act, don’t ask, pipped Stephen in, as he took his breath before a new kiss.<br />
-To each their own, answered Matt, eyeing at Tim without making it obvious if he wanted Tim’s approbation or participation in their make out session.<br />
<br />
Overwhelmed, Tim didn’t hear the bathroom door opening, nor the humid steps on the floor. He jumped when someone coughed behind him, Blaise’s deep voice humbly asking if he could pass. Tim turned around, realizing he was blocking the way to his roomate. When he set eyes on Blaise, he felt his dick twitch. It wasn’t the first time that he’d seen any of his roomates wearing a towel on their hips, but boy, did he ever before realize how hot this view was. He knew Blaise was in good shape, and built, but never had he seen him as muscular in a sexy manner. He was lean, with well defined, strong arms and wider shoulders than anyone else here. The thick pecs that appeared to be shaven, and large, dark nipples mesmerized Tim as he had to admit his newfound passion for men. Blaise’s shallow abs were the only one in this house not hidden by some extent of body fat. Tim caressed them, and the sportsman responded as if it was the most natural thing in the universe, happening commonly. He leaned in for a short kiss. His scent so manly and charming titillating Tim’s nose. <br />
<br />
-Can I pass, now, sir? He asked again, amused.<br />
<br />
Tim was petrified and couldn’t answer. He had just noticed the face of his friend. It was like spoiled goods on an artpiece. Tim already knew that none of them was particularly gorgeous. Truth be told, they were average, at most. But in a pretty face contest, Blaise was losing by a margin. Unless Dace was uglier. The geology student never paid too much attention to his roomates looks, they were guys, after all, and his new gay vision of men seemed to like to take him aback. Tim couldn’t say why he thought Blaise’s visage seemed off. Every feature taken separately were okay. It was just as if they weren’t placed harmoniously, or balanced. Lost in his reflexions and contemplations, Tim needed a second peck to come back to the ground and answer.<br />
<br />
-Of course Blaise, I’m sorry. And please call me Tim.<br />
<br />
Stephen and Matt were back to their game, sitting in a more intimate position, and Tim decided to test his luck with Dace. The rotund man smiled at his roomate when he got in. The education student was a jovialist with a round face and plump body. Tim instantly knew he’d win the prettiest face contest. Dace was wearing his apron, protruding on his plump belly, as usual when he was cooking. That got him teased by the five other men, but he always only smiled and answered he was happier when he was clean.<br />
<br />
-I should soon have a snack ready, Tim, he anounced. Seeing how Tim furrowed his brows, he continued : I heard your request moments ago.<br />
-Th... Thanks Dace. Tim sat on a chair, confused and perplex. That was a lot of changes to go through at once.<br />
<br />
For some reason, probably the force of habit, he opened his phone. The app was still there. He generated a few sentences, until one caught his eye.<br />
&quot;Timothy Melnick would rather be called Tim by his harem&quot;<br />
&quot;Timothy Melnick his discovering his sexual orientation for the second time in his life.&quot;<br />
&quot;The house is 21 feet tall&quot;<br />
&quot;Dace Smith is hoping for Timothy Melnick to make love to him tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those six young men are lovers&quot;<br />
<br />
This! Tim debated changing lovers to hunk, but instead changes young to sexy, than hit submitted. Turning his back at him, Dace was still cooking and humming, wearing nothing under his apron. Tim had a perfect view on the teacher’s V-shaped back, like an arrowhead pointing down to the two firm globes that formed his ass. A wonder to pound, Tim reminded himself although he had never done it. Somehow, he knew of this as if he remembered nights of love-making with the educator, and the other students. Powerful thighs and well-rounded calves upheld these glutes, as if sculpted in ancient Greece. It took a double take before Tim noticed the pudge still visible on Dace’s hips, and partially hidden by the apron.<br />
<br />
&quot;A crème brulée for monsieur&quot; announced Dace in a sing-songy voice, as he placed the dessert in front of Tim. He passed the loop over his head, letting the top half of the clothe fall in front of him, and sat in front of Tim, an expecting daze on his face. Exhibiting proudly his paunch and the two mounds of flesh that formed his chest, Dace was breathtaking, and definitely honed the dad bod look. An almost non-existing trail of lightly dusted hair left his bellybutton down to his treasure, and a patch shyly showed itself on his torso, between his lovely manboobs. If Dace was thinner than he had been, his new charms did not correlate with his weight. His face was mostly the same, but bettered, as if his former face was a bad-night-sleep face rather than his actual looks.<br />
<br />
-You only made one?<br />
-The rest is in the fridge. Anyway, we’re the only two who’ll enjoy it. Too caloric.  Dace giggled mockingly as he winked at Tim, whose erection reacted instantly, twitching.<br />
<br />
Blaise entered the room at this moment. He was gorgeous. It was as if someone had meticulously replaced his features in the proper manner, tilting a nostril a few degrees, raising an eye at the other’s level, changing the thickness of his eyebrows, etc. His body seemed mostly untouched, or marginally different. He was certainly toner, and his abdominal ridges a bit more pronounced. His boxer short seemed too tight for his large legs, but almost too loose for his waist. He dropped a kiss on the back of Tim’s neck, his short beard tickling him, and sat next to him. What had been a shaven torso was now a trimmed coat of fur. Even his reading glasses – Tim assumed Blaise used to wear contact lenses - looked hot on him.<br />
<br />
-Mist… Tim ? I meant to ask you something.<br />
-What, Blaise ? <br />
-It’s Oz’s birthday in three weeks. If ever you need any suggestions for the celebrations, I…<br />
<br />
His hand on Tim’s arm, Blaise seemed to have lost his train of thoughts. He continued to caress, and ligthly squeeze Tim’s arm dreamily until the geologist asked :<br />
-You..?<br />
-I? Oh! I zoned out again, I’m so sorry. I love your biceps so much, but they really get to my head.<br />
<br />
What was he talking about? Was Blaise making fun of his spaghetti arms? In a reflex motion, Tim turned his head to where the mathematician’s hand still rested. He silently gasped at his arms. His biceps and triceps might be smaller, but they were better-defined than even Blaise’s. Even Tim had a hard time to get his wits back to the concentration. He didn’t realize yet that the sentence he changed stated six men, and it therefore included him.<br />
<br />
-Ahem, ye… yeah. I didn’t really think about his birthday yet, thanks for bringing it up. Do you have any idea?<br />
-I will obviously make the cake, commanded Dace.<br />
<br />
Blaise didn’t have the time to answer, when their discussion was interrupted.</p>
