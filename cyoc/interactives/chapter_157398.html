<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James and Jill where totally different, James had grown up the only son of a lawyer who was one of the founding members of the 5th largest law firm in the nation. All his family was at the top of their field in one way or another, his mother while a stay at home mother at first had started her own interior design business and had been on the front page of magazines for her forward thinking design work.  When he came into the world, his father wanted him to follow him as a partner in the law firm and hopefully one day run it. This wasn’t the case which was a slight disappointment since he was this only child. James skill with building designs including winning multiple national awards and even a handful of international competitions as well. Friends and business associates of his father always congratulated him on having a future grand architect who would design buildings which would grace the world, that eased the pain of James not following him into the law.<br />
What also happened was that James’ father partner had a daughter, Amber who was of age with James who had followed her father into the Law and showed everything needed to take over the firm on her own. So it was decided without the children’s constant that they would marry, James would design award winning buildings and skyscrapers who grace the skyline of cities around the world, while the Daughter Amber would take the law firm to new heights. A power couple like no other.<br />
Only two issues really stood in the way, neither James nor Amber liked each other but that wouldn’t be a problem. Both kids followed their parents wishes and new this was expected of them. That was the plan until James meet Jill. <br />
Jill was very different; she had grown up the daughter of a fisherman who died at sea when she was 10. Her mother had died years before and with no living relatives she went into the childcare system. Was placed in a foster home with 5 other kids and “parents” who only wanted the cash from the state. Jill however was a driven woman, she worked 3 jobs all the while keeping straight A in school. She got a scholarship, kept working 3 jobs to help pay for everything while she attended school for Engineering. She worked and scrapped her way up to the top and there she meets James and almost instantly they fell for each other.<br />
Both of them had similar likes, hobbies and each could think like the other. It was as if they where made for each other. Only they where totally different. <br />
James was rich, very white from old money, a classic New England WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant)<br />
While Jill grew up poor, was clearly not white, her father was from Pakistan and her mother India which was why they came to the USA. She was raised Hindu in honor of her late mother.<br />
Needless to say James’ family and his father’s partner family hated her and refused to accept the relationship. Jame’s father and his partner even went so far as to try to see if they could get Jill deported even though she was born in the US and her parents had both become citizens. When that failed, they used their power to pressure companies not to take her on. They were out to destroy her and break them up. They even went after James, convincing business that worked with their firms not to hire him, saying that this woman had gotten her claws into him and he needed to be set straight. With so many business working with the firm, neither James nor Jill could get much work in their fields when they had been rising stars in. <br />
Strangely the only one happy about it was Amber the one James was suppose to marry, she didn’t want to marry James as much as James didn’t want to marry her. If James married Jill, then she could finally be free to go after men she wanted.<br />
Their love was too strong, they knew they couldn’t be happy without each other in their lives. With no other choose, they had to get away from Jame’s family, the choose was made. They would leave and go somewhere even they couldn’t reach and where they could be together.<br />
“Hello welcome to Branch of Fantasies how can I help the two of you?” said a voice as they walked into the store ready to say goodbye to this world.<br />
“Yes, we need to go to one of your worlds.” Said James<br />
“We aren’t coming back?” added Jill<br />
“Alright…if you are sure, we can go over the paperwork. Where do you want to go and what do you want to become?” said the store worker.</p>
