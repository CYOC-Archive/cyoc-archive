<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The whistle blew and the fourth graders began to do laps around the gym. 32 year Pam had been teaching elementary school P.E for almost six years now. Pam was a signal lesbian with long blonde hair and bright blue eyes. Her body was in fit shape as she was a marathon runner. Her last girlfriend left her for another woman and she had used her job to try to get over it since being with these kids usually made her feel better. She had always hoped that she and her partner would one day adopt a kid but after her ex left her those chances went down. With know one to take care of their kid when she was gone, no adoption agency would consider it a stable home. As she watched the kids run her eyes caught the attention of the smallest boy in the class Jake. He wasn&#39;t very big and very skinny, Jake was very shy and often picked on by other kids for being too nice. But Pam didn&#39;t mind someone being too nice, in fact, she liked it, her ex girlfriend was really nice to everyone and it gave Pam a chance to be the tougher one which she enjoyed tremendously. Pam would love to find a new girlfriend with Jake&#39;s personalty. Jake&#39;s family is completely broken, his dad left when he was born and his mom was so drunk most of the time that she sometimes forgot that she even had a son. Pam only wished there was some way to help Jake out but there wasn&#39;t and besides, Jake never seemed to complain. Maybe it was because of how fast he had to grow up. <br />
<br />
That afternoon Pam was in the Teacher break room when Mrs. Margret the school nurse came into the room. Pam had always had the hots for Margret even though she knew she wasn&#39;t gay. Margret had short black hair, a small skinny body with large breast and filled out body. But the most interesting thing about her was her red and gold eyes. She had always said it was a rare condition at birth and was always considered unique. Margret sat next to Pam and brought up that she could sense something was wrong with her. Pam brought up how lonely she felt since her ex left her and that she had always wanted a child of her own. Margret then brought up Jake and told Pam that she knew everything and that Pam cared about Jake. Margret pulled out a small vile of blue liquid and handed it to Pam. When Pam asked what it was Margret told her that it would solve both hers and Jake&#39;s problem, she then told her everything she needed to do. When she finished Pam was taken aback and said that she could never do &quot;that&quot; to a kid let alone a boy, &quot;It would be wrong&quot;. said Pam. &quot;Would it really?&quot; Said Margret. She then got up and left the room leaving Pam alone with the vile in her hand. <br />
<br />
Friday afternoon the 3:00 bell rang and all the students poured into the hallways. Jake walked to his locker to get his things, when he opened it he noticed something wrapped in plastic laying there. It was a cookie in the shape of a hart, there was a note attached that read: To Jake from your secret admirer. Jake blushed, he had no idea that any of the girls in school even liked him. He ate the cookie and as he began to walk out the front door his P.E teacher Pam stopped him and asked to see him in her office really fast. Jake hoped it wasn&#39;t any thing bad. He had always tried his best in gym even if he wasn&#39;t very fast. As they headed closer to the doors to the gym, Jake began to feel incredibly sleepy, Pam held on to him and genitally guided him out the back door of the school and in to her car, Jake was too sleepy to notice and immediately dozed off Pam drove him back to HER house and carefully carried him inside. She took him into her bedroom <br />
and laid him in the bed. She carefully undressed him then she undressed herself and got into bed with the boy. She laid on top of him and placed the covers over them. Jake came to but was still very weak, Ms. Pam was staring back at him smiling reassuringly, she kissed him softly on the lips, &quot;Ms.Pam, what are you doing?&quot; Jake asked weakly. &quot;Shhh just relax Jake&quot;, Let me take care of you, I&#39;m making both our lives much better, do you trust me?&quot; She asked. &quot;y-yes&quot; Jake replied. With that she softly kissed him again and began moving against him, her stomach rubbed against his sex and he got an erection, the cookie he ate contained the blue liquid in it and it was beginning to work, Jake felt great pleasure as his whole body got warm, he began to change underneath Pam, She could feel his body growing beneath her, his skinny legs filled out more and became very feminine, his skinny torso stretched out , his sex was now rubbing against her sex as it slipped inside of her, Pam let out a low moan as it began to pump inside of her, Jake could feel a rumbling of flesh as he was gaining body mass and he felt himself getting heavier, he wrapped his lengthening arms around his new partner as she continued with him, he felt pressure on his butt as it started to gain mass push out and round it self, his hips widened significantly as they bucked against Pam, His waist got somewhat heavier and expanded while also lengthening, Pam raised up a bit so she could rub her breast against his nipples, two small bumps pushed out on his chest, Jake felt great pleasure as his small breast began to grow, the sound of stretching flesh as they expanded and got heavier pushing into Pam&#39;s breast, they stopped at C-cups, Pam stared back into the face of her changing lover, He looked her in the eyes but then closed them due to great pressure, Pam could hear a cracking noise coming form Jake&#39;s head, &quot;Just try to relax Jake&quot;She whispered in his ear. &quot;This might hurt a bit.&quot; All of a sudden his facial bones started to reconstruct themselves, he felt his nose get bigger and a little less rounded, He felt the fat in his face reduce greatly as the bones rearranged to sharpen his face His cheekbones and jawline became more pronounced. His lips got slightly thinner, and his eyes narrowed some, He now had the face of a 32 year old woman. His dark hair got even darker and grew tho the middle of his back. The changes nearly finished Jake continued to pump away inside Pam, He could feel the climax coming and so could Pam. They both moaned together until Jake buckled in extreme pleasure, He came deep inside of her ensuring pregnancy, his limp member began to shrink out of Pam as she lay on top of him both exhausted, his sex shrank smaller and smaller until it sucked into him as his insides rearranged into the sexual organs of a woman, new folds formed into a female sex. Jake&#39;s fate was now sealed. He was now Julie, a 32 year old soon to be lesbian mother. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pam?&quot; said Julie after a few minutes of laying with her new lover. &quot;Yes Julie&quot;. replied Pam. &quot;Thank you&quot; I&#39;ve always wanted a new life and you have given it to me, I love you&quot;. &quot;Me to&quot; Said Pam. <br />
They spent the rest of the night kissing and talking in bed. Thinking about how wonderful their new baby will be and how great of a Family they will always be.</p>
