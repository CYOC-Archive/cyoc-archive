<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jamie walked down the hallway of the high school, she was amazed of how much things changed.  She was in school before, back in the 1997 when she was sixteen the first time.  She remembered that the high school kids back then were more hip and wild, sometimes dressed in tacky attire and speaking in 90s lingo.  She remembered her old friends that were so sweet and spend time in the mall and watching mid 90s films.  It was even during that time she met with her husband in Mike when they were high school sweethearts.  That was the start of a relationship between the two where it would blossomed over the years.  She felt a bit of nostalgia remembering such things.<br />
<br />
However, the memories of old blend in with the memories of new as she could see that the school was far different then before.  Kids now where normal clothing, locker rooms were decorated with cut outs and marker graffiti.  She could see some kids looking at their phones, watching Tik Tok videos and hash tagging and rarely interacting with their friends.  Certainly a far cry away from what high school kids did at the first time at sixteen.<br />
<br />
Her new memories showed her her locker, which is the same place the first time she was sixteen, the one that has the cutout of Taylor Swift with her name over it decked in cut magazine letters.  Using the same combination of the padlock before, she opened the it up and revealed a Taylor Swift shrine that has the body of Saint Mary with the head of Swift glued over it her first CD of the pop star as an offering and small battery lit candles in between.  Jamie was surprised that this obsession of Swift was surprising for her.  She never knew girls were that obsessed with her.  But in her memories, she knew that Taylor Swift was the GOAT in her eyes and for once, she was all right with it.<br />
<br />
Kissing her finger and placing it on Swift&#39;s cut out face and said, &quot;Wish me luck Taylor.&quot;<br />
<br />
She soon unpacked her backpack and placed the bag into the locker.  Just as she was about close the locker...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jamie!  What up, girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing that, she turned to see two teenage girls approaching her.  One is a black teenage girl with long black braided hair and dressed with purple top, skinny jeans, and white slip on shoes.  The other is a thin teenage Japanese girl with long straight black hair and was wearing a white designer shirt with Sailor Moon in the front, knee length plaid skirt, long white socks and black slip on shoes.  Seeing the two, she recalled them from the scrapbook from yesterday.  With her new memories, she called them out by their names.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chloe, Mei, how are you? Weekend good?&quot; Jamie asked as the two of them approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;As good as can be, my parents are finally letting me get my permit, I&#39;ll finally be able to drive! At least with adult supervision of course.&quot; Chloe said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fantastic! I can&#39;t wait until my parents finally let me get my permit.&quot; Jamie replied.  She already knew how to drive, but for some reason, her knowledge of driving was only fleeting.  Now she only was a beginner.  A small price to pay for sacrificing motherhood to relieve high school life again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two are so lucky, my parents won&#39;t let me get a permit until I&#39;m 17, a whole year from now!&quot; Mei groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;That really sucks.&quot; Jamie said patting her on the back like the friend she was.  &quot;But keep your head up.  It&#39;s only a year.  I promise, you will be driving with us in college.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mei looked to Jamie and gave a warm smile.  &quot;Thanks Jamie, you know how to brightened my day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie chuckled as she was still a role model to the two, but this time, as a teenager, she was the anchor to their problems.<br />
<br />
Closing the locker, the three walked down the hall and went on with the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...  Stocked at the homecoming this Friday.  It&#39;s a big day.&quot; Chloe said as fling her braided hair.<br />
<br />
Jamie smiled and said, &quot;You know it.  Our basket ball team taking on our rivals across town.  We are going to smoke them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you know what&#39;s the best part?&quot; Mei asked, &quot;We will be cheering our team on.  And who knows, maybe Antonio will finally notice you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie heard that and found herself blushing in embarrassment.  &quot;Please, Mei...  Antonio would never notice me.  He&#39;s been practicing basketball and never had time with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chloe looked to her and said, &quot;Girl, are you kidding me?  He will notice you.  I mean, let&#39;s look at the facts.  You&#39;re top of your class, head cheerleader, and popular among the student body.  You are a sure shoe in for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mei looked ahead and saw someone and pointed to this person.  &quot;Speaking of...  Don&#39;t look now, but there he is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing that, Jamie turned and could see what Mei is pointing at.  What she could see a young Filipino teenage boy with bronze skin and a toned build underneath his basket ball jersey and jacket and cargo pants.  Seeing the boy, her body stopped moving and her heart was beating at a rapid pace.  It was Antonio, Jeff&#39;s best friend and now her crush.  The two girls turned to see her freeze up and could tell she was having one of those moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...  What are you doing, girl.  Talk to him.&quot; Chloe said to help encourage her.<br />
<br />
Jamie could feel her body heating up as her crotch was starting to ich.  &quot;I...  I don&#39;t know...  I don&#39;t know what to say...&quot;<br />
<br />
Chloe rolled her eyes around and said, &quot;Just say hi.  It&#39;s not that hard.  I mean, you have this crush, why don&#39;t you have the courage to greet him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I- I- I-I-&quot; what Jamie said as she was stuttering with her words.<br />
<br />
Mei could tell that she was in her own little world as she turned to see Antonio headed towards them.  &quot;Uh oh, don&#39;t look now Jamie but I think Antonio is looking your way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie immediately froze up as her legs were locked into place and her hands gripping her schoolbooks tighter.  &quot;I-I-I-I-I-I-&quot; Jamie was repeating herself as she has no idea what to say.  Once, she was a mother, she would&#39;ve had the confidence necessary in talking to someone.  But now as a normal teen, all that confidence was long gone and she was shy and timid in front of any guy she sees.<br />
<br />
Antonio approached the three girls as he waved them off.  &quot;Hey girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chloe and Mei played it cool as they waved at him and said back, &quot;Hey Antonio...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie though had her eyes moving to see Antonio as she gave a slight wave and said silently &quot;hi...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See you three at practice after school.&quot; he soon said back as he walked off to his class.  The moment he left, Jamie collapsed on her knees and took a breather, glad that it was completely over.  The girls soon bend down to her level and couldn&#39;t believe she failed like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s with you, girl.  That was your big shot and you blew it.&quot; Chloe said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s right.  Every time Antonio passes you by, you freeze up like a statue and never utter a single word to him.&quot; Mei retorted.<br />
<br />
Jamie took a breather and said to the two.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry...  It try to talk to him.  But every time I see him, my body doesn&#39;t listen.  Why can&#39;t I get it right?&quot;<br />
<br />
As she asked herself that, a pair of opened toed black heels appeared in her vision with purple toe nail polish and she heard a female voice with a thick Spanish accent  &quot;No se...  Maybe you are just a screw up in catching dates.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing that voice, she looked up and saw the last person she wishes to see.  Towering over her, is a Latina teenage girl of 17 who looks and dress like she was actually in her early twenties.  She had huge D cup breasts that fit snuggly with her black sleeveless tank top showing off her toned stomach and curvy hips, long slender tanned legs with a form fitting blue jean skirt that goes above her ankles a Diva like face with pouty purple lips and purple eyeliner, and long wavy muddy brown hair with that goes down her shoulder.  In between her were two others girls that looks older then 17 as well.  One was a goth girl with a short black hair in a bob cut and gothic make up dressed in a torn shirt with leather jacket, long black lates pants, and long combat boots.  The other, a blonde valley girl that has shoulder length poofy hair and bimbo like make up with a pink tube top, pink speedo pants, and high heel sneakers.  Both of them are just as mature and sexy as the one in the middle.<br />
<br />
Seeing the three, specifically the Latin girl, Jamie bolted up and said out loud, &quot;LOLA?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie&#39;s friends soon got up and and got into a defensive stance.  Lola, the girl in the middle, looked to her friends and said, &quot;Look what we got here, ladies.  It&#39;s the loser patrol of our school.&quot;  The girls laughed it up, finding it amusing to poke fun at the three.<br />
<br />
Jamie dusted herself off and asked, &quot;What do you want, Lola?  Shouldn&#39;t you be at some porno photoshoot or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lola wasn&#39;t impressed by Jamie&#39;s joke and looked to her slender hand, checking out her purple nail polish.  &quot;Oh...  Nothing important.  Just wanting to see you chicken out in greeting a top basket ball player in our high school.  You really nail it there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chloe heard that and defended her friend.  &quot;Hey!  Back off, Lola.  Jamie is just having a rough start.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lola did a fake gasp with her hand over her mouth and said in her fake shock, &quot;¿En realidad?  I didn&#39;t know.  I thought for sure that she was only acting like a screw up.  Surprising that you three managed to get the spot at the homecoming halftime.  Que asquerosa...  How can you three get the spot and not us.  I mean, look at me.  I know how to show off this body when it comes to my  dance moves.&quot;<br />
<br />
She soon started to sway her hips and danced around, turning around to show off her booty in front of the three.  All three friends were disgusted at how she danced like a stripper as Jamie turned away and was annoyed by her.  &quot;Please...  You don&#39;t need a body to dance.  You need...&quot; she said before getting interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Que?  Teamwork and friendship...  Eso es lindo...&quot; Lola interrupted, &quot;You know, you three got lucky that you got that spot.  But enjoy it while you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mei looked to her strangely and said, &quot;Really?  Why&#39;s that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause I convinced the coach that we would want a rematch with you three on Wednesday.  And I promise you, we will take that spot from you brats.&quot; Lola answered.<br />
<br />
Jamie heard that and was shocked.  &quot;What?!  How?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lola twirled her wavy hair and said, &quot;Oh...  I have my ways.  So savor that spot.  Cause soon, we will take it back and show the school why we&#39;re the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pretty soon, the bell started to ring, telling everyone that class is about to start.  Lola heard that and said, &quot;C&#39;mon girls, we got class to go to.  We&#39;ll let this little girls wallow in their future defeat.  Buena suerte señoras....  You&#39;re going to need it.&quot;  She and her friends walked past Jamie and her friends as they laughed it off.<br />
<br />
Jamie looked back at the three and was disgusted by Lola.  &quot;That Latina bitch.&quot; Jamie said under her breath.  &quot;How dare they want a rematch after we beaten them.&quot;  Course, as the argument was going on, Jamie remembered a new memory where she and her friends were able to beat Lola and her team for the spot at halftime.  So hearing Lola wanting a rematch, sickens her.<br />
<br />
Chloe place her hand on her shoulder and told her, &quot;Don&#39;t get worked up over Lola, Jamie.  All that snub want is attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mei soon joined in and told her, &quot;Yeah.  Just ignore her.  And besides, we beat them before, we can beat them again.  All we need to do is train harder.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie looked to her friends and gave a polite smile.  To think she was the role model to these two girls and now it&#39;s the other way around.  &quot;Thanks girls.  I always have good friends with you two.  Now come on, we don&#39;t want to be late for class.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three soon ran down the halls of the school to get to their class.  Jamie&#39;s first re-experience of high school was something.  It was nothing compared to her first time as a teenager of the mid to late nineties, but she knew, this was going to be quite a week.</p>
