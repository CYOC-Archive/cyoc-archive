<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They followed the man into the next room where there was piles of football equipment. <br />
&quot;Man! This is amazing!&quot; shouted the defensive back seeing all the gear that laid about. <br />
There was a bunch of sports drinks on the table labeling what they were oriented for, <br />
and next to each table was that kind of equipment. &quot; What does all this do?&quot; asked <br />
Charlie looking around. &quot;well this equipment makes the player resilient on the field you <br />
see, but were still working out the kinks here.&quot; The minute he said this the defensive <br />
back runs to the table and grabs one of the bottles. &quot; Please don't do that sir!&quot; said the <br />
guide but he just smiled holding the bottle in his hand. Next to Charlie came the voice <br />
of his friend kieshawn who was on the same team as the defensive back&quot; Jones! Don't <br />
do it man! It's not gonna be good man!&quot; &quot;Oh please! I'm not that stupid! I'll just look for <br />
the bottle marked football and drink that!&quot; and with that he put the bottle down and ran <br />
to the end where there was a table all brown labeled &quot; football&quot; <br />
<br />
They stood there in aw as the dumb jock picked up the bottle and read the label. <br />
&quot;Please sir! Don't drink that bottle, it will not be good!&quot; but he was too late as jones <br />
popped open the cap and began gulping down the weird liquid. With a loud &quot;ah!&quot; he <br />
tossed the bottle into a trash can and laughed! &quot; jones you really shouldn't have done <br />
that man! Your cracker ass is done now!&quot; jones just glared at him and said&quot; please <br />
asshole! You were alway so fast and able to catch the ball better! Now it's time for a <br />
white man to play the sport better! I'm gonna be a football star now instead of some <br />
jungle bunny coon!&quot; As he said those last words, a strange rumble came from his <br />
stomach, and kieshawn just stood there and said &quot; now you get yours you racist <br />
bastard!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a loud belch, jones began the changes as the tour guide smiled and said &quot; now <br />
well see what happens.&quot; &quot;This liquid are dumb friend has just swallowed will indeed <br />
make him a football star in more ways the one! You see as we tried to test it, the <br />
people who drank it, well there still here.&quot; as he said this the group looked at jones <br />
and the table standing by him. As the effects began jones opened his mouth and said &quot; <br />
I feel weird! What's happening to me!?&quot; Kieshawn now smiling the whitest smile <br />
Charlie ever seen, said &quot; why jones, your gonna be a football star! I plan putting you to <br />
good use too my friend!&quot; and with that jones looked down as his feet began to change. <br />
First they popped out of his sneakers as the swelled beyond normal, then as his socks <br />
ripped open, his feet started turning a brown color. &quot; your kidding I'm gonna be black!&quot; <br />
shouted jones irritated as his legs swelled up as well, becoming the same rich brown <br />
color as his feet. &quot;Not exactly!&quot; kieshawn said as the group watched in amazement. <br />
Jones the saw his pants rip as his waist began to expand, his belt snapping as his <br />
hands and arms began to bounce of his rounder midsection. &quot;whoo!&quot; he shouted as he <br />
lost balance. Looking down he saw his feet had melted together becoming one single <br />
point, and strange splits were beginning to form in between his former feet and on <br />
there sides Well what was left of them anyway! <br />
<br />
&quot;Someone help! I'm gonna fall!&quot; he yelped as his arms and hands began to turn the <br />
leather brown as the rest of his body. Everyone just looked on as he finally stumbled <br />
and began to fall back, his retuned body rocking back and forth on the floor. &quot; it's <br />
strange, he's obviously fatter but his body is harder?&quot; Charlie mentioned curiously as <br />
jones tried to rock himself back up. Kieshawn looked at him with a gleam as his head <br />
changed brown, and his waste kept growing. &quot; How are we feeling mr jones?&quot; asked <br />
the guide. &quot; I feel light, but I don't think I'm suppose to, am I? What's my name <br />
again?&quot; jones looked bewildered as the guide mentioned to the group&quot; you see the <br />
mind also changes as well, becoming air, you can say he's becoming an airhead <br />
football jock!&quot; and as he said that he chuckled. Everyone else just cringed as jones <br />
head began to come to a point. Giggling, jones rocked back and forth as laces began <br />
to poke up his midsection. A black air hole and the words Wilson and NFL appeared <br />
on his side like a professional tattoo, except he no longer had skin just leather. <br />
Drooling out of his mouth jones laid there gently rocking back and forth next to a pile <br />
of footballs next to the table. &quot; Yo! Jones! Your turning out to be a pretty sweet ball <br />
man! Can't wait to give you some spiral throws!&quot; Jones just looked dumb for a minute, <br />
and tried to open his mouth.<br />
<br />
But instead of a voice there was a loud hissing noise as he began to shrink, his eyes <br />
nose, and ears now nothing more than dots which spread across him. As kieshawn got <br />
closer the tour guide said &quot; well we all know now the true star of football is the ball <br />
people!&quot; and rummaging throw the torn cloths kieshawn picked up his new ball! &quot; can I <br />
keep him? &quot; he asked the guide. &quot; well he never will be human again, so as long as <br />
you take care and use him, you may have him for as long as you want! But remember, <br />
you are responsible for him!&quot; and with that the black man gave the new jones ball a <br />
kick threw some automated goal posts! &quot; I hope you do treat him good kieshawn?&quot; <br />
Charlie said as they followed the guide into the next room.</p>
