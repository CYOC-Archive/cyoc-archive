<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You sigh deeply. It&#39;s bad enough you are now a girl, and you have to wear the dress, but you hate the idea of being so exposed without underwear. Knowing your luck today, the dress would get pulled up somehow and you would flash your new pussy to everyone in the shop. You groan and open the sealed bag, pulling out the stockings and panties. You slide the panties on, surprised at how good they feel. You then struggle with the stockings, but eventually get them on. You then slide into the dress, and after some fumbling you get it zipped. You look at your reflection in the mirror and smile at how good you look. Goth-loli isn&#39;t really your thing, but if you saw this girl you would think she was pretty hot...shame she is you. You gather your nerve, and walk out of the changing room. You look around the shop, and finally find the clerk a few aisles away. You walk towards her, very the sway of your hips and jiggling of your breasts as you walk, but there isn&#39;t a lot you can do about it. You finally reach her, and softly say, &quot;uh...excuse me...&quot;You sigh deeply.

You don&#39;t know if you want to try being a girl, but you also don&#39;t want to go back to the way you were. As you contemplate her words, you notice a glint in her eye that suggests she may be right. Maybe it&#39;s time to explore this new life and see what it&#39;s like.

 You smile and nod, feeling excited at the prospect of trying out this new life. As you turn to leave the store, you catch a glimpse of yourself in a nearby mirror. Your new goth-lolita dress hugs your curves in all the right places, and you can&#39;t help but smile at the sight of it.<br />
