<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yes, that old TV her grandmother had lying around from long ago that her parents had gotten her. It was the greatest gift she had ever been given, now able to watch as much anime as she wanted. Of course her parents would become worried as she spent days on end up catching up on her favorite series and new and sometimes even unplug it altogether. After stepping out of the shower nude, her eyes fell onto the TV as she couldn’t help but smile. DVD cases littered the floor nearby as she stepped closer. <br />
<br />
The TV would soon turn in as she jumped in surprise. It would show pure static as the DVD player had not been connected but something else drew her in completely. Her eyes scanned the television screen as the static on the screen would hold her in a trance. She sat down and felt the water on her hair trickle down her back while watching intently. <br />
<br />
Mackenzie fly her legs bump into something on the floor. Looking down would show one of the many opened trays of plastic sugar cookies from the supermarket. It held a few cookies from her last binging session. <br />
<br />
“Maybe Mom won’t mind if I have just one.” She said and opened the lid. Her hands forced a cookie into her mouth as bliss entered her system. The tastes were unlike anything she had ever experienced! After another two, her body would grow outwards. Her legs and arms had meat added to them, becoming plump and lovely. Her stomach bulged out as the last of the cookies had been eaten. While not obese, Mackenzie had definitely passed the point of being overweight. Not that she cared, really. It was just more fluff for that special someone. Now 15 years old and pushing 160 lbs, she could recall her parents numerous attempts and dieting.<br />
<br />
Finished with the cookies, she turned her attention to the remaining bottle of warm soda near her nightstand while the static continued to blissfully assault her ears. Uncapping the top, the female would begin to chug. She felt her once beautiful skin begin to break out in a mild case of acne but the sugary drink didn’t stop there. Her thoughts would race with scenes from her favorite anime series. Getting super excited as she remembered the epic fights, the opening songs and the characters. She felt her height shrunk down to 5’4” but it was natural. Her mom was pretty short as well. <br />
<br />
Gone was anything relating to sports or anything physical, being replaced about knowledge of anime but Japan itself. Dreams of competing became dreams of visiting the east, where she could finally see where her favorite past time was made. After finishing the soda, Mackenzie stared at the static as her mind began to shift. <br />
<br />
Social interaction had been severely affected. Where she had once felt confident at was now something she was bad at. Thankfully her usual gang of friends weren’t much better, usually engaging in talk that caught stares from other people. Some Japanese terms lodged themselves into her brain as they made themselves at home, common phrases that made even regular fans cringe. <br />
<br />
Mackenzie Looked at herself in the mirror and couldn’t help but look at herself. “I look so sugoi today.” She said, giggling to herself as something in the back of her hand felt disgusted by hearing. It was paid no attention to, her attention going back to the television as her thoughts went to anime yet again. Recalling all of those dreamy anime men and boys, she would sigh as she dreamed of marrying a man like that someday. <br />
<br />
“Mackenzie! You’re gunna be late!” Her mother yelled from upstairs. She got up, as if the shift in weight had been with her all along, and moved over to her closet. Pushing past all of the cosplay outfits, plus size obviously, she put in a black t-shirt with an illustration of the swimming anime Free! on it while picking a pair of pants to wear. They slice up and gave her a bit of a muffintop that was hidden by her shirt. After feeling a chore around her neck and making a cute pose in the mirror with a peace sign, she hurried downstairs to meet the new day. <br />
<br />
“Sorry! I had to clean up my room.” She said while quickly scarfing down breakfast. Her mother didn’t seemed to notice anything different but was pretty upset. <br />
“I thought I told you to clean your room a week ago.” She said in an exhausted tone. <br />
“I will! Right after school, okay? Love you, bye!” Mackenzie kisses her mother goodbye before she could reply and ran out of the door. Once outside, she made her way to...</p>
