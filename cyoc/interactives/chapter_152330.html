<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily decides that her number one target should be Becky. Although there were some many jerks at her old job, Becky was definitely the worst of the worst. She deserved to be given a shittier life, as she has always been the precious bratty queen bee. Emily watched as Becky went right past her table to the other side of the room, where she began to &quot;happily&quot; chat with a family that was there.<br />
<br />
Becky was a bitch, but she always feigned sincerity to get the best tips possible, and it always pissed Emily off. Looking past Becky, the family seemed like your typical, middle class white family. There was a balding, pot bellied father, a tired looking mother, a tween girl and an  8-ish year old boy. They were listening calmly as Becky listed off the specials with her fake nice girl voice.<br />
<br />
Emily wanted to wait as to not involve the family, but she had gotten to a point of rage where she didn&#39;t really care. Becky needed to be punished, and if she had to change some of the family around after that was fine by her. She stealthily took the picture of Becky and the family, and the changes started immediately.<br />
<br />
The father of the family stood up from his seat, while Becky sat down. Emily stared in awe as the two changed. Becky started to age a year a second. Emily watched as her features grew larger and she became beautiful as she aged into young adult hood. Then, she continued to age until she began to look more like her mother as her hair grayed slightly, she gained over 50 pounds, and she stopped as she became nearly 50.<br />
<br />
Her older hair suddenly turned extremely platinum blonde, and way fake, like a woman desperate to keep her youth. He clothes transformed to match that of a Milf, barely fitting her very large breasts or ass. Meanwhile, the father was going through a very different change.<br />
<br />
His height started to rapidly shrink as he dragged faster than Becky had aged. His skin became devoid of wrinkles, his gut completely vanished, and his balding head grew curly black hair. However, his hair kept going before sprouting out past his shoulders, before magically tying up into a messy bun above his head. His figure became skinny and softer, as small breasts sprouted from his chest. Glasses appeared on his face, as his uniform became that of a waitress, Emily could tell he was now a she, no older than 16.<br />
<br />
The son changed next, having a similar change as his father. He shrunk in height as his face became youthful, nearly looking babyish. His hair sprouted into two pig tails while his clothes morphed into a pink dress. He had become a little girl, no older than three. The daughter&#39;s change confused Emily a bit. She didn&#39;t seem to have her age changed, but her hair changed it&#39;s texture as her skin greatly darkened. Before long, she looked as if she could be half hispanic. At first, Emily wondered if she had become adopted, but quickly realized that the new Becky probably slept around.<br />
<br />
The final person to change was the mother, who started to shrink before she vanished behind Becky&#39;s much larger figure. At first, Emily wondered if she had gone somewhere else, but then realized she had seen this change before. Becky&#39;s pudgy stomach became a real bulbous one as the former mother became an unborn child inside Becky&#39;s uterus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; A much hoarser sounding Becky said in her usual bitchy tone. &quot;you better get the order right. Last time I was here that nice waitress Amanda took my order. You&#39;re young, so I don&#39;t want any screw ups. My babies are hungry.&quot; She bitched, sounding like a typical Karen of a mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes m&#39;am.&quot; The new waitress sheepishly replied. &quot;I-I got your meal down no problem.&quot; She said quickly before scurrying to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mama.&quot; The new hispanic child sighed. &quot;Please don&#39;t make a scene again.&quot; She begged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well honey, I can&#39;t help it if these people can&#39;t do their jobs.&quot; She explained. &quot;Why, I was a waitress back during my cheerleader days...&quot; She began to announce. Emily noticed that her daughter were already rolling their eyes, and Emily nearly burst out laughing. Reality changed Becky from the queen bee into a 50 year old slut who peaked in high school. Emily couldn&#39;t think of a better punishment.<br />
&quot;Oh, this is too freaking amazing.&quot; She thought to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, hi.&quot; A quiet voice rose next to her. Emily turned to see the former father, now a cute, nerdy high school girl standing next to her. &quot;Welcome to the Diner, what would you, uh, like to start out with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re taking my order?&quot; Emily asked, surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;We-well, Amanda and Katie told me not too because you used to work her, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s right.&quot; She said, clearly trying to sound brave.<br />
<br />
Emily peaked back to see that Amanda and Katie were throwing dagger eyes at the new girl, clearly pissed that she disobeyed them. Weirdly enough, Emily noticed that Amanda had changed a bit too. She seemed prettier, and a bit more confident. Emily figured that this was because without Becky, Amanda had become queen bee at their high school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thank you...&quot; Emily said before quickly reading her name tag, &quot;Julia, that&#39;s very sweet of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia blushed before beginning to read off some of the specials. Emily, meanwhile, tried to decide what she wanted to do now. She remembered how mean some of those girls could be, and didn&#39;t want Julia to suffer. Should she turn her back into a man and fix that family? If she did she&#39;d also have to restore Becky since she was over there with them. She also wondered if she should just change Amanda, Katie, Mark the manager, or just leave all of them as is and go somewhere new.<br />
<br />
Eventually, she decided to...</p>
