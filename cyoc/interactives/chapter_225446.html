<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Missy Fuller was fuming after the Halloween party, that bitch Spark and her farm boy boyfriend had humiliated her. <br />
She had heard rumors of a store in the mall that sold strange things, magical things. Missy didn’t believe in such things but she believed that there might be something there that would help her get back at Spark and her friends.<br />
<br />
It was odd to see Missy without Vicky, the latter was out of state visiting her family for the holidays.<br />
When the girl got to the store tucked away in the back of the mall where most of the lights were out, she walked into the surprising bright store, there were shelves and crates stacked high and strange things lined the walls and hung from the ceiling.<br />
Missy kept walking until she tripped on a box that stuck out from one of the bottom shelves and fell to the ground.<br />
<br />
“Damn this crappy dump, I’m getting daddy to sue this place.” She grumbled.<br />
<br />
Then a strange sensation overcame her when she saw a strange card. It was white with gold trimmings with a Venus symbol adoring it.<br />
Curiously she took the cars and suddenly her entire body was consumed in a pinkish reddish light, her clothes turned glowing pink and reformed themselves: she now wore an outfit that looked like a mix of schoolgirl and Roman goddess. She wore a tight white blouse that hugged her large breasts with poofy short sleeves with golden rings around the sleeve cuffs and end of the shirt that came just below her rib cage, a red bow tied itself around the collar and her arms were covered in long white gloves with golden bracelets that had a Venus symbol on them, her bottom was covered (barely) by a white pleated skirt with gold and white high heeled boots. Her long blonde hair was in a high ponytail with a golden cuff holding it in place, on her forehead was a golden tiara with a reddish pink gemstone at its center.<br />
<br />
When her transformation was finished she was immediately shocked and embarrassed, she covered one arm over her chest that did nothing to hide her generous chest and tugged at the hem of the tiny skirt. She was used to wearing outfits that showed off her body but this was way too revealing.<br />
Missy looked around for a store employee or even another customer but the magic shop was seemingly empty.<br />
Then the blonde heard a scream from outside, Missy left the store as quickly as she could in the high hells she now wore and saw a monster. It was a strange creature that seemed to be made of ice, wearing a black Japanese school uniform with stiff collar and gold buttons an all. Then she noticed it was in the process of encircling a terrified woman.<br />
<br />
Missy watched in horror as the creature slowly surrounded the woman with ice, the blonde tried to back away but tripped in her new heels and fell to the ground with a thud. The creature noticed this and turned to face her, it laughed with menacing sharp teeth.<br />
<br />
“What are you supposed to be girlie?” It laughed.<br />
<br />
Missy was completely embarrassed but suddenly her body moves on its own: she stood up and, with a smile, stuck a pose, declaring:<br />
<br />
“I am the pretty protector of the solar<br />
system! I fight for love and justice! My name is Guardian Venus!&quot; She was compelled to say with enthusiasm that wasn’t hers.<br />
<br />
The ice monster ceased his laughter, something about what she had said seemed to unnerve the thing for reasons that escaped the girl. Then the ice monster ignored its captive and focused entirely on her, ice bean to form and travel along the ground towards Missy.<br />
She screamed and jumped out of the way with agility she didn’t know she had. There was no time as more ice was coming her way, she dodged again but soon found herself backed into a corner.<br />
<br />
The uniformed ice monster roared with laughter and created a giant axe of ice and prepared to bring it down on the cornered girl. When its axe smashed against the ground there was no blood or body, just the rubble filled ground.<br />
<br />
“Nice try ice man! You’ll have to be faster than that!” A new voice chimed.<br />
<br />
The creature looked back and saw that a new girl had arrived to save the blonde, she had dark skin and black braided pigtails and was dressed similarly to Missy but in red and silver.<br />
<br />
“What is this? Who are you?!” It demanded.<br />
<br />
“Yea, who are you?” Missy agreed.<br />
<br />
“I am also a  pretty protector of the solar<br />
system! I fight for love and justice! My name is Guardian Mercury!” She introduced exactly like Missy had done earlier.<br />
<br />
The ice monster and the blonde were both surprised at this revelation, the creature tried to flee but Mercury had sped over to the thing and kicked it, sending it flying back to the front of the shop. When it got back up it roared and summoned more ice that coated the ground and climbed up the black girls legs, freezing her in place.<br />
<br />
“Aggh! Dammit I’m stuck! Venus you have to take this ice bastard out!” She pleaded.<br />
<br />
Missy was overwhelmed and crawled backwards as the monster come closer. She was stopped when ice shot up her hands and feet, she pulled helplessly and tears began to roll down her cheeks as terror overcame her.<br />
<br />
“Venus! You have to use your magic! You have to—“ the other girl was silenced as the ice enveloped her entire body.<br />
<br />
“L-l-let hee g-go! Stop it!” The blonde cried;<br />
<br />
Missy closed her tear filled eyes and turned her head away from the approaching ice creature.<br />
<br />
N-no! S-s-s-stop! G-get away from me!” She screamed.<br />
<br />
The monster laughed harder and brought his sharp, ice crystal hands closer to her face.<br />
<br />
“I-I s-s-s-said get a-away you freak!” She continued to cry.<br />
<br />
The ice monster laughed and turned to her rescuer, a malicious look on his frozen face,<br />
<br />
“As you wish, maybe I’ll start with your friend here!” It said with a creepy laugh.<br />
<br />
At this Missy’s blood began to boil and she felt a surge of energy flowed through her and she felt a wet sensation in her hands.<br />
<br />
“Leave her alone!” Missy screamed.<br />
<br />
Then a splash of light pushed the creature away and both it and Missy were shocked to see that her hands were free, the ice keeping them frozen to the ground had melted. <br />
Missy looked towards the other girl and saw that she had been freed from her icy containment. <br />
<br />
“What the hell? How did I do that?!” The blonde girl asked.<br />
<br />
“I-It’s totally cheesy and I can’t believe I have to say this out loud but: you used the power of friendship to access your magic and freed us!” Mercury said.<br />
<br />
“You’re a Solar Guardian like me, you are Guardian Venus! You have the power to control water. You can do other stuff too but all that matters now is that you can kick this ice guy’s ass!” She continued.<br />
<br />
Missy nodded and tapped into her magic once again and the ice around them began to melt and the water began to spin around her arms.<br />
<br />
“Double riptide cannon!” She found herself shouting.<br />
<br />
When the ice monster got back up two water tornadoes shot through its body, sending it back down.<br />
<br />
“How dare you prey on women! In the name of the stars I’ll punish you!” She was compelled to say before defeating her enemy.<br />
<br />
“Take this you icy creep!” She shouted and punched the monster.<br />
<br />
When her hit landed the creature’s body melted and the water was sent flying back, turning to mist as it hit the wall.<br />
<br />
Missy helped the other girl up and asked her with a blush,<br />
<br />
“So…do we always have to dress like this?” She asked.<br />
<br />
“I know, they’re very… showy. Not all the time, say power down to return to normal. If you need to transform into Guardian Venus place the tarot card on your bracelets.” Mercury explained.<br />
<br />
When the two magical girls returned to their normal forms Missy noted that the other guardian appeared to be quite the tomboy, she probably didn’t like the skimpy and girly outfits either.<br />
<br />
“I’m Jenna Poole, or Guardian Mercury.” Jenna said.<br />
<br />
“I’m Missy Fuller, I guess I’m Guardian Venus. God that sounds like something from those shows my dorky brother watches.” Missy replied.<br />
<br />
After introductions Jenna explained what she knew of the Solar Guardians and how Guardian Sun’s emergence awakened the other cards.<br />
<br />
“Wait, Guardian Sun is Miranda Desoto?!” The blonde asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I’m her cousin, why? Do you know her?” The black haired girl asked in return.<br />
<br />
Missy adjusted her cute off the shoulder sweater in nervousness unlike her.<br />
<br />
“Yea…we go to the same school, I’ve uh… seen her around.” She explained, keeping out the part about her unpleasant interactions with Miranda and her friends.<br />
<br />
“That’s good, it’s not a coincidence that the Solar Guardians are connected in some way, I think we’re chosen that way. But we can meet up with Miranda after thanksgiving, I myself am supposed to be with my family in Florida. I came back here when I sensed your awakening.” She explained.<br />
<br />
The two finished talking and Jenna transformed then powered up to Astro-mode and sped back to her family in Florida.<br />
Missy walked home and thought about everything that had happened today.<br />
She knew she couldn’t tell her parents or even Vicky, not only was all this strange and frightening but also a little embarrassing.<br />
Then Missy thought to her brother, he was into all this anime crap, maybe he could help her with this stuff, though she shuddered at the thought of showing him her magical girl form.<br />
<br />
When she came come her mom was on the phone with her grandparents and her dad was in his “man cave” in the basement. She went up to her room and pooped on her girly bed and thought about what to do next.</p>
