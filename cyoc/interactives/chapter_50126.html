<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Where did these burns on your hands come from?&quot; Zack had asked June holding them <br />
gently in his. <br />
<br />
The silver/gray Big Bad Wolf had replied, &quot;When we revamped the house yesterday, I was <br />
the she-wolf in charge of wiring. I had to work fast so I ended up with more than one <br />
electric shock.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That isn't fair.&quot; Zack said with total honesty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alpha Female wanted the entire house redone in a day for Master, it's what I had to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That still doesn't make it fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weather it's fair or not it's what Master wanted...what Master wants is what shall happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hands as beautiful as yours shouldn't have to have been damaged.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm... surprised you were able to pick up on them, I thought my fur hid it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It does... but I'm one to keep an eye on detail. And I was able to pick that up soon <br />
enough. I once burned my hands when I was oblivious and stupid with a fire during a <br />
family camping trip. So I know what to look for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I prefer to keep it hidden, it's an imperfection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a badge showing your diligence, you shouldn't be shamed of it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I never thought about it that way before.&quot; June replied nuzzling his side, &quot;Thank you.&quot; <br />
<br />
When Nicole and Alexandra had discussed Zack, both Pearl and June looked at each other <br />
in alarm. Pearl calmed herself though, Nicole hadn't even been so much as sniffing in her <br />
direction, 'She's just making wild guesses now. She's being paranoid. There's no way she <br />
can know about me and Zackery. There's just no way.' Pearl thought. <br />
<br />
June stayed silent, she had been Dared to defend Zack, but the Dare also included <br />
effectively her not to do anything stupid and defending Zack right after Nicole had said <br />
'he'd likely manipulate someone else' would have been a dead give away. <br />
<br />
Pearl and June simply continued their card game. After the incident with Patrick, everyone <br />
had gone back mostly to their tired, lazy, listless attitude of earlier that morning. Everyone <br />
feeling mostly like giant furry slugs. <br />
<br />
For June, the Dare now kept her in place to keep Zack's standing from getting any worse. <br />
For Pearl it was... complicated. She had certainly felt Zack's pheromones get the better of <br />
her, and she also knew she had -let- them get the better of her. And every word Zack had <br />
said made sense, at least to Pearl.  And he had been so good the night before. Pearl <br />
wondered if she had committed treason with the use of her turn. 'No,' She rationalized to <br />
herself, 'This was for the good of the pack. Zack is our most potent male sans Master of <br />
course. Having his negative standing get worse or not improve is detrimental to the pack <br />
as a whole, and June ratting on me and Zackery would have ruined things for him even <br />
more, and that can't be allowed to happen.' <br />
<br />
Pearl breathed in deep, Zack's scent gone from the air, but his image still filled her mind. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Jensen just waved The Dentist's question, not wanting to debate the subject.  &quot;Nad noh.&quot;  <br />
'Not now.' <br />
<br />
The dentist said, &quot;I'll... I'll be just forewording the bill to your parents...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen only nodded, apparently assuring the dentist at the same time that Jensen hadn't <br />
eaten them. <br />
<br />
The Big Bad Wolf got out of the dental chair, being careful not to hit the ceiling and ducks <br />
under the doorway and went down the hallway again to the waiting room where Isabelle <br />
was calmly going through several magazines to kill time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everything go okay Master?&quot;  The dark brown version of Kaylee asked. <br />
<br />
Jensen opened his mouth, but instead just nodded, not wanting to try and speak through <br />
the Novocain. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's good Master.&quot; Isabelle nodded looking happy. &quot;Are we free to go?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jensen nodded again. Isabelle tossed the magazine aside and got up and took Jensen's <br />
arm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Next.&quot; The woman at the desk. <br />
<br />
&quot;That means you Billy.&quot; <br />
<br />
The mother said getting up and taking hold of her son's hand and taking away the dang <br />
candy already (she hadn't done it before just so he wouldn't cause a uproar again).  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey wait.&quot; Billy said rushing over to Isabelle again. The mother couldn't believe this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you ask your boss if you can bite me? I wanna be a werewolf too.&quot; <br />
<br />
Isabelle looked at Jensen who shook his head. Not wanting the complication of another <br />
new pack member at the moment.  Maybe he'd find some replacements if Fran's family <br />
didn't work out somehow, but not now. <br />
<br />
Isabelle turned to the boy and actually ruffled his hair which nearly made the mother faint. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm very sorry. I'm sure you'd be a good addition to the pack. But Master doesn't want me <br />
adding random people to our pack. Sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhhh.&quot; The boy looked quite disappointed by this but reluctantly accepted this. His <br />
mother finally got her senses together at the impossible thing her son was doing and <br />
pulled Billy away. <br />
<br />
Isabelle glanced at the boy's full name at the paper work on the desk in case Master ever <br />
changed his mind. Not likely, but a good back up. Isabelle thought, 'If someone is willing <br />
brainwashed, does it even count as brainwashing?' <br />
<br />
Jesen began to leave the office and Isabelle loyally followed ducking under the door frame <br />
again and being careful not to break the glass door while exiting. <br />
<br />
With that, the two Big Bad Wolves made made their speedy way back to the estate. This <br />
time avoiding the sights. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Jack and Marcine were in the backyard still of course. They had been grassing and <br />
enjoying each other, any part of civilization that would entice them to return to being <br />
human become meaningless and forgotten as time passed, leaving nothing but the <br />
indifferent and negative. When they saw the five pups, Martha, and a new four legged <br />
black and gold wolf beast enter the backyard, they didn't even look at each other as they <br />
quickly hid behind the trees. <br />
<br />
The wolves sniffed the air and Alice riding the big one pointed right at them. <br />
<br />
&quot;There they are, among the tulgey foliage.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't look tulgey to me.&quot; Responded Mr. P. <br />
<br />
&quot;The trees are thick there and it is shaded and somewhat dark, so tulgey fits if I do say so <br />
myself.&quot;   Alice responded. <br />
<br />
&quot;They haven't attracted any new deer yet.&quot; Bart said disappointed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well it has been less dan twelve hours since der transformation was finished.&quot; Jenny said, <br />
&quot;Their musk was specially made ta attract dem though, so am sure we'll be seein' more <br />
soon enough. It's not like we're gonna burn through our bank account in a week just <br />
feeding the pack and paying the utility bills.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bart nodded. <br />
<br />
Alice happily waved at the deer and pointed standing up on the giant wolf. &quot;Please go that <br />
way Mr. P!&quot; Alice ever so gently kicked his sides. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please calls me Grandpa.&quot;  Mr. P said as he got closer, he deer began to inch away. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is okay!&quot; Alice waved again, &quot;This is Mr. P! He's okay!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny sighed, &quot;Dey can only communicate with other deer now remember Alice? Yer just <br />
sayin' a bunch of meaningless sounds to'em.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mr. P stopped as Alice started. &quot;Oh... I see. I remember now.&quot; Alice sat down back on Mr P. <br />
&quot;It seems that I have done things in reverse in the outside world, acting as though it was <br />
the mirror world. I have acted first, and thought second, when you are supposed to think <br />
first, then act. For now that I think about it, I see they are now wandering around in big <br />
black boxes, unable to have conversations with anyone else. And few things I dare so say <br />
are little good without conversations. If I was a deer, I would deeply apologize for that <br />
part of the transform now.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Bart and Jenny looked at each other, the older siblings feeling nervous. &quot;We better go see <br />
how the shadows are doing. Don't wanna get left behind by our own shadows after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yer right.&quot; Jenny answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shadows?&quot; Mr. P asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just some people we Dared to do what we'd do whenever there was business that needed <br />
doin', since we can't go outside as wolf kids and expect everyone to see Mr and Mrs Smith.&quot;<br />
<br />
The siblings actually shuddered at how they had been married not three days ago. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. P.&quot; Martha's heads asked at the giant wolf two hands at her sides and the top ones <br />
cupped together, &quot;Can you watch over Alice, Kevin and Marcy while I keep an eye on Bart <br />
and Jenny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't need lookin' aftar.&quot; Jenny said, then Martha's left head looked at her while the <br />
right head kept looking at Mr P. That was all Jenny needed to end her protest. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I can, I'll protect them with my life.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Very good.&quot; Martha bowed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted ya to chase rabbits with again.&quot; Kevin lamented to Bart. <br />
<br />
&quot;Next time we're outside I promise.&quot; Bart assured. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just be aware.&quot; Martha said to Mr. P, &quot;After all, you only have two eyes.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alice will be right with me so that'll leave me one eye each for Marcy and Kevin.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; Martha bowed again and took the two pups hands weather they wished it or not <br />
and led them back inside. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Jesen and Isabelle returned to the estate without fan-fair, merely observing the long but <br />
steady process of junk and furniture being sold via ebay and what not as the UPS and <br />
FedEx drivers only gave passing looks at Jensen and lingering looks at Isabelle's chest. <br />
<br />
The moment they were inside the household Isabelle said at once, &quot;I'll go get you some <br />
fluids Master!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Flueids?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I've had a capping twice before, and I know that you shouldn't be eating anything <br />
sticky so to be better safe than sorry I'll see what I can find!&quot; With that Isabelle was off like <br />
a shot to the kitchen. <br />
<br />
Speaking of which, it was now afternoon easily and Jensen hadn't had anything since <br />
breakfast.<br />
<br />
He returned to the tea room where he found Grace and Hope talking to Kaylee about tiny <br />
details of something but they stopped the moment they picked up his scent. The two <br />
entourage stood right behind Kaylee. <br />
<br />
&quot;Master?&quot; Grace said innocently, &quot;Where is Isabelle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's getting some something to drink... she over reacted, is overreacting to my capping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;EVerything went well?&quot; Kaylee asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. The dentist was actually -surprised- to see that I was the way I am, but he did his <br />
job all the same.&quot; <br />
<br />
All three she-wolves let out a sigh of relief. &quot;That's good news.&quot; Kaylee said for all of them, <br />
&quot;I was worried someone was going to call the zoo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one has yet, so there's no reason for anyone to now. Now let's get lunch started it's <br />
already late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Master!&quot; Kaylee said... she made to call for Pearl... then realized that was kinda <br />
silly cause then Kaylee could just call for everyone to have lunch as well. <br />
<br />
Isabelle arrived with a strange mix of something or other in her paws a moment later <br />
having track down her Master by scent. &quot;I'm sure you're going to love it Master!  And-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isabelle, tell everyone it's lunch time.&quot;  Kaylee interrupted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Alpha Female.&quot; Isabelle almost shoved the drink into her Master's hands and took off <br />
like a shot. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Isabelle went every which way like lightning almost, sadly she didn't know the house as <br />
much as the staff so she kept running into dead ends and bumped a few times into the <br />
walls.  She did however manage to relocate the males and females dens, declare it was <br />
lunch time, totally forgot about the pups and shadows, leading Jensen to wonder where <br />
they were when it was feeding time (as well as forgetting the twins hanging out in the <br />
Master bedroom). <br />
<br />
Making Isabelle meekly admit she had forgotten them, getting a quick tongue lashing from <br />
Kaylee that would have made Jennifer proud, and madly began to search for them again, <br />
this time finding them in the offices, and in the backyard, and the noise Isabelle made was <br />
enough to clue in the twins to the event. <br />
<br />
As was quickly becoming tradition Alice led her mother and auntie into the mirrorverse <br />
after Darla had brought the large package of meat for the whole pack (with a good supply <br />
being delivered each day thanks to the shadow's online ordering). <br />
<br />
Mr. P's bulged of course at the sigh of Alice leading the twins INTO the mirror and actually <br />
felt the cold glass surface to make sure it was solid and was surprised to see the living <br />
glass girl inside the mirror now blond and wearing a victorian era dress along with the <br />
twins. <br />
<br />
All the she wolves however and the males were confused by the presence of the wolf that <br />
was practically as big and bad as Jesen but went on four legs and had gold mixed into the <br />
same shade of black. <br />
<br />
June and Pearl did their best not to intentionally sit right next to Zackery. Pearl did make a <br />
few glances at him, but all the she wolves Nicole included brushed this off as her 'shame' <br />
at having mated with him. Almost no one noticed Pearl slightly rubbing herself looking at <br />
him, June managed to nudge her to stop before anyone else caught on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone!&quot; Jensen declared, &quot;This my Great-Grandfather. My children has re-christened <br />
him 'Mr. P' he is not technically part of the pack, but he is my litter's protector and <br />
guardian besides Pack Omega and also STILL my great-grandfather and will be respected <br />
as such. And he will be given full range of the house and only the pups or myself and my <br />
mate may order him to relocate himself. Is this heard and understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; All the wolves declared. <br />
<br />
Roger chomped through a bone next to Megan, &quot;Now we have another weirdo in the pack.&quot; <br />
<br />
Megan nudged him, &quot;Roger!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Omega, Alice, and now gramps there. We're getting weirder and weirder.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you don't think we weren't weird before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Point.&quot; Roger crushed the cow bone into nothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;You feelin' okay kid?&quot; Sarah asked Ulysses, the lavender and purple wolves sitting on the <br />
floor next to each other by chance. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm... I'm okay... I guess I just feel sorte, left out... the other guys don't look at me, and <br />
I'm no good to any of you, and the pups ignore me, I'm body.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah hugged him, &quot;No such thing as nobody kiddo. Don't ever think that understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... okay.&quot; Young Ulysses said enjoying the hug. <br />
<br />
Maxine actually had her face -buried- in the meat in front of her, and she looked up at <br />
Millie and Robyn saying, &quot;Come on girls, dig in!&quot; Her face all bloody. <br />
<br />
&quot;We're wolves, not moles sugah.&quot; Megenta Robyn replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... I'll eat it one piece at a time ...&quot; Orange and white Millie replied. <br />
<br />
Lunch came and gone, sadly, by the time Mr. P remembered what he needed to speak to <br />
his great-grandson about he was already surrounded by the she-wolves being petted. And <br />
Jensen, Kaylee and her clink, and twins had retired to figure out how they'd go about <br />
recruiting Julie's family into the pack in the next couple of days and had strict orders not <br />
to disturb sans a visit from the police of course (yes, Jensen precisely included that <br />
instruction remembering the incident with Kaylee, Frank and Daryl). <br />
<br />
With that, the pups returned to outside or the office along with the shadows, and Mr. P <br />
following his duty as did Martha. And things returned to the lazy afternoon it had been <br />
before. <br />
<br />
On the roof top, where no one could hear or smell them, June and Pearl looked at the sky <br />
and the clouds passing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wants me to use my turn to make Nicole apologize to Zackery?&quot; June suggested in a <br />
whisper just in case.<br />
<br />
Pearl thought for a few minutes before answering, &quot;No, Nicole -never- flip flops. It would <br />
make everyone suspicious, and the 'always have' clause ... well, I think messing too much <br />
with reality in of itself can't be a good thing. We've all had our old lives erased, I'd rather <br />
we not go around mixing things up more. And it's bad enough I had to use my turn to <br />
make you forgive Zackery. That was just to keep Zackery from getting in more trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think we can seed that Zack isn't such a bad, er, that is, not such a selfish wolf among <br />
the others without tipping off Nicole?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If she begins throwing her weight around again, I think I'll go see Kaylee and tell her so, <br />
Master strictly forbid a pecking order among the lesser pack, so Nicole will have to face <br />
being a hypocrite for kicking Jesen for comparing himself to the others or back off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Until then we just keep an eye on Zackery making sure he's healing properly like Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... he's still good stock,  that should be a decent enough excuse for Nicole unless she <br />
really does get paranoid and just accusing us out of hand. We're all Zackery has right now, <br />
his old friends aren't interacting with him anymore they're so fixated on Alpha Female, we <br />
can't abandon him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't intend to.&quot; Said the Dared June.<br />
<br />
The pair calmly watched the sunset in silence. It was beautiful. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Julie sighed, her going through police records on-line had turned up nothing, both the <br />
hard copies and on-line. She wondered about hiring a detective at this point. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's a pretty sunset mom you should watch.&quot; Said Abbey. <br />
<br />
The fraternal twins were right outside her door. <br />
<br />
&quot;In a minute dear.&quot; Julie excused herself, &quot;Just checking up on Daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's okay, Alice said he is.&quot; <br />
<br />
Julie shook her head when Abbey had left, leaving her girls to their fantasies. <br />
<br />
Julie looked at the card of the fortune teller. Two nights she had been without her <br />
husband. This would mark three this evening. 'I'll try the FBI one last time tomorrow... <br />
after that... what do I have left to lose?' <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Martha danced in front of the sunset for the pups and Mr P., Alice doing her best to mimic <br />
her movements, the sunlight fracturing every which way through Alice's glass body and <br />
tail.</p>
