<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Brian could finish his sentence, I interrupted him by saying, “I knew that would be your immediate <br />
reaction, so just to prove something to you…”  I filled up the glass with water again, held it in front of me <br />
and said, “I wish that once I drink from this glass I’ll turn into the same thing as Brian.”  I quickly downed <br />
the glass of water and slammed it down.  I just grinned at him.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe you,” he said.  “You want to be an airheaded blonde bimbo that almost looks like a live <br />
Barbie doll?”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” I said.  “Just to see what it’s like.”<br />
<br />
“You better not forget how to change us back!” Brian pleaded.<br />
<br />
“Fine,” I said.  “I wish that no matter how airheaded I become I won’t forget how to use the ring’s powers.”  <br />
I glanced at the ring and saw that my fingers looked different.  They appeared to be thinner than before.  The <br />
ring, however, clung tightly to the finger it adorned.  Just like the old woman said it would, I thought.  I <br />
noticed then that my fingernails were growing longer.  “Look, it’s starting,” I said.  “This is weird,” I <br />
giggled.<br />
<br />
Brian looked at his own hands and they were changing in the same manner.  “Oh, this is trippy,” he said.  “My <br />
hands are getting smaller.  And look, the hairs are going away.”  Brian giggled in much the same manner I had.  <br />
<br />
“I know, right?” I agreed with a giggle.  I felt my shirt getting loose.  I also thought I might have been <br />
shrinking slightly.  A pressure built in my chest.  I felt my nipples press against my shirt.  It immediately <br />
produced a sensation I’d never felt.  The extremely pleasurable sensation continued as the shirt suddenly felt <br />
tighter.  I realized what was going on.  “I’m growing tits,” I said.  I put my hands on my chest.  “Oh, god,” <br />
I exclaimed.  <br />
<br />
I looked at Brian who stood in stunned amazement at the sight of two objects steadily growing out from his own <br />
chest.  The two expanding globes pushed further and further out from his body.  It didn’t take long for the <br />
buttons on his button down shirt to show visible strain.  One by one they snapped and shot off in all <br />
directions.  Brian slid the remnants of his shirt off his shoulders.  His breasts continued to grow larger.<br />
<br />
My own breasts were growing as large as his.  They quickly ripped through the polo shirt I wore.  I <br />
aggressively tore the tattered cloth off my body to see my marvelous new tits.  We looked at each other and, <br />
as if we shared thoughts, walked over to each other and rubbed our hands on each other’s breasts.  It was <br />
obvious we had never felt anything like this before.  “They’re so big!” Brian exclaimed.  With another giggle <br />
he added, “I love it!”<br />
<br />
“Me too!” I giggled.  I had to back away from Brian as I felt something happening in my waist.  I felt around <br />
my stomach and found that it was flatter than I could ever remember.  My waistline also contracted several <br />
inches.  I felt a bit of pressure as my waist grew tiny.  As one might expect my pants fell from my waist and <br />
right to the floor.  My boxers soon followed suit, leaving me in my birthday suit.  Brian was left with the <br />
same predicament.<br />
<br />
While my waist continued to narrow my hips and ass changed in opposite manners.  My hips flared out and were <br />
soon wider than my waist.  I was growing into that desired hourglass figure.  My ass was also quite literally <br />
rounding into shape.  I had to put my hands on it to feel the flesh expanding between my fingers.  It caused <br />
me to giggle again.  <br />
<br />
I looked at my legs and found they had grown thinner and were now completely without hair.  I tried to work my <br />
feet out of the pile of clothes.  I could feel that my shoes didn’t fit anymore either.  When they emerged <br />
from the pile of pants I could tell that they were several sizes smaller.  They looked very dainty.<br />
<br />
Now I felt a twisting sensation in my groin.  I looked over my breasts as best as I could.  I saw the tip of <br />
my penis slowly disappearing inward.  “Look, it’s getting smaller,” I giggled.  My voice was sounding higher.<br />
<br />
“Oh, god, this feels strange,” said Brian, also with a voice growing higher.<br />
<br />
Rather than try to see over my enormous tits, I looked at Brian to see what I felt.  His testicles appeared to <br />
pull into his body as his scrotum now looked like just loose hanging skin.  Next the skin pulled up to his <br />
body and separated into two vaginal lips.  His penis grew smaller and smaller until it completely disappeared <br />
into the slit that was now his pussy.  We both moaned loudly and had to grab onto the counter to brace <br />
ourselves.  The impact of this change made me buckle in the knees.<br />
<br />
My throat felt weird and as I reached up to it I felt the Adam’s apple disappear.  “Oh…my…goodness,” I said.  <br />
With each word my voice grew higher and higher until I sounded like Marilyn Monroe.  “Is that really my <br />
voice?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Sure is,” said Brian.  His voice was just as high as mine.  “Is that me?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Sure is,” I giggled at him.<br />
<br />
“Great!” he giggled back at me.<br />
<br />
I looked up and down our bodies.  We were completely female except for our heads.  I felt a tickle on the side <br />
of my head.  I turned and a few tufts of hair hit me in the face.  I took hold of the hair so that I could see <br />
it change.  It was growing longer and thicker.  But it also changed from brown to platinum blonde.  Brian’s <br />
color changed from a lighter shade of brown to more of a honey blonde color.<br />
<br />
I felt the changes take over my face.  My vision blurred for a few seconds before it refocused.  Nothing <br />
seemed to change.  I felt my cheek bones and jaw line altering, presumably into female forms.  I felt my nose <br />
narrow and grow smaller while at the same time my lips became full.  <br />
<br />
The last part of the change was the weirdest.  My thought patterns altered.  So many of the things that I <br />
enjoyed I now found repellent or just not worth my time.  I discovered that I had new thoughts and passions.  <br />
I cared about such previously alien things like makeup and clothes.  I was concerned with the actions of <br />
celebrities.  But most of all, I found that my thoughts were consumed with sex.  The thought of sex just made <br />
me giggle.  I couldn’t wait to feel a nice big cock inside of me.  “OMG, did I just think that?” I said aloud.  <br />
“OMG, did I just say ‘OMG?’”<br />
<br />
Brian’s changes had also finished.  He giggled at me.  “I know what you were thinking,” he said in his sexy <br />
voice.  “You were thinking about cocks.”<br />
<br />
“You’re right, I was!” I laughed.  We jumped up and down simultaneously.  Apparently this was a great moment <br />
for us.  I did love the feeling of my bountiful breasts bouncing up and down, however.  “Let’s see what we <br />
look like!” I said.<br />
<br />
We ran into the bathroom and looked at ourselves in the mirror.  “OMG, we are fucking gorgeous,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yea, we are,” Brian agreed.<br />
<br />
The best way to describe our appearance was that we looked like what would probably the wet dream of most men.  <br />
We had huge breasts, perfect hourglass figures, shapely asses, long legs, long hair and apparently not much <br />
going on upstairs.<br />
<br />
“This still feels kinda weird,” said Brian as he ran his hands over his body.  “But it feels like, normal, <br />
too.”<br />
<br />
“Yea, I know, like, what you mean,” I agreed.  “OMG, are we too dumb?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” said Brian.  “Maybe?” he asked without a trace of certainty in his voice.  “You can fix it, <br />
right?”<br />
<br />
“Yea,” I said.  “Look, the ring still fits.  That old woman said it couldn’t be, like, taken off or <br />
something.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, good,” said Brian.<br />
<br />
Just at that moment we heard a sound come from the living room.  It was the sound of a key turning in the lock <br />
at the front door.  We heard the door open and someone walked in.  “Hello?” called out a familiar voice.  <br />
Without thinking we dashed out of the bathroom to see…</p>
