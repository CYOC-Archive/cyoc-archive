<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas was nervous. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d been going through job interviews for weeks now, and still something wasn&#39;t clicking. The people weren&#39;t calling him back, except for the lowest of the low that he applied only jokingly. He didn&#39;t want to drone for some company that would waste all his potential and suck out all his motivation within the first three years. He wanted something great. <br />
<br />
Which was why he was sitting in an office at Richard and Son Inc. They&#39;d recently sent new ads in the papers for dynamic new blood for a new division. A perfect opportunity for someone without too much experience. Companies might be willing to risk an unknown if he could prove his credentials, his value.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for receiving me,&quot; Thomas told the young man in a grey suit sitting at the desk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your resume intrigued me,&quot; the interviewer said, his voice deeper and older than Thomas had expected. Stranger still, his lips hadn&#39;t moved. Ventriloquism? During a job interview?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear that,&quot; Thomas replied, hoping to make eye contact. The interviewer&#39;s gaze remained down on his tablet. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, don&#39;t talk with my secretary,&quot; the voice piped up again. &quot;Real men look their prospective bosses in the eyes before trying to drag them into their bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
The apparent secretary sighed, as if tired of something being repeated, and leaned back from his seat. Through the glass top of the desk, Thomas could see... <br />
<br />
Thomas blinked and, blushing, looked down at the man&#39;s crotch. He repressed a sigh and licked his lips as he realized that the man&#39;s pants were undone, and that his cock was standing up, stiff and captivating. A little over average, with round balls that looked full to bursting. The few pubes he could see around the well-trimmed dick were greyer than the secretary&#39;s hair. Was the man wearing dye?<br />
<br />
The dick twitched. &quot;That&#39;s right. I&#39;m the one asking the questions here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas glanced at his watch, then touched his wrist to feel his pulse. What the fuck was happening?<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you&#39;re not hallucinating. I&#39;m Richard Thompson, dick-head of this company. Yes, I&#39;m a talking penis. You&#39;ve been staring at my assistant, Levi. Now, let me get straight to the point. I&#39;m looking to create a new department full of men with real ideas and real ambition to get a project close to my heart off the ground. It won&#39;t be easy, or simple, but I will manage, and I have a feeling you can help me. Can you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, I promise you. If you hire me, I will stop at nothing to make your dream a reality,&quot; Thomas said, strongly, realizing a few seconds later that he did mean it.<br />
<br />
The cock twitched again. &quot;That&#39;s what I love to hear. That project means that I want to hire people that will be working full-time here. I don&#39;t mean a sissy&#39;s forty hours week &#39;full-time&#39;. I mean twenty-four, seven, every week, every month, till this is done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas paused. &quot;Sir, how would it be possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
The secretary mouthed something Thomas didn&#39;t catch and one of his hands slid down to stroke Richard&#39;s shaft. &quot;Possible? Ah! Son, it&#39;s the only schedule possible for what I want. I&#39;m asking you to take a manager&#39;s post as part of my new department of dicks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas&#39; heart skipped a beat. Manager? Right away? Fuck, he didn&#39;t care what kind of grueling conditions needed to be met, he was going to get that job. Deparment of whatever, he&#39;d take it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got the right guy for the job. What do you need from me?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;I want males that get the reality of my new customers. Our target demographics. Who else but a dick can understand another? To get this job, you need to show understanding of your cock. To *become* your cock. Go ahead, drop &#39;em so we see what we&#39;d work with here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas unzipped his pants and put one thumb around his boxers&#39; elastic. With but a second of hesitation, he pushed them down and freed his cock. He was only half-hard, to his embarrassment. He&#39;d gotten excited through that interview, but not this way. Curse of being a grower, right? Well, he could change that, he thought with a shiver of excitement. His shaft seemed to pulse as he readied himself for a show. <br />
<br />
He began by teasing his dickhead, the same way he always did. Rubbed his slit through his foreskin. He was rewarded by a first wave of pleasure, and a rush of blood to his shaft. Twitching, it began to rise under the approving hum of his soon-to-be boss. <br />
<br />
Thomas let his head roll back at first, pumping lazily to get himself to full-length. <br />
<br />
Levi&#39;s dick was still aimed straight at him. He was being observed by a cock. His future boss. A dick. A dick, he was going to become a dick. His dick. It was insane. It was so, so fucking insane, and so fucking hot. He&#39;d never thought of it before. But now he was wondering what it would be like to be just a penis. To lose all control and be reduced to a sexual organ. To exist only as a dick. <br />
<br />
He was going to... to c-... <br />
<br />
No. <br />
<br />
Thomas&#39; hands stilled. His heart and soul begged him to continue, to just *push* past the tipping point, to let his seed out, but he was too disciplined to succumb. Even if his dick was so hard it almost hurt, he wouldn&#39;t just ruin his opportunity like this. He&#39;d cum later. <br />
<br />
The secretary stood up, and aimed his tablet at Thomas&#39; crotch. The strange sight did nothing to calm Thomas down. Worse, when he realized the man was taking pictures, Thomas grinned and flexed, taking his cock back in hand to pose for the camera. For a good fifteen seconds, no sound rang in the office except for the clicks of photography. <br />
<br />
&quot;Son, you appear to have all the qualifications I look for in a new recruit. Welcome to the team.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thomas bowed his head, grinning. &quot;Thank you, sir, you won&#39;t regret it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He offered his hand - the same one he&#39;d been using - to the secretary. He had almost gone for Richard Thompson, but well, that would have been inappropriate behavior toward his superior, huh? <br />
<br />
Richard must have noticed, for he chuckled too and a few drops of pre oozed from his slit. &quot;Levi.&quot;<br />
<br />
The secretary smirked, for the first time, he looked Thomas in the eyes, and there was mischief and lust in that gaze. He entered some sort of password in his tablet, and Thomas heard the click, and saw the flash before he realized what was happening. Then, he landed on top of large leather tents - his shoes. It startled a laugh out of Thomas, and it was when he was trying to curl over through his amusement that he noticed his lack of limbs. No arms, no legs, just balls weighting the lower parts of him, foreskin around his &#39;neck&#39; and a dickhead hat was lying on cool tiles. <br />
<br />
Done. He was a dick. He was a dick! Fuck, that was the hottest thing he&#39;d ever imagined, and it was happening to him, live!  <br />
<br />
The secretary, now a giant taller than a building, leaned over the desk. A hand wider than a car descended toward Thomas, who felt a shrill of thrill from the sight, which only served to make him harder. Fuck. The rough fingers closed over his entire body, lifting him without delicacy, without care. The gesture was so automatic, indifferent. Like he was a toy at best. <br />
<br />
Thomas choked on the liquid bubbling up his &#39;throat&#39;. And he recognized the taste. Bittersweet. Fuck. Fuuuck. This was the best feeling ever!<br />
<br />
A drawer on the desk opened with the rumbling of rolling wheels, and Thomas only had a second to examine it before he was hit by the weightlessness of his fall. Luckily, he landed on top of a squishy, soft material. <br />
<br />
Balls. Another cock. A big, long, snakey cock, just like him, except darker. <br />
<br />
Thomas lost sight of the rest as his balls clenched from sheer excitement and his body spewed cum all over the desk&#39;s drawer. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Levi hummed to himself as he entered their newest employees&#39; profile in the system&#39;s database. <br />
<br />
[Thomas Wilson, male, caucasian, age 27, nine inches, uncut, grower, full-time employment. Manager of the Dick Department, under Danniel Thompson, Gerald Brown and Richard Thompson.]<br />
<br />
[Eduardo Martinez, male, latino, age 25, eight inches, uncut, shower, full-time employment. Assistant-Manager of the Dick Department, under Danniel Thompson, Gerald Brown and Richard Thompson.]<br />
<br />
[Jonas Smith, male, black, age 25, eight inches, cut, shower, full-time employment. Assistant-Manager of the Dick Department, under Danniel Thompson, Gerald Brown and Richard Thompson.]<br />
<br />
[Tyler Jones, male, caucasian, age 22, five inches, uncut, shower, full-time employment. Beta tester, toy.]<br />
<br />
[Logan Wilfrid, male, caucasian, age 28, seven inches, cut, shower, full-time employment. Beta tester, toy.]<br />
<br />
When every blank case had been filled, Levi held the screen to level with his- with Richard. He suppressed a shudder as Richard jolted and bobbed a little, as if he wanted to get closer. Finally, Richard stopped when his dickhead was so close he could see his reflection in the screen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, yes, yes, everything is in order. We seem to be getting a nice crop of good cocks, aren&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, sir. Shall we slow down the recruiting process?&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard stiffened, to the point Levi winced. He was so tempted to just, put both his hands on his boss and beat him off until he saw stars. He couldn&#39;t. He musn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding, Levi? We&#39;re expending! I want a full department of vigorous young males with ideas to conquer the world! You know, the usual business spiel.&quot;</p>
