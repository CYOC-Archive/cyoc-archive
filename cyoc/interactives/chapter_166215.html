<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff being then Jerome for most of a wild and crazy day had gained a liking of the smells accorded to dog sex and the lustiness of mating. As Jeff sat on his flat furry butt in the kitchen, his tart aroma was beginning to taint even the healthier smells of dinner cooking on the stove.<br />
<br />
Father sat reading a magazine as he waited for the meal to get set onto the table. The smell of a dirty dog was similar to the smell of wet fur and a distraught father did not like his daughter owning the mutt.<br />
<br />
When Lisa entered the kitchen her nose wrinkled at the foul smell her dog wafted into the air. &quot;Jerome, you stink, you need a bath, now outside with you, and I shall give you a bath after we eat or dinner!&quot;<br />
<br />
To the surprise of Father and Mom, the big dog rose to standing and summarily obeyed his master, and Lisa opening the service door, Jerome marched outside the house. Jeff was in control of his Doberman dog self right then and sat down on the porch to await when Lisa would bring him his evening dinner.<br />
<br />
As the small family set down to their evening meal, it was Father who asked his daughter, &quot;Lisa, it might be my imagination but you dog appears to have grown bigger in his maleness. At the least his... his balls look larger than they did, so maybe its a good time to have him castrated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Castrate Jerome,&quot; Lisa blurted out the stunning thought, &quot;His gender gives him character, I will think about what you suggested, but let me think about something that drastic!&quot;<br />
<br />
The evening meal and conversation turned to items of family and business news, as Lisa listened and ate her meal, she thinking about her nightly frolic fun she and Jerome had so enjoyed.<br />
<br />
When after the meal was gone and as a usual Father would read a chapter of scripture from the family bible, they would bow their heads as he then spoke a prayer of thankfulness. Lisa was up quick after the family devotions to help with cleaning the dishes before then to attend to her dirty dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Jerome..., time now for me to shower you clean to smelling nice again.&quot; Lisa said as she opened the kitchen door to let Jerome back as inside the house. Jerome obeyed and walking along at her right side, Lisa walked her pet up the stairs and to her bedroom. Once they both were inside the bedroom Lisa closed the door and looked down at her dogged brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you roam today, you stink, smell like you did after we enjoyed a wild night of hot sex?<br />
<br />
Did you meet some Bitch?&quot; Lisa asked, and her doggy did nod his head to specify a Yes answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many time did you mate today, bark once for each orgasm you enjoyed?&quot; Lisa asked of her brother transformed to being a grown Doberman dog.<br />
<br />
As Jeff in his doberman dog form did whine, he then barked eleven times as to the total number of orgasms he had so enjoyed during that fated day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eleven, and all with various dogs,&quot; Lisa said, as she began to disrobe.<br />
<br />
Jerome then wagged his head to try as tell the truth about his day.<br />
<br />
What is this, you saying no, as not... all of whom you mated with were dogs? You mated with other animals?&quot; Lisa asked, as trying to get the fuller story from yes or no answers was arduous at best.<br />
<br />
As again Jerome wagged his big head to signify a No answer.<br />
<br />
Let me understand you better, as you specified eleven orgasms, and some with a Bitch, or more than one Bitch, right?&quot; Lisa asked, as Jerome nodded his big doggy head. &quot;You mated with other dogs, as only dogs, right?&quot; Las asked as she wondered what Jerome was trying to be specific about.<br />
<br />
Jerome barked once and did wag his head, as he then stepped forward and began sniffing at his sisterly&#39; crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU mated with a woman?&quot; Lisa said as she surmised what Jerome meant from his sniffing of her damp feeling labia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woof, woof, woof,&quot; Jerome barked three times as then to be specific or tell as of how many times he had enjoyed his orgasmic sensations with a hot, as welcoming, naked womanly mate lying sunning her lovely self.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me, you need a showering bath,&quot; Lisa said and as she being in a bra and panties did walk from her bedroom to the upstairs bathroom, Jerome followed her, prancing and feeling quite elated.<br />
<br />
Lisa turned on the shower faucets and adjusted the water to a mildly warm temperature. As then Jerome walked inside the shower stall, his bulked self almost leaving no room where Lisa could stand. As did her bra fall to the bathroom floor her panties she slid off her legs, she stepped inside the shower stall and closing the glass door she immediately noted the cramped space.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh brother, this won&#39;t work,&quot; Lisa said, as a moment later and Jerome rose to him standing on his hind legs and paws. Two upright bodies had ample room for allowing the washing down of each as Jerome the Doberman stood being a few inches taller than was his human sister.<br />
<br />
Lisa reached for the bar of Glycerin soap and began her suds-washing the furred stout male body standing snugly against her naked body.<br />
<br />
&quot;This should wash off the sexual crud you bathed in during your day being FREE!&quot; Lisa said as when she went to say the word &quot;Free,&quot; she near screamed, as felt then a large erect male doberman dog cock slip inside her vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Jerome, not here, not now..., oh, oh, oh, it feels so much bigger!&quot;</p>
