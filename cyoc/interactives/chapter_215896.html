<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad opened his eyes blearily. He had snored a little and had rolled over lazily quite a bit. Then again, he was in a great bed, he thought. It was soft and fresh and smelled divine. Just like he liked it: a whiff of hay, crunching leaves of all sizes, surrounded by a lush vegetation and a canopy of trees, in a great warm atmosphere, along with a touch of earthy fertile smell... Wait, what?!? Chad made his eyes snap open in alarm. His new instincts had invaded his brain all the faster because of his sleep and drowsiness. He rose up, panicked. This wasn&#39;t right! He looked at himself, appalled. He was still a gorilla! And worse, a female gorilla, complete with its vagina and vulva, along with its expecting openning and labia! Ugh! Couldn&#39;t he have been a male gorilla, at least? A silverback bursting with testosterone and and a happy and plentiful harem? Oh no, he could not have a harem, he had to be part of one!... On his knuckles, he went around the enclosure and its tough glass walls. He tried to break one pane of glass and clearly it could withstand more than his puny punches. He yelled but only grunts came out of his mouth. He went around on his knuckles and could just see an observation room beyond on pane of glass, empty for the time being. Tired and annoyed, Chad just sat on the ground. He was angry. He didn&#39;t want to be a girl! Let alone one of baby-carrying age! He cursed Damian aplenty in his head, as his throat was now lacking decent vocal chords. Was he really to integrate a gorilla group and be part of a harem? Do make babies? Certainly, as this was a zoo and gorillas an endangered species. Yet it wasn&#39;t too bad here. She&#39;d get fed soon with crunchy vegetables, sweet fruits and healthy fibres, along with a sugarcane piece if she was good and lucky. And if she did not like being alone maybe she&#39;d get girlfriends later who&#39;d groom her and make her pretty and... Chad shook his head violently. No! He must not think like that! Or else he was lost! As he sat there wallowing in his own misery, he lost track of time and jumped as he saw some vets and zoo employees in the observation room. He ran towards it and tried to tell them he wanted out of here, because he was not a female gorilla, not really. <br />
&quot;She looks a bit frantic, does she not?&quot; said a veterinarian named Maria.<br />
&quot;Oh, she must be a bit panicked at being in a new environment. But she&#39;ll get used to it fast. It&#39;s perfect for her,&quot; said a male zoo employee. <br />
&quot;Gorillas ARE highly social animals,&quot; nodded a male vet. &quot;She&#39;ll feel much better once she meets Maestro.&quot;<br />
The other people smiled in agreement and pressed a few buttons and made a few calls. No! No! He didn&#39;t want this! They had it all wrong! He wanted out and not meet any &quot;Maestro&quot;! Actually... Who was he? Hopefully a vet! But with a name like that, Chad had a very nasty feeling about it all... But Chad could of course only produce shrieks and grunts and the humans on the other side interpreted that as her being hungry and a bit lost. They made orders to let Maestro in on a leash so as to avoid him harming Chad. <br />
<br />
So Chad backed away when he saw arrive a huge silverback gorilla who zeroed in on her at once. His eyes sparkled immediately with lust and interest and he sniffed the air appreciatively. Chad knew instinctively that he must be reeking female pheromones and that his new body was pumping them in the air at an alarming rate. In fact, he could smell those of Maestro and he himself was beating Chad&#39;s amount of secretions by a long run. And his testicles must be pumping sperm copiously because his penis was already erect, ready to impregnate Chad fast and well. Chad was surprised at how tiny the penis of the male gorilla was. And it was erect, dripping pre-cum already. It was... unexpected? Were all male gorillas like that? Or was Maestro just tiny and had a micro-penis? Gorillas being strong and with lots of females, he would have thought... At least it wouldn&#39;t hurt him. Hopefully. However, his own new genitalia were not much better, considering they were alienly female and seemingly out of his control. Completely so. His labia and clitoris were as engorged with blood as Maestro&#39;s penis. Receiving nutrients and oxygen and energy to prepare for the mating. His vaginal muscles were impatient too, clenching on emptiness and sending messages of frustration to their owner about having nothing to squeeze and milk. It wanted Maestro&#39;s seed and it wanted it now! The source of semen and baby the womb wanted to carry was right there! Cum was leaking, with no sign of stopping. Chad put his hand on his crotch to stop the flow, ion spite of his disgust but it only excited him, the touch feeling like a masturbation. He cursed himself. Ugh! This was revolting! He wasn&#39;t supposed to enjoy this! But as he tried in vain to stop his arousal fluids, he rubbed himself and it only excited him more. Before he knew it, he was touching and rubbing his labia and clitoris, giving in to his new urges, letting the shame bother him later. This sight got Maestro even more excited and he tugged on his leash, furious in his tantalizing temptation. As Chad had his first climax as a female gorilla, Maestro would have giving anything to mount her, the young nubile temptress! In gorilla years, Chad was past puberty and well into sexual maturity so yes, his body was focused upon mating and bearing babies. He couldn&#39;t help it. His human mind was no match. And Chad realized that his masturbation session, although satisfying, was a paltry substitute for the real pheromone and sperm provider in front of him. He was a short way away. And his vaginal muscles were clenching around a non-existent penis, demanding more urgently. Should he lose himself, even for a few moments? Would it be just too shameful afterwards? Should he become a gorilla sperm dumpster to satisfy his mounting frustration and lust?</p>
