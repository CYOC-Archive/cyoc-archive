<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">'You do realize. That I don't get the instincts or mentality of a tick like this right?' Julio <br />
thought to Keiko. <br />
<br />
The kitesune didn't react at all surprised to the tick thinking to her. 'Oh I know. So just <br />
continue sucking and I'm sure you'll be fine. Don't worry I can take it.' Keiko thought back. <br />
<br />
'So a tick. I wasn't far off with the flea guess was I?'<br />
<br />
'I suppose not. But look at the bright side. This lasts until either my sisters get back, or <br />
they don't get back in a few hours, and then you and I have to save them. Since I'm not <br />
letting everything within multiple miles be turned into glass by a bunch of angry genies.'<br />
<br />
'Can I ask you a question?'<br />
<br />
'Yes. As for an answer, well, since you're already 'tricked' or ticked, no point in playing <br />
games.'<br />
<br />
'Ha ha. Not funny. So tell me, what do you think of project Return?' <br />
<br />
'Project what? I heard sis mention it one or two times but never got the details.'<br />
<br />
'Mythicals stop hiding as if they were criminals.' <br />
<br />
'Ah! Interesting! Might make things much more interesting, when people KNOW there is <br />
such a thing as a kitesune, people will be less likely to believe 'oh that's just Sunrise Inc' <br />
excuse for a kitesune's games...'  <br />
<br />
'Aren't you worried about trophy hunters? Or paranoids?'<br />
<br />
'If they're dumb enough to come after a kitesune then they'll get what's coming to them.' <br />
<br />
'Granted.' Julio said. <br />
<br />
'As long as we're on the subject my temporary free-loader, what do you think of it?'<br />
<br />
'It'll either create mass paranoia, though medical studies show there's plenty of that <br />
already, resulting in the possible loss of Knowledge I seek... or force hidden and/or <br />
forbidden libraries to open their doors more, making things a lot more easy for me to <br />
gather what I need and want to know.' <br />
<br />
'I asked what you thought of it. Not what you think the out come will be.'<br />
<br />
'Heh. Count on a kitesune to be that sharp. Very well, I believe, that is a wild card for me. <br />
BUT, I have noticed how the paranoia for those on the other side of the veil has only <br />
INCREASED over the years. They see humans as much the strange alien species as humans <br />
see them thought 99% of them are all native to this rock anyway!' <br />
<br />
'And that 1%?'<br />
<br />
'Alternate planes of reality.'<br />
<br />
'Ah. What about ETs?'<br />
<br />
'Magic SCARES them. So they like to keep far, far, far away from Earth or any other world <br />
that has a power that works on a set of rules independent from science.' <br />
<br />
'My kitesune memories tell me it's interesting to find a human nowadays who realizes <br />
magic has rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I'm not really a 'nowadays human' you know. And you have kitesune memories?'<br />
<br />
'Just some implanted knowledge to help me get by. I don't actually feel as 'amoral' as I've <br />
always been told most kitesune are.'<br />
<br />
'It does, and it does not have to do with that you used to be human.'<br />
<br />
'Oh? Do tell.'<br />
<br />
'Simple. You had a human UPBRINGING, that means you were taught human values and <br />
customs, and not to mention you have several humans you've GOTTEN TO KNOW, <br />
something most kitesune have not done.'<br />
<br />
'Ah. I see. Very interesting. Maybe I -should- try that saki now... since your feeding off my <br />
blood stream, we'll both get drunk.' <br />
<br />
'I'd worry about it killing me... but even in this form most of my safety precautions should <br />
hold together.'<br />
<br />
'Safety precautions?'<br />
<br />
'Even if you don't die of old age, there are plenty of other ways to die. I'm just glade I <br />
didn't decide to risk visiting Hiroshima because of the war. OOPS! Sorry! Didn't mean to <br />
bring that up.'<br />
<br />
'Forgiven. And don't worry about it or fixation on it and I won't. So any interesting secret <br />
you can afford to tell me about The Knowledge I could barter with some of my natural <br />
born kitesune relatives to get them to pretend to be more civilized?'<br />
<br />
'I worked hard for that knowledge, it isn't for free.'<br />
<br />
'Okay.' Keiko took a swing of the Saki. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
Kyriel and 'Abu Isa' were led by the kitesune adorned in trinkets but wearing a loincloth. <br />
Tamthis' City was a strange mix of actual Arab customs, Hollywood stereotypes, the <br />
shades of Karther's incredibly perverted fantasies, and Tamthis' own imagination. <br />
<br />
Kyriel shuddered as she walked past several pillars, sensing the living souls that flowed <br />
through them and through the rest of the palace, effective making it a living thing almost. <br />
Tabra/Tabris's memories showed her mad experiments others had done in the past to try <br />
and bind living souls to objects, Jake/Janice's memories showed her the movie <br />
Frankenstein's&nbsp;&nbsp;Monster. <br />
<br />
The great hall the the two foxes were led down showed in mosaics several Arabian fairy <br />
tales, with kitesune of course. <br />
<br />
' 'You haven't heard Shakespeare until you've heard it in the original Klingon.' ' Another of <br />
Jake/Janice's memories came to the surface. The fully grown but still newborn angel sent a <br />
telepathic message to her senior. 'Jasmine. We're nearing the throne room now. Make <br />
whatever excuse you have to but home in on me and get here, I'll keep <br />
Tammie/Tammia/Tamthis/Tommy talking, or rather, Akane/Abu Isa will.' <br />
<br />
'Humans and you love of names.'<br />
<br />
'I'm NOT human. Now come on.' <br />
<br />
Jasmine would have made a dignified report about respecting your elders, but Kyriel had a <br />
point about them being on a deadline they couldn't afford to miss. Well, Kyriel and her <br />
friends couldn't afford to miss. But Jasmine was nothing if not dutiful. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, I need to go.&quot; Jasmine said.<br />
<br />
Kathy merely looked at her odd for a second then nodded and said, &quot;The bathroom is that <br />
way.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jasmine groaned and left in that direction then doubled back the moment she was out of <br />
site. <br />
<br />
The sisters of course and Alexandra weren't fooled. Erica had brought the vixen back from <br />
the smaller room she had placed her so her inevitable outburst wouldn't be seen by the <br />
shiva guard and Kathy. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be there to see it.&quot; Alexandra said, not nearly low enough. <br />
<br />
&quot;See what?&quot; Kathy innocently asked. <br />
<br />
Alexandra didn't even look at her. Lisa however covered by saying, &quot;I think she just wants <br />
to be there when our husbands meet that's all.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm sure I could figure out something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna wondered if thinking made this vixen's head hurt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Alexandra asked, STILL not looking her Karther's corpse in the eye. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's quite all right,&quot; Vicki said, &quot;We don't want to get in the way, and I'm sure we have <br />
other things to do.&quot; <br />
<br />
Luna and Erica casually sat next to the Shiva vixen on both sides, not drawing it's alarm in <br />
the least. <br />
<br />
Vicki sat in a relaxed pose behind Kathy. <br />
<br />
Lisa made sure that Alexandra didn't sit next to Kathy, least Karther's devoted strangled <br />
an innocent woman. There was still a powerful sense of disbelief and un-reality among the <br />
vixens. Karther was gone. Non-existent. Deader than dead. It was disorienting. All the <br />
ways all of them had thought about how they'd pay him back for what he had done. And <br />
now they'd never have the chance. It also felt like a sick joke by someone.  And Kathy sat, <br />
happily oblivious to all of it. <br />
<br />
When Kyriel saw the throne room, she knew that Tamthis was loyal to Karther's legacy. <br />
The throne appeared to be made out of nude marble vixens, some squatting, some <br />
standing, some leaning, all supporting the seater with themselves and their bodies. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome! Welcome! Welcome to my humble city!&quot; Said the kitesune they had seen days <br />
before that had turned Karther into a vixen. He was taller now, more muscular, brighter <br />
and smoother fur, more tails. He had also adopted Karther's totally immodest lack of dress <br />
save for a few items to mark his station as Amir over all that he saw including a copy of <br />
Karther's cape but resized for the much taller kitesune. Karther had always been short. <br />
<br />
'No moves until Jasmine gets here.' Kryiel thought to Abu Isa, 'Jasmine, try to get into a <br />
good position to come at him from behind, don't burst in unless you're discovered. If we <br />
can end this quick and painlessly, so much the better.' <br />
<br />
&quot;It is an honor to be her oh honored Amir Tamthis.&quot; Abu Isa bowed. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is my honored to be visited upon by you oh Shiek! With help of ones like you, the <br />
people and nations of the world will have no choice but to knowledge my kingdom. And <br />
denounce the cowardly dogs who'd attack those under a white flag, dogs I say, dogs! Oh <br />
excuse me, that is not your concern. Please, please tell me what you've thought of my city <br />
so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
'I can think of a few choice words.' Kyriel thought, 'Get a hold of yourself Kyriel, he's only <br />
this way because of Karther's botched magic, just like everyone else here. The person <br />
responsible for all this is already dead. Free Tammy/Tommy and everything should go <br />
back to normal...normal? With project return? Then again, that IS normal, people have just <br />
been lied to for centuries about what 'normal' is.'<br />
<br />
Kyriel remembered one of Jake's memories, where he and Tommy debated over the virtues <br />
between Deep Space Nine and Next Generation. Always losing to Tommy on the first <br />
person shooters. And Tommy's endless attempts to get Jake hooked up with a girlfriend <br />
before the pace of modern life had swiped away both of them away from each other. <br />
<br />
'I'll save him Jake, I promise.' Kyriel thought, 'And Angels, take their promises very <br />
seriously.' <br />
<br />
&quot;So tell me more of why you chose this land for your kingdom.&quot; Abu Isa asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Chose? Chose? There was nothing to chose.&quot; Tamthis laughed, &quot;This land was our kind's <br />
before humans dwelled within it. We're just taking it back from the colonists and giving it <br />
back to the natives. They are the invaders.&quot;<br />
<br />
'That... ' Kyriel thought, 'Is such a load of...' <br />
<br />
&quot;Why not try to cohabit with the humans who have lived here all their lives?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ha. As your own ascension and transcending of humanity has shown you, we are naturally <br />
superior, they should feel honored I am having them join us as our kind. As I know they <br />
are honored, and so are you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes of course, I simply wished to understand my Amir better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyriel noted how Abu Isa stood near a nice table with a feast prepared that the shiek could <br />
duck under once the havoc started.</p>
