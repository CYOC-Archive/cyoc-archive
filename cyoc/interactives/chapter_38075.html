<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>After the first sighting of the disturbing hell hound, Rusty knew that this was not like any of the other cases he had been on with Marcia, especially since he had never passed out from one before. When Rusty awoke, things seemed to be different somehow, but he couldn't put his finger on anything specific. Rusty quickly disrobed and ran into the faux hallway where the closet doors were full body mirrors, allowing a better view of himself to examine his now naked body. Looking at himself, Rusty was shocked by his reflection.</Br>
<Br>Instead of his normal, lightly bronzed skin, Rusty was so pale that he was completely devoid of skin pigment. Instead of his boyish and clean complexion, Rusty's eyes were sunken in their sockets with dark and decrepit rings accompanying them. Checking his reflection even closer, Rusty found that there was a rather large and reddish infected laceration that showed the complete intricate inner workings of his throat. The mirror showed him as one of the living-dead, a zombie that was doomed to roam the Earth and feed off of living flesh. Rusty, however, knew that this was not the case, because looking himself over without the mirror he could see with his own eyes that thins were as they should be and always have been.</Br>
<Br>When Rusty opened the door to get his camera for photo documentation of the apparition, his reflection showed that he was normal. Rusty was slightly dismayed since he missed his opportunity, but happier to see that all things were how they were supposed to be. Everything about Rusty was average, not having the best build in the world, even though he had been hitting the gym pretty hard to "buff" up. Shrugging his shoulders, Rusty squatted down where he was to get his notebook out of his bag to at least document his personal experience, even though he had nothing to back it up. In doing so, Rusty felt slightly off balance and when he stood up to recapture what was lost, Rusty grew increasingly dizzy and light-headed. Rusty quickly moved toward the edge of the bed, hoping that becoming stationary would make things better, but when he sat down Rusty's stomach began to churn, forcing him to dive for an empty waste basket at the foot of the near-by nightstand. Reaching it, barely in enough time, Rusty emptied all of the contents of his stomach into the waste-basket. After a few minutes, his violent and disgusting stomach functions ceased, leaving Rusty to collapse on his bed. Sprawled out on the bed, on top of all the sheets and what-not, Rusty laid there while staring face-up at the ceiling, wondering what was going on to cause all of this. Rusty thought to himself <I>Surely the encounter with the hell hound couldn't have made me this sick, could it have?</I> Not really knowing one way or the other, all he could do was lay there and wait for it all to pass.</Br>
<Br>As Rusty laid there, completely naked like the day he was born, things in the room took a very drastic change. Rusty clamored as he hustled to get under the thick and heavy sheets of the bed, seeking an abundance of warmth. For whatever reason, all of the warmth in the room was gone and only frigid air was left in its wake. Rusty was shocked that all of this happened after the hell hound paid him a visit. Rusty laid there still, waiting for the extreme cold to pass, being extremely uncomfortable under the covers from the heat of his internal body temperature rising at an incredible and almost exponential rate, be he would rather fry his organs as he could still see each and every hot, steamy breath. Frustrated by being trapped in a room he entered several minutes ago, Rusty just laid there, but fortunately enough Rusty noticed the temperature balanced itself out as quickly as it had been thrown into chaos. Thankfully all of that happened rather quickly, Rusty threw the covers off his body in an attempt to rapidly decrease his body heat. Laying there, uncovered and naked, Rusty panted heavily like a dog that was attempting to cool itself without drinking water. Still frustrated that things were still so messed up, Rusty jumped off the bed and ran into the bathroom to take an ice cold shower.</Br>
<Br>Allowing the freezing water to cascade down and off his body, Rusty felt himself cool down little by little. As Rusty stood therewith the water running over him, he watched some of the water turn instantly into vapor, filling the room with an exceptional amount of steam. Finally feeling as though he was at a normal temperature, Rusty turned the water off and stepped into the open bathroom, standing on a white towel he laid down earlier prior to stepping into the shower and looked at the large and moisture covered mirror. Curious as to how he looked, Rusty wiped some of the moisture away and chuckled at how he looked. Rusty grabbed a larger white towel while proceeding to dry himself off while walking back toward the bed and the clothes he left laying at the foot of the bed, limp and completely devoid of any life or form. Having dealt with several issues already, Rusty sat there contemplating whether or not he should explore outside of his room alone; if he should just wait for Marcia tomorrow to find the portal; or if he should just go to bed and head back home.</Br></p>
