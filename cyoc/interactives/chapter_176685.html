<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Slowly and groggily Emily began to stir in her bed, hesitantly she opened her eyes and was greeted by the same massive orbs obscuring her vision.<br />
<br />
She felt helpless and frustrated, she didn’t want these fake boobs she wanted to go back to her original size, she was comfortable there.<br />
<br />
One thing she noticed was that they were significantly less sore now then the last time she was awake.<br />
<br />
She poked them gently in an attempt to gage how sore they were under the bandages only to find that they didn’t hurt much right now.<br />
<br />
She took a couple minutes of gentle examination before she got bored and began looking around the room.<br />
<br />
It was still the same room as last time; she did notice a waterbottle on the table next to her. feeling pretty parched she sat up and reached for the bottle, she grabbed it and noted in her head that she could feel the cold metal of the bar from the bed she was laying in on her massive boobs.<br />
<br />
Sighing she re positioned herself and took a few gulps of the water.<br />
<br />
Hearing a soft clicking down the hall moving closer Emily kept drinking as the door carefully opened and the nurse quietly walked in.<br />
<br />
The nurse looked at Emily and said “Oh morning Mrs. Saunders, how are you feeling?”<br />
<br />
Emily lowered the now empty water bottle before fixing a glare at the nurse “H-How am I feeling? I am feeling like I have been kidnapped, drugged and had an involuntary surgery performed on me just to wake up in a strange room with these attached to me! How do you think I feel.” Gently grabbing her bandaged breasts for emphasis.<br />
<br />
“O-Oh well that is certainly a weirdly specific and… interesting answer. But I suppose I have heard “like I have been hit by a truck.” Enough for it to get old.” She awkwardly smiled as she walked over and began checking her vitals in silence.<br />
<br />
“Well everything is looking good, I am going to go grab the doctor and lets see if we can get these bandages off and check the damage.” She said trying to play off the words Emily said to ease the tension in the air.<br />
<br />
As the nurse left and the door shut Emily angrily threw the now empty water bottle at the door.<br />
<br />
She couldn’t get up because of the I.V. in her arm and her legs still felt like jello from all the painkillers she had flowing through her body right now.<br />
<br />
That was when she noticed the clipboard was laying on the table right next to her. the nurse apparently left it after checking on her.<br />
<br />
She was curious what they had done to her so she reached over and grabbed it.<br />
<br />
Looking at the first page she saw they got her name completely wrong.<br />
<br />
‘Vivian Saunders? Who is that?’ Emily thought to herself as she looked over the information<br />
<br />
Looking lower she saw the birth year was 1986 ‘she is 34? How did they mess that up? On a good day I look 15!’<br />
<br />
Finally her eyes noticed the notes section stating that this was a beta test on a new material that might revolutionize plastic surgery worldwide and to keep a close eye on the subject for any adverse reactions.<br />
<br />
Something wasn’t adding up to Emily, she could maybe get them switching the clipboards by mistake if this was the hospital and for some reason the head trauma patent got sent to a plastic surgeon but two things weren’t adding up<br />
<br />
First, she didn’t think she got head-butted hard enough to get sent to the hospital. And second, they wouldn’t mix up patents so bad that someone that was knocked out by a head butt would somehow get to a closed trial of a new product by someone twice her age, it just wasn’t adding up.<br />
<br />
She didn’t have much time to think about this though as the door opened and the doctor from before walked in. he was a short portly man with little hair on his head and a large waxed mustache and thick glasses resting on a small round nose.<br />
<br />
“Ah the star of the day has finally graced us with her beauty. I don’t know who has been more excited to see what’s under the wrapping, you or me!” he said walking closer to the bed as he talked.<br />
<br />
Emily froze in shock, this guy saw me naked?! This guy is a creep!<br />
<br />
Defensively she wrapped her arms across her chest. “No” she whispered quietly<br />
<br />
“Excuse me, I didn’t hear what you said?” he said stopping in his tracks <br />
<br />
“I said no, I refuse you creep. Get away from me, you have already messed up once I will not let you touch me again with your…gross sweaty hands.” Emily said while glaring at the doctor.<br />
<br />
“Messed up? I have done no such thing!” He harrumphed<br />
<br />
“Really?! You put these on a minor who came here with a minor head injury. I count that as a mistake!” Emily yelled back discretely emphasizing her boobs without showing him anything.<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about Mrs. Saunder’s. we have been planning this for months, and although you may be younger then myself you are by no means a minor; lets be honest about that.” He said back.<br />
<br />
“THAT’S NOT MY NAME!! I am not a Mrs. Saunders; I am Emily Daniels. I came here with a head injury and you messed up and put these on my chest you monster.” She was fuming right now and her heart rate monitor was going crazy.<br />
<br />
He leaned over to the nurse that was staring wide-eyed at the entire situation and whispered something to her.<br />
<br />
The nurse left the room and the doctor sighed before he said, “this was supposed to be my masterpiece, but the moment is ruined. “He said before he walked over silently and grabbed the clipboard from the table and began making some notes.<br />
<br />
“W-What are you doing?” Emily said still cautious but wanting to know so she could plan ahead.<br />
<br />
“I am waiting for the nurse to come back with proof so we can end this and continue with our days.” He said sounding annoyed.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long before the sound of the nurse returning could be heard.<br />
<br />
The door opened and a winded nurse walked in with a card and handed it to the doctor.<br />
<br />
“Ha, exactly what I thought.” He said smugly.<br />
<br />
“Well Mrs. Daniels can you explain this?” he passed the card to Emily who carefully grabbed it and looked at it.<br />
<br />
it was her. her picture on a drivers license it could be fake but it just looked so real. He eyes were loosing focus and she began to feel a cold sweat all over her body.<br />
<br />
She continued to stare at the drivers license and everything was matching… not her information it was the information on the clipboard; her birth-date, her name. it was her but with different information.<br />
<br />
Emily dropped the id and began hyperventilating. Everything began to blur and she looked over as the doctor barked orders that Emily couldn’t understand and the nurse sticking a needle into the I.V.<br />
<br />
And again Emily’s vision returned to black as she passed out.</p>
