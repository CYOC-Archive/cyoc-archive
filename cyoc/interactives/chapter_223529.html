<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When she awoke, Michelle quickly scrambled to the lake again, using its murky surface to investigate her changes.<br />
Looking at her improvised mirror, she didn&#39;t feel anything different quite yet. She noted that, at least, her face hadn&#39;t changed, ...much.<br />
She traced a hand over it, noting how her cheekbones were more set, and her hair... short. She looked more masculine now than before.<br />
What was more distressing to her, however, was that she was now missing something major. That &quot;something major&quot; being her breasts.<br />
Looking down at her now-flat torso, she let out a frustrated sigh. She continued downwards, taking a look at her crotch. Half-expecting an unwieldy cock to hang from it, she was surprised she still had her mouth-gina.<br />
And it was indeed a full mouth, now. Whereas before it was just a very flexible vaginal opening, still a vertical slit, now, it had changed to a horizontal mouth, one with fully defined and kissable lips.<br />
She tried to control them, and quickly made a wide range of motions. She curled back her lips, and revealed a hidden clit under her upper lips.<br />
She moved these lower lips to make smirks, grins, suave expressions, and even &quot;kissing&quot; motions and sounds.<br />
She looked on from above, bemused but aroused, as her &quot;lower mouth&quot; continued making all kinds of &quot;faces&quot;.<br />
She remembered the show of &quot;licking her lips&quot; that she did with her previous vagina, and after a bit of churning, a long reddish tongue emerged from her new mouth, licking her &quot;lips&quot; clean, and ending it with a smirk. She sighed in appreciation.<br />
&quot;Fuck that feels so good... wait, can I...?&quot;<br />
No, she couldn&#39;t talk with it.<br />
She left out a sigh of both relief and... disappointment? Maybe she&#39;s getting way too much into her own changes.<br />
She began fingering it, but she felt a distinct lack of... stimulation.<br />
Michelle frowned at this, her new lips sucking on her fingers by itself. Confused, Michelle recalled how good her finger usually felt, even before all of her transformations.<br />
She gasped loudly, as suddenly a spike of pleasure shot through her spine, emerging from her vagina. She pulled her hand out, and felt another lightning bolt of pleasure run through her, making her shudder with arousal.<br />
Now, when she &quot;licked her lips&quot; again (if only to remove the fluids that had built up), she couldn&#39;t help but moan loudly, as her entire crotch seemed to be hypersensitive to stimulation all of the sudden.<br />
She took a moment to center herself, a new theory forming into her mind. Then, she intentionally recalled how pleasure-less her own vagina was before she seemingly changed it.<br />
Michelle let her tongue emerge from the mouth-gina, and lick the hidden clit under her upper lip. No pleasure, nothing at all.<br />
She recalled her previous pleasure, and inhaled sharply as suddenly the same clit began overstimulating her with that pleasure.<br />
Thinking further, and taking a hunch, Michelle tried to imagine how good her arm would feel, if she&#39;d lick over it. A quick experiment later, and she assessed she&#39;s now totally in control of how much pleasure any of her body-arts could receive.<br />
She experimented with rubbing her fingers, then her thighs, and then her ears, her neck, and moaned at all of them. It was if someone had been rubbing her that clit all this time, but in different areas of her body.<br />
Michelle kept on pleasuring herself softly, while then thinking about what else she could control now.<br />
She went and tried a large large mental list of pleasure and sex-related bodily functions, but when she landed on her own wetness, she found she could open and close it like a faucet.<br />
With that, came squirting; she only would have to think about it, and her vagina would eject any liquid it had inside it outwards.<br />
Taking the time to &quot;clean&quot; her crotch after every such an &quot;accidental&quot; squirt, she giggled, and focused on the next big thing; Orgasms.<br />
Centring herself, Michelle took a deep breath, thought about it, and abruptly came.<br />
Thinking about an orgasm, pushing herself towards it, made her cum instantly.<br />
After the afterglow subsided, she decided to take a different approach, and focused on her pussy again, making the hidden clit fairly sensitive. Then she focused on <I>not</I> orgasming, to keep it all in.<br />
Michelle then got herself to edge, again and again, something preventing herself from cumming, while she got to hear her own new voice, groaning and moaning loudly, begging and heaving. It was a pleasant one, a bit deeper than her old voice, but not too deep, and seemingly as androgynous as her new body was, now.<br />
Michelle took the tongue away from her vagina, but realised in horror that her body continued to edge by itself, her mind locked in a feedback loop of entering and exiting the edge, and no matter how much she tried to finger, fist, or lick herself, she couldn&#39;t come out of it.<br />
She passed out.<br />
When she became conscious again, she felt her body pick up the pace again, but in her precious moment of lucidity, she willed it to stop, killing her libido instantly.<br />
It seems that she&#39;d have to take care of this particular power, as it could quite literally fuck herself up.<br />
Feeling her bottom parts tense and needy, and realising she might&#39;ve just edged them for many hours, Michelle brought herself to the brink again, slowly, with various help. She focused on the feeling, and felt her metaphorical finger sit on the button for cumming, letting her sit there for as long as possible. But no, she wanted to cum this time, and so she let out a long, soft moan, at the eventual release she allowed herself.<br />
In this long afterglow, Michelle took another look at her body, caressing her back and crotch, thumbing over her &quot;vagina bones&quot;. She couldn&#39;t find any of her previous additions, such as the gills.<br />
The insect eyes remained, but only seemed to be reserved for her &quot;insides&quot;. This was suddenly confusing, as it was like as if she was looking at her insides again for the first time. But this time, she was pretty sure she was seeing three different things, while she only had a single hole.<br />
She focused closer, and she swore she could feel the twitches of three independent pairs of muscles inside of her, which prompted her to investigate closer.<br />
She plunged a finger inside of her, but this time, she only tried to keep track of &quot;where&quot; it is in her inside vision. She quickly determined this finger now only seemed to exist in one &quot;chamber&quot;, the one that leaked in light from outside, while the others were still plunged in darkness. Her tongue also seemed to emerge from this same &quot;chamber&quot;, so she retracted it, and focused on her insides.<br />
Within a moment, some churning began, and she felt a reflex close up her pussy mouth, feeling strong muscles swap something just behind it.<br />
As she opened her &quot;mouth&quot; again, Michelle used her newfound flexibility to bend forward, peering deeper into it, and what she saw was... very surprising.<br />
She saw folds quiver and wave inside of her, and a quick internal twitch she confirmed she was completely in control of them. She couldn&#39;t feel any &quot;tongue&quot; here, but with the amount of folds she saw coil and roil in and out of her sight, she determined she didn&#39;t need one here. She kept staring at her own insides dance for a while, adding to her arousal.<br />
She plunged a finger, then two, then three. Feeling as if a thousand small &quot;tongues&quot; licked and twisted each finger individually. She moaned, not because of her vaginal stimulation, but of the fingers&#39;. She quickly felt the mindless churn of folds begin to optimise a pleasant massage of her fingers, unconsciously.<br />
This was a wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing, she realised. She could feel the amount of power that hid behind these muscles, waiting, ready to strike and squeeze, but used for fine-tuning instead. She felt hidden instincts and muscle memory she hadn&#39;t had before, whispering how to pull deeper and deeper, how to make doing that feel like sweetest velvet, but hiding how deep the item has gotten inside of her.<br />
She shuddered, and actually panicked slightly as she pulled her fist from her vagina, unconsciously having been adding fingers, pushing it deeper and deeper. This certainly was a dangerous force to at her disposal.<br />
She was tempted to test it more, but she had one last chamber to &quot;visit&quot;.<br />
Michelle &quot;swapped&quot; to it, and peered inside, ready to see what her body had in store. She clearly wasn&#39;t, as she still got surprised.<br />
She saw a tunnel of strong muscle, but little else. She saw them quiver, and then perform a strong rippling motion, &quot;sucking in&quot; air deeper, almost on instinct.<br />
When she plunged a finger in, the tunnel quickly clamped down and started sucking. She felt the blood accumulate on the tip, as the overeager strong muscles sucked and sucked on them. She had to almost battle against the vacuum buildup, to pull it out again.<br />
Her &quot;stomach&quot; churned again, her womb.<br />
Feeling for it again, she felt it connected to all three &quot;chambers&quot;, with separate entrances that she could now see sitting on the back of each of them. She felt it a bit hungry, but less ravaging than before, did something change?<br />
Michelle sat down, thinking about her predicament.<br />
What was she now optimised for? What was the food source she&#39;s now exploiting? What were all of these additions for?<br />
Then the realisation hit her with a ton of bricks;<br />
Extraction.<br />
Various means of extraction.<br />
Her bottom had been turned into a mouth, to extract what?<br />
What material would be so valuable that her whole body, even her demeanour and appearance, should be changed for it?<br />
Cum.<br />
Human cum.<br />
Because cum - she realised - contains a lot of genetic material...<br />
As this went through her mind, she felt her womb churn in approval, and then, seemingly by itself, her &quot;inner tongue&quot; emerged and &quot;wet&quot; her &quot;lower lips&quot; in anticipation... and she could only guess as to what...</p>
