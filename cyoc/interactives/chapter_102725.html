<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sammy had a great deal of fun at the Sea World: Orlando and enjoyed much of the shows that went on. The aquatic baby furs, many of them based off of Bottlenose Dolphins or Killer Whales (Orcas), and even one that was based off of some kind a shark, though Sammy didn&#39;t know what kind, were all amazing as they performed with the mundane whales and dolphins and animals in the show. And as Sammy and Jessy were given their tour by Barry, they had also noticed tanks that looked to be ten times the size of the show tanks in terms of the land area they covered and were nine times as deep as the show tanks. The water was clear and the bottom had a deep layer of sand and artificial coral and sea grasses, as if they were trying to mimic natural environments. Barry explained that that area was what they had set aside for the park&#39;s animals to live in and that their powers altered it, just as easily as it altered everything else. Sammy thought it was certainly a major step up from some of the stuff he remembered seeing on the news before the people of the world started turning into Baby Furs.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was fun,&quot; Sammy said to Jessy when they made their way out of the park after giving a bit of a shake to get the last bits of water out of their fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jessy agreed, &quot;they jumped so high. It was cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;d be nice if they could talk to animals, don&#39;t you think?&quot; Sammy asked, &quot;and if they could talk to animals, that&#39;d mean we could talk to animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be cool,&quot; Jessy agreed, and then noted that the sun was getting ready to go down. They&#39;d had lots of fun, but they were getting close to the end of the day, &quot;but not to be, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what&#39;s the plan?&quot; Jessy then asked, &quot;It&#39;s nearly getting to dinner time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy nodded, as they did have a way to go to get to My-yam-me to find the first fur, and it was getting late enough now that it wasn&#39;t likely that they&#39;d make it there before dark. At the same time, there was some curiosity about the supposed shuttle lunch from what had been Cape Canaveral, but thanks to the at times cute pronunciations of many words that baby furs had, the word that came to Sammy&#39;s mind was Cape Carnival. Curiosity did get the better of him, and he turned back to look towards the rest of the city beyond Sea World.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw a sandwich place a ways back,&quot; Sammy commented, &quot;Why don&#39;t we go there and then get a bus to Cape Carnival. We can see the space shuttle launch tomorrow and continue on our way to My-yam-me from there. You&#39;ll still come with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Jessy answered, &quot;you&#39;re my bestest friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy smiled and together they walked along holding hands. They ultimately made it to a small sandwich shop, with a sign that looked like it was written in crayon that read &quot;Jimmy and John.&quot; Both of them enjoyed bologna and cheese sandwiches on white, with the crusts cut off and soda in plastic sippy-cups. They enjoyed it, and both spent the majority of the meal looking to each other, as if the sort of &quot;romantic&quot; feelings that had been between Sam and Jess hadn&#39;t gone, but had merely changed in nature to suit their status as furry toddlers. A part of Sammy&#39;s mind even imagined them together in the future, holding a little figure made of play-dough as it evolved into a doll sized baby fur that looked like a cross between a fox and raccoon... and that doll sized baby fur ultimately growing up to be a baby fur the same size as any other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for coming with me, Jessy,&quot; Sammy said to her when they finished and returned their trays to the stork baby fur that was manning the cash register. Jessy nodded and held Sammy to her.<br />
<br />
They made their way out and ultimately found another bus that was headed to Cape Carnival. It was another fun ride for the both of them, as the sun went down during the trip. For a little while, Sammy and Jessy were content to kick their legs, though not hitting the seat in front of them to pass time, but as they got halfway to Cape Carnival, Sammy heard Jessy yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sleepy?&quot; Sammy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jessy said softly, &quot;but I had lots of fun, especially since it was with my bestest friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had lots of fun too,&quot; Sammy said as he hugged Jessy and let her rest her head against his shoulders, &quot;we got a big mission and a big adventure, but we had fun too and met so many baby furs too. Makes everything worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessy slowly nodded, but yawned again, which only made Sammy yawn in response. Jessy dosed off, leaving Sammy to make sure she didn&#39;t fall out of her seat. As they rode along, the sun went down and many of the other lights came on, from the inside of the bus, though they looked sorta like nightlights to Sammy. He only shrugged and held Jessy to him, softly petting her back and in a sense combing her fur with is short stubby claws and waited for them to reach Cape Carnival. They arrived fairly late and the bus driver drove them right up to a big hotel.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re here,&quot; Sammy said to Jessy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Jessy said softly as her eyes fluttered open, &quot;Are we in My-yam-me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Cape Carnival, and at the hotel,&quot; Sammy spoke, &quot;Let&#39;s go in. We had a big day today and a big day tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessy nodded and the two of them made their way in. A friendly cat baby fur gave them the key to a room, which looked like a toy key with the room name written on the side of it. They made their way to it and quietly walked in. Things were dark in the room with a plastic TV on a dresser with a lone crib sitting in front of it. Too tired to do anything else, Jessy and Sammy climbed into the crib, raised one side until they heard it latch and went to sleep, cuddled closely to each other.</p>
