<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter laid bent over the desk as he was ordered, slowly rubbing his hard 8 inch, uncut cock against the side of the desk, in almost the same spot he had cum before.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about we get your bat back Sean?&quot; Mr. Adams asked.<br />
<br />
Sean watched his teacher as he first got a glove out of his supply cupboard, and after putting it on, came up to rub the lube on Peters anus a little, watching on as Peters anus opened a little further, the end of the bat coming back into view.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s very good Peter, much better than when you came into this class, much more obedient, I may even keep you as my demonstration assistant,&quot; Mr. Adams said as he wrapped his gloved hand around the hilt of the bat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sean, if you will, please remove your trousers and underwear, I think a comparison is in order,&quot; He said as he started to withdraw the bat, only to push it back in, making Peter moan and his cock twitch against the desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Sean complied, removing his trousers as quickly as he was able with what was in them, then taking his briefs off, he was glad for his choice of briefs that had an open crotch, they had made having his endowment much easier to cope with daily. As his briefs came down off his legs his cock wobbled, and spurted another dose of his precum onto his trousers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good, please, come stand behind Peter here, that&#39;s good. Now, I want you to bring your penis up to Peters anus, right next to my hand, then I want you to push it in right alongside the baseball bat,&quot; Mr. Adams instructed.<br />
<br />
Sean complied with his teacher, and placed his cock at the open hole before him, and slowly pushing in, his huge cock head stretching the opening further. He could feel Mr. Adams hand holding the bat as his cock passed it, and he felt the bat as his cock slid in along side it, all the way until he was right up against his teachers arm. Peter moaning loudly as his eyes rolled back and his cock jerked a load of precum against the desk.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great Sean, you too Peter, you&#39;re doing well. Ok, so Sean, does Peters anal cavity feel tight?&quot; Mr. Adams asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... yes sir, mmm,&quot; Sean moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;And when remove the bat?&quot; He asked as he pulled the baseball bat from Peters ass, both young men moaning and leaking as he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... mmm... sir, it feels pretty loose now sir,&quot; Sean replied through moans, his cock jerking inside his classmate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, just as it should feel, Peters anus will never reduce to less than the depth or thickness of your cock and the baseball bat being in it at the same time now, and if anything larger than those two things is ever inserted in it it will then stay at that minimum size from then on. Now, just remain still Sean...&quot; Mr. Adam said. <br />
<br />
Sean did as told by his teacher, as Mr. Adams retreated behind him with the baseball bat. He then felt the warm well lubricated metal at the entrance to his virgin hole, his hole squirting generous amounts of lubricant onto it in anticipation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Very good Sean, I&#39;m just going to press in gently, I want you to use that superior control to pull the baseball bat in as deep as you can.&quot; Mr. Adams instructed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unnnngh, yes... sir... mmm.&quot; Sean  moaned as he did so, the empty feeling in his stomach subsiding a little as the bat filled him.<br />
<br />
Mr. Adams watched the baseball bat be drawn into the young mans anus, he had let go of it and it was now defying gravity as it steadily disappeared. &quot;That&#39;s very good, and there, you now have your bat back Sean, though I did say we were doing a comparison didn&#39;t I?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm, YES, sir, you did... mmm,&quot; Sean moaned as his bat sank into him, he wasn&#39;t sure, but thought it might have been deeper than it was in Peter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, now I want you to step back and remove your penis from Peter,&quot; Mr. Adams directed, and waited as Sean did so. &quot;Ok, now remember how I said that your penis is similar to an Elephants? Yes, well I want you to bend it around to your own anus, goood, now press it in, and slide it up along side your bat!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean complied, surprised again, he never thought to do this either. But he moaned and grunted as his baseball bat sized cock slide into his ass along side his actual baseball bat. He could feel his cock squirting out a lot of lube, so much that it was running down his legs along with his anal lube, his ass sucking and pulling his cock in as his cock pushed in, until with a moan he came deep in his ass, his groin looking painfully twisted and flat, with his larger than average balls hanging down and to the side as his cock twisted into his ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent Sean! Now tell me, in comparison to Peter, does your own anal cavity feel tight?&quot; Mr. Adams asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;MMMM, YES sir!&quot; Sean screamed as he came.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; The teacher said, then moving his gloved hand, he shoved it into Sean&#39;s anus too, rather quickly along side, or rather between the baseball bat and the monster cock, making Sean moan and scream out as he came again, his stomach starting to bulge a little from the insertions and his cum. As Adams&#39; arm reached shoulder depth, he continued, &quot;I forgot to mention how super bottom men such as you Sean are able to cum rather large quantities, typically over a litre during a single orgasm, with balls as large as yours its not surprising at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean moaned as his softball sized balls pumped out a surge of cum into his depths.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Sean, tell me, does your anal cavity still feel tight?&quot; Mr. Adams asked the moaning boy.<br />
<br />
Sean could barely think, but he replied, &quot;Yessssir,&quot; in a long moan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good!&quot; Adams replied, before he quickly removed his entire arm from Sean&#39;s ass, the super bottom anus quickly closing around Sean&#39;s penis. &quot;And what about now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Having the extra intruder removed from him allowed Sean to clear his thoughts a little, &quot;Yes... Sir, pretty tight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good, and that is how you a super bottom compare to Peter, a talented bottom, now please, I don&#39;t want you to be late for your practice, please put your underwear and trousers back on and head to it, no need to remove your penis or baseball bat from your anus, I&#39;m sure your coach wont mind at all.&quot; Adams said. <br />
<br />
Sean put his clothes back on, as he replied, &quot;No sir... I don&#39;t want to be late.&quot; His trousers groin now filled with his huge balls, his underwear designed to contain them with an opening for his penis, when it isn&#39;t inside him. Sean thanked his teacher for returning his bat to him, as he grabbed his bag, and jogged off to baseball practice. Contented to have his baseball bat and his cock deep in his own ass, loving the feeling of them bouncing together in him as he ran down the hall.<br />
<br />
Sean was looking forward to his practice session, especially now that he had his bat back.</p>
