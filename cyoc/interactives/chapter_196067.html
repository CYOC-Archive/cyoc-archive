<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I...uhh,&quot; Nick faded into trying to think about this. He sure didn&#39;t think of himself as gay, or queer at any rate, but at the same time... there was not any lying about the bulge acting up at his groin, pushing down in his lap and along his leg, making a striking impression in his jeans. Nick gulped, finding himself feeling just plain turned on at the moment. He had been hoping to get laid with Natalie tonight, or Clara, or any of the hotties here now that he was a good looking guy at long last.<br />
<br />
Well, not exactly how he had planned it. But it had all worked out in the end, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on dude,&quot; Greg moved his hand up Nick&#39;s leg, and when that calloused, strong hand touched Nick&#39;s cock, even through the fabric of the boyband singer&#39;s jeans, the young man let out a short gasp. &quot;Trust me. All my girlfriends can vouch for my talents. And I&#39;ve been looking to try men on for size, and you&#39;re looking really fine tonight.&quot; Ah, so Greg was looking to expand his horizons it seemed.<br />
<br />
Nick figured with that in mind that he wouldn&#39;t be getting bound into any pattern of behavior by this. He could still fuck Natalie senseless tonight, and it might even make it hotter knowing he&#39;d fucked the runningback who seemed so keen on her too. Nick suddenly leaned in and kissed Greg on the lips, which the jock responded to with a slightly trepidatious return kiss, putting a hand around Nick&#39;s head and letting the two of them enjoy a moment before backing off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; Greg said with a smile, &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re good with trying me out. But we gotta get some privacy. A few of the other guys in the team aren&#39;t quite as open-minded as yours truly.&quot; Greg started leading the way toward the stairs - so far people were just hanging out downstairs, as the truly raucous part of the party hadn&#39;t quite started yet. So they should be able to find a room pretty easily.<br />
<br />
For his part, Nick followed along, not knowing about what kind of company would be arriving at the party tonight.<br />
<br />
The upstairs consisted of about three hallways, ending in the master bedroom that - presently - was locked, belonging to the folks of the guy throwing the party. He had quite wisely decided to keep that room locked up. There were four bedrooms upstairs, in this rather luxurious house by the river, and only one was presently occupied by an amorous couple - namely, by Gabe McIntyre and his girlfriend Stephanie. Nick remembered Gabe as a senior and a former nerd.<br />
<br />
Gabe was known as the school&#39;s bodybuilder, and though he maintained his old, nerdy interests, Nick had still found him kind of intimidating before. Due in part to the open secret of Gabe&#39;s steroid usage - and the corresponding temper issues Gabe suffered from. Some days he had a handle on the temper, others he seemed like a powder keg. His girlfriend, Stephanie, was one of the cheerleader girls who had gotten with Gabe interestingly enough before he turned all tall, built and dangerous.<br />
<br />
As they passed the room, Gabe heard Stephanie crying out Gabe&#39;s name, and the young man grunting out &quot;Ohh fuck babe you&#39;re tight! Fuck! Fuck! FUCKING YES!!&quot;<br />
<br />
It certainly did build the mood. <br />
<br />
By the time Greg and Nick got situated in the room directly next to the one Gabe and Steph were presently screwing away in, both had developed intense arousal and corresponding bulges at the front of their pants. Nick&#39;s significantly looking more pronounced due to how tight his jeans were. He let out a breath and commented, &quot;Quite a fucking soundtrack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg gulped, looking around before he closed in on Nick. The blond jock removed his top in short order, right before moving in to take Nick&#39;s top off. But due to how much Nick had developed, the shirt was too tight. So when Nick went and said &quot;Lemme help you there...&quot; And promptly removed it himself, he was met by a soft &quot;aah...&quot; as Greg took in the sight of Nick&#39;s muscular form.<br />
<br />
It was not quite like the muscled physiques of the other jocks on the team that had occasionally enticed Greg into some covert fantasies, definitely not like Gabe&#39;s body. But it was definitely a tightly muscled body that accentuated the pure beauty that was Nick&#39;s features. &quot;Oh fuck dude,&quot; Greg gasped and he could hold himself back no longer.<br />
<br />
Nick was distinctly unfamiliar with it when Greg started kissing him, not knowing how it went with two guys kissing. He had little knowledge about making out with a woman - despite his new history as a boyband singer - let alone making out with a man. Though he stood taller than Greg, and put an arm around his broad shoulders, keeping him in close, letting the jock thirstily enjoy the occasion. Nick ground his groin against Greg&#39;s, and the jock rewarded him with a moan right in the middle of their snogging.<br />
<br />
Nick had never known how Greg&#39;s body felt, seeing him running around on the field as he remembered.<br />
<br />
Greg was tight, impressively toned, and honestly, even though Nick was still not exactly queer - he could appreciate the work that went into these tight shoulders, the rear delts bulging under his fingers. &quot;Ahh fuck dude,&quot; Greg was blushing now as the kiss ceased, &quot;I gotta...I gotta...oh fuck, can you like, fuck me? I&#39;ve topped before, but I wanna find out...ohh fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Experimentally, Nick had gripped Greg&#39;s butt, wondering how that might feel. He in fact had interrupted Greg&#39;s mumbling about his sexual experiences by inducing a low, sexed up moan in the jock. The request was clear, and Nick figured as long as he was experimenting here, he should at least try to fulfill it.<br />
<br />
Before long, the pants and underwear thereafter joined the shirts on the floor.<br />
<br />
Greg, being rather more experienced with this sort of matter, positioned himself on the bed, ass in the air and hands clenching the sheets. &quot;Like, dude, fuck me up right now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Well, Nick wasn&#39;t going to deny him that. He slicked up his cock with his precum, noting he was really excited by now by all this that had happened, and started moving in. He figured this would be good anal practice. He didn&#39;t know much about how it&#39;d work doing anal on a woman, but he hoped this would at least help him some if Natalie was up for it. He started easing himself in, knowing at least enough to know he shouldn&#39;t try and push all the way in first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh...ahh fuck, this is different from with Ryan the twink...&quot; Greg moaned, &quot;Ahh fuck yes!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick started thrusting lightly into that ass, which Greg had tested earlier with a few hidden sex toys, and found himself appreciating the tightness. Ohh fuck, the tightness was real. Nick rubbed some sweat off his forehead as he eased his way into the jock&#39;s ass. Every step of the way he choked down an almost too intense shout of pleasure, grateful for Gabe absolutely railing Stephanie just a room over. That soundtrack was making this whole thing even hotter. The sounds of Stephanie moaning Gabe&#39;s name...he hoped Greg and Natalie would moan his name the way Steph was moaning Gabe&#39;s.<br />
<br />
The thrusts intensified, and Greg let out a sharp, &quot;Ahh! Fuck dude! Fuck! Feels so good!&quot; <br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Max and Ricky were presently in the middle of their transformation on their way to the party. Max at present was letting himself enjoy a somewhat longer transformation into a rippling athletic young man, while Ricky was already mostly done - eager to, it turns out, approximate the changes that had happened to Nick. Thus Ricky had grown into an 18 year old tightly muscled though thin and svelte pretty boy, his skin milky pale and his hair just about at shoulder length in the back, his physical features yet another vision of masculine beauty.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really had to ape what Nick got, eh?&quot; Max said before grunting as he felt himself hit 17 years old, another 5 to 10 lbs of muscle added to his body even as he finished that question.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I can appreciate good work when I see it.&quot; Ricky shrugged, and pondered adjusting his own current past and lifestyle. He could very well become bandmates with Nick. After all, those boyband fuckers all got so fucking much pussy and ass. The groupies were probably all wild...!<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Max said as he looked at the Chronivac, &quot;Looks like Nick&#39;s decided to test the waters in the other side of port so to speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Who&#39;s the lucky boy?&quot; Ricky asked, crossing his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greg Jacobsen.&quot; Max said with a shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greg Jacobsen!? Seriously? That dude&#39;s gay? Or Bi...? Or whatever he feels like calling it?&quot; Ricky asked, &quot;Wow. Huh. Didn&#39;t see that coming. Dude&#39;s so into masculine showboating...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Football Guy Stuff!&quot; Max said with a smile, looking down at the Chronivac again, &quot;Hmm...I&#39;m thinking. I&#39;m thinking. Kinda curious to see what happens with these two. I wanna grow one or the other or both a few years.&quot; Max got a rather mischievous look on his face. Changing people that way? In the midst of sex? It really tickled his sense of enjoyment of the Chronivac. Whole reason why using this kind of thing seemed so very enjoyable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dissenting idea,&quot; Ricky said raising one hand as if he was in school wanting to be called on, &quot;How about we amplify Nick and Greg&#39;s testosterone levels? See where they go from there...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s definitely in consideration.&quot; Max said with a smile, considering how to change Nick and now Greg.</p>
