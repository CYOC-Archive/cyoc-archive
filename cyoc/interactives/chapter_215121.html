<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul stripped off. He faced away from Maddie, so his daughter didn’t have to see him naked. It probably wasn’t necessary as by now Maddie had a penis identical to that which Sean was about to lose. Joan acted as the conduit. As soon as Sean took off his undies he gave them to the now fully male Maddie. Maddie pulled them up and removed Mark’s gown which Joan then passed to Sean. <br />
<br />
Sean turned around to see his twin, clad in his underpants, removing the magical socks. ‘Hi Daddy, look at me! I’m big and strong like you!’ It was strange to hear his own voice come out of the man he knew to be his own daughter.<br />
<br />
Maddie took off the socks which Joan then handed to Sean. ‘You know what to do. My shoes are there. She pointed at the stiletto heels now on the floor. Sean gulped. He wasn’t sure he could do this.<br />
<br />
Joan began to help Maddie get dressed in the clothes Sean had just taken off. Temporarily Sean was ignored. He sat on the bed and picked up and examined the socks.<br />
<br />
They looked like ordinary black socks. They were of the size of his normal socks which made sense as they had just come off Maddie’s feet. He tentatively felt them. They were stretchy but no more so than any other pair of socks. There was nothing extraordinary about them at all, but he had just seen them change Maddie into his twin. <br />
<br />
Sean looked once more at Joan’s stilettos and got cold feet. He couldn’t do this. ‘How do we know that the changes are reversible?’ he asked out loud. ‘Neither Mark or Fiona have changed back yet’<br />
<br />
Joan was helping Maddie button up Sean’s shirt. She turned to him. ‘You think of this now? After Maddie has changed?’<br />
<br />
‘Well it’s a valid thought’ Sean was just looking for a way to avoid becoming Joan’s twin. He knew it and Joan knew it.<br />
<br />
‘Fiona! Mark!’ Joan called out.<br />
<br />
The swapped couple were there in a flash. They entered the room and gazed at the occupants. ‘Wow! Two Seans! Who’s Maddie?’ said the apparent Mark.<br />
<br />
‘I am’ said the Sean with his clothes on.<br />
<br />
‘Sean is getting cold feet. He worried he won’t be able to change back if he becomes me’<br />
<br />
‘How do you know there isn’t some limit to the powers of the socks?’ asked the Sean in the dressing gown. ‘Maybe they can only change you once or there is some sort of time delay before you can change back’<br />
<br />
‘Valid point’ said the apparent Fiona. ‘Would you like me to demonstrate? I’ve only been in this body for a little over an hour. Would you like me to change again?’<br />
<br />
‘Well yes. Show us how you can change back’ said Sean<br />
<br />
‘I don’t want to change back. But I’ll happily change into someone else. Maddie do you mind if I became you?’<br />
<br />
‘Yes that would be fun!’ said the tall man. <br />
<br />
‘Well pass me the socks then said “Fiona”. She then sat on the bed, pulled the black socks onto her legs and dipped her feet into the white sandals Maddie had arrived in. Before long her feet had shrunk so that they fitted into the shoes. Over the next 10 to 15 minutes “Fiona” changed into “Maddie”. She was sitting on the bed in her now oversized blue dress. She looked like a little girl playing dress-ups in her mother’s clothes. Her hair was the last to change, from Fiona&#39;s brown to Maddie&#39;s blonde.<br />
<br />
Everyone had just stood there watching the transformation. ‘Satisfied now?’ the new little girl asked the Sean in the dressing gown as the last of her changes completed.<br />
<br />
‘I guess there isn’t a time limit’ conceded the true Sean.<br />
<br />
‘Well your turn in that case’ said Joan who once more handed Sean the black socks, which had shrunk to a size that fitted Maddie’s feet.<br />
<br />
With everyone watching him and out of excuses Sean stretched the socks over his large feet. Joan quickly placed her shoes over his toes and held them in place. She didn’t want him changing his mind again. Sean watched in horror as his feet shrunk to the point that Joan’s shoes fit. <br />
Joan then turned to the new Maddie. ‘Well you should get dressed before we have dinner “Maddie”. Perhaps you should change in the bathroom’ She handed the little girl the clothes, that Maddie had arrived in. The new Maddie took the dress and panties and went to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Sean watched as the changes progressed up his legs. His legs became dainty. It wasn&#39;t long before the changes were evident above the socks. His shins were hairless and shortened. He asked ‘What happens if I take the socks of midway through a change?’<br />
<br />
“Mark” who was still in the room observing the changes said ‘I don’t know. Neither of us have tried it yet. Do so and let’s see what happens’<br />
<br />
Sean heaved a sigh of relief. The changes had progressed to above his knees. He quickly took off the stilettos and whipped of the socks. They watched as the changes progressed further up his legs. There was a zone of change between Sean’s hairy thighs and his feminine knees. <br />
<br />
The zone was moving slowly upwards. It didn’t stop immediately. It probably progressed 2 inches before the changes came to a halt. Sean waited for the changes to reverse but they didn’t they just came to a halt. He was himself from mid-thigh up but Joan further down.<br />
<br />
“Maddie” returned now dressed in the pale pink dress with birds printed on it. She looked cute. No way would anyone think she was anything other than the 7 year old girl she now appeared to be. ‘What’s happening?’ she asked.<br />
<br />
‘We were just figuring out how the socks work. My changes stopped about a minute after I removed the socks’ the Sean in the dressing gown replied.<br />
<br />
‘Now we need to see what happens when you put the socks back on’ said Joan handing the socks back to her husband. She wasn’t going to let Sean get away with a partial change.</p>
