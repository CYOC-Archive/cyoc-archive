<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie sighed rubbing her eyes, she wasn’t looking forward to having Jack talk with Circe and Lilith. “Okay listen,” she said. “Dad, why don’t you and Baba look around the park while we go and talk with Lilith and Circe.”<br />
<br />
“Are you sure It’s wise for us to split up Kellie,” he asked, raising an eyebrow. Kellie now beckoned her father to the side away from the others to talk. “Look dad,” she whispered. “I think you and Baba should work together to figure out the hourglass. Besides, you might want to have some fun with Baba before she’s too young to date.”<br />
<br />
Merlin seemed to blush, flummoxed by his daughters statement as he tried to spit out a response. “It’s not like that,” he mumbled. “Sure dad if you say so,” Kellie said, rolling her eyes. <br />
<br />
As Kellie and her friends now began the journey to Circes castle she glanced back at Merlin and Baba. The ancient wizard seemed slightly thrown off as the 20 something BAba Yaga began to flirt with him. While Kellie found the situation slightly hilarious she needed to focus. She needed to make sure Lilith and Circe were okay. That and she wanted to be their to calm Jack down if Lilith told her son she spanked her.<br />
<br />
Entering the thrown room of Circe Kellie and the others were astounded by what they saw. It appeared the girls had done some redecorating since the last time Kellie was there. Magical drawings of unicorns, fairies, and other magical things now adorned the throne room. No longer intimidating, it looked like something out of a Disney princesses dream, which made sense if Lilith and Circe were both mentally 6 as well as physical. As she glanced towards the golden throne she was astounded to see the two 6 year old witches happily eating cotton candy.<br />
<br />
Both witches looked up from their treats, waving widely as they immediately recognized Jack. “Hi Jack,” Cece exclaimed, waving her tiny hand. “Look Lili your son is here.”<br />
<br />
Lili paused as she looked at Jack. Son? That was impossible, she was to little to be a mommy. “I’m too little to be a mommy Cece,” she giggled, “That’s my...big brother.”<br />
<br />
Jack gaped at the two witches, stunned that the hourglass apparently had transformed his mother into his kid sister. “Wow,” he whispered. “Remind me to hide that hourglass when we fix this.” As he stepped forward with Kellie he suddenly noticed a look of terror spread across Lili and Cece’s faces.<br />
<br />
“Cece that mean girl is here,” Lili exclaimed, her eyes wide as she gestured towards Kellie. “Oh no,” Cece whispered. “Is she gonna spank us for leaving your house.”<br />
<br />
“Spanking,” Jack asked, slightly confused.<br />
<br />
“That mean girl spanked me Jack,” Lili grumbled. “She made me cry and sent me to my room. She’s a big meanie face.”<br />
<br />
“You spanked my mother,” Jack hissed, turning to face a sheepish Kellie.<br />
<br />
“She’s was acting like a brat,” Kellie responded defensively. “And she left out the part where she threatened to kill my family and called me a whore.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not an excuse,” Jack exclaimed, throwing his hands up in the air wildly. The two teens now began to bicker back and forth, argueing about everything. The two sounded like a long married couple, t adding barbs back and forth about their history, their philosophies, and their brand of parenting. As their friends listened they could only groan in annoyance. “OH MY GOD  will you to just make out already,” Samantha exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Kellie and Jack paused, stunned by Samantha’s statement as they turned. “What,” Kellie asked, dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
“Look,” Samantha sighed. “Obviously you two don’t see it but your hot for one another.”<br />
<br />
Kellie and Jack stared and one another, disgusted at the idea after fighting like they had.<br />
<br />
“She’s a bitch though,” Jack huffed.<br />
<br />
“And he’s an asshole,” Kellie added. “Besides, Hello! Gay!”<br />
<br />
Katie was the one who now approached Kellie a warm smile on her face as she took her friends hand. “Kel listen,” she said quietly. “Look, you might like girls more but you and jack need to realize something. You both really like eachother.”<br />
<br />
“I do not,” Kellie huffed.<br />
<br />
“Seriously,” Katie said raising an eyebrow. “If this was grade school he’d be pulling your pigtails and you would of shoved him in a mud puddle. I think you need to realize something, your probably bisexual.”<br />
<br />
“But I don’t like guys,” Kellie said in exasperation. “I don’t like any guys, I like girls.”<br />
<br />
Kellie tried to emphasize this by placing her cheek gently on Katie’s cheek. Katie took her friends hand squeezing it tightly as she gazed into her hazel eyes. “You like one guy,” she said warmly. “And it’s him. I mean think about it, you two had a version of me in another timeline and watching the way you two fight, you still have ALOT of passion for one another.”<br />
<br />
Kellies jaw hung open as she tried to mount a response, coming up with nothing she simply stomped her foot groaning in disappointment. “Why him then,” she groaned.<br />
<br />
“Love is weird,” Katie shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Wait hold up,” Jack said, still confused. “Are you telling me Kellie has the hots for me?”<br />
<br />
Kellie could only shrug, being a teenager with wild teenage emotions she couldn’t really answer. “Oh that’s rich,” Jack laughed. “I freaking knew it.”<br />
<br />
“Hey don’t get to cocky their bud,” Sebastian stated. “I know your head of heels for her too.”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about,” Jack said defensively, his cheeks burning. Sebastian could only shake his head as he approached his best friend. “Cmon man seriously,” he said. “Everyday when were making plans it’s I wonder what Kellie is doing or Do you think Kellie thought about that too? Face it, she’s not your rival, she’s your crush.”<br />
<br />
As the two teenage wizards gawked at one another they began to wonder about their relationship. Did they really like eachother? Kellie looked at Jack, true he was handsome but he was evil, the darkness to her light. Still? There was something about him. As the two began quietly moving towards one another, Kellie let loose with a punch to the gut.<br />
<br />
“The hell,” Jack wheezed.<br />
<br />
“Look were not touching this today Okay,” she sighed. “Let’s find out how Cece and Lili are before we talk about this.”<br />
<br />
“Fine by me,” Jack huffed. “Just stop hitting me and my family.”<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded as they now turned back towards the two witch children. If Kellie thought she needed a drink yesterday, she realized she was going to need double today.</p>
