<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I did away with the &quot;Jeff&quot; and &quot;New Jeff&quot; distinction.  Hopefully it&#39;s obvious enough at this point.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff continued looking through the Chronivac’s program.  He was amazed by how many different choices there were, but navigating the interface was really unintuitive, and there were options that he didn&#39;t understand by their name alone.  However, looking through the sliders on the window that came up after scanning himself, one caught his eye.<br />
<br />
It just had two labels--&quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;--each on opposite ends of the bar.  Currently, it sat most of the way over on the male side, which he though was odd.  Jeff supposed he wasn’t exactly the most manly man possible,  but it was weird to see that listed there so plainly.  He though about sliding it the rest of the way over to the male side, but for some reason, the female label at the other end got his curiosity going.<br />
<br />
He could have a female body to play with and do whatever he wanted to, and he would get to experience everything he was doing to it.  It surprised Jeff how much the thought excited him, as it was never something he had really fantasized about. However, with the option suddenly thrust plainly in front of him, he couldn’t deny that it would at least be interesting to try, and if it felt too weird, he could always undo it.  Also, weren’t girls supposed to be able to cum over and over without stopping?<br />
<br />
Jeff checked the clock.  It was only 1:30. His parents wouldn’t be home for several hours, so he had plenty of time during which no one should bother him.  Convinced it was a good idea, he slid the pointer all the way left to female.  As it moved, other options were affected, sliding bars left or right.  There were so many options, and Jeff was a bit impatient to look through all of them, but he did notice a couple that he felt like tweaking.  He went ahead and moved the hair length bar further to the right and several body hair options to 0.  He saw that his chest size was set about half way, and while he didn’t want to look like a complete bimbo, he still nudged it a couple notches further.  Satisfied and eager to go ahead and change, he hit the save button.<br />
<br />
The emitter connected to his computer immediately whirred to life again, and Jeff felt his body start to change.  His scalp itched, and he felt the strange sensation of his hair tickling his neck and ears as it lengthened rapidly.  Jeff began to feel something like goosebumps coming in waves all over his body as his hair follicles shrank and disappeared.  He held a hand up, watching it become smaller, smoother, and daintier.<br />
<br />
Jeff shifted in his seat uncomfortably as his hips widened and his butt expanded.  He felt little alterations happening all over his body at once as muscles shrank and bones shifted, and it was hard to keep track of the strange feelings.  He touched his face, feeling as his nose and jaw became smaller, and his lips felt fuller.  He felt a weight developing on his chest, and looked down at his breasts that were developing.  Jeff grabbed a handful of each, gently squeezing and inspecting them as they plumped in his grasp.  His nipples became more sensitive and he focused on them more, playing with them idly as he enjoyed his burgeoning from.<br />
<br />
The changes slowed down, and Jeff was getting more aroused as he played with himself.  He moved to the bed so that he could more fully enjoy his body.  He ran his hands across his dainty collarbones, down his breasts, and all over his torso.  He grabbed a round butt cheek and caressed the contour of his shapely hips.  His hands traced along his smooth thighs, and to his… cock?  <br />
<br />
Jeff sat up.  He’d obviously noticed it was still there when he was first inspecting the transformations, but judging by its size and how erect he was, it was like it hadn’t even begun to change.  The feelings in the rest of his body had pretty much subsided, but for some reason, this part had just been skipped and now looked very out of place between his extremely feminine legs.<br />
<br />
Confused, he looked back to the computer to see what was wrong.  All of the sliders seemed right, though as he searched through them, he couldn’t find any that referred to his genitalia at all.  Was that just not included by default?  His dick had begun throbbing and twitching again.<br />
<br />
Jeff shrugged and figured that he might as well enjoy this new body for now and then play with Chronivac more once he was bored.  A second timer had begun counting down from an hour, but this one said “SAVE CHANGES?”.  Jeff clicked “yes”, which made the box go away.  The old timer that he couldn’t get rid of was still there, reading “00:000:00:42:31:998” and still counting down.  Jeff paid it no mind, moving to the full body mirror on his closet door.<br />
<br />
The woman that stared back at him was stunning.  Jeff could see hints of himself in her, but the difference was enough that he didn’t care.  She was almost impossibly curvy, with an hourglass waist, wide hips, and a full bust.  Her hair was unkempt, but her face was cute.  If not for the male genitals, Jeff would almost call her perfect.<br />
<br />
Jeff moved about experimentally, making faces and trying to pose seductively.  It was harder than he expected, and it just came out as awkward and embarrassing at first, but Jeff managed to detach himself from the figure he was posing in the mirror and get past his self-consciousness.  He tried talking to himself seductively, and while hearing his higher, sultry voice was exciting, he was worried someone might overhear him, so he stuck to just putting on a show in the mirror.  Slowly, he manged to move the body in the way he wanted to see, and pretty soon, strange as the situation was, he was turning himself on.<br />
<br />
He started playing with his breasts again, this time making more of a spectacle of it in the mirror, and the feeling was even better than before now that the transformation was finished and he was already aroused.  Before too long, he couldn’t help but touch himself.  His member seemed to almost jump in response, the touch of his feminine fingers feeling even better than expected.  He wasn’t sure if it was a side effect of the Chronivac, but his penis felt really sensitive, and he once again couldn’t help twitching it as he gave it attention.  He started slow, gently teasing it as he played with his female features.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jeff slowly began to regain consciousness.  His head was foggy and he couldn’t keep hold of his thoughts, but he felt something like a flush building all over his body.  The more awake he became, the stronger the flushed feeling grew, and he began to feel bloated and swollen.  Memories flashed through his mind of the Chronivac.  He had changed himself… into his own penis?  Was that right?  How could it be?  Thinking was so hard, and for some reason he felt really aroused again.<br />
<br />
Touch.  The feeling of smooth skin against his whole body obliterated any line of thought that he had managed to grasp hold of.  The swelling intensified, and a throbbing coursed throughout his body.  He wanted to touch more.  He wanted that soft skin all over him.  “Touch me.  TOUCH ME!!!” his mind screamed.  Nothing else mattered.<br />
<br />
Just as abruptly, it was taken away.  He felt himself sway in the open air, devoid of stimulation. Once again, all he could do was twitch his form, yearning for some kind of contact.  He couldn’t focus on anything other than the deep need inside him.  It went on agonizingly long, until, blessedly, he felt warm soft skin on his head.<br />
This touch was different.  He wasn’t just resting against skin.  This was purposeful.  Knowing.  He was more aware of what was going on this time, recognizing that it was a seemingly giant hand that touched him.  Fingers skillfully tickled at the edge of his neck, knew just where to tease to make him jump in pleasure.  His arousal built, and the touch changed to a caress.  The hand enveloped his whole form, moving up and down in gentle strokes.<br />
<br />
His need built faster and faster with each pass.  He felt a familiar pressure building up deep within him.  It hadn’t been long, but he was already getting closer to the edge.  The caress grew quicker, gripped harder.  The sensation became more intense, and he would have cried out in pleasure if he could.  It was all culminating to a crescendo, and he felt himself pass the point of no return.  Pleasure erupted within him as the liquid spewed forth from his mouth, its salty-sweet taste not quite as distinct as the last time.<br />
<br />
The rubbing didn’t stop.  For some reason, he still felt aroused, and he welcomed the continued stimulation.  He felt like there was nowhere left to build, but like a roller coaster that had just gone down a drop and continued up the next hill, the momentum of the last release seemed to carry him faster into a new wave of arousal.<br />
<br />
The grip of the hand wouldn’t release him.  It rubbed and teased and caressed.  It brought him to the edge again.  Then again.  Soon, though the pressure felt like it was building, there was nothing left to release, and Jeff felt like he was dry heaving.  His whole body ached, but even that mixed together and was caught up in the waves of arousal, only adding to it.  He wanted it to stop, and he wanted more.  It hurt, but it just felt <i>so good</i>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jeff had lost count of how many times he had orgasmed.  He may not have had female genitalia, but it was like he could just keep going and going.  He felt like he was rubbing himself raw, and his dick ached, but it just felt too good to stop.  His knees had gotten too weak to keep standing in front of the mirror, and he’d collapsed back on his bed, stroking himself to completion time and time again.  Nothing was even coming out anymore, but he somehow kept orgasming.  He knew he should probably take a break, but he’d never felt anything like this before, and the sheer novelty of the situation was enough to keep him going.<br />
<br />
Pretty soon, he’d completely lost track of time.  He didn’t notice the chime from the computer as the timer hit five minutes left.  Nor did he notice as it eventually counted down to zero.</p>
