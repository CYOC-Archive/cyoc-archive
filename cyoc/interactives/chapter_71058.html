<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two weeks passed after the transformation of preppy law student Timothy Porter into farm worker Leroy. Madame <br />
Illusia’s shows were sold out. One cold night a man appeared in the back of the carnival tent. He sent a <br />
message to Madame Illusia on a business card “MUST SPEAK PRIVATELY. URGENT!”<br />
<br />
The card said William Henry Wells, Esquire, Attorney at Law.<br />
<br />
Stephen looked at and they exchanged wicked smiles.<br />
<br />
She yelled “There is a gentleman in the back who MUST speak with me! HE IS A LAWYER! Come forward, SIR!” <br />
All eyes turned to see a man in his fifties, extremely well and formally dressed. He said angrily: “No – I <br />
will speak to you PRIVATELY!”<br />
<br />
She responded: “I said COME HERE! NOW!” <br />
<br />
The gentleman attempted to leave but couldn’t move his feet. Yet he was able to resist the pull to the stage.<br />
Madame illusia yelled; “Ah! A strong man of iron will! You will need some help! Who will assist this man to <br />
the stage!”<br />
<br />
An Old Man said: “BE GLAD TO, MADAME!”<br />
<br />
He ran to the lawyer, who said “DO NOT TOUCH ME!”<br />
<br />
The Old Man grinned and said: “No need to put up a fight boy. You are coming with ME!”<br />
<br />
He was a foot shorter than the gentleman, but he picked him and threw him over his shoulder like a sack of <br />
potatoes. <br />
<br />
“HOW DARE YOU!” bellowed the lawyer. “PUT ME DOWN IMMEDIATELY” The crowd roared and clapped as he passed <br />
through in his expensive clothes, but when he stood on the stage, there was silence. The lawyer was very <br />
impressive – over six feet tal, handsome, lean and distinguished – and dressed impeccably. <br />
<br />
“Thank you friend!” said Madame Illusia to the Old Man. “Stay right here!”<br />
“Sure thing Madame!” smirked the Old Man,<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia circled the dapper and distinguished attorney. So did Stephen. So did the Old Man who carried <br />
him up. He was uncomfortable with the attention and was used to being in command.<br />
<br />
“I will get straight to the point. I am an attorney and the Dean of the finest law school in this state. My <br />
best student has changed his life because of you. I want to know what happened!”<br />
<br />
Madame illusia said “Sir, who is your student?”<br />
<br />
“Timothy Porter – he  is – or WAS – a law school student until he came here! Now he is working on a farm! I <br />
have not seen him in a month! I had a letter from him that said “Working on farm now. It’s great” cried the <br />
lawyer. “I found out his car was seen here that night. What happened to him?”<br />
<br />
Laughter and clapping and whistles broke out in the crowd.<br />
“Do any of you KNOW him?” yelled the lawyer. <br />
<br />
The Old Man grinned. “Sure. I know him real well Mister Hotshot. That boy works for ME”<br />
<br />
“HE WORKS FOR YOU!” said the lawyer, stunned as he looked over the Old Man’s filthy jeans and weathered face <br />
and beard. “The Timothy Porter I knew would EVER work for a lowlife like you! He is a brilliant young man who <br />
will be a lawyer!”<br />
<br />
The Old Man looked at the lawyer with silent rage. “He’s my farm hand, lawyer boy. And he ain’t so brilliant <br />
now. Not so high and mighty either. He was an arrogant boy when he came in here. Now I see you are the same – <br />
even more. Looks like you got some lessons to learn, boy.  Never too late to learn”<br />
<br />
“How dare you speak to me like that! Calling me BOY! Do you know who I am?! William Wells, one of the city’s <br />
leading attorneys! Take me to where Timothy works immediately!” yelled the lawyer.<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia snapped angrily: “YOU WILL LEARN!” She passed her hands suddenly over the handsome attorney’s <br />
face.<br />
<br />
He had piercing blue eyes. He was a handsome and impressive and powerful man.  But now his sharp eyes were <br />
losing focus. <br />
<br />
“It seems to me that you need somebody to teach you to obey.” She sneered. “We have to find a job for you just <br />
like we did for the former Timothy.”<br />
<br />
“FORMER Timothy! What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
The attorney, so confident, powerful, successful, commanding, wealthy and well dressed, was frightened and <br />
confused. His mind was cloudy. But he fought back. He suddenly noticed with astonishment that the Old Man was <br />
wearing very expensive black tasseled loafers <br />
<br />
The Old Man smiled a nasty smile. “I bought these fine shoes from the boy.”<br />
<br />
“Timothy Porter’s SHOES?! Then what he is HE wearing?” gasped the lawyer.<br />
<br />
“I keep him barefoot for his job” <br />
<br />
“What kind of job could he do in his BARE FEET! “ cried the lawyer. “There is NO job that a man can do where <br />
he goes barefoot! WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH HIS SHOES?”<br />
<br />
“He works barefoot every day – he’s getting’ used to it!” said the Old Man with a grin. “Those sure are some <br />
fancy clothes you got on!”<br />
<br />
The Old Man looked over the beautiful three piece suit, the silk necktie, the starched white shirt – and his <br />
eyes took in the cufflinks and gold watch. His eyes rested on the gleaming black polished shoes.<br />
<br />
“Those sure are a very fine pair of shoes you got on boy. Where did you get them? How much you pay? What are <br />
them fancy socks made of” said the Old Man. <br />
<br />
“ANSWER!” screamed madame Illusia.<br />
<br />
“They..are John Lobb shoes made in London. I paid fifteen hundred dollars for them. The socks are silk” said <br />
the lawyer reluctantly.<br />
<br />
The audience screamed.<br />
<br />
“There’s some jobs a man HAS GOT to do in his bare feet. Your former student won’t be needing these shiny <br />
shoes”<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia suddenly yelled “Let the transformation BEGIN! This is a wealthy, successful, well-dressed <br />
lawyer! He is obviously much too arrogant and high and mighty for his own good! We like to help people in any <br />
way we can! So we will give Mr. William Henry Wells a new life!”<br />
<br />
“What is going on? What is happening? Stop this ridiculous joke NOW!” shouted the lawyer. He sounded assured <br />
and confident but a slight panic was rising. <br />
<br />
He then realized he could not force himself to walk. He could move his arms and legs but could not leave where <br />
he was standing.<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia snarled “WHAT WILL IT BE FOR OUR FORMER BIGSHOT ATTORNEY? Who will change him to your liking?”<br />
The lawyer was now frightened and desperate as he realized he could not leave. He looked out at the crowd.<br />
“Those rednecks and scum?!” he yelled. “Keep them away from me!”<br />
<br />
A murmur of anger and energy moved through the crowd. <br />
<br />
The Old Man said: “I WANT YOU BAREFOOT”<br />
<br />
The attorney looked at him with revulsion. “You want my SHOES? NEVER!” he cried. “I am a LAWYER! A Professor! <br />
“I am 54 years old. I do NOT walk around in bare feet. In case you hadn’t noticed, I am wearing a SUIT!I don’t <br />
walk around in my bare feet – I’m not like YOU!”<br />
<br />
The Old Man snapped: “You don’t understand. You ain’t got a choice. I said I want you BAREFOOT. Nothing <br />
teaches a man obedience like forcing him to go barefoot in public – and wearing that fancy suit only makes it <br />
better! I took the fancy shoes off that stuck-up student of yours. I’m gonna go home with YOUR shoes too boy. <br />
And your socks! Take those shoes and socks off NOW!”<br />
<br />
“NO!” said the lawyer in a rage. But he still could not move.<br />
<br />
A voice shouted from the audience: “The humiliation starts now!”<br />
<br />
Screams of laughter followed. Madame illusia said to the man who shouted: “Come up to the stage my friend!”<br />
A huge biker walked to the stage, with a full beard and biker clothes. He grinned and pointed at the lawyer.<br />
“I never did like rich men in nice suits. Now it’s time to make you into something else. I wanna see you in <br />
your bare feet too!” sneered the biker. He picked up the six foot three inch tall lawyer and tossed him over <br />
his shoulder. The lawyer’s legs in their gleaming polished black shoes waved wildly.<br />
<br />
“Thank you!” said the redneck. He grabbed the lawyer’s legs and held them. He carefully untied one polished <br />
shoes and slipped it off. He then reached under the pinstriped cuff and found the top of his silk sock.<br />
“No – not my socks too” gasped the lawyer. Now one bare foot waved wildly while the other was still secure in <br />
its expensive shoe and sock. But not for long.<br />
<br />
“Hold still!” shouted the biker and slapped his captive on his pinstriped rear end.<br />
<br />
The redneck then grabbed the other shiny shoe and untied and pulled it off. He then slowly peeled off the <br />
other silk sock.<br />
<br />
The biker then put the lawyer back on his feet – which were now bare.<br />
 <br />
“I can’t believe this” gasped the lawyer.<br />
<br />
The crowd cheered. The biker handed one hundred dollars to Madame illusia. “I wanna make this lawyer boy into <br />
a biker. He’s gonna travel with us as my special guest…”<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia screamed “DONE! You gonna be a biker’s “boy”<br />
<br />
The barefoot lawyer and professor looked at them with horror. “I AM A LAWYER! THE DEAN OF A LAW SCHOOL! Are <br />
you insane!”<br />
<br />
The Bald Redneck grinned and said to the barefoot lawyer “Not anymore. Boy I’m gonna be wearing your underwear <br />
tonight”<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia yelled “Step right up! Put five dollars in the box and take one item off our fancy dressed <br />
friend here!”<br />
<br />
Cheers rose from the crowd.<br />
<br />
“WHAT?” yelled the lawyer.<br />
<br />
“We’re gonna strip you boy! Everybody has to pay something!”<br />
<br />
“This is a nightmare…” said the lawyer. He was trapped, stunned, breaking down and imprisoned.<br />
The bald redneck said “I’m watin’ here for your skivvies!”<br />
<br />
A long line immediately formed.<br />
<br />
A young man in punk clothes dropped five dollars in the box and walked over to the lawyer: “You look like my <br />
grandpa. I don’t like him. Gimme that pretty necktie. NOW”<br />
<br />
The lawyer felt his hands move to his beautiful made in France necktie, untied and pulled it off.<br />
Then a toothless farmer dropped his five and grabbed his wrist. “Looks like you won’t be needing a wristwatch. <br />
I’ll take this off you!”<br />
<br />
“MY ROLEX!” gasped the lawer.<br />
<br />
“Lemme have them cufflinks BOY!” snarled a man with a heavy beard. He grabbed the white shirt and unfastened <br />
them.<br />
<br />
“What do YOU need with cufflinks!” said the lawyer. “YOU would never wear them!”<br />
<br />
The man slapped the lawyer’s face. “Don’t talk back! You ain’t a bigshot now!”<br />
<br />
The lawyer was shocked.<br />
<br />
A fat and laughing man dropped five:<br />
<br />
“TAKE OFF YOUR SUIT COAT!” he screamed with laughter.<br />
<br />
“My suit” he whispered. Here he was taking off his business suit in a carnival…<br />
<br />
The beaten broken down lawyer unbuttoned and took off the jacket of his navy blue pinstriped three piece <br />
business suit.<br />
<br />
A giggling young man said “I’ll take yer vest”<br />
<br />
Off came the vest.<br />
The owner of the local diner said: “I don’t like lawyers. I wanted to strip one of you men many times. Take <br />
off your pants!”<br />
The layer unbuckled and pulled down his pinstriped pants.<br />
<br />
The redneck smiled: “Now for them skivvies. Lose the underwear lawyer boy!”<br />
<br />
The shamed, degraded lawyer took off his silk shorts and undershirt.<br />
<br />
“You’re in fine shape for a man of your age – not an ounce of fat” said the biker.  The biker pulled out <br />
clippers. “SHAVING TIME! Off with all that nice silver hair on your head! You will stay bald!”<br />
“MY HAIR” gasped the former lawyer. Within minutes he was bald.<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia suddenly produced several documents. “I got something for you to sign. “ Laughter filled the <br />
tent.<br />
<br />
She handed the papers to the stunned, stripped lawyer. “Sign it boy!”<br />
<br />
“HOW….HOW DID YOU DO THIS SO QUICKLY? HOW DID YOU…I DON’T UNDERSTAND! THIS SAYS I RESIGN AS DEAN OF THE LAW <br />
SCHOOL! IT’SA PROFESSIONAL LETTER!” cried the horrified lawyer. <br />
<br />
“YES!” screamed Madame Illusia. “Read on!”<br />
<br />
“This one says I resign as director of my law firm effective immediately! And this says I sign over my car, my <br />
bank account, my investments and my home to YOUR CARNIVAL! Where did you get all this information? This is <br />
insane!” said the horrified lawyer in desperation. “My lawyer will NEVER agree to this! My ex wife has to get <br />
alimony!”<br />
<br />
Madame Illusia grinned and handed him a pen. “I’ll take care of ALL of that. I will control his mind so he <br />
will agree to it all. There’s no way put for you Mister Fancy Lawyer! SIGN!”<br />
<br />
“I refuse to sign!” he cried. But he found that he had no control of his own hands. His hand signed one paper <br />
after another as he shook with rage and fear.<br />
<br />
The naked and bald former lawyer and former dean of the law school and formerly wealthy man signed over all of <br />
his possessions and money to Madame Illusia’s carnival.<br />
<br />
 “Put these on!” shouted the biker. The former lawyer found himself putting on a heavy, tight leather <br />
jumpsuit. <br />
<br />
The audience shouted with approval. “A big difference from your fancy suits, ain’t it boy!”<br />
<br />
The biker grabbed the lawyer. “I’ll keep you barefoot in your new life. No more expensive shoes for you!”<br />
<br />
The former lawyer screamed “HELP ME” as he was carried away to his new life.</p>
