<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellies eyes glimmered as an idea began to form. Smiling impishly she turned to Mary Elise and Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary why don&#39;t you come with me,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#39;ll talk with Merlin. Katie, while were gone I was hoping you can call the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What for,&quot; Katie asked.<br />
<br />
Kellie leaned in, whispering her idea into Katie&#39;s ear. Katie gave her friend a small smile and nodded as Mary and Kellie left to find Merlin.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that about,&quot; Mary Elise asked as they made their way downstairs. &quot;Just an idea,&quot; Kellie smirked. &quot;If it works then we&#39;re going to be able to get in alot of practice tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Mary Elise and Kellie entered Merlins study they could see the ancient wizard drinking tea and gazing at other timelines. &quot;Hey dad,&quot; Kellie said sweetly. &quot;What you up to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just glancing through timelines and catching up on some work,&quot; he stated. &quot;Is there something I can help you with?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded as the two approached. &quot;Yeah,&quot; Kellie said. &quot;Mary wanted to know why her ring can affect everything but age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin leaned back grinning as he looked the two teens over, he was about to give an impromptu magic lesson. &quot;Well Mary, Kellie it&#39;s a good question and one I will gladly answer.&quot; Standing and stretching Merlin now reached for one of the many books that adorned the wall of his study. Pulling out a rather old book, Merlin layed it upon his desk, opening it to a page that showed a picture of a tree with various branches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Without getting into too much detail,&quot; he stated. &quot;There are several different schools of magic or branches. The rings rhat you two possess have access to those branches allowing both of you control the magic and spells of those various schools.&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin pointed to one of the branches before gazing at Mary Elise. &quot;Mary,&quot; he said. &quot;Your ring is part of the transformative branch of magic. A very powerful branch indeed. As you&#39;ve seen the transformative branch gives you access to affect the physical world. This is why you can change people into animals, inanimate objects or even other people. Its power is strictly limited to physical transformations though. You can alter a person physically, however, it is onky physical in nature. It can not change who the person was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So its not as powerful as I thought,&quot; Mary grumbled. Merlin shook his head, quickly trying to put the teens misgivings to rest. &quot;On the contrary,&quot; he smiled. &quot;It is quite powerful. Mary, in time not inly will you be able to change others. You will be able to enhance yourself. With proper study and learning you can make yourself as physically strong as Hercules, faster that Hermes or even give yourself the appearance you always desired. It would also allow you to an opponent at a severe disadvantage, imagine taking on a strongman who was now physically frail or running a race against a runner whose legs were now rooted to the ground. Your ring is powerful but, like Kellies it has limitations because of the branch it has dominion over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Elise nodded, satisfied that while ring had limitations, it would be able to control an entire school of magic with the proper training.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what about my ring,&quot; Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah the Ring of Age,&quot; Merlin smirked. &quot;Well Kellie that ring has access to the Temporal branch of magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Temporal branch,&quot; Mary Elise asked.<br />
<br />
Merlin nodded as he gazed at the two inquisitive teens. &quot;Yes,&quot; he answered. &quot;You see the temporal branch has access to all time related magic. While this mostly involves age related spells it also has the ability to affect reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Ive already seen that,&quot; Kellie stated. &quot;And I&#39;ve pretty much used most of the spells from that branch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin smirked impishly, yes Kellie had tried most of the spells from that branch of magic, however, their was still one portion of the branch she had yet to learn. &quot;You are correct,&quot; he said. &quot;But their is one part you have yet to learn.&quot; Kellie gave her father a curious look as he gazed at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kellie,&quot; he said. &quot;The part of the temporal branch that you have yet to practice involves temporal manipulation on a grand scale. You see, you have the ability to traverse the timestream.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellies eyes widened as she began to understand what Merlin was stating. &quot;Wait are you saying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Kellie,&quot; he smiled. &quot;You can time travel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie sat down heavily in a nearby chair. Time travel. Kellie could move backwards and forwards through time if she so choose.  &quot;Why didnt you tell me,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time travel can be quite tricky,&quot; he stated. &quot;Even small alterations in time can have a significant effect on the timestream. Your niece, Lynne, is now painfully aware of that aftrr her adventures, however, it has its benefits and can be quite useful...if used sparingly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie and Mary Elise now stared in stunned silence after learning about just hiw powerful their rings were.  Merlin appeared please to have nit onky answered their question but taught them as well. &quot;It appears I have given you quite the bit of information,&quot; he said smiling. &quot;I do hope it was informative.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely,&quot; Kellie breathed. &quot;Thank you dad, but their is one more thing I wanted to ask you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Merlin said happily.  &quot;What is it you wish?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad would it be okay if I had my friends stay over tonight,&quot; Kellie asked sweetly. &quot;Please daddy? We want to practice with our rings and I really want to see all my friends. Pretty please?&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin narrowed his eyes as he watched his daughter give him a pleading and innocent look. Oddly he found himself compelled to give into his daughters request.<br />
<br />
&quot;As much as I wish to say no for some reason I cannot bring myself to say it,&quot; hr said curiously. &quot;Kellie? Are you bewitching me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No daddy,&quot; Kellie said innocently, despite the impish smile on her face. &quot;But there is somwthibg you should understand. Fathers have a difficult time saying no to their daughters, especially when we try to look sweet and innocent.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Im not sure if I approve of this type of magical manipulation,&quot; Merlin grumbled, causing Mary and Kellie to laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not magic dad,&quot; Kellie giggled. &quot;Its just part of the package when it comes to having children. You never want to disappoint them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Merlin relented. &quot;But try to remain quiet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie squealed with delight, thanking Merlin profusely as she rightly hugged the wizard. For a moment Merlin felt as if his heart was melting as a small smile spread across his face. Being a parent was hard but moments such as this were a reward.<br />
<br />
As Kellie and Mary Elise ran to join their friends in her room she couldnt help but smile. Kellie had pulled at rhe old mans heart strings knowing that a father usually relented tobhis daughters requests. It may have been a dirty move on her part but one that would nit only bring her and Merlin closer but allow the girls to practice magic. As the two teens entered Kellies room she smiled noticing that the rest of her friends had arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kellie,&quot; Samantha smiled. &quot;Katie said you wanted to see us. Something about spending the night?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled and nodded as she looked at her friends. &quot;Yeah pretty much,&quot; she said. &quot;To be honest, growing up and jumping from reality to reality, never had a chance to have a group of friends over ro spend the night. Hoping I can change that tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like fun,&quot; Lisa answered. &quot;Havent done this in awhile but Katie told me something about practicing magic too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie smirked as she looked at her friends, her sleepover did have other intentions as well. &quot;Was also looking to get some practice in,&quot; she said. &quot;But before I did I wanted to make surr everyone was okay with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Im game,&quot; Kumiko replied. The others nodded in agreement as Kellie gazed at the nine teenage girls.  &quot;Awesome,&quot; she smirked. &quot;In that case, Katie qhy dont you start.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With pleasure,&quot; Katie smirked as she made a wish.<br />
<br />
The teens all shuddered slightly as they curiously gazed at one another. Karen was the first to notice things seemed slightly different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sammy,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Did....did you just get shorter?!?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha looked herself over, noticing her long sleeved t-shirt seemed to be bunching up at her wrists. As she gazed at Karen she noticed the girls glasses slide to the end of her nose. &quot;Umm,&quot; she stammered. &quot;Everyone looks different...if i were to guess, I would say...we look...younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Krllie smirked as she saw the group of 15 year olds examine themselves, discovering that they did seem younger now. The teens now found themselves rapidly leaving high school as theu inched back towards childhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Kellie smiled. &quot;Katie needed some practice with her ring. And I figure what better way to havr a sleepover than becoming kids. Never had a chamce growing up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How old will we be,&quot; Karen asked in awe, noticing her clotbing slowly becoming roomier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie,&quot; Kellie grinned. &quot;Why dont you tell them.&quot;</p>
