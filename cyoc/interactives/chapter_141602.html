<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha Lane was at one time Tom&#39;s girlfriend of two years. They had met in one of their business classes and had really hit it off.  Samantha had fallen in love with Tom&#39;s boy next door looks and the idea of him going pro in football one day. While other people had seen Tom as purely a football prospect, she knew Tom to be a real gentleman and a guy with a sensitive side. <br />
<br />
Samantha gasped when they materialized next to her bed.  In today&#39;s reality she had never known Tom.  Stephen types a few things into the computer and Samantha&#39;s eyes widened. <br />
<br />
She saw before her on the floor her boyfriend looking and smelling like a horrible disgusting creature of perversion and filth. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on!?&quot; What are you doing here Tom?&quot; Who&#39;s he?&quot; She looked from the figure of Tom on the floor and to the slight, blond freshman standing next to him. <br />
<br />
Tom gave a whimper but said nothing as he had not been told to speak. <br />
<br />
Stephen said, &quot;Samantha, this is Tom now. Tom has changed quite a bit since you last saw him. He&#39;s decided he doesn&#39;t feel much like the top dog on campus anymore and he wanted to share that with you.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Tom whimpered as he felt compelled to lay on his back and show his belly to his girlfriend.  He rolled over, displaying his dirty cock and balls and be froze panting his long tongue lolling out of his open mouth. Then, to his horror, Tom felt his bladder empty and hot piss began to stream across his abs and dribble down his body forming a puddle around him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Rank Meat gets so excited around company.&quot; Stephen said as Samantha&#39;s nose curled at the sight of her boyfriend pissing himself. <br />
<br />
Tom got to work licking his own piss off the parts of body he could reach with his long tongue. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think of Tom Samantha?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s  gross. Who could want someone as nasty as him around? When we dated, Tom was always clean cut and good looking. Now he looks like some kind of nasty faggot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom watched as Stephen typed.  He then felt something in him change. The long heavy piercing on his cock gained some more distance as his foreskin lengthened.  Filling up with the grunge of more dick cheese. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go on.&quot; Stephen said.  <br />
<br />
Samantha continued.  &quot;He looks like a real pussy now.   He&#39;s got no balls.  The Tom I knew would never let someone humiliate him like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom realized he was a huge fag.  He couldn&#39;t get it up at the sight of a woman.  His balls began to grow even more distended and he dribbled pre at the thought of being humiliated by Stephen.  <br />
<br />
Then Stephen said, &quot;You know what a dog needs, a good boy to feed him and take care of him.  How about you train him into something better?&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha said nothing.   Then she felt pressure in her shoulders. Her arms began to expand and her chest became two slabs of muscle.  Her hair grew into her scalp as a short crew cut.  In seconds there was a young man sitting in her bed where the young co-we has once been.  Sam stood up off the bed.  Stretching as he stood there clothed in only a fresh white jockstrap.  <br />
<br />
Stephen said, &quot;It&#39;s a shame the wedding&#39;s off. You were so ready to take his last name.&quot; With a few keystrokes Sam&#39;s body shifted. He became almost a twin image of Tom Stout&#39;s former self actually, he was.  He was the star of the football team.  He was the all American kid that Tom had been two days before.  <br />
<br />
The room around them shifted and changed.  Instead of the girly paintings, the room was now an exact copy of Tom&#39;s old dorm.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sam it seems like you&#39;re more of a man than Tom ever was.&quot; Stephen said.  <br />
<br />
With that, Sam&#39;s cock grew to be a mirror image of Tom&#39;s modified dick but unstead of the nasty dirty foreskin, it was circumcised and perfectly groomed and nestled in the expanded pouch of his jockstrap. <br />
<br />
Sam has become everything Tom had lost. She had transformed into an exact replica of him down to the same birthmarks and musculature. Tom watched in awe as the football star strode confidently around the room all trace of the girl she had once been was completely gone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tom, your girlfriend is now an idealized version of your former self.  She will be like you but in every way a little better than you were. All the things about you she loved and admired are now just a little better in her.&quot; Stephen said with a grin.  <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, he owns you and the only person he&#39;ll ever be as rude to as you were to me will be you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom looked over in the corner of the room and he saw a dog bed covered in discarded compression shorts and jockstraps.  Tom bounded over to the bed and felt himself start chewing on a sweat stained cup that Sam had left lying around. <br />
<br />
Sam ignored Stephen and said to Tom, &quot;Come on dog meat. It&#39;s time for some training.  Get over here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sam pulled down the jock and laid down on the ground.  His cock growing hard.  <br />
<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;Time to learn how to practice sitting.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Tom got out of his doggy bed and went over to his former girlfriend. He pulled out the tail shaped plug and began to work himself on the dick of his former self. <br />
<br />
Facing away from Sam, he rode up and down on the pole of his master. The &quot;BIG HOLE ON CAMPUS&quot; tattoo moving up and down as he arched his back to work the tool. <br />
<br />
Stephen moved over to him and whispered I his ear.  &quot;Not only is your life fucked, you&#39;re going to spend the rest of your days fucking yourself on your former life.&quot;</p>
