<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was another quiet Sunday night at the hospital. All activity had ceased, with most of the staff going home early after the exhausting week. They couldn&#39;t wait for the arrival of the government superhero experts tomorrow.<br />
<br />
In an isolated ward, a guard stood watch over the door, napping in the quiet of the hospital. This was a ward where criminals resided in, ones that were obviously troublemakers but couldn&#39;t be convicted and be placed on prison hospitals. At the moment, there were only four patients.<br />
<br />
They called themselves &quot;The Four Horsewomen.&quot; Quadruplet sisters who&#39;d been abandoned at birth, living on the streets and surviving off the rare generosity of scoundrels who took pity upon the young girls. They were truly children of the city, having never known a home. No orphanage could hold them, no adoptive parents wanted them. They were all on their own, and that suited them just fine, living off the streets with pickpocketing and small-time heists.<br />
<br />
Now adults, the girls all had an almost identical, gaunt figure, with stringy black hair and piercing brown eyes. They had been planning their first big job, hitting a jewelry shop, when the floor of the abandoned building they were using to scout out the place had collapsed from under them, sending the girls careening three floors down. With no way to prove they were planning a crime, they were sent to St. Serena&#39;s to recuperate under careful watch. You&#39;d taken pity on them, seeing their malnourished forms, and had shared a bit of your power with the delinquents while they&#39;d been sleeping.<br />
<br />
That power had now festered inside of them for weeks, working through their underdeveloped bodies until finally, tonight, its job was done. With a final push, the energy mended something inside each of the women, unlocking the potential they were denied at birth.<br />
<br />
Four pairs of eyes snapped open at once, the girls pulled from deep sleep by a curious, intense sensation within them. Something was happening.<br />
<br />
All the women were writhing, their bodies burning from inner fire as they began to evolve. Their forms filled out, generating fat to develop the womanly figures years of malnutrition had robbed them of, their bodies rounding out with medium curves. However, the drastic changes came with the emergence of their powers.<br />
Pestilence was first, the toxic bully of the group becoming even more so as every disease known to man begun to churn within her, and more being born by the second. Her brown eyes turned sickly green as her hair took on the same shade, all the while her backside grew, mighty buttocks soon jutting out behind her as her lips filled with fat. Merely being near her was dangerous, her sweat glands emitting noxious gases and liquids, but her kiss could infect her victim with ever diseased she was carrying, most likely turning them to dust from the sheer volume of disease contained in her saliva.<br />
<br />
War grunted as her lightly muscled frame hardened, reaching for new heights of strength as her body was overflowing with power and energy, biceps inflating, a rock solid 8-pack carving itself onto her stomach, her thighs blowing up with immense muscles and fat, turning her legs into mighty pillars of femininity and power.<br />
&quot;GRAAAHHHH!!!&quot; she cried out. The hotheaded brawler of the sisters became even more aggressive and combative as more abilities were pushed into her amazonian frame. Her strength skyrocketed to superhuman levels, cars now mere tin cans for her, building pathetic sandcastles. Her skin hardened as she became completely indestructible, a fact reinforced even further by her powerful healing factor. And if being an unstoppable battle tank of a woman wasn&#39;t enough, her body was also gifted with tremendous speed, capable of easily eclipsing world-class runners, though not really holding up to true speedster heroes. War&#39;s bed was pulverized in a final roar of triumph as her eyes and hair were stained a bright crimson red.<br />
<br />
Famine was a curious case. She was always the most unassuming sister, staying on the sidelines, but she had developed into a capable manipulator, twisting her words into convenient truths for herself and her sisters, holding others around her little finger. And as her body blossomed, her natural charisma rose along with her developing bust, two huge mounds dominating her developing womanly figure. Her color was golden yellow, like ripe grain, her body adorned with long and beautiful tresses of hair as she gained an unparalleled insight into human nature, her seductive form specifically crafted to exploit inherent weaknesses in humanity, to play with their wants and needs. And when she reeled in her prey, she could finish them off with her vampiric powers, her very presence leeching strength and vitality from others and adding it to her own, boosting her luscious form to even greater radiance. She giggled with her new, crystal clear and seductive voice, relishing the control she held now.<br />
<br />
Last, but most definitely not least, was the leader of the sisters. Death. What she lacked in looks, brains and power, she more than made up for with sheer ruthlessness. True to her name, she was the only one of the sister who had actually taken a life to this point. A disgusting pimp who had tried to take advantage of her and her sisters. She had stabbed him to death without a second thought, her cold, black eyes holding no emotion. The only love and compassion she had was reserved for her sisters, and she wouldn&#39;t let anything happen to them.<br />
Thick, black mist began emanating from her as Death ascended. Her ass wasn&#39;t huge like Pestilence&#39;s. Her thighs weren&#39;t thick like War&#39;s were. Her breasts didn&#39;t hold the same ripeness as they did with Famine. But she was still clearly the alpha, her looks a perfect blend of all the sisters, her shape supremely balanced and luscious. Her black tresses stumbled down further, almost reaching the ground as they grew longer, thicker and stronger, their color darkening to a deep, abyssal black that infected her eyes as well. The black mist was coalescing around her, clouding her form in mystery. The mist spread, soon clouding the entire room, gently embracing the bewildered  sisters who were coming down from the high of their own changes. However, everything else the mist touched soon began to crack, crumple and wither, metal eroding, walls developing deep cracks, the whole room was shaking as Death&#39;s power was developing. More and more smoke was pouring out of her, and soon she realized that she could control it at will. She got up from her crackling bed, and directed her new power at the locked door. <br />
She could feel  strength swirling inside of her, power of unknown magnitude. With each passing second, she could feel her abilities grow, the reinforced steel door buckling under her influence. Her head was dizzy, new information sparking within her brain as her mists started breaking down the door. But she couldn&#39;t stop now. Not when they were this close. She redoubled her efforts, straining more and more, pushing her newfound powers to their limits, all to break down this barrier between their freedom, until at last...<br />
<br />
CRACK<br />
<br />
It was as if the world itself shuddered as she broke through, the entire wall blowing apart as the mist flooded the hallway. Her sisters were cheering, relishing in their freedom, but Death couldn&#39;t hear them. She was fully encapsulated in the mist. It was in her lungs, in her brain, in her blood, in her eyes. She rose off from the ground, spinning in the air to the dismay of her sisters, curling into a fetal pose, the blackness deepening, seeping into her until-<br />
<br />
She. Was. The Mist.<br />
<br />
Death screamed out, her usual stone-cold facade broken as she ascended, fully coming into her power.<br />
<br />
All these years, she had won the genetic lottery, a one-in-a-billion chance to become what she is now. All these years, her true self had been denied from her, now unlocked thanks to the grace of a kind nurse.<br />
<br />
On that day, the world witnessed the birth of an Apollyon-class supervillainess.<br />
<br />
Death was now death. She embodied she very concept of ending, of finality. Her powers knew no limits. Nothing could stand against her mist now. No barrier could resist the erosion of her influence, no organism could her her alluring siren call, telling them to end their own existence. A mere glance from her could kill you if she so desired. <br />
But the limits of her powers didn&#39;t end there, as she could affect now even more abstract concepts. She could kill the mind, rendering her victims into empty husks. She could kill distance, instantly teleporting through her mists to anywhere she desired. She could kill TIME, to temporarily halt the flow of time anywhere she desired and even affect past events she was connected to. Luckily for the world, this ability had strict limits... for now. And even as she was coming to terms with this new abilities, she could feel more developing as her true potential as an Apollyon-class was awakening.<br />
For the first time in her life, Death smiled.<br />
<br />
Her ascension towards goddesshood was complete, and she decided to celebrate. She took a look at herself, and frowned. Surely not an appearance worthy of a goddess. Floating in the air, encapsulated within her mist, Death put her new abilities to use. First she discarded the cheap hospital gown she had grown to hate, by tapping into her own timeline and killing the person who produced it. Her face stretched into a gleeful grin as the gown vanished from her. Now stark naked, she got to work on herself, killing off defective genes that were impeding her growth, knowing that as the true mistress of death she couldn&#39;t hurt herself. Her labors paid fruit as she felt her body rearrange according to her new genetic structure. Her hair stretched even longer, now trailing well behind her, pooling on the ground as she floated. Her body cracked as she surpassed the mediocrity nature had blessed her with, soon eclipsing all her sisters in looks. Ass, tits, hips, lips, face, all of them were moulding and perfecting themselves until she truly was a goddess among men. Her body hair shed itself, or rather blinked out of existence. Her skin grew paler as her lips and nipples turned black, truly making her resemble an ultra-sexy Grim Reaper. Satisfied with her new looks, she let the mists coalesce around herself, forming an elegant silky gown that trailed behind her, adorned with imagery of death and suffering. She cooed as misty wings were formed on her back, completing her look as the mists parted, revealing her to her sisters.<br />
<br />
Pestilence, War and Famine couldn&#39;t say a word as their ascended sister stepped out from the mists, her wings flapping gently to keep up the illusion she needed them to fly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Death?&quot; Famine finally piped out, unsure of how to approach this incredible woman.<br />
<br />
Death smiled at her. &quot;Yes, dear sister.&quot; she confirmed. She shared a look with each of them, and they relaxed. Despite their new powers, they were still sisters. Inseparable.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you have many questions, but know this: From now on, we shall have no need to survive. From now on, the world is at our fingertips.&quot; Death said, admiring the black mist that was dancing on her palm. She opened it and breathed, wreathing her sisters in the matter, and smiling as they felt it invade their very existence.<br />
<br />
&quot;The world will know its new rulers soon enough,&quot; she stated as she stepped into the mist herself, the cracking of bone, squelching of flesh and flowing of fat soon quieting as she killed space between them and their destination, teleporting herself and her sister, in the process of being remoulded by her power, out of the hospital, leaving behind only a wrecked room and a small pile of ash that had been their guard.</p>
