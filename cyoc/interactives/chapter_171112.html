<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Angela sat on the edge of her and Jacob&#39;s bed, now completely naked, though her shorts still pooled around her ankles. She felt like she was in shock, she could see the changes progressing along her body, but she knew there was nothing she could do about them, not at this point. She&#39;d have to sit down and really peruse her grandmother&#39;s spell book to find something that might help, if she even wanted to risk casting anything out of it again.<br />
<br />
Her feet had grown in size now, from petite and feminine to large and masculine. They looked almost as big as Jacob&#39;s, a size thirteen, though she&#39;d have to try on his shoes to be sure and that was just a line she wasn&#39;t willing to cross right now. Red hair wasn&#39;t only on her head and pubes anymore either, her legs and arms sported a fine coating that shined copper like against her now slightly paler skin, freckles having popped out along her shoulders and chest. A chest that also now sported a light dusting of fiery red hairs.<br />
<br />
She shuddered as her breasts finally completely disappeared, sinking into her chest. Actually, it looked more like collapsing as their disappearance revealed wider, flatter mounds of muscle beneath them. With that, the last sign she was ever female was gone. Sure the little nub between her legs was barely noticeable, only an inch or so long and she had no sign of balls, but anyone looking at her would think male.<br />
<br />
Worse was the swirling thoughts in her head. She remembered being Angela, but it was becoming foggy and indistinct, another life was edging in on her thoughts, similar to hers, but not. Still raised by his grandmother, who lived to a much older age than in her other memories, still passing away before he turned eighteen. Going to college, still the same business major. The stand out was a face in all those memories, from elementary school right through college. A best friend who looked remarkably like a young Jacob, or maybe one of his sons. Dark haired and tall. He remembered getting into trouble with him, working out with him, them admitting they had more than just friendship feelings for each other, their first kiss, their first...<br />
<br />
His cheeks blushed at the memory of their limbs tangled together, exploring each other&#39;s bodies with mouth and hands, the nub of a cock between his legs stiffening at the memory, pushing out a few inches as it did so. Sharing a dorm in college, graduating, his name. He heard a thud come from somewhere in the house and sprang to his feet. He ran to the door and opened it to peek out...<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Andy was not having an easy time getting home. His longer legs were eating up the mile between his school and his home quickly enough, the problem was his clothes felt tighter with each step. The waist of his jeans popped open just after he got off school property, and he had to grip the fly in one hand to keep it together and his pants up. A cramping in his feet made him discard his too small shoes about a block later, his socks stretched over larger feet. Thank god it was the middle of the day and the neighborhood was pretty much deserted with kids at school and adults at work. Three inches of hairy forearm stuck out of his hoodie now, and a couple of inches of stomach showed between the bottom of that and the waist of his struggling jeans. Hard stomach, he noted with his hand pressed against it.<br />
<br />
He could feel the seams of his pants popping stitch by stitch as he hurried along, finally making it to his house. Angela&#39;s car sat in the driveway. No chance he was going to get in the front door without her seeing, she&#39;d be in the downstairs living room most likely on one of her job searches. Well, it would be the first time he had to sneak in or out of his house. He made it through the gate in the fence just as his jeans finally couldn&#39;t take anymore and ripped right up the sides.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck..&quot; Andy hissed under his breath and let the useless garment fall to the ground, leaving him in boxers that strained over muscular thighs and cradled a significantly more manly bulge than he was used to. He resisted the urge to peek, though damn were his legs furry, he was definitely taking after his father. That had him panic for a moment and put his hand to his hairline, which he sighed with relief when he noticed it was still full and thick, for now, at lease. What was his plan anyway, he practically chided himself. Try to convince his dad he was who he said he was? What other choice did he have? He scratched an itch on his jaw, and snatched his hand away as if burned when he felt his fingers move through facial hair. &quot;I just shaved.. really?&quot; <br />
<br />
He went over to the tree that grew next to their screened in porch, giving him a way to climb up on the roof of that porch and into the window of his bedroom that was right above it. He had done it several times over the years, but this was the easiest climb he ever had. Powerful arm muscles he hadn&#39;t had the last time he climbed this tree pulling him up, though he also weighed quite a bit more, a fact he felt more than ever as he had to rely on a few branches that bent under his weight far more than he liked. The roof of the porch held him firm though as he got over and shimmied open his window. Hopefully none of the neighbors noticed. &quot;Hello, 911? There&#39;s a man in a hoodie and boxers breaking into my neighbor&#39;s house.&quot; That wouldn&#39;t end well. He tossed his backpack into the room ahead of him.<br />
<br />
He leaned in to go through his window and his shoulders banged against the window frame. He tried another angle and couldn&#39;t slip through that way either. His chest and shoulders were too broad, at least until he put his arms over his head and shimmied through like a diver. Though that didn&#39;t help when he came through, couldn&#39;t steady himself, and fell the rest of the way into the room with a loud thud. No way Angela didn&#39;t hear that. He lay on the floor of his bedroom for a moment, waiting to see if he heard her, when the coast seemed clear he got to his feet.<br />
<br />
Annoyed, he stripped off his hoodie with some struggle, almost ripping the thing before tossing it on his bed. Though he stared down at himself once it was off. His chest was firm and broad, with heavy pecs and a a short but complete coating of dark hair across the muscled expanse. The hair was trimmed short enough to make a design across his upper right pec visible, a design that continued down his arm, his whole arm, even working in the thorny band that had been the first. He recognized several of the images from his own sketchbook, and even the ones he didn&#39;t he could point to and find what they meant to him in his memories. One for coming out, one for his boyfriend.. his..<br />
<br />
He blinked a few times and sat down heavily on his bed. He hadn&#39;t noticed those memories shifting, it was so subtle. He remembered his father still, and years spent with his mother he had never had before. They had had him young rather than waiting to have children as it was in his old memories. His brother coming along later though, his mother passing, though his father never remarried. Still were the memories he had of his best friend. Ryan, no not Ryan, this was another red head, almost exactly like his old friend but different in some ways. Ways that let them be together, to be in love. Thoughts of his red-headed lover had his cock pushing against the strained fabric of his underwear, his eight inch erection pushing the waistband away from his skin. But there were new memories as well, he was a bigger kid in his memories, taking more after his father, played football, got into weightlifting, but his passion was still art, he still wanted to do tattoos.<br />
<br />
No, he did do them. He had graduated college along with his boyfriend, he&#39;s been apprenticed at a tattoo parlor for a couple years, though his mentor pretty much trusted him now, his boyfriend worked at the same parlor though taking care of office work to leave the artists free. Andrew looked up and met a face looking back at him from the mirror above his dresser. Dark, thick, black hair swept back out of his face, long enough to tuck behind his ears. A full black beard, trimmed short and neat, he even had a few piercings in his ear. He looked so much older, he knew he was only twenty-four though.<br />
<br />
The room was different too, it looked like it hadn&#39;t been lived in in years. It had some of his stuff in it still, his old bed, some of his old sports trophies, old toys and such. His favorite possessions were gone, there wasn&#39;t even a sign of the slight mess his room was always in. Everything was neat and tidied. The room of a kid who had moved out. He started as he heard the front door open and close. &quot;Shit..&quot;<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
The room was different. Angela peered out expecting to see the upper hallway of her house and instead saw a short hall that lead to a furnished living room. He quickly turned around, and the bedroom was different, too. Still a master bedroom, but smaller, a bit messier, not a house but an apartment. &quot;Get a grip, A..&quot; He blinked, his name. &quot;A.. AJ?&quot; His voice was deeper, smooth but low.<br />
<br />
He thought, no.. his name wasn&#39;t really AJ, that was his nickname. Used to keep him separate from his best friend, they shared a first name. Andrew.. but he went by AJ and his boyfriend went by Andy. &quot;Andy? That&#39;s who I..? Crap..&quot; But thoughts of Angela&#39;s step son could not be brought up, he knew it, but the memories that wanted to surface were of a man in his twenties, tall, muscular, with pitch black hair and beard. He had memories of a younger Andy, but even those didn&#39;t line up, taller and more athletic than the Andy only faintly remembered in Angela&#39;s fading memories. He was perfect.<br />
<br />
The room suddenly felt familiar to AJ, it was the apartment he shared with Andy. He walked over to the closet where there was a mirror and looked himself over. He was shorter than Andy, though still taller than Angela had been. 5&#39;10&quot; to Andy&#39;s 6&#39;2&quot;, he liked it though. He gripped the walls as he lost balance from his muscles having another spasm of growth. AJ had gotten far more into bodybuilding than Andy, and they actually weighed the same. His pecs jutted out round and firm, his arms and legs thick and sturdy. It gave him a much heavier and stockier look than his tall boyfriend. The tattoo on his arm filled in more, a dragon wrapping around the middle of his arm, and water and flower petals up and over his heavy shoulders. It was a piece Andy had made just for him and done himself. He loved it.<br />
<br />
He looked up and met his own bright blue eyes in the mirror, examining he broad, squared face that had nearly no trace of Angela in it. Short red hair, that flowed into an even shorter red beard, freckles smattered across his nose and cheeks, though his skin was still smooth and unlined. He had only graduated college a few years ago he knew. It felt strange being 24 again, almost as strange as being in a whole new body.<br />
<br />
There was a strange slightly painful feeling between his legs as his balls suddenly dropped, filling a large, red-furred sack between his thighs. The loose skin of his scrotum tightens as his balls grew larger, his cock snaking out from three inches to seven, veins snaking along its thick length. He reached down and took his cock in hand, starting to gently stroke it, eyes sliding shut as he went over his memories of being with Andy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting started without me?&quot; The deep, slightly raspy voice has him turning his attention to the bedroom door where Andy stood grinning at him.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Andy looked around his room. He needed clothes. He doubted his dad&#39;s would work, the seemed to be the same height now but Andy had more than a few pounds of muscle o n his old man, and certainly none of his old clothes would fit... right? He dug into his dresser and found an old pair of sweatpants and a football jersey that looked on the bigger side. These were not clothes had had before he changed, but looking around the room he noted several things that weren&#39;t there, then with a shock, that the hoodie he had tossed aside was gone. His backpack sat in a corner, but his wallet sat on the bed next to where he had been sitting, along with a set of keys.<br />
<br />
He quickly pulled on the clothes, which weren&#39;t a great fit, a little on the tighter side but they did the trick. A look in his closet found him a pair of flip flops which he slid on his feet. Shoving the wallet and keys in his pockets he readied himself to try to sneak out of the house. He creeped out of his bedroom and then down the stairs, did they always creak so loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Andy? I thought that was your car.&quot; Andy turned around quickly and came face to face with his father. Completely unchanged from how he looked this morning. Tall, lean, shaved head and salt and pepper beard. &quot;Something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy blinked a few times, surprised his father wasn&#39;t freaking out. But if so much had changed including his memories, was it so strange others might? Only he remembered as if through a fog, his father looked like everything was normal. &quot;No, I just needed to grab something, didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be home so early.&quot; He looked down at his outfit when his father gave it a curious look, then shrugged. &quot;Laundry day.&quot; And that answer seemed to satisfy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to stay and chat? It&#39;s been a while..&quot; His dad smiled, though it seemed a little sad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t, I need to get going..&quot; He needed to be away from here, to think, he felt like there was a place he needed to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, how about you and AJ come over for dinner this weekend, Jeff misses you and I&#39;d like to see my son once in a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy felt a knot in his throat but he nodded. &quot;Sure thing, dad, love to. Saturday.&quot; He had his hand on the doorknob.<br />
<br />
&quot;Saturday. I&#39;ll grill some steaks for my boys.&quot; He instantly seemed more chipper and Andy gave him a smile and a quick hug before slipping out the door. Sitting where Angela&#39;s car had been was a bit of an old beater he recognized as now being his, a car he had driven since he was sixteen.<br />
<br />
There was no need to look up addresses or check his phone. He started driving, memories carrying him to an apartment building in the downtown area. He parked behind the building and started up a familiar flight of steps to a door. One key on his keyring went right into the lock and he stepped in, feeling like he had come home. It was a slightly messy apartment, but warm and lived in. Some of his favorite things were about and other things he recognized as AJ&#39;s. He heard a sound coming from the bedroom and headed that way. For the first time he set eyes on AJ, even though he had memories of seeing him almost every day. His boyfriend had his hand on his cock, slowly stroking away, muttering his name softly. He saw the tattoo on AJ&#39;s arm, recognizing it as a piece of art he had actually only drawn days prior, but he grinned widely to see someone inked with it. &quot;Getting started without me?&quot;<br />
<br />
AJ turned towards him, &quot;Hey...&quot; There were no more words needed as the two stepped closer and wrapped their arms around each other, mouths meeting. Andy broke the kiss only to get his shirt off over his head, while AJ shoved the sweat pants down, Andy stepping forward to leave those behind with the flip flops.<br />
<br />
They kissed, hungrily, Andy grabbing AJ&#39;s muscular ass in his hands while AJ ran his finger&#39;s through Andy&#39;s chest hair. Soon they were on the bed, AJ on his back with Andy leaning over him, kisses moving down his neck and across his shoulders. AJ spread his legs apart almost instinctively as Andy reached up and grabbed a bottle of lube from where he knew it sat. New but so familiar, they went though the motions as if they had been done a hundred times but it all felt so new. Andy lifting AJ&#39;s legs onto his shoulders, first using a few fingers to lube AJ up before pressing the head of his cock up against that warm, puckered, opening. Then pushing inside eagerly.<br />
<br />
It was like a key sliding into a lock, a perfect fit. Tight, pleasurable, warm. AJ was moaning softly, hardly looking uncomfortable at all, no, he looked ecstatic, his hands winding in the bed sheets. Andy set a quick pace, and AJ eagerly kept up, squeezing and massaging the shaft inside of him like an expert.  The two men panted and groaned in harmony as Andy slid in and out of AJ. Then began to thrust faster and faster.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck.. I&#39;m going to cum..&quot; AJ said suddenly, his cock twitching. Andy nodded and grunted, hilting himself inside of AJ as he felt his own climax near, filling his boyfriend with his seed for the first time and the thousandth time. AJ&#39;s cock sprayed his seed across the dusting of red hairs on his chest, leaving both men sweating and panting. Andy collapsed on the bed next to AJ, reaching down to take his hand in his own. &quot;I&#39;m sorry..&quot; AJ began. &quot;This is my fault. I messed around with something I..&quot; He stopped as Andy put a finger over his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Later. But.. I&#39;m not angry and you don&#39;t need to apologize. I feel.. good, right.&quot; He leaned in and kissed AJ. &quot;I want to enjoy this moment.&quot;</p>
