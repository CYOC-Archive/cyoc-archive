<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile...<br />
<br />
Four people began their approach back toward the cabin in the woods, after spending what felt like surely forever roaming around in the woods, ironically enough looking for one another. These four consisted of male cheerleader Gary Lambert, his girlfriend Monique Stevens, the cheerleader Clara, and the well muscled chaperone Graham.<br />
<br />
Gary currently dealt with a change that had occurred in him out in the woods - his manhood had distorted into a more lupine instrument, and he had ended up with a gray and black wolf&#39;s tail that currently rested inside his leggings&#39; band. Somewhat uncomfortably so. But it was better than letting it be seen that he was so rampantly inhuman - at least as far as he was concerned. Though with how tight his leggings were - being a male cheerleader - there wasn&#39;t much he could do should his new organ act up.<br />
<br />
Where had these four folks been? And where was Mina, the daughter of the local psychic...?<br />
<br />
<i>If someone asked the hypothetical &quot;you&quot; to assume what a male cheerleader might be like, the answer would probably not be anything like what Gary Lambert was...and yet, in a different sense, the answer might be &quot;exactly Gary Lambert, but...&quot; Gary was presently in the bus with the cheerleaders and chaperones. And it was precisely the chaperones who gave Gary grief. In no small part because of his unique predicament.</i><br />
<br />
Seated by the back, trying to make sure he had some space in case he wanted to do something with someone, Gary was a peroxide blond, tanned young man with a very lean, tightly muscled body. Dressed presently in his cheer attire, Gary leaned back against the seat. He didn&#39;t expect quite so many chaperones, hence his visible displeasure. His bright blue eyes darted around, hoping that the adults - and one adult in particular - would leave them be.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Gary was someone people often assumed, due to his looks, his body structure - including a very generous and tightly muscled ass - and total pretty boy face that surely, surely, Gary was gay. An assumption he faced often, almost daily. One of the most frequent teases he got was asking if his boyfriend was around. The thing was Gary was straight. And aggressively so. Despite the reputation of his sport, or perhaps because of it, he was a smidge oversensitive to any suggestion he was homosexually inclined.</i><br />
<br />
<i>And as if overcompensating for it, the fact he by all appearances looked like a twink, Gary was known among the cheerleaders as an utterly gifted and enthusiastic lover. Perhaps it was overcompensating, but the varsity cheer squad knew that if they ever needed some companionship, Gary was an eager and continuously enthusiastic partner.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Presently, Gary was just across from Monique, his partner in an open relationship. Both agreed neither could meaningfully commit, so Gary encouraged her to enjoy herself, whereas Monique helped Gary with his own screwing around - giving him tips on how to please women better.</i><br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
<i>Graham Parker was the youngest of the chaperones - a former football player himself, Graham was tall, incredibly well built and muscular, his black hair cropped short and in a buzz cut. His features were handsome in a slightly intimidating way. He looked every bit like the standard bully in a movie or tv show - probably named Eugene, Brad, Chad or something. Except Graham was ultimately a very supportive guy - perhaps a bit too supportive. Gary hated being coddled. Supposedly, Graham busted his knee in college, and hence, here he was volunteering as a chaperone.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Graham was openly bisexual, and for all his look, he tried his hardest to both be a stern and fair chaperone and support his charges. It was just that one of the rules was &quot;no hanky panky&quot; so to speak, and that was precisely what Gary hoped to get away with in the back. Quite a few times on the road when Gary and Monique got handsy, Graham would interrupt with a &quot;this is your reminder - no sexual activity on the bus&quot;. Even when it was just makin&#39; out!</i><br />
<br />
<i>Gary scowled when Graham went back to check on him. Graham asked, &quot;You doing okay back here, Gary?&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<i>&quot;I&#39;m fine, captain killjoy,&quot; Gary replied.</i><br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
<i> A few minutes later, the bus had come to a stop. Sitting there as the downpour rattled the bus, Gary was no closer to release. After encounters with both Graham and Mrs. Ann, Gary was worse for wear, his young body needing action and now. Seeing the football team piling off their bus through the window, Gary started to get up. &quot;well, if they can&#39;t find the exit, maybe we can.&quot; Leave it to the muscle men to get stuck.</i><br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Not without a chaperone.&quot; Graham stepped up, not exactly eager to strain his knee too terribly much, but he knew what would probably happen if he let Gary &quot;the walking libido&quot; Lambert and Monique go out into the woods. They were exactly the dumb kind of teens who would fall into the tired horror movie stereotype of teens fooling around in the woods.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Gary felt like screaming, but he looked around at the remaining cheerleaders after Mrs. Ann lead the first group off of the bus. &quot;Any...other girls wanna follow along?&quot; he inquired.</i><br />
<br />
<i>&quot;I&#39;m down!&quot; Clara DuFresne stepped up. The red head cheerleader was a former girlfriend of Gary&#39;s, and the two had separated under rather contentious terms. She wasn&#39;t however in the mood right now to hold that as a relevant issue. The jocks were gathering around their bus, but Gary didn&#39;t care about that. It looked like there was some sort of cabin up a lit path away from the busses, trees lining the path.</i><br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Count me in.&quot; Mina Corcoran - a somewhat petite brunette - said. She was getting a rather odd vibe from the place. She was if anything the most superstitious - it comes from her mom being a TV show psychic.</i><br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Gary and Monique had ventured into the woods, whereupon they had discovered the cursed nature of not only the woods, but also the cabin that rested at the heart of them. It seemed Gary had experienced something of a wave of lust that led him into an encounter out there in the woods that led to him becoming equipped with his present masculine organ and his new tail. There had been no more fooling around since then - not a word about sex or pleasure or Gary being horny. Even though it seemed like every odd moment or two in their attempt at getting back, the young man felt some twinge in his new equipment.<br />
<br />
He knew Monique wouldn&#39;t be up for any sort of fooling around with him now. Especially due to what happened the first time. She blamed herself for Gary being &quot;mutilated&quot; and so she kept her distance and seemed colder and more distant. If she hadn&#39;t gone forward with their encounter out there, she&#39;d said in a whisper on their way back, Gary would be normal. Gary wouldn&#39;t need to worry about so much as dropping trou among his fellow students.<br />
<br />
She knew - there was only so much privacy to be had out here. And if things kept going, eventually he&#39;d be discovered.<br />
<br />
Of course, theirs was far from the only sexual misadventure...<br />
<br />
Clara and Graham had experienced their own &quot;almost&quot; encounter out there, before Graham outright almost <i>screamed</i> and pulled away...<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Yeah...yeah they are.&quot; Graham said with a smile as he flexed and showed how big they could get at full flexion. This just brought Graham right back to his glory days. When he would swagger back into the locker room among other gorgeous, muscled jocks. Letting himself see the masculine and powerfully built bodies on display - shuffling into the school&#39;s showers and having to stop himself from springing an erection around so many muscular forms. Thinking about grabbing one of them and inviting him along for a nice hard fuck alongside one of the cheerleaders. Letting his football bro fuck his ass while Big Bear Graham fucked the cheerleader&#39;s pussy---!</i><br />
<br />
<i>Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Graham was getting too into these fantasies! He stirred back to reality as he saw Clara&#39;s eyes were wide. She was staring - not as his flexed biceps, but at his rock solid, hard dick, sticking up in his pants.</i><br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Mr. Parker...&quot; The varsity cheerleader whispered to him. Leaning forward and cupping his good knee. Feeling her hand starting to tease the head of his insurgent rod. Graham whimpered, wanting to tell her to back off. To not do this kind of thing to him. That she was really teasing an older man too far...!</i><br />
<br />
<i>Graham breathed, &quot;...Clara. Clara you---you can&#39;t be---be doing this kinda shit to me. You gotta stop. I don&#39;t---don&#39;t wanna be screwing around. I&#39;m---I&#39;m getting too horny. If you keep touching me there something might happen.&quot; He quivered in place. Clara looked at him - she was herself feeling subsumed in a lustful state.</i><br />
<br />
<i>But she also knew they were so close to the cabin...what if someone else caught them out here?</i><br />
<br />
He had been cold and alone ever since. Uncomfortable so much as being too close to Clara. Especially when Gary revealed to the two of them what happened when they caught up. Ironically, after Graham cooled off, he agreed to go search for Gary and Monique - resulting ultimately in the four searching for each other in short order all the way up until they ended up finding each other just outside the cabin. But nothing it seemed had patched up the issues at hand.<br />
<br />
Graham coldly rejected a hand on his shoulder from Clara - noting as he did his knee had not been bothering him ever since the time out in the woods. It was...it was all unnatural, what happened here. He started to wonder if the place really was as cursed as Mina said it was. And speaking of whom, <i>where</i> was Mina even? It seemed she went off to go meditate and when they came back they could not find her anywhere.<br />
<br />
Gary and Graham had somewhat reconciled, Gary could admit that in some aspect Graham had been right. If he hadn&#39;t fucked Monique out there, he wouldn&#39;t be walking around with...all THAT going on. Maybe...maybe even if he didn&#39;t know, Graham still had a point.<br />
<br />
Gary and Monique were distant, but Monique showed concern toward him - hoping she could somehow find a way to bring Gary back toward humanity.<br />
<br />
Clara...? Clara was still feeling frustrated from the lack of contact she had with Graham, and how he was treating her now. She got it, she had overstepped her boundaries, but how was she supposed to know fucking would turn someone into---into--- Clara gulped and looked at Gary again. She was considering something she never would&#39;ve thought of. The break-up between them had been contentious, ugly, and neither exited it feeling particularly good about the other. And Clara now was contemplating trying something with him. With a man with a fucking wolf&#39;s dick.<br />
<br />
Was she this sexually starved after her misadventure with Graham?<br />
<br />
As they entered the cabin, looking around, it sounded like there was definite activity here. Gary took the lead in looking around - and before long they found someone. They were apparently a young woman with a large, impressive bust that drew Gary&#39;s eye, black hair, and...<i>what</i>. A deer tail? Well, considering Gary had some wolf stuff going on right now, he was not about to freak out over deer stuff. This person was apparently wearing what looked like a football player&#39;s clothes going by size and style, oddly enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit...&quot; Graham said as he followed in. &quot;What happened to <i>you?</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t---Don&#39;t even fucking ask.&quot; The person in question bitterly replied. The venom was quite intense, and Gary was slightly taken aback.<br />
<br />
The male cheerleader commented, &quot;Who are you...? I mean, you look kinda like Matt&#39;s sister. I didn&#39;t know Matt had a hot sister.&quot; This seemed to rankle their new acquaintance, and for her part, Monique put a hand on Gary&#39;s shoulder. Cautioning him - reminding him of what happened the last time he got hot and heavy.<br />
<br />
But then the deer-like person said something that left all four of them gawking, &quot;I&#39;m---I&#39;m not a---not my fucking sister!&quot; Finally working himself up into a proper rage, Matthew shouted, &quot;I am Matt! I&#39;m a man! A MAN, you hear me Gary you fucking sissy!!&quot; Matthew scowled, evidently in the denial phase. As far as he was concerned, as long as he had his dick, he was a man - and he intended to carry himself that way. Dressing in his clothes, behaving as a man.<br />
<br />
&quot;No fucking way...&quot; Gary muttered, looking at Matt - and wondering what happened. If this person was even telling the truth. And if so, how far could these changes go? How long were they out in the woods looking for each other that this happened?<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that I have much room to doubt you at this point,&quot; Monique said, &quot;But I have to make sure. Alright, big man. Tell me who you, Matt, had as your first girlfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt crossed his arms under that weighty and impressive bust, &quot;Kacey Lansing, my english tutor, two years older than me at the time. We started doing it in the study rooms, and she taught me all I know about---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay you proved your point.&quot; Monique interrupted, not intending to let him get to the sexual bits, knowing full well that doing so might result in some activity around here. <br />
<br />
&quot;So we found you, where&#39;s everybody else?&quot; Gary stated, looking around...</p>
