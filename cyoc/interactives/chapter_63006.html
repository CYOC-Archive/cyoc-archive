<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite warnings Steve left no different then when he entered. He was only there for a few hours, he put on a mask of interest through their lectures on the importance of physical activity, the difficulty of maintaining a high GPA while being a jock, the dedication and training needed to play a sport. He couldn’t fathom it; everyone there reeked of science, discovery and logical knowledge so why were they defending primitive pastimes like sports? They should be on my side, he thought. <br />
His parents drove him home sadly, they had been promised ‘progress was made and would take some time to show’ but there son seemed as miserable and misanthropic as ever. He went to bed sulking and arose the next morning sulking. They drove him to school with the desperate hope that this would be the day they picked up a different, happier and more athletic son. Little did they know this day their prayers would be answered.<br />
After his classes, Steve picked up a peculiar scent.  It was overpowering and though familiar he couldn’t place it, he could only follow it in an almost hypnotic trance.  He followed it to the swimming pool and stopped, watching and listening.  The swim team was in the middle of practice, most of them.  The infamous captain, Chad, was in his speedo but while the others practiced he sat on the side, eyes vacant and smoking a blunt.  Steve could overhear the protests of the team between laps, trying to get their captain in the water.  Chad was a good captain, on his better days, the best swimmer the school had ever seen and maybe that wasn’t entirely a good thing.  The praise and pressure had clearly gotten the better of him and using his position and boyish good looks he had become lazy and arrogant, skipping or wasting most practices and passing his time with his flavor of the week girlfriends and drinking and smoking constantly.  A jock was allowed to have fun but his grades were dreadful and the team was falling apart without a strong leader.  The team however, couldn’t rat out their unbalanced leader, it went against their silent code.  Steve however could and though he mistakenly believed it was out of his own disdain for jocks a far more sinister force was manipulating him, leading him to the AP who he led to the pool.  Steve pointed out to the AP the high Chad with a slight grin of satisfaction and watched as he was escorted away.  <br />
The other swim team jocks had all by now climbed out of the pool to watch the commotion, they saw their captain get taken away, knew he would be taken off the team and knew who was responsible.  They all turned and looked at Steve first out of curiosity than bewilderment as he fell to the ground.  The group picked him up and carried him into the locker room, lying him out on a bench and watching with interest as something unusual came over the small nerd.  <br />
When they first set him down, Steve barely covered half the bench with his small and meek frame.  Before the team’s eyes he groaned and thrashed in agony.  Horrible noises could be heard as his bones stretched and changed.  His spine elongated quickly and painfully stretching his height from 5”4 all the way to 5”11.  His legs slid out of his jeans slowly reaching the other side of the bench as they grew longer.  His shirt pulled up and couldn’t hide his muscle devoid stomach anymore.  His arms far outgrew his sleeves until his tee shirt looked ridiculous on him.  Even his neck grew somewhat longer, his whole body pulled upwards like a toy making him look silly and wiry.  His hands clenched the bench tightly as they expanded, fingers growing longer and palms spreading outwards.  The swim team members hesitantly helped him up and out of his clothes, much to his dismay.  His sneakers were moved just in time for like his hands his feet became huge, slightly larger than what would be normal for his impressive height.  They grew long and thin with large toes, together with his large hands they would propel him through the water soon, hopefully.   <br />
“What the… what the fuck man!  This shit’s unreal!”  Steve cried out with the only words he could think of, mostly profanity.  His formerly vast vocabulary, despite probably lacking adequate adjectives for this transformation was reduced to nothing.  His brain was weakening, loosing his prized intelligence.  He remembered being smart and a part of him missed that and a new part of him despised intelligence and tried to force its own interests in.  Urges he had never felt before, overpowering desires for sex, popularity, weed and partying threatened to take over and were only barely kept at bay.<br />
Meanwhile Steve’s body was filling out more to help make him a true swimmer.  His current body had the height now but was still pathetic and nerdy.  He lacked the strength and constitution for swimming but that would soon be rectified.  Spreading up from his larger feet came the muscles Steve never wanted but now needed.  His legs bulked up with tight calves and thighs.  His entire body slowly began to bulge with toned teenage muscle.   His abdomen painfully defined itself with a visible six pack.  He ran his hand over it in disbelief, feeling the smooth but firm flesh and strength.  Suddenly he groaned anew, leaning back as before him his pecs pressed, quickly becoming round and noticeable if not huge.  He bent forward a bit as his chest spread outward and his shoulders and back expanded.  His lungs filled with air, expanding to allow him to spend long stretches of time underwater.  His heartbeat raced, pumping much needed blood to every changing cell in his body.  Finally his long lanky arms became thick and toned to a reasonable size from doing laps he had never done before.<br />
His mind continued to melt, all those math and science skills and aspirations were slipping through his mental hands.  He shook his head trying to force the images out before smiling dumbly, feeling himself go hard at a barrage of thoughts involving him and various women at school known for not being extremely difficult to get into bed.  His diminishing will fought a losing battle against his growing ego and libido.  He barely took notice as the swim team members handed him a speedo, Chad’s speedo and he put it on.  The front was loose for just a moment before his equipment filled it to the brim.  “Man I need some bitches” he moaned aloud without realizing it, his voice changing as he spoke to almost match that of Chad’s.  The others guided him to a mirror to watch the finishing touches take place.  He changed from a swimmer version of his old self to something very familiar.  It started with his hands and feet which grew a little bigger still as his feet grew slightly wider.  His minimum leg hair turned blond for a moment before vanishing along with the stuff on his arms only his arm pit hair remained but even that was blond now and sparse despite the fact he must be several years older.  All over, his once pale skin gained a thorough but not excessive tan.  His face changed, maturing, his teeth straightening and becoming shiny white.  His cheekbones rose slightly and his cheeks became a little red.  His dull eyes brightened with mischief and became a mysterious hazel.  His hair turned blond and shortened but became somewhat thick and wavy, naturally styled so he looked good from right out of the pool.  For all intents and purposes he looked just like Chad back when he was fully committed to the team.<br />
He realized he knew the name of everyone around him, all their strengths and weaknesses.  He knew several strokes, practice routines and how to lead a team but he also knew how to roll a blunt, how to reduce a hangover and how to give a girl a good fuck.  But this body, these skills were all new to him, he was unaccustomed to even walking in this form and he had no muscle memory of swimming.  He walked away from the mirror in shock almost tripping over his new big feet.  <br />
As Steve took stock of his new form in walked a man the boys all knew as coach but Steve knew all too well as one of the scientists.  “Hello boys.  Meet your new captain, Kyle.  Kyle, as you’ve noticed your DNA has been completely overwritten with that of Chad’s.  You could easily pass for his brother.  From now on you have to lead his team, you’ll find Chad’s skills waiting inside your head, you can just slip into being him but it comes with his urges.  Your intelligence, you’ll find has also been reduced to be the same as his.  If you manage to take control and balance your life, leading this team to victory you’ll get to go back, if you so desire.  But you know the rules, if you can’t maintain a C average or you get caught doing something like smoking on campus your off the team and stuck that way for good.  But know just because you got his looks and mind my team ain’t going to give you respect without you earning it.  You’re starting from scratch with them boy.  They already know what’s going on and I’ve told them to help you but they ain’t going to make your job easy.  Good luck, you‘ll need it.”</p>
