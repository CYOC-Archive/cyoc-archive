<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William Anderson&#39;s class began and went fairly well. While he might not have gotten to going over what he wanted to do for the new week&#39;s lectures and discussions, he at least had an overall plan that would let him work through things in terms of the overall schedule for his classes. That work of pre-planning for the year was enough to let him play the day&#39;s activity by ear. Some things had been switched up a little thanks to the issues relating to Yvette Smith&#39;s trial that came from her forcing him into were society, but for the most part he had managed to get his classes back on track with the syllabus that he&#39;d drawn up for each class before the school year started.<br />
<br />
That let him work fairly well with students and keep things progressing, and for the most part his students did respond well. Now, some of that might be the fact that College students got to pick their classes from a list that was available to them, but William also liked to think that a lot of it was his own work to make the days events interesting. His first class on Monday being one of his freshmen classes that worked with more of a introduction to Shakespeare and his works left things open to discuss many of the things that related to Shakespeare&#39;s works that tended to come up, even if they weren&#39;t necessarily normally a part of the the planned lesson.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say,&quot; a student spoke up, &quot;this may be a bit off topic but I do have a question.&quot;<br />
<br />
William turned to the student, and found him sitting a row behind the front row. The student was male but looked like he had some questions on his mind. William also noticed that the student was behind Harry and Jenny, and he also noticed that Harry looked a bit nervous and was pensively looking over to Jenny seated beside him. She didn&#39;t look to bad, but Harry&#39;s look jogged some concerns in the back of William&#39;s mind. Jenny was like him, forced into were society thanks to Yvette&#39;s games or actions, and while from some rumors that he&#39;d heard that Yvette was now being honestly repentant since Jenny&#39;s transformation was completed, that didn&#39;t change how Jenny entered were society or the issues that were troubling her. She and Harry had been getting along quite well, and William thought they were making real progress with regard to their coming wedding and Jenny&#39;s adaptation to being a werevixen, but he supposed that there were some issues going on. However, that would have to wait as he still had the question to answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; William said to the student who had spoken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you&#39;ve talked a lot about all the things that relate to Shakespeare... all his plays and poetry and so on,&quot; the student began.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the base influence that he&#39;s had on the English language, yes,&quot; William nodded, &quot;and we will go through a few of his plays over the course of the semester as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
The student nodded, &quot;well... it got me wondering on some things and I went looking into a bit more and I found this website that was talking history and Shakespeare and it said that Shakespeare wasn&#39;t historically accurate... Is that right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In many ways, yes,&quot; William nodded, &quot;Shakespeare has written plays that involve history or focus on historical characters, and while this may come more into the more advanced courses... we will touch on it a bit in the future in that while Shakespeare did write on history, he was still writing fiction and his goal wasn&#39;t to be historical. Thus why there are mentions of mechanical clocks in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; despite the fact that mechanical clocks weren&#39;t invented until well after the fall of Rome and not to mention the differences between the character Macbeth and the historical Macbeth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Macbeth was real?&quot; another student asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a Scottish King named Macbeth, yes,&quot; William nodded, &quot;but the historical figure is very different from Shakespeare&#39;s character, and would be something more you&#39;d want to discuss with the History department as that will begin to get away from our class&#39;s focus. But we will get into greater depth on Shakespeare&#39;s reasoning for how he wrote his characters as we go through the course of the semester.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could we get history points if we do have History classes?&quot; the student who had asked the first question.<br />
<br />
&quot;That may depend on the class and whether or not your professor wants to work with the English Department,&quot; William gave a small smile.<br />
<br />
He was ready to turn to his closing statements when the bell rang and marked the end of class for the day. William quickly dismissed the class and presented the homework for the next class and moved to check on Harry and Jenny. They were both fairly good students and the connections to him thanks to Yvette&#39;s earlier actions made him truly concerned for their own happiness as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two doing okay?&quot; William asked as he approached the area where Harry and Jenny were seated.<br />
<br />
The looked to him and then to each other as the other students departed. Jenny gave Harry a warm smile and patted Harry&#39;s hands for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re doing okay, Mr. Anderson,&quot; Jenny spoke, &quot;though... there is still some tension with regard the wedding...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tension?&quot; William asked, &quot;your parents have been pressuring you and Harry? Still?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the fear, Mr. Anderson,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;and it&#39;s been pressuring both of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
William looked to Harry specific, &quot;I&#39;d noticed. You looked rather pensive from what I could see...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a bit of a nightmare last night,&quot; Harry commented, &quot;that the jerk from Alabama showed up and murdered me... and it may be only a nightmare, but it could become real.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think so?&quot; William asked, &quot;I&#39;m sure everyone is going to do their best to keep both of you safe and give a shot at being happy. Myself and my family included.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My thanks, Mr. Anderson,&quot; Jenny gave a small smile and patted Harry&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d both thank you for your help,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;but with all that we know this Wilhelm guy has to have done... that fear is there all the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
William gave a sigh. From what Jenny had told him, he knew that she had a lot of pressure on him from her family and particularly from her parents and figured that Dieter Wilhelm was another potential problem that they&#39;d need to confront. The parent and teacher in him wanted to protect them to the best of his ability. However, his the fact that he wasn&#39;t a therapist like Frances Twist, he was limited to giving them encouragement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;m sure it&#39;s nothing to be truly worried about,&quot; William said to them, &quot;so long as you both retain your confidence and work with the rest of Moon Lake... I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll all find a way to keep you both safe and happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
William then reached forward and took both Jenny and Harry&#39;s hands and held them up, patting the tops of them with one free hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because since all of our respective transformations into foxes... I&#39;ve seen a lot of joy between you two,&quot; William gave a warm smile, &quot;it reminds me of my bond with my wife, and I&#39;m sure everyone else sees that too. We will do our best to keep you happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Mr. Anderson,&quot; both Jenny and Harry spoke as they looked to the wall mounted clock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you&#39;d both best a move on,&quot; William commented, &quot;if you have a class coming up you don&#39;t want to be late...&quot;</p>
