Part four<br />
Jim Finally sees the new Max <br />
<br />
&quot;As much as I like lying here in the sun...&quot; Max says to himself. &quot;It would be more fun with friend. Time to garner some attention from a certain lifeguard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max heads off for the water and dives right in. Despite his massive bulk he barely makes a ripple in the surf. It was if he was part fish. His massive lungs held minutes of air. He swam under the water for quite a distance. When he finally surfaced he was at the buoy area surrounding the beach. Max so invigorated and full of energy he could stay out here all day. But that won't get Jim out here.  Time's to fake a reason for a rescue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta make this look good.&quot; Max says to himself. &quot;Jims at his tower and there aint nobody close to me to foil the rescue, now to get his attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max starts splashing madly about in the water in hopes it would be enough to attract Jim's attention. <br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Jim was looking out the gulf water for any trouble. It had been a relatively quite day. He didn't have to leave his post once. The beach patrol kept the college crowd under control. All the in water rescues were in the other areas. Jim spent most of his day checking out all the guys.<br />
<br />
&quot;It could have been a real boring day if it weren’t all the gorgeous sites.&quot; Says Jim as he looks over the beach.Jim didn't let his passion for the male body keep him from being a lifeguard. He had so many water rescues that his friends gave him the nickname, Aquaman.<br />
<br />
 He would pass the time, between rescues, by guessing where the tourist had come from. Jim would guess where they came from by their choice of beachwear. The European males wore nylon shorts. The Australians males would wear board shorts on top of their Speedos. The South Americans were the easiest to spot in the crowd. They wore the skimpiest swimwear. Even the males wore small suit. He didn't mind working the tourist section. It was his second favorite post on the beach next to the all-adult section. In the all-adult section the guessing game was different. Jim called it  “Spot The Gay Boy”. Just like the guys from Brazil, the American gays wore a lot of tight swimwear. Anything that would show what they had was worn. From thongs to square cut swimwear, the lower rode the better.<br />
<br />
All that daydreaming got Jim sporting a good size bulge in his swimsuit He was about to call the base for a restroom break to take care of it when he spotted trouble in the surf. It was a swimmer in trouble. Jim grabbed his floatation device and jumped into the water. <br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's time that 'boy' sees me.&quot;  Max thinks to himself as he splashes about. &quot;I gotta make this look good or that youngn’s gonna figure I'm a faken it.&quot;<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
It was short distance to the drowning swimmer. On the way out Jim could see the swimmer go under a few times. Just as he reached him the splashing swimmer goes under surface again. Jim dove down under the water looking for the guy. The water was a little cloudy to see clearly but soon he spotted the shadowy figure of the swimmer. Putting one arm around the swimmer Jim heads back to the surface.<br />
<br />
When Jim finally reaches the surface gasping for air he exclaims.” Man this guys big! He must be one of those bodybuilder that I see out here from time to time. You would think a guy this big would know how to swim.&quot;<br />
<br />
 The swim back to shore was an arduous one for Jim. Keeping the swimmers head above the water was no easy task. With the help of the beach patrol he was able to bring the guy onto dry land. That’s when his life saving training kicked into high gear. <br />
<br />
Checking the guy out to see if he was still breathing Jim thinks to himself. &quot;Man this guy is built. Look at the size of that chest. … No can't think about that now Jimmie boy. Get your mind back to your job. … Check for pulse, its faint but there. … OH MY GAWD! His arm is as big as my entire leg … now’s not the time for a boner … any movement in the chest … such a magnificent chest. Those pecs are so pronounced, look at the separations in his abs. That suit is so small and his package is so … NO back to work … no chest movement, no breath, there must be something in the wind pipe.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jim opened the swimmers mouth and checked for obstruction &quot;... nothing there.&quot; Jim says to himself. &quot;Time to use the Heimlich maneuver. I can never get my arms around that big chest, got to do it flat on the ground.&quot; Jim straddled the swimmer trying not to sit on the guy’s package, which happens to be one of his favorite positions. It felt as if the guy’s package was growing beneath Jim's ass. He puts his hands in the middle of the chest, just below the sternum ... &quot;What a chest it is ... &quot;, with one quick push, with the heels of his hands, he lunges forward. A little bit of water came out but only a mouth full. &quot;Time for a little mouth to mouth resuscitation. Man this job has its perks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim 'dismounts' the guy to get a better angle on the guy’s mouth. He tilts the  head back and pinches the nose. Jim makes contact with the guy mouth and begins to exhale. The next thing he knows Jim is under the large swimmer in a lip lock. <br />
<br />
All the guys that were standing around watching the lifeguard do his job were given a show. There they were two guys, deep in a passionate embrace. The crowd was cheering, whooping and doing wolf whistles.  <br />
<br />
“Look at the back on the big one.” <br />
<br />
“I just love the bubble butt on the big one.”<br />
<br />
“Hey there big boy when you’re done there with junior I’d like a turn.” <br />
<br />
“If you get the big one I get the little one.”<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of kissing Max says. “What took you so long Jimmie Boy?”<br />
<br />
&quot;Max?&quot; Questions Jim. &quot;Is that you? What are you doing here?”<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad to see you too.&quot; Max reaches down and cops a feel. &quot; I can see you are glad to see me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am but not here, not now.” Jim breaks away from Max's embrace. “I'm working.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It don't look like nobody here seems cares what two guys are doing on the beach.” Max stands up and helps Jim to his feet. “I think theys all liked our little performance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I could use a break right now.&quot;  Jim grabs Max's to keep from falling down. &quot;Whoa? I don't feel so good right now&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me help you there Jimmie boy.&quot; Max steadies Jim as they walk back to the beach office. &quot;You aint lookn so good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel... kinda strange... right now.” Says Jim trying not to fall down. “It feels like my legs are made of rubber. I must have gotten too much sun today.&quot;</p>
