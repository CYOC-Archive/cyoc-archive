<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sally continued to look on in a state of delight as the changes progressed that Jeff had to admit about Sally being human, there was still something spooky about having to watch his former pet using his computer. It was even more freakier to realize that he was letting her use his own new software and accessories. He also knew that the Chronivac worked for he was thrilled by the power Jeff now had, even if he was temporarily at the mercy of his pet as he started to rub his own belly.<br />
<br />
he was surprised to find a variety of new nipples, albeit tiny underdeveloped ones that He eventually rubbed a place on his belly, which tickled a little as it made his leg kick out to the side for it nearly made him fall! however, Jeff watched in fascination while looking at the mirror now as he felt the way his standing there with his tiger like legs on his human body that he shortly turn to her while completely getting ready for being his former pet&#39;s pet. &quot;well, at least I have someone who understands what being a pet means while what they go through for a living. after all, you were once my dog as you know a thing or two on what goes on. not to mention about... Ohh... urgh...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was cut short for he felt some what warm on his nether region that Sally got off the chair and helped him sit onto the side of the bed as Jeff was feeling somehow really aroused by all of this. feeling a little confused about what&#39;s going on, she asked him. &quot;Jeff! what&#39;s wrong? are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
waving it off to her, Jeff told Sally what&#39;s up while she could see that he was sweating about it. &quot;i&#39;m fine... i&#39;m just feeling a little woozy, that&#39;s all. although, it&#39;s almost like i&#39;m in some kind of heat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally knew on what was going on as he&#39;s going though with it right now for it was a tiger&#39;s equivalent of masturbation that by looking down to his lower area, which he quickly covered up with his tiger arm paws by instincts is where she didn&#39;t have to guess what&#39;s going on with him to see his penis was slowly erecting while stiffening up. Sally started to feel aroused by this herself that her nipples were poking out as she was being turned on. &quot;Jeff, you&#39;re certainly in heat, but you&#39;re also currently going through the next phase of the changes as your privates proves other wise.&quot; Sally said in arousment towards Jeff,who was also panting heavily by this.<br />
<br />
&quot;wh, what do you mean by that... urgh....&quot; Jeff painfully said as the changes escalated up to his dick that the fur spread up to his balls while the little public hairs he once had began to thin out and detached from his skin, floating downwards to the floor like a feather would. soon enough, white fur covered his sack of balls completely as the rest slowly reached around his penis while leaving his shaft completely bare. Jeff felt like he needed a quick release as he wrapped his paws around his erected dick, but couldn&#39;t get himself to stroke it back and forth that he wished for hand right about now.<br />
<br />
as he tries to stroke it with his tiger paws, which were useless by now that he kindly asked Sally to help by suck it while feeling embarrassed about having his former pet helping out his needs. gently placing her lips around his dick that this put shivers down his spine as it did felt wrong while giving him goosebumps, but all he cared about right now was reliving his load off. Jeff was nearing his reaching point of his orgasm while Sally was helping him in sheer pleasure, before Jeff&#39;s privates had a chance to start changing to those of a tiger&#39;s for if it were up to Sally that she would&#39;ve had claimed dominance over Jeff by making out with him then helping him with his masturbation time.<br />
<br />
thinking about this as she knew Jeff was becoming more of a tiger by the second that even if she wanted to have sex with him, she was human as the cross between the breeding of the two species would be very weird. as tempting it may sound, she decided to wait on this for another time and experiment with that feeling. until then however, she&#39;ll have to enjoy on what she&#39;s got before her that Jeff soon screamed as he started to spew up his cum. ejecting it into Sally&#39;s mouth as she tastefully swallowed every drop of seman for Jeff felt the last of his human cum being emptied out of him that he took a deep breather from his orgy while being pumped out by Sally, feeling the changes which were still happening to him.<br />
<br />
his penis started to change for it grew longer, but his mushroom head was still there as his skin was covered in a thin layer of white fur that the skin on the mushroom darken to a red like color. soon what was left of Jeff&#39;s human shaft has now become completely changed to a humanoid tiger&#39;s that his dick went limp as he took his final breath, he looked down to Sally. tired from this excitement, he spoke. &quot;Wow there... that was something... unattended... and yet, unexpected. I didn&#39;t think that this could be so intense with you helping with my... masturbation. thanks...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally laughed at this for a moment while wiping off the extra cum that was leaking out of her lips with the back of her hand, before talking to Jeff again. &quot;huh... you think that was intense? just wait, if you make out with a right girl that it should feel more intense then what you just had. I should know, I had some experience with that... when I was just your dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff turned to her in horror for he was a little shocked by what he was hearing from her that he had to ask he as he was surprised by all of this. &quot;you mean... you had sex, with other male dogs? before you became human? young lady, I sure hope that you don&#39;t have any plains of having puppies in your womb.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally shrugged her shoulders off as she said no while telling him why. &quot;the dogs that mad out with me were mostly spayed and neutered. ever way, I don&#39;t think that they have the sperms necessary enough for me to carry puppies in my womb... let alone a baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled for he was relieved to hear this from her that she wasn&#39;t going to be pregnant with someone else&#39;s dog to have babies. besides, who knows how many former puppies were going to be in that womb of her as she was turned human. suddenly though, Sally laughed it off as Jeff mostly did too about this silly talk of having kids for he then finds something going off with himself. noticing that he was strangely feeling very comfortable about his form as he was suppose to be walking around on all fours right about now while he wonders why, he decided to ask her.<br />
<br />
&quot;well, all dogs and mostly other animals are on all fours. however, i&#39;m keeping you as a two legged pet. in a way, you&#39;re going to just live with the idea of things here. pretty sweat, if you ask me.&quot; Sally said, while joking around it.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned to his former pet as he argued back at her. &quot;says the one who was just a dog a few minutes ago that&#39;s now getting the use of standing and walking on two legs now.&quot; starring at each other for a moment, before the two laughed it up as they enjoyed the jokes that they each now share.<br />
<br />
after everything settled that Looking down to see if he was changing more, he found his orange, black, and white hairs of fur sprouting all over him as it spread passed his stomach and back and up to his chest and upper shoulders that he could feel his bones and organs of his body begin to shift around to there stronger position. Jeff felt something at the base of his spine as more changes took place that even his ribcage compact and barrels out while giving him a bigger and stronger look like a tough guy for even his organs moved around to fit and help accommodate his new muscular body, sort of like The Great Khali of WWE with his body stretcher. Jeff kept on watching the changes for he now had a stronger body to be proud of, even if it looked more of a tiger style as it even looks comical to him that his head was still his for right now.<br />
<br />
even though Jeff did felt humiliated as he did apparently let this happen, he was however impressed that she&#39;d programmed his changes so quickly for him. He supposed he could live with the indignity for awhile. After all, he wanted to properly test the Chronivac as he was becoming a humanoid pet tiger with no clothes now that he was going to have to step out of his comfort zone a little. Well, this was what he wanted that Hopefully, he wouldn&#39;t look too ridiculous in front of his pet-turned-master-who-was-most-definitely-still-a-pet!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow, your coat looks supper adorable! it came in just perfectly as the Chronivac said it would. Mind if ... mind if I touch?&quot; Sally commented as his coat neared completion to his second layer of fur that Jeff didn&#39;t even fully make sense of what she was asking of him, until after realizing that he&#39;d already absent-mindedly nodded to her.<br />
<br />
This was getting all just too weird, and he couldn&#39;t really think of anything to say. Sally was the most gorgeous woman who was asking to touch his naked furry body, which was somehow confusing him enough. he didn&#39;t have the hormone levels to get aroused at the idea of physical contact with her that it was sort of now embarrassing, but it was probably for the best in this situation. Furthermore, When she gently ran her hand across the fur of his belly and then started rubbing it that his eyes rolled back in his head for he couldn&#39;t even bring himself to care on how unnatural it all was to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful Jeff, don&#39;t kick me. lean back a little bit.&quot; said Sarah that Jeff found himself lying back on the bed with one of his legs striking out in the air as He shifted to a less dangerous angle while Sally petted his sides.<br />
<br />
Jeff inwardly resented getting pet-talked by a woman who would still be a dog if it weren&#39;t for him using his computer, but the feeling of dexterous fingers against his wiry short fur had him too intoxicated to respond. He felt like he wanted to just let it out, as he groaned to be more then just a cat purring. If being Sally&#39;s new pet from Jeff having his old pet&#39;s life could feel like this, then maybe it was all worth the weirdness!<br />
<br />
By the time it was over that Jeff was taking deep breaths in and out as the Relaxation coursed through his body, even though her hands were starting to come back. soon, a drumbeat-like rhythm was soothing his inner being from out past the far end of himself. Realizing he&#39;d never felt that pleasant rhythm before as he was thinking on what it was, he stared down and try to see it to be no more then a simple blood rush while Sally took notice of the fur slowly reaching up past his neck and growing towards his changing head.<br />
<br />
&quot;you See? You&#39;re starting to get to do things now you could never have attempted to do as a human,&quot; said Sally reassuringly, while gently stroking her fingertips on his furry white chest that made him want to pant faster. &quot;But I thought you&#39;d be more curious about what&#39;s going on with your ears.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reaching up to feel them, Jeff was amazed with the furry ears! over the sides of his face that He had to be careful not to tug the ears out of his skull because they were still in his hands when it happened. He wasn&#39;t quite sure what it was at first because it was so intense as it was so unlike any sensation he recognized from being human, but After a moment&#39;s thought that he managed to narrow down the source of the sensation to his face. He emptied his lungs, closed his eyes in pain as well as a partshale tiger can hope to close it, and deliberately took another breath in through his glistening nostrils while feeling his head cracking into shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master!&quot; Sally said while jumping up and off of the bed to reach toward him, watching Jeff stumble for a moment as though he were going to pass out. even through those new ears of his, Jeff barely heard her as He managed to prop himself up by using a small table for he still appeared to be somewhat dazed while Sally saw the changes on his facewas evident.<br />
<br />
For a second or two, Jeff almost forgot who and where he was while his human brain scrambled to accept some more massive downloads from his new feline nose as his nose started to become more cat like that it was now 20, 30, 40 times more sensitive than what it had before, even more acute than most wild cats will ever have access to for his senses started to intensify. as he could smell everything around him that soon enough, his grew out and slowly extended for his face of the skull cracked and grew out with it. Jeff growled from the pain as he could feel the front of his face extended into a muzzle that his mouth shortly joined the ride for his jaw line grew out and extended along with the nose while he grinned his teeth, yet new ones were growing in when some even grew sharp.<br />
<br />
as he started to open both his eyes and mouth that he roared for Sally could soon see his tongue for it had also extended out with his muzzle too. his muzzle was now complete as his face almost had the look of a tiger that His nose felt so huge at the end of it, too! Sniffing his bed that he was amazed to find it drenched in his old human scent mix in with his new tiger scent already as Sally&#39;s human and dog scents were also in the room, and they both seemed pleasant to his blocky snout.<br />
<br />
Sally looked on as Jeff&#39;s hair on his head started to change into a more blackish color while also mating his fur, leaving him with a soft coat of fur on his head where his hair used to be at. because his eyes had already been locked into a new position that Jeff had trouble keeping his yellow eyes for he had to move his head around a lot to see as soon He looked towards at his temporary master and let out a few playful roars, making eye contact and flinging his tail behind him. with his face now covered in fur as it also covered his muzzle that soon enough, Jeff was standing there from being a teenaged human to a fully transformed humanoid pet of a anthromorphic fearful and powerful tiger.<br />
<br />
Sally looked to him and wondered if he was alright. slowly, she approached him and asked if he was fine. &quot;Jeff...? are you okay...? are you still in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head and began to wonder why everything seems so far off center as he turned to see Sally&#39;s face. as he looked that he was surprised to see all of the colors were, the same as nothing was drained out for he wasn&#39;t seeing thing black and white. With that in mind, Jeff started to wonder now about what other changes she made with the Chronivas as Sally was looking on in delight to his newly formed humanoid tiger body for it looked to hot for her taste that he shortly asked her about the program.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally, this is so unreal. I mean, it&#39;s like this is my own body now. but at the same time, unfamiliar to me for it&#39;s not even my own body. Sally, are there any other options you&#39;ve made to this program here that changed me to this beastly form? or are the changes done to start my new pet life?&quot; he said, yet feeling amused that Sally sighed as she then explained a few more things she did on the program for Jeff&#39;s pet life.<br />
<br />
&quot;w, well Jeff... I did. this was only phase one as phase two&#39;s about to start. I did set the awareness changes to on, so you can still remember you were once human as you&#39;ll also tell that by of your human memories. I also set the mental changes to on as well. which means that everyone around you will only see you as a humanoid pet tiger, but not us for we were just using the program to know what&#39;s going on and who is who. it&#39;s almost like what you had done for me, master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;so... i&#39;m going to be this pet tiger person that is both physically and mentally while remembering being human?&quot; Jeff said, starting to think this through. Fortunately, the machine was already beginning to work on Jeff&#39;s brain too by filling him with a new instinct to quite literally follow his new role in life.<br />
<br />
&quot;that&#39;s the idea... oh, and since I still have most of my dog memories that I will know just what you want in your own pet style life. is that okay with you?&quot; Sally said that Jeff nodded yes to her last minute question.<br />
<br />
Sally gave a small giggle to herself, until she said something to him that Jeff looked to her with a glare after. &quot;uh, don&#39;t worry about it Jeff. this is only temporary. it&#39;s at least until when your family arrives back for us to switch back. so... lets just enjoy our new lives. unless of course, you want us to be able on staying like this for the rest of our life.&quot;<br />
<br />
with more of a glare that his voice started to sound more with a growl as he said back to her. &quot;now let&#39;s not jump into conclusions here young lady. our deal was that we were to return into our old selves, once my family arrives that is. so I do believe that you should wait and see just how well your human body adds up from your previous one. then we&#39;ll see about it later. okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally listened as she understood why he didn&#39;t wanted to jump blindly into these conclusions that she needs to get herself use to this new body of hers, even if these changes were only temporary. if they however don&#39;t like their new looks that they can simply return back to their normal selves and proceed like it didn&#39;t ever happened at all, but it was only up to Jeff by making this decision on if they each want to stay in the forms in a way they are now. so Sally needs to wait on this and see what he says later on after words in each other&#39;s newly formed bodies that she nodded to his question, he had to admit though, there was something pleasant about the way his new pads rubbed on the blankets and his claws pointed in front of him like little compasses.<br />
<br />
as Sally was thinking of this for awhile is when she noticed that the sound of Jeff&#39;s voice seemed somehow off. it sounded a little more rougher then usual before, almost like it was a little more animalistic to him then human. taking a better look that Sally soon spotted his Adam&#39;s apple as she told him, &quot;Jeff, your voice... it&#39;s starting to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff reached up to his throat for he could somehow feel it changing as his vocal cords were shifting, to which those of his speech were slowly changing into a more deeper voice &quot;Sally... you&#39;re right. I can feel it down my throat. it&#39;s weird though, but I might be liking my new voice pretty soon.&quot; he said as his voice kept on getting rougher, and indeed that his voice and speech was getting strange for him while some of the words he said had ether an R sound with them, or a grr sound to it.<br />
<br />
Sally smiled as she said to him, &quot;perhaps a little sooner then you think. it sounds like your words are rougher then before, but at least I set the awareness to on. which means that we can all understand you as you can understand me. at least we&#39;ll be able to get use to what we&#39;re saying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled as he tried to say something by making out a few words, but what was there to say that the only sound he thought of trying right then were to make some roars. &quot;growl! thank you, Sally. I promise that i&#39;ll be your best temporarily pet there is, as as i&#39;m happy to be here with you.&quot; the last of the words were now more of a deeper level of voice as the vocal cords have shifted completely.<br />
<br />
Sally though understand on what he said as she said back, &quot;I know you will be the best pet that&#39;s even out there. i&#39;ll even be more happy to be your best master, temporarily that is.&quot; looking on that Sally could see Jeff was about to say something, when he shortly clenched for his head all of the sudden as he looked like he was in pain.<br />
<br />
Jeff can feel his head shifting around as he growled and cried out, yet Sally looked on as Jeff closed his eyes in pain for she knew the mind was shifting around. Jeff growled even more form the pain as he grinned his teeth that he soon after opened up his mouth to let out a mighty roar as Sally could see his tongue flag out for he was shortly after panting. still though,the changes weren&#39;t over yet as he could feel a migraine of a headache in his brain that what was really happening to him was Jeff&#39;s memories were being pushed in the back of his own mind while his newly feline like instincts were being added in. soon after enough, his life got a hole lot simpler for things like school, a job, driving a vehicle, even marriage were not really important to him at the moment as eating, sleeping, playing, and going to the bathroom like a human were more familiar to him that he was aware while knowing he was still once human and was also being turned into a beastly tiger-man to enjoy what it&#39;s like to be a different species.<br />
<br />
soon enough, the Chronivac dinged as his changes were finally completed that Jeff was panting from the aftermath. He was already looking forward to having his true hands back when this was all over that Jeff shortly after responded to Sally&#39;s question if he was alright by purring with delight and quickly pounced on her naked body, with his cat like feline chest against her breast as he soon nuzzled her face completely. Sally was caught off guard by his strange new behavior and was sure enough surprise by this reaction, but was extremely happy about this to as Jeff was enjoying his start of being her temporarily pet.<br />
<br />
&quot;ha, ha... I guess i&#39;ll take that as a yes then.&quot; Sally said as she laughed about it and soon enough after is when Jeff gently got off of her for she shortly got up and removed a bit of fur off her face. standing there naked in the room side by side together now that the two were soon looking at the mirror as they were amazed at the results of their new bodies for the former pet and master looked on with each of their smiles, before looking up towards at one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;welcome to the other side of the fence, my Jeffy boy. I sure do hope that you enjoy your new life as i&#39;ll have with mine.&quot; Sally said as she soon realized something for she looked to herself in the mirror more while posing like a mannequin model.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... you know... as much on how good I am with this look, I don&#39;t think that humans should be going around naked all the time. let alone during the day.&quot; Sally started to say as she soon turned to see the clothes Jeff discarded on the bed that picking his briefs up, she decided to wear them.<br />
<br />
&quot;well... might as well. time to get dressed, since these are the only clothes that I can think of.&quot; she said as Sally approached the bed and struggled to put on Jeff&#39;s that Jeff looked on to her dressing up for he was surprised on how well she knew to put on clothing to begin with. however, he did gave her human intelligent that she would know by how to do things in which normal people would do and not act like a dog in human skin... even if Jeff knew some people who were into petplay.<br />
<br />
once she was finished on dressing up that she then returned back to the mirror and see on just how she looked for she did indeed was, ridiculous in male clothing. despite it being possibly tight in a few places however, she did managed to work it out while making her look more modes that she even tied the shirt in the middle to show off her mid section and lowered the pants so it was close to her private. she looked a bit like a tomboy with Jeff&#39;s clothes on her that Jeff started to dress himself by placing on his secretive black leather boxers first, followed by his blue korean jeans with torn holes in the legging as he made a hole for his strippy rope of a tiger tail, and a white armless t-shirt.<br />
<br />
looking to themselves, Sally gave a cocky grin and said, &quot;not the best look out there. for now though, at least that it will have to do. unless I take some of your mother&#39;s clothing that i&#39;m gonna have to go out and buy me some outfits I like to wear, while looking like this for now. still though, she&#39;ll be asking about where her stuff went off to. so, until then as i&#39;ll figure something out that let&#39;s just enjoy our day together.<br />
<br />
Sally walked over and gave Jeff&#39;s furry head a rub, while carefully putting a new leather chain collar around the neck of her new tizzy tiger. Jeff purred happily and hugged her closely as he was now ready to start spending his time, as Sally&#39;s temporarily pet. unhugging, Sally soon turned to Jeff and asked in a polite tone on what they should do with their switched lives for she was now the master as Jeff was now nothing more then her pet while flexing his muscles and looking himself out in all his glory before returning to see Sally being his master for the time being. &quot;so... what now?&quot;</p>
