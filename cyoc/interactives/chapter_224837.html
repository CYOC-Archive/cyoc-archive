<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad covered his dick for only a moment as the last of Travis&#39; papers settled around them. But the gravity of the situation fell back onto him in a split moment and he realized that now was not the time for self-consciousness or modesty. He dropped his hands and stepped toward Travis. Despite the situation, Travis had seen Chad naked plenty of times before in the locker room over the past 3 years. He was Chad&#39;s coach, after all. <br />
<br />
Chad gulped, &quot;Coach, listen,&quot; he said, &quot;you gotta believe me.&quot;<br />
<br />
A door opened in the far distance. Travis turned his head for a moment and frowned, not sure who else would be in the athletic building at this time of night, but turned his eyes back toward his athlete. <br />
<br />
&quot;Derrick and I were training late tonight and when we were getting cleaned up in the locker room...&quot;<br />
<br />
Faded footsteps clomped across the wooden floorboards of the gym. Chad didn&#39;t have time to explain the entire situation, and he knew that if he wasn&#39;t quick then the consequences would be dire for both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ryerson, he attacked us!&quot; Chad lied, but he figured that the truth would have been stranger than fiction and he didn&#39;t have time for Travis to question what really happened. &quot;He attacked Derrick and now he&#39;s coming after me. Come on, you gotta believe me Coach, we gotta the fuck out of here!&quot;<br />
<br />
The footsteps increased their pace. Whoever was in the gym was starting to run. <br />
<br />
Travis frowned again, but he knew Chad well enough and respected him as one of his honors US history students and one of his offensive athletes that he didn&#39;t think Chad would lie to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ryerson, right?&quot; Travis asked. &quot;You&#39;re sure it was Ryerson?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s probably coming through the gym now!&quot; Chad whispered, &quot;if we don&#39;t get out of here he&#39;s gonna fuckin&#39; level us. You gotta believe me coach!&quot;<br />
<br />
Travis took two paces back toward the small square glass window situated at the top of the gym door. One of those little grated glass windows that gave people looking out of the gym a small glimpse into the action of whatever game was going on inside. <br />
<br />
His eyes widened. Sure enough, Ryerson, naked as the day he was born, was picking up his pace from a fast walk to a full-on sprint. In his hand left hand he carried his jockstrap. Below his waist he sported a full on erection, pointing up toward the florescent lighting and bouncing like a sword hanging off a knight&#39;s girder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fuck!&quot; Travis whispered. <br />
<br />
Travis threw his right hand onto Chad&#39;s chest, Chad was just out of the line of sight of the window but he knew well enough what Travis was seeing. Travis gently but quickly guided Chad against the wall to the right of the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stay here,&quot; Travis commanded, putting a plan together in his head. &quot;We only have a few seconds.&quot;<br />
<br />
To the left of the door stood a large, heavy table with a couple of trophies from the school&#39;s various state championships. At 31, Travis was still a spitting athlete, having played D1 in college and coached as a graduate student at State. He kept well conditioned even after he moved to a life of academics and coaching. He was also a bit taller than Ryerson at 6&#39;3&quot; and had a noticeably larger amount of cut build on him, unlike Ryerson&#39;s worn, clumpiness of muscle. Needless to say, Travis was both stronger and taller than Ryerson even though Ryerson was probably the heavier of the two. <br />
<br />
Travis very quickly jammed the table against the swinging side of the door and positioned his body against the hinge side of the door. He turned to Chad as he stretched both of his arms and held it against the door handle. &quot;Shh!&quot; he whispered. <br />
<br />
Ryerson was now running at a full pace, each of his large, clomping slams of his naked feet against the wood coming closer and closer and closer. Chad backed his butt against the cold wall adjacent to Travis, held his breath and closed his eyes. &quot;Please work,&quot; he wished to himself. <br />
<br />
SLAM! &quot;DIIINNNNGGG!&quot; The large metal trophy rang out as the door knocked against it. <br />
<br />
A second later, a body fell against the wood floor. The body was still in the gym. <br />
<br />
Chad opened his eyes and turned to Travis who was silently continuing to set his body against the door. A beat later Travis turned his head, the look on his face was noticeably more assured. Ryerson didn&#39;t make it through! He fell right into Travis&#39; trap! The coach had tried to throw his entire body toward the door to have it swing outward to where they were, but between the table, the trophies, and Travis&#39; own weight, he had stopped him!<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that did it,&quot; he whispered. &quot;I think that knocked him out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Travis let his weight go from the door and he and his student peered back through the window. Sure enough, the naked coach lay moaning on the floor, seemingly surprised but mostly out of it by his attempt to sack the men on the other side. <br />
<br />
Travis dragged the table away from the door and stepped into the gym. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Travis said, turning to Chad who followed him in. &quot;Now, tell me what the hell happened between you guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad gulped. He wanted to tell Travis the full truth, but he knew it wouldn&#39;t be long before Ryerson awoke again. So he pointed to the thing that would be the next biggest threat for both for both of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;That thing,&quot; Chad said, pointing down to the jockstrap now unfurling in the outstretched hand of the Coach. &quot;That fuckin thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Travis looked down at the jockstrap and scowled at the streaks of yellow and white cum. A smell began to emanate from it, Travis figured probably from the heat and sweat of the Ryerson&#39;s hand from running. Clutching it was causing the cum to reek a smell off of it.<br />
<br />
The smell was both disgusting and intoxicating, and both of them looked at each other with the most oddly desirable feeling of enticement. &quot;Ryerson&#39;s jockstrap? What is it doing? Why does he, umm,&quot; Travis gulped, feeling woozy, &quot;have it in his hand like that?&quot; Travis asked, staring deeper and deeper into the cloth.<br />
<br />
&quot;We gotta get rid of it now,&quot; Chad answered. &quot;We gotta get it the fuck out of our sight.&quot;</p>
