<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once the show had gotten started Popsy went out into the center ring and welcomed everyone to the show tonight. For their first trick she invited three of their newest clown! Tootsy, Alfie, and Bazzle! The crowd cheered, Bazzle looking around was super excited he was smiling ear to ear.  Tootsy introduced their trick which was a transformation trick. For this they were going to need 3 volunteers one for each of them. Tootsy picked a 12 year old boy Taylor. Alfie picked a. 14 year old named Conner. And Bazzle who had seen his friend Trevor in the audience with his little brother the 13 year old Danny.<br />
On the count of three Tootsy summoned a table with some items on it. These items were random. The clowns had the three boys come up and grab one item. Taylor came up a spiraling horn. Conner grabbed a metal Bolt. And Danny grabbed a blue feather. They each gave their item to their respective clown. Tootsy took the spiraling horn and put pressure on the bottom of it she then placed it on to Taylor’s nose this made it stick to his nose where it wouldn’t fall off. Alfie did the same with Conner’s bolt only he placed it on his forehead. And finally Bazzle took the feather and placed it into Danny’s Hair. I’m unison the three clowns said the magic words! ALACDOO!! As the said this confetti fell from the ceiling distracting the audience as the transformations started. <br />
Taylor reached up to his nose feeling the horn until he felt his nose feeling his skin getting rougher and flakey. His skin continued to flake. Tootsy handed him a mirror. He looked at himself and watch as two more horns started grow out of his forehead. The rough skin turned green. He felt his head start to grow a little bit into that of a  Chameleon. His eyes also grew to match his head. With the flakey green skin growing over the whites of his eyes only leaving his pupils. His hands turned into a Chameleon’s. Taylor also grew a spine of his back along with a long curly tail growing out of his rear. Taylor didn’t even notice his clothes disappear. Where was once a 12 year old boy was now a 12 year old Chameleon boy. <br />
Alfie placed the metal bolt on Conner’s forehead. After the magic words were uttered he felt his head get cold looking down at his hands he noticed them turning to metal all the way down to his feet. Next thing saw was that his body because more and more boxy and robotic. His eyes turned into optics that were able to to zoom in on every person in the circus. His face and head turned into that of a machine’s. With his hands into boxy clamping hands. The normal human boy was now a 5th generation robot. <br />
Bazzle placed The feather into Danny’s hair which immediately started to turn the rest of his hair into blue feathers. His  nose and mouth pushed out until they became a beak. The rest of his head was covered in blue and white feathers. He looked down at his arms and hands which turned in wings. Not noticing his clothes also disappear he looked at his legs which became skinny and black with his feet turning into a birds with three front toes and one back toes. Trevor’s little brother Danny was now a humanoid Blue Jay. <br />
As the confetti settled down the attention was brought back to the center ring with the clowns showing off  had happened with their volunteers. The kids in the crowd cheered fully believing the magic. The adults just clapping along, thinking that they were just all wearing costumes. The clowns told the three boys to please return to their seats. Taylor the 12 year old Chameleon boy in a slower motion walked his way back to his seat next to his mom and twin brother Noah. His large eyes looking in two different directions. An insect flew by him when in a *snap* his mouth opened and his tong shot out and grabbed it. Conner noisily stomped over and sat down next to his friends Liam, Mason, and his girlfriend Ava waiting for his next directive. Danny skipped along similar to a bird back over to his older brother he ended up squatting on his seat with his hands or wings folded back. Bazzle, Alfie, and Tootsy all gathered back together and took their final bows. Popsy came back out and announced how this was the end of the show m. She went on to announce that say you finall out of the tent our circus clowns will be at face painting stations for anyone looking for a new outlook on life. She ended it with and remember folks what happens in the park says in the park. <br />
The three young clowns made their way back to Clown Alley after the performing a couple more changes at the face painting booths. Arriving their Barry took off his clown nose starting to return to normal. Barry had a question, What was going to happen to the kids that we changed now? Would they be changed forever? Tiffany answered him saying, “oh?! No No No, as soon as anyone who’s whole body’s have been changed leave the park the original person reappears underneath the change. She went on to say that if someone who has already had a full body change if they return to the park. They will change into a newer version of that same change. As she was telling this to Barry.</p>
