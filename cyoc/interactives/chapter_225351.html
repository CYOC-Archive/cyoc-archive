<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On the far off planet, Quelaria, in the heart of the citadel, a blonde haired man pleads with a group of politicians all seated in a semicircle.<br />
The council members, all dressed in identical grey alien looking robes, listen disinterestedly to the man’s words.<br />
<br />
“And what proof do you have of these theories Raull-Sorr?” The council demanded.<br />
<br />
“General Renn-Hel has launched a full scale civil war and you mean to distract us with small Quelariaquakes and solar flares?” They continued.<br />
<br />
“High councilor Gel-Kan, these quakes will shift the poles and when the flares—“ Raull-Sorr was cut off by another councilor.<br />
<br />
“Flares? Quelaria sees a hundred solar flares a week, another one is of no concern!” Councilwoman Sera-Sorr Vel interrupted.<br />
<br />
Raull-Sorr was saddened to hear his sister-in-law dismiss him so harshly. She did not share the same scientific mind as her sister and now the council would doom all of Quelaria.<br />
Before he could correct her a blast blew open the grand black doors, knocking him to the ground and soldiers wearing black and silver armor came rushing through. At their head was a similarly dressed man with gold instead of silver. The figure removed the menacing black helmet to reveal a man with slicked black hair and sharp looking goatee.<br />
<br />
“High Council. It is time for you to release your oppressive boot from the people of Quelaria!” He shouted with a booming and commanding voice.<br />
<br />
“Renn, stop this madness! There’s no time!” The blonde man said from the floor.<br />
<br />
The general turned to Raull-Sorr and his expression lightened very slightly, and he reached for the scientist.<br />
<br />
“Raull, my friend, I suppose you are here to beg the council for action regarding your theory but only received inaction and contempt. Join me, together we will put an end to their tyranny. When I establish a new order I promise we will immediately look into your findings.” The black haired man explained.<br />
<br />
Raull-Sorr brushed the offered hand away and got up himself,<br />
<br />
“There’s no time!” He shouted.<br />
<br />
Renn-Hel withdrew his hand and turned to look at the high council then back at his friend.<br />
<br />
“No time? There is no time for their lies and corruption! Every breath they take is a waste of time! Every inaction! Every deception! Every life they take by defying me!” He exclaimed with vigor and passion.<br />
<br />
Renn-Hel’s soldiers took aim at the high council, the general stepped up the black ramp that led to the council’s circular podium.<br />
<br />
“Even Sera-Sorr Vel, your own family, refuses to listen, to take action! She has been corrupted like all the others!” He said and pointed his sidearm at her.<br />
<br />
“Renn! Stop this madness, we are all doomed if we continue to fight each other.” Raull-Sorr cautioned and put his hand on the armored man’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Renn-Hel looked over at the blonde man, not taking his gun off the man’s sister-in-law.<br />
<br />
“Really? You would protect them?” The general said quietly.<br />
<br />
“Don’t do this Renn, we’re out of time.” Raull-Sorr replied.<br />
<br />
Renn-Sorr turned his head back to the councilwoman and before anyone could react the had swung his pistol at Raull-Sorr, throwing him down the ram. Then the soldiers opened fire and great tremor shook the citadel, sending chunks of the building crashing down. <br />
Raull-Sorr had no time to deal with Renn-Hel, he needed to get back to his lab, to his wife. It was too late for them, for everyone.<br />
<br />
Raull-Sorr ran trough the crumbling and shaking streets of the capitol, everywhere people were screaming and fires raged. He had to ignore them, the only hope for them or their people was waiting for him at his lab.<br />
The man used rubble to climb up a building and onto a passing troop transport, He quickly used his military training to dispatch the soldiers and commandeered the vehicle and flew towards the lab.<br />
<br />
He crashed the ship in the entry bridge to slow down any pursuers and rushed to embrace his wife. She had stunning blue eyes and brown hair, in her arms was their people’s last hope; their daughter: Kella-Sorr. The baby had her mother’s eyes and hints of thin locks showed she shared her father’s blonde hair.<br />
<br />
“What happened?! I saw the citadel collapse!” She asked as they made their way into the launch dome.<br />
<br />
“Renn-Hel, he attacked the high council.” He answered.<br />
<br />
“What did they say? Did my sister?” She asked.<br />
<br />
Raull-Sorr said nothing but his face told her everything she needed to know.<br />
<br />
She pushed away her grief as Raull-Sorr and Kell-Sorr finished preparing the small spacecraft for launch. Their planet was on the brink of destruction and their only hope was their daughter: Kella-Sorr. They were saddened that they could not join their daughter but there was no time to build another ship, they had chosen Sol-3 as her destination due to it’s proximity to a young, yellow star and it’s host of intelligent species. They knew their daughter would be different there, but she would also be strong and one day they hoped she could inspire them to greatness.<br />
With a kiss and final goodbyes from her parents they settled her into the capsule and hit the ignition sequence.<br />
<br />
As the ship’s engines warmed up a crash broke through the wall and General Hel was standing with his troops.<br />
<br />
“You will not defy me Raull-Sorr. The council and all those who supported and protected them will die. I didn’t want it to end like this.” The armored man said.<br />
<br />
“None of that matters Renn, we’ll all be dead when the next solar flare hits! Don’t you see? Your war has doomed Quelaria!” He shouted, hoping to buy enough time for the rocket to launch.<br />
<br />
“Your theory? That’s what this has been about, you need to be right! Because then everyone will look up from their idiocy and squaller and see the brilliant Doctor Raull-Sorr! You so better than us aren’t you?!” The black haired man shouted back in mania.<br />
<br />
“It doesn’t matter anymore, none of this matters. We’ll all be dead when the next solar flare hits!” Raull-Sorr replied solemnly.<br />
<br />
Then one of the holo computers started coming to life and the distraction was ruined.<br />
<br />
“The ignition coil is damaged we can’t launch.” Kell-Sorr said.<br />
<br />
“What is this? Are you trying to escape me? You know you cannot stop me.” The general said.<br />
<br />
He ordered the soldiers to fire but Raull-Sorr was quicker and shot the gun he’d been hiding behind his back, igniting the plasma fuel and causing the rocket to explode and shoot towards the atmosphere. <br />
When the dust had settled Raull-Sorr was clutching his wife, she’d been impaled by flying debris and was bleeding.<br />
Renn-Hel got up after the explosion and the left side of his face was burned, he laughed maniacally.<br />
<br />
“You think this will stop me? Your plan failed! Now you will die!” He laughed.<br />
<br />
“No Renn. Kell and I will live on. Through our daughter.” He said defiantly.<br />
<br />
The armored man’s face contorted in anger and he brought up his communicator,<br />
<br />
“Sylas 13-13 take down that rocket!” He ordered.<br />
<br />
“You’re too late, she’s safe now, the space warp drive will carry her far beyond this place, beyond your reach.” The blonde said laying his dead wife.<br />
<br />
Renn-Hel’s good eye twitched and her shot his former friend. He turned to leave the lab,<br />
<br />
“Erian 12-1, track that last warp signal! I want the space warp drive ready before the next solar flare!” He barked into his communicator.<br />
<br />
“It’s not ready, a warp engine can’t move something that size yet, it would take 25 years to reach the other warp signal.” The engineer explained.<br />
<br />
“Just do it. The daughter of Raull-Sorr will not escape my wrath, no matter how long it takes.” He stated before heading to the ship.<br />
<br />
Even if they couldn’t get to her for 25 years, he would find her.<br />
<br />
—-<br />
<br />
The small ship exited warp space and entered earth’s atmosphere, it burned as it approached the surface before landing with a small crater. Nearby a couple would stumble across it, finding a helpless baby girl inside they decide to hide the space craft and adopt the mysterious infant as their own, naming her: Kelly.</p>
