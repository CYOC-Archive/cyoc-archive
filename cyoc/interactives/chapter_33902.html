<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>Unknowing of what to do, Brandon stands there before his werewolf step-father, almost ready to piss his pants. Brandon began to turn around to run away and escape his step-father, when he was stopped short by a pair of stronger hands than Brandon's entire body. When he was forcefully spun back around, his head was clenched under his jaw, making it impossible for him to make any sort of movement.</br>
<br>Brandon heard a low growl come from Rick's throat, turning into a laugh. Brandon watched as the wolven lips furled and contorted into what he would consider as a smile.</br>
<br>"Ahh... how good it is to have complete dominance finally over you Brandon! You have pained me for so long and now I have total control over you, but now I must stand and ask myself one thing... what shall I do with you now?" His voice was strong and extremely deep, something that Brandon never thought was even possible.</br>
<br>Stuttering, Brandon struggled to get an answer out while being as scared as he was at that moment. "You... you could... l... let me... gg... go an... and no... not ki... ll kill ma... me."</br>
<br>Rick chuckled a bit while he thought about Brandon's answer. "I would not kill you Brandon because that would make me look like a real bad father. I am going to put you down, on your own two feet and I want you to talk with me. If I even get the hint that you are going to run, I will show my dominance over you again. Do you understand?"</br>
<br>Looking directly into Rick's eyes, Brandon found the strength within himself not to stutter and answer him like normal. "Yes I understand Rick."</br>
<br>Rick's lips curled into a smile and he set Brandon back on the floor beneath him. After Rick released Brandon's jaw, he waited to see what Brandon would do and found that Brandon stood there as he said he would.</br>
<br>"Before you do whatever it is that you want, I would like to know what you meant by killing me, that would make you a bad father? You know as well as I do that you aren't my real father."</br>
<br>"That is what I wanted to talk to you about Brandon, I am your father. You see, your mother and I have had an on and off relationship, but we just didn't allow you to see that. Even before you were born we were like that. So, because of this, your mother made me swear that I would never tell you about being your real father."</br>
<br>"Alright, I am a bit confused though... why are you telling me this now?"</br>
<br>"Well... this was another thing I was going to tell you before I inhaled the fumes downstairs and changed into what you see before you now. Your mother decided that this life was too much for her, as she had always been a free spirit. She felt tied down more than she was comfortable being with my work in genetic engineering taking up lots of time away from her and you, along with all the things that go along in running a house filled with busy people.”</br>
<br>“So you have inhaled these fumes before and changed into a werewolf in front of her?”</br>
<br>“Yep and now that she is gone and out of my way, I thought it was time to make up another concoction of what I would call Eau De Werewolf. Not to mention, I have wanted to return to this form for so long, but in fear of losing your mother, I refrained.”</br>
<br>“Are there any side effects?”</br>
<br>“Just one, if you aren‘t gay before you wear the cologne, you turn gay.”</br>
<br>“Really… just like that huh?”</br>
<br>“Indeed, but I don‘t know if you could even consider being gay to be a side effect. The first time I inhaled this stuff, I felt new and invigorated. Then, I realized that I was very horny and went to watch a porno, but I found myself watching the guys. I wondered what it would be like to have a cock in my mouth and do some of the things women do to us guys.”</br>
<br>“Did you go out and find a guy dad?”</br>
<br>“Oh boy did I ever. I grabbed some of the werewolf spray and went to the local park where I found a muscle bound guy sitting on the bench. I sprayed him and when he felt the liquid on the nape of his neck, he turned around to beat my ass, but stopped in total shock and fear. His fear quickly turned to lust and he transformed as soon as his lust consumed him. He had an extremely thick cock that he pulled out right away and then pointed for me to suck it. I will tell you what, I have never felt anything like that in my life and that‘s when I found that I liked cock.”</br>
<br>“That‘s a hot story dad! What do you want to do with me?”</br>
<br>“Well… I was thinking that you could voluntarily inhale the fumes or I could force you. I want to start a werewolf pack and then go from there.”</br>
<br>“Well… I have always been curious about werewolves, what it would feel like being one, transforming and all that, so I will breathe them in on my own.”</br>
<br>Rick smiled his wolfish smile, then started downstairs with Brandon right in front of him, ensuring that Brandon would inhale the fumes and not try to escape. As they reached the door to the basement where it all happened, Brandon could smell a sweet fragrance in the air and took a deep breath through his nose. Taking in the smell, Brandon immediately began to feel different, and he ran down the stairs to take in more of the fumes. Rick smiled, knowing that he was about to have two things. His first pack mate and a gay companion of his own.</br></p>
