<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a mostly normal weekend at the house of Ty&#39;s step-family. June was preparing for dinner in the kitchen, Mark was just watching TV while having a beer, and Dustin was with his girlfriend... well girl friend in this reality... Ok she was tutoring him in math and just thought he was a little cute in this reality. <br />
Mark was grumpy as he thought he heard some scurrying behind the wall and said &quot;June! I think we may need to get an exterminator.&quot; June sighed wondering why they adopted a step-child in this economy. <br />
June got the stew boiling and got out of the kitchen and said &quot;We&#39;re going to need to tighten the purse strings again then.&quot; At this point it was getting harder and harder to skimp on things for Ty... They&#39;d need to start skimping on their budget soon... Maybe they could find a way to get rid of Ty, because that was what they needed right now... another mouth to feed and body to clothe. Then Ty had his orgasm, and turns out the Ejaculation Force could move a few miles in a few seconds. They for sure were within the initial blast zone as the house&#39;s infrastructure was incredibly shaken as a lot of damage was done, and everyone in the house had to brace for impact. <br />
June was on the kitchen floor thankful the stew pot and the boiling slop had missed her... What the heck had hit? An earthquake?!? June tried to get herself up, but she started to find it hard and then... Was that a kick in her stomach? The blast had put her in shock, but as she looked down she saw that her dress had seemed to lift up to accommodate her expanding abdomen. Her sagging breasts refilling with milk, and when June felt her water breaking she cursed and removed her panties as she delivered. This time though it was a lot easier than with Dustin, and the umbilical cord undid itself. June sighed in relief unsure what she&#39;d do with this big and seemingly healthy baby girl... She had always wanted a girl an- June felt something weird in her abdomen again and as she looked down there were her swelling breasts leaking milk through her bra and dress, then there was her new baby that she&#39;d need to think of a name for, and there was another bun in the oven... Said bun was fast rising, and in a few seconds out came a baby boy. She was absolutely terrified when her abdomen started inflating again as she was going to be having triplets soon. <br />
A voice came out from the living room where Mark was, but the voice was that of a woman &quot;June! Are you Ok?!?&quot; June set her two newborns on the ground, and waddled out of the kitchen as she was fast approaching the 9th month of pregnancy for the third time this few minutes. She saw a woman in  Mark&#39;s clothes besides his pants and underwear, large breasts having burst out of his button top and leaking breast milk, and there was a baby on the couch besides her. She could also see a baby crowning as the woman moaned a bit and she said &quot;June, you&#39;re not going to believe me but this is probably worse than it seems.&quot; <br />
June moaned a bit as she squatted and let her third child slip out of her vagina and said &quot;How?!? This is insanity, and we&#39;ve got five more mouths to feed!&quot; There seemed to be moaning in the walls behind this woman Mark &quot;Wait... what...&quot;<br />
Mark breathing heavily said &quot;By our stomachs I&#39;d say we have at least 7 more mouths to feed soon, and the rats turned into women as well... trapped on the other side of the wall and giving birth as fast as we are. Even if we assume- ugh,&quot; Mark moaned as she let another baby out and onto the couch as two of her previous kids had started suckling on the engorged breasts. <br />
June continued &quot;We&#39;re probably going to have a lot of corpses in our wall aren&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Upstairs Dustin was regretting wishing &quot;To have a baby with his girlfriend.&quot; There he was with his girlfriend pumping out babies as a girl his own age... Giving birth was less painful than he thought, but her large engorged breasts and multiple babies as a 13 year old was very concerning. That annoying fly had also turned into a woman, fell on the ground, and started giving birth as well. All three had no shame in being basically naked in front of one another. They were all women with similar breasts, and in a way giving birth together had given a weird bond... if only the fly actually knew english they may have been able to pick up a conversation while the pile of babies kept growing. The specialness of human life and birth was kinda lost when it was happening on mass faster than any of them could come up with names.</p>
