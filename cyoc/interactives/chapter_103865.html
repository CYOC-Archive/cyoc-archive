<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Thanks for all you help,&quot; Amy said to Tad as they stood outside her front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just trying to be there for you,&quot; Tad smiled, &quot;since you&#39;ve been so good to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded and kissed Tad&#39;s cheek again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a good night,&quot; Amy said to him, &quot;I wish we might be able to do something more fun... but with my parents being worried about my brothers, I&#39;m afraid it wouldn&#39;t be appropriate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay,&quot; Tad assured her, &quot;Maybe we can hang out tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if not that... then at least at school on Monday,&quot; Amy told him and walked in while Tad began to walk back towards his own home.<br />
<br />
Amy entered to find her father seated nervously between her brothers on the couch watching a college football game. Though, Amy noted that none of them looked particularly interested in the game. Her brothers, Jay and Leon looked a bit nervous combined with some excitement, which was understandable. She remembered growing up and seeing her parents in their were forms, and when she began to go from little kid to young lady, she was eagerly waiting for the day when she would transform for the first time. Even though she was surprised when that moment came, she had been looking forward to it. She simply didn&#39;t know that her transformation would come as early as it did. The nervousness she also recognized as something that was likely a result of their being there for Amy&#39;s own surprise first transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s winning?&quot; Amy asked to her dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oregon,&quot; Gary said slowly, &quot;though... this is mostly just something to buy time while we&#39;re waiting...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy listened as her father&#39;s voice tailed off at the end. He was probably even more nervous than her brothers were or she was, as Amy was sure her father wouldn&#39;t want his sons to go through what she had gone through in her own first transformation. There was also the knowledge that most of her brother&#39;s friends were only thirteen and likely hadn&#39;t transformed yet, and not all of them were even werewolves even if they had transformed. It meant that her brothers did get the company of someone else to ease their first transformation, it would have to be someone older than them. She wanted to mention what Tad had suggested and commented on, such as providing comfort if Jay and Leon are to transform on their own or seeing if a were from another species might be available to give her brothers the &quot;comfort&quot; to get through their first transformation and let her parents give them the specific instruction on what it meant to be a werewolf afterward. <br />
<br />
Amy opened her lips to speak but then closed them. She wanted to tell her dad, but she didn&#39;t want to increase her brother&#39;s nervousness on the issue. After all, they weren&#39;t one hundred percent sure and they might not actually transform tonight. Tad&#39;s ideas could help, but Amy realized they were still ideas that would better used in advance of her brother&#39;s transformation. Leaving her father and brothers to the football game, Amy walked into the kitchen where she found her mother, Elizabeth Howler, already working on what would likely be dinner. It wasn&#39;t that late in the afternoon, but Amy had noticed that cooking had commonly been something of a stress release activity for her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;No luck, mom?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No luck...&quot; Elizabeth Howler said with a heavy sigh, &quot;none of Leon&#39;s and Jay&#39;s classmates have had their first transformations... which makes things difficult. We&#39;ve asked around with some of the other pack members that might be able to help... but since Jay and Leon haven&#39;t been having the sort of nightmares or other odd dreams that seem to go with the awakening of the wolf within them... they think we&#39;re just getting nervous at nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was news to Amy, but it might mean that her brothers might not transform early. She had remembered having several odd dreams of that nature before her first transformation, but hadn&#39;t told her parents about this out of embarrassment. That might give them time to get things ready and put together for when their first transformation came, which would let some of Tad&#39;s ideas be prepared if they were to be used.<br />
<br />
&quot;And maybe we are a bit nervous,&quot; Amy spoke, &quot;I mean... needlessly nervous. I had had the sort of dreams that would indicate I was getting ready to change during the nights before it happened. And you know I was too embarrassed to say anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if it comes without those dreams?&quot; Elizabeth said quickly, &quot;and how do we adapt to this when it happens? Your brothers haven&#39;t shown any interest in boys or girls. We don&#39;t know who they&#39;d prefer...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy watched as her mother bent into the oven to place a ham inside it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gary and I asked... and they couldn&#39;t see any benefit in either,&quot; Elizabeth answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... maybe they aren&#39;t approaching their first transformation,&quot; Amy commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if we&#39;re wrong?&quot; Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then maybe we should do what Tad&#39;s dad did for him,&quot; Amy commented, remembering what Tad had told her about his first transformation, &quot;we walk them out into the woods and given comfort... talk to them... assure them that things will be fine. I might even be able to share somethings regarding my transformation... in the sense of letting them know that they will be okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your boyfriend?&quot; Amy blinked, &quot;what would he know about this sort of situation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He did grow up with the only weres he knew being his mother and father,&quot; Amy answered, &quot;and he told me he didn&#39;t have sex with either of them... and given our... first time at his welcome to the pack, I&#39;d believe him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth raised an eyebrow at that. She knew that Amy had been sexually active since her first transformation, nothing super frequent, but still well within the ranges to be expected from any were in Moon Lake, just as she knew that she and Gary would enjoy their own private fun as much as the possibly could as well. However, neither Elizabeth nor Amy had ever talked to each other about their sexual engagements.<br />
<br />
&quot;His dad and mom helped him through his first transformation,&quot; Amy spoke, &quot;and if need be... we can talk Leon and Jay through it without there being any sex, and they will be okay. Tad might be able to even give you and dad some help with examples of what to say to help them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Elizabeth commented then gazed out at the wall behind her daughter. <br />
<br />
She and Gary weren&#39;t about to let their sons be in a position where if it did come to sex that they wouldn&#39;t have sex with each other. She wouldn&#39;t mind if they were gay, but she wasn&#39;t going to let them have sex with each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;And he came out okay?&quot; Elizabeth asked to Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, mom,&quot; Amy said with a nod, &quot;He did. And he&#39;s willing to help if you and dad want it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy watched as her mother began to pace about the kitchen to think over the suggestion. She hoped her mother wasn&#39;t too mad, as the issue was a family one, but she didn&#39;t think Tad was the sort of person who wouldn&#39;t be polite and respectful about the privacy of the issue. The fact that he also volunteered to help showed that he was also caring. After a few moments, while her mother continued to think over the comment, Amy walked over to the fridge and picked out a Coke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to talk to your father privately about this,&quot; Elizabeth said slowly, &quot;See what he thinks on the issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded while popping the tab on the can of soda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he have any other suggestions to help?&quot; Elizabeth asked carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... if you and dad have a hard time arranging for a there to be a werewolf for Leon and Jay&#39;s transformation,&quot; Amy spoke, &quot;he made mention of seeing if other weres might be available to help. I mean, since Leon and Jay were born werewolves, nothing can changer their species... and all they really need about werewolves will relate to their specific instincts as werewolves, which in theory you and mom can do after whatever partner you and dad find to help Jay and Leon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might take a little bit of effort to convince your father,&quot; Elizabeth commented, &quot;but if he does agree to letting Tad help Gary and I set things up to make sure that our sons don&#39;t go through a painful and startled transformation and your first transformation was... it might be something that could be discussed.&quot;</p>
