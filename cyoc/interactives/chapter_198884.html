<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>David is 18 years old with no siblings in this thread and these changes are to be considered retroactively applied through previous chapters (on this thread only of course). </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That night David was asleep in his pen at home. The family had signed his life away to his own mother and then took even more of his lifespan by transferring him into a raccoon. He was nothing more than a common pest and yet his parents slept peacefully through the injustice.<br />
<br />
One man could not sit idly by. His name was Roger and he was a lead technician at the facility where David had been swapped. He knew there was still an option to restore David to his original body, even though it would trap Cathy in the raccoon body. He just felt that their 18 year old son deserved his full life ahead of him, knowing that David didn’t want to go through with the swap.<br />
<br />
Roger snuck into their home that night and injected one set of nanobots into the sleeping raccoon that was David and another set into the sleeping teenage boy body that contained Cathy. By the time they woke up tomorrow morning, their consciousnesses would swap with one another. This was an alternative that Cathy had made sure the facility would neglect to mention. Roger successfully snuck back out without being caught by David’s dad.<br />
<br />
Cathy awoke, expecting the triumphant feeling of another stolen day of her poor son’s life. Instead she was greeted with bars..like a prison. She was in a cat carrier! She screeched and looked down at her monstrous little hands.<br />
<br />
“No, this can’t be happening!” She tried to say. It all came out as little screeches.<br />
<br />
Suddenly David came into the room. He saw his mom in the carrier and smirked wildly, figuring out that they must have swapped last night. Interestingly, nobody else in the family knew that this happened, and Cathy couldn’t say fuckall about it as a raccoon. That meant that David could pretend to be his mom in his body. It was subtly different to just being David again.<br />
<br />
David left the kitchen and came back in a minute from the laundry room. He had swapped the boxer briefs he was wearing for a pair of his mom’s silk panties. Seeing as his mom’s original body no longer existed, she wouldn’t be needing them. It was very early in the morning yet, so the first person that would see David would be his dad.<br />
<br />
Cathy screeched in protest, seeing the revenge that David had planned. David merely put on some low music to drown out her only form of protest. To add insult to injury, David’s teenage boy body looked sexier in those panties than his mom’s out of shape woman body ever did. His package generously filled out the whole front and his small bubble butt with a light dusting of hair was pushing the back to its limits. It never would have occurred to Cathy to wear those, had she still been the one in David’s body. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t long before David’s dad Jacob came into the kitchen to start getting up and at’em  for the day. He was in nothing but a robe that wasn’t tied shut. “Huba huba,” thought David, seeing his dad’s large member flop around. Jacob was an office worker and former construction worker. He had big beefy biceps, but years in an office setting had plastered a lot of pudge onto the sexy man. He had dark fur all over his body, a beer belly, a balding salt a pepper head with a full white beard and mustache.<br />
<br />
“Are those your mother’s panties??” Asked Jacob in surprise.<br />
<br />
“Oh sorry,” said David, “I guess I’m not used to being a boy yet. You know, I still feel like I have womanly needs and a husband to fulfill them.” He rubbed his penis and bussy through the silk while giving his dad a ‘fuck me’ look.<br />
<br />
“Honey..I thought we agreed that once you were in David’s body, our relationship was over..” said Jacob in a low purr. David could tell that his horny old dad was considering it.<br />
<br />
“That was before my former body died. Now you have no one to be your wife. But there’s nothing wrong with the body I have here,” said David, continuing to pretend to be his mom in his body.<br />
<br />
“It’s just not what you’re used to. But believe me, this body is soft and supple and young. And besides...it has several new attractions,” David said, grabbing his dad’s hand and putting it on his silk covered privates.  <br />
<br />
Cathy screeched and screeched but her husband could neither hear nor understand her. Jacob had forgotten that they even put “Cathy” the raccoon in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Jacob caressed his son’s privates, giving them soft squeezes through the silk and feeling the shape of David’s penis. A day ago Jacob had a wife. Today, he thought he had a wife in a son’s body. It was sexually intriguing that he was being given permission to explore his son’s body. He took his other hand to David’s behind and cupped it right up the middle.<br />
<br />
David stared at his dad’s growing penis in his robe. The fact that he was turning on his forty year old dad with his own male body was sending David through loops of pleasure. 5:21am, still plenty of time to take dad’s cock before he has to go to work. Luckily, David had already brought a bottle of lube to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Maybe just fuck me one time? Pleeease?” Said David, giving his dad puppy dog eyes.<br />
<br />
“One fuck for my boy,” said Jacob, stroking his beard and getting turned the fuck on by his son’s fit slender smooth body.<br />
<br />
David lubed his dad’s cock and his dad stripped him of his panties and pressed the head of his cock to David’s hole. David focused on letting Jacob’s thick cock in. It slipped in by sheer force of David wanting his santa claus esque father’s cock inside of him. He felt his dad’s big fat belly up on his backside as Jacob was 7inches in. David was in heaven. Best part was he knew his horrible mother would see all of this and know that he ended up with everything. The younger body, and even the husband.<br />
<br />
Jacob was fucking his son’s boy pussy with more gusto than he had ever done Cathy’s clam. David moaned gayly, not giving a fuck about how he was being interpreted while he was getting the ride of his life from his unwitting father.<br />
<br />
David tried to jerk himself off while his dad was in him but his dad swiped his hands away, wanting to make David’s body cum by anal stimulation alone. Jacob wanted every part of his son’s body to submit to him. He started making out with David, forcing his tongue into David’s mouth. David was in heaven with his dad’s cock forcing its way in and out in unison with his tongue.<br />
<br />
David felt his dad’s hot load start to shoot up his butt. That sensation plus the look on his mature dad’s face put David over the edge. He came hand’s free to his dad’s great satisfaction. The cum got everywhere, some on Jacob’s mouth. His tongue came out and he sampled his own son’s cum. “Yum,” he said.<br />
<br />
Cathy downright had a heart attack. She had lost everything. The young male body she wanted to steal for her own, her husband. Even her original body was ashes now. She couldn’t handle the stress in this wild raccoon’s body. Cathy was no more.</p>
