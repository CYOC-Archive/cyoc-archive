<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he considered his options, the sound of rainfall reached him.  Turning to face the window, Dustin noticed that the clouds that had been heading this way were now here, and really letting loose.  Risking a look outside, he noticed that just looking to the end of the street was difficult, even with his sharper eyesight, and given just how thick and dark the clouds were right now, he was under no illusion that this was going to remain for some time to come.  <br />
<br />
That was when something major did reach him, even though the sheets of rains, the sight of a tiger standing on two legs running down the street, whoever he or she was, and from where he couldn’t work out given that (s)he was already past his sight now, what it did tell him was that he was likely not the only one who’d received such a package in the post today.  <br />
<br />
In any case with this weather now, the roads would almost certainly be quiet, and he could count on his new vision to keep him safe enough as he made the choice to drive.  Heading back down the stairs, Dustin was quick to grab both the car keys and the box that the many vials came in, and especially the Orca Serum for later if he so wished - and he did.  He took his overcoat as well (just in case) though his work utility belt that he’d put on was enough to hold the most essentials in as he braved the rains for the short hop to where his car waited.  <br />
<br />
Getting it open was easy enough, the real challenge lay in that when he tried to sit down, his tail and fluke meant that he simply couldn’t while the backrest was up.  But that was an easy enough fix.  A little work and the headrest was off which allowed the backrest to be lowered all the way so it was effectively flush-fit with the rear seats.  Before actually getting in again though, he paused to consider something before heading back to the garden to pick up a heavy slab.  A quick test showed that it could hold down the gas pedal with ease, and being an automatic station-wagon, that was enough to convince him that it would be safe enough to take the rest en-route.  He also grabbed a length of rope, finding a good fixing point between the steering wheel and the driver’s seat which would negate his need to actually drive for the last part if he was feeling particularly “adventurous”.  Now that Dustin was ready, he slid in himself, noting that while not completely comfortable, it would be manageable enough for the duration.  The engine ignited, he slid it into Drive before slipping out of the driveway and onto bold new things.  <br />
<br />
The first fifteen minutes were uneventful enough - though he did see a gator in a trench coat as he drove - and he soon began to grow bored.  To help pass the time, he adjusted the rear-view mirror - near-useless for its purpose at this time - to give himself a good look at his face, and when he shifted a little he could see his dorsal fin, long and straight as was the case for males of the species, as opposed to the sweptback look that females had.  Dustin decided now was a good time to see what the radio stations had, but the only one that was broadcasting clearly was the rolling news:  <br />
<br />
“Good afternoon all!  And what a day it is!  If you’re at the beach, then forget it!  The Tide’s right the way out, and in this rain, you wouldn’t be able to enjoy it anyway…”  <br />
<br />
Dustin stopped really listening as he digested this piece of news.  Based on that report, it would likely be deserted at this time, with a longish drive of maybe ten minutes or so from the start to the waterline.  He couldn’t really explain it, but there was something at the back of his mind, making him want to take the rest of the Orca Serum that sat in the passenger seat.  But for now, he knew better than to take it all at once, not until he was closer anyway.  <br />
<br />
“And some very weird news is just in, apparently in…”  Turning off the radio, Dustin elected to finish the drive in peace.  <br />
<br />
The drive itself was starting to become uncomfortable - the limited room for his tail being one reason, and his larger overall size the other - but Dustin was eventually rewarded with the sight of the approaching beach, easily enough room to slip the car onto the sands where he stopped the car before slipping the handbrake on.  <br />
<br />
As he’d heard the Beach right now was deserted, he must have been the only one in the area.  Even with clear skies, the ocean wouldn’t be visible at its current low ebb, so it was no surprise that he didn’t see it at all through these driving rains.  But right now, he had a bit of work to do, a few simple loops had the steering wheel pinned into place using the driver’s seat and the front doors as attachment points, and the stone slab was ready to be lowered into place.  Now he had the Orca Serum in his black-and-white hand, peering at its contents.  <br />
<br />
He could chug the lot down now and gamble on making it in time, or a little later when he could be sure of making it with time to spare.  Then again, he could leave it alone and stay as he was when he dived into the ocean.  Or perhaps stay on the beach for a while first?  He was alone after all, and he could have some personal “fun” with no-one around to see him, the idea of beating off on the beach or on the move aiding in the rising of his thick shaft as he felt it throb.  Then again, he didn&#39;t need to drink it all at once, right?  He could take it in sips here and there, and let himself change a bit at a time.  That way at least, he could stop before it was too late and wind up beaching himself.  <br />
<br />
