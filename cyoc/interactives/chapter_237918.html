<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After karaoke and dancing at the bar, Andromeda and Nyx had to get back before their aunt and uncle suspected anything was up. But Chase had another idea that the four of them could do at night, they were going to roast marshmallows and have some drinks. Chase was surprised when Andromeda offered to bring drinks for them. This surprised Nyx too as she didn&#39;t think her sister would be so well prepared for her boyfriend&#39;s plan, but obviously their two love bird minds were thinking alike.<br />
<br />
Chase and Aaron were gathering marshmallows and roasting sticks for their campfire when Nina came into the kitchen and saw them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now, are you boys getting ready for a little marshmallow roast?&quot; Nina asked them with a smile on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, mom, Aaron and I just wanted a little guys night roasting some good marshmallows tonight.&quot; Chase explained telling his mother as he lied only a little bit about their planned roast.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I hope you two have fun with your little roast. Oh, before I forget, Chase, Caleb wanted to talk with you earlier when you were gone. He&#39;s gone to talk with Gloria about their high school reunion. But I think he might have wanted to apologize to you.&quot; Nina informed her youngest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, thanks mom. I&#39;ll...I&#39;ll talk with him when I can.&quot; Chase said as he got ready to go out the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chase, promise me you&#39;ll talk with your brother and have it end peacefully.&quot; Nina asked her son.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise mom. I&#39;ll talk with Chase and...and I&#39;ll listen to what he has to say.&quot; Chase said looking at his mother in the eye and nodded.<br />
<br />
****************************************<br />
<br />
Chase and Aaron went back to the spot in the forest they had met the girls earlier and waited for them to arrive as they set up their campfire. They didn&#39;t have to wait long as Andromeda and Nyx soon arrived only 10 minutes after they arrived and Chase had gotten a fire going for the four of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, are you girls ready to roast some marshmallows?&quot; Chase asked handing them two roasting sticks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just one question: what are we doing with these again?&quot; Andromeda asked the boys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you two never been camping before in the woods?&quot; Aaron now asked the girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;We mostly trained for survival in the woods, and....some of us had bad experiences.&quot; Nyx explained as she and Andromeda looked down and Aaron almost felt bad for asking Nyx now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I promise you both this is going to be great fun. We just...&quot; Chase now got two big logs for the two of them to sit on that happened to be nearby. &quot;....need a few good seats in front of the fire. Take our marshmallows and hold them up to the fire and let them heat up a little bit before eating them.&quot; Chase explained as he put a couple of marshmallows on his and Andromeda&#39;s roasting sticks. Aaron and Nyx also put marshmallows on their own sticks and sat in front of the fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, not too close, you&#39;ll burn it.&quot; Chase warned Andromeda as he helped her put her marshmallows at a good distance. The four of them now sat quietly as Nyx looked around at the four of them in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is...is this all we do?&quot; Nyx asked Aaron.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah. But I mean we can also talk or sing a song around the campfire if we want.&quot; Aaron explained to her as Nyx nodded her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I also brought us something to drink.&quot; Andromeda said as she reached into the basket she brought and pulled out a bottle of wine as Nyx&#39;s eyes went wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way, did you actually bring one of mom&#39;s expensive wines?&quot; Nyx asked raising her eyebrow at her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I&#39;ll put it back.&quot; Andromeda blushed as she set the wine down.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here I thought I was the trouble maker.&quot; Nyx smirked to her sister as Chase and Aaron chuckled a little at the girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you girls eat at the palace?&quot; Chase now asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well my personal favorite is Foie gras, it&#39;s more of a popular French cuisine.&quot; Andromeda answered as she brought the marshmallow up to her mouth from the fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...suppose I enjoy the Iberico ham the most. It&#39;s what my mom fed me when I was a little girl.&quot; Nyx shrugged as she still roasted her marshmallow.<br />
<br />
Nyx, Aaron, and Chase all watched as Andromeda ate her marshmallow and her eyes went wide and she grew a large smile on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;This...is...delicious! I can&#39;t believe we never had these before.&quot; Andromeda said excitedly as she got out another marshmallow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you like it, and there&#39;s something else we can do with these.&quot; Chase said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Andromeda asked Chase held his finger up indicating for her to wait. After a minute, Chase put his roasted marshmallow next to Andromeda&#39;s and the two marshmallows connected together. Andromeda found this to be sweet and scooted closer to Chase to be like their marshmallows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so besides food, what else do you two do at your home?&quot; Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Typical rich shit. Making sure we know the proper poise and how to eat with the right utensils at the dinner table. Then of course there&#39;s all the balls we attended growing up. We met people from other realms.&quot; Nyx explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, fairies, werewolves, and the kitsunes of course. You&#39;re one of the kitsune&#39;s aren&#39;t you?&quot; Andromeda now asked Aaron as Aaron nodded and shifted into his kintaro form. <br />
<br />
&quot;Technically a kintaro but close enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s my knight in furry armor.&quot; Nyx said as she gave Aaron a gentle kiss on his cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, Nyxie Pixie, you already have your own little nickname for your boyfriend? I wish I had a name picked out for you Chase.&quot; Andromeda said leaning her head on Chase&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t need one, I&#39;m with just plain Chase.&quot; Chase said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So then how did your parents take it when they found out you two were safe?&quot; Aaron now asked the girls as they both now fidgeted where they sat looking unable to answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, papa was certainly mad about certainly mad about the assholes who tried to attack us.&quot; Nyx finally answered Aaron.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I wouldn&#39;t doubt your father was angry.&quot; Aaron nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not our father, our papa. He&#39;s like our great great grandfather or something like that.&quot; Nyx corrected him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;d papa was actually more calm than gram gram was. I was certainly surprised to hear that. But I guess most people would fear Dracula.&quot; Andromeda said nonchalantly as Aaron and Chase stopped before eating their marshmallows.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-D-Dracula? The Dracula? The &#39;want to suck your blood&#39; Dracula?&quot; Chase asked the girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about, but yeah, Dracula is our papa, and our gram gram thinks the world of us. We all love her, but she and Nyx are pretty close.&quot; Andromeda explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, my parents told me that when gram gram came back home a long time ago. Our mother was pretty mad at her for something she did, but I went up to her, unafraid and invited her back home. Gram Gram likes to say that was my first act as princess.&quot; Nyx smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you enjoying the marshmallows?&quot; Aaron now asked as Nyx nodded eating her third one.<br />
<br />
Nyx looked up to see Chase and Andromeda eating a marshmallow that stretched out between their mouths and ate their marshmallows down as it led them to each others mouths. Nyx shook her head and sighed at this, she almost couldn&#39;t believe how much she was into Chase. Nyx&#39;s own heart beat for Aaron as he now reached over and grabbed her hand to which she blushed at. Nyx now thought back to their talk up on the roof at home and Nyx took a deep breath before setting her roasting stick down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come with me, there&#39;s....something I want to show you.&quot; Nyx said pulling Aaron up.<br />
<br />
As they left, Chase and Andromeda were embracing one another near the campfire in a passionate kiss, neither of them noticed Nyx and Aaron leave right away.<br />
<br />
Nyx brought Aaron far away just enough to wear Chase and Andromeda couldn&#39;t see them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...remember that story I told you about up on the roof?&quot; Nyx now asked Aaron as he nodded his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your....shittiest day?&quot; Aaron guessed as Nyx nodded in reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want....I want to show you my mark.&quot; Nyx said looking him in the eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nyx, you...you don&#39;t need to show it to me.&quot; Aaron said shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I trust you. Like I said I haven&#39;t told anyone outside my family about my mark, and....I trust you enough.&quot; Nyx said as Aaron took a breath and nodded.<br />
<br />
Nyx now turned around and slowly pulled up her shirt and hoodie to show Aaron. Aaron saw the &#39;v&#39; brand on her back and lightly touched it as he noticed Nyx wince and pulled his hand back, only for Nyx to let him still feel it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re still beautiful with it.&quot; Aaron said as Nyx turned around to look at him. Nyx now pulled Aaron&#39;s face down and kissed him as Aaron kissed Nyx back. Aaron almost couldn&#39;t believe how amazing his day with Nyx.</p>
