<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You managed to sell the wolfsbane to some werewolf movie fan?&quot; a young woman asked to the middle aged woman who was the proprietor of the magic shop that Emily had visited earlier in the day.<br />
<br />
&quot;The &quot;cursed&quot; wolfsbane, Rebecca,&quot; the shop proprietor answered with a nod, &quot;if she's eaten it, she should have transformed by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother... are you sure this was wise?&quot; the younger woman, Rebecca, asked, &quot;There are werewolf packs out there that could do what is needed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None are here,&quot; the shop proprietor answered, &quot;at least none that I know of or could sense through my magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't it be better to have moved the shop to where they are then?&quot; Rebecca asked, &quot;by doing things this way... She'll be facing grave danger. Danger that could destroy not only her, but humanity as well... which will include US.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how many established werewolf packs have listened to the advice of witches?&quot; the shop proprietor said back quickly, as if she were scolding Rebecca, &quot;Half of them are so afraid of being discovered that they'd either hide from what is coming or wouldn't make any move until it is too late. This &quot;werewolf movie fan&quot; is our only hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But our magic...&quot; Rebecca began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is not enough,&quot; the shop proprietor gave a heavy sigh, &quot;and will not be enough. What is coming has done a lot to protect itself from magic. It needs to be confronted that can meet its strengths head on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca only looked down and sighed heavily. The Magic Shop's ability to relocate so easily and seemingly without having to abide by various legal codes regarding business came from the fact that its proprietor and her daughter were practicing witches. They weren't wicked in any way, and generally tried to do good with their magic, though their weren't always successful. Some of it was Rebecca's belief that her mother's eccentricities to help make a sale either got in the way of good judgment or resulted in her missing some things that were fairly obvious. She had once tried to help a man who was depressed over his divorce by giving him a drink that would make him attractive to any woman. What resulted was the man meeting two women who had very different definitions of what was attractive, and his body couldn't transform into two different attractive forms at the same time. He ended up in emergency care and was a hermit now as far as Rebecca knew.<br />
<br />
But, Rebecca knew her mother was a kind and caring person. She also had some gift for prophecy and before moving the shop to its present spot, her mother had a terrifying vision. She'd seen what looked like a great stone sarcophagus opening and unleashing something dark and unspeakably evil. She saw this dark creature bring devastation throughout the world, with death following it as it went. According to her mother's vision, it was only stopped when it arrived here at Lapine Falls and was confronted by three werewolves. One a brown furred female, one a white furred female, and one a black furred male with the brown furred female being the apparent leader of the three. And apparently her mother had decided this werewolf movie fan would be that brown furred female.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you're right mother,&quot; Rebecca spoke.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Emily, meanwhile, had no knowledge of what Rebecca's mother felt to be her destiny. She was still enjoying her first night as a predator, as a real hunter. Her father had taken her hunting when she was a little kid, and she had always been close to him. The result had left her as somewhat of a tomboy and she engaged in a fair number of things that weren't typical girl behavior, not that Emily ever had a problem with that. She enjoyed football, baseball, basketball, car racing, hunting, and werewolves. And it hadn't necessarily hurt her social life.<br />
<br />
Cara was her roommate and best friend, and she actually seemed to enjoy Emily's werewolf fandom. Emily never figured that out, but decided it was best not to ask. The two got along well and they did a lot of things together. Cara had long flowing blond hair, though it was a very light blond color. So much so, that it was almost white, and about once a month, Cara went to the salon to have her hair cut and styled. Sometimes, she even had Emily come along. Though, Emily didn't always enjoy going to spas or the hair salon, which Cara did enjoy, she was always okay with doing things keep their friendship going, and repay Cara for putting up with werewolf movie marathons and pretending to pounce on her like the &quot;fictional&quot; creatures. Though, she never knew why Cara did it once a month and in a practically clockwork type manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Emily happily thought to herself as she took another bite out of the deer, &quot;now I AM a werewolf... and a sexy one at that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily found her mind then drifting over to another aspect of her social life.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what Brad would say if he saw me now?&quot; Emily wondered to herself.<br />
<br />
Brad Wesler was a guy she had met at a softball game she'd been in a couple of summers ago. He was a nice guy and his raven black hair seemed to glisten in the light that just gave Emily the mental image of a what a male werewolf would have when in human form. He was fairly athletic and occasionally practiced with Emily for her recreational softball league and his coaching the local legion baseball team. He, however, seemed to be a very scientific person and was only put up with Emily's werewolf fandom. She'd since decided to stay off the subject while they were on dates.<br />
<br />
Emily licked the last of the blood off of her muzzle and stood back up onto her hind legs cupped her new large fur covered breasts in her paw-like hands and gave a confident smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet he'd believe in werewolves now,&quot; Emily said to herself and looked up.<br />
<br />
The moon was still high in the sky and there was plenty of time for some exploring, and that gave Emily some other source of excitement. The hunt was fun and she'd proved she could overpower deer, which she hoped to be able to hunt for many years in the forests and farmlands that surrounded Lapine Falls for years to come, but that wasn't all her new instincts were drawn to. Lapine Falls got its name when a group of settlers moving into the Ohio River Valley came across a small stream with some small natural waterfalls. And in a chance meeting, they supposedly found a bobcat chasing a family of rabbits which jumped over the stream to escape the wildcat. They then named the village Lapine Falls to credit the rabbit's ability to escape their predator, and it had been Emily's home for many years, but now, as she looked down her muzzle, she had a different definition for it in her mind. Lapine Falls was her territory. Her hunting grounds... it was hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's see what's out there,&quot; Emily thought to herself and began to walk away from where she'd feasted on the deer, &quot;If I'll be hunting here and defending my territory here... I'll need to know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then proceeded to wander through the woods and fields that surrounded Lapine Falls. She ducked under tree branches, hurdled fences and went across some fields. It gave Emily a great sense of freedom to be able to run so far, so fast, and while being completely naked. After awhile, she stopped in another small forested area that she felt was far enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is good,&quot; Emily thought, &quot;I can come this far and defend it... I guess it's time to mark my territory now.&quot;<br />
<br />
She mentally blinked at how quickly that thought came to her, but she figured that that was just part of being a werewolf now. She would mark her territory and allow her to more easily defend it. She got back down onto all fours and moved toward a nearby tree. She was prepared to paw at the ground a bit, but as she reached that spot a strong scent reached her now lupine nose. What surprised her the most though was that she recognized the scent. She knew it. She didn't know how she knew it, but she did. She then came close and sniffed at the scent.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Cara!&quot; Emily gasped in surprise, &quot;that's Cara's scent! She was here... and recently... but she said she had gone to her Uncle's... and he lives two towns over!&quot;<br />
<br />
The scent continued on along the edge of the trees. After pawing out the ground and emptying her bladder on the ground near the tree, Emily then began following Cara's scent, wondering why her friend had lied and why she had come out here.</p>
