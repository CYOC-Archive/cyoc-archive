<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Our episode title is also the name of a song by Ella Fitzgerald.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
Spencer Lawson sat bored on the living room couch, absentmindedly flipping from one channel to the next.<br />
&quot;News, infomercial, news, infomercial, news, infomercial...&quot;<br />
She had thought about going back to bed after her father left for work, but decided not too, because she didn&#39;t want to miss her ride to school, which meant getting to spend a little extra time with Eric and Frieda before classes began for the day, even if they had to watch what they said and did around Benton Knight.<br />
Both her school bag and her overnight bag were packed and waiting to go. Spencer&#39;s bottle of specially made were birth control pills for her status as a wolf/cat/panther hybrid were there too, but she actually had today&#39;s pill tucked into her shirt pocket, thinking the later she took it today, the longer she would be covered tomorrow morning and could either sleep in or have more sex until it was time to get up and get ready for school.<br />
&quot;Where the hell are the cartoons?&quot; Spencer grumbled, before stopping on <i>The Weather Channel</i>.<br />
&quot;And as you can see by our forecast, the Pacific Northwest is living up to its reputation. Rain is expected to continue off and on throughout the morning and into the late afternoon. While the ground will still be wet come sunset, we&#39;re not expecting any precipitation overnight,&quot; said the weather man.<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s good to know,&quot; said Spencer.<br />
She was about to go back to her channel surfing when she heard a car honking outside.<br />
With a smile on her face, Spencer shut off the TV, grabbed her stuff, locked the front door of the house after setting the alarm, and dashed in the rain to the Knight family town car waiting in the driveway.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Ben Twist, while holding his boyfriend Alex Ramsey&#39;s hand as they walked with Nate Anderson to school, &quot;I can understand why your father took your car keys and insisted on you walking to school today, but why were you up so late last night?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; agreed Alex. &quot;It&#39;s not like we had a killer batch of homework or a wolf pack meeting last night.&quot;<br />
The three teenagers were walking together, each under their own umbrella, as the dating couple waited for their friend to respond.<br />
&quot;If I answer the question, you guys promise not to tell?&quot; asked Nate in return.<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; they quickly agreed.<br />
&quot;I fell asleep easily enough, but my dreams kept waking me up,&quot; admitted Nate.<br />
&quot;Dreams. As in prophecy dreams?&quot; wondered Ben, as both boys looked at him.<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s what they were, I sure hope they don&#39;t come true. These were more like nightmares.&quot;<br />
&quot;Some more details would help,&quot; said Alex, while Ben nodded his head in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Sometime during the night, I was either with Jean Talbot, Liv Robinson, back with Kenya Adaeze again, or some combination of the three; including all three at once at one point.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sexually?&quot; wondered Ben, since his mother Frances Twist was a licensed therapist.<br />
&quot;I know we had sex, but sex wasn&#39;t a part of these dreams,&quot; answered Nate. &quot;Anyway, things were always going well within the respective relationship of each dream until the ladies asked me the one question I couldn&#39;t answer.&quot;<br />
&quot;Which was?&quot; inquired Alex.<br />
&quot;When was I ever going to make a commitment, and to who? In the end, I couldn&#39;t do it with any of them, and wound up a lonely old gray fur werewolf who passed away still single.&quot;<br />
&quot;Heavy,&quot; observed Ben, to which Alex could only nod his head in agreement. &quot;Any idea what brought this on?&quot;<br />
&quot;No. I was head over heels in love with Kenya, but wound up having to break it off with her when I found out she was still doing her <i>night</i> job and had been proposed to by one of her clients!&quot; said Nate, since he had told them previously about Kenya allegedly being an &quot;ex&quot; escort for rich weres. Liv I haven&#39;t known that long, but I do have reservations about entering into any serious relationship with her because of some of her recent actions and preferences,&quot; added Nate, referring to some of Liv&#39;s sexual desires and her offering Ben straight sex, &quot;and Jean I barely know, although the threesome between her and Liv Friday was great.&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe that&#39;s it. You skipped school Friday to do that, now you&#39;re regretting it, especially since you have detention all this week,&quot; pointed out Alex.<br />
&quot;Could be,&quot; agreed Nate. &quot;There have been times in my life where I did more thinking with the little head between my legs than the big head on my shoulders. Then again, while I wouldn&#39;t of minded it with Kenya if things had worked out, I&#39;m not looking for an actual long term relationship right now. Especially not the kind that leads to marriage and kids. I&#39;m only 16 and a high school Junior. Maybe after college I&#39;ll start seriously dating and thinking about china patterns and nursery registries, but not right now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Other than suggesting talking professionally to Mother Frances, I have no idea what to tell you,&quot; admitted Ben. &quot;Alex and I might still have an uphill climb in some circles because we are a gay couple, but we&#39;re totally dedicated to each other now and forever,&quot; he said with a smile, before kissing his boyfriend&#39;s cheek.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong. When I do find the right woman, I&#39;m more than willing to make that kind of commitment. It&#39;s just that until the mess with Kenya, I hadn&#39;t really thought about it before,&quot; confessed Nate. &quot;After all, my parents didn&#39;t meet until they were both in college, and didn&#39;t get married until they graduated that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Could your brother having this... unique bond with two girls be part of the problem?&quot; wondered Alex.<br />
&quot;Other than being jealous that Eric had a threesome before I did, I don&#39;t see how. The way Eric talks about it—he, Spencer, and Frieda are seriously committed to each other already and plan to spend the rest of their lives together, even though he can only legally marry one of them when the time comes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Interesting, but unfortunately it&#39;s a discussion we&#39;re going to have to table for now,&quot; said Ben, as he noticed them coming up on Moon Lake High School.</p>
