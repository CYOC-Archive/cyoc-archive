<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kylie asked, &quot;What things?&quot;  Jamie answered, &quot;Well we need to make sure that the transformation worked the way it was supposed to work.  Here, find your wallet.&quot;  Kylie looked at the pile of clothes that Kyle had removed.  But they weren't Kyle's clothes anymore.  <br />
<br />
Kyle had taken off a t-shirt, a pair of jeans, a pair of underwear, a pair of socks, and sneakers.  The clothes laying on the floor now looked very much like those of Kylie's four new friends.  She saw a cheering top and skirt that matched the ones of the other girls exactly.  Reaching through the pile, she also found a lacy red bra and a purple thong, along with normal looking socks and shoes.  The shoes looked exactly like Kyle's except that they were now smaller in size.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; she asked.  &quot;It looks like the transformation changed everything along to make sure that you were always Kylie,&quot; Jamie said.  &quot;That's good,&quot; said Jennifer, &quot;Now we don't have to worry about changing all of that.  Hey, aren't you supposed to dare me now Kylie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly Kylie remembered she was still under Jennifer's control and was still bound to her command to release her from Jennifer's control.  She asked, &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;  Jennifer said, &quot;Dare.&quot;  &quot;Jenn, I dare you to release me from your control, to release me from being a slave of your will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer immediately said, &quot;Kylie, I command you to no longer be a slave of my will.  You will regain all sense of control over your mind.&quot;  Kylie shook her head violently for a moment, and then appeared to be OK.  &quot;Let's make sure it worked,&quot; Jennifer said.  &quot;Kylie, go make us some coffee.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Kylie developed a look of shock on her face and said, &quot;Why would I do that?  I'm not your slave.  Go do it yourself.&quot;  Jennifer smiled and said, &quot;Well that settles that.  You still need to find your wallet though.&quot;  Kylie's eyes darted around the room.  Finally she spotted a light blue purse on the coffee table.  She knew that none of the four girls had brought one in, and it definitely didn't belong to her mother.  She walked to the table, and picked it up.  She unzipped the top, and began to rifle throught the contents.  She began pulling things out of it, holding each one up to the other girls to make sure that it was something she needed.  She found a compact, lipstick, a tampon, some gum and mints, and a few other odds and ends.  <br />
<br />
Then she found a small wallet that matched the color of her purse.  Their was a driver's license visible through a see through window in the wallet.  She studied it carefully to see that it contained her picture, and that it said she was born on July 9, 1984.  That would make her 18 like the other girls.  She exclaimed, &quot;It says I'm 18!  And I can drive!&quot;  They were all a little shocked.  Trish said, &quot;How did the curse know to change her age?  You didn't tell it to Jenn.&quot;  Jamie responded, &quot;Maybe it had something to do with what Jenn was saying before and after about Kylie becoming our new good friend.&quot;  Liz, still confused, asked, &quot;What does that have to do with her aging?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jamie couldn't say for sure.  &quot;I don't know, Liz.  I guess the curse can pick up on the intentions of the person saying the curse.  Like, Jenn said the curse, and she would be embarrassed to be hanging around with a 15-year old freshman.  So the curse made Kylie a senior like us.&quot;  They thought.  Jennifer then said, &quot;Well that's true.  No offense Kylie, but it's actually better that you're not 15 anymore.  For all of us, really.&quot;  Kylie nodded and asked, &quot;What else do you think has changed?&quot;  &quot;That's what we need to see,&quot; replied Jennifer.  &quot;Take us to your room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie led the up the stairs, and turned right down the hall to her room.  The door was closed.  Immediately Kylie noticed something different about it.  The door used to be brown with a wood-stained finish.  Now it was a different style of door, not smooth but with small, paned sections in the middle.  It was also white in color.  She opened the door and led her friends inside.<br />
<br />
She immediately noticed the differences.  The carpeting had gone from brown to pink.  The walls also became pink, after previously being blue.  The color of her dresser, desk, and nighttable had also changed from brown to white.  Her closet doors changed the same way as the door to her room had.  Gone, too, were any signs of maleness.  There were no more sports cards, no more role playing games on the shelves.  Her room was now filled with girlish things.  A poster of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon adorned the wall, as did one of The Beatles, circa 1964.  That poster had actually been there before.  Apparently her taste in music and movies hadn't changed, as they were exactly the same as they had been.  Her computer was also the same, and she still had a TV/DVD combo.  In general, the room was extremely more feminine than it had been.  &quot;This is a room much more fitting for you now,&quot; Jennifer broke the silence.<br />
<br />
Kylie said, &quot;I better check my clothes!&quot;  She opened the drawers of her dresser.  In the top drawer she found panties and thongs.  The next drawer contained bras of all sorts.  The third drawer had some larger T-shirts, presumably for sleeping.  The bottom drawer contained jeans.  She went to the closet, and flung open the doors.  She found all feminine clothes--dresses, skirts, sweaters, pretty much the complete female wardrobe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's looks like everything is OK now,&quot; Jennifer said.  Kylie asked, &quot;Shouldn't we all get dressed again?  It's almost 6:00,&quot; she said, looking at her alarm clock.  &quot;Yea, you're right.  Are you parents going to be mad if we're still here when they get home?&quot;  Kylie thought for a moment.  &quot;I don't know.  I mean, I guess they'll know that you're all my friends.  So, hopefully not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer replied, &quot;OK then.  I'll be right back.&quot;  She darted out of the room, and could be heard bounding down the stairs.  Then the sound of the front door opening came.  Kylie looked shocked and asked the others, &quot;Did she just go outside naked?!&quot;  Trish sighed and said, &quot;Yea, it's a long story.  We'll explain it when she comes back.  In the mean time, I'm going to get my clothes.&quot;  With that she left the room with Liz following her.  Jamie stayed in the room.  She smiled at Kylie and said, &quot;Let me help you figure this female stuff out.&quot;   Kylie smiled back and said, &quot;Thanks.&quot;</p>
