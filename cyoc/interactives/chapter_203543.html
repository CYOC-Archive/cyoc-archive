<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You…you want to do this now?” Orion asked, looking at Alex with a rather shocked expression on his face. <br />
<br />
“No, I want to do it next week,” Alex responded sarcastically, giving the werewolf a playful punch on the shoulder. “Of course I want to do it now!”<br />
<br />
“Okay, then I should probably change ba-“ <br />
<br />
“You don’t have to!” Alex quickly realized what he said, and his face turned red. Orion gave him a look, which only made Alex’s face turn even redder. <br />
<br />
“You…want me to fuck you…as a wolf?” Orion asked. “Alex, are you <i>sure?</i>”<br />
<br />
Alex nodded his head nervously. “Being fucked by a werewolf has always been a fantasy of mine,” the young man admitted. “I never thought that I’d ever have the chance to actually have sex with a werewolf, but here I am, in front of a werewolf who is willing to have sex with me. I want to do this, Orion, and I want it to be with you.”<br />
<br />
If wolves could blush, then Orion’s face would’ve been beet red. Still, the wolf gave an understanding nod. “Alright &#954;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#940;&#946;&#953;, if that’s what you want, then who am I to deny your wishes.” <br />
<br />
A smile appeared on Alex’s face and he hugged the werewolf. “Then should we make our way back to my villa?”<br />
<br />
Orion laughed and shook his head, which greatly confused Alex. “Now why would we do that?” the wolf asked. “If you want to have sex with a werewolf, then we’re going to have sex <i>like</i> werewolves.” Alex’s eyes widened upon realizing what Orion meant. <br />
<br />
“We…we’re going to do this <i>out here?!</i>” the young man asked, his face much redder than it was before. Orion laughed at his reaction and nodded. “It isn’t uncommon for werewolves to have sex outside under the moonlight, especially on the night of a full moon.” <br />
<br />
The wolf wrapped his arms around Alex and pulled him into a deep, passionate kiss. The young man was caught off guard by Orion’s sudden advances, but he quickly found himself leaning into the kiss. While it was a bit awkward to kiss the wolf, Alex went with the flow, letting Orion guide him. <br />
<br />
As they continued to kiss, Orion let his hands drift down, grabbing the bottom of the younger man’s shirt. He began to pull it up, and Alex broke their kiss in order to raise his hands above his head. Once his shirt was off, Orion quickly moved down to take off Alex’s shoes, socks, and shorts, throwing them all into a neat pile. <br />
<br />
“My, what a delicious looking snack I’ve found,” Orion said in a sultry tone, licking his lips as he pulled Alex in close. He began to lick the young man’s neck, occasionally taking small nips. Alex gasped and moaned softly with each nip that Orion made. <br />
<br />
“Orion…what…what if someone…catches us?” Alex moaned, holding on tightly to the muscular wolf. <br />
<br />
“That makes it all the more exciting, &#954;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#940;&#946;&#953;,” Orion responded, his tone making Alex shudder. The wolf soon began to move down Alex’s body, showering it with canine kisses as he went. When he reached the bulge in Alex’s boxers, Orion slipped his claws beneath the hems and pulled down, revealing the young man’s throbbing erection. <br />
<br />
“My my, someone is rather excited,” Orion teased. He leaned down and pressed his cold, wet nose against Alex’s balls before sticking his tongue out and slowly licking the entire member. Alex let out a soft moan as he felt the canine’s tongue slowly move up his erection. He couldn’t believe that this was actually happening to him! <br />
<br />
After a few more licks, Orion pushed Alex down onto the soft grass, pinning him down. “Have you ever had sex before, &#954;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#940;&#946;&#953;?”<br />
<br />
“N-No…” Alex responded, his heart racing as Orion smirked and moved out of sight. He was about to sit up and look for him when the feeling of a tongue against his asshole made him moan in pleasure. Orion stuck his tongue deep into the young man’s hole, taking great care to lubricate his hole with as much saliva as possible. Alex couldn’t stop squirming in pleasure as the werewolf’s tongue penetrated him deeply and coated his hole with saliva. <br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Orion pulled his tongue out of Alex and moved back on top of him. He placed his hands on Alex’s shoulders, pinning him to the ground as he lined the tip of his cock up with Alex’s virgin hole. <br />
<br />
“Alright &#954;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#940;&#946;&#953;,” Orion said softly. “I’ll be honest with you: this is going to hurt a little at first. If it’s too much for you, please tell me. I won’t be able to live with myself if I hurt you.”<br />
<br />
Alex gave the wolf a soft smile and shook his head. “Orion, you can’t hurt me,” he said. “I trust you.” The werewolf nodded and began to prod the entrance to Alex’s hole. Then, he began to push in. <br />
<br />
For a brief moment, there was pain as Alex’s hole was stretched wider than it ever had been before. The young man clenched his eyes shut and grit his teeth, exhaling sharply to push through the pain. Orion sensed the human’s discomfort and gently cupped his cheek in his hand. <br />
<br />
“Breathe &#954;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#940;&#946;&#953;,” Orion said softly, caressing the younger male’s cheek. “It will get better soon, I promise.” Alex nodded in understanding and took a few deep breaths as Orion began to push more of his length in. The werewolf let out a few grunts, meeting a little resistance due to the human’s tight ass clenching hard on his cock. Finally, after a minute of pushing, Orion stopped pushing. <br />
<br />
“Are you doing alright Alex?” Orion asked, caressing the male’s cheek again. Alex nodded in response, taking a few deep breaths. “I’m alright…how deep are you?” <br />
<br />
“Up to my knot,” Orion said. “You took most of it. I’m going to start moving now, okay?” <br />
<br />
Alex nodded, and the werewolf began to pull out slightly. Once he had pulled out most of his length, he pushed back in, meeting much less resistance than before. Alex let out a loud moan of pleasure as Orion began to build up a rhythm with his thrusts, panting slightly. The pain had almost entirely faded and given way to immense pleasure that the young man never thought possible. <br />
<br />
“Harder…” Alex moaned. “I…I can take it…” The werewolf obliged and began to pound him harder, making Alex moan even louder. Each thrust of Orion’s cock managed to ram directly into his prostate, making the pleasure that much more intense. This feeling of being fucked by a man who cared for his safety and well-being made Alex feel warm inside. He never wanted this feeling to end. <br />
<br />
Orion’s breaths were getting quicker, and Alex could tell he was reaching his climax. His suspicions were confirmed a second later when Orion moaned. The wolf looked down at the human he was fucking and panted. <br />
<br />
“Gonna cum soon…” he panted. “Might…knot you…okay?”<br />
<br />
“Shove that thick knot of yours inside me and make me yours!” Alex cried out. The werewolf grunted, and suddenly his thrusts picked up both speed and power. Alex let out another loud cry of pleasure as he soon felt Orion’s knot stretch his hole wide and slip inside. The werewolf gave a few more short thrusts before throwing his head back and howling, letting loose a flood of hot lupine cum inside of Alex. Feeling Orion’s seed inside of him was enough to push him over the edge, and Alex moaned as he came all over his chest.<br />
<br />
When their orgasms finally died down, Orion panted and laid down on top of Alex, being careful not to crush him. The werewolf began to lick Alex’s face lovingly, and Alex gave him a kiss on the muzzle. Neither of them needed to say a word to the other; their actions had done all the talking. As the two of them cuddled there together, Alex finally realized what the warm feeling inside of him was. <br />
<br />
Love. <br />
<br />
The two of them were so caught up in enjoying the other’s company that neither of them noticed the small patch of black fur growing in on Alex’s ankle…</p>
