<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">True to her word, Naomi devoted the last three months of her mother's pregnancy to preparing to mother Jiro. Right off the bat she <br />
wished for pills she could take regularly to make herself lactate, which Yukiko had granted. A few days passed from starting on them <br />
and Naomi's breasts began to ache, her nipples becoming dark, swollen and sore. Naomi watched, enthralled, as day by day her <br />
breasts swelled from an A-cup to a solid C; once she wore the same bra for a week just for the novelty of feeling her breasts slowly <br />
overflow the cups. When she took it off they sagged slightly on her chest, quite maturely and inviting for her age. She nearly jumped fOr <br />
joy the morning she woke up to wetness on her chest; she had run to the mirror to see, admiring herself as she stroked her blue-veined <br />
boobs and teased the erect nipples to increase leakage.<br />
<br />
After impressing her mother close to term with an extensive knowledge of what to do to ease the birthing process, Naomi convinced her <br />
to have a home birth, with Naomi taking care of her throughout. Her mother's water ended up breaking while watching TV one night; <br />
working together, mother and daughter got Naomi's mom's clothes off and laid her down on the towels Naomi had arranged for this <br />
occasion. Naomi's mom looked huge and swollen to her, engorged breasts dwarfed by the mountain of her belly that held precious Jiro.<br />
<br />
Naomi attended to her mother with careful concern and greedy anticipation; this was the culmination of three months of planning and <br />
research. Her mom cried out in pain as her contractions intensified and her belly gradually sank into her crotch, signaling Jiro beginning <br />
to be forced through her birth canal. There were no complications, however; Yukiko's magic had ensured her body had the proper <br />
proportions for a safe birth.<br />
<br />
Finally Naomi saw her mother's swollen labia bulge and retreat, as if her vagina were breathing, and she knew Jiro was pushing against <br />
his exit. She instructed her mom to push with her next contraction, and bent down to observe. Hidden by her mother's quivering belly, <br />
Naomi felt it safe to plant a tiny kiss on her genitals and whisper &quot;Almost here, little brother...&quot; Jiro's head crowned as she placed her lips <br />
to her mother's crotch. Slowly Jiro emerged; with a final push and scream, he was completely free of the woman who birthed him a <br />
second time. As luck would have it, his mother fell into an exhausted sleep, spent from the effort and sore between her legs.<br />
<br />
Naomi cleaned Jiro off and smacked his butt to clear his airways, causing him to cry for the first time as he was exposed to the outside <br />
world. His sister held him and rocked him in her arms, calming him tenderly. &quot;Shhhh...it's ok, my little baby bro,&quot; Naomi whispered with <br />
the care and devotion of a new mother. Jiro continued to cry, but when he opened his eyes he looked up into the face of Naomi - the <br />
first person he would ever see, gazing down at him with pure affection. He smiled and gurgled wordlessly, his earliest memories <br />
imprinting Naomi as his true caregiver. Naomi leaned down and kissed him on his forehead. She rocked him for several minutes and <br />
studied him, intrigued, tracing with her hand the umbilical cord from his navel as it wound its way back inside their mother, connecting <br />
them both. She rested her hand on her mother's vulva and nearly jumped when it throbbed again, short and quick, expelling Jiro's <br />
placenta in a minute or two.<br />
<br />
Naomi caught it and examined it with interest. &quot;So this was the organ that had nourished Jiro inside Mom's womb...&quot;<br />
<br />
She picked up a nearby pair of kitchen scissors and severed the placenta from the umbilical cord, laying it on its own towel. Holding Jiro <br />
in one hand, Naomi checked to see that her mom was peacefully sleeping. In the other hand, Naomi took the umbilical cord, pulled up <br />
her skirt and opened her panties. Trembling slightly, she parted the lips of her vulva and inserted the umbilical cord several inches into <br />
her own vagina. The feeling was so alien and invasive, like holding a large snake within her, but she felt wonderful - connected to Jiro as <br />
if she were his mother, not her mom. She looked at herself in a nearby mirror and giggled at the novelty - the sight of a teenage girl <br />
rocking a newborn baby, its umbilical cord snaking up under her skirt. She lowered Jiro to her crotch, showing him her sparsely hairy <br />
genitals and tracing the cord from there to his navel. &quot;Congrats, big boy,&quot; she lied gently and happily. &quot;You came out of there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi looked into the immature eyes of her baby brother, saying to herself &quot;It's time.&quot; She unbuttoned her shirt and undid the strained <br />
clasp on the front of her bra, letting her milk-filled breasts bounce free. &quot;Want some food, Jiro? My little boy looks thirsty!&quot; she said <br />
sweetly. She tickled Jiro's mouth with a swollen nipple, holding his head to her boob and letting her brother latch on to her. Jiro began <br />
sucking hungrily at Naomi's nipple, and she sighed in ecstasy and joy as her milk flowed. She was breastfeeding her brother, connected <br />
to him by his umbilical cord - important first steps to conditioning him to love her above all others. &quot;You'll love Mommy, Jiro... But you'll <br />
love me even more.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was only when Jiro saw Naomi cut the cord connecting him to her that he cried again.</p>
