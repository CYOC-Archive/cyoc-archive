<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark was very average, in sports, grades, his body, money or reputation. He was friendly to everyone but he only had a few ones who he can call his friends. His childhood wasn&#39;t very interesting, going to school in mornings and spending the rest of the day watching tv, playing videogames or doing his homework. He didn&#39;t complain for years until he became 13 years old and new urges were growing in him. Since the moment he started to grow his first pubes and armpit hair, he just desired to learn more and more about it. The characters in the old cartoons he used to watch didn&#39;t change at all. After several years, they still wear the same clothes. So, Mark started to watch people around him instead.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s hard to describe, but in Mark&#39;s mind his parents were always the same. Like time was frozen for them and they looked the same during his whole life. His mother was a little bit out of shape, but she was a lovely brunette woman with long hair always tied in a bun and fan of long nails and make-up. His dad had a slim-like dad body, he still had plenty of hair on his head, clean-shaven and wore glasses all the time. For Mark, there wasn&#39;t anything particular interesting about them, and when he was young he thought that&#39;s how parents should be, based on the ones he watched in cartoons. But, now he thought his parents were simply boring.<br />
<br />
It was way more interesting to think about his classmates, boys and girls who he had met for years and until now he never thought about their looks. He recently realized that girls were getting taller, more feminine and, most importantly, developing breast like moms. On the other side, changes on boys were more subtle, some of them were getting taller, but he was getting taller too, so he barely noticed it. He had no idea about baby fat and, in his mind, muscles should be huge like cartoons to be noticeable. He can&#39;t believe his friends weren&#39;t changing like him. He recently had learned about puberty and he was already making his first steps in body hair and voice changing. Sometimes he wondered if he was an early bloomer or maybe his friends just didn&#39;t give it the same importance as he&#39;s. <br />
<br />
However, everything in his mind start to accelerate a month ago when he accidentally watched his next door neighbor through his bedroom&#39;s window. The guy next door was a few years older than him, around 16 or 17 years old. He was very modest and always properly dressed up, but in that occasion he was casually walking almost naked through his room. Mark can see every crave of his body, his muscles, his skin, his body hair and, most importantly, the protuberance that he&#39;s sporting between his legs.<br />
<br />
Everything changed for Mark since then, just being around his classmates made him flustered, as much as he tried he can&#39;t avoid watching his neighbor through them, his imagination continuously made him wonder how he and his friends will look when they become young adults and those thoughts eventually lead to transformation fantasy.<br />
<br />
*Ding Dong*<br />
<br />
Mark left his bedroom to check the door, excited as he expected to see his best friend, Sean, for a sleepover in his house that weekend, he like the idea of watching movies and playing videogames until very late but he was really excited to see his friend wearing just his pajamas or helplessly sleeping at night. Mark shook those mischievous thoughts, fixing his hair and ready to have a good time despite of what will happen. Opening the door, Mark was surprised to instead see a small, brown package at his doorstep.<br />
<br />
He opened the package to find a small USB flash drive with the words “plug me in Mark :)” written on a labeling sticker. The boy smiled, Sean had pulled his fair share of pranks before on Mark but never one as elaborate as this.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, Mark returned to his room and went over to his laptop, plugging in the USB device as a download sequence began. After a few minutes of processing and data collection, his screen flashed a bright white as words appeared on his screen.<br />
<br />
“The BIG Baskin experience: Demo version”<br />
<br />
Mark’s face turned bright red as he panicked that he might have installed a virus onto his laptop, almost shutting it before he saw that he had entered its transformationet’s webpage, and the start-up screen’s words piqued his interest.<br />
<br />
Replicate the film&#39;s most memorable scene in real life!<br />
<br />
“Film? What film? That old one about a kid who turns into a grownup? So... If I replicate it... will I become a grownup too? huh, ha, sure, why not. I guess I&#39;m going to try it before Sean arrives so I can surprise him with my new chest hair… hahaha. This isn&#39;t one of your best pranks!”<br />
<br />
Without much interest, he pressed entered and suddenly a bright flash of light blinded him temporary, almost instantly Mark and his surroundings began to transform. His individual bed turned into a bunk bed and a crib and baby toys appeared from nowhere. His walls changed in color and basically everything was replaced with stuff that could belong to a boy in the 80&#39;s. Mark looked around alarmed at the changes occurring around him and even in him. His thin almost non-existent muscles exploded all at once, stretching him to the size of a junior bodybuilder. Tearing off his clothes, he ran to the bathroom, unable to stop the feeling of manliness emerging from inside of him. From his former thin chest emerged a pair of male pecs, as well as his face and body structure becoming more and more adult-like by the second. Mark let out grunts of passion and lust, as a rush of testosterone flowed through his blood and veins. He was sweating and beet red, his pathetic little dick throbbing as he could feel something begin to change on it. Inch by inch, a huge cock grew erected from his small prickle along with a pair of pumping hairy balls. He looked at himself in the mirror, not recognizing the face he saw before him.<br />
He touched his face in disbelief and noticed a sandpaper texture coming from his newly got stubble. Grabbing an electric razor next from his bathroom cabinet, he attempted to shave it but he can&#39;t, leaving him with a scruffy douche bro look.<br />
<br />
He smirked at himself, running his meaty hands over his chest and abs and admiring himself in the mirror. The stud noticed an awful scent emanating from his body. He lifted his pits up, and found a bush of armpit hair releasing an almost putrid musky stench into the air around him. He grabbed the electric razor again, about to shave it off, before a knock on the bathroom door stopped him. He opened the door to find a naked, blonde guy in front of him.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god, Mark is that you! Thank god it wasn’t only just me! I was coming to your house when I started to grow. As soon as I became THIS I entered in your bedroom but you weren&#39;t there, so I came here. I can’t believe the same thing happened to you!” The blonde guy ranted profusely.<br />
<br />
There was a moment of silence between the newly grown young men. Mark scanned Sean’s body hungrily, before meeting his eyes once again. He scratched the back of his neck confusedly, revealing his furry, wet pits and nausea-inducing musk. “Who are you? And why are you doing in my bathroom?” The darker haired guy replied concernedly.<br />
<br />
The blonde man took a step back away from Mark, the odor of his pits striking his nostrils the second he raised his arms. “Mark, it&#39;s me, Sean! We both had turned older! Don’t you recognize me? Our sleepover tonight?”<br />
<br />
The jock chuckled, “First off, my names Josh, Josh Baskin, and I got no idea about what you’re talking about. I don&#39;t even know what&#39;s going on. I just woke up and discovered I&#39;m a grown up! And now you&#39;re here and saying those no senses. I&#39;m really confused!”<br />
<br />
Josh awkwardly laughed, as he tried to process all the things that are happening all of the sudden. For a moment, he blinked and everything that Sean said made sense, so he ended up realizing his mind was struggling with two different lives right now. One was real and the other one was recently made up. The problem is he didn&#39;t know which one.<br />
<br />
“I-I think I need a break. My head hurts.&quot; Mark said as he took a seat on the toilet. &quot;I guess you&#39;re not lying, but... what about these memories, I can remember two families, different friends, even love interests.&quot; Sean didn&#39;t say a word, he just put a hand on his friend&#39;s back. &quot;What&#39;s happening with me? Is it because of Zoltar?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean stuttered after hearing that last word. Somehow, he thought he had heard that name before, but he didn&#39;t remember anything else. He knew that if he can figure it out, maybe he could understand what&#39;s going on. “Is it a place? Or a brand? Maybe a song…” Sean was scratching his head and his newly grown armpit hair when he heard a beeping sound coming from somewhere very close. It was Mark&#39;s computer which was showing a red error screen, apparently it&#39;s because he had altered two people instead of one and it couldn&#39;t rewrite all of their memories. It finally collapsed and shutdown. Like if they were connected to the device, both Mark and Sean&#39;s minds got blind for a moment. The PC didn&#39;t turn on again but they still woke up. However, in the worst possible scenario, they had lost all their memories, old and new ones.<br />
<br />
Sean was the first one to wake up, he looked around and immediately noticed he was in a bathroom, at least it seems he still remember some stuff. He looked at himself and noticed his big and hairy adult male body. So, he didn&#39;t deny he was a man and it implies having dick and balls, and, yep, there they are inside those incredible tight trousers. For some reason, he was getting a boner which almost instantly lead him to cum soak his underwear. Meanwhile, Mark had already woke up and after inspecting his body and surrounding, he noticed Sean and his hard-on. Perhaps he was acting by some hidden feelings, because Mark started to get inched closer and closer to him.<br />
<br />
Sean whimpered as Mark went right next to his ear, his hot breath and musky scent driving him crazy. The hunky man whispered seductively, “I don&#39;t know who I am or where we are, but after seeing you I immediately realized that I desire you. My dick is getting hard and I badly need to put it somewhere, if you get what I mean.”<br />
<br />
Of course, this was wrong, they were best friends, and this was nothing related to what happened in the movie. Why was this going in this direction? None of the new young men questioned it because they&#39;re being guided by their hidden feelings. Feelings that were mistaking a long-term friendship with a strong and passionate love. Everything was going far too fast and they weren&#39;t even trying to think about any other possibility. So, Sean followed his instincts, backing himself into a once familiar room. His best friend’s bedroom, the one where he had spent countless hours before in his old life before it turned into a movie scenario.<br />
<br />
Sean found himself sitting on the edge of the bunker bed that could be too small for them right now. But he didn&#39;t care, he thought they would figure it out a way to make it work. Just thinking about it, made his old life fading from his head. The more time passes, the more they began to fade from his mind, and soon he only knew it was the first time he had set foot into this room. Mark entered through the door totally nude and sweaty, wearing nothing but a cocky grin on his face. Sean looked up at the stud slowly approaching him, nervous as if he was prey hunted by a predator.<br />
<br />
Step by step, Mark walked closer until his crotch was in Sean’s face. He quivered, the 9 inch cock of his former best friend right between his eyes. He couldn’t help himself but inch closer, drawn it, breathing it’s scent as he unconsciously began rubbing his own boner with his hand. Mark laughed a little, gripping Sean’s shortcut blonde hair and pulling his head up to meet his eyes, “I don&#39;t know how many times we have done this before, but for me, I&#39;ll make you feel like the first time.”<br />
<br />
Sean gulped, memories flashing through his head and fading away at an instant, his head pounding with a barrage thoughts, and only one truly speaking, his hormone influenced mind.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me, big guy.”<br />
<br />
Sean’s wish was instantly fulfilled as the man he had been lusting over took his musky, veiny cock that he so desperately desired and without a second to spare, he shoved it into Sean’s mouth, causing eyes to go bloodshot and his throat to choke. Somewhere deep inside of him, a little glimpse of a memory sparked for an instant and told him to cry for help. However, that scream of desperation wasn’t louder than the sound he made as he gagged up and down on alpha cock.<br />
<br />
Mark moaned as he throat fucked the cute blonde boy, “I don&#39;t care about the past because this is the best moment in my life, I think I’m gonna need to get some more experiences later, don&#39;t you think so?” Sean’s hormones were going crazy, the idea of doing this a lot more times made his cock cream prematurely, as an aura of dominance was also emanating off of Mark and it was too much for him to handle. Almost hypnotically, he agreed to every word his former best friend said as he continued to work the meat in his mouth. Mark stopped, removing his dick from Sean’s drooling lips. He panted, covered in a layer of sweat with pre-cum blanketing his tip. “Get up, I want to try those beautiful lips of yours before I take you as mine.” he commanded.<br />
<br />
Sean didn’t say a word, he just smiled as he thought about how good he was about to get fucked. Sean&#39;s preteen self was truly gone, and unlike his former self, all he cared about was the big guy in front of him.<br />
<br />
The two men’s lips clashed together, the taste of sweet saliva and sweaty cock flavored their mouths, pulling apart for mere seconds before they came together again. Sean shut his eyes and bit his lip from pressure of something entering his virgin rear end. Mark groaned, shoving his dick deeper, and began to thrust, picking up momentum as the clapping sound from Sean’s thick bubble butt caused him to go even faster. Mark, almost already nearing his climax, loosed one final thrust into his new boyfriend&#39;s ass, filling the blonde with his creamy manmilk.<br />
<br />
Sweaty and breathing heavily, the pair flopped onto the ground, their bodies beginning to relax from the climax they shared together. As their minds drifted to sleep, the final memories of their past lives wiped out.<br />
<br />
Deep down, Mark realized everything, what happened with his body, the mysterious program and how it had changed his life completely and it wouldn&#39;t  be the same as the one he had before. But with his new form and new life, he was happy that he was finally getting all he had dreamed for so long. With a smile, his final memory and consciousness washed away and the new Mark scanned his new room. Looking at his bunker bed, 80&#39;s stuff, toys on the floor, and lastly at the cute, blonde boy that he had just conquered laying next to him fast asleep. With a big grin, Mark felt his dick and finally shut his eyes, he only has to redecorate now.</p>
