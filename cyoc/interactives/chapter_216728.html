<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leaving Lucky to his experiments, Tony shook his head with a smile and stepped down the hall toward his own room. Then, before he could go in, he sniffed down the hall and realized he smelled something. Something inviting. He followed the scent down the hall and to a room he recognized. Megan&#39;s room. Biting his lip, he knocked on the door, hoping she would be willing to answer it. She was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey, Tony. Why don&#39;t you come in?&quot; she said in a nice voice, seeming a bit nervous somehow nevertheless. Tony noticed that the scent was strong in here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Megan. Are you okay? You seem agitated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um. I&#39;m fine. Hey, what was that scream I heard earlier? Is everything okay back there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, that was Lucky. I checked on him and everything turned out okay. He would probably say better okay, in fact.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s good to here, I guess. Hey, Tony, do I really smell good to you like you said last night? Do I smell like that even now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah. Actually you smell better tonight than you did last night. Did someone smuggle perfume in here? And did your nose change, too, since we last met?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Daisy helped me practice with some scents today. You know, about me leaving after things got weird yesterday, ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s okay, Megan, I get it. I&#39;m sorry I threw our fates in your face like it was some sort of death. Trying to comfort Lucky was just making me think of some things and wondering why you were so gungho about this. I can totally--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to apologize, Tony. I should apologize. You were right. Our lives are gonna be completely different from now on. We aren&#39;t gonna have the chance to do the things we really want forever. But maybe, right now, we can do the things that we never would have done before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, okay, yeah, I guess. But what does that--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sniff my butt again, Tony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sniff it. Lick it. But don&#39;t stop there. I don&#39;t just want your nose or your tongue in me, Tony. I want something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you don&#39;t mean--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Tony. Who knows how much longer we&#39;ll have the freedom and ability to have sex with who we want to. I want it with you. Is that so much to ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, baby, I thought you&#39;d never ask! So are we doing this on the bed, or--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right here! Right now!&quot; she exclaimed, dropping to all fours right where she stood. And Tony did start to sniff her back there. And he even started to lick. The scent in the room was stronger here than anything else! It filled him with a mix of hunger and euphoria beyond anything he&#39;d ever known. Tony realized this was a scent that he would learn to value highly as he began his new life as a dog. What he was smelling was an inhuman and irresistible female lust, and it was triggering an irresistible male lust in his own body. His penis went from flaccid to erect faster than he&#39;d ever known it to. Before he knew it, his chest was on her back, his arms were around her waist, and his hard dick was poking her tirelessly, looking for a way in.<br />
<br />
Megan squeezed her rear against Tony and moaned in satisfaction as he finally entered her sex. Tony hung his tongue out panting as he humped her faster than he&#39;d ever would have thought his hips could gyrate. He was like a machine. Completing this urge, satisfying this partner, and quenching the thirst in these loins was all that was on his mind right now. He had experienced sex before, but never like this, and his entire universe seemed to be crashing to a screeching halt to make it happen for him and for this incredible female that he had desired ever since he met her in the waiting room all those days ago. Unfortunately, it seemingly crashed to a halt again for a significantly less pleasant reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! My junk! It hurts!&quot; Tony shouted when sharp, burning pains start burrowing in and out of his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tony?! Are you okay?!&quot; Megan panicked, not sure what could be wrong but noticing she could feel something unusual about the dick that was inside her, almost like the shape of it was deforming. Tony, for his part, felt a lightning bolt of pain inside his manhood as something pierced his dick inside to make it harder than it had ever been before. He felt the melding and dissolving of skin as foreskin seemed to fuse into his belly somehow. And then the pain was over, but he realized the base of his dick felt weird, but good enough that he could continue his mindless rutting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine Megan. I&#39;m almost there, are Yoo-OOOOOOOooo!?!&quot; he howled in pleasure with his enormous pink tongue flapping around. He felt his penis swelling up at the base, but it didn&#39;t feel painful this time. It felt like he was about to cum. And before he knew it, he did! He held her as close as he could and quivered to the beat of his sperm squirting into his mate. And at last, his mind started coming down from his orgasmic high and starting to ponder that inevitable question, &quot;What have we done?&quot;</p>
