<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At lunch Ryan could hear girls talking about him. While they whispered at first the conversation could barely be called quiet as their voices rose over time. After finishing a sandwich he leaned back relaxing a bit and smiling over how his day was going so far. He was about to pick up his second sandwich when a girl came walking over to him. She had been seated at the table where girls were talking about him. She wasn&#39;t bad looking probably the prettiest girl body wise in the group. Her face was rather average and her hair was quite curly and wild but otherwise she looked appealing enough with decent looking thighs, somewhat proportionately long legs, quite nice curvy hips with an okay waist and more than just ample breasts.  She looked him in the eyes and stutteringly began speaking to him. Her eyes were nice shade of green Ryan realized but then tried to make out what she was trying to say. <br />
<br />
Suddenly she asked &quot;You&#39;re Ryan, right?&quot; before he could figure out what she said before that question. &quot;Yeah.&quot; Ryan answered nonchalantly. The girl leaned forward causing her to show some of her cleavage seemingly unintentionally. &quot;is it really true...&quot;  Ryan looked at her and grinned. &quot;Yeah.&quot; He said again almost as nonchalantly as before. She looked at his pants and stepped back rather quickly with a blush on her face, her chest unavertably bouncing from the quick movement. Ryan glanced at the concealed female flesh. &quot;Oh.&quot; She answered. Ryan felt his warm manhood starting to throb in his pants. The girl looked away and brushed her out of her face which caused her to squish her own breast a little. Ryan began to feel somewhat uncomfortable with how he was responding physically to this girl. &quot;You wanted to ask me more?&quot; Ryan said to the girl somewhat hurried. &quot;Uh...&quot; The girl looked spooked. &quot;No...&quot; She finally answered and then walked off. Ryan looked at the girl while she walked off, specifically his eyes dropped to her behind. It wasn&#39;t the fullest but those hips were attention grabbers for sure. He felt his crotch throb again the outline in his pants slightly more visible and further down his leg. <br />
<br />
He got up and grabbed his sandwich from which he took a bite. One of the guys asked where he was going. &quot;Toilet&quot; He answered and walked off continuing to his sandwich.  To his surprise he saw Mike taking a piss and two urinals over there was some 14 year old kid with a below average looking cock that he was talking to. Ryan realized that he couldn&#39;t drop this opportunity he had only come her as an excuse but focussing on his bladder he felt confident enough to interrupt them. Getting in between them Ryan lifted out his still excited cock which was about 2 inches longer than when he was completely flaccid already. With some effort he held it above the urinal and started to take a piss in it&#39;s semi hard state it burned a bit. He then turned to Mike and acted surprised to see him. &quot;Oh, Mike! Sorry, I didn&#39;t notice you.&quot; The other kid beside him started staring at his cock. &quot;Yeah, Sure..&quot; Mike responded. Ryan turned to the kid. &quot;He&#39;s my bigger brother, by the way.&quot; The kid looked startled and then looked at Mike&#39;s dick before Mike managed to pull it back and put it into his pants. &quot;Really?&quot; The kid asked. &quot;Yeah, really, go figure.&quot; Mike grumbled at walked out after washing his hands furiously at the sink. He didn&#39;t even dry them. The kid looked at Ryan&#39;s dick again. &quot;You&#39;re huge.&quot; Ryan grinned. &quot;Yep and it get&#39;s even bigger.&quot; The kid gasped and looked at his own dick. &quot;I wish mine was so big.&quot; Ryan put his cock away having finished. The kid quickly realized he had finished quite a while ago and put his away as well. Ryan shrugged. &quot;Well, keep at it, maybe it will still grow... what was your name again?&quot; The kid eyes brightened. &quot;Chris, my name is Chris.&quot; Ryan washed his hands while responding. &quot;Well, maybe you&#39;re going to get lucky some day Chris.&quot;Ryan walked out. <br />
<br />
He looked at a couple of girls while waiting for the teacher at the classroom. He was late, stupidly so. Lot&#39;s of students were already talking about how he probably was sick. Sure enough a teacher came over and told the class that he had gone home. Everyone started either started complaining about this not being the last class and wanting to go home or being excited by the extended break. A couple of his supposed buddies asked him if he wanted to play a little basketball or something with him but he declined because he felt like doing something else instead. The people from his class splintered over the school. Undoubtedly some of them would go and cause trouble. He looked around and walked over to what students called the worst spot for a toilet ever. He was currently on the 4th floor where only a few classes were given the toilet on the 4th floor for some reason wasn&#39;t near any stairs or even centrally located on the floor but at the very end of the longest dead end hallway. Rumour had it that the office on this flour was supposed to be a toilet but was changed into an office because the office would otherwise be too far out of the way. The office however was never used much like the entire floor since the recent addition of another wing to the school. The only reason his class had a room here was because there was a rare projector in the classroom that the teacher liked to use. Ryan sat down in the moldy smelling toilet. Even the main door had a lock for some reason which he closed because why not, nobody ever used this place. There was even dust on the toilet seats. He sat down after wiping the dust of with prehistoric toiletpaper and took Chronivac  out of his bag.</p>
