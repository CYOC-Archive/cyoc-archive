<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alibaba swirled out of the lamp in a mass of smoke and sparks, intending to tower over whoever this latest fool was. &quot;WHO DARES SUMMON THE.... ouch!&quot; His entrance was ruined as he bumped his head on a low ceiling. Cursing briefly in Arabic, he rubbed his head and then resumed his thundering introduction. &quot;...THE GREAT DJINN ALIBABA!?&quot;<br />
<br />
This was a small room, cluttered and dirty. His nose wrinkled at the odor of dirty socks and sweat, and he glared fiercely around until he spotted a figure cowering in the corner, hands thrown up over his face. Good - the mortal might not have seen him bump his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot; From the voice it was a young male preteen. &quot;Shit! I&#39;ve never believed any of that magic stuff! I thought it was all fairy tales!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alibaba scowled. The Djinn had been written off, literally, as figments of imagination, fantasy creatures that lived only in myth. Where he and his kind had once inspired awe and respect, the most common reactions now were terror and fears that the person had lost their mind. Or worse, that Alibaba was some impressive practical joke created by human science. At least this time the fool believed what he was seeing. &quot;STAND SO THAT I MAY SEE THE FOOL WHO PLAYS WITH FORCES HE DOES NOT.....&quot; The djinn stopped, seeing the boy cringe. He was sobbing, pressed into the corner and shaking. Remembering his resolve to try something different, Alibaba sighed and assumed the form of a boy about his new master&#39;s age, dressed in the same type of clothing. He drifted down and sat on the edge of the messy twin bed. It took another minute for the terrified preteen to look up, and confusion was obvious in his wide eyes.<br />
<br />
The boy looked around frantically, then stared at Alibaba. &quot;Wha... where is...?&quot; He flushed suddenly, still terrified, but now trying to hide his fear. &quot;Who are you? How did you get in my room?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Djinn sighed. &quot;You didn&#39;t hear me the first time?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wiping his eyes on the back of his arm, the boy scrambled up, still pressed against the wall. Alibaba was pleased to see that he had made the boy wet himself in fear. The preteen saw his look and dropped his hands over his wet crotch. &quot;Dammit!&quot; Fresh tears started up, this time in embarrassment. Feeling an unaccustomed flicker of pity, Alibaba waved a hand and the young boy&#39;s clothes were clean and dry. &quot;Cease your wailing, kid. I will not hurt you. At least not yet. And grown men have soiled themselves far worse than you when they first beheld me.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a glance down confirmed the change of clothing, his new master managed to calm himself. &quot;Uh, you&#39;re the...genie?&quot; He was hesitant, probably afraid that he was imagining things. He swallowed. &quot;Ali-baba? Did I say that right? I&#39;m sorry if I got it wrong, really!&quot;<br />
<br />
Afraid the boy was going to burst into tears again, the djinn searched his memory and managed to remember how to smile. &quot;That was not too bad. What is your name, my soon to be doo...&quot; He stopped. &quot;Sorry. Habit. What is your name, Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Scott.&quot; The preteen remained against the wall, but lost a little of the terrified look. &quot;Scott Redfield.&quot; He was slender and looked a little small, it seems he hadn&#39;t hit a growth spurt yet. Alibaba guessed his age to be about 9. &quot;Man, you sure don&#39;t sound like Robin Williams!&quot;<br />
<br />
That cursed movie! Alibaba scowled, fresh anger boiling at the mention of &#39;Aladin&#39;. While a few parts were not completely wrong, most of the depiction of the djinn was insulting pap for small children. He forced back the anger when he saw Scott cringe back. &quot;That... fiction was not a good representation of my kind. But it is probably all you have seen.&quot; He smiled again, this time have an easier time. &quot;Scott. Draw strength, young master, and show less fear. I demand respect, but do not need your terror.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really a genie?&quot; The boy still looked frightened, but now uncertainty was growing - doubts about what he had seen, struggles to deny the possibilities of magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. And to help you believe...&quot; Alibaba cocked his head and thought a moment, then gestured. A swirl of sparkles obscured Scott for a moment. Scott batted at the sparkles floating round his head in obvious confusion, then froze when he caught site of how big ad hairy were now his hands. He yelped, the sound of a deep bass, and jumped back to bang against the wall. He stared down at himself. The skinny boy was now a manly muscular man, quite hairy and powerful. Thick eyebrows stared from a squared head, and a thick short beard covering half of it. Scott turned to see his reflection in a dresser mirror and then gave a short gasp as he recoiled again. However, after a moment he moved closer and began to examine himself. &quot;Holy crap!&quot; The former boy&#39;s voice was definitely deeper and rumbling, and even that startled the boy. He was probably in his late thirties, and his hunky, powerful appearance would be strongly attractive to both females and males. He stared at his reflection for another minute before he finally remembered the djinn.<br />
<br />
He turned back to Alibaba, now looking both amazed and scared. The djinn almost laugh that this imposing man had wet himself a minute ago. &quot;Does this form please you, my master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, I don&#39;t know.&quot; Scott glance down at himself and back at the mirror, then looked back at Alibaba. &quot;I didn&#39;t wish for this. I mean, it&#39;s incredible, but I can&#39;t go out like this! Nobody will recognize me. I can&#39;t even recognize myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can change you back in an instant, your family won&#39;t have to see you and you can do some grownup stuff before they even notice you&#39;re not around. And fear not for your wishes. I have done this as a... gift... to help you believe in my power and ability.&quot; Alibaba smiled, finding some amusement at calling this a gift. Scott was already concerned about his new body and what he could do with it. And in truth, the boy didn&#39;t feel so happy of being too big, hairy and beefy. He felt some kind of shame of how macho he looked. &quot;But I&#39;m not really happy about this, I want you to restore my former appearance.&quot; He asked the genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure?!&quot; Alibaba was concerned, this man was strong, virile, imposing. Completely different from the punny kid he met before. &quot;I won&#39;t change you back yet. Try to explore a little more of your new body, every part.&quot; The genie said and the boy felt his new beard and ran down a hand over his broad hairy chest. &quot;I&#39;m still not sure about this. People will think I&#39;m some cave man or bigfoot. Everybody would be looking at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alibaba smiled again. &quot;You will be admired, respected, and lusted after. Humans will see you as a celebrity, an artist, someone to admire. Go forth, my young master! I will come with you. This will be amus... interesting for me. I have not used my powers quite this way in millennia.&quot;<br />
<br />
The djinn could see curiosity growing in the man&#39;s eyes. It took only a few moments for Scott to decide and head for the door. &quot;Maybe you should see what are you packing.&quot; Alibaba smiled while he snapped his fingers. It happened so fast that Scott didn&#39;t have time to react.</p>
