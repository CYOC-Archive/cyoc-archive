<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few days passed since Aaron gave birth, and during that time she was weak and had slowly recovered her strength. The eggs she had laid were all distributed to their respective fathers. Astor explained to her that the drake who fathers an egg from a broodmother like her is responsible for warming it and looking after it so that she could continue with her duties. However, in the case of the few that shared her scale color it would be impossible to determine the father of them until they had hatched, so the ones sharing Aaron&#39;s scales were just divided up amongst the fathers evenly, or as evenly as possible. Aaron did feel slightly disappointed that it had to be this way, but Astor made arrangements for her other husbands to live on the same floor of the hotel as her and keep the eggs close by for her and the hatchlings sakes so she wasn&#39;t too heartbroken over the situation.<br />
<br />
For now she sighed to herself as she rubbed her bulging gut and tore into a the leg of a turkey and tearing off a huge chunk with her razor sharp teeth. She wasn&#39;t used to dragon cultures yet, but she was so far content with the role she played within it. She took another bite out of the turkey leg after swallowing the first when she heard the sound of heavy thumping coming towards her room, and accompanied by the sound of claws and tails dragging against the floor no less. She wasn&#39;t the only broodmother on this level of the hotel, but the musky scent her nose picked up definitely belonged to her beloved Astor and as fate would have it when she looked to the doorway Aaron watched her beloved drake walk on in with a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
Of course Aaron would smile back at Astor as he pulled her aside to the bed and took a seat with her, placing his hand on her cheek and rubbing it lovingly before pulling Aaron into a deep and passionate kiss. Whenever this happened Aaron felt her heart skip a beat, especially when she felt her first lover&#39;s tongue explore the insides of her muzzle while she explored his. Eventually Astor broke the kiss and sighed with content and asked,&quot;How is my sweet mother recovering?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron smiled, taking Astor&#39;s hand and wrapping her tail around Astor&#39;s and replied,&quot;I feel as nice as I did that first night we met. Except without the slight confusion and denial I had about how exhilarating it feels to fall in love with a man, and being a woman.&quot; Aaron giggled after she said that last part and Astor chuckled as well and replied,&quot;Any aches or pains?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron shook her head and replied,&quot;My womb the day after I laid those eggs hurt like a bitch, and yesterday it was pretty much numb. But like you said today it&#39;s practically fully healed, although I can&#39;t promise it&#39;ll stretch all the same like it did that first night~&quot;<br />
<br />
Astor grinned and caressed Aaron&#39;s thigh with his hand, nodding,&quot;You should tighten back up in no time. It is as I keep saying, you should never underestimate that body of yours~&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron smirked and reached up, gently rubbing Astor&#39;s muscled arm,&quot;And with that comment should I expect my Master wants to show me some love, or perhaps you wish to indulge in something more... kinky~&quot;<br />
<br />
To Aaron&#39;s surprise however, Astor would shake his head and then he took hold of both Aaron&#39;s hands. &quot;Not today my dear, but worry not I&#39;ll be back to take you again tomorrow~&quot; Astor said grinning in a low deep growl,&quot;Today, my dear Aaron, I thought that I should instead continue to &quot;expand your horizons&quot; like we have been since you arrived in my lap all those days ago~&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you are offering me to another one of your elite guards? An older veteran maybe? I do enjoy the other drakes Master, though I feel they value me more as breeding stock, then again they do treat me like a wife~&quot; Aaron replied then paused and had a thought, and gave Astor a sly grin,&quot;Or perhaps you are going to introduce me to a woman, and have her show me what sex with a woman as a woman is like~? I&#39;ve always wanted to try that since I got used to the males here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Astor would let out a loud and hardy laugh before giving Aaron a nice smack on her ass, causing the dragoness to let out a loud moan and producing a loud clap that echoed throughout the floor. Aaron felt herself grow wet from this and she would immediately pull Astor into a hug and seductively lick his chest, tasting all the dirt and sweat on it before looking up at him,&quot;Mmm~ You certainly are naughty to me~ I love the way you manhandle me sometimes~&quot;<br />
<br />
Astor would smile once more then sigh and his expression became serious,&quot;Now then in all seriousness we must speak. Do you still remember what we promised each other moments before you joined us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron&#39;s eyes would widen as Astor brought this up and she would slowly nod,&quot;I-I do... yeah....although.... why do you bring this up? I mean haven&#39;t I been holding up my half of it pretty well?&quot;<br />
<br />
Astor would shake his head,&quot;It isn&#39;t that at all, it is about your step-sister, Emily.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron&#39;s heart sank when she heard this and she would grasp onto Astor&#39;s hand tightly, giving him her full attention. He then sighed and looked Aaron in the eyes,&quot;We found Emily yesterday, and as I stated earlier, they would eventually be transformed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Aaron suddenly roared,&quot;Wait what do you mean by &quot;We&quot;?! I thought you said you would try to stop anyone from getting to her!&quot; Aaron wasn&#39;t sure whether she should be mad at Astor or not, but she knew she couldn&#39;t since she was just a simple broodmother. But then she noticed something about Astor&#39;s gaze that spelled regret, and apologetic.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the time I arrived it was too late. You see while us dragons now rule over this world now, a nesting site I was in the other day was under attack. I saw one of our own turning a human girl like any other, and then remembered the description you gave me about your sibling.&quot; Astor said,&quot;And what happened afterwards was... well.... surprising to say the least.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron looked up at Astor with concerned and worried eyes,&quot;W-What do you mean... I...?&quot; Aaron started before Astor guided Aaron&#39;s claw to his back, and Aaron felt bandages going down the middle of his back that were damp with blood. Aaron fell silent and Astor exclaimed,&quot;After transforming Emily attacked me, and I let my guard down. Of course I was holding back because of our promise, but I got careless and paid the price. I was able to calm Emily down, and explained what happened to you as well as our promise. They are... adjusting let&#39;s say... but I will say that they make a very valuable asset.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron blushed brightly after learning Astor told Emily about her own situation then paused, &quot;Asset...? What do you mean...? Where is she?! Is she hurt?!&quot; Aaron asked frantically before Astor covered Aaron&#39;s mouth and shushed her,&quot;Shhh... they are fine, healthy, although lucky. If I had not been there then they would likely be dead or a prisoner for attacking someone like me. I made a deal with Emily, I bring them here and show them you are safe and allow you to talk with them, and they would submit to me a-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh bullshit Astor!!&quot; A male voice roared out from the doorway to Aaron&#39;s room, and peering over Aaron saw a large buff male drake comparable to Astor. His scales were pale white and his eyes were read, then his spikes, belly scales, and horns were golden. He also had a few bruises, and claw marks that were bandaged up along his chest and arms like Astor had on his back. &quot;The deal was you take me to see my brother, and I would consider settling down! I never promised anything along submitting, and I&#39;m still pissed about this whole situation! Now show me my broth-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;E-Emily.....?!&quot; Aaron roared out suddenly, and surprised and suddenly the white drake looked at her and pausing before squinting before his eyes widened,&quot;A-Aaron...? What the hell happened to you?! Did this fucker do this to you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily would cast a glare at Astor who would glare back and look ready for a fight. &quot;I recommend choosing your next words wisely. I told you this is my territory, and don&#39;t think my breeding dens are unguarded.&quot; Astor replied which made Emily roar,&quot;BREEDING WHAT?! Okay! I-!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that Aaron wrapped her arms around Emily&#39;s body and hugged him tightly. &quot;Emily wait! It was all my choice okay?! I was trying to protect you!&quot; Aaron cried out and Emily looked down at Aaron with eyes wide before dropping his guard,&quot;W-What....?&quot;<br />
<br />
Astor then sighed and stood up, looking at Emily,&quot;It&#39;s as I explained before, the two of us made a deal back whe-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it from you right now okay?!&quot; Emily growled at Astor and blushing brightly,&quot;I-If this really is my o-older brother... leave us alone for awhile... o-okay?!&quot; Aaron was confused now, why did Emily go from acting like a big tough man to embarrassed just like that? That was when Aaron&#39;s nose twitched, picking up on a very potent and familiar scent to her draconic nostril slits. Her eyes then peered down her step-sister turned step-brother&#39;s body and noticed a dark barked tip of a cock poking its head out of its scaled sheath.<br />
<br />
Astor remained silent then sighed,&quot;If you must hear the same story through her mouth then so be it. But afterwards Emily, we need to talk about your actions today.&quot; With this Astor stood up and looked at Aaron before smiling at her for reassurance and leaving the room, giving Aaron and Emily the space they needed to talk.<br />
<br />
The first thing that happened was that Aaron explained everything that happened from start to finish after Emily went to bed that day up until a few days ago when she laid eggs. After the explanations Emily looked at Aaron, the two sitting on the bed Aaron has shared with many drakes already. &quot;So in a nutshell, you made a deal with Astor to spare me in exchange for becoming  breeding stock for him?&quot; Emily replied and Aaron blushed brightly and muttered,&quot;A-And others.... whenever I or someone else wants it essentially....&quot;<br />
<br />
With this Emily sighed, and turned away to hide the blush on his face. &quot;Aaron... I&#39;m pissed... and if I didn&#39;t take my anger out on Astor earlier, then I would not afraid of hitting a woman... even a pregnant one like you just to prove a point....&quot; He growled then sighed,&quot;God that sounds horrible, but you understand what I mean right?! If all of this was happening right outside our house, why didn&#39;t you grab me and run?! Seriously Aaron I thought you were dead!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry okay... it was all I could think of at the time...&quot; Aaron gulped trying to ignore the musk Emily was giving off, and she could tell Emily&#39;s new hormones were playing hell with him right now. His cock was fully erect and drooling at the tip, if it were with anyone else Aaron would jump to ride or suck a cock like Emily&#39;s in an instant. It wasn&#39;t as big as Astor&#39;s but the beefy drake was second only by about an inch or two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron... I...&quot; Emily sighed before turning towards his new step-sister,&quot;I don&#39;t hate you for this, but why did you have to just do this?! And what&#39;s more you&#39;re body is so fucking hot that it&#39;s distracting!! Even as a milf your breasts and hips look so...!&quot; Emily then paused and Aaron blushed brightly, Aaron felt her pussy making her thighs grow slick and Emily now noticed just how much precum dribbled down his now throbbing cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;D-Did you mean to say that all out loud...?&quot; Aaron muttered and Emily simply blushed brightly and shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you seriously attracted to me...? I&#39;m your sister A-Aaron, come o-!&quot; Emily began then Aaron interrupted,&quot;And yet you&#39;re attracted to me if that hard on is any indication.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s face flushed red beneath his scales and looked down at his dick. &quot;I-Is that what this means....?&quot; He asked as he gently grabbed his shaft with his hand,&quot;I-I thought it just did this every now and then, and sometimes I need to take a piss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron tilted her head,&quot;You&#39;ve been a dragon for a day now... and you must&#39;ve encountered a female like me in order to become a male. Emily have you seriously not well.... fucked someone yet... or at least jerk yourself off...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-No!! I don&#39;t know how okay?! This body has been driving me insane! I can&#39;t stop thinking about shoving my dick into...!&quot; Emily then paused and blushed before sighing.<br />
<br />
Aaron would then place her hand the claw Emily had on his cock, and she smiled slightly at him. &quot;You must be so pent up, poor guy... it&#39;s a huge rush the first time when you transform huh? You seriously didn&#39;t get even oral from the dragoness who turned you?&quot; Aaron started rubbing Emily&#39;s cock sensually now and looking up into his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I pushed her away okay...? If I wasn&#39;t so horny I might&#39;ve actually been able to beat that boyfriend of yours into a bloody pulp... and it&#39;s only gotten wor-aaagh~! God you are so hot! Why does it feel so good when you do that~?&quot; Emily moaned out and leaned back, and Aaron giggled,&quot;Maybe I can break you~? Be your first~? I am only your step-sibling so we aren&#39;t really related~&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily blushed brightly and snarled,&quot;I-I... grrrgh! Damn you.... Aaron if I wasn&#39;t desperate I would tell you to piss off.... but.... fuck~ your hands are magic~&quot; Emily began panting and Aaron sighed,&quot;There there, let big sis show ya how to be a man okay? How about I help you blow one load off and if you still have some juice left in you I&#39;ll let you give me a few eggs~?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily would look into Aaron&#39;s eyes and mutter,&quot;F-Fine.... S-Since when were you such a slut...?&quot; <br />
<br />
Aaron would laugh at the comment,&quot;I&#39;m not alone anymore since us dragons breed like rabbits pretty much. I doubt I&#39;ll be your first lady, and since you were lucky enough to become a man then maybe you could get a kobold for yourself eh big guy~?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily gulped and would slowly nod,&quot;F-Fuck you, Aaron... for the last month...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually Em you should say, Fuck me Aaron, for at least the next month~ Since that&#39;s how long it will take for me to lay my next clutch~&quot; Aaron giggled then got down on her knees in front of Emily and gently licked the tip of his penis.<br />
<br />
Emily blushed and watched, grunting softly as Aaron took the lead. Aaron would slowly slide Emily&#39;s cock into her mouth and start sucking on it like she did Astor&#39;s cock that fateful night. She would slowly take in every inch of it, feeling the barbs against the roof of her mouth as well as the throbbing feeling of it in the back of her throat. She closed her eyes getting a warm and comforting feeling with Emily like she did from Astor when she was bred full of eggs. Aaron&#39;s hands would gently caress Emily&#39;s balls and Aaron inhaled countless amounts of Emily&#39;s musk. Before long, Emily would roar out and Aaron would feel and taste Emily&#39;s salty load as it pumped down her throat and she pulled off, allowing some of Emily&#39;s cum to drip down her front onto her breasts as she licked her lips.<br />
<br />
Aaron coughed slightly, not because she didn&#39;t like the taste or the feeling. In fact she enjoyed the taste of Emily&#39;s salty cum as much as she enjoyed Astor&#39;s, but Emily was clearly a novice and she didn&#39;t expect him to cum so soon. &quot;Emily that was barely a whole minute dear, I was expecting at least some resistance there from a guy like you.&quot; Aaron would comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-Fuck off, that was my first time,&quot; Emily panted before glaring at Aaron,&quot;Don&#39;t you think I don&#39;t know how to stick this in you, I&#39;ve seen just how the other guys do it with humans!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh~? So you won&#39;t have a problem giving it to me then huh, step bro~?&quot; Aaron replied in a teasing manner before sitting on Emily&#39;s lap and whispering in his ear,&quot;Your choice, top or bottom~&quot;<br />
<br />
With this Emily would gulp seeing what has become of his sister, and realizing that at this point he wasn&#39;t much better for allowing Aaron to do what she just did. The only question now was, was he really prepared to go through with this?</p>
