<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She chose the costume of....an Amish man? It came complete with Black shoes, dark navy blue corduroy plants with suspenders, a white button-down shirt, a straw hate, and a dark Amish-cut beard. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aaand...I&#39;ll choose for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
She found a donkey outfit, complete even with a large black donkey dong!<br />
<br />
Laughing, I said &quot;I can&#39;t wear this out in public! That&#39;s nasty!&quot; It even had a funky barnyard stink to it! <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on! It&#39;ll be fun! I&#39;ll be an Amish farmer, and you&#39;ll be my donkey!&quot;<br />
<br />
Smiling at the utter ridiculous silliness of it, I figured, &quot;why not?&quot; It is, after all, Halloween. And this was going to be your first adult Halloween party tonight. It was sure to garner a laugh or two. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, fine.&quot; I said to my girlfriend, Talia. &quot;I&#39;ll go as a donkey, giant black dick and all.&quot; <br />
<br />
But that smell! It really did smell like a donkey! Like it belonged out on a farm field or in a barn. Would I really put something on that smelled like that? But it was a two-for-one price special, and I just told Talia I would do it. She was excited at the prospect. <br />
<br />
You both go up to the cashier to pay for the purchase. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes!&quot; the strange cashier lady said. &quot;An Amish man and his donkey. So which of you is going to be the donkey?&quot; she asked out of curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; I said. &quot;And she&#39;s going as an Amish man.&quot; <br />
<br />
The lady chuckled. &quot;Isn&#39;t that nice? Here. You&#39;ll need this.&quot; She handed over a scroll-looking thing. It was a cheap 21st century American-made scroll designed to look like it was an ancient scroll. But was obviously fake. It wouldn&#39;t even fool a five year old. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is this?&quot; Talia asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s a reversal spell. One-use only. Whoever speaks the words on this scroll, will return back to their former selves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God,&quot; I think to yourself as I roll my eyes, &quot;one of THOSE people.&quot; Talia seemed to think the same thing. Neither of us believed in any sort of hocus-pocus, psuedoscience, or conspiracy theory bullshit. But rather than debate with this random nutty ass lady, we both accepted the scroll, paid for our items, smiled, and left the costume shop as the lady sighed and rolled her own eyes and went back to work. <br />
<br />
&quot;What a nutbag,&quot; I said to Talia as she started laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should have seen your face,&quot; she said. &quot;That little smirk of yours was cute, the way you tried hiding what I was thinking.&quot; <br />
<br />
Yeah. I smirk whenever I try to hide something. Which is why I refuse to ever play poker with my girlfriend whenever we go to AC in the summer. She reads me like a book. <br />
<br />
Anyway, we take our items and head back to my place to try them on. It was last minute shopping for the great Halloween party tonight at our friends&#39; house.  When we get there, we had decided to try our costumes in at the same timein different rooms. I had a small place. Just a bedroom, a living room/kitchen mix, and the bathroom. I gave Talia my bedroom to change in, and I took the spacious living room. It turned out to be a good thing I did that. Well. Good for my former apartment anyway. <br />
<br />
She went into the bedroom with her things and closed the door. Sighing, I pull out the smelly donkey costume. I set it down and looked it over. The gray and white fur looked real enough. The heapiece was pretty good too. Even the teeth looked real enough. Big, greenish-yellow blocky teeth. It actually looked kinda scary. And the big black dick was a floppy rubbery affair. Complete with two large wobbly rubber balls that hang low. <br />
<br />
There is a hole along what would be the spine of the costume. I guess I just widen it out and step in. I strip down to do so. But boy! That smell! I could swear I&#39;ll be stuck with that smell on my body for a week, just by wearing it. (Turns out, I would be stuck smelling like this permanently!)<br />
<br />
I step one foot into the costume, and settle my foot into what&#39;s supposed to be the right read leg and hoof. I then reach in with my right hand to grab the end of the inside of the right front hoof to begin pulling the costume up and over my shoulder. I duck down to begin shoving my head and upper body in, as I step my left foot into it&#39;s proper place. And finally shove my left arm into it&#39;s proper hold. All that was left, was to stand up inside the costume and position my head inside the headpiece. <br />
<br />
As I was about to shove my head into the head piece, I suddenly hear the voice of a young man behind me in the doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Mike. There&#39;s something.....wrong....&quot;<br />
<br />
But too late. I had already shoved my head up into place inside the headpiece. At that very moment I immediately felt a sickening dizzy vertigo overcome me as an indescribably sparkly feeling was felt throughout my entire body. I closed my eyes, afraid I was going to throw up.<br />
<br />
My body pitched forward. I reached my costumed hands to catch my fall on the kitchen floor. Two realistic &#39;clip&#39; noises occurred one-after-the-other in quick succession on the cheap linoleum floor. I stood there on all fours for a moment or two catching my breath through some regged breathing, not realizing that would now forever be my new stance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no!&quot; I hear that same man&#39;s voice, but clearer and louder. I started feeling better all the sudden, not realizing I was still on all fours as I opened my eyes. Immediately, I knew something was wrong. My eyesight! It was.....strange....Colors were muted and blurry, and it was like I was looking in two directions at once! That&#39;s when I took my very first bray.....<br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaawww?&quot; I asked. Or at least. Tried to ask! I knew immediately that was a donkey&#39;s bray that escaped my lips, rather than a word! And it sounded realistic! Too realistic! <br />
<br />
I tried again, this time breathing in to catch my breathe some more before attempting to speak....<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrghhh hhhhaawwww!&quot;<br />
<br />
I froze. What. The. FUCK!?&quot; I thought in fright, denial, and growing realization.<br />
<br />
&quot;You too!&quot; I heard that man say. <br />
<br />
Still mostly frozen and actively denying what had just occurred, I look over sideways towards the direction of my bedroom door. I see standing there, a somewhat blurry image of an Amish man! As well as a large round donkey rump in my peripheral vision with a tail flicking in and out of view that I can actually feel as it swayed! <br />
<br />
&quot;Errrrghhh hhhhaawww!&quot; I bray again. Again, unable to speak! <br />
<br />
The Amish man, which turned out to be my girlfriend, Talia, began to panic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no...oh no....oh God!&quot; he said over and over again. It still hadn&#39;t fully registered in my brain what had happened to us. &quot;I&#39;m a man! And.....and....and....you&#39;re a DONKEY!&quot; she said to me.<br />
<br />
Hearing those words. Directed at me. &quot;You&#39;re a DONKEY!&quot; Thats when it hit me, even as I tried to deny it! I am not! &quot;Errrgghhh hhhhaawww errrrghhhh....hhhhhaaaawww....&quot;<br />
<br />
I begin to look around at the body that extended out behind me. I realized I was still on all fours, and tried standing up. But I was locked in that position! I tried my hands, but they wouldn&#39;t budge! They were hard and completely immobile! Stuck in....in....in the shape of....hooves! <br />
<br />
&quot;Errrghh hhhaawww!&quot; My hands! I don&#39;t have hands! &quot;Errrghh hhhaaww eerrrgghh hhhaaww errrghhh hhhaaww!&quot; <br />
<br />
For that matter, I couldn&#39;t even speak! <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when I started to panic. But the difference between me and Talia, is that I was stuck as a large 500 lb farm animal! Needless to say, I apparently made quite a racket and tore up the kitchen and living room. I couldn&#39;t stand up on two legs, which is mostly what I was trying to do. I also couldn&#39;t speak, and had no useable hands! <br />
<br />
Eventually, Talia as an Amish man, eventually got me to settle down. She reminded me of the scroll that could reverse this.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s one-time-&quot; &quot;errrgghh hhhaaww eerrghh hhhaaww-&quot; I stopped, realizing it was useless to try and speak. I was a donkey, and donkeys can&#39;t speak! &quot;-use only&quot; I was going to finish. <br />
<br />
But &quot;she&quot; also thought of the scroll. She also remembered what that strange cashier lady had said. It was one-time use only. So which of us gets to use it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Here. You can use it,&quot; she said sadly. &quot;You&#39;re the one that&#39;s worse off....&quot; <br />
<br />
I started to reach out to grab it, but we both noticed at the same time that I don&#39;t have hands! I kept forgetting that, and still do to this day,! And let me tell you. It SUCKS! It SUCKS, not having hands! It sucks having hard immobile useless donkey hooves! I can&#39;t DO anything except to walk on them! They&#39;re forever stuck to the ground! And worse yet, my energy at trying to flex non-existent hands is instead, directed at extending my ridiculous smelly male appendage instead! Which always then makes me horny, but it&#39;s so disgusting.....anyway, that&#39;s a story for another time.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, She let out a little &quot;oh. I guess you need help with that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need help with that,&quot; she said. That was the first time that I realized that the signal my brain tries to send to my &quot;hands,&quot; goes towards my huge dick instead. I got hard, as it ballooned out. Talia noticed of course, and said &quot;oh gross!&quot; under her breath. But my sharpened donkey hearing heard that, and it was humiliating. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haawww,&quot; I started to protest, but stopped. Realizing for about the 13ty time I can no longer speak! <br />
<br />
Talia looked up at me with those completely unfamiliar manly dark eyes. Hers were formerly blue. She unrolled the scroll, and told me to read it off. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when I got even hornier yet, for I knew that was a problem! &quot;Uh, oh,&quot; errrggh hhhaaww....<br />
<br />
On top of that, I also realized....I can&#39;t read! I tried looking at the words on the scroll. Besides the fact that my eyesight isn&#39;t very good to begin with, my brain couldn&#39;t understand the scribbling I could barely even see! <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on! You can do it! Just. Read it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Errrrghh hhhaaww! <br />
<br />
Oh God! I can&#39;t speak! I can&#39;t read! I&#39;m going to be-! I&#39;m going to be....stuck as a fucking DONKEY!? <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, no, no! I can&#39;t be stuck as a ducking donkey! I cant- I can&#39;t live the rest of my life as a god damn DONKEY!&quot;<br />
<br />
I went into a second round of frenzied panic, which sent Talia running to the bedroom with the scroll! I hopped and skipped and brayed my ass off. Kicking, bray-screaming, the whole nine yards for God knows how long. Protesting against the body I&#39;ve been stuck with ever since that fateful day. I couldn&#39;t at the very least, have hands, or to be able to speak! I still am not used to the fact that I don&#39;t have hands nor have the ability to speak! <br />
<br />
Anyway, I eventually DID calm down, but not before I destroyed the floors and walls of the apartment even further. Looking around the place, I wondered at the destruction! Wtf did I just DO to my place!? Hell, my tv,! My poor tv! And the comuter hooked to the TV! My gaming rig,! I knocked it over! <br />
<br />
&quot;Errrghh hhhaaww!&quot; I brayed at it. Forgetting for a moment all over again that I&#39;m a god damn donkey! I looked down at what should be arms, but are instead, gray-fur-clad donkey legs with those annoying big black fucking HOOVES! <br />
<br />
I started laughing. Or at least, tried to. It just came out as a ragged braying. &quot;Errghh hhaaww errrghh hhaaww errrgghh hhhaaw!&quot; I can&#39;t even laugh! But I found it funny in that moment, my immediate concern about the possible destruction of my apartment and my things. Especially my gaming computer. It was funny in that moment, because I was stuck as a donkey and couldn&#39;t even play on my computer to begin with, even if it weren&#39;t knocked over and possibly broken! <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when I heard my bedroom door softly open, and the voice of my girlfriend, Talia?<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike?&quot; she softly called my name. &quot;Are.....are you.....are you ok....?&quot; She asked timidly from behind the door. <br />
<br />
Her voice! HER voice! Not his! That means.....that means she...used the scroll! If she doesn&#39;t sound like a man, she used the single-user scroll! Which means....<br />
<br />
Oh. GOD! I&#39;m to be stuck as...as...the smelly donkey that I am! <br />
<br />
&quot;No! No! I can&#39;t be! I can&#39;t be a....a...a....DONKEY!&quot; I thought. <br />
<br />
I left out yet another god damn bray, as I tried to keep yet another panic attack at bay. I was breathing heavily, as I weighed what my future might look like. I imagined having to be stuck out in a field all day. Donkeys are grazers. Like cows and horses. They weigh in at hundreds of pounds and eat tons of grass, hay, and oats. They must graze all day long, just to keep their large bodies fed. MY large body....Fuck! <br />
<br />
I looked around again at my right flank that ended in a rounded rump that looked like the shape of a loaf of bread. I saw what I would now have to refer to as my HIND legs. At least, from my perspective looking around my right flank, my right &quot;HIND&quot; legs. I looked down at my right &quot;arm,&quot; and only saw the right front leg and hoof of a fucking donkey!<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike....? If you&#39;re still in there, Please...please don&#39;t be mad at me....I....I used the scroll....&quot;<br />
<br />
She sounded scared! Of me? Perhaps. &quot;Errrghh hhhaaww,&quot; I tried to respond. Fuck! This not being able to speak thing was getting pretty old pretty fast. It would be far from the last time I forgot that I can&#39;t say anything other than &quot;errrghh hhhaaww!&quot; <br />
<br />
I did think about the shop where we got the costumes. That shop! Of course! Maybe I wasn&#39;t doomed to live out my life as a god damn farm animal! <br />
<br />
I looked back around and over at Talia and....brayed! Errrggh hhhhaaww- God dammit! Fuck! This was so damn frustrating that I couldn&#39;t even speak my mind! Hell, with big blocky clumsy hooves, I couldn&#39;t even write! I couldn&#39;t even search in my brain how to even spell! Why the fuck did I lose my ability to read and write, but not my ability to understand the spoken word? Perhaps because donkeys don&#39;t need to know how to read and write.... But that&#39;s silly. They also don&#39;t need to understand the complexities of language either....well.....at least I still had that and hadn&#39;t lost my own identity. Even if the world would just see and hear a common by jackass by looking at me. <br />
<br />
Anyway. To the store! Since it was a two-for-one special, and it came with a reversal scroll, perhaps all we need to do, was purchase two more costumes! And get another scroll! Yeah! I&#39;ll have my hands back. I&#39;ll be back on two legs!<br />
<br />
Excited by my plan, I....BRAYED! Again! &quot;Errrghhh hhhsawww!&quot;<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s when it hit me! I. Can&#39;t. Fucking TALK! My temporary high at my genius plan came crashing down around me! If I can&#39;t talk, I won&#39;t be able to recite whatever is written on a magic scroll! That&#39;s what the lady said! The one who is to go back to normal, is the one who had to read the scroll!<br />
<br />
But maybe. Just maybe. A scroll that needs to be read isn&#39;t the only form of reversal? Yeah! Maybe! Now I felt a certain level of nervousness creep in, as I forced myself to remain in control at the possibility of that costume shop having a different method from the one prescribed....<br />
<br />
Now all that needs to happen, is to communicate with Talia and get her to go to the store in the hopes of fixing me....<br />
<br />
&quot;Errrghh hhhaaww!&quot; Well, trying to talk isn&#39;t going to work. I stamp my right front hoof on the floor. Writing won&#39;t work either, besides the fact that I wouldn&#39;t even know HOW to write! <br />
<br />
I smelled something funny on Talia. My brain came up with the word &quot;fear.&quot; It was more of an instinctual understanding, rather than one explained in a single human word. But it was the fear of an angry or upset animal that is much larger than she is. Great! I don&#39;t need her to be afraid of me! I have to keep my anxiety at being trapped as a horny, smelly donkey. Have to keep my panic at bay at not having hands. Or a voice. At being stuck on all fours like a lowly animal.....<br />
<br />
Stifling my anxiety, I tried to form at least one word. The simplest word to say that I could think of that would be helpful. &quot;Come.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaww!&quot;<br />
<br />
 Dammit! Curling my lips up in what must have been an amusing fashion (I was NOT amused myself!) I tried again:<br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaw!&quot; <br />
<br />
Dammit! Again! If I can&#39;t fucking speak, how do I tell her my plan!? Or at least, to follow me!?<br />
<br />
She just stood in the doorway after chuckling at my last attempt to talk and stared at me. Getting frustrated, I stamped a hoof and half-turned my big ugly body and flung my big ugly long face in the direction I was turning. Turning towards the door to my apartment to get out. <br />
<br />
&quot;You....you want me to follow you?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; I thought. I nodded my big ugly head up and down as vigorously as I could, but it was awkward as hell. &quot;errghh hhaaw!&quot; I was forced to bray in excitement. <br />
<br />
I took a few of my first controlled non-panicking steps as a donkey towards my door. It was weird, to be forced to walk on all fours. Also a little alarming, especially with the &quot;clip-clop&quot; noise of hard hooves on a hard surface floor. <br />
<br />
I came to the door, and realized....I can&#39;t open doors! Even something as simple as a doorknob is impossible for a donkey to handle! <br />
<br />
&quot;Errghh hhhaaw-!&quot; <br />
<br />
Dammit! STILL can&#39;t fucking speak! I looked back at the loaf-shaped body that extends back behind my long neck. &quot;I swear to God, I better not be stuck as a fucking god damn donkey for the rest of my life,&quot; I thought. &quot;What the hell would I do in this condition?&quot;<br />
<br />
But I knew the answer to that question: probably be stuck in a field somewhere eating nothing but grass all day every day....<br />
<br />
Nevermind that thought! Talia had to open the door for me. I had to get Talia back to the store. And Talia would have to pick out two more costumes. Then Talia would have to somehow dress me in whatever costume she would choose for me-! <br />
<br />
Wait a second! But of course! I may not be able to speak now, but a human costume would at least turn me back to human, and I would be able to speak then!<br />
<br />
A human costume....the body I currently have would have to be able to FIT into a human costume. I&#39;m a beast, a farm animal, that has to weigh several hundred pounds at least. And my shape isn&#39;t exactly conducive to wearing any sort of costume. Course, if this cursed donkey costume got me to grow to the proper size and shape of a donkey by magic, presumably a smaller costume would do the same. <br />
<br />
But anyway. Come on, Talia! Open the fucking door! I looked right at her. At least, as much as I could. She just stood back there hesitating while I was contemplating how I get out of this situation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Errrgghh hhhaaaaaaaaaaaewwww!!&quot; I brayed impatiently at her and stamped a hooved front foot. She seemed to get the message as she quickly move to along my right flank, still smelling the fear on her. She gripped the knob, and started opening the door. I had to back up to let it swing open all the way. <br />
<br />
Good! Now.... Oh shit! The door looks narrow! Too narrow for my large frame. I seemed to be getting a good idea of the space that this damn body takes up. And thinking even further ahead, the steps are to the right of the doorway, and the balcony itself was quite narrow!<br />
<br />
I had to try though. I stepped up to my threshold, squeezed, and got stuck! With several frustrated brays, I somehow managed to shimmy my way through the door. I heard something on the frame break. One of my rear hooves stepped on and pushed off the bottom threshold thing, and I heard that snap! <br />
<br />
&quot;Errrggghhh hhhaaww!&quot; I brayed, again, out of frustration. Finally through, getting down the steps was the next challenge. My body was slightly wider than the steps. I had to concentrate on forcing my way down them. Even with concentrating on this task, the sound of my hard front hooves on the wooden steps was not lost on me. No sensitive hands. Just plain old hard insensitive hooves. Jesus, they suck! I need my hands back!<br />
<br />
&quot;,The only way to get them back, is by getting Talia to that costume store at the mall. And the only way of doing that, is by remaining calm,&quot; I told myself as I carefully and methodically made my way down these awkward made-for-human steps. <br />
<br />
Finally at the bottom of the steps, I made my way around the building towards my car. I picked my girlfriend up, so her car wasn&#39;t here. It was getting dark out. Almost ti.e for that Halloween party! Because of the growing darkness and the way the lighting was in the driveway, it made for the perfect reflection of my face from the car window! Boy, I was NOT prepared to see myself! To see &quot;my&quot; face.&quot; Or rather, to see the face of a donkey reflected back at me, RATHER than my face! <br />
<br />
At first, I wondered what a donkey was doing there, not realizing for a moment that *I* was that donkey! That head was *MY* head! I blew a snort at the window, and saw the donkey&#39;s already wide nostrils flare. Just as I felt my nostrils flare! That&#39;s when it hit me! Again!<br />
<br />
While I was &quot;sort of&quot; getting used to the idea of being irritated not to have hands and not being able to speak; of seeing and feeling the loaf-shaped body behind me and thinking of myself stuck as a donkey, I was NOT aware of just what I actually LOOKED like! <br />
<br />
That really long broad face. Those big dull brown eyes. That was now me! I was behind those eyes! I was behind that face! I was....I was....breathing through those huge disgusting nostrils! And those big black lips, and huge slablike teeth behind them! They were now mine! And that big sloppy tongue! <br />
<br />
Oh God! No! <br />
<br />
I started breathing heavy. Pulling in air through those disgusting nostrils and mouth! I started feeling sick. I had the mouth and nose of a fucking farm animal! And the more I breathed through it and experienced the intake of breathe through that nose and mouth, the monster disgusted I became! I was  permanently being forced to suck through a donkey&#39;s nose and mouth! <br />
<br />
I started braying in disgust. Stomping my right hoof. Caught a glimpse of the donkey head that was now me, crowned by big tall broad donkey ears! I was now overcome by shame, on top of disgust! <br />
<br />
&quot;Errghhh hhaaww eerrgghh hhaaww eerrgghh hhhaaww!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mike....Mike! Mike! Calm down! Mike! Do you hear me? Please! Just. Calm down, please! We&#39;ll figure a way out of this, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
My girlfriend&#39;s voice cut through my rising panic. <br />
<br />
&quot;,Ok? Do you understand me?&quot; <br />
<br />
I looked at her with what must of looked like the unintelligent dull eyes of a farm animal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike? Are you....are you still in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
I can&#39;t make facial expressions, even if I tried. Definitely not involuntarily like humans do in order to convey understanding in a communicative manner. I just looked at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Please! Mike! Please! Please tell me you&#39;re still in there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Errggh hhaaww!&quot; I brayed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re slipping away, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;She thinks I&#39;m becoming a regular dumb old donkey!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Errggh hhhaaww!&quot; I brayed at her. Again! Well. Fuck! That won&#39;t work! I still cannot talk! My face and mouth and such is still freaking me out, but I really have to maintain control here! <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when it happened. Piss! I felt it gush up my long black exposed penis! I started pissing! I forgot I was even naked! I was pissing in the middle of my driveway! My giant donkey dong exposed for the world to see! <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeeewwww!!&quot; Talia shrieked as she stepped back. <br />
<br />
And that was it! My total and utter humiliation and disgust was complete! I wouldn&#39;t even want my human face to show up in front of her ever again. As a matter of fact, I was sort of glad I WAS a donkey in that moment. At least I have the excuse that I was just a poor lowly beast that doesn&#39;t know the first thing about manners.....<br />
<br />
And that was it for me. I gave up in that moment. I was so utterly. So fantastically humiliated. The only thing left to do. A rash decision that I didn&#39;t think fully through in that moment. Ignore her as if I didn&#39;t understand her. Which was easy enough to do with this face and these eyes. That&#39;s all anyone would ever see when looking at me today still. Just a dumb unintelligent donkey. You would have no idea that an actual human mind resides inside the skull of one of the animals strewn around a large grassy field in the middle of bumfuck Kansas. Which is where I was ultimately transported to from the east coast.</p>
