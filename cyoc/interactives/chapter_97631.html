<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frances felt a bit tired from the fight against Yvette as she, Martha, and William moved to sit down in the dinning room while her brother pulled out a notepad from his breast pocket on his uniform. She glanced to see Martha and William holding each other&#39;s paws with a look of relief on their faces. Frances understood that as with Yvette now back in police custody and would likely be kept under much tighter security, the two of them wouldn&#39;t have to worry about the vixen coming after them or after Eric. To a great extent, Frances felt the same feelings of relief for Eric&#39;s safety. He was a smart boy and while he was nervous over plenty of things that related to Moon Lake&#39;s were-beast population, he did seem to be doing very well with adapting and had actually found love blooming between him and the mayor&#39;s daughter. The fact that Yvette wouldn&#39;t be able to threaten him anymore gave Frances a strong feeling of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... sis,&quot; Samson said to her, &quot;this is rather basic, but we will need to get your statement regarding what happened here today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sis?&quot; came a question from Martha and William.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember how I told you that my family moved here to Moon Lake?&quot; Frances said to Martha, and after Martha nodded, &quot;Well, as I said, I was too young to be changed but my family all choose to become weredogs... and when my &quot;turn&quot; came, if I hadn&#39;t already had sex with Samantha but wasn&#39;t old enough to change yet, I would have become a weredog too...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though in the end it doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Samson gave a soft smile, &quot;You&#39;re still pack... family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances nodded. Despite some of the issues she&#39;d had with her parents over being a lesbian werecat, Samson had always been the most understanding. It was very much like something that Frances remembered from when she was three. The family had had an old foxhound that had been in family for years. One day, Frances had brought home a kitten she had found on the playground and introduced it to the dog. The dog was old and never really had the energy to be irritated by the kitten and the kitten was young enough to not fear the dog. Over time, the two became almost inseparable. When the kitten went to eat, the dog followed to guard it and the dog let the kitten play with him in any way the kitten wanted. Then one day her dad had left a door open by mistake and the kitten wandered out while the dog was napping. He tried to stop the kitten, but failed and it was run over by a car. Frances remembered being very sad over the kitten&#39;s death, but to her surprise, the old foxhound took it worse. The dog stopped eating and frequently howled or barked as if he was calling for the kitten and ultimately died in mourning for the kitten. The old dog had bonded with the kitten saw it as a member of the pack and family. Samson&#39;s acceptance of Frances as a werecat was much the same, in this he fully put family over blind loyalty over being a specific were-beast species.<br />
<br />
&quot;And anyway,&quot; Frances continue, &quot;this is my older brother. Samson Carter. I took Samantha&#39;s family name when we married.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha and William nodded as Samson returned to his work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... we will need your statement,&quot; Samson said to Frances.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the idea for today was a bit of a party,&quot; Frances explained, &quot;Martha and William&#39;s son had just gone through his induction into Ben&#39;s Pack, as part of the original plan to abide by Moon Lake&#39;s laws... before things got crazy with Yvette forcing William&#39;s transformation and Martha joining mine and Samantha&#39;s pride... and they wanted to celebrate their son&#39;s transformation and invited Samantha, Ben, and I over to join them. Samantha was called off due to Yvette&#39;s attack on a college student, but Ben went to help Nate with his homework and Eric had some questions for me regarding a friend of his...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Official therapy?&quot; Samson asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... just a friendly chat between friends,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;we were actually playing chess when William and Martha finished their work of cleaning up from the party... but around that time we heard a rattling noise come from the kitchen and caught Yvette&#39;s scent. William recognized it the best and gave a short growl... probably because he knows her personal scent... for obvious reasons. Martha and I only knew that the scent was both a werefox and female... a werevixen and could only guess that it was Yvette given her involvement in William&#39;s transformation...&quot;<br />
<br />
Samson nodded and was writing down everything Frances said as quickly as he could manage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did she attack you?&quot; Samson asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We assumed that it was,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;and there was a great deal of fear that she could try to rush in and drag William off... kill Martha... or take their younger son, Eric, as a hostage to get William to go with her. Martha sent Eric upstairs and to get Ben and Nate and lock himself in his room and we began changing to form a line to block any attempt Yvette could make to go after Eric, if he was her target. We did manage to block her progress through the house, but she did enter brandishing some small camp knife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did she point the knife at you?&quot; Samson asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If anything she pointed it more at Martha... but she seemed to be focused on William... she insulted Martha&#39;s sexuality and seemed to lose control when William stated that his bond and love were with Martha,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;her hand trembled and she couldn&#39;t seem to believe that William&#39;s bond was to Martha... but she did continue to brandish the knife and began to assume her own werevixen form. Nate and Ben urged her to surrender, but she refused and continued brandish the knife. And that is when the real fight began. Nate and Ben attacked to try and pin her and she tried to stab and slash at them... thankfully failing to hit them beyond maybe cutting some of Nate&#39;s guard hairs on his fur...&quot;<br />
<br />
Samson nodded, &quot;anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once the fight began,&quot; Frances began and glanced to Martha and William, &quot;we joined in to try and restrain her. And she fought surprisingly hard against all of us... though thankfully she wasn&#39;t able to stab anyone and Nate and Ben pinned her body down while Martha, William, and I had managed enough to keep her distracted from Nate and Ben... but still... she fought hard... I think we all ended up biting and clawing each other to a degree, but no one got stabbed.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that was true. Yvette had been surprisingly strong or determined in the fight. She hadn&#39;t really been able to truly lift or throw Nate or Ben, but had done enough that she could use their own momentum and size against them. In some ways that was an advantage that smaller were-beast species had over larger ones in being more flexible and if properly trained could even give larger were-beasts trouble in a physical fight if they were solely relying on their size and strength to carry the day. But in the end, the odds had always been against Yvette. While her strength and determination to try and claim William was surprising, as a werevixen, she could never match Nate or Ben in a contest of strength and she would even be weaker than William as he was a male werefox. Frances also knew that she and Martha would be on par with Yvette with regards to their own strength, since werecats and werefoxes were roughly the same size, and that combined that Yvette was outnumbered five to one that even if she managed to over power some of her targets, she would be beaten by force of numbers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is a good thing,&quot; Samson nodded, &quot;thanks, sis. If you&#39;ll wait for a moment... I&#39;ll get the Anderson&#39;s statements and then we&#39;ll finish up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samson then went through the same process with Martha and William and both of them told the same story as Frances did, celebrating Nate&#39;s transformation and even to a degree celebrating Martha&#39;s transformation into a werecat and William accepting being a werefox, but Nate&#39;s joining were society was the reason for the party. They worked together to do the dishes and then joined Frances and Eric in the living room to hear Yvette&#39;s entrance and sending their youngest upstairs to protect him from being forced to be changed into a werefox and changing to protect their son and their home. William went even further by his bond to defend Martha&#39;s sexuality which lead to the fight and Yvette being restrained without anyone being seriously hurt beyond a few scratches and bite wounds that on all of them were rapidly healing and by now HAD healed. When they finished, Samson looked over his notes and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I don&#39;t think there will be any further trouble for you,&quot; Samson spoke, &quot;while it could be argued that you were the most physically aggressive in this particular confrontation... given her overall actions and the fact that she did force entry into your home, you were well within your rights to do so. And since she was brandishing a knife there is clear intent on her part to use lethal force against someone, so I would define that as a proactive defense that you were well within your rights to do... and since you were inside your home, you had the right to change. And you did well in that she was only restrained... So all and all... good job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what will happen now?&quot; William asked, &quot;she infected a college student this morning...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s too close to dusk now to be able to help her,&quot; Samson sighed, &quot;we can arrange for her transformation to be completed tomorrow... probably in our safe room where we know that she can&#39;t escape again... but that is about the best we can do for the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances only sighed. Hopefully things could be arranged as quickly as possible, as she had seen plenty of cases where a transformation not being completed leading to trouble. To her knowledge the college student was in no physical danger, but there was psychological damages and risks that were bound to come about. A new were could become mentally disturbed over feeling incomplete for so long, have their new and already high libido rise even higher as search for completeness begins to drive them to mate with anyone just to try and complete their transformation... or the feeling of it. It was one of the main reasons why Moon Lake tried so hard to make sure that all transformations of normals into weres was willing, as the transformation could be initiated and completed quickly. The new were may have to adapt to things, as Martha and William were, but that new were would be mentally stable and the adaptation to being a were went along with the standard instincts for their new specific species and their physical abilities. Weres that didn&#39;t complete their transformation and had to deal with their psyche&#39;s damaged would have to go through plenty of therapy to heal the damage.</p>
