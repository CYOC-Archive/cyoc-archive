<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So how&#39;s Nat doing,&quot; Miranda asked. Rei rubbed her neck sheepishly, Lancelot staying at Nats home was proving to be tense. &quot;Well it could be better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nats mom really doesn&#39;t like vampires huh,&quot; Miranda asked, to which Rei nodded. Marisa had left the vampire nation decades ago, going so far as to actually kill vampires that threatened humanity. The idea of not only a vampire, but a vampire loyal to to former lord of the vampire nation made for some tense interactions. Fortunately for everyone involved, Liam MacGregor was there. &quot;So what did Mr. MacGregor do,&quot; Miranda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He told Lancelot the story of how he and Nat&#39;s mom met.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did they meet,&quot; Miranda asked.<br />
<br />
Rei grinned as she now explained the story to her friend. &quot;It was an accident,&quot; she said. &quot;And I mean that literally. Mrs. MacGregor actually got in a car accident with Mr. MacGregor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up,&quot; Miranda laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m serious,&quot; Rei giggled. &quot;Mrs. MacGregor was driving back to the blood bank. She had left her purse there after picking up some blood. They were about to close and she was in a rush. Mr. MacGregor was just leaving work and as he pulled out of the parking garage she hit his car.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Rei stated. &quot;Mrs. MacGregor was mortified. Nat told me the story how she was so embarrassed and apologized. For Mr. MacGregor though it was love at first sight. They exchanged insurance info and then he invited her out for coffee. Nat said that her mom was shocked by that. She never expected Mr. MacGregor to do that and when they sat down, she found out what a sweet and kind guy he was. The rest, well, is history.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s so sweet,&quot; Miranda smilled. &quot;And Lancelot heard that story?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep and he found it endearing,&quot; Rei said. &quot;Apparently from what Nat said he&#39;s taken a liking to Mr. MacGregor, so that&#39;s helped ease Mrs. MacGregors concerns.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miranda nodded as the teens now made their way towards a shop at the mall. While the plan was still to stop Kane, they were still working on how. Yes, Lancelot was willing to help but everyone agreed they couldn&#39;t just charge forward without a plan. Sylvia and Tanya were still trying to find another safe house, Natasha was still training, and Kane (according to the tracking spell) was on the other end of the state. Temporarily, it meant the teens could relax.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what are we looking for anyway,&quot; Rei asked as the pair entered a shop. Miranda blushed, shyly averting her eyes before speaking. &quot;Its mine and Amara&#39;s 3 month anniversary I wanted to get her something special.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rei couldn&#39;t help but find this nees adorable, now helping her friend peruse the shelves as the shopkeeper watched them carefully. &quot;So you wanted to grab her a crystal figurine,&quot; Rei asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Believe it or not Amara is a sucker or crystal unicorns,&quot; Miranda chuckled. &quot;And this place does have the best miniatures in town.&quot; Rei nodded, the girl now picking up a 6 inch figurine of a dancing girl. It amazed her how detailed the statue was, Rei wondering how exactly it was made.<br />
<br />
From the front of the store Max Vandergrift watched intently. The owner of the shop had taken a keen interest in the pair as soon as they entered. Max was a collector and a scientist. Some would say a mad scientist with his balding wild brown hair and wide hazel eyes. There was something about the girls that intrigued him and it had been sometime since he added to his collection. Maybe, maybe this was his chance to add a new pair of dolls to his growing collection. Hitting a button under the register, Max listened for the soft sound of the door locking as he now reached for his device.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me how much is this,&quot; Miranda asked as she held a crystal unicorn aloft. &quot;Fifteen dollars,&quot; Max replied, his throat dry in anticipation. Miranda smiled, Max admiring the girls warm smile and mocha complexion, she and her friend would make excellent additions to his collection.<br />
<br />
Miranda now opened her purse, fishing out a $20 bil as the teens approached. &quot;Its perfect I&#39;ll take it.&quot; Max smiled, taking the money as he readied himself. Placing the unicorn in a bag, he now slid it towards Miranda before smiling. &quot;Here you go Miss? I&#39;m sorry what was your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miranda,&quot; she said. &quot;And this is Rei.&quot; Rei offered a polite wave as Max nodded. He always liked to know his collections names. As the teens turned to leave, Max made his move, lifting a small device before pointing at the pair and firing. Max smiled, watching the teens shudder briefly as the devices took affect.<br />
<br />
The teens paused, looking around briefly before gasping. Max now watched as the inches began to bleed from the pair, the teens gradually growing smaller much to their surprise. Turning towards Max, they craned their necks upwards, their eyes wide in horror as Max and the shop seemed to grow.<br />
<br />
Max was only thankful he had finally perfected his shrink ray to miniaturize clothing as well as people. Those first forays into shrinking had proven to be awkward as he had reduced the person and not their clothing. The awkwardness of a tiny nude screaming and disposing of their clothing had led to some close calls.<br />
<br />
Miranda and Rei gasped, quickly sprinting for the front door as they saw the maniacal look in the shopkeepers eyes. Max watched intently, part of the fun for him was watching his quarry try to escape. By the time the two teens reached the door, they had lost a foot in height reducing them to child size. Max smirked as he watched them, if they had been a little taller and a little calmer they could have reached up and unlocked the latch.<br />
<br />
Miranda and Rei were frantic, the duo slowly shrinking as they pushed and pulled on the door. Max watched the girls growing smaller, their heads slowly sinking beneath the handle. Eventually the girls grew too small to reach it, standing onky about 3 feet tall.<br />
<br />
Max now watched as the girls did what so many others had done before them in their panic the shrinking teens now began to run towards the rear of the building away from Max. Max was used to this, so many had tried this before only trapping themselves further as they shrunk.<br />
<br />
Max watched the girls intently, their heights rapidly dwindling away. The girls were closer to 2 feet tall now, the store growing ever larger as they looked for an escape. Max now slowly made his way towards the girls as the final part of this process commensed.<br />
<br />
Max knew what was about to happen. The girls, in a final act of defiance would try to hide, realizing they were far to small to escape. It happened every time and this was no different. Max smirked, watching the rapidly dwindling girls now try and hide from their massive captor. Rei and Miranda now dropped below 2 feet, the girls trying to maneuver their way across the rapidly expanding objects of the store. Max knew it would be all for not.<br />
<br />
Max chuckled, always finding this part to be humorous. The girls were a foot tall and heading towards their final destination of 6 inches. Max always found it fascinating how one&#39;s strength dropped dramatically the smaller one got. Objects someone could easily manipulate at full size now seemed to be impossible. As Miranda and Rei reached their final height of 6 inches, Max knelt down. &quot;Its okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened what are you going to do,&quot; Rei screamed. Max smiled, slowly reaching for the pair as they gasped in horror. &quot;I&#39;m going to add you to my collection,&quot; he said softly. &quot;I think you&#39;ll make excellent additions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miranda and Rei screamed, thrashing violently as their giant captor grasped them. A sense of vertigo overtook then as Max wiaked them into the air. The pair clinging to the giants hand as he took then towards the back. Rei and Miranda&#39;s visin was blurry, the pair unable to focus as thw giant now placed them inside what looked like a giant glass case. &quot;Make yourselves at home,&quot; Max said softly. &quot;I have to take care of a few things but the others will help you adjust to your new home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before the teens could answer, Max now placed a large metal top on their new cage, leaving Rei and Miranda questioning what would happen to them.</p>
