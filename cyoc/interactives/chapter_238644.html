<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The water ran for what may have been hours, running and rinsing off any hint of the sex the two had. James was like a Greek statue holding his boss were it not for his gentle sway in the heat as he recovered, his eyes closed and his face smiling.<br />
<br />
Miles could be mistaken for sleeping were it not for the unbroken grip he had on James&#39;s chest the entire time. He couldn&#39;t place the feelings just yet but it was in his head to push and rub this monster&#39;s body from head to toe. Miles was thinking of worshipping all that beef and getting hard at the thoughts running through his horny twink head as he pushed at that deep pec and sighed contentedly.<br />
<br />
Said deep pec only served as another source of arousal for James whose cock hadn&#39;t relaxed once since railing Miles, stamina being more of a suggestion at levels like his. Whether Miles was up for more or not, James was going to need at least three or four more rounds before so much as thinking about going outside.<br />
<br />
The two remained for a little longer until eventually James took a squat and switched the water off, setting Miles down outside before stepping out himself. Swiping a towel from a nearby rail, James swung it around his twink and got him patted dry, giving his cock a kiss and a suckling during the legs, getting a giggling out of Miles, still plenty in character.<br />
<br />
When James finished though, Miles got a hold of the same towel and gave it a few tugs, taking it and doing the same in a much slower pace to thoroughly rub up James. Miles was grinning widely whether he knew it or not while probing the big guy&#39;s healthy hairy bod, having to swallow from how wild getting to do all of this was getting him.<br />
<br />
The longer the drying worshiping massage went the worse James had it hardon wise, unable to keep from leaking more pre. In contrast to the last time he&#39;d had to, Miles ran his tongue along James&#39;s length slowly, giving out a moan that was matched by the cock&#39;s owner before popping the head in and giving it it&#39;s own rough sucks.<br />
<br />
James was definitely close but he couldn&#39;t just give his loads out like this, this bottom needed to work for it. He ran his fingers through those cute ginger locks but his manhood was locked tight for however much Miles tried.<br />
<br />
The teasing oral did go on for a bit until Miles needed some air, James stepping back to pop himself free and pull him back up to his feet. Instead, he got a grip of his rear and lifted him up to eye level, surprising Miles a bit who fumbled and got his arms around James&#39;s shoulders. Smirking and licking his lips, James pushed in for a kiss. Miles, still flustered and red was stiff for a second or two before letting the big guy in.<br />
<br />
There was heat and some salty bitterness from the mix of pre both men had in their mouths but the exchange was tender and intimate compared to everything else the day had consisted of so far. Whatever script their minds had to go off of their bodies and unofficial roleplaying were deep in the throes of lovers having an extremely raunchy weekend.<br />
<br />
They kissed for at least a bit longer before letting it break, smiling with their heads pushed together. James eventually swung Miles back into a cradling who tucked his legs up, being used to this at this point and similarly getting his hand back on those pectorals to rub and appreciate them. James gave him a squeeze before he started making his way back to the bedroom, taking his time to savor the mutual enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Getting back to the bedroom James just sat down in bed while continuing to hold Miles, pushing back to get on his back and hold him close where he continued rubbing the big guy&#39;s upper body, getting some moans out of James as he did.<br />
<br />
Miles started with both hands on those big pecs with all that hair which he followed the flow of along the delts and those gunshows. Miles had gotten this body that far out of an interest in athletics and bodybuilding growing up, maybe James could pick it back up, he was more than capable of competing. That and maybe with his own experience he could get his svelte body caught up, be a big pair of beefy gays together.<br />
<br />
He continued the rub while James tucked his head back, getting off on the twink&#39;s hands pushing as much as they could into his body, those hands traveling down the thick cables until coming to James own hands where Miles first saw the silver band and studied it. It looked... good. Miles smiled and thought about being this beefcake&#39;s cute little spouse, taking care of him after a regular hard day&#39;s work, how good of a husband James could be before his brain eventually caught up and-<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s the ring?&quot; Miles asked. He was going to disregard the short fantasy sequence he&#39;d gone through first of being the best little wife to this perfect beefcake he had in bed after he&#39;d realized it was a different ring. &quot;Oh I uh.... I put it in the safe,&quot; James said, blinking some while trying to pull himself together, having been enjoying the session. &quot;The safe?&quot; Miles asked, trying to remember, there being plenty of regions of his closet he hadn&#39;t looked at since buying the mansion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, in your closet. There&#39;s a safe behind the black suit pants, it&#39;s back to the left,&quot; James tried to recount, Miles thinking for a bit and nodding. He could remember the safe, it&#39;s just that that safe was never used. He&#39;d bought it with the thought he&#39;d have loads of things to put in and then just never made the time. He&#39;d left the combination on a notecard for when he&#39;d meant to get started but until then he&#39;d just set that card to... the back of that safe....<br />
<br />
Miles was looking in the direction of the closet while thinking this all through, blinking a couple of times. &quot;Is.... is that safe for other things?&quot; James interrupted, getting a flinch from Miles who looked back to him. Him and that thick bull&#39;s neck. That hairy monstrous bust, those shoulders that could keep the planet lifted. And that suave black hair and rugged beard framing that anvil jawline and those wide innocent eyes. James had taken all that dominance and initiative and yet still had that drive to please.<br />
<br />
&quot;N... no, it.... it&#39;s fine. That&#39;s.... that&#39;s where I&#39;d have put it...&quot; Miles said. He needed to think on this. It was always an option to call a locksmith over, James had the fund.... HIM. He had the funds. They weren&#39;t trapped or anything of the sort, everything would be fine. They could resolve this whenever at their leisure.<br />
<br />
And yet he&#39;d lied. He... was enjoying himself. This latest swap had been under some flimsy excuse of the contract&#39;s ambiguity to cover for wanting this dynamic. And he wanted more. Not just for this beefcake to use and fill him up at his discretion but to be squeezed. To treat him right, to be had and held and wake up every morning to this Adonis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did... you want to renegotiate things now? Sir?&quot; James interjected, getting Miles&#39;s attention again. &quot;I... yeah. I mean. We have time. Bank holiday tomorrow and I can move some things around for the two of us,&quot; Miles idly listed off, clearly trying to think. James let his boss ideate a bit, leaning up to pull him into his arms and rub his back. Not paying attention, Miles flinched and stiffened from the motion but quickly relaxed and laid his head on the muscle mass, smiling.<br />
<br />
It was all important to resolve, that much was certain. But while themselves they only tended to look at each other with sex and business on their minds. As each other while there was all of that it came with additional important things to focus on. A chemistry that only seemed to exist when things were as they were now.<br />
<br />
Neither stated what they could see happening in the other. The anxious twink starting to blossom into a power bottom the more accustomed he became to his needs with undiscovered regions of his sexuality. The burgeoning bear feeling his self esteem grow into his muscles and dominant position as he filled out his body from the inside more and more, syncing with huge muscle that just seemed like it was full of sex and a craving for the man he was becoming.<br />
<br />
Maybe they were both secretly gunning for the other to make it there, maybe they both just wanted some excuse to prolong the circumstances. They may have dragged their feet if the connection was ever made that the issues being codependent may effect or even impact whatever feelings they had toward the other but...<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you wanna go out?&quot; James asked. Miles stared at his bare chest for a bit, still in deep thought, before he blinked some. &quot;For.... brunch?&quot; he asked, not making the connection. &quot;For... brunch, yeah. And dinner,&quot; James started, not sure what he was saying. But he also felt he needed to keep talking. &quot;Out. As in.... a date,&quot; he managed to work the sentence into.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I.... want to go on a date?&quot; Miles repeated. &quot;Do you want to go on a date. And do you want to date,&quot; James pushed. He wasn&#39;t sure where this was coming from but it... felt like the right things to be asking. He hadn&#39;t been this intimate with anyone in the past. Anything in that vein had gotten as far as hookups or semester long messes but this was... something else. And he could tell Miles was starting to process from how much he had started heating up in his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re.... I&#39;m.... I&#39;m your boss,&quot; Miles fumbled slightly. &quot;You are,&quot; James said, bringing Miles up to make eye contact. &quot;And... I&#39;m.... I&#39;m in your body,&quot; he said, looking away. James didn&#39;t. Instead James gave him a squeeze, getting a gasp out of him. &quot;And I still fucked you. In your body,&quot; James said. Miles couldn&#39;t help but smile. &quot;And while whichever body either of us is in clearly isn&#39;t a barrier I think we&#39;re both starting to get some preferences.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miles was going through that soreness up that bubble butt now and he loved it. And he loved this forwardness coming from James, it was... really adding to his attractiveness. He was wearing the muscles better by the second. How hot and how much of a hunk this man was gonna be...<br />
<br />
Miles shivered in a mix of tension and uncertainty. It would have been a lot to commit to if there hadn&#39;t been anything weird happening, but starting a relationship in each other&#39;s bodies added layers upon layers to-&quot;Yes. I... yeah,&quot; he blurted, not wanting to add to his worry. However complicated this got, he was hard and his heart was fluttering and he was panicking. All that panic relaxed though when his boyfriend pushed him back up to give him another kiss, his breath shallow but relaxing bit by bit, letting it break and smiling back, chuckling.<br />
<br />
&quot;James.... babe...&quot; Miles said first, getting James to perk up. Sir was one thing, but... that had gotten his dense hair to stand on end. &quot;The safe. I don&#39;t know the combination. It&#39;s on a card that I was keeping in the safe,&quot; Miles gently explained. The last thing he wanted was to start this relationship on a lie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; James said, blinking and looking to the side. &quot;W...well.... we can.... call a locksmith?&quot; he attempted. Miles smiled back and chuckled before crawling up to get his other leg over James&#39;s core and press his hands into those boulder shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. We can do that,&quot; he said, pushing in to give another kiss, more warm than the previous, getting some chuckles from James who was getting flustered himself at the treatment. &quot;Put it on your to-do list. After the contract. And the mole. And me,&quot; he said, getting an instant  rise from James whose manhood swung up to wedge between Miles&#39;s buns. Miles smirked and flexed his butt to give the beefcake a tease. &quot;Wanna join me back in your body then, stud?&quot;<br />
<br />
James was flustered to the point of going service top, needing to swallow while his cock throbbed and gushed up a round of pre. Reaching back and giving the length some pumps, Miles was able to pick up enough of the man&#39;s home grown lubricant, getting it worked around his rim and working him past his edge before any drying happened. Being used to him at this point it wasn&#39;t much of a struggle to get James back up his backside.<br />
<br />
Even if James had since refilled he was still caught off guard. Disregarding everything he&#39;d committed to in the past five minutes out of necessity his body was still awash with all the teasing and playing up Miles had done in the rubbing up and worship. Whether or not Miles had picked up on this was unknown but in addition to beginning this in honesty he also intended to be taking the first foot forward, giving his hungering ass a powerful squeeze at James&#39;s base.<br />
<br />
James let out a moan, coming up on his elbows while his huge body was supercharged from stimulation, his chest puffing out for Miles to grab and squeeze. James grit his teeth and tensed his neck, taking short breaths while Miles started to bounce and power the man&#39;s meat into him, biting down on his lip. It hurt on account of sheer size but it was scratching the deepest itches and cravings.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon babe, you wanna keep all that muscle? Wanna keep this prize of a twink like me? Man of status like you&#39;s gotta be able to breed, so BREED!&quot; Miles yelled in James&#39;s face, his jaw going slack while his boyfriend slammed himself down in a rush, throbbing already and getting worse. &quot;Push more! You&#39;re the top of tops now so get your bitch boy of a boyfriend full up!&quot; he yelled some more. He may have been treating this more like a workout than another &#39;bout of sex but he could tell James was still reacting from the climbing pressure and temperature he was working up in there. For all the dominance he&#39;d been able to pick up from his new body there was clearly still a submissive streak poking its head above the testosterone laden skin, able to work a few humps up into the commanding twink.<br />
<br />
&quot;FILL. UP. GIVE. ALL YOU GOT!!&quot; Miles shouted, getting less verbal the longer it went. Even if he was committing to all of this there was still just a bit of greed in him as it were. He&#39;d had an unbroken record of topping up until all of this, but now that he&#39;d come to appreciate just how good the other side was he had every intention to make up the time he&#39;d spent. More than possible with how much this bull of a man could give who opened his mouth and groaned when he started spilling up in release.<br />
<br />
Miles finally relaxed to let James grunt and push back, the two riding out the heavy climax and draining of the big guy&#39;s meat, taking some time until he was left big and shuddering in there, Miles carefully lifting himself up to let James free and catch his breath, covered in sweat with an unfocused stare upward, cuddling up between his pecs and arm to rub his abs and admire his throbbing cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow sir. You&#39;ve got some real stamina,&quot; Miles admired and partly teased, knowing full well how much he had to deal with and adjust to. &quot;Y... yeah... helps when I&#39;m dating such a cutie...&quot; he said between pants, able to give his cutie a squeeze as well while he reached in to squeeze his own base and groan as if trying to wrestle his rod back under his control.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately whoever had the body didn&#39;t stop that cock&#39;s needs and while Miles had had years to get used to it and channel what it had, James was fresh and unadjusted. Still throbbing and healthy with virility, that beefy body was clearly loving the new management as much as the twink giving it all this attention with no signs of stopping any time soon.</p>
