Do you know for this kind of eventful life for isekai protagonist, we are divided into three groups according to the degree?<br/>
1. Incident always come to find the protagonist. <br/>
2. protagonist is so special that everyone have ideas about him. <br/>
3.  wherever protagonist go, people die </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> <br />
I woke up to a ray of sunlight hitting my face. I groaned and twitched, feeling my tail thump against the bed. I tried to block out the light, but it was too bright and persistent. <br />
<br />
I turned over and squinted my eyes, focusing on the unfamiliar ceiling until the sharp wolf eyes could see every bit of mold. I&#39;m not dreaming, I&#39;m really in a different world, far beyond the world.<br />
<br />
As my smartphone was still absorbed within this body, so my old morning routine was failed from the beginning, a pang of nostalgia and sadness appeared, but I pushed it away. I had to adapt to this situation, to this isekai world.<br />
<br />
I looked over at the other bed, where Adrian was sleeping. The hyena had come back sometime during the night, probably after having some fun with someone. He was snoring loudly, drooling on his pillow, mumbling in his sleep. He looked so peaceful and innocent, unlike his usual scoundrel self. I decided to let him sleep a bit longer, and got up quietly.<br />
<br />
As my morning routine invalid, I will follow Max&#39;s one instead. <br />
<br />
I put on my pants and headed to the public pool to get some water. I splashed some on my face, feeling the coldness wake me up. I grabbed a bar of soap and started to scrub my fur, trying to get rid of the dirt and sweat from yesterday. I had to use my paws to untangle the knots in my fur, which was a new and weird experience for me. I wondered how Max did it every day, how he took care of his fur and his body.<br />
<br />
As I washed, I felt the large muscles under my skin, the muscles that gained from working hard at the docks. I felt a surge of pride and joy, admiring the strength and beauty of this wolf body. I had to admit, it was a wonderful body, a body that I never get tired.<br />
<br />
After I feel satisfied, I shook off the water from my fur and went back to the shack. I put on a clean shirt and saw that Adrian was still sleeping. He looked so cute and peaceful, snuggled in his bed. I couldn’t help but smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cute.&quot; Word of praise slipped out of my muzzle.<br />
<br />
“Maybe a little bit, but mostly a lazy asshole. Just howl at him and wake him up, or we’ll have to work late again. We have a big ship coming today, one hired by a caravan.” Max said in my mind, sounding annoyed and impatient.<br />
<br />
“Relax, Max. There’s no need to be so harsh. Let me handle it.” I said, trying to calm him down.<br />
<br />
I put my paws on the bed and whispered in Adrian’s ear. “Morning, Adrian. Time to get up. We have a busy day ahead of us. Don’t make us wait any longer.”<br />
<br />
“Five more minutes, please~” Adrian whined, his eyes still closed. He grabbed my arm and nuzzled it with his head, acting like a spoiled pup.<br />
<br />
I stroked his chest gently, feeling his fur and muscles. He was quite smaller than me, but still fit and handsome. He let out a purr and cuddled with me, making me feel warm and fuzzy. <br />
<br />
I couldn’t resist patting his head with my other paw, messing up his white mane. He opened his yellow eyes and smiled at me. He looked very happy with the way I woke him up.<br />
<br />
“Good morning, handsome. I see you keep this new manner, so sweet and gentle. Are you sure you’re not my mate?” He teased, batting his eyelashes at me.<br />
<br />
I blushed and pulled away, feeling flustered. He was joking, of course, but he had a way of making me feel things I didn’t expect.<br />
<br />
“What a waste of time. Come on, let’s go. Or we’ll be late and get in trouble.” Max said, breaking the mood. He was right, we had to get ready for work. But I couldn’t help but feel a bit of regret, leaving Adrian behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry but I can&#39;t be late. See you later at the dock, Adrian.” I said, getting up and grabbing my stuff.<br />
<br />
“See you later, cutie. Lucky for me they already custom to me coming late.” Adrian joked, his eyes sparkling with mischief.<br />
<br />
I smiled and left the shack. On the way to work, I purposefully steered clear of the bakery that had once brought Max embarrassment. The streets bustled with an array of beastmen, each engrossed in their own journey to work, and atmosphere is completely different. Few of them exchanged morning greetings with me, I reciprocated with a wave, mirroring Max&#39;s customary gesture. Guided by the vivid recollection of Max&#39;s memories, I effortlessly navigated my way back to the familiar sights of the dock.<br />
<br />
The morning sun rose over the bustling docks, heralding the start of another workday. The salty breeze and the seagull cries filled the air, creating a lively atmosphere. I joined the other dockers in loading and unloading the ships, doing my best to keep up with the pace. But there was one thing that made the work more interesting – the display of muscle power.<br />
<br />
As I lifted and carried the crates and barrels, I felt the muscles in my wolf beastman body tense and ache, showing me the strength that flowed within. But I soon noticed that I was not the only one who enjoyed this feeling. Other beastmen, of different shapes and sizes, also flexed their muscles and showed off their physiques. <br />
<br />
It was like a silent competition, where each task became a chance to impress and challenge the others. Whether it was hoisting a crate with a loud grunt or carrying a barrel with a flourish, each docker seemed eager to prove their might and skill.<br />
<br />
With the help of ropes and pulleys, cranes and carts, we emptied half the cargo holds and filled the warehouses. Sweat dripped from our fur and skin, making us glisten in the sun. We worked hard, but we also had fun, comparing our feats and testing each other.<br />
<br />
At midday, we were taking a break to eat our meals. We sat on a wooden bench, enjoying the breeze and the view. We had worked hard, but we also had fun, chatting and laughing with our coworkers.<br />
<br />
But then, Cornwall, the boar beastman who was our foreman, called me aside. He looked serious and worried, and he had something to tell me. Something that made my stomach sink.<br />
<br />
“Max, I have some bad news for you.” He said, his voice low and grave. “You remember the damages you caused before you quit your job?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah. I remember. I broke some shit, so what?” I said, trying to sound like Max. I was nervous as I could probably guess what he&#39;s going to say.<br />
<br />
“Not just that. You also damaged some of the goods inside. The owner was furious and demanded compensation, or he would sue us.” He said, his voice tense and sorry. &quot;It is quite a sum. I tried to negotiate with him, but he didn’t budge much. He said he had witnesses and proof, and would take us to court if we didn’t pay up.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, I didn’t do it on purpose. I was just disturbed.” I said angrily. I remembered the day when Max had snapped, when he had thrown and smashed the crates and barrels. He hadn’t meant to hurt anyone or anything. And I knew Max didn’t have much money, and neither did I. How were we going to pay for this?<br />
<br />
“I know, I know. I like you, Max. You’re a good worker, and you have potential. But I have no choice. I have to cut your wages until the hole is filled. I’m sorry for the trouble. I hope you can forgive me for this.” He said with flushed cheeks that could be hidden beneath his thick beard.<br />
<br />
“Fine, fine! Do what you have to do. But don’t expect me to thank you or forgive you. You’re just doing your job, then so do I. I’ll pay for this, and I don’t need your pity.&quot; I heard Max’s voice in my mind, angry and defiant. It is harsh for him, but he still want to hold up his pride, to show that he was not a failure. I wished I could help him, for the hard life that had made him this way.<br />
<br />
“I get it, Cornwall. You’re just doing your job. But is there nothing we can do? Have you try to find some evidence that reduces my responsibility? Maybe the owner of the ship is lying or exaggerating. Maybe the goods were already damaged or spoiled.” I said, trying to reason with him. I hoped there was a way out of this, a way to save Max from this trouble.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, I don’t know. I’ve looked into it, but I couldn’t find anything. Try it yourself, but be careful and don&#39;t do anything stupid.” He said, his voice worried and cautious.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I’ll be careful. Let’s get back to the meal now, shall we?” I said, feeling hopeful. I decided to look into this, to find some clues. Anything that could help Max. He didn’t deserve this. He deserved a second chance.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, thank you. I can see you really learned your lesson. ” He said, his voice grateful and apologetic.<br />
<br />
I sneezed a smile and nodded, then went back to the bench. I picked up my meal, but I had no appetite, my ears flat and tail tucked subconsciously. I&#39;m too worried about this situation. I tried to nudge Max with my paw smooth the fur of our body, to see if he would talk to me. But he was in a bad mood, and he refused to communicate.<br />
<br />
I sighed and left him alone, hoping he would calm down. I spent the afternoon thinking about my first move. How could I help Max? Maybe there was something Cornwall missed. But that was unlikely. The boar was an experienced and reliable foreman. He knew the docks inside and out. He had done his best to negotiate with the ship owner, but it was not enough.<br />
<br />
Maybe I could use my ability to possess the ship owner, and see if there was anything shady going on. I could use his body to look for clues, or even to sign a release from prosecution. But that would be risky and unethical. What if I got caught? What if I harmed him or his reputation? What if he was telling the truth, and Max really owed him that much money? I didn’t want to do that, unless I had no other choice.<br />
<br />
Fuck, the god send me to this world is really looking for entertain himself or teach me a lesson. My life had become more complicated and eventful than ever. In just two days, I had more problems and challenges than I could handle.<br />
<br />
As the dock bell rang again, signaling the end of the workday, everyone got off work at the normal time. They packed their stuff and ready to head home, or to the taverns and inns. They looked tired but happy, satisfied with their work and their lives. <br />
<br />
While Max was stuck in his misery with his pride and his anger. I wished I could help, make him happy, or at least less unhappy. <br />
<br />
But I didn’t know how to do that. There is not much in Max&#39;s encyclopedia know how to deal with this situation. I felt lost and confused, and I needed some guidance and support. Maybe I should ask someone else, someone who knew more than me, someone who could help me. But who?</p>
