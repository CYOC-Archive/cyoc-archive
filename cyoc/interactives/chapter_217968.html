<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heather drifted slowly back to consciousness. This entire situation was becoming all too familiar, and she didn&#39;t know whether she liked that or not. She kept her eyes closed, not yet ready to actually face whatever might be waiting for her this time. There was an odd sound, a sort of repetitive whirring and clicking punctuated by soft whimpers. She pulled herself upright with difficulty. The diaper she had been put to bed in was the thickest yet. She couldn&#39;t bring her knees together, no matter how hard she tried. Despite this, she struggled upward and looked around. It didn&#39;t take long to find the source of the noise.<br />
<br />
Only a few feet away from the crib Heather had woken in was Mel. She was slumped over sideways, held up by a strange looking chair. Heather stared in horror at the seat of it. Mel&#39;s thighs were being held wide apart and in between them was a large dildo moving steadily in and out of her friend&#39;s snatch. Every time it retracted Mel would gasp and when it extended again Mel would let out an almost pained whimper. As Heather watched, Mel lifted her head with great apparent effort and tried to focus her eyes on the crib.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heather... Help... Me...&quot; she gasped in time with the dildo&#39;s movement.<br />
<br />
Heather gaped for a moment more, then she scrambled for the latches holding the crib shut. Thankfully they were just like the ones on the crib back in her bedroom and she managed to open the bars with no major issues. Getting out of the crib proved to be more of a problem. Her bulky diaper hindered her movements. She ended up falling out instead of climbing out, landing with a muffled whumpf on her diapered ass. Knowing that she would never be able to walk properly, she crawled the short distance to Mel instead.<br />
<br />
As she got nearer Mel began making weak, but frantic motions off to her right. Heather looked and saw a large remote sitting on the floor, well out of reach of her trapped friend. She scrambled over to it and picked it up. It wasn&#39;t a very complex remote and Heather saw the button marked stop right away. She pressed it, and the whirring and clicking stopped abruptly. The whimpering continued, but it became irregular. She turned back to Mel and saw that the machine had stopped with the dildo fully extended. She looked back down at the remote and found the retract button. She pressed it and watched as the machine slowly slid itself out of Mel.<br />
<br />
When the dildo finally slid completely free, Mel fell sideways out of the seat and lay gasping on the carpet. Heather moved closer to see if there was anything she could do to help. Mel was flat on her back and breathing heavily. She kept her legs spread, though not as wide as the chair had, and Heather could see why. Her poor, abused pussy was red and swollen. She reached out and gently poked her labia with one finger. Mel let out a sharp squeal and flinched away from her touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mel?&quot; Heather asked quietly. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel just shook her head, still gasping for breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything I  can do to help?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel flopped one hand towards the changing station. Heather looked over and saw the first aid kit mounted on the wall above it. She remembered that the kit contained medicated cream for cooling diaper rash. She looked back at Mel&#39;s sore crotch. It wasn&#39;t a rash, but it definitely needed soothing.<br />
<br />
Heather crawled across the room and reached up to grab the edge of the padded table. She managed to get to her feet, but she was so bow-legged that she had to keep one hand gripping the table to hold her balance. She reached for the first aid box and managed to get it open. The tub of rash cream was on the lowest shelf, within easy reach. She grabbed it and dropped back to the floor again. When she got back to Mel she unscrewed the lid and dipped two fingers inside. Mel flinched again when Heather&#39;s fingers made contact with her sore flesh. She tried to bring her knees together, but Heather held them apart and kept applying the soothing balm, gently massaging it in. When she had applied a generous layer across Mel&#39;s privates she sat back and watched to see if it would work.<br />
<br />
Mel lay there for about five more minutes. Her breath eventually slowed down and she gingerly pulled herself up into a sitting position. She kept her legs carefully spread, wincing every time she had to tense any muscles in her groin. She looked down at Heather&#39;s handiwork, then up at Heather herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; she said quietly. &quot;That feels much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Heather asked. &quot;Why were you on... that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel grinned sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;After I changed you I was really horny, too horny to even stand. I thought that would be the easiest way to get off while you napped. It was going great, until I dropped the remote. I couldn&#39;t get my self off the seat with the way the dildo was angled so I just had to hope that you would wake up sooner rather than later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long were you on there?&quot; Heather asked, astonished.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. What time is it anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both teens looked up at the clock, then at each other. It was almost six. They had gotten here around 10 AM.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t paying that much attention,&quot; Mel said, &quot;But I think that I started a short time before noon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather stared at her friend in silence. A silence broken by simultaneous gurgles from both girl&#39;s stomachs. They both laughed nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we missed lunch.&quot; Heather said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we did.&quot; Mel agreed.<br />
<br />
Mel carefully pushed herself to her feet. She walked very carefully with a comically wide gait over towards the kitchenette. She pulled open a few cupboards and grabbed some packets. Then she opened the bottle warmer and removed another large bottle. She carried these over to a low table and gestured for Heather to come and join her before carefully sitting in one of the low chairs. Heather noted that she kept her legs spread in an unladylike fashion. It actually looked rather lewd. Heather crawled over and pulled herself into the chair opposite her friend. Her diaper kept her legs spread as well.<br />
<br />
Mel passed Heather the bottle and a packet of animal crackers. For herself she had gotten a large juice box and a packet of goldfish crackers. The two of them ate and drank in silence. At one point Mel stood and carefully went to grab more snacks for them. When they had both eaten their fill and finished their drinks they sat for a few minutes more, pointedly not looking at each other. The silence stretched for an uncomfortable amount of time before a voice startled them from the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having fun?&quot; Gabby said.<br />
<br />
Mel and Heather stared guiltily at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry mom.&quot; Mel said. &quot;I got carried away and lost track of time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabby looked Mel up and down. Then she looked over at the seat still coated in Mel&#39;s juices. Mel tried to bring her knees together again, but it still hurt too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see.&quot; Gabby said sardonically. &quot;When I didn&#39;t get a call from you I decided to come over and check in. I think playtime is over now. Get dressed. I&#39;ll clean up the mess. Do you need changing Heather?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No ma&#39;am.&quot; Heather said. She did need to pee, but it wasn&#39;t urgent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabby grabbed a tub of sanitary wipes from a cupboard and began cleaning off the seat and its attached toy. Mel got to her feet and carefully walked to the alcove where she had left her clothes and other belongings. She dug through Heather&#39;s diaper bag and pulled out a new pair of latex panties. She looked at them thoughtfully, then shook her head and dropped them into the bag again. She was obviously too sore to wear any underwear. Heather watched as she simply pulled her nanny dress back on and carefully slipped her feet into her shoes without socks or stockings. As an afterthought, she grabbed a couple of baby wipes and carefully wiped any residual fluids off of her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot; Gabby said. &quot;That was some mess you made Mel, I&#39;ll have to get Bob to give it a deep clean on Monday. Let&#39;s get you both home so you can have a proper dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather was about to try and pull herself up but Gabby grabbed her under the arms and lifted her onto her hip. She was carried out of the building with Mel staggering to keep up. Gabby set the alarm and locked the doors again before loading Heather into her car seat. Then she turned and helped Mel into the car as well since the poor girl was still having trouble. When all three were situated Gabby started the car and drove them back to Heather&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
Mandy was waiting outside for them. She chatted briefly and quietly with Gabby, then grabbed Heather from her seat. Mel was about to unbuckle her seat belt, but Gabby stopped her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not tonight.&quot; Gabby explained, &quot;You&#39;ve had a long day and need a break. Leave Heather with her mommy for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabby pouted, but obeyed. Both Mandy and Heather waved as they drove off.<br />
<br />
Dinner was an odd affair. Hillary was fully dressed and strangely subdued the entire time. Derek more than filled the silence with his chatter as usual. Her father asked them all how their day went and got some noncommittal answers. Heather was of course back in her highchair and Mandy fed her mashed potatoes and bits of chicken while she ate her own meal. When the plates had been cleared her father took Derek outside for a quick game of catch. Hillary disappeared upstairs to her room. Heather watched her go, trying to see what might be bothering her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay sweetie.&quot; Mandy said, &quot;It&#39;s bedtime for you. Gabby told me you had a long nap today but I bet you&#39;re still tired.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather wasn&#39;t the least bit tired, but she went along with it. She wanted some privacy and being put to bed was the perfect way to get it. Mandy carried her up to her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need a change?&quot; Mandy asked.<br />
<br />
Heather shook her head. Her mom didn&#39;t need to ask, her hand was very firmly on her diaper as she was being carried. Heather still needed to pee, even more so after the bottle of milk she had with dinner, but she had decided to hold it for a bit longer. Mandy pulled her tiny top off and looked at it critically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did Mel pick this one out?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Heather said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought so. It has Mel written all over it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy threw the top into the hamper and grabbed a pink onesie from Heather&#39;s dresser. Once Heather had been dressed in it she was placed into her crib.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet dreams baby.&quot; Mandy said as she turned off the light and closed the door.<br />
<br />
Heather waited, listening carefully. When she heard her mother&#39;s light footsteps reach the top of the stairs she grabbed her bracelet totem and thought &#39;end scenario&#39; as hard as she could.</p>
