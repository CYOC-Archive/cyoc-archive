<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Where are we?&quot; Kylie asked.<br />
<br />
The disturbed young woman stared off into the distance. All she saw was an endless field of grass for as far as the eye could see, which she somehow found both simultaneously eerie and peaceful. <br />
<br />
It was breezy outside, her and Aziza&#39;s windswept hair blowing around to and fro, as did the myriad blades of grass. The sunshining sky above was a beautiful shade of blue with only the occasional puffy white cloud passing by, the exact opposite aesthetic of the doom and gloom permeating Kylie&#39;s mental state. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re in another dimension, Kylie. We&#39;re on a version of Earth where sentient life never existed. Go figure, the planet got along just fine without any of us. There&#39;s nobody here but you and me. Tranquil, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very&quot; Kylie said. &quot;Really, there&#39;s nobody here at all?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aziza yelled COCKSUCKING MOTHERFUCKER as loud as she could, the echo reverberating for a surprisingly long time. No sounds of any other life could be heard. <br />
<br />
&quot;See? Nobody but us. Nobody for you to hurt but me or yourself, because I know that&#39;s what you&#39;re afraid of, sweetie. You&#39;re afraid that you&#39;re a monster.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I really...did I really killed all those people? Did I really did all of those horrible things?&quot; <br />
<br />
Aziza nodded sadly, biting her lip.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Kylie asked innocently, on the verge of tears. &quot;I don&#39;t hate anyone. I love people! Why would I do all of those things Savannah said that I did back home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do people do evil things?&quot; Aziza asked. &quot;I can&#39;t answer that question. I&#39;m a sorceress and a mechanic and a computer programmer, and a few other things. I&#39;m a jack of all trades basically, but I&#39;m no philosopher, nor am I as psychiatrist. I can&#39;t tell you why you are the way that you are. I would love to be able to blame the Glendale demon for corrupting you, twisting your mind, making you insane and tempting you into doing things that you wouldn&#39;t normally do, but that would be a lie. You chose to do all of those terrible things yourself. You had been planning to torture your classmates at that Halloween party for months.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I *am* evil?&quot; Kylie asked. Her voice was become noticably more distraught.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did evil things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kill me right now then! I deserve it. If all that shit is true, I&#39;m worse than every dictator who ever lived. I&#39;m worse than every serial killer and mass shooter put together. I&#39;m the worst person in the world. Do it, Aziza, kill me. Or send me back home so I can face justice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I&#39;m not killing you, and I&#39;m not letting you be burned at the stake. You know that&#39;s what would happen to you if you went home, right? Your world has become so much more barbaric since you left it, and what is the punishment for witches? Death by fire. Do you really want that? Do you wanted to die screaming in agony, the flesh melting off of your bones?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not? If I&#39;m really such a demented evil bitch, dont I deserve that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie, when I first met you, you tried to turn me into a skinless, mouthless monster with chainsaws for hands and a serrated knife for a cock. You don&#39;t need to impress me, I&#39;ve seen how twisted you can be. I already know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop talkint in riddles, Aziza! Why are we here? What&#39;s going on?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me finish, and I&#39;ll tell you. As I was saying, when I first met you, you were utterly bugfuck insane and consumed by rage. When I defeated you in magic battle, I looked inside your mind, and what I saw broke my heart. I saw a very broken, very damaged, very lonely and isolated person. Your soul carried so much hate, so much entitlement and misanthropy, no small amount of sadism, and ironically, more than a little racism and misogyny. And, I&#39;m sorry to say, mental illness. But I also saw that you were once a child, a happy innocent child who wanted nothing more than to make his parents happy. And I thought, what a waste of a good life you had.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, w-what are you saying, t-that I-I&#39;m like some kind of rehabilitation project for you?&quot; Kylie stuttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would that be the worst thing in the world? I&#39;m offering you a chance at something few people in any dimension ever get, a fresh start.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But e-everyone I&#39;ve hurt...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone you&#39;ve hurt is already hurt. There&#39;s no fixing that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... magic? It can do anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not quite *anything*, there are rules. If we went back into time and stoped you from your massacre, it would simply create another branching timeline where things played out differently. The original timeline, your timeline, would still exist, and the people you terrorized would still remain terrorized.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then those people deserve to be avenged!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And maybe they will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie looked confused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie, as much as it pains me to say this, as much as I adore you, and I adore you more than all the stars in the universe, I am also more than a little bit terrified of you. Regina is scared of you too. Savannah, as much as she won&#39;t admit it, is scared to death of you. You have powers that make every sorcerer in the world seem like they&#39;re doing card tricks. You are the closest thing to a goddess that any mortal has ever achieved. A goddess of transformation and rebirth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie listened, mouthing &quot;wtf?&quot; to herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;When you were afflicted with the Glendale curse, you gained the power of unlimited transformation over all people and objects. That means that literally all of reality is yours to play around with! You can create or destroy anything. Anything your heart desires, except for yourself. That&#39;s the only limitation. You can&#39;t change yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does any of this have to do with killing millions of people?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you see, Kylie? You can destroy, but you can also *create*. If you feel so guilty about what you&#39;ve done, you can build on top of what you destroyed. It took me forever to realize, like the idiot that I am, but *you* were the one who is responsible for the Great Blizzard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie felt Aziza grab her hands, gently but firmly. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all so clear to me now. You bought me that snowglobe because it reminded you of what Christmas was like for you back home in America, and you wanted me to feel the same joy that you had felt as a child. The snowglobe wasn&#39;t cursed at all, it was all your own power. Even if it was all subconscious on your part, you wanted so badly to have me share in your happiness, and you wanted the entire planet to know about how much I mean to you. That&#39;s the opposite of evil. You did it out of love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie didn&#39;t know what to say. <br />
<br />
&quot;To answer your question, what does this have to do with what you did in the past? It means that you can fix it all. You don&#39;t have to let your past actions define you. The two of us are going to spend as much time here as we need fixing you up, getting all of your ducks in a row, dealing with your issues until you see how capable you are of being amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kylie giggled for the first time since coming home. <br />
<br />
&quot;You sound just like one of those corny life coaches, like Tony Robbins.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hugged Aziza tightly. <br />
<br />
The hug lasted for a good minute, and then, when she noticed that Aziza hadn&#39;t let go, Kylie cried again, profusely this time.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for not giving up on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any time, sis&quot; Aziza said, smiling warmly.</p>
