<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I wasn’t sure of how long Carrie and Juliet would need.  I had a feeling there would be more than just oral sex happening in that room.  I really didn’t know what else to do, being that I didn’t know anyone else who lived in the house.  I decided to head back down to the common room on the first floor.  I hoped to find some kind of directory there so I could at least see what girl lived in what room.<br />
<br />
When I reached the common room I was satisfied to find it still empty.  As I approached the front door, I came to the realization that a list of the residents would be back in the entrance alcove from where I had to be buzzed inside the house.  It was at this point that I realized how silly my needing to look for such a list was.  I had the ring and it granted wishes.  Without another thought I simply wished to have in my hands a list of all the residents of the sorority with their room numbers.<br />
<br />
A piece of paper suddenly appeared in my hands.  It appeared with such suddenness that it gave me a small paper cup in the palm of my hand.  I wished that it was instantly healed, and again the ring amazingly obliged.<br />
<br />
At that point I heard the sound of the front door being opened.  The door to the common room quickly swung open and into the room stepped a very attractive African-American girl.  She moved with a purpose until she caught sight of me standing aloof in the middle of the room.<br />
<br />
“Who are you?” she asked as her pace slowed just a bit.  Her voice was suspicious and the look on her face reflected this.<br />
<br />
“Oh, my name is Joe,” I answered.  “I’m a friend of Carrie’s.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, OK,” she said.  Her face softened at this information.  From this I gathered she was at least friendly with Carrie.  “Are you waiting for her?” she asked.  She stopped walking and stood in front of me.  This gave me a moment to fully admire her beauty.  That was really the most apt word for her appearance.  Words like “pretty” or “cute” or “hot” just didn’t apply to a girl like this.  She had perfect skin that was free of mark of blemish.  Her face was like something carved out of marble.  She had long, black hair that stopped halfway down her torso.  She possessed a perfect hourglass figure that featured a tapered waist and round hips.  She had perfectly shaped C-cup breasts.  The tight pants she wore revealed that she had shapely, athletic legs.<br />
<br />
“Yea, I am,” I replied.  “She’s in the middle of something right now, so I’m just hanging out.”  At this point I decided that I wasn’t going to wait for Carrie to continue with my plan.  “I don’t know how long she’s going to be, and since it would be nice to have another place to wait, I wish you’d invite me to your room.”<br />
<br />
Without batting an eye or reacting to the strange wording of my statement, the girl said, “Why don’t you come up to my room to wait?”<br />
<br />
I pretended to be surprised by her offer.  “Oh, really?  OK, that would be cool,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Follow me,” she said as she walked to the staircase.  “My name is Shanelle, by the way.”<br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you,” I said.  I followed behind her and was able to admire her exquisitely rounded ass which looked all the nicer thanks to her pants.  I still had the piece of paper in my hand and I glanced at it quickly enough to see that Shanelle’s room was on the second floor.  Then it occurred to me it would be nice to know how all the residents intended to vote for head of house.  I made a wish to myself for that information to appear on the paper.  It showed me that it was currently split 5-5 with 2 undecided.  Juliet was one of the undecided.  Shanelle was listed as voting for Carrie.  That would make things easier with her, I hoped.<br />
<br />
We got to her door and she quickly unlocked it and walked inside with me still close behind her.  She dropped her backpack on the floor and took a seat in a chair in front of a desk.  “I don’t have another chair,” she apologized, “so you can sit on the bed.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” I said.  Her room was very neat so she had no real need for embarrassment at me having to sit on her bed.<br />
<br />
“So what brings you here today?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“I came to talk with Carrie,” I said.  “I owed her something and thought it best to come to her directly.  Then Juliet needed to talk to Carrie, and that’s what is happening now.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, Juliet,” Shanelle said as she rolled her eyes slightly.  “Poor girl still getting pushed around?”<br />
<br />
“That’s what I gathered,” I admitted.<br />
<br />
Shanelle shook her head.  “She’s just gotta deal with it.  Learn to suck it up and not take it from those bitches,” she said.  I had a decent idea of who Shanelle meant with that statement.  “That’s what I did.”<br />
<br />
“Stood up for yourself?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Sure did,” she said.  “Roxanne and her group, oh, I guess you heard that name, right?” she asked.  I nodded.  “Well, Roxanne and her group act like they own this place and they make it hard for new girls.  They tried that to me last year.  I let them have about a week’s time before I showed them I meant business.  They backed down after that.”<br />
<br />
“If you don’t mind me asking, what exactly did you do?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I told them if they didn’t back off, I’d rip all the hair out of their scrawny heads,” she said.  “I got carried away and I guess they got a little scared.  They haven’t given me any real problems since then.  Juliet’s just gotta do something to show she’s not afraid of them.  They’ll back off.”<br />
<br />
I smiled.  “I don’t think she’ll have a problem after today,” I said.<br />
<br />
Shanelle appeared confused.  “How do you know that?” she asked.</p>
