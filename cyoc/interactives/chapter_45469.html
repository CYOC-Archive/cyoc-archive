<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick was enjoying the sensation of the spray. That is until he started to feel his skin and muscles get tight. He opened his eyes to look down only to find that he couldn't bend his neck. He was getting scared but he couldn't feel or hear his heart beating which scared him even more. Whatever it was that was sprayed on him was sprayed again. He couldn't close his eye lids again so the liquid entered his eyes and stun them for a moment before it passed.<br />
<br />
The door opened and Ms. Freeman said &quot;Hurry up Henry. I want to melt him down, reshape him, and reanimate him before supper. Now Mr. Moss, I told you to keep your eyes closed.&quot;<br />
<br />
'WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!' Rick shouted in his head but of course she couldn't hear him. He could feel someone's arms wrap around him and lift him out of the booth. He saw Ms. Freeman before he was carried to a door and down some stairs. I a room at the bottom of the stairs he was placed in some sort booth with a funnel for a floor.<br />
<br />
Before the door was closed Ms. Freeman said &quot;I'll use mold number seven this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The door shut and all sound was cut off. Rick was really scared now and his fear rose even more when he felt the temperature rise rapidly. He tried moving but his body wouldn't respond. He tried calling out for help but that didn't work either. Now he was starting to sweat. Though as he sweating he noticed that his whole body was starting to get softer. Suddenly he lost the feeling in a few of his fingers and his dick. Just after he lost the feeling in those parts he heard something hit the bottom of the booth. After reviewing what he had heard he came to a disturbing conclusion. 'Shit' he thought. 'Somehow she turned me into wax and now she's melting me. How is this even possible?' He had about fifteen minutes to think it over. In that time he continued to melt and more pieces fell off. Finally he lost all feeling in his wax body. He also lost his hearing and then everything went dark as he lost his sight.<br />
<br />
Feeling slowly came back to his body and Rick was able to think again. 'What is going on now?' he thought. He noticed feeling on his chest that he shouldn't be feeling and he didn't feel his dick. Suddenly he saw light but it was like the light you see through closed eyelids. He could see shadows moving in front of him and then he was lifted up and placed on a table. He felt something scraping at his left ear which was weird since it seemed there was more than there should have been. Suddenly he was able to hear out of that ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hook up red hair, green eyes, and Caucasian light medium tan&quot; Ms. Freeman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything else?&quot; a male voice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Henry&quot; Ms. Freeman said.<br />
<br />
Rick could hear Henry leave and felt Ms. Freeman get back to work. She dug out his other ear and then it felt like she was smoothing out all along his side and in between his fingers and toes. She cut something off the top of his head and did something up there. She added wax to a few places most noticeably his chest. She continued to add and take off wax over the next hour or so. Rick had lost track of time then he finally heard someone else come in but whoever it was didn't say anything.<br />
<br />
When Rick couldn't feel anything being done to him he heard Henry say &quot;The reanimation booth is ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Ms. Freeman said. &quot;I just need to add my brand on her foot then you can take her up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick felt Ms. Freeman carve something in the bottom of his right foot and then it was filled in with wax again. Then he was picked up and carried up what he figured was two flights of stairs. After a couple of minutes he was laid down on another table and he heard a door close. He felt something being sprayed on him again. The spray hitting his chest felt weird as if he had breasts. The spray stopped and his body began to loosen up as he transformed back into flesh and blood. He took a breath and sat up.<br />
<br />
The door opened and Ms. Freeman said &quot;Welcome back to the land of the living Rachael.&quot;</p>
