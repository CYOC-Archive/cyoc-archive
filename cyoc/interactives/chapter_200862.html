<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jurgen trotted along at a decent speed with Mervin on his back. He&#39;d wanted to gallop, but Mervin had advised him to not push himself too much. While he was now physically horse that didn&#39;t mean he couldn&#39;t tire or exhaust himself. He still had his limits just like any other horse. The roads they travelled weren&#39;t busy. Only occasionally would a person pass them by. Whenever a person looked at Jurgen, it would make him nervous, like they&#39;d notice he wasn&#39;t actually a horse and freak out. Of course they had no reason to think he was anything but a normal horse. Why would they?<br />
<br />
Time passed and they covered a significant distance. Jurgen couldn&#39;t recognize his environment. He don&#39;t think he&#39;d ever been around here before. Also, it was getting dark, the sun had just set. Soon, it would be pitch black out here.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s about time we call it a day,&quot; Mervin said. &quot;I know an inn just up here. I figure we can stay the night there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon they happened upon a roadside inn. That must be the place Mervin was talking about. Jurgen wondered if he was supposed to stay a horse, or if he were to become a human again. He didn&#39;t have to wonder for long, because Mervin figured Jurgen was probably thinking about that.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can become a human again, is what I would say if I had enough magical energy. You see, It takes a lot of my energy to transform someone, especially from a human to a horse. I need time to recharge. Doing it now would completely drain me. You&#39;ll stay a horse tonight, but tomorrow if we keep up our current pace, we&#39;ll get to Svindelheim, and then you&#39;ll need a new form.<br />
<br />
Jurgen shook his head to show that he didn&#39;t mind. For now, it was fun being a horse. Though he guessed it would get boring at some point.<br />
<br />
Mervin entered the inn, leaving Jurgen standing outside. Standing there, Jurgen smelled something new, an intoxicating scent. It seemed to be coming from behind the inn. He wanted badly to go there, but he restrained himself. Soon Mervin exited the inn along with an small old lady. He guessed she was the innkeeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; she looked Jurgen over. &quot;We have space in the stable. Come.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mervin pulled Jurgen along. He could follow instructions on his own, but they figured it was best to pretend he was a normal horse. The stable was behind the inn, and it was exactly there that that amazing scent was emanating. They entered the stable. Jurgen saw the source of the scent. It was another horse. His cock stiffened. It hadn&#39;t been on his mind at all, but he just realized his massive equine member was there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think this is a good spot for it,&quot; the old lady gestured at a stall in the stable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems good to me,&quot; Mervin replied.<br />
<br />
Jurgen walked into the stall. The old lady closed the stall, and then she left together with Mervin, leaving Jurgen in the stable together with a mare, though in different stalls.<br />
<br />
Jurgen was very much enchanted by her. He wanted her. Just by her scent and he wanted her badly. He looked down at the stall-door that kept them apart. Only a plank was keeping it closed. If he could raise it with his head, he could do the same for her, and then there was nothing keeping them apart. He bent his head down, and after a few tries, he got it open. He rushed over to her stall and released her. They were now free to wander the stable.<br />
<br />
Jurgen had to idea how to socialize as a horse, so he tried to relax, letting his instincts take over. He walked with her. They brushed against each other a little, but barely much had happened until she demurely went into position. Jurgen did too. He used his massive cock to fuck the mare. It felt good. So fucking good. Then he came buckets into her. It didn&#39;t take long. It was almost painfully short, but it was maybe the best Jurgen had ever felt.<br />
<br />
As the animalistic horniness subsided. What had he just done? Jurgen was embarrassed. He&#39;d just lost his virginity. Lost his virginity to a horse of all things.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Mervin was settling in his room. He was already pretty sleepy. Expending magical energy did make one tired. He soon fell asleep.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Mervin went to the stable to get his familiar. He couldn&#39;t help but notice something. Jurgen was in a different stall than the one they left him in last night. Not only that, but the other horse seemed to have a different stall as well. He was sure that it was in the far end of the stable last night. Mervin guessed Jurgen had left his stall. Also, he must have released the other horse last night too. Mervin laughed. He had pieced together a naughty idea of what Jurgen could have done last night. He had to ask Jurgen about that, but not now. He wanted to his reaction. It would be more fun to see it when Jurgen is a human with proper facial expressions.<br />
<br />
The wizard and his familiar left the inn behind. They continued riding towards the city of Svindelheim.</p>
