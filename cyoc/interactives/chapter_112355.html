<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sheriff Douglas Cooper was finishing up some paperwork for the day. Hearing about Samantha Twist’s announcement to run for mayor at the next election, the were-grizzly sighs as he contemplates his career. Being elected as Sheriff; Douglas knows his term will soon come up. After having private talks with a few of his deputies, Douglas came away disappointed. None wanted his job, nor risk chancing to run against him. With Joan Morningcloud now in his life as well as his Cousin’s son Darrell; Douglas was contemplating a new career, one that had more agreeable hours to spend time with a growing child who will soon be in grade one at Moon Lake Elementary this coming Tuesday.<br />
<br />
Taking a moment to look at a picture of himself with his old partner John Shaffer Sr; Douglas couldn’t help but feel melancholy at the loss of his friend. The two growing up in Moon Lake; the were-grizzly and werewolf made quiet the odd sight when chasing game in the woods. Douglas while the strongest, was never as fast and agile as his werewolf friend. Always catching up to John, huffing and grunting after the buck or other large animal was caught; Douglas felt more at home wading in a stream full of salmon instead. Still, Douglas could not help but remember fondly of those times before they both left for Seattle to join the police force.<br />
<br />
It was an make shift explosive device that killed John Shaffer sr. Executing  a search warrant on a suspected drug house, Douglas heard the explosion going off in the adjoining room he was in. While the concussive force was muted thanks to the wall separating the two; Douglas was affected from it afterwards. Having to deal with migraines, only made worse during stress; it’s why the large bear of a man was seen with a bottle of Aspirin where ever went. It was a sad day for Douglas when he went to inform John’s wife and four year old son over the werewolf’s death.<br />
<br />
Putting the photo down; Douglas can’t help but stare at his partner’s youthful smiling face. His son John jr is the spitting image of sr.<br />
“Your son turned out alright old friend,” Douglas getting emotional; “but your wife Cathy. I’m sorry John,” Douglas taking a few Aspirin; “her alcoholism claimed her last year. It’s just your son and his Aunt Beth McDougal now.”<br />
<br />
Getting up and collecting his hat and leaving his office; Douglas heads to the dispatcher before leaving.<br />
“Has Officer Carter reported in yet,” Douglas asking the dispatcher on duty for the day.<br />
“He is still dealing with a family emergency,” the dispatcher answering; “from what he said, it had to do with his mother.”<br />
“When he finally reports back,” Douglas shaking his head; “tell him I need to talk to him. He’ll know where to reach me.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Entering his home after driving back from the police station; Douglas sighs as it looks like a bomb went off. With toys everywhere; Douglas knew his nephew Darrell was being his usual energetic self. He and Joan tried to clean up the mess several times in the past; only to find much to Joan’s amusement, Darrell leaving his toys all over the place hours later. Glad to see the hallway clear as he heads to his room; a room that Douglas is sharing with Joan.<br />
<br />
Over time, Douglas and Joan’s feeling grew towards each other; more so that whenever they get a chance, the two are spending and intimate moment alone with each other. Having to rut in the woods, while Darrell is minded by babysitters every so often; the were-grizzly and were-tigressess have made for quiet the happy couple. Her and his roars being heard in the forest as the two mate with wild passion. Despite the fact that Joan was finishing up her education to be an Electrical engineer, she still managed to make time for both Douglas and Darrell.<br />
<br />
Coming out of his room out of his sheriff’s uniform and now wearing shorts and a t-shirt; Douglas heads to living room to see Joan in her were-tigress fursona napping with a young were-mer snuggled in her arms.<br />
“It looks like you two had a fun day,” Douglas quietly speaking as he grabs a soda from the fridge; sipping it as he joins the two sleeping on the living room floor. Staring at Joan as she sleeps; her furry chest moving up and down as she breathes, eliciting a soft murmur every now and then. Placing his hand at Joan’s head and scratching the back of her ear; Joan starts to purrs as she jerks awake to see Douglas smiling at her.<br />
“Light sleeper I take it,” Douglas speaking.<br />
“Most cats are,” Joan yawning; “what time did you get home?”<br />
“Just a few minutes ago,” Douglas sips his soda; “I take it, Darrell felt the need to redecorate the home with discarded toys again.”<br />
“He was always like this,” Joan brushing back a lock of his hair from his face; “Alyssa sort of encouraged it. Always chasing him, laughing as the two bonded,” Joan sighing; “But Alyssa always made sure the kitchen remained spotless.”<br />
“Well if the kid is going to be like this for a few more hours,” Douglas staring a Darrell sleeping deeply; “perhaps you and I…”<br />
“Have a little fun before supper,” Joan growling; “help me get Darrell to bed first. His room isn’t much different than the living room, mess wise.”<br />
“You know,” Douglas grinning; “we’ll have to be quiet. A difficult task for a were to say the least.”<br />
“If your expect me to mewl,” Joan chuckling; “think again. I’m a tiger, and I like to roar.”<br />
“Roar quietly then,” Douglas helping Joan to place Darrell in his bed; “lest this little one catches us in mid rut.”<br />
<br />
It wasn’t long after than Douglas had his clothes off and fully shifted into his were-grizzly form. Staring at the lithe were-tigress before him in the living room no less; watching her get down on all fours, her tail thrashing wildly as her sex is exposed for him to see. Douglas’s pink ursine member proudly out of its furry brown sheathe; Eager to fill the aroused were-tigress before him. Douglas eager to mount Joan; he guides his throbbing member into Joan’s warm moist snatch as his large ursine frame surrounds and envelops Joan within his furry body.<br />
<br />
Feeling the thrusting of the large Grizzly pinning her to the ground; Joan can’t help but moan as the pleasure builds within her. The feeling of being claimed and dominated excites her as she is being mated by her mate. Like their first time all those months ago; the feeling of Douglas inside her was like fireworks going off in her head. Blinded by passion and fuel with lust as she feels his rod push her folds apart; feeling the tip of his member kissing her cervix as she gasps at the sensation of feeling pleasure that deep in her.<br />
<br />
With Douglas picking up the tempo and hearing his grunts as he continues pounding her sex raw; Joan starts to feel her muscles clamping and tightening, milking the ursine cock just as she feels a warm sensation flood her insides. Unable to resist as her body shudders in orgasmic release, she lets off a mighty roar as Douglas grunts with his own release. Not caring if the roar woke Darrell up; Joan collapses to the floor, with Douglas still in her; his member shooting his thick ropey jizz in her as they shift to spoon and enjoy their afterglow.<br />
“So much for being quiet,” Joan purring; “I couldn’t help myself. You just make me want to shout my love into the air.”<br />
“Told you it was difficult for us weres to be quiet,” Douglas wrapping his large paws around Joan; taking care not to harm her with his six inch long bear claws.<br />
“Hold me like this for a while,” Joan sighing; “I feel warm and safe with you enveloping like so.”</p>
