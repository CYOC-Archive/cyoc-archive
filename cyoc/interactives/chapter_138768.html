<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the sorceress asked for another volunteer all the kids turned their attention to her, except for one. Nate was still astonished for what happened to Caleb, after all the years being bullied by him, Nate had desired countless times for some punishment on Caleb, but this was too much even for him. He didn&#39;t just lose his childhood but he was humiliated in front of almost all the kids at school also.<br />
<br />
&quot;You.&quot; The sorceress exclaimed and when Nate turned his sight to her, he realized she was pointing at him. &quot;You&#39;re watching too much at Caleb. Do you like what happened to him? Do you want to join him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?!! NO!&quot; Nate shouted but it was pointless, the sorceress had already chosen him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come to the stage!&quot; The sorceress ordered but it didn&#39;t look Nate wanted to obey her. &quot;A tough boy, huh? I guessed Caleb was the only one here.&quot; She waved her hand and a green cloud covered Nate and teleported him to the stage. Nate was so scared that he was petrified on stage. &quot;Don&#39;t move? You looked way more tougher back there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, let me go.&quot; Nate said so lowly that the sorceress barely heard it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Don&#39;t you like to be here next to a gorgeous woman like me?&quot; The sorceress told him but she saw that, unlike Caleb, Nate wasn&#39;t feeling any attraction to her. &quot;Maybe you&#39;re still too young.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, please! Don&#39;t make me old like Caleb!&quot; Nate pleaded her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know him? Is he your friend?&quot; The sorceress asked him but he didn&#39;t answer. &quot;So, let&#39;s bring him back to the stage! What do you think?&quot; She asked to the audience who began to shout in approval.<br />
<br />
The sorceress waved her hand and a blue smoke covered briefly the stage. When it dissipated, a confused Caleb was on stage next to Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?!&quot; Caleb shouted as he realized where he was, almost immediately he tried to cover his manhood but it was too big that he just managed to focus audience&#39;s attention to it. He felt ashamed. &quot;Why am I back here? You said adults are not allowed in this show.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not an adult. You&#39;re a chicken.&quot; The sorceress told him and, like a switch in Caleb&#39;s mind, he went rigid for a second before he let out a loud cluck. He stopped covering his junk, put his hands under his armpits and began to act like a chicken.<br />
<br />
Some kids were laughing at him, some others were disgusted to see an almost naked man who used to be a boy a moment ago acting like a mindless animal,  walking around the stage like a chicken and pecking the ground occasionally. Caleb&#39;s speedo wasn&#39;t doing anything against his dick and balls bouncing as he moved.<br />
<br />
No one else but Nate could see Caleb&#39;s face red as a tomato and covered in tears. He could be acting like a chicken but he was still conscious of what he was doing. It was too embarrassing that Nate felt bad for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s better.&quot; The sorceress said before she put attention back to Nate. &quot;Now is your turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, no!&quot; He shrieked but it was useless, before he can even move a finger a green smoke covered him and when it dissipated after a few seconds Nate had doubled his age. &quot;Ugh.&quot; He groaned in a deeper voice and when he realized what happened to him he began to touch his face, his arms, his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good looking, Nate.&quot; The sorceress said but you&#39;re just as regular as Caleb was. When he heard that he realized he was naked and his penis was exposed to everyone&#39;s sight. It was rock-hard, maybe his first boner because he didn&#39;t know what to do, so he put his hands on it just like Caleb did before. &quot;Are you going to do the same thing that Caleb did? Don&#39;t you see him? It&#39;s useless!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, don&#39;t make act like a chicken!&quot; Nate begged to the sorceress completely embarrassed of his current condition.<br />
<br />
&quot;A chicken? You&#39;re not a chicken. You are like a cute little puppy!&quot; And with that words Nate stopped covering his junk and fell on his four. He took out his mouth and began to bark like a puppy. &quot;Who&#39;s a good boy? Who&#39;s a good boy?&quot; The sorceress said as she petted his short beard. &quot;What about some tricks?&quot; Nate barked happily although his face was turning red of shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shake hands!&quot; She ordered and Nate put his left hand on hers. It was funny to see that it was bigger than the sorceress&#39; hand. &quot;Now, roll over!&quot; Nate obeyed and rolled on the ground, he felt his junk moving as well. He was still hard but he can&#39;t do anything but cry as his face was still smiling. &quot;Aaand, play dead!&quot; Nate&#39;s eyes opened completely terrified of what he was about to do. He laid on his back and, although he was using all his willpower to don&#39;t do it, he opened his manly legs showing his erection to the sorceress and the kids. Disgusted wailings could be heard all over the place and Nate just wished his embarrassment ended soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not too big...&quot; The sorceress said. &quot;Come on, Caleb. Come here and play dead like Nate.&quot; She commanded and Caled, still acting like a chicken walked until he was next to Nate and laid on his back. He opened his legs just like Nate did and before he opened them completely his speedo vanished leaving him naked like Nate too. He tried to scream but all he managed to do was a loud cluck, Nate began to bark as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t need you to still act like animals.&quot; The sorceress said. &quot;But you can&#39;t move.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bitch!&quot; It was Caleb&#39;s first word when he recovered his talking. &quot;I&#39;m going to kill you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kill me?&quot; The sorceress grinned. &quot;On the contrary, I decided you&#39;re going to be my servants.&quot; She giggled. &quot;But my servants can be average looking. No! They need big junks.&quot; And with that, Nate&#39;s grew until it was big as Caleb and then they both grew even more until they were as big as horses&#39; ones. &quot;But big dick are pointless without proper balls!&quot; She said and their balls began to fill like water balloons. They both screamed when they felt their scrotums were going to explode but they didn&#39;t,  they just ended too tight.<br />
<br />
&quot;And maybe some people on the audience don&#39;t know this but your balls are full of semen. Do you know what semen is?&quot; She asked the audience. The kids reluctantly and sheepishly said no. &quot;Then, my friends here will show you! It will wake up his testosterone development too, so. In 3...&quot; Kids didn&#39;t know it but she increased their libido too. &quot;2...&quot; Nate and Caleb&#39;s faces were totally red and covered in sweat and tears. &quot;1... GO!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both men shot their loads to the air between groans and sobs. Like geysers, two thick streams of white goo went upward a few feet before they fell on the panting men. The huge amounts of semen were quickly absorbed in their bodies and they began to feel another change on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Testosterone means hair.&quot; The sorceress said as thick hair began to sprout everywhere on their bodies. Chest, arms, armpits, legs, crotch, testicles. Caleb grew a new beard and Nate&#39;s one grew even longer and thicker. &quot;And muscles.&quot; Their chests pumped like baked bread followed by their abs. Their arms grew bigger and stronger until they were as thick as professional bodybuilders. His legs did their grown too into tree trunks and finally their feet elongated to size 17, fattening as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can stand up.&quot; The sorceress told them and, although they struggled a lot, they managed to do it. It was practically undetectable to see what was left of the former Caleb and Nate on those huge and hairy men standing on the stage. They were so ashamed and they didn&#39;t hide their tears this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, who wants to join them?&quot; The sorceress said as sje looked for another kid in the audience.</p>
