<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Within 20 or 30 minutes, Damon had completely calmed down from his rage, panic and most of his humiliation. He still wasn&#39;t happy or accepting of his curse by any means. No, Damon was just bored. He was much too big to get up the stares and didn&#39;t have hands anymore to unlock the front door and go outside. He could stand up and sit down on his haunches or walk around in circles, but that was about it. Stuck in the living room as a donkey. Sure, he could go in the kitchen for a change of scenery, but there was so much scattered debris in there that it was hard to get around. Damon decided he felt pretty bad about that. It was going to cost his family quite a bit of time, work and money to clean up from his equine temper tantrum. He was now aiming his ears around in the hope that he WOULD hear somebody coming up the driveway, so he could just get it over with and get taken away to wherever randomly found donkeys get taken.<br />
<br />
Damon would have liked something to distract himself from what he did and what happened to him, but there really wasn&#39;t anything. He couldn&#39;t operate the TV in this form. He would probably crush his video games if he tried to use his front hoof on them. He certainly couldn&#39;t hold a book and turn its pages in this form, and his eyesight was too blurry to see written words anyway (although he reluctantly admitted to himself that his much larger field of view was impressive).<br />
<br />
* Do I even remember how to read? * Damon wondered, possibly psyching himself out a bit. He didn&#39;t know how much of his human intelligence he still had. Maybe his mind had changed too much for him to even notice it had changed? Damon tried to think of some science facts and how some big words were spelled. He thought he remembered them alright, but what if he was just too dumb to know he was wrong? It was useless to speculate, so Damon just went back to being bored.<br />
<br />
There was just NOTHING for a donkey to do in here! He was hungry, but there wasn&#39;t anything for a donkey to eat. He could see the front, the sides, and most of the back of this room, but he was only getting to see this one room. He could hear the birds and bees wind in the trees, but he was locked inside away from anything in nature. He was just there, with nothing to do. Nothing to do but get used to being a donkey. A BORED donkey. It was different from being a bored human, but not different enough. He couldn&#39;t twiddle his toes or fidget with his hands, but he COULD twitch his tail and swivel his ears. He couldn&#39;t pace the floor on two legs, but he could pace around on four. And that was about it. He didn&#39;t WANT to get settled into his new body and try to get some use out of his hooves, his tail and his ears. But there was nothing else to do.<br />
<br />
The thing that finally interrupted Damon&#39;s boredom was something he really didn&#39;t want to deal with in the living room. He had to pee. He had to pee REALLY bad. Too bad to ignore it again and just go back to being bored. And considering the size of his new bladder, he might make almost as much mess of the living room as he&#39;d made of the kitchen.<br />
<br />
* No, no, not here, not now. *<br />
<br />
Damon wouldn&#39;t fit in the bathroom, he couldn&#39;t get outside, and he couldn&#39;t hold it in much longer.<br />
<br />
* Oh, well, if I&#39;m just a farm animal, no one really expects me to hold it in anyway. *<br />
<br />
He relaxed his bladder a bit and was surprised to feel his tail raise up in an arc. He was disgusted by the wrinkly black hose that was worming out of his sheath. At least it wouldn&#39;t have to come all the way out for what he was doing with it. He felt the warm liquid surge down through his partially exposed penis to the tip. He knew it was going to be a lot, but he was still taken off guard by how forcefully it splattered on the floor, how fast it spread out across the carpet, and how long it took him to finish even though so much was coming out at once.<br />
<br />
* Is this what it&#39;s like to be a racehorse? Heh, heh. *<br />
<br />
It finally slowed to a trickle until it was just a yellow drip into the pond he&#39;d created. Damon  lowered his tail, readjusted his stance a bit, and felt his penis get tucked back up into his sheath. That&#39;s when it sank in that he was always going to be naked. Sure, at least his new body came with a handy storage pouch for his bare dick when it wasn&#39;t in use, but the pouch alone was bigger than any guy&#39;s penis, and no one was going to be able to miss his massive balls back there. And what if he got a hard on?<br />
<br />
* At least my empty bladder is a relief. *<br />
<br />
Or was it? The smell of his urine was coming from everywhere within a few feet, and his rear hooves splashed it up a little more everytime he shifted his weight. Damon kind of wished he&#39;d found a spot in the kitchen first which had already been destroyed. He&#39;d gone from a bored donkey to a bored donkey standing in its own piss.<br />
<br />
* I guess potty-training me was just a waste of time. *<br />
<br />
Even with the smell of his liquid waste everywhere, Damon&#39;s big equine stomach rumbled. He hoped someone would find him soon, if only he could go somewhere to get his new body something to eat. Fortunately, he didn&#39;t have to hope long, because his long ears perked up at the sound of a familiar car approaching from down the street.</p>
