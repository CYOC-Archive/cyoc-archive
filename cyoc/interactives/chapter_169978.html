<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">"Kat get your ass down here this second!" Was heard throughout the entire house. Kat didn't even think and ran downstairs, leaving behind Danielle and Yuna who were still in the bathroom. Neither of them really cared much about why Kat was called for. Insteqd they slipped back into the warm bath, as the air on their wet bodues was getting them a bit too cold for comfort. <br />
<br />
Kat was now face to face with her mother. She knew her mom was pissed but wasn't 100% certain why, or how much she knew already. She hoped that her mom hadn't yet found out about Dan's current predicament, and just was mad at her for using her magic unsupervised.<br />
<br />
"Why was it that when I came home, the house was full of magical traces? I certainly didn't leave it like this. Young lady, tell me exactly what you did, and I may not turn you into a real cat until you turn 30. Also, while I am at it, where on earth is your brother and who do you have over that has this great of a magical presence? I swear whoever they are, they have no courtesy, releasing this much magical power in someone else's home while they are a guest. Come on, spit it out. Who are they? Are they teaching you magic too? Am I not good enough for you that you went to find a magic teacher behind my back?" <br />
<br />
"No mom, that isn't it! I would never do that. I only want you as my teacher, I swear. That person is another matter... actually that is the biggest issue at the moment, and I need your help. I can't handle them by myself, because I don't really know what to do..." quickly answered Kat, hoping to distract her mother away from turning her into a cat for the next decade.<br />
<br />
"Is that so... fine, I will get rid of them for you. If you had a stalker, you should have just let me know. Given their magical power, I can see why you couldn't handle them yourself. Your magic simply was destroyed when it contacted their magic right? Let me go and great this unwanted guest." Now her mom had misunderstood. Furthermore she was likely going to either threaten, harm, or even possibly try to kill Danielle, as that was how things were resolved in the world of magic. <br />
<br />
"No wait! Don't harm them. They are not enemies or a stalker. Its.... its Dan. Something happened to him. I was mad at him and cursed him, but something went wrong."<br />
<br />
"Kat... I am just going to ask you directly. Are you not actually being sexually abused or harassed?" <br />
<br />
"Wh-what? No, wait why would you think that?" <br />
<br />
"Your, um, penis has been sticking out this entire time, so I just assumed..." said Kat's mother awkwardly. She really didn't want to open that can of worms. But after possibly having her daughter be abused, she had to be sure. <br />
<br />
"Ahhh, um.. I can explain. I was, um, well... I was... Sorry, I really... can't say it." Kat just wanted to crawl up into the tiniest ball she could and hide due to the amount of embarrassment she was feeling. How could she tell her mother that she gave herself a cock to fuck her brother with, after she gave him a pussy. And the fact that now she was extremely infatuated with said pussy, due to a backfired spell.<br />
<br />
"Huhhhh, Kat. Are you at fault for everything here?" <br />
<br />
"...Mostly, but Dan is also partly to blame too..." <br />
<br />
"Shhh. Not another word unless I ask you got it. I am very disappointed in you. Until I hear Dan's side, you will be only partially a cat. Should I feel like you need to learn a lesson, you can look forward to eatting cat foor for a long time. Now take me to Dan."<br />
<br />
"Kat's body in response to her mom's words underwent a partial change. Her ears turned cat like, along with her pupils. She grew a tail and her feet became paws. Her hands became half paws too and a layer of gray fur spread over most of her body, leaving just her front torso, head, and breasts uncovered. <br />
<br />
"Oh, you turned out better than expected. I may just keep you like this and force you to go out to do tasks for me as my assistant. I'm sure the other witches at the market will love your new look. Catch a mouse or 2 and they may even give you a part time job." Joked her mom.<br />
<br />
"Meow" ... "Meowwww." Kat was puzzled. Everytine she went to speak she felt an undeniable urge to meow.<br />
<br />
"Get use to it. You won't soeak unless I say to remember?"<br />
<br />
Kat understood. And now that she couldn't speak, she resorted to grabbing her mom's hand, pulling her towards the bathroom. She had to help Dan turn back to normal. Even if that meant she was a cat until 30, it was better than Dan being a lamia's mother for life. She reached the bathroom door and went to open it, but her new hands could no longer work the door knob.<br />
<br />
"Move" commanded her mom. Kat didn't hesitate to get out of the way as her mom barged into the bathroom without even knocking. Only after a second had passed in silence, did her mom point a finger at her completing her transformation into a cat.</p>
