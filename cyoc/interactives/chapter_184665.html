<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Okay now that he could stop Brandi from aging it was time for Josh to find a way to fix his computer. Unfortunately he wasn&#39;t that good with computers but he did have a friend that liked to tinker. Josh ran downstairs. Sitting on the living room couch was his aunt Sarah who only a few minutes ago was still his little sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey aunt Sarah?&quot; Josh felt really weird calling her that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear?&quot; Sarah&#39;s voice was much more raspy and mature than it used to be, he hadn&#39;t heard the 36 year old speak until now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would it be cool if I invited my friend Jasmine over? My computer&#39;s broke and she knows a thing or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah should be fine dear so long as she has a ride.&quot; Perfect. Josh pulled out his cellphone and dialed Jasmine&#39;s number.<br />
-----------------<br />
Jasmine heard the phone ringing in the kitchen. The 12 year old black girl skipped across the house and to pick it up. &quot;Helloooo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jasmine its Josh! I know you&#39;re pretty good with computers and mine is broken so I was wondering if you could-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes, yes I can!&quot; She shrilled through the line hopping up and down with her short 4&#39;6 frame. &quot;The only problem is my parents are gone for the weekend so I don&#39;t have a way to get there.&quot; Josh could hear her disappointment through the phone as the last line entered his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its cool we&#39;ll pick you up, let me just check...&quot; As he took his head from the phone there was more shrill excitement from the other end. He&#39;d always known Jasmine to be bombastic and energetic but never this electric to see him before, something must have changed now that he was 13. &quot;Hey aunt Sarah?&quot; Again it felt strange to call her that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear?&quot; This time Sarah was standing at her full 6&#39;5&quot; height, massive I cup breasts strangling the buttons on her shirt as they tried to keep them at bay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure we can&#39;t pick up Jasmine?&quot; Josh went for a pleading tone<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry hun but Auntie Sarah isn&#39;t legally allowed to drive right now, she might have gotten a little too tipsy a few months ago.&quot; As she went to pat Josh&#39;s head she ended up swating him with her tit. &quot;Mmmm... Sorry bud, I can&#39;t never seem to get these things to cooperate.&quot; She said as she felt herself up.<br />
<br />
Damn, Josh needed another option, and was his little sister, well aunt rather, an alcoholic in this reality? &quot; Tell you what Jasmine, we&#39;ll pick you up in 10.&quot; And with that Josh moved to his parent&#39;s room to work with the Chronivac further. He brought up Paisley&#39;s profile again and quickly changed her age to 16 and finalized it without looking at her stats. He would have aged himself up but he didn&#39;t want to risk changing his dynamic with Jasmine further, without her being here since it seemed that the Chronivac altered reality based off the moment at hand when the changes were made. As he knocked on his sister&#39;s door he realized it looked taller, infact looking down the hall, all the doorways looked taller, not to mention everything looked cleaner, newer, and fancier <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up little bro?&quot; He heard a very sexy voice exit the now open doorway. There she was. Paisley leaning up against the door frame, certainly his little sister no longer. She had gone from 4&#39;1, to 6&#39;0, to a huge 7&#39;2. Her breasts were at least a J cup, her hips were hitting the doorframe and the ass behind it could be seen from her front side. She was stunning and Josh was very uncomfortable with the boner he now had. How did this hap- oh... Josh realized she grew like that because he hadn&#39;t adjusted her proportions at the age of 6 back to normal, that must mean she still had to go through the rest of puberty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuuhhh... I was, I uuuuhhh&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Snap out of it, you&#39;re doing that thing where you stare at my tits and forget how to talk dummy.&quot; She socked his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Owwww!&quot; That actually hurt quite a bit apparently this giant didn&#39;t know her own strength. &quot;Sorry, um I was wondering if you could help me pick up my friend Jasmine, she needs a ride and-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its not some gross kid that&#39;s going to ruin my car right?&quot; She came out of her lean, turned away from her tiny brother and strutted over to her desk, her ass jiggling and swaying this way and that with each movement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, its Jasmine, she&#39;s pretty clean I&#39;d guess.&quot; Paisley&#39;s room was a lot bigger than before. It looked as though she had a walk in closet now complete with custom made designer clothes for the social media influencer to wear in different Instagram posts. Josh heard a light clinking as Paisley grabbed her keys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, let&#39;s get to it, my agent&#39;s picking me up for a photoshoot in an hour.&quot; The red head guided him out of the room. Josh couldn&#39;t help but watch as her massive breasts bounced with every motion. &quot;God you&#39;re thirsty.&quot; Paisley sighed catching his glances. While they moved through the house Josh could also see that everything was bigger and definitely more expensive, the entryway looked like that of a mansion. As the pair exited the house Josh was met with a very different front yard that was immaculately well-kept. Down the driveway was not the car he was expecting. It was a suburban, sure roomy but not nearly as flashly as he thought it would be based off of his new home life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get in dofus, you can gawk on another day.&quot; The giant of a woman had to make great efforts to fit her generous proportions into the car. Josh however felt the car was huge. The car ride was really without incident except for Josh constantly shooting his hot older sister glances which she generally didn&#39;t notice since she was jamming out to some pop tunes. As the car pulled up Jasmine&#39;s drive, Paisley waved for Josh to get out. Ge came right up to the from door and knocked. Almost immediately the front door swung open and standing in the door well was Jasmine. The short twig of a girl was super eager to see Josh, there was a light in her hazel eyes at the sight of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Josh! Its been too long.&quot; She hugged him as hard as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I guess so!&quot; Josh had literally seen her last week but then again, he had no idea what 13 year old Josh was up to these days.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking.&quot; Jasmine pulled out of the hug but held onto Josh&#39;s hand &quot;You really ought to have a girlfriend looking as good as you do, and I would like to put myself on the ballot for that title.&quot; She started tugging on Josh&#39;s arm as she headed for the car. Jasmine had always been very intelligent, honest, and forward but Josh never remembered her liking him before, perhaps something in his new appearance appealed to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuuhhh, well let&#39;s get that computer fixed and then maybe we can talk about it.&quot; Josh was a bit dumbfounded but he seemed to be on a roll with his bullshitting today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! A test! I always ace those... So be it!&quot; Jasmine smirked and headed to the opposite side of the car to get in.<br />
---------------------<br />
Once the trio arrived back at the Tanner Manor Josh led Jasmine up to his room and Paisley left to go to her photo shoot. Josh decided that it would be best to keep Paisley like this since she was bringing the family a healthy revenue, he&#39;d change her back if there were any issues.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright well, here it is. I spilled water all over it. Is there anything you can do?&quot; Josh gestured toward the computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmmmmmmm...&quot; Jasmine approached the tower and was suddenly shocked &quot;Ow!&quot; She began sucking her finger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit are you ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;m sure I can try and recover the hard drive.&quot; She unplugged the computer and began taking it apart. &quot;Gosh its hot in here, can you turn on the fan for me?&quot; Josh flipped the switch but as he turned back he knew something was off. Jasime looked bigger. Oh no, did that shock start the process on her too?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jasmine, how old are you again?&quot; Josh began to approach her, he could see with each breath Jasmine took, her chest looked a little puffier.<br />
<br />
&quot;13 years, 57 days, 13 hours, and 26 mintues, nice try I told you before babe, I always keep track.&quot; She pointed her index finger to her temple and bit her lip. She pulled out the hard drive from the shell, then took out her laptop from her backpack and plugged it in. &quot;Now then we just have to wait for the recovery, in the meantime, I think I&#39;ve earned my title&quot; the now 5&#39;1&quot; teenager lifted herself from the carpet. Her breasts were approaching D&#39;s, her ass fat, thighs thick, waist thin, and lips soft and lucious. She grabbed Josh by the face and bit his lip hard, she lifted the boy onto his bed and immediately started to rub her crotch against his in a repeated dry hump. With each pulse back and forth Jasmine grew larger and sexier but suddenly the festivities were put on hold by the ping of her laptop&#39;s notification that the process had finished. &quot;Well boy, to be continued.&quot; She blew him a kiss as she pulled away. For a moment she stood at her full 6&#39;0&quot; height and then returned to the floor and the laptop that awaited. &quot;Now what&#39;s this?&quot; Jasmine chimed. Josh was completely gone until he heard that and then immediately panicked realizing that Jasmine now had access to the hard drive and therefore the Chronivac with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhh nothing!&quot; He dove to the floor next to her and tried to get a hold of the laptop<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey now lover cool it!&quot; Jasmine took advantage of her much greater size, keeping the laptop away from Josh. As Jasmine explored the Chronivac program two pop ups appeared asking if they should end the process, one for a girl named Brandi, and one for Jasmine herself. She selected yes to both and then pulled up her profile. &quot;Whoa, did you put this all in? How did you get all my measurements?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t me it was...&quot; Josh might as well come clean. &quot;It was a program that came from a Sweepstakes&quot; He could see Jasmine&#39;s new specs on screen: 17 years old, 6&#39;2&quot;, H Cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? And what&#39;s the point? To have a database?&quot; She fiddled with a few things but didn&#39;t switch awarness to on. Josh watched as her breasts grew fuller and damp spots appeared on her shirt where her nipples were. &quot;Damn it even knows about my premature lactation. This is pretty fancy. But then again, where were we cute stuff?&quot; She put the laptop down and began making out with Josh again. &quot;Are you a virgin Josh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummmm no not really.&quot; He was quivering with excitement and pleasure<br />
<br />
&quot;Shame, I wanted to take that, guess I was too late. I always thought you were cute when you were little but once you turned 13, something flipped a switch and I&#39;ve been trying to sneak around your sister for ages, she&#39;s too protective. Thankfully she has a photoshoot without me for once.&quot; She placed her hand on Josh&#39;s zipper and tugged playfully at it. &quot;Will you indulge this upperclassmen Joshua? Jasmine came close enough to his ear for him to feel her breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am&quot; He stuttered forgetting all about Brandi in this moment.</p>
