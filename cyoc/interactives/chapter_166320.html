<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pinocchio and his new friend Candlewick strode through the streets of the Pleasure Island Amusement Park in search of fun. <br />
<br />
They had just stopped at one of the many food stalls and had gotten something to snack on. Candlewick had gotten a whole fried chicken and Pinocchio had got both a blueberry Pie and a cone of strawberry ice cream, which had all been free.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;d I tell ya, Pinoke,&quot; Candlewick said as he took a bite of his chicken. &quot;Pleasure Island is the real deal. No parents, no law, and you can do anything you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pinocchio nodded his head in agreement as he took a lick of his ice cream cone. &quot;You said it!&quot; he happily replied.<br />
<br />
Directly in front of them was a large tent full of mattresses, cushions, and pillows where boys and girls were engaging in a semi friendly scrap with each other using pillows and cushions as weapons, the kids were flooding the tent. <br />
<br />
Pinocchio and Candlewick decided to enter to participate in the pillow fight, there they took two pillows and began to beat other kids with them until they broke, shedding feathers throughout the tent.<br />
<br />
Pinocchio watched as Candlewick went up to a pair of girls that were in the middle of the pillow fight. One of them was a blonde who was wearing a light blue sailor&#39;s dress and a yellow hat, and the other had reddish hair and wore a red pinafore tartan dress and a beret. <br />
<br />
Candlewick&#39;s initial intention was to tease both girls and hit them by surprise with his pillow. However, looking closely at the pretty face of the blonde, he began to fall in love. Seeming love at first sight, Candlewick lowered his pillow to speak to her. However, Pinocchio hit him hard with the pillow from behind knocking him off balance.<br />
<br />
When he got up, Candlewick had lost sight of that beautiful girl among the crowd of children. That angered him, but not knowing that Pinocchio had hit him, he continued playing.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Candlewick grew bored and both he and Pinocchio moved on. <br />
<br />
Their next destination was a part of the park called &quot;Tobacco Row&quot;, where Pinocchio and Candlewick both scooped up a supply of cigars and pocketed them for later use. Pinocchio had never smoked before, but he was game to try anything that Candlewick would. <br />
<br />
As they both smoked their cigars, they could see an old west style saloon towards the back section of Tobacco Row. Next to the saloon was a stable and outside the stable were a pair of little donkeys just like the ones that pulled the Coachman’s Coach. <br />
<br />
The donkeys had ropes around their necks that were tethered to wooden posts in the ground. Next to the donkeys was a wooden sign that read: “PLEASE, TEASE THE DONKEYS”, which was what a group of children were currently doing. <br />
<br />
They each tied a firecracker around the donkeys’ tails and were in the process of lighting them with a match. <br />
<br />
The terrified little donkeys tried to resist and get away, but they were firmly tethered to the post and could not escape. <br />
<br />
As a girl grabbed the tail of one of the donkeys, a boy struck his match and prepared to light it. That donkey turned his head to face the girl and the boy and shook his head desperately back and forth, his right hoof raised in a begging motion. <br />
<br />
But the boy with the matches paid no attention to the little donkey’s silent pleas and lit the firecrackers attached to its tail. The donkeys cried as the firecrackers went off, but their tears seemed almost like that of a human kid.<br />
<br />
Next Pinocchio and Candlewick made their way to an area of the park where a large and elegant mansion style house stood. Near the house was a sign that read: &quot;MODEL HOME OPEN FOR DESTRUCTION&quot;. <br />
<br />
The house was built specifically for the children on the island to vandalize and destroy. Boys and girls were wrecking everything they could both inside the house and out. They toppled over flowers in their vases. They pushed ornate marble statues over so that they would shatter into pieces. They hurled bricks into windows. They busted down doors with axes. <br />
<br />
And that was just on the outside. <br />
<br />
Inside the kids trashed the building as much as they wanted. You can saw a girl splashed and slashed a replica of famous painting or a boy chopped the limbs off the furniture with an axe. <br />
<br />
The children rummaged through drawers and pulled out everything they could till it littered the floor. They did everything and anything they could to destroy the lovely house till it was practically a shadow of its former glory. <br />
<br />
Candlewick struck his match across the trashed painting of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; which now laid on the floor and lighted his cigar he pulled from out of one of his pockets. <br />
<br />
&quot;What did I tell ya?&quot; Candlewick asked Pinocchio as he took a whiff of his cigar. &quot;Ain’t this a swell joint?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Pinocchio replied as he busied himself with chopping the limbs off a pricey piano. &quot;Being bad’s a lot of fun, ain’t it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Told you,&quot; Candlewick said with another puff of his cigar. &quot;Honest John never lies. Get a load of that stained-glass window.&quot; <br />
<br />
Candlewick turned and pointed up at an unbroken window that was above them. He then picked up a brick from the floor and pitched it right up into the air like a baseball, smashing the window in shards of broken glass. <br />
<br />
Pinocchio clapped his hands and laughed as Candlewick took a bow for his ace throw. <br />
<br />
Finally the pair found themselves in an area on the farthest side of the amusement park called: &quot;The Forest of Sweets&quot;, which is exactly what it was. Nestled in the back between the rocky cliffs that surrounded the entire island was an entire forest made of candy and sweets. <br />
<br />
Aside from the ground -- the grass -- and the rocky cliffs that surrounded the area, everything was completely and deliciously eatable. The grass was made of soft minty sugar, and the kids bent down and took big handfuls of that sweet grass. <br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it wonderful!&quot; said a boy there. &quot;Hasn&#39;t it got a wonderful taste? I could eat the whole field!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; answered the girl next to him grinning with delight, &quot;I could go around on all fours like a cow or a donkey and eat every blade of grass in the field!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trees had branches of gum drops, candy apples and chocolate. The stones that pebbled the paths across the grass were jaw breakers. The whole forest was a kid&#39;s wish come true and the boys and girls did not miss the opportunity to fill themselves with those sweets.<br />
<br />
There was even a stream of chocolate that was drinkable. Pinocchio saw on the riverbanks that there were many children scooping, drinking and even swimming in it. Among them was a slim girl with two thick pigtails, a light yellow dress and a bonnet who was kneeling and using both hands to hold the delicious liquid chocolate and drink it.<br />
<br />
Pinocchio and Candlewick took refuge in a row of life sized gingerbread houses that were fully furnished and took a brief break from all the fun they were having. <br />
<br />
&quot;Boy, this is the life, ain&#39;t it Candlewick?&quot; Pinocchio remarked as he took a bite out of a caramel covered candy apple he pulled off one of the trees. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know it, Pinoke!&quot; Candlewick replied as he stuffed his face with various chocolately treats. &quot;I thought living on the streets were exciting, but this place is WAY better! I don&#39;t never wanna leave!&quot;</p>
