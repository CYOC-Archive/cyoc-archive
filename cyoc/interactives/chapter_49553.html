<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Realising that it was now summer, you headed for Cynthia's bedroom. Behind you, your best friend is following, asking you all sorts of questions on what the two of you could do today.<br />
<br />
Absently, you listen to suggestions of going swimming if your mom lets you, playing dress-up and other suggestion that suddenly strike you as not silly and girly, but actually really fun. Bothered by this train of thought, you strip off your nightshirt and standing naked in Cynthia's room, you cast about for the backpack of clothes you brought over after dinner the previous evening.<br />
<br />
After a bit, you look at Cynthia...who is now wearing a pair of Hello Kitty underwear and searching through her dresser...and ask, &quot;Have you seen my backpack?&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking over at you, she turned around and looking about the slightly disheveled room, she shrugged and then offered, &quot;No. But I can help you look. I mean, it's got to be around here somewhere,&quot; and then dropping to the floor, she began to look under the bed.<br />
<br />
Thirty minutes later, you heave a sigh and announced, &quot;It's gone. And now I have no clothes except my nightshirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casting about the room, Cynthia shrugged after a bit and then said, &quot;Well...you can wear some of my clothes since you can't find yours.&quot; and then seeing the look on your face, she added in, &quot;Until we find your pack, that is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing no other option, you nodded in agreement and walking over to Cynthia's dresser, you begin to go through the top drawer. Behind you, you friend announced, &quot;Think I'll wear a dress today and headed for the closet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dressed, finally, you followed Cynthia toward the kitchen, thinking about locating the note and torn between wanting to destroy it and wanting to leave it alone. Looking down, you take in the white tank-top you're wearing, the two large pink hearts on the front and the blue hem and collar. Looking further down, you look in wonder at the jeans you are now wearing...button and zipper-less in the front and a waistband in back that moves like it is made of elastic.<br />
<br />
All in all, you think that your outfit made you look younger then what you really are. As you ponder this over, barely giving thought to the tight, white panties you are wearing, you sit down at the table, gently swinging you feet back and forth.<br />
<br />
As you sat there, and Cynthia went to look for something for you and her to eat, it slowly dawned on you that you had shrunk at some point. Standing up, you follow your best friend into the kitchen and the moment you get there, you asked, &quot;Do I look shorter?&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at you with a serious expression, Cynthia shrugged and then said, &quot;There's a tape measure in one of these drawers. You can use it to find out if you want to figure out whether you've shrunk or not.&quot; and then she turned and went back to searching through the different boxes of cereal.<br />
<br />
Moving to a drawer, you begin to search. After looking through several drawers, you give up and instead join Cynthia at the table. Sitting down to eat, realising that Cynthia is now taller then you, you instead turn you mind to other things...like what you and your best friend are going to do for the rest of the day, to which Cynthia has a long list of suggestions.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Hours later, you lay upon your bed, staring at the ceiling. Below you, and curled up in her sleeping bag, you can hear Cynthia breathing deeply in her sleep.<br />
<br />
As you lay there, you suddenly think about the note and then give up on ever really finding it again. &quot;Not that I would want to,&quot; you tell yourself mentally as you recall the day you spent with Cynthia and how fun it had turned out to be.<br />
<br />
After breakfast, the two of you went swimming, with your mom's consent. Afterward, you and Cynthia went indoors and, much to your surprise, you quickly found yourself playing various games that would only amuse a little girl: House, dress-up, dolls...the list went on from there. Afterward, the two of you went back to your place for lunch...Cynthia's mom still wasn't home from work and probably wouldn't be home until around one AM.<br />
<br />
Afterward, you and Cynthia went up to your room and collecting you Ballet outfit, the two of you returned to Cynthia's home...to which you spent the day practicing your forms and movements.<br />
<br />
By the time dinner came, you had completely forgotten the note, but only remembered it when you sat down and discovered that over the day you had shrunk even more. But you had no real time to dwell on it as you first ate your dinner and then spent the rest of the evening watching the television with Cynthia.<br />
<br />
Now, listening to Cynthia deep breathing, you slowly slide out of bed and quietly pad to bathroom, noting that it is almost eleven and that you have been in bed for nearly two hours.<br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom, you reach up and flick on the switch. Closing the door, you turn and look into the mirror you mom hung on the back of the door. Reflected back you see a person with dishwater-blonde hair that falls past their shoulders and down midway their back and wearing a white and pink nightgown with Angelina Ballerina on the front. After staring at your reflection a bit longer, you reach down and slowly lift up the nightgown.<br />
<br />
Shedding the garment, you spread your legs and looked at the one other thing that had changed...and the one thing you weren’t sure if you should tell Cynthia about just yet.<br />
<br />
Situated now between your legs...and looking smaller than they did this morning...you look at your penis and testicles, wondering if and when they would disappear completely...to be replaced by a girl's private parts. You are only aware of this bit of the transformation because of the strange, ticklish feeling that was slowly growing inside your lower abdomen and groin…A feeling that started sometime this morning. <br />
<br />
Unsure what this feeling meant, you instead turned and reaching inside one of the sink drawers, you take out the clothe tape-measure your mother kept there.<br />
<br />
Unrolling it, you place one end under your foot and then stretch the other end upwards. After a bit of trying to get it placed in the right spot to take your height accurately, you finally manage and taking the measuring tape away, you stare at it blankly, unsure what the numbers mean.<br />
<br />
Shaking your head, you reapply the tape-measure and take your height again. In total, you do this about four times before you are finally able to get you mind to focus and process what is before you. As you take in the fact that you now stand three foot six inches...and notice in the mirror that some of your baby fat has returned...you asked yourself, &quot;What is happening to my mind? Is this something to do with Cynthia’s wish?&quot;<br />
<br />
But for all your thinking, you are unable to come up with an answer and in the end, you put the tape back and shrugging on your nightgown, you flip the light switch off and plod back to bed.<br />
<br />
Curling up under your Hello Kitty comforter and sheet set, snuggling closer to your favourite dolly, you let your mind wander. As it settles on the note, you insert your thumb into your mouth and slowly drift off to sleep.</p>
