<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hmmm,&quot; Dan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Kat asked.<br />
<br />
Dan hung his head, swung his right foot around a bit and sighed. “Okay but this is going to sound stupid.”<br />
<br />
“Out with it Dan. The clock is ticking. I have things to do,” Kat said.<br />
<br />
“Okay, okay. You see there’s a friend I have at school, Ollie Green. His brother Jack, well, not brother any more, sister now. I … um, I know about magic because this guy turned Ollie’s 23 year old brother into a female skunk, a humanoid one,” Dan said.<br />
<br />
Dan pictured her in his mind. She had flowing white hair that went halfway down her back, white fur on her belly, chest, feet and arms and a long luxurious tail with a white stripe down the sides of it.<br />
<br />
“Yes?” Kat asked.<br />
<br />
“Can you um … exchange our forms. I mean, she doesn’t like being a skunkette. She was a cool guy and even had a girlfriend. Can you take my humanity away and give it her in exchange make me a skunk girl?” Dan asked.<br />
<br />
Kat folded her arms. “You’re kidding right? You make a sacrifice for another person?”<br />
<br />
“The way I think of it, you’re going to make me an animal anyway. I might as well help someone if I can,” Dan said.<br />
<br />
“All right Dan. In fact, I *can* do this. You see I can’t really remove the spell of another magic user. However, such an exchange I can do. I will exchange this persons skunk and female for your male and human,” Kat said.<br />
<br />
Kat waved her wand and Jack the skunkette appeared before the duo. She was wearing a light blue tee shirt and shorts. She appeared shocked.<br />
<br />
“What … what’s going on?” Jack asked.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, I’m going to help you,” Dan said.<br />
<br />
Inside, Dan couldn’t believe what he was about to do. Him, a female; the idea was terrifying. Dan, in truth knew nothing about women. Now, he was going to be a skunk woman.<br />
<br />
“Dan? I don’t understand. What are you going to do to me?” Jack asked.<br />
<br />
“Relax Jack. I know you don’t like being a female skunk. You don’t have to be one any more,” Kat said.<br />
<br />
“W…what are you going to do?” Jack asked.<br />
<br />
“Jack I … I’m going to become a skunkette so you can be a guy again,” Dan said.<br />
<br />
“What? No, I … I don’t like being a skunk but that’s not fair to you!” Jack protested.<br />
<br />
“Please? Kat says she’ll turn me into an animal anyway. I might as well make it worth it to you,” Dan asked.<br />
<br />
“How will I be able to live with myself knowing my salvation condemned you to this?” Jack asked, pointing, to herself.<br />
<br />
Kat sighed. “Look skunkie, I can always turn Dan into a fat smelly pig and be done with it. Better this then that isn’t it?”<br />
<br />
Jack hung her head. “Yes.”<br />
<br />
“Jack, don’t worry about it. I know you don’t like being this way. Who knows, maybe I’ll like it,” Dan said.<br />
<br />
Nodding Jack sighed. “So, what do I need to do?”<br />
<br />
“First, both of you, take off your clothes,” Kat said.<br />
<br />
“Um?” Dan asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh give it up Dan, you won’t need to worry as this won’t be your body for much longer. Jack, we’re not related, so it’s not like it’s a big deal,” Kat said.<br />
<br />
Dan sighed and removed his clothes while Jack did the same. Now naked, Dan looked at Jack’s female skunk body, the body that would soon be his. She was beautiful; at least Dan knew he would be good looking even if he had to be half animal.<br />
<br />
“Now, let’s get started,” Kat said.<br />
<br />
Pointing her wand at Dan and then at Jack, Kat began chanting. A chill ran down through Dan’s spine. He found himself having doubts; this was crazy! Sweat trickled down Dan’s forehead. Then, like a mallet, it hit him.<br />
<br />
Some unseen force lifted Dan’s body into the air. Dan quivered. He saw Jack’s body also floating in mid air. Blue energy began to stream from Dan’s body into Jack’s while pink energy flowed into Dan’s body from Jack.<br />
<br />
Dan gasped at the sight of Jack’s breasts deflating. At the same time, Dan felt a weight on his chest. He looked down to see fat building around his nipples which were growing longer and wider.<br />
<br />
It was happening for real! Dan was turning into a girl!<br />
<br />
A tingling passed over Dan’s skin as it became softer while his leg, arm and chest hair thinned and vanished into his body. His head hair, all that remained began to grow. At the same time, Jack’s head hair was getting shorter and her hips were narrowing while her waist widened somewhat.<br />
<br />
Dan quivered again. He looked down to see his manhood shrinking as a fold of skin formed near the slit on Jack’s body. Gulping, Dan watched Jack’s slit vanish as his penis grew back and his testicles re-appeared. Dan didn’t want to look, but he couldn’t resist. He looked down at his own body. His manhood was getting shorter and his testicles were vanishing into his own body. He felt a sharp pain as his hips attained a feminine appearance.<br />
<br />
In seconds, Dan had a slit between legs that were looking shapely. The weight on Dan’s chest was getting heavier and he saw that Jack’s chest was all but flat. Dan had seen them growing as he watched what made him a male vanish. Now, he could no longer deny it. He had breasts. They were a healthy size, not too large, but at his age, he still had developing to do.<br />
<br />
Dan’s hair was halfway down his back and Jack’s was short. Jack now had a washboard stomach. Except for Jack’s face, Jack was a male again. That quickly changed. Dan felt warmth overtake his, (now her) face. He watched Jack’s features grow more masculine.<br />
<br />
Soon, a skunk-man floated before Dan.<br />
<br />
Dan was a girl; he couldn’t believe it!<br />
<br />
“Now comes the fun part!” Kat said.<br />
<br />
The streaming blue and pink energy between Jack and Dan vanished. Dan gulped as she watched black and white energy begin to flow from Jack.<br />
<br />
Jack’s fur began to retreat into his body. All the while, Dan felt a terrible itching all over her skin. Black and white fur coated Dan’s body. It was white on her feet, hands, chest, crotch and although she didn’t see it, around her eyes and lower jaw. Black fur covered elsewhere with the exception of a stripe down Dan’s back.<br />
<br />
Dan’s once brown hair turned black with a white stripe down the middle as Jack’s turned red.<br />
<br />
Gasping, Dan now watched Jack’s tail shrink as she felt a tingling above her rear end. She turned her head to see a small tail grow larger until she had a tail as impressive as Jack’s was while Jack lost his tail. Jack was now human except for one thing, his face.<br />
<br />
Dan felt another quiver as his jaw reshaped while his ears became rounded and moved up to the top of his head.<br />
<br />
Then, as soon as it began it was over. The black and white energy faded and Dan and Jack were lowered back to the ground. Jack was a human male again while Dan was a female humanoid skunk.<br />
<br />
“I’m … a human and a guy again!” Jack said. He then looked at Dan, who was unsure what to think. “I’m sorry Dan, this isn’t fair to you.”<br />
<br />
Dan looked down at her body and shrugged her shoulders. “At least you get to be human again. I was screwed anyway, so I might as well have helped you. Besides, you’re a cool guy; you deserved better then to have something you didn’t want forced upon you. Who knows, I just might grow to like this.”<br />
<br />
“How noble of you brother,” Kat said.<br />
<br />
“Dan, I’ll find a way to help you, I promise that,” Jack said.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure you will. Now, let’s get you back home,” Kat said.<br />
<br />
Before Jack could react, Kat teleported him back to his house.<br />
<br />
“So, sister, what do you think of being a girl and a skunk?” Kat asked with a grin.</p>
