<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You felt the strange sensation that typically accompanied the use of the Veil. Only this time, it felt unfocused, spreading throughout your body and leaving your skin tingly and sensitive.<br />
<br />
You closed your eyes and gritted your teeth, bracing for the worse...<br />
<br />
After a time, you opened one eye. Then the next. You looked down at yourself and, despite still being humiliatingly female, nothing had changed. You sighed with relief.<br />
<br />
And then it hit you.<br />
<br />
All at once.<br />
<br />
Your still-unfamiliar female body felt like you were being shoved and squeezed Ina dense crowd of people. Not especially unpleasant, if quite strange and claustrophobic.<br />
<br />
You stared your sister straight in the eye, and as the years vanished from you, you realized you had to crane your neck up further and further to maintain eye-contact. Your hair fell in front of your eyes in messy strands, soft and silky as they tickled your adorable button nose and softening lips.<br />
<br />
Anger gave way to loathing as you realized Emily used your exact words against you, making sure to give you exactly what you would have given her had you had the chance.... If things went your way, <i>she</i> would have been the one dwindling down younger and younger, clutching her slipping panting and reverting to a ever more helpless and vulnerable body for your enjoyment... <br />
<br />
A shameful moan escaped your lips as your perky little breasts, already just a modest handful, tightened and shrank until they were but soft little mounds with stiff, sensitive little nubs, still clearly announcing your budding femininity to the world.<br />
<br />
For a moment, you felt your vision blur and then refocus as a pair of cute, large glasses pinched your petite nose.<br />
<br />
Your boy clothes vanished as your whole room dissolved in a whirlwind of chaos. At the same time, you could feel new memories nestle themselves against your old ones, leaving you confused as both your old reality and new one were intertwined awkwardly.<br />
<br />
The memories of growing up with your big sister, admiring and following her around as you awkwardly mimicked her, craving to be as pretty as she was clashed against those of you trying to get away from your annoying little sister Emily, bullying and humiliating her whenever you could to drive the message home.<br />
<br />
You gasped as new first memories entered your mind. The first time you fell asleep in your sister&#39;s arms. The first night you felt a strange and mesmerizing sensation well up between your legs as you rubbed your stuffed bear between your clenched thighs. The first time you saw a boy&#39;s thingy at a friend&#39;s house, on her big sister&#39;s computer, and how you stood there, both mesmerized and fascinated by the shape and girth of the foreign object. The first time you recieved a ventine&#39;s day letter from a boy you liked, and how you held hands in the park after school, your body vibrating with strange desires you had no words to explain yet. <br />
<br />
You shook your head, realizing that Emily... Tiny-little short Emily, had almost a handful of inches on you! <br />
<br />
That must mean you were positively petite! A pipsqueak! Instinctively, you wrapped your weak, thin arms around your petite chest, trying not to let your eyes linger to what was between your legs... <br />
<br />
Or rather, <i>what wasn&#39;t.</i><br />
<br />
The chaos swirling about your room finally settled as the new reality solidified around you. The one where you not only had been born a silly, petite, weak girl, but one where Emily had all the power over you, both by virtue of being the big sister, and having the Veil in her possession... <br />
<br />
You glanced about your room, and saw pastel-colored walls surrounding a bed almost swallowed with cute stuffed animals. On a small desk, a sleek little laptop had replaced your gaming machine. String lights and pictures were hanging from the walls, giving the space a feeling of cuteness and simple comfort. A few thin, girly articles of clothing littered the floor. The room of a girl having yet to choose what childish things she&#39;d bring with her into adulthood, and what she&#39;d leave behind... <br />
<br />
You felt a strange sensation as clothes wrapped themselves around your petite frame, making you gasp in surprise as you felt the soft fabric of your cotton panties slide over your smooth mound and hug your still achingly-wet-and-needy sex snugly. A sudden feeling of tightness wrapped itself around your chest, cupping your petite breasts in a way that didn&#39;t hide their presence, but successfully concealed the stiffness of your nipples in a humiliatingly girly training-bra. A spagetti-strapped simple black tank top rolled down from your shoulders to your flat tummy, flaring out just slightly at the hips, revealing the frilly lace that peeked under the hem of your shirt. With a final flourish, you felt cream overalls snap themselves over your shoulders, stopping just below your thighs and making you feel more exposed than you were just by virtue of its form-fitting snugness. <br />
<br />
As you looked into the full-Lenght mirror in the corner of your room, a delightful young girl looked back at you. Her shoulder-lenght hair were the same color yours was as a boy, but smoother, silkier and now framed a cute, bespectacled heart-shaped face. The longer strands caressing your bare shoulders in a way that definitely felt.... Distracting. For a myriad of reasons you were both thrilled and terrified to explore. <br />
<br />
Your slender body was frail, weak and definitely girly. Despite your budding breasts being just hints, pushing slightly at the front of your overalls, it was clear your figure was that of a girl. In fact, the snugness and tightness of your overalls left nothing to the imagination, clearly showing the absolute smoothness of your crotch... Your blooming teen-girl hips completed the shape of you, and there was something latent and seductive about you you couldn&#39;t quite place your finger on... Nor really wanted to at the moment. <br />
<br />
Emily whistled teasingly as she looked down at you, then up at your room. &quot;Wow, And here I thought my room was girly! Looks like mom and dad really went all out when they saw they had another girl huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t help but feel overwhelmed. Your room, your body, your age, your memories, your size... It all came crashing down in you and you snak to your knees, tears welling up and running down your cheeks freely, as you heard the soft whimper of a girl crying... &quot;I don&#39;t want any of this... I&#39;m... I&#39;m supposed to be a boy!&quot; you sobbed. <br />
<br />
Emily scoffed. &quot;With how tight those overalls are, I can promise you that if you were a boy, that poor little penis of yours would be strangled in there.&quot; <br />
<br />
She approached you, standing tall in front of you, her expression impassive. &quot;If you think crying is enough to make me turn you back, remember, you&#39;re only in this situation because, if you had your way, it would be me on my knees, crying and begging you to change me back... And that&#39;s if you even left me old enough to be able to speak, or if it made your prick hard to imagine me crawling around naked, babbling like a baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shook your head, sobbing harder. It was true... If you had your way, you would have loved to see her de basing herself as a helpless baby while you thought of humiliating and arousing things to do to her, body and soul... You couldn&#39;t helo but feel that, perhaps, in some small way, you deserved this... You deserved to be powerless and weak...</p>
