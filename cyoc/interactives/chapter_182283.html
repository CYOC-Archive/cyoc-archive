<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I can’t believe I’m doing this” I exclaimed in my mind as my body walked slowly and sexually towards my old office. The high heels and short skirt making sure that each slow sultry step was a mesmerizing experience to any male gazes directed at me from across the large office. Several times I tried to turn around and walk away in the opposite direction from my old office but each time I found myself reoriented back towards my old office door almost as if reality changed its layout around me in order to obey the orders given to me by my old body. Without even thinking about what I was doing I knocked on Mr. Travers door softly “wait no I meant Mr. Travers, wait no why can’t I say Mr. Travers, no dammit!” Opening up the wood paneled door I peaked my head in the room through the crack and asked softly “Yes Mr. Travers? Did you need me for something”<br />
<br />
“Oh hello Janet” my smiling boss answered behind his desk” I wanted to ask you some questions could you come around my desk for a moment?” I wanted to run and scramble for the magic pen that I saw sitting tantalizingly close to me on Mr. Travers desk and reverse this self-imposed nightmare. I also knew that an order was an order whether it was vocalized in that way or not and I felt that I needed to obey him like I needed to eat, or breath as there was no other way around it. Closing the door behind me I picked up my pace in a way that my slow walk turned more into a sexy trot and came to a stop a short distance from Mr. Travers as he sat in his office chair and turned to the side to direct his entire body towards me. “Hey Janet come closer” he said in a slow, soothing tone as he Grabbed both of my hands with his own and drew me towards him until I was less then a foot from his open lap.<br />
<br />
With an expectant faith not matching mine at all which was one of extreme nervousness Mr. Travers then told me to take my top off which I immediately obeyed even as my inner mind screamed at the injustice of what was going on. Heaving my strained breasts from that suffocating tube top was like a godsend to me as even though I didn’t ever feel any discomfort as to their size and weight the clothing put up around them definitely hugged my body a little too tightly. I dropped the top to the floor and unbeknownst to me gave Mr Travers an expanded view of my bust as I breathed in a triumphant breath into my lungs forcing out my massive chest even more. I had closed my eyes for a few short seconds as I drew in the breath and released it to stare into the face of Mr Travers who was smiling with his teeth at me and his pupils were dilated and focused squarely on my chest. I had revealed at removing the tube top a tight black leather lingerie bra still barely holding my gigantic breasts in place. Even though the tightness was still very uncomfortable seeing the look on Mr. Travers face and knowing what he was thinking to do next didn’t sit right with me. Feeling very exposed and not completely right about how this situation was turning out I thought I could quickly lean to the side with Mr. Travers eyes still fixated on my chest, grab the pen, put it to paper, and end this nightmare but before I started to put this plan into motion my boss beat me to the punch. “Janet take off your bra” Mr. Travers said with a little more forcefulness in his voice then usual probably highlighting his impatience. “Oh god” I thought as I reached behind my back and unclasped my bra strap.<br />
<br />
My breasts finally flung free as the bra fell to the floor and this time I let out a throaty murmur of pleasure as the constriction had ended. I took a deeper breath then before in thanks to this deliverance and closed my eyes to take in the relief. My feelings of singular essence were short lived though for as soon as I had reached the peak of my breath I felt a pair of hands grab and begin to knead each breast. Sucking in the last air to fit into my lungs in a yelp and opening my eyes I saw that Mr. Travers was holding and rubbing each of my breasts in a concentrated fashion. “Stay still please Janet” said Mr Travers as he continued his professional exam of my breasts before adding several seconds afterward “I was right earlier not a bad pair at all” The first second it began I was in an uproar at what he was doing to me and my body but after that moment I didn’t care anymore at what he was doing to me. I would have stayed right where I was even if he didn’t tell me. Even my subconscious male-mind was no longer arguing with me to get the pen and end this charade as the feelings felt so good. After a few seconds my eyes rolled up into my head as I closed my eyelids and lowered my head. My breathing rate increased by several times and my tongue hung slightly out of my mouth. My arms felt weak and my legs felt like they were going to give out beneath me and a strange wet feeling began to make itself known in my groin area. I moaned like crazy as all of my thoughts and desires of escape flew out the window of my mind. All I wanted was for these incredible feelings to continue forever my true identity and life be damned.<br />
<br />
I almost fell over onto the ground as my legs finally became too weak but was instead lifted from my butt onto Mr. Travers lap before I hit the floor. With my legs spread wide over his legs and my knees resting comfortably on the black leather of the seat cushion I didn’t dare open my eyes through any of the actions of my wonderful and gentleman of a boss less I break my concentration in keeping these wonderful feelings going until he could get his hands back to me where they belong… “Wait what the heck am I thinking” my mind suddenly exclaimed in full measure of alarm and as my eyes shot open. The incredible feelings continued to course through my body and mind as I tried to make sense of what was happening to me even as the feelings degraded my thinking ability. “oh my god I got horny so easily and I thought that it wasn’t gonna be a problem! What was I thinking? Seems like I&#39;m almost becoming  Janet based on how Mr. Traver’s treats me and most especially how he makes me feel while I’m sexually excited. I have to change back!” Looking around I become silently horrified when I see that Mr. Travers has already removed my skirt while I too concentrated on getting off and my heels soon follow my skirt to the ground.<br />
<br />
Knowing that my only chance is to grab the pen and write something down before either Mr. Travers finishes removing my panties or decides to go back to kneading my breasts and tackles the panties later I know that time is a commodity I don’t have much of anymore. I battle my body’s needs with every ounce of concentration I have left and and reach for the pen on the desk...</p>
