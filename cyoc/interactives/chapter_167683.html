<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon raised his hand, “I&#39;d like to know about those “larger cities” you mentioned. As I said, I worked in IT and I would really like to help you guys in studying human technology.”<br />
<br />
Cura and the other friends agreed with a nod as Ana chimed in, “I would also like to see the other communities. I would preferably want to see one with a school in it.”<br />
<br />
“I see.” Cura nodded. “Usually, I recommend going to the hidden oceans that contain the larger merfolk cities but there is a bigger town not too far from here that might have what you want. Plus, the town is pretty close to the most used entrance to the hidden oceans.”<br />
<br />
“Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s go!” Lupe exclaimed, excited to get closer to observing the hidden cities and seeing what magical creatures lie beneath. <br />
<br />
And so, the full group of former humans followed Cura’s lead into the next destination. <br />
<br />
It was about a half-hour swim to the city but nobody one the short journey seemed to mind or feel tired at all. Colton seemed to have noticed it and asked a question, “I never thought of this before but I’m surprised I don’t feel any cramping, like how a half-hour walk would feel if I was human.”<br />
<br />
Adrian gave Colton a look but Cura was more than willing to answer. “That’s because humans carry their entire weight on two legs. We merpeople let the sea do the heavy lifting. I may be biased but I think flicking a fin feels better than walking.”<br />
<br />
“Can’t argue with that,” Chloe said. “Though, my tail felt heavy as hell when I tried dragging it on the beach. It was a dead weight on land.”<br />
<br />
“Our tails are indeed heavy but I believe the ability to breathe underwater and a natural affinity for swimming is worth the trade-off,” Cura said with a wink.<br />
<br />
“Interesting…” Colton whispered as he swam towards Damon and Monica. He looked at Isabella, sleeping comfortably on the sling’s soft fabric.<br />
<br />
“How’s she doing?” Colton said.<br />
<br />
“She’s doing wonderful,” Monica said. “I’m a bit surprised. From my nursing experience with babies, I expected her to be louder or cry more.”<br />
<br />
Stacy overheard her words and chimed in. “Maybe she’s already happy. She found her parents and has a new group of people looking for her. She’s content.”<br />
<br />
Damon smiled at that. He soon wrapped an arm around his mermaid wife and kissed her. He loved doing that, and so did Monica.<br />
<br />
Lupe was swimming, spinning around eagerly as she couldn’t contain her excitement. She then began swimming with her back facing the floor, as if she was lying on her bed. She sighed and closed her eyes, letting the wonder of the sea wash over her body. Lupe merely let her fins do the swimming as she relaxed, not taking account of her surroundings until her head bumped against someone’s back.<br />
<br />
Lupe’s eyes shot up and quickly looked up to see a pair of brown eyes locking with hers. <br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry! I… uh…” She paused to take in the merman’s features. He had neck-length brown hair, seemed to be around her age, and had a muscular build on his upper body and his green tail. What made Lupe pause were from a couple of things. First, he seemed to be of Mexican descent, just like her and Monica. The second reason was vaguer in her mind but… She could have sworn she had seen him on a field trip or during middle school when students were moving in-between class periods. <br />
<br />
Lupe blushed hard, if she still had legs she would kick herself for the situation she brought herself in, but the merman seemed to be a patient soul and smiled. “It’s fine.”<br />
<br />
The two looked at each other in silence. Lupe could see his eyes giving off a curious glint but nothing off-putting. She was about to open her mouth and break the ice when Harmony yanked Lupe out of there by the arm.<br />
<br />
“Hey! What was that for?” Lupe whined, surprised at how upset she was at the sudden separation.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, Lupe, but I had to get you out of there. You don’t just throw yourself onto every stranger who looks mildly attractive to you.” Harmony replied.<br />
<br />
“But I swear, I’ve seen him before. He didn’t look like a shady stranger at all!” Lupe said, seemingly sounding whinier.<br />
<br />
Harmony sighed. “Lupe. Let me give you some advice. I’ve met some good looking men in my time but, more often than not, their looks are just a front for their awful personalities. I should know because I was degraded by these men because of what I looked like. I just… Don’t want you to get hurt. Understand?”<br />
<br />
Lupe still had a frown but nodded. “I understand.”<br />
<br />
Harmony loosened her grip and turned to Lupe with a smile. “Trust me, there is plenty of fish in the sea, literally. Let’s just wait until we’re properly integrated before you catch yourself a merman. Okay?”<br />
<br />
Lupe wiped her eyes. “Okay.”<br />
<br />
Harmony warmly hugged Lupe. From the distance, Lupe could see the merman waving with an understanding smile on his face. She could have sworn he was mouthing something. It took her some time but she found out his name.<br />
<br />
“Alejandro”<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Cura and her group finally stopped when they reached a town that was bigger than the village they started at. “Here we are! Welcome to Abyssi Town!”<br />
<br />
Damon and his friends look around in awe. From first glance, it was clear it wasn’t a community made for farming.<br />
<br />
Throughout the place were houses and buildings made up of bioluminescent architecture that gave off a neon blue glow. The buildings seemed to be at a happy medium between traditional undersea architecture and more modernist sensibilities - Likely originating from the minds of merpeople that were formerly humans back when people like Van Der Rohe were the leading designers above land. <br />
<br />
Deep within the town was a school, a hospital, a technology center, and even a little cinema building advertising movies never before seen by humans. <br />
<br />
Cura noticed everyone’s faces and smiled. “You guys are free to explore. If you need any help or have any questions, let me know. I’ll accompany Damon and his family regarding technology work for now.”</p>
