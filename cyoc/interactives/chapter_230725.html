<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few minutes had passed. Maddy had continued being bewildered by Louis’ complete waste of a change.<br />
<br />
Louis looked more and more frustrated, constantly looking at himself, seeing just how large his body was. How much room he took up, and the fact he would really have to fight to even stand up at this rate. Plus, he felt pretty awkward with his whole big fat belly on display.<br />
After a final snarky comment, Louis angrily said, “what the hell would YOU have gone with then? Made your boobs bigger? Just so you can impress your stupid bitchy friends?”<br />
“SHUT UP!” Maddy yelled. She scoffed, standing up, adjusting her bikini again, “and yeah, I probably would have. You have NO idea what it’s like being a girl!”<br />
“Whatever.” Louis groaned, “I’m sure I don’t. But I for sure know it’s not all about how big your boobs are.”<br />
<br />
“You’re an asshole.” Maddy said, pissed. She leaned over and grabbed her two cards, standing herself up on the other side of the coffee table to get away from her big fat stupid brother,<br />
“I’m shocked you can see that.” Louis replied sarcastically.<br />
Neither of them made eye contact.<br />
“Let’s get this dumb game over with. I can’t wait until I’m able to just sit in my room, and ignore you until mom and dad get home.”<br />
“You think I’d rather be hanging out here? Than with my friends at college.”<br />
“I bet you just can’t wait until that girl you blew yourself up for sees you. I bet she’s gonna be all over you… I bet you’re not gonna get a moment alone because she’s gonna be SOOO enamoured by your big. Fat. Gross. HUGE body.” Maddy said with every ounce of frustration and anger.<br />
“FUCK YOU!” Louis shouted, he almost felt himself tearing up. But as he shouted he felt his whole body jiggling.<br />
<br />
Maddy looked pleased with his response. She turned over her ‘Action Card’, “Pick Up two… oh cool!” She remarked in a way that would annoy her brother. She leaned down to grab her second change card as she turned over the first to read it, “S-slutty… dress.” She hesitated.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately she felt her too-small bikini begin to change. The two disconnected top and bottom suddenly found themselves pulling closer to each other like magnets. The fabrics started to connect and morph, growing wider. The colour, being white blue and orange changed to be mostly white, but there was still a few blue and orange stripes around.<br />
As it covered more of her body, the change began to make sense. The skirt stopped just underneath her rear, and the chest shaped to form a window to show off her cleavage… if she had any.<br />
<br />
The dress had finished forming, and Maddy was just trying to take it in. Sure, this dress was less revealing than the bikini, but she still felt super awkward in front of her brother wearing it. It felt like something she’d wear to a night out… not a night in playing a stupid card game.<br />
“Ugh.” Maddy said, choosing not to discuss the change with her brother.<br />
Louis stayed silent, really not in the mood to talk with his sister. He’d do anything for her to stop being the centre of attention for once in her life. He rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
“Card two… says—” Maddy started, but she abruptly stopped.<br />
Louis was looking away, so he just assumed she was being dramatic with whatever was on her card. But as she wasn’t speaking, and almost ten seconds had passed. He lifted his head up slightly.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god!” He yelled, quickly wanting to jump to his feet, but his weight preventing him from doing so. He lifted himself up slowly, feeling all of his fat body move as he did.<br />
He waddled to his sister… his frozen sister.<br />
“I-is it… stone?” He asked, in awe.<br />
In front of her, coloured grey with the texture of marble, slightly shiny was the shape of his sister, still in the middle of reading her card out before she was frozen.<br />
Louis walked around to get a view of what her card said.<br />
“Made of Stone (Lasting One Round).” He read aloud. A smirk appeared on his face.<br />
<br />
“I bet you weren’t expecting that! BITCH!” He yelled excitedly, “hey… this might be the first time since you were born when I’ve actually been able to get a SINGLE word in! Look at me. I’m actually talking!”<br />
He tried to look to see if she’d react in any way. But she didn’t. Not even a twitch, or any notion that she was even alive. Whether she be encased in stone itself, or everything about her was actually stone. If she was solid, or if her organs had changed to stone too. It was quite fascinating.<br />
Louis wondered if she could hear him, or if she’d even remember any of this.<br />
<br />
“This is sooooo relaxing, that I might not even play my next card.” He joked. But as he said that, quickly two cards flew up and placed themselves in his hand. He gasped in surprise, then sighed, “I guess bliss doesn’t last forever.” He said again, turning over his Action Card, ‘IMMEDIATE MASTERCARD’.<br />
“What does that mean?” He asked himself. He looked at his change card, and suddenly it began to shift. It’s colour changed, it began to shimmer slightly with some kind of strange glitter. Then he heard the familiar sound of the box etching more words onto it’s face.<br />
He waddled over to get a better look.<br />
‘Mastercard is the greatest Card, The Strongest and Biggest Change!’<br />
“H-how did I get it?”<br />
‘Chance! Though, a Mastercard can be Obtained Through Collecting Three Cards in a Set’<br />
“Okayyy…” Louis said. He didn’t really get it, but he didn’t care. The card was shiny, so it had to be something good… right?<br />
<br />
He took a breath before turning the card over to look at what he got, “The Perfect Mother?” He said aloud.<br />
<br />
Louis felt the effects instantaneously. Firstly, his body began to reduce in size. His fat started to melt away, the weight making Louis feel more and more level again.<br />
He lost more and more weight until he was only a little bigger than when he’d first become chubby. But his body wasn’t the same… it was shapelier. His curves were more pronounced. And his body… it felt a little more worn out. A little older?<br />
He didn’t have much time to analyse it though, because immediately he felt his hips flare out! His bones stretched and popped as his legs felt wider and wider apart. His thighs swelled like they had been before, growing fatter and thicker, yet leaving a substantial thigh gap between them!<br />
Then his ass blew up like a balloon, swelling massively to match the sheer width of his hips. It was huge! He couldn’t help but look over his shoulders at it.<br />
But next, he was anticipating. He slowly moved his head over to look at his chest. He saw his nipples through his shirt poking through, hard as diamonds. He could only watch as breasts began to form, began to swell, and droop more and more as they became heavier and rounder. They weren’t saggy either, in fact they were quite firm and full, yet from the weight, they sat low on his torso. They stopped around F-to-G Cups. He wasn’t too familiar with bra sizes, but before could ponder any longer, he could feel his nipples changing. They grew longer and thicker, and he could even feel his areola grow larger in circumference and sensitivity.<br />
His face had slowly been feminising, as had his height. He’d shrunk maybe four inches during the transformation. His jawline was replaced by an angular shape and cheekbones had heightened. <br />
His lips swelled, plumping more and more as his nose shrank and his cheeks produced a natural motherly glow. <br />
His hair started to grow, and seemingly style itself to match a more motherly style, with its volume increasing as well as gaining stylish curled bangs.<br />
His face filled slowly with makeup, covered up his new wrinkles, making him look even more like a mother.<br />
He found his t-shirt shifting, staying somewhat the same, yet changing to fit his new body-shape. It tucked itself into his jeans, which were transforming into fashionable mom-jeans, and his converse simply grew to fit his new body. If anything, he looked significantly more stylist than before.<br />
<br />
He’d ignored it… but there was one thing he didn’t check if it had changed.<br />
He hesitated, his hands shaking as he lowered his hand below his breasts, and cupped his bulge…<br />
Nothing.<br />
“Oh dear…” he said, his voice higher and more dainty. Even what he said wasn’t what he expected.</p>
