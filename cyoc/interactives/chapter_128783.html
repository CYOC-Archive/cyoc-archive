<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your foot-falls are heavy and full of purpose as you stride toward your objective. The *chink-chink* sound of chainmail slapping against brightly-polished steel plate fills your ears with every step you take. You feel protected and dauntless, but the weight of your duty drags heavily on your heart. There is a beast up in these hills that has been terrorizing your village. Your friends, family and neighbours have been at risk every day since the creature had made its home here and now it&#39;s up to you to drive it away. Or slay it, as the case may be.<br />
<br />
You check your sword for the umpteenth time, its polished steel reflecting your visage back at you. You can clearly see your face through the open visor of your armet, you&#39;re a little surprised by yourself. Your eyes look tired, as if they haven&#39;t slept in days, your mouth is set in a grim frown and your brow is knitted as if you&#39;re gazing upon something truly distasteful. You guess you could have shaved, too, but what&#39;s the point of getting cleaned up for a fight with a dragon? It&#39;s not like it&#39;ll leave your village alone just because you look nice. Still, something just feels a bit off, like you&#39;re ashamed of something? You sheath your arming sword and adjust your heater-shield, ensuring it&#39;s secure, then you close your visor.<br />
<br />
You stand before the mouth of a large cave, your visor obscures much of your vision, but you can still see the marks on the walls which indicate that this is the home of the beast you&#39;ve been seeking. Moving forward, you notice a soft glow up ahead within the cave and as you approach, it becomes evident that someone or something had set up a trail of torches leading further into the cavernous structure. This can only be a trap, you think to yourself, but trap or no, you still need to find that dragon. It&#39;s not long before you have stepped into the, literal, dragon&#39;s den. You are astounded by what you see. <br />
<br />
The dome-shaped chamber is lit by several sconces and many candles, the lights of which are reflected back to the center of the room by carefully carved scenes of wilderness and civilization all inlaid with gold. You think the dragon must have melted the gold itself and literally painted the walls with it. Naturally, your eyes are drawn to the center of the grand residence, where you lay eyes upon your conquest. A dragon of purest-white scales, lays languidly across an immensely large bed of silk sheets and pillows, forming something you might describe as a nest. This comes as a surprise to you, as you had envisioned a pile of gold and human bones, though it looks like the gold is in the walls, but what about the bones...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to my chambers, oh valiant one...&quot; The dragon addresses you with a throaty, yet distinctly feminine, voice. &quot;I&#39;ve been expecting you, a strong specimen such as yourself would make a lovely addition to my collection of treasures.&quot; She lazily waves her arm at the room you both stand within. You don&#39;t know how to react to this development, but you&#39;ll be damned if you&#39;re going to become this dragon&#39;s plaything! You slowly draw your sword... but why are you so reluctant to wield it? &quot;Mm, a fight for dominance is it? I wouldn&#39;t have expected anything less... Not from you, least of all.&quot; She flashes a toothy grin, revealing wicked-sharp teeth, before pushing herself up onto her feet.<br />
<br />
She stands a good seven and a half feet tall, she&#39;s covered in thick, armor-like white scales which become larger toward her back. Many, much smaller, scales of polished bronze line her underbelly, stretching from just below her chin to, you suspect, the tip of her long tail. They look surprisingly soft compared to the rest of her. As your eyes trail lower, you notice her vent just before where her tail connects to her body. It looks puffy and moist, you swear you can almost feel the heat pouring off of it from where you&#39;re standing, through all your armour. You don&#39;t know why, but your mouth begins to salivate. You try to shake off the effect she is starting to have on you, with mixed success.<br />
<br />
The rest of her is much what you&#39;d expect from a powerful, fire-breathing reptile. She is quite athletic with tightly corded muscles, she has sweeping horns and a row of spikes leading down to her tail, which looks like she could use as an effective weapon and her feet end in digitigrade claws, her talon-like digits look capable of ripping through almost anything. You shift your stance as she looks down on you, letting you appraise her. With her wings outstretched on full display, she looks gorgeous... Wait, what are you thinking? You have to adjust yourself due to an uncomfortable stirring in your loins causing your equipment to feel too tight around your groin.<br />
<br />
She lunges without warning and you barely get your shield up in time to parry her attack. &quot;Hu-ack! Oomph!&quot; Her tail had come around and smashed into your side, lifting you off your feet and onto your back with the force of the blow. You groan in pain as you deflect a blow from her claws with your shield. You thrust with your sword, but from your position, you can only manage a glancing blow, the steel grazing across her scales. It&#39;s enough to get her to back up, an opportunity you use to roll onto your knees before she&#39;s back on the offense. <br />
<br />
She comes in with her tail again, but you see it and brace yourself. In your low position, you are much harder to knock off balance and manage to grapple her tail in both arms. Unfortunately, you&#39;ve lost your sword while attempting the grapple and the wind is knocked out of you, but you hold on. The dragon is struggling to find an angle to strike you from, her claws glance ineffectively off of your sturdy armour and her wings buffet you as she tries her best to fly out of your grasp. You hold on, adjusting to grip one of her legs as well, but she has managed to turn around to face you, a deep, incandescent light in her throat. Uh oh.<br />
<br />
She lets loose a bright, yellow-white flame from her maw. You have to close your eyes from the brightness that makes it through your visor. You can&#39;t see anything beyond that flame, but you&#39;re certainly starting to feel something. &quot;Argh, shit!&quot; You cry out, letting go of the dragon and backing off quickly. Your armour is heating up too fast, soon you&#39;ll be cooked alive! It seems as if the dragon has used up all her flame, but you need to remove your protective equipment before you are too badly injured! You rip off the charred leather straps holding your breast plate on and throw the heat-deformed chunk of metal to the ground. Soon, your armet&#39;s off and your gauntlets and greaves as well, until you&#39;re just standing in a smoldering gambeson which you part with as well.<br />
<br />
Panting and sweating, you look up at the dragoness who has been watching you undress. Her arousal is evident as her juices drip between her thighs, it looks like that fight got her blood pumping in more ways than one. She dips a clawed hand into her folds and lets out a rumbling purr from her throat, before turning away. Something in you snaps. How dare she turn her back on you! Before you know it, you&#39;re lunging right at her, unarmed and unprotected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yraargh!&quot; You let out an animalistic roar as you dive at the scaled temptress. She hears you and turns to you, visibly bracing herself as you connect. &quot;Hurrgh!&quot; Both of you are growling as you wrap your arms around her legs, forcing her to her back. She struggles a little bit, but it&#39;s only a game, she wants what you have and you plan on giving it to her. You pull her head closer, her muzzle opening slightly. You press your mouth to hers as best you can and dive your tongue into her maw. You wrestle with her oral appendage for a good little while as you reach down to her hot, dripping sex. Your fingers slide in easily as her juices lube them up, you hear a purr of contentment come from your pretty, scaly lover so you know you&#39;re on the right track. The dragon&#39;s hands have also been busy in the mean time, tearing away what little clothing you have left, exposing your soft, tender flesh.<br />
<br />
The two of you are now a ball of flesh and scales, curled around one another in a tight, desperate embrace. You both need this, as you growl and purr into each others mouths, you remove your hand from her nethers. You pull back and look at her as if to say, &quot;It&#39;s time&quot; she nods, gazing at you through her lust hazed vision, scales flush and hot from arousal. You move your hand to aim your ridged cock at her opening and slowly push your dick into the wanton lizardess. She roars with pleasure, a mini orgasm rippling through her body... She must have been really pent up. You push on.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, you&#39;re bottoming out in your scaly companion and beginning to start a steady rhythm of thrusting and pulling. Your dragoness also gets into the rhythm, pushing back on your thrusts to get as much of you in her as possible. She pulls you into another kiss which brings you both as close to each other as a physically possible. Her claws start to dig into your back, you know you&#39;re close, but she must be closer. You start to thrust harder and with more urgency, breaking your rhythm in favour of desperate humping to bring you both to climax.<br />
<br />
With an earth-shattering roar, the dragon below you begins to ride out her orgasm, riding tidal wave after tidal wave of pleasure. You&#39;re so close too, almost... Searing pain splits down the right-side of your back. &quot;Aaargh!&quot; You cry out, your orgasm so close, but the tremendous pain in your back drawing you away from the brink. You moan in pain and look at your shredded back where the dragon&#39;s claws had ripped into you as her orgasm made her forget how soft you are. You can feel blood as it trickles down your body in a river of red, your heart is beating hard and terrible in your chest and you hear someone calling for you...<br />
<br />
&quot;Darien...!&quot; It seems so far off, &quot;Darien, you have to wake up son...!&quot; Wha...? Wake... Up...?<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
&quot;Huagh... What, oh god what&#39;s happened...? Where am I?!&quot; You bolt upright, looking around at the unfamiliar room you&#39;ve been sleeping in, not sure where you are for a moment. Then your memories start to trickle back, the explosion, your injuries, your kidnapped brother and... Officer Anders is standing over you, concern etched on his wolf-like face. &quot;Hey, what&#39;s wrong...? Aghk! jeez!&quot; You wince as you try to move, you remember the dragon clawing your back in the dream, but you can still feel it! That&#39;s when you notice the blood that has pooled below you, not enough to be life-threatening, but any blood is a worrisome sight, especially in this quantity.<br />
<br />
Anders finally speaks up, &quot;I heard you cry out in your sleep, I just came in to check on you, when...&quot; He motions for you to look at your back. You crane your head to the side a little and you&#39;re met by a strange sight. You can&#39;t make out what your back looks like, but draped across the floor behind you is something odd. It looks like a sheet made out of bone and, what could be, white scales and membrane. It&#39;s a little hard to tell past the caked on blood. The part that shocks you the most is that it appears to be attached to you, you don&#39;t know how to take this development. &quot;Another part of you changing?&quot; Anders inquires, as if you&#39;d know how any of this works.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a... Ah!&quot; A strong sensation of &#39;pins-and-needles&#39; comes over you, mostly focused on your back which is a really strange feeling. Muscles you never knew you had, and probably didn&#39;t, twitch and come to life, your new appendage starts writhing a bit. The wolf-man moves around you to get a better look, not quite sure what to do. You inadvertently tweak a new muscle group that seems to wrap around your chest and your new addition springs to life. One fully developed, scaled wing stretches out from your right-side, you still don&#39;t know how to move it really, so you try to relax and have it settle on the ground again. &quot;It&#39;s really weird and numb,&quot; You say to Anders as you try to shake some of the &#39;pins-and-needles&#39; sensation away, not particularly effectively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, let me try something...&quot; Anders begins as he leans down to pick you up. He takes you to a nearby table and has you sit down, you must have torn away the last of your clothing last night during your change because you&#39;re buck naked. &quot;I&#39;m going to get some water and a cloth, we&#39;ll get this blood off of you and maybe we can deal with your numbness.&quot; he leaves to grab some water, you can hear him turn on a gas stove and put a pot on. You guess certain utilities are cut off now since the explosions. He adds some water from a jug he must have found here and it isn&#39;t long before it is nice and warm. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s get started.&quot; The wolf-y cop soaks a cloth and begins to dab away the crusted blood on your scales and wing. It&#39;s weird to admit something so foreign as being &#39;yours&#39;, not long ago, you would have said anything like this happening was a work of fiction, a pure fantasy, but now...?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm, thanks, that...That feels good.&quot; You admit to Anders, the feeling of having someone else scrub you down calls to something within you. Unbidden images of dragons grooming each other flows into your mind, making sure their mate&#39;s scales sparkle in the sunlight... What are you thinking?! You shake your head, positive this change is somehow starting to effect you mentally, that&#39;s a little disconcerting. You look back at officer Anders who almost appears to be flushing a little, it&#39;s hard to tell what with all the fur, but he is radiating an abundance of heat that you -can- feel.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re doing better. I was worried for you and when I saw the blood, I had to make sure I wasn&#39;t going to lose you,&quot; He tries to play it off cool, but he just seems a little more flustered, &quot;I have to check for any open wounds that might be present, we can&#39;t afford you getting an infection...&quot; He dabs a sensitive spot under your wing where the membrane connects to your hide. You let a little growl escape your lips, it looks like you have new ticklish spots on your body. Too soon, your impromptu sponge bath is over, but the protective wolf has more planned.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does your wing feel?&quot; He inquires, you tell him that you don&#39;t feel much, kind of like when an arm goes to sleep, it feels heavy and next to useless. &quot;Hm, must be some byproduct of the change, I&#39;m going to attempt to massage some blood-flow back into your appendage and hopefully stimulate your nerves a little.&quot; You nod, not sure what to expect. You feel his warm paws rest on your shoulders, he starts to work them in tandem before moving lower. Soon his grip is on the joint where your wing connects to your body and it&#39;s like all the nerves light up at once, making you shiver and let out an unintended moan. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, fuck...&quot; You let out, you can feel your erstwhile masseuse move a little quicker, not sure if he wants to make you feel even more or if he just wants to finish before his embarrassment makes him run away. The stimulation to your wing feels too good, you can&#39;t control yourself and you end up making little, pleased rumbling sounds in your chest as well as letting out the occasional moan. &quot;Mm, keep going like... That! Ah, yes...&quot; You can feel hot air against the back of your neck as your wolf-man begins to pant hard and lean in toward you unconsciously. You can hear him sniff something and you wonder what it is when Anders rubs a particularly sensitive spot on your wings which makes you grunt a little. You feel something wet smack your belly.<br />
<br />
You look down with surprise at your ridged shaft poking at the air. It seems you may have enjoyed Anders attentions a little too much. Your cock looks a bit different from what you remember though, It&#39;s taken on a slightly more tapered appearance and it is much larger than it used to be, going from your modest six-and-a-half inches to a fuck stick of almost eleven. It&#39;s throbbing in time with your heartbeat. Your wolf-man has finished with his massage, but his head has ended up draped over your shoulder, his tongue sticking out as he pants and takes in your scent. His eyes are half-closed and you wonder if he&#39;s all there anymore, that&#39;s when he reaches around and grabs your cock...</p>
