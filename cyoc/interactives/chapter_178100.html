<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Like any other kid his age, Luke thought that ignoring his predicament was the best way to solve it. So, he decided to come back with his friends and to pretend that nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Jake and Brooke were talking to each other while Kyle was waiting for him. Luke gave him a confident grin and then they started to play video games for a few hours. Since it was a weekend, Luke, Jake and Kyle had planned a sleepover. So, before it was too late, Brooke left and they went to Luke&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
Luke was acting weird all day, but fortunately for him no one noticed it. And as day goes by he ended up fully ignoring his situation. However, he didn&#39;t know that he was still changing and now it wasn&#39;t just his cock which has darkened but his whole legs, butt and torso. If he wasn&#39;t wearing pants and a shirt he would have noticed that he was a black boy under them.<br />
<br />
The night was coming and Jake and Kyle started to dress up in their pajamas. Luke was going to do it as well, when he noticed that his hands now looked like dark chocolate. Panicked but cautiously he took his socks off and he noticed that his feet looked darker too.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing, Luke?” Jake asked him. “Are you afraid of something? Showing us your fat belly or so? Hahaha!”<br />
<br />
Of course, Jake was joking. He knew that Luke was thinner than him and Kyle. However, he badly wanted to know what Luke was hiding, so he made a gesture to Kyle and booth of them agreed to undress Luke. Jake suddenly grabbed Luke&#39;s arms while Kyle pulled his pants down. He was expecting to see a little pink boner but what he found out was totally unexpected.<br />
<br />
Luke&#39;s legs were completely dark and he was sporting a bulge ten times bigger than his... And he wasn&#39;t even erect!! Jake was agape but he managed to take Luke&#39;s shirt off. He found out that Luke has dark skin there too. In fact, he was almost black except for his neck and face.<br />
<br />
“Dude, what happened to you? Is it a big sunburn or what?” Jake asked as he examined Luke&#39;s skin. As they looked at their friend&#39;s body, Luke&#39;s face started to darken but that wasn&#39;t all. His face features were also changing it wasn&#39;t something drastic but at the end Luke looked more afroamerican than caucasian. His lips had puffed up, his cheekbones were more pronounced and his head seemed rounder.<br />
<br />
“Lu-Luke... you have changed! You look completely different!!” Kyle shouted as he stared at the black boy in front of him. “Are you ok?”<br />
<br />
Luke watched his hands in disbelief and then he used them to explore his face. He can feel he was different but he needed to see it. So, he ran to his bathroom where there was a big mirror. When he looked at his reflection, he can&#39;t believe that what he saw. He wanted to scream but he didn&#39;t because he knew he could get more troubles.<br />
<br />
After the initial shock, Jake and Kyle thought that Luke&#39;s predicament waa funny and they started to giggle about it. When Luke came back they started to make lame stereotype jokes about black guys who Luke didn&#39;t like. He was terrified and he wasn&#39;t getting support from his friends. Maybe they need to feel it by themselves, he thought as he got an idea.<br />
<br />
“Fortunately, we have already had dinner and your parents won&#39;t see you tonight.” Kyle said. “Let&#39;s go to the bed. You can deal with your black skin tomorrow, stud.”<br />
<br />
After talking about Luke&#39;s situation for a little more. Kyle and Jake finally went to sleep. Luke was pretending he was sleeping too, until he was sure his friends were knocked out. Then he sneaked out and took the fruit he had eaten before. He knew he can&#39;t make them eat it while they&#39;re sleeping so he made a juice with it and then he came back to his room.<br />
<br />
“Do you think is funny to be a black guy?” He said as he carefully poured juice through their open mouths. As he had used water to make the juice he didn&#39;t know how much juice he should give them. So, he used it all, half for Kyle and half for Jake. When he was done, he quickly returned to his bed with a big grin in his black face.</p>
