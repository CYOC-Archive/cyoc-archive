<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A wisp of blue and white light appeared before Jesse and Melinda. That wisp of light formed into the shape of a woman before becoming a woman clad in white robes. She had long flowing brown hair and a sweet smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Melinda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Sharon. I have been able to restore you for the most part,&quot; Sharon said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You made us human again, thank you. But, what do we do now?&quot; Melinda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid this is only temporary. The magic that turned you two into donkeys is powerful,&quot; Sharon said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean, we're going to change back?&quot; Melinda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In time you will. However, there is hope. There is a way to restore your humanity permanently. However, it is involved. You will need to do it within the next 72 hours or you will change back into donkeys. If that happenes, I may not be able to restore you again,&quot; Sharon said.<br />
<br />
Jesse took a few steps forward. &quot;What about my friend Josh? We have to find him and help him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sharon nodded. &quot;I understand your desire to assist your friend. I can teleport you two to his current location. Unfortunately, I won't be able to restore him as I have done you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Jesse asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He has embraced his new form too well. If you can complete the task I mentioned, you can break the spell. However, Josh will need to want to be human again. Given his current situation, that may be ... difficult,&quot; Sharon said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't understand. Are they hurting him?&quot; Melinda asked.<br />
<br />
The woman shook her head. She raised her right hand and Melinda saw a field of white surround them. Melinda felt light-headed for a few seconds. When the sensation cleared, Melinda was in another field with Jesse and Sharon. Before her was a male donkey. Around the field were horses and what Melinda assumed were mules.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh?&quot; Jesse said.<br />
<br />
The donkey looked at Jesse but seemed more interested in a horse that was in the field.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're using him to create these mules. It is a lifestyle that while perhaps physically pleasurable to Josh, clouds the mind and soul,&quot; Sharon said.<br />
<br />
Melinda watched, as Josh became aroused. It was a sight she'd seen before when she and Jesse as donkeys had given into their urges.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Josh, don't!&quot; Jesse said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can restore his ability to speak and help clear the magic that clouds his mind. However, you will need to reason with him. Even if he remembers being human, he may not want to go back,&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
Melinda watched as the woman waved her hand and Josh the donkey stopped moving. He looked at Jesse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh, it's me Jesse,&quot; Jesse said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh, remember me? I'm Melinda, the girl you guys saw on the island. I was pretending to be a boy,&quot; Melinda said.<br />
<br />
Josh walked towards the duo. &quot;Jesse?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse nodded and petted the side of Josh's face. &quot;Yes! Are you okay? How much do you remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember. Human ... changing ... island,&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Melinda said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a donkey. It feels ... good. All I knew but was nice. Felt so good,&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
The mare Josh was heading towards was still there. Josh looked at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want her. She wants me. I can't ... hold back,&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh, listen to me. You can hold back. We can all be human again to stay. We need to do something,&quot; Jesse said.<br />
<br />
Melinda looked at Sharon. &quot;What is it we need to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I ... don't want to hold back. Let me have her. Let me bray. She smells so nice. I can't say no!&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can resist. There is a choice. There is a quest that the three of you can undergo. There is an item you can find that can restore not just yourselves permanently but others as well. I would acquire it myself but it requires mortal hands to access,&quot; Sharon said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does being a donkey feel so good? I want her. Please let me have her!&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Young man, it is important for you to fight this. You and your friends only have three days to reverse this spell. If you wish to remain a donkey that these people use for breeding, I will not deny your wish. However, if you wish more in life then I can help you to have a chance at that. I sense that you were a young man looking forward to more and wouldn’t want to let the urges of the beast defeat you, no matter how pleasurable it may feel. Physical pleasure is often short lived. Other types of pleasure can last a lifetime,&quot; Sharon said.<br />
<br />
Josh grunted. He closed his eyes, but what was going on between his legs betrayed his thoughts. &quot;I want to resist but it's so strong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melinda turned toward Sharon. &quot;This is going to sound gross, but what if I ... you know? It might help give him a release.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman shook her head. &quot;It will still be that sort of pleasure. Josh, I know you can resist. Such pleasures are of course a part of physical life. However, when they became the only part of one's existence, they cloud the soul. I ask for your sake that you resist. If you three can complete this quest and I believe you can, five years from now when you're human and doing things no donkey can do, you will thank me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, I'll try,&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, we still don't have clothes!&quot; Melinda said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can give you clothes and the necessary equipment to travel. Josh, you have the ability to transport your friends. Are you all right with this?&quot; the woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I'm strong and it will make me more useful so ... okay,&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, now Jesse, Melinda picture what you'd like to be wearing. I know you'd like to stop for a shower and hot meal but time is of the essence,&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
Melinda did as the woman asked before she felt light-headed as white light again enveloped her. When it cleared, she was wearing a pink tanktop, pink shorts and black boots. Jesse was wearing a light blue tee shirt, jeans and black boots. The trio were standing in a clearing in a forested area. Josh had supplies draped over his back and appeared ready for a journey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pink?&quot; Jesse asked.<br />
<br />
Melinda shrugged. &quot;It came to mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what is the quest we need to follow?&quot; Jesse asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a network of caves south of here. Inside is a crystal that will break Pleasure Island's spell,&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds simple enough,&quot; Jesse said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I warn you that the journey will take time. This is part of the reason I brought Josh. You two should be able to ride him. I would teleport you closer however the magic surrounding the cave forbids it,&quot; the woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, we just have to get this crystal, bring it out and then we can use it to make Josh human again and keep our human forms?&quot; Melinda asked.<br />
<br />
“In a sense. I will be able to release the energy of the crystal over the island. It will cancel out the magic surrounding it and reverse the magic that changed you and all of the others into donkeys,” the woman said.<br />
<br />
“So, we can save everyone?” Jesse asked.<br />
<br />
“That’s a lot of responsibility,” Melinda said.<br />
<br />
“Being a donkey was a lot easier then this!” Josh said.<br />
<br />
“I know and, perhaps it would be easier if I returned you to a normal donkey and allowed you to live out your life like that,” the woman said.<br />
<br />
“No, that’s not what I want,” Josh said.<br />
<br />
“Very well then. I wish you luck,” the woman said before vanishing.</p>
