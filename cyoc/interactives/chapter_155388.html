<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Madison was a content youth. She had her friends, her family, and spent her time doing the things she enjoyed. As a full-time student, she worked hard and kept busy, but always found time for a dinner at home and late nights out with the girls.<br />
<br />
One evening, Madison was headed out with a few of her girlfriends to a local punk bar that had just opened up. It was supposed to be a place where people of all different musical tastes could go and it paid homage to local bands from the area. She thought it sounded like fun, so she took her two friends, Stephanie and Allie, in her ZX5 downtown to check it out.<br />
<br />
The venue was a hoppin’ place. There were kids from school, friends who had graduated from her high school, and people who were willing to have a good time. Madison was excited and she went to the bar and ordered drinks for her friends: two mojitos and a Corona. She had the Corona.<br />
<br />
Madison was a content and fun-loving girl. Anyone could tell that from looking at her. But she wasn’t particularly attractive. Nor was she unattractive. She had a touch of a lanky look to her. Her hair was brown and straight and her face was average, despite the smiles. She wore t-shirts and jeans most of the time because she didn’t have any figure to show off. She was skinny, but so were her legs and butt. Her breasts were of the same theme filling only a B cup. Occasionally she’d get a few looks, but not usually because people were interested. She was regarded as a tomboy most of the time she went out.<br />
<br />
A few hours went by as the video jukebox played some hits from the past couple of years and Stephanie and Allie had a good time sitting next to the jukebox request machine trying to get guys to buy them a listen to some of their favorite songs. They were occasionally successful.<br />
<br />
Madison stepped aside while her friends were being teases to get some fresh air from the smoky indoor room. She walked out the back of the building past the restrooms where there was a porch-like stoop. She sat there for a moment while playing with her phone. The door opened again and a young man stepped out.<br />
<br />
“Nice evenin’,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Sure is” Madison responded.<br />
<br />
“It’s nice to get away from the music smoke for a few minutes” he replied, trying to start a conversation.<br />
<br />
“Yeap” she replied while playing with her phone in a poorly concealed attempt to end the conversation.<br />
<br />
The young man turned around as if to go back inside. But suddenly he grabbed Madison and put is hand over her mouth as he shoved her up against the wall. She panicked and thought the worst. Her brow scrunched in and she tried to scream but his big hand kept her quiet.<br />
<br />
“You’re going to do me a favor, sweetie,” he said from behind. Just then, he pulled out what looked like a syringe.<br />
<br />
“Mmmmmm…” Madison tried to yell through the big hands of the man. She started to cry a bit and saw that the syringe was filled with a bright orange substance. The man pulled down her low riding, faded jeans from behind as she struggled to get free.<br />
<br />
She felt the prick of the needle on her thin, right butt cheek followed by the cool sensation of the injection. But there was a warm sensation, too. It was like Icy-Hot was inside her and the feeling dissipated from inside her butt.<br />
<br />
“Nnnmmm,” she yelled in an attempt to say “no” as she realized that whatever went into her system was going to be really hard to get out. She thought it was going to be some type of drug or date rape substance.<br />
<br />
“I found this serum and you’re the lucky person who gets to try it out,” he said into her ear quietly as he continued to strictly hold her up against the brick wall. “It comes from a place where the laws of reality need not be followed. From now on, whatever someone wishes you to do or to become, you will do or become exactly that. This also applies to your clothes. Be careful what others wish upon you. Good night, sweetie.”<br />
<br />
He relinquished his hold on Madison and finally took all the weight of his body off of her and scurried back into the bar before she could even see him or ask him any questions. She was confused and still crying.<br />
<br />
She ran back into the restroom and cleaned up like nothing happened. Nobody liked a girl who look liked she had cried. And since she was sort of a tomboy, people would know something was wrong. She’d see the doctor in the morning. She was going to see her friends but first stood in the mirror and looked at herself. Nothing new, nothing changed.<br />
<br />
“I wish I was an inch taller,” she said.<br />
<br />
Nothing happened.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm…apparently doesn’t work on me,” she thought in comfort.<br />
<br />
“Where’ve you been?” Stephanie asked as Madison came up to her friends at the video jukebox. As she walked up, the guy Allie was talking to walked away.<br />
<br />
“I ran outside for some fresh air,” Madison responded.<br />
“Why doesn’t that guy like us?” Allie asked. “Ugh, Madison, why’d you scare him away. He was cute! Sometimes I wish you took initiative with guys like we do.”<br />
<br />
Deep inside Madison, she felt something different. Something was changing. She starting walking past her friends and went up to the bar and started talking with the most attractive guy she could find.<br />
“Hey, I’m Sean.”<br />
“I’m Madison”<br />
“Oh yeah, like the city…or the president. That’s a really unique name”<br />
“Yeah sorta…”<br />
Their conversation went on when finally it came to closing time. Sean offered to drive Madison home and she accepted. She had been drinking for a while and was pretty buzzed, but Sean had stopped so he could drive home. She gave her keys to Stephanie and Allie and they wished her luck as they sped off.<br />
<br />
In the car ride home, Sean and Madison continued to talk, despite Madison’s inebriation. Topics ranged from musical taste to food and family.<br />
“So, do you have any hidden talents?”<br />
“Wellll…” Madison said drunkenly, “I’ve been told I can change into anything people wishhhh, but thhhhhat’s just what they say.”<br />
“Haha…oh yeah? Well, hmmm…How about: I wish you had ash blonde hair.”<br />
Suddenly, Madison’s roots starting changing and her hair slowly changed from dark brown to a light-ish ash blonde.<br />
“Whoa…what the hell?” Sean yelled. “Haha…” Madison laughed. “See? I tolldddd you. Now ccchange me back, silly.”<br />
“I wish you were more drunk than you are now,” Sean replied.<br />
“Whaaaa…waaait, waaaiiiiiitttt….” Madison yelled as she felt the car start spinning as more alcohol started to suddenly be absorbed by her liver.<br />
“I wish you had a deeper, more sultry voice.”<br />
“Ugggghhhh….” Cried Madison, as she felt her vocal cords change and elongate. Her voice changed as she moaned and soon had a deep, husky, sexy voice pouring out of her mouth.<br />
She couldn’t talk because she couldn’t handle all the alcohol that somehow got inside her. She was aware but totally incapacitated.<br />
“Wait till I get you home” Sean said with smugness.<br />
<br />
Sean carried Madison up the stairs to his apartment. It was a nice place and well kept. He opened the door and set his new prize down on his bed.<br />
<br />
“I wish you would sober up,” he demanded.<br />
<br />
Madison awoke from her sleep-like, alcohol-induced state.<br />
<br />
“Whoa…wait, where am I?”<br />
<br />
“You’re in my place. And that means, my rules.”<br />
<br />
“No, please don’t do this. You’re going to regret this!”<br />
“I wish…”<br />
“Noo!”<br />
“…you were a lot more tan and not so pale white”<br />
<br />
“Mmmmmmm…” she moaned in her rich, over-sexualized voice.<br />
A warm sensation came over Madison as her pale-ish, punk rocker skin started to turn darker. And darker. Her skinny legs up to her face took on a cocoa-sheen tan. And the sensations that accompanied it felt great.<br />
“I look like a slut,” Madison said deeply after surveying the “damage.”<br />
<br />
“Oh no, not yet. I wish you can’t leave the bed.”<br />
<br />
Madison was going nowhere.<br />
<br />
“I wish you were three inches shorter.”<br />
“Ugghhh, ugghhhhhhhmmmmmm…”<br />
Madison’s 5’6” stature decreased down to 5’3”.<br />
<br />
“This is retarded,” she said in her deep, sexy, husky voice. “You’re not supposed to take advantage of this. Just be impressed that it happens and move on! I thought you’d be someone more than this.”<br />
<br />
“I wish you had bigger eyes. Bigger green eyes!”<br />
<br />
“Ack!” she yelled. A tingling sensation took over her eyes. Her sight didn’t change but she knew her eyes were wider and bigger. And forest green.<br />
<br />
“I wish you had a prettier face.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck you!” she said. And then she felt the slightly euphoric sensation change her face. Her cheekbones rose and her neck and jaw became defined. Her eyes grew huge eyelashes that got longer as they went along her eyelid.<br />
<br />
“Stop this!”<br />
“I wish you had large, sultry, sensuous lips.”<br />
<br />
The sensation began and her lips puffed out and grew large, big, bee-stung, and sultry. They actually felt great, but Madison wasn’t about to admit that aloud. Her new, smooth lips were red, soft and had a constant pout. She feared what he might have her do with them.<br />
<br />
“Now Madison. I’m going to have fun with your body. I love all women but I haven’t found one who fits my physical preference. So we’re going to mold you into that preference.”<br />
<br />
“What is that going to make me look like…”<br />
<br />
“I wish…you had a large, smooth, bubblegum ass and sexy, shapely thighs.”<br />
<br />
Madison grabbed the comforter of the bed and the mildly euphoric pleasure suddenly became too euphoric to handle. Her head flew back and she arched her back. Her ass began to grow and her jeans instantly filled out and became skintight.<br />
<br />
“Ohhhhhhh….ohhhhh my Gooood…..MMmmmmmm…” Madison yelled. Her ass grew further and shapelier. Each pocket on her jeans was skin tight and begged to be grabbed. Her thighs expanded and filled up her pant legs testing the stitching. She rapidly had put into form the most perfect sexy ass and legs.<br />
<br />
Sean grabbed her thigh and ass. Her shapely definition felt amazing in his hand. Then he had an idea.<br />
<br />
“I wish you were more sexually sensitive.”<br />
<br />
“God damnit! Uggghhhh……..ugh!” Madison moaned in her deep voice as she was instantly turned on. Sean’s grabbing suddenly felt amazing.<br />
<br />
“I wish you had wider hips to accompany your spectacular round ass…and a thin waist.”<br />
<br />
Madison’s hips were overcome with sensation and suddenly flaired out. Her pants stretched as her hip bones pushed forward. The stitching could be heard ripping since the only slack in her pants was overtaken with her deliciously round ass. Her waist remained thin and tightened in a little bit.<br />
<br />
“Please don’t do this next change…” Madison pleaded.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I saved the best for last Madison. You’re going to be one curvaceous vixen. I wish you had enormous breasts!”<br />
<br />
“Nooooooouuuuuuuugghhhh, oh God! Oh God!” Madison yelled as her instinct instantly arched her back on the bed. Her white shirt started pushing forward and she could instantly feel the pressure of her shirt. She had C cups and there was no stopping. Her tan nipples poked through the white shirt and her collar was pulled down from her neck revealing tan, deep cleavage.<br />
<br />
“Whyyyyyyyy….ugghhhhhhh…ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Fuck! Ohhhhhh…”<br />
<br />
From her shoulder to the end of her breast, her shirt was taught and there was a ripping sound as her breasts filled up to a double D cup. Madison felt the unanticipated weight of her new breasts as they ripped her shirt halfway down the middle. Her breasts filled out to double E cups. From the underneath of her arms to the front of her ripped shirt, her breasts filled with firm, ample, tan breast flesh.<br />
“Wow! I love this!! Can I change your clothes? I wish you had on a leopard print bikini!”<br />
<br />
And Madison stood there in a leopard print bikini. Her ash blond hair was down to her lower back. Her lower big, sensual lip quivered as she stood there with big green eyes. Her body was an hourglass with humongous breasts, thin waist, a shapely, large ass, and a sultry, husky voice to moan with.</p>
