<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wish,&quot; Tanya read silently to herself and going over what she had just typed. &quot;That my husband Paul would turn into a girl...to teach him a decent lesson that what he did was wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;And not just any girl. I want him to be an immortal fifteen year old with the perfect body...suitable to attract all the boys...that is not to thin and not to fat. A body with breasts that are not too big and not to small and easy to grip ahold of. A body that has long flowing hair that is lovely for a boy to run his hands through and face that is remarkably pleasant to look at.<br />
<br />
&quot;But to make this wish a punishment, I want Paul aware forever that he was at one time a male, but unable and unwilling to do anything about his situation. And to top it off, I want him to be totally clueless about the female body, having to figure out everything on his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;And to watch all this, I shall also become a fifteen immortal girl, Paul's friend. And I shall be aware of what Paul is going through, but he shall be unaware that I am aware.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sitting back, looking at the note, Tanya thought about what she had written, thought about Paul's phone call and how he can admitted to being a womaniser...and only because Tanya had caught and confronted him about it...and then she leaned forward, added a bit more to the wish, tightened up certain areas and then hit the send button.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Sitting in his office, Paul's thoughts weren't on the fact that he had been caught and been forced to admit that he had been having relations with other woman. In that area, he simply thought Tanya was much too nosy and had just minded her own business.<br />
<br />
No, his mind was on the new secretary and how he was going to woo her. Shifting the forms he was working on about on his desk, he ran a hand on his abdomen as a loud gurgling noise erupted forth.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;Hope that sandwich doesn't come back up on me,&quot; he flicked on his computer to input the data.<br />
<br />
Only to shift in his seat as a new gurgling sensation erupted forth. As he ran his hand across his abdomen a second time, he suddenly leapt to his feet and made a bee-line for the bathrooms, thinking that maybe the sandwich he had eaten was upsetting him and that it wasn't coming back up, but probably going to make an exit in the other direction.<br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom he took a stall and undoing his belt, he dropped his slacks and boxers and sat on the toilet. Immediately a sharp pain ripped through his abdomen and groin and Paul nearly cried out in pain.<br />
<br />
As the feeling intensified, Paul felt a pressure building, which soon turned into a bloated and cramped feeling. Leaning forward, he thought, &quot;What exactly did I eat that is making me feel so sick,&quot; as the feeling continued to increase and slowly seep down into his penis and testicles.<br />
<br />
Looking at his genitalia, he hoped that this wasn't some sort of STD-like disease, but the thought was immediately driven from his mind, as he watched the public hair turn a lighter shade and then totally vanish.<br />
<br />
Unsure of what he had just seen, Paul shifted about on the toilet and attempted to get a closer look. As he did this, he watched as his penis and testicles turned a bright shade of pinkish-red and then slowly move down. And then further they moved down, the closer they pressed into the skin until Paul watched as they first merged and then melded to the skin.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;What the hell,&quot; Paul watched as his penis and testicles pressed upward into his body. As they slowly disappeared, Paul leaned forward more and more until he watched as the skin bubbled out and pea-sized, button-like nub appeared.<br />
<br />
Scared, he sat up, the bloated and cramped feeling furthest from his mind. Sitting on the toilet, scared because of what was happening, he gingerly placed a hand between his legs and the quickly withdrew it as if burned. Hesitant, he reached down again and then gently began to explore.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the toilet, he gently rubbed what he now knew to be to clitoris, but stopped as he felt it get hard and recede into the hood. Aroused, and not liking the feeling, he pressed onward, first touching the urethra opening and then pressing pass the lips majour and minour to inspect what he knew was now present, but couldn't quite wrap his mind around...the vaginal opening.<br />
<br />
Suddenly pulling his hand away, realising that he was seriously turned on and close to masturbating, he instead thought, &quot;Jesus wept! Somehow I have become a woman!&quot;<br />
<br />
Below, a tiny drop of blood dripped into the toilet, but Paul was to terrified to pay attention that as the feeling of being bloated and cramped increased, taking up most of his attention. And as he focused on that, he suddenly realised that his nipples were really sore for some reason.</p>
