<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You haven&#39;t heard about it?! Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I haven&#39;t! How many times do I have to tell you, Sylev?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amier Eihron huffed in clear annoyance, wanting to shout more than he admitted at the obnoxious prying of his &quot;friend,&quot; the only boy his age in Norloc Village; Sylev Logsh. Sylev was the absolute definitive definition of a troublemaker, the most textbook definition one could get. Unlike him, his troublesome peer insisted on coming to watch him shepherd day in and day out all because he had nothing better to do. His family was quite large, which meant they had more hands to tend the land, leaving their youngest son without a job. He practically lived rent free!<br />
<br />
Safe to say, it never ceased to annoy Amier whenever he spotted Sylev&#39;s grinning face nearing the fields outside his home. Of course, he couldn&#39;t do a thing about it lest he anger his grandpapa; and that was a sight nobody would want to see.<br />
<br />
Well, aside from Sylev himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come <em>on</em>, Amier! I&#39;m sure even the braindead sheep you&#39;ve tended to know about it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you <em>stop</em> yelling?! You&#39;re going to make them scatter!&quot; The shepherd boy hissed, his ocean blue eyes narrow as daggers.<br />
<br />
...Not that his gaze managed to wipe Sylev&#39;s smug grin, with how… admittedly girlish his features were, despite being only fourteen. His body has taunted him, refusing to undergo the transition from boyhood into manhood. And even more annoying, he was three inches shy of being a five footer, standing at a measly 4&#39;7. If he didn&#39;t grow soon enough, he wouldn&#39;t be able to help grandpapa with more important tasks. According to the old man, he had taken a good majority of his attributes from his mother. <br />
<br />
Which was… well...<br />
<br />
Said attributes included carnation pink hair. Of <em>all</em> the traits inherited, he had gotten his mother&#39;s <em>pink</em> hair. He didn&#39;t even know if it was natural! It often got him teased by Sylev due to how he styled it, which was simply curtaining the bangs so they didn&#39;t cover his eyes. Of course, coupled with his voice and lithe body, it wasn&#39;t rare for the mailman and any visitors to mistake him for a young girl. <br />
<br />
And he <em>hated</em> it. He liked pink as a color, heck; the tunic he was wearing was pink! But at least it was something he could change whenever he wanted to!<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay! I&#39;ll be quiet <em>juuust</em> cause you asked, your highness!&quot; Sylev replied smugly, raising his hands up and stepping back as if to taunt the victim of his antics. &quot;But, since his highness is so clueless on what&#39;s happening; leave it to your loyal knight Sylev Logsh to give you a summary!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just… get to the point.&quot; Amier groaned, thankful for the gentle breeze and idle baas of the sheep that populated the field in his time of torture. <br />
<br />
Of course, just as Sylev was to begin his grand tale, Amier&#39;s gaze was attracted to the distinct form of a man trotting across the path to the farmhouse, no doubt from the central point of Norloc Village. Judging by his outfit, it was clear he was anyone but a mailman. Messengers were quite rare during times such as these, especially ones that needed to deliver messages to his grandpapa of all people.<br />
<br />
Unless… it could mean…<br />
<br />
&quot;Sylev?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, your holiness?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll… catch up later. I have to go... fetch my grandpapa! Uh… <em>bye</em>!&quot;<br />
<br />
Amier didn&#39;t even give the boy a chance to respond, immediately taking off towards the backdoor of the farmhouse connected to a much smaller building serving as him and his grandpapa&#39;s humble abode. His carnation pink hair blew with the freeze breeze, and coupled with his pink tunic, made him appear as nothing more than a pink blur.<br />
<br />
Bursting into the room that served as the household&#39;s makeshift kitchen, the boy&#39;s excited eyes shot to the wooden table at the far back of the room and the old man seated; who&#39;s head shot towards him in return.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandpapa! There&#39;s a messenger outside! I saw him walking &#39;round the path up the hillside! He&#39;s coming here!&quot; Amier shouted, an excited smile that flickered ever so slightly as he met the stone-cold gaze of his elder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didja have to <em>yell</em> about &#39;em, boy?! I already knew one was comin&#39;! Tryna make me go deaf?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The pink-haired boy couldn&#39;t help but flinch at his grandpapa&#39;s gruff voice. Despite being well into his sixties, he was about as muscled as a bull; the silver hair at his head, scraggly beard, and wrinkles having yet to fully sully the remnants of his days of youth.<br />
<br />
Which included his voice. He had once been an instructor for a group of knights in his youth, which he believed included quite a bit of shouting. Often, he was told loud shouting was common in the family. Then again, he <em>did</em> do a lot of shouting when he was shepherding...<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What?! You <em>knew</em>?! Why didn&#39;t you say anything?!&quot; Amier screeched, unable to fully contain his joy; so much so, one could probably mistake his ocean blue eyes for a pair of sapphires.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause if I&#39;d have toldja, I knew you woulda been pesterin&#39; me all <em>damn</em> night about it! Now shaddup, will ya?! Can&#39;t have us scarin&#39; that poor messenger off...&quot; The old man grumbled as he stood up from his chair, the wooden floorboards creaking beneath his weight as he sauntered over to the shoddy yet bearable door that served as the entrance to their home.<br />
<br />
With the twist of a knob, Amier and his grandpapa were outside in a flash. Much to the former&#39;s joy, he spotted the small shape that was Sylev heading in the opposite direction of their house; no doubt back to his own home to lounge around in boredom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pardon my intrusion, sir...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amier&#39;s gaze returned to the person of his interest; the messenger. He appeared quite foreign, judging by the armor serving as his garb. He appeared young as well, most likely in his mid-twenties. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is this… the Eihron household?&quot; The man spoke uncertainty, no doubt wishing to avoid any unnecessary chatter. Despite his gruff face, Amier couldn&#39;t help but notice how sweaty his face was. Perhaps the trek up the hillside had exhausted him…?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, this &#39;ere is the Eihron household.&quot; Grandpapa answered, a welcoming smile crossing his face. &quot;I was told that you&#39;d be comin&#39;. Step inside if ya want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, I couldn&#39;t possibly do so, Sir Eihron. The message need not be stalled for you to accommodate my presence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amier&#39;s gaze shifted to the man&#39;s hand as he reached into a satchel at his waist, a smile crossing his face upon the sight of a sheet of paper rolled tight with a ribbon. Handing it to his grandpapa, the messenger bode them a farewell and blessing before heading back down the path, and with quite a bit of speed at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s it say?!&quot; Amier hopped excitedly, the boy unable to express his excitement in any other form.<br />
<br />
Gently undoing the ribbon that served to shield the contents, the boy&#39;s grandpapa cleared his throat loudly; smacking his lips and stretching his jaw as if to prolong his grandson&#39;s anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>Look upon the dirt trodden path, and you&#39;ll glimpse the object you seek.</em>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What...? That&#39;s… <em>it</em>...? <em>That&#39;s</em> all he--?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The laughter of his grandpapa sent Amier into a state of stunned silence, his storm of complaints rendered null. As if on cue and simply by instruction of the words that had been read off the letter, his starstruck gaze drifted to the path the messenger had both come and gone down.<br />
<br />
Walking up the dirt trodden path, was an older boy not too different in appearance from him; appearing to be nineteen in age. The blue tunic he wore was rather fancy, with various white trimmings and designs at it&#39;s sleeves. The caramel blonde hair that curtained his face served to affirm to Amier who it was, as if his facial structure and ocean blue eyes had not.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-Ar… Arhian!&quot; He stammered, barely able to speak.<br />
<br />
His older brother. A knight serving at the continent south of Esbur, Dalint and it&#39;s Kingdom namesake. It was only three years ago he had left to pursue his dream of becoming one, leaving Amier and their grandpapa alone to tend to the sheep. Of course, he had communicated through written messages, but those were quite rare as they often cost quite a sum due to being an island apart.<br />
<br />
Amier found himself unable to utter a word as his older brother&#39;s arms wrapped tightly around him, the air practically squeezed out of him. He was left choking and gasping for air as he was released, mostly due to the fact he was struggling not to cry his eyes out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet you missed me, now didn&#39;t you, little bro?&quot; Arhian prompted with a grin, a grin that widened as Amier glanced up to meet him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I… yeah…&quot; He sniffled.<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how&#39;s knighthood treatin&#39; ya, boy?&quot; Grandpapa asked with a grin, clearly interested in seeing how much the kingdom had suffered with him no longer it&#39;s guard captain.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s quite a thrill, I&#39;ll admit. Comparing myself to how I was three years ago is quite… interesting I&#39;d say.&quot; Arhian replied with a smile, his ocean blues drifting throughout the interior of the Eihron household; no doubt nostalgic from returning home once more. &quot;Of course, that&#39;s another matter entirely. How have <em>you</em> been, grandpapa?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This ol&#39; horse? Still kickin&#39; like the moment he was born! Toldja I&#39;d still be alive if ya came back!&quot; Grandpapa answered with a chortle, leaning back into his seat as his chest heaved. The scent of alcohol was present in his breath, mostly owed to the fact that Arhian had bought some from the village as a return  gift.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that&#39;s… great... grandpapa!&quot; The blonde laughed with a hint of nervousness, allowing his gaze to shift to the pink-clad boy seated by his side. &quot;And you, Amier? How old are you now? I… forgot to bring you a late gift…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fourteen.&quot; Amier replied with a smile, his elbows propped against the surface of the wooden table. &quot;I don&#39;t need any gifts, Arhian. I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re back home. That&#39;s the best birthday present I could ask for&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww, look at <em>you</em>!&quot; Arhian laughed, bringing his younger brother into another hug; running his fingers through his soft, pink locks of hair affectionately. &quot;You may be older, but you&#39;re the same old little bro I remember!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, yeah!&quot; Amier chirped through his brother&#39;s arms, admittedly struggling to breathe. Only upon squirming, was he released from his brother&#39;s grasp with a worried apology.<br />
<br />
 It was clear that Arhian&#39;s days of knighthood had upped his strength in a much different way than shepherding and farming ever could. It was… different, to say the least. Yet despite so, his brother was really no different than he had been when he had left three years ago; just like Arhian saw him, really...<br />
<br />
Amier couldn&#39;t deny the pain he felt in his chest at the realization that this moment wouldn&#39;t last forever. In only a few days, his older brother would have to leave and return to Dalint. They wouldn&#39;t see each other again until… who knows how long? <br />
<br />
&quot;Say, grandpapa…&quot; Arhian piped up, drawing both the half-drunk old man and Amier&#39;s gaze to him once more.</p>
