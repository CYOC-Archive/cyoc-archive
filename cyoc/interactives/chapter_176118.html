<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a quick trip home, Jay none the wiser about Emma&#39;s silent reservations about his current behavior and the way he was acting and reacting, he went ahead and started checking out his room for any party clothes. He needed to dress up and dress well for the coming party, after all, he would never skimp out when he was invited out to a get together like that. While there he elongated the duration of his transformation while alone in his room before locking the computer again. He didn&#39;t want to chance getting distracted and then transforming back in an inopportune moment.<br />
<br />
Jay then went ahead and started surveying his room for anything he could wear while he was in character as a new girl in the college party scene...and he was remarkably disappointed by the fact that he was only seeing clothes for men in here. Granted he really was a man, but if he wanted to have some fun today, he didn&#39;t want to go to a party dressed in this kind of stuff. He needed some new clothes. Cupping his chin, Jay thought about the local stores.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t well go to his usual places, after all, what he mostly knew didn&#39;t really cater to trendy women. And if Jay was going to be going as &quot;Jaya&quot;, he wanted to be in as a trendy young woman who&#39;d be popular among the guys...well. Purely so he could test the waters and see how this felt. It wasn&#39;t like he was planning on doing anything with these hypothetical guys.<br />
<br />
Even if Terry was indisputably a thick, sexy catch. <br />
<br />
Woah weird tangent to suddenly go to, Jay contemplated. Well, he did just get done flirting Terry up and acting like he was an interested woman who might want to get involved with Terry. Maybe it was just the leftover bits from putting on that kind of character out there? Yeah that...that really explained it.<br />
<br />
Before long Jay headed back out of his room to Emma, who seemed to be contemplating something. Emma, ditzy Emma, contemplating and doing some navel gazing. Things really were changing a lot around here, in more ways than one. Emma asked, &quot;So, where are we going next, Jay? I mean, are we getting ready for the party?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jay said as he looked at the clock briefly, &quot;But I want to look my best for it. And part of looking my best involves getting a really hot new outfit. Care to help me get some clothes and stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
Much as Emma enjoyed the possibility of going for something like this, and how rare indeed it was that Jay wanted to go shopping like this at all with her, the fact was Jay was changed like this during it. And it seemed increasingly to Emma like Jay&#39;s body was not the only thing that was changing... She figured she needed to check and make sure. &quot;You&#39;re...sure you&#39;re not changing too much, Jay? I mean, this all seems like doing a lot...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Emma, please.&quot; Jay started, showing a cocky grin, &quot;It&#39;s still all me in here.&quot; He promptly flexed his arms briefly and crossed them under his breasts, &quot;No need to worry, as soon as I&#39;m done with my fun, I&#39;ll change back. I mean, the Chronivac puts all the power in the hands of the person using it. And it&#39;s not something that&#39;s just suddenly gonna change me on its own.&quot;<br />
<br />
After all that went on today though? Emma was starting to doubt that. But she decided to just...trust Jay. He was having fun doing this, and as long as things didn&#39;t go too far, she guessed she had no real cause for worry. It was just all in good fun, and besides. She was probably gonna get a few new pieces of clothes herself out of this.<br />
<br />
Thus, Jay and Emma headed out to Emma&#39;s car to drive out to the local shopping center to pick up some new clothes for the day. Jay was confident in his ability to pass himself off, even in here, and Emma now that they were heading into La Romantica (one of the trendiest, biggest local female catering clothing stores) was starting to worry her boyfriend might blow his own cover in the most...telling way possible.<br />
<br />
Jay however strode in the front door with aplomb and no limit of confidence, Emma following shortly behind. Jay had never shopped here, so he was struck by how bright and colorful everything was. There were model pictures everywhere, depicting people wearing the various clothes sold here, all of them amazingly sexy. Jay was not so into his activity today that he was rendered attracted by and large to men - he felt a strong attraction here toward not just the modeling pictures but toward the assortment of sexy women maintaining the checkouts and walking the aisles helping shoppers.<br />
<br />
The store had two whole levels to it - the first catered to clothing and underclothes, the second level catered to feminine beauty products. Jay was not sure where he should start from here. There was a large area off to the side where people would be able to try on their clothes in private. Fuck, Jay would&#39;ve never thought to come in here at all prior, but this was really where he wanted to be to look his best for the party today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, wow, looking jacked, girlfriend!&quot; One of the women maintaining the aisles started to walk over - a medium height hardbodied African American beauty that had her hair tied back in braids. Jay felt like this was his lucky day. She had generous breasts, and wore a tank top and tight jeans - both brands that were from here - which accentuated her curves and athletic, busty body. She was someone Jay had seen before at the gym, a would be Kim K who spent much of her time at the squat racks for .... mmm, that booty. Her name tag said Tana.<br />
<br />
Tana continued, &quot;I&#39;ve never seen you around here, I don&#39;t think...&quot; She contemplated a minute, &quot;Is there anything you need?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay smiled lightly, &quot;Well, I&#39;m going to a party tonight...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh you mean the party at Terr-bear&#39;s house?&quot; Tana interjected and visibly swooned, &quot;I love a nice, thick muscle man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay leaned into it and nodded, &quot;Muscled, buff guys are the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emma nodded along, looking at Jay for a minute before recognizing he was probably doing this for a reason. She decided to start looking around for her own clothes, &quot;I&#39;ll just...be looking around for my own things. See ya &#39;round, Jaya.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay waved and then said to Tana, &quot;Alright, so I need to look good for Terry&#39;s party tonight. Can you help me find some clothes that&#39;ll get me looking sexy? Hopefully enough to catch Terry&#39;s eye...?&quot; Jay was just playing, he told himself. Just playing. He wasn&#39;t gonna actually do anything.<br />
<br />
Tana nodded, already moving and guiding Jay toward some blouses. Jay picked out some blue, black and red blouses which would accentuate his bust, which he noted was better than many of the women in here, even some of the aisle assistants. Still, maybe he could do with an upgrade if he really wanted to be eye catching.  Plus, these ones accentuated his biceps, and some guys liked a physically strong woman so he figured he could go with it.<br />
<br />
Tana then showed Jay to some skirts and skinny jeans that Jay immediately took a liking to. He probably couldn&#39;t wear the skinny jeans on account of his manhood and the potential for it to act up, like it was increasingly feeling like it was gonna in here... the skirts were pretty cute though. After picking out what Tana suggested were the best ones for his figure, Jay decided he could do with trying them on.<br />
<br />
Emma quietly tagged along to try on her own clothes. She started to wonder if Jay was changing too much too fast. She even wished he would go for a sexcapade before the party - just to remind her he was still the Jay she remembered... she caught herself and wondered if she was panicking over nothing. She was just dealing with one severely odd day out of many others. After all, after the amount of time passed, Jay would revert. He wouldn&#39;t be like this forever.<br />
<br />
As Jay started to head in to the changing room, he looked around, checking to make sure if there was anything looking in on him. Nope. Nothing. After closing and locking the doors, Jay started to chuckle a little.<br />
<br />
Well, this was a remarkably hot experience. Tana obviously believed every word that Jay was really Jaya, and never once did she suspect anything. Somehow, Jay was actually feeling pretty turned on by this. Just the fact he could pull this kind of thing off at all! Jay stripped down and stood in front of the mirror.<br />
<br />
His toughly, powerfully muscled but now so femininely constructed body and reduced cock and balls...fuck, he had the best of both worlds. I have the tough, powerfully built muscles of one of the campus&#39;s most powerful men, and I have the breasts and beauty of a gorgeous woman, so Jay contemplated.<br />
<br />
And so Jay stared at his oh so alluring reflection as he worked off his boner. Fuck it was amazing to look into the mirror and see this amazing specimen in front of him. His dainty hand wrapping around his meat and jerking it, quick and hard. Jay choked down any moans and groans, even though his newly feminine form seemed to incline him to deep, husky moans rather than masculine grunts.<br />
<br />
Owing to how much he was worked up, he was finding himself quickly succumbing to his need.<br />
<br />
Jay aimed for the area under the seat in the changing room, and as he felt pleasure wash over him, his generous orgasm stained the floor under there. Someone was going to have an odd time taking care of this today, Jay mused to himself as he tucked himself back up, waiting for his manhood to calm down. Once it was, he commenced getting dressed in his new clothes.<br />
<br />
And for his part, Jay loved the reactions of Tana and the others in there. She thought he was gonna be dynamite tonight, and this only made him feel more proud of the job the Chronivac did on him.<br />
<br />
Soon after that, he got dressed in his street clothes again and headed out with the new clothes in a shopping bag. Emma had likewise bought a few new clothes items, but didn&#39;t seem quite so overjoyed about it. She asked Jay quietly as soon as they were outside, &quot;So...even with all this, you&#39;re...uh, you&#39;re sure you&#39;re male?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Emma, as much as I&#39;m having fun today doing this, I&#39;m still a man&#39;s man at heart. Trust me. I know, it&#39;s all so weird...&quot; Jay said with a grin, &quot;But it&#39;s not changing how I really am. I&#39;m your boyfriend Jay Kallum. I bench press 225 on the reg, and I know I could hit that even now.&quot; He contemplated as he got into the car with her, &quot;Mm, about an hour until the party...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we...can we fuck? Like, before the party?&quot; Emma suddenly asked.<br />
<br />
Jay wondered what brought that on - though he guessed she might either be worked up from something, or wanting to confirm his masculinity when he was acting so differently now. Jay contemplated...</p>
