<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Angst, guilt, and naughtiness.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    The entire library had gone dead silent, neither human nor kobold speaking a word. Said silence greatly unnerved Thorin. Kairos was known to be a man of few words, but his appearance, <i>everything</i> about the human felt <i>off</i>...<br />
<br />
    The human&#39;s ocean blue eyes were usually filled with endless wit and intelligence, but as he gazed into the warrior&#39;s eyes, something <i>else</i> was present. <br />
<br />
    Seeing as how Kairos wasn&#39;t going to start a conversation, Thorin figured he&#39;d try to himself.<br />
<br />
    “S-So… Uhm… How&#39;d it go?” Beads of sweat form on the reptile&#39;s face as Kairos doesn&#39;t reply. The human merely reaches down with one hand and picks up the unusual tome he had pulled from his belt. Sliding it across the table, Thorin glances at its cover curiously as it reaches him.<br />
<br />
    It appeared to be a hand-made tome, much more shoddy than the one he&#39;d been given in the academy. The eye symbol on its cover was slitted, bearing a resemblance to his own reptilian eyes. Glancing up at Kairos in puzzlement, the human continues to glare back.<br />
<br />
    “I… don&#39;t understand?” Picking up the tome in curiosity, the kobold flips it open, before cringing and recoiling from the horrendous smell radiating from the pages. Opening one eye, a gasp freezes in Thorin&#39;s throat as the content of the tomes pages were revealed to have been written in blood.<br />
<br />
    Slamming the bloodied tome face down onto the wooden table, the young kobold&#39;s breath quickens in fear. The amount of dark energy emanating from the book chilled him to the bone, his dread filled amber eyes gaze up at Kairos.<br />
<br />
    “W-Where did you get <i>this</i>?!” Thorin&#39;s scaled hands clasp around his maw, muffling his words. Kairos simply leans back in his seat, the creaking wood only making the lizard more anxious. <br />
<br />
    Yet his anxiety increases tenfold when it dawns upon him that the human&#39;s companion, the grey werewolf hadn&#39;t returned with him. “K-Kairos…” The warrior&#39;s blue eyes glint menacingly at the sound of his name, causing Thorin to gulp nervously. <br />
<br />
    “W-Where&#39;s… where&#39;s Orveus?”<br />
<br />
    “<i>Resting</i>.” A broken voice replies, the kobold not realizing the voice had belonged to Kairos himself. The kobold&#39;s anxiety begins to waver, an intense curiosity and apprehension replacing it. <br />
<br />
    Springing to his feet on the chair, the yellow scaled reptile leans over the table in pure desperation, his voice loud yet shaky. “S-Stop being so <i>cryptic</i>! Just t-tell me what happened!” <br />
<br />
    Kairos’ head falls, his blonde curtains of hair obscuring his eyes. Giving a low shaky sigh, his head rises again. Thorin flinches back at the intense guilt filled expression plaguing the human&#39;s usually stoic facial features.<br />
<br />
    “W-We…” Clearing his throat and steeling his will, Kairos’ voice regains its courage. “We encountered a mage in the forest. The mage we were sent out to kill.” Thorin&#39;s eyes fall to the book beneath his stomach, sinking back into his chair to glance at the back of it in dread.<br />
<br />
    “No… the <i>kidnappings</i>?” Thorin&#39;s scales tense as Kairos nods grimly. <br />
<br />
    “He wasn&#39;t the one.” Thorin&#39;s jaw drops in disbelief, before he bites the tips of his claws in unease. The kidnappings had been occurring for quite a while. Many, if not all of the victims were young human men.<br />
<br />
    “W-What do you mean he wasn&#39;t <i>‘the one?!’</i> Did you kill an innocent person?!” <br />
<br />
    “He wasn&#39;t innocent by any means. But that doesn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t a victim himself.” Kairos’ eyes shut, his hands shaking as they grab onto the edge of table for focus. “We killed the target&#39;s <i>son</i>. I stabbed him through the stomach. In his final moments he shot a spell at me, but Orveus took the brunt of the attack.”<br />
<br />
    “<i>N-No…</i>” Thorin&#39;s slitted eyes quiver, unable to comprehend the human&#39;s words. Jumping to his clawed feet again, the kobold&#39;s hands grab onto the edge of the table. But hope shines through as Kairos could&#39;ve potentially taken the werewolf to a healer. “T-The spell! W-What did that mage c-call the spell?! If Orveus is still alive then-”<br />
<br />
    “Serpent&#39;s Kiss. Orveus popped like a balloon.” Thorin&#39;s head shakes in denial, yet Kairos does not relent. It was no joke. <br />
<br />
    “T-That&#39;s… Did his blood…?” Kairos nods, the reptile&#39;s scales breaking out in a cold sweat. The human&#39;s hands drift to the two masks on the desk, one caressing the golden fur of the wolf mask. His blue eyes begin to water, a slight quivering present in his confident voice.<br />
<br />
    Kairos&#39; eyes drift down to the cover of the bloodied tome, the reptilian eye staring into his soul. Thorin&#39;s quiet voice does nothing to hinder it&#39;s gaze.<br />
<br />
    &quot;K-Kairos there&#39;s no need to-&quot;<br />
<br />
    The kobold&#39;s eyes clench shut as Kairos slams his fist down onto the desk, driving all back to silence. Thorin stares in shock as tears stream freely down the human&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
    They were not tears filled with sadness. They were tears filled with an incomprehensible rage, the likes of which he&#39;d never seen before.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I didn&#39;t ask for your <i>pity</i>.&quot; His fist buries into the table, stilling the furnitures movement. Thorin shakes his head, only for Kairos to respond by banging his fist against the wooden surface again.<br />
<br />
    &quot;K-Kairos?!&quot; <br />
<br />
    &quot;Look at me Thorin. Shut up and <i>look at me</i>.&quot; <br />
<br />
    Obeying with reluctance, horror fills the lizardboy&#39;s eyes as he takes in Kairos features. His blonde hair was matted and dull, parts of his red tunic were torn, revealing the stained chainmail underneath. His ocean blue eyes were dark and mad.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Orveus would still be <i>alive</i> if he hadn&#39;t <i>wasted</i> his life trying to save mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Thorin&#39;s eyes widen, his entire body trembling. &quot;D-Don&#39;t say that! Orveus wouldn&#39;t--&quot; The yellow kobold&#39;s scales stand up on end as Kairos rises from his seat, the wooden chair falling and clattering against the library&#39;s floor.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Orveus wouldn&#39;t <i>what</i>?! He wouldn&#39;t want me being pissed that <i>he</i> took the blow instead of <i>me</i>?!&quot; Kairos&#39; fingers grasp the blue scales of the snake mask.<br />
<br />
    &quot;To <i>hell</i> with your pity! I&#39;m <i>weak</i>! The scaled bastard <i>knew</i> I wouldn&#39;t have been able to survive the spell so he used me as to bait kill Orveus!&quot; <br />
<br />
    Thorin shivers as Kairos slowly brings the serpentine mask up towards his face. The energy the object gave off chilled him to his core, as if the mask was <i>craving</i> to be worn.<br />
<br />
    Freezing mere inches from his face, Kairos&#39; blue eyes peers through the eyes of the mask. <br />
<br />
    &quot;Verve trained me as her prodigy, yet I rejected it all and ran away. All those years of training and I have <i>nothing</i> to show for it. If I stayed with her a bit longer I would&#39;ve been able to protect Orveus.&quot; Rasping, Kairos leans on the desk for support, the face of the serpent a hair&#39;s breadth from his own.<br />
<br />
    &quot;He was <i>right</i>. My humanity… If I were to be something <i>else</i>, I can be <i>stronger</i>...&quot; <br />
<br />
    Thorin&#39;s eyes tear up in fear at the human&#39;s demented words. &quot;W-What are you saying Kairos?!&quot; The yellow scaled kobold&#39;s face freezes up as Kairos&#39; hand holding the snake mask suddenly drops to his side. Turning around, Kairos&#39; blues eyes shut.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Kairos <i>wait</i>-&quot; The reptile&#39;s outstretched hand trembles wildly as Kairos&#39; hand holding the mask suddenly rises, smashing the serpentine face onto his own face.<br />
<br />
    &quot;A sword is nothing more than a tool the weak use.&quot; The venomous tone freezes Thorin&#39;s blood cold. Kairos&#39; already raspy voice was even drier, almost grainy.<br />
<br />
    &quot;With this <i>mask</i>, I won&#39;t have need for such a trivial and primal piece of weaponry.&quot; Pure fear fills Thorin as Kairos turns to face him. <br />
<br />
    The face that bore into him was not that of Kairos, but of a serpentman.<br />
<br />
    Kairos&#39; eyes while still blue, were slit and reptilian, their gaze colder than even the fear felt by Thorin. His skin was blue and scaly, reflecting the soft glow of the candle light.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I have no need for this <i>weak</i> form anymore, Thorin. My humanity exposed my weakness. By discarding it, I&#39;ll be stronger.&quot; <br />
<br />
     Thorin stares on in a mix of silent horror and twisted fascination as the blue scales from Kairos&#39; serpentine face spread down his neck and body, consuming both flesh and cloth in a mix of messy squelching and  ear splitting tearing.<br />
<br />
    Crumpling to his knees, Kairos moans in ecstasy, the jaws of the snake mask ripping open and distorting his voice into a deep, lust filled hiss.<br />
<br />
    Writhing wildly, another hiss slips from Kairos&#39; maw as the scales consume his hands, smoothing out as a light slimy residue forms on his palms. Clenching and unclenching his fist, Kairos&#39; fangs glint as long deadly claws extend from his fingertips. <br />
<br />
    Stilling his movements, his serpentine gaze falls to his feet as the scales spread across them, his boots outlined as the scales completely consume them. Hissing, Kairos&#39; claws dig into the library&#39;s wooden floor as his footwear begins to implode, the blue scales pulling up and clinging onto his feet and holding them tight, <i>becoming</i> his skin. The sole and rounded shape of his boots thin, before the shape of his toes could be seen, the blue scales pleasurable pressing against him from the boot to his shin. A clawed reptilian hand lustfully gropes his crotch as his toes bulge. His feet wiggle in bliss, the instep extending as the toes spread outwards, melding together to form three claws.<br />
<br />
    Clenching his clawed toes lustfully, Kairos rolls to his side as a light tugging from his backside overrides his senses. His slit eyes widen in joy as a long blue scaled tail writhes around, books falling from their shelves as his tail knocks against them. <br />
<br />
    Tail coiling around his legs, a hiss freezes in the snakeman&#39;s throat as it&#39;s tip lightly prods at his pucker. Hissing, Kairos desperately clutches the mass of scales his dick resides in, moaning distortedly as the scales slowly melt into a mass of foreskin as his rod lengthens. His balls groan loudly as they bloat to the size of grapefruits, churning with seed.<br />
<br />
    Grinding against the wooden floorboards, Kairos yells in glee as his tail penetrates him, a loud squelching echoing throughout the library as his dick suddenly splits in two, thick white liquid spurting out from both rods.<br />
<br />
    Panting, the blue serpentman, Kairos, stumbles to his feet, drops of cum falling to his reptilian feet. Claws clicking against the wooden floor of the library as he flexes his toes, his cold gaze falls to the form of a shivering yellow kobold, it&#39;s face buried into a large black cloak, slit amber eyes overcome with fear.<br />
<br />
    &quot;<i>K-Kairos…</i>&quot; Thorin&#39;s trembling increases tenfold as the blue snakeman slowly steps towards him. The intense scent emanating from his blue scales was hypnotic, awakening foreign feelings within him. <br />
<br />
    &quot;No… I&#39;m…&quot; Losing his footing, the snakeman stumbles backwards, falling into a bookcase. Clasping his face, the snakeman&#39;s mind goes blank as his eyes flash a distinct shade of purple, before quickly fading back to the oceanic blue of Kairos.<br />
<br />
    Shaking his head, the blue scaled serpent rises up again, his eyes staring at Thorin in a mix of lust and contempt. <br />
<br />
    &quot;Thorin… Why do you look ssso ssssscared…? Don&#39;t you think I look ssso much sssstronger now…?&quot; Kairos lustfully fondles his scaled sack, tugging lightly at his scaled foreskin before using another hand to grope his pecs.<br />
<br />
    Thorin&#39;s reptilian maw opens to scream, yet nothing resounds as the serpentman begins to drunkenly step towards him, it&#39;s blue eyes blind with lust.</p>
