<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yuriko paused, gazing at her surroundings before turning to face R3xie and Ayami. Word had spread quickly about Mia and zack escaping with baby Yuriko. While the circumstances of their escape were altered from the previous future, the children were still in great danger. <br />
<br />
&quot;So any idea where they could have gone,&quot; Ayami asked. Yuriko shrugged, her godparents hadn&#39;t given her any clues as to where they escaped. Even if they had considering they had altered the future their was no way of determining their location.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well think future girl,&quot; Rexie bellowed. &quot;I cant leave Mia all by herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey I&#39;m just as worried as you,&quot; Yuriko countered. &quot;She may be your master but their my godparents. Besides, in case you hadn&#39;t noticed my past self is in danger too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ayami sighed as the teen and imp began to argue. This was getting them nowhere. As the succubus was about to speak, she noticed a group of teens approach. &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi, Felicia, Adam, Haley, and Aaron cautiously looked the two demons over before speaking. &quot;We heard you were going to look for the kids,&quot; Felicia said quietly. &quot;We want to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What could you possibly offer as help,&quot; Ayami scoffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s my niece,&quot; Naomi stated. &quot;I cant let anything happen to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And our cousin,&quot; Haley added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mia and Zack are friends,&quot; Felicia offered.  &quot;I dont want anything to happen to them.&quot; Ayami narrowed her eyes as she now looked at the large teenage boy standing next to Felicia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um I&#39;m here because of Felicia,&quot; he offered meekly. &quot;Cant let her run off and get hurt.&quot; Ayami sighed in disgust, her shoulders slumping. &quot;Fine just stay out of my way.&quot;<br />
<br />
*************************************<br />
<br />
Zack and Mia carefully peaked out from behind a dumpster. The two children had been on the run for sometime now. Although they had avoided detection so far, a problem had arisen. <br />
<br />
The children had only been able to find so many supplies to take care of the baby. After a week on the run, those supplies were dwindling fast. Baby Yuriko was now fussing, the infants stomach growling with hunger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zack Yuriko wont stop crying,&quot; Mia said sadly as she tried to comfort the infant. &quot;And she feels a little warm. I&#39;m worried she might be getting sick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we have anything left to eat,&quot; Zack asked as he pointed towards the backpack they had found. Mia opened it, frowning before shaking her head. &quot;Didnt think so,&quot; he sighed. Gazing across the street Zack spotted a drug store that appeared to be open. Zack could tell ot was the kind of place that was a one stop shop for all your needs. Food, medicine, baby supplies, Zack could see all of those things through the large front windows.<br />
<br />
While this was a great, Zack was having a crisis of conscience. The two 11 year olds had no money, meaning they would have to steal. Zack wasnt particularly fond of the idea but saw little recourse. The kids were hungry, the baby needed diapers, and considering they were being chased by men in black suits, they had no way of getting help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Mia just follow me inside,&quot; Zack said. Mia nodded, trying to comfort the fuzzy infant. As the two children entered the store they blinked, their eyes adjusting to the lighting. <br />
<br />
For the two 11 year olds it was as if they had found paradise. After sleeping in abandoned buildings and hiding the warmth of the store was a great comfort. Add to it the rows of food, clothes, and toys and the children found themselves almost giddy with excitement. Slowly Mia now grabbed a carriage, pushing it slowly up one of the aisles as they gathered supplies.<br />
<br />
Zack cautiously watched for any adults. Since fleeing the hospital the wolf beast had found that law enforcement had gone from friend to foe. Zack had been a bit disappointed when the police attempted to take them in. Part of him knew they were just trying to find someplace safe, but another part feared they would bring him back to the men that were chasing them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Zack I need some help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack turned to see Mia was now struggling to open a case containing baby formula. Taking a closer look he could see it appeared that only store employees could open it. Cursing under his breath he quickly scanned the area, seeing they were alone.<br />
<br />
Zack began transform, the boys size and muscles growing rapidly as he grew into an impressive looking werewolf. Grasping the clear door, Zack wrenched it open, jumping as a shrill alarm began to blare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey what are you doing,&quot; an employee yelled as he rounded the corner. The employee gasped, the color draining from his face as he looked at the massive werewolf.<br />
<br />
Zacks eyes went wide with fright as he looked towards Mia. Mia understood, concentrating she now cast a spell, a group of extension cords in the next aisle over, coming to life and wrapping the employee up like a mummy. Unfortunately the employee had the where with all to scream to his co worker to call the police.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zack with have to run NOW,&quot; Mia bellowed.<br />
<br />
The two children now sprinted towards the front of the store, pushing the carriage they had with them. As they sprinted towards the doors they could see the other worker locking it before turning towards the would be thieves. The workers eyes went wide though as he saw the massive werewolf barrel towards him.<br />
<br />
Zack didnt stop, colliding shoulder first with their would be captor. The impact sent the worker sailing, landing in a heap and sending a display case crashing down. Closing his eyes Zack yelled before crashing through the reinforced glass door.<br />
<br />
Zack blinked as he now gazed over the parking lot. He had completely obliterated the door, pieces of glass now scattered in all directions. As he assisted Mia and the baby out of the store, his ears perked up as the sounds of sirens drew nearer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mia the cops are coming,&quot; he said quickly.<br />
<br />
Mia nodded, clutching Yuriko tightly to her chest as Zack now picked up the carriage and his best friend. As he darted away into the woods, he chanced a glance backwards. Thankfully it appeared the police hadn&#39;t seen them as they entered the building. Now they just needed to find somewhere safe to spend the night.</p>
