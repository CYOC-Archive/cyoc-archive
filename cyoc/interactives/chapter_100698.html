<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dina placed her paws against her head in frustration.  &quot;Okay, let me get this straight - I am your master, but Roy is my master, so anything he orders you to do supersedes my orders?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Master Roy is the ultimate master.  I must follow his commands, &quot; said Lilly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ughh, &quot; grunted Dina.  &quot;Maybe I need someone with some balls.  Maybe it will be different with a guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
She aimed the gun at a young man jogging through the park.  In a flash, a new cat girl maid ran up to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Master, how may I serve..... &quot; said the new cat girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I get it.  Listen, you have to do whatever  I say right?  Follow my orders?&quot; asked Dina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... As long as it does not conflict with my ultimate Master Roy&#39;s wishes, &quot; said the cat girl.<br />
<br />
Dina hissed in frustration.  &quot;Maybe it will be different with an animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
She aimed it at a cat, and was surprised to see it developed into a cat girl maid with more feline features that kept punctuating its sentences with an annoying &#39;Nya, nya, nya&#39;.  But the result was the same.  It was still loyal to Roy.<br />
<br />
Dina cursed, fiddled with the ray gun, and fired randomly at strangers in the park, but no matter what she did, the result was always the same.  They remained loyal to Roy. Dina was still experimenting, converting more people into cat girl maids, when she heard a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dina, what are you doing!?!&quot; said a voice behind Dina.  Dina&#39;s  blood went cold when she recognized the voice of her master Roy.  She slowly turned to face him, head down in shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me that ray gun .... RIGHT NOW, &quot; said Roy.<br />
<br />
Dina sheepishly handed the gun back to him without complaint.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Master, &quot; said Dina sadly.<br />
<br />
Roy was staring angrily at her, with his arms crossed.  Beside him was a young girl in a punk outfit, with a black ripped shirt from some band Dina didn&#39;t recognize and a matching pair of torn black pants.  Her hair was pink, and pulled up in pigtails.  Numerous metal piercings dotted her face, and a tattoo of an anime cat was peeking over her shoulder near her neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, &quot; said the girl when she saw  Dina up close.  &quot;I thought you were just some kind of strange dude who was into cat girls like me.  I didn&#39;t really think cat girls were real, or that you really had a ray gun that could turn me into one.  But this is awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl stepped forward and touched Dina&#39;s ears.  Dina angrily slapped her hands away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get your hands off me, you little weirdo!&quot; yelled Dina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dina, you stop that right now.  Apologize, and be polite to our new friend, &quot; said Roy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Master, &quot; said Dina.  She curtsied,  and said, &quot; I am sorry for my rude behavior, new friend.  I am very pleased to make your acquaintance.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young punk girl squealed in joy, and clapped her hands.<br />
 <br />
&quot;That&#39;s better.  Now can you please explain to me what is going on here? I leave you alone for one afternoon, and what do I find?  Reports of a massive herd of cat girls assembling in the park.  I didn&#39;t even bother to go home to look for the gun.  I mean, what else would cause a massive increase in the cat girl population?  I suspected one of my adversaries may have stolen it for their own nefarious purposes. Imagine my surprise when I found that it was none other than my most loyal servant.  Just what were you thinking?  And don&#39;t lie to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dina sighed, and told him the truth.  &quot;I was just sick of being a cat girl, and your slave.  I thought maybe if I had my own cat girl army, they could help me get my freedom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roy sighed.  &quot;Dina, you are a servant, not a slave.  Have I ever treated you poorly?  Have I ever beaten you or hurt you?  Yes, I ask you to help around the house, but in return I give you food and shelter.  Is that such an awful situation?  When I saw you before, you were sad and alone. Transforming you was meant to be a gift, not a curse.  Admittedly, not asking your permission was a mistake. But I just couldn&#39;t imagine anyone refusing my offer. Was your life really that much better before?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dina thought about it.  She had a lousy boring job, a string of terrible cheating and jerky ex-boyfriends, and no real friends to speak of. It had been odd to become a cat girl maid, but she had to admit it had made her life a lot more interesting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had tolerated your behavior because I thought that was just your personality. Not to my taste, but who am I to judge?  But if you are really unhappy, perhaps we should just part company.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? &quot; said Dina.  &quot;You can make me human again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m afraid not.  But I can release you to find another employer.  I do have a colleague by the name of Dr. Ludo Chris who is always looking for good help, if you are interested?&quot; said Roy.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no.  I think I will be fine on my own.  I just want my freedom, &quot; said Dina.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish.  But first I believe we have some other business that needs to be addressed first.  A little transfer of ownership?&quot; said Roy, as he waved his hands towards the herd of cat girls Dina had created.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want them, they are yours.  Cat girl maids of Dina, I command you to be loyal only to Roy, and obey only his commands.  I will no longer be your master, and you will not need to follow my requests anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cat girls gave a loud collective sigh.  &quot;Ohhh.  We will miss you, Master Dina.  Hello, Master Roy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dina had to admit that she was a little sad, too.  Although they had only spent a short time together, they felt a little like family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Master Roy, I kept my end of the bargain, now you fulfill yours, &quot; said Dina.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish. I am a man of my word, after all.  Dina, I command you to no longer follow my commands against your will.  I command you to not feel compelled to be loyal to me. I command you to have free will, and I command you to be free, &quot; said Roy.<br />
<br />
Dina felt a little tingle in her head.  &quot;Woo hoo, &quot; she shouted, as he ran around the park like a loon.  &quot;Thanks, Roy.  You are not such a bad guy, after all.  See ya.&quot;  She began to run away through the park.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dina, wait!  Are you sure you will be okay?  It is a rough world out there, especially for someone unique like you.  You are welcome to return if you change your mind.  But you must agree to follow my rules.  No more disobedience, &quot; said Roy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, please stay with us, &quot; said a chorus of cat girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, thanks.  I appreciate your concern, but I will be fine on my own, &quot; said Dina as she disappeared into the trees of the park.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, are we gonna do this or what?&quot; said the young punk girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come, girls.  I think we might have a new girl to welcome to the fold very soon, &quot; said Roy, as he rounded up his cadre of cat girls, and headed home to his large mansion. He cast one sad glance back to the spot where Dina disappeared, then placed his arms around his newest cat girl maids and smiled.</p>
