<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan, dressed in average clothes for a boy his age, tank top, shorts and tennis shoes, carrying his red backpack, hiked into the clearing he and Ian had claimed as their own since elementary school days.   It had a “tree fort” up in a large Oak, and several logs to climb and play on.  Now, though, being of High School age, the most they ever did together was sit on the logs and study together, or climb up to the tree fort to talk about things they figured would get them in trouble if parents heard them, or look at stolen dirty magazines.   Of course the only pictures in them were of women, which didn’t turn Dan on at all, but watching Ian’s bulge grow as HE looked at them did, so he found it easy to fake.   Ian had several times, whipped his member out to give it some good old fashioned jerking while looking at those magazines, and Dan always joined him, pretending to look at the women, while really enjoying the sight of Ian’s cock, hard and wet with pre-cum, being jerked by his best friend.   They usually climaxed together, oddly enough.<br />
<br />
          Today, though, he planned for the clearing’s activities to be a bit more… hands-on… each OTHER.  When he arrived, he saw Ian, pacing back and forth in the clearing, chewing his bottom lip and his brow furrowed in worry.  “Hey, bud…. You ok?”  Dan called to Ian as he entered.<br />
<br />
          “Huh?!” Ian sputtered as he jumped about three feet in the air, surprised.   He sighed with relief when he saw it was just Dan.   “Dan, man, don’t sneak up on me like that!”<br />
<br />
          Dan stopped and blinked, “What’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
          “Yesterday’s got me all worried, man… waking up naked in your bathroom… did I like freak out or something?   Did I do anything to you?  Man, I couldn’t sleep, worried that I was like, going nuts or something.”<br />
<br />
          Dan smiled.  “No, it’s ok… you were fine.”<br />
<br />
          “But what happened?  You said you’d tell me…”<br />
<br />
          Dan nodded and grinned, “Sit down and chill… it’ll be ok, I’ll explain it all.”<br />
<br />
          Ian nodded, took a deep breath and forced himself to relax, sitting on a log.<br />
<br />
          Dan sat down next to him and smiled.   “Yesterday… this happened.”  He winked at Ian, and Ian suddenly changed back into a Satyr, with ram-style horns, muscular chest, arms and stomach, furry legs and hooves, huge cock, and totally naked, and getting erect.  “And damn, was it cool.”<br />
<br />
          Ian gasped, looking down at himself, his body, legs, chest and cock.  He blinked as the cock hardened before his eyes, pointing to the sky, and stretching to a good 10 inches long.   “Oh man… I.. this…. I remember…. This rocks!   But… but why… do I feel like I wanna fuck… you?”   His tail wagged as he looked at Dan.<br />
<br />
          Dan giggled and smiled, leaning forward and gripping Ian’s cock for the first time ever, another of his dreams finally true.   “Because Satyrs do that…” He started stroking his best friend’s Satyr-cock, gripping it tightly, feeling the warm flesh as he slid his hand up and down on it, his other hand reaching to caress Ian’s muscled and sexy chest.   Dan’s cock hardened, pressing his shorts out into a tent, quite obviously, as Dan had decided he’d not wear underwear today.<br />
<br />
          Ian moaned, reaching a hand under Dan’s shirt to feel his slim smooth chest in return, moving the other hand to pull down the front of Dan’s shorts and release his 6 inch typical human cock, which he then grabbed and stroked just as tightly and slowly.   “Oh man…. Dan…. You feel so good…”<br />
<br />
          Dan smiled and gasped, feeling is best friend’s hand on his raging hardon, yet another wish come true.  He rocked his hips, humping Ian’s fist as he stroked Ian’s massive shaft, leaning down to lick the precum from Ian’s thick tip, giving in to all the fantasies he’d jerked off too about Ian all these years.<br />
<br />
          Ian shivered at the lick, gasping, “ Ohhh, it never felt this good before…” He jerked Dan’s cock faster, moaning and caressing him.<br />
<br />
          Dan moaned and took the massive head into his mouth, sucking on it hard, while licking the sensitive hole repeatedly, as he started jerking Ian’s shaft faster and faster, humping Ian’s jerking hand, nearing climax.<br />
<br />
          Ian moaned, and started humping into Dan’s hand and mouth as well, his massive Satyr-balls drawing up, ready to fill his best friend with his juice.<br />
<br />
          Dan moaned, and gripped Ian’s dick tightly as he started to cum, spurts of grayish-white spunk splattering Ian’s hand and chest.<br />
<br />
          Ian gasped as Dan gripped his cock in the throes of his climax, triggering Ian’s own, shooting thick gobs of pure white, sweet cum down Dan’s throat, his climax lasting longer than he could ever think possible.<br />
<br />
          Dan’s climax lasted longer too, being fed by the Satyr-cum he drank, spurting and covering Ian’s furry legs with sticky semen.   Eventually, after several minutes, his prolonged orgasm finally subsided, and he just panted through his nose, spent, drinking the last of Ian’s cum.<br />
<br />
          Ian spurted and spurted down his friend’s throat until he too was finally spent, moaning and laying back on the log.  “Oh god…. Dan…. You’re so cool.”<br />
<br />
          Dan slipped his lips from Ian’s cock, puffing out his cheeks and exercising his jaw a bit after being around the massive Satyr-head.   He swallowed the last of the Satyr-cum and smiled, looking at his cum-soaked Satyr friend.  “You’re perfect.”<br />
<br />
          Ian laughed, bleatishly, “I am?  Okay…”   He sat up, looking at himself, “And you came like loads more than you do when we look at playboy…”<br />
<br />
          Dan grinned, “I wonder why….”<br />
<br />
          Ian chuckled, “You know, I think I like your cum all over me…”  He proceeded to rub Dan’s cum into his smooth, muscled chest and belly, and over and along his still hard shaft.  “Damn, man, my cock won’t go down…. Maybe I need to cum again?”<br />
<br />
          Dan shrugged, “Maybe…..”<br />
<br />
          Ian moaned and smiled, feeling the slick cum slide along and around his shaft as he started to masturbate, his cock coated in Dan’s semen.  “Hey, dude… take your clothes off.. I wanna cum on your chest.”<br />
<br />
          Dan chuckled and nodded, “Okay!”   He smiled, happily stripping for the Satyr, dropping his clothes on the warm sunlit ground.  He was an attractive guy, actually:  smooth, hairless, lithe and thin, fit without being buff, and nice perky nipples.   He grinned as he stood naked and still semi-hard, watching his Satyr-friend jerk off with Dan’s own cum.<br />
<br />
          Ian grinned as he watched Dan strip, “Man, I never knew you looked so good!”  He laughed, jerking his cock faster, making sloppy noises as the slick, cum-covered cock got even harder under the   pressure.  He rubbed Dan’s cum around the tip of the huge Satyr cock and jerked harder, standing up and walking over to Dan, looking his old friend up and down and whistling as he jerked off.  “I could look at you forever, man…. God, you make me so horny!”   He laughed bleatishly and jerked faster, looking at Dan’s smooth chest and cock, jerking more, moaning, gasping and rocking his hips back and forth, until he finally started cumming again, squirting Dan’s bare chest, belly and cock, and even up to Dan’s shoulders with thick white Satyr cum.  “ Ohhhh Dan……!”<br />
<br />
          Dan gasped and smiled, feeling the warm spurting all over him.  “Yeah…”<br />
<br />
          Ian spurted and spurted until Dan was soaking wet with cum, and then finally slowed and stopped.  “God, man, that was like the best cum ever…. They both were.”<br />
<br />
          Dan giggled, looking at his slick cum-covered chest, belly and cock, the cum somehow making Dan hard again, even though he’d just cum not more than a few minutes prior.  He rubbed his hands all over his chest, feeling the cum slide on his skin, over his whole body.   He grabbed his cock and started masturbating, staring at the Satyr before him and smiling.<br />
<br />
          Ian watched Dan masturbate, grinning and jerking his STILL-hard cock a third time, matching Dan’s movements with his own.<br />
<br />
          Dan moaned, jerking and jerking until he climaxed again, starting to spurt more cum out in an arc from his cock.<br />
<br />
          Ian licked his lips, watching him, then pounced Dan’s spurting cock, taking it into his mouth and sucking, drinking every last drop of Dan’s cum as Ian started to cum again, all over the forest ground.<br />
<br />
          Dan moaned and collapsed back onto the soft grass, totally spent and sighing happily, slipping his cock from Ian’s lips.   “Oh Ian…. I could stay here forever.”<br />
<br />
          Ian licked his lips and smiled.   “Man, I…” He blinked, looking out into the woods.   “feel like… I…could….”<br />
<br />
          Dan blinked and sat up, “Ian?”<br />
<br />
          Ian’s eyes glazed over, and he blinked, looking into the deep parts of the forest, trails that led off to places not seen in a hundred years, if ever.  “Home…”<br />
<br />
          Dan started to panic and stood up quickly, dripping cum onto the ground, into the puddle Ian had made, “Ian.. what’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
          Ian didn’t respond.  Instead, he just took off at a gallop, his hooves and strong Satyr legs carrying him far and fast.  He vanished from view within seconds.<br />
<br />
          “IAN!!”  Dan called after him, but it was too late.  His best friend was gone, off into the woods, to find where all Satyrs go and had gone.  Dan stood staring at the woods, the grass and hard ground, too hard to leave hoof-tracks for several minutes, until all he could do was sit back on the log and sigh.   “Crap…. what did I do?”<br />
<br />
          He shook his head and sighed, but then nodded to himself, “He’ll be back… he has to be…. And I have to go to school.”   He stood, walked over to the little stream by the clearing, jumped in, washed the cum from his body, got out, then dried off on a towel from inside his backpack.  “Good thing I have swimming practice today…”   He dressed and headed out, late for school, but still on his way there, anyway.<br />
<br />
          As he walked the mile to school from the woods, he started thinking.  Mmm… swimming practice… all those cute boys… I wonder if the spell would work on them too?  No… what if they run off?   Humm .. well, mermen can’t run, can they?   He giggled to himself, feeling a little better.   And, by the time, he got to school… it would be time for swimming…. Perfect.</p>
