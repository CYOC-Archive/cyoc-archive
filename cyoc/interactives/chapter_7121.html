<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Weakness was a palpable thing.<br /><br />

Sid could feel it pressing down on him like heavy weights, squeezing the life out of him.  If he squinted, the shadows at the edge of his vision almost started looking like heavy, oppressive pools of tar, suspended in midair but pressing down upon his back and shoulders.<br /><br />

But it was a weariness that went beyond his body.  No, it was as if the Incubus had drawn something even more vital from him ... something akin to 'motivation'.<br /><br />

He was still much stronger than a child, that he knew, so it was this latter feeling of uninspired malaise that he attributed the heavy feeling of the dice in his palm.  Indeed, it was like holding aloft a pair of heavy soup cans rather than two, small, white cubes.<br /><br />

With a lackluster toss, Sid dropped the dice onto the game board and watched them roll.<br /><br />

His world became the spinning cubes; their black dots dancing before his leonine eyes.  But soon enough, exaggerated motions or not, the dice came to a halt.<br /><br />

"2" and "1".<br /><br />

"Three," Tyler said, sitting across from him, looking up from his diminished place at the table.<br /><br />

Sid nodded and watched as the tiny, skinny lion pawn slid soundlessly across the board (past Chris' detestable, rich-boy rabbit piece) stopping, unceremoniously on another white "CHANGE" space.<br /><br />

The four players moaned, aloud.<br /><br />

"Oh God..."<br /><br />

"...no..."<br /><br />

"Holy shit," muttered Sid, looking at his friends.  "What did I do to deserve this?"<br /><br />

The board was basically divided into four tracks; the center-most of which -as they'd discovered earlier- was rife with the white "CHANGE" squares.  Every now and then there was an intersection that led to the outermost tracks, each one with successively fewer white spaces but resulting in a longer game with more unexpected changes.  In another two spaces, Sid would encounter another intersection and have a chance to get out of this loop.<br /><br />

However, in the meantime...<br /><br />

"Don't worry," chimed in the tiny Tyler, "I'm not drawing for you, this time..."<br /><br />

"Gee thanks," the exhausted lion said, sarcastically.  Gingerly, he reached over to the stack of cards and picked up the top one.  With one more glance at Tyler and the Incubus (God, his eyes wanted to linger there ... just a moment longer) before flipping it over and reading it aloud.<blockquote><i>"Strength of character, you have in spades,<br />But this, you certainly know...<br />Though to keep you playing and fix your 'fades',<br />Your strength shall grow and grow."</i></blockquote>"Uh, am I reading that right?" asked Chris, looking at the lion next to him.  However, the view awaiting him there answered his question.<br /><br />

Sid felt a burning heat run from his toes, up through his legs, into his chest, across his shoulders and out to the top of his head and fingertips, simultaneously.  Letting out a sharp, gasping intake of breath, the weakened lion's eyes sprung open wide, his lack of motivation spurred into an adrenaline-packed leap to his feet!<br /><br />

"AAARRRRrrrrrrr!" he growled, his voice deep and bellowing, almost like a real lion in a zoo.  The heat felt like it was staying where it went and began to throb with an ache that defied anything he'd ever felt before.<br /><br />

However, as he took in the surroundings, he could see his arms thickening as he watched.  His shriveled muscles twitched and flexed, without his conscious effort, as if he were working out.  Each one of his major muscle groups, his arms, legs, chest and abdomen, began to swell and expand.<br /><br />

He couldn't walk or even stumble effectively as his body began tightening and loosening in a series of ever-expanding pulses of an exercise-like burn.<br /><br />

He roared, again; his head tilted back and his mane whipping about wildly as he tried to keep his balance.  The skinny lion's sunken chest and emaciated belly began filling out with ripped, pure muscle.  Almost no fat had been left behind by the Incubus' assault on him so the muscle he was gaining, now, had the most distinct definition of anyone he'd ever seen.  Even the soft layer of tawny fur that covered his body did little to obscure his build as it expanded outwards while the minutes passed.<br /><br />

The Incubus stood and reached out to try and support him but Sid brushed the clawed hand, away.  "No," he managed to snarl as his chest ballooned out, growing more and more barrel-shaped.  "I ... I can ... handle this..."<br /><br />

Widening his stance, Sid could feel the waistband of his pants starting to rip and the upper part of his jeans stretching thinner and thinner as seams began to pop and tear.  His shirt, once a bit tight over the extra inch or so of fur that he'd grown on his torso, tightened a more and more.  Soon, long, oval rips began to appear across his chest as the lion expanded into the range of the most colossal of bodybuilders.<br /><br />

"We've got to stop this...  He...he's not stopping..."<br /><br />

Tyler sighed, his annoyance with Chris somewhat overwhelmed by his gaping stare at what was happening across the table from him.  "Listen, bunny-boy, we've not figured out how to stop any of the other things that've happened...  Besides, how would you suggest we start?"<br /><br />

Chris shut up again, and bit his lower lip, his fine lapine sense of smell picking up increased scent activity from the lion...<br /><br />

...It made him feel ... afraid.<br /><br />

But to Sid, his muscular growth was intoxicating!  His pants, from his thighs on down, soon ripped, showing the tight, enormous muscles of his legs as they kept growing bigger and bigger.  His massive arms swelled outwards even more, now, unable to fully come to a rest at his side ... in fact, as the growth began to slow, he realized that he was starting to look more like a caricature of a bodybuilder than any authentic muscleman.<br /><br />

Soon, his height unchanged, his muscle growth came to an end.<br /><br />

Still pumped by the metamorphosis, the now massively muscled lion glanced about himself, feeling how tightly his remaining clothing -ripped though it was- clung to his furry body.  He snarled at the constraint and realized that his panting, during his metamorphosis, had made his belly and chest swell with more than just muscle.  Rounded like a hyper-muscular, lion-shaped balloon, he couldn't help but laugh at himself, releasing a flood of inhaled air as he growled.<br /><br />

"Ok," he said, "this was worth the wait..."<br /><br />

Reaching down, the lion picked up the dice and handed them to the Incubus with a toothy smile.  "Looks like it's your turn, now..."<br /><br />

The others only stared at Sid, even as the demon took the dice from his hand.  The lion, while still only standing at about five-foot-ten, was now more heavily muscled than any Mr. Universe any of them had ever seen.  The diameter of Sid's upper arms, alone had to be nearly a foot and a half across and his thighs, nearly two feet thick!  He was a monstrosity of muscle mass that outweighed them all...<br /><br />

Sid, though, the adrenaline of his transformation finally fading, sat back down and felt the odd malaise slowly creeping back into him.  He shook his head, trying to clear it, but -soon- realized that what the Incubus had drained from him had only been partially made-up for.  He may be hearty and strong but that bit of his drive ...his essence or soul... was still missing.<br /><br />

Scowling with the realization, he looked at the demon on his left and repeated, "Your turn:  let's see what you get, demon..."</p>
