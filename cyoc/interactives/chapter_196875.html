<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The month of February proved to be a rather big month as Chinese New Year started, and many were absorbed in following the online and what &quot;televised&quot; broadcasts of the Year of the Tiger competition had. But there were other elements to the month as the world struggled through other events and saw Horizon and Animalia as options for recovery and efforts at a new future. A lot of this heavily related to the establishment of colonies, which was something that Animalia would then be able to expand on. It was something that had seemed to play out in many places as Animalian colonies seemed to increase local economic activities and this then made it attractive for various countries around the world. Even countries like Egypt had seen their economy improve with the establishment of an Animalian colony, and this then brought attention to Animalia from India. This ultimately led to Horizon&#39;s CEO, Melvin Qvite, to come to India to see to the possible colony site.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are very pleased that would come all this way to see the site,&quot; a man reported with a small smile after representing himself as part of a team represented the government. Some came from the executive branch of India&#39;s government, some from the legislature, and even the local area. &quot;Though we expected someone from Animalia, itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Horizon CEO gave a bit of a chuckle, as this was something that often came up. Often times because Horizon and Animalia were so heavily linked that at times the colonies, which were more often than not sponsored by Horizon, would have someone from Animalia participate. That was partially on what happened with Mieni at first, but in many ways the more Animalia expanded the less it could really rely on Animalia itself, as they were busy governing their own city and wouldn&#39;t have the time to fully grasp the exact needs and demands in the area. This largely left Horizon better placed, as it was often seeking to expand its own research and scientific faculties to many of the places that ultimately became Animalian colonies. India would ultimately be no different in that respect.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is no problem,&quot; Melvin answered, staying silent on some of the restrictions and issues that had to be passed to commit to the travel, much of which also coming from Covid related issues that the Indian government worried on in addition some Americans, &quot;but Animalia has a lot of its own activities going on, and to a degree the one that might have the most interest in actually coming to India is in the Year of the Tiger competition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the one who represented the national Indian legislature commented, &quot;we had a deal with the zoo in Lyre to buy a White Tigress named Ava. But she was among those uplifted in the initial outbreak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And she and her bond mate are presently studying science and biology,&quot; Melvin answered, &quot;at least so far as I know... though, as I said... the Year of the Tiger competition is fairly big.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How are they doing?&quot; the local village representative wondered curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the last part that I was able to see was the pageant,&quot; Melvin answered, &quot;I believe Ava did fairly well there. Though, as I understand it, that was mostly in being able to look good in a dress and had a good sense of cause that the judges liked. Though, so far as I know that wouldn&#39;t help her that much against Tuxing and Liao from Heiya Island, particularly as they have tournament of fights coming up that the two of them dedicated martial artists.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My daughter likes their comic,&quot; the local village representative commented, &quot;though... a lot of that is different from why we are all here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melvin nodded as he looked about the conference room they were in in a modest village in Rajasthan, India. So far as he knew, it was in connection with the village&#39;s government and that&#39;s essentially brought in the local village representative.  Some of the other men that were present that represented the national government for India likely represented local environmental and economic factors, which made sense to a degree. On the drive in, he could see some of the greenery and &quot;jungle&quot; that was around the village. Though he could also see how India had also been developing with rail lines and other things of that nature. It was something that Melvin expected in parts of North America, especially given the US&#39;s level of industrialization. It wasn&#39;t something he expected in India, though he also had to admit to himself that India was something he really only knew of from story books that often talked more about the jungle than the people&#39;s economy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Melvin spoke as he nodded, &quot;you had the wish for an Animalian colony city.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The idea would provide some opportunities for economic advancement and help from Horizon,&quot; one of the national level politicians spoke, &quot;as well as an option for medical improvements.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can help with that, though it should be noted that most of the doctors that Horizon employs are either researchers or geneticists,&quot; Melvin warned, &quot;they wouldn&#39;t necessarily add to your country&#39;s medical care abilities as it is now. And those that do practice medicine have largely combined Human medicine and veterinary medicine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of that may be helpful as well,&quot; the representative for the ministry trying to protect India&#39;s wildlife commented, &quot;as in many ways, given how endangered animals like the tiger, the rhinoceros, the guar, and the wild herds of elephants are... we can&#39;t really afford to uplift the mundane animals... unless they&#39;re found to be sick, wounded, or an otherwise threat to the local population.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It might also provide for an easier opening to get things like the Rabies Vaccine,&quot; one of the other men spoke, &quot;we know that the US doesn&#39;t have many Human deaths from the disease... but we do see higher case numbers here. Mostly due to stray dogs that contract the virus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Melvin said slowly, shocked by that report to some degree, &quot;while conversion could cure someone of the disease, you&#39;ll need to understand that Animalians are not immune to the disease. All Mammal based Animalians get the vaccine and a mandatory booster every year, largely in relation to various state and local laws regarding the treatment of pets. We can arrange for the delivery of the vaccine to suit the colony... but if this is to go beyond that, it may well cost more, depending on the exact demand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it helps, it helps,&quot; the local representative spoke, &quot;particularly as my village has been hit hard by Covid. Many are getting better, but there are still complications.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melvin sighed heavily at that. While some numbers were starting go down in the US and in other places, that didn&#39;t mean that was indicative of things everywhere. He also remembered of the failures in vaccine distribution the previous year when it came to those outside the US, Europe, Australia, and Japan ultimately being part of what lead to some of the new variants that sparked massive case increases through the latter parts of 2021. It was something that tugged at his heartstrings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I can do what I can to see that conversions are available for those with Covid damage too,&quot; Melvin promised, &quot;though, if this then ends up being part of either building a colony city next to this village or turning it not the colony city... there will be other assorted costs with it. Anyone that becomes an Asian or Indian Elephant, whichever name you prefer, will grow in size and will need hosing with stronger floors. Anyone that becomes a Tiger Animalian would have to switch to a purely carnivorous diet, which may affect dietary requirements in your religions... unless the person&#39;s religion doesn&#39;t have those things. They&#39;re all things to consider. We can help pay for the upgrades... including water pipes and things like that, but they&#39;d still need to be considered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pipes?&quot; the local representative asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Many Mammalian Animalians have also shed fur over time and that has raised the risks of clogs in Lyre and Animalia,&quot; Melvin explained, &quot;this has required larger pipes for showers and sinks or providing a specialized filter to catch shed fur when bathing or washing dishes by hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable,&quot; one of India&#39;s diplomats spoke, &quot;and if you&#39;d help pay for that... I&#39;m sure that would be helpful for the local economy and people as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The bigger thing will be on how much the village might have to expand,&quot; said man who represented the agencies protecting India&#39;s habitat and wildlife, &quot;as some of the plans are wanting to build a sort of fort/palace that mimics the fort in Ranthambore for when the village here expands with either new Animalians coming in... people converting... and so on. We&#39;re for the project in general but given the ecological issues we&#39;re facing... not to mention the continued issues related to the decline of various animals in some parts of the country... we can&#39;t really afford something that would dramatically expand village to where we&#39;re ultimately taking away farmland from farmers and cattle breeders and wild land from leopards and deer in this particular area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melvin nodded and lifted up a briefcase and then opened it. He then passed a series of notes to the others at the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;These figures will show the land area that many of the homes in Lyre and Animalia occupy,&quot; Melvin explained, &quot;and this can include things ranging from modest dwellings to some mansions as well. That can then give you what you&#39;d need to know based on how many people might move here and how many might convert who are already here and so on. The land area for this &quot;fort,&quot; I cannot say... and if you are concerned on farming methods, I might be able to call some that are more familiar with farming practices in America. They might be of better help to you there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the ways that would make things more &quot;efficient&quot; is often too expensive for us,&quot; the local representative spoke, &quot;our people work hard and do their best, but the tools needed to grow more on &quot;less&quot; land are expensive and also carries the risk on putting others out of work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not all things will rely on technology,&quot; Melvin spoke.</p>
