<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty doesn't want to be big after all, so he wishes to change back.  He shrinks down to normal size, and decides he likes it better than being huge.  Ty brabbed a note pad, and pencil, and headed for his bed.<br />
<br />
Once he was on his bed, he started writing things down that he liked.  He came up with some items which he like, which were diapers, and baby items.  he wasn't sure why but loved that stuff.  he also loved girls,; how their bodies were; how they moved; and some of the clothes they wore, and the ways they were treated.  Most of all he thought vagina's and boobs were better than a penis.  Lastly, he loved tigers, and thought they were cool.  After thinking, Ty came up witha 3'0&quot; woman who wore diapers and other baby stuff, and was part tiger.<br />
<br />
Ty took his list and went over to the mirror, and started to strip, until he was completely naked.  Standing there he wished that he was 3 feet tall, and weighed what a 3 foot tall person would weigh.  He watched as the changes happened.  He then closed his eyes and wished that he was a 15 year old girl but still 3'0&quot;.  He didn't feel much until his brown hair hit his shoulders, his chest became extra sensitive as his chest ballooned out to B-cup breasts, and his body let out a squeal of pleasure as his vagina formed and his penis and testicles sucked inward.  He waited a few seconds and opened his eyes.<br />
<br />
When his eyes opened, he found he certainly wasn't a he anymore, but a she.  She looked quite differently as a she than a he, and viewed herself as very cute from a guy's perspective.<br />
<br />
Before she made more changes, she wanted to explore her 'new' body, and have at least one orgasm before she planned to do what she wanted to do.  Ty walked over to the bed noticing how it felt to walk; hips swaying more, no penis bouncing up and down, but instead her new boobs were bouncing.<br />
<br />
She crawled onto the bed, and ran her hands over her butt feeling the difference.  Her butt felt rounder than her old male butt.  She then rolled on her back, and rubbed her belly noticing the difference and moved up to her chest.<br />
<br />
When she was rubbing her belly, her knees were bent, but when her hands reached her chest, they straightened out really fast.  They were so sensitive, she thought, and that feeling between her legs.  She then felt the new sensation of 'wetness' between her legs of being turned on.  For the next few minutes she rubbed her boobs and masturbated with her free hand.  The entire time she was moaning.  Then the sparks in her eyes happened and she had the most pleasant ex experience of her life as she orgasmed.<br />
<br />
She lay there thinking as she was breathing hard.  She hopped up out of bed, her boobs bouncing a little bit, and her hands cupped them to stop the bouncing.  She walked over to the mirror, and let go of her boobs.  Now that she had her first and probably only orgasm for a long while she was ready for more changes.<br />
<br />
She crossed girl off her list, and saw she had baby and tiger left.  Next she wished that she was part tigress, so this way she was more unique than everybody else.  She imagined her whole body, except around her butt crack, crotch (especially her vaginal area) and boobs, were covered in tiger fur.  She didn't want a tail because it would get in the way of things.  Next she imagined the ears on her head moving up to the top of her head.  Lastly, she imagined her mouth and nose pulling out from the face a little bit more, and become more cat like.  She looked into the mirror, and was satisfied with the short tigress that she saw, so she crossed tiger off of her list.<br />
<br />
Now for the baby side of her new life.  she wanted a life where she had no responsibilities, and was taken care of.  The first change was going to be, she wished she was wearing diapers because she needed to.  Within seconds she was wearing a slightly larger than normal babies diaper.  She rubbed her diaper and felt how nice it felt against her butt and new crotch.  She smiled at this, then wished that her whole room was nurser for her, filled with 'baby-girl' clothes made to fit her, and watched as the changes took place.  She also wished that she had all the other necessities that a baby would need, such as a playpen, stroller, highchair, car seat, and baby foods.<br />
<br />
Next she wished that people accepted her cat like form, and that her name was Taylor, but went by Taytums, or Tayters.<br />
<br />
Taylor walked over to her crib noticing the waddle and crinkle from her diaper, and the comfyness after she sat down in the crib.  She pulled the side of the railing to the crib and wished that it was 8:00 in the morning.<br />
<br />
Then...</p>
