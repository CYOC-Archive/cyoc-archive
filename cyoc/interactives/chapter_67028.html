<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan turned and quiet walked back up the trail heading back toward Carter's house.  He figured he would <br />
transform himself back into a jockstrap on one of the pickets of Carter's fence, as if he had changed back <br />
last night while climbing over the fence. Still he was getting a bit tired of just hugging a guy's balls, <br />
maybe he'd change into those spandex trunks Carter liked to wear only in Vinnie's size. That would be nice and <br />
tight and he'd have a good grip on his wearer's manhood and ass.<br />
<br />
He paused behind the bushes near Carter's house. Someone was in the yard. He peered through the bushes and saw <br />
Carter's half brother Steve. Steve was shirtless, sweaty and dirty with lawn equipment at his feet. He was <br />
talking on his iPhone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, Jack, I'd love to come over to race you, but I left my competition suits at college.  I didn't think <br />
I'd need them this weekend.  Well, maybe? I don't know if my bro has a Speedo, but if he does, I'll borrow it <br />
and be at the muni pool in a half hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bingo, thought Ryan.  He slipped around the far side of Carter's house.  As he did, he saw Vinnie, Carter and <br />
Horst farther up the street engrossed in conversation.  When he had left Carter's house last night, he had <br />
gone out the back way through the laundry room.  Carter hadn't seen him leave, only heard him. So he could <br />
turn himself into a Speedo right by the door. He had already decided he would say O/S for his size, but he'd <br />
be Vinnie's size- maybe a tad smaller. He grinned wickedly. He shucked off his shorts and shoes and hid them <br />
in the wood bin by the house. Then he concentrated. He had barely changed when Steve came around the corner. <br />
The 22 year old's shoe caught on Ryan, and he picked up the metallic black and silver Speedo.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang, you must have caught on my foot when I came out the door,&quot; Steve said, &quot;Don't know how I missed you.&quot; <br />
He shook the grass off the Speedo and inspected it. &quot;Practically new,&quot; he apprised, &quot;Bit small, but you'll do <br />
nicely.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks, thought Ryan. Then he thought, now put me on.<br />
<br />
Steve was six foot six, with a swimmer's build.  His blonde hair was cut really short, and he seemed to have <br />
no body hair. Ryan was sure he shaved it for swimming. Steve dropped trou, and peeled off his sweaty white <br />
briefs. Ryan was surprised to discover that unlike Carter, Steve was circumcised.  Ryan was already imagining <br />
how he could adjust his liner to become a sort of artificial foreskin for Steve.<br />
<br />
Just as Steve pulled up his pants, Ryan's three school mate's rounded the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Steve, changing outside?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just borrowing your Speedo.  I've got a date to race at the Muni Pool.  You in and your buds are welcome to <br />
come and watch me demonstrate how an Olympian does it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not on the team yet, bro. Hey, were you in my room?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, you need to learn to put your clothes in the hamper. I found your Speedo on the step, it must have <br />
gotten tracked out here from the laundry room on somebody's shoes,&quot; Steve said. He pulled on his shirt and <br />
headed for his motorcycle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bro, you stink. You should really shower first,&quot; Carter said.  He and the others immediately realized that <br />
Ryan hadn't made it home last night.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll shower at the muni,&quot; Steve said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure I didn't leave my Speedo on the floor. Tell me how you got it again!&quot; Carter pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, I didn't go in your bedroom. It was funny I was thinking I needed to borrow your Speedo, and then I <br />
discovered it hooked on my shoe. Now I gotta go.&quot;<br />
<br />
VROOM. <br />
<br />
The motorcycle sped away.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Ryan didn't make it home last night,&quot; Horst said, &quot;I guess your cum only turned him human for a few <br />
minutes, he must have changed back into - hey, wait he's not a jockstrap any more!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.  I read something about this type of spell. Ryan probably was a jockstrap when your brother stepped on <br />
him, but since your brother wanted a Speedo, Ryan became one. The only reason he became my jockstrap was <br />
because I wanted him to be it. Maybe it wasn't even your cum that changed him, Carter.  Maybe you wanted Ryan <br />
to be human so much that he became human, but when he got out of range of your mind, he changed back to his <br />
new default - a jockstrap.  I wonder if he'll change back into a jockstrap when your brother takes him off?  <br />
Or if he will stay a Speedo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Takes him off!  Damn, Steve's going to race with Ryan on!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Steve and his buddies always bet their suits. The losers go home commando, and the winner keeps the losers' <br />
Speedos. Steve talks big, and he's a really good swimmer, but he's not the best. He's always losing his suits. <br />
That's why he had to borrow mine,&quot; Carter explained in a panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's get to the muni,&quot; Vinnie said.<br />
<br />
Horst had been silent for a while.  Finally, he asked Carter, &quot;So when Ryan changed back he had your boner <br />
buried up his ass, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Carter replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it seems he becomes whatever his wearer wants. So you wanted Ryan to ride your boner?&quot; Horst asked.<br />
<br />
Carter's jaw dropped.  That was exactly what he was imagining when he blew his load into the jockstrap and it <br />
became Ryan, but he couldn't tell anybody that.</p>
