<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hey Allen, do you have a camera?” Peter asked his buddy.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, let me go get it right now!” Allen replied, as he walked over to his desk drawer. He pulled out a little digital camera. He ripped open a pack of new AA batteries, and replaced the old batteries on the bottom of the small device, before handing it over to Peter.<br />
<br />
“Hey… What… What’s the camera for?” Tim wondered. “Who are you gonna take a picture of?”<br />
<br />
Peter walked up to Tim and rested his hand on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Hey, dude! Allen’s in training right now, to become a Wizard just like me and Ty!”<br />
<br />
“But… I thought he was able to change just the two of us already?” Tim responded.<br />
<br />
“Yeah! Well, I passed on my powers to Allen so that he can use us to complete his training. Once he passes this test, I’ll receive new powers.” Peter explained to him.<br />
<br />
“Allen has your powers?” Tim said, as his mouth dropped wide open. “That makes him pretty strong, doesn’t it?”<br />
<br />
“That makes you two guys the subjects of all my transformations for the time being, until Prince says I’ve passed the tests! So, without further delay…” Allen chuckled, as he looked on at Tim, who seemed to be quite shocked after hearing the news.<br />
<br />
Allen stared at Peter and Tim, who were standing next to each other.<br />
<br />
“Uh oh! Here comes….” Peter said, as he braced himself for another transformation.<br />
<br />
“No, don’t worry, Peter!” Allen replied. “I’ve changed you enough for today. It’s Tim’s turn now!” Allen concentrated on Tim.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Tim began to feel something as his body slowly began to rise up. He was growing taller!<br />
<br />
“Hey! What’s going on? What are you doing?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, Tim!” Peter grinned. “You’re turning into the new Superman!”<br />
<br />
“Say what?”<br />
<br />
Tim was a skinny guy with short, brown hair and brown eyes. He wasn’t very muscular or anything. But, he wasn’t fat either. He was only 5ft 8 inches tall, so Allen decided to make him taller!<br />
<br />
Tim’s legs continued to grow longer, pushing Tim’s head further from the ground. He was the shortest of the three boys, and now he was finding himself looking down at Peter and Allen as he continued to grow.<br />
<br />
Tim’s torso grew a little longer as well, and his legs and chest began to expand sideways a bit, making his shorts and his t-shirt feel somewhat tight. Allen decided to make Tim grow out of the clothes, since he was going to make him appear fully dressed in the new Superman uniform anyway!<br />
<br />
“Whoa! This is awesome!” Tim shouted, as he looked down at himself, noticing the changes. He was now 6 ft 8 inches tall! Allen had made him grow by a whole foot in just a few seconds.<br />
<br />
“Now, let’s add the muscles! I wanna make him as big as the new Superman ought to be, in my opinion! Get the camera ready, Peter!” Allen cheered, as he continued to focus his mighty powers on Tim.<br />
<br />
“Whoa! I’m way taller than you guys! Hey… What… What are you doing now?” Tim exclaimed, as he felt his legs thicken.<br />
<br />
His legs continued to swell! His shorts were becoming increasingly tight. In fact, they were just uncomfortable, as Tim’s legs continued to add layers of muscle to his quads and his caves. The bigger legs had forced Tim’s torso to grow wider, forcing the top button of his shorts to pop off! Next, the zipper completely unzipped, since the shorts were no longer able to contain the added muscles!<br />
<br />
“Hey! I’m busting out of my clothes!!!!!” Tim screamed, as he continued to grow.<br />
<br />
“You got that right, and I’m just getting warmed up!” Allen giggled. <br />
<br />
Tim’s shorts ribbed at the seams before falling to the ground. Tim only saw his briefs! Then he noticed how muscular his legs had become. They were long and muscular, with veins running across his mighty quads while he was also sporting a magnificent set of calves, which resembled balls of muscle, the size of full-size footballs, which were implanted into his legs. His legs were awesome!<br />
<br />
Next, Tim’s flat stomach began to take on a different look, as several rows of abdominal muscles began to cover the surface of what used to be a very flat tummy. Peter and Allen couldn’t see them first, because he was still wearing his white t-shirt. So, Allen decided to take care of that next!<br />
<br />
“Oh man! I’m getting huge!” Tim said, as he began to feel the changes in his torso and his chest.<br />
<br />
His pectorals began to expand like balloons, which had air blown into them. Layer upon layer of powerful muscle grew on his upper body, making his shoulders widen, pushing his arms out further away. Mighty pecs formed like spheres of basketballs, giving Tim a very muscular appearance!<br />
<br />
Next came the triceps, biceps, delts and lats. All those muscles expanded by several inches, making Tim seem wider and bigger. All this growth had made his t-shirt feel extremely uncomfortable!<br />
<br />
The top of the t-shirt, just below his neck, developed a tear, which grew longer as the t-shirt began to rip in two, starting at the collar and working down to his waist. He had just grown too big for the shirt!<br />
<br />
RRRIIPPPP! The shirt went, as it gave way to the increasing muscles on Tim’s body! Tim pulled the shirt off, revealing his amazingly muscular physique to his onlookers, who were delighted!<br />
<br />
“Now, THAT is Superman!” Peter cheered.<br />
<br />
“No, no… I’m not done yet!” Allen replied.<br />
<br />
“Come on, guys! I’m only wearing my red briefs! What am I gonna…. Whoa!!” Tim shouted, as his red briefs turned slightly darker in color.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a thick, blue fabric began to stretch across his muscular frame, covering his torso, stomach, pectorals, and slowly creeping down his arms, stopping at the wrists. As soon as the blue sleeves had formed, the fabric continued to creep down the other side, covering his muscular legs, until just below the ankles.<br />
<br />
Finally, burgundy colored boots formed over his lower legs, and a long, red cape formed from the shoulders, covering his back. The beautiful cape was draped from his shoulders, and it was hanging all the way down to his calves. The familiar “S” logo formed on his chest and on the back of his cape, and on the yellow belt buckle, which was fastened to his burgundy briefs.<br />
<br />
“Wow! I’m Superman!” Tim said, as he examined his body. He was tall and muscular, and he looked like a perfect model for the Man of Steel!<br />
<br />
“Now, take some pictures of him. We’ll take him outside, so we can get some cool shots of him, with his long cape billowing in the wind! Then we’ll email the photos to WB in Australia!” Allen chuckled. <br />
<br />
Peter and Allen walked out the front door, followed by Tim, who now looked like a great Superman, with muscles and costume!<br />
<br />
“Alright, Superman… Smile! Say ‘Kryptonite’!” Peter chuckled, as he took several shots of Tim, who was absolutely stunning as a perfect representation of Superman.<br />
<br />
Allen made Tim’s face look a bit older, and he changed his eyes to blue. He also made Tim’s brown hair black, giving him that perfect ‘Superman’ look.<br />
<br />
“Wow! He looks like the real thing!” Peter smirked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah! And the costume suits him really well. We may cause a stir, when they see these pictures in Australia!” Allen laughed, as he looked up at his handiwork.<br />
<br />
“Man… I’m kinda jealous…” Peter laughed, as he stared at the new Superman.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry! I’ll change you some more! Be patient…” Allen assured him.<br />
<br />
The three boys went back into Allen’s house, where they got on the computer and uploaded their photos. They picked out the best ones, and emailed them to the right people. And Allen allowed Tim to remain as Superman for the rest of the evening, until he found a new reason to change either Tim or Peter!</p>
