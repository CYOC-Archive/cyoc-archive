<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rest of the week went very quietly for Gloria and her friends. As promised, she visited Merlin the following day after school. Meeting the wizard at his shop Gloria was surprised by what he had to say. According to Merlin the Ring of Age possesssed a kind of inate intelligence within it. The ring, was able to observe and guide its holder into making decisions that it foresaw as having a positive outcome. Gloria also learned that the ring was also influenced by those that held it. Gloria learned that because the ring was possessed by people with good intentions that it would inherently try to make good choices. If the ring were to be held by someone with evil in their hearts though than it would use its power to create chaos and malice. Gloria thanked Merlin for his insight as she left for home, promising that her and her friends would see him again soon.<br />
<br />
As the week drew to a close Gloria found out her father was going on a business trip for the weekend. Jason had been invited to a prestigious architectural conference that would give him the opportunity to make contacts that could lead to bigger projects. Jason made the announcement early in the week and although Gloria was happy for her father, she could see a look of disappointment on Lisa’s face. As Jason left for the conference Friday morning Lisa sadly waved goodbye. <br />
<br />
“Mom what’s wrong,” she asked as her father drove out of sight. “Nothing,” Lisa said quickly. Gloria frowned as Lisa began to busy herself with her morning routine. “Cmon mom,” she said flatly. “You’ve been in a funk all week. What’s bugging you?”<br />
<br />
Lisa sighed as she finished making Gloria her lunch. “It’s stupid really,” she groaned. “I mean I know this shouldn’t be a big deal but...it turns out my sister Ann is coming to visit this weekend, and I’m really not looking forward to it.”<br />
<br />
Gloria nodded as she now thought of Lisa’s older sister Ann. Ann had been the middle child between Lisa and Katie’s mom. While Lisa had been the free spirited, loving woman Ann was a polar opposite. The 42 year old woman was a successful business woman who Gloria had only met on three occasions over the years. Gloria’s impressions of the woman told her that Ann wasn’t a social butterfly like her younger sister Lisa. Ann seems nice enough but just didn’t connect with children the way that Lisa did. Needless to say that whenever she did visit the atmosphere around the house was always tense as the two sisters seemed to take backhanded swipes at one another for the lives they choose to live.<br />
<br />
“Mom,” Gloria grinned. “It will be okay. I mean she is your sister after all. The visit will go fine and I’m sure it will give you a chance to catch up.”<br />
<br />
Lisa gave a short laugh as she shook her head. “Kinda doubt it kiddo,” she smirked. “Me and Ann just never saw eye to eye. Even when we were kids she was always more interested in studying and work than actually being a kid.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds a little like Jackie,” <br />
<br />
Lisa and Gloria laughed as she hustled Gloria off towards the bus. “Trust me Jackie is much better,” Lisa said warmly. “Have a great day at school, I’ll see you when you get home.” Gloria waved goodbye as she ran towards the bus stop.<br />
<br />
The day passed for Gloria without incident and as she exited the bus with her friends she began heading to her house. Seeing an unfamiliar car in the driveway Gloria assumed Ann must be there now. “Got run guys I’ll call you later,” she said. Gloria’s friends waved goodbye as she ran into her home. As she entered she could see her mom and her sister sitting on the couch.<br />
<br />
Ann, unlike Lisa, had blonde hair that went to her shoulders. Although Gloria thought the woman was pretty she realized that Lisa was obviously the looker in the family. Ann also appeared to have come straight from the office as she wore a business jacket with a dark skirt and sensible heels. Turning towards the front door Ann smiled as Gloria entered the house. “Wow Gloria great to see you,” she smiled, revealing some faint lines around her eyes and mouth. “Lisa and I were just catching up.”<br />
<br />
Gloria waved politely as Ann approached, giving her adopted niece a gentle pat on the shoulder. “Goodness have you grown since the summer,” she said. “You look like you’ve grown. Oh by the way how is eighth grade treating you?”<br />
<br />
“She’s in high school now Ann,” Lisa said flatly. Ann gave an exaggerated Wow as she studied Gloria. “Wow high school,” she said. “Goodness your growing up so quick. Have you been doing well in school? You know these are some of the most important times when deciding your future. I always was on your moms case when we were kids about studying hard, hopefully you have better study habits than she did.”<br />
<br />
Gloria giggled at Ann’s joke, causing Lisa to grit her teeth. “She’s almost top of her class Ann,” Lisa said tersely. Ann smiled as she turned back to look at her little sister. “That’s great to hear,” she said. “Hate to see her waste her future before it even begins.”<br />
<br />
“Like you think I did,” Lisa grumbled. <br />
<br />
Ann frowned as she turned back to apologize for Lisa’s comment. “Sorry about that,” she said to Gloria. “Your mom and I were just talking about life. I forgot that she has a bit of a temper sometimes and doesn’t like to take my advise.”<br />
<br />
Gloria nodded awkwardly as she saw Lisa’s face flush red. “In case you haven’t noticed Ann,” Lisa stated, narrowing her eyes. “I’m married now with two wonderful girls and have a successful design company with Kumiko, which reminds me, how’s your family life going?”<br />
<br />
Ann narrowed her eyes as she stared daggers at her sister who was smiling smugly. “Well being executive Vice President of a Fortune 500 company doesn’t give me a lot of free time Lisa,” she grumbled. “Especially being a woman, I’ve had to put in double the work of some of my peers to get ahead.”<br />
<br />
“Probably why I was made guardian of Katie,” Lisa said cruelly. <br />
<br />
“Now that’s not fair Lisa,” Ann yelled. “You know damn well I would of taken custody of Katie if her mom asked. Remeber I lost a sister too, you just love playing that pity card. She knew how much work I was doing. Guess she figured that since you weren’t doing much at the time you would have a lot more free time on your hands.”<br />
<br />
Gloria slowly backed away as the two sisters began arguing bitterly. “Geez,” she thought. “These two are acting like brats. Can’t believe sisters would actually treat each other like that.”<br />
<br />
As Gloria watched the two adults argue she felt a tingle emanate from her ring. As she looked down she saw it begin to glow. A look of panic crossed her face as she realized what the ring was about to do. “Now is not the time,” she whispered to the ring. “I know you think changing those two might help but I don’t know.” As Gloria pleaded with the ring she could hear a faint voice echo through her mind.<br />
<br />
“Trust me”<br />
<br />
Gloria now worriedly looked at Lisa and Ann, mowing exactly what was about to happen. As she watched she could already see signs of the two sisters impending regression. Ann appeared much fresher than only a moment ago, the fine lines around her mouth and eyes appeared to have vanished as she retreated through her thirties. Her blond hair also appeared more lively as the dullness of Age vanished, leaving it more healthy looking. Lisa also appeared fresher as she crept closer to 30. Lisa’s fiery red hair flowed slightly while her face appeared more youthful. Absentminded she began tugging on her jeans as she continued to argue with her sister.<br />
<br />
The two adult women were now only 29 and 32 as they continued to argue. It was finally Lisa who paused as she took a closer look at her sister. “Ann,” she gasped. Ann also paused as she studied her sisters face. “Lisa,” she said curiously. “Did...did you do something with your hair or something?”<br />
<br />
Lisa now stomped over to Gloria who was frozen with horror. “Gloria,” she said sternly as she becam 26. “You want to explain this?”<br />
<br />
“Mom it’s not me,” she said quickly. “The ring...it...it said to trust it, I...I think it’s trying to teach you and Ann a lesson or something.”<br />
<br />
Lisa looked down at the ring sighing before turning to face her sister. Ann gasped in shock as she stared at her sisters face. “Lisa ooh my god,” she exclaimed. “You...you look like a college kid!”<br />
<br />
Lisa carefully studied her sisters face sighing as she gazed at the young woman before her. “Yah your looking pretty young too Ann just look.” Curiously Ann walked towards the hallway mirror, screaming in shock as she saw herself at 24 years old once more. “Look at me,” she said breathlessly. “I look like a kid again. I can’t be more than 24. WAIT! I’m still changing! I’m...I’m 23....22..20! Lisa! We’re....we’re getting younger!!!”<br />
<br />
Lisa nodded solemnly as she now stood next to her sister, wincing at her teenage appearance. “Ugh I Look barely old enough to be out of high school,” she thought. “Yeah Ann it’s a long story,” she grumbled. “And it looks like it’s something I’m going to get to tell you about all weekend, just as soon as this stops. Which reminds me, Gloria? How young are we getting?”<br />
<br />
Gloria shrugged as she looked down at her ring. The ring told her to trust it yet she now worried just how young her mom and her aunt were going to become. As she gazed at the ring, she finally received an answer, one that she had a feeling neither woman wanted to hear.</p>
