<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was 8 PM and Scott Walker was exhausted. He had just finished his junior year at college and was babysitting his 5 year old nephew, Jimmy. His parents wouldn’t be back till Sunday, so Scott had to deal with him the entire weekend. He rubbed his eyes. The stress was killing him. Scott’s baseball season was just beginning. The ongoing pandemic of the age progression virus made things a little bit harder for the team overall. But on top of that, he needed to find a new player for his team soon or they couldn’t compete in the championship. He had asked around and had no luck. After today, all he wanted was some piece and quiet after practice and arguing with this kid was the last thing he wanted to do. “Jimmy, I don’t wanna do this, but you know the rules. 8 PM means bedtime!”, Scott spoke as he stared down at Jimmy in his onesie pajamas as he continued to pout and cross his arms, ignoring his orders completely. Scott gave up and sat on the couch. Jimmy got onto his knees and held onto Scott&#39;s legs. “Scotty, I wanna plaaay!” He whined and whined, until he suddenly didn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Scott, sitting there defeated, was curious why he stopped complaining. Jimmy then quietly began groaning. “Scotty? I don’t feel so good”. He glanced down at Jimmy and noticed him clutching his stomach with a deeply uncomfortable look upon his face. &quot;What&#39;s wrong now?&quot; He scoffed, guessing it was another one of his manipulative tactics to stay up later. Jimmy stood up to counter back. &quot;No, I mea-&quot; He froze. Scott sat there perplexed for a second. But then, seemingly out of nowhere, he watched as Jimmy began to grow. He began to get taller. His legs began to extend further up. His spine extending and straining as he quickly achieved Scott’s own height of 6&#8242;1. His shoulders slowly grew outward as his entire torso widened. &quot;Scotty?&quot; Jimmy looked over at Scott; loudly groaning and petrified in fear. His pajamas immediately began to strain on his expanding body. His tiny, size 4 feet almost instantly sprung outward, ripping his onesie from the bottom within seconds, becoming a size 14s. Jimmy was squealing like a pig from the agonizing pain as Scott stood and helplessly watched his little nephew in horror. His arms lengthened as his small hands grew; each finger slowly elongating. At his torso, each of the buttons from his pajamas popped off in unison; revealing the beginnings of a muscular chest. Both pectorals jutted out solidly as his biceps became harder, bulkier, and more defined. Abs began to take their shape on his stomach. At the same time, both of his legs exploded with massive amounts of muscle. His face began to look less like a child and more like a grown adult; his nose breaking and enlarging while his chin protruded forward and looked more square-like. <br />
<br />
As his body continued to age and gain muscle, Jimmy was screaming and sobbing uncontrollably. Sweat caked him from his head to his chest. The pain was unmanageable. Scott was in equal shock and awe from the situation. Here previously was a 5 year old boy that now stood what looked like an incredibly handsome, 25 year old man. The pain began to gradually diminish, except now Jimmy was being thrust through puberty at an alarming rate. Without warning, Jimmy’s squeals of terror dropped in pitch as his adam’s apple shot out of his thick neck; replacing his high tone with a deep, smooth baritone voice. His butt quickly gained mass and became a taut, jock ass. Jimmy’s echoing grunts intensified as Scott watched in horror as his baby penis rapidly expanded. “UGHHHHHHHGH SCOTTTY UGGGGGGH”. He roared with his now mature voice that oozed masculinity. His balls dropping and heaving while his newly formed 9 inch cock extruded from his strained kid pj&#39;s. Jimmy and Scott both stared at the overhanging organ and took in all its majesty. His cock then grew erect as Jimmy began to moan. Except this wasn’t out of pain, it was out of unrelenting pleasure. He began stroking it up and down, harder and harder, until a sticky, white substance erupted in large spurts from engorged penis. ‘UGH UGH UGHHHHHH” Jimmy was violently panting from his inaugural orgasm and all Scott could do was watch. His muscles quivering and straining. The slack jawed expression on his face gave it all away; he was enjoying this immensely. “Uhhh...uhhh...UHHHH...SSSScotty?...” Jimmy asked a dumbfounded Scott, still in shock and in the corner, while still moaning and ejaculating in front of him. “WHHAaa...WhHAaaaa.. Whhaat happened to meEEE?” “I’m not sure bud, but it does look like we might have a new player for the team.”</p>
