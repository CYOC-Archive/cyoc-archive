<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rising from the shoulders of the dark horse&#39;s body was a muscular man. He didn&#39;t wear much in the way of clothing, just two leather straps in a cross over his torso from which the sword and whip on his horse shoulders hung.<br />
His long dark hair was messy and wild, giving him an almost rockstar like quality.<br />
Ultimately though, it was his sheer size that was intimidating to Alec. A horse is already as tall as a human and this horse had a human half on top of it. The muscular man towered above him, his dark eyes boor into him with a mix of interest and suspicion.<br />
The centaur was obviously not intimidated by Alec, as he kept closing the distance until he was right before him.<br />
&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Alec. Thanks for coming over. Can I ask you a question?&quot; Was this the right way to address a centaur?<br />
&quot;Are you a human woman.&quot; The centaur said in a gruff voice.<br />
It took Alec some effort to hide his annoyance at having to be asked this. Why would he even think this? Other than huge tits, and a vagina the centaur couldn&#39;t see, he was clearly a man. &quot;No, I&#39;m a man. So, can you help me with something?&quot;<br />
The centaur remained silent and observed him.<br />
&quot;Humans are such strange creatures.&quot;<br />
&quot;I...can&#39;t argue with that.&quot; He wasn&#39;t really planning on doing in depth species discussions with the centaur, but he didn&#39;t want to ignore him either. &quot;So do you have a name I can address you with?&quot;<br />
&quot;Alem.&quot; The centaur replied. <br />
The creature&#39;s stare was starting to get on Alec&#39;s nerves. Was he eyeing his tits? &quot;Okay. Alem. Yes I&#39;m quite sure that I&#39;m not a woman. So can you help me out? I&#39;m traveling with two friends and we ran into a spot of bad luck and we need some help to travel.&quot;<br />
&quot;Why do you have breasts.&quot; <br />
&quot;I had a mishap with some frogs, it&#39;s just temporary.&quot; Something about this didn&#39;t feel right.<br />
&quot;Your friends. Where are they.&quot; It didn&#39;t sound as much as a question as more of a demand to Alec.<br />
&quot;They&#39;re a little while back in that direction.&quot; Alec pointed uncomfortably.<br />
&quot;What kind of help do you need.&quot; <br />
He hesitated Maybe centaurs were just incapable of asking questions? But good or bad intentions, he was going to have to say anyway. &quot;They&#39;re stuck and we need help to move them.&quot; <br />
Alem seemed to consider this. He looked over his shoulder and back at Alec. &quot;Are they also women?&quot; <br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m not a woman.&quot; <br />
Alem flashed a nasty smile. &quot;I shall judge this myself, you&#39;re mine wench!&quot; The centaur reared back on his hind legs and grabbed his whip from his hip. <br />
Clearly visible as the centaur reared back was it&#39;s erect member. It&#39;s huge black dick swung heavily between it&#39;s hind legs. <br />
Alec had no time to determine if he was insulted or flattered that the centaur appeared to be turned on by him, he jumped back and out of range as the centaur slammed it&#39;s hooves done on the ground. <br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to fight you!&quot; Alec warned him and drew his dagger.<br />
Alem reared back again and his whip flashed through the air and snapped next to Alec&#39;s head. <br />
&quot;Yield!&quot;<br />
&quot;Possession!&quot;<br />
<br />
The familiar light flashed and Alec found himself on his hind legs, staring far down at his own body. He lost his balance and fell to the ground, slamming down on his two front legs down as his own body slumped forward.<br />
He winced as he saw his body hit the ground. &quot;Please don&#39;t be dead.&quot; He mumbled to himself. <br />
He looked down at his new body. It was huge, the ground seemed so far away now it was nearly enough to give him vertigo. His large horse body stretched out behind him. He flicked his tail around, it felt familiar. Not unlike the feeling of the Nekomata tail, yet still different. Less direct.<br />
He looked at his bare muscular arms. Despite his lack of clothing, he didn&#39;t feel cold at all. Alem&#39;s whip hung limply from one of his hands. He made a fist in the other, Alem was strong. Not just in the horse end, but in the upper body as well. <br />
More annoyingly, he felt a familiar urge. His dick was aching. Aching badly.<br />
The body desperately wanted to get off.  Now as not the time, best he could, he tried to ignore it. He tried thinking of other things, cold showers, flowers, anything. Still it remained throbbing, begging for an attention it was not going to get. Finally it abated. He slowly felt the pressure deflate as it shrunk back between his legs. <br />
Slowly receding back into it&#39;s sheath, another new sensation.<br />
Now he really wanted to check out his own body. He looked down and was confused. How did horses walk? Does he just lift his left front leg first or something? He lifted his left front leg. That was easy, but now what? If he lifted his left back leg, would he topple to the side? Do his front right leg and end up in the horse&#39;s equivalent of a split? It felt so weird having to coordinate 4 legs. <br />
&quot;Dammit Alec, you&#39;re overthinking this!&quot; He scolded himself. <br />
He remembered his time in the Nekomata&#39;s body. When he thought about it, he would crash. The body knew what it had to do, he just needed to think what he wanted to do. And right now, that was simple. He wanted to inspect his own body.<br />
Alec slowly stepped forward and the horse half followed his command. He&#39;d ridden a horse once in his life, a long time ago. It didn&#39;t feel dissimilar actually. He felt his upper body move in rhythm with the lower body. <br />
Now to kneel so he could reach. <br />
He flailed his arms, fearing that he was going to fall off as the horse body lowered to it&#39;s knees, only to realize that there was no falling off. He checked his own body.</p>
