<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erika was having lunch at the cafeteria when it hit her. There was suddenly a mild tingling sensation in her breasts and she reached up to cup her hands around them. To her surprise, the mounds of flesh began to slowly expand in her hands, stretching her shirt. Her breasts began to strain against her b cup bra, a line of cleavage starting to form as the cups pressed her bourgeoning breasts together. <br />
<br />
“Wh-what’s happening?!” she cried out, the straps of her bra started to cut into her shoulders. They must have gone up a cup size already. She massaged at them and held back a moan. “They’re so...sensitive…”<br />
<br />
Her thighs were thickening and her hips widening, her ass starting to fill out until her skirt rode up over the curve. Her underwear was stretched tight over the cheeks of her inflating backside, threatening to tear apart at any second. Her hips stretched so far that the front button of her skirt popped off and flew across the room, her figure now a dramatic hourglass shape. She squeezed her legs together and whimpered, her pussy as sensitive as her breasts. <br />
<br />
Erika pinched her nipples between her fingers as her breasts expanded on her chest, swelling up past the cup sizes, threatening to snap her bra to pieces. She managed to remove her bra, her tits bouncing free inside her shirt, the mounds stretching the front fabric. Buttons threatening to pop off. Preoccupied with her new tits, she didn’t notice that her belly was slowly starting to expand outward. When she finally looked down, her shirt had ridden up over the curve of her gut, exposing her belly button. Buttons were being ripped and the first button pinged off like a bullet. Her panties went up her butt cheeks like a thong as her ass inflated. She placed her hand on it and found that it was firm, not squishy like fat. Her belly was bulging through the new opening in her skirt, making her almost look…<br />
<br />
“Pregnant?!” Erika cried out, just as her belly surged forward another inch, sending her falling back on her elbows. She could barely see over her new tits, now swelling to E cup size, but she would guess that she was looking around four months along. <br />
<br />
Erika thickened legs fell open as her belly grew, her head falling back as she moaned into the air. “It feels…so good…” she whined, resting one hand on her growing middle as her other hand pinched at her nipple. With a groan, her hips widened one more time, tearing her skirt down the sides. She pulled the clothing off until she was in nothing but her shirt and underwear, her belly now appearing around six months pregnant. <br />
<br />
What she didn&#39;t know was that by denying the salve knocking Emily up, by fighting it. She had lost it&#39;s power and it&#39;s protection. She had been the Alpha futa of her pack, now she was just a fat bitch like Melissa. The bulge in her belly and blouse fought a war. Button by button the shirt was ripped free. Her shirt was slowly riding upwards, exposing the tight pale skin underneath. The curve was growing before her very eyes, bulging out inch by inch, becoming tighter and fuller by the minute. <br />
<br />
Then, inside her, something moved. <br />
<br />
“Ohhh…I think…it’s kicking…” she moaned, spreading her legs in ecstasy. She couldn’t help herself: Erika reached down to stroke herself through her underwear, enjoying the rapid growth as it took over her body. Her belly was nearly at 8 months now, her bellybutton now popped outward on top of the pale mountain of flesh. Emily ran up to Erika.<br />
<br />
In minutes, her belly reached full term. But the growth didn’t stop there: it continued to expand until it was large enough to carry twins, then bulged until it could have carried triplets, and kept going. Their babies kicked and flipped inside Erika, so strong that their movements could be seen on the outside. One baby pressed into her side and she moaned in pleasure and pain, holding her hand up against where the foot or elbow was nudging into her. <br />
<br />
“How many did you put inside me?!” she cried out at Emily. <br />
<br />
“At least…three…” Emily guessed.<br />
<br />
Running her her hands over the expanse of her lover&#39;s belly, feeling the outlines of the babies inside. Erika&#39;s womb was running out of space, stretched into a large torpedo shape and beginning to bulge on the sides in order to accommodate the litter of babies growing there. It just about reached her knees, her bellybutton now stretched flat across her gut. She cradled it in her hands, rocking back and forth on the floor.<br />
<br />
“I feel like I’m gonna explode,” Erika moaned. “I can’t get any bigger, I’ll pop!”<br />
<br />
She fell onto her back, her womb high in the air and trembling with kicks and punches. “I’m…so pregnant…” <br />
<br />
She tried to catch her breaths, barely noticing that her growth had slowed to a near stop. Emily ran her fingers up the underside of Erika&#39;s belly, the sensation causing a shiver to run up her spine. She could feel that one of her babies was resting there, firm and heavy under her taut flesh. <br />
<br />
Emily cradled Erika&#39;s head on her lap, letting her look down. Erika reached around her belly as far as she could and moaned. “E-Emily…I think…something’s happening…” <br />
<br />
Erika could feel a shifting inside her. Her babies began to move, to flip around, until their heads were facing downward. Her belly warped grotesquely as the babies shifted, shaking so much that her entire body trembled. <br />
“I’m gonna…I’m gonna pop…” she groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get a doctor!&quot; Emily shouted at the staff and students staring at a suddenly pregnant teen giving birth in their school. <br />
<br />
Whatever Erika was about to give birth to her secret was out...</p>
