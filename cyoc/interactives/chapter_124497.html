<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Sure, I&#39;ll help you.&quot;  Said Judy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;  Jim asked, looking up to his giant sister (to his perspective) with a hopeful expression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really really.&quot;  Judy said back down to him with a reassuring grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, I will owe you one after I become my normal size again.&quot;  Jim said to her in relief.  Judy then examined the balloon again.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, all I have to do is blow this up?&quot;  Judy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it is already set so blowing it up will make me grow back, then once I am back to normal size you just say &quot;release&quot; and I won&#39;t shrink anymore.&quot;  Jim answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, if you say so.&quot;  She said.  &quot;But before I grow you back, you don&#39;t mind if I test this a few times?&quot;  Judy asked.  Jim gave her an annoyed look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Judy,&quot;  Jim began, annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim, I will grow you back I promise, but I want to see how this works.&quot;  She said down to him, slightly exasperated.  Jim gave a resigned sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, but you better grow me back to my normal size after.&quot;  Jim said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I promised didn&#39;t I.&quot;  She said to him before bringing the balloon close to her lips.  &quot;Just a few breaths.&quot;  She said then blew into the balloon.<br />
<br />
Jim watched as his perspective rose grew in size with each breath is sister blew.  She stopped after a few breaths and Jim took the time to look around a bit.  At first he was small enough to walk under his bed without ducking, but now, while still small, he was big enough to have to get on his knees and crawl to get under the bed.  Jim then looked up to his sister and saw that she now seemed only half as big as she was before.  Jim guessed that he was now about 12 inches tall, which meant he was no longer in danger of being stepped on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, this balloon really does work.&quot;  She said in awe and wonder when she looked down at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I almost could not believe it myself.&quot;  He said to her.  &quot;Now are you done yet?&quot;  He asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not quite.&quot;  She says to him, leaving him slightly annoyed.  &quot;So if blowing this up grows you, then letting the air out....&quot;  She began, and then let the air out of the balloon.  Jim nearly panicked when his world suddenly expanded around him, leaving everything huge again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Judy!&quot;  Jim exclaimed in indignation at having shrunk back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I just had to see that worked.&quot;  Judy said, slightly amused.  She then grew Jim back up a bit and watched him shrink a few times more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, you saw how it works, can I be my normal size again?&quot;  Jim asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, fine, you&#39;re so impatient, I was just curious.&quot;  She answered and grew him back to 12 inches before stopping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Judy,” Jim groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry; this one&#39;s for real this time.&quot;  She said and she stood up to her feet, leaving Jim intimidated.  While he was not as small as before, in Jim&#39;s perspective Judy still seemed around 2 stories tall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, here we go.&quot;  She said and blew into the balloon.  &#39;Finally!&#39;  Jim thought in relief as his perspective rose with each breath.  After a few breaths from Judy, he reached her knee, a couple of breaths more he reaches her hips; but as he became larger Jim became more aware of that he was naked in front of Judy and covered his crotch with his hands.  Then, when he became eye level to her belly button, she stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, why did you stop?&quot;  Jim demanded, &quot;I’m still to short!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cloths,&quot; Judy said, gesturing at Jim’s discarded cloths on the floor.<br />
<br />
“But they’re too big to fit me.”  Jim said.<br />
<br />
“They won’t be if you were to grow back into them, I think I’m done with seeing you naked.”  Judy replied.<br />
<br />
“Oh, why didn’t you just say so?”  Jim said in understanding.  He then went over to his shirt on the ground, taking note of how large it seemed compared to him, and slipped it on.  He could not help but feel rather comical; the normally short sleeves engulfed his arms past his elbows and the hem of the shirt hung slightly below his knees.<br />
<br />
“What do I do about my shorts though?”  Jim asked, looking at his “too large” shorts on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Just step into your shorts and underwear and hold them up to your waist.”  Judy replied to him.  Jim then went over to his shorts and underwear on the floor, stepped into the legs and lifted both up to his waist.  Once again he felt comical as he had to lift his shirt to hold his shorts and underwear up, plus his shorts and underwear felt heavier than he was used to.<br />
“Okay, I’m ready.”  He said, Judy resumed blowing up the balloon.  Jim rose higher and higher with each breath, his “too large” cloths shifting on him as he grew and becoming more fitting with each breath.  After a couple of breaths he was shoulder height to his sister, a few breaths more and he no longer needed to hold his shorts up as they were now the same height, which is when she stopped again.<br />
<br />
“Judy.”  Jim started, slightly annoyed.  His cloths still felt a little loose.<br />
<br />
“I guess we do see eye to eye at times.”  She said, smirking at her pun.  “But this is not quite you yet, just one more breath.”  She said and blew once more into the balloon, causing Jim to rise a few more inches and reach his original height, his cloths now fitting as he remembered.  “Hmm, this looks just about right, and release.”  Judy said, letting all the air out of the balloon, which Jim did not shrink to.<br />
<br />
“Finally, I thought I was going to be stuck like that.”  Jim said, relieved to be at normal size.<br />
<br />
“Glad to be of help.”  Said Judy who was still holding on to the balloon.<br />
<br />
“Judy, I have to ask, you could have easily taken advantage of me while I was shrunk.  Why didn’t you?”  Jim asked.  Judy gave a look of guilt.<br />
<br />
“To be honest, the thought did cross my mind.  She admitted.  “But after seeing you scared and utterly helpless like that, the thought of taking advantage of you felt…sickening.”  She said.<br />
<br />
“Well, thank God for small mercies.”  Jim said. Then Judy examined at the balloon again.<br />
<br />
“Hey, I wonder how much fun we could have with this.”  She said, holding the balloon up.  Jim looked skeptical.<br />
<br />
“You’re not doing to use the balloon to take advantage of me are you?”  He asked warily.<br />
<br />
“After helping you out and you don’t trust me?”  She asked, feigning hurt.<br />
<br />
“Just asking.”  Jim replied.<br />
<br />
“Okay, how about this then.”  She began.  “We only use this balloon for fun and we do not take advantage of the other unless we need help.”  She suggested.<br />
<br />
“Okay, that sounds fair.”  Jim agreed.<br />
<br />
“So how does this balloon work?”  Judy asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, you can change things with the balloon such as height, weight or age by saying “control” and stating what you want to change.”  Jim said.<br />
<br />
“So like before you got bigger when I blew up the balloon and you got smaller when I let the air out.”  Judy asked.<br />
<br />
“Exactly.”  Jim answered.<br />
<br />
“So what should we try.”  Judy asked.</p>
