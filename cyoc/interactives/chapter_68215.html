<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Whoa! What was that?&quot; Darius said to the warlock.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was my way of giving you a gift. Through magic.&quot; the warlock replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well where is it?&quot; Darius asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it's not that kind of gift,&quot; the warlock answered.<br />
<br />
Darius felt this strange sensation in his muscles. This must be his gift. He felt his muscles tingle all over. Then suddenly, as it had begun, the tingling stopped. Darius felt slightly dizzy and almost sick to his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! Whatever you did to me, I don't feel so good...&quot; Darius said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The gift I gave you was kindness,&quot; the warlock spoke, finally. &quot;Though that is not how my magic works completely. This is not just a gift but can also be a curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darius laughed at the 'so-called' warlock. &quot;You're crazy man, first you say it's a gift, now a curse? What’s next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is both actually,&quot; the warlock answered. &quot;You must show kindness to people in your actions, your words, and your thoughts. That also means you will no longer be conceited as you have been in the past. Each time you can not show kindness, your body will slowly be drained of those hard earned muscles of yours. Showing kindness can bring that muscle back, though not at the same rate. You will have to try harder to earn it back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say man,&quot; Darius said. &quot;Look, I don't have time for this, there are lots of guys here that are just waiting to have some fun with this muscle god!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I warned you,&quot; the warlock talked back.<br />
<br />
With that, the warlock walked away from Darius and disappeared into the crowd. Darius felt a stronger tingling sensation now in his muscles. This time the sensation lasted longer. He felt like it wasn't about to end. Something weird is happening to him. The sensation went away, and he had that dizzy, sick feeling again.<br />
<br />
What Darius didn't know, was that every time he felt this way, his muscles shrank a little. His tight, cut-off muscle tee started looking a little less tight. His abs and back that were visible didn't look as impressive as they were. Though they were still impressive enough to keep the guys looking. His thick legs, which his shorts had barely fit on before were now a little slimmer, and the shorts were also not quite as tight. Not enough for him to notice quite yet.<br />
<br />
Darius headed to the restroom. Maybe he could find a guy in there to take his mind off of the whole warlock thing. As he walked into the restroom, he noticed the guy that was in there earlier who had stared at him was there again. Something looked different about him. Something else caught his eye. Each person here tonight was given a sticker to put somewhere on themselves depending on if they were a &quot;jockey&quot;, &quot;stallion&quot;, or &quot;centaur&quot;. Darius was obviously a &quot;jockey&quot;, so this made things nice and easy. The green-eyed guy's sticker said &quot;stallion&quot;.<br />
<br />
Darius went to the urinal stall next to that guy, and once again stepped back &quot;accidentally&quot; early, so the guy could get another look. Something was off though. The guy had looked, glanced rather, and then looked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was odd...&quot; Darius thought.<br />
<br />
The guy then exited the restroom, and Darius was left there alone. He finished up and headed to the sink to wash his hands. Something strange caught his eye. Actually in the reflection of the mirror. His reflection!<br />
<br />
It looked like him alright, but something was off. Darius shrugged it off, and washed his hands. Then he noticed something else different. The sticker on his shirt, was not the one he was given at the beginning of the night. No wonder the guy just glanced at him. He saw the sticker and noticed they were the same. Yes, Darius' sticker now said &quot;stallion&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;It must have been that stupid warlock guy!&quot; Darius talked to himself in the empty restroom. &quot;He probably swapped the stickers in that blinding light. What a joke.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, suddenly that tingling sensation came back. Stronger than ever now. His muscles once again tingled all over. His body was almost getting goose bumps this time! Then something else caught his eye in the mirror. Were his muscles getting smaller?<br />
<br />
They were! Darius was in a panic. &quot;This must have been what the warlock meant...&quot;<br />
<br />
His arms deflated more and more. Now they looked like they had when he first started working out. The definition of his abs and back faded slightly some more. Then his legs became skinnier, and looked like they had when he first started working out! His clothing hung slightly on him now. He still looked good when he had started working out, but no where near what he once was. The shorts hung loosely on his waist, exposing his underwear slightly.<br />
<br />
Darius needed to find that warlock and convince him to get rid of this horrible curse.</p>
