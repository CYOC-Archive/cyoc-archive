<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Authors note: Title chapter is a song from the band Queen<br />
<br />
Jose knew it was only a matter of time before the dogs caught to him; hearing the braying and barking behind him as he ran deeper into the woods surrounding Moon Lake. He silently swore when he ran in to clearing earlier; seeing the town’s namesake gleaming in the waning moon light, Jose knew he somehow got turned around. Instead of fleeing away from the town after ditching his vehicle; Jose managed to run right back into it.<br />
“Well isn’t this a fucking treat,” Jose muttering to himself; “if those dogs behind me don’t get me, this town’s maddening layout will.”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
“All units! All units! Subject has reached the lake. K9 squad to maintain cover as everyone else takes up position.”<br />
Brooke Reeds, an FBI agent and a werewolf, overheard the whispered communique on radio. Knowing that the K9 squad was close to the suspect; yet keeping their distance. The squad in question was a group of were-dog deputies, led by a black furred were-poodle. Leading the suspect, or in this case herding him to a group of deputies not in their fursona; all armed with stun guns. They like sheriff Cooper were determined to capture this would be assassin; more so over the death of a fellow officer.<br />
<br />
“Shots Fired! Shots fired!”<br />
Agent Reeds radio crackles with the dreaded message just as she hears the load pops going off in the distance. Racing to the scene and blowing past the K9 unit as they looked like they were ready to break cover and rush to the defense of their fellow comrades. Covering the distance from where she stood to where the waiting deputies laid out their ambush; Agents Reeds is treated to an assuring scene of seeing the suspect writhing around on the ground in pain as several prong from various stun guns dug into his skin.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Moment earlier<br />
Gasping as that last growl he heard sounded closer than expected; Jose had no idea that one of the were-dog deputies was only a few feet from him. If Jose was a were-beast himself, he might have been able to sniff out the deputy; or even see him in the dark woods. Instead, he swears as he stumbles through the thickets and is greeted to a sight that makes him sick to his stomach.<br />
<br />
In front of Jose waiting for him to emerge from the woods, is roughly twenty deputies all armed and pointing a weapon at him. Reacting first before they had a chance to warn him; Jose raises his gun and discharges a few rounds.<br />
<br />
POP! POP! POP!<br />
<br />
Thinking it was best to go down swinging; Jose feels a sudden jolt hit him. Then another and another; soon a fourth, as the stun guns make contact and discharge their almost deadly current into him. Unable to remain standing, Jose is soon on the ground writhing in pain as the deputies that hit him, slowly approach; ready to send another current of electricity through their guns if required.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Brook Reeds stared at the still twitching man as the prior electrical currents are still scrambling his nerves. Getting a good look at the person for the first time; Brook sees that he is a Caucasian man, trying to pass himself off as a Latino with greasy hair. Watching as a deputy approaches to cuff the man; Brook’s nose wrinkles in disgust as well as every other deputy nearby.<br />
“Gods did he just shit himself,” a deputy could be heard remarking the foul smell.<br />
“Smells like it,” Agent Reed answering; “not surprised, what with the man’s convulsing after getting tazed.”<br />
“Paramedics are going to love that as they check him out,” another deputy helping to roll the man over; “you taking custody of him Agent Reed?”<br />
“Once he has been medically cleared,” Agent Reed answering; “and he doesn’t stink like….”<br />
“Sorry,” the deputy chuckling; “we aren’t bathing him for you. But you can give that pleasure to those where you are taking him.”<br />
“Funny,” Agent Reed shaking her head; “someone radio the sheriff. He will want the good news,” Agent Reed heading upwind of Jose’s malodorous odor; “and tell the K9 squad to stand down. Oh,” Agent reed adding; “did anyone get wounded from the suspects gun fire?”<br />
“Unless you count a few birch trees,” a deputy finishing up handcuffing Jose; “because none of us got hurt. This man’s aim was as wild and chaotic as his attempt to flee on foot.”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Back at the road block where Sheriff Cooper was at; forced to make an impromptu press conference as he moments ago just got word from his deputies of Jose’s capture.<br />
“Will the man be heading to your local jail,” a reporter could be heard shouting.<br />
“No,” Sheriff Cooper responding; “as an officer was killed in a court house, this became a federal matter. With the FBI already in town; here to take custody of Frederick Parker, they will take custody of the would-be assassin.”<br />
“Is there an update on Frederick Parker,” another reporter shouting; all eager to report on any scrap of news regarding the California mobster that came to a small town in Seattle in convoluted attempt to break his son out of jail.<br />
“Apart from the man in a medically induced coma,” Sheriff Cooper repeating what he said earlier; “Frederick’s status is still unchanged. He was shot and nearly succumbed from his wounds. What I do know,” Sheriff Cooper looking serious as several cameras flash in his face; “is that once Frederick’s condition stabilizes, he will be transferred to a more secured facility as he recovers from his injuries while facing trial for the crimes he committed here. Most likely he will be at the prison hospital ward in Seattle’s county lock up.”<br />
<br />
Ignoring the rest of the reporters and their questions, Sheriff Cooper walks to a nearby police cruiser. Getting into the driver’s seat; taking a breath and making sure the doors to the cruiser are locked, Sheriff Cooper makes a phone call.<br />
<br />
“Tachibana,” Sheriff Cooper speaking through his phone; “just so you don’t hear the news on television first, we got the assassin. He is in custody.”<br />
“Has he talked,” Tachibana responding; “has the man tried to make a deal?”<br />
“I can’t answer that,” Sheriff Cooper answering; “what I was told was that he got hit by four Tasers upon apprehension and as a result, his bowels let loose. Agent reed is taking custody of the man and will transport him to the county lock up.”<br />
“It’s better than nothing I guess,” Tachibana sighing over the phone; “have agent Reed keep me in the loop. If this man was hired by Jack Crawford…”<br />
“I’m aware of the precarious situation we all are in,” Sheriff Cooper interrupting; knowing full well that Jack threatened to expose the existence of were’s the world over he was arrested or made to answer for his supposed crimes to the Elder council. “But I’ll let Agent Reed know you want to talk to her,” Sheriff Cooper continuing; “however her availability may be limited, dealing with Frederick Parker, his son Daniel and this assassin and the same reporters infesting our town… Agent Reed’s dance card is full at the moment.”<br />
“Hopefully,” Tachibana sounding wistful; “the reporters will follow the story as it is being driven to Seattle.”<br />
“I hope so too,” Sheriff Cooper answering; “now that this crisis is over, I’m heading home. To my fiancé and nephew,” Sheriff Cooper adding with an air of finality.<br />
“Have a good evening then Sheriff,” Tachibana acknowledging; “and pleasant dreams.”<br />
“I just might come in work late tomorrow,” Sheriff Cooper talking to himself after hanging up; “Joan will want to keep in bed as long as possible. Not something I’m going to complain about,” Sheriff Cooper smiling as he starts up the cruiser and drives home.</p>
