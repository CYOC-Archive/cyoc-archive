<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Penny was thunder stuck by her chief's reaction but managed to hold onto herself, &quot;I.. that <br />
is.. remember how your grandfather was turned into a teapot and sold on the market by a <br />
the pack member Jesse? I realized that if my power could restore Kirk and the others, than <br />
it could restore him too! He's alive chief! He's alive!&quot; <br />
<br />
Gillie felt her brain nearly snap in two, driven between hugging Penny with tears of joy, and <br />
strangling an unarmed woman in a wheelchair!  <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
1681 <br />
<br />
&quot;So how are you guys doing?&quot; Marie laid back on the bed in what resembled a small four <br />
person bedroom. Mutt played with a cat on the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Very well thank you.&quot; Said Gita, convinced her experiments concerning the lion cub Rosa <br />
were a success since after a year the girl had shown no signs of aging. But Lilith had <br />
warned her that if all the children in town stopped aging all together at once that the evil <br />
adults would get suspicious. <br />
<br />
That Rosa was suffering teasing from her litter mates that she had stopped growing and <br />
was going to be a dwarf hadn't even registered in Gita's brain. <br />
<br />
Of course, by now, Gita was seventeen, practically a young woman. Goldwyn was sixteen <br />
like Marie and Griselle was fifteen. <br />
<br />
Of course, Gita absolutely refused to acknowledge even remotely they could possible be <br />
'one of them!' <br />
<br />
Even since that horrid nightmare years ago, Marie and the witchlings had not spoken about <br />
it once, fully convinced it had simply been a 'bad future' as Herodias described it where <br />
they friends had turned evil. <br />
<br />
It would be four more years before Marie Cruz realized the full truth, and the three little <br />
girls would forever be lost and be the monsters that the people of Glendale would know <br />
them as. <br />
<br />
Marie off handedly mentioned 'Jack'.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...wait...&quot; Said Betty breathlessly, &quot;So, Marie Cruz accidently created Jack The Ripper?&quot;<br />
<br />
The fact that the ripper might have been a european branch of the wolf pack was another <br />
matter. <br />
<br />
&quot;The name of the killer was never actually 'Jack.' &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whose Jack The ripper?&quot; Lilly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A very bad person you don't need to know about.&quot; Maddex's two heads said, &quot;And don' <br />
worry, that wolf wasn't related to us just cause he had deep black fur, Zackery and Alpha <br />
Jensen have the same colored fur and aren't related.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Charcoal black.&quot; Betty corrected. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Zackery's fur is charcoal black, Jensen and Jenny's fur is midnight black.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right, I forget.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you forget thing like that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I meant Yomato and Amy have similar colored fur and aren't related.&quot; The DNA <br />
testing had been quite conclusive, June even wondered if she had a Japanese ancestor she <br />
didn't know about. <br />
<br />
Glass Marie nodded at that &quot;Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz and the girls chattered about this and that, and what was what. Neither ever <br />
mentioned precisely where they lived, almost as if they subconsciously held it back. <br />
<br />
Marie mentioned girls who would never stop gossiping, and the witchlings mentioned <br />
adults who wouldn't shut up. <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz awoke from her friendly chat to find herself in the carriage that was taking her <br />
the final stretch back to the Vatican after her months of travel across Europe. <br />
<br />
Of course she had to fall back on some of her old pallor tricks in order to legally travel, but <br />
she had years of experience. <br />
<br />
She was asked hours later, &quot;I trust you found all the books you were looking for on your <br />
trip Marie?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes father.&quot; Marie answered, &quot;I did. They've proven most insightful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I should hope so, I don't approve of you doing this, you know that 'assignment' was only <br />
to get you out of the council's elbow room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. But I did as I was told like a good Inquisitor.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You're still too young, you're still a child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sixteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no idea how young that really is.&quot; Said her god father as he leaned against his <br />
cain, when was no longer precisely for show. He had needed it for two years now.<br />
<br />
Marie said, &quot;I'm sorry father...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should go check in to formally acknowledge you're here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie started but then realized what her father meant and nodded. &quot;Yes father.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie made sure to burn the jacket and trousers she had brought back with her before <br />
even getting within sight of the Vatican. <br />
<br />
Marie had gotten fifteen steps within the Vatican walls when she side stepped someone <br />
trying to hug her from behind causing the person to almost trip over their own two feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;whao-, ugh, I knew that smell! Marie you're back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie said calmly, &quot;Yes Kathrine, I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young Felman woman who looked back at her had fur that in another time and place <br />
could have been mistaken for cotton candy.  Her fur was primary powder blue, with bright <br />
pink fur on her belly and other odd places, and all of it had flashy green trim. <br />
<br />
The sight of her fur actually at times made Marie ill. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you had sent more some letters while you were out. It gets lonely without you here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not the only person in the Vatican.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None of them are Marie Cruz.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathrine was keeping to the shadows of the building to starve off heat. She looked up at <br />
Marie quite literally being several inches shorter than her (then again, humans were to <br />
felmans as lupmans were to humans in terms of proportions).<br />
<br />
Marie Cruz had long accepted her name as such, much as she accepted her god father as <br />
her parent. The witchlings had actually helped with that, she didn't have to pretend to be a <br />
boy and not pretend to be anything around them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever.&quot; Marie walked along. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you do always have to be like that?&quot; Kathrine followed along like a lost pet. <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't ask you to be my friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you didn't but you sure looked like you needed one!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie thought back to when she had been transfered for the first time really to live with <br />
children of her own gender... 'I didn't make the mistake I made before, this time I just kept <br />
my distance... too bad this one just won't go away.' &quot;That's your opinion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep! And I said it's kinda good one too.&quot; Kathrine said smiling. &quot;I just want to get to know <br />
you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a safe person to be around Kathrine. If you don't want to use up all nine of your <br />
lives before you hit middle age you should stay far away from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're my nine lives and I'll use'em how I like! Ha ha!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilly asked, &quot;Do felmans really have nine-&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; EVERYONE in the mirror room said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you always have to be so cheerful like some kind of doll?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Toys are made to be there for children when they're alone. Toys are there to comfort <br />
those who need comfort. I'm -sorry- I thought you were a boy pretending to be a girl <br />
when you first arrived...I read it in a book once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I forgot about that a long time ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... okay, that's good! Then we can be friends if everything is forgiven and forgotten!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who said I wanted to be your friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm -your- friend weather you like it or not, so there, nya!&quot; Kathrine stuck her tongue <br />
out. <br />
<br />
&quot;She sure was cheerful.&quot; Maddex's two head said.<br />
<br />
&quot;She had to be.&quot; Glass Marie said, &quot;Or rather, she was expected to be. Red furred felmen <br />
were expected to be passionate, blue furred were expected to be calm and logical, yellow <br />
to be timid and submissive, and so on. Kathrine due to her fur color was expected to act <br />
perky and happy-go-lucky. It was a system that died out by the final years of the nineteen <br />
century.  By the time Marie moved into the girls' living quarters, the others had grown tired <br />
of Kathrine's happy 'rain or shine' attitude.  She felt she had failed the expectations of her <br />
family like that and saw a sudden late comer arrival like Marie as a chance to make up for <br />
it. Inside she was practically begging Marie to accept her. Even when the others decided <br />
Marie wouldn't open up to anyone, Kathrine kept trying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She never heard of 'kick the dust from your sandals and move on?' &quot; Lawrence had to ask. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe she did. But she also honestly wanted Marie's friendship.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So was one of them wasn't she?&quot; Betty asked, &quot;One of the three Marie took with her across <br />
the Atlantic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marie had intended to bring Mutt with her, if her dog hadn't died of old age within the five <br />
years she was looking for allies. The hound dog by then was ancient. Kathrine would first <br />
almost have her soul ripped out of her by a rebel angel... Marie thought that would have <br />
scared Kathrine into never coming near anything related to her again... instead, she <br />
decided just how BADLY Marie needed a friend... in particular when her father finally died <br />
of old age in the next few years...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What were their christian names?&quot; Betty asked. &quot;The girls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They never used them. Nor even bothered to memorize them. They picked them <br />
practically at random, caring practically nothing for the entire ceremony... and they would <br />
come by new names themselves four years from then.... And it was around then that Marie <br />
realized that Kathrine was much more a friend than the fair weather friendship the <br />
witchlings offered...&quot; <br />
<br />

<br />
Fran had not really tried to have breakfast with her packmates and husband and sister-<br />
wife, she knew it was rude, but duty called.  She collected Wendy, Jessica, Rose and Betty <br />
from their bedroom and came shocked to find the Leomans there but quickly recovered (it <br />
made sense the police would send help to deal with their own) before barkings,<br />
<br />
  &quot;Okay everybody, you get some rest, we'll be taking over from here... All of you get some <br />
rest... Ingrid, Joy? That means you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay.&quot; Ingrid's middle head said before falling asleep, and her left head took a power <br />
nap.  Then her right head said, &quot;I slept all night, In, and Gri let me sleep all night. I can take <br />
over from here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Joy's middle head gave much the same answer. <br />
<br />
Fran did her best not to stare, &quot;Darla, Julie, you two go get some sleep, I'll call you for the <br />
night shift.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fran are you really sure?&quot; Darla and Julie began together.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I am okay. I know I am okay. I know we HATE us sleeping separately, but right now this is <br />
for the greater good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, for the greater good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For the greater good.&quot; <br />
<br />
Darla and Julie hugged her sister in their trademark triangle hug before heading up stairs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me.... hello?&quot; Said a young woman's voice. <br />
<br />
Fran's head turned turned to see a human woman wearing a blue folded skirt and blue jean <br />
jacket over a pink blouse with Robert next to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hello Julie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Fran. Julie is my identical triplet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not. You are?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Tabby!&quot; Wanda said surprised to see her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wanda!&quot; Tabby answer zeroing in on her roommate at once.</p>
