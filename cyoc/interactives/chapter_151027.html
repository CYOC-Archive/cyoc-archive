<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick woke up naturally at 6 a.m. Never in his life had he woken up like this before. Even if he was a bit tired, something deep down inside him was telling him he had to get up out of bed. &quot;Awww... Shit...&quot; he groaned. His deep voice reverberated off the walls and shook him awake. &quot;The hell?&quot; he quickly rubbed his eyes and looked around the room he was in. It didn&#39;t make sense. Last night his room was as it had been but today it was completely different.<br />
<br />
No longer were there anime or game posters lining his walls, but instead different pro bodybuilders on stage posing. Each time he looked at it his body naturally seemed to flex the muscle the bodybuilder was showing off, as though he was competing right along with them. Nick shook his head trying to get a hold on the situation but as he looked down he couldn&#39;t believe what he saw. Instead of the flat undefined body he was used to all he could see was a massive chest he couldn&#39;t even look over. To his sides were two arms that were bulging with an unbelievable amount of muscle.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking shit!&quot; he cursed. &quot;I&#39;m fucking huge!&quot; It took a bit of effort to move his massive body off of his bed. The tall 6&#39;8&quot; near 400 pound body was a bit different to move than he was used to. On the back of his door was a full mirror with the sentence, &#39;never big enough,&#39; taped above it. A grin crossed his face as he seemed to agree with the sentiment. After all he still needed to get his morning workout in before he headed off to class. <br />
<br />
He took a step towards his home gym and felt something against his feet. &quot;The hell?&quot; he cursed again. Leaning his massive weight against the wall he pulled his foot up to see the remnants of his size 9 1/2 shoe. At some point they must have torn off of his feet and only remained tied to his ankles. The shoe strings hadn&#39;t broken but they were currently tied around his feet. He let out a bit of a laugh thinking about how his toes probably pushed out through the front of his sneakers and then the width of his feet was far too much to be contained by them. Wiggling the giant toes that weren&#39;t even touching the soles of the shoes any more just felt awesome.<br />
<br />
Walking down to the personal gym, Nick found his large body having to duck under the door frames and turn sideways to get through. His wide overdeveloped shoulders couldn&#39;t quite fit through the door. &quot;Damn... I&#39;m just so fucking big,&quot; he bragged again. The lighting in his living room seemed to have to changed to a bright florescent, bouncing shadows off his muscles even more. &quot;Aww... Fuck... This is great,&quot; he couldn&#39;t seem to stop cursing whenever he talked about his body. The feeling was just too surreal but inspiring.<br />
<br />
Instantly his body went to working out. Half the weights he thought he would have been using were now worthless. All he had to focus on were the 45 pound plates for the bars and the upper quarter of the dumbbell rack. He started pumping out some reps. But this time it was different. The last few days he&#39;d almost been in a trance, now he was fully conscious of each and every rep. His mind loved counting them up while he watched his muscles tighten then bulge at the exercise. <br />
<br />
The hour seemed like it passed too quickly as he finished his last set. Part of him wanting to just keep going. To see that pump get even bigger. Veins were protruding out of his body while sweat dripped all over him. &quot;Shit... I stink,&quot; he laughed stupidly giving his armpit a smell. The smell didn&#39;t bother him, but he knew other people would complain if he didn&#39;t take care of it. <br />
<br />
Nick waddled over to the shower and pulled himself in. It was so small compared to his body right now. His shoulder was against the wall and the other was nearly pushing out of the curtain. All the while he had to duck several inches to get the top of his head wet. He couldn&#39;t help but laugh at how ridiculous it all was. Before he would have never thought this was even possible. Now he couldn&#39;t dream of it as any other way. <br />
<br />
He hopped out of the shower and grabbed his XXXL shirts. They fit tightly across his chest and the sleeves rode up his round shoulders. &quot;Damn I look good,&quot; he bragged.</p>
