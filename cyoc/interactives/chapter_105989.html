<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Noon the next day.<br />
<br />
Both Dymixious and his wife where waiting in an exam room. While Dymixious has been to moon lake many time; this is the first time his wife has ever been to town. She was sort of disappointed that it was full of normal looking people until Dymixious told her of the various town laws. One of those being that were&#39;s are not to shift during the daylight while out in public. Evening however was another matter. Reading a magazine, Dymixious hated hospitals. More so, he hated the sterile smell of hospitals. The chemicals used to clean everything could be describe pungent at best. But being a were with heightened senses, the pungent smell was nearly overpowering.<br />
<br />
Dr. Tora enters the room. “Sorry to keep you waiting. My name is Dr. Tora Akane. I understand the both of you are here for a checkup?”<br />
“More so for my wife,” Dymixious responds. “But I understand the Skulk and you are curious about our kind.” Dymixious continues. “I will do my best to accommodate you in that regard, but my wife and future baby’s health come first.”<br />
“That is understandable,” Dr. Tora answers. Dr. Tora begins by asking basic questions. Allergies, any prior health issues and the health problems of past family members. Dr.Tora then begins to perform a basic physical to establish Jade’s health. While the blood pressure and usual exams all fall within nominal ranges; Dr. Tora could only surmise for she did not have any base line figures to go off of.<br />
<br />
“Now we need to exam the fetus.” Looking at Dymixious, “Can you help you wife lie on the exam table?”<br />
Dymixious does what is asked while Dr. Tora wheels in and ultrasound machine. Placing medical jelly on Jade’s belly Dr. Tora starts to look at the fetus. What she sees surprises her. “Are you curious as to your future child’s gender?” She asks.<br />
“Of course,” they both say in unison.<br />
“Twin boys,” Dr. Tora responds.<br />
Jade and Dymixious are floored. “Twins?” Dymixious is the first to speak.<br />
“Yes,” Dr. Tora answers. “Would you like to see?” Dr. Tora turns the monitor around so both could see two male fetuses roughly seven months along .<br />
Jade giggle, “we got more shopping to do my love.”<br />
“I’ll let you take care of that honey,” Dymixious looks at Dr. Tora. “Any hope of getting a photo? My father would like to see his future grandchildren.”<br />
“Not a problem,” Tora responds. “If it’s all the same I would like to schedule another appointment for Jade in one months’ time. Will that be an issue?”<br />
<br />
Dymixious looks at his wife. Clearly elated that he will be a father to twins he responds, “Shouldn’t be a problem.”<br />
“I’ll have my nurse fit you in then.” Dr. Tora continues, “That being said, would you mind answering a few questions?”<br />
“Well, since we are done with my wife and that there is no problems we can spare an hour.” Dymixious responds.<br />
<br />
Dr. Tora grabs her note book. “Firstly, how old are you?”<br />
<br />
Dymixious doesn’t answer right away. Instead he looks at his wife. She is bound to find out sooner or later he thinks. Looking back at Dr. Tora. “While I might look only thirty years old. My true age is one hundred and fifty years.”<br />
Dr. Tora is stunned. Here is a young looking male as old as her mother, and still looking as if he is in the prime of his life.<br />
Before Dr. Tora can ask her next question, Dymixious takes off his clothes and shifts into his scale form. Where once a man roughly six feet in height stood, there now stands a large scaled creature roughly ten feet in height. The fact that he had to stoop slightly; so as not to bang his head into the dropped ceiling, says something for his imposing nature.<br />
<br />
Dr. Tora is stunned beyond belief. Here standing before her is a large anthropomorphized Komodo dragon. Standing on 3 toed digitigrade feet, Dymixious stares at a gobbed smacked Dr. Tora. With his forked tongue flicking in and out he can sense her fear and excitement. He then begins to speak.<br />
“The firsssst thing you will notice issss a pronounced lissssp when I speak while in thisssss form.” Dymixious continues. “Thisssss issss partially due to my forked tongue.” Staring at Dr. Tora, “You might want to take notessss of my form doctor.” Dymixious slightly hisses.<br />
<br />
Breaking out of her state of shock, The Dr. begins to feverously jot down everything she sees. Dymixious’s legs are similar to that of most weres. Sharing similar traits to the hind legs of most animals. It makes sense when shifting from a quadrupedal stance to a bipedal and vice versa while in motion. She notes that each digit on his hands end in razor sharp claws roughly three inches in length. His head is similar to that of the komodo dragron. Seeing the forked tongue flick in and out was unnerving to say the least. While komodo dragons have tails to provide balance. Dymixious has what could be describe a short stump like protrusion that completely covers his rear end. There is slight movement from the tail like appendage as Dymixious readjusts his stance. But what struck her odd was there where no visible genitals present in the crotch area.<br />
<br />
Dymixious quickly reverts back to his human form and redresses. Jade who was present for the entire show, showed no fear. She&#39;s seen her husband shift many times. If she wasn’t pregnant with twins, she would shift herself. But thinking of the health of her unborn babies, she has chosen to maintain her human form.<br />
<br />
“Another thing you need to note Dr. is that while we have enhanced senses akin to that a werewolf; while in our scale form, we tend to smell with our forked tongue; like most reptiles.” Dymixious continues, “you might of noticed we don’t have a scent so to speak. Don&#39;t ask me why most weres can&#39;t detect it; but we do have one. Us dragons are able to notice it. Lastly I noticed you looking at my crotch. In my scale form my penis and testicles are internal like a reptiles. While you may not have seen it, I have a cloaca and when aroused in my scale form, dual heme-pens emerge from it. Roughly sixteen inches in length and complete with barbs.” Looking at his wife smiling, &quot;We are very well endowed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Tora writes all this down. It does answer a lot of her questions but she did have one that Dymixious may not have considered. “Is your were stain incompatible to all other weres and humans alike?”<br />
Dymixious chuckles, “So that explains why my father wanted me to attend this exam.” He continues, “to answer your questions. Because we are reptilian based the ability to mate with other weres, like that of werewolves, were horses and other mammal based weres is impossible. As for regular humans, ninety percent of the time our were strain will kill the person.”<br />
<br />
Jade then interjects. “I was once Human Dr. Tora, yet my conversion was successful. I’m not sure if this helps; But before I became a were dragon, my blood type was AB negative. Also if you are curious I am thirty years old. I have been a were dragon for a year and a half now. I&#39;m just as surprised as you are as to how old my husband is.”<br />
<br />
&quot;We are  very long lived race, doctor,&quot; Dymixious adds. &quot;My father is roughly two hundred and fifty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr.Tora makes a note of the blood type, Jade&#39;s age and the fact the were-dragons may be the longest living species to date. Since AB negative is a rare blood type it does give her and avenue to help understand the species, compatibility wise. “One more thing and then you can both leave.” Dr. Tora comments. “Can I get a blood sample from each of you to start my research?”<br />
<br />
Dymixious screws his face up in a clear sign of discomfort. He hates needles but acquiesces to the Dr. Tora’s request. So does Jade.</p>
