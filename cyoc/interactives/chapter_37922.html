<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two jocks stood near Ty and waited for something to happen.  Ty had let them &quot;twist in the wind&quot; long enough so he started his revenge by placing the thought in their heads that they should be jacking off.  Scott was the first to pull out his decent sized cock and Jeff watched intently as Scott started  &quot;choking his chicken&quot;.  Scott's cock started to grow and at the same time so did Jeff's body in all directions.  <br />
<br />
Jeff was getting taller and his muscles were growing larger.  &quot;Scott keep going this is great.  Look how huge I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott was still rubbing his cock and he wasn't growing.  &quot;Jeff, If you want to get bigger then how about rubbing one out for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff went to town on his cock and sure enough Scott was now getting taller and wider also.  In no time both men were bigger than Ty.<br />
<br />
Jeff was now approaching seven feet and he looked down at Ty.  &quot;Hey little man, you not looking so big anymore.  Take a look at these guns!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff held up both arms to do a double bicep pose.  Ty put on the best worried look that he could muster, &quot;You guys are now bigger than I ever was. Maybe, I made a mistake giving you those pills.&quot;   &quot;But I don't think so&quot;, Ty mumbled under his breath.<br />
<br />
While Jeff was doing his posing routine, Scott was shrinking.  &quot;Jeff, stop looking at yourself and get back to your cock.  Can't you see that I am losing my muscle gains.&quot;  Scott was now almost back to where he started but he was growing again once Jeff got back to rubbing his cock.<br />
<br />
Ty was laughing inside.  These guy's haven't figured out what was going on yet.<br />
<br />
Scott's dick was turning bright red.  &quot;The skin on my cock is going to come off.  I need a break.&quot;  Scott was back up to seven feet and 380 pounds of solid muscle and still growing thanks to Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff yelled at him not to stop cause he didn't want to shrink.  Scott turned to Ty, &quot;This actually worked for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty's continued response was, &quot;This is how I got bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stopped rubbing his sore cock.  &quot;Well if your not going to keep it up then I'm not going to either.  So we shrink back to our original size.  Better that then having our cocks fall off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both jocks were now back to their starting size and weight.  Scott now looked up to Ty, &quot;How did this make you bigger?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty straightened up his back so he stood tall, looked down at the jock and smiled, &quot;You're about to find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was the first to notice that he was still shrinking.  He was the first to grow and now he was the first to shrink.  &quot;Scott,  something is wrong here, I'm getting smaller and look, so are you.&quot;  Both jocks were now down to five feet but Ty was growing.  Jeff looks way up to the seven foot Ty and asks, &quot;What the hell is going on here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty put his huge hands on both or their heads. &quot;You wanted to know how I got big and this is how.  As you grow smaller, I get all the size and strength that you lose.&quot;   The two jocks looked at each other and started rubbing their cocks in unison.  &quot;Pardon the pun, but you guys can't keep it up forever.&quot;<br />
Ty laughed in their faces.<br />
<br />
Ty was right.  After another twenty minutes of  going up and down, Jeff and Scott gave up and Ty continued to grow as they shrunk.<br />
At four feet tall, all of their clothes were now too big to stay on and the boys were naked.  Ty was now approaching eight feet and his top and shorts were on the floor. He made his jock strap expand as he did.<br />
<br />
At three feet tall, the boys asked Ty what he was going to do with them.  Instead of answering them, he just smiled.  This scared the shit out of them and they went into a huddle to decide what to do.  They were now two feet and Ty was eight and a half feet tall and 550 lbs of Greek god muscle.  The boy's were at Ty's feet and to him they looked like ants.  They decided not to wait around to see what the giant was going to do to them so they started to run and made it around the corner to the next row of lockers where they ran right into Ty's foot. They were now four inches tall and out of breath.  What ever was left in their lungs was emptied when they were scooped up by Ty's huge hand and lifted up to his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey little men, you're not looking so big anymore.  You want to see my guns now?&quot;  Ty was enjoying this so much. He sat both of them on top of his right bicep.  &quot;How does that feel?  Hard isn't it.  Like my cock is now because it's expecting company.&quot;<br />
<br />
To the sounds of little screams, Ty opened the strap of his jock strap and dumped the two ex jocks in.  &quot;You guys hang out in there for now till I figure out what to do with you.&quot; He snapped the strap shut and went over to the mirrors where he admired his huge muscular body.</p>
