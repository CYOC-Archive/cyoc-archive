<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She sees her current boyfriend, Chris. He was her friend since kindergarten, so when she broke up with John, he helped her cope up by inviting her out on a few &quot;dates&quot;. They weren't officially dating, but they both secretly liked each other. He <br />
was somewhat nerdy, unlike John, a jock, but he managed to be smart, funny, and even sorta handsome with his messy black hair and cute blue eyes. She herself wasn't very pretty, easily overlooked. In fact, the main reason John dumped her <br />
was for one of the cheerleader girls.<br />
<br />
Barbie decides to change Chris and make him more attractive. She opens his page and sees the following basic stats:<br />
<br />
14 y.o.<br />
Male<br />
5'8<br />
120lbs.<br />
skinny<br />
nerd, cute, funny, passive<br />
black hair<br />
blue eyes<br />
straight<br />
likes Barbie<br />
<br />
she decided to change him to:<br />
<br />
14 y.o.<br />
Male<br />
6'4<br />
290lbs.<br />
muscular<br />
jock, sexy, funny, assertive<br />
black hair<br />
blue eyes<br />
straight<br />
loves Barbie<br />
<br />
She clicked “change” and chose “over next 1 hour” and clicked “save”.<br />
<br />
Barbie looked back at Chris and saw he was staring at her. His smile seemed more confident, and he walked over to her with slightly more confidence than usual. He stopped in front of her.<br />
<br />
“Just saw you. I would’ve came over here quicker if I knew you were just lying here by yourself.”<br />
<br />
She was taken aback by his sudden outgoing attitude, but replied, “hey Chris. Want to…”<br />
<br />
Chris interrupted her, seeing her new Chronivac. “Nice laptop you have there. It’s new, right?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah. Want to come over to my house?”<br />
<br />
Chris gave a dazzling white smile. He always had good hygiene, but this was something new! It also looked like his clothes were getting tighter on his body. She estimated he had grown about 20lbs more than he was five minutes ago. “Sure. <br />
Let’s go right now!”<br />
<br />
“Ask your parents first.”<br />
<br />
“Aw, come on. I’ll call them when we get to your house. They won’t have any objections, right?”<br />
<br />
Barbie wasn’t expecting this- Chris always asked his parents. Regardless, she saw this as a nice change. “Okay. Let’s go.”<br />
<br />
Chris walked ahead, looking back at Barbie to follow him. From behind, she had a good view of his slowly-tightening T-shirt and jeans. His butt bulged beautifully, and his shirt was stretched across his growing back muscles. By the time they <br />
reached her house, she estimated he was 160lbs. and 5’10. He started to feel uncomfortable, but Barbie was enjoying the view!<br />
<br />
“Umm, I know this isn’t like me, but I need to take my shirt off, okay?” Without even waiting for a response, he pulled off his shirt and inhaled. “That shirt is tight! I should have thrown it away!”<br />
<br />
He wasn’t super impressive, but Barbie was still impressed by his fitness. He had almost no fat, and his lean, ripped body looked like something you would see on a man, not a boy. “You know, I really like you.” He continued. “I’m ashamed to <br />
admit it, but <br />
I’m glad John dumped you. I think you are better with me.”<br />
<br />
“I agree,” Barbie grinned, “you’re so much nicer, and cute too. Let’s go up to my room.”<br />
<br />
They went upstairs. “Do you think I hit a major growth spurt or something?” Chris said after they played a few games. “I thought I was imagining it, but now I’m sure.”<br />
<br />
Chris was now 180lbs and 5’11. He could have been a male model, with great proportions and a handsome, rugged face. Barbie could hardly believe this. “You grew, alright,” She said. “Check your height and weight in the bathroom over <br />
there.”<br />
<br />
Chris ran straight to the bathroom and stayed there for 10 minutes. She heard gasps, grunts, and even a yelp from inside. She chuckled, thinking what new discoveries he was making. By the time he came out, he would be even bigger!<br />
<br />
“This is awesome! Barbie, I’m 200lbs heavy and 6ft tall! Can you believe that? Shit, I could beat the crap out of John or the other jocks any day!”<br />
<br />
Barbie laughed. “I think you were measuring some other things too, based on your noise.”<br />
<br />
Chris laughed back. His voice was deeper, more like a high school football player than a middle school kid. His face was more attractive too, rugged, manly, and sexy. His black hair/blue eyes combo made him look cute before, but now he was <br />
hot! “Yeah. My “thing” is 8inches now. Pretty big, huh?”<br />
<br />
Barbie could hardly resist anymore. “Those jeans are tight. Maybe you should take them off, huh?”<br />
<br />
Chris just smirked mischievously, then flexed his thighs and calves, ripping his jeans apart. “Yeah, they get big, huh? My arms are pretty big too. But you want the prize, don’t you? You want this big hard long fat dick right down here.” Chris <br />
grabbed his underwear and ripped it, his large fuckmeat flopping out. Barbie opened her mouth wide and Chris shoved it is, facefucking the young girl like a pro. She sucked on his cock, giving him pleasure he never before felt.<br />
<br />
Barbie could feel Chris growing inside him. The meat had to be 10inches by now. She tried to pull out, but Chris held her head in place. “No way, babe. You stay until I shoot my load.” With that, he resumed fucking her throat, pleasuring <br />
himself until his massive fuckrod shot a gallon of his cum into her belly. Then, he retreated and smiled down at his bitch.<br />
<br />
“Bet that’s the best fuckin’ thing you ever felt, huh? Bet you’re so much in love with me right now, I could take you anywhere I wanted, huh? Bet you think I’m the most handsome devil on Earth, huh?” He was flexing his pecs, watching them <br />
bulge with power. “Fuck, I grew again, didn’t I? Let’s go check.” Chris lifted the exhausted Barbie with one arm and checked out his stats in the bathroom. “280lbs, 6’4 tall, and a fuckin’ 12inch cock? Fuck yeah! I’m the biggest fuckin’ 14-year-<br />
old there is!”<br />
<br />
Barbie only stared at Chris, her perfect man, her boyfriend. Chris gave another dazzling smile, then kissed her powerfully, a kiss most adults would envy. Barbie was overwhelmed by her musclestud boyfriend and passed out. Chris was the <br />
sexiest man who ever lived, and he was only 14! Fuck yeah!</p>
