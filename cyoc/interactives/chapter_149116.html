<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His face inches from his most recent kill, the smell of fresh, raw meat and blood teasing his olfactory senses, Tobias planted his malformed paw-like hands on the carcass of the dead ungulate and used his sharp canine teeth to rip more of the flesh and meat from what had once been a young deer. A couple inches from him, the male wolf also did the same and for the moment, there was only the sound of the two eating.<br />
<br />
The fact that he was eating an animal without having cooked it, and sharing his meal with a wolf, no longer really bothered him. His way of looking at it had shifted, subtly, to the point that he understood that he needed to eat and that his choice was to either hunt for his dinner, go without, or swallow his pride, enter the cabin and search for food there, which he really did not want to do. And with hunger winning out in the end, he had submitted to catching his dinner, finding it was got easier and easier each time he did it and that, after the first meal, it wasn&#39;t as gross as he had thought it would be to eat meat raw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or as difficult,&quot; he thought to himself as he used his sharp teeth to rip more from the carcass.<br />
<br />
No, what bothered him was what was happening to him, of which he saw no way out as of yet, plus the fact that he&#39;d had essentially been forced to now go about naked because of the most current events. Events that he found hard to believe had happened nearly two weeks ago when he had given into lust and, in doing so, had lost the use of hands.<br />
<br />
His line of sight briefly flicking to his paw-like hands and he quickly looked away, hating to look at the malformed things any longer then he had to. With only four, stubby finger-like dog-toes that ended in claws and connected to what still looked like a human palm, the appendages were totally useless for anything. He had tried, numerous times, to pick up stuff, but his fingers wouldn&#39;t cooperate, nor could he, say, button and zip his pants. This had left him in a bit of bind, as he had tried to go about with his pants undone, but they kept slipping down and in the end he&#39;d been forced to abandon them, leaving him with only his shirt.<br />
<br />
Of the last bit of clothes he had, Tobias had felt certain it would have been fine, except he soon was once again faced with a problem he&#39;d encountered briefly before. Namely, that his dog penis kept extending out the sheath, semi-erect, and in the process was brushing against the frayed ends of his shirt, sending him nearly to the point of giving in to his sexual desires again. But not wanting to do that, even if the she-wolf had disappeared somewhere, leaving him only with the male wolf as a companion, Tobias had quickly shucked off the garment and after a moment&#39;s thought, tossed it aside, leaving him completely naked, which, at first, bugged him to no end, but then, like eating things raw, he had grown used to it.<br />
<br />
Of course he wasn&#39;t entirely comfortable with his body. His feet, now dog paws, had taken some used to, as he&#39;d at first couldn&#39;t stand on them, followed by the issue of trying to walk on them. But once he grasped the concept of how to plant them, how to shift his body, move his legs, that his tail helped his balance, Tobias soon found that going about on paws instead of feet wasn&#39;t too difficult. It was just disturbing to look down and not see his normal human feet. Like it was off-putting to see his malformed paw-like hands, that he had a tail, a dog&#39;s penis and sheath, to be able to put his fingers in his mouth and feel sharp canine teeth, or to run a paw-like hand through his hair and feel that his ears were now on top his head.<br />
<br />
Not happy with what had happened, or that he was no closer to finding a solution, he did take solace in that fact that with his hands the way they were, plus that the she-wold had wandered off, he could no longer give into the urges of lust. Without the continuous smell of a female in heat, he found a happy medium in that even though he was always horny, there was nothing for him to stick his penis in. And masturbation was out, as his ability to grasp anything was no longer an option.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, if I wanted a lay, I could go find Eli and see if I could convince her to help me satisfy my needs,&quot; he thought, but then pushed the thought away.<br />
<br />
Eli, the teenage girl he promised to help, of which he felt a strong pang of guilt because he couldn&#39;t, Tobias knew he had to stay away from her. Like the she-wolf, he reasoned that any smell of a female was temptation, which he did not want to give in to. Sure, he had to go about with a sem-erect penis, except for when it grew flaccid enough for him to take a leak, plus what seemed like a never ending sexual urge. But he considered it safer it this way and finishing his meal, he glanced at the wolf and found himself glad it was the male and that he was not gay. Pushing himself up, he told the animal, &quot;You&#39;re the better company of the two, you know that,&quot; before turning and walking across away.<br />
<br />
The wolf, who didn&#39;t appear to understand what Tobias had said, merely stared at him, or more precisely, the area in and around Tobias&#39; tail. There was something about the smell of the human that seemed, comforting, wanting, that stirred in the wolf&#39;s brain urges of his own. Watching the human as he lay down, the wolf eventually turned his attention back to the fawn carcass and began nosing and sniffing at the remains, looking for anything tasty that might have been missed.<br />
<br />
Oblivious to the fact that he had just been eyed sexually by the wild canine, Tobias lay down on a comfortable patch of grass. A yawn escaping him, he drifted as he thought about how it seemed his sleep cycle had shifted, as he was more active at twilight, usually at night, but very little during the day. Figuring it might be because his mind knew that the two times he was more active was when the best hunting could be done, he absently shifted. He semi-erect penis rubbing against the ground, and not for the first time, Tobias found his thoughts shifting to how comfortable lying on the ground actually was. Content, sure he was safe from giving into the curse, he missed it as he relaxed and continued to move himself back and forth ever so gently.<br />
<br />
Sated, his tongue working bits of his meal from between his teeth, or darting out to lick at spots around his mouth, the young man thought the warmth spreading over him was due to having lain down in a particular comforting patch of sunlight. Clueless to the fact that it was actually his body going into heat, Tobias continued to rub his cock against the ground until suddenly his eyes snapped open. All too aware of what he was about to do, he snapped, &quot;No,&quot; and tried to force himself to stand.<br />
<br />
Near panic at what he was close to doing, he scrabbled to get up, but was only able to get his hind end up. Shifting his paw-like hands in an attempt to find a decent purchase to make himself stand up, he yelped when something heavy and furry landed on top of his back. His panic nearly overwhelming him as he realised it was the male wolf, Tobias at first thought the animal was attacking him and was going to bite his neck. But then he felt something pressing into the area between his legs and understanding coming to him, he wanted to scream as he tried to push the animal off his back. The wolf hugging him and pressed himself closer, Tobias was shocked all that happened was that he was himself positioning better for what he knew was going to happen.<br />
<br />
A sense of dread washed over him as he thought, &quot;Shit! I&#39;m about to be anally raped by a wolf,&quot; as the animal began probing with his own semi-erect cock, searching for the hole in which to insert it.<br />
<br />
Not wanting what he was now certain would happen to take place, Tobias tried again to struggle free. As he did this, his scrotum, which had been pulling tighter and tighter against the area between his legs, split. Female canine exterior genitalia forming, the heat cycle causing it to move directly into the phase of being ready for male penetration, the last of Tobias&#39; scrotum forced its way into his body and began forming first the vagina opening and passage. The male wolf, finally finding the point in which to stick his cock, began to poke at the now sensitive area. And as the rest of the interior reproductive organs formed, Tobias had a brief flash that something was off before he felt the male wolf thrust his penis inward.<br />
<br />
A need unlike any Tobias had ever felt flashed over him and for a moment, he fought against it. But then it became too much and as a feeling of bliss swept over him, he found himself positioning himself better. His toe-like fingers digging into the soil, Tobias closed his eyes and raised his face upward. His female genitalia and reproductive organs finishing their formation, his body responded greedily to the wash of female hormones his ovaries now produced, which mixed with the male hormones his testicles created. Starting to pant, liking how it felt to be knotted to the male, a whimper escaped Tobias as his chest began to first itch, then push outward in six spots.<br />
<br />
Lost in the sensation of being taken by a male, Tobias was oblivious to any of the changes. The male wolf thrusting away, lost in his own haze of needing to copulate, to make what he smelled as a bitch in heat the reciprocator of his seed, started to whimper, yip and pant in excitement. As the wild canine made these noises, Tobias had a brief flash of something off, but then, hearing the noises the wolf was making, he to began to echo the noises, the sensation of doing so feeling so primal, leaving him with a sensation of being closer to the animal.<br />
<br />
One atop, the other down on his knees, his malformed fingers dug deep into the soft earth, the two were oblivious to everything except the one thing they felt needed to be taken care of. And with a sudden eruption from both the male wolf and his own female genitalia, the two climaxed, sealing in place the six teats and female canine genitalia and reproductive system that Tobias now sported. <br />
<br />
Afterward, he slowly came down off the bliss of ecstasy and, at first, Tobias couldn&#39;t fathom what had happened. His first thought was that he had been anally raped by the wolf. But then, as he felt the furry weight on his back, could smell the animal, and found he like how the male wolf smelled, the young man suddenly felt himself crash as he came to understand that the canine&#39;s penis wasn&#39;t in his ass, but was in his vagina. Everything hitting him at once as he realised what he&#39;d done, what he&#39;d once again given into, how he&#39;d given into it, Tobias thought, &quot;Oh, shit. Oh, fuck,&quot; as he struggled to come to terms that he now had both male and female canine genitalia and reproductive organs.</p>
