<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Deciding that the arcade isn't the right place for him, Andrew goes outside unsure of what to do, but he felt <br />
the urgency to find someone growing.<br />
<br />
As he stared into space momentarily, the thought of going to a bar crossed his mind. The non enchanted remnant <br />
of his brain panicked and tried to break the hold the spell had on him. (The non enchanted part is the most <br />
important, as far as the witch is concerned, it is the part that will be retrained on how to express love.)<br />
<br />
He may have been able to break the spell. Having been pubescent 20 minutes ago his mind is much more familiar <br />
than an adults would be, with the wild change in hormones that the potion is causing. Andrew was winning <br />
against the spell but became distracted when he saw a very powerful aura surrounding a woman who was dropping <br />
off her 16-17 year old son. In beating back the spell he was more conscious, in being more conscious he became <br />
completely fascinated by the strange thing he was seeing around the woman.<br />
<br />
Like a rubber band the spell snapped back and gripped him tight. Andrew bonded with this woman, she needed him <br />
and now he needed to serve her. His body instantly began exuding pheromones to make him seem more attractive <br />
and trustworthy. The ugly aura around her immediately disappeared and the unmasked image of the woman was <br />
seared into his brain as the definition of beauty.<br />
<br />
Andrew, without thinking, walked up to the sidewalk and called out to the woman. &quot;Miss&quot; he called getting her <br />
attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;, she questioned, surprised she was being addressed.<br />
<br />
Andrew, having only matured in body, said the most romantic thing he could think of on the spot. &quot;I am yours, <br />
take me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman was taken aback but after a moment realized he was serious and laughed. &quot;Flattering, tempting even, <br />
but no. You can't be as old as my oldest child. Try someone your own age.&quot;, she said while moving toward her <br />
car.<br />
<br />
Having bonded to her, someone else wasn't an option. Undaunted, Andrew continued, &quot;You don't understand, you <br />
need me, and I need you. I know something happened, it was sad and terrible, and I need to make it better for <br />
you, however that may be.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Andrew was saying this the potion was responding to the woman's first hint, she wanted someone older. <br />
Andrew continued talk and slowly walked toward her while the transformations occurred. His face began to gain <br />
permanent wrinkles and his hair began to gray. He felt more passion with his words than he ever felt before, <br />
he didn't notice as his voice deepened slightly. The transformation ended as he was finishing his monologue.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I am captivated by you and I can't imagine my world <br />
continuing without you in it. There may be several billion other women out there but the only one I care <br />
about, of all of them, is you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Andrew didn't have a clue where this was coming from but it was all true; the more he said the more passion he <br />
felt. &quot;I don't mean now, I don't mean tonight. I don't mean this month. You are all I need. My only desire is <br />
to make you happy in any way you see fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
By now he was only a few feet from her and clearly in his mid 40's, he knelt down abruptly. The pheromones he <br />
was exuding wafted over to the woman, and rather than running away she suddenly found him attractive. Although <br />
his antics were uncouth, he was rather charming, very handsome, and she was becoming intrigued.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you want to be my knight in shining armor?&quot; she asked, confused by the situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be your everything but I will settle to serve you in any way.&quot; Andrew looked at the woman with a <br />
sincerity she hadn't seen in years. The unwavering certainty in Andrew's eyes convinced her that that, beyond <br />
all comprehension, he meant every word he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Sandra&quot;, the woman offered. She was beginning to feel something deep within her. It was the most <br />
painful emotion that existed and she thought she had starved it to death long ago. Apparently not. Her body <br />
shivered as she felt this emotion awaken within her; she was beginning to feel hope.<br />
<br />
Just a few months ago, she finished with a messy divorce. She moved out of the ex's house and started renting <br />
an apartment. Aging mother of three, and unfamiliar with the business world of today, her life was in chaos <br />
and she honestly felt unlovable. The children (24,21, and 17 [unplanned but well loved]) had been thrown in <br />
the middle of everything and made to choose sides; Sandra had been under fire from all sides for the last few <br />
years with the older kids picking up the attitude their father displayed towards her. Her youngest, Jason, <br />
never picked a side. He always listened closely to the arguments and weighed the points with an open mind. <br />
Rather than joining the fights and pointing fingers he asked questions without accusing. When it came down to <br />
the final days of the divorce proceedings as an older minor had to choose if he wanted to live with his father <br />
or mother. His siblings sided with their father early on and rather than be their new scapegoat Jason decided <br />
to live with her.<br />
<br />
When she realized the marriage was failing she did everything she could think of to push things back into <br />
place but the two of them just grew more distant from one another. Then angry. Then hurt. Then disappointed. <br />
Then the words stopped hurting because she didn't respect the source they were coming from. Here she became <br />
depressed and her self confidence took a major hit. It didnt help that the older kids were blaming her for <br />
their home life being crappy and the stress everyone was feeling. With over half of the important people in <br />
her life against her and the last important person being impartial, she accepted that there must be something <br />
wrong with her. She is incapable of giving love and unworthy of receiving it.<br />
<br />
It was here that hope was her biggest enemy. It dogged her day and night about how she could continue trying <br />
to fix things. How it will get better. How love will find a way. It ate at her, whispering all the things she <br />
wished were true. To keep herself from going crazy, she tried to stop listening but hope just cried louder. So <br />
she actively started retaliating against it. With every hopeful thought that crossed her mind, she drug up all <br />
the dirt that she could, and buried the hope till its cries where heard no more.<br />
<br />
Destroying her hope in something she had believed in for so long, her marriage, nearly destroyed her. She had <br />
accepted the failure of her marriage and come to terms with the idea that she is broken and not worth anyone's <br />
time as a partner. Despite all this, she was beginning to feel hope.<br />
<br />
&quot;What exactly are you thinking?&quot;, Sandra asked. Herself not knowing if she was inquiring about how he thought <br />
his advances would work out, his motive, or thought process in general. &quot;And get off the ground, you're gonna <br />
cause a scene.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew rose without hesitation which left him barely a foot away from her, &quot;I was thinking I had to speak to <br />
you. I had to let you know that I am here, that I am yours and yours alone. I will move heaven and earth to <br />
please you. I am thinking about you...&quot;<br />
<br />
Being this close to Sandra, Andrew could smell her perfume and his body was reacting. Being this close to <br />
Andrew, the pheromones his body was producing made her feel safe and calm. Although she knew there was one, <br />
she couldn't think of a reason why she should deny him his goal of servitude. There is laundry and other <br />
chores in spades, plus he is quite cute and a lot of things could fall under serving her in any way...<br />
<br />
&quot;What's your name?&quot; Sandra inquired dazedly, her mind was fighting, her body giving in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Andrew, but you can call me whatever you wish, would you rather I be named something else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Andrew will do for now.&quot; Sandra replied suddenly embracing Andrew in a hug. <br />
<br />
Andrew immediately returned the hug and squeezed her just enough to make her feel safe but not trapped or <br />
hurt. His new muscles pressed against her, and he could feel her breathing and smell her hair. Andrew knew he <br />
was doing good for her and felt elated. He could stand there for days, to bring a smile to her face.<br />
<br />
Sandra's mind melted away, she was filled with a peace she hadn't known in decades. They spent several moments <br />
embracing in the arcade parking lot, mid afternoon on a Saturday. Though she didn't want it to end, Sandra <br />
pulled away, in a haze she told Andrew to get into the car. She was a strong woman but she was tired of being <br />
strong and alone. Even if Andrew is full of it she is going to accept his help while its being offered. <br />
(Thrust upon her more accurately.)<br />
<br />
She didn't understand any of it and right then she didn't care, Andrew's presence made her feel happy and she <br />
could sense that Andrew wanted her acceptance too, so be it.</p>
