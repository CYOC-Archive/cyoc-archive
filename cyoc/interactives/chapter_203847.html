<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Stormwolf for this chapter</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alexandros dug through his box of sex toys, humming happily to himself as he did so. The satyr was clearly happy with what was about to happen. Ever since he laid eyes on that wolf back at the airport, he wanted to show him a good time. Something about his twunkish features really turned Alexandros on. And that ass…<br />
<br />
“Hey, so I don’t mean to be rude or anything,” Todd spoke up. “But how long does it take you to pick a sex toy?”<br />
<br />
Alexandros looked up and smiled at the wolf. Impatient and ready to be fucked…he liked that in his men.<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” the satyr apologized. “I&#39;m just looking for a one that ‘speaks’ to me, if you will. Aha! Here’s something!” Alexandros pulled out an anal fleshlight and a mask. Interestingly, the satyr seemed more curious in the mask than the fleshlight. “How does this work?”<br />
<br />
The wolf wanted to stay quiet, but he knew that this was his only way of getting out of this predicament. “Have you ever seen those porn images with the top using a device to teleport their dick into the bottom’s mouth?”<br />
<br />
Alexandros’ eyes widened. He approached the wolf and put the mask over his muzzle, then stepped back and looked at the fleshlight. “So all I have to do is…”<br />
<br />
The satyr slipped his thick, dripping cock into the fleshlight, and Todd let out a “mmph!” as he felt it in his mouth. Alexandros moaned as he felt his cock magically enter the wolf’s mouth. One sex toy in, and he was already sold! He began to use the fleshlight harder and faster, watching with enjoyment as the adorable wolf struggled to take it all in his mouth at once. Eventually, his thrusts began to get more frantic, and before long, the satyr let out a moan as he reached his climax. Rope after rope of thick, hot satyr cum was shot down Todd’s throat, making the wolf moan out as his crimson commander finally began to emerge from its sheath. How he was able to keep his horniness in check for so long, Alexandros wasn’t sure, but he didn’t bother questioning it now.<br />
<br />
Panting, Alexandros took his cervine fuckstick out of the fleshlight before taking the mask off Todd. He smirked as a bit of cum dribbled down the young wolf’s furry chin.<br />
<br />
“Well that was certainly a good toy,” the satyr said, putting the fleshlight and mask off to the side. He walked back over to the box and began to dig through it again. A minute later, he pulled out a dildo shaped like a canine cock and a buttplug shaped like a tongue. “What‘s so special about these two?”<br />
<br />
“The Red Rocket is a vibrating dildo that stretches your hole for easier and less painful insertions,” Todd explained. “The Licker, on the other hand, is a buttplug designed for preparing the bottom’s hole for anal. It both lubes up the hole and cleans it out. Probably the toy that’s been used on me the most.” Alexandros grinned as he walked behind Todd. The wolf already knew exactly what to expect. He felt something begin to push into his hole, and Todd prepared himself for the licking to begin…except, that’s not what happened.<br />
<br />
As the toy kept going into his ass, Todd quickly realized that Alexandros had put the Red Rocket in him, not the Licker. He began to take some deep breaths as the dildo was pushed deeper and deeper inside of him, and the satyr only stopped once the knot had slipped in. Then, he pushed the button at the base.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, Todd let out a loud moan as the dildo began to both vibrate against his insides while expanding and contracting to stretch his hole. He had tried this product before with Mark, so he knew what to expect from it, but he had been expecting the satyr to use the Licker on him.<br />
<br />
“I figured you&#39;d need something in your hole to keep you worked up.” Alexandros grinned as he held up the Licker. “And I&#39;m very curious about this baby.” The satyr then reached behind him and stuck the plug into his ass, letting out a bleat of surprise as the tongue automatically went to work.<br />
<br />
“G-Gods! I didn’t think this would feel…feel so good!” Alexandros continued to moan in pleasure as his insides were both cleaned and lubed up. From the way he moaned, Todd was reminded of himself during his first few times with Mark. Wait…then did that mean…?<br />
<br />
“You…you haven’t had anything back there before, have you?” Todd panted, the Red Rocket still vibrating intensely. The satyr smiled and shook his head, walking a bit closer to the tied up wolf.<br />
<br />
“Always been a top,” Alexandros said. “And I assumed you’ve always been a bottom. So I figured, ‘why not shake it up a little?’” <br />
<br />
The satyr pulled the plug out of his ass and walked right up to Todd. He then proceeded to straddle the wolf, lining his asshole up with the wolf’s erect cock. Grinning, he lowered himself down onto Todd’s cock, moaning rather loudly as he did. The wolf hissed in pleasure as his cock was squeezed by the satyr’s tight hole.<br />
<br />
“You…you’re a lot bigger than I thought…” the satyr panted, stopping when about an inch of the wolf’s canine cock was inside him. “Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea…”<br />
<br />
“Man, I thought you satyrs were sex addicts,” Todd groaned. “You’re already lowering yourself onto my cock, and now you’re thinking of backing out? What kind of a satyr are you?” <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; The satyr huffed, &quot;You have a good point!&quot;<br />
<br />
The satyr continued to lower himself down on the wolf’s cock, the two of them moaning as he did so. As he went lower, he reached behind Todd and undid the ropes that bound the wolf’s hands together. Almost instantly, the wolf threw his arms around the satyr and pulled him close. Alexandros moaned as his bare chest touched the wolf’s soft fur, encouraging him to start the main event.<br />
<br />
The satyr began to slide up and down on Todd’s dick, moaning loudly as he did so. He bounced on the canine cock, his own slick wang dripping precum all over the two of them. They both panted in unison, staying as close to the other as possible.<br />
<br />
As Alexandros began to ride faster, shoving the red rocket farther up his ass each time, Todd could feel his orgasm rapidly approaching. He wasn’t going to last much longer. “Alex…I’m gonna…”<br />
<br />
“Do it,” the satyr moaned. “Cum inside me you sexy beast!” <br />
<br />
So he did. Todd threw his head back and moaned as his cum flooded the satyr’s ass. The feeling was enough to push Alexandros over the edge, making him splooge all over the two of them. Their orgasms seemed to last for an eternity before they finally died down.<br />
<br />
As he prepared to slide off Todd’s phallus, Alexandros grabbed a regular butt plug from the box of sex toys. As soon as he got up, he shoved the plug in his ass, moaning as he did so.<br />
<br />
“What was that for?“ Todd panted.<br />
<br />
“Simple: I want to keep your cum inside me,” the satyr replied. “Let me savor it for a while, okay?”<br />
<br />
“Alright. You do you man.” Todd let out a sigh. “So, this is the part where you’re satisfied and leave me here, huh?”<br />
<br />
The satyr gave him a confused look. “No…this is the part where I untie you and help you out.”<br />
<br />
Todd was shocked. “Wait, you weren’t lying when you said you’d release me?” <br />
<br />
Alexandros shook his head before walking behind Todd and pulling out the Red Rocket dildo and putting it in the box. He then proceeded to untie the wolf’s ankles, allowing him to get up out of the chair.<br />
<br />
“Thanks…I guess…” Todd said. “I thought that the others would come and save me, but I guess I was wrong…”<br />
<br />
“They haven’t realized you’ve been kidnapped yet,” Alexandros explained. “Your boss Tex might be realizing it now, but he can’t do much since he doesn’t know where you’ve been taken. As for Troy, Rusty, and RK, they’ve been lured into a trap. That email Sebastian sent to Troy was essentially a contract, and by getting on that plane, you all became bound to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd’s heart sank, but he refused to give up hope. “Where are they?”<br />
<br />
“Come again?”<br />
<br />
“Where are they?” Where is this trap they’ve been lured into?”<br />
<br />
Alexandros blinked in disbelief. “You’re seriously going to try and rescue them? Do you even realize who you’re going up against? Sebastian is essentially a god who can bend anyone around him to do his bidding. He’ll make short work of you since you don’t have any sort of protection.”<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t mean that I’m not going to at least try.”<br />
<br />
The saytr sighed and moved over to the sex toy box. He reached in and grabbed something, though Todd couldn’t tell what it was. Alexandros then began to say something in a different language. Ancient Greek, Todd assumed. Suddenly, something was shoved up his ass rather forcefully, causing the wolf to yelp in surprise.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck was that?!” he shouted.<br />
<br />
“Your only chance of defense against Sebastian,” Alexandros replied. “I enchanted one of your butt plugs to bestow the user with better spell casting abilities, as well as better protection against enemy spells and paradoxes. It also essentially nullifies the contact he tricked your friend into signing. Basically, he has little to no power over you.”<br />
<br />
“You couldn’t have just…summoned a ring or an amulet for me to wear?” The wolf asked as he rubbed his ankles and wrists.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I most definitely could have done that,” the satyr said with a smirk. “But I just wanted to get nice and close to that cake of yours again.”<br />
<br />
Todd rolled his eyes. “Why are you helping me?” The wolf asked. “I thought you all were supposed to be loyal to Sebastian because he summoned you.”<br />
<br />
“Well yeah, but I’ve always been a bit of a rebel,” Alexandros confessed. “Plus, I like you.”<br />
<br />
Todd felt kind of bad for the satyr. It seemed to him that Alexandros clearly didn’t want to serve Sebastian. Maybe…just maybe…he could use this to his advantage.<br />
<br />
“I’ll make you a deal Alexandros,” Todd said. “Help me defeat Sebastian and help my friends, and I promise to either resummon you or make my friends resummon you, depending on who gets the Book of Myth. Do we have a deal?” The wolf held out his paw-like hand, waiting for a response. <br />
<br />
The satyr shook his head. &quot;I&#39;m afraid this is the last we&#39;ll see of each other. All of my power was required to make the enchantment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bit of golden energy began to rise from the Satyr&#39;s form. &quot;Goodbye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; Todd reached for the Satyr&#39;s hand but it disintegrated into sparkling motes at his touch.<br />
<br />
The sparkles faded, and nothing remained of the Satyr.<br />
<br />
&quot;Went the same way as all the other men in my life.&quot; Todd wiped tears from his eyes. &quot;Vanished after one fuck. C&#39;est la vie.&quot;<br />
<br />
He pulled up his phone and posted a picture of himself and Mark to Insta&#39;bram. &quot;So happy to have a real man in my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Todd left, sneaking into the hall. He didn&#39;t know where he was, but he was guessing Sebastian had to be somewhere nearby. Probably the big tower he&#39;d seen through the window of his room.</p>
