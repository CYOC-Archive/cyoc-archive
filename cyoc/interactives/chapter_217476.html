<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian wanted a job, but if this Chronivac could really do what he thought....<br />
<br />
The first thing that Brian did, not trusting computers, was to find click on his profile, and to raise his intelligence to the maximum. He then clicked yes to accept the changes, and another window asked for delay and duration, which Brian left at zero seconds for both, then clicked submit. The world changed over the course of a few moments, as he was asking questions, and figuring things out in his head. He didn&#39;t have any new knowledge, but he was able to make full use of his knowledge and experiences from his 51 years of being alive. He had full recall memory and the intellect to use it.<br />
<br />
Thinking things through Brian came up with a plan. He did not have much money, but he could set up a profile on a website where people pay to watch other people&#39;s kinks. He clicked on his profile, and made a backup of it. Then he changed it to resemble a young woman, about 20. The form on the computer screen looked a lot like him at that age, but the small tits and flat ass would not work as a money maker. He turned his young female self into a more marketable internet slut. He didn&#39;t have any clothes to fit this body, so he would have to order a few to get started with, and then he could go out and buy more later. He saved the profile and then went to order some tight fitting workout clothes and a pair of cheap shoes to fit. He had a bit of a cash flow problem, so he would have to work small. He also turned his attention to creating an account on a stock trading website that would make partial share purchases. He spend the next few days reading financial reports and flipping stocks to turn a hundred dollars into just over 14K. He new he would take part of that and offset his capital gains with a tax deduction on his webcam business. He make sure to pay his rent 3 months ahead, since his landlord found out he was looking for work.<br />
<br />
The clothes he ordered arrived, and he opened the box to things that were clearly too small for a heavy set guy in his 50s. He brought up his female profile, and activated the transformation. His whole body felt weird and a painful prickliness lasted for several minutes after the sudden change from 50&#39;s male to 20 year old female. Brian felt a chill when he saw his naked female self in his bathroom mirror. The limited selection of inexpensive workout clothes did not hide any feature on his very feminine body. The sports bra did not really help the huge G cup breasts he had selected, compressing them together and into him. The shorts were fine in the waist, but the tights were tight, same with the leggings. The shoes he got did fit. This webcam thing was going to involve a higher startup cost than projected he thought. The visit to the Lululemon store in the mall did help with his sizing problem, but was nearly a $1,000. His carbon38 order would be a few days, but at least it was informed based on Lulu sizing. Brian altered his face a bit to look more like a lady in the office of his former employer. He did several different set ups with his phone camera to see what worked best. He uploaded the photos to several sites. He knew this would start slow, so he also posted a couple of videos with clothing on, and clothing off. Brian&#39;s first female orgasm was caught on camera, and Brian held that one back for his personal stash. Brian was female for over a week, as he traded during market hours, and worked on different poses and camera angles. Brian was terrified the first time he went outside his apartment, but he was dressed in leggings and a sports bra that showed off every curve and sideboob of his ample bosom. He got plenty of stares and oglers, and a few who wanted to get close enough to touch, like at the grocery store. One guy fingered his cameltoe before he even realized the guy was talking to him. Brian had the body of a slut, and the body responded like a it should, wanting to be touched, and after a week, Brian craved to have a cock stretching his pussy.<br />
<br />
Brian was feeling his clit vibrate against the washing machine in the laundry room when Jake came in unnoticed.  As the machine spun down and Brian eased down from multiple orgasms thanks to the washer, he was oblivious to the world. <br />
<br />
Jake broke the silence, &quot;If you want, I can help with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian&#39;s eyes opened wide and he backed off his grinding of the washing machine corner and did his best to compose himself, his face flushed with a crimson show of embarrassment of being caught. He could not remember the last time, if ever, he was caught masturbating before. &quot;Thank you, everything is just fine,&quot; Brian tried to say with a normal voice. Brian turned to face Jake, who was rock hard holding his cock in his hand.<br />
<br />
Jake was on to Brian, and by the fixed gaze to his cock, Brian was on the hook and Jake just had to reel him in.  &quot;You stay with that unemployed janitor guy, right? I see you entering and leaving his apartment occasionally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian grimaced a bit, he had been a bit too predictable, but everyone had eyes on him...so concealing things was out. &quot;I do, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake stepped up to Brian, and started to finger Brian&#39;s puffy wet pussy, pushing the tight booty shorts up and into his vagina. &quot;I have a place. Follow me.&quot; Brian put his wet clothes in his basket and followed Jake to what he thought was a maintenance room next to the laundry room. Once inside, Jake closed and locked the door. It looked like a hotel room, except for no windows, and the bathroom and shower were in a corner of the open room. Brian put down the basket, and Jake guided him over to the bed. The intelligent part of Brian&#39;s mind was screaming to escape, but the lust and hormones he was feeling and Jake&#39;s cock just inches away, gave way to the carnal aspect of Brian&#39;s female desires.</p>
