<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff read it again and was intrigued by this package. If this package can change his entire life just by <br />
editing himself, he can do whatever he wants. Looking at the screen, he wonders what he wants to be. He can be <br />
either a body builder, a father, a nerd, or something else entirely. The possibilities are endless. But as he <br />
was thinking about that, an idea popped up inside his head. He then wondered what life would be like as a <br />
woman. He’s always curious about the opposite gender ever since health class. Why not use this Chronivac as an <br />
opportunity in experiencing the other side. So with confidence in his eyes, he started to get the work.<br />
<br />
The first thing Jeff types was &quot;My name is Craig Thomas and I am 34 years old&quot;.<br />
<br />
As soon as he had finished typing a tingling sensation came over his body. Looking down at his hands he <br />
watched as they slowly began to change growing larger. Quickly standing up he ran over to his mirror on his <br />
wardrobe and watched as he began to age. Firstly it was obvious that he was slowly increasing in height, his <br />
belly and ankles showing as a result as his clothes were not changing.<br />
<br />
He was also packing on muscle, he smiled and flexed slightly grinning to himself, facial hair appeared on his <br />
face as hair spread across his chest, the hair poking out of the top of his now skin tight t-shirt. The muscle <br />
that he gained soon began to disappear as a layer of fat enveloped them. It was obvious that the muscle was <br />
still there, it now just had a layer of fat around it. He had gained a small muscle gut as a result and the <br />
fat even made his pecs look even larger. His hair began to recede slowly before he became completly bald, he <br />
ran his fingers over his now bald head and smiled he liked it.<br />
<br />
His clothes were now at the breaking point and his t-shirt finally gave way and tore right down the middle <br />
falling to the ground. Jeff looked at his now hairy body with pride and patted his muscle gut &quot;Looking good&quot; <br />
he said in a much deeper voice that surprised him slightly.<br />
<br />
His pants were next as they split down the seems and exposed his hairy muscular legs as well his underwear <br />
which was now bulging. It was obvious that he had grown in that area too. Not even bothing to take them off, <br />
Jeff grabbed the and ripped them clean off his body allowing his now huge dick to spring free and his large <br />
balls to fall and dangle lower down that when he was 16.<br />
<br />
He was just lucky that he was not wearing shoes before the change as he would have been really uncomfortable, <br />
his feet were not several sizes larger and quite hairy. Jeff allowed himself to study his now naked body for a <br />
moment before clothes appeared on him. Worn jeans and a vest appeared on him at the same time to room changed <br />
and became a small one bedroom house, it was slightly run down and looked like it could use a clean, beer cans <br />
and fast food wrappers littered the floor. Jeff now Craig knew he was single, but he didn't mind. When he went <br />
to the bar he usually pulled a few women and went back to their place for some fun, but what he really wanted <br />
was commitment. <br />
<br />
Walking over to the computer, which was now on a desk filled with beer cans he began typing again, to improve <br />
the life he had. &quot;I have a wife, Rose aged 33 and four boys Justin 16, Jamie 13, Alex 11 and Chris 8. We are a <br />
quite poor family but we make enough to get by&quot;. Craig added the last part as he always found kids who had <br />
rich parents to be obnoxious, which was something he didn't want his boys to be. Poorer kids were always happy <br />
and greatful for what they got.<br />
<br />
When he had finished typing the room began to shift again as the house changed. He was now in a slightly <br />
larger two bedroom house, all four of his sons shared a room. It was crammed full of things as 6 people now <br />
lived in the tiny house. The house was slightly cleaner than it was, although there was still mess having four <br />
boys will do that. It was obvious that the house was run down and many of the furniture looked old and second <br />
hand. He didn't mind, whats the point of buying new things if you can get almost the same thing for next to <br />
nothing?.<br />
<br />
Shutting the program down he walked out of his now tiny bedroom that he shared with his wife and into the <br />
living room. He saw all four of his boys on the sofa together watching TV, the looked so much like him it was <br />
almost unbeleaveable.<br />
<br />
Justin the oldest was tall, almost 6 foot tall and had large muscle that the t-shirt he was wearing could only <br />
just contain. Memories told him that he was on the football team at high school and was one of the schools <br />
star wrestlers.<br />
<br />
Jamie at 13 was also tall for his age, it was obvious that he had started puberty early as he was already <br />
quite hairy, much more harier that his older brother Justin. Hair already covered his cheat and his arms were <br />
covered in hair.<br />
<br />
Alex was a mixture of both Justin and Jamie. It was obvious that when he grew older he would be a kid that you <br />
did not want to mess with. He was in a junior football team and had single handedly won several of their <br />
games.<br />
<br />
Lastly was Chris who was 8. He was taller than most eight year olds and was showing signs of early puberty <br />
much like his bother Jamie did at 8. He was already starting to develop hair in places and his muscles had <br />
been growing slightly.<br />
<br />
His wife was not at home at the moment she was working in one of the nearby supermarkets, the money was not <br />
that good buy her wages combined with his as a construction site worker helped pay the bills and keep a roof <br />
over their head. <br />
<br />
He walked over at sat down on 'his' chair. It had conformed over the years and there was now the perfect shape <br />
of his butt in the chair. His boys smiled at him and the five of them watched TV together.</p>
