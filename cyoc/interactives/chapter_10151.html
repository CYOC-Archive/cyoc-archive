<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian knew Sir Tomas would please Kral.  The big man was so very close in looks to the human Kral had once been.  Brawny, well hung, hairy all over, fully bearded.  Sir Thomas could have been Kral’s long lost brother, had centuries not separated the two.<br />
<br />
Brian used his tongue to excite the burly knight’s manhood and the knight stroked his impressive member with both meaty, furry paws.  Brian licked all around the furry, musky balls and teased the pre come out of the huge cock, licking it off the furry fingers and hairy shaft.  Not only was his rod long, it was thick as a woman's wrist and as drunk as Sir Tomas was he did not question how his member sunk so easily into the slender elfin throat; he just enjoyed, moaning softly as his cock was treated to the very best blow job it had ever had.<br />
<br />
“Oh!”  Sir Tomas sighed, “I’ve never had an elf as good as you are.  No one could ever take all I have.”<br />
<br />
Brian sensed the big man’s impending orgasm and moved off.<br />
<br />
“I bet you say that to every elf maid you bed.”  Brian teased.<br />
<br />
“No, no, my sweet.  I mean it, no one has ever been as talented in the bedchambers as you.”  The knight said and caressed Brian’s cheek.  He moved his huge hairy thumb to Brian’s mouth and Brian began sucking it suggestively.<br />
<br />
He was, allowing the big man to cool down, playing with his hairy chest, sucking on his nipples, nuzzling in his beard until the knight was once again ready.<br />
<br />
Brian moved over the top of his prey, positioning his tight elfin opening over the mighty pole standing proudly from the thick forest of red fur that adorned the knight’s groin.<br />
<br />
“Oh, now.  Please now!”  Sir Tomas groaned deeply.<br />
<br />
Brian enveloped the huge cock, Kral was bigger and his new body could accommodate a cock as large as wine bottle round and three foot long.  <br />
<br />
Sir Tomas gave out a whimper as the elf maiden rode her mighty stallion.<br />
<br />
Brian teased Sir Tomas’ nipples and in return Sir Tomas teased Brian’s ample breasts.  Brian leaned over and lay on top of Sir Tomas, kissing his chest and Sir Tomas grabbed Brian’s ass and pumped harder and faster.<br />
<br />
The man was babbling.  Crying out and then whispering in Brian’s ear how good it felt to be inside of such a talented elf.  Brian’s muscular vaginal walls were milking the man’s cock, stroking and it was nothing like the knight had ever experienced before.  It was the most incredible fuck the man had ever had.<br />
<br />
Finally, the huge beast roared and filled Brian with semen.<br />
<br />
Brian came at the same time, but something was wrong.  There was a smell about Sir Tomas that was wrong suddenly and he looked odd.  Brian couldn’t place it.<br />
<br />
The knight murmured sweet nothings and within a minute was snoring.<br />
<br />
The drugged wine had done its job; once asleep it would keep the knight there, dead to the world, for at least four hours.<br />
<br />
Brian tied the big man to the bed with strong leather ties from the harp bag.  The man was so gorgeous, spread eagle on the bed with his cock twitching as he snored.<br />
<br />
Still, something nagged at Brian.  He felt he should know.<br />
<br />
Brian had succeeded, he would go get his master now, but he was feeling sick.  He felt an odd burning at his loins and felt he should know why this was happening.  He shifted into the form of the huge knight, mimicking the armor and clothing precisely, Brian quietly slipped out of the room and down the back stairs.  Now in male form, the burning felt like it was in his stomach; like a bad case of heartburn.  He was feeling very ill by the time he reached his master.<br />
<br />
<br />
After the counterfeit Sir Tomas had left, Brother Ajax slipped into the room and found the naked knight asleep.<br />
<br />
He rolled his eyes to heaven and made a small prayer for guidance.<br />
<br />
Moving over to the bed, Brother Ajax gently slapped the snoring man to try to wake him.<br />
<br />
It was no good, his companion was out cold.<br />
He rather liked his lusty companion, but his lust got him into trouble more often than not.  This the young monk had learned in the brief two years since the temple had teamed them up to hunt those that would attack humanity from within.<br />
<br />
The monk dug through his bags and found an all purpose antidote for the drugs swimming in the knight’s system.  The antidote and the magic were not specific to the drug and as such would have side effects.  Mostly making Sir Tomas ill, but not violently so.  He’d had to give the knight this antidote before and had some perverse pleasure at how Sir Tomas wanted to throw up, but couldn’t.  It looked like Brother Ajax would get a reprise of that episode tonight.  Sir Tomas would be sick to his stomach, but he would be able to function.<br />
<br />
The antidote had other effects on Sir Tomas.  Effects which made Brother Ajax glad of the privacy of a private room.<br />
<br />
Brother Ajax slowly poured about an ounce of thick, oily, disgustingly grey-mauve, foul tasting liquid into the sleeping knight’s throat.  Even in his deep sleep, Sir Tomas made a face.<br />
<br />
Quickly, Brother Ajax unbound Sir Tomas; those side effects would be the first things to show.  Having done that, he sat back and watched the show, though not with the enthusiasm he had the first time he saw the man change while stripped down to a loin cloth.<br />
<br />
Within minutes, the knight began to swell in size.  The already hyper muscular man grew even more muscle on his frame.  Reddish brown fur began to cover the huge man; this was why the temple had selected Sir Tomas, Sir Thomas was special.<br />
<br />
Slowly, with bones popping, features changing and his already enormous manhood growing even larger Sir Tomas took the shape he’d learned he could become from the time he’d entered puberty.  It was a powerful form and Sir Tomas delighted in it.  Long sharp claws pushed through his fingers and toes, his face pushed out in a muzzle and his human teeth popped out of his gums to be replaced by the teeth of a carnivore.  The big beast was becoming conscious now; he rolled over on his side and got on all fours.  Between spitting out teeth Brother Ajax caught part the meaning of the garbled nonsense coming from the changing mouth.  Sir Tomas was complaining about feeling sick and was wondering where he was and why he was changing.<br />
<br />
Brother Ajax watched, now only slightly interested in the transformation.  He’d seen Sir Tomas do this hundreds of times and it had greatly impressed him for a good three months; but by now, two years later, it was like watching the man put on his armor.<br />
<br />
Sir Tomas was half way conscious now and cursing Ajax for using that vile tasting poison on him… again!<br />
<br />
Ajax smirked and said, “If you didn’t have me around to help you out with my vile potions and magic, you’d have been long dead by now.”<br />
<br />
Thomas growled out, and it was more growl than spoken words, “I think I’m gonna barf.”<br />
<br />
The knight’s fur had filled in completely; he had a thick red-brown coat.  His large rounded ears moved up on his rounded head.  The last pops worked themselves out and his stubby tail completed him.<br />
<br />
Sir Thomas of Greyford was one of The Temple of the Burning Light’s formost warriors and a WereBear.  In fact, because he was a WereBear, he was perfect for their mission.<br />
<br />
Sir Tomas, in half form, moved and sat on the edge of the bed with his head in his massive paw-like hands.<br />
<br />
“Oooooh… I think you like doing that to me.”  He growled in his deeper bass.<br />
<br />
“You better get yourself together.”  Ajax said, “That doppelg&auml;nger you fucked is going to know what you are if it doesn’t already and then it’ll be back to kill you.”<br />
<br />
“Doppelg&auml;nger?”  Sir Tomas looked up suddenly and winced.  The room spun just a little and he felt ill again.  “That beautiful elf was a Doppelg&auml;nger?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Doppelg&auml;nger.  You filled it with your sperm and I imagine it’s about as sick as you are.  That seed of yours is trying to convert it into a WereBear and it’s probably giving it severe nausea not to mention the red fur and stubby tail it’s probably sprouting as your seed is trying to reconfigure the foul beast.”  Ajax smirked.  “It’s part of the reason the Holy Order sent the two of us out.  Being a Weres like we are means doppelg&auml;ngers cannot change us into them, of course, we can’t change them into us either, but your sperm is sure trying hard, I’d imagine.”  Brother Ajax explained as though speaking to a child.<br />
<br />
“You little rat faced turd!  I already know that, the brotherhood explained all that to me in my training.”  The Bear moaned.<br />
<br />
“You know, to most being called ‘rat faced’ would be an insult.  I on the other hand am very proud of my WereRat heritage.  We see what other’s miss, we are stealthy and we know what others pass up and leave behind.”  Ajax swelled a little with pride.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, yeah, yeah.”  Tomas said, rubbing his temples, the forced change was wearing off and he was returning to his normal ‘human’ appearance; but his stomach was still queasy.<br />
<br />
“You better get into your armor.  I’m going to ready spells and it wouldn’t hurt if we prayed a little before that Doppelg&auml;nger gets back.  He’ll probably bring his master.”  Ajax said with authority.<br />
<br />
“Master?”  Thomas said as he began putting his clothes on.<br />
<br />
“Yes.  Remember?  Doppelg&auml;ngers rarely work alone.  The master usually sends out its thrall to do the dangerous work while it plots in safety.  In fact we may not have anything to worry about as far as an attack on us.  If the master finds out that there’s a Were he has to face, and it will, the master may leave town with his thrall.  It’s safer.  If it does, we’re going to have to track it down and kill it.  It’s thrall might even be young enough that it  could regain his or her former species and sex if we can kill the master, administer the right potions and get the thrall to the temple within a year.”  Ajax said thoughtfully.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t we just kill both of them?”  Sir Tomas asked.<br />
<br />
“Brother Illiard, that’s why.”  Ajax said confidently.<br />
<br />
“Brother Illiard?  The historian?”  Sir Tomas asked.  “What has this got to do with that old fogy?”<br />
<br />
“Well, once you’ve been changed, you gain all the experience and memories from the Master.  That doesn’t go away when you’re changed back.  Further, you are able to spot Doppelg&auml;ngers like flies on a white sheet afterward without the aid of magic.  It also prolongs your life, how old do you think Brother Illiard is?”<br />
<br />
“I dunno?”  Sir Tomas said.  “Sixty?”  He was feeling much better now; his system recuperating quickly because of his species and with that out of the way his inquisitiveness was piqued.<br />
<br />
“Brother Illiard is 200 and thirty.  He’s written most of the texts in the library which have been spread to our other temples.  He’s recording all the information he was given by his master before he dies.  He’s almost finished too.  His section on medicine and art alone took sixty years to write.  It’s no wonder he has so many apprentice scribes taking dictation.  Brother Illiard was a Doppelg&auml;nger thrall for six months when he was a child.  Our Order saved him and brought him back to humanity.  It was hard, because he was halfway to being permanently a Doppelg&auml;nger, but it was worth the effort.  What we’ve learned from him is invaluable.”  Ajax said.<br />
<br />
“Fine, fine, but how do we tell a less than yearling thrall?”  Thomas asked.<br />
<br />
“I’ll know, trust me.  It’s probably why you didn’t realize he was a Doppelg&auml;nger and why the Doppelg&auml;nger didn’t know why you were a WereBear.”  Brother Ajax said, stroking his black goatee and rubbing his pointed nose.<br />
<br />
<br />
When Brian, still in Sir Tomas’ form reached the hiding place he’d left, his loins and belly not only itched and mildly burned, but looked like that of a bear’s.  It had spread around the back side and Brian had a Bear’s butt complete with stubby tail.  He scratched all over as he went.  The transformation was localized because the sperm had been deposited inside his then female form.  Half way to the hide out, he had remembered why Sir Tomas smelled so strange.  His master had encountered a WereWolf many years ago and had suffered a similar transformation when the WereWolf came all over his chest and rubbed it all over his torso and chest.  From the waste up, his master was in hybrid WereWolf form for three days.  The smell of Sir Tomas was familiar but not exact and that was what puzzled him.<br />
<br />
He was close to the hideout now, he was not worried, his master would know what to do.</p>
