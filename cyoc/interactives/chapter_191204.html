<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff fires the chronivac at Noah, and a bright light envelopes the room. When the light subsides, Noah looks down at his chest and sees a blue hue start to creep. Noah is filled with an immense full body pleasure that he&#39;s never experienced before. the paralytic starts to wear off, and he starts to twitch. He soon breaks free of his restraints, and he stands up and looks at Jeff. Jeff looks at him like Dr. Frankenstein looked at his monster. Noah, both furious at Jeff for doing this to him, and filled with ecstasy, stood and watched his transformation. His dick was at full mast, and he felt as if he was on the brink of orgasm. His chest was soon entirely blue and shiny, just like a polyester sooner jersey. The blue started to creep down his crotch and legs, soon reaching his feet. Noahs face then was almost entirely blue. Jeff went over and touched his creation.<br />
&quot;look at you, you&#39;re absolute beautiful. You will serve me well, and you will enjoy your entirely pleasurable life&quot;, remarked Jeff.<br />
Noah didn&#39;t feel beautiful. He thought he looked like a freak. Soon, Noahs hair started to fall to the ground in large clumps, leaving him completely bald. Jeff then pressed into Noahs chest, as it stared to cave in. His body emptying out. Noah then felt the climax of his pleasure, as he emptied his balls right onto Jeff. The orgasm was so intense, that Noah collapsed onto the ground. Jeff, now caked in cum, lurched to he floor and started to make out with the quickly deflating Noah. Noahs dick soon shrunk into his crotch, leaning his as smooth as a ken doll. Noahs legs then shrunk to short height, and fell from his as blue Adidas soccer shorts. Despite falling off him, Noah could still feel them. Noahs arms then shrunk to shorts sleeves. All that was left of Noah at this point was a head and his chest. Jeff looked at Noah and couldn&#39;t believe he had turned him into the half man, half soccer uniform staring back at him. Through gritted teeth, he spoke to Jeff.<br />
&quot;Jeff, why did you do this to me? why did you take away my humanity like that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because, I knew out of all people that you would enjoy it the most. You were built for this life. You were built to serve as a sweat covered jersey for soccer studs. Your looking at eternity my friend, you&#39;ll certainly outlive me! You get to spend eternity in pure bliss. Not having to worry about the complexity of modern life. I almost envy you&quot;.<br />
All this made Noah think. His whole life as a human, he spent being made fun of. All he wanted was to become a part of the soccer team, and his life as a jersey allows him to do this. He really truly will live a life of pure bliss, for eternity.<br />
&quot;Thank you Jeff&quot;, Noah managed to say, before his mouth sealed shut.<br />
This made Noah panic. He felt like he was suffocating. He started to thrash around with his last bit of human strength.<br />
Jeff held him down.<br />
&quot;Shhh, don&#39;t worry Noah, it will be over soon&quot;<br />
Noah then began to panic more. was he about to die? did Jeff lie to him. Soon after his eyes started to seal shut as well, and his ears closed off. He was transported to a black void. In the real world, Noahs head started to shrink into his chest, before it was completely gone. However, an Adidas logo started to burst through his shiny blue chest, as well as a chest for the schools soccer team. Then lettering on his lower chest spelling out JORDAN HIGH UNITED. Suddenly Noah broke out of his void. He could see, he could hear and somehow he could breath! It was as if some kind of magic over took him. Then, Noah finally made the transition from Human to Soccer Jersey, as he collapsed into a pile of jersey and shorts.<br />
Jeff looked very pleased with his creation. Jeff soon started to jack off his erect cock, looking down at Noah.<br />
&quot;and for the final touch. To make this all permanent. No going back now&quot;<br />
Jeff then erupted on the jersey, spreading his seed across both the shorts and the jersey. Noah then heard something, like it was coming from space. <br />
ATTENTION NOAH ANDERSON. YOU ARE NOW PERMANENTLY A SOCCER JERSEY, AS A RESULT OF BEING IN CONTACT WITH -JEFF SKYLARKS- EJACULANT. ENJOY YOUR EXISTENCE.<br />
I guess there was no going back now. Noah somehow felt at ease with this. No going back to his horrible life before. He was now just a soccer jersey, living in bliss.<br />
Jeff then grabbed the jersey and shorts and put them on, feeling the energy that Noah emitted. Jeff felt a soul bond to him, and could read each others minds.<br />
Now lets go get those slackers.</p>
