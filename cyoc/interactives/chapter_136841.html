<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You start thinking about that jock, Kyle or some shit like that. Ain&#39;t matter what his name is, won&#39;t be Kyle for long. &quot;Jed, you got those keys for the truck?&quot; Jed fumbles in his pockets for a bit before he throws a pair of keys at you. &quot;Pick me up some of that good booze when yer coming back, Grandpa&#39;s new moonshine gunna take a bit.&quot; You nod to Jed and walk out of the barn, Buck approaches you as you leave &quot;Whose it gunna be? You chose a good one didn&#39;t ya? What&#39;s he gunna be like? He good at fuckin&#39;?&quot; Buck might just be more eager for another cousin then you, you laugh as he walks with you to the truck &quot;Yer done with work on the farm today?&quot; Buck nods &quot;Course I am, fastest worker out of all us Fletchers!&quot; Buck puffs his chest out a bit as he boasts. &quot;Yer also the fasted at blowin&#39; yer load, hop in and you&#39;ll get to help me make a bastard into a cousin.&quot; Buck gives you one of his big smiles as he enters the truck.<br />
<br />
You drive for a few hours to reach the city, Buck keeping you company on the trip. As you start to see the city buildings Buck asks you &quot;Got any idea where this boy&#39;ll be?&quot; You spit out of the window, the city smell making you feel sick &quot;Got a clue, he&#39;s usually tryin&#39; to swindle some beer after school. Will check around them there bars, he&#39;ll be there.&quot; You drive down the streets, feeling aggravated at the dense traffic of the city. You&#39;re glad you won&#39;t be visiting this place much. Farms got so much freedom, cities just a confined block for people who can&#39;t handle a days work in the sun. You stop by the first bar you see and pick up the beer Jed wanted, as you walk back to the truck you spot Kyle getting kicked out of a bar across the street. You hear the owner yell at him &quot;You little shit, I catch you trying to get alcohol from me again and I&#39;ll hand you over to the cops. I ain&#39;t losing my license cause you can&#39;t wait a year before getting drunk!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle stands awkwardly at the bar, you stare at him and take in his features. You see he&#39;s going around shirtless, with only a pair of shorts and some sneakers. He&#39;s got a strong build, not as strong as you or your cousins, but he&#39;s a boy who hits the gym. Light brown hairs litter his chest and arms, after a bit of growing he&#39;d probably start shaving it, shame to waste such manly chest hair. He has short, spiked brown hair, his chin freshly shaved. You see his hazel eyes stare back at you &quot;What do you fucking rednecks want? Go back to your inbred family!&quot; <br />
<br />
Buck pokes his head out of the truck and watches the scene, he&#39;s grinning. You share his grin &quot;Yer don&#39;t need to get so hostile there. We was just goin&#39; to have a drink ourself, weren&#39;t we, Buck?&quot; Buck nods his head &quot;Course we were, just picked up some fresh beer!&quot; Kyle looks at you suspiciously &quot;Trying to show off then huh? Got yourself kicked out of school so you can drink that all day?&quot; You laugh at Kyle &quot;Jes&#39; cause we&#39;re older, don&#39;t mean we don&#39;t do hard work. I got a spare beer for my cousin back at the farm, but if yer willing to reconsider...&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle looks to the ground, then back at you &quot;Pft, fine. I want that beer.&quot; You hop in the driver&#39;s seat of the truck, then poke your head out the window &quot;Then get yer ass in the back, we&#39;re goin&#39; a bit out of town.&quot; Kyle walks up to the truck, he opens the back door and slams it shut as he enters. &quot;Urgh, this thing smells like sweat and shit.&quot; Buck turns in his seat and looks at Kyle &quot;Good smell ain&#39;t it?&quot; Buck rests in the seat next to you, you spot him holding one of the bottles near his cock, a little of his seed pouring into it. He closes the bottle and mixes it a bit, Buck notices you looking at him and gives you a knowing wink. You drive out of town and end up reaching a paddock that you recognize. You pull over the truck and everyone walks to the field.<br />
<br />
Buck and Kyle start looking for a good spot to sit down, you go to the truck and get your tools. First, you grab the beer you got, you open them and take a sniff, eventually smelling the one that Buck made. You then grab out an electric razor, your cigarettes, and the bottle of grandpa&#39;s moonshine. Carrying your items, you spot Buck and Kyle sitting and waiting. You walk up to them and hand the beer over. Kyle sees the other items you are holding and asks &quot;What&#39;re they for?&quot; You put the razor and moonshine down &quot;Nothin&#39; big, just got some business here with Buck.&quot; Buck nods in agreement as he begins gulping down the beer. You then hold out a cigarette &quot;Ya know though, this one here is for men like me and Buck.&quot; You light your cigarette then toss the packet and lighter to Buck. Kyle looks jealous as you both smoke &quot;You said that&#39;s for men?&quot; You speak between your puffs &quot;Course it is, men like booze, cigarettes, and hard physical work. Y&#39;all city folk miss most of the marks for that.&quot; Buck tosses you back the packet and you look at Kyle &quot;Want a light then, bud?&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle considers it for a moment, he seems to hesitate, when suddenly he grabs the packet out of your hand. He stuffs one of the cigarettes in his mouth, you light it for him. He puffs it and begins coughing, as he does you see his body mature. His hairs thickens, his chest grows hairier, and you spot some more hairs emerging from his arms. You look past Kyle and see Buck has started stripping, you need to distract Kyle before he realizes what is going on. As he continues coughing, you tell him &quot;Drink some of that there beer, washes down the smoke real good.&quot; Kyle looks at the bottle and opens it, he drinks a bunch of it in one big gulp, then begins coughing harder. You spot his hair growing, becoming a wild mess. His face hardens, the few freckles he had disappear as his chin squares and his brow grows thicker with new hairs. <br />
<br />
He looks at you &quot;Y&#39;all are a lier, this here drink didn&#39;t help me-wait what! Why do I sound like one o&#39; you!&quot; Kyle looks at his body in shock, as he does Buck grabs the razor and you begin your own stripping &quot;Yer becoming a Fletcher, just relax Darrel&quot; Darrel looks at you, he goes to stand and run, but is met with Buck holding his head as he shaves his hair into a mullet. When you finish stripping, you see Darrel&#39;s new mullet and spot Buck smiling. &quot;I&#39;ll do the hard work on his cock if you want to break him in, Mitch.&quot; You nod, &quot;Course, I&#39;ll break him in good.&quot; You and Buck help Darrel to his feet, he is currently dazed by the behavior, still holding the cigarette and the beer you laugh &quot;Ya better finish them both, we Fletcher men don&#39;t let any cigarettes or booze get wasted.&quot; Darrel nods as he takes another puff, you see Buck has just spat into his hand and is rubbing the spit across Darrel&#39;s cock. As he rubs it, you spot the foreskin regrow. Once it has regrown, Buck holds the cockhead and begins to lick it.<br />
<br />
You shove your member inside Darrel in one hard thrust, you wrap an arm around him and bring yourself close to his ear &quot;Yer gettin&#39; the real Fletcher treatment, feel happy, cousin.&quot; You manage to fit around 6 inches of your member inside Darrel, you let your cock rest inside Darrel as you grab the bottle of moonshine. Darrel finishes his bottle and drops it to the  ground, as he does you hand him the moonshine &quot;Drink up, cousin, then the fun&#39;ll begin.&quot; Darrel drinks the moonshine, as he does you see the hairs on his body thickening further. You rub a hand through his chest and feel the coarse hairs that now hide his muscles. Your arm begins to tickle as you see his growing pit hairs resting on it. You begin thrusting as you move your head to his pits, taking a deep sniff you smell your cousin, he smells like the farm.<br />
<br />
Darrel begins thrusting as well, Buck taking more and more of his member as it grows and thickens. As Darrel&#39;s changes progress your dick begins to fit, you fit in 8 inches, then 10 inches, then in a yell you fit in the full 14 inches. You feel Darrels hard, tight ass resting against you. You hold him still as you cum, looking over his shoulder, you can see cum spilling out of Buck&#39;s mouth. You pull out, cum still spurting out of your cock. You walk to Buck and see Darrel&#39;s shaft still pumping out seed. It&#39;s 10 inches now, but it&#39;s thicker than any dick you&#39;ve seen. Buck is clearly straining himself to take this thick dick, and when the seed stops he begins coughing. After, he stands with a smile &quot;That there is gotta be one of those thickest dicks I&#39;ve ever seen in my life!&quot; Darrel breaks out into a grin &quot;Course it is, Fletcher instruments are the best made, ain&#39;t that right cousins?&quot; you all laugh and break into the same cocky smirk. You hop into the Truck and begin heading back to the farm, you&#39;re sure Jed would love some hands-on experience with his new Cousin...</p>
