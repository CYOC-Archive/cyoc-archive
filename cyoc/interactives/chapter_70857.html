<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morning Log:<br />
I woke up today to my phone buzzing.  A text from Robert: “Are you ready for Friday bro?”  The same message <br />
was flashing across my computer screen, in an IM from Kyle.  Seeing it reminded me of last night.  Watching <br />
through the conversation as he gradually became a sex hungry bro, even changing sexuality.  This bro infection <br />
mystifies me more by the day guys, it spreads in impossible ways and changes people more than I ever thought.  <br />
There was another text too, from Johnny, a member of the football team.  He wanted me to come to a party <br />
tonight.  The jocks were the only real competition the bros had in the school.  As popular as they were people <br />
were still more likely to listen to a member of the football team, and go to their parties.  They were my <br />
small glimmer of hope.  Going to go to the store to get some stuff for the party and check on some things.<br />
<br />
Afternoon Log:<br />
Something strange is going on, beyond what I’ve already seen I mean.  On my way off campus Josh approached me <br />
and asked the same thing: “Are you ready for Friday bro?”  On my way to the store I saw another car, one <br />
similar to Mark’s that almost seemed to be following me.  I couldn’t see the driver but I knew it was him.  It <br />
must have to do with Friday.  With their plans, with me.  My suspicions were confirmed at the store, Evan said <br />
nothing to me at the check out except asking me the same thing.  Friday… something big on Friday.  A mass <br />
conversion?  That’s my best guess.  But I have to get to this party tonight, the jocks, I can’t believe I’m <br />
saying this, may be able to help.  They’re all this school has left to defend it from the bro take over.  <br />
<br />
 Final Log:<br />
Chaos.  The party.  I’ve gotta calm down.  It was a pool party of course.  All the jocks wanted to show off <br />
their muscles and such.  All those musculature bodies, exposed, drunk, in just swim trunks splashing around in <br />
the water.  It was Jake’s place I think, also football.  I still didn’t know how I fit in, why they invited <br />
me, why I was here but there I was in my suit in the water with them neglecting drinks and trying to find the <br />
right moment and wording to ask for help.  The cheerleaders and other girls they kept around for… academic <br />
purposes of course were by the water, not swimming just in their suits to look good.  They would occasionally <br />
flirt with one of the guys.  They exchanged winks and sometimes, accidentally, let their bras slip a little.  <br />
I saw Johnny nearby in the water and tried to ask him why he invited me but he looked at me strangely, not <br />
even knowing who I was he was so drunk.  He started to get mad and shouted about why I was at his party when <br />
he stopped.  He looked ill, for a moment I thought he drank too much but it was something worse.  His fingers <br />
started shaking and spasming as he watched in horror.  The short, stubby, meaty fingers became long and lean <br />
and his hand lost the scars of sports.  Jake was outside the pool but he heard and Johnny and rushed over <br />
before the same sensation seized him.  He started to shake as he grew taller and less stocky, his feet popped <br />
out, growing several sizes and his hands got too big.  His arms and legs raced to catch up as he awkwardly <br />
grew in bursts.  All around it was mayhem.  Football players were losing their vast pelts of hair and their <br />
muscle and getting tone and charm.  Crew cuts were becoming bro cuts.  The already flirty cheer leaders were <br />
getting trashier, becoming bro hoes.  They broke out into uncontrolled horniness, squeezing each others plump <br />
asses and giggling hysterically, drinking as much as any of the guys.  Johnny was struggling against his <br />
emerging bro hood, randomly spurting out bro words and getting disgusted.  He was still shaking all over.  His <br />
once hairy chest was smooth now except for a thick treasure trail and his giant pecs, once supported with some <br />
fat were now all muscle and somewhat more compact.  Libby and Linda were making out, their lips much more <br />
plumb, everything about their bodies becoming more exaggerated and luscious.  Their hair grew longer by the <br />
second and their breasts and butts were almost humorously big on them.  Guys around them were paralyzed, so <br />
captivated by their actions they didn’t bother resisting as they changed.  Their suits became smaller as they <br />
became more comfortable showing off for everyone, cockier now then they were even as jocks.  By now almost <br />
everyone in the water was a full blooded bro, Johnny was chilling with a beer in both hands, a new snapback on <br />
his head and a chain around his neck.  His hair was a wavy blond and his eyes a dull blue filled with lust and <br />
ego.  Jake was trying to help him and stop his own change at the same time but eventually he gave in too as <br />
his visage of horror became a matching smug grin and he started flexing for all the ladies, showing off his <br />
chest and arms.  They were less impressive then before muscular wise but the tan, the light coating of blond <br />
hair and just the way he held himself more than compensated.  Everyone around me was changing, their <br />
intelligence getting sucked out, drained away.  Exchanged for something else.  Yet nothing happened to me.  I <br />
just watched them all transform, watched the chaos and bromance unfold as guys argued and mocked each other <br />
for talking like a bro before joining in.  The guys around the pool were almost done and the ones still in <br />
clothes were helping each other strip to watch each other change and seductively stroke each other’s bro bods.  <br />
They slowly peeled off each others shirts, pants, shoes and socks as if on stage at a strip club.  They made a <br />
big show of revealing every changed body part as they reduced themselves to just underwear.  All for the girls <br />
of course who returned the gesture.  Bros felt up each others packages and spread themselves across the side <br />
of the pool smiling.  The girls were smoking and showing off while the last of the jocks fought a losing <br />
struggle against their changes.  One basketball jock lost all nerve and ran for it before being tackled by two <br />
bros, who helped him up as he greeted them as kin, surrendering to his change.  The jocks were gone, there was <br />
no one left to stand against the bros.  That’s when I saw him.  Mark.  I caught a brief flash as he took a <br />
last look around and vanished.  Moments later I heard a car drive off.  I started to get out of the water to <br />
go after him when Johnny suddenly turned to me and asked “Are you ready for Friday bro?”  In his new, deeper <br />
and honey-like voice.  Jake repeated the question, and as I walked past them every now ex-jock asked the same <br />
thing.  And now as I type this last log I realize, I am.  I am ready for Friday.<br />
<br />
- Tom.</p>
