<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan was mad, just like usual. His fucking doctor was sending him to a shrink for anger therapy. Fucking bullshit that wouldn’t work, and a waste of his time. He didn’t have a fucking “anger problem”, it was just there was so much bullshit happening all the time.<br />
<br />
Waiting in the office of Dr. Vetrias was just another inconvenience and the current thing that was pissing him off. He scrolled on his phone through the internet, only looking up when people moved around. Catching motion in his peripheral vision, he saw a burly man walking out of the office, looking completely dazed.<br />
<br />
Weird. The shrink had really fucking gotten to him, it looked like. Wouldn’t be happening to Ethan, he thought, as he was called in.<br />
<br />
He entered the room, and was greeted by the friendly doctor. He sat down and crossed his arms.<br />
<br />
“I don’t need anger therapy, okay?” he said.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I believe you. You’re just here because your doctor said, right?” Dr. Vetrias replied.<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah. I don’t need him to give me more shit. I have enough to fucking deal with already.”<br />
<br />
“That’s good. It’s good you listen to your doctors, Ethan. How about you listen to me, today? We’re going to do a technique called truth therapy today.”<br />
<br />
“I mean, I’ll listen as much as you want, but I’m not gonna work on anything because I don’t have a fucking anger issue. Can you even hear me?” Ethan asked, annoyed. What the fuck was this dipshit on?<br />
<br />
“I can hear you. It’s okay, we listen to each other. You always listen to your doctors, since you go so often.”<br />
<br />
“..how did you know that?” Ethan asked.<br />
<br />
“It’s very normal for men of your age to go to the doctor frequently.”<br />
<br />
“Men of my age?” Ethan asked, confused. “What the fuck are you talking about?” It was like the shrink was virtually trying to make him angry.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, we’ll get there. Now, I’m going to need you to strip naked, Ethan.”<br />
<br />
Ethan jolted back in his chair. “What the fuck? I am not doing that! Are you a fucking pervert? I’m getting the fuck out of here!” Ethan shouted, but Dr. Vetrias simply grinned as Ethan got out of his seat.<br />
<br />
“You are naked, already, Ethan.”<br />
<br />
Just like that, Ethan was naked. He looked down at himself and gasped. “How the.. fuck did you do that? You fucking pervert! I’m going to knock you the fuck out right here!”<br />
<br />
“You will do no such thing.”<br />
<br />
“I will do no such thing. Wait, no! I’m gonna..” Ethan tried to swing his hand for a punch, but found himself completely unable to move it with that intent.<br />
<br />
“You are not a violent man, Ethan.”<br />
<br />
“Of course I’m not violent, you fucking pervert. You’re lucky I’m not fucking violent because I’d love to..” Ethan wanted to say he’d smash the doctor’s face in, but the actual thought of doing so seemed so completely.. awful. It disgusted him. “Well.. I uh.. don’t know, but you’re pissing me off, you pervert!”<br />
<br />
“I assure you, I’m not a pervert. Besides, you’re not in shape anyway.”<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about I’m not in..” Ethan paused as he felt a pressure in his chest. He stopped to talk as he put his hand to his chest. His eyes bulged as he let out a massive burp. As he did, he started to grow bigger and fatter as his pectorals started to blub out and grow thick man boobs and his gut hung out a bit. His face swelled as he grew a double chin, becoming an obese man – not morbidly or obscenely, but certainly heavyset.<br />
<br />
Ethan blinked. “You did this to me! What the hell! I have to.. get out of here!” he found though that he could not move.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, Ethan,” Dr. Vetrias consoled the fat man, “You’ve been fact since you were a kid. And that was a very long time ago.”<br />
<br />
“No.. you mean..” Ethan stammered, “D-don’t..”<br />
<br />
“You’re sixty seven years old, Ethan.”<br />
<br />
Suddenly Ethan’s posture changed in the chair as his skin began to age and he started to feel.. different. Less energetic.<br />
<br />
“It’s harder to be angry and vicious when you’re old.” Dr. Vetrias said to Ethan, and fearfully Ethan found himself agreeing with the man! It didn’t feel worth it! But he knew he had to be mad at this man for what was happening to him..<br />
<br />
“Hmm, you’re looking the right age, but I don’t think you fit the aesthetic yet.” Dr. Vetrias said, mostly aloud to himself. He grinned. “I got it. You have very thick white body hair around your cock and on your moobs. And most men your age, yourself included, are bald.”<br />
<br />
Ethan, in a panic, reached his hands up to his scalp, and was only met with smooth, aged skin. He gasped as he looked down onto his fat chest as thick white body hair started to grow around his nipples. It felt sensitive. He cautiously reached one of his nipples and grabbed it, as his cock sprung to life.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you’re a nipples guy. Nipple play makes you very horny. You love to play with your nipples.”<br />
<br />
“Mmm...” Ethan moaned as he pulled his other hand down and started massaging his hairy chest, flicking at the nipple on his fat chest. He knew he should be angry, but this felt so good instead to be doing. The thought of it being inappropriate was entirely lost to him.<br />
<br />
“Now, how about you start masturbating while your thick white walrus mustache grows in? You’d like that a lot.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.. this feels so good..” Ethan said as thick white hairs grew over his lip. As he spoke, his voice got hoarser and more aged. He started playing with his cock.<br />
<br />
“Now, you’re going to start masturbating until you cum. You’re going to experience a weird shift in personality as you cum it out your cock. It’s going to be strong, but you won’t be able to stop masturbating because it’ll feel so good, and you have to do it. When you’re done, you won’t be angry anymore, and certainly won’t remember being the way you were.”<br />
<br />
As Ethan grunted, he realized fully what Dr. Vetrias was doing to him. The perverted shrink was turning him into an old man! Ethan wanted so desperately to flee. He still couldn’t think of decking the guy – violence was wrong, even if he knew he shouldn’t think that, but the sheer pleasure from playing with his cock was too great as he kept stroking and playing with his nipples.<br />
<br />
“Oh, and another thing. Your cock is going to shrink into a small size with little balls when you cum. It’ll be normal for you to have a small cock.”<br />
<br />
He gasped, and said “n-no..” but as he did he felt a jolt through his nipple and his complaint turned into a deep moan.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, don’t worry. A lot of men your age struggle with impotency. You’ll have a hard time getting erect and ejaculating after this. This one will feel amazing though, and you’ll forget all about being Ethan when you do.”<br />
<br />
Ethan grunted as he furiously jacked his cock despite his best intentions. He knew he couldn’t cum, it would be the end of him, but it felt so good. He upped the pace on his cock, and like a button, it began.<br />
<br />
He felt a kick in his balls as they started pulling upward, shrinking in size as the fluids began spurting from his cock. His eyes rolled back as his mind focused on the intensity of the orgasm. As he came, the pressure from the cum pushed back on his cock as it began to dwindle and shrivel, growing soft and small as it shrank into the forest of thick white curly pubes he had grown through the transformative process.<br />
<br />
As the cum hit the floor, it disappeared, as any record of Ethan’s DNA became nonexistent. Ethan slumped into the chair as his facial expression went completely blank, his mind completely devoid of his old personality that he was clinging so dearly to.<br />
<br />
Dr. Vetrias quickly gave the old man sitting in the chair a once over. He was a rotund fella, with lots of white hair in his man boobs and around his tiny cock. He didn’t look sickly, though, the white mustache and wrinkles made him look a strange combination of lively and timid. Docile, just as intended. It was unlikely the old man would ever be angry again.<br />
<br />
He was ready, Dr. Vetrias decided, as he stepped closer again. “Wake up, Ernest.” He said, as he tapped the old man on the forehead.<br />
<br />
The old man blinked to life as he sat up straight in the chair. He realized he felt cold, despite his chunky layering, and quickly realized he was naked. He pulled his hands to cover his small cock as he blushed, “I.. oh dear..” he murmured, his voice soft and gentle. “How did I get so indecently exposed.. I um... uh..”<br />
<br />
“That’s quite alright Ernest, just a side effect of our therapy session. You’re not going to tell anyone about this, and you’re going to think it’s completely normal. I have your clothing laid out right here for you.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, uh.. thank you Dr. Vetrias.. I don’t know what came over me, I’m..”<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, Ernest. Here, do you need me to help you get dressed?”<br />
<br />
“No, no, I’m.. quite okay, thank you. I’m sorry for the trouble.” Ernest said, as he hobbled over to the pile of clothing laid out on the desk. He slid on the extra large turtleneck, followed by large briefs which left no bulge at all, as his cock was too small to show, and pulled his khakis up above his waist to complete his look. A pair of thick diabetic socks and loafers went on his fat feet, and he put his eyeglasses on as the room came into vision.<br />
<br />
“How do you feel, Ernest?”<br />
<br />
“I, um..” he stammered. Dr. Vetrias intimidated him, if he had to be honest. He wasn’t sure why – Ernest was generally intimidated pretty easily but his therapist should be more comforting.. “I’m okay.” He said after a moment.<br />
<br />
“Okay, excellent. You’re going to go right home and fall right asleep as the world adjusts to the new you, okay?” Dr. Vetrias said, as an instruction.<br />
<br />
“Yes.. I’ll go right home..” Ernest replied, semi-robotically. “I.. um.. thank you.” He said, as he awkwardly stumbled out of the therapist’s room, dazed, much like the man Ethan had earlier seen leave Dr. Vetrias’ office.<br />
<br />
As the fat old man left, Dr. Vetrias crossed the name Ernest off his list. He’d done exactly right this time. Surely not by conventional means, but the man who came in certainly no longer had an anger problem. Dr. Vetrias readied himself to step out and call in his next client..</p>
