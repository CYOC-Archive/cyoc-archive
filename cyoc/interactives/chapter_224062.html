<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...not be given special treatment. I think I&#39;d be alright with them working for me though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tomoyo perked up a bit at that. If Curt-dono wouldn&#39;t see any large change in his life from the creation of these new goddesses, then maybe...? She silently thanked her mind-reading abilities for improving her persuasive abilities before opening her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then, about the other minor goddesses that would help bring order..?&quot; Darn. Even with her best efforts, she still sounded way too forward. There was absolutely no way that Curt-dono would give in now. Maybe she should try to get the new goddess of knowledge to help her out? Wait, maybe if all she needs is creativity then-<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait.<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;WHAT???&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Tomoyo realized that she was not the only one surprised by his acquiescence, although Skyla definitely had some anger mixed in there too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, should I have said no?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of cour-&quot;, Skyla blurted out at once, but Tomoyo knew she had to pounce. This was probably the only chance she&#39;d get to have her hands on the ray gun ever again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, hahaha, I just, you know, I didn&#39;t think that...&quot;, Tomoyo mumbled out despite—or maybe because of—the weight of the decision. Thankfully, Curt-dono came to her rescue yet again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t really see a problem with it. You seem to have been more responsible with it than anyone else so far,&quot; Skyla&#39;s tails drooped a bit at that, &quot;and I&#39;d hate to...well...destroy the universe or whatever. My one condition is that you take Skyla with you, just for a bit of oversight. You two seem like you might need a bit of some family bonding time regardless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Skyla and Tomoyo were quiet for a bit. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Skyla conceded, &quot;but only because I still don&#39;t entirely trust you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tomoyo smiled. That wasn&#39;t completely untrue, since Tomoyo&#39;s mind-reading revealed that Skyla was looking for a way to prove herself to Curt after what he said earlier, but of course, Skyla also just wanted to see some more transformations happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! Then, Curt-dono, if you could just add my name to the ID-lock permitted list, I&#39;ll be on my way!&quot; Tomoyo tried to mask her joy while saying that, but she gave up halfway through when she imagined herself creating some more goddesses.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
And so now that all of the pre-show stuff was done (including Curt getting a quick hug from Tomoyo that she took care into making sure he wouldn&#39;t get 12th degree burns from), our pair of adventurers are off! Tomoyo rattled off the list of goddesses that her new backstory told her she would need just to make sure that she remembered everything that she would do on her trip. First on the list...<br />
<br />
Tomoyo grabbed Skyla&#39;s hand, and the two were teleported to right outside a shabby-looking concrete building that seemed to be a ways away from anything that wasn&#39;t forest, but there was clearly some loud music playing from within the building. The two had been just about silent up until now, so Tomoyo decided to break the ice as they walked up to the front entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you excited to watch some transformations happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just here to supervise you.&quot; Tomoyo gave a bit of a smile at that, and gave a playful wink to her cousin. Skyla paused her gait. &quot;Can you...read minds?&quot; Tomoyo&#39;s smile widened a bit, as she continued walking towards the building until she &#39;heard&#39; something from within Skyla&#39;s mind that made her stop and turn around. Skyla&#39;s eyes widened, as her previous thoughts of &quot;please please please don&#39;t be a mind reader&quot; became &quot;don&#39;t think about anything lewd, especially about Curt&quot; which very quickly became...well, you know. Tomoyo decided to speak up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want me to turn it off? You are still Head Maid, which makes you my boss in some way. Oh, and my cousin too of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...You&#39;d do that? I thought you hated me after trying to stop you from getting the gun again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure! Just turned it off!&quot; Skyla had a look on her face that Tomoyo didn&#39;t need her abilities to know meant appreciation. &quot;Now, come on, let&#39;s go!&quot; The two entered the building and took in the scene of the rave: a punk-looking DJ blasting dubstep over speakers while lights flashed over the intense crowd below. Tomoyo aimed and fired at him, who continued to hype up the crowd as his transformation began.<br />
<br />
His mohawk remained, although the bald area around it grew black fur that started traveling down his body as his mohawk changed color from black to white. As the wave of fur moved down his head, his face pushed out a bit as the white stripe of fur traveled down to his nose that became squished and black, while the rest of his face slimmed up as it grew black fur everywhere else. The fur then moved from his neck to his chest, where he gained furry breasts that very quickly plumped up to a large size, pushing against his shirt that morphed into a standard maid&#39;s dress along with the rest of his clothes. His arms too gained black fur as hands became paws, still expertly working the turntable. The fur continued down towards his hips, pushing inwards as he gained yet more curves as the fur reached her legs, already having swapped her sex. A large black tail with a white stripe across it floofed behind her, and as the transformation finished with her feet and legs having transformed similarly to her arms, the headphones around her neck changed shape, as they now resembled a maid&#39;s headband. Sonna, the goddess of music and sound, but better known by her stage name DJ PunkSkunk, spotted Tomoyo in the crowd and gave her a subtle wave.<br />
<br />
Tomoyo turned to her now partner-in-crime. &quot;Wasn&#39;t that fun Skyla-chan?&quot; Skyla wanted to lie at first, but decided she&#39;d reward her cousin for giving up her mind reading ability with some honesty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! To our next goddess then.&quot; Skyla was surprised with how quickly Tomoyo grabbed her hand, but she had no time to say anything until they were at their next destination.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Now inside a nursery, the two took care not to wake up any of the sleeping babies, but unfortunately, one that happened to still be awake started to cry as Tomoyo entered the baby&#39;s vision. Skyla was able to hold in her amusement at Tomoyo&#39;s flusteredness, but as the rest of the babies began to wake up and cry as well, and as Tomoyo became more and more embarrassed at the mess she had made, Skyla saw no reason not to burst out laughing. Tomoyo was secretly overjoyed that she was able to make her cousin happy, but as the middle-aged nanny in charge of the room rushed in to see if anything was wrong, Tomoyo quickly blasted her.<br />
<br />
Patches of dark brown fur matching her hair color sprouted all across her body as her clothes completely disintegrated. She lost a bit of her height as her face became wrinkled and her mouth stretched into a slight, yet still goofy-looking, smile. Her hands and feet gained distinctive finger-like claws as her posture hunched over, which one might think would be due to how top-heavy she is now with her larger furry assets, but to tell the truth, she was just too tired to stand up straight. Oneira, the sloth-woman who acts as the goddess of sleep and dreams, greeted Tomoyo with a blink. At least, Tomoyo thought it might have been a greeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;This was you?&quot; She said uncomfortably slowly while gesturing around to the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry Oneira-chan!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I can handle it.&quot; And as Oneira used some of her magic to make the babies in the room sleepier, Skyla felt like she was about to fall asleep herself. Thankfully, Tomoyo grabbed her hand and the two were off again.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Now, as the two warped into some sort of dark basement, they observed a scraggly and unkempt looking man who likely hadn&#39;t been outside in quite some time as he turned away from the only light in the basement—his computer screen—towards the one that had just appeared alongside Skyla.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who-&quot;<br />
<br />
Tomoyo didn&#39;t miss her first shot, and the man instantly lost all of his body hair as his skin began to turn orange and his clothes disappeared into nothingness, revealing his rapidly-toning abs, quickly-growing breasts, and her swapped genitals. She unconsciously stood up from her sitting position to make room for her two pairs of hardened black wings to grow from the top of her back, as her eyes turned completely black like those of an insect. Her face then feminized, and two long antennas grew from the top of her head. While her arms and legs slimmed up and hardened, she grew an extra pair of similar arms halfway down her chest. Finally, her behind grew and grew until it suddenly lit up, the bulbous abdomen illuminating the basement with its bright yellow light.<br />
<br />
&quot;-did I piss off to bring you two here? I haven&#39;t had to do any goddess work in forever since Ammy-chan decided the Sun was gonna be so bright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Indeed, Lucia, the firefly anthro goddess of light and darkness, was perhaps a bit redundant, Tomoyo admitted to herself. She seemed to have found another way to keep herself busy, but Skyla was curious how much power she had over the other maids.<br />
<br />
&quot;So should I just tell Master that you&#39;re hanging around here, not helping anyone out?&quot; The message was clear to Lucia, who nervously left to head back to the mansion. Skyla smirked.<br />
<br />
The ray gun lit up with a message.<br />
<br />
“Congratulations on creating fifty (50) total anthro maids! Your Transformation Ray Gun has been upgraded to version 1.5! This upgrade introduces the “Hands Off” feature, as well as a message log.<br />
<br />
“Worried that your hand is a bit shaky in a crowded room? Or want to leave someone out of mass transformation while using the wide beam? Simply add them to the “Hands off” list in the new “Security Options” tab, with but a simple thought of the person’s name and face, and your mind can be at ease. If you change your mind about changing this person later, they can be removed, or re-added to the list at your discretion.<br />
<br />
“In addition, we have added a message log, allowing you to review any upgrades or rules regarding our product that you may have forgotten, or accidentally cleared before you could read them.<br />
<br />
“Your next upgrade is at one hundred (100) total maids created. Have a nice day.”<br />
<br />
Skyla knew that Anna would definitely want Kitty&#39;s name on there, but she struggled to think of anyone else that should be there. The two then warped to their next location.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Now observing a trial occurring from within a small courtroom, Tomoyo drew her attention towards the older-looking judge presiding over an identity theft case. She took out the ray gun and fired at the judge, noting how Skyla seemed to be getting more and more excited with each transformation.<br />
<br />
His white beard hairs fell out, as feathers colored a mix of brown and white took their place. The feathers spread out from there, covering his whole head as his nose and mouth merged and pushed into a yellowish beak, while the sclera of his eyes turned a similar color of yellowish. Meanwhile, light brown hair sprouted from his previously bald head, flowing down her back. His robes shifted as they turned into a maidified version, with white frills smattering them, while also allowing room for his arms that had turned into wings made up of the same feathers. It was difficult to tell, but feathers grew across his, or rather, her chest as two comically large breasts grew and pushed against her robes. Her legs became skinny, with two claws at the front and one at the back. <br />
<br />
As Justine, the goddess of order and justice, turned her owl head towards the defense attorney that was clearly grasping at straws in his defense of the defendant, Tomoyo was ready to head to her next location when Skyla pulled her hand away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on for a second. This ray gun can turn criminals into good people, I&#39;ve seen it with my own eyes. Maybe we can turn the defendant into someone more respectable?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it!&quot; Tomoyo handed her the gun, as Curt had also added Skyla&#39;s name to the ID-lock permitted list before they had left. Skyla aimed at the average-looking guy that seemed to be in his mid-twenties and-<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Do you not want me to shoot him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s just, as soon as you shoot him, there&#39;ll be no trial left since there&#39;s no criminal to charge, right? So what if we were to change someone else before then? The defense attorney seems to know he&#39;s arguing for a criminal just to get paid, so why not make him better too?&quot; Skyla thought for a bit about whether this was getting out of hand, but she had to admit that Tomoyo had a point. Conceding, Skyla aimed for the red-haired attorney who was currently speaking, set the settings to &#39;target&#39;s favorite,&#39; and fired.<br />
<br />
Just like Justine, feathers sprouted to replace his hair, although now it seemed to happen all at once as his entire body except for his face was now covered with red feathers, made clear by his clothes disappearing, making it clear that not only was the attorney now a she, but that she was also rapidly growing tailfeathers as her legs became similarly bird-like. The attorney shrank a bit as her face grew black feathers as her face pushed into an orange beak. Complete with red twintails, the now very cute cardinal attorney disappeared, as her new standards would never have let her take the current case. In her place, a new attorney took her place, which Skyla promptly fired at too.<br />
<br />
The blonde attorney was definitely good-looking by any standard, with a formal suit that morphed into something much less appropriate for her to wear in the courtroom, a two-piece maid set with a super frilly black and white skirt to match with a similarly designed top. Her face gained green scales as it became more of a snout. Her outfit allowed the kitsunes to watch the scales cover her stomach area, while her skirt allowed a long and tapering tail colored the same green to grow out. Her fingers and toes plumped out towards their ends, becoming sticky to the touch, while the arms and legs they&#39;re connected to become scaly as well. If it wasn&#39;t clear enough before, the lizard anthro faded out of the classroom as she opted to instead take a beach day. And...another attorney took her place. Not like Skyla wasn&#39;t hoping for that to happen.<br />
<br />
The nearly 7-foot attorney that took her place was not so great of an arguer, and instead relied on his height to intimidate his way through witnesses and juries. As Skyla fired at him, he grew &#39;shorter&#39; in a way, as the bottom half of his body merged into a sand-colored and scaly tail, pushing out behind her (as her genitals had been swapped) as her torso and head now came lower to the ground. The scales continued to move up her body, her suit vanishing as the scales moved up her body. She grew petite breasts along the way as her face pushed out to accommodate her now black and forked tongue, while the scales finished their takeover of the attorney&#39;s skin. The lamia-like snake girl vanished too from the courtroom, with another attorney in her place attempting to defend his client. Skyla fired at him but unfortunately, he was a father. She turned her attention to the prosecutor. Why not, right?<br />
<br />
The more experienced prosecutor that was probably in his 30s first had his head completely reform itself, with a snout pushing out as his face became more feminine, while his balding head received a gift of luscious black hair that formed itself into a ponytail behind his head. His face, and soon the rest of his body, was being covered in a tawny colored fur, with black spots dotting across it. He grew a tail of similar coloring, accommodated by his suit, which had transformed into some kind of cross between suit and maid outfit. Of course, it also accommodated her new cleavage and sex. Her arms and legs grew fur down them, ending at paws. Back to her face, her nose became cat-like and whiskers grew out from it, as the new busty jaguar prosecutor would give her all to get to the truth.<br />
<br />
Tomoyo seemed pretty happy at watching Skyla enjoy herself, and didn&#39;t try to stop her as she took aim at the stenographer that was madly typing away.<br />
<br />
The stenographer always wished she had more arms to be able to type faster. Her 6 arms were plenty, sure, but she could do without the suction cups she had at the end of each her tentacular limbs. She did love their red color though, although now that she thought about it, her entire body was red and smooth. What a strange thought that was! <br />
<br />
As Skyla observed the bright red octopus anthro&#39;s hair turn from white to a similar red, she turned her attention towards the jury. Two of the members weren&#39;t even paying attention! She knew she could fix them, and for the other seven members, well, she didn&#39;t really have a good excuse. But she wanted to get her transformation fix, damn it! She shot them all, disappointed that two of the older men on the juries were fathers.<br />
<br />
The first who wasn&#39;t paying attention was a young man who was ogling the prosecutor and judge. As his skin grew black and yellow fluff, his clothes disappeared to make way for two transparent wings to grow behind him. As her sex changed, a signature yellow and black striped stinger grew behind her, with her arms and legs both becoming hardened and thin, taking a black color. The bee-girl&#39;s transformation finished with her eyes becoming all cute and beady and with two feelers growing on her head.<br />
<br />
The other slacker was a woman who couldn&#39;t bring herself to look at anything other than the clock on the wall. Her skin became white with black splotches as her breasts grew while they filled up with milk. Her fingers and toes merged together and gained a black color as they became hooves. Her clothes vanished, letting loose a tail with a blonde-haired tip, same color as her hair. The cow woman now seemed to be less distracted, although forgetting to milk herself still wasn&#39;t ideal for her concentration.<br />
<br />
As for the rest, a man who was clearly at least in his eighties had his white hair sink into his skin, becoming white fur that quickly took over his body, rejuvenating him as it traveled between her legs, and as her formerly frail legs became powerful kickers. Her old-timey outfit became a lot more casual, as the black and white frilly miniskirt and leggings combined with a similarly maidy crop-top accentuated her new curves and massive breasts. The now 20-year old knockout woman had her furry ears pulled up to the top of her head and beyond, stretching out. Her face pushed out to become one of a rabbit&#39;s as she grew the telltale cottonball tail.<br />
<br />
The next juror was a single mother whose dirty blonde hair pulled in, as seemingly spread itself all over her body. As her face grew out similarly to that of the prosecutor&#39;s, her ears moved up to became cute little nubs. Her clothing vanished as a similarly uniform color lioness tail pushed out, and she gained cat-like paws. The cute lioness&#39; daughter had a similar transformation at school, with her tawny fur replacing her clothing and her tail grew out as the lioness cub anthro played with her classmates.<br />
<br />
The next two women could not have looked more different, but had very similar transformations. The spitting image of an adolescent &quot;horse-girl&quot; had her ears grow to points and migrate to the top of her head as they grew brown hair. The elderly black woman next to her had pitch-black hair grow all over her body right after her similarly horse-like ears, and both of their clothes disappeared. Their faces became horse snouts as the space between their noses and mouths filled in, with their respective hair colors covering the rest of their faces and necks. Horse-girl&#39;s chestnut hair grew down her back, as the elderly woman&#39;s white hair turned black as she grew a mane of her own. As tails sprouted with hair color matching their manes, they both had their hands and feet reform to black hooves. To finish their transformation, while the elderly woman had her age turned down to match that of the horse-girl (although I suppose they&#39;re now both horse-girls), they both had muscle build up all over their bodies, with something else filling up their breasts. The two could now be mistaken for sisters with their similar busty build and shared love for their Master.<br />
<br />
Finally, the last guy had his clothes transform into a standard maid outfit as he quickly lost height, coming out to just about 4 feet tall as white, orange, and black fur grew all over his body. As he gained a tail, paws, and a new gender, her ears pulled up to become cat ears, as the calico anthro finished her transformation with her face scrunching up to become incredibly cute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I didn&#39;t think you had it in you.&quot; Tomoyo speaking completely startled Skyla, who became bashful as she realized just how many people she&#39;s transformed. Although, if she had the chance to do it again...&quot;Do you wanna zap the defendant and get out of here then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right! I almost forgot that that was the goal.&quot; With a ton more determination than last time she did so, Skyla turned her aim towards the defendant and fired.<br />
<br />
The middle-aged man&#39;s clothes morphed into a set similar to that of the calico-girl&#39;s, and his tanned skin began to toughen up and become green. Small protrusions of bone formed down along his back, until they reached his tailbone, about where the toughened skin had swapped her sex, and a tapered, yet still meaty, tail grew out from behind her. Her arms and legs became noticeably stubbier as they became thicker as well. She gained a small hourglass figure as her hips pinched inward and her scaly breasts grew quite large. Finally, after her short brown hair grew down to her neck, her scaly face pushed outward hard, ending in a rounded snout with sharp alligator teeth lining the inside of it.<br />
<br />
Tomoyo could barely pull herself from watching Skyla&#39;s satisfied face as she watched everyone in the courtroom fade away as the trial ceased to exist. Tomoyo held out her hand. Skyla took it, and the two were off again.</p>
