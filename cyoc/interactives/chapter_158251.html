<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mia quickly exited the nurse station, and made a stop over in the bathroom to clean up. This wasn&#39;t too involved despite the quantity of cum the virile lion had pumped into her. Ever since catching Femboy (and doing a lot more catching herself), she found after sex her back door seemed to lock down to hold the cum inside.<br />
<br />
Sam had a good idea where to find Mia, the fashionista and drama queen would be somewhere around the auditorium.<br />
<br />
This end of the building was fairly busy, the sterilization of the building was costing the school play a day of rehearsal and set construction when the auditorium would be done tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Plenty of human students (and one minotaur), but a few lions here as well. She had better control physically this time, but the lustful thoughts clouded her mind ever time she came near one.<br />
<br />
As she looped outside, she caught sight of a girl sitting alone on a bench. She was clearly mid Gay Pride transformation. Her legs had gotten the most attention, low digitigrade with huge paws. Her calves and thighs were bulging with muscle, cream colored fur covering them from the knee down. She had a tablet in her lap, positioned to partially conceal the erection tenting there.<br />
<br />
She was wearing in a short yellow sleeveless dress, oblivious to the chill in the air. From the waist up, there were few signs of infection. Her face was unchanged, though her honey blonde hair was a wild mass flowing over her shoulders and around her neck. It wouldn&#39;t be long until it extended down to her chest and completed the trademark mane.<br />
<br />
Sam sat down beside her. &#39;I&#39;m sorry to bother you, I&#39;m with the CDC team sterilizing the building. Can we talk for a bit. My name&#39;s Sam.&#39; She showed her CDC credentials, with her youthful looks thanks to Femboy, she had problems with people not believing her unless she flashed ID.<br />
<br />
The girl&#39;s face went pale, she seemed petrified with fear and trying not to show it. Sam understood and mentally placed a bet on voluntary infection and a friend of one of the original infected cheerleaders.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ok. Sure. I&#39;m Lauren.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;it&#39;s OK Lauren, you can relax. We&#39;re here at the request of the school to cover them from lawsuits, not digging into the lives of the students. Everyone knows there are a good number of voluntary cases here, and I don&#39;t want to send a bunch of horny teenagers to jail. Anything you tell me is confidential. Do you know how you got infected?&#39;<br />
<br />
There was a long silence, and a glance down at Sam&#39;s own erection. The CDC worker&#39;s subconscious was role playing out submitting to another strapping lion, keeping things ready down there.<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes, but I don&#39;t want to talk here. I know a spot.&#39;<br />
<br />
She led the way back into the building, to a long stairwell behind the auditorium. It led up into a storage loft above the stage. Pieces of old sets, furniture of all kinds, and a mountain of spare lighting equipment cluttered the area. The only significant open space was around a large trap door in the floor.<br />
<br />
Lauren led them over to an old sofa.<br />
<br />
&#39;Sorry, a lot of this is an open secret around school, but I still don&#39;t want anyone listening in.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes, I know when I was infected, it was last Saturday. I woke up Sunday morning with stained sheets, morning wood, and all this hair in my face. I had a pixie cut a week ago.&#39;<br />
<br />
Sam was impressed, Gay Pride transformations were usually a few days, accelerating the more the victim orgasmed. Lauren must have spectacular willpower to stretch it out this long.<br />
<br />
&#39;How do you know it was Saturday? Remember, this is confidential.&#39; Sam slid closer and smiled, trying to use her boyish charm to get Lauren to tell her story&#39;<br />
<br />
It worked. <br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m in a open relationship with by boyfriend Rob. He&#39;s bi... Or at least he was... and Rob has a boyfriend as well - Dante.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Rob and I were just hanging out watching Netflix. He&#39;d seemed off, I could see he had a boner but he didn&#39;t want to make out. I ignored it for a while, but I noticed his hair was growing.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I called him out on it, and he confessed. Dante had been invited to join the Pride, and the night before when the two of them were having their date night, Dante started changing. They uh... they fucked and Rob got infected.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I was stupid, and all I could think of was that I was losing Rob and that he was turning completely gay right in front of me. I asked to be infected so we could stay together.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;We fucked, I tried riding him cowgirl (his favorite), but it took a while. I don&#39;t think he was into girls at all, and was only capable because of Gay Pride keeping him hard at all times. I gave up, and told him to lean back and close his eyes. I told him to let his mind roam and fantasize about anything he wanted. I went down on him, doing by best to make it the perfect blowjob. It uh... worked.<br />
<br />
&#39;When he came, the change kicked in more. He had been moaning, but it changed to a roar. When I looked up, his head was fully changed; muzzle, mane, and all.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;As I said, I woke up Sunday morning with cumstained sheets and morning wood. My parents freaked and I&#39;ve been fighting this all week to convince them I don&#39;t really want this.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;But I do. It was impulsive but I think I&#39;m going to really like this.&#39;<br />
<br />
Lauren leaned closer looked deep into Sam&#39;s eyes. Sam could see brown fading to yellow as she watched. A hand slid down the couch and squeezed Sam&#39;s soft backside. This girl was almost a week overdue in changing, she was a feline testosterone bomb waiting to go off. Judging by the size of her paws, Lauren&#39;s new self was going to be huge even by Gay Pride standards.</p>
