<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adira looked at Jedina and Ric. Jedina wouldn't make a good follower since she didn't have the needed seed of evil she required but she would make a good sacrifice. Now Ric on the other hand did have the necessary seed within him. She wouldn't have been able to use him to free herself if he didn't. The only problem was that he was a boy. That would have to be fixed. She picked up the Book of Transformations and read one of the spells.<br />
<br />
The first thing that happened was Ric's dick shrank down and pulled inside his body. His balls pulled into his body leaving his ball sack empty which shrank forming the lips of his new sex. As soon as it was completely formed it moved down to between his legs. His nipples became larger and breast buds formed which rapidly grew to a C cup. His whole body slimmed while his hips widened a bit. His face took on a more feminine shape as his body shrank. His hair grew out to his waist while his remaining body hair vanished.<br />
<br />
Ric was now a thirteen year old girl. Since Adira didn't change her personality she would remember who she was. Adira turned her attention to Jedina and changed her personality back to Josh. She then regressed her back to twelve years old. Josh's breasts shrank down and all that was left was slightly bigger than they would have been otherwise. Apparently Josh was a late bloomer even as a girl. All the body hair she had vanished as she shrank. Her hips and waist went back to a prepubescent state.<br />
<br />
Now with both of them transformed Adira turned her attention to making a holding cell she would need for the three sacrifices she would need to attain her full power. That meddlesome wizard had trapped her in his Book of Transformations before she could carry out the third sacrifice. She vowed not to let that happen this time. She searched Francisco's memories and found the perfect spot, a room in the basement that had been rumored to have been a holding cell for slaves. She said a spell and a dark vapor emitted from her body and traveled to the room making it suitable to hold the sacrifices. She realized that someone may hear screams for help coming from the house and so put a sound barrier around the house so no sound would escape.<br />
<br />
Now it was time to wake the two girls up. Adira uttered the counter spell and Josh and Ric both sat bolt upright. They looked at each other and asked in unison &quot;What the hell!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Allow me to explain&quot; Adira said. &quot;My name is Adira and you freed me from the Book of Transformations Ric. You should have listened to Josh and stopped what you were doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Mr. Mendes?&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Francisco Mendes no longer exists&quot; Adira said. &quot;Now you may be wondering what I want. It's really simple. I want to rule the world and have my revenge on the wizard who trapped me in the book millennia ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't a millennia a thousand years?&quot; Ric asked. &quot;How could the wizard still be alive?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His life force vastly dwarfs your own&quot; Adira said. &quot;This allows him to live a very long time. He's still in the prime of his life. He's still strong and will try to trap me in the book again. That's where you two come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what do you mean?&quot; Josh asked clearly afraid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well for right now you're not that important Josh&quot; Adira said. &quot;Ric however will be a follower of mine, adding to my strength until I can perform three sacrifices. These sacrifices must take place on the night of the Summer Solstice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's only a month away&quot; Ric said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right&quot; Adira said. &quot;I need thirteen followers and three sacrifices in order to gain my full power.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't become one of your followers&quot; Ric said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't either&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you don't have what it takes to be one of my followers Josh&quot; Adira said. &quot;Ric does and she will become one of my followers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't your followers have to choose to follow you of their own free will?&quot; Ric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes they do&quot; Adira said. &quot;That's why I didn't change your personality like you did Josh and Francisco.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I don't see how you'll get me to be one of your followers&quot; Ric said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you will be one of my followers&quot; Adira said. &quot;You have a lust for power deep within you. It was this lust for power that freed me. As one of my followers you'll have all the power that you could ever want as long as I remain free and alive. Of course if that's not enough for you I can always turn you into a pig and eat you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ric's face went white as she fully comprehended what Adira had just said. It would be bad enough dieing as a human but to die as a pig and be eaten, well she didn't want that. &quot;Wh-what about my b-brother?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean your sister&quot; Adira said. &quot;She's one of the sacrifices of course. I know your lust for power will enable you to get past that silly notion of family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not a silly notion&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure it is&quot; Adira said. &quot;All family is is kids following their parents. You follow someone almost throughout your entire life from birth to death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our Mom loves us!&quot; Ric said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may seem that way&quot; Adira said. &quot;She doesn't really love you. Why else would she go away for the Summer? She just see's you as a burden.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THAT'S NOT TRUE!&quot; Josh shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it is&quot; Adira said. &quot;Ric knows the truth. That's how she was able to... what's the modern word?... oh yes... fuck you. She knows that family and love is an illusion. There's only power, those willing to seek it, and those too afraid to seek it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You make... sense&quot; Ric said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't be serious Ric!&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am serious&quot; Ric said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew you would say that&quot; Adira said. &quot;Before you become my follower though you need a new name. I think your new name will be... Inbal. It means 'tongue of a bell' in Hebrew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it&quot; Inbal said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Josh, I think your new name will be... Yehudit&quot; Adira said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of name is that!?!&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Jewish and it means 'woman from Judea' in Hebrew&quot; Adira said. &quot;My name means 'powerful, mighty, splendid' in Hebrew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good name for you&quot; Inbal said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Inbal I need you to repeat after me&quot; Adira said. &quot;I, Inbal, pledge my loyalty to Adira. My blood, strength, and life are her's to do with as she pleases.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I, Inbal, pledge my loyalty to Adira&quot; Inbal said. &quot;My blood, strength, and life are her's to do with as she pleases.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now to mark you as one of my followers&quot; Adira said. &quot;Since you were the one who released me I'll let you decide where I put it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Adira&quot; Inbal said. &quot;Please put it above my right breast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A good choice&quot; Adira said. &quot;Now prepare yourself since this will hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adira touched Inbal just above her right breast. She screamed and fell to her knees as Adira's mark burned white hot upon her skin. Once it fades a raised scar in the shape of Adira's mark stood out on her skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may rise Inbal&quot; Adira said. &quot;You are the first of my new followers and you shall serve me well. Of this I have no doubt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May I ask what happened to your previous followers?&quot; Inbal asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were killed one by one by the wizard who trapped me in the book&quot; Adira said. &quot;He had tried to free them from their oath to me but I was too strong for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would he free or kill them?&quot; Inbal asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My followers give me strength&quot; Adira said. &quot;He couldn't trap me while I had all my followers. Even with just you following me now he can't trap me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this wizards name?&quot; Inbal asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;His name is Hamon&quot; Adira said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where can we find him?&quot; Inbal asked. &quot;We should get rid of him before he has a chance to stop you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know where he is&quot; Adira said. &quot;Though you can be sure that he will turn up. Now why don't we put Yehudit into the holding cell so we can go find more followers and the other two sacrifices.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; Inbal said.<br />
<br />
As Inbal and Adira moved closer to Yehudit she said &quot;Don't do this Ric! I'm your brother!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am no longer Ric&quot; Inbal said. &quot;I am Inbal. You are not my brother but a female who just happens to have the same pro-creators as me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adira and Inbal grabbed Yehudit and dragged her kicking and screaming down to the holding cell. They laughed evilly as they threw her in and closed the door.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Many miles away in a tiny town in North Dakota on the American-Canadian border an old man is unpacking some boxes in a basement lit by candles.<br />
<br />
&quot;RICK!&quot; the old man shouted. &quot;DID YOU PACK MY BOOK OF TRANSFORMATIONS!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
A man in his thirties came into the room and said &quot;I packed it in with the rest of your spell books Hamon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's not here&quot; Hamon said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that I packed it in there&quot; Rick said. &quot;It has to be in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It has to be&quot; Rick said as he came over to look for himself. As he did he noticed something about the box that caught his attention. &quot;The box has been re-taped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone cut it open, took out the book, and re-taped the box. You can see that the second piece is off a little bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You packed it like I said?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. Third book from the bottom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That means whoever removed it knew which book they wanted. This is catastrophic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's bad but I don't think it's catastrophic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't understand&quot; Hamon said dropping his head and shaking it. &quot;That book contained the spirit of an evil witch who was very close to being able to rule the world. If she has been released then she will try again. It's time for us to take our true forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't remember because I suppressed your memories but you are my sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you've spent too much time reading by candlelight. I'm not a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I transformed you millennia ago to keep you safe. I had made some powerful enemies and I didn't want them coming after you. Over the years you had grown up like any other human and 'died'. You didn't truly die but where transformed into a baby boy and sent to a family. Each life you found me and I taught you. Each time you grew more proficient in magic. I knew that I would have to tell you this one day but I was hoping that it wouldn't be till your next cycle or the one after that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're scaring me Hamon. I think you need to see someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've seen me do transformations before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes but I can't be your sister. You told me that your sister disappeared long ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true from a certain point of view&quot; Hamon said chuckling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't go getting all Obi-Won on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a sense my sister did disappear since I transformed her into you. As far as the world was concerned you just disappeared.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then if I'm your sister transform me back. You would owe it to me as my brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will&quot; Hamon said with a sigh. &quot;Prepare yourself for the onslaught of memories that will come.&quot; He chanted a couple of spells and a golden glow surrounded both of them. Hamon quickly regressed losing the wrinkles of old age. His body regained some of the muscle he had lost due to old age. He was able to stand up straight once again and his beard and hair shortened a bit and became silver.<br />
<br />
Rick's change was more radical. He lost some height and his hair grew down to his butt. His whole body slimmed except for his hips which widened a bit. His dick grew smaller and pulled into his body along with his balls. His now empty ball sack formed the lips of his new sex and it slid down to between his legs. Breasts began to form on his chest and grew till they were a B cup. His hair changed from brown to silver and his eyes changed from hazel to electric blue. He looked at himself in amazement and then millennia of memories flooded in and he fainted.<br />
<br />
Hamon was able to catch Rick before he hit the floor and carried her over to a cot. He took off her clothes and put on a modern pair of panties and bra. From a chest he took out a robe like the one he was wearing and put it on her.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later Rick woke up and said &quot;It's about time you returned me to my thirteen year old body Hamon.&quot; She smiled and said &quot;I see you kept my old robes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I did Orli&quot; Hamon said with a grin. &quot;You didn't expect me to leave them to rot did you? They and your sword were the only things I had to remind me of you during those years we were separated. Oh how I longed to tell you the truth and return you but I didn't think you were ready yet. I'm not sure if you're ready now but we have a better chance of stopping Adira before she makes her first sacrifice and we have to kill her followers in order to trap her again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we should begin immediately&quot; Orli said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so fast&quot; Hamon said putting up his hand. &quot;You need some clothes so we can travel in secret. How do the undergarments fit? I tried to find ones that would fit you throughout the millennia just in case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They fit pretty well actually&quot; Orli said raising her hands to her breasts. &quot;You did good Hamon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, I'll go get you some more clothes fit for a girl of your age in this time. Stay here and practice your sword skills. You haven't used them since the Crusades.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Orli said getting off the cot and retrieving her sword from the chest. She began practicing as Hamon left the basement to by some clothes for her.</p>
