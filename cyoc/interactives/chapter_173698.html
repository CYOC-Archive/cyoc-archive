<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Teddy dreamed, his imagination usually got the better of him, making the dream very whimsical. He often fought dragons or hordes of evil monsters alongside Jack. The imaginary world would shift from one daring scene to the next, but this night, his dream was different. He instead found himself seated next to his brother at the dining room table, wearing their matching outfits. Every birthday since infancy, he and Jack dressed alike. It was a tradition they established amongst themselves, and that day was no different. Teddy wore a pair of jeans with a red and blue plaid shirt, making himself and his brother look nearly indistinguishable. They were mirror images of each other, so only their leather band watches were the only article of clothing not exactly identical. Teddy was right-handed and wore his watch on that hand, while Jack did the opposite. Their birthday cake sat on the table in front of them with two candles, a one and eight. Teddy&#39;s and his brother&#39;s smiling family sat around the table. The only thing that gave away the scene as a dream rather than a true memory was the candles. They appeared to shine far more brightly than they did that morning. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you guys going to wish for?&quot; Stevie, his younger brother of 12, asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If they say their wish, it won&#39;t happen.&quot; El, his sister of 15, wagged her finger at Stevie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blow out your candles before they melt.&quot; His mother said, smiling in spite of her tiredness. She worked graveyard shifts to support the family since their father had suddenly passed. Many birthdays and holidays became morning celebrations as a result. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is weird...&quot; Teddy spoke aloud, at the same time as his twin. He turned to look at his equally surprised brother. It was not unusual for them to speak at the same time as he and Jack shared many ideas and interests. It was odd that his brother seemed to also be reliving this same moment, sharing a dream. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re here too?&quot; Jack questioned.<br />
<br />
Teddy nodded. &quot;Wow... we&#39;ve never shared a dream before.&quot; They had both remembered having similar daring dreams, but they had never experienced sharing the same one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now is the hour of your birth.&quot; A voice, not belonging to any of their family, spoke. &quot;Silently state your wishes and and blow out the candles. For them to be granted, they must be simple and true.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...state your wishes and blow out the candles.&quot; Teddy repeated aloud. He turned to look at Jack again. His twin appeared more pale in the eerie candlelight. A reminder of the disease they both inherited from their sickly father. Making it to 18 was a feat in and of itself, as they too were destined to die young. <br />
<br />
&quot;...must be simple and true.&quot; Jack spoke the last words of advice from this disembodied voice. <br />
<br />
Teddy closed his eyes. There as only one wish he wanted granted, just like he had silently prayed for that morning. He just hoped it was simple as the voice had recommended. &#39;I wish Jack was cured.&#39; he silently stated and blew out the candles at the same time as his brother. Everything went black. He sensed his brother standing beside him in the darkness. He intuitively reached out and clasped hands with his twin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your wishes are true desires but not so simple.&quot; The voice spoke through the darkness. &quot;However, they can be granted if you are willing to sacrifice...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Teddy and Jack spoke together, cutting the voice off. &quot;I would do anything to save my brother!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Very well...&quot; The voice paused for a moment. &quot;They say twins are stronger together. To make your wishes come true, you will have to resemble that remark.&quot; <br />
<br />
Before he had a chance to ask what the voice meant, everything became white. &quot;Ahhh!&quot; Teddy&#39;s eyes flew open and he hastily sat up. He breathed hard, &quot;Did that really happen?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think so?&quot; Jack spoke from beside him, similarly out of breathe. &quot;It felt so real...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re... cured?&quot; He was hesitant to speak it out loud, thinking that his wish may be taken back. But, Teddy did feel healthier, stronger. He no longer felt the typical morning aches and lack of energy. Without a shadow of a doubt, he knew that their wishes had been fulfilled. Teddy let himself fall backwards, and his twin fell beside him. &quot;We&#39;re actually cured!&quot; <br />
<br />
His excitement began to wane as he noticed some peculiarities. After staring a the ceiling of their bedroom, Teddy realized that he was no longer in his bed, but lying on the carpet in the center of the room. A mess of sheets and blankets surrounded them. When they were younger, Teddy, more often than Jack, would crawl into bed with his brother if he was scared. Typically, that occurred during terrible thunderstorms, but neither had done that since they were kids. And, they sure never slept on the floor beside each other. <br />
<br />
Teddy lifted his right hand to his face, realizing with a start that he could not feel his left hand. He could not feel left leg. &quot;Jack...&quot; He rotated his head towards his brother, whom had done the same. His brother was too close, and shared the same worried expression. &quot;On three we sit up...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One... two... three...&quot; Jack said aloud and their rose on the third count. <br />
<br />
Around them, the room was a mess. Sheets from both of their beds laid strewn across the floor, pulled towards them. The matching pj bottoms they had worn to bed that night lied on the carpet on either side of them, shredded. However, Teddy&#39;s attention was immediately drawn elsewhere. He and Jack sat together in the middle of the carpet, only one body between them.</p>
