<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>In keeping with Animalia&#39;s existing cannon... and a lot of real life details surrounding when schools let out, it is now late May in Animalia. As NO school in the US ends its school year in the first two weeks of May, unless they have either very few or very short breaks during the course of the school year. And this especially apply for major colleges as well. Seniors may graduate sometime around May 15* but underclassmen will go longer... closer to the end of the month.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the actual TF isn&#39;t shown... but the marker is there to fit with descriptions what has changed when Mister M&#39;s friends come back from their conversions.<br/>
<br/>
*Also, I apologize for having to edit an author&#39;s note. The calendar I used was provided by the American Legion, and they have May 15 marked as &quot;Peace Officers Memorial Day&quot; and I misread it as &quot;Peace Officers, Memorial Day&quot; as though there were two holidays on the same day.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, you&#39;re all ready?&quot; Mister M asked to his friends Quintus, Victor, Paula, Ulysses, Stella, and Selena as they met up outside Dino City&#39;s Horizon office.<br />
<br />
Mister M didn&#39;t necessarily need to be there, as he&#39;d long since converted, but these were old friends from his past and they had asked him to be there. As such he came for support and to help with the step-by-step process that related the final forms and what Horizon required. It wouldn&#39;t be hard, but it would be involved and could be complicated if no one paid attention, which was something Mister M remembered from when he filled out the forms to become a Carcharodontosaurus Dinotopian. His friends would deserve any help they needed, and Horizon likely wouldn&#39;t have their staff members help with those forms in order to avoid any potential issues of coercion on their part.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, finally ready,&quot; Quintus gave a chuckle remembering that they&#39;d first reunited with Mister M back on Easter after they&#39;d moved into Dino City and that it was now May 25, 2022, and many of the schools were now letting out as they reached the end of May. &quot;Some things proved a bit costlier than expected and figuring out what things we&#39;d need to get for Dinotopian sizes took a little asking around. Though for me, Luke and Marjorie were quite helpful with how they&#39;ve handled things built for Humans and what they&#39;ve kept from that size range... and what they need for their mass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re not fat, are they?&quot; Paula teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... Marjorie might have the most fat tissue between them, BUT  pretty much all of it is in her breasts and butt, and its&#39; firm, not flab,&quot; Quintus answered, &quot;She has to be in the L to M range, I think... and she says that the Jen the Brachiosaurus Dinotopian is even bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s why you went for a Sauropod,&quot; Victor teased, &quot;you then find a woman who&#39;ll join you and grow giant breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d imagine that everything on a Dinotopian... at least those on the bigger species would be giant,&quot; Quintus answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But not every Dinotopian is giant,&quot; Selena commented, &quot;I waited so that we all went together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mister M noted the few chuckles that came from that. Of the group, nearly all of them picked relatively big animals. Quintus picked Apatosaurus, which could be over 70 feet long. Victor had gone with Triceratops, which could get up to 29 feet long. Paula had picked Edmontosaurus, which could get up to 43 feet long, and depending on the debate over whether or not Anatotitan was its own species or a synonym for a specific species of Edmontosaurus, could even get up to 49 feet long. Ulysses had gone with Spinosaurus, which could be up to 52 feet long. Stella had chosen Allosaurus, which could be up to 43 feet long, depending on the specific species, though the most common Allosaurus, Allosaurus Fragilis maxed out at 32 feet long. All of them would be big, and with Quintus, and Ulysses becoming Dinotopians that would be bigger than him and Paula had picked one that might be shorter than him in length but might be comparable in weight. The only one of them that had picked one of the smaller dinosaurs was Selena, who&#39;d chosen Compsognathus, which would only be just under 5 feet long. <br />
<br />
They went in and began to go through the process of filling out the appropriate forms. Mister M moved between them as they went about filling them out, though there wasn&#39;t too much difficulty. The biggest thing then came with questions over names and what name to rely on. It surprised Mister M that some of them might have used old stage names rather than their actual names, but he wasn&#39;t going to question it, as while &quot;Mister M&quot; was more of a new nickname, he&#39;d gone buy it since his own conversion so it wasn&#39;t like he could really complain. He advised that it would be best to put the stage name given as an &quot;alias&quot; and put their proper names in the listings. There was ultimately no problem as Horizon didn&#39;t have any issue and that then lead to them moving from the main lobby to the waiting room where they would wait as each of them was collected to go in for their conversions.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s amazing how they&#39;ve put in these adjusting chairs here,&quot; Ulysses commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... they may always have concerns that things like today come up,&quot; Mister M answered, &quot;Either someone who is already a Dinotopian comes in, or a pair comes in and become different Dinotopians as you all did. That would then mean that those of us that are bigger will need them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though not all will need them,&quot; came Selena&#39;s voice and making them all turn right to note her return, since she had gone first.<br />
<br />
They looked to see her there, and she was at about the same height she was before, though now with slightly longer legs coming from her three toed digitigrade feet. She wore a plain tee-shirt and a pair of sports shorts, but they didn&#39;t fully hide that she now sported the fine and muscular curves that practically every Animalian had. Though, unlike Compy, who retained the feather coloring of what he&#39;d had as a rooster before his conversion/uplifting, Selena&#39;s feathers were a bit more uniform. They were thin and primitive when compared to the feathers of many modern birds, but Mister M could see that they covered the around her eyes and behind her mouth, her hands and part of her forearm, and her feet up to just above the ankles. There her skin had a soft pinkish scaled texture, though on her moderately narrow muzzle, the scales were a bit more robust. The color of the feathers was also largely dull mix of tan brown and olive green, that at a distance looked almost muddy, but from one eye, Mister M also noted ring like stripes on the back of Selena&#39;s neck that were a darker color and then had alternating bands of that darker color and a greyish white going down the tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Victor&#39;s also done,&quot; Selena spoke, &quot;but he&#39;s still getting into his clothes, &quot;he looks like the male Triceratops Dinotopian that was in the Hunter Games in Dino City.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes sense,&quot; Mister M commented as Jeremy collected Quintus and Paula and lead them off toward the conversion rooms, &quot;You look good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I feel good,&quot; Selena answered, &quot;I might have to alter a few bits of my script that I&#39;d written in... or at least see if this Compy would want to do one shot... given that I doubt I&#39;m going to fit anything but a comparatively sized male... or maybe a Human if there&#39;s one that would be willing to go for a Dinotopian.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could be surprised,&quot; Mister M commented, as Victor came back, largely with coloring that mirrored Dino City&#39;s other male Triceratops Dinotopian, Trenton, &quot;and so long as it isn&#39;t for breeding... Animalia&#39;s edicts would allow for interspecies dating. If a Human does go for it... conversion would only be required if you two then decide on a family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There will be a lot of fun that can be done with all this,&quot; Victor commented, &quot;and not just adult entertainment... with enough guys now, M here might have a body building competition. Show how ripped everyone is too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could work,&quot; Mister M commented, &quot;but a lot of that will be up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
They continued pleasantly chatting while waiting for Jeremy to come back with Quintus and Paula. As was the case with Selena and Victor, Paula was the first to return. Unlike the actual animal, which many paleontologists felt had its forelimbs essentially having the fingers inside a mitten-like structure that would let the nails function like hooves on modern mammals, Paula retained her fingers, though there was some webbing that ran between the fingers coming up to the first finger joint from the palm of the hand. Her beak, had less of the ducklike look when looked at in profile as it went straight forward from her eyes and then arched down, though when looking down on it from the top, the beak did look a bit more duck like. Her scales were largely a forest green, but there were sea green patches on the small crest on the top of her head and on her beak, and there were bright yellow-orange spots that ran down her tail, and Mister M also noticed some raised scales running down the tail&#39;s dorsal side.<br />
<br />
Quintus was absolutely massive when he returned, at least when compared to the others. He was smaller than Andrew and Jen, and even Luke and Marjorie when compared to Dino City&#39;s other large Sauropod Dinotopians, but he was very well muscled when compared to Luke and Marjorie. His head was ultimately similar in shape to Luke and Marjorie&#39;s, which made sense, given that Apatosaurus was a relative, if a more robust relative, of Diplodocus. Quintus had also gained a more olive green coloring but with a banding of brown spots that Mister M could see bounding around his neck and tail<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice spots,&quot; Mister M said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... they go around the shoulders and torso too,&quot; Quintus answered, &quot;but the shirt and shorts hide that... which is too bad, because I think the spots actually make my abs look even more awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ultimately, a trip to the gym will let you show all that off,&quot; Mister M replied as Jeremy came in for the last two, Ulysses and Stella.<br />
<br />
&quot;And could make for some interesting takes for entertainment,&quot; Quintus chuckled agreement.<br />
<br />
That raised a bit of a chuckle from Mister M, as a lot of his friends&#39; decision to convert and become Dinotopians related &quot;compromises&quot; that had been made allow for more adult films to be made and have them sold in Dino City. There wouldn&#39;t be an outright strip club, like the Meat Market as the Dino City government remained fairly firm on that, which, given that the mayor and a good portion of the city council were Glen Rose residents before Animalia and Horizon bought up the land to turn the more &quot;out of town&quot; parts of Glen Rose&#39;s western edge into Dino City, made sense. But movies or photographs taken privately were allowed for sale under the compromise that had been reached and Mister M knew his friends had jumped at that. Whether or not they stayed with that was a different issue. And if they could or did hook up with someone, that partner may not want them to remain in the adult entertainment industry, but Mister M also knew that for the moment all those things were something yet to be seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are a lot of things that could be interesting,&quot; Victor commented, &quot;and in the research for the conversion... a lot of it isn&#39;t necessarily about things that we converted for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Paula agreed, and this continued until Stella and Ulysses came back.<br />
<br />
Stella was the first to return in a white tank top and blue shorts that contrasted with her new Dinotopian features. Mister M noted that Stella had gained some features that were rather similar to his own, in that her muzzle was relatively narrow, and while starting as a Human before conversion allowed for some retention of a Human&#39;s binocular vision, as her head had changed, her eyes were now more on the sides of her head and her own muzzle would obscure some of her vision to a degree. Though Mister M figured that she wouldn&#39;t be bothered by it as much as her muzzle wasn&#39;t as proportionately as long as his own. She also had three clawed fingers and a thumb for four total digits, which mirrored his own, and a lot of this made sense. It seemed that many Theropod Dinotopians ended up taking the number of digits the mundane animal had and then adding a thumb for their digits, thus since Allosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus had three fingers, Stella and Mister M had four fingers. And since Allosaurus could technically be counted as a &quot;predecessor&quot; to Carcharodontosaurus in terms of the evolution of Carnosaurs, that would explain many of the similarities. The biggest difference was that Stella had gained two thin and small horns that were just before her eyes and angled outward that Allosaurus was known for and Carcharodontosaurus lacked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look good,&quot; Mister M said to Stella.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t I?&quot; Stella answered with a rather toothy smile and turned.<br />
<br />
This gave them a better look at her scale coloring, which also was similar to Mister M, in that if there were any feathers, they were so small and fine that they weren&#39;t noticeable to the eye. Here lower jaw, neck, chest, inner thighs, feet, and underside of the tail was a creamy white color with the rest being an orange-brown. Though Mister M also noted that her horns and a small ridge going from them down the top of her muzzle was more of a reddish brown and that the same color was then in a sort of faded pattern on the outer sides of Stella&#39;s arms and legs, sort of like the spots on a lion cub. Her tail also ended with black bands that gradually faded going up the tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Quintus commented, &quot;and ready to date someone named Alvin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s just what I need,&quot; Stella rolled her head and eyes, &quot;I become a beautiful Allosaurus Jimmadseni and you want to hook me up with &quot;Big All.&quot; Sheesh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not Allosaurus Fragilis?&quot; Selena asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Stella actually chuckled a little, &quot;when I made the request to become Allosaurus... a lot of that basis came from the &quot;Ballad of Big All&quot; documentary, so I made a reference to &quot;Big All.&quot; Doctor Green said that that particular specimen, while it&#39;s among those referred to as Allosaurus as part of its common name was Allosaurus Jimmadseni in its scientific name. Which was a surprise and confusing... but it worked out well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re upset with a joke about hooking up with a guy named Alvin?&quot; Quintus asked.<br />
<br />
Stella only stuck out her tongue at that, and it was at that time that Ulysses returned. He was casually dressed, but was scratching the back of his head for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I&#39;m late,&quot; Ulysses spoke, &quot;they had to do some major alterations for my sail.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then turned around to give the others a better view, which showed that his shirt had a large hole that ran from below the neckline and then ran to the bottom of the shirt where a loop then went over the shorts he was given and then around the long and thick paddle like tail that Spinosaurus had. The sail was a bit larger than Regina&#39;s and looked like it arched up at the front, gave a lazy curve down going toward the back and then coming up again to match the front apex and then curving down sharply right above the tail. The larger size and height of that sail then made Stella almost jump forward to avoid being hit by it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, watch it,&quot; Stella countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, still getting used to the size of this and all,&quot; Ulysses managed, &quot;Doctor Green said he had a friend who could help with this...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, her name is Regina,&quot; Mister M commented, &quot;she is also a Spinosaurus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mister M noted that Ulysses&#39; coloring pretty much matched Regina&#39;s, a tannish brown sail, jade green chest, and a dark pine green for his arms, legs, head, and tail. He also noted that there was some of that dark pine green stripping on the sail as well in places. The thing that was really different was that Ulysses coloring stood out in a bolder way, like his colors were actually brighter than Regina&#39;s, and particularly on the sail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just be careful when trying anything,&quot; Mister M said in warning, &quot;she&#39;s kinda gotten interested in the Mesozoic Fight Club and has been training for it. She and Heather Green even have practice sessions on the weekends... though of late also including the chirps of the youngest Greens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like the one that knocked his sibling over in that Easter video?&quot; Victor wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that was the mayor&#39;s children,&quot; Mister M corrected, &quot;and Parasaurolophus Dinotopians at that. They&#39;d be closer to Paula&#39;s species than the rest of us. Heather Green is a Syntixisaurus, like Doctor Green. She normally does a lot of the artwork and promotions for Horizon, and I mean Horizon in general, not just Dino City. But because Jeremy is friends with Regina, Heather&#39;s ultimately made friends with her as well. So... if you push something she doesn&#39;t like...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d end up with two women angry at me,&quot; Ulysses nodded, &quot;got it. Best behavior and not asking her to get into porn.&quot;</p>
