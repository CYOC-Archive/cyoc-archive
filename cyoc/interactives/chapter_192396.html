<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Reviving this old chapter branch</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob Tristan Vandersteen remembers the last few days going through his normal paces with rapid alterations. He cursed and used more profanities at things he ignored before, knowing full well that no one would come at him for it.<br />
<br />
The jacket had changed him a lot within this week, granting him muscles and height that would now undeniably tag him as part of the jock clique. He knows after a realization that it wasn’t just his physicality being altered, his mentality was being transformed too and rapidly. Being unable to easily recall his nerdy topics and his old geeky friends was a telling point. <br />
It was not that his brain was becoming worse for wear, he assumes it isn’t, but that new pathways were being made to let him acclimate and partition storage for the new jock to become fully actualized. <br />
<br />
With that in mind, Jake knows that he could jack off and still make it to class. Tugging off his jeans and seeing his briefs tenting with his improved cock, Jake gulps down the anticipation and slides it off his legs to hang on the door.<br />
<i>“No time to waste.”</i> Jake slides out of his briefs over thick muscular legs and lets his iron-hard beast come out to play. Pre-cum glazed the uncut head of his cock as it dribbles out as lube. Briefs hanging from the hook, Jake takes it into his hands and starts tentative stroking to get him in the pace. <br />
<br />
What starts out as a slow and steady rhythm quickly becomes frantic at the pleasure that shoots up into his brain as his jacked left arm pistons at his cock, his brain filling with jock fantasies of ramming himself into willing pussy and taking her with all of his beastly stamina. His jacket feels hotter as he gasps and moans, his foreskin slipping and stimulating his cockhead with its smoothness. <br />
<br />
“Mmmh, oh man, bro, fuck!” Jake grunts and snarls as the pleasure rise to uncontrollable peaks, each stroke of his cock feeling different as it steadily grows longer and thicker, fantasizing his cock tightly stretching cunts and assholes as he ravaged them. Pleasuring them to their high as he claims another conquest for a jock like him! <br />
<br />
His balls bounce and grow as it drops lower, churning alpha male cum and displacing what was once the previous seed of the nerdy Jakob and being pushed up and out to be replaced. Jake holds it off, hissing at the pleasure under the tip, ready to cum.<br />
The jacket heats up harsher and Jake feels himself growing, the toilet hole visually shrinking as he reaches over a good 6 feet height, feeling his muscles burn of a good fucking workout and his cock and balls producing testosterone like never before.<br />
<br />
Taking aim, Jake releases with a groan as jets of cum splatters into the toilet with audible splurts of water penetrated by seed. His whole body shivers at the heat sinking deep, his brain feeling the euphoria of orgasm. <br />
Taking deep breaths before post-coital exhaustion kicks in, Jake stares down and whistles at his emission. The water now has a layer of his musky seed covering it, along with some splattering to the side of the toilet bowl. <br />
<br />
Jake takes out some toilet paper from the roll and wipes it down, though not as cleanly, and flushes it all down. Going to the mirror, Jake wets some toilet paper and admires his bigger cock and balls, wiping them free of his seed. <br />
With the ordeal that should have been exhausting, Jake feels much more energetic from it. His reflection in the mirror shows none of Jakob the nerd, that there was no resemblance to his previous self. Despite this, Jake knows that inside, he’d still be Jacob Tristan Vandersteen.<br />
 <br />
Washing his face and fixing his hair, Jake thinks that it might be good to get a haircut, fit in with the jock stereotype even better. Hell, if he could make sure his old friends like him, he could perhaps make them be alright with other jocks that, with his assistance, could be nicer to the nerds and geeks.<br />
<br />
“Well, that was a fucking good session,” Jake checks his cell phone, seeing that he still has a good five minutes before his next class. With how energetic he feels, chemistry class would be a breeze. “Alright, still have some time after that good jack off. Man, I need to get some tail.”<br />
<br />
Jake arrives to class right on time, taking pride at how the other students in class give him stares of awe for the nerdy ones and lust from the girls. <br />
<br />
“Right on time, Jake.” Ms. Cromwell smiles warmly at the stud of a jock, “As always.”<br />
<br />
Jake nods and takes a straight path over to where he usually sits, clear from anyone from outright respect to his status now. Some of the girls gave shy touches to his muscles, and Jake let them do it. Reaching his seat, Jake stretches and lets the others see his biceps bulge with softball mounds of muscle, flexing for them to see.<br />
<br />
“Alright, class is formally starting, and don’t get distracted.” She smiles at the laughter of the whole class.<br />
The subject, while initially difficult to grasp with his brain changing to fit a jock, after a while, it becomes easier as he enters his zone. Jake lets out a sigh of relief. He still has his sharp mind inside this thick meathead of his.<br />
<br />
His eyes meet with Tim staring at him from the front row seats, and Jake replies with a smile and a strong flex of his arms, cockily showing him his gains. Silently clueing Tim of what Jake wants.<br />
<i>&quot;You&#39;ll be as big as me soon.&quot;</i></p>
