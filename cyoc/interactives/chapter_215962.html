<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alicia Gilbert checked her phone to see if there were any last moment messages before her big date with the local football stud Kevin Gray. She had been really looking forward to expanding her romantic horizons ever since she got here, and, having blossomed into a beautiful young lady, she was excited to grow beyond the restrictive measures of her home life. <br />
<br />
Alicia had been a homely girl through high school, but during sophomore year she picked up athletics - largely volleyball. In the course of getting fit for the sport, she had grown up well indeed - becoming a reasonably tall, athletic girl. Long, light brown hair, blue eyes, and a blemish free face complimented by make up.<br />
<br />
For her date tonight, Alicia was dressed in a white cocktail dress - eager to make a good impression on her well muscled date. She remembered meeting Kevin Gray after class, when she and some of her new acquaintances from English class went to go check out what the college cafe was like. She was immediately distracted, taken away from the occasion by Kevin Gray&#39;s handsome features, muscled body (which showed aptly well even through his heavy letterman jacket), and how relaxed he was by comparison to the rowdy and loud jocks around him.<br />
<br />
He had curly blond hair, light green eyes, and a very slight amount of stubble on his face. He was about nineteen years old, and along with his powerful muscles, he was bequeathed a certain kind of boyish, male model beauty. And it seemed he too noticed her not long after she walked in. Before long they&#39;d become acquainted, and connected on social media to get to know one another better once they had to leave to go to class. <br />
<br />
A few sessions on IG Direct Messaging, and they decided to have a date - which had ended up being tonight, due to their schedules. It was a weekend, all the best for Alicia and Kevin to avoid having conflicts with their classes, and Kevin in particular didn&#39;t have to worry about his football practice. Camsen College was quite a competitor among the smaller community colleges, and the hope was to eventually compete in the big leagues.<br />
<br />
Another plus of dating Kevin would be an excuse to be around him more. While Alicia got some flack from her little brother Jason back home due to the glow up - she couldn&#39;t escape him without hearing at least one bimbo joke - she was a master class in English, Mathematics, and Forensics. Did it matter to her brother that she graduated with an A in Honors Calculus, whereas he was on course to end his last school year in Algebra II? No. As far as he - and a depressing number of other guys were concerned - pretty woman = dumb.<br />
<br />
Maybe it was the little monster&#39;s defense mechanism. Whereas Alicia had put in the effort, her younger brother just blamed some nebulous &quot;them&quot; for keeping him in the shape he was. Jason was stocky, reasonably tall, and while he benefited from a naturally mesomorphic form, he was as a whole more fat than muscle mass. Though that didn&#39;t stop him from giving a pretty rough tumble to any of the many bullies who for some reason decided Jason Gilbert deserved to be harassed.<br />
<br />
As Alicia fixed up the food for the date - cooked personally - she thought about why it seemed like her brother got so little of the scrutiny, whereas she was basically treated like she was one step away from an orgiastic grand guignol of debauchery. <br />
<br />
Both her mother and father got in on it for whatever reason - as if it was entirely their prerogative to kill her dating life. Of course, now, they wouldn&#39;t be able to stop her now she was 20 years old, on her own, and in a college sixteen miles away from home. She could have however much sex and sexual relations she wanted, and there wasn&#39;t a lot that her puritan parents could do about it. With the way they treated it so urgently she was honestly a little surprised.<br />
<br />
<i>Tap tap tap tap</i><br />
<br />
And there was Kevin at the door. She for now banished the thoughts of her controlling parents and went ahead to welcome her beau into the house. In the slowly setting sunlight of the evening, when she went to the door and saw him standing there in a pristine white with red accents polo shirt, jeans, and dress shoes, smiling brightly as he waited...well...her heart was all a&#39;flutter. His face was smooth today, though she hadn&#39;t minded his stubble much at all. The way the sun bathed his beautiful boyish face and framed his well muscled form...it was just perfect!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey babe, I can smell some freshly cooked food,&quot; Kevin leaned in and kissed her on the cheek, &quot;You&#39;re a real natural with this stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
A blush running on her cheeks for a moment, Alicia welcomed him inside and toward the kitchen table, &quot;I grew up in a pretty strict household. The daughter had to learn how to cook and make food. Best to make lemonade when life gives you lemons, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you know, I wouldn&#39;t have thought you came from that kinda place...&quot; Kevin took a seat and waited for his date to sit and start eating, &quot;You&#39;re a really free spirit, you know? I&#39;m glad you got outta that.&quot; As Alicia sat down to eat, Kevin began wolfing down the food she&#39;d prepared for him. From the way he was eating it, she was glad she&#39;d made a pretty sizable portion. She ate more reasonably and slowly, enjoying the fact that her date so obviously loved her food.<br />
<br />
She tried to make something that was both delicious but not wholly fatty or loaded with extra ingredients. Keep things carbohydrate light, and mostly fat free, low sodium as well. She&#39;d been worried that some of the specialized nutrition seasonings she&#39;d bought might&#39;ve been a little less good than the typical, but from the way that Kevin was going to town, she wouldn&#39;t think so now. <br />
<br />
By the time the two were done eating, Alicia put on a romantic movie in the living room, rolling down the window covers to make sure that when things got steamy nobody would get a look inside. Kevin followed eagerly, and she could feel his eyes appreciating her tight, muscular and fit body. She didn&#39;t exactly mind it - after all, she&#39;d be more worried if he didn&#39;t check her out when she dressed up to impress. &quot;Do I catch your attention, big boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely, babe. Definitely.&quot; <br />
<br />
By the time the two were seated on the couch watching the romantic movie play out, Alicia could see that Kevin had unbuttoned his polo shirt, letting his smooth, firm pectorals show a bit. She fantasized for a moment about holding them, feeling how tight, strong and powerful Kevin&#39;s chest was. A few times she&#39;d walked by the school weight room and saw him lifting weights without his shirt on. And the powerful, muscular form he displayed was more than enough to make her walk off with a blush and ideas running through her head.<br />
<br />
As the movie played, Alicia whispered to Kevin, &quot;I---I love your chest, Kevin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You wanna see more of it?&quot; He responded with an impish chuckle and a big grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yes.&quot; And she didn&#39;t have to wait long for his shirt to come off - letting her see the sweltering, powerful pectorals resting on his chest. His midsection was sculpted into a muscular six pack that also demanded her attention. She found her attention split - between the romance playing out on screen, and the very real desire she felt burning head to toe through her body as she rested next to Kevin. Scooting increasingly close to him and before long, feeling a muscular arm wrap around her shoulder. Glancing up to see his charming smile.<br />
<br />
The movie went on, and she found herself incapable of keeping her hands to herself. They traveled on the powerful body of Kevin Gray, feeling the broad, strong shoulders, gripping biceps that tensed under her fingers, and teasing at his chest and rubbing his abs. And for his part, Kevin just sat there and let her enjoy her freedom - her first time really enjoying the presence of a muscular, good looking man. Even though she could tell as it went on that he was every bit as excited as she was.<br />
<br />
She looked down at his pants and there she saw it. <br />
<br />
Strong, pulsing with life under the threads of his jeans, she saw his ramrod erect cock, making a proud impression. She&#39;d never even been this close to a man, the closest she got to seeing this were some depictions in sex-ed classes and her forays on the internet. &quot;Take...take off your pants, and...let me touch your...your <i>legs</i>.&quot; She breathily asked, glancing at his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure it&#39;s my legs you wanna touch?&quot; He teased, and then promptly unzipped his jeans before standing before her like a testament to masculine beauty, and then turned - letting her see his pert bubble butt right as he pushed his jeans down, before turning back to sit down. Every inch of him was perfect it seemed. And she did mean every inch. His cock, visible now through the thin material of his tighty-whities, seemed to have a light droplet of pre at the very end, its whole length covered and flattered by the white material.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...no I didn&#39;t mean...I didn&#39;t mean your legs,&quot; Alicia shook with her need, and looked around. She half expected her controlling parents to call, or barge down the door, or otherwise disrupt her even now at the pinnacle of need. But nothing came - except the pounding of her heart, and the burning feeling of desire. &quot;I want to touch your...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My cock? My eight inch cock?&quot; He cheekily bragged. God he was so big. Before long the tighty-whities came off too, and Kevin sat there with his erection in full view. His bush seemed to have been trimmed a bit lately, probably to not seem too unruly for his date. Alicia couldn&#39;t help it, and before long she was down a blouse as she started touching his long, hard manhood. Carefully and nervously at first - after all, this was the first time she&#39;d really gotten to do this.<br />
<br />
Kevin for his part just laid back and let her have this. Knowing she was inexperienced, and that he didn&#39;t want to overwhelm her. He did let out a gasp when she rubbed the most sensitive spot on his organ by accident, but immediately stated, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you just got my sensitive spot. Keep going!&quot; <br />
<br />
Alicia, worried immediately but then assuaged, did so - and she started to feel more adventurous. Her own skirt came down, and she, clad only in her bra and panties, started climbing on top of Kevin. Moaning to herself as she felt his cock rub against her. And she kissed him - and that was when things got weird. She could feel something happening. No kiss could feel this dynamic, this powerful. It was like, as she kissed him, and felt him lean into it as much as possible, their tongues swirling together, something was happening.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t know what, but she had never been wetter, she had never been more excited. She wanted Kevin Gray come hell or high water. Yet as she and he kissed and made out, her writhing and pressing her groin against his - enjoying the moan he let out in the midst of their kiss - she didn&#39;t question it then. Maybe she should have. Maybe she should&#39;ve looked and seen what was happening. But in the heat of the moment, with a love scene symmetrically playing out on the TV, Alicia couldn&#39;t have stopped herself if she wanted to.<br />
<br />
After all, she had no reason to know in that moment that her kiss, her sexual excitement, was inducing an effect upon poor, lovestruck Kevin Gray. And as much as he&#39;d been the ladykiller before then, he picked the perhaps most auspicious one to finally fall for. Kevin was himself feeling more sexually strong and alive than he&#39;d felt in any of his prior sexual adventures, every inch of him seemed to radiate with pleasure and delight. It was like this girl was a drug, and he was taking the hit of his life. As he opened up her bra, and tossed it away, Kevin couldn&#39;t have noticed...</p>
