<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The car ride home was silent. Neither wanted to talk about what transpired at the dinner table back at Benton’s. Both Lance and Lila were just glad to be out of what was quickly becoming a toxic environment, despite Benton’s attempt to resolve the issue in a swift and decisive manner. Yet the entire family and guests could hear Amanda shouting and screaming as she tried to uselessly defend her position of clearly trying to start what could of quickly became a physical confrontation between herself and Lila Carpenter.<br />
<br />
Lance pulling into the driveway of his modest three bedroom bungalow, with his parents Anton and Esmeralda close behind, they both see a sight that puts him and Lila in a state of unease. Lila’s younger brother Rick was waiting by the house; his pickup truck parked at the curb. Lila the first to get out of Lances car seeing her brother waiting at the door step.<br />
“Rick,” Lila approaching; “why are you here?”<br />
“Well I tried calling,” Rick looking concerned; “but I kept getting nothing but your voicemail.”<br />
Lila looks at her cellphone and sheepishly apologizes; “sorry I must have turned it off by accident. But why are you here?”<br />
“I needed to ask you something.” Rick seeing Lance also approaching; “both of you in fact.”<br />
“Okay,” Lila looking curious: “what is it?”<br />
“You know mine and Ester’s wedding anniversary is tomorrow evening,” Rick looking at his sister; “can you mind the kids while we have an evening to ourselves?”<br />
“You want them over here,” Lance asking; “that might be difficult.”<br />
“Why is that,” Rick looking perturbed; “why can’t you look after Jasper, Yogi and Cindy?”<br />
“Because my parents are here,” Lance watching the rental car pull up behind Rick’s pickup truck.<br />
<br />
Rick Carpenter watches as a silver furred were-panthress gets out of the front passenger seat, while a black furred were-panther with streaks of grey get out of the driver’s seat. Seeing the couple approach, Lila quickly introduces Anton and Esmeralda to her younger brother Rick; also a naturally born were-tiger like her, they accept and shake Rick’s hand. Rick at the moment is still in his human form.<br />
“So how long are you two visiting,” Rick looking genuinely embarrassed.<br />
“Sometime after the new year,” Esmeralda answering; “we wanted to spend the holidays with our children.”<br />
“Yes mom,” Lance rolling his eyes; “don’t forget Frieda your only grandchild.”<br />
“Not for long,” Anton smiles; “at least the way you and Lila are going at it.”<br />
“You’re not,” Rick looking at his sister and pointing at her abdomen.<br />
“Not yet,” Lila grinning; “but once we are married, “Lila hugging Lance; “I can’t guarantee afterwards.”<br />
“Let’s talk inside,” Lance looking at the awkward gathering; “that way we can all talk over coffee and in private.”<br />
<br />
With no one objecting; Lance takes his keys and unlocks his front door, Letting Lila and Rick in first, he heads back to his parents rental and helps them take their luggage out from the trunk of the car. As Anton and Esmeralda enter their younger son’s home, they are reminded by the size of their meager dwelling when they were still living hand to paw.<br />
 “My home may be small compared to Benton’s,” Lance seeing his parent’s look of concern; “but that in no way means I’m struggling. Knight Media has been quite successful and I prefer not to live high on the hog like Benton does.”<br />
“Small is the understatement,” Anton answering; “It’s no bigger than our house when you were born.”<br />
“Let’s save the family history for another time dad,” Lance speaking; “Lila’s brother doesn’t need to hear it right now.”<br />
“Fair enough,” Anton responding; “just tell me and Esmeralda where to put our luggage.”<br />
<br />
Lance shows his parents the spare room he had made up; while it originally served as the room Frieda would sometimes sleep in when her parents were away on some business or social function, Lance was able to quickly put down fresh sheets and do a little light cleaning. Help his father place the suit cases on the bed that will soon see quite a bit of action; the two were-panthers walk to the small kitchen where Esmeralda was talking to Rick and Lila. Lila already in her were-tigress fursona; quickly removing her clothes and shifting in front of her brother, an event is all too familiar witnessing from his older sister as he shows no reaction to briefly seeing her naked before fur hides and covers her assets.<br />
<br />
“So Benton’s wife was being an ass,” Rick shaking his head as Lila and Esmeralda filled him in on what happened earlier during dinner.<br />
“Yeah,” Esmeralda shaking her head; “she has always been a bit of a prig. Why Benton ever married her.”<br />
“Because they fell in love,” Anton joining the conversation; “how is the half million dollar question begging to be answered.”<br />
“Rick,” Lila shaking her head; “I’m sorry. I completely forgot that your wedding anniversary is tomorrow.”<br />
“Yeah,” Rick placing a hand on his sister’s furry shoulder; “I guess with you moving here and starting a new life, I forgot that I was going to have to look at potential babysitters.”<br />
“You have cubs,” Anton asking.<br />
“Three,” Rick answering; “Cindy is seven and my six year old twin boys Jasper and Yogi.”<br />
“And they can be a pawful,” Lila chuckling; “Jasper and Yogi are constantly trying torment Cindy.”<br />
“Siblings tend to do that,” Rick smiling; “just like we use to.”<br />
“You can still look after them here,” Esmeralda grinning.<br />
“And how do you propose that,” Lila asking; “when those three will destroy any room they are placed in together.”<br />
“Is the Were-club still around,” Esmeralda smiling; “Anton and I could always have a merry romp over there while your brother and his wife have a romantic evening alone.”<br />
“Ugh,” Lance answering; “if that place wasn’t so successful, I’d of had it shuttered a long time ago. To have that establishment,” Lance looking disgusted; “as part of Knight Media is an embarrassment.”<br />
“Well how the hell did you manage to get control of the place,” Rick looking shocked.<br />
“Would you believe,” Lance snorting; “through a poker wager. My straight flush beating the previous owner’s full house of kings over queens,” Lance looking sullen; “I was drunk which was a rarity and for some reason had KPXX wagered as well.”<br />
<br />
“Lance,” Anton looking; “why would you bet a chunk of the company I handed over to you?”<br />
“Did you not hear,” Lance answering; “I was drunk.”<br />
“We all do stupid things when inebriated,” Rick rolling his eyes looking bemused.<br />
“Getting Ester knock up with twin cubs,” Lila grinning; “comes to mind.”<br />
“Neither of us was drunk,” Rick pausing while smiling; “much.”<br />
Everyone laughs as Rick’s face goes red from embarrassment; Lila laughing the hardest as she knows, her brother and Ester only had a single glass of champagne that evening. But she still could not help but rib Rick with the story every now and then.<br />
“Then if my son is okay with it,” Anton still laughing; “Esmeralda and I will have some fun tomorrow evening at the were-club while he and Lila play baby-sitter to three energetic cubs.”<br />
“It should be a great learning experience for Lance,” Lila cackling; “I should know. I wasn’t lying when I said they can be a pawful.”<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t look like I have much of a choice,&quot; Lance shaking his head; &quot;now do I.&quot;</p>
