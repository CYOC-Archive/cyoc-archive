<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max heard the sound of a trap not at all far behind him. Things weren&#39;t going according to plan at all here. Had he misjudged the state he&#39;d left that last one in, or was there just an unusual number of huskies looking for him? Perhaps they&#39;d found his toy? Well... the last thing they&#39;d expect would be for him to double back along this route, wouldn&#39;t it?<br />
<br />
Ooh... now this was interesting. If it wasn&#39;t the little husky girl who&#39;d been dealing with all the predatory guests. The one who just happened to be hired right after that childish little &#39;Lone Wolf&#39; disappeared. This might call for a little poetic justice. Just look at her already. Such fear. Such concern over a broken little dog. She clearly saw him approaching, and oh, that was indeed a look of recognition on her face. It seemed though her simple little brain just wouldn&#39;t let her stop worrying about her mate long enough to do the sensible thing. Max knew a thing or two about this sort of emotional paralysis, and knew she did too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well well well,&quot; he said, bending over to smear some blood from the log that had smashed into Sam. &quot;So this is what our &#39;Lone Wolf&#39; has been reduced to. Just another weak, crying little female who needs others to protect her.&quot; She gathered up the nerve to take a swing at him, but he easily caught her arm and pulled it behind her back then grabbed her throat with his teeth until she went limp and he could really just taste her fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that&#39;s a good little dog,&quot; he managed to say in a surprisingly intelligible fashion. &quot;We&#39;re going to have a lot of fun, but first we need to make your new friend here go away so he doesn&#39;t get  all jealous.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he moved into position to deliver a killing blow to Sam however, Goldie snapped. While she&#39;d never been in a real fight before, all her extra exercise had been paying off, and her concern for Sam blinded her to personal danger. Somehow, she managed to summon up the strength to break free of the hold, and throw Max to the ground. She then threw herself on top of him blood flowing from her neck where his teeth had sunk in when she suddenly shifted her weight. She quickly had himby the throat, choking him while repeatedly smashing his head into the ground with tears streaming down her face until the twins arrived to pull her off.<br />
<br />

Agent Sherman&#39;s irritation only grew when he was informed that park security had apprehended the suspect and would be escorting him to the entryway. Not only did this make Johnson&#39;s little stunt all the more pointless, with civilians bringing him in, and with injuries no less, the paperwork was going to be a bit tricker. Johnson would be a bit disappointed as well. With Sherman stuck as a skunk and his I.D. ruined, he&#39;d have to abandon his little skunk fetish early to handle the actual incarceration. That of course meant Sherman would be stuck questioning all the freaks. He&#39;d damn well be able keep drinking coffee while he was stuck like this. On the upside, everyone he&#39;d talked to so far seemed to be willing to fly to Tennessee and testify when the trial date came along. He just hoped they had some decent clothes to wear to the occasion. People were a lot less lenient about this sort of &#39;lifestyle choice&#39; out that way.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Between the severity of his injuries and the lack of a proper clearing, Sam couldn&#39;t be moved until the medical team was sure he&#39;d survive the trip back. Goldie of course refused to leave his side, despite her own injuries, and requests that she give a statement to the FBI agents who had apparently been sent to the park. She would do whatever she had to to see Max convicted, but first she needed to hear that Sam would make it.<br />

Terry was quite happy to see that Wally had calmed down, and made sure to squeeze in &#39;a parting ride&#39; as soon as he was awake. He promised he&#39;d be back to check up on her again in two weeks, and might make a longer stay of it. Terry hated to see him go, but took only a moment to remember she still had to &#39;say good morning&#39; to Tim, and Randy, and Eric, and Justin...<br />
<br />

<br />
Chad didn&#39;t begin her day in nearly such a good mood. She had had some particularly vivid dreams of a nature she was not at all prepared to deal with, and now some of these wannabe bitches were trying to get her to talk about her feelings. That was probably why she&#39;d had such a sick dream. They were probably whispering all kinds of perverted subliminal garbage to her all night. And they were still trying to push those berries on her! The last thing she was going to do was spend one more second with this sick little trying to turn her into some kind of chick! Still not saying a word to anyone, she stormed right back off towards the tournament.<br />
<br />
When she arrived, she saw there were considerably fewer huskies present. Hell if she knew why. She figured after her she&#39;d had her head smashed in, they&#39;d have more people on security. Keep those dirty little cheaters in line. With how early it was, she was surprised to find they&#39;d already started. Apparently they wanted to get those last couple in they&#39;d cancelled yesterday. She looked around for a good place to watch from, and eventually remembered the rocks set up for the does. She deserved a better view than those stupid bimbos, so up she went to find a good spot. When the bucks saw her, they started smiling and waving. A few even whistled. Nice to see she still commanded a little respect around here. And damn was that a lot of nice racks on all of them.<br />
<br />
Chad couldn&#39;t have asked for a better match to come next. Shaun vs. Vinny. That she was glad to see. For a minute she&#39;d thought Vinny&#39;d stabbed her in the back, worked some deal out with this little punk. If he&#39;d done that though, he sure as hell wouldn&#39;t have set himself up to fight him, right? &quot;Come on Vinny!&quot; she shouted. &quot;Trash this little punk ass cheater! You can do it!&quot; Her heart started racing as they took their positions and started charging. She could tell the does around her were getting real turned on by this. Stupid horny bitches probably wouldn&#39;t even be able to wait for the whole thing to finish. She squirmed in her seat, wondering why it was so hot this morning. Had they gone and given her more fur or what?<br />
<br />
Antlers clattered, and Shaun went reeling off to one side. He stayed on his feet though, and came back slamming Vinny in the gut with an elbow. &quot;Don&#39;t take that from a little punk! Show him how a real man does it!&quot; Grinning at her words Vinny slammed down with a vicious headbutt, the force of which took Shaun&#39;s legs out from under him and knocked him flat on his back. Chad cheered. Down goes the cheating punk, she thought, and my man here&#39;s on his way to winning it all. She was so excited she jumped down off her perch and ran up to hug him. She was so proud she could kiss him. Suddenly she realized she WAS kissing him. But not in like a gay way she rationalized. She was just doing like the mob thing. Show of respect to the guy you&#39;re gonna let run things... yeah. She reached up to feel the antlers that had scored her revenge, too. Wow were they thick. She could probably do a pull-up off them. Vinny must have thought the same thing, and lifted her up off her feet... with assistance from his hands of course. &quot;We need to talk,&quot; she whispered in his ear, and he carried her off behind the some bushes.<br />
<br />
Still cradled in his arms, and not feeling particularly inclined to get down, she made sure nobody else was around and asked &quot;What the hell happened yesterday? I thought this was supposed to work out with you and me on top calling all the shots?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m handling things well enough,&quot; said Vinny. &quot;Apparently you just didn&#39;t get the deluxe package. Don&#39;t worry about it though, it&#39;s still going down the right way, more or less. Once I&#39;m crowned the first head of the Order, the first thing I&#39;m going to do is make sure there&#39;s always a place for you right next to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Something about the way he&#39;d phrased that didn&#39;t seem right to Chad, but his tone said he was definitely on her side. She still couldn&#39;t believe these antlers, or how easily he&#39;d carried her over. How could she ever have thought Vinny would screw her over, she wondered as he laid her down in the soft grass, and continued to show his support by massaging her chest. Vinny was the man. Vinny was HER man. She freakin&#39; loved this guy. She probably had time to show him just how much before his next fight even...</p>
