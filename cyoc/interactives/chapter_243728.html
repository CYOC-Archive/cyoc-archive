<br />
Connor glanced at Caleb, noting the grim expression on his older brother&#39;s face. Only a few days ago the Morelands received word of Mason&#39;s kidnapping as well as Fukushu&#39;s response. Since then, Caleb had been oddly quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you going to tell me why we&#39;re driving to Maine?&quot; Connor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m....concerned,&quot; Caleb answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh no shit,&quot; Connor huffed. &quot;Never would of thought that, especially after you&#39;ve been walking around for the last few days looking like you smelled a fart in church.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb said nothing, his steel grey eyes narrowed as he gave his brother a sideways glance. &quot;Do you have any idea how dangerous Fukushu is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do,&quot; Connor scoffed. &quot;But just pretend I don&#39;t. Is that what&#39;s got you looking grimmer than usual?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You still don&#39;t understand,&quot; Caleb sighed shaking his head. Pulling off the exit to Lilith and Eliana&#39;s house, Caleb now pulled into a commuter lot before putting the jeep in park. Turning he now glared at his younger brother, causing Connor to fidget uncomfortably under his brothers gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me explain what&#39;s going on,&quot; Caleb said sternly. &quot;More than twenty years ago was the last time Fukushu lost his shit. Gloria&#39;s sister Katie, Mika, Claudia, they killed his younger sister Yomi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve heard this story Caleb,&quot; Connor growled. &quot;Yomi kidnapped Mia, Jack, and Kellie. Lilith the Demon Queen ran to their rescue with the wizards. Stopped Yomi, then Lilith murdered Yomi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah and it led to the Timeline War,&quot; Caleb whispered.<br />
<br />
Connor went quiet, noticing the look of pure anxiety on Caleb&#39;s face. The brothers were too young at the time. Caleb was barely 16 years old and Connor was 13. While Connor wasn&#39;t as familiar with what happened, what he did remember was his father vanishing for months as he dealt multiple incursions from the supernatural realms.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve talked with Gloria over the years,&quot; Caleb continued. &quot;Asked her a lot of questions about what happened. She was a kid too. Fifteen going on sixteen and cocky as hell. Fukushu....and the creatures he aligned with gave her a reality check.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon Caleb they were able to handle it back then,&quot; Connor stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah barely,&quot; Caleb countered. &quot;The wizards won, but Fukushu was relentless when his master was destroyed. Even before that he was frightening. Crashed Katie&#39;s wedding, damn near killed Claudia, Mika, Naomi. Smacked them down like they were nothing. Then he crippled Lilith. Lilith Connor! The god damn demon witch from the Bible. You have any idea the kinda power you need to have to even scratch her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but he still lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks to some absolute Loony Toons bullshit,&quot; Caleb grumbled. &quot;It took two freaking wizards from the future and Katie at the peak of her powers to even slow him down. Even then, they couldn&#39;t stop him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I get,&quot; Connor said softly. &quot;So why come here? Why come see Lilith and Eliana?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sophie Kane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sophie Kane?&quot; Connor asked in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Caleb sighed. &quot;See, I&#39;ve been in touch with Eliana ever since this whole Superior Church business started. Started thinking about Sophie when we found out she was the Seraphim. Then Mason got attacked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason Harris?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Caleb shuddered. &quot;Fukushu has taken a liking to the kid. Doesn&#39;t take a lot of digging to connect the dots. When it comes to someone Fukushu cares about, the worst thing you can do is harm that person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait hold on,&quot; Connor exclaimed. &quot;Do you think Fukushu is going to go after Eliana and Lilith because of their connection to Sophie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Caleb replied grimly. &quot;But I know Eliana and just how stubborn Alyssa can be. Something tells me Alyssa gets that from her mom. Sophie is family. They&#39;re going to try and rescue her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that puts them in Fukushu&#39;s crosshairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb nodded, causing Connor to lean backwards in his chair. Having a pissed off nine tail kitsune barreling towards Eliana and the Kane family was definitely a problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I get,&quot; Connor finally said. &quot;If Sophie stays with them, they&#39;re in danger. The next question is why am I here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I need you to protect them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t be serious,&quot; Connor gawked. &quot;Caleb! There&#39;s gotta be someone better than me. What about the twins or Miles or even Aaron? They&#39;re in better shape than I am!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna be perfectly honest with you Connor so you&#39;ll understand,&quot; Caleb stated. &quot;Miles is a great hand. Professional, skilled, smart, but he&#39;s more of a solid player, not an All Pro. Besides, the church might allow him to start his own demon hunting family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously?!&quot; Connor exclaimed. &quot;I mean that&#39;s a hell of an honor. It&#39;s not too often the church consecrates another hunting family. Does he know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; Caleb said. &quot;And it&#39;s still in the early stages. Still, as good as he is, you&#39;re better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Appreciate the compliment,&quot; Connor smirked. &quot;But what about the twins or Aaron?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As good as Chase and Charlotte are, they wouldn&#39;t last five minutes against Fukushu,&quot; Caleb replied. &quot;And I made a promise that I would never put them in hopeless situations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to know I&#39;m expendable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you not be my smart ass little brother for a minute,&quot; Caleb groaned.<br />
<br />
Connor nodded, holding up his hands as Caleb took a breath. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Caleb sighed. &quot;And while Aaron would be the best option and have the best chance out of all of us, he hasn&#39;t been the same since I fought him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron is still coming to terms with nearly killing me,&quot; Caleb said. &quot;I&#39;ve seen it. He&#39;s off his game, just a little bit. Not enough anyone would notice except me. If he faces his uncle I&#39;m worried he&#39;ll hesitate and get himself killed or worse....kill Fukushu. That happens, it&#39;ll break him. I can&#39;t do that to him....not again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Connor said stoicly. &quot;That leaves me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d go if I was able to,&quot; Caleb said apologetically. &quot;But I&#39;m still a few months away from a full recovery. All I&#39;d be is a nuisance to Fukushu. He&#39;d take me out to quickly and if Sophie is rescued, Eliana and Lilith will need time to get away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So all I am is a distraction,&quot; Connor frowned. &quot;Not exactly a ringing endorsement.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t give yourself enough credit Connor,&quot; Caleb smirked. &quot;You got the smarts to hold Fukushu off. Hopefully long enough for the cavalry to arrive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now I know why you didn&#39;t say anything to Spark,&quot; Connor smirked. &quot;I would have said yes and then Spark would have killed us both.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb laughed for the first time in days, playfully shoving his little brother as he started the jeep once more. With the tension effectively neutralized the brothers drove the remaining few minutes to Eliana&#39;s farm. As the pair pulled up to the cabin, they could see Eliana and Lilith exit, obviously confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Caleb what&#39;s wrong,&quot; Eliana asked. &quot;Is it the Amberhills?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Caleb replied. &quot;It concerns Sophie Kane.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eliana and Lilith nodded, quickly inviting the hunters inside. For the next twenty minutes they spoke, Caleb&#39;s fears realized as Lilith, Misery, and Eliana spoke of trying to find and save Sophie Kane.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I can stress enough how bad of an idea that is,&quot; Caleb stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s my sister Caleb,&quot; Lilith replied forcefully. &quot;If Connor was in the same situation you&#39;d do the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Caleb sighed. &quot;But there&#39;s a lot of intangibles here. Your sister has been programmed to kill since she was a child. Who knows what they&#39;ve done to her over the last 30 plus years! It might not be possible to break her programming. Even if you do, you have Fukushu to deal with. He won&#39;t rest until anyone associated with this Superior Church is a stain on the ground.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let him come,&quot; Misery growled. &quot;I remember the Timeline War. I fought against him and those monstrosities he called foot soldiers. If we rescue Sophie and he comes for her? I&#39;ll be ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you,&quot; Caleb countered. &quot;I know you&#39;re powerful Mary, but Fukushu is on an entirely different level. He&#39;ll kill anyone that stands in his way. Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s women and children.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what would you have us do then Caleb,&quot; Eliana replied angrily. &quot;Sit around and twiddle our thumbs? Wait for Lilith&#39;s sister, some of the last family she has left, to have her head mounted on a spike?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not happening,&quot; Lilith added. &quot;If we can find Sophie, we&#39;re going to save her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thought you might say that,&quot; Caleb sighed. &quot;That&#39;s why I ask that Connor stay here, at least until this crisis is over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you really think that&#39;s necessary?&quot; Misery asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He helped you with your werewolf problem,&quot; Caleb countered. &quot;He&#39;s more than capable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith and Eliana turned to one another before nodding. &quot;Okay,&quot; they said. &quot;But you do realize we&#39;re going to try and rescue Sophie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Caleb replied solemnly. &quot;Just be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Caleb now hugged his brother goodbye, he could see Connor now speaking with Eliana and Lilith. The trio now setting up the hunter in a spare bedroom. Driving away all Caleb could hope for was that this wouldn&#39;t be the last time he saw Connor alive.</p>
