<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Liam had trouble believing this girl had just miraculously become a vampire, which, to his knowledge, don’t even exist. What else could he change? Something to prove, with absolute certainty, that he was able to manipulate everything inside of the classroom.<br />
What did he like? He liked women, that’s for sure. He looked over to his left, seeing the popular girls, Lana and Miracle. They were the ‘Mean Girls’ of the school, then again, he hadn’t actually seen that movie. Both were wearing leggings, very form fitting. Lana was wearing a white top of some kind with a shirt over it. The shirt wasn’t done up, this gave view to her cleavage. She didn’t have huge boobs, but they were perky alright... was she even wearing a bra? Then again, how did she show off all that cleavage? These were questions that Liam would never be able to answer.<br />
He changed his view to the girl sitting behind Lana, Miracle. What a name. It’s like her parents wanted her to be idolised by her classmates, at least those in the the school’s artificial ‘lower-class’. She wore a zip up hoodie, that was only zipped up maybe two thirds of the way, stopping to again, show of her cleavage. Now Miracle was different from Lana, she was very well endowed. She had breasts that couldn’t have been smaller than a D, or maybe it was a DD, or... whatever. They were big, and they were on display. She had them in what could only be discerned as a low-cut top of some kind. It was low cut enough that Liam could actually see the outline of her bra. Her ass was pretty big too. Big enough that she sat higher up than Lana, even though they were around the same height. But even then <br />
Lana was white, tanned and a half, but white. Miracle, on the other hand, was black. Lana had puffier lips but Miracles looked natural; Lana appeared to have had them made bigger artificially. Liam had never noticed this.<br />
Lana was making her breasts look bigger through the art of cleavage while Miracle wore a normal bra and got the same effect. Miracles clothes seemed more casual, while Lana’s seemed to be trying a little harder.<br />
Liam realised it, Lana was trying to look as hot as Miracle did, but she had to try so much harder.<br />
<br />
Liam then realised that Miracle was looking at him, she had noticed him examining her body.<br />
He quickly zipped back to his normal position, looking right at the front of the class. He did this so awkwardly that people who hadn’t noticed before now knew exactly what had happened. He’d made himself look pretty stupid.<br />
<br />
Liam didn’t want to look around again, but he knew who else was there. There was a girl who followed Lana and Miracle around, nobody really liked her, especially them. Plus, Liam couldn’t even remember her name, it was... Karen? Or maybe Regina? Liam was pretty sure he thinking of something else. <br />
<br />
Behind her was a girl who always sat in the back corner of every class he attended, she would usually take notes, but had headphones in half the time. He was pretty sure she just watched movies or TV shows during class. ‘Each to their own,’ Liam thought. She had dark brown hair and wore the most casual clothes possible, not drawing attention to herself. She usually wore this grey hoodie and jeans. She was notably Chinese in decent, just from her face, but her accent didn’t tell. Her body wasn’t very different either, she didn’t try and look like how most of her classmates did. If anything, she seemed to be a little below average. <br />
<br />
On her right was her best friend, Peyton. He was physically pretty similar to Ray, aside from the boobs and that. They were pretty much the same height, seemed to be the same weight. Even their hair colour was the same, maybe a little darker on Ray’s side, but still, it was odd. Peyton had shorter hair though, he wore a t-shirt and jeans. Liam always thought Peyton’s shirts were cool, they usually had a dumb joke or pun on them, which Liam did think were funny. He was curious as to what he was wearing today. But didn’t want to look all the way back, especially since he was three seats directly behind him. He’d find out later.<br />
<br />
Now the two between Liam and Peyton were occupied by two girls he didn’t really know them. He couldn’t picture them in his head, but he was pretty sure one of them was named Violet, but he wasn’t really sure.<br />
<br />
To his right, aside from the goth girl, who he was pretty sure was named Bella. Which just seemed appropriate at the moment. Was a girl, a boy, and another girl. The first girl was Sadie, she was a black haired smartass. She always answered questions with this snarky attitude like she was better than everyone else, even when she got it wrong, she’d just correct herself and seem like ‘I’m so smart I corrected myself because I’m so smart and I can do that’. She was such a teachers pet. And the worst part was she was hot. She had a face that just reeked of natural beauty, she didn’t wear any makeup and did her hair in a messy way. And not a hot-messy way, just messy. But she still looked good. She was only rivalled by Miracle, and to some extent, Lana.<br />
Behind her was Chase, the jock of the class. He, along with his squad of meathead assholes, were, and you’ll be shocked by this, on the football team. Chase was the smartest of the bunch, which was isn’t saying a lot, but that meant he was in the same class as Sadie. As much as Liam really didn’t like Chase, he had to be fair, he wasn’t that bad. He was clearly the nicest of his squad, especially when he wasn’t actually around his friends. He was pretty smart too, he just seemed to hang around with a bunch of football-brained morons all the time. It was frankly quite a shame.<br />
Last in the row, was Claire. Claire, unlike most of the class, Liam was pretty decent friends with. She had similar interests to Liam, including listening to the same music. They got along really well. She had a reddish brownish hair. She was sweet, she listened very well, and laughed at a lot of Liam’s attempts at jokes. Liam, unlike a lot of other girls, didn’t see her as someone who he thought was hot, he saw her more as a friend. And he knew she saw him the same way. <br />
The only real discernable quality about her, visually, were her massive fucking tits.<br />
They were outright the biggest in the class, topping even Miracles fun bags. They were the really... just... big! That’s all that Liam could describe them. He didn’t know the difference between one cup size and the next, but these ones had to be bigger than double D’s, maybe even larger than whatever came after that.<br />
They were clearly her least favourite quality. She had said to Liam that she would like to just wear a t-shirt one day, but couldn’t. Liam asked a pretty dumb ‘why’, completely forgetting about the feature. Even with this aspect of her, he just didn’t feel that way about her, as much as they were perfectly compatible, he just didn’t. And this wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, he liked being her friend rather than boyfriend. But whenever he brought her up to Frank, he’d instantly talk about her boobs.<br />
<br />
That swiftly brings Liam to look at his own best friend, Frank. What an idiot. Liam liked to be honest to himself, Frank was not that smart. In fact, Frank did seem to only thing with his head, and not the one attached to his neck. He was so sex deprived it was nearly laughable.<br />
Frank worked out almost every day, he had defined muscles, he wore a tank top and either jeans or shorts, just to try and show off the muscle he had made. He wasn’t huge, especially when compared to Chase or any of his other squad. The problem Frank faced was also one of his best qualities; he just had no shame. Frank made a joke in pretty much any situation, whether it was actually appropriate or not. Frank brown hair, it was pretty light, closer to blonde than ginger. Frank concluded the very small selection of male students in the class.<br />
<br />
Behind him, was Jane. She had blonde hair, just like Penelope and Vanessa, who were among the four notable blondes he knew by name, only two of which were actually in this class. Liam knew her a lot better than he did before class. She was wearing a red turtleneck sweater and jeans. She had pink panties and a light blue bra that had these little bows... but Liam didn’t really...<br />
He couldn’t deny that his attraction towards her wasn’t increased witnessing that. But then again, Liam still wasn’t very convinced, but regardless, she was generally pretty hot.<br />
<br />
Behind her was a girl that Liam didn’t know her name off of the top of his head. She was the only person in the class that actually had red hair. She was a full ginger. Liam was pretty sure she had braces, but not sure. Other than that, she wasn’t too notable.<br />
<br />
Finally, at the back of the class, in the corner, opposite from Ray, was Paige. She was apparently pretty nice, but Liam he never spoken to her. She was, sadly, pretty noticeable. She wasn’t... the skinniest... on the planet. <br />
Liam didn’t want to be rude, but he couldn’t deny it. She was fat. She was plump, she was overweight. She took up more than the whole seat. Looking over at her, he could actually see a bit of her belly poking out from under her shirt. She had another shirt on over that, but like her shirt, it looked pretty tight. She had ripped jeans that could be pretty cool. It was just... her body.<br />
But she seemed to be nice, she was quiet but definitely not shy.<br />
Now Liam couldn’t help himself from looking at her boobs. They were there. Again, he knew he didn’t know a lot about how women’s bodies worked, actually he didn’t even know how male bodies really worked either. But he guessed that a fat girl’s boobs would be different from a skinny girl’s boobs.<br />
<br />
Liam then realised exactly what he had been looking for, or rather at. Boobs.<br />
Well, not just boobs, he could find them wherever he looked. But what he could change.<br />
He had just looked at his whole class’ chest sizes, and he knew them pretty well by now anyways. He had to just change them... and why the hell would he make them smaller. He thought to himself, who? He could change so many, the small boobed girls to big boobs, or the big boobed girls to massive boobs. But who? Everyone? Just one? Multiple?<br />
<br />
He decided.<br />
<br />
One person in the class, at random, will have their chest grow bigger. Have it grow... in relation to a flat chest, to the size of... uh... coconuts? Watermelons seems too big but oranges seem too small. Coconut sounds good. A good sized coconut size.<br />
<br />
Liam looked around his class to see if it had actually worked.</p>
