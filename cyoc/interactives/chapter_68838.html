<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Inside the Dining Room of the Maxwell residence, Lester’s father mauls upon a large barbeque drenched T-Bone <br />
steak. The man sinks his sharp canines into the juicy meat causing the sauce to splatter onto his white beard <br />
and mustache. He voraciously rips off a piece and begins masticating the delicious beef. “Ain’t ya gonna <br />
finish eatin’, boy?” asks Maxwell as he chews.<br />
<br />
C.J. cringes at the sight of Maxwell’s eating and slowly pushes his plate away. “N-no thanks, mister. I’m <br />
stuffed.”<br />
<br />
“Ah well. Suit yerself.” Maxwell swallows the contents and continues eating.<br />
<br />
C.J. sits quietly as he thinks about his friends and [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]. Soon afterward, he begins to <br />
hear faint shouting in the distance.<br />
<br />
“Awww… C’mon, babe!! Let’s go! It’ll be fab!” begs a rather effeminate voice. Footsteps are heard on the <br />
wooden staircase, and out from the basement door came 2 fairly fat men in suits. <br />
<br />
“I’m not too sure about this… It looks expensive,” replies the larger one. <br />
<br />
The skinnier of the 2 smacks the other on the back with what seems to be a travelling brochure.  “Oh Tony, I <br />
wish you stop being such a cheapskate for once!”<br />
<br />
The larger one groans before walking inside the Dining Room. “So this is where you been Graham. Where’s Allen <br />
at?”<br />
<br />
“Outside sommers (somewhere). He went n’ asked yer limo driver to take that boy’s buddies home,” answers <br />
Maxwell as he continues eating.<br />
<br />
The guy then looks over at C.J. who stares back at him. “Yo kid, how you doing?”<br />
<br />
“Uh… okay, I guess...” he answers timidly.<br />
<br />
“You enjoyin’ your meal?” <br />
<br />
“Y-yeah…” C.J. tries hard to avoid taking a glance at the carnivore across the table and forks in a small <br />
amount of mash potatoes.<br />
The guy then shoves his hand ontopof C.J’s shoulder. “Heh. Well, that’s good.” He then turns back to Maxwell. <br />
“So why he’s still here?”<br />
<br />
“’parently he lookin’ fer anutter’ one of his buddies,” he replies as he wipes his mouth. “And before you gon’ <br />
n start tryin’ ta hide it, the lil’ fella here already knows ‘bout our little “secret.”<br />
<br />
“Oh he does, huh?” He turns his head back to C.J. “So what’s his name, runt?”<br />
<br />
“[INSERT YOUR NAME HERE].”<br />
<br />
“[INSERT YOUR NAME HERE] hmm? Sorry, my mind is coming up blank.”<br />
<br />
The other big guy comes into the dinner room as he looks at the brochure. “Oh look, hon; the cruise is going <br />
to have rock climbing and a big golf course as well!”<br />
<br />
“Adrian dear, I’m in the middle of talking with this kid here. Let’s talk about this later, alright?”<br />
 <br />
“Grrr!! Fine! Whatever!” The big effeminate guy stomps out of the dining room, heads for the hallway bathroom, <br />
and slams the door shut behind him.<br />
<br />
“Hey, this ain’t yer house dammit!!” yells Mawell. “Don’t go slammin’ mah doors like that!!”<br />
<br />
“Sorry Graham. He can be a little hot headed at times.”<br />
<br />
“Tch!” Maxwell finishes his steak and drinks the rest of his beer. Next, he rises from his seat and takes his <br />
and C’J’s plates into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Now then,” says the guy as he turns to C.J. “I haven’t got your name yet.”<br />
<br />
“It’s C.J.”<br />
<br />
“That’s a good runt-like name for you.” He reaches into his suit pocket, pulls out his calling card, and hands <br />
it to the teen. <br />
<br />
“Name’s Anthony Steel, but other’s just call me Tony. I’m part of Customer Relations for Arctos Industries. <br />
I’m pretty sure you already met my superior, Allen, correct?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, he already told me a little about what you guys do.”<br />
<br />
“So what exactly do you know about us?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I know you guys supply and cater to the gay bear society. I also know about your “special” product that <br />
has the ability to change ordinary people into gay bears.”<br />
<br />
“I see… So what do you think of it?”<br />
<br />
“It’s downright sick of course! My friend’s lives were changed because of that thing!”<br />
<br />
“Wait a sec… “Friends”? As in more than one?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, my best friend [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE] was changed into a smelly redneck; possibly against his own <br />
will!”<br />
<br />
“Really? That sound’s awful. Hey Graham, you know anything of this?”<br />
<br />
“Yep,” he shouts from inside the kitchen. “I sold sum special chaw to the son of one of mah ol’ smokin’ <br />
buddies. He probably ended up givin’ some to that boy’s friend.”<br />
<br />
“You what!?” gasps Tony. “Graham, you don’t go selling classified company products to teenagers! Who gave you <br />
the authority to do such a thing!?”<br />
<br />
Maxwell walks back into the Dining Room and looks at Tony in surprise. “Why Allen did o’course. He said it’d <br />
be fine as long as ah sold it to only 1 person. Didn’t he tell ya?”<br />
<br />
Tony shakes his head. “I can’t believe he would allow something like that…”<br />
<br />
“So if I’m getting this straight, sir” comments C.J as he turns to Maxwell. “The person you sold the chaw to <br />
is none other than Cletus Stanley, correct?”<br />
<br />
“Yep, if’n anyone knows where yer friend at; I’d be him.” <br />
<br />
Finally, everything is becoming clear to C.J. Now, if only he could get his hands on the culprit. Suddenly, <br />
the doorbell rings and Maxwell goes to answer it. Before opening the door, he peeps out the side curtain to <br />
see who it is. “Speak o’ the devil; guess whose outside mah door ya’ll?”<br />
<br />
C.J. rises from the chair and anticipates himself as Maxwell opens the door. <br />
<br />
“Well well, if it ain’t Cletus boy. I didn’t reckon I’d see yer hind agin’ (again) so soon.”<br />
<br />
Cletus adjusts his suspender straps and walks inside. “Ah rushed over as soon as ya called. I know ya didn’t <br />
want mahself to come straight away, but…”<br />
<br />
“Can it, boy. Where’s the rest o’ mah money?”<br />
<br />
“In this ol’ chest here. Take it.” Cletus hands over the chest he took from home earlier. “That there’s the <br />
last of what mah pa left fer mah bro and I.”<br />
<br />
Maxwell opens the chest, pulls out a huge wad of cash, and fans through it. “Heheh. Now THIS is what I’m <br />
talkin’ bout! Thanks fer doin’ business wit’ me.”<br />
<br />
“CLETUS!!” yells C.J. as he runs over.<br />
<br />
“Huh? Hey, yer that one twerp from school earlier. What ‘n havens name yer doin’ here?”<br />
<br />
“Where’s [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]!? What’ve you done with him!? I know everything so don’t bother trying to lie <br />
your way out of this!” Maxwell halts C.J. from advancing by grabbing ahold of his arm.<br />
<br />
“Uh… Wh-what yer talkin’ bout, C.J.? Ah ain’t done nutin’ to him.”<br />
<br />
“Hey kid, it’s not good to play stupid like that,” responds Tony as he approaches the group.<br />
 <br />
Maxwell lets go of C.J’s arm. “The boy here knows what’s goin’ on, Cletus. Jus’ tell’em where he’s at <br />
already.”<br />
<br />
“Fine… He’s stayin’ wit’ me at mah house now. I’d be bes’ you jus’ forgit ‘bout him though. Yer friend ain’t <br />
ever comin’ back.”<br />
<br />
C.J. begins to tear up. “Like hell I will! You don’t understand! He’s more then just a friend to me!  He’s… <br />
He’s... Dammit, I love him! He may not have known, but I’ve always had feelings for him. I’m not going to sit <br />
by and watch as my best friend is taken from me!”<br />
<br />
“Woah woah, keep yer britches on boy. It’ll be alright,” consoles Maxwell.<br />
<br />
“So why exactly did you need Arctos’s tobacco in the first place?” asks Tony. “I’m sure all that money wasn’t <br />
spent to change this kid’s lover into some simple bear for no reason at all.”<br />
<br />
Cletus paused. “If’n yall really want to know, I used that chaw in order to get mah big bro back!” he shouts. <br />
<br />
Maxwell eyes widen. “Y’mean to tell us you change this here’s friend into Clifford!?” <br />
<br />
“Clifford?” asks C.J.<br />
<br />
“It’s his older brother,” replies Maxwell. “He got killed in a bad car accident several months ago.”<br />
<br />
C.J. turns back to Cletus. “But why [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]!? Why would you change him?”<br />
<br />
“’Cause it was his parent’s that killed mah big b in that accident!” shouts Cletus. “Yer the one who doesn’t <br />
understand! Mah bro was like mah pappy to me. He was a real nice fella who always stayed at mah side whenever <br />
ah needed him most. All that went out tha window when that fool’s parents decided to speed over 80 on the <br />
highway. What’s worse was that them confounded media jackasses blamed mah bro for tha accident just to satisfy <br />
the masses! “No, it wasn’t the loving couple that caused the accident, but the drunken low-class redneck that <br />
did!” he mocks. “Them folk literally made mah bro the bad guy when it was the other party who caused the <br />
accident!”<br />
<br />
“But that’s crazy!” yells C.J. “Why would you abduct someone who has nothing to do with that incident and turn <br />
him into your dead brother!? You’re insane.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t call me insane. It’s only rightful ah take back what’s stolen from me!”<br />
<br />
C.J. balls his fist up and grits his teeth, “You…”<br />
<br />
Just before he swings, Tony grabs his waist and holds C.J. back. “Don’t. Violence won’t solve anything.”<br />
<br />
“So, have any regrets ‘bout what you did, Cletus?” asks Maxwell.<br />
<br />
“For C.J. here, yeah. Ah know how it feels when someone ya love gets stripped away from ya; fer that, ya have <br />
mah deepest apologies. On the otherhow, ah can’t forgive [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]’s parents fer what they’ve <br />
done.”<br />
<br />
C.J. calms down a little. “But… but…”<br />
<br />
“Ah’m sorry fella, but the guy ya in love wit’ don’t exist ann’more.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, enough of it, Cletus,” comments Maxwell as he turns to C.J.<br />
<br />
“There… There has to be a way to bring him back, isn’t there? Can’t you guys just transform some random guy <br />
into him?” suggests C.J.<br />
“Normally we could, but in this case we don’t have a copy of the boy’s memories before he transformed.”<br />
<br />
C.J. looks down as if all hope was lost. “No…”<br />
<br />
“May I suggest a better idea?,” asks a familiar voice. Everyone turns their head and finds Pryce standing at <br />
the front entrance. Before Cletus had time to react, Pryce creeps up behind him and slaps him in the forehead <br />
with his glowing blue hands. The stout teen instantly went unconscious and falls ontop of Pryce’s black dress <br />
shoes.<br />
<br />
“Al-Allen sir? What are you doing!?” asks a surprised Tony.<br />
<br />
“I prefer not to have this child (Cletus) hear what I have to say,” replies Pryce as he steps over Cletus and <br />
next to C.J. “Now then, I’ve overheard your conversation somewhat; and on behalf of Arctos, I sincerely <br />
apologize for your loss, young sir.” Pryce bows. <br />
<br />
“What my companion here said is correct. Unfortunately, there is no possible way for you to reunite with your <br />
friend before his change.”<br />
<br />
“Th-then what do you suggest, huh?”<br />
<br />
“If you can’t reunite with your friend before his transformation, then I suggest reuniting with him in his <br />
current state.”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean? He’s Cletus’s brother now. He’ll probably never recognize me.”<br />
<br />
“If that’s so, then become Cletus himself.”<br />
<br />
“What!?” yells C.J.<br />
<br />
“Sir, what are you thinking…?” pleads Tony. “How would that change anything?”<br />
<br />
“By becoming Cletus, he will be able to reconvene with his love one to some extent.”<br />
<br />
C.J. goes into a slight panic. “B-but what about my family, my life, &amp; my future? If I become this redneck, <br />
everything I’ve known, everything I’ve worked for will be gone.”<br />
<br />
“If you truly harbor deep emotions for your colleague, then it is a sacrifice you must accept. So what do you <br />
say, child? Would you decide to stay who you are, or will you become Cletus? The choice is up to you.”<br />
<br />
The teen grew silent as he weighs the benefits and consequences of both choices. “Can I have some time to <br />
think about this?”<br />
<br />
“Certainly; however, you only have an hour to come up with a proper decision before this other child wakes. If <br />
no answer is made, then I will conclude your answer is no. Will this suffice?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, excuse me…” answers C.J. as he walks over Cletus and outside to think.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Tony approaches behind Pryce and taps him on the shoulder. “What’s wrong with you, Allen?” he asks <br />
with great concern. <br />
<br />
“First, I heard you gave Maxwell the right to sell off company exclusives, and now you’re suggesting to some <br />
kid about undergoing a transformation that’ll affect him the rest of his life!”<br />
<br />
“Have you forgotten Arctos’s objective, Anthony? Not only do we minister to the bear society, we are to spread <br />
our ways to as many potential civilians as possible.”<br />
<br />
“Are you out of your mind? He’s just a kid, Allen! A K-I-D! He has a whole life ahead of him.”<br />
<br />
Maxwell steps forward, “So? Jus’ cause he’s sum youngen’ doesn’t mean he can’t ‘come one of us. Hell, ya’ll <br />
know ah showed mah boy our ways when he was young; look at him now, he’s a chip off the ol’ block. Maxwell <br />
moves in-between the 2 and tosses his arms around their necks. “Tha more of our kind; the better, right <br />
fellas?” And besides, Tony; you’re already helpin’ us change a youngen’ into a bear in order to hide company <br />
secrets. I’m pretty sure that’s much worser than this.”<br />
<br />
Tony sighs. “We’re changing that other kid because we have no choice! He could end up dead if we leave him how <br />
he is now!” Tony escapes from MaxwelI’s arm. “Whatever. You 2 can do what you want. I and Adrian will take no <br />
part of it.” <br />
<br />
“Pff, suit yerself,” replies Maxwell as Tony goes back downstairs into the basement.<br />
<br />
“Leave him be, Graham. Anthony will come to understand in do time. In the mean time, let’s get this other <br />
child (Cletus) downstairs.”<br />
Maxwell removes his arm around Pryce’s neck and begin’s to help carry Cletus downstairs into the basement.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
As C.J. ponders about his choices, Isaiah can be found relaxing on top of the wooden bench within the <br />
bathhouse shower room. The now Caucasian man lays flat on his chest as Lester peels off the last remnents of <br />
his uncle’s former black skin.<br />
<br />
“How ya feeling, unck?” asks Lester as he works.<br />
<br />
“I’m still a little itchy here and there, but I’m getting used to having all this fur now,” he answers as he <br />
reaches behind and scratches his sparse top-back hair. “How about you? How are you holding up?”<br />
<br />
Lester yawns. “I’m a little tuckered out actually. Normally a couple fellas be doin’ this, but since its jus’ <br />
you an’ me….”<br />
<br />
“Oh… I see. What happened to that one hairy old guy that was here awhile ago?”<br />
<br />
“Ya mean Roger? Uh… he ended up comin’ scared after seein’ ya like this and high tailed it,” he lies.<br />
<br />
“That sucks… For an older man, I thought he was kinda good-looking too.”<br />
<br />
“Psh… that guy was a filthy ol’ pervert…,” mumbles Lester.<br />
<br />
“You say something?”<br />
<br />
“Uh… naw. I’s jus’ thinkin’ how quick mah big unck got used ta bein’ a homo now.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah blushes. “Heheh… yeah, I know right? Like I said before, bein’ attracted to guys isn’t bad at all. I’m <br />
really starting to like it.”<br />
<br />
Lester soons peels off the final covering of skin and slaps his uncle’s stout furry butt. “Whew! That ‘bout <br />
does it. Yer completely a white fella now.<br />
<br />
Isaiah turns his body and sits himself up. “Alright, time to see how much I’ve changed,” he says as he inserts <br />
his large feet into the now small Easton shower sandals. “Dude… Look at the size of my pad’s, man. I didn’t <br />
think my feet would’ve grown this much.”<br />
<br />
“Whoowee, thems a good size bigger than mah pah’s alright. Look’s like ya got a pair of (U.S) size 17’s. Don’t <br />
worry, big feet runs in mah… ah mean, “our” family heheh,” chuckles Lester as he points to his own large size <br />
15’s.<br />
<br />
Isaiah further examines his new self and takes a good look at his thicker arms. From the back of his meaty <br />
hands all the way to his thicker biceps and shoulder pads; his arms is covered in a carpet of brown body hair. <br />
His palm lines and even the general shape of his fingernails are also completely different.<br />
<br />
“The hair on ya head’s comin’ in pretty nicely. It’s startin’ ta look like mine,” compliments Lester.<br />
<br />
Isaiah rubs his scalp and couldn’t believe how different a Caucasian’s person hair feel compared to a Black <br />
person. <br />
<br />
“Wow, look at yerself, man. You really are part of mah kin now, unck. How ‘bouts ya go and take a long gander <br />
at yerself in the restroom while I clean this place up.”<br />
<br />
“Uh… Sounds good,” replies Isaiah as he rises from the bench. To no surprise, Isaiah’s sense of balance is <br />
completely alien in this new figure. As soon as he begins walking, he stumbles to his knees.<br />
<br />
“Need any help?” asks Lester.<br />
<br />
“Naw. I’m fine.” Isaiah utilizes the shower walls and rises from off the floor. His newfound height made his <br />
surroundings look alot different. “Dude, holy shit…! I’m a giant.” Isaiah stares down at Lester and is shock <br />
to see how much he has grown. Before, he was just a tad taller than Lester; now, he’s several inches taller. <br />
Isaiah thinks he might even be taller than Rico now. “Heheh, man; you look like a total shrimp from this <br />
height,” chuckles Isaiah. <br />
<br />
“Ah bet I do,” smiles Lester. “Who knew ah had genes like that in me? I’m guessin’ yer ‘bout 6’4 or 6’5. Heck, <br />
pa is only 6ft. Be glad; yer tha biggest in the family now.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah scratches his chin and could feel some stubble growing in. “I think I’ll head off and check myself out, <br />
man.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, don’t forget yer towel.” Lester picks up Isaiah’s towel from the bench, walks over, and hands it to him. <br />
<br />
“Oh, thanks,” he responds before wrapping it around his waist. <br />
<br />
“Uh… there’s sumthin’ else ah wanna give ya. Bend down for a sec.”<br />
<br />
As soon as Isaiah bends, Lester lunges his arm around Isaiah’s neck, pulls him close, and deeply locks mouth <br />
to mouth with him. Isaiah was surprised at first but soon allows Lester to lead his tongue around his own. <br />
After a good several seconds of intimacy, Lester moves away from him and licks his lips.<br />
<br />
Isaiah is completely flabbergasted by his friend’s action. “Woah, man… Um… That, was really sudden.”<br />
<br />
Lester blushes and smirks. “It’s mah way of officially welcomin’ ya to the family, unck. From here on out; <br />
instead of callin’ me “man” or “dude”, how bout’s ya go ‘head n’ start callin’ me yer lil’ nephew or sumthin. <br />
Id help mold are image between us.”<br />
<br />
“Okay um…. little guy. Eheh.” Isaiah pats Lester on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Yep, me’s n’ you definitely gon’ havta work on this uncle/nephew thing later.”<br />
<br />
“Right--,” Isaiah and Lester laugh.<br />
<br />
Soon after, Isaiah utilizes the wall for balance and slowly paces out of the shower room. Still not used to <br />
his new height, he accidentally bumps his forehead onto the locker room underpass. “Tchhh—Ow..,” he seethes as <br />
he rubs his forehead. He pushes himself from off the wall in order to reach the restroom across the way. <br />
Although a tad wobbly, he quickly get’s acquainted to his new build and begins to walk properly. Before <br />
entering the restroom, he catches an open duffle bag atop of the bench near his locker at the corner of his <br />
eye. He recognizes that it’s Monty’s bag and goes to check what’s inside. “Oh sweet! My clothes!” he rejoices <br />
as he pulls out his blue jeans and T-shirt. He then compares the length of his jeans to his legs. “Too bad I <br />
can’t wear these anymore,” he says to himself in his head. “Damn; and after I spent so much money on these to. <br />
I don’t want to just throw them away though. They’re the last remnants of my old self.” He tosses the jeans <br />
onto the bench which causes his can of tobacco to sliver out from the pocket and onto the floor. “Oh yeah… I <br />
almost forgot about this.” With no hesitation, Isaiah picks it up, opens the can, and stuff some leaves into <br />
his mouth. The taste is just as satisfying as before; however, he felt strange how he isn’t craving for it <br />
like he was before. Infact, there’s no pain in his chest at all. He’ll ask Lester about it later, but first he <br />
really wants to see how he looks now. <br />
<br />
He stuffs all of his belongings inside the duffle bag (including his old shoes from his locker and his bottle <br />
of AXE from before), shoulders it, and heads inside the restroom. As he walks, he itches at the side of his <br />
jaw again and realizes his stubble is becoming thicker at an alarming rate. In addition, he finally notices <br />
that he has been doing most of his actions with his left hand. He’s a leftie now. Just as he finishes <br />
scratching, he finally comes across a mirror and gawks at the unknown man he sees before him. “Oh... my…” he <br />
silently shrieks as he drops the bag. Isaiah knew he has changed a lot; but to this extent and in such a short <br />
amount of time is simply astonishing. He looks absolutely nothing like he used to. He’s now a giant, hairy, &amp; <br />
a somewhat husky Caucasian male. No one will ever believe he used to be a black teenager. Even he couldn’t <br />
believe a body like this used to be black. Isaiah couldn’t help but to achieve a full hard-on just by looking <br />
at hisself. Before, he thought he wouldn’t come to like his new body; but now, he can’t deny how tough and <br />
manly he looks. He moves his face closer and isn’t surprised by how much he looks like Lester… well, his <br />
nephew. In fact, he looks more like he could be his big brother rather than his uncle. Like him, his head is <br />
bulky and is supported by an equally thick neck. He leans his face upwards, rubs his new dense beard, and <br />
cracks a smirk at how masculine he feels chewing his Tobacco and rubbing his chin fur. Above his charming <br />
hazel eyes lie his thick brown eyebrows. Not only are they really hairy, he’s even sporting a mild unibrow <br />
now. His nose is wide and bulbous and looks exactly like his nephew’s. Just under it is a thickening mustache <br />
which is quickly beginning to obscure his mouth. Even the shapes of his ears are different; the lobes are now <br />
loose and free. He spits some chew in the sink and shakes his head causing his already unkempt short hair to <br />
become even shaggier. “This is kind of awesome,” he says as he backs away from the mirror in order to get a <br />
full-view of himself. He looks down at his firm and hairy size 17 feet and wiggles his toes. Afterwards, he <br />
twists his body, drops his towel, and stands in all of his naked glory. He crosses his arms and watches the <br />
huge erection of his lengthy white uncut penis as it wobbles up and down. He smugfully cocks his head and <br />
says, “So this is what I am now; a stocky and really hairy gay bear.” He hates that his old life is basically <br />
over before it began; but at the same time, he truly loves the way he looks now. In an odd way, he’s quite <br />
overjoyed that he can never go back to his old appearance. He’s now part of the racial majority rather than <br />
the minority. No longer does he have to worry about such prior stigmas; another weight lifted from his <br />
shoulders. Isaiah is quite satisfied with his current body; unfortunately, he knows he’ll have to indulge in <br />
many more changes later. Maybe this ordeal won’t be so bad. He has faith that the rest of his new family will <br />
welcome him with open arms. If not, he’s sure Lester, who’s practically his best friend now, wouldn’t leave <br />
him hanging. Despite the outcome, he believes he’ll continue to live a standard life; perhaps a much happier <br />
one in fact. <br />
<br />
He can’t tell whether his mind-set is being influenced by his tobacco or not, but he’s currently feeling <br />
awfully horny. After bucking his waist, he begins to stroke his mighty shlong with his main hand (his left) <br />
and twists his hard right nipple with his other hand. Isaiah closes his eyes and grits his teeth as his mind <br />
begins to race through various thoughts. He begins picturing all of the men he encountered today and starts to <br />
thrusts his hip back and forth as if he’s really shoving his pride in their hole. He imagines working the <br />
hinds of Rico first, and then he shifts to Lester, Monty, Graham, and even his friends Mark and C.J. He always <br />
wanted to show how rough he could be to those wimps. Finally, he pictures that smelly redneck from school <br />
earlier. At first, he thought that guy was boorish and foul; now, he thinks he’s really cute. In addition, <br />
that foul odor he possessed still lingers in his mind. It was such a masculine and musky stench; to think that <br />
such a handsome bear could be [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]. He could only imagine what his rear smells like. <br />
Isaiah’s baritone grunting intensifies as the thought of shoving his face against that guy’s bum and servicing <br />
his sweaty hole with his tongue is simply too much to endure. He reaches his climax and ejaculates a thick <br />
supply of seed on top the restroom floor in front of him; much more than he could’ve done in his prior body. <br />
After pausing for a minute to recollect hisself, he realizes how much of an affinity for stench he has <br />
acquired. Although he has accepted this change (and is quite enjoying it), he hopes this newfound fetish won’t <br />
develop into something out right disgusting. <br />
<br />
As soon as he calms down, he hears Lester humming a tune as he approaches the restroom. Realizing the mess he <br />
had made, he scampers for his towel to clean up but is caught by Lester just before he bends down. “Um, wassup <br />
Lester? Eheh”, he chuckles.<br />
<br />
Lester notices the whitish puddles, walks up to Isaiah, and tugs his thick shoulder hair. “Didn’t ah tell ya <br />
ta start callin’ me nephew-like stuff, unck? I’m “boy” to ya.”<br />
<br />
“Ow! Alright, Alright! Let go of my hair, boy!”<br />
<br />
Lester lets go and slaps his uncle on the back. “Much better!  So what’er ya doing, unck? Cleanin’ up your <br />
nut?”<br />
<br />
“Um…yeah. Sorry ‘bout this. I was just so turned on by my new body that I… well, did this.”<br />
<br />
“Heh; ah was only joshin’ wit ya. I didn’t thank it actually was. I’m glad yer fancying the new you though. <br />
Don’t get too comfortable; ya got a lot more changes a comin’.” As Isaiah wipes up his jizz, Lester notices <br />
the duffle bag on the floor. “Ah, I see ya found yer boy’s bag. Don’t be shy to take a gander through it. All <br />
thems stuff inside’s yer property now too.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, thanks for getting my clothes back. I appreciate it.”<br />
<br />
“Anytime,” answers Lester. “Hey… stop scrubbin’ that crap and let’s get a move on. My pa wants to see his <br />
brother. One ov’are boys will clean later.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah stands and flips his towel on his shoulder. “What am I going to wear though?”<br />
<br />
“Ya got some stuff in that bag of yers.”<br />
<br />
“I grew out of all my clothes, man… I mean, boy.”<br />
<br />
“I ain’t talkin’ bout that ol’ crap.” Lester opens a different pouch from the bag, searches through it, and <br />
pulls out a gray muscle t-shirt. “Catch,” says Lester as he tosses it to his uncle. On the front is a highly <br />
elaborate design of a confederate flag with a flaming skull and a chopper motorcycle. Not only is it highly <br />
damp with sweat stains, it’s littered with dirt marks and is torn slightly at the bottom. <br />
<br />
Isaiah gives it a little sniff. “Peww…!” he reacts in disgust.<br />
<br />
“Pew… Nutin’. Admit it; I know ya be liken that there musky smell,” replies Lester as he points at his uncles <br />
slight boner. Then, he pulls out some dark grayish boxers, approaches Isaiah, and exposes the inner fabric <br />
under his nose. <br />
<br />
“St-stop, Lester.”<br />
<br />
“Heheh, yer big willy’s excited,” he teases as he fiddles with his uncle’s stiffining member. “Don’t be <br />
‘shameful of yer pleasures, unck. Us bears here at the Triple Crown take full pride of our fetishes. I happen <br />
to have a thang fer nerdy skinny fellas wit’ glasses. Ah ‘specially fancy it when they start squealin’ like a <br />
lil’ piggy. But that’s besides’ the point. Here.” <br />
<br />
Isaiah hesitates before taking the boxers. Like the shirt, it’s also very damp with man sweat. In addition, <br />
there’s a hefty-sized brownish-green shit stain and dried precum plastered on the inside. The foul smell began <br />
to clog his mind with salacity. <br />
“What’er ya waitin’ for?” asks Lester. “Stop bein’ such a pussy and sniff it. I know ya really want to.”<br />
<br />
“Dammit… forget it. Lester’s right,” thought Isaiah. “I’m no longer that little pussy boy I used to be. I’m a <br />
real man now. No, a real bear of a man; and I need to man up or else my family won’t accept me.” He closes his <br />
eyes and takes in as much of the stench as he can. The stench of man fills his nose with lust causing him to <br />
grunt and slowly lick the shit stain. “mmmm…” he moans as he begins to smear the boxers across his face.<br />
<br />
“That a boy, unck. See? Ya don’t need ta hide yer feelings any longer. Yous and mahself are family. As a <br />
matter of fact, all ovus bears at the Triple Crown are family; and yer a genuine Triple Crown bear like the <br />
rest of us.”<br />
<br />
As Isaiah continues to moan, he also raises the sweaty muscle shirt and starts smearing it along his face as <br />
well. Once again, his lengthy penis hardens and precum immediately begins to slip out. Before he really drowns <br />
himself in ecstasy, he straightens up and slowly returns to his senses. A big grin appears from out of <br />
Isaiah’s thick beard and he spits some more tobacco in the sink. ”Your damn right I’m a bear, boy,” he proudly <br />
claims. “I won’t hide it any more; the stentch of a man’s sweat, crotch, feet, and ass drives my crazy now. <br />
Really, I love it so much. I like what I’ve turned into so far, and I’m honestly looking forward to what’ll <br />
happen next. From now on you’ll never hear me dread of the past or make another complaint again. This is a <br />
fresh new start of my life and I’m going to enjoy every new aspect like the proud gay bear that I am. Like a <br />
true man. I promise.”<br />
<br />
“Glad to hear! I’m proud of you,” smiles Lester as he rubs his uncle on the back. “And I’ll be here fer ya <br />
every step of the way, big guy. I’lls take good care of ya.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah is overfilled with joy by Lester words. He lightly kisses his nephew on the forehead and caresses the <br />
back of his head. “I know you will, boy. I know you will. Let’s finish up here and go meet up with your <br />
daddy.”<br />
<br />
After Isaiah spits out the rest of his tobacco, he tosses on the dirty muscle shirt and slides on the filthy <br />
boxers.<br />
 <br />
“That’s a mighty fine fit there. Them garments be much better on you than it ever did on Monty’s fugly hind <br />
that’s fer shure.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, so these are my boy’s clothes?” asks Isaiah as he smears the fabric against his crotch. “I didn’t think <br />
he’d have such a fruity odor to him.”<br />
<br />
“Get used to it ‘cause he ain’t too keen wit’ hygiene.” Lester pulls out something else from the bag. This <br />
time, it’s a long gray sweat pants to match his muscle shirt. There’s a large flaming hot streak design <br />
engraved on the side of the left leg. “He’d been workin’ out in this stuff fer the last several mornings. The <br />
boxers and pants stretch so ya ain’t got ta worry bout’ bein too big to fit ‘em.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah grabs the pants and doesn’t hesitate to put them on. He became quite fond of his stomach flab slightly <br />
hanging over the pants and jiggles it. “You ready? Everything’s cleaned up right?” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Other then yer milk on the floor, yep. Ah gots all yer old skin in a trash bag rearin to be burnt.”<br />
<br />
“Burnt? I guess you have to destroy the evidence, huh?”<br />
<br />
Lester nods his head. “mmhmm, sorta. Everything ya brought here’s gonna hav’ta go. There can’t be any traces <br />
of yer old self ever bein’ here.” <br />
<br />
Isaiah reluctantly looks down as he knows he’ll have to get rid of his old clothes. It’s not like he’ll be <br />
able to wear them again anyway.<br />
<br />
“Your old clothes’ still in this here duffle bag, right?” asks Lester as he searches.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, go ahead and toss them. My wallet should still be in my old pants pocket to. I’m your uncle now and I <br />
don’t want any reminders of my old self.”<br />
<br />
Lester finds the clothes and tosses them in an empty trash bag. “Hey unck, I’m glad yer committed now, but <br />
don’t forgit that yer still you. If’n yer ain’t careful, yer gonna end up throwin’ away a load more than just <br />
yer clothes.”<br />
<br />
“Right.” After Lester finishes up, Isaiah slides on his sandles again, re-shoulders’ his duffle bag, and the <br />
two of them began to exit the back compound. Once outside, Isaiah takes in a deep breath of fresh air. He’s <br />
been locked inside that place for far too long and it’s good to finally see the night sky again. As they pace <br />
towards Lester’s home, they discuss more about the transformation and the final outcome. Other than the <br />
primary plan of turning Isaiah into a strict manager and Monty’s father, Lester didn’t know much as well. <br />
Isaiah hopes his brother will give him some answers.<br />
<br />
“So unck, how old do ya think yer are now?” asks Lester as they continue onward.<br />
<br />
“I’m still technically 18, right?”<br />
<br />
“HA! Not lookin’ like that ya ain’t.”<br />
<br />
“Heheh yeah, you got a point. Well… I guess I’m in my mid twenties now. Yeah, I think I could probably pass as <br />
27.”<br />
<br />
“A 27 year old as my big unck? Ah reckon that’ll do fer tha time being. Jus’ ta let ya know, ah’m 20, Monty’s <br />
29 and ah think mah pa is 62, I’s forget. Don’t tell him that.”<br />
<br />
“You’re 20 and still in High School?”<br />
<br />
“Ah got set back twice. This be mah final year and ah can’t wait. Fuck school.” <br />
	<br />
“I know! Same here. Oh wait! I’m 27 now. I’ve already graduated a long time ago.” Isaiah laughs heartfully. He <br />
then pauses, looks at his meaty hands, and smiles. “Wow, to think I’ve changed this much and in such a short <br />
amount of time.” Then, he began to flex his arms and do various poses as if he’s a bodybuilder while walking. <br />
“Mmgh!” he grunts as he strikes a pose. “I went from being an emotional wreck to this manly bear that can’t <br />
wait to keep changing. I mean, I actually want to become just like that bear I was in my dream. And it’s all <br />
thanks to you, boy. You’ve stayed at my side supporting me and helping me man up to bring out my true nature; <br />
for that I thank you from the bottom of my heart.”<br />
<br />
“Aww shucks, yer makin’ me blush agin’, unck. Don’t thank me. Wes more than just friends now, we’re kin and <br />
kin should ahways help one anutters.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah gleefully throws his left arm around his nephew’s neck and pulls him close. “Oho, you don’t know how <br />
right you are, boy. I’m glad my bro raised you to be such a respectful young man.” <br />
<br />
“Hot dog! Yer really are startin’ ta sound like mah uncle.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah gives Lester a really rough noogie. “That’s cause I AM your uncle, boy,” he smiles.<br />
<br />
“Hey! C’mon, unck. Quit rufflin’ up mah hair.”<br />
 <br />
“Aww! Don’t be such a wuss, kiddo.”</p>
