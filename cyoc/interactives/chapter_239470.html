<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was no way Steve was going to be able to edit the sentence if the contraction started.  That meant that he had to take a chance on standing up, slowing the rate at which the contraction was building up, and editing the sentence in what little time he had left.  <br />
<br />
“No!” a voice inside of him cried out, “the baby can come out much easier if you stay squatted!  Just relax, take a deep breath, and push!”<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that Steve’s eyes were open, he once again saw a vision of the rabbit girl from the mirror.  She was standing in front of the mirror, chest slightly bent down as her fingers dug into the sink.  Ears drooping in front of her head, the rabbit girl’s tail wiggled in agony.<br />
<br />
Steve could see her face, eyes closed as her fur was matted with a mixture of sweat and tears.  Her mouth was moving, “Please!” he could hear her scream, “please it hurts so badly!”<br />
<br />
“Arghhhh!” She screamed as she continued clawing at the sink, “why won’t anybody help me?”<br />
<br />
Just like before, two rabbit ears were protruding out of her overstretched vagina, behind which Steve could see the grey dome of a baby’s head.  But that head was thoroughly wedged inside of the struggling rabbit, and for all her struggling and crying, the rabbit girl didn’t seem to be making any progress in coaxing it further out.<br />
<br />
A calm, soothing voice once again came from inside of Steve’s own mind, “see, fighting will only make it worse.  You can’t give birth while you’re standing.  Stay squatted, it will make everything so much easier for you.”<br />
<br />
Steve felt his willpower drain.  There was something about watching that rabbit girl struggle…<br />
<br />
No, Steve realized, there was something about watching his body struggle – about watching *her body* struggle – in an agonizing, endless labor that transferred all of the strength that Steve had mustered directly into his womb and straight into the muscles that his body needed to prepare for its continued efforts at birthing.<br />
<br />
She’d just stay squatted and lay back as her body pushed the first baby out, followed by the second.  Then she’d get to rest as she sat down and let the babies suckle from her tender, milk filled breasts.  The birth would come so quickly and so easily, and then she’d get to bask in the warmth of her babies nursing the milk from her own body.<br />
<br />
Steve was about to give in and drop her phone when another muscle began to spasm. Unlike the earlier spasm, which had come from the walls of her vagina, this one came from higher up in her womb.  And while the spasm wasn’t coordinated or powerful, it did cause the head that was currently pressed into her cervix to shift ever so slightly.  That shifting came with a new sensation – she could feel the sides of one of the baby’s ears just barely pushing into a small hole inside of her.  That hole, she felt, led down into her vagina, and was what she was going to have to get the head to squeeze through if she wanted to give birth.<br />
<br />
She knew that was she was feeling was the very beginning of her cervix dilating.  The current opening couldn’t be more than a fraction of a millimeter, which was just barely enough for a bit of the baby’s ear to poke into it.  Jeeze, she thought, there was no way that the baby would be crowning anytime soon…<br />
<br />
That last thought – that her body wasn’t anywhere near ready to give birth – contrasted so sharply with the lie that it had been trying to tell her earlier, that it led to a series of more thoughts:<br />
<br />
“This isn’t going to be easy,” Steve told herself, “I’m nowhere near ready to give birth.”<br />
<br />
Steve realized that simply squatting down wasn’t some easy, simple solution to the what the app had outright told her was going to be a long and suffering filled labor.  No, the rabbit girl that she’d seen earlier wasn’t some possibility that staying squatted would avoid.  It was her inevitable reality - *if she stayed squatted.*  <br />
<br />
Steve’s way out of this wasn’t to give in or endure.  It wasn’t to give birth or become a mother.  Steve’s only way out of this was to be a man.<br />
<br />
“I’m not giving birth!” Steve shouted as he rerouted every ounce of willpower into standing up and felt as his legs pumped his body upwards.  Now upright, Steve could feel the winding of his female muscles slow down, buying him the time that he needed.<br />
<br />
“I’m not a woman, I’m a man!” Steve cried out in the deepest voice that a rabbit girl’s body could muster.  Opening the app, Steve selected saw the sentence:<br />
<br />
“The anthropomorphic rabbit is in the bathroom.”<br />
<br />
He selected “anthropomorphic” and opened up the keyboard.  One of the babies kicked out against his diaphragm, almost knocking the wind out of him.  Sucking his breath in, Steve stood firm as he held onto the phone. <br />
<br />
M-A-L-E<br />
<br />
The first word was in place and Steve moved to “rabbit”.  His cunt burned, his lower back ached, and he could feel the muscles around his womb begin to tighten.<br />
<br />
H-U-M…<br />
<br />
His abdomen grew tighter and tighter as Steve felt his upper body begin to be pulled forward by the strain.  The contraction was almost there, and Steve knew that it would pull his body forward, causing him to lose his balance as soon as it hit.<br />
<br />
A-N<br />
<br />
The switch flipped and Steve could feel the electricity running down his spine, signaling his muscles to ignore his commands as they pointlessly tried to press the babies inside of him through the miniscule opening in his barely dilated cervix.<br />
<br />
A wave of fire began spreading up from the lips of his vagina as muscles tensed and ligaments strained.  Steve didn’t have a choice as he went bowlegged and his upper body continued to be pulled forward.  He tried extending his tail as far backwards as he could, as though the weight of the tiny thing could somehow counterbalance gravity’s effect on the two huge breasts hanging off his chest.<br />
<br />
“Ahhhh!” Steve cried as spindles of lightning began emanating out of his womb.  All he had to do was to click submit and this nightmare would be over, but the pain was so intense that tears now filled his eyes.  That female propensity to go to tears, and Steve’s brief moment of weakness that had allowed it to happen, was the worst possible thing right now for Steve.  Tears filled his eyes to the point that his vision became so blurry that he could no longer make out the submit button in the app.<br />
<br />
“Yes…” a mental voice cooed, “give in.  You’re not a man, not anymore.  You’re not even human.  All you are, and all that you’re ever going to be, is a petite little rabbit girl who’s in labor.  And once this one’s over – and it will be quite some time before it is – you’ll go into heat and get to do this all over again.”<br />
<br />
This fucking body!<br />
<br />
“I’m not a girl and I’m not giving birth!” Steve screamed at the top of his lungs as he slammed a petite finger into the phone’s screen.</p>
