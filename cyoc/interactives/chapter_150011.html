<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While there was mainly good things, and probably a few &quot;bad&quot; things (depending on your definition, but mostly about would-be Romeo&#39;s hurting themselves in attempts to show off), there was one thing that was considered the strangest thing ever to happen in Animalia. It turned out a group of four guys and seven girls rented a room at the Worldmeet Glade. But when there was a problem with one of the credit cards used to pay for the room, they sent a message to said room telling them to come to the register. But when they didn&#39;t get a confirmation, they sent a guard to investigate. What they found was certainly strange, if somewhat amusing.<br />
<br />
It was seemingly best described as an aftermath of an orgy, but to prevent anyone sensitive to such a scene, it was best described as a &quot;great big giant mess that would make the hotel room from the beginning of <I>The Hangover</I> the height of cleanliness and absolutely reeking with musk&quot;. But one of the guys, who was newly converted and double dosed into a Gila monster Animalian and was found with his wrists and ankles &quot;shackled&quot; to the bed, was at least coherent enough to explain what happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can probably guess what happened in a very easy way.&quot; said Dr. Jones to the press (filtered by the PR-MD offices) who wanted to know what happened. &quot;The brothel in Las Vegas that the ladies worked at went under, but they had saved up enough from working there, along with the money from selling their business, to buy some Animalia Virus doses for a &quot;last day of humanity&quot; party. After that, what was clearly intended to be a quiet night out got out of hand, and as we all probably know, they started &#39;dancing on tables&#39; and &#39;calling their bosses to tell them what they really think about them&#39;. This morning they began the stage of &#39;waking up asking themselves &quot;What did I do last night?&quot;&#39;.&quot; At that, there was much sympathetic nodding of heads because at least one of those present had encountered a similar thing, not that they would admit it. &quot;Right now they&#39;re getting their paperwork filled out, so we&#39;ll probably have some more then.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Horizon lab was analyzing the &quot;evidence&quot; that was found at the scene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two dozen pairs of spiked heels;&quot; said the lab assistant, whose face was clearly reading <I>I don&#39;t know whether to laugh or vomit.</I>, &quot;Fourteen custom made &#39;toys&#39; ordered online, and... something I really don&#39;t want to identify, but can guess it comes from college drinking parties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just like my great uncle used to say.&quot; said her co-worker, &quot;<I>Some kids are just happy playing in the sandbox; while others just want every toy in the store</I>. But I&#39;m guessing that he was referring to children who have several toyboxes filled with children&#39;s toys, not this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can say that again.&quot; said the first.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
While, elsewhere, paperwork was being filed on the four guys and seven ladies that were found in the room. Because of the unusual circumstances, they were also doing background checks on each and every one of them. It was also considered a given that all those who had taken part in the party were all double dosed. While it was guaranteed that the room they stayed in was pretty much trashed, and the eleven of them were going to have to pay for it, it was at least something to have names to go with the species.<br />
<br />
First was Betti (habitually spelled with an &#39;i&#39;). She was clearly one of those who could be best defined as being mentally &#39;disabled&#39; as well as having a low IQ score. Having dropped out of high school in Junior year, she had eventually been picked up by the old owner of the brothel. She was clearly different from the other deer Animalians due to the fact that she still had her long, golden blond, hair, but fortunately, Laura&#39;s &#39;herd&#39; (informal name for it) was able to overlook her differences and help her adapt to her new status as an Animalian. While she technically hadn&#39;t gained any &#39;size&#39;, it was probably because she had her silicone implants removed before the party, and the Animalia Virus had healed up all the stitching and scars that resulted.<br />
<br />
According to records, Dao (the second to regain consciousness) was Vietnamese. Her mother had been one of those who had fled when Saigon fell, and married a man in California. Dao herself had been born in 1980, and was now converted into a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig Animalian. But what made her different from other members of her species was that she was not only slimmer, but also taller and curvier.<br />
<br />
Kelly was different from the others because while she was also perfectly &quot;slim and stacked&quot; (as some called her), she was also perfectly capable of working in an office setting, at least. While she was an &quot;albino&quot; rat Animalian, she still kept her long, dark hair. Right now she was &quot;assigned&quot; to work with the Piper Clan in managing their newest members, which she proved to be surprisingly capable of. According to Sarah, the owner of the now folded brothel, she was in charge of management and accounting.<br />
<br />
Lisa was considered the &quot;great Joker&quot; at the brothel they once worked at, so it wasn&#39;t any real surprise that she had decided to become a hyena Animalian. But unlike the other, herm, hyenas, she had opted instead to not become a herm, and thus had some of her conversion fees reimbursed. She was now working part time at the Meat Market as a stand up comedian, often poking fun at the many things that government officials, at least, found offensive about Animalia&#39;s existence.<br />
<br />
Sylvia was another relatively new case. Not only was she a horse Animalian, the species she had &quot;ordered&quot; was a Bavarian Warmblood, which sort of made sense when her records show that her lineage came from southern Germany. While she had signed up too late to take part in the IAC Sporting events or the Fashion Show, she was perfectly capable of getting plenty of practice for the next one. Meanwhile she was working on the Brown Farm as a farmhand, even though she needed the occasional reminder to stay focused on her work.<br />
<br />
Finally, Sarah, who was the owner of the brothel that had folded, was a Gila Monster Animalian. She was certainly the &quot;biggest&quot; of all the girls, which wasn&#39;t hindered by her now enormous tail. She was the one who had orchestrated all this and needed the most time to recover from the hangover that resulted. This did result in a funny scene between her and Sgt. Grail.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s back there?&quot; asked Sgt. Grail of the hotel staff, having stuffed tissues into his nose in an attempt to block the smell. At the confirmation he went over to her resting place behind the bed. &quot;Are you Sarah?&quot; he asked, but it would seem that she barely had enough strength to answer, from the grunt that answered the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you curled up behind the bed?&quot; asked Sgt. Grail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I?&quot; asked Sarah, finally answering in understandable words. &quot;Ugh... my head... my tail... ugh... so heavyyy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you end up in this sorry state?&quot; asked Sgt. Grail.<br />
<br />
&quot;... just wanted to let off some steam with my girls...&quot; managed Sarah. &quot;One of the boys... said that he had just the thing...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And did that thing come in a bottle?&quot; asked Sgt. Grail, somewhat realizing what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;...yessss....&quot; confirmed Sarah, barely.<br />
<br />
&quot;This empty bottle of Kentucky straight bourbon, or this empty bottle of Jack Daniel&#39;s finest whiskey?&quot; continued Sgt Grail, starting to smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re... both empty...?&quot; asked Sarah, &quot;Oh... boy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it might be time for the mandatory fire drill?&quot; said Sgt. Grail.<br />
<br />
&quot;... I&#39;ll pay you a million dollars not to do that...&quot; managed Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make it two million and you&#39;ve got a deal.&quot; said Sgt. Bash, clearly smiling now.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a dang pirate...&quot; Sarah barely managed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I could have one of my corporals come up hear to sing to you.&quot; continued Sgt. Bash.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate you.&quot; said Sarah simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;I hate you...&#39;&quot; prompted Sgt. Bash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir.&quot; finished Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you were, private.&quot; finished Sgt. Bash.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
As it turned out, the four men the ladies picked up, Andrew (now a horse Animalian); Biff (the Gila Monster Animalian that helped put things together); Caiden (Mouse Animalian), who was the youngest of the four; and Dean (pig Animalian), were all college students at UNLV who were looking for a way to celebrate Caiden&#39;s 21st birthday. Dean had just bought the Jack Daniel&#39;s Whiskey and the Kentucky Bourbon when the seven women had apparently charmed them into their communal room, but that was where things got a little blurry. They felt obliged to transfer to Pi Eta Tau from their old fraternity, Alpha Tau Omega, but the frat gave let them leave with full &quot;honors&quot; due to the fact that they now had a reputation (and bodies) that most frat boys would only dream of. All four of them were able to be let off with minor charges of &#39;vandalism&#39; in return for their cooperation, but they still had community service to deal with, so they decided with helping take care of trash during the IAC.</p>
