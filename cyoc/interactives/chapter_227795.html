<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Felicity sighed, walking into the school after being dropped off. Despite Choon Hee taking her car for a week, the Boss was surprisingly okay with how things went.<br />
<br />
It had been a surprise as Felicity was led to the Boss’s office. At first she thought she would be punished, perhaps killed as the Boss wasn&#39;t exactly known for his patience. Instead, the Boss had chastised Choon Hee. As Felicity listened, he asked the kumiho what Felicity was supposed to do? She was on an infiltration mission to learn about the wizards in this high school, in this timeline. Considering the interaction with Hinata was accidental, her exposing herself would have helped no one. As she was dismissed with a slap on the wrist (the loss of the car for a week) she could hear what the Boss had to say to her handler.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop pissing her off before she ends up fighting us!&quot;<br />
<br />
That line alone made Felicity smile. As much as she hated following the Boss’s orders, she realized he saw her as important to his goals. It was a small comfort, one made even more enjoyable as Choon Hee remained oddly quiet during the entire ride. As she now made her way towards her locker, she smiled as Winery sped towards her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Winery said, giving the blonde teen a tight hug. &quot;Got worried when I didn&#39;t see you car.&quot; Felicity could feel her pulse quicken, what was with her? Was she developing feelings for a werewolf?! &quot;Yeah got grounded for a week,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Means I&#39;m getting a ride to school.&quot; <br />
<br />
Winery apologized, offering the tried and true mantra of all teenagers, it wasn&#39;t fair. Felicity agreed, the two blondes sharing a quiet, awkward moment before being interrupted. Felicity watched as a tall boy with shaggy black hair now called to Winery, quickly approaching before giving her a hug. &quot;You okay,&quot; he asked. &quot;Mia told me about the attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Winery smiled. &quot;It&#39;s stupid really, I got knocked out by Rexie when that assassin tossed her into me.&quot; Felicity watched Winery blush with embarrassment as the tall boy stifled a laugh. &quot;Oh where are my manners,&quot;she said. &quot;Zack this is Felicity. Felicity this is my boyfriend Zack.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicity offered a small wave as Zack extended his hand. Studying the teenage boy carefully, she was impressed by what she saw. Zack was their age, a high school Freshman like Winery and the others. Standing over six feet tall with a generous amount of lean muscle and a botishly handsome face, Felicity could understand why Winery would date him. He was gorgeous, perhaps the cutest boy in the school. Even better as she talked with him, she found him to be polite, friendly, and incredibly respectful. &quot;Geez I just meet this guy and I think I&#39;M crushing on him,&quot; Felicity thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you seen Annie,&quot; Zack asked Winery, shaking Felicity from her thoughts. &quot;Mia said she was looking for her.&quot; Winery shook her head, before raising an eyebrow. &quot;So you went to see Mia before you came to see me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I kind of ran into her when I came in,&quot; Zack blushed. &quot;I was coming to find you though Winery. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re angry at her? You know she’s my best friend.&quot; Winery sighed, it was so hard to stay angry with Zack. He was too nice of a guy to ever cheat on her. &quot;I know,&quot; she said. &quot;I know nothing is going to happen between you two.  I just wanted to see you first. Why don&#39;t you check Akiras office, he probably wanted to see her after everything that happened.&quot; Zack nodded, offering Felicity a polite smile and wave before giving Winery a gentle kiss. As he sped off, Felicity couldn&#39;t help but watch him go. One sentence being the only thing she could think of to describe him.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is he so fucking hot? And respectful?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats just Zack,&quot; Winery laughed, watching Felicity turn crimson in embarrassment. &quot;I said that out loud didn&#39;t I,&quot; she asked sheepishly, turning to the werewolf princess. &quot;Pretty much,&quot; Winery smirked. &quot;But you&#39;re right. Zack Cortland is an amazing guy. He&#39;s honest, friendly, never has a bad thing to say about anyone and like you said fucking hot.&quot; Felicity frowned, watching Winery giggle. As she studied the werewolf though, she could sense she was holding something back. &quot;I&#39;m sensing a but,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s dumb,&quot; Winwry sighed. &quot;I mean Zacks perfect, plus he&#39;s a werewolf but...I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s dumb...he just...he just feels too safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Safe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Winery said, her shoulders slumping. &quot;Like, I don&#39;t know, he never does anything wrong. He&#39;s like too perfect. At first it was great when we started going out but now, I don&#39;t know. I...I kinda want something more exciting.&quot; Felicity nodded, internally sighing at Winery’s dilemma. Although she was experiencing being a teenage girl for the first time, she had been a teenager once. Being a teenager was about rebellion, doing things your parents wouldn&#39;t approve of. Years from now, finding a guy like Zack would be every girls dream. Right now though, Felicity could tell that regrettably the relationship wouldn&#39;t last.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I don&#39;t want to be a bitch by breaking up with him,&quot; Winery continued. &quot;Zacks too nice, I don&#39;t know. Maybe I&#39;m just being weird. And I being weird?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Felicity said quickly, her cheeks still a bit rosey. &quot;No, I think you need to do what makes you happy.&quot; Winery smiled, thanking her new friend before squeezing her in a tight hug. As she did, Felicity could feel her pulse quicken. She didn&#39;t want to be the cause of Winery dumping a guy like Zack but, if the werewolf was suddenly single she wouldn&#39;t complain.</p>
