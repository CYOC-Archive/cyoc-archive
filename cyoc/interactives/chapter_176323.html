<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up after a short nap and your brain is slow to process weekday is going on,  what has gone on,  who you are,  and where you are. You start to sit up and the weight of your breasts and one question is answered.   Who you are. You are a sexy chick that just fingered by your sexy girlfriend. In your hotel room... another question answered. Your and are sore from clinching during your amazing orgasm and you couldn&#39;t be happier with the result. <br />
Wendy is gone though.  You&#39;re alone.   You look around the room and see a note on the beside table with a glass of water. The water... you hadn&#39;t realized how much you needed it.   After drinking the entire glass you turn your attention to the note.   &quot;Gone out for a bit.   Rest up and shower.  You&#39;re going to need it when I return.&quot;<br />
A shiver runs through your whole body at that prospect. Or is it a promise?  Knowing Wendy, that&#39;s a promise. You stand up and realize that you haven&#39;t even seen yourself fully naked yet. You pull off the bottoms with a small prayer that you don&#39;t revert to your normal body just yet.   As they hit the ground and you step out of them you breathe a sigh of relief. Still sexy. You look over to the full length mirrors lining the closet door and take stock.   Your dark red waves come down below your shoulders.   Your massive tits hang high and firmly.   Your stomach is flat,  but when you flex it you can see your abs show through. Your pussy is a tight little slit and you can barely see your clit sticking out ready for attention. You turn slightly so you can admire your ass again.   It&#39;s a beautiful bubble. Your legs are long and toned.  You can flex them and see a bit of definition. Your nails are the perfect shade and the exact same as your lips.  Oh,  your lips are Angelina Jolie swollen. Your cat eye makeup is perfect to bring out your eyes.   <br />
Your eyes are still yours.   Still the dark blue that they&#39;ve always been.   Still your thick lashes that pretty much every woman has told you that they envied.   But your eye brows are liner and lined up.   Your shoulders are narrower.   Your arms have no bulk. And... yup not a single hair on your entire body below your eyebrows. Amazing!  <br />
You head into the large bathroom and start the shower to warm up and can&#39;t help but look into the mirror.   You realize that the look of your makeup is exactly what you want and do your best to memorize it all. You know that Wendy has the makeup to make it all happen with the exception of your lipstick, but you can pick up more for sure. <br />
Stepping into the shower the warm water wraps you up.   It feels so comforting and foreign having anything touch your new skin.  So amazing.   You look around and there is a shampoo, conditioner,  and body wash already in there.   &quot;I&#39;ll have to have Wendy take me shopping for some of that sexy smelling soap when we get home.&quot; You inner monolog does off a you realize that you&#39;ve just answered your final question.   Who are you? Julia! So very much Julia. <br />
You wash and explore your entire body as you go.   So many sensitive places that you can&#39;t even keep track. You step out of the shower and grab one of the two pink towels.   &quot;Guess it&#39;s time to get used to one of your new colors&quot; you say to yourself.   And then you wonder why both are pink. Hmm, almost like they knew.   You relaxed the towel and pick up one of the super soft white robes.   Good even that feels like it&#39;s trying to have sex with you.   Your nipples rubbing against the material and your clit makes contact with another part. <br />
As you tie it up you hear the door to the room close.  &quot;Honey,  I&#39;m home,&quot; Wendy calls from outside the bathroom door. One last look at the mirror and your ready to go.  Wait,  you washed your face.   Why is your makeup and lipstick still in place? Oh my God,  this is amazing. <br />
You return to the bedroom still tucked into your robeand go straight to Wendy for a passionate kiss.   Breaking away,  she smiles up at you and places her hands on your hips. &quot;You are so hot.   I can&#39;t believe that it worked.&quot;  <br />
&quot;What worked?&quot; you ask her. You can tell that she&#39;s surprised at the question and looks a little sheepish down at her toes.  &quot;What worked?&quot; you ask again a bit more firmly. <br />
&quot;Do you remember me telling you about college? My experimental phase?&quot; You nod. &quot;Um, well when we started planning to come to the island Jack and Julia told me a couple things about their trip. Well,  um, well hell I wanted a specific time or two so I started telling you about my girlfriend Julia.  I changed a couple of things and tweaked her and there. Are you alright with everything? You seemed like you loved earlier,  and we are not done yet baby.&quot;<br />
You are a bit stumped.  She set you up.  She even told you the name of her girlfriend that she wanted to be with. &quot;I do love this,  but I don&#39;t know what to think.   It&#39;s she the love that got away?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hell no,  she was crazy.&quot; She saw the confused look on my face.  &quot;I love you.   I wanted another crazy week and there are a lot of fringe benefits to having a girlfriend.   I wanted to experience it again.   And I wanted you to know what it was like to have mind blowing orgasm after mind blowing orgasm with no wait time.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well,  I think I&#39;ve got an idea of the orgasms.&quot;<br />
&quot;No you don&#39;t.&quot; Her tight knowing smile was back. &quot;You will though baby,  you will.&quot; <br />
Ok, so knowing that you weren&#39;t replacing a lost love helped a lot an put you back at ease. &quot;So what did you change from the original Julia and how did you get me to be her?&quot; <br />
She turned red again. &quot;Um, well,  don&#39;t get mad ok.&quot; A slight nod had her continuing.  &quot;Each night before bed is give you a couple of sleeping pills.  After your fall asleep I&#39;d play a take that I made.  It works like hypnosis,  the same set of words each night and they would set in a a deep memory. I helped set it in for sure by having everything in the first person.   I statements like,  &quot;I have long curly hair.  I have no hair on my entire body except eye brows,  eye lashes,  and my long red hair.&quot; And I had you repeat them back. And I have you a nice hand job or blow job while the tape was playing and you were repeating it.   Basically,  I took all of your learning senses and put them to work.  Verbally saying the words,  auditory hearing the words in first person,  and touch as I brought you to an orgasm with it all.&quot;<br />
&quot;I knew I never should have dated a psychologist.&quot; A smile crosses both of your faces. <br />
&quot;As for the changes,  permanent makeup,  huge kissable lips, upgraded tits, a more sensitive pussy and clit.   You know,  the dream fuck machine.&quot; Her smile and dreamy eyes let you know that she was wanting to get back to business. &quot;So,  are you alright with what I did?&quot;  <br />
You nod. She leans in for a kiss.  &quot;Are you happy with what I did?&quot; You nod again. She kisses you deeply again.  &quot;Do you want to fully explore what I&#39;ve done?&quot; You pull her in for a deep kiss. <br />
&quot;I bought some things from a little shop down the street for us.   Do you want to see?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;  You realize how quickly you answered and from the naughty smile on Wendy&#39;s face you can see that she noticed as well. She stands up and goes over to one of the two bags and hands it to you. <br />
&quot;Go get dressed for me and I&#39;ll get everything else set up. &quot;</p>
