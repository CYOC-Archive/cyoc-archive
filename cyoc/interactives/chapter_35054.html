<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This is a story about a couple so madly in love. Their bond was extraordinary. It was as hard to split apart as an atom, and was as tough as a diamond. But it's not like Romeo and Juliet, where they met once and decided they were true lovers without actually knowing one another. But it was genuine. The names of the couple would happen to be Raijin and Lily. They had some unusual problems to face… Let’s get started with backgrounds. Well Raijin will have to deal with them, most likely...<br />
<br />
Raijin was Japanese, he came over to America when he was 14, meaning he would have that slight accent in his voice, which would probably be apparent for as long as he lived. He was not anything special. He was just thin and lanky, with long dark hair. He was an all around sweet guy, which had to count for something. Though, as he got older he got into weight lifting, honing his body to perfect shape. He was not extremely large, but he was quite big and very toned. He stood in at 6 feet and weighed in at 194 pounds of muscle. His awkward body filled in a bit, giving him broad shoulders and a very well portioned and handsome face. His hair was short, but still a bit shaggy, giving him a playful appearance.<br />
<br />
He was now working at a Karate place up in the city. This was a fancy place with ‘fake’ teachers who knew nothing. Luckily for them, Raijin could be the poster boy and actually TEACH the students something. He was wonderful at his instructing job and the kids adored him. He was an awesome guy, not to mention if he had a tattoo and was a bit bigger, he could pass for that Jin Kazama fellow in those video games. That just spells “AWESOME” to those kids.<br />
<br />
Lily was also 14 and was home schooled, meaning she rarely got out. But she was a beauty alright. She became friends with Raijin one day while she was out shopping with her parents. Her parents liked to see their daughter interact and of course approved of the two being friends. Though, they grew to be more than friends after a year or so. Her parents thought it was quite cute and didn’t have anything against it. She was already a pretty girl, but then grew up to be a drop-dead-gorgeous woman. A perfect smile, bright eyes that just seemed to be twinkling and the hourglass shape that drives men wild. She stood at 5’4” and of course, was light – I say this because you all know women never reveal their true weight. <br />
<br />
She was now in college to work on her medicine studies and was working at her grandfather’s shop. It was an odd shop that involved magic and whatnot. Her parents never bothered to pick up the trade of making magical ointments and potions, since they did not believe in such a thing. But Lily did believe in wondrous ointments that could heal or even change someone to the point of happiness. <br />
<br />
<br />
~~~Thursday  8:10PM~~~<br />
<br />
Raijin fiddled with the remote to start a DvD he had just rented. Lily of course was accompanying him on the couch, twirling his hair around out of boredom. The movie clicked on and the two cuddled up. It was a day after Lily's 18th birthday, and the two decided to spend some time together. As if they ever spent any time apart! Raijin had already been 18 for a while, but he had dropped out of school due to... Well he wasn't so bright. The fact he could own his own dojo later on down the line was enough security for Lily. <br />
<br />
Two hours of laugher, astonishment, anger and awkward moments had passed - ending with the movie being over. The two kissed, as they always did before turning on the lights and just began to talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Raijin, I need to go visit my mom and dad tomorrow and won't be back for a week or so and he re---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say no more.&quot; Raijin chimed in with a slight grin. &quot;I'll help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw you're the best!&quot; Lily giggled, throwing her arms around Raijin. He hugged back and kissed on the cheek. <br />
<br />
&quot;So is your grandfather still... Er you know. Angry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not! He's very understanding. He doesn't care if I go out with a Japanese guy. Especially after the long talk we had.&quot; Lily explained, throwing her hands wildly about. Raijin grinned, he loved it when Lily became sporadic and used her hands to talk along with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be sure to play 'I Miss My Japanese Boy' while I'm away too. It makes for awesome background music. You know like a real movie!&quot;<br />
<br />
Raijin and Lily shared a couple moments of laughter and then another moment of passion which manifested it's self into a deep kiss. Raijin then picked up Lily and took her to the bedroom... Well it's always good to go out with a bang.<br />
<br />
<br />
~~~Friday  8:03AM~~~<br />
<br />
Lily scurried to get all her belongings before she would miss the nine o'clock plane from California to New Jersey. She gave Raijin a quick kiss and hurried out the door. Raijin then took the time to get a shower - which of course was one of his favorite times. All alone with just him and his magnificent body. He sure sounds vain, hm? Well probably just a bit, but it was more of a time just to think about silly things like... What the future holds for him or when the next parody of a scary movie will come out.<br />
<br />
He got dressed up in a body-hugging black t-shirt and baggy jeans. He slowly made his way to the care to make it to Mr. Yuan’s shop – where he would be working till Lily came back. It wasn’t much of a deal and it was probably an easy job. If anything it would probably just be cleaning. Raijin made it o the shop with ease, down in one of California’s many “China Towns” and such. This was a popular one seeing how it was smack dab in the middle of a rich suburb and a city that overlooked a very popular beach. He casually got out of his car, basically showing the goods off for all the girls (and possibly guys) around the area – making his way through the shop’s door.<br />
<br />
“Why hello young one.” Mr. Yuan greeted, along with a smile. It was more like a mask covering the pure disdain for this disgraced his granddaughter was so madly in love with. “Here to help me are you? Well you just need to clean the windows and sweep the sidewalk right now. Then I need help with carrying the new shipment of ingredients in and then organizing the shelves.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Raijin nodded, with a very warm smile. “I guess he did warm up” He thought to himself as he took up a bucket, spray and a wiper to clean the windows. He stepped out of the shop, leaving the seemingly kind old man alone.<br />
<br />
“Oh Raijin. You silly young fool. I’ll have to take care of you… I cannot allow my granddaughter to ruin her life by marrying you. You do know that, correct?” Mr. Yuan said, talking to a shelve of ingredients that could alter one’s entire being if it wanted to do so. “Now what to do… Turn you into an animal… Or have some fun and make you a homosexual which you probably are already... Turn you into a blob of putty? What would make Lily turn from you… Hm. Decisions-Decisions-Decisions…&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Yuan was not a force to be messed with. He had many connections to people who could ruin Raijin. But most of all he had many items that could contort Raijin into a freak or simply make a nightmare of his come true. The problem was... What would he do first?</p>
