<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When I got back into the apartment, I found my mother pacing. She looked at me with concern when she saw I was shirtless.<br />
<br />
“Is Cathy...” she asked, the question lingering and not fully formed.<br />
<br />
“She&#39;s back to normal, Mom,” I replied.  “I let her borrow my shirt, so she wouldn&#39;t get caught naked on the way home. She says she&#39;ll call you later.”<br />
<br />
“Did you..” my mother asked, again letting the question linger without being fully asked.<br />
<br />
“I helped her get control of the wolf,” I said somewhat curtly.  I was suddenly very fatigued, which I was more than eager to blame on the stress of her suddenly losing control, and the semi-rough treatment I got in the elevator.<br />
<br />
“Oh,” my mother said, and then her eyes widened suddenly. “OH.” Her shock switched to concern quickly. “Did she bite you?” <br />
<br />
“No, Mom,” I replied, rubbing my temples. I was feeling more drained and stressed by the second. <br />
<br />
“And you didn&#39;t get any of her fluids in your mouth, did you?”<br />
<br />
“MOM, CHRIST!” I snapped. “I&#39;m not stupid, okay? I just...I got her off.” My head was throbbing, and I could feel myself wobbling slightly. “Is that enough information, or would you like explicit details?” <br />
<br />
My mother frowned. “Honey..I&#39;m not stupid. I saw how close she was sitting to you on the couch, before she got triggered into changing. And I saw her grab your hand. I just want you to be careful. You&#39;re my baby boy, still..and I&#39;m going to worry.”<br />
<br />
“I know, Mom, sorry for snapping at you. It&#39;s been a pretty long night. I&#39;m just gonna go to bed,” I told her,  trying to extricate myself from the situation and avoid worrying her. If I fainted in front of her, I knew that wouldn&#39;t help matters at all.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure you&#39;re okay, James?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I&#39;m fine. I&#39;m just tired. I didn&#39;t get a whole lot of sleep last night.”<br />
<br />
My mother gave me a look that said she didn&#39;t believe me, but instead simply said, “Alright. Have a good night&#39;s sleep. I love you.”<br />
<br />
“Love you too, Mom.” I headed to my room and locked my door, and fell down onto the bed in absolute exhaustion. What in the fuck was going on here? It was a struggle to get my clothes off, even. I started to worry a bit, but reminded myself that I had the ring. If things were still bad in the morning, I would simply wish myself into good health. My panic in the elevator and garage with Cathy, with me blurting out poorly-done wishes simply couldn&#39;t be allowed to happen again. <br />
<br />
I drifted off to sleep almost immediately, only to have a vivid dream of wolves howling and Cathy transforming again, in the light of the full moon. I woke up, covered in sweat, with my hand already wrapped around my shaft and my cock painfully throbbing for release. I quickly finished myself off, groaning in ecstasy as I had a powerful orgasm, shooting my load into the sheets. I made a mental reminder to wash them tomorrow, and then passed out again.<br />
<br />
Another dream followed, this time of me going down on Cathy as she changed. Again, I woke up, covered in sweat. My pillow was damp, as was the fitted sheet I laid on. My hand was again wrapped around my shaft. My other hand-the one that had stimulated Cathy earlier-that I had forgotten to wash- was across my face, the back of it pressed tightly to me. I inhaled, and I could smell her sex, and it smelled incredible. With every inhalation, my cock throbbed again, and ohhhh how good it smelled!  I cranked one out again, spilling more ropy seed across my sheets, and as I finished, a growl rumbled from my throat.<br />
<br />
I sat up in alarm. “Oh no..oh no, no no..” I said, realizing the things I&#39;d either missed or was ignoring from earlier.  I was still severely woozy and fatigued. My body was aching, and I was still pouring sweat. Maybe I had just caught a nasty little flu bug. I wanted to believe that, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I was simply deluding myself. And somewhere, in the back of my mind, I could already feel a presence that hadn&#39;t been there before. It was me, but it wasn&#39;t, if that makes any sense. I needed to take care of this now. There were too many variables. I couldn&#39;t say that I NEVER would want to be a werewolf, at least not for sure...but this was not the right time. I had to use the ring.<br />
<br />
“I wi-” I whispered aloud. My throat seemed to close involuntarily. “I wi-” again it happened. I tried to make a silent wish, as I had the previous week, but every time I tried to mentally wish to not be a werewolf, it felt like my mind was full of static. I tried every trick I could think of in an effort to clear my mind, and every time, it failed.<br />
<br />
“Fuck..” I said, feeling a bit hopeless. And then, another wave of fatigue hit me, and I passed back out again. And the final dream came.<br />
<br />
It was more vivid than the other two combined; it almost felt like reality itself. Cathy again, and we were naked, with the moon rising.  We both succumbed to the inevitable transformation, and I could feel the overwhelming pleasure of the change. Then I mounted her, and we rutted like the beasts we were, howling our pleasure to the moon.<br />
<br />
Again, I woke up to find my hand on my shaft, and the back of my other hand pressed to my lips. I let out a snarl, curling my lips back as I cranked on my shaft once more. I inhaled the scent of the bitch eagerly, and lapped at the remants of her dried musk on my skin. It tasted better than it smelled to me; it was like pure nectar on my tongue and once again, I came, this time impossibly harder than the first two. As I came, a howl erupted from my lips, a weak, human-sounding noise. I was annoyed and slightly ashamed, but then I smiled. The moon was growing fuller by the day, and soon I would be free.<br />
I relaxed, passing out again.<br />
<br />
I woke up to my mother knocking insistently on my door. “James, are you okay?” I heard her turning the knob frantically and repeatedly, even though the door was obviously locked. “James!”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m fine mom..” I said. I swung my legs over the side of the bed as I sat up. What time was it? My brain was still sleep-fogged. I slipped on some boxers and opened the door just a crack. “What&#39;s the matter?”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;ve been asleep for almost two days, James! I nearly called 911!”<br />
<br />
Two days? That was impossible! And then the dreams came rushing back in my mind, and I realized what had happened. “I was just a little sick, mom. I&#39;m fine now. Sorry that I worried you.”<br />
<br />
“Let me make you some dinner?” she asked. I could hear what seemed to be hurt in her voice.<br />
<br />
“I was actually gonna go out,” I said. I wanted to find Cathy. Even the thought of her was making my cock throb. I quickly pulled on some jeans and a t-shirt.<br />
<br />
“Please?” And this time the hurt tone was plain. She&#39;d probably been worried sick. I&#39;d locked  my door, so she couldn&#39;t check on me. And sleeping for two days is not “nothing” in the grand scheme of things a mother might worry about. I felt immediately guilty. I at least owed her a little time.<br />
<br />
“Actually,” I said as I opened  the door, “Dinner sounds great.” She smiled and nodded, but the smile was just for show, judging by the look in her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, James.”<br />
<br />
Soon enough, dinner was ready and...</p>
