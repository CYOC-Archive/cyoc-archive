<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The doctor agrees to let Mark be treated as if he were a common pony animal. Each new day he is fed and given water in buckets, before turned out into a corral. The third new day finds Mark put in with horses in a corral, as he needed to learn how to cope with being half the size of other equines. Mark learns to fight pony style, by hind-leg kicks, the occasional rising up on his hind legs and pawing his fore legs and hoofs at another horse. His use of speaking like a human is useless when in the company of animals, and he discards language for whinnied remarks of how he was feeling at any moment.<br />
<br />
Mark begins to gain a sense of pride about his changed as enhanced physical configuration of a pony stallion penis and his weighty bigger testicles. Corral scents tend to give him arousals that he at first tried to stifle, but after several full-on erections, he finds a sense of personal pleasure from standing with body stretched, his cock wagging up and down, he admiring the sensitivity of it to temperature, a passing breeze, or any fly what wished to lite on and walk the length of his cock from sheath to the trumpet shaped end. Doctor Downway took note of Mark toying with his pony maleness, and thought it time his patient be given a proper pony job.<br />
<br />
It was on a Sunday morning when most of the staff was away enjoying family times that Doctor Downway arranged the transfer of Mark the pony to a new residence. Mark trusted the doctor and made no trouble when he was loaded into a livestock hauling trailer, and his lead rein tied to a steel ring like he were a common, ignorant pony. He then experienced standing on all fours inside a moving vehicle, as he peered at passing scenery, he wondered where they were taking him. He learned soon enough where he was to reside, as the truck and trailer stopped, Mark could smell the scents of other equines like him.<br />
<br />
A willing pony was then led from out the trailer and introduced to his being at a Park offering children pony rides.<br />
<br />
Mark felt quite elated at his being granted a chance to be under saddle and giving children their fun of riding a saddled pony. His delight was countered by the harsh treatment of the Park employees working at the Park stables. The men there had worked with common ignorant and skittish scared animals, but had no experience with a pony stallion being so willing, kindly, and trying to be considerate of people around him.<br />
<br />
Soon enough and Mark found what it felt to have a bit between his teeth, a head bridle, reins across his withers and a saddle strapped snugly to his back, and the tie belt lashed around his belly. A terse man led Mark to join three mare ponies all reined into a carrousel. All Mark could do was hang his head and march along in a circle, he treading on vile filthy sawdust mixed with manure and the occasional release of urine. It was from the urine that Mark learned to sniff and knew what was from a male and or a female pony. The urine scent from female ponies caused his nostrils to tingle, and his erection to hang as he walked round and round.<br />
<br />
Mark learned then about pony lifestyle and monotony, he being more human of mind knew the passing of time and made the dull job seem worse than anything he ever tried. Ten hours of treading in a small circle and his first day of equine work ended with him summarily put into a corral with the other ponies. Mark again found he needed to defend is life and reason for becoming a part of this new herd. It was late at night when the new shift of men came and collected one by one the ponies to the stables and each put in a dirty stall smelling of another pony in their herd.<br />
<br />
With the coming of morning the usual happened, as hay was placed in nets where each pony to grasp at it and munch, as grain was dropped into a small wooden bin for the pony to eat, and a gallon size buck filled with water got placed on a steel hook for a pony to get a refreshing drink. What a pony animal ingests causes some reason to expel both manure and urine there in their stalls. Mark had learned to do his bodily needs come morning like a common pony, but on that first Monday morning the man came and took Mark to a small corral. As Mark stood in his corral, a pony mare was let into the corral aside his, she he noted was sweaty, acting nervous, her tail swatting across her rump, was wide eyed, and ears back when she saw there Mark a stallion pony.<br />
<br />
Mark had a very mundane Monday as he stood with his head hung over the corral fence and smelled the mare her rank scent, he in a full state of arousal had his black cock wagging from some prime-evil wish to jump the fence and get to the mare in need.<br />
<br />
The Park workers there at the stables watched the pony stallion and spoke about using him to do the breeding-quelling of the mares. Mark heard their comments and for his having been human and having morals, he knew too he was but an animal then, and as a stallion part of his new lifestyle was to breed, mate, and bring new life into a harsh world.</p>
