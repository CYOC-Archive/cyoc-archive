<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I remembered howling, and admiring myself in the mirror. I remembered being nuzzled by the two sexy she <br />
wolves. I remembered feeling strong. But beyond that..I remembered nothing. I came to slowly in the morning, <br />
blinking in the harsh light of dawn. My muscles ached, and I started to stretch out, suddenly aware of having <br />
Terri on one side of me, and Night on the other. <br />
<br />
Terri's eyes opened slowly, and she smiled. &quot;Hi babe..&quot; she whispered, before kissing me gently. A hand <br />
reached out and stroked my cheek before turning my head to face Night, who whispered the same words and kissed <br />
me just as gently. I was acutely aware of three things: First, I felt amazingly awake, like I had a boundless <br />
supply of energy. Second, I had a banger of a headache, and most of my body felt like it had been hit by a <br />
truck. Third, I was ravenously hungry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuuuuckk...&quot; I mumbled, rubbing my temples. &quot;I feel hungover, but amazingly awake, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Terri smiled. &quot;Aww, poor baby..I'll go make us some breakfast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome. I'm gonna hop in the jacuzzi,&quot; I said, slowly standing up and walking gingerly to the in-ground hot <br />
tub that her father had installed next to the pool.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'll join you,&quot; Night said, joining me a moment later. Terri busied herself in the kitchen, wrangling <br />
us some breakfast as promised, leaving Night and myself alone. She stared at me with a mix of happiness, lust, <br />
and concern as we sat naked in the hot tub next to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;This thing..with the alpha..it's pretty serious, isn't it?&quot; I asked hesitantly. Part of me didn't want to <br />
know, but I knew I needed to be fully aware of the situation.<br />
<br />
Night nodded and replied softly, &quot;Yeah, it is. He's playing it cool, but most likely he's going to punish at <br />
least you and Terri, if not all three of us if we go to the meeting. The lie..it was a clever gamble, but it <br />
backfired. He KNOWS that Terri deliberately disobeyed him, and I'll end up taking some of the heat over it, <br />
since I'm the one who turned her. That's just the way the pack laws are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How'd you even end up with this douche?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
Night smiled sadly, &quot;I..was in a bad place. Lonely..feeling abandoned..not unlike the way Terri was when she  <br />
and I reconnected.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh..&quot; I muttered, not sure what to say, and feeling rather guilty. I was really beginning to wonder how many <br />
times I'd have to deal with subtle and not-so-subtle barbs being thrown my way about the divorce.<br />
<br />
&quot;That..wasn't intended to make you feel bad, John..&quot; Night said. &quot;It's just the truth. So..any way..I went to <br />
a party, and ended up meeting Devon and his wife. They made me feel special and pretty..and I started hanging <br />
out with them a lot. Eventually, they invited me to a 'private party'..on a full moon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet that was rather freaky,&quot; I said. <br />
<br />
Night smiled, blushing slightly, &quot;I got my freak on, that's for sure. I'm pretty sure that Devon slipped me <br />
something to make me a little more compliant and a LOT more uninhibited. Next thing I know, I was finding out <br />
how deep a wolfgirl's tongue can get inside of me and I'm begging to be bitten.&quot; She lifted one leg out of the <br />
water, resting it on my shoulder as she pointed to a scar on her inner thigh. &quot;I got this a few minutes later <br />
when I sixty-nined another of the pack girls. The next morning, I was in the pack, and that's when Devon <br />
explained the rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you still brought Terri into that?&quot; I growled softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Night snapped, growling back and locking her eyes on me. &quot;You and she were done. DONE. Plus..he wasn't <br />
always like this. At the time, the only girls in the pack were me, Jenna-his wife, Tonya-their daughter, and <br />
Raelynn. Tonya's boyfriend was in the pack..but he disappeared. Same for Raelynn's...&quot; Night trailed off <br />
softly. &quot;After Terri though..every month, it seemed like we got another girl. I..don't know what's going on <br />
with him, or why.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So..if he mates with every female at least once every moon cycle...that means he's nailing his DAUGHTER?&quot; I <br />
asked, my mind seizing on a random detail.<br />
<br />
Night looked a bit uncomfortable. &quot;We've ALL been nailing his daughter..she's a stunning 17 year <br />
old..but..yeah. I've only ever seen him take her in his bestial form. It's..different for us. Incest isn't <br />
exactly a taboo. Yes, it's discouraged..but given the general infertility of werewolves, there's little danger <br />
of a two headed Deliverance child being born. And really..when the wolf gets riled, there's little stopping <br />
it.&quot;  Her words hung in the air, and I couldn't help but wonder if she meant &quot;When he's shifted, Devon is a <br />
monster who doesn't take no for an answer,&quot; or if she was only speaking generally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm..General Infertility of werewolves?&quot; I asked, breaking the awkward silence.<br />
<br />
Night nodded. &quot;Yeah. It's nature's way of keeping us in check, I guess. Given that we can already turn someone <br />
with a bite, and that wolves have litters, we'd overrun the earth if we could breed. So, outside of our heat <br />
cycles, female werewolves are infertile. Male werewolves' sperm is incompatible with a human woman's ova, so <br />
there's no passing on of the condition to others that way either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heat cycles?&quot; I asked. &quot;So..like a wild animal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Night nodded. &quot;Very similar to one..though in werewolves, it leads to complications.&quot; She held up a finger, <br />
knowing that I was going to ask. &quot;I know, I know..I'm gonna explain, don't worry. No, we don't run around <br />
leaking blood everywhere like a fucking dog.&quot; Her voice betrayed mild irritation, and she locked eyes with me <br />
again, as though she'd known exactly where my mind was going. &quot;Don't think of us as dogs..it belittles us AND <br />
you.&quot; Her upper lip curled slightly into a snarl, and I growled back reflexively, which made her smile. &quot;I <br />
LOVE seeing the wolf in you,&quot; she said, leaning in and kissing me, tugging on my bottom lip before breaking <br />
away.<br />
<br />
&quot;The heat cycle lasts around a week. Sometimes four days, some as long as seven. It varies from wolf to wolf, <br />
and even cycle to cycle. It always starts on the new moon, for whatever reason. During that week, the girl in <br />
heat is BEYOND irresistible. We reek of pheremones, designed to attract any male to mate with us, and it <br />
usually calls to the females as well, due to how sex-laden the pheremones are. Our pussies actually NEVER <br />
change back during the heat cycle. We basically can't go out during our cycle, because our pheremones are on <br />
such overdrive that even a human will become sexually aroused and attracted to us. Basically any werewolf in <br />
the same room with us during our heat cycle is going to shift and fuck literally anything around them.&quot; Her <br />
nipples were rock hard as she thought about it. &quot;We can't control ourselves when a heat cycle is involved. <br />
Even being fucked while we're in heat still only results in about a quarter of one percent chance of <br />
pregnancy..but I think those odds might be what Devon's motivations are...I think he wants a dynasty, and if <br />
he's the only one with access during heat cycles, there's no chance any pup that was born would have a <br />
bloodline other than his.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's afraid of a power struggle?&quot; It may have seemed like an obvious conclusion, but this whole world was new <br />
to me.<br />
<br />
Night nodded. &quot;It's the main cause of pack warfare. The bloodlines go back through the ages. Being able to <br />
trace your lineage is a BIG deal. It's an even bigger deal when you're born, not bitten. If he can manage to <br />
establish several children, he'll actually create a NEW bloodline. There's about a dozen original bloodlines, <br />
and those can all trace to four at their roots. If Devon bred enough though..like four pups, each of whom <br />
breeds at least twice successfully, he can gain an immense amount of power within the lycanthropic council.&quot;<br />
<br />
I rubbed my temples. &quot;The lycanthropic council?&quot;<br />
<br />
Night giggled. &quot;Don't worry..I can give you plenty of reading material, if you're interested. Long story <br />
short, The Lycanthropic Council is the ruling body over all the werewolves worldwide. Odds are that you'll <br />
never have to deal with them, even if you reach a very old age. They make very general statements about how <br />
werewolves should act, but since there's only twelve of them, they can't deal much with day to day stuff. I <br />
mean..they have ways, but you have to REALLY do something to draw their attention. They're kind of like the <br />
Pope to the Catholics. It's like..the Pope goes 'abortion is bad'..but not 'Hey, Night..you're bad, because <br />
you had an abortion. All Catholics should kill her.&quot;<br />
<br />
I laughed, &quot;That would raise eyebrows.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled back, sliding over closer to me and wrapping an arm around me affectionately. &quot;To say the least. I <br />
was a Protestant, before I got turned.&quot;</p>
