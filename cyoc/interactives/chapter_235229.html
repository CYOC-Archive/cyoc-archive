<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Let&#39;s do him a favor.&quot; Todd said... &quot;Several actually.&quot;<br />
&quot;You wanna do something nice for him Todd?&quot; Karl asked hesitantly removing his foot from Jeff&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I do. Help him up, wouldja Karl?&quot; Jeff and Karl were equally surprised, Jeff didn&#39;t know if he should run, attack, beg, or anything else, but Todd seemed to have some idea bouncing around in his head... &quot;Perfect. Just stand there and give me a minute.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a warm, comfortable sensation rip through him and began to panic. &quot;Go to the bathroom.&quot; Todd said with a light chuckle and Jeff hurriedly made his way through the crowd which began to part for him as he began to look down on the other students, Todd and Karl were right behind. By the time Jeff got to the bathroom the changes had stopped and the 5 minute warning bell had rung. Jeff looked in the mirror, he was taller, adult height, and his face was peppered with the permanent shadow that men with dark hair color get...<br />
<br />
&quot;So Jeff, now you&#39;re 18, like us, a full blown adult.&quot; Todd chuckled. Karl just looked back and forth between the two, confused.<br />
&quot;You want him to join us?&quot; Karl asked cautiously.<br />
&quot;Actually, in a way, I do Karl. I think he could be really helpful in giving us a great life, and I want to let him in on the action for dropping this lil puppy into our hands. But I think you need some help before you&#39;re ready.&quot; Todd looked at Jeff with a &#39;sorry, the truth hurts&#39; look though Jeff was satisfied with his boy next door look.<br />
<br />
As Jeff was glancing at himself he shot up several more inches, well beyond his natural height to 6&#39;8 and towered nearly a foot over the other guys. It was at this point Jeff wanted to stop this and said as much. &quot;I&#39;m flattered, but don&#39;t really want to be your giant, guys. I&#39;d be more than happy if you just gave my device back and didn&#39;t beat me up anymore. I can change myself back, its alright.&quot; Jeff&#39;s voice was foreign in his own ears, being such a big guy he was now a low baritone instead of the tenor he used to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Jeff, we&#39;re just getting to the good parts.&quot; Jeff began stacking on muscle like it was a multi-year timelapse of a body builder. Given his height it took time before he actually began to look muscular, and he didn&#39;t stop until he was big.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Christ, are you wanting to use me as your body guard? Dear God!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you could be!&quot; Todd laughed in astonishment, Todd glanced at the Chronivac, &quot;You&#39;re 285 lbs big guy, yikes! One last super power. There.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff felt the tingle but noticed no changes when he bent over to look in the mirror. &quot;What is it? I don&#39;t see anything.&quot; For the first time Jeff actually felt capable of sticking up for himself and now his curiosity was outweighing his immediate fear. Furthermore, Todd did seem to be treating him in a way that seemed to be Todd&#39;s version of nice, though, transparency with the plan and asking for consent would have been nicer.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s cuz it won&#39;t work on guy&#39;s, I see you&#39;re into the ladies, and I just made it so that any girl you talk to will be interested. Now, if somethings stopping her, like she has an exclusive relationship, a family, an important meeting to run to or something like that, she can still say no despite being interested. I don&#39;t want you bringing undue chaos on us... And you&#39;ll instinctively know just what to do to make her happy. Added bonus, zero attraction to anyone under 18. How&#39;s that for an amazing perk?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff, having only ever been too young, only heard about guys doing things like this together. &quot;Oh, so you want all the girls to flock to me, so you can take your pick of your preference, and I&#39;ll take care of the others for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd grinned, &quot;That&#39;s an enticing proposition, but for now, I just want you to be my cock. You&#39;ll be long, girthy, powerful, make all the right moves, and draw the girls in... but you&#39;ll be a dead fish if they are jailbait. You&#39;re perfect, and like I said, this is me doing you a favor, you&#39;ll get way more pussy as my cock then you ever would have as the dweeb of a human you were.&quot; Karl smiled now seeing Todd&#39;s genius.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jeff couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing... it didn&#39;t make sense... Todd was being nice, he wanted Jeff to join them.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s arms went limp pulling closer to his body than his muscular frame would naturally allow... it was now or never! He was almost 300 lbs of muscle! He could do SOMEthing! Break the device to stop the transformation, then get help from the distributor. It&#39;s a plan at least! Jeff charged at Todd, but somehow his legs seized and he managed to trip, spin around, and land hard in a kneeling position, sitting on top of his crossed legs. He could feel his legs not wanting to work any more. Without arms or legs, all he could possibly do was thrust backwards and bash the device with his head.<br />
<br />
He tried. His head was easily caught by Todd and gently pushed back upright. His core losing strength as its tissue changed from muscle into engorged tissue. Even kneeling, Jeff came up to Todd&#39;s chest. &quot;Oh wow Jeff, can you feel it? Being transformed feels so amazing!&quot; Todd cooed. It did, but Jeff didn&#39;t want to give Todd the satisfaction of being right.<br />
<br />
Todd&#39;s hand was still on Jeff&#39;s head and Todd began massaging it, it was awkward for Jeff but not bad, but judging from Todd&#39;s moan it was erotic for him. Todd giggled a second later, and a second after that Jeff saw his hands covered in clumps of Jeff&#39;s hair, &quot;Baldness hits many unfairly, and at 18 it&#39;s truly a tragedy, but in your case,&quot; Todd rubbed vigorously and Jeff watched in horror as all his hair fell out in clumps, &quot;I really think it suits you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff could no longer move his head, torso, or even change his positioning over his legs. His legs felt like hot jelly. Todd grew more enamored with the transformation and began rubbing Jeff&#39;s body. &quot;This is weird for me Jeff but you&#39;re my penis so I guess we&#39;ll need to get past it, no time like the present.&quot; Todd stood behind Jeff rubbing his chest and face, Jeff could feel the eroticism building up in his whole body and he shuddered spasming backwards into Todd involuntarily. His mouth would open and his legs would tighten. <br />
<br />
Each time a spasm occurred Jeff&#39;s head tilted back and didnt quite return to looking forward, he only noticed as he saw the underside of Todd&#39;s jaw and the ceiling. Jeff barely heard the one minute warning bell sound, and until Todd Picked him up Jeff didn&#39;t realize he had shrunk. Jeff was very much like a living dildo at this stage and Todd had become penis-less throughout the process. Todd entered the stall, now feeling everything jeff felt as though they were attached. Todd slid his pants down and pressed Jeff&#39;s lower back and feet against his skin to support the continued stroking motion he was making... Jeff didn&#39;t even notice as he was connected and as the transformation completed they both felt their most powerful ejaculation to date. &quot;Oh Jeff, we&#39;re going to have some fun.&quot;</p>
