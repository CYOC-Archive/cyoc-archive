<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You scream for help and attempting desperately to understand what&#39;s going on. You were knocked out by some sort of gas and suddenly you&#39;re here, attached to a table for a purpose you cannot fathom. So you vent your anger and outrage to hide your incredible fright at what is going to happen to you.<br />
<br />
At long last, a light turns on, just above you. You can see that you are indeed strapped onto a table. The restraints are leather straps so they&#39;s no hope breaking them. You do try, though.<br />
&quot;Still trying to resolve your issues by force, I see,&quot; says a voice in front of you.<br />
A man in a sort of green bathrobe, quite ridiculous, really, steps under the light. The bathrobe is embroidered with stars. How cliche can you get, really? You scoff. However, that young man&#39;s face, about your age, does look vaguely familiar.<br />
&quot;Who are you? What do you want from me? This is illegal! Are you high? A pothead? A junkie?&quot;<br />
The other man laughs. <br />
&quot;Still denigrating people in a flash, I see,&quot; smirks the man. &quot;Don&#39;t you remember me, Christian?&quot;  <br />
&quot;A dork like you? No! Or rather, I would if had seen you one day! You really are a circus freak!&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s me, David. The boy in junior high that you and your three vapid friends bullied all day long, every day? Rings any bells?&quot;<br />
You frown. Yes. It&#39;s him. David. The moron with glasses and a lisp that you and your three bullies loved to make miserable at school, before he moved and you guys had to find another main victim. Not that it was hard. After all, any school reeks of losers and dweebs that are easy to target. It makes the day fun when everything else at school us boring and these kids are idiots anyway. If they were the least bit intelligent, they would dress with proper clothes, stop liking stupid kid stuff and do sports or do surgery to be less ugly. Not to mention that their parents were often poor and too stupid themselves to afford any better jobs. If their kids were losers, it was their mistake, not yours. So why should you apologise to David at all? <br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; you smirk. &quot;And you became an even bigger dork than before. Congrats. I didn’t believe it was actually possible.&quot;<br />
&quot;You haven&#39;t changed at all,I see,&quot; calmly says David. &quot;On the cusp of going off to college and still being a bullying jerk. But I&#39;m going to change that.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
Suddenly you&#39;re a bit scared. Does this idiot have a knife or a weapon under his bathrobe? Is he planning to shoot you or torture you? Are you going to end your life as the victim of a mental sicko turned ridiculous wannabe villain vigilante?  <br />
&quot;I am going to punish you like you deserve. You and your pathetic friends. And I&#39;ll spare others your bullying and nastiness at the same time. you see, as I could not reintegrate other schools thanks to your bullying having affected by relationship to other students, I was got homeschooled and rummaging through libraries I came across books of magic. The real deal. I found a teacher in the occult arts and now I travel in this circus and perform tricks. These people are my real family, as well as a haven for the unusual and the supernatural. When I saw we were coming here, I could not resist the temptation to take my revenge.&quot;<br />
You laugh. What a ridiculous story!<br />
&quot;Ha! You expect me to believe that? Seriously? Magic powers, right! You&#39;ll just end up in jail and be fucked by other guys once my parents and the police know you&#39;ve kidnapped me!&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be so sure. Your friends will receive the same treatment as you and after I\&#39;m done with you, neither your parents nor anyone else will recognize you. But I see a demonstration is in order.&quot;<br />
You are ready to laugh again but you see a ball of white light that starts vibrating and emanate in David&#39;s palm. How the fuck is that possible? What special effects are those? David then throws the ball of light that goes straight at your head. Then all becomes dark again as you scream.<br />
<br />
You wake to a voice of a microphone and bright lights. You want to. groan but nothing comes out of your mouth. You see smiling people in front of you and you call out to them but nothing happens. You can move but not talk. Around you music plays. You see you are on a stage and you try to get down but your foot is held by something. A rope! A tiny rope restrains you foot. It allows you to move back and forth across the stage but no more. Well, no matter. It can be untied. That&#39;s when you notice your hands. Those aren&#39;t hands! They vagule resemble hands! There&#39;s a crude bump where the thumb should be, and the rest is fused together with little bumps, tiny ones, to vaguely mimic fingers. And it&#39;s... It&#39;s fabric! You&#39;re encased in fabric! Help! You want to scream for help but youyr mouth looks sown shut. You try to pat it and you come to the realization that it really is! There&#39;s only a smile of stitches where it should be, a triangular nose and only your eyes looks more solid. You look around you and see on your right three ragdolls dressed on frilly, pouffy old-fashioned baby clothes, all in deferent shades of pink. There was a very noticeable white bulge under the tiny dresses, because of a huge diaper showing a cartoon animal at the rear. And you&#39;re dressed no different so... A ragdoll! A baby doll! You&#39;re a ridiculous doll! And from the synthetic curls poking out of the bonnet of the other three tied dolls, you see their shades match those of your friends. Wait! Hadn&#39;t David said he was going to punish them as well? That jerky really had powers. You&#39;re all tiny living moving dolls! Except you can&#39;t talk! Can&#39;;t shout for help! What is going to...?<br />
&quot;Welcome, ladies and gentlemen!&quot; shouts the voice in microphone. &quot;Welcome to the shooting attraction! Use you guns to target are puppets here! Have fun! Let&#39;s hope Googoo, Gaga, Froufrou and Twinkle Toes give you quite the challenge!&quot;<br />
Everyone laughed and before what awaited him really sunk in, all in the teenage or young audience took out beebee guns and happily shot at what they thought were really well animated ridiculous puppet dolls. They laughed heartily at their names and mocked ruthlessly their appearances. The cartoon animals on the back of their diapered hinnies provided very tempting targets and the four dolls moved about the stage, desperately trying to cover their behinds but exposing the rest of their bodies. They could not scream but did those plastic beads sting! And all the while everyone guffawed and had plenty of fun. The boys especially were vicious, calling out their names and ordering them to came back and be shot at, all the while congratulating the super special effects. It was pure torture and humiliation  for Christian, Cole, Sean and Connor and it lasted a long time. <br />
<br />
When the time was finally over and the curtain draped over the scene, the four dolls, formerly awful bullies, were exhausted and in pain and very unhappy. Alas, it was only the beginning.  You see David approach you with a wide smile and speak out a spell. Immediately, you lose the ability to move, becoming even more as doll except for the slight twitches at times. David picks up by an arm, two in each hand, all of you and congratulates you all for providing such a stellar attraction. It was a big success! Everyone had fun and paid well. <br />
&quot;But the evening is still young and you have another task. Which I&#39;m sure you shall all perform superbly,&quot; David says with a wicked smile and evil glint in his eyes.     <br />
So each of them were attached by the middle amidst the prizes to be won at the shooting games. Not to be actually won and offered to a little girl, as David made clear, but to provide a target for those who hadn&#39;t won anything. So it was another round of being shot at with beebee guns while being incapable to do anything about it, not even move more than feeble twitches that went completely unnoticed. They were the targets of many jeers too, of course.<br />
<br />
At one thirty in the morning, when the carnival finally shot down for the night, the four dolls were picked up by David who took him back to his trailer. The thing was magical, unsurprisingly, and inside was the size of a good-sized apartment. All the other carnies thanked him for his excellent and very profitable idea, while pinching the cheeks of the former bullies, tickling their chins and patting their bonneted heads or diapered behinds. David had restored their abilities in movement so they struggled and swatted the big hands away but with only soft stuffing as muscles, they could not hurt David or the other carnies in any way. David laughed, saying the &quot;little angelic pink babies&quot; needed to go to bed as it was way past their bedtime. Once inside, David went towards the four bright pink plastic doll cribs he had prepared and placed the four bullies there. <br />
You were fuming. You were hurt, humiliated to the last degree and that warlock jerk David was continuing. Again he made you near immobile and  tucked you in in the soft white blankets, adding a little plush clown for each of you alongside a rattle. It was all fuzzy and frilly, the exact of have you felt inside. That prick even added a good night kiss upon your bonnet and wished you sweet dreams. But of course it wasn&#39;t totally over yet. That loser made sure to smash your only hope, that you missing would prompt a search, leading to David being arrested and them freed.<br />
&quot;Let me tell you a story before you go beddy-bies,&quot; he said snidely. &quot;Once upon a time, four mean little boys angered a wizard because they did not know how to be nice. So the wizard cast a spell on them and they turned into the most adorable little girls, bringing much joy sand laughter around them. The wizard was very happy because he knew the four boys would not be missed. Not much, at any rate. For he had magically generated illusions of the four boys, like clones. Temporary clones, which went back to their homes as if nothing had happened. The illusions would last for a few days, and then leave a message saying they had gone far away, much further than wherever the wizard might be. And that wasn&#39;t all. The replicas would make sure to steal from their parents, be openly cruel to children and be the cruel little bullies everyone knew they were or were too ignorant to notice. Like that, no one would miss them much, not even their parents. The end.&quot;<br />
He grinned at all of you and if you could have have shouted, you would have. No one would come looking for you! No one! You were trapped as that awful prick&#39;s doll, doomed to perform for other assholes every night like freaks! While being tortured and mock and receiving nothing in return, except contempt and insults! David went away, leaving you to sleep your first night as little girly dolls. <br />
<br />
David ,made himself a cup of coffee. Things had turned out even better than he could have ever hoped! Now, he could toy with what to do with his captive bullies and what fate to send them to for good. He could keep them that way, sure. Or sentence them to something even more twisted. Or be lenient because they had suffered enough. The choice was his and it was delicious, each possibility sweeter than the other.</p>
