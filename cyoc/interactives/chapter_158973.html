<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Next to step up in the tent was an older man, visibly broad shouldered even with his age in account. He was balding and white haired, with a tightly trimmed salt and pepper beard kept short to his jawline, he had light blue eyes and wore a button up shirt, dress pants, and a light coat on top. Going by the rolex on his wrist, he was a man of means. He had seen what had become of Pierce and Andy, and had no inclination of having that occur to him next. &quot;Excuse me, Miss Illusia, but I would like to ask for another age transfer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Illusia and her assistant Steven turned to regard the new person to be transformed - and Illusia took in his learned, possibly Ivy League, demeanor and how stoic and bold he was, stepping forward when he had just witnessed how wrong an age transfer could go. Specifically for the regressing party.<br />
<br />
Illusia asked him, &quot;Identify yourself, sir. Tell me about what brought you to request such a change...&quot;<br />
<br />
The 60 year old man nodded, &quot;I&#39;m George Everett, I&#39;m 60 years old as of last Tuesday...&quot; He paused and smiled as some people in the audience shouted Happy Birthday to him, and then he continued when the shouting died down, &quot;And I have grown somewhat nostalgic for the strength of my youth. I&#39;ve wanted to return to my younger, more vibrant years for some time now, but lacked the means for it. Seeing the display of power here, I feel confident in coming forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well spoken,&quot; Madame Illusia stated, rather impressed, &quot;Then as before, we must have a balance, is there anyone here willing to take George&#39;s age unto themselves such that he will be able to return to his youth as he desires?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a brief pause in the crowd as people seemed to contemplate what that meant. That pending on how far George went back, they&#39;d be leaving here 30...40 years older possibly. There was no way he was just going to request 10 or 20 years to be washed off of his form. He was here to become young hale and truly healthy again.<br />
<br />
However before long someone did come forward, a rather bushy haired looking skater wearing a cap on his head, baggy clothes, and obviously pretty thin, though remarkably well toned - if this young man put on size, he would be well capable of switching from a skill intensive sport like skateboarding to something more based on appearance. The young man had light blond hair, green eyes, and in terms of facial features, he was growing into a somewhat handsome look.<br />
<br />
Illusia asked him, &quot;So you would bear these burdens from George? Who are you, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
The young skater answered, &quot;I&#39;m AJ, I&#39;m 13, and you might see me around the skate park, but I&#39;ve always wanted to try and see where I end up later in life. It&#39;s kind of been a curiosity and a fixation of mine. Hopefully, getting the age off&#39;a you, George, will satisfy my yearning.&quot;<br />
<br />
George saw that AJ was pretty excited, and maybe he got this idea from seeing what had become of Andy - thus, another young man eager to age for more than one reason. He&#39;d never understand that rush personally, but here he was wanting to radically change his own age, so he was in no place to call foul at all.<br />
<br />
Illusia stepped forward and stated, &quot;Very well, George, AJ, I will commence the age transfer. However much age you desire removed from yourself, George, you only need say Stop for this to halt. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Knowing that he&#39;d put his fate in George&#39;s hands, AJ looked at him. The older man crossed his arms and then nodded. He had no intention of ending up as consumed by the changes as the last couple patrons were. He stated, &quot;That I do. I look forward to returning to my stronger years.&quot;<br />
<br />
AJ wanted to comment on how even in his 60s it was obvious that George was still a pretty strong guy, but he was rendered quiet as Illusia started the age transfer with a grand gesture;<br />
<br />
George felt a rush of heat through him as he supposed the regression began, groaning as he felt his body starting its downward trek. He felt the aches and pains that came with trying to remain fit with age departing as his beard and head hair started to regain a ruddy, dark coloration. His muscles were repairing from the rigors of age, and he chuckled as he felt his shoulders and arms in particular strengthening and repairing from damages incited about 5 years ago. He was fast returning to 50, and he looked over at AJ to see what was becoming of him.<br />
<br />
AJ was on cloud nine. It was like getting a blowjob from his girlfriend, aging and muscling up like this. Indeed as AJ had aged the body that had just been tone and wiry muscle filled out very well indeed, his face filling in and becoming tighter, more angular, his bushy hair styling itself into a crewcut in real time. He moaned and blatantly cupped his groin, trying to get a feel for how his manhood was growing. He estimated he was growing into his 20s, and that only made him pump his hips into his hand, feeling how strong and generously sized his glutes were by slapping himself there.<br />
<br />
George supposed that it was natural for AJ to react as he was, and George continued the transfer even as he saw AJ&#39;s displays become more vain and obviously sexual - AJ at 23 was downright reminiscent of George&#39;s old college dormmates, so eager to drink and fuck and preen.  George however was now starting to know how it felt as his hair started to fill back in more with its old ruddy color, his eyes sharpening in focus and his body starting to tighten. He knew he was heading to 40, and returning to a more sexually capable period in his life, albeit toward the end of that.<br />
<br />
George gasped and managed to keep his hand at his side, deciding against acting on the flush of arousal that spread through his body as he regressed. Heading down through toward 40 was a wild ride, and he took out his phone and checked the reflection in the black surface to see the wrinkles, crows feet, laugh lines and such that creased his face were on the decline - though not nearly enough. &quot;So this...is how it felt. Damn...gotta keep control of myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
He watched AJ having vastly less luck on the controlling himself portion of that; by now the baggy clothes AJ had been wearing were the opposite - far too fucking tight, and so AJ discarded them, standing there in marvelous, statuesque shape. His blond hair styled back and his body hair buzzed off. AJ flexed and pistoned his hips into the air. He was a young man feeling the heat of arousal now, far removed from the teen he had been. &quot;Fuck, Fuck! I feel so good! Gimme more!&quot;<br />
<br />
And more he received, almost making AJ strip naked then and there if not for George giving him a look that said &#39;Don&#39;t you do it.&#39;<br />
<br />
AJ would see his body continue to grow and develop, size and tone alternatively developing one after the other, and AJ the whole time loved every minute of his accelerated development. He saw his body lose its abs one minute in a huge bulking phase, and then get them back and then some the next moment. AJ was aging well, even as he rested at 33, he was devastatingly handsome and well formed, no real signs of age present on him much at all except maybe some light weathering of his skin.<br />
<br />
Considering his options going forward, George still did not say Stop, and so the transfer continued.<br />
<br />
George if he had thought the regression to 40 would be the limit to how intense it would feel was desperately mistaken, because as he started regressing to 30, he was astonished by the sheer difference. It was like fire filling his belly, and speaking of which, as he regressed, the solid stocky belly he had started to chisel and tone, and before long George discarded his shirt, showing a set of abs growing tighter and stronger with time.<br />
<br />
His pectorals, formerly untoned, slouching and rather like moobs, firmed and toned up into proper, muscular pectorals, leaving George desperately trying to keep his hands off of his own groin. He felt his shoulders and correspondingly his arms and forearms strengthening, his shoulders pushing out more and growing more like boulders in their consistency, simply touching them made him gasp and feel himself with wide eyes, though he still kept his hands off his groin. George was feeling hot, young, strong again!<br />
<br />
George felt his dress pants suddenly get so much tighter, and he realized in his younger years he was something of a legs man. He would have preferred to keep his pants on, but the sheer ache down there as his quads and hamstrings, even his calves, grew in...it made his decision easier. He pried off his pants and stood there, an increasingly masculine, muscular bastion of strength sticking out of a pair of socks. He breathed, and said, &quot;I-I can&#39;t believe how good this feels...&quot;<br />
<br />
AJ was far from regretful about progressing right into his forties;<br />
<br />
He was still feeling amazingly good, and he&#39;d settled into flexing his muscles for the crowd. Even as he progressed through his thirties, he never lost track of his fitness. AJ guessed he was just gonna grow naturally into being a fit &quot;Dad&quot; type. Still, even as AJ tried to grope at his hard cock, still outlining his boxers, he looked at George and saw...it looked like George was struggling with this too. AJ wondered if George would be good with them just rubbing one out.<br />
<br />
AJ&#39;s hairline slightly declined, certainly, and his face was left slightly less overtly handsome from slight wrinkles and lines, but he was left looking distinguished rather than withered. He looked more handsome for it overall than less, and as he ran a hand through his hair, AJ was pleased to see he wasn&#39;t dealing with baldness - chalk that up to good genes in his family. And if anything, AJ&#39;s muscles grew slightly larger still as he progressed into his forties. He was honestly looking forward to really trying to sexually enjoy himself at this age or whatever came next...<br />
<br />
George meanwhile looked down at his body, and all that came of this, and thought about what to do next. He looked at himself and then over at the preening, flexing AJ and...</p>
