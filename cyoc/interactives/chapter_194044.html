<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The corridor seemed endless. It all looked the same in the dim lights of the pipes below. The once overwhelming silence of the bunch had steadily evolved into a collection of casual chatter. Danny could overhear Zach’s deep voice mumbling behind him, as he talked to rugby-mates Cody and Tyler. <br />
<em>He must be whispering about me. Me and my ridiculous appendage.</em> Danny thought bitterly to himself.<br />
Mr Blake was whispering with a few of the Computing students, who were trying to reassure him about his lost glasses. Unlike Chris, he looked rather panic-stricken.<br />
<br />
“Wait. Here’s something.”<br />
<br />
Chris immediately stopped and Danny almost bumped into him. “ROOM 22” was neatly painted along the wall. Chris knocked, and the hollow sound echoed along the corridor. He smiled widely.<br />
<br />
“Zach, get over here.”<br />
<br />
The rugby player stretched his arms in preparation and walked to the front of the group, past Danny, who was trying to resist the urge to ogle. Zach joined Chris and, rolling up his sleeves as far as the tight fabric would allow him, spread his palms on the wall. With a loud grunt, he pushed against it with great strength. Danny watched his biceps bulge and flex. Zach pushed his hips in, and his perfectly round butt on top of his wide thighs tensed. Without breaking a sweat the wall gave way and landed with a loud thud. Zach, exhaling, brushed off his hands.<br />
<br />
“Cheers Zach,” Chris confidently patted him on the shoulder and the pair shared a smile before he joined his rugby-mates, who all mumbled compliments to him. Danny was tempted to compliment him too, but was far too embarrassed to even look at him. Chris peeked through the gap in the wall.<br />
<br />
“I think I can see a way out. All of you! Follow my lead and stay close to the walls.”<br />
<br />
He whispered loudly, stepping beyond their sight; into the unknown space. Danny followed suit, and so did the rest.<br />
<br />
The room was empty. It was just like the one Danny found himself and Kieran in, only a blinding white light wasn’t coming out of the floor. Instead, it was an ominous glow, as if the room wasn’t being used. It was bigger too; around the size of a basketball court. On the opposite end to them was a what appeared to be an open door, which they all saw as their way out.<br />
<br />
Their footsteps were as quiet as possible. They all clung to the wall, following Chris almost like a conga line. Mr Blake clung on especially tight, squinting his eyes as he hoped to see ahead of him. Danny felt a shiver down his spine.<br />
<br />
“I feel like someone’s watching us.”<br />
“That’s reassuring.”<br />
<br />
Chris remarked as he inched slowly towards the door. Danny was too scared to admire Chris’ ass in that jumpsuit of his. He had certainly changed a lot. The eerie silence caused Danny’s heart to beat loudly in his ears. He felt his knees tremble with fear.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, they all jumped as a small but bright spotlight flickered on the very centre of the space. A neatly displayed pair of glasses on a white pedestal shone in the light. Mr Blake’s eyes widened.<br />
<br />
“My glasses!? Yes! I can finally see!”<br />
<br />
He whispered loudly as he let go of the wall and quickly shuffled towards the pedestal, despite the students reaching for him and trying to stop him. Their voices were silent, but panicky. Danny’s breathing became quick, and shallow. He felt his heart drop as Mr Blake reached for the glasses and picked them up.<br />
<br />
“No! Sir, it’s a trap—“<br />
<br />
Just then, the bright white light of the floor<br />
switched on, almost blinding the group in the process. The hole in the wall was blocked off by thick metal shutters and the door slammed shut. They could hear something else, something heavy, fall and crash to the ground. As their eyes re-adjusted, they realised what happened.<br />
 <br />
Mr Blake was trapped in a large glass dome, with pipes attached to it leading to the ceiling. He was desperately pounding at the glass, crying out for help.<br />
<br />
Chris and Zach ran towards the dome without hesitation. They tried to lift it, but to no avail. It was as if it had welded itself into the floor.<br />
<br />
Just then, a soft male voice boomed throughout the room.<br />
<br />
“You’re all so gullible! I’ve been watching you. All of you. We do not tolerate cheaters here. You have all escaped your games, and therefore must be punished. Commence stage one of the punishment.”<br />
<br />
A white gas began pouring in through the pipes, slowly shrouding Mr Blake from view. The students could hear him scream in fear. They watched on helplessly, mouths agape in shock and despair. Chris pounded on the glass. Zach was trying to break the dome by kicking it, but not even a crack appeared on the surface. Mr Blake’s screams eventually subsided, as if he was falling asleep. The raspiness of his shrieks had stopped too. After a few long moments, the gas traveled back up the pipes, revealing an unconscious Mr Blake on the floor. Then, like an electric shock, he jolted awake and jumped to his feet, looking around with a confused expression.<br />
<br />
“Help me!”<br />
“Holy crap…” Chris said aloud. <br />
<br />
Danny couldn’t believe it either. Even Zach stared at the teacher in disbelief, and Mr Blake only looked more confused.<br />
<br />
“What? What is it?!”<br />
<br />
His voice sounded deeper. A large mirror rose up from the ground, stopping at Mr Blake’s eye level, which was higher than it was before. He stared in shock at his reflection. His once chubby face now had no wrinkles at all, and instead had strong cheekbones and a sharp jawline, devoid of stubble. He ran his younger looking hands along his smooth skin, and down his neck, which was now sporting a very prominent Adam’s apple. He felt his jumpsuit feeling a lot looser. His round belly had gone. Utterly astounded, he slowly unzipped his jumpsuit. Two meaty pecs greeted him as, along with a defined set of washboard abs. He ran his fingers along each one. Perfectly sculpted and hairless. He let out a quiet laugh.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit.” <br />
<br />
He said to himself. He no longer looked like Mr Blake. He looked more like a fitness model, or gymnast. His attention quickly went to the biceps that pulsed out of his arms. The students watched on as he admired his new, younger body.<br />
<br />
“Look at me! I look amazing, and my voice!”<br />
<br />
He massaged his Adam’s apple and let out a much louder laugh. Danny was in awe at the man’s transformation, feeling his foot-long cock harden slightly. He noticed other students gazing at Mr Blake’s new muscles. Chris looked more worried, pounding again on the glass.<br />
<br />
“Sir, don’t panic! We’re gonna get you out of here!”<br />
“Look at THESE bad boys!”<br />
<br />
Mr Blake wasn’t even listening. He was having too much fun with his physique, as he stripped his torso and arms completely of the jumpsuit and did a double bicep pose in the mirror. He exhaled, surprised as the sheer size of them, and the veins that pulsed with power. He grinned. The voice had returned.<br />
<br />
“Mr Blake now possesses the body he has always dreamt of. It is only fitting that he experiences the perks that come with it. Commence stage two.”<br />
<br />
Mr Blake was trying to get a good view of his ripped back before he felt something come alive in his jumpsuit. He cupped his crotch and felt his cock harden. A small jolt of pleasure zipped through his body. The unstoppable virility of his now 20 year-old body was finally catching up to him. It was as if years of pent up sexual desires had broken through like a river to the floodgates. He panted as he felt his mind fill with lust. He stroked his manhood as it grew, slithering further down his leg. He tried to conceal it from the others at first. Danny couldn’t help but stare at the teacher’s obvious bulge. His own member was semi hard and pressing against his jumpsuit.<br />
<br />
“Fuck…so horny! Ugh!”<br />
<br />
Mr Blake whispered to himself as he felt his cock throb; fully hard at 8 inches. He was so turned on that precum was already leaking out. The urge to jerk off was becoming impossible to resist. He took one more look at his shredded torso in the mirror and grinned again.<br />
<br />
“Fuck it.”<br />
<br />
He hurriedly whipped out his member and pumped it desperately. Each stroke was orgasmic to him. He moaned loudly, the sheer pleasure making his legs weak as he collapsed to his knees. A spurt of precum shot out and splattered the ground in front of him. He was out of control.<br />
<br />
“Oh God this feels so good! I need uh…someone to suck it. Yeah, just a nice, wet, mouth.”<br />
<br />
Mr Blake muttered to himself as watched his reflection in the mirror, too enamoured by the sight to focus on anything else. Chris had already looked away, taking a second to clear his mind and think. The room was filled with the sounds of Mr Blake’s deep, slow moans. Danny watched the Computing students reach in their own jumpsuits and begin masturbating themselves. Chris tapped Zach on the pec and said something to him. They both dashed towards the shut door.<br />
<br />
“It’s too late for him! Everyone join me over there and we’re find a way out before—“<br />
“COMMENCE STAGE THREE.”<br />
<br />
The male voice was loud, and menacing, as if he was enjoying the situation greatly. Chris and Zach stopped in his tracks to look at Mr Blake, who was now writhing about on the floor in ecstasy. He was thrusting his cock into his hands, which were soaking wet from his seed. They watched it steadily grow in his grip, and his balls slowly swell. His torso began packing on more muscle as his arms and thighs thickened. His legs grew longer, stretching the man to an even greater height than he already was. The realisation hit them.<br />
<br />
Me Blake was growing.<br />
<br />
His moans of lust had turned into growls, and then roars. His voice became deeper by the second until it was almost unrecognisable. By the time he surpassed the 7ft mark, his cock was over two feet long, and thicker than the wrists of the students who continued to watch in both horror and jealousy. Hairs began sprouting all across his body, including his jaw. The pure testosterone that was overloading his body was turning him into a hulking beast of a man, which only spurred on his primal urges.<br />
<br />
“Must…fuck…need…FUCK!”<br />
<br />
He boomed. He was too lost in his ocean of hormones and desires to speak properly. He rose to his feet; towering over everyone at 8ft. Gone was the portly Maths teacher. His cock was still rock hard, pointing straight at the students. His breaths were so heavy his pecs moved up and down with each one. He looked at each boy in the eye. They knew what he wanted. The male voice returned.<br />
<br />
“This is my favourite bit. Enjoy your punishment, all of you. COMMENCE THE FINAL STAGE!”<br />
<br />
And just like that, the dome lifted effortlessly back into the ceiling, and all hell broke loose.</p>
