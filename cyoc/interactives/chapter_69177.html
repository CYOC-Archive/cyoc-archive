<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A flurry of stars had covered the night sky, the moon full and bright. This combined with the mild evening air <br />
gave Daniel a sense of electricity in the air.<br />
<br />
In the space of a single day, Daniel had transformed himself from a small, scrawny and socially awkward <br />
freshmen with a fondness for statistics and muscle magazines to the master of a universe of his own creation. <br />
In that time he had achieved the body he had always wanted but genetics would never give him, he had become <br />
the object of unparalleled desire with swaths of musclebear gods fighting (of what used to be impossible body <br />
dimensions) for his own attention. To top it all off he had gone on a date with the ginger titan of his <br />
dreams, who was still growing with every passing moment.<br />
<br />
There were a few things proving a little unnerving to Dan. Dan had the power of the Chronovac, a piece of <br />
software loaded onto his notebook computer and a USB emitter. There was so much he didn't understand about the <br />
forces he was using. Will every change he makes come back to him with ironic consequences? Is there anyone <br />
else in this world who also owns a Chronovac? Is he a pawn in someone else's plan? Is this even reality or is <br />
it a fabrication?<br />
<br />
Dan thought about his last change to make all gingers alphas and submissives. Not only had it augmented the <br />
present (much to Dan's delight) but every change had a ripple-on effect to maintain continuity.  Dan knew more <br />
than a few things about computers,  but it didn't take a genius to realise that the computing power required <br />
to perform such acts he's done today far exceeded the limitations of his notebook. <br />
<br />
It suddenly dawned on Dan. The emitter! What if it never affected changes at all? What if all his computer did <br />
was provide an interface to a much more powerful computer located somewhere else? But where? Who possesses <br />
such technology? Why him of all people?<br />
<br />
He thought of a book he read describing Clarke's third law: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is <br />
indistinguishable from magic.”. Dan chuckled to himself, this all seemed pretty magical to him.<br />
<br />
Dan pushed all these thoughts to the back of his mind for the time being. Dan had much bigger things to worry <br />
about as he looked up and down Patrick – who was starting to sweat, his chest heaving as he breathed heavily <br />
through his nose.  A cocktail of hormones were surging through him. His body ached as it continued to grow <br />
larger. However, Dan was a more interested in Patrick's mind – every passing moment driving him deeper and <br />
deeper into his submissive destiny, all this in conflict with the animalistic urges brought on by the hormones <br />
flowing through him. To his credit, Patrick did his best to appear strong and composed.<br />
<br />
Patrick looked down to Dan “Tonight is going to be a big night for me. Will you be there for me. I mean, to <br />
bind me?”. Dan not fully understanding what he had been asked but nodded in support anyway. Dan took Patrick <br />
by the hand they walked up the pathway to Marcus' house.<br />
<br />
Patrick knocked on the knocker of the heavy oak doors. The sound reverberating deep and loud. Dan heard heavy <br />
footsteps approach the door. A small cover opened on the other side of the door, letting two eyes see their <br />
new guests. The eyes grew wide in a moment in recognition of their guest. The door burst open, revealing a man <br />
who was unquestionably Patrick's brother – same vibrant red beard braided in the same pattern, same muscular <br />
build, same pattern on his kilt (also abysmally failing to conceal the massive cock and balls handing down his <br />
inner seam). The only other thing Marcus was wearing was massive chain around his neck and a lock engraved <br />
with markings Dan couldn't quite recognise. <br />
<br />
Marcus looked to be in shocked and surprised at the sight of person before him. “Fuck Brother. Thank Gods <br />
you're here.  You should have got here a lot sooner” he cried out in a half-celebratory half-accusing tone.<br />
<br />
“It all happened so soon. I didn't have a chance. This is Dan”<br />
<br />
Marcus looked down at Dan, appearing to be immune to his spell of desire. Marcus smiled in recognition of Dan<br />
<br />
“Looks like the youngest brother's time has come! We need to get the preparations started for your binding <br />
right away. There is no time to lose!”<br />
<br />
He pulled Patrick in through the door,  having to turn Patrick sideways to get in through the doorway, his <br />
cock and balls by now dragging behind him on the tile floor a foot behind him. Dan followed through the door.<br />
<br />
Inside the door Dan saw something like he had never seen before. Inside the house were at at least eight other <br />
gingers, all sharing the same beard braid and style of kilt. Some of them tattooed with what Dan presumed to <br />
be clan patterns and insignia. All except Patrick had the similar heavy locks around their necks. <br />
Unquestionably they were were all related in some way, but it was more than just blood: it was a common <br />
culture, a common identity, a common pride and power drawn from their slave roles. This can't be real' thought <br />
Dan 'it's all too perfect'.<br />
<br />
Another bear appears from the top of the stairwell, he has long bone white hair braided in the clan tradition. <br />
He has lines on his face that indicate years of wisdom and experience. He's physically the largest of the <br />
clan, and  covered from chest to knees in a Celtic cross pattern tattoo – emphasising his curves. Most <br />
remarkable were his massive shoulders and back. He was truly an alpha among daddy bears.<br />
<br />
Without warning, Patrick doubles over, clutching his dissented muscle gut.. The house shaking as he hits the <br />
ground.<br />
<br />
“Daddy Heathcliff!” brother Marcus cries out.<br />
<br />
The daddy bear quickly makes his way to Patrick's side, inspecting his condition.<br />
<br />
“Get brother Patrick into the chamber immediately. He's running out of time. NOW!”. He barked at his sons. <br />
Without a moments hesitation, the brothers crowd around Patrick, each lifting a portion of him and taking him <br />
down to a room down the hall.<br />
<br />
Daddy Heathcliff had a nervous look on his face. He turned to address Dan.<br />
<br />
“The name's 'Cliff. I am the head of this chapter. What happened?”<br />
<br />
He extended his big meaty paw in greeting to Dan. Dan took his hand to shake it, only to wince under the vice-<br />
grip pressure of his hand.<br />
<br />
“I'm Dan”. He felt nervous talking in-front of this man, had a confident and confronting manner. Sure he was <br />
submissive, but he had earned pride and rank in his position. “He competed in a competition and won a date <br />
with me as a prize. After dinner he said he had to come here to pick up a book.<br />
<br />
“When did the changes start?”<br />
<br />
“I guess it would have been during the competition. He wanted to win me so badly he grew to first place”. Dan <br />
deliberately omitted the Chronovac, but he was interested in seeing how the world maintained continuity to <br />
accommodate changes.<br />
<br />
“You've set off a chain reaction in Patrick. He's bound to you now and there's nothing he can do about it. If <br />
you care about Patrick you will go into that chamber and take place in the binding ceremony”<br />
<br />
“I heard Patrick tell me he needed one, but he never told me what it was exactly.”<br />
<br />
“The binding ceremony is an intra-psychic journey for both the Master and the slave-applicant. The purpose of <br />
the binding ceremony is to provide focus. Inside every member of our clan beats a heart with the power and <br />
intensity of a beast – what the Master must do is to tame that energy and mold it. It is to wed the power he <br />
has with the craving to serve. You must get him to experience the joy and power of serving his Master. You <br />
must make serving you all he wants. He needs to give himself completely and you need to take him completely. <br />
The ceremony is consummated by the Master locking his new slave with a lock and chain and giving him a new <br />
name. Both the new Master and slave sign their names in the Domesday book. The old slave-applicant is dead, <br />
replaced by a new person. A person born with no other purpose but to serve his Master”<br />
<br />
“And what happens if it doesn't work?” Dan asks.<br />
<br />
“All I can really say is that whatever happens in there, the Patrick going in there is not going to be the <br />
same person coming out. Who or what he becomes is up to you”.</p>
