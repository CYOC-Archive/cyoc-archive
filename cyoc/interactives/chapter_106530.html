<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The café in Moon Lake’s downtown was a busy place. Small, cozy, independent and a relic of the coffee craze in the mid-nineties; while most small time café’s in the state of Washington were swallowed up by, a certain famous coffee establishment know the world over. Moon Lake’s Café Lupa somehow was overlooked. Run by a tough and old grizzled werewolf; the café served the standard fare of basic coffee to the absurd along with an assortment of pastries. Martha was the first to arrive; ordering a non-fat decafe latte and a biscotti she sat at a table by the corner to wait for Amanda Knight. <br />
<br />
It wasn’t long until Amanda enters and is noticed by the store owner.<br />
“You’re usual Mrs. Knight?”<br />
“Yes Louis,” She adds; “and it’s to stay, I’m meeting someone.” Amanda looks around to see a woman who heard the exchange wave to her. Assuming this is Martha, Amanda heads over to sit down. Louis is soon behind to serve Amanda her usual; a triple espresso and a buttered croissant.  Martha is the first to speak.<br />
<br />
“Amanda Knight I presume?”<br />
“Yes,” Amanda responds, “I’m glad you agreed to meet me.”<br />
“You said you wanted to talk regarding what Julie did to our children on Tuesday,” Martha sipping her drink.<br />
“I’ll admit that was a bit of a lie,” Amanda confesses; “My real reason is to meet the parents that Frieda is so passionate in protecting from Benton’s wrath.”<br />
Martha arches an eyebrow, “so this would be a reconnaissance mission? Ferret information and report back to your husband?”<br />
“No nothing like that,” Amanda answers coolly; “But before we continue. Let me ask you this, what do you know of the Knight family?”<br />
“Only what Frieda has told Eric,” Martha answers; “That you and your husband think of themselves as the upper crust and like to lord over everyone through parties, charity balls and other social functions.”<br />
Amanda grimaces. While she and her husband did like attending the many galas that they were invited two or hosted; Amanda didn’t think that Frieda would consider her parents snobs. Amanda goes into trying to undo her daughter’s skewing of the facts and talks to Martha about the family history and its connection to Moon Lake. This goes on for a good while.<br />
<br />
“So you’re saying the Knights had a hand in creating the town?”<br />
“Yes,” Amanda answers, “but the history books are a little sketchy with the information. Suffice it to say, my husband’s ancestors were one of the original families to put down roots here.”<br />
“If you don’t mind my asking,” Martha speaks up; “Why does your husband hate the skulk?”<br />
“You mean Daisuke,” Amanda corrects her; “Benton could care less about the skulk, It’s the man who runs that arm of Tachibana Enterprises he hates.”<br />
“Okay,” so what is the story?” Martha asks.<br />
“It all goes back to when Benton and Daisuke first met in high school, or so I heard.” Amanda pauses to sip her espresso, “While I don’t have all the facts, what I do know is there was some physical altercation between the two and Benton walked away with his right arm broken in three places.”<br />
“But as a were he healed up fairly quick,” Martha adds.<br />
“Yes,” Amanda answers; “but that is not the real reason for Benton’s hatred. Benton was the school’s quarterback. After his arm was broken he had to be cut from the team, his replacement a skinny fellow I don’t know much about; lead the school to its first state championship. Benton to say the least was pissed.”<br />
“So his ire over Daisuke stems from being denied a trophy?”<br />
“So much so, that when his takeover bid of Tachibana was discovered and stymied, he flew off the handle. Marched down to their head office around the corner and did a really stupid thing;” Amanda sighs.<br />
Okay, I’ll bite,” Martha getting curious, “What did Benton do?”<br />
“I really don’t want to get into the details,” Amanda getting uncomfortable; ”suffice to say, Benton has been duly punished by the were-council and will be required to make restitution. He was also threatened by Tachibana herself to not try and bring any harm to your family or the Lawson’s.” Amanda pauses to finish her espresso, “My big worry is what an effect this will have when the town gets wind of this.”<br />
“You’re worried about becoming pariahs?” Martha asks.<br />
“When you are wealthy and have a social calendar filled with all sorts of functions,” Amanda states; “you tend to wonder if those invitations will get ‘lost’ or those you count as friends all of a sudden come up with an emergency as to why they can’t come over for dinner or attend a function you’re hosting.”<br />
<br />
Amanda is clearly holding back tears; while Martha may not have any love for Amanda; she doesn’t have any ill will towards her either. “I may know of a way to perhaps put you back in your social circles good graces as it where;” Martha speaks up.<br />
“What? How?” Amanada responds.<br />
<br />
Martha explains that as a teacher, she would be at moon lake elementary teaching a class. Yet due to last night’s storm, the school had to be closed. The basement flooded when the power cut; the roof of the original portion of the school leaks and needs replacing; plus a tree fell over a power line preventing the school to open period.<br />
<br />
“The school needs funds to fix these immediate issues and possibly others that crop up,” Martha goes on; “bake sales and calendar drives that the PTA will undoubtedly suggest just won’t cut it.”<br />
“That would go a long way to repairing some of the damage Benton did to his standing in the town,” Amanda thinks; “But he’ll never go for it. He’s always been in favor of knocking that school down and building a new one in its place.”<br />
“Well do it then,” Martha states; “either way, think of the children of Moon Lake.”<br />
“Easier said than done,” Amanda answers; “The original section of your elementary school is a heritage building. A building Benton can’t stand.”<br />
“Why not build the new school in another part of the town town?” Martha asks, finishing up her latte.<br />
<br />
Amanda can’t think of a response. She just stares at her untouched croissant; Martha speaks up again.<br />
“A decision needs to be made soon. While the school may be able to function for another semester or two, eventually these issues will force the town to do something drastic.”<br />
“I’ll talk to my Husband regarding the school issues,” Amanda answers; “But can I ask you something?”<br />
“What is it you want to ask?” Martha wonders<br />
“Would you have an issue if your son was gay or bi-sexual?”<br />
“If they were being true to themselves, then no”; Martha answers, knowing full well this is in regards to Frieda outing herself as bisexual. “I take it we are now talking about your daughter?”<br />
“You saw through that,” Amanda sighs.<br />
“I’m a mother and a teacher,” Martha answers; “It comes with the job description. But getting back to your daughter, I suggest you ask her for the answers you seek, because I can’t give them.”<br />
<br />
Amanda thinks on what Martha said she wants to tell her something but is hesitant; she looks at her watch to see its roughly noon. “My, we have been here for hours!”<br />
“You have an appointment to keep?” Martha asks.<br />
“Not per say,” Amanda gets ups; “But I do need to get back home and sort of check up on my husband. What with everything he did yesterday. I need to make sure he is alright.”<br />
“Then I’ll let you get to it then,” Martha acknowledges, holding out her hand; “It was nice to finally meet you.”<br />
“You as well,” Amanda accepting the hand and shaking it; “Perhaps we should meet up again?”<br />
“On a weekend,” Martha answers; “I’m a teacher that just lucked out on a day off today.”<br />
<br />
Amanda smiles and walks out the café. Martha still sitting in her seat gets her cellphone to text Eric a message.<br />
‘Just had an interesting conversation with Frieda’s mother; Would Frieda be willing to talk after school as to what happened with her parents yesterday? It sounded like Amanda needed to get something off her chest but was reluctant to do so.’<br />
Martha hits send and heads out of the coffee shop. She see Tachibana headquarters as she gets into her car and drives back home.</p>
