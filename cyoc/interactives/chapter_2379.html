<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Timothy took several deep breaths as he peered out the window, looking after his employees.  His heart was still racing from his near-discovery; his large, vulpine ears twitching as he watched Saul, Scott and the others, go.  He pulled the blinds almost completely closed and watched as they crossed the salvage yard to the huge piles of debris from the Haversome mansion purchase.  After a few more minutes, they'd all settled in to work sorting furnature from cloth from personal belongings.
<br />

<br />
Finally, the fox allowed himself a sigh of relief.
<br />

<br />
Crossing back to the chest, Timothy picked it up and examined its five gemstone buttons again.  &quot;Ok, the last one -the one with all the arrows pointing out of the center- that one changed my species...&quot; he mused, aloud.  &quot;So, what about this one...?&quot;  His finger traced the delicate etching on the red, gemstone button in the middle.
<br />

<br />
It had the classic symbol of a male -a circle with an arrow pointing out of the top of it- and was centrally located.  &quot;Maybe the other buttons change you in some way and this one changes you back into a normal man...?&quot;
<br />

<br />
He nodded to himself and scratched at his T-shirt's collar where his newly-grown fur itched from the cloth covering.  In fact, his whole body itched, now, and was getting rather warm from the combination of fur and clothes.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; he said, ruefully, looking back at his long, bushy tail as it swished over the waistband of his pants, &quot;hopefully this'll soon be back to normal...&quot;
<br />

<br />
With that, Timothy put pressure on the middle button and kept inserting keys until he found the one that allowed the button to depress.
<br />

<br />
The lid popped open with a tiny *click*.
<br />

<br />
To his surprise, there was no, reddish dust inside this time.  Instead, a bright flash filled the room causing him to squint sharply!  Groaning in annoyance, Timothy covered his face with the back of his hand until the sudden flare subsided.  He looked into the box, cautiously.
<br />

<br />
Nothing.
<br />

<br />
It was empty.
<br />

<br />
No sign of wires, lightbulbs, flash paper or anything that could have made that strange, piercing light.
<br />

<br />
Putting the box down and closing the lid, Timothy left his living room.  The faded and peeling wallpaper in his bedroom framed him nicely as he looked into the full-length mirror that hung on the back of his door.  His heart was racing again, but this time in anticipation...
<br />

<br />
&quot;Come on...  Come on...!&quot; he muttered, in increasingly louder urgency.  Nothing appeared to be happening.  He felt no different and the fur on his body -his red and black, fur-covered vulpine body- was as present as it had been ever since the first time he'd opened that box...
<br />

<br />
&quot;Damnit...&quot; he muttered, turning away from the reflective surface.  &quot;I was so sure...!&quot;  The young man sighed and shook his head, cupping his hand under his elongated muzzle and chin.  &quot;Now what...?&quot;
<br />

<br />
He had to admit, for his current situation, Timothy was feeling surprisingly well.  In fact, and perhaps this was more due to the old stereotype about what men always have on their minds, he was feeling it in his groin.  He chuckled under his breath and muttered, &quot;...down, boy...&quot; to himself as he reached down to rub the heavy lump in his jeans.
<br />

<br />
The tighness of his jeans, in part caused by the new layer of fur that covered his legs, made the bulge in-between feel larger.  He grinned at that and thought how that would look if he went down to &quot;Rainbow Road&quot;, the local gay bar, to show off.  If anyone overlooked his fox-features- and given some of the shallow guys that hung out there, they just might- a bulge as big as the one he was sporting now would get him laid, for sure...
<br />

<br />
He chuckled at the thought and rubbed his groin some more, glancing down with his sharp eyes.  Pausing, he looked a bit closer and pressed his fingers to the sides of the huge bulge in his jeans.  It *did* look larger, of course, but why this big?  It was almost as if he had more fur down there getting all bunched up alongside his cock...
<br />

<br />
His pants bulged a bit more as he watched and he felt a twinge of tightness creeping along his clothed sex.  Slowly, his muzzle began to hang open in dumbfounded amazement.  The tubular outline of his penis, nicely showing thanks to the newly-developed tightness of his clothing, was getting not only thicker, but longer as well...!
<br />

<br />
Quickly, he pulled his hand away and stared at himself, moving to sit on his bed.  The motion gave him a twinge of tighness in his balls that made him realize that the growth wasn't only effecting the length and thickness of his shaft.  Rather, as he examined the swelling beneath his jeans, he found that his entire sex was getting bigger.
<br />

<br />
While he'd always been an &quot;average&quot; guy, before, he'd always managed to feel good about himself just from the fact he was a good lover...  But, now, as he watched his groin slowly expand -stretching the fabric of his jeans- he began to feel his heart rate rise, yet again.  Already, the thick, tubular bulge -feeling erotically tight, now- had inched its way down his pants' leg by several inches and the bulge of his ball sac in between his legs was starting to show as two, distinct bulges, now!
<br />

<br />
Tentatively, he put his paw to his groin again.  The growth wasn't slowing down and seemed to be making him slightly horny.
<br />

<br />
Thinking back to the box he'd left in the living room, Timothy groaned.  &quot;The third button ...the 'male' button...  It makes your sex ... bigger!&quot;  He groaned as a flush came over his lean, foxish body, and he felt his cock -still soft but thick and tightly packed- grow a few inches more down the leg of his trousers.</p>
