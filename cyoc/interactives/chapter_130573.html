<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
I was the first to arrive back at Rod&#39;s. After letting Biddy into the house and receiving a rousing greeting, I put a load of washing in the wash and tidied the room I had been using. I was looking with satisfaction at the room when Biddy started making a fuss at the front door. It was Rod. He came in gave Biddy a scratch and greeted me.<br />
He put the kettle on and while it was boiling told me that Sarah had rung him to say he probably wouldn&#39;t get here till 6. Because &#39;Zach&#39; was taking tomorrow off he had to stay at work a bit later to finish some paperwork.  <br />
That still gave us time to make the change but it was getting tight as once I was &#39;Zach&#39; again, I needed to pick up Amanda from her flat and take her to her parents by 7.<br />
Rod asked &quot;Is your period finished?&quot;<br />
I looked at him. That was not a statement two blokes would normally converse about. But strange things had happened in the last week. When I replied it was in his fiancé Sarah&#39;s voice. &quot;Yes it is over....... I hope we can remain friends&quot;<br />
&quot;Things have happened Zach. You have been very brave. I admire you for the way you have handled the situation. Remember I too have felt what female hormones can do to you. We have had a shared experience..... I think we can be better mates than ever&quot;<br />
These damn female hormones were getting to me again, I was all teary. I sniffled but related a thought that had come to me as I had been driving from work &quot;I was thinking that Sarah might appreciate if I gave her body back freshly showered but not with a period. If I had a shower now, I could create that situation by sharing something I put on as soon as I got out&quot;<br />
Rod obviously followed my train of thought and said &quot;That&#39;s a good idea, I&#39;m sure she will appreciate that. However you need to be quick, maybe don&#39;t wash your hair&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; I glanced at the clock. &quot;I&#39;ll be out by 6&quot; with that I grabbed the silk gown from the bedroom and proceeded to have a shower. <br />
After I had dried myself I put back on my work clothes but then wore the gown over the top. Now if Sarah touched the gown to the medallion she should turn into an exact copy of me as I was right now. I took the gown off again and hung it on a hook behind the door.<br />
As I exited Biddy was excitedly yapping near the front door. It must be Sarah, my timing had been perfect.<br />
I raced over to the door and opened it, eager to complete the exchange. But it wasn&#39;t Sarah, it was Mrs McKenzie, Sarah&#39;s mum.<br />
&quot;Well aren&#39;t you going to invite your mother in&quot; I realized I had been staring at her with my mouth open<br />
&quot;Ummm. Sure Mum,  I was expecting someone else. Come in, Meet Biddy&quot;<br />
She crouched down and greeted Biddy who jumped around excitedly. &quot;I came to drop off that dress I had drycleaned. It&#39;s on the rear seat. Why don&#39;t you fetch it while I make friends with Biddy&quot; She looked past me to Rod &quot;Hello Rod&quot; <br />
&quot;Hello Eileen. Welcome to my house. Would you like me to show you around?&quot;<br />
&quot;I would love that&quot;<br />
While Rod showed her through the house, I collected the dress from Mum&#39;s car. It was the silver dress that Jenna had worn to Sarah&#39;s engagement dinner. It was the dress that Karen and Marlene from work expected Sarah to wear to the cocktail dinner tomorrow night. I took it to the guest bedroom and hung it in the wardrobe with the rest of Sarah&#39;s clothes. <br />
I heard another knock on the door, Biddy came yapping into the lounge. This time it was Sarah.<br />
I greeted him &quot;Hi Zach come in, Rod&#39;s showing &#39;Mum&#39; around the house he won&#39;t be long&quot;<br />
Sarah took the hint &quot;Hello Sarah, I came to discuss some IT issues with Rod&quot;<br />
&quot;Come in and have a cuppa&quot; I said.<br />
As we moved to the kitchen Rod and Eileen returned from the back yard. &quot;Mum, do you remember Zach, Rod&#39;s best friend, He was at my 21st&quot;<br />
&quot;Hello Zach, Nice to meet you again, please call me Eileen&quot;<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you again Eileen&quot;<br />
&quot;Sarah, I would like you to try on that dress. I had to make some small repairs and it might need some adjustment&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure Mum. come with me to the bedroom&quot; Time was ticking away and we needed to swap back. I hoped this wouldn&#39;t take long.<br />
I led her to the spare room, thankful that I had tidied it earlier. I took the dress back out of the cupboard and out of the plastic drycleaners sheath. &quot;The stains came out well, it looks brand new&quot;<br />
She closed the door &quot;Try it on.  The shoulder straps were torn and I have had to replace them. They are just pinned at the moment. I&#39;ve bought a sewing kit&quot;<br />
I stripped off down to my bra and panties and pulled the dress over my head. I thought it fitted well. &#39;Mum&#39; fiddled with the straps. I could feel her adjusting the pins &quot;That should do&quot; she said. As I pulled off the dress she suggested &quot;It would look best with a strapless bra&quot; <br />
I handed her the dress and she took it out to the better light in the kitchen to do the required stitching. I quickly put the work clothes back on. Sarah and Rod were at the computer as I came back into the lounge. Sarah pointed at her wrist indicating we needed to hurry. <br />
I left &#39;Mum&#39; to do the stitching undisturbed. Although it only took her 5 minutes it seemed more like an hour. While waiting I looked at Biddy who was dozing by the couch. I noticed a bra on the floor near him and was embarrassed by the idea that Mum might have seen it. Rod had stripped it off me on Tuesday night during our aborted lovemaking. I discretely poked it with my toe further behind couch.<br />
Eventually &#39;Mum&#39; said &quot;Done&quot; and showed me the shoulder straps.<br />
&quot;Thanks Mum, it looks sensational&quot; I took the dress off her and pulled her up and towards the door. &quot;Dad will be wondering where you are&quot; <br />
&quot;I suppose I had better go and get dinner started&quot;<br />
&quot;We will come around on Saturday to collect the rest of my stuff&quot; I gave her a brief hug.<br />
&quot;Bye Eileen&quot; called Rod and Zach<br />
We all watched as her car drove off.<br />
&quot;Ok, We are running out of time&quot; said Sarah <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get the medallion&quot; said Rod and ran to the bedroom.<br />
I went to the bathroom and grabbed the silk robe &quot;Use this&quot; I said to Sarah &quot;It will make you freshly showered and with your period newly finished&quot; <br />
&quot;Good idea&quot; he said. &quot;Here use this&quot; he said, removed his shirt and threw it too me. I wasn&#39;t ready and missed it. It fell behind the couch.<br />
Rod came back with the medallion. &quot;Who&#39;s first?&quot; and put the medallion down on the bench. <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go&quot; I said, I picked up the medallion and held it in my left hand. With my right hand I reached behind the couch felt the shirt Sarah had thrown me, pulled it out and touched my hands together. I felt a strong tingle. <br />
I put the shirt down and handed the medallion to Sarah she touched it to the silk robe. She said &quot;Ouch&quot; as she felt a zap.<br />
Knowing we would quickly change we went to the bathroom to watch in the mirror. We stripped off down to our undies so that clothes would not get torn. Sarah was noticeably shrinking, his hair was getting longer and darker. He was becoming a she again.  <br />
I felt like I was changing, feeling a buzz go through my body, but watching in the mirror nothing was happening. I was still Sarah.<br />
&quot;The period has finished&quot; I sobbed &quot;Why aren&#39;t I changing?&quot; My twin and Rod looked at me. &quot;I need to be me again and get over to Amanda&quot;<br />
&quot;Try again&quot; said Rod. Sarah showed me where she had put the medallion, I picked it up and went to the couch and picked up the &#39;Zach&#39; shirt. I touched it to the medallion. This time I did not feel a zap.  Nothing happened. <br />
Rod who had been watching me grunted &quot;Zach, look what&#39;s tangled in the shirt&quot;<br />
I had a close look at the shirt. The bra was entangled with it. The medallion must have contacted the bra when I first touched it. &quot;I think I have just turned into Tuesday night Sarah&quot; <br />
I explained to Rod and Sarah how I had seen the bra earlier and pushed it behind the couch to hide it from &#39;Mum&#39;. Between us we deduced what had happened.<br />
&quot;Zach need&#39;s to pick up Amanda 5 minutes ago&quot; said Sarah who now was wearing the silk robe. &quot;You will have to become Zach&quot; she said turning to Rod. &quot;You are the only one of us who can change&quot; None of us could think of any other solution. <br />
Rod picked up the &#39;Zach&#39; shirt extricated the bra then touched the medallion to the shirt. He said he felt a zap. Not waiting for the change to complete he dressed in the clothes Sarah had arrived in, took my old car keys and left to pick up Amanda. We calculated he would be changed completely by the time he arrived.<br />
I realized that now it would be Rod who spent the weekend with Amanda in Sydney.</p>
