<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;They told me that it was temporary...&quot; Nick said while he watched the content inside the bag he received at the info booth. &quot;Maybe I just should join Riley, so he won&#39;t feel alone.&quot; He took the white banana hammock and stared at it for a moment. &quot;It&#39;s disturbingly huge.&quot; He thought while he remembered what happened to Riley and how graphic and grotesque was his transformation. He sighed and took a decision, but first he needed to find his best friend.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Kit had invited Riley to his room and they&#39;re taking the elevator to go there. Kit loved doing crazy spontaneous stuff and doing it with a guy like Riley was a pretty good example of that. Having a little affair with a huge bear man was something he didn&#39;t expect to do in his vacation, but he won&#39;t say no to the chance of trying the experience. However, Riley had no idea what&#39;s going on, in his youth mind, he was following his idol to his room, so he can see some cool stuff Kit has.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is Riley?&quot; Nick said after trying to call his friend for the fifth time, but it was pointless because Riley had left his phone in their room. Nick asked to the receptionist but he replied he hadn&#39;t seen any guy with that description. &quot;Maybe he&#39;s doing something at the hotel.&quot; He thought and asked the receptionist if there&#39;s activities to do inside the place. The guy gave Nick a pamphlet that mentioned several activities like karaoke and a little movie theater.<br />
<br />
Riley and Kit arrived at Kit&#39;s room which was at the highest floor in the hotel. It was way more bigger than Riley and Nick&#39;s room with it&#39;s own pool, a big living room and access to the rooftop where there&#39;s a place to throw parties if Kit wanted it. Riley hadn&#39;t seen that amount of luxury before and he was fascinated. He asked Kit if he&#39;s planning to have a party there and Kit told him that he actually was, but firstly he want to know the place and meet some people.<br />
<br />
Nick had visited all the places in the pamphlet and Riley wasn&#39;t in any of them. He also noticed that the hotel was now full of huge bear men just like Riley. He had learned at the info booth the island was celebrating the bear week, so they had given those speedoes to their guests. It was impossible to know if one of those men were kids like him or Riley just by looking at them. The transformation was incredibly astounding and it change a body completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want a drink?&quot; Kit asked Riley who was watching the enormous TV in Kit&#39;s bedroom. He didn&#39;t pay too much attention and nodded, thinking Kit&#39;s going to give him a soda or a lemonade. However, Kit still believed that Riley was a grown man, so obviously he was making something more fitting than a soda. He&#39;s proud of his mixology knowledge, so he can create strong alcoholic beverages that tastes amazing and hides the alcohol flavor very well.<br />
<br />
Nick was no longer sure to wait for finding Riley. Seeing more and more men happily hanging out in the hotel, made him wonder what would happen to him if he wears his speedo. He went to a restroom and inside a cabin he took the speedo once again. &quot;But Riley won&#39;t recognize me...&quot; He thought while he stared at the white fabric in his hands. He remembered how much Riley changed. Fat, hair, muscles. &quot;It&#39;s temporary... they said...&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley didn&#39;t understand why but he felt really happy and fuzzy after drinking several cups of that sweet lemonade that Kit gave him. He can&#39;t recognize less and less about his surroundings, so he was focusing his attention only on Kit who was almost as drunk as him. They chatted nonsenses for hours, they kissed, danced, played videogame and made out in several occasions. They barely can speak and walk, so they decided to move to the jacuzzi.<br />
<br />
Nick was almost decided to try the speedo when he heard someone else coming into the restroom. Apparently, it was a father and his son who were arguing about wearing the speedo. According to what Nick can hear, the man had already wore his speedo, but after watching his father changing into a hairy bag of lard, the son has rejected to do it. &quot;This vacation was really expensive, so you&#39;re going to use the speedo if you want it or not!&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley was already inside the jacuzzi drinking something that tasted like Coke with something else. He was so drunk that he was farting and pissing inside the jacuzzi, but the water and it&#39;s bubbles were hiding it. Kit was ready to go in as well, but he was way more dressed than Riley who was only wearing his blue speedo. So, he remembered he also received a speedo from the hotel and he took it. He didn&#39;t think too much about and started to undress in front of Riley.<br />
<br />
&quot;No daddy! Please! Don&#39;t do this to me!&quot; The boy yelled but his small 11 year old frame couldn&#39;t fight off his dad. &quot;I don’t care what you want, boy. I&#39;ve paid too much money for this and you&#39;re going to use it!&quot; The man replied and Nick, hiding in a stall watched how the man put a huge gray speedo between the boy&#39;s thin legs. &quot;Ooooh!!&quot; The boy moaned while the speedo&#39;s magic was coursing through his body. He was shivering almost like he&#39;s going to convulse.<br />
<br />
Hi small legs and torso immediately stretched rapidly to the size of 6ft. His feet bursted out to wide size 15 feet. &quot;Uuuh! Daddy! I feel so weird!&quot; His voice was already much deeper. His legs grew thick with muscle and fat so rapidly that they crushed his genitals for a moment. Then his torso went through 20 years of puberty and growth. His body quickly formed large meaty pecs and abs that immediately got covered by a thick rug of black hair. His arms lengthened and grew large and thick biceps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh!! Daddy! Make it stop!!&quot; The guy yelled but it was like he&#39;s in a trance because he didn&#39;t fight against his changes. Next his hands grew massive followed by his shoulders broadening and ripping his unbuttoned shirt clean off of him. Then his face went through so much change that Nick could barely recognize the young boy he once was about a minute ago. He was as astounded and shocked like when he watched Riley changing a few hours ago.<br />
<br />
The guy&#39;s father stood in awe as he watched his son shake and grow rapidly. He looked down as his son&#39;s growing package and filling the gray speedo that seemed huge on him a minute ago. He couldn&#39;t believe how big his son was getting and stared at his son&#39;s growing balls and dick. They grew so large that they were pushing against the material of the speedo to escape. The bulge was big, obscene and disturbing at Nick&#39;s eyes and now he was thinking twice about wearing his speedo.<br />
<br />
The new man was pulling at his speedo in a sexual frenzy but he couldn&#39;t succeed at pulled it down. His dad stepped in to help his now grown man son and pulled down the clothing for him which revealed a huge package equipped with large hairy balls and a throbbing cock. The former boy immediately came all over his own hairy chest and passed out with sweat all over his body from the rapid growth. The father felt proud and happy and started to masturbate immediately after.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god! That was sick!&quot; Nick cried out inwardly as he now gazed upon a 30 something year old bear of a man laying where once a small innocent and childish 11 year old boy was. &quot;I definitely must find Riley before I wear that thing. If that happens to all the guys that wear those speedoes, I will need him at my side.&quot; He carefully left the restroom without being noticed by the father and ran back to his hotel room.</p>
