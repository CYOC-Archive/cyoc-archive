<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You arrive in a room, though the bright light takes you little time to see where you are. Behind you a door suddenly shuts and ahead of you is the spinning hypnotic wheel. It took only a second but you feel your eyes glued to the spiral once again.<br />
<br />
“There you are dude! Oh and you brought a friend! You sure were rude, leaving me in such a hurry!”<br />
<br />
Merely looking away was an ordeal but you notice that this room has a lot of doors. You feel like this must be the core room of the funhouse. “Aand you finally took off your clothes! Nice. Just sit down, my friends” the voice said and you obeyed without question, carefully making sure you wouldn&#39;t sit on your tail.<br />
<br />
“HAAAAW” Max attempted to speak. “PleAWWWse let us go.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa man, you sound like a real donkey! Hey can you do that as well?” the voice asks you.<br />
<br />
You attempt to keep your mouth shut. You don&#39;t want to obey the voice... but the voice is so tempting and the spiral urges you to.<br />
<br />
“Come on, man. I bet it feels really good when you do it.” The voice was right. It felt good when you brayed. Surely it would feel good now too.<br />
<br />
The mental struggle was pressing but soon enough you found your mouth open and a bray come out.<br />
<br />
“Come on, dude. Is that all you&#39;ve got? Your pal here sure can bray a lot better!” The mocking merely angered you and without holding back you brayed louder than ever “HEEE HAWW HEE HAAAAAAW HEEE HAWWWWW” your voice distorting, sounding pretty much like a real donkey.<br />
<br />
Max, not wanting to be left behind, joined in and you brayed like the donkeys you were becoming. The experience was also very arousing. Your cock began to swell, bigger than ever before. Taking a quick glance at Max you saw his member erect as well.<br />
<br />
“There, there, dudes. It&#39;s alright. See, doesn&#39;t it just feel right? Don&#39;t you want this? To be donkeys? Wouldn&#39;t that be awesome? Exciting?” <br />
<br />
Your eyes were still glued to the wheel but somehow the shapes began to make sense. You could see farms, barns, other animals. Donkeys... not just donkeys but female donkeys. The images felt so vivid. You saw a jenny and her rear. Your cock expanded even further, the mushroom head beginning to flatten. Thoughts entered your mind. You needed to mount her.<br />
<br />
You moved your hand to your cock and began to jerk it. Part of the member had fused with your belly and the fleshy tube grew far longer than any human cock. <br />
<br />
Your hand however still had that annoying gooey substance and it was fairly difficult to open it wide enough to accommodate your enormous member and even then you could barely feel the fingers.<br />
<br />
“HAAAWW HEE HAWWWW HEEE HAWWW” you heard by your side. Max was pumping his cock as well, fully absorbed in the vision and braying loudly. The vision once again became your world as you imagined mounting her, shoving your donkey cock right into her warm hole. As you kept jerking off and imaging it your cock turned black and heavier. You sat upright against a wall and used your second hand to jerk off as well. Your cock had become so big that both hands couldn&#39;t even match the size and the poor range of movement of your fingers wasn&#39;t enough to properly hold it.<br />
<br />
Fluids began to drip from the tip and you could feel the climax approaching. Your groans and breathing became irregular as a tremendous bray erupted “HEEEEEEEE HAWWWWWWW” you shouted, white ropes of cum erupting.<br />
<br />
As your donkey cock began to deflate you noticed your hands becoming even stiffer. The goo began to solidify and with each second it became harder and harder to move your fingers.<br />
<br />
“WHAAAAAt&#39;s HAAAAAWpening HE HAAWW” you ask, barely able to form words.<br />
<br />
“I hope you enjoyed touching your junk, man, &#39;cause it&#39;s time for your hands and feet to go” the voice merrily said.<br />
<br />
You bray in panic as you watch the fingers in your hands finally fusing with the goo and becoming hooves. Your arms shortened and articulations cracked as they assumed their new posture. You felt the same cracks in your legs and saw how your toes also fused together and became hooves.<br />
<br />
You can see Max, already with hooves formed, carefully taking steps. His brays sounded excited and he even began trotting.<br />
<br />
“Noooooo, Mawwwx! D-doooon&#39;t give HAAAW” it&#39;s so difficult to talk now but you haven&#39;t given up just yet. Pushing yourself against a corner of the room you bring yourself up, using your hands to support. But it&#39;s useless. Your feet are no longer made to walk standing up and your legs, though strong, are not articulated for bipedal walking. You gloomily accept: you have no hands and feet, only hooves.<br />
<br />
Max, seeing you distraught, walks towards you. It&#39;s difficult to even understand him between the braying and grunting sound of his voice but you make out a “Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll go to the farm soon.” Your growing animal part reveled with that though your human part only got more worried. <br />
<br />
“PlEEEW HAAAse let us gooooo HAWW” you beg the spiral.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;ve done excellent, both of you! But just one more thing. You keep using words. Listen, that would be fine but you are donkeys. Donkeys don&#39;t talk, you see?”<br />
<br />
Max nodded and brayed, agreeing.<br />
<br />
“Isn&#39;t braying so much easier? Much less complicated than those big words you&#39;re trying to say.”<br />
<br />
Max brayed again. “You get it! Can you speak?” the voice asked Max. His reply came only in the form of braying. You could tell he had been trying to speak at first but seeing that he couldn&#39;t he began a string of happy brays that didn&#39;t resemble any words whatsoever. You understood that Max&#39;s vocal chords were now those of a donkey.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re awfully quiet. Don&#39;t you enjoy braying?” The voice asked you.<br />
<br />
Unintentionally you let a loud bray escape. Fighting the voice and the pleasure the changes have been giving you was tough but eventually you manage to say “I&#39;m no donkeeey. I&#39;m a humAAAAW”<br />
<br />
The voice laughs, mocking you. “You can&#39;t even stop braying, dude. Doesn&#39;t it feel nice to be an animal? Didn&#39;t you enjoy seeing the farm?”<br />
<br />
That mention made you remember the barns and the other donkeys, especially the female ones. Your cock once again began to stir, leaving its new sheath. Max stood next to you, braying as if trying to convince you.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re resilient, gotta give you that. One final test: if you win I won&#39;t bother you again. Look at the spiral and read aloud what you see.” Your pride beats caution as you gaze upon the spiral and two sentences appear: “Donkeys can&#39;t read. Donkeys can&#39;t talk.”<br />
<br />
As you get ready to say the words out loud somehow the words lost their meaning. Not only that but even the meaning of those letters elude you. They didn&#39;t shift and change but somehow they suddenly seemed just so void of sense. Can you read these? Could anyone even understand them? Drawings, they were just drawings. You can&#39;t read that. In fact in your mind you can&#39;t ever believe you&#39;ve been able to read such symbols.<br />
<br />
You try to tell the voice that you can&#39;t read but only braying comes out. Max looks at you anxiously and brays as well, encouraging you to bray even louder. <br />
<br />
“Isn&#39;t that so much better? You&#39;re almost done! Just head through this door” the voice guided and you both happily walked towards the next room.</p>
