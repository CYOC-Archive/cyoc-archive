<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke lay scratching his hairy stomach when his phone vibrated, picking it up he had received a text from an unknown number “Hey sexy, u ready for the party 2night? B at urs in 10, got wine!!!!!! xoxo”. He frowned reading this message, normally he’d have just assumed it was a wrong number and ignored it but somewhere deep in his mind he knew it was for him, if only he could remember who it was from, he’s too socially awkward to ask who it is and I mean he should kno….. wait 10? ‘Shit!” Luke jumped to his feet, the one thing he did know is that he was definitely going to a party tonight which means that he needs to get dressed properly and quickly, looking down at the baggy t-shirt covering his mild gut and his grey lounge pants he felt a surge of horror run through his body, how could he wear such disgusting stuff? Luke quickly pulled the clothes off, followed by his comfy but oh so ugly boxers.<br />
<br />
Luke looked down at his body and felt a sudden surge of vertigo and dizziness. His whole body just felt wrong for some reason, he wasn’t sure why, I mean it was the same body that a very unkind and early puberty left him with at 15, 6’4, annoyingly hairy, skinny all over apart from his gut and his (admittedly) pretty good looking legs, size 14 feet. As he ran through each of these items in his head though it all seemed so, so not him. Anyway he needed to snap out of this, get himself in gear, only 8 minutes now, he grabbed his phone and opened Spotify, hitting shuffle on his playlist, Guerrilla Radio by Rage Against The Machine began to play, normally this song would get him amped up but now it just sounded like a barrage of noise, he squirmed and skipped to the next track and the next and the next until he heard the familiar opening of Toxic by Britney Spears and smiled broadly, he jumped to his feet and began to dance around his room, losing himself slightly in the music.<br />
<br />
As his naked body gyrated his stomach jiggled, with each bounce it shrunk, the fat sucking away and syphoning into his bony ass which began to bulge outwards. Luke continued to sway and gyrate, his hands beginning to roam his body, everywhere they touched the hair fell away and evaporated in the air, he let out a soft moan as he explored his flat, smooth torso, his skin felt so sensitive, must be the new moisturiser he was using. His room slowly began shifting around him, a range of cosmetic products appearing by his bed which itself was doubling in width and looking a whole lot cleaner. Luke’s hands reached lower until the tip of the middle finger on his right hand brushed against his shaft and he let out a higher pitched moan and frantically grabbed at his cock. He fell back onto his bed as sheer lust filled him, he was a horny guy at the best of times but this was a whole new level. He began to play with himself, not noticing as his average cock grew thinner just like the fingers wrapped around it, his bitten nails pushing out into a perfection that could only be maintained by a weekly manicure. As he closed his eyes and moaned even more (Which one part of his mind told him was not usual for him, memories though flashed through his head of himself during his early days of discovering self-pleasure, having to bite down on something, anything around him to stop the incessant yelps of joy from waking up anyone in house) he pictured a buxom woman dancing in front of him, strobe lights pounding, with each flash of the lights the woman’s breasts flattened, her body widened and thickened and her face squared until Luke was picturing a Tarzan of a man thrusting his sizeable bulge in Luke’s face. Luke continued to lose himself further and further in ecstasy, his long legs were hanging over the edge of the bed and then began to slowly pull back as his feet shrunk and softened, his thick thighs lessening as his body compacted by a whole foot.<br />
<br />
His dark thoughts and loneliness were lost in the throes of passion and then as he came harder than he ever had before they were lost for good, a permanent bubbliness descending upon him, ‘cheery’ was a word used to describe Luke a lot, as he sat up, throwing the tissue he had been using in the bin and caught a glimpse of himself in the full length mirror that now adorned a corner of his room the other word people used came straight into his mind ‘cute’. Well at least from the neck down people would say he was cute and a whole hell of a lot of people had seen Luke from the neck down, most not even through choice, he just had very low inhibitions and little modesty. His face though was pretty average and he frowned to himself, that annoyingly early receding hairline was getting worse week by week, he looked over his array of cans, lotions and other such things and grabbed 4 different hair products. As he began to attempt to cover his forehead he failed to notice the golden bristles poking through the former bald patches and as he moulded his normal mousey limp brown hair the bristles erupted forth, whilst at the same time the rest of his hair doubled in thickness and the gold washed over it from the roots up as well until Luke was tousling his usual mildly shaggy blonde cut, he tried to make it look a little unkempt and rough but looking at it for more than a second would tell you that this was a guy who spent 30 minutes each day putting it all in place and went and got a full shampoo and cut every week at the hairdresser to keep it the exact length, as it settled into place he squirted some hairspray over it, he closed his eyelids over dull brown eyes as he sprayed and opened them to look straight into his bright baby blues, a constant lust always clear in them.<br />
<br />
Luke gazed over his wardrobe and pulled out a tight pair of denim shorts and an even tighter pink t-shirt, as he gazed at the outfit only word came to mind and that was slutty, Luke giggled ‘perfect!’ it’d been 3 days since he last got laid and that was the longest he’d gone in about 2 years, to say Luke loved sex was putting it lightly, he lived for it, he needed it to function, hell there’s a reason he has to jack off 4 times a day and that’s because someone put a giant’s worth of sexual energy into one tiny body which is why, Luke thought to himself, I put so much effort into making this tiny body as sexy as possible! His average frame began to tone, he had a very strict workout regime so never got too big but he was covered in thin, smooth muscle, his biceps with the slightest curve to them, thighs thin but firm. the only thing he really put effort into was his glutes, genetics had already blessed him with a good ass but he smirked as he groped the inflating balls that were his cheeks, his ass was a work of art and he knew it. He let out yet another soft moan as he kneaded his two globes. Of course the most important workout he did was his yoga, flexibility was soooooo important for sex. He quickly pulled some skimpy underwear from a drawer and slipped it on over his 4” cock. His phone burst to life with a Katy Perry song as he grabbed it and saw a new text “2 mins away, u better be ready! Plenty of time for sexxxy stuff l8r xoxo” the message now had a name attached to it, Richie. Memories flooded Luke’s head of his first day after moving onto campus, he was sitting on a bench staring at the hot jocks trying to utilise his gaydar to work out who to approach when he saw what he immediately knew would be his biggest competition, 5’6” of pure Latin twinkiness, they locked eyes and Richie came over and what began as a wary feeling out process turned into a hot and heavy feeling out process in Luke’s bed, now they were the best of friends, workout partners and occasional fuck buddies, only if they both didn’t score though of course, nothing they liked more than finding themselves two studs, they shared their men as well, Luke was just happy to find someone who finally understood just how much sex mattered!<br />
<br />
Luke hurried back to his cosmetics and grabbed foundation, as he began to apply it to his face it smoothed, his harsh brow softening, nose shrinking to a cute button, eyebrows thinning into plucked perfection. The foundation seemed to meld with his skin as a light tan swept over his body, smoothing out all kinks in his skin. His face rounded into cherubic perfection as he expertly finished his makeup and stared at himself, he had to admit he was insanely hot, he felt his cock twitch again and began to lose himself in his constant haze of lust again when Richie opened the door, “Hey babez! You still not ready? The party’s already starte…” Richie caught the look in Luke’s eyes and smirked, they weren’t gonna be leaving for the party for a while.<br />
