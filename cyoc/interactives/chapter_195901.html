<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You decide your first course of action it to find the magic socks. Obviously they seemed to have worked, perhaps TOO well. When the clerk told you it would make you into a carbon copy of someone, you didn’t expect them to literally have your reality alter to the shoes you put on. <br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to you at the time, aforementioned before, you have inhabited a completely alternate universe where you are now Ty leaving your original body behind completely devoid of a soul. Your body will eventually be pronounced to be comatose and everyone will believe you to be in a coma. However, you don’t know this and simply believe finding the magic socks will solve all your problems even if you are stuck five years in the past (along with being trapped in a completely alternate universe you are unaware of).<br />
<br />
You put your shoes back on and open your or more precisely Ty’s bedroom door and start walking through the hallway. It’s a bit disorientating considering your much taller height but you get the hang of it. Luckily Ty’s house is pretty big so you don’t have too much problems getting around. Since you’ve dated Ty for about four years you know his house layout pretty well but since you didn’t start coming to his house until early 2016, you weren’t exactly sure of the environment within his house. You pass his little brother’s room and start heading to the front door. Reaching for the doorknob You were now ready to head into town and stop by the Magic Store and get some new magic socks or maybe another item to take you back to your own time.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me? Where are you going?” A voice bellows out.<br />
<br />
You turn around to see a younger Mrs. Martin or Ty’s mom looking at you with a look of disapproval.<br />
<br />
“Just into town.” You say realizing that the possibility of you going into town were now slim to none.<br />
<br />
“Sorry but you’ve nearly been out all day hanging out with your friends. It’s getting late and you need to finish your homework! So take a shower and get started.” Ty’s Mom says before heading back to kitchen.<br />
<br />
You knew better than to argue and head back upstairs to Ty’s room and enter it to find yourself in a new dilemma. You have to take a shower!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Obviously you always had the choice of not taking one but the aroma emitting from your body, mostly your underarms is making you reconsider. Also you knew Ty’s Mom would be suspicious if you weren’t clean by dinner time. So sighing you grab something resembling a towel hanging over a chair near the gaming desk and head to the bathroom next door.<br />
<br />
You find yourself nearly bumping into a boy leaving the restroom.<br />
<br />
“Watch out Ty!” The boy says and looking down you’re shocked to see Logan so young! Logan was Ty’s younger brother, by two years, so obviously you saw him a lot when you dated Ty at school and at his house. But Logan was a lot more mature looking when you met him, right now you must be looking at him when he was around 12.<br />
<br />
Logan turns away from you and walks away probably heading to his own room. You enter the bathroom and lock the door behind you. Staring in the mirror you see Ty’s adolescent reflection staring back at you. We’re you really about to do this?<br />
<br />
You had no choice in the matter to be honest. Besides one shower wasn’t going to kill you so you  removed Ty’s Baseball hoodie before removing his black shirt underneath. Looking in the mirror you see shirtless Ty still with his lean figure except it seem to be a bit more pudgy. Ty probably lost the few pounds after he became older and grew a few more inches. That doesn’t take your eyes away from looking at your reflection. Ty’s much rounder face with the lack of any stubble but with  a distinct amount of freckles. However, Ty’s boyish looks seem to be a bit more appropriate now. Now he really does look his age.<br />
<br />
Then you realize something… This was Ty! Your boyfriend! And so young… it was kinda adorable. Too bad you had to see him like this when you were currently occupying his body. You take off the muddy shoes that got you into this mess along with the white male ankle socks revealing Ty’s large bare feet. The familiar musky scent emit from the shoes and your feet so you toss the shoes to the side, however, you’re not gonna be able to get rid of the smell from your feet just yet.<br />
<br />
Next up are Ty’s pants. You feel trepidatious as you grab the waistband of the track pants. You’ve never actually seen Ty naked before. Even after dating him for a while. Removing these pants would be a step closer to seeing him in the nude. You take a deep breath and pull the pants down revealing a pair of white briefs on top of two slender pale legs with a slight dusting of orange hair on your ankles.<br />
<br />
You look back in the mirror to see Ty. Now standing only in his underwear. This was definitely much more of Ty that you’ve ever seen. And it was about to get a lot more personal. You tug at the band of the white briefs before pulling them down in a quick motion. It shocks you. Seeing your dick or Ty’s flop out. Along with the small bundle of orange pubes sitting on top of the dick.<br />
<br />
You keep looking at your or Ty’s dick, mesmerized at its appearance. It’s not exactly small but it does look like it. Then your remember how young Ty is and that a boy around 14 should probably have a much smaller penis than an adult man. So the three inches you see is pretty understandable along with your balls. They seemed to be pretty high up especially since you were sure that they were supposed to be hanging much lower. Looks like Ty really is 14 at the moment.<br />
<br />
Looking away from your dick, you look up and see Ty’s naked body with a strange expression of confusion on his face. You shake your head and walk to the shower and step inside before turning on the water. The warm water feels refreshing on your skin and you find your hair much easier to wash now that it was much shorter. You decide to skip over washing your body with a soap bar and rub enough body wash on yourself to remove any lingering smells.<br />
<br />
After making sure you smell acceptable you turn the water off and grab the towel and dry yourself off before heading back to Ty’s room. You enter the messy room you haven’t take much notice of. Ty was never much of a neat freak like you, so the messy array of clothes, video games, textbooks, and wrappers lining up the room aren’t too much of a surprise. You head to Ty’s drawers and grab some pajamas pants and a pair of red brief’s before heading to the closet and pulling out a worn out blue shirt.<br />
<br />
Putting on your new set of clothes you think you chose clothes much like Ty would’ve chosen and toss your dirty laundry into the overflowing laundry basket in your room. Now what should you do?<br />
<br />
You haven’t even been given a second to think before you hear your Mom… no Ty’s mom call you. You shake your head. Maybe you were getting tired? You head downstairs to have dinner with Ty’s family which isn’t too much of a trouble to get through. No one barely mutters a word over the spiel coming from Logan’s mouth. You glance at Ty’s Dad to see him also looking slightly younger. The dinner goes smoothly after all the times you’ve had dinner with Ty, you know his family pretty well, so if you had to stay as Ty you could probably pull it off.<br />
<br />
If? You nearly choke on your water. Where did that thought come from! Obviously you were heading back to that magic shop and turning back to normal tomorrow so why did you think that? You shiver and finish your dinner before heading back to Ty’s room.<br />
<br />
You look out his window and guess it to be around nine. You would probably have to do Ty’s homework now if you wanted to be prepared for tomorrow. Then again it wasn’t too late. Maybe you could still sneak out!</p>
