<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A cursed wooden crate, the curse itself, the sheer immorality of the farm owner and his seductive niece he doomed to be one of his goats too, Ted felt that all they and an it were the reason he felt totally damned. He had never wished to be an animal, as never dreamed of becoming a buck goat, but undeniable were the feelings in the aftermath when his cock slid free from a leathery as slicker the silk a doe goat vagina.<br />
<br />
Sheryl and especially her Uncle seemed quite elated about how large a male goat the curse made of Him. Ted still knew of who he was, what he was, and of what he became, his being a goat did not leave him feeling enthused. When horny Sheryl had got her fill from Ted, she pranced out the crate to greet her Uncle. Although they seemed happy from what she did to Ted, he remained in that dark far corner of the crate.<br />
<br />
The spirit of the curse was almost apologetic as it continued to encircle a nervous Theodore.  <br />
<br />
Ted felt the swirling presence of the spirit curse and by just thinking,  he with his retained thought processes, wanted to ask question that he could not do with the farm owner. He did not think in brash hatred ways when he asked the spirit the questions, but knew the spirit was of a higher power and entity than was he, so Ted tread carefully of what he asked.<br />
<br />
His first question posed was to thank the spirit for allowing him to retain his intelligence after being so changed, but as he was obviously a male goat, could the spirit ever consider changing him back to being his previous human self. <br />
<br />
The spirit though was as harsh as it was to do what it had done to several people since it arrived into that country. It informed Ted that its beginning was a split away from a larger, more encompassing curse. It conveyed to Ted that the original curse could do far more to a person, as had changed a young woman to be a stallion horse, a manly fellow to be a pack-mule, and many native Brazilian workers to be as well Mules. The spirit reiterated seemingly with a sense of pride the transforming of a young couple into being similar to Greek satyrs. As from the loving couple, a man and a woman who it changed, became so aroused, they beckoned the spirit curse to finish changing them into being human-minded, intelligent still, Brazilian Mountain bred goats, and help them to remain being such animals for the rest of their natural, human length of living their lives.<br />
<br />
Then too there was another man who seeing the transforming process of his two friends to being as goats, he mingled with the spirit curse and asked nicely for him to become a buck goat too! <br />
<br />
Ted having heard some of the history about the curse, asked then if because he was reverent to the powerful spirit, would it grant him some physical different attributes but not change him from being a hearty big buck?<br />
<br />
The curse seemed taken and did not respond so quickly, as though it were searching how to answer Ted. As after what to a buck goat seemed a portion of eternity, the spirit replied in the affirmative, it asking nicely of Ted to expound his idea.<br />
<br />
Ted then gave a moment to consider his request, and then asked with a considerate manner, broadcast his thought. Ted asked, if the spirit would for reason of he, Ted to remain sane when living as would a buck goat, could he please be given the ability to speak verbally? As before the spirit offered its answer, Ted added a thought, that being as to his being able to talk, he could coax others so doomed to be as goats to accept what was their permanent future. Then too, of those who came to the farm and might pet the goats, he would listen to what they said, and if someone were to wish to become a goat, he then could talk, as coax them to enter the crate.<br />
<br />
The spirit curse stated it was suspicious of what Ted requested and planned to be of an aid to the intentions of the spiritual grander plan.<br />
<br />
Ted then asked, making mention of the man in Brazil having witnessed the transformations of his friends to being goats according to their asking the spirit, then the spirit reciprocated and changed the friend to being a goat too. As with that consideration the spirit found its way to the United States, as the managing college professor took home the student changed into being a hearty buck goat inside the crate. So of what Ted was asking was to be as much a helper, while easing his personal tribulation from becoming a male goat.<br />
<br />
The spirit curse saw deep into the sincerity of what Ted requested, and decided to grant back to Ted the ability to speak fluently, and gifting him of new knowledge, as he could speak then English, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Mandarin. It also thought to grace Ted with a new ability to being the big buck goat, although the gift caused a momentary pain.<br />
<br />
Ted thanked the spirit with using his gained language ability, as asked why the intense paining of him groin.<br />
<br />
If a spirit curse could laugh, the spirit reiterated to Ted, because of his size, and to be of aid to the purpose of the curse, it granted Ted an expandable penis. Ted could then by a thought cause the girth and length of his goat penis to change mattering upon what he wished to sexually enjoy. <br />
<br />
Really thought Ted, as if I wished to have the penis of a donkey..., as he spoke aloud an &quot;Oh wow,&quot; when his goat penis and the sheath surrounding it swelled and became very similar to the sheath and penis of a mature Jack donkey!    <br />
before she thought to try and coax Ted to go with her and mingle with the goat herd.</p>
