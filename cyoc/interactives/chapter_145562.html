<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Agent Baoman thought about Chief O&#39;Hara&#39;s offer.  Sending in a strike team to get the Gamboni brothers would end things quickly, and they can move on to other duties back home.  The sooner they had the Gambonis, the sooner the Charlestons would be safe.<br />
<br />
However, the Gambonis were a dangerous group, and Vito especially would be paranoid of anything unusual.  The lights going out to give the FBI and the MLPD an advantage would tip Vito off that something was about to happen.  And this would lead to a shooting battle which would lead to casualties, both on the FBI and MLPD, but also any civilians that were nearby.  While Vito wasn&#39;t aware of the FBI&#39;s presence, there was no reason to rush things.<br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate the offer, chief,&quot; Agent Baoman explained to Chief O&#39;Hara, &quot;but I think we&#39;ll put that on hold for now.  As much as I want to pull Vito and Marcus off of the streets, we need to be delicate about this operation.  They don&#39;t know we&#39;re here and that&#39;s there&#39;s a trap waiting for them.  I don&#39;t want to give them any clues about what&#39;s going to happen to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chief O&#39;Hara pursed his lips as he tried to cut off his words.  &quot;Okay,&quot; was all he could manage without revealing the secret of the town.  Chief O&#39;Hara was trying to push things along as the sooner the FBI and the Gambonis left, the safer the secret was.  Yet, it frustrated Chief O&#39;Hara how little he could do to make things happen sooner.  He could only hope that his officers would do everything necessary to protect the secret.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Meanwhile, at the motel, Vito was doing some math while he examined the tally marks on his sheet.  It confirmed one thing to him.  Most of the town&#39;s residents were what he would call unusual.  Young.  Well-built.  The men could be considered football players or linebackers while the women could pass as full-figured models or even cheerleaders.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see the big deal about this,&quot; Marcus said.  &quot;So the people here are good looking and healthy.  That don&#39;t mean something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vito sighed and said, &quot;It could be a complication in our plan.  There&#39;s some sort of secret in this town, and it could hurt us when we try to get Karen and her parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Marcus asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if there&#39;s some deeper secret here?&quot; Vito explained.  &quot;What if that secret could be used against us?&quot;  He paused as he put an arm around his brother.  &quot;Look, Vito knows what he&#39;s doing.  I&#39;m gonna make sure my brother gets what he wants, but I want to do it as safely as we can.  The best case is that we rub out Moe and Nichole, you get your girl, and we move to Mexico where we&#39;ll all live like one big happy family.  I just gotta ask a little patience as your brother does his work.  Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus sighed and said, &quot;All right.  Just keep in mind that your brother&#39;s patience is limited, and he wants to enjoy his girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vito sighed and nodded before turning towards a map of Moon Lake.  There were still a few things bothering him besides the secret.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
Karen walked with Rich and Olivia back to her cabin.  Oliver had already dismissed himself for the night to meet with someone.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for at least listening to me,&quot; Karen said as she approached the back porch.  She stepped on the porch and paused for a moment.  There was one thing she could do to satisfy her own curiosity.  She turned to Rich and asked, &quot;Can I ask one more favor?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rich took a look at Olivia before turning back to Karen.  &quot;Sure, what is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen took a breath before asking, &quot;Can I take a look at your...um...&quot; she found it hard to say the words so she just pointed at Rich&#39;s crotch.  <br />
<br />
Rich looked over at Olivia who gave a rather amused smirk.  Then Rich turned to Karen and said, &quot;I guess so,&quot; before joining Karen on the porch.  He sat in a nearby chair with his legs open to provide Karen access.  Karen knelt down between Rich&#39;s legs to get a good look at his junk.<br />
<br />
The first thing she noticed that his fur was thicker around his sheath and balls.  She guessed this would be the equivalent of pubic hair in fursona form.  Karen took a feel around his ball sack and noted that it was rather large in size.  However, she&#39;d never took a look at different boys, so it was hard for her to make a good comparison.  She then noticed his sheath, and that his penis was starting to move out of it.  She felt the length of the sheath and noticed that it was stiff and inflexible.  She rubbed the sheath and noticed that the fur on it was similar to the fur around the groin.  She watched as the more she rubbed his sheath, more of his penis came out of it.  It wasn&#39;t long before his penis was fully erect out of its sheath and Karen studied it closely.  She noticed that were spines all along the shaft, and many of them were near the base.  Other than that, the penis was actually similar to human in nature.  Karen gently felt along the shaft, being careful not to prick herself on the spines.  She reached the head of his penis and rubbed it a little bit.  This caused a groan to come out of Rich.<br />
<br />
Olivia, for her part, just sat back and watched as Karen examined her boyfriend.  There was something erotic about watching Karen examine Rich so closely.  Her paw went to her breast, and she could feel her nipple sticking out of the fur.<br />
<br />
Karen started to rub the head of Rich&#39;s penis, and each time she did so, he gave out some sort of moan or growl.  Karen marveled at how big and thick Rich&#39;s penis was as she could feel the shafts that maintained his erection.  Karen then noticed a clear liquid coming out of the tip and she had this crazy idea.  It was something she heard her friends say that they did to their boyfriends when they wanted to get frisky.  Karen put her mouth to the top of Rich&#39;s penis and used her tongue to lick the clear liquid.  It tasted both salty and sweet to her, and she licked every drop that was coming out.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Karen, what are you...&quot; Rich started to say before the waves of pleasure washed over him.  The only thing he could say was, &quot;Oh, Karen...&quot; as Karen used her tongue to move around the head of Rich&#39;s cock.  Olivia, for her part, was moaning a bit as well.  She was completely turned on by what she was watching, and one of her hands moved down to her crotch as she started to rub herself.<br />
<br />
Karen was encouraged by the moans Rich was giving and she increased her pace a little.  She could only get an inch or two of his shaft, but her tongue made all the difference.  With each bob of Karen&#39;s head, Rich could feel the pleasure and pressure growing bit by bit.  It wasn&#39;t long before he felt the familiar tingling in his balls and penis.  &quot;Karen...&quot; he said through the pleasure, &quot;You need to stop now.&quot;  But she continued as the pressure grew.  &quot;Karen...stop now...&quot; he said.  &quot;Karen!&quot; he called out as he went past the point of no return.  He managed to push Karen away a bit before his penis started to throb and shoot its semen.  Rich was able to push her off in time so that the semen didn&#39;t go into her mouth, but the angle was such that it ended up going all over her neck and chest.  Some of his semen ended up on her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; she said as she examined the milky white sticky substance on her fingers.  &quot;That&#39;s a first.  Never made a guy cum before.  Guess I got a little carried away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re lucky,&quot; Olivia said, coming down from her own orgasm and standing up, &quot;If that went into your mouth, you&#39;d be growing fur right now.&quot;  She tried to get a sniff from Karen, but Rich&#39;s scent was too strong on her to see if she was about to become a weretigress or if she was still normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Karen said she gave a small giggle herself.  &quot;It&#39;s just, well, I never had much experience with guys, much less were guys, and it was hard to tell when to stop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rich sighed and put a paw on Karen&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Hey, everyone here had a good time, and no one got hurt.  No harm no foul, right?  And besides, I can get being curious.  I was too at one point before I met Olivia.&quot;  He knelt down and whispered into Karen&#39;s ear, &quot;Besides, you give great head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen&#39;s face turned red when she heard that.  She then said, &quot;I suppose I should go back inside before my folks start to notice I&#39;m missing.&quot;  She made for the door, but turned around and said, &quot;Thanks for everything.  It&#39;s been helpful to me.&quot;  She waved goodbye to Rich and Olivia before going inside.<br />
<br />
Once inside, she made her way to the bathroom.  She took off her shirt which had taken the most part of Rich&#39;s cum.  She also wiped her neck and hands down.  She looked to see if there were any changes, and she didn&#39;t see anything.  She then took a look at herself in the mirror.  She giggled and said to herself, &quot;That was fun.&quot;  She then got herself ready for bed and put herself to sleep for the night.<br />
<br />
Unknown to Karen and everyone else at that time, when she took in Rich&#39;s pre-cum, she exposed herself to a very small amount of the werevirus that was in the pre-cum.  While it was tiny compared to Rich&#39;s semen, it could have a possibility of affecting her, even causing her to become a weretigress.  And when Rich&#39;s semen got all over Karen, it has a higher load of the werevirus.  It might be possible that some of the werevirus was absorbed through Karen&#39;s skin, but not much.<br />
<br />
How much did the werevirus affect Karen?  Is Karen going to become a weretigress now?  These answers are left up to the future authors.<br />
