<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My alarm woke me at 6.15 and I knew I had to hurry to get to the Pilates class. I did my business then changed from my chemise into the gym clothes I had washed last week. I ate a small bowl of muesli then headed off to the gym. I walked into the class but didn&#39;t see Sarah. Alecia waved to me so I walked across to her and said hello. She had her baby with her. Young Zach was asleep in a pram. Alecia said her husband did fly-in fly out work and was away this weekend.<br />
<br />
By the time I had put down my bag and taken off my shoes and socks Sarah and Annabelle had joined us.  Most of the class was the same as last week but Trudy threw in a few new exercises. One involved doing the splits as far as was comfortable. For me that was all the way. This body was really flexible. Most of the other woman got nowhere near flat.<br />
<br />
When the class was finished I joined Sarah, Annabelle and Alecia and we strolled down to the nursery come coffee shop, Alecia pushing young sleeping Zach in his pram. The rain from yesterday had cleared and the sun was shining. We ordered drinks and sat down in the same seats as last week.  Alecia was telling me of her husband Rick and his job when Zach woke up. Alecia changed his nappy then gave him to me for a cuddle. He seemed so tiny. However he was big enough to know what breasts were for and was very interested in mine.<br />
Alecia was breastfeeding when the coffees arrived. She wasn&#39;t the least bit shy about revealing her nipples but I suppose we were all females in the vicinity. When Zach was satisfied Alicia handed him back to me while she visited the toilet. Zach had a bit of vomit on my top. I tried to wipe it off with a serviette, but I suppose that&#39;s what you get when you cuddle babies.<br />
<br />
Sarah asked &quot;What are you planning to wear to the party tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t really thought about it yet&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that green dress with the beading could do with another outing. Not that you wouldn&#39;t look good in a hessian sack&quot;<br />
<br />
We finished our coffees and walked back to the gym carpark. I was beginning to like Alecia. She was a new Mum who had moved to town to be near her in-laws because of her husband’s frequent absences. She seemed quite lonely and needed friends. When we got back to our cars we all said farewell. Sarah suggested I come around to her place at around 11 tomorrow.<br />
..........<br />
Once home I decided to have a run again. I briefly told Mum what I was doing then set off on my usual jog. Everything was going fine until I was on the run home. A male jogger came towards me but stopped 50 meters before we met. I passed him by and he started running after me. Everything was fine until I turned into another street, heading towards home. I could still hear him running 20 meters behind me. I began to feel a bit scared. I turned at the next street and he continued to follow me. Now I was starting to get the creeps. I accelerated and ran towards a shop I could see in the distance. He dropped back and but continued on the same route. I stopped at the shop and ran inside. I was breathing heavily. I watched through the window. He ran past and continued down the street. <br />
<br />
A man said &quot;Can I help you Miss?&quot; I hadn&#39;t even paid attention to what sort of shop I was in. It looked like men’s barbers.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I thought I was being followed&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Who? Stay here&quot; He went to the door and looked outside.  &quot;There is a jogger 100 meters down the road. Continuing away from here. Is that him?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes a jogger&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want me to call the police?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I just got scared. He followed me around 2 corners. Maybe it was just a coincidence&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Take a seat and I will give you a drink&quot; He went to a back room and returned with a glass of water. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks. I feel like a fool he was probably completely innocent&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better safe than sorry. Would you like me to call someone to pick you up?&quot;<br />
<br />
I finished the glass of water. I felt much calmer &quot;If he is no longer in sight I will just run home. Could you have another look?&quot;<br />
<br />
He went outside &quot;All clear&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks so much&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure&quot;<br />
<br />
I ran back the way I had come. Back to the street that led home. There was no sign of the other jogger.<br />
..........<br />
Back home I went to the kitchen and made myself a cup of tea. Mum had left a note on the bench saying she had gone shopping. Dad must be out in his shed. I sat there contemplating what had just happened. I hadn&#39;t felt safe. I enjoyed jogging and wanted to get this body fit. Was I just imagining things or was he really following me? I thought back to when I was male. Would I have followed a pretty girl jogging? Probably. I would not have changed my route to follow a girl though. But then had he actually changed his route. I would not know. I resolved that I would be careful jogging in future. Definitely no jogging at night, as I had occasionally done as Zach. Maybe I should also choose a route where more people were around?<br />
<br />
I finished my tea and thought it was time to do my washing.  I went to my room and took off the gear I was wearing changing into jeans, a fresh bra and a white t-shirt. I collected the basket of dirty clothes and put a load into the machine. I contemplated having a shower but decided I would save that for later in the day before going to the party. <br />
<br />
Maybe I could give my car a wash? The house had a double carport which Mum and Dad used. I had parked on a paved area to the side of the driveway. I checked the carport and found some car shampoo and some old towels and a bucket. I filled the bucket added some shampoo and started on the front of my car using a wet towel to rub away the dirt. I then used a slow running hose to wash the wash the grime off. I moved around the car doing all four sides then the bonnet and finally the roof. I was a bit shorter than when I was Zach so had a bit if trouble reaching the middle of the roof. I ended up getting wet as I had to lean against the already wet car. I was more than wet I was soaked. I could understand why Jenna might choose to wear bathers while doing this. <br />
<br />
I was just finishing giving the whole car a final squirt when I heard Chrissie calling me. &quot;Hi Jenna&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Chrissie how are you&quot; I walked over to the hedge fence, letting the hose run on the garden.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m good. I&#39;m helping Daddy garden&quot;<br />
<br />
I hadn&#39;t noticed Tony. He was pruning some rose bushes in the corner of the yard. I waved to him &quot;Hi Tony&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Jenna&quot; He looked a bit sheepish.<br />
<br />
I turned to Chrissie &quot;I hope you are being very careful with those roses. They have nasty thorns&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am very careful. I getting some flowers for Mummy&quot; She pointed to some flowers in a bucket. &quot;I can see your titties. One day I&#39;m going to grow titties. I&#39;m going to be pretty like you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm&quot; I looked down at my chest. My white t shirt was soaked. Indeed I was having a wet T-shirt moment. I glanced at Tony he was slyly looking at me. No doubt he had got a good view. &quot;Bye Chrissie I need to go. See you around&quot;<br />
<br />
I hurried away from the fence grabbed my washing gear and retreated to the garage turning the tap off. How embarrassing. I had made another rookie girl mistake.<br />
.........<br />
Back inside I went straight to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. I could clearly see my nipples through my soaked t-shirt and lacy white bra. I peeled of my wet clothes and turned the shower on. I jumped in and had a warm shower washing my hair. I had to admit to myself the idea of showing off these breasts to Tony was actually a bit of a turn on.<br />
<br />
I finished the shower wrapped a towel around myself and dried my hair using the diffuser.<br />
<br />
I then went to my room and redressed, this time wearing the sundress I had got sunburnt in a fortnight ago. I picked up my wet clothes and went to the laundry, unloaded my finished washing load into a basket and threw the rest of the washing into the machine and set another load. I then went out and hung the 1st load on the line. <br />
<br />
While I was hanging the clothes Dad stuck his head out of the shed and asked if Mum was back yet. I told him not yet. He asked if I could let him know when she was.<br />
<br />
I returned to my room and searched for the green beaded dress Sarah had mentioned. I found a dark green dress with black lacy shoulders and skirt fringe. It had black beads in flower shapes attached to the material of the dress itself. I assumed this was the dress Sarah meant.<br />
<br />
I decided to try it on. I liked it. The material felt silky. It was flashy but didn’t make me look like a tart. I matched it with some black heels. I took it off again satisfied that I had my outfit for tonight.<br />
<br />
I then attempted to redo my fingernails. I say attempted as I couldn&#39;t get them looking shiny and smooth like Angie had. I guess I should have taken the old polish off first rather than just paint over the top. However they would have to do.<br />
<br />
I had just put my 2nd load of washing in a basket when Mum came home. She said she had met up with Sarah while shopping. I went and put my washing on the line and told Dad that Mum was back. It was 1 pm so we all had toasted sandwiches for lunch. <br />
I settled in the couch after lunch and watched a Jane Austin movie on Netflix. Mum was doing something with her sewing machine and Dad mowed the lawn.<br />
<br />
After the movie had finished I lay on my bed and read a couple more chapters of my book. Two months had passed and Charlotte finally spotted the pirate ship returning to harbor. But alas the Captain had not returned from a shore raid in Wales. It was assumed he was dead. The 1st mate known as ‘Pierre le noir’ had assumed the role of Captain and took over control of the pirate band including the fortress. Charlotte only then realized the housekeeper was Pierre’s mother. She found herself moved to the guest wing and her former maid Jane moved into the lord’s chambers along with Pierre. When she tried to take her wardrobe and dowry box to her new room. She found her way barred. If Jane was to be the new lady of the manor she would need to be suitably attired. Charlotte found that she and Jane had effectively traded places. She was spared kitchen duties but was given a sewing kit and made to take out her fancy ladies clothing so it would fit her more rotund new mistress. She was now just a ladies companion.<br />
 <br />
As the months passed and Pierre went off raiding again her position deteriorated. As the few nice dresses she had managed to keep, wore out they were replaced by a maid’s uniform including a bonnet she was forced to wear. She was no longer invited to eat with Jane or ‘Jehanne’, as she now wished to be called, but made to take her meals in the servant’s quarters. On Sundays she was forced to attend the local papist church and sit in the rear pews with the other servants while Lady Jehanne and  her former housekeeper now to be addressed as &#39;Madame&#39;, sat in the front seats. Her duties now extended past brushing Jehanne’s hair to making beds and serving dinner. She tried to escape but was caught and reinstated, however she found her few belongings had been moved to a small room in the servant’s quarters. She was not paid and was essentially a slave. <br />
<br />
Pierre returned from his latest voyage with new wealth and Jehanne was treated to the latest Paris fashions. However Charlotte shared none of this good fortune. Pierre stumbled in on her once while she was making his bed and brutally raped her. She tried to complain to Jehanne but was told in no uncertain terms that as a servant she was to submit to her masters wishes. Her downfall was complete.<br />
<br />
I was really into the book by now and found it hard to put down but it was 5.00 and I needed to get ready for the party. I went outside and collected my washing from the line, quickly sorting it out and putting it away. I then dressed and put on my makeup. I thought I looked good but couldn’t decide which earrings to wear. I settled for some dangly gold ones. <br />
<br />
Jenna had a small green handbag with a chain which I thought matched the dress nicely. I transferred what I thought I would need for the night into the bag. I was ready.<br />
<br />
It was 6.15 so I wandered down to the kitchen and spoke to Mum. I asked her what had she been sowing earlier and she replied “Just making a few repairs” I supposed I probably should learn to sow myself. It was something I had never done.</p>
