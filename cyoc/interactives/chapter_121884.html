<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan was freaking out! How was he looking down at his own body? Foam leaking out of his mouth, his eyes rolled back into his head.  He recoiled backwards, running into some student’s and desks before he fell on his butt.  School staff was rushing into the classroom now, attempting to remove the students from the room and revive his seemingly lifeless body. Ms. Smith from across the hall approached Ryan, still sitting on the floor, “Jake, are you alright, honey?” she asked with a thinly masked panic in her voice, “look at me honey, not at Mr. Morris, come on lets get out of here.” <br />
<br />
Ryan was trying to get out an explanation of what had happened, but couldn’t form the words.  “The blue juice” he stammered, “my body, why did it happen?” Ms. Smith rushed him down the hallway into the cafeteria with the rest of the students.  “I’m Ryan Morris” he finally said with enough force to get her attention. Ms. Smith looked down at him with concern and sympathy. “Ohh dear,” she said, “you have been badly shaken. Sit down here and we’ll call your parents.”  Ms. Smith sat Ryan down at a table by himself, “sit here and relax, honey” she ordered.  <br />
<br />
As soon as Ms. Smith left Ryan got up and went to the bathroom.  He felt like he was going to puke. He made it to the sink and threw up.  When he pulled his head up from the sink and looked in the mirror he saw the smug face of Jake, an arrogant jock and bully, looking back at him.  Jake was 13 years old, he stood 5’6” tall and had a lean muscular frame that allowed him to excel at sports.  He had dark brown hair with piecing blue eyes that allowed him to excel with the ladies.  Ryan opened his mouth, the reflection in the mirror did the same, he raised his left hand and the mirror copied.  Ryan was at a loss for an explanation.  He had to get back to the liquor store and find out what was in that flask.  <br />
<br />
Ryan slipped out the restroom and the cafeteria taking up a quick jog towards the strip mall.  Ryan could feel the raw power in Jake’s muscles, the energy that his young body possessed. In his own body Ryan would have been exhausted by now.  After 20 minutes at a quick clip, Ryan was at the store, the old clerk sitting lazily at the counter.  Ryan stormed in and the clerk smiled. “So you drank it?” he said amused, “and you survived.”  Ryan was taken aback. “You, you?” he stuttered.  “Yes I know its you” the clerk said, “you regretted you mistakes you wanted a fresh start, so I gave you one.”  Ryan was speechless. “Your essence is now detached from your physical form” the clerk continued, “it will take some practice but you will be able to switch forms at will. Just make sure you’re not out of a body for too long or you will fade away.”  Ryan was still speechless, when a police officer entered the store. The clerk waived him over, “I believe this boy is lost.” The Police officer had just received a report about a student missing from the school and collected Ryan and returned him to the Junior High.<br />
<br />
Ryan got a polite talking too about leaving the school and going to a liquor store, but it was chalked up to the extraordinary circumstances of the day.  Jake’s mother arrived at the school to take him home for the day.  All the while Ryan had remained silent. Thinking about the old clerks words.  As Jake’s mother escorted who she thought was her son out of the school, he turned and asked “How is, umm, Mr. Morris?” he asked, “is he alive?”  The principal thought for a moment and then answered, “He’s alive but in a coma.”<br />
<br />
Jake’s mother talked a lot on the car ride home. The woman seemed to like the sound of her own voice.  Pretty typical stuff about not worrying, and everything will be ok, and blah blah blah. Ryan was actually impressed that she never once asked her son how he was feeling or what he was thinking.  The arrived at a nice home in a nice neighborhood, parked in the garage and entered the house. <br />
<br />
Ryan entered the strange home, it was well decorated with lots of nice furniture, it smelt strongly of vanilla.  Jake’s mother came in right behind him. “Go upstairs and shower off,” she ordered, “who knows what that pervert had, I don’t want you to get it.” Ryan looked at her with hate in his eyes, he was going to defend himself, but the woman pointed and said “Go!”  Ryan was still processing everything that had happened to him in the last hour, maybe some alone time would be good.  Ryan went up the stairs and peaked into an office and what appeared to be a girls bedroom before finding one that appeared to be his.  Ryan found some clothes in the dresser and went into the bathroom directly off his room. <br />
<br />
Ryan stripped down examining Jake’s body in the mirror.   Jake had the starts of a nice six pack, years of swimming had given him broad powerful shoulders, connected to arms with biceps and triceps that were coming along nicely.  Ryan’s old body was bigger, but Jake’s was probably just as strong and much more nimble.  Ryan paused but then continued and pulled down Jake’s shorts and underwear.  He didn’t want to be a pervert, like they all said he was, but this was his body for now.  Jake had the beginnings of an impressive penis.  Ryan’s old one topped at 3” hard and depending on how cold it was out stood at between 1 and 3” soft.  He didn’t grow but he wasn’t showing much.  Jake’s was closer to 4 soft and stiffened up to a little better than 6” without very much encouragement.  <br />
<br />
Ryan got in the shower and stood there letting the water wash over him.  The store clerk wasn’t wrong. He had spent so much of his time lately counting up all the mistakes he’d made over the years, and now he had a fresh start.  Furthermore, if what the man said was right, he could have as many fresh starts as he wanted.  Ryan didn’t have any family to speak of, he was an only child and his parents had passed.  He had some cousins that he wasn’t close to at all. What really was he holding onto his old life for.  Ryan reached down and started playing with his new cock.  It already had a pretty thick mane of pubes around it. Jake was a lucky boy, Ryan might enjoy being Jake.</p>
