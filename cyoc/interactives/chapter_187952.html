<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You and Rachel spend the rest of the morning in various positions. You get better as you go keeping Rachel on the edge as you try to get closer to your own orgasm. Beginner&#39;s luck becomes a cycle of building Rachel to orgasm, then having to wait 15 to 20 minute before starting again. You lose count, but you know Rachel has come every time, while your falling behind. The clock in the hotel room shows it&#39;s 12:47pm, and Rachel puts her hand up meekly after you feel her cock shrink from you yet again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle. No brains left.,&quot; she says tiredly, and falls back onto the bed.<br />
<br />
You sit up on your knees, straddling Rachel, but looking at her feet and facing the foot of the bed. Disappointing you slowly dismount the saddle you made for yourself from Rachel&#39;s thighs and slowly walk into the shower. You turn on the warm water and stand under the water as you wash off the morning&#39;s smell of sex and rinse off the red two piece swimsuit you continue to wear. You were not tired and want Rachel to fill you right now. You smile as you think back to the experimentation with positions, being on top, and learning to control the muscles inside your pussy. Your hair is longer, and the little hotel shampoo bottle might last for one more washing. The shelf is higher now, rather, your shorter. It makes sense now, you felt Rachel&#39;s cock grow bigger, but it was you shrinking smaller. &quot;I always wanted to fuck Rachel&#39;s brains out,&quot; you thought to yourself. This new body has a learning curve. You had a full understanding of why Rachel was frustrated when you came first. Now you feel bad, because you know you can do more to get yourself off. You managed to get your own orgasm each time after you figured how to keep Rachel on the edge while you got yourself off first. You regret wasting those earlier opportunities, but not enough to say anything  about it. Thinking about it, you sink down to your knees on the shower floor and start to finger yourself and work your nipple while staying under the shower spray. You close your eyes and think about suckling Rachel&#39;s cock as you feel your throbbing between your legs grow inside you, just at the end of where your fingers can reach. You feel it grow and throb through your body, as you keep at it, and a stronger second wave overtakes you, but you keep going, and it&#39;s the third wave that crashes through your body as you stiffen and tremble in orgasm, then slowly leaning against the wall of the shower, keeping your fingers frozen inside your pussy. You let out a slow, labored moan. You like this. No, you love this. You spend the next three hours in the shower working to get that big, crashing orgasmic wave, before savoring the moment, and working on the next.<br />
<br />
Rachel turns off the water, causing you to open your eyes. She sees your fingers are still buried in your slit, and smiles. &quot;Damn, you are such a fucking slut,&quot; she says proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking addicted,&quot; you reply, with a raspy, timid voice, yet proud and firm in your delivery.<br />
<br />
Rachel turns the water back on, &quot;It&#39;s almost time for supper. I have enjoyed our day.&quot; You sit up on your knees and reach to grab Rachel&#39;s semi-rigid cock. Rachel sighs and pushes your hands away. &quot;I need to eat. You can suck me off under the table if you want. But first, you need to get cleaned up.&quot; Rachel pats the top of your head, &quot;I too have felt that hunger between your legs. I will do my best to keep you full.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your eyes look up at Rachel, and let your hands drop down to the floor where you lean forward to stand up. You face Rachel, standing belly to belly, and your mouth just reaches her nipples. You pucker your lips, and kiss both of Rachel&#39;s nipples, then smile as you look up into her face.<br />
<br />
Rachel looks jealous, &quot;I had to kneel down some to let you do that.&quot; Rachel groans for a moment, &quot;Just for that, I want to keep this cock for a while. How did it feel not getting your own orgasm as I got mine?&quot;<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t take the bait, and smiled as you simply said, &quot;I managed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel shook her head, &quot;Your either lying or just fucking with me. It doesn&#39;t matter. You make a great little cock slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
You did not object to this, as you rather liked your new position, on top and rather proud that you know how to keep Rachel on edge.<br />
<br />
After the shower, Rachel dried off and went into the room. You used Rachel&#39;s hair brush on your newly flowing blond locks. Gazing into the mirror, you did not notice any other changes...apart from your now smaller body. Your focus was clearly on Rachel&#39;s cock. It was hard to think of anything else, and you did not know if this was a problem. Then, the bottom of your suit felt a bit tighter, and smiled, you loved your girlfriend&#39;s cock. A good cock whore like yourself knows how to take care of a wonderful tool like Rachel&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Rachel came back into the bathroom, dressed in a green crop top and what appeared to be a matching color men&#39;s speedo brief, showing the clear outlines of her cock bulge. Rachel look at your reflection in the mirror and holds up a rather large egg looking vibrator. Rachel smiles, &quot;This was a bit smaller in my luggage when we got here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile, &quot;I know where this goes,&quot; you declare. Then you take the egg vibrator and then proceed to slide it into your still slick pussy. You push slowly, but it&#39;s just a bit of time before you relax and let the egg slide in. It is as if a fog is clearing in your head and now Rachel&#39;s cock is no longer the subject of every thought in your head.<br />
<br />
Rachel sighs, &quot;Ok...not what I meant, but ok. Ummm. Ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
You interrupt, &quot;True...quite alright that is on me. Just so you know...until I did that....all I could think of was your cock. I was stuck in Cock Slut mode. Really stuck, so thank you. Just don&#39;t lose that remote.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel laughs, &quot;Not a chance. Besides....hearing you just say cock slut mode....I like what I hear.&quot;<br />
<br />
You roll your eyes and pass the hair brush over to Rachel. You step into the shower one last time to rinse the bottom part of your swimsuit and the vaginal juices you seem to have a hard time controlling. As you step out of the shower, toweling off, Rachel looks over to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you constantly wet?&quot; she asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Funny thing about that....as long as my pussy is neatly tucked and mounded inside this thong bottom, I am perfectly fine. I just have a massive camel-toe for the world to see. It&#39;s only when I slide it off, that it&#39;s a fountain,&quot; you observe.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would explain the bed,&quot; noted Rachel thoughtfully and continues, &quot;Yet your so tiny now....where does it all come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a good question. On a good day I could not have a full orgasm with a full load after a short recharge maybe a dozen orgasms. I milked 28 out of you in under twelve hours,&quot; you respond. &quot;And...until I slid that egg in...I was going to milk you again before we left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have that urge now?&quot; asked Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do have the urge now, but I feel in control of it. Thinking back now, I think that moment I first sank onto your cock....I had a one track mind,&quot; you admit, realizing yourself for the first time. Changing the subject, you point into the mirror, &quot;Nice speedo by the way. Green is good on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel smiles, &quot;I think so. The speedo is the only swimsuit bottom that didn&#39;t leave my cock poking out. That made my choice easy tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile with a grin from ear to ear, &quot;Sounds like a trip to the store in the morning for us.&quot; Rachel nods in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;You only have to nurse from my cock, but I need food. Shall we?&quot; Rachel said impatiently as she motioned to the main door of the hotel room.<br />
<br />
The boardwalk was busy, as it was prime time for dinner hours at the restaurants. Rachel&#39;s favorite seafood place had a nearly hour wait. She signed up on the list, and we headed back out to wait until the pager went off. The sun was setting, so the ocean off in the east was getting dark fast. You take Rachel&#39;s hand and walk down to the beach to enjoy sunset in the ocean surf. Soon, your both standing chest deep as the waves wash past you both.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Rachel jumps forward and turns to you, &quot;Hey, what are you doing?&quot; She then reaches behind her under the water.<br />
<br />
You respond with raising both of your hands out of the water, &quot;Hey yourself.  Probably a fish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel jumped again several more times, turning around frantically as if trying to catch something, and was about to scream when her face turned from shock and confusion to peace and calm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did it stop?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Rachel reaches out and leads the two of you to shallower water, just about thigh deep. Between waves passing buy, you see in the twilight that her tanned legs have split into four, and have suckers down each length. She raises one of her tentacle legs to your waist and asks, &quot;Did you do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I have not fantasized about fucking you as a half octopus,&quot; you reply.<br />
<br />
Rachel slumps her head down between her shoulders, &quot;Then this is on me. In giving up control, I did ask that our relationship not be boring, and have a rather kinky aspect. I&#39;m the one who&#39;s had fantasies about screwing a half octopus version of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If this helps, I am open to this,&quot; you say to reassure Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good, because, I...guess there will be surprises.....,&quot; Rachel says reluctantly...before pausing and feeling her green crop top change to now cover her arms down to her wrists, and up around her neck. Rachel then smiles, and looks at you, &quot;Yes, it feels good to be comfortable with who I am.&quot; Rachel swims around you for a few minutes to get the feel of her new legs when the restaurant pager goes off around her neck. You follow behind Rachel as she walks out of the water and onto the boardwalk with her tentacle legs, four each where her human legs once were, with the green speedo still there, covering her butt and bulge. Rachel gives the pager to the waitress, who leads us to a table in the pool. There are several other tables, all occupied, in the pool. Some people are standing, some are sitting in chairs.<br />
<br />
After you both give the waitress your drink order and have a chance to look over the menus,  you smile and chide, &quot;I see why this is your favorite restaurant. I suggest the calamari for an appetizer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel extends one tentacle leg to firmly press into your puffy cameltoe. &quot;Yes on the calamari,  you know it&#39;s my favorite, and I know I deserved that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey...be careful with your little friend here. I slide this over....and he&#39;s inside.&quot; you threaten playfully.<br />
<br />
Rachel feels her speedo tighten and her speedo melds into her lower body, and becomes more octopus. Her cock disappears into her now green octopus skinned waist, while the tentacle pocking between your legs becomes her cock. &quot;Perhaps if you knew more about mollusks, you would appreciate that your threat would not be wise....for you,&quot; warns Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s eat the food they fix here first. Your right...it would not be wise to tempt those things I cannot control or fully understand win a crowded pool with all these people around,&quot; you admit.<br />
<br />
After the cease fire was agreed to, you and Rachel continue your dinner as normal.</p>
