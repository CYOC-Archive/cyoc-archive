<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had taken roughly a week to remove and reorganize all of the “stock” for the shop since there was some considerations involved. However, Selicia felt confident that she could open the storefront the following morning. All that she had left to do was select who would be the keeper or… Keepers… She wanted someone she could generally “trust” to handle the job… Marina was not an option as she had to tend to Selicia, more… Immediately… Debbie wasn’t an option either considering that would ruin their arrangement… The only options left were Lisa, her combined maid, and Sofia, that small maid puttering around. Considering their weaknesses; Lisa’s inability to speak at a normal pace or quickly emote and Sofia’s seeming shyness. They might as well be a pair and work together, something for the two of them to handle while keeping them busy.<br />
<br />
Selicia called for the pair of maids, both of which were quick to answer their summons. Once the two women were positioned before her, Selicia addressed them purposefully. “The two of you, will be given the task of managing the storefront… Effective tomorrow~” Selicia gave the pair a sly grin to see how they would react. Sofia, predictably, shrunk back but, did not refuse. Lisa, on the other hand, nodded resolutely only once. “I’ll leave it to the two of you to figure out your arrangements out there… See that they are effective, yes?” The pair nodded together although one more meekly than the other.<br />
<br />
The following day, the storefront’s front door was unlocked and ready for the curious or bold to come in. Selicia unlocked the door herself as it was the “Grand Opening.” A spell was set on the door to evoke the curiosity anyone passing may have in a token effort to gain traffic. This spell wouldn’t draw in just any passerby, only those already feeling a tinge of curiosity. She left the shop in the hands of Lisa and Sofia as she returned to the manor proper.<br />
<br />
Sofia had practically begged Lisa to take the duty as the floor personnel. It wasn’t necessary to beg at all however as Lisa was more than content to so as her mistress had bidden her. Sofia managed the rear of the storefront only coming out to assist when Lisa was troubled further than her short bursts would allow. Some customers, of the few so far, were too fast spoken either from shyness or frustration for Lisa to keep up in writing. Sofia may have been easily overwhelmed in those situations herself but, Lisa’s steady gaze kept escalation to a minimum. The two of them were certainly a dysfunctional pair but, they were making do easy enough with the slow foot traffic.<br />
<br />
So, on it went for the first three days since the opening of the storefront. Slow during the majority of the day but, the pair were fine with the volume of customers or browsers. A few purchases were made each day and no returns as of yet. It wasn’t that the Mistress needed the money, this was just downsizing her collection and profiting from it. With that in mind, at least for Sofia, it was a calm and easy atmosphere to work in. That was until the middle of the fourth day.<br />
<br />
The young woman came in, she was dressed in older clothes, a baggy t-shirt and a pair of sweat pants. Her red hair was an unkempt mess and her brown eyes seemed like she hadn’t slept in days. She was only a slight bit taller than Sofia making her short enough to disappear behind shelves. Around the floor she went once already as she looked at the various wares displayed. Even looking thoroughly exhausted, her eyes carried a look about them seeming to say that she was anything but… So, Lisa kept an eye on the young woman while she could and perform her duties appropriately.<br />
<br />

<br />
Layla’s Perspective:<br />
<br />
Layla had been passing down the street when she saw that weird shop had finally opened. It had a giant maid window display that just seemed so… tacky… Yet, as she passed the front of the place, she couldn’t take her eyes off of it. It was almost like… It was staring back at her… Shortly after the thought occurred to her, Layla realized she was already opening the front door. I guess I’ve got nothing better to do today, Layla thought to herself and stepped through. The contents of the place hit her like a flashbang! Sure, there was the obvious maid standing at the counter, did she even blink? Even more jarring was the toy that sat just in front of a sign on the counter in front of her.<br />
<br />
The toy was in the shape of a small see-through girl left completely naked! Thing didn’t have any arms or legs like a doll would but, it had a big clit at its base topping off a real looking pussy! There was another toy just inside of it that she couldn’t really make out but, that one was making the one wrapped around it glow all sorts of colors. Damn, the one on the outside was real detailed too, must be real expensive… Finally, Layla noticed the words on the sign just behind the toy she was staring at. “Early Bird Specials! First Come, First Served!” is what it said.<br />
<br />
Maybe she might find something interesting in here after all~ Seemed the rest of the shop pretty much followed suit with the theme set by the first toy. A whole slew of sexy looking knick-knacks, paintings, figurines, and all that. Whoever ran this place was either one of those artsy types or a giant perv. It was always hard to tell with those types anyway. Just as Layla finished that thought, she caught the view of the inner side of that maid in the windows… Yep, definitely a giant perv…<br />
<br />
The maid wasn’t wearing anything at all on this side of the thing. It looked like it was having a good time though, riding a dildo, clamp on one nipple, little pill on the other, and drooling on a ball strapped to her face… Phew… That’s definitely an eye catcher alright, now wonder it was on this side… Layla glanced back at the counter and noticed the maid glancing her way. Shit, I haven’t even done anything yet, Layla grumbled softly as she turned out of sight. Once behind the shelf, she took a moment to appraise some of the figurines on the top of it. Just as detailed and even more lifelike than the toy up front. One really caught her eye because it was sitting by itself in a bright yellow bunny suit.<br />
<br />
This figurine looked a bit pale like someone who rarely got any sunlight. It smiled cheerfully with a hand raised in the air and a leg kicked up and back. Its tiny nipples just peeking out from its outfit but, not its pussy. That was on full display with even the rod holding it on the stand plunged inside. The bottom of its suit had been pulled aside to sit it on and it even shined wetly. Overall, the thing screamed “Have a kinky Easter!” to Layla. Sadly though, there was a sign at its base stating “Not for Sale” …<br />
<br />
On a pedestal in the farthest end of the storefront was a closed book. The cover read “The Anatomy of a Naughty Teacher” below that was a picture of a brunette girl laying spread eagle. She had her legs pulled up behind her arms and her hands were spreading her pussy open for all to see. Flipping open the book to a few pages showed it sort of read like a text book except it was the same girl in all sorts of lewd poses. One picture in there was just a zoomed in photo of her crotch like someone stuck the camera to it. Weird stuff, weird stuff…<br />
<br />
Next thing that Layla had come across was like a bargain bin for dildos. All sorts of shapes, sizes, and colors all just shoved into a wooden box. There was another of right next to it but, that one had a different sort of shapes and sizes. These ones all looked like little women just standing stock still. They even ran a spread of sizes, shapes, and skin colors with no two alike. Something like these were bound to be unique and expensive for sure… Licking her lips, Layla looked around the shelf and saw that the made was distracted with someone right now.<br />
<br />
Layla picked out one that was just shorter than she was wide and lifted it under her shirt. A few adjustments and the dildo was resting just under her breasts in her bra. Sure, now her breasts were just a little more perky but, surely that maid wasn’t going to notice that little of a detail, right? Even if she did, what’s she going to do? Demand that Layla take her top off? Pssh, yeah right. This trick had worked more than a few times in other shops, granted the candy bars were a little melty…<br />
<br />
Standing up from her checking out the boxes of dildos, Layla walked back toward the front passing other stuff on shelves. All of the things Layla passed were along the same theme. Either totally a sex toy or a normal thing made all sexy. Almost all of them were really crazy detailed like those dildos. One of those was a statuette that had four identical copies of the same models stacked top one another, except each one bore a different pose… The only thing she’d seen in this place that had anything like it and it was itself…<br />
<br />
The last shelf Layla passed on her way back up to the front had a large number or lesser detailed toys… Not that they were very nondescript, but they looked pretty bulk standard to their type. More sex toys for the ladies, but they were like usual, shaped like dicks and such. Again, so many different shapes and sizes and yet haphazardly stuffed in a basket like trash… Layla looked back toward the previous box full of them. This must be the real “Bargain Bin”, they really didn’t seem to care about these ones. Not her problem or score for that matter just means she made a good choice.<br />
<br />
Layla made her way past the maid working the counter at the front, just passing by, she thought. She’d done this sort of things so many times before, it was almost second nature to her. Just act like you’re not doing anything wrong and you aren’t, that simple really. For a moment though, Layla swore she saw the maid eyeballing her like she knew something was up… However a couple had come up to her with a question before Layla could really tell. Whatever… She’d just go through the door and that would be the end of th- What the hell? Layla thought to herself just as she’d pushed on the door and found it wouldn’t budge. Hah, silly me… I’ve got to pull the damn thing, right right… A pull on the door and it still wouldn’t open for her.<br />
<br />
Did they lock the door while she was in the back? No… That couple hadn’t been in here earlier… So that couldn’t be it… Maybe it just got jammed or something? Layla stepped back from the door trying to avoid attention to herself. While she stepped back, the couple that had a question was heading for the door. They got to the door and Layla expected them to have as much difficulty as she did, but… They just opened the door like it was nothing! Layla not so hurriedly stepped up behind them wanting to follow them through as they le- She hit a wall… There wasn’t a real wall there, but the doorway wouldn’t let her out! The door swung shut again closing the way out and becoming impossible to open again.<br />
<br />
A quick look around the shop and it was just her and the maid now. For sure this time, the maid was staring directly at her! Shit… Shit shit shit… Could she bluff her way out? Or maybe she could intimidate her? She didn’t look like much to Layla. Whatever she was going to do, that maid was coming over now. Without much time to think about it, Layla jumped toward trying to scare the maid. “Hey! What gives?! I’m trying to leave and can’t get through the door! You can’t just lock me in here like this!” Layla shouted loudly with more than a little false bravado in her.<br />
<br />
Puffing her her chest trying to look more than a little troubled by this, Layla did her best to “Karen” her way out of this. For all her bluster, the maid just stared at her like there wasn’t and problem here.<br />
<br />
“Madam, I’m afraid our security here makes no mistakes…” Said the maid.<br />
<br />
“The hell do you mean…? Security? What have I done to be stopped like this?!” growled Layla.<br />
<br />
“You’ve attempted to remove some of our contents without prior purchase…” The maid made the accusation without so much as a hint of doubt.<br />
<br />
“Really?! Then why don’t you search me, if you’re so sure?~” Layla taunted confidently as she’d used this trump card of hers many times before.<br />
<br />
“Certainly, that can be arranged~” Came a woman’s voice from behind Layla.<br />
Spinning around Layla saw a well dressed woman standing between her and the door. When the hell did she get there?! There was way too much confidence in that woman’s eyes for Layla’s liking. Time to switch gears, Layla thought as she moved to “Plan B”. “If you don’t let me go right now, I’ll start trashing the place. You got a lot of breakable stuff in here, I’m sure you’d hate to lose it.” Layla barked a laugh to really sell the bit, she didn’t want to have to do that, but she might not know that.<br />
<br />
“Break something…? No, you won’t do that…” chided the woman.<br />
Did she really just call my bluff aga-<br />
“You’ll be joining the inventory rather~” sneered the woman in a way that sent shivers down Layla’s spine.<br />
<br />
“Fuck it!” Layla shouted as she ran for the nearest shelf. It was a last ditch effort, but maybe it’d work… As she crashed into the first shelf, the stuff on the shelves rattled with the hit, but nothing even fell over. The realization caused Layla to reel in panic, she’d just bitten off way more than she could chew. So she started running for the back of the store to at least get out of sight for a minute. As she ran she heard the light click of heels following behind her. That pace wasn’t one of a chase… No… She was taking her time, this had become a hunt… This time it was Layla that was going to pay…<br />
<br />
As she made to hide next to one of the shelves, Layla recalled the threat the woman had made… Something about “Joining the inventory”… What the fuck could that even mean?! Was she actually some super creepy human trafficker type?! Oh fuck, was she about to be disappeared?! Layla fiercely shook her head in denial over the thoughts now running through her head. No no no, she wasn’t going to just let that happen, she wasn’t going to become someone’s fuck toy! Not like.. Not like…<br />
<br />
The stray thought tore her resolve away as she looked to the box of dildos next to her… They all looked liked tiny women… She pulled the own she’d hid in her bra out and really looked at it. It looked like it had been molded into… No, not molded… Someone had become the damn thing! There was no mold seams or miscuts on it… That’s what she’d meant… Shit! If she didn’t smooth things over now, she’d really just be someone’s fuck toy!<br />
<br />
Throwing the dildo to the woman’s feet from her hiding place, Layla begged. “There! You can have it back! I’m sorry, I tried to take it, ok?! I didn’t think I’d be fucking with someone like you!” Layla heard the footsteps stop for the moment, maybe she was going to get out of this. As she started to stand up from her hiding spot, the woman spoke again. There was no mercy in that tone…<br />
<br />
“No… I’m afraid my mind is made and your fate is sealed… You’re my very first thief, an example needs to be made~” The woman’s tone was happy, but like how a cat might talk to a trapped mouse…<br />
<br />
Without much thought, Layla’s fight or flight made her make a break for it. Maybe without that thing on her she’d be able to get out the door! Layla ran along the far wall of the shop across from the woman, she wouldn’t be able to get to her until she had to run across the front. She was wearing sneakers and the woman was wearing heels, she isn’t running in those, Layla’s got the edge here. As she ran down the aisle, Layla tripped suddenly falling flat on her face hard.<br />
<br />
Looking back as soon as her senses came back to her, Layla saw her pant leg had caught on the support of the wall. She tugged her leg trying to free herself either tearing the pants or pulling it loose. Instead, quite the opposite happened, Layla found herself jerked toward the support. With a sudden and jarring hit, Layla was pinned with her back to the support. She’d been pulled up-right and her clothing had stuck to the support like it was super glue. Layla wanted to struggle free, yet she’d found her arms and legs pulled behind in an uncomfortable way around the support. Panic started setting in full in her mind, all she could think of was trying to get away from this nightmare!<br />
<br />
When she started to pull and struggle against the hold she was stuck in. Grunting and straining, Layla felt the tightness of her clothing slowly relieve on her. She opened her eyes and found herself completely naked with her clothing binding her to the support. The fuck kind of twisted shit was this?! Her struggling doubled as she desperately tried to pull free. Behind her, her clothing, forearms, and calves started blending together merging into a singular flat plane.<br />
<br />
With her legs being forced wide apart, Layla saw that there was no more escape for her. Her elbows and knees were drawn into the plane behind her, her ass pressed against the cold wood it was made of. The tears pouring out of her eyes weren’t fake this time, she really was terrified. “Please Miss… Please, let me go! I’ll do anything you want!” Layla sobbed the words hoping against the cold reality. “Anything… I mean it! You want me to be your little sex thing?! Sure! I’ll even wear nothing, but a collar if you want! Just let me go!” Her heart pounded furiously in her chest as she heard the clicking of heels close in on her.<br />
<br />
Seeing those taunting heels stop in front of her, Layla hoped once more that she might get away. A moment after the woman had stopped in front of her, Layla was lifted from the floor along the height of the support. From her vantage point, she could see the whole of the shop around her, including the menacing woman below. The woman’s mouth was pulled into a sadistic smile that was sold by those inhuman eyes of hers. Layla’s position from the board behind her had made her lean forward to easily look down on the shop floor.<br />
<br />
“You’re doing just what I want of you already. You’re going to do just fine, I promise~” Those monstrous eyes felt like they were boring through Layla.<br />
<br />
Layla’s thighs started to feel ice cold, she looked down to find them turning deep green and see through. It was only a slight bit from the board yet, but it was enough to make her scream in panic. The woman below looked like she was staring at a piece of art rather than a person! She looked like she was thinking about something before she reached up toward Layla.<br />
Was she going to stop this after all? Just one really really good scare?!<br />
<br />
“I think this will fit better with the rest of the décor…” muttered the woman as her fingers lightly touched Layla’s pussy. With the barest of touches, the woman spread Layla’s lips wide revealing everything behind them to the world. Then she let go with a nod, leaving Layla’s pussy spread open to the cold air. Layla tried again to thrash and pull free, while the woman stopped even acknowledging her.<br />
<br />
“Hey… Hey…! Hey! Come back here! Let me go, please!” Layla begged again, shock and tears on her face.<br />
<br />
The woman didn’t turn back and the green color inched further up Layla’s thighs. Layla watched the maid go back to the front counter and people came into the shop from the front door! Surely they had to see what was happening to her! “Hey! Hey! Help me! Please help me!” Layla screamed from her place high above the floor. Not a single head turned up to her, the more or less she screamed, it didn’t matter. No one even seemed to realize she was even hanging above them. Not a single person took notice of the screaming naked woman over their heads.<br />
<br />
A couple hours had passed and the cold green color she was becoming had just reached the bottom of her pussy lips. The cold feeling made Layla shudder and roll her eyes briefly as she hung in defeat resting her voice. It was slow, very few people were actually coming in the shop despite how many passed it. Another shorter maid had come out and spoke to the first a few times. She’d giving Layla a few looks, but when Layla tried to beg her… The look of fear in her eyes seemed to match Layla’s own and she ran…<br />
<br />
Another hour and the green color was half way up Layla’s pussy. It seemed to be leaving the interior alone since Layla could still feel the cold air and it’s twitches when she shuddered. Time passed again and the cold green color wrapped around her warm clit sending a shock up her body causing her to unintentionally moan aloud. A drop of her fluids slipped off her cold green lips even falling on a woman’s shoulder. The woman swiped her shoulder and then looked up to Layla! Seeing her chance Layla once again tried to call for help.<br />
<br />
“Help me, please! The woman is crazy and she’s trying to make me part of her collection! You have to get me out of here!” Layla implored on the woman who’s expression never changed from confusion.<br />
<br />
“Well, that’s sort of pretty in a way…” The woman said looking at Layla as if inspecting her. “I don’t think it’s for me though…” With that comment, she walked away from Layla and with her… Some hope…<br />
<br />
Hours wiled away with Layla hanging broken and silent from her perch. Whatever ever she’d done that may have garnered attention always ended the same as the first time… The green color had just taken her breasts now, her nipples staying pink, but becoming cold, hard, and see through like the rest of her. That evil woman had come back as it got dark outside staring at Layla who’d now lost track of the green color visually… She could feel it on the base of her chin though meaning any moment it’d take her ability to speak…<br />
<br />
Layla lazily looked down at the woman who was once again again appraising her. “What… What now…? Am I not done, yet? No one is going to help me anyway, are they?”<br />
<br />
The woman’s only response was calling for her maid to get a step ladder. Maybe she really was done? Going to get her down and let her go now that the day was done? All that humiliation and terror to set her straight once and for all? Now the woman was eye to eye with Layla looking at her intensely. “Are y-” Her tongue was snatched as she opened her mouth to speak. She felt it pulled down and against the cold hard green of her chin, curled slightly forward at max length. In a moment, her tongue was that same green color leaving Layla unable to speak except for lewd or guttural noises. Surprise settled in Layla’s eyes as she looked as the smirk on the woman’s face.<br />
<br />
“I will tell you, I really have no love for thieves… You could ask this one, but well… They’ve long since accepted their new role~” The woman marked her words by running her hands down the black slip dress she was wearing. “I’d show you the other, but so close to the public just wouldn’t do~” Instead she flashed a band of her panties and pat her hip. “Enjoy your night, we’ll be closing the store now. After all, my girls need to rest after such a stressful day, don’t they?~ Good night~”<br />
<br />
Layla watched the three leave in a panic making whatever noises she could to get them to stop, come back, anything! No… They just turned off the lights without looking at Layla leaving her in the dark… It wasn’t all dark though, there was that toy at the counter showing in different colors… Layla understood that those two must’ve been victims too… All around her were warnings that what she was doing was a bad idea. If only she’d known… Sleep pricked at her mind and no matter how much she tried, it finally took her…<br />
<br />
She woke up with the first lines of sunlight coming through the main window. It was morning and still she was able to look around her. She couldn’t feel anything other than her eyes, brow, and pussy though… She could see the green had reached all around her eyes… There wasn’t anything else she physically except shed a few more tears in sadness of losing not only her freedom, but herself. As the tears rolled down her green cheeks, her eyes turned totally green. Unbeknownst to her, her inner pussy solidified at the same time completing her transformation. A final twitch and drops of fluid were her last act. The innermost area had turned a slightly paler pink from her nipples, her clit a tiny pink pearl, and her tears of fluids turned cold hard and clear where they were. The sunlight glistened from the emerald decoration on the wall. Bathing portions of the store in beautiful green light…<br />
<br />
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br />
<br />
Lisa came in and turned on the lights of the storefront for the early morning preparations. She carried with her a small sign and the step ladder that she sat beneath the thief. Climbing the step ladder to reach just beneath the gemstone decoration. She regarded the face of the decoration momentarily seeming to be in painful bliss. Placing the sign against the support, she tacked it in place and climbed down. Making certain the sign was perfectly in place, she moved onto sweeping the dust from the floors.<br />
