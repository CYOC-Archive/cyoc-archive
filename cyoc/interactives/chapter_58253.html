<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan parked Connor the car between two cars in a secluded place in the parking lot. Ryan and Jeremy made sure there was no one else there and then Ryan placed his hand on Connor&#39;s chrome body and concentrated. Suddenly, the car started to dwindle. Chrome changed to skin. After a few moments, Connor was naked on his hands and knees in the middle of the parking stall.<br />
<br />
“That was so cool.” said Connor.<br />
<br />
 “You&#39;d better put this on.” Ryan said, throwing Connor his swimsuit.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” said Connor, after putting the swimsuit on. “Let&#39;s find our targets to transform into.” <br />
<br />
While Ryan and Jeremy were off finding their own targets Connor had to readjust himself from the drive to the beach. Having his gear shifter manhandled during the trip over left him with a sizable boner that would not go down. He was finally able to get it down to a slightly less obvious bulge when he heard a voice from behind.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing to my car?!”<br />
<br />
Connor turned and was face to chest to one of the biggest men he had ever seen. That was all it took for his semi flaccid cock to bone up again and pop out of his swimsuit.<br />
<br />
“Well, well LITTLE man I see that you have a thing for muscle.” The muscle man finger flicked the growing member. “I’ve seen bigger wieners at the deli.”<br />
<br />
That one finger flick sent Connor over the edge. He had never seen his new cock get hard until now. It grew only a fraction of an inch longer but now it was hard as a steel pipe and an inch and a half thick.<br />
<br />
The muscle man grabbed it with his gloved hand and gave it a good squeeze causing Connor to moan out loud. “Almost the right size but not quite ready, come see me when you’ve grown up.”<br />
<br />
While the muscle man was holding onto his cock Connor concentrated the best he could on the man before him. He reached out and grabbed as much of the striated pecs as he could. The oiled surface made it difficult to get a good grip but there was enough skin contact for Connor to feel even dizzier than he already was.<br />
<br />
The muscle man released his grip on the cock and backhanded Connor’s hand away. Doing a double bicep pose the man told Connor. “Not yet little man, you’re not man enough for me. When you become this big then come find me. <br />
<br />
Connor saw the peak of both biceps grow bigger than anything he had ever seen. He could not let the man see transform so he made a mad dash for the nearest restroom.<br />
<br />
“That’s it little man go shoot your load. It will probably be the best you have ever had.” The muscle laughed at the pathetic little boy run with his hands over his crotch.<br />
<br />
Connor just made it into the building before the changes started to happen. With his cock already in its aroused state it was the first to change. It quickly doubled in girth and length in a matter of seconds. Still tightly tucked in his suit, his balls became shinny and hard as billiard balls. The growth radiated out from there in all directions. His ass grew out so big that the seat of his board shorts was drawn deep into the developing crevasse. His thighs widened to twice their normal size and then some. <br />
<br />
Looking down at the floor Connor saw that it was getting further and further away, then something was blocking his view. Two growing mounds of flesh were lifting his chin up higher until it was parallel to the floor. <br />
<br />
As fortune would have it there was a floor to ceiling mirror on one wall of the facility. The reflection Connor saw was that of a growing behemoth almost as wide as the mirror. He could see that his abs were perfectly formed into a cut set of eight-pack abs. His lats and chest were pushing his skinny arms away from his body. Higher his arms went the bigger they grew. Biceps and triceps fought for space on the upper arm as the forearms grew bigger than anything Popeye ever had. Topping off the body was set of shoulder wider than the mirror Connor stood in front of. He tried to turn sideways to get a better look of his shoulders but his head movement was restricted by his neck muscles. From what he could see, his back was thick with muscles. He could only imagine how wide he looked from the back. He had to find his brothers at their predetermined meeting place and show them his transformation.  <br />
<br />
Connor had to stuff his cock back into his swimsuit before he could leave the building. His preferred choice of swimsuits before today was board shorts but the reality shift made them into a pair of well packed posers. Deep down he knew that he always wanted to wear something this reveling but was too ashamed to show off what he didn’t have. After seeing his new body he didn’t give a fuck what people thought.<br />
<br />
He wanted to keep this body so he started to make plans to keep it. Since Jeremy and Ryan hadn’t seen him yet Connor headed to the rendezvous spot. Connor hadn’t seen what his brothers had turned into either so he waited near by to see who showed up. <br />
<br />
As planned at two-o-clock two complete strangers showed up. One was a surfer dude with long blond hair. The other one was balding middle-aged man with a beer gut.<br />
<br />
“Jeremy?”<br />
<br />
“Ryan?”<br />
<br />
“Dude, what happened to you?” Jeremy said in a California accent.<br />
<br />
“I was about to touch my victim when this drunk bumped into me. I have been wondering the beach looking for you and Connor. Have you seen him yet?” Ryan took a drink of his glass of beer that he had with him.<br />
<br />
“I just got here myself, Dude.” Jeremy turns around and shows his brother his new body. “What do you think of my new look?”<br />
<br />
“As they say in surfer lingo, ‘You look awesome dude.’…. B-U-U-U-R-R-R-R-B! Sorry about that I must still a bit of the drunk in me.” Ryan downs the last of his beer and tosses the empty plastic cup in the trash can.<br />
<br />
“Ryan, do you see that muscle dude over there?” Jeremy points to a guy sitting on the nearby bench. “He has been watching us for the last few minutes a lot closer than I like. Do you think that is Connor?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, but make sure we don’t touch him before we have a chance to change back or he will be our new base model.”  Ryan advised his brother.<br />
<br />
“Dude, I may look like an air head but I remember what happened last time.” Jeremy said with an air of contempt for what just said.<br />
<br />
Connor saw that his brothers had spotted him looking at them. He could see the look on their faces as if they wanted to ask something. He wasn’t sure which brother was which but he was almost positive they were his brothers. He waited for the right moment to put his plan into effect. As they approached the bench he looked away as if he was trying to ignore them. He gave them every indication that they had caught him looking at them.<br />
<br />
“Excuse me sir, can we ask you a question?” Ryan asked the stranger.<br />
<br />
Before Ryan could ask the question Connor answered in a deep voice. “NO! Now take your hippy son and leave me alone.”<br />
<br />
“But sir, we just wanted to know if …” Jeremy tried to ask.<br />
<br />
Connor stood up, towering over his smaller brothers he looking down into their scared faces. Grabbing their arms before they could pull away, he spoke again in a deeper more authoritative voice. “I have only one thing to say and listen good because it is going to be the last thing I say.”<br />
<br />
At the same time they looked at each others faces knowing that they now would not change back into their old bodies.<br />
<br />
“Got Ya!”<br />
The looks of concern changed to that of delight at finding their brother once again. “Connor?” they said in unison. <br />
<br />
Connor knew that the damage was done when he saw that the changes were starting. “We need to get you two to the restrooms before people notice that you’re changing.”<br />
<br />
Protesting all the way the two brothers voiced their concerns of the underhanded trick their brother had pulled on them. The triple contact was taking effect on all three of the brothers While Connor was loosing some size Ryan and Jeremy was getting bigger. <br />
<br />
Ryan’s body became trim fit, loosing the beer belly and the subcutaneous fat from his last transformation. His bald head began to grow back new hair changing from gray to light brown. All the body hair that he had gotten from the middle-aged man fell off his body, disappearing before it had a chance to hit the floor. Ryan had to hold up his Bermuda shorts when he lost the extra inches around his waist. When he saw the body hair disappearing from his body he to look at how much hair he had lost. Pulling the waist of the shorts away from his body he saw a trim patch pubic hair at the base of a very large set of family jewels. Seeing his new equipment made up for rest of the unwanted changes.<br />
<br />
Jeremy’s change on the other hand was just as dramatic as Connor’s but with an opposite effect. His body grew larger muscles than a surfer should have His long bleached blond hair receded back into his head getting darker the shorter it got. The full body tan from his nude surfing only lightened slightly over his growing body. His height increased to match that of his two brothers. He could not see all the changes that his body going through but looking at his brothers he knew what he was going to turn into, a twenty something male bodybuilder<br />
<br />
Connor didn’t mind losing all the muscle that he had gotten from the huge muscle guy. The one thing he did miss was the large cock and balls that he gotten. After the reality shift he only had vague memories of his boyish cock and balls he once had this morning. He looked at his bigger triplet brothers as the reality shift change their clothing once again. His poser stayed the same but became a bit smaller to accommodate his smaller package. His brothers swimwear went through a shrinking phase as the colors on each blended to the most dominate color. Each brother now wore one of the primary colors, Connor’s was red, Ryan’s was yellow and Jeremy’s was blue. Each displayed an equally large bulge that could not be ignored.<br />
<br />
“Connor, look at what you did to us.” Ryan said. <br />
<br />
“Now we look muscle freaks!” Jeremy added.<br />
<br />
“You don’t like the new you?” Connor asked his two brothers.<br />
<br />
“NO!” They said almost at the same time. <br />
<br />
“You might want to rethink your answers dear brothers. Because you are not seeing what I’m seeing.” Connor pointed at the crotch of each of his brothers.<br />
<br />
  Ryan and Jeremy looked at where Connor was pointing. When each brother saw the crotch bulge the other had each began to get bigger. As if by instinct each brother reached down and pulled their posers down over their bulges. Out flopped three of the biggest cocks any twenty year old could ever have. For the next few minutes a jack off session to end all jack off sessions took the boys, no young men, into a place they have never been.</p>
