<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brianna felt like her blood was on fire as she felt the transformation begin, her body felt weak as her legs gave out from her. She thought she was going to fall but the moment she thought was going to fall, her wife Stacy grabbed her and held her up using her were tiger strength which was far beyond what any human could do. <br />
<br />
“It is alright, everything is going to be alright.” Reassured Stacy as she carried Brianna back to their bed and gently laid her down onto the bed. <br />
<br />
Stacy looked at her wife, the love of her life with her bare chest covered with her blood from the massive wound Stacy had inflicted on her to transform her into a werecat. The wound healed itself once the magic of transformation had fully entered her body however the blood still stained her human flesh. Stacy knew the process, but she was still scared as her wife breathing became quick and shallow as he skin became flush and covered with sweet.<br />
<br />
“I love you.” Reassured Stacy even as she heard Brianna’s heart thumping in her chest. <br />
<br />
“I love you.” Said Briaana between larded breaths, she closed her eyes as she felt the transformation begin.<br />
<br />
Stacy could hear the bones within her wife break before reforming as she grew in size. Werecats like all were creatures where larger than what they were in their “human” form. For Stacy her change of only 5 inches was actually small, she was just naturally a very tall women, but Brianna was about average at 5’5. Now her body was lengthening as she added almost a foot to her height. <br />
<br />
“It hurts.” cried Brianna as she gripped the sheets of the bed, moments later there was a ripping sound as her fingernails turned into claws. Her toes where doing the same as her feet changed as her legs and arms gained more muscles just like the rest of her body.<br />
<br />
“I know, my first change hurt.” reassured Stacy, in the pride werecats lived in their natural state however at a certain age all learned how to turn into a human and then back to their real form. That change really hurt, but after that the change didn’t hurt at all. “What kind of cat do you want to be, my love?”<br />
<br />
“The kind you love.” answered Brianna as Stacy smiled. <br />
<br />
“That could be anything, as long as it’s you I don’t care.” Stated Stacy as Brianna’s mouth changed into a more cat-like face and her ears moved up. <br />
<br />
Brianna’s skin was slick with sweet and red as multiple goosebumps began to form, Stacy knew that soon fur would begin coming in. Still there was no sign of what type of feline her wife was going to become. Stacy heard pops as Brianna’s face began to shift, a cat-like muzzle began to form as fangs grew within her mouth. Her blue eyes became silted and slightly larger as large pointed cat like ears grew out of the top of her head. Tuffs of black fur appeared on each of her ears as Stacy realized what her wife was likely becoming.<br />
<br />
Her guess was confirmed as moment later as Brianna arched her back as a short stubby tail grew in, nothing like the long powerful tiger tail she had. <br />
<br />
Fur began to grow rapidly, snow white fur running down her chest, flaring out over her breasts before narrowing down to a point around her womanhood. The white fur also spread out over her lower face, thicker fur grew around her jaw line. White and black fur grew around her eyes as the vast majority of her body began to be covered with tan fur with black spots mixed in. <br />
<br />
Brianna’s pain laxed as the changes came to a stop, her whole body hurt and felt weird as her brain made new connections to her claws and tail.<br />
<br />
“How…how do I look?” inquired Brianna<br />
<br />
“As beautiful as ever.” Purred Stacy before rubbing her head against her wife. “My beautiful lynx of a wife.”<br />
<br />
“Lynx…” said Brianna as she sat up and began to look at herself. Her whole body hurt but she couldn’t be happier, she had never imagined herself as a Lynx before, but now she couldn’t see herself any differently. She stood up and looked at herself in the mirror, she was taller for sure now. Not as tall as Stacy but taller, her bust bigger once again her wife beat her there but she loved her larger chest. She ran her hands down her sides and over her new fur covered body. It was a dream come true, her fur was thicker then Stacy but felt softer to her. <br />
<br />
“This is amazing.” Said Brianna as she turned around to see Stacy laying on her side becoming her back to the bed. <br />
<br />
“Just wait until I show you how to make love as a werecat and once we are done we will transform the rest of our family and begin our new lives as a werecat family.” Confirmed Stacy as Brianna smiled.</p>
