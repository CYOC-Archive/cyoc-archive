<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daleswithe Elementary School...<br />
Everyone was sitting in class learning when there was a crashing sound from in the room near the window. The room grew quite as everyone looked to the source of the sound. Everyone saw anthro green iguana standing on the floor in front of the table where the terrarium used to be but now was in pieces. The anthro iguana was about as tall as the children & wore nothing at all & spoke in a girl&#39;s voice confused looking themself over &quot;What?&quot; Jacob was the first to speak standing up asking &quot;Gigi?&quot; The anthro iguana looked to Jacob & responded &quot;Yes. What you want?&quot; Then the iguana confused &quot;I spoke like you humans? And I know what you saying?&quot; Now all the kids were getting up & going over to the anthro lizard. The kids were excited & confused as was the anthro lizard was all by this & alot of talking & touching occurred. Gigi as before she changed didn&#39;t mind at all the kids touching her all over. Not even her tail. One girl commented Gigi had no boobs. Another kid replied to the girl thinking her dumb &quot;Why would she? She&#39;s a reptile stupid. And don&#39;t even why she has no hair.&quot; Well needlessly to say class was pretty much over; all classes were for the rest of the day. The school day ended & everyone was leaving when Gigi stopped Jacob asking &quot;You forgetting me?&quot; Jacob stopped & asked confused &quot;What?&quot; The lizard reminded him &quot;It&#39;s your turn o take me home for the weekend.&quot;  Jacob looked to the teacher Ms. Bells. Ms. Bells stated &quot;Well Gigi is right. It&#39;s your turn to take the class pet home for the next 4 days.. Sense we get Monday & Tuesday off too do to teacher meetings.&quot; &quot;So Gigi is still the class pet?&quot; Jacob asked. Ms, Bells answered &quot;Well sense Gigi was always & still is an animal so still legally property of the school & the class pet still.&quot; &quot;Ok &quot; Jacob said believing he understood. So then Gigi went to ask about her carrier but stopped when she realized it. &quot;I&#39;m not going to fit in that anymore.&quot; Jacob smiled placing a hand on her shoulder saying &quot;No you won&#39;t. You&#39;re going to walk like the rest of us. Come on.&quot; Gigi replied &quot;Ok.&quot; So the 2 walked out together. Ms. Bells then called Jacob&#39;s parents to give them a heads up about this.<br />
At Jacob&#39;s house...<br />
Jacob walked in with Gigi. &quot;Ms, Bells wasn&#39;t kidding about this.&quot; Jacob&#39;s mom said with a smile. Jacob explained &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure the fruit from my lunch I gave her was one of those fruits that do things to people.&quot; Jacob&#39;s dad chuckled &quot;Good thing you didn&#39;t eat it then. Who knows what it might of done to you.&quot; The anthro green iguana said politely &quot;I&#39;m Gigi. Jacob is a good kid. Glad you had him.&quot; Jacob&#39;s parents & Jacob seemed shocked by what Gigi said. &quot;How do you know they had me? That they my parents?&quot; Jacob asked confused & surprised. The anthro iguana replied &quot;You all smell alike & now I understand it you clearly came from them.&quot; The mom chuckled &quot;You right on that. We his parents.&quot; &quot;Now got to be getting to our jobs. We&#39;ll see you later tonight.&quot; And with that Jacob&#39;s parents left for work. Jacob headed upstairs to change out of his school as he always did after. Jacob was putting away his school clothes when Gigi walked into his room. He turned to see the anthro iguana. She walked over & sat on his bed & grabbed his TV remote & turned on the TV. Jacob standing at his closet nude didn&#39;t know what to say. Gigi stated &quot;I watched you humans countless times. That&#39;s why I know how to do this.&quot; Jacob said &quot;It&#39;s not that.&quot; Gigi asked &quot;What then?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m not wearing anything right now.&quot; Gigi stated as a matter of fact &quot;Neither am I.&quot; Jacob tried to explain &quot;You never have worn anything ever.&quot; Gigi nodded &quot;Of course not. I&#39;m an animal.&quot; Jacob tried to explain &quot;But I&#39;m not wearing anything.&quot; Gigi getting puzzled asked &quot;Why you telling me this?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m nude right now. Unclothed.&quot; Jacob explained being more direct about it. Gigi getting more puzzled &quot;Why you telling me this?&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t you care?&quot; Jacob asked puzzled. &quot;Why should I care?&quot; Gigi asked.  &quot;I&#39;m nude in front of you. Unclothed.&quot; Jacob explained. Gigi said &quot;So.&quot; Jacob asked &quot;Doesn&#39;t this bother you?&quot; Gigi asked confused &quot;Bother me?&quot; Jacob finally getting mad said &quot;Sense you are different now.&quot; Gigi asked &quot;What you mean?&quot; Jacob pointed out &quot;Different. Two legged now. Anthromorphic.&quot; Finally seeming to get it stated &quot;I&#39;m still same Gigi the green iguana. I may be walking upright & talking now but I am still an iguana.&quot; Jacob asked &quot;So you don&#39;t care I&#39;m unclothed? Nude?&quot; Gigi getting mad yelled looking at him &quot;Why do you think I care? You humans been unclothed before around me.&quot; &quot;So you don&#39;t care?&quot; Jacob asked. Gigi getting madder &quot;Wear something or don&#39;t. I don&#39;t care.&quot; Jacob nearly chuckled at this. Yes he&#39;d been nude around Gigi when she was just a normal green iguana. Why would he think she&#39;s care if was nude around as anthromorphic one now. Jacob decided sense she didn&#39;t care if he was nude or not to just not get dressed. Jacob walked over to the bed & sat down next to her. They watched TV till I got late.<br />
Jacob got in bed (still nude) turning off the light. Jacob was soon surprised to feel someone get into bed with him. He felt the familiar feeling of slightly cold scales up against his back. &quot;Gigi?&quot; Jacob asked confused. &quot;You&#39;re warm Jacob.&quot; Gigi stated. Jacob asked to confirm &quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; Gigi answered seeming confused &quot;Why would it be anything else?&quot; Jacob feeling silly thinking that replied &quot;Of course. I&#39;m warmblooded & you&#39;re cold-blooded. You just using me to keep warm.&quot; Jacob could alreadly feel she was starting to warm up. Gigi replied &quot;Yeah.&quot; The anthro green iguana then embraced Jacob in a hug from behind putting her arms around him, entangling her legs with his & placing her head on his left shoulder. This felt good to him. Jacob reached over & began rubbing the iguana&#39;s reptilian snout asking &quot;You mad about me giving that fruit that turned you into this Gigi?&quot; Gigi answered quickly &quot;No. I&#39;m grateful to be like this now.&quot; &quot;An Anthromorph?&quot; Jacob questioned. &quot;Yes. I can talk with you humans now & do so much things I couldn&#39;t do or understand before now.&quot; Jacob smiled saying &quot;Then I&#39;m glad you&#39;re not mad. It was truly an accident.&quot; The anthro green iguana said &quot;Thank you anyways.&quot; The two soon fell asleep together.</p>
