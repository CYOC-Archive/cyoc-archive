<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Neil held his phone, staring down at the screen. His face looked back at him, his East Asian features melding with his European ones. He looked the same as he had after fucking Matt. In a way, it was a relief that not all sex was making him more Korean. But he was also a bit curious about what it would be like to go all the way. <br />
<br />
Still, Neil’s memories were shifting. His mother was fully Korean, having been born there and emigrating as a child with her parents. Like bubbles rising to the surface, new memories filled Neil’s mind: trips back to Korea to visit relatives, Korean lessons on the weekend, even participating in a bodybuilding competition there during one of his visits. He remembered his weekend class celebrating “Hangeul Day” each October; part of him thought it was funny to have a holiday for the Korean alphabet, while another part of him thought it made perfect sense. <br />
<br />
After several minutes of the group sunning themselves on the large rock, Neil stood up. “Let’s finish our hike,” he said to the others, “As nice as it is out on this rock, I want to get a bit more hiking done while the weather is warm and the sun is still up.” He bent over and picked up his clothes, three sets of eyes following his every move as he pulled on his underwear, shorts, socks, and shoes, their gazes drinking in his muscular physique. “You guys just gonna look, or are you going to join me?” he asked jokingly. <br />
<br />
Max and Clara got up, sharing a kiss before they began to help each other dress. Matt let out a long sigh, then stood up last, pulling on his own clothes. “I would have been happy lying here all afternoon…” he groused. <br />
<br />
Clara and the three shirtless men resumed their hike, moving away from the lake and up into the hills. Max and his girlfriend stayed in the back, walking together, one of his strong arms around her. They shared whispers and soft laughter together, paying little attention to Neil or Matt. As the foursome crested a hill, they came to a cleared area with a few picnic tables. A huge man had one leg up on one of the tables and was bent over, stretching. From the back, it was impossible to miss the powerful glutes that filled a pair of short, black, skintight, square-cut lycra shorts. Most of his massive legs were bare, showing off their golden tan. He straightened and pulled his leg off the table. He wore a tank top in a shocking shade of pink and his lats swept out on either side, dramatically flared. Huge shoulders and traps capped his broad back and his arms were utterly unreal, packed with impossibly-thick yet defined masses of muscle. He was bulging, sculpted perfection. <br />
<br />
Neil and his companions paused for a moment, uncertain who the man could be. The mystery was solved a moment later when the tower of muscle turned, revealing the smiling face of Bradley Channing, the personal trainer from 20 Fitness. Neil’s eyes widened, taking in the sight of the man, who was certainly larger and more muscular than he remembered. In front, the pink tank top was of the stringer variety, hiding little of the trainer’s enormous pectoral muscles, each so thick with brawn that the man’s dark nipples pointed more down than forward. The top row of Bradley’s cut abs was visible as well, undulating gently as the big man breathed. <br />
<br />
“I see I’m not the only one who thought this afternoon was perfect for a hike!” Bradley called out, striding toward the group with a broad grin on his face. Matt smiled and moved toward him, as did Neil a moment later. The trainer spread his huge arms wide, pulling both men in for a powerful hug, one arm around each. “Great to see you guys!” he said enthusiastically, holding the hug for a long moment before finally releasing them. He looked past them to where Max and Clara were standing together, the muscular actor positioned behind her and holding her close, his big arms wrapped around her. “And great to see you two also!” Bradley added. Then he addressed the group, “So, who’s up for heading up the hill with me?” He pointed to an intimidating geological feature that looked like it was more a series of cliffs than a mere “hill.” <br />
<br />
“Actually, Clara and I need to get back,” Max said, apologetically. “We both have papers that are due and I have a call with my agent. As much as I appreciate the natural splendor here, I need to get in cell signal range, at least.” <br />
<br />
Neil shrugged and Matt&#39;s shoulders slumped; as scary as the hill looked, he was eager to keep hiking, once he had been roused. “They’re our ride back,” Neil explained to Bradley.<br />
<br />
“Nah. I’m your ride back now!” the trainer replied brightly, flashing a broad smile. “That work for everybody?” <br />
<br />
Indeed it did work for everyone, in the end. Max and Clara cheerfully waved goodbye, then headed down the path that led back to where her sedan had been parked. <br />
<br />
“Just us now,” Bradley smirked, as Clara and Max disappeared down the path and around a bend. “You guys ready for that little hill over there? Conquer it? Show it who’s boss?” His smirk became a mischievous grin, then he turned and began marching toward the steep hill, his powerful thighs bare, his jutting glutes barely covered by his shorts as his strong legs carried his herculean body up the incline. <br />
<br />
A moment later Neil followed, and then Matt did as well, bringing up the rear of the trio as they made their way up the steep hill. For a while they walked in silence, traversing the most difficult part of the hike single-file. Yet Neil couldn’t help but admire Bradley’s broad back and magnificent ass, watching the bodybuilder’s glutes move in the black lycra shorts. Matt was similarly entranced by the sight of Neil’s body as it moved. <br />
<br />
As they reached the top of the cliff, Bradley turned, grinning. “Great view from up here!” he enthused. His big arm encompassed the view of the valley that stretched out away from the hill, but his eyes were locked on Neil when he spoke. “I know a nice spot nearby,” he added, before leading the group off the path and into some nearby trees. <br />
<br />
“I love it up here,” Bradley noted as they walked, “The air is fresh, everything is alive, and its ten times better than walking on a treadmill.” Neil agreed with the trainer, while Matt remained silent, more focused on admiring the two magnificent specimens of manhood rather than trees or air quality. <br />
<br />
After several minutes, they arrived at a small clearing around a natural pool. A stream became a small waterfall, keeping the pool full, then reemerged on the other side and carried water further down the hill. That finally caught Matt’s attention. He pulled out his phone and took numerous photos of it, feeling his surroundings tug at his more artistic sensibilities. <br />
<br />
Bradley and Neil stood off to the side, amused by Matt’s sudden photographic endeavors. Neil in particular was curious; he never recalled Matt having an artistic side, but the smaller man was clearly taking great care to get each shot just right. <br />
<br />
“Matt, you do any physique photography?” Bradley called out. Matt looked up, blinking in confusion a few times. The personal trainer grinned, and brought up his massive arms, flexing them proudly. “Give it a try!” he exhorted Matt. <br />
<br />
Matt brought up his phone, then frowned. “Wrong spot,” he said, shaking his head. “Lighting is all wrong. The photos will never turn out right. Instead,” he looked around, then pointed, “stand over there. And face where Neil is.” Bradley moved as directed, then resumed his pose. Matt took several photos, occasionally giving further direction between them. “Come on over, Neil!” Bradley added, “You’re going to need your own portfolio!” <br />
<br />
Shaking his head at the unexpected nature of the impromptu photoshoot, Neil trundled over to where Bradley was holding a side chest pose. Neil mimicked it, the two of them grinning at Matt as he snapped several pictures. Soon Bradley’s stringer tank was draped over a nearby boulder, displaying his carved torso in all its glory. <br />
<br />
Moving from pose to pose, sometimes solo, sometimes as a pair, the two musclemen began to feel a new sensation rising--arousal. Bradley in particular was found himself yearning for Neil in a new and unexpected way. <br />
<br />
“Put the phone away,” he instructed Matt, although his eyes remained fixed on Neil. He then slowly removed his shorts and underwear, tossing them on top of his stringer. His hard dick bobbed out in front of him, big and powerful looking, just like the man himself. He went through a series of poses, naked but for his shoes and socks. <br />
<br />
The trainer wasn’t the only one who was giving in to the sudden sexual energy surrounding that little pool. Neil stripped as well, his massive cock throbbing eagerly, jutting out in front of him, the one part of him that was unquestionably bigger than Bradley. Slowly, Neil performed a series of poses. It was part bodybuilding routine, part strip show, part seduction. It was beyond successful. <br />
<br />
“Fuck Neil…” Bradley purred, his voice low and rich with desire, “I can’t get over how hot you are!” He stepped closer, running a calloused hand over one of Neil’s strong delts. His voice became lower, almost husky, “I’ve been fucking a lot of guys lately,” he confided, “but right now, what I want, more than anything else, is to find out what it’s like to be the one getting fucked…” <br />
<br />
“I’ll be gentle,” Neil breathed, his cock beginning to ache, it was so hard. <br />
<br />
“Just at first,” Bradley replied, adding in a soft chortle, “Otherwise, what’s the point?” <br />
<br />
Neil grinned and gave his hard dick a few strokes, rubbing the pre over his cockhead. Bradley bent over slightly, reaching out to a nearby outcropping of rock for support. “Go for it, bro,” he growled. <br />
<br />
Neil did not hesitate. He got into position behind Bradley, then slowly pushed his huge cock into the trainer’s muscular ass. The larger man gasped as he felt the oversized intruder enter him. His powerful back became a series of mountain ranges as his muscles tensed up, the peaks receding as he slowly relaxed. “Fuck yesss…” he hissed, pressing his ass back, encouraging Neil to keep going. The younger man didn’t have to be told twice, eagerly pushing forward until every inch was inside the horny trainer. <br />
<br />
Unwilling to be left out of the fun, Matt got down on his knees and positioned himself in front of Bradley. He began by caressing the trainer’s big dick and balls, but soon was running his lips and tongue over it, and finally took the head into his mouth and began to suck. Bradley let out a loud growl of approval, reaching down with one hand to caress the back of Matt’s head while the other arm remained stretched out and connected with the stone outcropping. “Fuck me harder,” he growled to Neil. <br />
<br />
Neil eagerly complied, pushing forward, thrusting with greater force. Bradley let out a moan of ecstasy, his own hips forced forward, driving his own dick down Matt’s throat. “Again! More!” the hulking trainer snarled, briefly clenching his glutes around Neil’s tool, then relaxing and letting out a deep growl of lust as he felt Neil comply, slamming forward harder. <br />
<br />
Soon the three men were synched up. Neil’s thrusts into Bradley would push the trainer forward as well, driving the cock that was shoved down Matt’s throat. Bradley’s big hand kept Matt in place and ensured that he did not hit the stone behind him, even as Neil increased the speed and force of his thrusts, causing a commensurate increase in the rate that Bradley’s dick was driven down Matt’s throat. For several minutes they grunted and growled and sweated together, a fuck-machine made of human muscle and cock. <br />
<br />
Neil came first, collapsing against Bradley’s impossibly broad back as his huge cock spasmed wildly inside the larger bodybuilder. He almost thought he could feel the trainer’s lats and traps growing beneath him. Bradley himself was next, shooting a large load of his seed down Matt’s throat. The smallest of the men came last, the intense taste of the trainer’s spunk pushing him over the edge. <br />
<br />
They remained together for a bit, panting, sweaty, aglow from their orgasms. Eventually they pulled apart, cocks beginning to soften, cum still dribbling though. “Fuck… that was incredible…” Neil purred.</p>
