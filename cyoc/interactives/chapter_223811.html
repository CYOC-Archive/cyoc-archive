<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ann and her friends now approached the Magic Shop, they wondered what exactly was going on.<br />
<br />
Thr group of teens had redoubled their efforts, training in magic far harder than they would have thought. Even though Akira stated things were fine, the kitsune going so far as to increase security measures with assistance from the other timeline, they knew better. This was why they expected the worst after Akira invited them to the Magic Shop. &quot;So where&#39;s Winery and Pyrrha,&quot; Drake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Akira told then to go early,&quot; Mia stated. &quot;Said that they needed to talk with them before everyone showed up.&quot; The others now nervously glanced at one another. Winny and Prryha were royalty, the only students at Magic High with direct connections to the ruling families of any of the realms. If Akira summoned those two separately, they realized that whatever this was about was serious. &quot;Look don&#39;t sweat it,&quot; Rexie stated, the white tabby cat now squeezing in between the teens. &quot;Fox boy always exaggerates everything. If things aren&#39;t running perfectly he thinks it&#39;s the end of the world.&quot; Mia and the others nodded, although not convinced. Something serious was going, they just weren&#39;t quite sure how serious.<br />
<br />
As the group now entered, their eyes went wide in surprise. The small shop was packed, Ann counting perhaps 50 people jammed into area. &quot;Whoa,&quot; she gasped. &quot;It looks like everyone from the other timeline showed up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not al either,&quot; Fey added in surprise. &quot;Look!&quot; The teens now looked to where Fey was pointing, their jaws dropping as they beheld several leaders of the magical realms. &quot;Queen Glitter is here,&quot; Fey said in awe, noticing the fairy queen and some of her bodyguards. &quot;So is the Dragon King,&quot; Terumi added, pointing to the non descript college age man. &quot;And Tatsu,&quot; Drake said softly, the teens eyes now settling on the grim looking kitsune. Ann was shocked, seeing her parents along with Merlin, Lilith, and Baba Yaga grouped towards the front. This was more serious than any of them realized. Looking over the assembled guests, Ann noticed her cousin Stephanie. &quot;Cmon,&quot; she said, beckoning her friends forward.<br />
<br />
As Ann approached her cousin, she could see the ebony haired teen smile. &quot;Ann good to see you again,&quot; she said, hugging the girl. &quot;Ann who is this,&quot; Mia asked. &quot;Mia this is my cousin Stephanie,&quot; Ann replied. Mia gaped at the slightly older teen, she had no idea Ann had a cousin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Stephanie smiled. &quot;Ann told me a little bit about you guys.&quot; Mia nodded, the group of teens studying eachother carefully. &quot;This is my boyfriend Travis,&quot; Stephanie stated, Mia now looked at the tall, handsome teen, noticing him glaring towards the front at another teenager with dark brown hair. Stephanie frowned, noticing her boyfriend staring daggers at the other teenager. &quot;Travis!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Travis replied meekly, the teen offering Ann and her friends a warm smile and polite wave. &quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; As the group of teens now made introductions, Ann studied Travis carefully, noting the stern expression on his face. &quot;Is everything okay,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry about Travis,&quot; Stephanie sighed. &quot;He&#39;s still angry at that guy over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He attacked you Stephanie,&quot; Travis countered, the teens eyes focused on the teenage boy. &quot;No one attacks my friends, you especially.&quot; Stephanie smiled, standing on tip toe as she placed a tender kiss on her boyfriends cheek. &quot;You&#39;re sweet,&quot; she said softly. &quot;But it was an accident. We all kind of started it and besides, he apologized. You do realize we&#39;re all probably going to end up working together.&quot; As Ann was about to ask who this mysterious teen was, her parents now called everyone to attention. The Magic Shop now eerily silent as they spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to thank everyone for coming,&quot; Kellie stated. &quot;I wish it was under better circumstances but a very serious matter has come to our attention.&quot; Ann now watched as her sister Katie stepped forward. &quot;How serious is this threat mom,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite serious I&#39;m afraid,&quot; Jack said solemnly, gesturing the teenage boy Travis was glaring forward. &quot;We weren&#39;t sure if we believed it at first. That is until Tatsu verified his story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we believe the kitsune,&quot; Lilith asked, the demon queen furrowing her brow as she studied everyone carefully. &quot;Yes mom we do,&quot; Jack groaned. &quot;We&#39;ve already dealt with the One Humanity. This teen was able to confirm everything we already suspected and more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is he,&quot; Sasha Sampson asked.<br />
<br />
Ann and her friends now watched this teenage boy, not much older than herself step forward. The teen appeared nervous, glancing at another group of teens who seemed to give him some encouragement. &quot;My name is Darren McKenna,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m..um...from the future.&quot; A murmur now began to grow amongst everyone, what was someone from the future doing here?<br />
<br />
&quot;In my time&quot; he continued. &quot;I was training to become the Catalyst.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats a Catalyst,&quot; Samantha Davis asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its a once in a generational wizard,&quot; Darren continued. &quot;My teacher, Yuriko Harris...&quot; Mia and Zacks eyes went wide, the two teens springing to attention at the mwntion of their goddaughters name. &quot;Yuki,&quot; Zack exclaimed. &quot;How did you Yuki train you? She&#39;s only three!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m from about 80 years in the future,&quot; Darren replied sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck. &quot;She told me stories about all of you. Especially you and Mia. She loved all of you, you taught her everything she knew.&quot; The group now began to look amongst eachother, still trying to wrap their minds around this. &quot;Okay,&quot; Mika Harris began. &quot;Lets say we believe you. It wouldn&#39;t be the first time we&#39;ve dealt with time travelers.  Why are you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I&#39;m not the only one that traveled through time,&quot; Darren stated. &quot;A group known as The Normal came first. They intend to murder everyone in this room and erase my future.&quot; Darren now beckoned another person forward, the man appearing to be in his late twenties with a well trimmed auburn colored beard. &quot;This,&quot; Darren stated. &quot;Is Evan Harris. He is keenly aware of what the Normal can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan Harris,&quot; Claudia Harris asked. &quot;Wait, is he a relative of mine?&#39; Evan blushed, glancing around the room at people he hadn&#39;t seen in decades. &quot;Kind of Aunt Claudia,&quot; he said, a pang of guilt washing over him as he looked the room over. Years from now he would help lead to this groups downfall. Hopefully this time he could prevent that. &quot;My umm parents are alive now. I grew up knowing all of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Gloria asked, unsure if she wished to know. &quot;Can you tell us who your parets are?&quot; Evan shrugged, the future had already been altered so much their didn&#39;t seem a point in keeping some things secret. &quot;Your sister Lynne Aunt Gloria,&quot; Evan said. &quot;And Tom. Tom Harris.&quot; Gloria gaped, Lynne was only 4 years old and Tommy was a 6 year old starting first grade. <br />
<br />
&quot;By the way its great to see you and Uncle Caleb again,&quot; Evan smiled. &quot;I just want to say thank you for everything you did when I was growing up.&quot; Gloria and Cakeb paused, looking first to Evan before looking to eachother. If Caleb was Evans uncle then that meant...<br />
<br />
&quot;Evan,&quot; Darren stated. Evan apologized, so caught up in the reunion that he forgot what he was here for. &quot;You&#39;re right sorry,&quot; he sighed. &quot;I was a prisoner of the Normal for awhile. They made me do...horrible things.  The Boss, their leader. If he&#39;s here then we&#39;re in grave danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s not lying,&quot; Mary Elise stated, the group now looking to the young woman in a wheelchair. &quot;After making contact with Darren and his friends, they asked me to scan their minds. Everything they&#39;ve said is true.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone gathered now began to look one another over. For Mia, Ann, and Zack they began to have flashbacks of the war. &quot;As of right now,&quot; Kellie began. &quot;Both timelines are going to be working closely together. The leaders of the closest aloies of the wizards will be informed, Princesses Winery and Pyrrha will inform their royal houses of what was discussed. We&#39;ve also already been in contact with S.P.E.A.R.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats S.P.E.A.R,&quot; Rini asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strategic Paranormal Enforcement and Rescue,&quot; Akira stated. &quot;The government in the other timeline has established an organization within the government to track the supernatural.&quot; Ann now watched as Akira gestured towards a brunette woman in her late thirties. &quot;Director McMillan has offered her services in tracking down the Normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime,&quot; Kellie added. &quot;Darren and his friends will be staying with us. After much discussion it&#39;s been decided that they will be attending school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still think I should focus on the Normal,&quot; Darren stated. Kellie shaking her head no as she looked at Darren and his friends. &quot;We will be looking for them but the fact of the matter is you&#39;re only 15. You still need a proper education. Pretty sure if I talked with future Yuriko she would agree.&quot; Darren sighed, nodding as Kellie gazed out at everyone assembled. As Kellie now wished them luck, Ann and the others nervously gazed at one another. Freshman year was going to be memorable whether they liked it or not.</p>
