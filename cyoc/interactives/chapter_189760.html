<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How strange, why is she wearing a scarf even in all this heat? and on top of that she&#39;s wearing it so that it covers the entire bottom half of her face. But this hairstyle and eyes is her without a doubt.&quot; Amanda said and started walking, it was clear she was going to meet her friend when you heard her screaming Meg&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
Unlike what you expected, you didn&#39;t hear any response from your girlfriend&#39;s friend, instead Amanda started running.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meg, wait for me. Why are you running from me?&quot; your girlfriend said, which was enough for you to realize something was wrong.<br />
<br />
You had no idea how far they ran or where, but when Amanda finally stopped running you can be sure she had either grabbed or cornered Meg.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you have nowhere to run. Now can you tell me what the problem is? Why are you avoiding me?&quot; Amanda asked<br />
<br />
Once again you didn&#39;t hear any response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you crying Meg? Is the problem me by any chance?&quot; Amanda asked<br />
<br />
Once again you didn&#39;t hear anything, only a little later your girlfriend started to turn around but was stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter with you Meg? First you run away from me, then you refuse to talk to me and keep crying, now you won&#39;t let me go. After all do you want me to leave you alone or stay here?&quot; Amanda said<br />
<br />
Again you didn&#39;t hear any response, but something pressed you and then backed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s with this hug Meg? And why the scare? Ah, you felt my cock didn&#39;t you? The witch&#39;s curse has already taken its toll on me.&quot; your girfriend said<br />
<br />
Again there was silence, this time longer, until Amanda gave an expression of astonishment.<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t stand not knowing what was going on anymore and asked &quot;Amanda, what&#39;s the problem? Please tell me what&#39;s going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Meg, she was cursed too. Because of the curse she can no longer speak and is communicating via texts on her cell phone.&quot; Amanda said to you<br />
<br />
&quot;But didn&#39;t you say you protected your friends and received the curse in her place? So how is this possible?&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, she didn&#39;t tell me.&quot; your girlfriend said. I don&#39;t know, she didn&#39;t tell me. &quot;I&#39;m talking to my boyfriend.&quot; there was another silence while Meg typed &quot;I know you don&#39;t see him anywhere, but he&#39;s here. Unfortunately he ended up being involved in my curse and now he is my genitals. He might just be a dick now, but he&#39;s still aware of everything that goes on and can communicate with me. Only I can hear his voice and I hear him talking inside my head.&quot; your girlfriend said in reply.<br />
<br />
You then felt a pressure again, as Meg had hugged Amanda again. You then felt the space between the two bodies get tighter and tighter, only to notice right away that your girlfriend was getting turned on and you were getting hard. Your size beat the elastic of your underwear she was wearing and your tip came out over the top.<br />
<br />
You felt them break their embrace and your girlfriend said &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I haven&#39;t gotten used to this yet.&quot; <br />
<br />
You thought Meg was grossed out that your girlfriend got a hard-on while they hugged, but soon afterward you saw Amanda&#39;s skirt being lifted quickly, allowing you to finally see the alley you were in and what was going on. It was Meg who had lifted the skirt, she was looking at you with her face mostly covered by a scarf, allowing you to just see her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing Meg?&quot; Amanda asked<br />
<br />
Meg typed on her cell phone and showed it to your girlfriend, and you could also read that she said &quot;I&#39;m sorry but this is part of the curse the witch has placed on me, it&#39;s too strong for me to resist. Please don&#39;t resist.&quot; Then she took off her scarf, revealing that her mouth and nose were replaced by a vagina positioned vertically on her face. She bends down bringing the pussy on her face to you and puts you inside.<br />
<br />
Again unable to see anything, you heard your girlfriend&#39;s muffled moan as you were pushed deeper and deeper, until you felt your balls touch Amanda&#39;s friend&#39;s chin.<br />
<br />
At first Meg used you to fuck her pussyface like that was the only thing that mattered to her at the moment. After a while the movement changed and you were pretty sure it was Amanda who had taken over and was fucking her friend&#39;s face until you felt the pussy get tighter around you due to Meg&#39;s orgasm, you stopped totally inside, with part of you down the girl&#39;s throat, and all the cum traveled through you in your mutual orgasm with your girlfriend.<br />
<br />
After the orgasm your girlfriend pulled you out of her pussy on her friend&#39;s face, sitting on the floor to catch her breath and asked Meg why she did that. <br />
<br />
Meg said that due to the witch&#39;s curse her mind had been changed so that she would advance on someone&#39;s cock she noticed was hard, but that was not only instinctual for her now, it was also a necessity because she couldn&#39;t eat normal food anymore and survive only on the cum she swallowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is terrible, but when and why did the witch curse you like this?&quot;Amanda said<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a few days ago when I came home at night. She told me that she was sorry for the curse she had cast earlier while she was overcome with rage and was impressed that you stood as a shield and received the curse in our place, but she also said she was extremely angry that I didn&#39;t show any gratitude for you. defended us or worry about what might happen to you, so she followed me and cornered me to curse me while you weren&#39;t around, so you couldn&#39;t defend me. She applied a curse that she said was worse and more powerful than you received, and immediately my mouth and nose were replaced by the vagina you can see on my face. Then she explained to me about the physiological changes I explained earlier and disappeared saying that there was one more to be punished. I believe she teleported with her magic. It wasn&#39;t until I got home that I realized the other changes she had made to my body.&quot; Meg typed<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean there&#39;s more?&quot; you asked and Amanda forwarded your question to her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is, look.&quot; Meg typed, then put her cell phone aside and took off her shirt. She wasn&#39;t wearing a bra, but that didn&#39;t make any difference as her D-cup breasts had only smooth skin as her nipples had been completely removed. Then she took off her jeans, showing not only that she was without panties, but that the space between her legs, where her vagina should have been, had nothing but smooth skin, just like between her buttocks. She had gone totally genderless down there, no longer having a genital between her legs and no longer her anus. &quot;As you can see my whole body has gone smooth and the only way in and out of anything is through the vagina in my face.&quot; she completed<br />
<br />
&quot;It can&#39;t stay that way. We have to find this witch. I will tell her that I am not offended by anything and ask her to undo the curse she placed on you.&quot; Amanda said<br />
<br />
&quot;But where are we going to find her? I&#39;ve been looking for the witch since yesterday.&quot; Meg typed<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no idea either.&quot; Amanda said<br />
<br />
&quot;According to Meg, the witch said she had one more to be punished isn&#39;t it. Hadn&#39;t you protected another friend too?&quot;  you said<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, Laura. The person she said she would still punish must be Laura. Let&#39;s go after her Meg, if we&#39;re lucky we&#39;ll get to her before it&#39;s too late.&quot; your girlfriend said<br />
<br />
Agreeing, Meg put on her clothes and Amanda put you back in your underwear under her skirt, so the two went out to meet their other friend.</p>
