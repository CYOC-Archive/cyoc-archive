<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Young Pete Owens woke up feeling strange. That was putting it mildly. His body felt like it hadn&#39;t ever slept on a bed. The six year old moved about, which didn&#39;t help the strange feeling. It was like half his body wasn&#39;t even on the bed at the moment. He turned to the side and opened his eyes to look at his older brother Christian and the strangeness continued. He blinked several times and yet the scene did not change. What greeted his sight was not his older brother Christian, but his older cousin Kristen. Only she was wearing Christian clothes, a white T-shirt and blue sweats, her nipples partially visible through the shirt. Pete turned around quickly at the sight and covered his mouth so he wouldn&#39;t scream. The strangeness continued with that as he felt something fuzzy over his chin. He rubbed it some more and now fully awake notices his hands were huge. It wasn&#39;t only his hands, but his entire body. He finally realized why his body felt strange. His arms and legs were dangling completely off the bed. And not only that he was completely naked! A huge wiener, ramrod straight, hit his sight. He got off the bed best he could and eyed his body again. He looked down and saw the remnants of his clothes, a Spider-man onesie strewn across the floor. <br />
<br />
In shock, he made the way best he could to the bathroom. It was eerily quiet. Evidentially he was the first one up. Closing the door behind, he went towards the mirror. &quot;Daddy...?&quot; he croaked out. His voice was deep and his father in the mirror had moved his mouth the same time he did. He waved his arms and his dad in the mirror did too. He rubbed his chin. Same thing. Touched his muscular chest. Same. His eight pack abs. You get the drill. He looked back down to see the same huge, hard penis. His father in the mirror sported the same thing. He could deny it no longer. He had become his Dad. &quot;Holy crud! I&#39;m... I&#39;m Daddy... Holy crud...&quot; <br />
<br />
Realizing what this meant, he made his way fast, yet quietly to his parents room. He opened the door and laid his sight on the room&#39;s occupants. Could he say his parents? Because the people laying in bed didn&#39;t look like them at least. As he thought, in place of his Dad was his old six year old body. His Dad&#39;s boxers and socks were off his body near the edge of the bed. His black T-Shirt hid the rest of his body from view. And to his side was his Mom, or at least it should have been. Because who was there now was his grandfather wearing his Mom&#39;s purple one-piece lingerie. He was starting to understand what was going on. He left the room. <br />
<br />
The next closest was his brother Mason&#39;s room. He opened the door and what greeted him was something he didn&#39;t expect. His brother&#39;s clothes, a wife beater, shorts and boxers were strewn across the bed and on said bed was his dog Sparky, the miniature Schnauzer  laid out on the bed like a human. &quot;Holy...&quot; Pete started to say, but covered his mouth before it could come out. He looked back and it seemed Mason(?) hadn&#39;t woken up. Thank god for his new deep voice. He left the room and went back to the living room. Sure enough in the dog bed was his brother Mason. He was of course, butt naked. Sparky&#39;s collar was still on his neck somehow which told Pete that his dog was now a human being. <br />
<br />
Not wanting to see his naked brother&#39;s body. Pete turned towards the next closest room, which housed his cousins Ashton and Bryce along with Bryce&#39;s bed friend Nathan who was living with the Owens while his parents were out on a business trip. Speaking of Nathan he was... unchanged. Though considering there were an odd amount of living beings in the house, made sense. The same could not be said of the cousins. In Bryce&#39;s place was the Uncle Zachary. Like Pete, his clothes were in taters although his Super-man underwear was somehow hanging on by a thread. Not that it did much to hide the huge straight penis sticking out from the top. Meanwhile Ashton was the Aunt Denise. His clothes, a white T-Shirt and white briefs were still in tact, although it did nothing to hide the huge breasts that were threatening to spill from their white confines. <br />
<br />
Next was Kristen&#39;s room and like he thought, his brother Christian was now there sporting a purple tank-top and black skirt sporting a bulge. He closed the door and then went to his Aunt and Uncle&#39;s room. He saw Ashton&#39;s body in the place of his Aunt. She had only wore a bra and panties to bed so those were strewn across the bed, leaving Ashton&#39;s naked body. There was a white liquid dribbling from the penis and was all over the bed. Confused and weirded out, he turned towards his Uncle, now Bryce who had went into bed with just his boxers on so he was also naked, covered with the white liquid too. Not wanting to be here any longer, he moved back out and went to his grandfather&#39;s room. He knew what to expect and sure enough, his Mom&#39;s body was there now, sporting a wife beater and boxers. Her breasts spilled out from its confines and there was a wet spot on the boxers. Did his grandfather pee himself in his transformation?<br />
<br />
After taking in the sight of everything, some things his six year old brain shouldn&#39;t have knowledge of yet, the adventurous boy turned man took stock of what he had seen: <br />
<br />
Dad:Himself<br />
Mom:Grandfather<br />
Mason:Sparky<br />
Christian:Kristen<br />
Himself:Dad<br />
Uncle Zachary:Bryce<br />
Aunt Denise:Ashton<br />
Ashton:Aunt Denise<br />
Kristen:Christian<br />
Bryce:Uncle Zachary<br />
Grandfather:Mom<br />
Nathan:Unchanged<br />
Sparky:Mason<br />
<br />
&quot;This is gonna be so confusing!&quot; Pete thought. He went back to his parents room and took a deep breath. He had to do this. Steeling himself, he went up to his Dad. &quot;Daddy.... Daddy, wake up.&quot; He saw his father open his eyes and blink several times. &quot;What a weird dream...&quot; he finally said closing his eyes. Pete sighed. &quot;Daddy, this isn&#39;t a dream!&quot; he whisper shouted. He did not want to wake up the entire house at once. His dad opened his eyes again and after blinking a few times, scrambled himself up. &quot;What the fuck...&quot; he whispered as he stared at a naked and erect him looking back. He looked down at himself and saw he was tiny. He looked to his wife and his father was there wearing his wife&#39;s clothes. &quot;Aggggghhhh!!&quot; he yelled out. &quot;What the devil?!&quot; his wife(?) shouted as she saw her naked husband and son draped in her husband&#39;s shirt. &quot;Ahhhhhhhhh!!&quot; She yelled out. Looking at each other, &quot;AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!&quot; husband and wife yelled again. So much for not waking up the whole house.</p>
