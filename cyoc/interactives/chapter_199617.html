<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex had been led through the palace, blindfolded, his vision nothing but flecks of light through the dark fabric, his hands restrained behind his back, as Alex moved his hands he could feel the rough cool metal around his wrists, they had handcuffed him, he walked and listened, a guards arm looped around looped around both of his, guiding him to where they wanted him.<br />
<br />
Alex then heard the sound of a small wooden door opening as he was led inside, based on how the sound dampened from the hallways echo, this room must have meen much smaller, hemis head was then yanked back as the blindfold was removed, assaulting his eyes with the sudden light.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where-where am I?&quot; Asked Alex, looking around at the small square room, the walls and floor made of rough sandstone, with sand and dirt scattered accross the floor, one side of the room had a rectangular shelf that was made of the same sandstone, stretching from wall to wall, must be some sort of seat or bedding area for prisoners.<br />
<br />
Alex was then shoved into the room, his handcuffs now loose as he turned to the guards &quot;why am I here, I have done nothing wrong&quot; Shouted Alex, but both guards stared blankly at him as they closed the door behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remove&quot; spoke one of the guards, her voice light yet firm, Alex looked at her in confusion &quot;Remove, you speak our language do you not&quot; she said, pointing at Alex, it was then that Alex looked down at what was left of his clothing, his jeans and shirt burned and shredded, not to mention unusually tight fitting and too short on his body, he then looked up at the two women in shock &quot;oh no, nonono that ain&#39;t happening ladies&quot; he said as he began backing away from the guards.<br />
<br />
However the two women were surprisingly fast as they lunged at Alex and ripped his tattered clothing from his body, leaving him bare, it was then that Alex got a good look at his body and how it had changed. He was absolutely jacked, his stomach flat and toaned like stone, his pex solid and wide, his barrel shaped torso now covered in muscle, his sholders were broarder and his biceps had swolen to that of a heavy weight wrestler, his forearms were no different, solid and huge, making him look like he could go toe to toe with a gorilla.<br />
<br />
His boxers were barely holding on, ripped and burned as they clung to his muscular thighs, but what both Alex and the guards had taken notice of was the incredibly noticeable bulge in the fabric, the monster hisning underneath was easily twelve inches as it strained its fabric confines.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmmm, well it looks like my avatars little friend wants to play&quot; came Tawaretes voice, Alex spun to see her suddenly apear on the stone bed, lazily leaning back, one hand behind her head, and the other draped 9ver her swolen belly, &quot;I see your getting accustomed to the improvements I&#39;ve made, sooo what do you think?&quot; Sha asked.<br />
<br />
Alex once again looked himself over, flexing his new muscle mass, getting used to how he moved now &quot;I can definitely work with this, if you can do THIS then I&#39;m looking forward to the future&quot; he said with a grin.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he looked back up at the guards, one of them looking at him in confusion, probably thinking he was talking to himself, while the other had her arms extended out, looking at Alex with a lustful look as she bit the corner of her lip, in her arms looked to be some kind if robe, white with black reed&#39;s along its base, as well as a pair if silver cuffs, however unlike the handcuffs, they had no chains, instead each had a khopesh engraved into the underside of where the wrist would go.<br />
<br />
Alex grabbed the clothing and pulled it to his chest, still feeling the mettal dagger that hung from his neck, however as he pulled the clothing away, he felt the guards silky fingers trace up and back along his arm, a slight moan escaping her lips before her other guard pulled her back as they turned away from him.<br />
<br />
Once dressed in his new robe Alex turned to Tawarete who seemed impressed by his appearance, giving him a small applause &quot;looking much better now, your dressed for a proper audience with pharaoh Amunet&quot; she said as she suddenly appeared at his side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah iv got a few questions for her let&#39;s go&quot; he said as he stormed towards the door, now determined to find out why he had been put here, the guards suddenly lunged at him, each wrapping their arms around his and began to pull him down, yet he didn&#39;t budge, he only kept storming forward, both women now heaving with all their might to pull him yo the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;With my strength they may as well be pebbles trying to take down a mountain&quot; said Tawarete as she kept pace with Alex, after a few turns and dead ends He decided that getting directions would be better than wandering this maze like palace blind, should he run into the entire palace guard he doubted even Tawaretes strength would keep him standing from a spear.<br />
<br />
So Alex decided to change tactics as he brought both women infront of him as he gave them both a kind smile &quot;sorry about this lady&#39;s, I know your doing your job but I really need you to just show me the way&quot;<br />
Upon the words &#39;show me the way&#39; left his mouth, once again glowing hieroglyphics flew from his mouth, hovering above his head, before surfing to dust infront of the two women, the sand like dust being inhaled through their noses as they suddenly stopped struggling.<br />
<br />
Then they began walking away from him, when Alex guessed they realised he wasn&#39;t following they turned back to him, their eyes glowing white as they beckoned him &quot;well what are you waiting for, follow them&quot; said Tawarete, her breath whistling past Alex&#39;s head as she spoke into his ear, so Alex began to follow his guides.<br />
<br />
After a few turns and corridors The two guards suddenly stopped infront of a large wooden door, it&#39;s surface painted white with large black jackals painted on the doors, their paws over the handles, both guards suddenly shook their heads and looked around in confusion when Alex suddenly came up behind both of them, taking a chance at grabbing their plump soft assess, getting a sudden moan from both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for showing me the way, you&#39;ve both been most helpfull&quot; he whispered in their ears, giving both of them a kiss on the cheek as he shoved the doors to the throne room wide open...</p>
