<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Jennifer, Kyle and Ms. Davidson were busy plotting away, events transpired on the other side of Glendale...<br />
<br />
Having heard Brody's voice mutter &quot;Hello?&quot;, Sam immediately hung up, wracked with doubt. But the hateful tinge he heard in Jen's voice reminded him how badly he needed a devoted ally. And Brody knew so much that he had to deal with him somehow. Sam stomped with anger and confusion across the street. He tracked down Brody's address from the white pages in a nearby phone booth and swiftly advanced there.<br />
He stopped outside, his heart racing. Why am I doing this? he asked himself. He snuck into the back yard and looked up at the bedroom windows. Judging by the posters and messiness he could dimly make out from below, one was a teenage boy's room. A large tree nestled close to the slightly ajar window. Sam was a rotten climber, but he wanted to catch Brody unaware and get an edge on him.<br />
He silently went up the tree, looked in the window and did a double take. Brody was lying naked on his bed, masturbating furiously. Eyes closed, and toes clenched, and with each jerk he seemed to be sighing &quot;Oh Sam&quot;. <br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; said Sam. He grinned wolfishly as Brody jacknifed up with shock and stared google-eyed at the window. His shock relaxed into a smile of contentment. &quot;You came Sam!&quot; he cooed. &quot;You came!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah. Let me in already. I can't hold on to this tree forever.&quot;<br />
Brody dutifully opened the window and Sam crawled through. He fell onto the bed. Brody stood over him and he sat up, averting his eyes from the boy's male bits. <br />
&quot;Oh, sorry&quot; Brody said bashfully. &quot;I'll go throw something on.&quot; He hurriedly pulled on jeans and a t-shirt and sat down next to Sam. Sam stood up.<br />
&quot;Look Brody, I'm sure you're a really nice guy. And I'm sorry for cursing you out after you...uhm...were nice to me. And I'll even admit that I sorta enjoyed what we did together.&quot;<br />
&quot;So did I!&quot; laughed Brody. &quot;You were so magnificent! I mean, what are you anyway, a werewolf who transforms when he's horny?&quot;<br />
&quot;Err..you could say that.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, am I making you...aroused?&quot; His hand crept toward Sam's zipper.<br />
&quot;STOP THAT!&quot; yelled Sam, pushing him away. &quot;Don't try that fag stuff! I didn't come here because I wanted to be your fucking boyfriend. I came cause you got something on me! That's all! So name your price for not telling everyone that I'm a fuckin' manwolf and I'll do whatever! Just keep your mouth shut!&quot;<br />
Brody stiffened as if he'd just been hit. His face was pale.<br />
&quot;Is--is that it? You thought I'd blackmail you? You thought I'd tell everyone? How could--I--&quot; he broke off and tried to regain his composure. &quot;I'd never have done such a thing. I'd never have done anything to hurt you. If you didn't want to be with me, I'd just accept it. But all I wanted was to be near you. I watched you every period in English class, even if you never knew I existed. I'd do anything for you. Anything in the world.&quot;<br />
His eyes by now were welling up and Sam, by now very uncomfortable, sat down next to him and put his hand on Brody's shoulder.<br />
&quot;Brody--listen...I didn't mean to be such a prick. I was just so stressed and jumpy about the situation I was in. I'm sorry for what I said. I'm in deep trouble, and I need someone I can stand by.&quot;<br />
Brody looked up. &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
Sam nodded. &quot;It's a really long story. I'll just put it this way: I like what I am very much, but someone wants to change all that.&quot;<br />
And, Sam thought to himself, with Brody as my devotee, he won't blab to anyone my secret. I'd better butter him up if I want his help.<br />
&quot;So I need someone who can help me. And maybe I can help you in return...&quot; God, he thought, how do I flirt with this guy? He put his hand up to Brody's armpit and tickled him. Brody began giggling and began wrestling with Sam's arm. Sam wrestled back, and soon the two were locked in play-combat. They rolled off the bed and into a fit of laughter upon hitting the carpet. Brody somehow managed to pin Sam down. Sam grabbed Brody's crotch. The gambit worked--Brody loosened with surprise and Sam turned the tables. <br />
&quot;Gotcha&quot; he laughed. The two, by now exhausted, lay side by side on the floor, panting for air. Brody began panting like a dog and licked Sam across the face. &quot;Eugghh!&quot; Sam squealed, &quot;now you're getting it!&quot; He pinned Brody down and licked him back before realizing just what he'd done. &quot;Sorry about the slobber&quot; he said confusedly. <br />
&quot;That's fine Sam--you're the werewolf.&quot;<br />
&quot;But not now...&quot;<br />
&quot;Pretty soon man. Feel your face.&quot;<br />
Sam put his hand up and felt additional stubble on his face. He felt slightly stronger as well. Now he was getting a little spooked. He'd better get down to business.<br />
&quot;Brody, I need you to do a really big favor for me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Name it.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm going to ask you a certain question, and I want you to take the first option offered to you.&quot;<br />
Brody stood up, while Sam sat on the bed. <br />
&quot;Shoot&quot; said the former.<br />
&quot;Transform or dare!&quot;<br />
&quot;Dare!&quot; laughed Brody.<br />
&quot;Brody!! I told you to pick transform!&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Sam, I didn't think you were serious. I thought the whole thing was an old wives's tale! You're not really a werewolf because of THAT, are you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I am. Now pay attention. I dare you to ask me the question back. That way I can ask it back to you. I really need you to do this Brody.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay Sam. I don't know what I'm getting into, but I'll trust you. But could we maybe...do something before that...I mean, you kind of owe me a return favor in a way...&quot; He slowly unzipped his pants.<br />
Sam inwardly groaned. Oh well, he thought. He's a nice guy. It wouldn't hurt to please him. Once.&quot;<br />
Brody let down his pants, revealing an average sized penis. Sam rather stiffly advanced toward it and took hold of it. <br />
&quot;Uhm... you want it in my mouth?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;oh. okay.&quot; Sam clumsily began sucking on the hard member. He could feel his own body responding. He felt a sudden flush of warmth spread through him as his muscles began bulging through his arms and legs. His hands looked gawkier and his nails lengthened. His feet were growing longer and longer, and he soon had to kick off his flip-flops. His shirt collar nestled against a growing sprout of hair, and the room's smells were suddenly much stronger. <br />
Oh God he thought. It's turning me on. <br />
Brody looked on with delight and his hands ruffled Sam's darkening hair. Sam's face steadily grew coarser and rougher edged, from his now pointy ears to his more-prominent nose. <br />
The stiches in Sam's shirt began snapping; his exposed arms were already blanketed by swatches of hair. His jeans were now too short and fraying at the cuffs. Sam's eyes were turning yellow, his chest heaving and body throbbing, bristling with hair. <br />
Brody neared orgasm, and then pushed Sam's head so that the latter's mouth enveloped Brody's spurting phallus. Sam, shocked that he was ingesting cum, nearly gagged.<br />
Brody grinned wickedly and said &quot;Transform or dare!&quot;<br />
Sam couldn't answer since he was hacking and coughing on the sperm.<br />
Brody struck: &quot;Transform--so that you're GAY!!&quot;<br />
Sam, semi-feral, reeled back in horror. And then suddenly his horror disappeared...</p>
