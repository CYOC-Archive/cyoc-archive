<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Boy, I&#39;m bad at writing on a schedule.  Then again, my schedule is crazy!  Too much time has been spent by me playing Animal Crossing.  But, that time has been spent thinking of how to continue the story.  Here&#39;s the next chapter of Tales of the Arcane!<br />
<br />
Also, sorry about the chapter option not reflecting what this chapter is about.  I changed what I was going to write about part way through, and forgot to change the chapter option...  I did a dumb.  Oops.<br />

<br />
&quot;I know you are the King of Dragons now, but you still need to be my familiar.&quot;  Rowan started.  &quot;Remember this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know Master!&quot;  You interrupted.  &quot;My subjects are important, but you are more.  You didn&#39;t have to tell me that Master!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t think I would.  I just wanted to make sure.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;Anyway, I want to make sure that my subjects won&#39;t try to rebel to much.  If they do, I won&#39;t have any left!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s an issue, considering your reputation.&quot;  You started, speaking in a worrisome tone.  &quot;Have you made any public appearances to the people yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Addressing them all formally?&quot;  He asked.  &quot;I did try that, but that didn&#39;t go over very well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you should try your hardest to get the people to like you!&quot;  You suggested.  &quot;Pass friendly laws, don&#39;t kill everyone who defies you immediately, that sort of thing!  Worst comes to worst, make them respect you.  Don&#39;t forget that I have an army of dragons at my disposal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the tips Gannoth.  This is why I need you.&quot;  Rowan smiled, patting your shoulder.  &quot;Let&#39;s go to the bedroom.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re tired.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot;  You said, walking with Rowan to the bedroom you&#39;ve been craving for so long.  Sleeping in the woods was not very comfortable, and you missed your bed dearly.  You changed into your dragon form and curled into the bed.  &quot;I missed you bed!&quot;  You yelled happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get comfy, not that it&#39;ll be difficult.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;I have a story to tell you.&quot;  Rowan sat near you bed on a chair.  You lifted your head onto his lap, and he proceeded to pet it like you would a dog.  It was a comforting feeling.  &quot;Ready?&quot;<br />

<br />
November 4, 695<br />
<br />
&quot;He likes you too much.&quot;  Rowan smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Master!&quot;  You smiled, heading out of the castle.  Rowan watched you saunter out of the castle, before growing and taking off to the skies.  Once the doors were closed, Rowan immediately slumped over and sat on the floor.  Once again, he was alone.  He was very good at hiding his true loneliness from you.  Now that you were gone, he let it all out.  He started to cry, realizing how lonely he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rowan!  Pull yourself together!&quot;  A voice called out to him.  It was Zebulon.  &quot;What are you doing sitting and crying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gannoth went on a personal journey, and I forced myself to let him go alone.  He needs the growth.&quot;  Rowan explained.  &quot;But I&#39;m so lonely without him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rowan.&quot;  Zebulon continued, appearing before Rowan.  &quot;I know that this immortality has been difficult for you.  You spent 29 years alone.  And, now that you gained someone to fill that void, he&#39;s gone.  He&#39;ll be gone for a while too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot;  Rowan panted, the crying turning into heavy breathing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, you can talk to him whenever you want.&quot;  Zebulon stated.  &quot;Remember your telepathy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Your Grace.&quot;  Rowan faintly smiled, starting to regain his composure.  &quot;May I ask why you are here, Your Grace?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, your wanton destruction won&#39;t get you very far.&quot;  Zebulon started.  &quot;What&#39;s the point of being an all-powerful sorcerer in a barren wasteland?  There will be nothing to do.  Nothing to rule.  Rather than destroying, why not do what your familiar suggested?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot;  Rowan asked confusedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take over.&quot;  Zebulon laughed.  &quot;Rule the world, and rule it with an iron fist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, I&#39;m not a ruler.&quot;  Rowan sighed.  &quot;I&#39;m a Herald of Destruction.  Very few mortals have laid their eyes on me and lived to tell the tale.  I&#39;ve destroyed two kingdoms!  How could I rule?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rowan.  You have a great destiny.&quot;  Zebulon smiled.  &quot;You are not like Falcour.  You are not meant to spread destruction like he was.  You may be a reincarnation of him, but that does not make you him.  He was wrong.  The Gods were wrong.  I was even wrong.  Rowan, your destiny is to not rule the world, but to become a God.  And not just a God, but the only God.  Along with Gannoth, you will rule over existence, be worshiped, and shape the planes as you will it.  If you are going to do that, you should at least learn how to rule a kingdom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?  Rule over the planes?&quot;  Rowan asked.  &quot;Why is my power so destructive if I&#39;m destroying that which I am supposed to rule?  Why am I so attuned with something so evil?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rowan.  Power comes in many forms.  You will soon learn so much more.  The fact that you are the reincarnation of Falcour is what caused you to become so learned in dark, evil magic.  This magic has corrupted you, made you think evilly, and caused the Gods to worry.  I thought that you would be my ticket to finally overthrowing them.  But, there was something strange about you.  I gave you that ring because I thought you were just going to be a second Falcour.  Yet, you were not.  You weren&#39;t crazy.  You never went around the kingdoms to kill.  You studied, rarely using your power against others in an unprovoked fashion.  Yet, you were convinced that you were the most evil being alive.  You convinced yourself that you were the bringer of chaos, and convinced your familiar that you were too.  You even convinced both me and the Gods.  Yet, I noticed something strange.  When I gave you that demonic ring, it was supposed to fill you with dark, demonic power.  While it did, turning you demonic in the process, I sensed something else happening.  Remember your transformation?&quot;  Zebulon asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.  It was incredibly painful and intense.&quot;  Rowan replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I realized why.&quot;  Zebulon started explaining.  &quot;You weren&#39;t filled with just demonic power, like your familiar.  Somehow, the ring triggered a rush of divine power.  This clashed with the demonic power of the ring, and the demonic power won.  In the end, you did not gain the divine power, and instead gained the demonic power of the ring.  When I sensed this, I wasn&#39;t sure what happened, and needed time to think it over.  While I was, you used your newfound power to destroy Kitria.  After you did, I visited the barren wasteland that you created, and confirmed my beliefs.  I felt a huge mixture of magical powers there.  I felt dark magic, demonic magic, divine magic, natural magic, corruption, fel, and so many others.  Rowan, putting on that ring caused you to start becoming what you are truly destined to be.  A sorcerer so in tune with magic that he will master all types of magic, and become a being so powerful that the Gods and I will become insignificant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;  Rowan said dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, did you notice that you&#39;ve been having trouble sleeping recently, been losing your appetite, or anything else strange?&quot;  Zebulon asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I did.&quot;  Rowan answered.  &quot;Does this mean anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Rowan.  It means that you are becoming a True Immortal.&quot;  Zebulon explained.  &quot;Before, you did not age, and due to your magic, you were nearly invincible.  Yes, you were immortal, but you could still be killed like Falcour.  Now, you&#39;ve ascended beyond that.  A truly immortal being, such as a God or powerful Demon, does not require that which normal mortals require.  Food, sleep, breathing, and many other things are not required by beings like us.  On top of this, a truly immortal being has regenerative properties.  Watch.&quot;  As soon as Zebulon finished his sentence, he scratched Rowan&#39;s hand with a claw.  Rowan, expecting to feel excruciating pain, was surprised to feel no pain.  Just a slight scratch.  Rowan looked at his hand, noticing the open wound closing itself up very quickly.  Within a couple of seconds, it was like nothing had happened.  &quot;Rowan.  You are more powerful than you realize.  Yes, I am ruler of the demons, and demons are naturally evil, but as a friend, please decide what you will use your power for.  You do not need to be a bringer of destruction.  You don&#39;t need to kill everyone.  It may feel enjoyable, but think about your future as a ruler.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Your Grace.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;I&#39;ll use this time to figure out who I truly am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please do.  You will not be able to further your destiny until you do.&quot;  Zebulon stated.  &quot;No matter which path you choose, you will have my support.  Farewell, Lord Tyrell.&quot;  Zebulon disappeared from Rowan&#39;s sight.  Now, once again, Rowan was alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Figure out who I truly am?&quot;  Rowan asked himself.  &quot;How?&quot;  Rowan pondered this task for hours.  Who was he.  Who did he want to be?  Did he want to be the demonic sorcerer that he was, destroying the very world he seemed to be destined to rule over?  No, he would say to himself.  He started to recall his more monstrous moments.  Consuming the souls of those he killed, destroying the lives of so many people.  The sheer weight of the situation was unbearable.  He needed to figure out how to cope with this sudden change in perspective.<br />
<br />
While out on a walk, he noticed a large, colorful burst of fiery magic in the sky.  He immediately recognized it as your&#39;s. &quot;Gannoth?&quot; Rowan asked you telepathically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master?&quot; You replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that big explosion in the sky?&quot; He asked. &quot;I know it was you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a little girl dragon who wanted to see my magic. That&#39;s all.&quot; You answered with a slight laugh. &quot;Still making my way to the leader of this community of dragons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Rowan responded. &quot;Just wanted to make sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, bye Master. Need to overthrow dragon kings now...&quot; You said, leaving the telepathic chat.  The short exchange made Rowan realize something.  Now that he had you, he would never be alone.  His soul and yours were intertwined.  Part of you would always be him.  That thought put a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gannoth.  I know you will not hear this, but thank you.  I think I know who I will be.  And I think you helped me realize this.&quot;  Rowan smiled to himself, as he walked to his library to find a book to read.<br />
<br />
