<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;So I guess I won&#39;t be seeing my brother tonight&#39; said Mary. She was amused by the situation. <br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m old!&#39; complained Mike who by now was in possession of Sharon&#39;s voice. <br />
<br />
&#39;36 isn&#39;t old. Just be glad you didn&#39;t swap bodies with Grandma&#39; chuckled Mary.<br />
<br />
&#39;Well you make me look ridiculous wearing that cheerleader costume. We had better use that toilet block and swap clothes&#39; said Sharon who was now looking like Mary&#39;s twin.<br />
<br />
Reluctantly Mike complied. She also had to get her make-up redone. As the true Sharon applied concealer on Mike&#39;s crows-feet she explained that she never went out without her face. At least Mike no longer had to wear a dress, though the jeans Sharon made her put on didn&#39;t do anything to hide her empty crotch. She also had to put on a lacy white camisole top under the the silk shirt. And the new Michelle also insisted Mike adorn herself with her jewellery, including dangly earrings. Even though she wasn&#39;t in a dress it was still very feminine attire.<br />
<br />
They emerged from the toilet block just in time for two cars carrying more of the cheerleading team pulled into the same rest stop. &#39;Look who it is&#39; said Mary quietly as she bought the new arrivals to the attention of Mike. &#39;Just as well you didn&#39;t change back into yourself. It might have been hard to explain why my sister had disappeared&#39;<br />
<br />
By now they had been spotted by Tracey and Mina, who in turn were pointing them out to a second vehicle. From that vehicle Tom, Alistair, Alistair&#39;s Mum and Coach got out. Needless to say there was another round of greetings. It was as if they hadn&#39;t spent enough time together over the last few days.<br />
<br />
It was the new &quot;Michelle&quot; who said loud enough for Mike to hear &#39;We can join you for dinner after all. My uncle Mike is otherwise occupied, so we no longer have to visit him&#39; Mike turned to look at her and caught her fluttering her eyes at Tom.<br />
<br />
&#39;I just wanted to get home as quickly as possible&#39; Mike uttered in Sharon&#39;s voice. It came out more quietly than she was planning. <br />
<br />
&#39;Oh come on Mom. Don&#39;t be a spoilsport. It&#39;s a long drive and you are going to need to have a rest somewhere&#39; &quot;Michelle&quot; said<br />
<br />
&#39;Yeah why not Mom? You were telling us how you got on so well with the other Mom&#39;s&#39; said Mary. Mike was clearly outvoted.<br />
<br />
&#39;We were just going to all meet up at McDonalds at Bracksville. Not any where expensive&#39; said Tracey quietly in Mike&#39;s ear. That was a town about an hour further down the road. Tracey must have known that Sharon was a single Mom who was looking for a job and that money was tight.<br />
.....<br />
<br />
Mike and Mary had both recently acquired their learner drivers permits but had not practiced much. Neither had driven on a highway. Mike drove out of the rest stop  with &quot;Michelle&quot; sitting in the front seat and instructing her. She hoped no-one noticed that she almost stalled the car. Five minutes down the road they swapped seats. If they got pulled over &quot;Michelle&quot; would produce Mary&#39;s learners permit.<br />
<br />
All of the team showed up at McDonalds. Mike sat with the mothers while the team sat at a different table. Mike had to tell a white lie and say she had a bit of a headache when she couldn&#39;t follow the conversation. Evidently it was a continuation of a conversation from earlier in the day. Mike also found out that Tracey&#39;s family owned a restaurant in town and Tracey thought she might be able to get Sharon a job as a casual waitress. That was news to Mike. Sharon had not said anything in the car.<br />
<br />
Back in the car &quot;Michelle&quot; continued to drive. She seemed to be very happy. She was very chatty and was constantly asking about other members of the cheerleading team. She admitted it was great fun to be a teenager once more. Mike was caught off guard when suddenly the conversation came back to the double (or triple) date that had been arranged for Wednesday night. Sharon declared &#39;It&#39;s going to go ahead&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No!&#39; said Mike &#39;No way!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t get your knickers in a knot &quot;Mom&quot;. Hear me out&#39; declared Sharon &#39;I will be Michelle once more come Wednesday night&#39;<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s immediate feeling was relief.<br />
<br />
They arrived home safely at about 9pm. Everyone was tired. Mike knew she couldn&#39;t change again until about 4.30 am so was resigned to going to bed in her mothers body. She happily accepted Sharon&#39;s offer to take the master bedroom. &quot;Michelle&quot; accompanied her to the room with the excuse of showing Mike her bedtime routine, That consisted of removing the make-up and applying moisturizing cream. However once they were alone in Sharon&#39;s ensuite, she instructed Mike on how to put a sanitary pad into her panties. <br />
<br />
&#39;Ew! Do I have to?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m sorry Mike but I would strongly advise it. Giving birth naturally to twins left me with a weak pelvic floor, so unless you want to risk leaking I suggest you wear this&#39;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t actually as uncomfortable as Mike was expecting. To be honest once it was in place it was very easy to forget about it. Speaking of comfortable, Sharon&#39;s queen bed made with silk sheets felt so soft and luxurious. Mike had to admit that the feeling of the silk sheets rubbing against the chemise she was wearing was quite a turn on. She tried to resist exploring her mothers body but failed. She had thought &quot;Michelle&#39;s&quot; nipples were big but Mom&#39;s were at a different level. When gently touched they grew out by over half an inch.<br />
<br />
However she was genuinely tired and soon went to the land of nod.</p>
