<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sitting within the cozy library of the kitsune castle, Kari and Stella now perused the ancient history books of the kitsune.<br />
<br />
Since the end of the war, both Fukushu and Abolith began to open to the idea of their children interacting with their cousins. While Fukushu trained Raiden in combat with Mason, Stella found herself trained by her mother. Today though, Stella found herself with Kari.<br />
<br />
Shizen asked that Stella be taught the history of the kitsune as well as the skills Abolith passed on. Never one to dwell on history, Abolith reluctantly approached Kari asking the three tail kitsune to to teach the young elf girl. The cousins, now read together, the young elf girl screwing up her face as she brushed her red and black hair behind her pointed ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;So the kitsune didn&#39;t always live here?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Kari replied. &quot;Following the end of the Imjin War in 1598, the kitsune began to relocate here. The war against the Kumiho left Tatsu disgusted by the mortal realm. For centuries, the kitsune served the Emperor of Japan yet when Tatsu wished to push further, the Emperor abandoned the mission. The war led to a crisis within Japan, the Emperors war became unpopular, leaving him exposed to enemies at home. Tatsu&#39;s vengeance felt incomplete.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because of what happened to dad&#39;s teacher?&quot; Stella stated.<br />
<br />
Kari paused, glancing at the young elf girl. &quot;How do you know about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom told me about her,&quot; Stella stated. &quot;When mom and dad met, she was the protector of the kitsune. Mom says she was kind yet stern. I guess she was the one that encouraged dad to take care of mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had no idea,&quot; Kari replied. &quot;What else did you hear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom respected her,&quot; Stella said. &quot;And dad saw her as a big sister. I think her name was Akane. From what mom said a lot of her early training was with her. When mom talks about her, it&#39;s one of the few times I see her smile. She was really sad when she died.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari nodded, a small smile spreading across her face. In all honesty while she enjoyed learning of kitsune history, she knew so little of both Fukushu and Abolith. The pair were feared throughout the supernatural realms. Fukushu, the fearsome, violent, kitsune general known for his strength, magic, tactics and numerous nicknames. Abolith, perhaps the deadliest assassin in the world, having few rivals. For centuries the elf operated in the shadows, altering the course of history with their actions. Still, on a personal level, nearly no one knew anything about the pair.<br />
<br />
&quot;How come my mom never talks about the elves?&quot; Stella asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry?&quot; Kari asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The elves,&quot; Stella repeated. &quot;I mean I&#39;ve read about the kitsune, but never anything about elves. Mom is the only other elf I know. I know they have a realm of their own, but we never go there. Do you know why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari shrugged, she wasn&#39;t exactly sure why Abolith refused to talk about elves, but she had heard rumors. Those rumors were too dark to tell to her younger cousin. Although Stella was in her early teens, she was still quite young, only beginning to take her first steps into adulthood. Like kitsune, elves aged slowly. The difference being elves reached maturity faster than kitsune before their aging slowed to a crawl. Still, telling a 14 year old elf girl that their were rumors her mother had been a slave seemed inappropriate.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I knew Stella.&quot; Kari replied.<br />
<br />
Stella nodded, letting out a long sigh as she turned her gaze back to the book.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I tell you something?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really hate that my mom seems so sad all the time,&quot; Stella said. &quot;I know she&#39;s scary and a fearsome warrior, but she always has this sad look on her face. Like, she&#39;s worried something bad is going to happen to me and Raiden.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s kind of a mom thing,&quot; Kari smiled. &quot;Trust me I have two of them. They always worry about me and my siblings and we&#39;re adults. It&#39;s out of love. She loves you two so much that she worries about what life would be like without you. I saw my moms do that anytime one of us was out past curfew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; Stella said, the elf girls shoulders slumping. &quot;I just wish she would smile more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari now pondered what Stella said, her mind racing as she thought of a way to make the stoic assassin smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;When I was young I used to draw pictures for my moms when they had a bad day. Maybe, you could draw her a picture.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Stella shrugged. &quot;Do you think it could work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a feeling even your mom would smile if you drew her a picture.&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing on the parapet, Abolith stared out at the setting sun. Since the conclusion of the civil war Abolith watched dignitaries and other kitsune officials enter the capital. These meetings seemed endless as Tatsu and Shizen talked and entertained for hours. Abolith, never one for the procedures of the court, spent her time either seeking work in the mortal realm or monitoring the unrest within the kitsune realm.<br />
<br />
Pockets of resistance still remained inside the kitsune kingdom. Embers of resistance that Abolith worried could eventually become the flames of revolution. She disagreed with Tatsu and Shizen capitulating to their defeated foes. Instead, Abolith felt that these embers should be crushed out, to insure the safety of her children.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fools,&quot; she grumbled, watching as yet another set of dignitaries exited the castle. So far the only diplomat she cared for was Lady Odayakana. The two tailed vixen was intelligent, possessed a wisdom beyond her years, and was prudent in governance. The kitsune reminded her of her niece, as well as herself. It was why she had approached the vixen and asked her to train Stella in archery.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith turned, watching as both Stella and Kari now approached. &quot;What is it?&quot; she asked. &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No mom,&quot; Stella replied. &quot;I was just looking for you. Is everything okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith turned once more, a scowl forming on her face as she glared at a pair of laughing kitsune diplomats. Only a few short months ago, these kitsune pledged their loyalties to the royal families enemies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything is fine,&quot; Abolith said, her voice a low and menacing. &quot;I find myself....deep in thought. Is there anything I can get you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly Stella now approached, Abolith noticing the young elf clutching a piece of paper in her hand. Curiously the elf watched as her daughter handed her the paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to give this to you,&quot; Stella said.<br />
<br />
Abolith&#39;s eyes went wide, noting the exquisite drawing her daughter made. Sketched in charcoal, the elf girl created a picture of mother and daughter, Abolith and Stella, the pair sporting a soft smile as they gazed out from the paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;I..I hope you like it,&quot; Stella stated.<br />
<br />
Abolith was speechless, her face unmoved yet her heart skipping a beat. The picture was beautiful, capturing a moment in time between mother and daughter. For Abolith, it was perhaps the most beautiful thing she had ever seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s...it&#39;s very lovely,&quot; Abolith stammered and for a moment the stoic expression of the fearsome elf cracked, revealing a warm smile. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella nodded, quickly approaching her mother before before giving her a tight hug. Abolith, at first, stood still before slowly raising her arms, reciprocating the hug. Slowly she now smoothed her daughter&#39;s hair as she ran a hand along her cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Stella,&quot; she smiled. &quot;However the time grows late. Please wash up and prepare yourself for bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella nodded, leaving with Kari who found the moment very touching as she gave her cousin a smile. Once more, Abolith was alone, her eyes trained on the picture her daughter gave her as a single tear fell from her eyes. Wiping her eyes, storing the drawing in her pocket. The elf now took a breath as she once more focused on the setting sun. This time though, instead of fear, she felt hope. After all, if she could produce a child as warm and caring as Stella, then perhaps there was hope in this world.</p>
