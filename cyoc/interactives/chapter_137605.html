<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even with the lights on, the flash of lightning was easily seen through the windows in the hotel room that Sophie and Roland were in. It wasn&#39;t a bad hotel, and in fact for the two Pterodactylus Dinotopians, it was very comfortable, but that didn&#39;t change that it was a massive change in the plans that they&#39;d had. The plan was that they, along with Jen and Andrew were to go to participate in the official establishment of the Dinotopia Aquatica Colony on Skull Island and then return in time for the first day of school. But nature had seemed to have other plans. At most it was supposed to be a two day trip, but on the day that they were supposed to fly back to Lyre and Countess Irena was scheduled to return to Spain, a massive thunderstorm seemed to come out of nowhere. <br />
<br />
With it came a massive downpour that sent just about everyone looking for shelter. The aircraft couldn&#39;t take off safely in those conditions and the flights were essentially put on hold until the weather cleared. And as such, Sophie, Roland, Andrew, Jen, and Countess Irena were essentially stuck there until it passed, and that seemed to go rather slowly. It was like the system just seemed to hover over that part of Florida and Skull Island. It was something that rapidly grew tiresome in some ways as they listened to the patter of drops against the windows and saw the occasional flash of lightning.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure this can&#39;t go for much longer,&quot; Roland said to Sophie as he sat beside her on the bed in the hotel room that they had.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s gone on for a few days!&quot; Sophie said in a frustrated voice, &quot;and I&#39;m pretty sure the hotel&#39;s restaurant is frustrated with our dietary requirements.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roland slowly nodded at that as he looked to her. The hotel did have an attached restaurant and the payment system that had been arranged for Animalia Ambassadoria had proved capable to cover their expenses for the room and food, though it did also mean diverting funds from the savings accounts that their parents had set up when Animalia Ambassadoria was first founded and later when Roland joined the team, and allowed for them to be able to eat and stay dry. However, the fact that they were strictly carnivorous was something that the restaurant hadn&#39;t planned for, at least in this area, since so many of America&#39;s Animalians tended to live in Lyre or Animalia. There were some that lived outside of the two towns in Nevada, but there weren&#39;t many, and as such many places didn&#39;t feel the need to update things across the board. That part was frustrating.<br />
<br />
Roland recognized this and scooted back to get behind Sophie. It lead to a little bit of wrestling with their wings as they moved to position themselves, which was something that they&#39;d both grown more accustomed to over the course of the summer. While sitting on a bed or a couch, they often had to have their wings raised and outstretched behind them simply for the fact that their wing bones wouldn&#39;t allow them to sit on their wings without doing real harm. Once in position, Roland reached forward and began to softly massage Sophie&#39;s shoulders, and even through the shirt she was wearing, he could feel that her muscles there seemed rather tense.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, my beautiful mate,&quot; Roland said softly to her, trying to assure her that everything would turn out okay in the long run, &quot;this is just a minor interruption. Soon the storm will pass and we&#39;ll be back home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm,&quot; Sophie responded, as she could feel her muscles relax a bit as Roland rubbed his hands carefully at her shoulders and neck, making sure that his claws didn&#39;t make contact with her or her shirt. While she didn&#39;t like being stuck away from home, having Roland there made it bearable. As he&#39;d already done so much for her. She remembered their first formal meeting during the Valentines Dance in their Freshman year and how surprised she&#39;d been at him finding her cute/attractive. So many human students that had responded positively toward Animalians had often done so because the double dosed Animalians all seemed to be built to satisfy someone&#39;s sexual fantasy, and compared to that, many girls like Sophie seemed to fall between the cracks as it were, particularly when three of her friends were all double dosed Animalians and the third was only single dosed, but still more developed than Sophie was.<br />
<br />
But Roland had found her attractive and asked her out. He became a regular feature on Animalia Ambassadoria with her, and she felt happy. He then came to her rescue when Heather attacked her at the start of her Sophomore year and actually took the worst of Heather&#39;s rage at the time, and he didn&#39;t have to... or at least if he&#39;d run in fear, it would have been understandable. Yet, he fought to try and save her and volunteered to become a male Pterodactylus with her, which in a sense fit with Animalia&#39;s edicts, but wasn&#39;t something that was demanded given that they wouldn&#39;t the chance to convert until the end of their Sophomore year. In that, if Roland wanted to become an Animalian, his choices were wide open. And yet, he chose to be with her and become the same species that Sophie had ultimately decided on. It was at that point that Sophie realized that she truly loved him and felt that he loved her back. It might come off as rather sappy... but a part of her really didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
&quot;That feels good,&quot; Sophie breathed as she glanced over her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure... given how tense you feel,&quot; Roland commented as he looked up to her, seeing her head turned so that she could look to him.<br />
<br />
Her beak was pointed down for the moment, as they weren&#39;t flying and it gave him a good view of the crest on her head. It was smaller than his, and her colors were duller than his, but on the whole, Sophie remained beautiful to him. In fact after their conversion, a real part of him found her even more desirable. Her muscles were larger than before, her hips were wider than before, and her breasts were larger than before. Even if she wasn&#39;t fully mature or double dosed, Roland found her to be highly desirable, and he had found himself at times having various fantasies about her, which he tried to keep hidden, at least for decency&#39;s sake. <br />
<br />
Of course, the colony tour had been a bit of a test of that, as two of them and Roger and Jessica had all had to share a room while they&#39;d been there at Vilcabamba.  Of course, Jessica and Roger&#39;s presence had helped as the nights soon turned into watching television, talking on what was going on in baseball or how Roger&#39;s martial arts classes were going, but Roland did get to cuddle with Sophie during the nights that they were there. A part of him recognized that Sophie was the girl he wanted to spend his life with and his bond-mate, and that being with her was a good thing. Though that part of him also reinforced the part of him that was growing up and running high on hormones and fantasying about his girlfriend and bond-mate. He figured Sophie felt the same, but he didn&#39;t want to force anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose it&#39;s just the frustration at being caught her and not being able to get back for the first day of school,&quot; Sophie sighed, marveling at how broad and muscular Roland&#39;s shoulders had become after their conversion. And a real part of her mind was also heavily drawn to the blue on his beak and upper neck, which made him look especially attractive to her. Some of this she expected, as Jessica had told her off and on that she&#39;d been feeling ever growing desires around Roger. So, it would stand to reason that she&#39;d feel some of the same desires with Roland, particularly as she loved him and had the feeling that he loved her, though, neither of them had had any opportunity to really discuss that directly. <br />
<br />
However, the part of her that felt her desires rising was strong, particularly as they&#39;d gone about through their past couple of days at the hotel while waiting out the storm. They&#39;d had the same room and had slept in the same bed, they ate together, and at times tried to socialize together. It had actually given the parts of their minds that were desiring each other ample chances to push things further, though they had also tried to respect the other&#39;s privacy and decency. But the desires were still there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Roland commented as he continued to rub at Sophie&#39;s shoulders, and even moving them to her upper arms. She give a few small chirps of contentment at that as he continued to massage at her shoulders.<br />
<br />
Eventually though, one of Roland&#39;s hands slid down the center of Sophie&#39;s back and rubbed over a cluster of nerves just above her wings which produced a very different response. Sophie gave a surprised gasp and flared her wings outward, letting Roland&#39;s hand slide further down between her wings. It gave Roland a good view of her wings, which ended in good elliptical points, which both had found had helped them in the air while flying. They weren&#39;t quite as fast as the Falcon Animalians, but they&#39;d also found that they were more maneuverable and easily responsive changes in the wind and the movement of updrafts and downdrafts as well. However, Roland soon caught something different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sophie?&quot; Roland asked, fearing he&#39;d hurt her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That... that actually felt really good,&quot; Sophie said weakly, &quot;You were soft and gentle... and it... it felt REALLY good.&quot;<br />
<br />
The touch had actually sent sensations that went to the juncture between her legs and had served to actually arouse her a little. It reinforced the parts of her that she had felt screaming at her to take her mate and be with the man that had loved her, had fought to defend her, and joined Animalia to be with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot; Roland stumbled, &quot;I didn&#39;t want to force myself on you...&quot;<br />
<br />
He stumbled back a little as Sophie turned to face him. Part of her earlier answer had confirmed the scent of arousal that he&#39;d picked up, which tricked a slight response from him as well. But he didn&#39;t want to come off as some perverted jerk that would force himself on Sophie. She&#39;d meant so much to him that despite his physical desires, he wasn&#39;t going to do anything she didn&#39;t want. He watched as Sophie noticed him blush, which actually made the blue on his beak and upper neck actually look more vibrant. She smiled in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Sophie answered and scooted toward him and soon nuzzling her beak to his, running up and down from the points of the beaks to the crest of soft tissue on the tops of their beaks. This nuzzling also felt good. In fact, she could start to catch some scent of arousal on Roland as well. &quot;And it reinforces my choice of mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mate,&quot; Roland said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Sophie nodded, &quot;as in the one I want to spend my life with... the one I want to marry... the one that I want to make love to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to make love to me?&quot; Roland asked, sounding half surprised and half overjoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially since we converted,&quot; Sophie said softly and scooted closer to him, and again nuzzling their crests together, &quot;You were fairly cute before... but now... you&#39;re bigger and stronger than you were. The blue on your beak looks so nice... and I... well... a real part of me REALLY likes that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve kinda felt the same way,&quot; Roland admitted, &quot;you&#39;ve grown a lot too... but you&#39;ve also been sweet and kind... thoughtful and intelligent. I didn&#39;t want to do anything that would seem unworthy of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Sophie answered as she pressed her hands against his chest feeling the broad muscle underneath his shirt. Roland wasn&#39;t as muscular as Samson, but then, to her, Roland didn&#39;t need to be. He was attractive to her all the same and had already shown himself willing to risk his life for her, &quot;I&#39;ve been feeling it ever since we converted... and just being with you has increased that desire... Because I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Roland hesitantly reached forward and felt his hands slide under the bottom of Sophie&#39;s untucked shirt. It easily raised and he could feel the definition of Sophie&#39;s own gazed muscle. Her arousal was growing stronger, even as they continued to nuzzle their crests against each other. He paused for a moment just as he was about to lift her shirt over her breasts and expose the bra she had on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sophie...&quot; Roland began a bit nervously, though he couldn&#39;t hid that he was starting to become more and more aroused now as well. The vent between his legs was now open and he could feel his penis growing erect and pushing against the material of his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Sophie spoke, &quot;We&#39;re both vaccinated, which means we can&#39;t double dose each other... I don&#39;t feel any instinctive NEED for this, so I&#39;m probably not in heat at the moment... but I love you... I WANT you. You&#39;ve been so kind to me, you&#39;ve fought for me... been there for me. You&#39;ve become a Pterodactylus to be with me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I love you,&quot; Roland commented, &quot;it was like my heart was in my throat when I saw Heather going after you last fall. I couldn&#39;t lose you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which shows that we&#39;ve loved each other and thought for each other,&quot; Sophie spoke, as she finished removing her shirt. Getting it off her wings took a little effort, but it was worth it in a way. &quot;And you&#39;ve been considerate of me. A sign of a true gentleman. And here we are... caught in a storm... with nothing to do... but love each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie glanced down and could now not only smell Roland&#39;s own growing arousal but see it as well as a noticeable tent was forming in the front of his pants, which was growing bigger. It helped drive all the instincts and urges that had been driving her forward, and had been growing within her. She loved him and for the moment there wasn&#39;t all much to do while waiting out the storm, especially when so close to the one she desired. She then lifted the bra she had on and tossed it onto the bed, letting C cup breasts bounce freely and with her scaled nipples poking out through the pycnofibers on her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; Roland said with a weak smile as he looked to her and saw her reaching down for the button on his pants.<br />
<br />
Sophie smiled in return and worked to undo the button and then undid the zipper, feeling her own arousal growing. A part of her knew the could stop and perhaps should stop, but she couldn&#39;t help it. She loved him, he loved her, and that had driven her own growing desire to the point where she couldn&#39;t resist, and Roland&#39;s own physical responses seemed to indicate that he was in the same boat as her. He thrust his hips up a bit as she began to pull down his pants and underwear, revealing a growing pink rod that served to further arouse Sophie.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re very handsome too,&quot; Sophie responded as she guided Roland&#39;s hands to the button on her pants.<br />
<br />
While Roland worked through undoing the button and zipper on Sophie&#39;s pants, she then turned to work on getting his shirt off. There was a little bit of wrestling with getting it past the tip of his beak and then wrestling off of his wings, but as she finished, she heard a zip of her own pant&#39;s zipper being pulled down.  They then slid sideways on the bed until they were standing in the aisle between the room&#39;s two beds, Sophie letting her pants and panties fall to the floor at their feet. It left both of them naked before each other with Sophie&#39;s nipples firmly erect on her chest while Roland&#39;s penis was at full attention, and with their mutual desire very obvious to both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you,&quot; Roland said softly and approached, nuzzling his beak to Sophie&#39;s before reaching forward to softly caress her breasts. He found them soft and firm with the white pycnofibers having a very soft and almost smooth texture, but Roland could feel the obvious texture as his hands moved over them. There were times when he&#39;d straightened his own pycnofibers in the past to keep the shirt he was wearing comfortable at the time, but this was different and for a very different purpose.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you tooooooooo,&quot; Sophie gave a moan back, as his touch to her chest felt even better than the accidental finding of an erogenous zone on her back just a few moments before.<br />
<br />
They ended up backing away until Sophie hit the side of the other bed and fell backwards. Her wings flared out to a side and she landed softly on the other bed. Its mattress springs provided enough bounce that there was no problem and Roland was left watching his bond-mate&#39;s bosom bounce with the movement. He then carefully climbed up onto the bed, and making sure that he didn&#39;t do anything that might damage her beautiful wings. He smiled to her and she to him and came closer. Again he gently caressed her breasts with his hands. A part of him was curious about some other things... but since it was expected that Sophie wouldn&#39;t reach the point of continual lactation the way other female Animalians did until somewhere between her seventeenth and eighteenth birthdays, and the fact that Pterodactylus not only had a hard beak with no lips, it also had small conical teeth in that beak, he felt no need to risk putting a hole through Sophie&#39;s nipples.<br />
<br />
He simply edged himself forward until he felt his member reach and begin to slide into her. It seemed easy, at first, and felt rather good, but then it felt like he hit something and his progress slowed. Some of the others had given some commentary on certain things that were involved in WSA&#39;s sex education courses, and while they weren&#39;t &quot;how to&quot; courses, it did appear that certain anatomical aspects WERE part of the lessons, though, likely as a health measure. In this, while the hymen could be torn during sex, it was NOT the supposed barrier that had to be broken when a couple first had sex. That was made up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... keep going!&quot; Sophie demanded as Roland seemed to stop and then reposition, and thrust her his forward with force. The thrust caught Roland by surprise and lead to a counter thrust of his own. The result was that his penis fully penetrated Sophie&#39;s wet vagina and she swung her legs out to almost hold him in. She gave a bit a squawk her hymen was torn as a result, but from there... things soon began to feel MUCH better. &quot;Better...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t want to hurt you,&quot; Roland spoke as the two of them began to work in a slow and semi-awkward pace of thrust and counter thrust, but the feeling of her vaginal walls around his penis felt very good and a part of him really wanted to pick up the pace.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;For... so long as my bond-mate is with me... it doesn&#39;t matter how long the storm goes on.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so they kept at it. It may not have been planned, they had no intention of telling their parents, and Sophie didn&#39;t quite think she was quite as good at it as some of the others had commented on, but in its own way... her first time did feel like something of a &quot;magic moment.&quot;</p>
