<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt stood in the case for days, forced to stand exposed in his lustful pose for all the world to see. He was pretty mortified, both from the fact that anyone who wanted to could see him naked with his dick in his hand, but on a deeper level from the fact that he was on display as an object to be sold. Though part of him did enjoy the attention, actually liked the fact that he was being exhibitioned like this. He&#39;d always been too shy to really show himself off in public, now that that obstacle had been forcibly removed he had to admit that it was almost like a fantasy being fulfilled, in a deeply weird way. Though he could question how much this was &#39;him&#39; on display here, his robot body still looked like an idealised version of himself but it was still kinda weird actually thinking of himself as being this android.<br />
<br />
He had a lot of time to argue with himself over this, all he could do was stand, think, enjoy his assfucking and observe the limited sight available through his unmoving eyes. Matt&#39;s world was his glass cage and the aisle directly opposite him, which as far as Matt could tell was full entirely of jockstraps, speedos and fleshlights. He was a little creeped out by the implication that there was a whole store full of people who had changed themselves, willingly or unwillingly, into... things. Though he was also reassured that he was far from the only person to do something stupid with the Chronivac and end up in this situation. And he, at least he was still humanoid, unlike those poor fuckers over there.<br />
<br />
Matt was still determined that this situation was a temporary one, just because being an object like this had some upsides didn&#39;t mean that he wanted to remain like this forever. For one thing it could get pretty dull, for days the closest thing to human contact he&#39;d had was the shop assistant who came to polish him periodically. The guy took a lot of care with him, letting Matt feel like he was receiving a full body massage, but beyond buffing him up he didn&#39;t talk to Matt or otherwise interact with him. Matt figured this was part of the whole &#39;treating him like an object&#39; thing, but the main effect it had was adding to Matt&#39;s boredom.<br />
<br />
Beyond that the only real &#39;interaction&#39; Matt had was the looks of people who passed through the shop. Some seemed indifferent while some were openly amused by his situation. He observed some sneaking glances at him while others  looked him up and down with naked lust. It was those looks which excited and worried Matt the most, made him feel like meat -plastic- in a market. He wasn&#39;t prudish, he&#39;d designed himself for sex after all, but who knew what kind of fantasies the sick fucks who bought people like him were into. He was concerned about that, and equally concerned about how much part of him liked the idea of being used for those depraved fantasies.<br />
<br />
However Matt went unsold for whatever reason- no one bothered to tell the merchandise these things- so he was left alone with his thoughts for who knew how long. The repetitive nature of his days and the circular argument he was having with himself (escape vs enjoying life as an owned android) was beginning to weigh on him. In fact his thoughts felt like they were becoming so repetitive that a paranoid corner of his mind wondered if his programming had been damaged somehow, or even if his mind had been altered by his new owners.<br />
<br />
This all came to an end, finally, when something that Matt had been dreaming about and dreading actually happened. He was recognised by someone that he knew. It had been a particularly dull day so far, most of the people passing by had barely spared him a glance which surprisingly wounded him. He might be inanimate but he wasn&#39;t just part of the furniture.  He spent some time mentally drifting off, absorbed with his own thoughts and worries, when he was suddenly jolted back to reality by a familiar sight.<br />
<br />
Out of the corner of his eyes he saw a face he doubted he&#39;d ever forget- the face of Matt&#39;s first boyfriend, Ryan. Well, boyfriend was probably overstating it as Ryan had dumped him within a week, but he was still the first guy Matt and been with and it&#39;d taken Matt forever to get over him. So Matt felt a flurry of emotions rushing through him as he saw Ryan- hope that he might be able to get out of here, panic at being seen by Ryan in his robotized, helpless state, then those thoughts shifting to lust at the idea of Ryan seeing him like this.<br />
<br />
Matt felt tense as Ryan edged closer to him, he hoped he would be spotted just so that he could be saved from the endless tedium of life on display. Ryan walked right past him without any apparent sign of recognition and Matt went wild, desperately ordering his body to move, do something damnit. Matt felt so trapped in his android body, but then Ryan did a double take and stopped in his tracks, obviously shocked at the sight of Matt. <br />
<br />
Matt hadn&#39;t seen Ryan for a couple of years but he still looked pretty much the same as he remembered. He was a young Asian guy around Matt&#39;s age, pretty attractive and, assuming it was the same as the one Matt knew a damn hot body. Ryan was obnoxiously proud of his body and the work that went into maintaining it and his appearance more generally, when he&#39;d knowm Matt he&#39;d always nagged him for not particularly caring about his own appearance. Well, look where trying to improve his body had gotten him, Matt thought.<br />
<br />
Ryan placed his face right up against the glass, gawking at Matt. Matt wanted to scream at him but was voiceless, his face frozen with a moan permanently on his lips. He stared for a minute or two, particularly at Matt&#39;s dildo-cock, then turned and practically ran off. But before Matt could get too upset at how he was doomed to life as a display piece Ryan actually returned, with the blond store assistant following close behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, this robot here, he used to be a guy too right?&quot; Ryan said, his incredulity obvious in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir, all of our products used to be people. That&#39;s the whole purpose of our store.&quot; The assistant replied.<br />
<br />
Ryan nodded and continued. &quot;Right, I get it. So you know who they used to be then? This thing here reminds me of someone I used to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh god, Ryan did recognise him! Matt hoped that this would be his ticket out of here, there was no way Ryan could just leave him here, right?<br />
<br />
The assistant smirked. &quot;Yeah, we got this one a few days ago. It was a guy called Matt, we picked him up a few miles away and brought him here. Oh, and he chose to turn himself into this thing, if you were curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s eyes lit up &quot;Hah, knew I recognised him!&quot; He walked up to Matt&#39;s case, pressing his face against it again. He gazed into Matt&#39;s eyes for a while before abruptly turning and walking over to the assistant.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take it! Yeah, I knew it when it was a person, so I&#39;m definitely gonna have some fun with this one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt did not like the sound of that, the repeated use of &#39;it&#39; was... not encouraging. He hoped that Ryan was just tauning him while he was helpless, or at least that he&#39;d be able to talk some sense into the guy. Because if not... well, Ryan hadn&#39;t exactly been considerate towards his thoughts and feelings even when he was a man, Matt did not want to know how he&#39;d be treated as a robot.<br />
<br />
The assistant nodded and chuckled a little. “Excellent choice, we actually offer special rates for friends and family. We like to see happy endings at Chronivac Inc. If you come with me we can discuss options for your new possession. Oh, and Unit #087” he said, glancing at Matt as if just noticing him, &quot;Head to engineering for reprogramming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt prepared to object, more for his own pride than out of any real hope of it changing anything. Sure enough, he remained silent despite his mental screaming and his body sprang into action without his input. His body wrenched itself from its plug, adding insult to injury as he now didn&#39;t even have the anal stimulation to make his captivity inside his own body bearable. His body climbed out of the glass case, Matt attempting to influence it but really far too disoriented by the bizarre sensation of his body moving without him to be able to try very hard.<br />
He tried to leak pleadingly at Ryan but even his eyes were out of control, he could only look forward with a fixed expression. Besides, Ryan didn&#39;t appear to be in a particularly sympathetic mood, smirking and even waving mockingly at Matt. Not that Matt could linger on the sight for long, as his body forced him to march past, into some sort of back office.<br />
<br />
His body stopped next to a workstation and he was forced to stand at attention for a few minutes, until he felt someone slide open his neck covering and plug something into his USB port. Matt was freaking out, were these fuckers about to mindwipe him or something, until he heard a voice behind him say<br />
<br />
&quot;Just relax, I&#39;ve got to make a few minor adjustments to prepare you for your new owner. And look, this is going to happen no matter what, so if possible I&#39;d prefer it if we could do it quickly. Without you screaming at me. And to answer your next question, I&#39;ve got your thoughts as a readout on my computer here. So I&#39;d really prefer it if you didn&#39;t bitch and moan at me, I&#39;d like to go home soon. Don&#39;t worry by the way, your new owner wants your mind as-is so I&#39;m not going to do too much poking around in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt wasn&#39;t particularly reassured by this guy&#39;s attitude but the lack of mental alterations was promising at least. This guy seemed like a jerk but he probably had the ability to make Matt&#39;s life hell so sure, he&#39;d stand here and take his reprogramming like a good robot if it&#39;d get him out of here.<br />
<br />
He felt a tingling sensation in his head as windows popped up in his line of sight, showing the programmer going through various files within his hard drive. The guy finally found the file he was looking for and set about editing it, though to what Matt wasn&#39;t sure as he was denied access to that privileged information. Once the guy was done Matt instantly felt what had changed. It was now written into his programming, as a matter of fact, that Ryan was his owner.<br />
<br />
Happily his mind did in fact remain otherwise unaltered, for now at least, as Matt felt incredibly pissed off at this. Ugh, Ryan was really going to have fun fucking with him, Matt could only hope that he&#39;d be satisfied sooner rather than later... Hoping was all Matt could do at this point, he might not be thrilled at the idea but it was simply a fact that Ryan owned him, and looking at what that meant it looked like Ryan could order him to do basically anything, and... alter his programming at will? Fuck.<br />
<br />
Matt was so wrapped up in his annoyance at Ryan for buying him like some thing that it took him a few moments to discover the other change that had been made to him. Apparently Ryan had decided that it would be hilarious to change Matt&#39;s official designation to Slave Matt. Ugh, Matt really hoped that Ryan was just fucking with him and wasn&#39;t serious about this whole slavebot thing. <br />
<br />
Matt was lost in thought until he felt the USB plug disconnect, he was now alone with his own mind again. Well, &#39;his&#39; mind- it had just been made perfectly clear to him how much ownership he had over himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right, you&#39;re all ready now. Yeah, it&#39;s stupid but hey, your new owner is just the sort of customer we tend to attract at this place. The whole &#39;owning a person&#39; thing isn&#39;t really my thing but hey, each to his own. Anyway, I&#39;ve gotta go so... have a nice life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt felt the man pat his shoulder. It was a cursory gesture, but Matt was so starved for human contact after who knew how long on display that it felt like an incredibly intimate gesture. Then after a moment, he was alone again. <br />
<br />
He was left to mope for a few minutes before he detected footsteps again, then Ryan was standing before him, looking incredibly pleased with himself.<br />
<br />
“Look at you! Aren&#39;t you beautiful?” He had a broad grin on his face, which Matt really didn&#39;t like given the circumstances. &#39;At least one of us is enjoying himself&#39;, he thought as he was forced to stand naked in front of his new owner<br />
<br />
“You really turned out well Matt, I think I&#39;m going to have a lot of fun with you. In fact I know just what to do with you first...”</p>
