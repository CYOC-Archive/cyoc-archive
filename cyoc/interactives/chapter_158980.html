<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Angela had made him sit in the pretend corner a couple times, mostly because he was supposedly being naughty in class by not learning his lessons, Erick was glad when the little girl apparently lost interest in him. Watching as she played with Lilac and Summer as best as he could from where she had left him, Erick wanted to scream, to rage, to cry, to get up and flee, to do anything, yet he found such a tasks impossible, as his cloth body simply would not respond to his commands. When Brutus turned up suddenly, he found himself still terrified of the gorilla-man and felt sure that the servant would comment something about Angela&#39;s new toy.<br />
<br />
But to Erick&#39;s disappointment, Brutus did not. Instead, he told the little girl it was time to get ready for bed, that she could play some more in the morning, and that someone named Angelique would meet her upstairs to help her get ready for bed. The little girl standing, proceeded to scoop up both of the dragons and then, much against Erick&#39;s hope that she would forget him, she collected him as well. Skipping out of the room, Angela clutched the three close and Erick found that he could not see much, except for, every so often, the floor when his plush head flopped so that he was looking downward. Hauling him and the other two plush somewhere upstairs in the manor, Erick found himself deposited on a large bed after she was greeted by a woman who he guessed was Angelique and must be some type of female servant.<br />
<br />
From where he lay, Erick found he had a view that he did not want. Watching as Angela changed into her pyjamas, Erick thought that he would finally be left alone. Instead, he listened as Angelique told the little girl to hop into bed, to which Angela insisted, &quot;No. Kit and Lilac also need to put on their pyjamas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking the serving woman would counter this, Erick watched as she briefly looked at him, and would swear that something in the look suggested she knew exactly that he was not really a stuffed animal. Hoping she would say something about, he found himself wanting to cry when the woman nodded and took a couple steps back as Angela scooped him and the white Dragon up, proceeded to strip them both of the doll clothes they had on, then dress Lilac in a pair of pink footed pyjamas with white sleeves and him in a pastel purple shirt and a pair of black leggings.<br />
<br />
When the little girl had finished this, she then climbed under the covers, dragging Erick with her. Hating that everything that had happened to him, that Angela was hugging him so tightly he did not believe he could move, &quot;Even if I could,&quot; he thought angrily, he watched as Angelique approached. Again, he thought he saw something in the way her eyes drifted toward him. But then the moment passed and the serving woman pulled the covers up, covering him up completely and Angela up to her chin. Listening to Angelique&#39;s muffled voice, Erick heard her tell the little girl, &quot;Sweet dreams, little one. You&#39;re daddy will be home either tomorrow or the day after,&quot; then, &quot;Would you like the light left on, turned down, or turned off?&quot; to which Angela yawned, &quot;Off, please. I have Kit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure if the light was turned off or not, but figuring it must have, Erick felt Angela shift about, then listened as the little girl&#39;s breathing slowed, deepened and became even as she drifted off to sleep. Alone with his thoughts, he wondered how it was that he had been transformed and if there was a way to undo it. Struggling to move, he became frustrated when he was not even able to lift his hand, turn his head, or move his legs. Asking himself, &quot;Is this to be my life from now on. Aware, stuck in my own head, but unable to do anything except be a girl plush toy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frightened by such a prospect, he thought, &quot;I do not want to be a toy, let alone a girl toy,&quot; and trying harder, he abruptly stopped when he became aware of two things happening.<br />
<br />
The first was that Angela had moved. Scared the little girl had not actually fallen asleep like he thought, Erick mentally tensed as he waited to see what the little girl would do. When she released her hold on him, he wondered why. And then, to his surprise, she grunted in her sleep and turned so that she was lying on her back.<br />
<br />
As this happened, Erick became aware that something above the covers had started to move. Curious to know what it was, hoping that it was not anything that could worsen the situation he found himself in, Erick was surprised when a soft feminine voice said, &quot;I know you are under there. I want to help you. But I cannot come under the covers. You have to come out. I know it is difficult and that you feel you cannot move, but try. Really force yourself. Believe that you can and you will be able to eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; Erick wanted to scream, but found he could not due to not having a mouth. Struggling to make himself move, wanting to believe that the mysterious voice was right, that it was all a matter of making his new plush body do what his mind commanded, he stopped after a moment, thinking.<br />
<br />
After a bit, he began to wonder who the feminine voice belonged to, whether he could actually trust them, and if they actually could help. His thoughts leaping to what had happened to him, he found himself doubting anyone, short of his friends, in this place could actually help.<br />
<br />
&quot;And even then, it is highly unlikely Ryan, Jonathan, Sei, and Mike would even recognise me. Let along believe this horrid plush form I&#39;m trapped in was actually, at one time, their friend,&quot; he thought despondently before trying again to force himself to move, to make himself talk, to do anything but lie under the covers next to the little girl who had somehow turned him into one of her toys.<br />
<br />
Still unable to do anything, he abruptly stopped when he heard the voice tell him, &quot;If you cannot learn to move tonight, it&#39;s understandable. I&#39;ll still be hear, willing to help. Keep at it. And maybe, it shan&#39;t be too late,&quot; then, to his dismay, he heard something moving away.<br />
<br />
Curious as to whom it had been, desperate to do anything but lay where he was, Erick felt certain that, if he could, he would be crying by know. Wanting to know who this mysterious ally was, Erick decided that, no matter what, he would not give up. Wondering what she meant by it might not be too late, he figured that, whatever was meant by it, he would find out eventually, he put the matter from his mind. Focusing instead on trying to make his body at least twitch a little, he thought to himself, &quot;The first thing I do that moment I can actually move will be to get as far away from Angela as I can. Then, I&#39;ll either find whoever had been speaking or a way to turn myself back,&quot; and feeling resolved, he set himself his to the task, trying to keep anything from distracting him.</p>
