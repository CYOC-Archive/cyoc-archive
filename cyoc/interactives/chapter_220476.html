<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After registration, Jared and Mrs. Hollingsworth took the girls on a walk around the grounds. Christina felt awkward trotting on all fours. Despite the fur, she still felt like she was walking around naked and couldn&#39;t help but droop her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chin up Christina.&quot; Mrs. Hollingsworth told her. &quot;During the examination, the judges will watch you walk out, and the expect to see confidence and pride.&quot; She continued watching Christina. &quot;Also, try to walk a bit lighter on your feet. Your trot should be more of a prance. You may be a dog right now, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t walk like a princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that grandpa&#39;s advice when you competed with him?&quot; Jared asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; She confirmed. &quot;In fact, Princess was my competition name until your father became my trainer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina didn&#39;t like it, but this was her job. Considering what Jenkins had said about her contract she figured she should at least try to be good at it. She looked at Lily, who was panting with her tongue out and wagging her tail. She was looking around the venue taking in the sights. Lily didn&#39;t seem self-confidence about being a dog. Perhaps she felt more comfortable because she knew the people she was with, even though she didn&#39;t expect to be turned into a dog for real.<br />
<br />
While Christina was sure she was much taller than the girl as a human, as a lab she was dwarfed by the large mastiff who resembled a bear as much as a dog. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, this is the first time I attended as human.&quot; Jared commented. His face suddenly lit up. &quot;I can go to the dance this year!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH right,&quot; Mrs. Hollingsworth exclaimed. &quot;Olivia has been wanting you to dance with her there for years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lily&#39;s head suddenly turned to look at Jared, her ears perking up. &quot;Oliver!&quot; Jared quickly clarified. &quot;There&#39;s a beauty pageant for boys who turn into girls. He&#39;s been competing since his parents entered him in the toddlers in tiaras division. Oliver spends Westmorpher as a Olivia. She&#39;s actually a great competitor, and even has a sponsor. Anatomical Renovations pays for her entry fee to the pro-division as well as handle her wardrobe for the various portions. They&#39;ve even asked her to consider being a girl full time and work as their spokeswoman, though Oliver prefers spend most of his time as a guy. Anyways, Olivia has asked me to escort her in the past, but I&#39;m usually too furry to join her. She probably already has an escort but I&#39;m sure we can still hang out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lily turned her head look forward and gave a short low growl as she suddenly marched forward and Jared stumbled as she tugged him forward. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t be like that.&quot; He told her. &quot;Oliver is just a friend. I would never cheat on you even if your a dog right now and Olivia is a model.&quot;<br />
<br />
That appeared to be the wrong to say as Lily began to walk faster. Mrs. Hollingsworth just smirked. &quot;Well, he&#39;s attending as a human for once but it looks like Jared still found his way into the dog house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina and Mrs. Hollingsworth went to a couple of the stands, promoting various competitions or handing out coupons to be used at their stores. The group had stopped at an elevated stage where a performance that was labeled, The Puppermaster. He had started by juggling wooden balls. He then announced that if anyone wanted to take part in the show, all they had to do was catch one. The man wanted to make sure there was no bias on his part, and started juggling blindfolded and tossed the balls into the crowd. Some people shirked away, while other lung for the balls. He gave a quick interview with each volunteer, asking them who they were with. Afterwards he escorted the volunteers a curtained area center stage, only to exit with a marionette that looked remarkably like the person he previously had with him.<br />
<br />
He had just turned a pretty blond bombshell into a wooden marionette and started the actual show, when Christina heard a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if it isn&#39;t Holly Hollingsworth. I see you aren&#39;t entering your son this year. Who&#39;s that with you.&quot; Christina turned to see her ex-boyfriend Sean who was walking a beagle. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is Christina. She&#39;s a new competitor I have decided to take under my wing and I rather like our chances.&quot; Mrs. Hollingsworth told him.<br />
<br />
Christina could only imagine how the horror she felt transferred to her face as the biggest mistake of her life sized her up while she was a dog. Christina had never felt more humiliated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a girlfriend named Christina once.&quot; He commented. &quot;Never competed with her though. You know what they say, best dogs are made from the prettiest girls, and she really didn&#39;t have what it took to compete here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina couldn&#39;t help but wonder if he knew it was her. How could he? Her eye color was the same but she couldn&#39;t be the only blue eyed dog here, and she doubted Sean cared about anyone else enough to remember their eye color.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Hollingsworth voiced dripped with disdain. &quot;Well, I personally think your overconfident in you ability to evaluate the material you work with. It&#39;s more than just looks. You need character and Christina has that in spades. What about you? Who are you competing with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean smiled. &quot;This is Margaret, and before I was her trainer she was my girlfriend. We are taking a bit of a break until she returns to humanity. As far as character and looks, I think you&#39;ll find she outclasses both you and your boy&#39;s dog. In fact, I&#39;m so confident in her that we signed a year long contract and are doing the full circuit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Hollingsworth voice betrayed her shock. &quot;You are going to have her changed for the entire year?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; Sean told her. &quot;Unlike hobbyist who only take weekend trips, Margaret is a real competitor and she&#39;s in constant training. See you in the winners circle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Hollingsworth shook her head. &quot;A full year, that poor girl.&quot; Chrinstina growled. &quot;I can&#39;t imagine him treating her with a lot of respect, hopefully she leaves him after her contracts over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jared just watched him go. &quot;You know, I really only wanted to compete as a fun way to prank Lily and show her this side of my life, but now I want to win. Let&#39;s kick his ass Bad Bitch.&quot; Lily gave a bark in agreement, which was meant with shushes from some of the crowd watching the performance. <br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate the enthusiasm but you two aren&#39;t in the same category. Remember, Jared is a junior trainer. It will be Christina and I who have to face off with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was that moment Christina remembers that they had given her employee photo to the registration committee and they had said they would put it on the jumbo tron before she exited onto the stage for the examination round. Christina thought of every humiliating thing he had said to her. How he commented on every slight change in her weight, how she did her hair, how she cooked. Nothing embarrassed her more then looking back and thinking about how long she had stayed with him and how hard she had worked to win his approval. He often told her she would make a better dog then girlfriend and in light of this recent discovery she shuddered at how real that thought was for him. <br />
<br />
The second he saw her picture and realized she was a dog now, she would be opened up to torment on how right he had been. If she won, he would point out how she performed better as a dog, if she lost he could say she&#39;s still pathetic as a dog. While she knew she shouldn&#39;t listened to him, the thought still got to her. Worse of all, she couldn&#39;t back out or even speak with Mrs. Hollingsworth on what was bothering her. Besides, the registration forms could have very well been as compelling as Jenkin&#39;s contract on making sure she filled her side of the bargin.<br />
<br />
Without realizing it, Christina had started to whine. Mrs. Hollingsworth started to pet her shoulder. &quot;Don&#39;t let him get to you. I&#39;ve got a few cards up my sleeve and I think you and eye can make him feel humiliated before this is finished. I feel we need to pay him one for what he is doing to Margaret. Let&#39;s go, its time we put in some practice.&quot;</p>
