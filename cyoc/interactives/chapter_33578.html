<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Justin was watching the fight between Katie and Tiff with a little interest.  Even as a dog he could appreciate two beautiful, big breasted, scantily clad women wrestling.  Both we're really to weak to put up much of a fight.  After Tiff's initial spray of demon's milk, she went pale and lost her grip on Katie and fell to the side.  Katie didn't even look conscious.  Justin didn't know what was going on, the last thing he could solidly remember was Tiff screwing him, but apparently Katie thought something bad had happened and was trying to stop it.  It was a real shame cause Justin had really liked getting screwed by Tiff.  Maybe Tiff would still want to do it after being changed back.  Justin watched as both girls lost their respective auras of light and darkness as their skin turned back to its natural color and their wings broke off and disintegrated.  Tiff's horns also broke off her head but these didn't disintegrate.  <br />
<br />
Justin thought it was a little odd that Katie's hair was now a rich, curly, and blond and Tiff's hair stayed long, straight, and black as sin.  Justin wondered why that hadn't changed back to it's original color.  Justin also noticed that the rags that had strained to cover Katie and Tiffany's chests now hung loosely.  Katie didn't return to her flat chest but looked like her bust was just a little bigger then Tiff's.  <br />
<br />
Justin got closer until he was standing next to them and realized that whatever Katie had tried to do, it hadn't been completely successful.  Standing near Tiff was still having an effect on him.  It was no longer a compulsion that drowned out all other thoughts but now it was something that whispered from his subconscious.  A whisper he could easily drown out if he wanted to but he was intrigued by things it was telling him.  Listening to the whisper closely, Justin's excitement was becoming palpable as his dick lowered from his sheath but he was unsure what he should do.  Before he could really come to a decision the choice was taken out of his hands when his Mom came up from behind him and slapped him on the rear.  Startled, he jumped forward and almost landed on top of Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad dog.&quot; Suzy said, &quot;They're taking a nap so leave them be.  It looks like they've had a hard day.  We should get out of here and let them rest.  I know, I'll take you for a walk.&quot;  The words had Justin up and barking and before he knew it, Suzy had created a green leash and collar made from light, that felt as solid as the real thing.  Justin was too excited to think of anything but on the way out the door, Suzy bent down and picked up the ray gun that Katie had been waving around.  Justin pawed at the door, wanting Suzy to open it but she was more concerned with the ray gun and started fiddling with the dials on it.  She then pointed the ray gun at Justin and before he could think to move she fired a blue blast that hit Justin squarely on the chest.  <br />
<br />
Justin sneezed and began to feel a strange tingling which began to course throughout his entire body.  He looked down at his paws and saw them shift as they turned into hands with white claws on the end.  His hips shifted and his legs and arms lengthened so that he could now walk on his hind legs or run on all fours.  He was unprepared for the sudden surge of growth that occurred next and would have fallen over if he hadn't been able to use his long bushy tail to balance him.  When he was finished, he had grown up to be six and a half feet tall.  Then his muscles grew until they were large and well defined.  For the first time in his life, Justin had six pack abs. <br />
<br />
Marveling in his change, feeling strong and powerful, Justin looked down at the little girl, that was less than half his height, who used to be his mom.  Not wanting to be considered weak he tried to pull free from the leash but despite his new found strength he was unable to budge her.  Annoyed by his behavior, Suzy slapped him in the side of the leg which made his leg shake and he almost fell.  When he didn't drop, Suzy screamed at him, &quot;Bad doggy!&quot; Justin's collar changed from a metal band into a choke chain with steel barbs pressed against his neck.  She gave a slight tug on the leash and the force caused Justin to drop to his knees, gasping for breath as blood trickled down his neck.  He tried to pull it off but it might as well have been made of steel, as it wouldn't budge an inch.  Realizing he was not the strongest Justin stopped fighting for control and rolled onto his back to show his belly to Suzy, as a sign of submission.  After getting a light pat on his belly, Justin got to his feet again, but this time he was careful not to project an aggressive attitude.  Suzy nodded, as if he had just learned his first lesson in obedience school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now let's go for a walk,&quot; Suzy said leading Justin out the door and leaving Katie and Tiff behind.  She began skipping down the street, &quot;Mommy wants to go see some old friends.  Maybe we'll get lucky though and run into a bitch for you to play with.  You'd like that wouldn't you, Justin?  You just behave and do everything I tell you to and I promise you'll get a nice bitch.&quot;</p>
