<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jasmine in her new female human form spoke calmly and evenly spaced to the then <br />
thousand djinn, &quot;The kitsune, has been dealt with. The threat to Allah's people is no <br />
more.&quot; This caused level of disappointment and vexing among the power beings, &quot;your <br />
invasion, is no longer required. Abu Haj?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... Princess, Jasim?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will address me as 'Jasmine' in this shell shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
The senior djinn bowed respectively, &quot;Yes Princess Jasmine.&quot;<br />
<br />
The islamic angel nodded in approval, &quot;Thank you for  keeping the army in check while we <br />
were disconnected. You have served Allah well in my opinion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you princess Jasmine.&quot; The djinn bowed again. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are welcome.&quot; Jasmine looked at the assembled massive army of genies, &quot;Thank you <br />
all for answering the call to arms, regardless of your reasons for doing so. Those who <br />
stand at attention at the ready also serve.&quot; <br />
<br />
The ten thousand djinn kept those mouths shut and their faces neutral. <br />
<br />
&quot;As it is, the city of Karthis has fallen under new management. And with the advent of <br />
Operation Return, you presence as a standing military force has become counter <br />
productive. Allah thanks you all for your time and service.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some of the djinn began to exclaim to one another. <br />
<br />
&quot;Operation Return-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Impossible!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's can't be!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How did -that- get through-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmine moaned, &quot;I am so happy to see you've all been so perceptive, that out of ten <br />
thousand of you, that not one of you managed to pick up on this fine detail.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abu Haj bowed, &quot;We were merely focusing on the kitsune's city princess Jasmine, nothing <br />
more.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Be that as it may or not, the need for this army has, for now, passed, so, as it <br />
stands, you are all, --DISMISSED!&quot; <br />
<br />
Nine thousand, nine hundred, and ninety-nine djinn were in an instant teleported away. <br />
Some were returned to their native plane of reality, many were simply returned back to <br />
their prison cells of mundane objects, (lamps, gems, bottles and the like),  the rest <br />
resumed their task of creating one universe after another, to fully explore the absolute <br />
truth of all possibilities.<br />
<br />
This left a lot of foot prints in the desert with many bunks, tents and the like, something <br />
for archeologists to wonder over. Jasmine neither knew nor cared if this was to be <br />
considered littering or not. <br />
<br />
&quot;Abu Haj.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Princess Jasmine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is YOUR opinion of Operation Return? I am curious.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If Allah believes that the ants should know that elephants exists, then I shall give no <br />
contradiction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see Abu Haj... you are free to go as you will. Your power and that of your kind is still <br />
bound, but you may go where you wish, as Tabris would say, 'the age of illusions has <br />
ended.' &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Where is the Nazarene anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He no longer exists. He and the human spirit he was co-habitating with congealed at last <br />
into one entity. The cherub aided in the elimination of the threat of Karther's madness. She <br />
and the four other new angels will be properly introduced into the Host.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Till we meet again Princess Jasmine.&quot; Abu Haj bowed once more and teleported <br />
away in the space of an eye blink. <br />
<br />
'The new kitsune agreed to make the barrier only one way permeable. While I might be <br />
able to force my way through, the kitsune and their city are no longer my concern. My <br />
only true concern is the children of Allah's still within it's walls. As much as I should return <br />
to the Host: for the sake of Allah's children I shall wait outside the city walls, to insure <br />
those who stay or go do so of their own will. Kyriel is a new angel of free will after all. I <br />
shall also insure Iblis' rebels do not attempt to harm the newborn Messengers. ... Having <br />
been born from mortals of course, they'll need some prodding to realizing that they no <br />
longer belong to the material universe.' Jasmine teleported away from the camp, leaving it <br />
to the desert sands. <br />
<br />
And out of the desert sands, came a tiny handful of large eared foxes on four legs who <br />
had been in fearful hiding of their not-in-the-fun-way-mad prince.<br />
<br />
Jasmine also appeared before the family of transformed humans who were being kept in <br />
the safe arms of the Peri. Jasmine told the humanoid foxes they would have to find the <br />
courage to meet the NEW king of the fennec kitsune if they wished to return to the forms <br />
they had been born in, at which point the Peri returned them to the settlement the family <br />
had been stolen from, to make their own decisions as they would.  <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
In a tired weary voice Keiko managed, &quot;I want to go home.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; Akira raised a non-existent eyebrow, having turned male again for the moment. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think... I've had a little too much fun. I want to go home now.&quot;  'I can smell it in the air, <br />
the veil has been torn down... maybe I'll visit my parents as a vision.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha'? Keiko! We win! It's time for celebration!&quot; With a leaf on top of his head and a puff of <br />
smoke later the five tailed fox was dancing around, not humanoid in the least but dancing <br />
on his hind legs with noise makers in his paws and puzzle, a party hat topping it off. <br />
<br />
Keiko didn't react to Akira's shenanigans. &quot;Okay Keiko, that is decidedly non-kitsune.&quot; <br />
Julio spoke up. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're awake?&quot; Keiko asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks to that nasty power surge that went through the city yes. Oh, and you guys' <br />
bodies are hard to look after when you're not in them.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No harm no foul.&quot; Quoted Akira. <br />
<br />
&quot;At any rate, what you do with yourself is your own business Miss Kitsune, but if you do <br />
wish to depart, and seeing that Tamthis' influence in his city has utterly vanished.&quot; A <br />
kitsune ran by them backwards on his arms that had feet and waved with his legs that had <br />
hands. &quot;At least in terms of more damage, this means that our bargain has reached it's <br />
conclusion.&quot; <br />
<br />
Keiko asked, &quot;You aren't worried about Jasmine sensing you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw. I can't sense her now, which means even if my aura is exposed, she can't sense me, <br />
I felt her teleport out of here, and the barrier around this place is still intact mostly, <br />
which'll give me plenty of warning she choses to come back for a revisit. ... So kitsune, <br />
shall you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A deal's a deal.&quot; Keiko conceded, and in a puff of smoke, Julio, human and male appeared <br />
in place of a tick on her ear... only without his clothes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, very funny, and rather down to Earth for a kitsune prank.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is what it unpredictable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted. However.&quot; Julio hacked his form and he was now a male fennec humanoid. A few <br />
more hacks and he had on a white loincloth and white turban. &quot;There we go. With the way <br />
this city is screwed up in term of population, no one is going to notice one more extra <br />
fennec. And given how much time it's gonna take this place's new authority to get things <br />
organized and sane again around here, I've got enough time for a nice stroll through <br />
Karther's personal library, I'll likely get a much greater use out of it than he did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both former concubines of the fox prince nodded at this.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be stepping out of context now, as I always do in the end. This was a very interesting <br />
set of twists and turns. Decidedly the most trouble I've ever gone through for a piece of <br />
Knowledge, rather refreshing. May the day be kind to you.&quot; Julio bowed and walked <br />
towards where the map he had hacked out of the city's threads of magic told him the <br />
great library was located, tripping slightly as he got used to the body. <br />
<br />
&quot;So! Keiko! Come on!&quot; Akira said pushing Julio instantly out of his mind. Sounding as <br />
cheerful as he felt. &quot;We've got a victory celebration to have! Our angelic siblings are likely <br />
waiting for us!&quot; He took her paws in his.  &quot;Let's go sis!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you'd be halfway around the world the moment our family was out of danger to <br />
give our niece a magic charm or something to turn her into a Magical Girl, fox boy, or a <br />
European kitsune.... assuming you couldn't find a way to make it all three of course.&quot; <br />
<br />
The 'gaijin otaku' who had been used to create Anna, Karther's slave had always been <br />
alienated with his family, and had few if any real friends, this fresh blank slate of <br />
existence, and having become somethings whose only real purpose in existence was to act <br />
like a spiritual watch dog over a small population in exchange for being allowed to play <br />
his fun and games with the random person, was the most liberating thing he could have <br />
asked for...   <br />
<br />
&quot;There's plenty of time for that later! Our family just saved a bunch of people from <br />
remaining zombies, kept a bunch of genies from blowing up half the country, restored a <br />
very dear friend of Janice's to himself, AND we've obliterated the last traces of bastard <br />
Kather's existence! If that doesn't call for a celebration! I don't know what does!&quot;  Still, <br />
there was the tiniest bit of allure to a family that accepted him as he was. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
<br />
When the band of seven had burst into the throne room, they hadn't know what to expect, <br />
but finding Jasmine not present, Kyriel now a child, and Erica and Lisa cheerfully chatting <br />
with a fox king hadn't been one of them. Thankfully, the two angels of the entering group <br />
weren't limited to mundane senses and could see as plain as day that the person chatting <br />
with their three sisters was -not- the Kitesune King Tamthis they had heard about. They <br />
hadn't had spiritual senses to memorize Tommy's soul, but they did very much note the <br />
absence of the stink that had permeated this entire city up until a very short time ago, and <br />
the slightest hint of Kyriel's within the fox king before them. <br />
<br />
Kathy was in silent shock. The city had suddenly ceased twisting back upon itself, and at <br />
least the structures had repaired themselves as they had made their way through the <br />
twisting mass of living clay the palace had become. Kathy was still wired to the city, <br />
though she had been given much more flexibility than Tamthis' other 'creations' ironically <br />
enough sparing her from going mad as the city had gone mad. And now, Kathy sensed her <br />
king, all his traits were there, where they belonged, and maybe one or two she didn't <br />
recognize, but they all seemed to be in a different order. It was like reading the rough <br />
draft of a story, thinking it the final version, then reading the published work, and <br />
realizing the full scale of the differences between the versions. Kathy had never thought of <br />
her king as being incomplete or disarrayed, but the feeling radiating from him now, a <br />
small part of felt that indeed he felt -more- complete, -more- in order than he had been. <br />
<br />
Jennifer/Gene, Natalie and Lucy were no longer hard wired into the city, and thus had no <br />
way to know this. They also had no way to know that the Angel's minds couldn't be <br />
rewired into slaves like their mortal selves had been. <br />
<br />
Alexandra, was just confused by the scene. The city decidedly wasn't going mad anymore, <br />
which meant it had avoided the fate of the first castle when Tammia had assimilated it all, <br />
magic and madness and all. She remembered that Tamthis was supposed to cease to <br />
exist... so why wasn't Tamthis nice little Tammy again? The vixen she had helped out wit a <br />
couple too eager guards (Gean and Robert) on that fateful night? Was Karther's murderer <br />
gone? <br />
<br />
Lucy, Jennifer and Natalie charged at Tamthis, Jennifer and Lucy sure the three angels <br />
were now zombies and Natalie just smelling the fox king's scent knowing the fox king had <br />
been the enemy. Jennifer and Natalie fell foreword limp as Vicki had quickly applied some <br />
quick pressure point from behind. Of course Lucy fell too but quickly just dissolved her <br />
nerve clusters into sand and continued her charge. Before Luna could cleave Lucy in two <br />
('She'll get better,' Luna would have thought), Lucy was stopped dead in her tracks by the <br />
short distance teleport by the cherub she didn't recognize (though she did bare a passing <br />
resemblance to Janice) which distracted her for a second.<br />
<br />
Kyriel of -course- recognized Lucy from Janice's memories. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay, it's over, the person who turned you into a slave doesn't exist anymore, and the <br />
parts of him that found their way into Tommy have been put in their place as part of the <br />
whole rather than being the whole.&quot; <br />
<br />
If it was just the words Kyriel had spoken, Lucy would have knocked her aside. But an <br />
influx of the cherub's aura waved through the sand anthro vixen, and calmed her <br />
considerably and making her feel, yes, everything WAS all right, if just for this moment, <br />
just this moment.  Kyriel's kind words and loving feelings mollified Jennifer and Natalie as <br />
well. <br />
<br />
Lucy's summoned weapons dissolved back into sand and her stance went slack. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy?&quot; Alexandra repeated the name as if it was a foreign language. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy.&quot; Kryiel nodded, floating off the ground to be eye level with the adult women. <br />
&quot;The person who he was before Karther turned him into just another concubine. And <br />
before the additional modifications Karther did to her began to feed upon themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathy just heard of all this, and understood none of it. &quot;My King are you well?&quot; Kathy asked <br />
hoping for some kind of stability in this sea of complexity and confusion her simple <br />
existence had been thrown into. <br />
<br />
Tommy looked at Kathy, knowing precisely who she was, and who she wasn't. &quot;I'm fine <br />
Kathy, I am better than fine. The angels have -saved- me. Oh, and by royal command, you <br />
and all others shall address me as Tommy, the name Tamthis is nothing more than dust in <br />
the wind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathy was started by this, but was nothing if not obedient, &quot;As you command of me my <br />
king...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tommy?&quot;Luna blinked, &quot;I know you just got your identity back and everything but... isn't <br />
that kinda a under-whelming name for a king?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Insolent!&quot; Said Kathy right to the messengers face, &quot;If King Tommy decrees that his name <br />
is Tommy then his name shall be Tommy! If my Tommy should declare his name shall be <br />
'Susan' than I shall address him as such!&quot; <br />
<br />
Luna looked at the others and pointed at Kathy, &quot;Is she still zombified?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is nothing to de-zombifiy Luna,&quot; Erica said reminding everyone the other two <br />
angels were there, &quot;It's just the way Tamthis made her, utter devotion is just who she is...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The name Tamthis tiss no longer to be spoken!&quot; Kathy snapped at her defender.<br />
<br />
&quot;Works more than well enough for me.&quot; Jennifier said, using her collection of arms to prop <br />
herself up. Vicki having undone her disabling in under a minute. The shiva vixen also <br />
finally took a look around. &quot;Oh sheat.&quot;<br />
<br />
The war veteran in the body of a massive near super natural warrior woman rushed over to <br />
the decapitated corpse next to the room's long dinning table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sheat! Oh sheat! Rob!&quot; She saw Roberta's lifeless head several yard away, dead eyes <br />
looking at nothing. <br />
<br />
Kyriel decided not to mention who had killed her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yer angels! Do somethin'!&quot; Jennifer called out desperately glaring at the six winged <br />
figures present.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're angels of war,&quot; Lisa said apologetically, &quot;We can't call  back the dead. I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna felt vexed, 'Jasmine just -had- to have her army of ten thousand genies make us <br />
push our adjustment time foreword.' Still, she couldn't herself to curse the senior <br />
messenger of Jehovah. She was after all, Luna's elder and wiser. <br />
<br />
&quot;They're angels of war,  I am not.&quot; Kyriel said teleporting from her spot next to Lucy next to <br />
Roberta's head. The cherub floated down and touched her digigraded feet onto the sand <br />
stone floor. <br />
<br />
Kyriel didn't need to touch the corpse, after all, it was not Roberta, it was just the flesh <br />
and blood container Robert had lived his life in. Instead, she prayed. The angels of course <br />
could see the sliver of spiritual presence that connected to her like an umbilical cord, then <br />
after a few moments disconnected. Jennifer just saw a little fox girl holding her hand <br />
together like at Sunday school. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry. Robert is at peace. He has what he wants now. He's with those who have gone <br />
before him. But he did have a message he wanted you Gean to deliver to his grandson.&quot; <br />
<br />
Skeptical of the whole ordeal, the Shiva vixen crossed all of her arms, &quot;And that would be?<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'That girl Suzie is decidedly your type, but that job just isn't for you.' Oh! And Rob' said <br />
your mother said she's glade you finally broke that awful habit of biting your lip when <br />
agitated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer was stunned silent, as her brain twist around this little piece of information, &quot;How <br />
could did you... know that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erica laughed, &quot;We're Messengers, duh,&quot; She twirled a piece of her short hair, &quot;Delivering <br />
messages is what we -do-!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer shook her head, the weight of her friend's death still holding on her, but she <br />
could keep it in check for the moment. &quot;Can ya.. can ya at least make Rob' look like Rob' <br />
again? I know it's not like I can tell his family but--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What makes you say that?&quot; Kyriel asked out of the blue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no one is gonna believe me, assuming you can make ME normal so I can go back <br />
home to my poker buddies at the retirement home.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyriel laughed, she sounded like silver bells. before Jennifer could demand what so funny <br />
Kyriel said, &quot;Gean', as of today... the illusions and perception filters and techno black <br />
boxes that were keeping humans ignorant of the world around them shut down. There is <br />
nothing keeping anyone from finding out what's happened here today, or anyone not <br />
believing you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;?!... You're kiddin'!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in the least Gean!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kid, I'm happy ya keep callin' me by my real name, but how do ya know my name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My mother, Janice, told me everything about you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Jance-?! I was wondering what happened to her, when I was allowed to wonder... so <br />
where is anyway?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;.... She's dead.. she... died giving birth to me.&quot; Kyriel said honestly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Geeze-us! Kid I'm sorry... so how'd you get involved in all this? But.. no offense, but I saw <br />
Janice alive a while back and... you don't look THAT young.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm an angel, some rules just don't apply. And I felt it was my responsibility to save my <br />
aunts who were still under the control of-&quot; Kyriel remembered Kathy, &quot;-of this city's <br />
madness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Lucy said in a demure tone. Natalie struggled to say something, but all that  <br />
out were animal sounds. <br />
<br />
King Tommy spoke in a voice that gave him an impressive sense of presence, &quot;Natalie, <br />
Lucy... I'm going to need your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
The alpha-she-wolf and sand vixen looked at the new king of the fennec kitsune. <br />
<br />
&quot;If either of you would do so of your own choices... I would like Natalie to have her wolf <br />
pack begin to escort citizens to the palace, so I can begin to remove Tamthis and Karther's <br />
curses and restore their real selves, memories and forms... And Lucy, if you'd do so... I'd <br />
like you to help the angels release the souls that have been ingrained into the palace and <br />
city walls so they can find rest....&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathy herself found most of these commands confusing, contradicting, and odd. But it <br />
was improper for her to say so in front of her king. That was what time alone with other <br />
women was for. <br />
<br />
&quot;What about YOUR life?&quot; Erica asked in a clip. <br />
<br />
&quot;The fennec kitsune are a mess... and there is no one else around to help clean it up... it <br />
wouldn't feel right to just leave them just yet...I'll see my family when I can.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alexandra didn't know what to think... what happened when her turn was up? And of <br />
Kathy? Would the two of them simply serve this new king in an empty and depowered city? <br />
Or would they in the end be alone within this hollow city?<br />
<br />
King Tommy wasn't done however speaking to Natalie and Lucy. &quot;Or, I may restore both of <br />
you... male, human, and to the homes you came from... that is within my power and <br />
