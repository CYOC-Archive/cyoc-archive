<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Francisco rummaged through a drawer in the kitchen and came back with a pad of Post-It notes, some stubby pencils and a large salad bowl. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;OK. Everyone write down some transformations - one on each sheet - and your name, and we'll each pick one to start and try that,&quot; he suggested. &quot;Ric, since
<br>
 you've got the most experience with this book so far, you can go first.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Ric fished his hand deep into the bowl, now almost half full of colored slips of paper, and pulled one small sheet. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Uh, huh,&quot; he grunted, and moved next to Marco, to whisper in his ear. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;You sure this is what you want? I don't want to mess up the first time out,&quot; he asked. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Yeah, little dude. I've always been a beefy kind of guy, but into thin, lanky dudes. Might be a real turn-on to see what's that's like,&quot; Marco whispered back
<br>
 through a hand cupped to Ric's ear. 
<br>

<br>
 Ric leafed through the pages intently, until one came into sharp focus, and began to read. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Mmm ...oooh.&quot; This from Marco, as the change began. Hardly noticeable at first, until he stood up, then everyone saw he was getting taller - and thinner. 
<br>

<br>
 Marco raised his arms above his head in pleasure and wriggled around a bit. As all kept their eyes on him, the arms became less muscular, then approcahed
<br>
 average, then smaller and smaller in circumference until they were pipe-stem thin. Marco seemed to collapse in on himself, the extra mass and bulk being propelled
<br>
 upward until his fingers easily touched the ceiling. His stomach and chest continued to narrow, the protuberance of his ribs growing more and more. 
<br>

<br>
 Ric read the last two lines from the book, and Marco's hair began to lengthen and lighten, growing longer, softer, lighter, until straight golden hair ran from his scalp
<br>
 down to his ass. The goatee of just a short time ago was gone. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Yeah, baby,&quot; he said, glancing down at himself and craning around to check out as much of his rear view as he could see. He was now about 6 foot-11, his jeans
<br>
 crumpled in folds from the waist down to the crotch, the bottom of them a good 4 inches above his feet. Then they gave way to the tug of gravity and fell. A golden
<br>
 bush of crotch hair now faitrly glowed from Marco's pelvis. Francisco shook his head in near-disbelief. Marco's waist was now probably about 26 inches! 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;So this is what it feels like,&quot; Marco said, running his long, thin fingers all over himself. &quot;I kinda like it. Geez, look at my legs - what a hoot - all those days at the
<br>
 gym, too! &quot;This is SO-O-O hot!&quot; Marco panted, cupping his narrow, flat butt cheeks in one long palm. Recovering composure, he continued, &quot;My turn now, I
<br>
 guess.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 He pulled out a strip of paper and glanced at Josh, then at the book. &quot;Older, tough guy, huh, Josh? Let's see what the new Marco can do about that!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Josh blushed and shyly smiled. 
<br>

<br>
 Marco, his now long slender fingers overlapping at the book's spine, began reading. Suddenly Josh began to fidget in his chair. No matter how he positioned
<br>
 himself, he couldn't get comfortable, and wasn't quite sure why. 
<br>

<br>
 He stood up to adjust his shirt and trousers, discovering that the shirt tail was now above his belly button and he couldn't fit even two fingers under his waistband.
<br>
 Tiny 'pops' only Josh could hear came from the threads at his shoulder seams straining and then bursting. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;You'd better strip down and grab a robe, MISTER Josh,&quot; Ric said, admiringly. 
<br>

<br>
 Josh quickly did so, taking furtive notice of the newly-sprouted hairs surrounding his nipples, totally hiding his crotch and running the full length of his legs. &quot;Cool. I
<br>
 --&quot; he cut himself off, not recognizing the deeper voice. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Hey, you won't need fake ID now,&quot; Ric teased, figuring Josh had passed 21 and was continuing to mature and age. 
<br>

<br>
 A moustache sprouted under the 'little' brother's nose, and dark stubble appeared on his cheeks and chin. 
<br>

<br>
 Marco looked up from the book. Josh must be nearly 30 now. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Who's next?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;I guess that would be me,&quot; the now-adult Josh gruffly answered, fishing in the bowl for a paper with one hand while taking the profferred book from Marco with
<br>
 the other. 
<br>

<br>
 Josh was deeply excited by the change, but figured there would be time to 'explore' his new self after everyone had had a chance. However, he failed to notice that
<br>
 what he picked from the bowl, the one with Ric's name on it, was two slips of Post-Its that had clung together. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Hey, mi hermano,&quot; he said, patting Ric's head, &quot;if that's what you want, that's what your best bro is gonna give you.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 He turned confidently through the book and read quickly, in an almost inaudible voice. &quot;Now you do Mr. Mendes. Quick, so we can check each other out!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Ric could feel his limbs lengthening and thickening. He must also be turning into and adult, too. After all, he'd written that on one of the slips of paper. &quot;C'mon, can't
<br>
 it wait a minute until I change?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;No!&quot; Josh answered, excitedly, and pinched Ric's arms sharply.&quot; Ric wasn't sure if it was the emotion in Josh's face or not, but his little brother looked more
<br>
 defined - and weren't those tiny wrinkles appearing at the corners of his eyes?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;OK, OK,&quot; Ric yelped. &quot;At least let me get out of these clothes! They're really starting to hurt!&quot; The urgency of his pain stopped him from noticing his voice hadn't
<br>
 gotten deeper yet. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Ah, the hell with it,&quot; Josh growled, running a finger across his moustache. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Josh, we agreed,&quot; Mr. Mendes began, &quot;It's Ric's turn now. How about, it, guys?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Ric was busy peeling off his teen's clothes, while still getting taller. Marco was still entranced by his new shape, running one soft palm across the top of his thigh,
<br>
 stroking the length of his hair with the other. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well, I guess they're, um, a little involved at the moment, so - go ahead, my man.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Josh snorted and pulled a fistful of slips from the bowl, dropping them singly until he found one for Mr. Mendes, then opened the book and began reading. 
<br>

<br>
 Mr. Mendes leaned forward in his chair, eyes darting from person to person, licking his lips in anticipation. he could swearthat Marco was a little taller now, his hair
<br>
 a little longer, too. Then, as Josh began to read, Mr. Mendes noticed a few strands of grey appear at his temples. 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco turned his head to look at Ric, who was staring in disbelief at himself - he'd grown up, all right - at least in height. As he watched, the last of his pubic
<br>
 hair shrank away, and his genitals inched inexorably towards the smooth skin of his groin. He was also getting younger! Ric tried to cover himself, and saw a pudgy
<br>
 hand reach for his privates, which fast became almost hiden as his stomach distended outward. &quot;This isn't what I wanted,&quot; he began, surprised by the high pitch of
<br>
 his voice. And he was still growing, approaching six feet. &quot;I don't want to be a 6-foot tall 4-year-old!&quot; he screamed. &quot;What did you screw up, babozo?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 He managed to retrieve the slip Josh had read from, and found the two slips paste together: &quot;Adult Size&quot; and &quot;Little Kid Again.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Que pasa? Hey, I just did what you asked, right,&quot; Josh snapped. &quot;Don't worry - you won't become a kid in mind -- I think.&quot; He grinned as he saw mounds of
<br>
 pudgy baby fat grow around Ric's legs. 
<br>

<br>
 No sloucher he, Francisco now realized something was wrong, and that, apparently, the changes weren't stopping! Marco's shins, probably all of 5 inches around,
<br>
 now nudged the coffee table, and his hair puddled across the couch cusion on each side of his bony hips. Josh was fast losing his hair on top, love handles and
<br>
 small folds developing around his middle. Was that a white hair sticking up above the knotted belt of the robe? 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Josh,&quot; Francisco thought. &quot;He was reading MY slip.&quot; No sooner did the thought erupt than the ceiling, indeed the room, seemed to slip away. The 'reverse-vertigo'
<br>
 nearly made him black out. 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco Mendes couldn't quite get his bearings. he shook his head vigorously to clear his thoughts. Where was he? It was nearly impossible to judge any
<br>
 distances or figure out perspective - just a soft light, diffused surrounded him, almost like being underwater. 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco took stock of the situation. First, he was naked again. next, he could make out lighter and dimmer shapes to the sides and above him, but couldn't yet
<br>
 figure out what they were. Looking down, he discovered he was standing on a shallow, narrow ridge. The surface gave a little when he pressed his weight down,
<br>
 and the toes on one foot curled down enough to feel what must be the bottom. The air was a bit close, and he heard no specific sounds, just a kind of background
<br>
 rustling. 
<br>

<br>
 Taking stock, he could tell by the soft light that he was his normal age, or at least close to it. Then where the heck was he? 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco Mendes managed to reach far enough to touch the walls around him. On one side he felt a rough, metallic surface, one the other they were soft and
<br>
 malleable. 
<br>

<br>
 He got a firm grip on a protrusion on the easier side and gave as hard a tug as he could. A shaft of bright light beamed in from above. Something that felt stronger
<br>
 and stiffer than the walls brushed his fingertips. Francisco mendes grabbed the edge and tugged. Now he realized just where he had ended up. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;-L - Machine Wash -- Tumble Dry&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 It was impossible, but, after the past few hours, Francisco's mind was open to new possibilities. it was a clothing lable - his clothing label! The strange walls
<br>
 surrounding him were the light shirt he'd thrown on, bunched up and letting in the diffused light. 
<br>

<br>
 And the small ridge he was standing on was -- the butt seam of his pants! 
<br>

<br>
 He'd shrunk! And was now standing INSIDE his clothing! 
<br>

<br>
 Turning, he could make out angry, jagged ridges in the rough area he's touched earlier - &quot;Oh, damnation, that must be the zipper!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Just how small am I?&quot; he wondered. The secret excitement at wanting to shink and knowing he had evaporated on realizing his predicament. &quot;I DID want to get
<br>
 smaller, but not like this! And how will I get out of here and get to that book?&quot;</p>
