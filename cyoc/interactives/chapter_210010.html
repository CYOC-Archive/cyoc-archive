<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin’s new, 300 degree field of vision was a curse as she watched the bull outside grow into a slightly bigger breed.  She knew what was coming.  She knew what Troy was about to do her.  She knew what it meant to become a dairy cow.  What her body required to give milk.  <br />
<br />
She didn’t want it to happen.  She wanted to be a human again.  To be a man again.  To go back to her old boring life.  To go back to being Troy’s friend.  But she also knew that none of that mattered.  None of her wants, her hopes, her dreams, none of them mattered.  All that mattered was what Troy wanted.  And as her bovine cunt tightened back into fresh, unspoiled shape, she knew that she was powerless to stop him.<br />
<br />
Pressure began to build simultaneously between her legs and in the back of her stomach.  Teats stiffened out below her as soft, fresh hoofs beat against the muscular walls of her womb.  Mammary tissues began swelling up with milk as amniotic fluid filled her womb with a protective cushion for the calf that was growing inside of her.<br />
<br />
She could feel the calf moving around right above her udder.  She could feel the combined weight of the two pulling down on her hips as soft flesh began to sway between her legs.  She could feel that flesh begin to press up against the insides of her thighs.  As the pressure increased, she began shifting to a more bowlegged stance to help accommodate her sore udder.<br />
<br />
And in between the feeling of pressure in her stomach, the soreness in his udder and teats took center stage.  Between that and the feeling of milk sloshing to the beat of her heart, it was evident that she needed to be milked.  And with a sudden pop and the feeling of fluid racing down her canal, she knew it wouldn’t be long until she had someone… something… that would greedily milk her dry.<br />
<br />
Dustin winced as pain lanced through her womb.  Strong muscles pressed down on the calf inside of her, forcing it up against her undiluted cervix.  She could feel the calf mouthing at her insides as though to say “don’t push yet, you need to open up first!”<br />
<br />
She wanted to say she was sorry.  She didn’t want to push.  But as fresh muscles continued their contraction, she realized she didn’t have a choice.<br />
<br />
A hand ran down the side of her udder.  Small fingers gripped one of her teats.  She was so sore, so full, all it took was a slight tug for a stream of warm milk to splatter against the floor.  It felt so good, like going to the bathroom after holding it all day.  There was just so much pressure in her udder that even the slightest decrease was a palpable relief.<br />
<br />
Another contraction began to rock her body as she closed her eyes and began taking long, deep breaths.  Once again, she felt her calf painfully press up against her cervix.  Once again, her calf thrashed about in protest.  And once again, there was nothing she could do but ride out her own body’s futile attempt to push.<br />
<br />
Then it stopped.  Her calf relaxed.  Dustin began panting as she slowly opened her eyes to the sight of Troy standing in front of her.<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter Miss cow, you didn’t want to feel him inside of you.  Now you don’t have to!  Not for a bit anyways!” Troy chuckled as he stared into Dustin’s pleading eyes, “Oh don’t tell me this isn’t what you want Dustin?  You didn’t want to feel him inside of you, does that mean you didn’t want to feel his calf inside of you either.  Don’t tell me you eager to meet your new calf?”  <br />
<br />
Dustin felt her body visibly tense up as another contraction shot through it.  She heard Troy laugh as he said, “well, your body sure seems eager to meet the calf, even if you aren’t.”<br />
<br />
“Troy…” Dustin gasped, “Troy we’re supposed to be friends…”<br />
<br />
“Not anymore Miss cow,” Troy replied, before a snide look came over his face.  “I’m done with you cow, I’d ask you again how you’re enjoying your furry fantasy but I know you’d just lie. I already told you this, but I’m going to tell it to you again.  Make sure you burn it into your mind, because it’s the last thing I’m going to tell you.  You’re a dairy cow.  That’s all you’ve ever been.  Its all you’ll ever be.”<br />
<br />
Troy pointed to the bull outside, “That bull is going to fuck you raw, then you’re going to give birth to his calves, then I’m going to milk you.  That’s your life now.  And its going to be your life until the day you die.” Then Troy pointed to the open backyard door, “So go Miss cow.  Go out to your field.  Give birth to your calf.  Be a good cow.  And never bother me again.”<br />
<br />
Dustin wanted to protest.  She wanted to plead.  To beg.  To do anything to convince Troy to change his mind.  But her legs, which had previously been locked in place, began to move on their own.  She used every last once of willpower, every last shred of resolve, but her body just kept walking out the door, her overfilled udder swaying uncomfortably below her.  <br />
<br />
And as her hoof pressed into the soft grass outside, she felt another contraction ripple through her body.  It was uncomfortable, so unpleasant, and the pressure in her belly was only magnified by the pressure between her legs.  And unfortunately for Dustin, she realized that the solution to both of her problems was the same thing.  She closed her eyes, lifted her tail, and pushed.</p>
