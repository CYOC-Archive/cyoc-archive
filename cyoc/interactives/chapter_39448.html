<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Both girls giggled at what they had done and tried to think of what else they might want to do. Melissa wanted to experiment more right away, while Jessica was a little hesitant and wanted more time to think. They were both afraid of being caught, but knew that as long as they were careful and made sure that the subject was unaware and reality was adjusted everything would probably be fine.<br />
<br />
When Jessica excused herself to go to the bathroom it was too good an opportunity for Melissa to pass up. As soon as her friend was out the door she looked up Jessica's settings and adjusted them from Appaloosa centaur to 30% jaguar, figuring that she could always change her back to a centaur later if she wanted. The chance to see her friend change into something so exotic was too good to pass up. For additional fun she set reality to adjust and for Jessica to be completely oblivious to her changes to the point where she wouldn't even remember being a centaur,  she would think that she was, and had always been, an ordinary human girl despite her changes. On a whim she set her friend's gender to male and decided to look at what mental changes she could make.<br />
<br />
These were the ones that interested her the most and she decided to go a bit wild with them. She made it so that Jessica would retain her human intelligence and personality while gaining a few new traits as well, she would love to cuddle and be petted, and though she would wear clothing when in public, in the privacy of her own room she would prefer to be naked.<br />
<br />
For the final touch Melissa made it so that Jessica's clothing would not change with her and that the changes themselves would take five minutes.<br />
<br />
By the time Jessica returned from the bathroom her pants and panties were pushed down by a tail which was still only about six inches long, and her eyes had become a greenish gold. She smiled at Melissa, showing that her teeth were growing into the fangs of a mighty predator as her lips split and puffed out on their way to becoming a feline muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, have you decided on what else you want to do?&quot; Jessica asked, her voice taking on an odd, purring rasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, not really,&quot; Melissa lied, watching as Jessica's ears grew rounded and migrated upwards on her head.<br />
<br />
Jessica stretched in a very feline way, her nails extending into inch long claws even as her fingers became shorter and dark pads developed on the palms of her hands. Then she pulled a chair up next to Melissa and sat down, leaning forward a bit to accommodate for her tail, which was now a foot and half long. She kicked off her shoes, her claws already having poked holes in her socks, which she took off as well, revealing that her feet were perfect leopard paws.<br />
<br />
&quot;That feels better,&quot; she sighed, her voice growing deeper and more masculine as well, becoming more of a growl than a purr, &quot;I just don't know what's come over me all of a sudden.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her nose and mouth extended further into a muzzle, and long whiskers sprouted from her lips. When she spoke again long, sharp fangs were visible, &quot;I guess all of the excitement of the day is getting to me or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
By the time she finished speaking her hair had shortened to the point where it was just a patch of fur on her now feline head. Then it took on a golden color and spots formed. Once that happened her hair began to spread, slowly at first, but picking up speed until it covered her entire body, golden yellow on her back and arms, soft and while on her throat and stomach, or at least this was what Melissa assumed based on what she could see, Jessica was still wearing her clothes, as unnecessary as they were on her furry body.<br />
<br />
The finishing touches were taking place now, her hips narrowing, her shoulders widening and her body becoming more muscular as she completed her change into a jaguar man. The fur on her chin grew slightly longer, looking a bit like a goatee, which Melissa thought was a nice touch.<br />
<br />
Jessica's last changes were the most intimate and Melissa chanced looking down to watch as the front of her friend's jeans began to bulge out. Jessica twitched her tail, now nearly as long as she was tall, as her growing sheath pushed out above the top of her jeans. The pressure and sensations of the change must have been quite stimulating, for the tip of her cock was protruding out, deep red against the soft white fur of her stomach and sheath. Melissa found her eyes drawn to this new aspect of her friend's anatomy, surprised by its appearance. Jessica's cock had a head like a human's would, but it was deep red and slick looking, not to mention down the shaft there were small barbs like those that would be found on the cock of a cat.<br />
<br />
Seeing that Melissa was staring Jessica looked down, &quot;What, did I forget to button my fly or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her voice was a deep, feline growl, occasionally rising up into an angry sounding rasp. All in all it was quite threatening, making Melissa glad that she had kept her friend's personality the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, nothing. I didn't even realize I was staring at anything,&quot; remembering the rest mental changes she had added, Melissa then reached out to scratch Jessica behind the ears and was rewarded by her friend closing her eyes with bliss.<br />
<br />
&quot;That feels nice,&quot; Jessica rasped.</p>
