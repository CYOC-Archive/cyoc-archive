<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;John, what the hell just happened to me!&quot; Lucy screamed. John couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. It worked... IT WORKED. Oh, he was going to win her over now that he finally found a way to make her happy and more confident in herself. And, maybe he was delving deeper into his desires but she needn&#39;t worry about the hidden agenda. &quot; I told you it would make you happy look at you you&#39;re stunning.&quot;<br />
Lucy looked at him then back down at her modest C-cups. She&#39;s never really felt this good to be this curvy her ass wasn&#39;t the biggest around but her butt was indeed there. It still felt like she was missing something though.<br />
John looked at her while he sat down on his bed. Gazing into her eyes hoping to see the joy and love in her eyes for him helping her but all he saw was curiosity. Then, it struck him she doesn&#39;t just want boobs she wants what he wants massive huge tits that are perfect, hell, more than perfect- divine tits that have no comparison. That isn&#39;t his only thought though, as he also thinks of what she likes though shes never explicitly told him he&#39;s always thought of her as being a size queen- this fuels some of the friendzone that she does he just doesn&#39;t know it- He&#39;s the scrawny runt of the class and for the life of him he can&#39;t gain a pound of muscle despite himself. &quot; Hey, Lucy can I ask you something?&quot; John sheepishly questions Lucy. <br />
&quot;Sure, What&#39;s wrong Hon?&quot; She asks, despite subconsciously calling him the nickname that she only uses in her dreamland.<br />
John thinks for a moment rose coloring his cheeks. &quot;Well, I was wondering... uh... areyouasizequeen?&quot; John rushes out.<br />
Lucy stares at her crush since 3rd grade. he&#39;s cute when he&#39;s flustered. she thinks to herself. &quot; What?&quot; Lucy phrases. <br />
John takes a big gulp of air helping him calm his nerves. He looks at the laying beauty in front of him and requests &quot; Are you a size queen?&quot; Lucy jerks her head to look at the boy sitting nearly on top of her that she gets dizzy. &quot; What?! umm....I,&quot; she blushes. &quot; I... yes, yes I am.&quot; Lucy sits up to meet her short best friend. &quot; Please, don&#39;t hate me, John.&quot; she sighs.<br />
John looks at Lucy with sad eyes. he hates seeing her sad like this throughout high school she&#39;s been depressed that she wasn&#39;t in the same league as other girls or that she wasn&#39;t up to other men&#39;s standards of what a beautiful woman is. He puts his hand on his lap. *kashink*<br />
Lucy looks down at the noise. eyes wide in amazement, and glowing with an idea. &quot; John, why don&#39;t you take a pill if it helped me I&#39;m sure it can help you, I mean I know that you don&#39;t want to be the school runt anymore. With this, you could be the biggest most popular guy in school.&quot; he instantly comes back with &quot; As long as you are my most popular girl.&quot;<br />
The two teenagers sit and stare at each other in awed silence John staring into calm emerald green eyes and Lucy staring back with the intent to get lost in his shy blue orbs. The trance is broken however by Lucy&#39;s phone ringing. &quot; It&#39;s my mom, I told her that I would be here when she got home from work It&#39;ll be really quick. Lucy grabs her phone and walks out of the room.<br />
John however ponders her words. Could this work on him? Trevor said that both sexes could use it but it had adverse effects after sex if both parties have taken the drug. Yeah, to hell with it, if it means he gets to call Lucy his then he damn well please her, now shouldn&#39;t he.<br />
John looks at his door and then down at the pill bottle just inches from his face. He thinks for a moment will my growth be all over like Lucy&#39;s was? He stops himself before he can psyche himself out of it. He twists the safety cap on the orange medical bottle and pours out two capsules. &quot;One for me and one for Luce.&quot; Just then Lucy comes in with an upset expression. &quot; My mom doesn&#39;t understand that I want to make myself happy something clicked in my brain when I took that pill it&#39;s like my confidence went up a notch on a dial I want it to go up some more John I want to be confident enough to tell my mom to stop treating me like I&#39;m 6 I want to look like I&#39;m seventeen not like a ten-year-old late bloomer.&quot; she vents.<br />
&quot; Okay here,&quot; John hands her the pill. &quot; we swallow on three ready?&quot;<br />
ONE...<br />
<br />
TWO...<br />
<br />
THREE...<br />
The teenagers swallow the medication in their hands<br />
Lucy begins to feel the change right away; she was waiting for it this time to hit. She falls to her knees and clutches her stomach, feeling the muscles twitch and spasm as they tighten accommodating her new lifestyle (What they didn&#39;t know was that the medication that was given to them was not only an enhancement on your looks it also gave you enhancements that you so desperately need. It doesn&#39;t always work in the person&#39;s favor though, In this case, it seems that what they need is what they desire.) Her core and back tenses as a brutal pain wash over her as all of her muscles grow and her library and lasting baby fat wash away into what is now her athletic body. Her body is now fit and you can visibly tell she has six-pack abs from all the flips and tricks she does being as how she&#39;s no the captain of the cheer squad and gymnastics team. This time however she doesn&#39;t pass out. &quot;Oh wow, that felt amazing.&quot; Lucy squealed. But, it wasn&#39;t over yet as now her C-cup breasts started to tingle with an all-around sensation as they slowly started to fill out. Bigger and bigger still, What she was focusing on however was not her boobs nor her hips and ass it was her waist not only did she develop the muscle she needed to have 4th grade to senior year athletic ability in all three of her activities, but it also seems like her waist has shrunk in on itself creating a growing ever prominent hourglass figure. with her growth finally slowing down her new measurements are as follows:<br />
Bust: forty- eight E-cup<br />
Waist: 18 inches<br />
Hips: 26 inches<br />
<br />
On the other side of the room, John looks on as he enjoys his soon-to-be girlfriend&#39;s changes and how much it&#39;s turning him on. His tiny pin of a dick (If you could even call it that) was flapping up and down in a merry-go-round of arousal and thoughts of manipulation. He hadn&#39;t taken his med yet like he said he was, but the more times he thought about his original plans. The more he thinks the more he doubts. What should I do, he asks himself.</p>
