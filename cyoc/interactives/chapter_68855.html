<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The door began to creek open and Jess grabbed the Chronivac and swung it to the newcomer. Thankfully she stopped when she spotted Zoe standing on a crutch, struggling to hold the door ajar by herself.<br />
“Interesting greeting, were you going to mute me or just turn me off completely?” She quipped in a lighthearted tone.<br />
“Sorry” Jess replied putting the remote down on her bag and rushing over to hold the door. “I thought you were someone else”<br />
“I’m sure glad I’m not them. That remote could take someone’s eye out.” She laughed as she hobbled over to the bench.<br />
Jess sat down beside her as she began to peel off her socks. “Are you okay”<br />
“Yeah” She said forcing a smile. “Coach said I’ll be off for about a month.”<br />
“WHAT! The game with Tandy Gardens is in two weeks!” Jess exclaimed. She needed Zoe, if for nothing else than moral support. “What’s coach said about Millie?”<br />
 “That it was a foul but there’s not much we can do about it now. Millie’s in there now talking to her.”<br />
The two sat as Zoe continued to undress, wincing as she got to the injured leg. She pulled off her top and unclasped the sports bra. It took Jess a minute to realize that she was sitting quite comfortably next to a topless girl who until this morning was just a very athletic female friend to a slightly weedy nerdy boy. She had to catch herself from staring too much. The other girls who’d undressed had passed by her notice but for some reason Zoe made Jess’ catch her breath. Zoe didn’t seem to notice and carried on oblivious. “You going to shower to?” She asked, noticing Jess still just sitting there.<br />
Truth be told Jess was a little nervous now. Until a moment ago she’d have showered without hesitation but this would be her first time exploring her body in complete nudity and in the shower, and on top of that she was in the company of one of her best friends who she had now decided she was extremely attracted to. Maybe setting the mental slider to 50% was a mistake. She quickly disrobed herself, pausing as her bra and panties were discarded, leaving the two completely naked and alone in each other’s company.<br />
Zoe again was oblivious as she attempted to hop towards the shower by herself. “Easy there,” Jess said catching her arm and looping it over her shoulders.<br />
“Thanks,” Zoe smiled back. Briefly her hand brushed against Jess’ naked breast and Jess decided to hasten their entry into the shower before any evidence of her growing infatuation became clear. The shower water began to run and Jess decided to turn the temp on hers down a notch just to help her out, but it didn’t. Her attention kept drifting back to Zoe showering mere inches away. Her hands deftly navigated her body, which was leaning against the shower wall, and Jess found her hand momentarily lingering at her precious spot.<br />
A slip and Zoe dropped her soap. She reached down but lost her balance. Zoe found herself falling and Jess quickly embraced her to steady her. Zoe’s wait rested forward as Jess held her. Their breasts touched, their breathing was heavy and they looked at each other for a moment.<br />
“I should be more care…” Zoe began but was cut off  by Jess’ lips rapping around hers. This caught both girls by surprise as it clearly wasn’t what either had been expecting. The moment seemed to last an eterinity as the warmth of the showers ran down there embraced bodies, there lips softly locked together. Jess pulled back gently, looking into Zoe’s eyes. Zoe quickly darted her gaze away and Jess knew she’d made a mistake. She may even have just lost her best friend.<br />
“I’m sorry,” Jess began as she quickly tried to rectify the situation. “I didn’t mean..”<br />
“No, it’s alright.” Zoe cut her off. “Truth be told, I kinda liked it. I dunno Jess, I’m straight, but with you, just then…” Her voice trailed off as she lingered. “I kinda always had this niggle at the back of my mind. You’re not like any of the girls, or guys I’ve ever known and…” She paused as they looked at each other, and this time it was Zoe who made the advance. She dived forward, embracing her lips with Jess’ once again, and now attacking her more vigorously. <br />
Steam rose around the pair as their hands began to travel up and down each other’s backs, there breast tightly pressed together. It was wrong, they both knew it. It was in the locker room showers for Christ’s sake. But in that instant, in that moment of passion, nothing else mattered.<br />
Jess felt her hands drop and she unconsciously brought them round to Zoe’s midriff. She felt herself begin the slow journey down. Unlike Jess, Zoe wasn’t bare, but her neatly trimmed pubic region was slight and delicate and she clearly took care of it daily. She felt herself brush past it, lingering, circling it as she did. Then she felt it. The moist folds of Zoe’s entrance. It was just like her own, but someone seemed more magical. She stroked it up and down once or twice and felt Zoe suddenly grow heavy in her arms. She had to catch her weight with the other hand so as to relieve any pressure on Zoe’s injured leg.  She probed and carefully, pushed it aside and entered with a single finger. She was amazed and took the moment to analyze the situation. She was currently engaged in passionate love with her childhood friend. More than that, it was lesbian love, and she hadn’t been a girl for more than 24 hours.<br />
She began to pump in and out, slowly at first and then with more speed. The repeated kissing was broken by desperate gasp by Zoe. The short hair was drenched now from both the shower and the sweat and she threw her head back as Jess, with the limited knowledge on the process she had, began to finger her. Zoe reached around and grabbed her ass, and pulled her closer, and Jess felt her own moist region against the back of her hand. It didn’t matter, she wanted this for Zoe, not her. She continued to pound in and out with two fingers, twisting and experimenting. Zoe didn’t seem to care as it was clear on her face that she was near the edge.<br />
She looked once more into Jess’s eyes before finally throwing her head back and arching her back. The juices spurted all over Jess’s hands and Jess had to catch and gently lower Zoe to the floor, quickly turning off the shower as well. The sat next to each other for a moment, panting. Zoe wanted to speak but couldn’t, and Jess didn’t have a clue what to say.<br />
Jess looked into Zoe’s eyes and held her gaze for a minute. With grin she brought her soaked hand to her mouth and tasted the still fresh juices on it. Zoe chuckled in response and laid her head back against the wall. Whatever were they going to do now.</p>
