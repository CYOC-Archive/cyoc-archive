<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emily noticed a 3rd isle and promptly walked over it. There were various human skin parts, ranging from very small to massive. However, the thing that caught her attention the most was a giant plastic bag that was nearly full with skin. It was almost as tall as her and 8 times as wide. She tried to pull out but only fell back trying. The old man noticed her trouble and walked over to help.<br />
&quot;Need some help getting this suit?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I was just looking for what this is.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh never mind that, the best part is the surprise. Heck, you seem like a nice young lady. So how aout this, I give you this suit for free!&quot;<br />
&quot;Free?! But this seems so expensive!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ah, These are dime a dozen.&quot;<br />
&quot;If you say so.&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll ship it to your house tomorrow, is that good?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure that&#39;s fine.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright just sign this contract you&#39;ll be set!&quot; the old man said handing Emily the page. She quickly signed it and watched as he took out a dolly and lifted the massive crate, carrying it to a room in the back.<br />
&quot;I wonder what&#39;s it going to be?&quot; Emily thought.<br />
<br />
It was the next day and Emily just got down freshening up. Suddenly the doorbell rang as she went downstairs. She opened the door to see 2 delivery men from the store with a giant box. Emily let them in and helped them with the giant package. She signed the shipping form and watch them drive off. She faced back at the giant box and took a a pair of scissors to open it. Inside was the same bag with the same suit she saw in the store. She pulled out a 40lb face mask and awkwardly stared at it. It had the form of an extremely obese woman. It had 2 chins and cheeks the size of baseballs. It seemed to only cover up only to her hairline and left open eye sockets. Emily carefully placed it on her table.<br />
&quot;So I chose an obese woman. Great. At least the suit matches my skin,&quot; Emily said, slightly annoyed.<br />
She tried to pull out the rest of the suit but it was much too heavy for her. She took her scissors and spent a good 5 minutes cutting out the side. The suit merely flopped out showing more of what Emily got herself into.<br />
&quot;Holy shit this thing is massive!&quot; Emily exclaimed.<br />
The stomach was bigger than her recliner and felt just as soft. A pair of sagging boobs hung like racks of meat. She barely managed to push the suit to its side only to see 2 gigantic cheeks connected to log-sized legs and rolls on her back. The arms looked like cascading cone and had fatty sausage fingers. Along with mounds of fat, the suit had a large zipper on the back. Emily pulled it down and sure enough, there was an area for her to put it on.<br />
She sighed and said,&quot;Well I got it for free, might as well not put it to waste.&quot;<br />
Emily took off all her clothes and did her best to pull up the suit to try to get her legs fitted into the suit. She then put her arms through the socks and wriggled her fingers, barely being able to do so. She then attempted to zip up the suit, but could barely do so with it hindering her arms. Then it hit her; she just turned around, took her arms out, then just zipped it form the outside. When the suit was zipped and was fitting snugly on her body, Emily tried to reach for the mask, but could barely make it from her giant stomach. She waddled forward, trying not lose her balance. Luckily, her chubby fingers managed to grip on to the mask. She slowly slid it on to her head and it somehow was a perfect fit.<br />
&quot;Wow, these fit my measurements perfectly. Each slot was a snug fit to me body. And this mask blends in with my skin so well like it was apart of my body,&quot; Emily admiring the craftsmanship.<br />
She waddled to the nearest mirror, looked at herself, and said,&quot;Wow, so this is what I look like as a super obese woman. My stomach is huge, and my tits are like beanbags. And my ass, it&#39;s so soft.&quot;<br />
Suddenly, Emily felt a cool breeze around and she shuddered. &quot;Why is it so cold all of a sudden? This suit felt really warm just a second ago! I need to get this off of me to see,&quot; Emily said reaching for her mask. She started to pull off her mask but it wouldn&#39;t come, like it was glued to her face. Hell, she could even feel her hands reaching through her chins.<br />
&quot;This is getting freaky... I need to get this off me, like right now!&quot; she said, starting to panic. She waddled to her kitchen, requiring large amounts of effort to lift one a leg an inch up. Emily took a knife and started to push it through her arm until she felt it actually stab through her.<br />
Dropping the knife in fear, she said,&quot;Holy shit what&#39;s going on?! It&#39;s like my body is the suit!&quot;<br />
Finally, she tried one more thing. Emily tried to retract her arms from the suit but to her unfortunate surprise, all that did was put pressure on her shoulder. At this point she knew; the suit had fused with her own body.<br />
&quot;Oh my god, how could this even happen?! I&#39;m so damn obese and I can barely move around! What am I going to do?&quot; Emily screamed.<br />
After a few minutes of pinching herself and squeezing her body to conform that this was real, she finally gave in and plopped on the couch tearing up a bit.<br />
&quot;So this is going to be my life now, just an obese bag of flesh. Great. Well I might as well explore this body more,&quot; Emily said, with a disappointing tone.<br />
She decided to go to the room a 180 degree mirror, which was her own room. The bad part was that her room was on the 2nd floor. Sighing, Emily slowly made her way to the stairs, where she looked at the seemingly never ending steps. The first step was hard as all hell. She could barely lift her leg up to half the stairs height with out nearly falling so Emily had to turn her body sideways, lean on the railing, nearly consuming it with stomach, then lift the leg onto the step. Then she had to turn her body the other way, pull on the railing, and get her second leg up. It took a whole hour for her make up to the last step.<br />
&quot;One more step... so close to the half mark...&quot; Emily thought, gasping for air.<br />
She was so tired that she could barely lift her leg, but she was too exhausted to notice that her leg didn&#39;t make it up. Her second leg slipped on the railing, causing Emily to lose her grip and slowly plummet down the stairs.<br />
&quot;Noooo!&quot; She thought trying to reach for the railing.<br />
Her body just rolled down the stairs at a reasonable pace, making a loud creaking noise each step. It was until the last step where there was a loud splatting sound. Luckily her entire body broke her fall, but she landed on her stomach.<br />
&quot;Oooowww... that was was really painful, and my stomach is now starting to really hurt...&quot; Emily whimpered.<br />
Rocking her body up from side to side, she was able get herself on to her giant ass. Next she grabbed the beginning railing of the staircase to get herself upright. This took about another hour and finally, Emily was up.<br />
<br />
Then...</p>
