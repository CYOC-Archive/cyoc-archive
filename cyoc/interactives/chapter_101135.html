<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mary drank, she could feel her body begin to grow larger. She began to take larger gulps, swallowing more of the liquid with each mouthful.  Out of the corner of her eye she could see the other ant doing the same thing, racing her to finish and competing for more of the magical liquid.  Mary could see that she was winning, though.  Her body was almost twice the size of the other ant.<br />
<br />
Mary finished the last of the potion, and waited for her changes to finish. As Mary continued to grow she could feel her body gaining more human features.  Her appendages became shorter and more flexible.  Her single clawed digit split into three opposable digits.  Her exoskeleton became smoother and more flexible.  Her thorax narrowed, and she saw the bulge of two small breasts beneath her exoskeleton.  Her wings fell off, a dead husk on the ground.  Her mandibles shrank slightly, and receded a little into her mouth. But the changes soon stopped.  Mary was frustrated that she had not drunk enough.  She was even more upset that her abdomen was still large and swollen.  And churning.<br />
<br />
She grabbed the bowl, hoping to find more of the liquid.  Finding it empty, she angrily threw it to the ground with a clatter.  She heard a frightened skittering, and turned to see the other ant cowering in a corner.  It was a hybrid like her, part ant and part human.  But the ant was smaller than her, and its abdomen was much more compact. But judging by its hourglass figure and the prominent bulges on its chest, Mary could tell it was female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look what you&#39;ve done, you stupid little ant, &quot; said Mary angrily.  Her voice sounded strange, almost mechanical. But at least she was capable of human speech.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry, my Queen.  I was only thirsty, and sought nourishment.  I did not mean to take what was yours.  I will find you more, if you spare me,&quot; said the ant pitifully.<br />
<br />
Queen? thought Mary.  So that&#39;s why I was so much bigger, and why I had the wings.  And why they wanted to mate with me. <br />
<br />
Mary shuddered at the thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, your highness.  I know that I am not one of your brood, but if you allow me to become a part of your colony, I will be a loyal worker, &quot; said the female ant, as it crawled towards her.<br />
<br />
Hmm, thought Mary.  She might be useful.  At least until I can get back to normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay, &quot; hissed Mary.  She noticed that half of her communication was oral, and the rest was through scents.  She could smell her own anger, as well as this pitiful ant&#39;s fear.  &quot;The first thing you can do for your Queen is find me some more nourishment - more water.  It will be in a vial labeled &#39;Human&#39;&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;A vial, your highness? What is that? &quot; asked the female ant. &quot;And I am afraid I cannot read the human language.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary groaned, and rubbed her hands across her face.  She started to explain when she was racked by a sudden ache in her abdomen.  She groaned again, this time in pain rather than in frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my Queen.  You are in pain,&quot; said the female ant.  &quot;Please lay down.  I will make a soft nest for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The female ant helped Mary to lay down on her back.  Her large swollen abdomen protruded from between her legs.  It ached, and she rubbed it for comfort.  The female ant quickly began to look around the closet for materials to make a nest.  She was small - about 3 feet by Mary&#39;s estimation - but surprisingly strong.  She easily tore apart large boards, boxes and other materials. Soon she had arranged a nest around Mary.<br />
<br />
Mary groaned again, as the pain increased.  A small amount of fluid began to drip from her abdominal orifice.  Slowly, a small smooth white oval object slid out of her abdomen.  The female ant ran over and scooped it up with excitement.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What ... what is that?&quot; asked Mary, confused and tired.<br />
<br />
&quot;My Queen, this is something special.  The first of your brood, and the beginning of your colony, &quot; said the female ant excitedly, as she began to clean it.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, &quot; mumbled Mary.  She could feel the pressure building again, and she fought to contain it.  &quot;Water... I need the water.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, my Queen.  You will need much nourishment.  You must be very parched.  Here drink this, &quot; said the female ant, as she handed Mary a bowl of water.<br />
<br />
Mary drank it greedily.  The female ant was right.  She was very thirsty, and too tired to question the origin of the water.  It was only after she finished half of the bowl and quenched her thirst that she began to wonder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, where did you get this?  Did you find that vial?&quot; asked Mary weakly.  Her thirst was satisfied, but her abdomen felt even worse.  It felt like it was swelling even larger in her hands, and the pressure inside was magnified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, my Queen.  I am sorry, but I do not know what a vial is.  But this water looked just like the one we drank from before.  It was in the same kind of holder.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary went pale.  The only other bowl she had prepared contained the contents of the &quot;Growth&quot; vial. She examined the bowl in her hand, and her fears were realized.  She had just drunk a massive dose of the growth vial.<br />
<br />
Her body began to respond to the compound, rapidly stretching longer and thicker.  Her abdomen was particularly receptive, and swelled disproportionately larger than the rest of  her body.  She could feel the pressure increasing, as the eggs in her abdomen rapidly multiplied and increased in size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my, &quot; said the female ant.  &quot;You are responding very well to the nourishment.  You will make  a very powerful Queen, and your colony will have no equal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, &quot; said Mary weakly, as she continued to grow. &quot;I need the vial - the long clear tube.  It can stop this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, your highness, you are becoming so big and strong.  And your progeny will be equally powerful.  You must not be thinking clearly.  Here, have some more water, &quot; said the female ant, as she tried to pour more of the liquid from the bowl into her mouth.<br />
<br />
Mary was now double her size, and easily slapped the bowl away, sending it clattering into the hallway.  The struggle caused her to lose control of her abdominal muscles, and two more eggs slid out.  They were much larger than the first.  Mary struggled to contain the eggs leaking from her abdomen.  The female ant wordlessly scooped up the eggs, and began to take them out of the closet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!  Where are you going with those things?&quot; asked Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am talking them somewhere safe while the hive is prepared.  Don&#39;t worry.  I will return soon with food - for them and for you.  Just relax, your highness. You are very fertile.  Soon, your colony will be thriving, &quot; said the female ant, as she exited the room.<br />
<br />
Mary grunted as she continued to grow.  The closet now felt small and confined.  She tried to stand, but her abdomen had grown too large and every movement allowed more eggs to escape from her abdomen.  She was too large to turn over in the small room.  But she had to do something.  Soon she would grow out of this room, and then the police would find another monster here.  She had to find that vial before it was too late.  Or maybe she could just make her way back to the apartment and try a different vial.</p>
