<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tony's body was slick with sweat from the ten mile bicycle ride home. His thighs ached because he was detoured by construction through the Dell. That meant pedalling uphill for the last 3 miles. He hung up his bike in the garage, and climbed the steps to his one-room apartment over the garage. He kicked off his shoes. Then he yawned, and stretched out on his bed.  He had intended to only rest for a few minutes, but he was soon fast asleep. <br />
<br />
Around 4 AM, Tony woke up and climbed out of bed.  He stumbled to the bathroom. He unzipped and peeled off his cycling suit and socks. He turned on the shower, and turned to the toilet to take a piss. His bare skin felt cold, but his junk still felt warm. His hand grabbed his crotch and he felt fabric. He looked down, he was still wearing that jockstrap. It was odd because it didn't really feel like he was wearing anything. <br />
<br />
He yawned, &quot;A jockstrap that's so comfortable, I forgot I was wearing it. Wow!&quot;<br />
<br />
His thumbs pressed against his sides trying to slip into the waistband, but there was so purchase. He started to panic. He felt his hands ride all around himself. The straps were like part of him. Nowhere was there any breech between the fabric and his skin. His cock and balls were still free inside the pouch. He could manipulate them through the fabric, but he couldn't touch them directly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn that McGurk!&quot; he blurted out. The coach did have a reputation of being a practical joker, and he had handed Tony the jockstrap and insisted that he put it on. He had also made sure that Tony would be the last to leave today, so if he had discovered the prank then, there wouldn't have been anyone to help. Tony thought about getting a scissors and cutting off the jockstrap, or maybe going to the hospital.<br />
<br />
The sound of the shower gave Tony an idea. &quot;I bet hot water will soften the glue. Then on Monday, I can be wearing this jock when I see McGurk.&quot; <br />
<br />
He climbed into the shower, turned the temperature up and started lathering like crazy.<br />
<br />
Ryan was terrified, when he heard Tony's thoughts regarding the scissors being used on him. When Tony had fallen asleep, Ryan had lain there wrapped around his loins absorbing his essence. It was sort of like suckling at the breast. Ryan dozed off too. He dreamt of being human. It was a weird homoerotic dream. He didn't know Coach Pacheco that well. He had only been at the school this year, and was only about 10 years older than Ryan himself. <br />
<br />
In his dream, Ryan got to know the muscular man. Pacheco was shorter than Ryan, but he was solid muscle. Ryan found the odor and flavor of Tony's junk much more satisfying than that kid Vinnie's junk had been. Ryan dreamt of being in bed as a naked man with naked Tony. He was somewhat horrified at the prospect, but the emotions of desire, pleasure and lust outweighed the emotion of revulsion. He was dreaming of passionately kissing and creaming the hunky coach, when he was awakened by Tony's fingers trying to pry his waistband from Tony's skin.<br />
<br />
He knew there was no glue, but he hoped the hotwater would loosen  him up, but he had his doubts.  He had to figure away to communicate with Coach Pacheco. The hotwater and soap felt good on his skin or rather fabric. He enjoyed the feel of Tony's hands massaging him, and he started massaging Tony's junk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, it's almost like the jockstrap is alive,&quot; moaned Tony as the water beat down on his jockstrap wrapped boner. He threw back his head, arched his back and exploded into the jockstrap. He felt spent as he leaned back against the tiled shower wall and let the hot water beat down on him.<br />
<br />
Tony's mind drifted back to the students. Youth truly was waisted on the young. Tony wasn't old, but he wasn't 18 anymore. If he knew then what he knew now...<br />
<br />
Tony felt reinvigorated. He breathed deeply opened his eyes, and reached for the shower control. He blinked.  His hand wasn't his hand. It was bigger. The skin was lighter, there were fewer hairs and they were blond, the fingernails were unevenly cut, and the scar on his wrist was missing. He looked at the strange hand moving as he wanted his hand to move. It was his hand. He reached with his other hand they were a matched set. He ran his hand over the light hairs on his arm. He could feel his touch. The hairs felt silkier than his, the skin felt softer, and younger.<br />
<br />
He stepped out of the shower without turning it off, wiped the steam from the mirror and examined his new reflection. He recognized the image he saw in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I'm Ryan Standish?&quot; <br />
<br />
Tony spun around to check his backside. His fraternity's Greek letter tattoo was gone. He paused to admire his new muscular butt muscles. He had always thought Standish's ass was the kid's best feature.<br />
<br />
Ryan felt himself changing, but he was still a jockstrap. The cock inside him wasn't as thick as it had been. The garlicky taste and scent was gone. It tasted sweeter with a soapy, slightly spicy taste. There was something familiar about the new manhood inside Ryan.<br />
<br />
Tony's hand went to the pouch of his jockstrap and moved it to one side. He had to see his cock and balls. Had they changed too? He noticed that the jockstrap was different. It still felt like it was part of him, but it was darker and it had a logo which was identical to Tony's frattoo.<br />
<br />
He discovered the pouch lifted aside to reveal blond pubes and and cock of Ryan Standish.  Young and horny, Tony remembered that Ryan's girlfriend was that hot Stacy girl.  Thinking about her he suddenly recalled Ryan's memory that Stacy was expecting Ryan to pick her up at 10 AM to go up to Six Flags for the day. He also remembered that Ryan usually had hot sex with Stacy in the bushes behind the Tilt-A-Whirl.  Tony had been between lovers for a while, and was now looking forward to scoring with Stacy.<br />
<br />
Ryan in the meantime was shocked and confused.  He was seeing himself through his eyes, but it wasn't him - he was still a jockstrap. He was now his own jockstrap?  No, he was Tony's jockstrap, the fraternity letters were burned into his being or embroidered. He suddenly felt closer to Tony, and he didn't even mind that Tony was planning on impersonating Ryan to have sex with Ryan's girlfriend. In fact, Ryan almost felt sorry for Tony, Stacy would really rip into him for not making Vinnie miss Phys Ed yesterday.<br />
<br />
Tony knew he'd need Ryan's car and ID. So he quickly dressed in some cargo shorts and an oversized jersey. Shoes were a problem, since Ryan's feet were bigger. Tony wore some flip flops down to his motorcycle and drove back to school.  He used his coach's keys to get into Ryan's locker, and retrieve Ryan's wallet, keys and clothes. He drove Ryan's car to Ryan's house. It was a little before 6 AM. Tony snuck up Ryan's back stairs and checked out Ryan's room.  He was impressed with all the stuff Ryan had. There was a 32 inch flat screen tv, a gaming computer, lots of nice clothing, a couple of iPods, and a Bowflex and weight set.<br />
<br />
He found the stash of Ryan's cash in the top drawer, as he selected some clothes to wear to theme park. He also grabbed a couple of condoms. Tony still hadn't figured out that Ryan was his jockstrap, but for some reason he wasn't concerned about Ryan catching him.<br />
<br />
He drove over to Stacy's house.<br />
<br />
At 7AM he knocked on Stacy's door.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; growled Stacy opening the door almost immediately. She had recognized the sound of Ryan's muscle car engine when it pulled up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Stacy, I know I'm early, but I just had to see you. Want to go out for breakfast?&quot; Tonyryan asked licking his lips and looking lasciviously at Stacy in her bathrobe.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't call, you didn't return my calls, and-&quot;<br />
<br />
Impulsively, Tonyryan leaned forward and kissed Stacy cutting off her speech.  He pulled away after 30 seconds, and licked his lips.<br />
<br />
He lied, &quot;I'm sorry. My old phone's not working. I got a new one with a new number.&quot; He held up his (Coach Tony's) iPhone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then what about Vinnie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vinnie?&quot; Tonyryan asked as Ryan's memories poured back. He realized that Ryan was now his jockstrap and that wimpy Vinnie had done it to him. He looked upset and confused. Stacy stared at him.<br />
<br />
Tonyryan stammered, &quot;I'm sorry, Stace. Uh, Coach Pacheco showed up, and I couldn't do what you wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose if the coach was there, you couldn't do anything. That Pacheco's a weirdo, I bet he and gay Vinnie are butt pirates.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tonyryan was a bit offended at Tony being called a butt pirate.  He had thought all the girls were lusting after his hot latino body. <br />
<br />
Ryantony was shocked to discover Tony's errant memories spewing out at the buttpirate comment. Coach Pacheco was bi, and had had as much cock and he had pussy. All those rumors about fraternities were true. Or last were true with regard to Antonio Pacheco's fraternity. The jockstrap pouch contracted and relaxed of its own volition making Tonyryan's cock rock hard. Ryan was amazed at how big a turn-on all these memories of gay sexual experiences were to him. The heterosexual ones were pretty hot too. He blinked as he considered his own college career. He already had the feeling that Tony was planning to take over Ryan's life, and relive his college days.<br />
<br />
It was weird to smell Stacy's scent through Ryantony's nose, while smelling Ryantony's manhood at the same time. Ryan wondered how the Ryantony would have sex with Stacy. Would he be able to take the jockstrap off? If he did would he become Tony again?<br />
<br />
Ryantony sat in the living room, while Stacy went upstairs to dress.</p>
