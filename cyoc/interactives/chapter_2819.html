<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It did not take them long to reach Officer Randy Kempe's home.  It was a small house, one story, set in the midst of a quaint residential area jyust outside of town.  The front yeard was nicely mowed, the hedges next to his front door trimmed, but otherwise without decoration.  There did not appear to be much of a backyard, as the neighbouring houses were all fairly close.  But he did appear to have a patio.
<br />

<br />
Jared could hardly wait to get out of the car.  He felt a need to run, one that he could only chalk up to the emerging canine instincts.  During his stay in the pound, he'd found that they were useful, and had trusted them, even though he might have wished to do otherwise.  So far, they had not failed him once.  If his body told him he needed to run, he would run!
<br />

<br />
Randy grabbed his collar just as he bolted out the driver's side door, &quot;Woah boy, slow down there!&quot; he said, even as Jared felt his claws digging into the pleasant grass.  
<br />

<br />
Turning his head, he looked hopefully ack at the policeman.  Randy made a fist and brought it up to his chest with one hand, but Jared just kept staring at him, wondering what that could mean.  Was Randy going to hit him?
<br />

<br />
&quot;Okay, I guess you don't know the hand signals.  Sit!&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Jared did as instructed, knowing that if he was going to be a police dog, then he'd have to obey Kempe's commands like a real dog, as demeaning as it was.  Still, at Randy's pleasant laugh, and the patting between his ears that he received, he knew that there would be no shame in having a partner like this one.  Inwardly, Jared laughed, he'd sometimes thought about being a cop, but he'd never thought it could happen like this!
<br />

<br />
&quot;Down!&quot; Randy pointed at the ground.  Jared laid down on his belly.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Stay!&quot; Randy held out his hand, palm to Jared's nose.  He sniffed at it, but remained as he was.
<br />

<br />
The policeman walked over towards his door, unlocked it, and opene dit wide.  Jared remained where he was.  He really did not want to have to be in training for very long.  After all, they wouldn't let a dog in training get anywhere near the evidence lockers.  
<br />

<br />
&quot;Come!&quot; Randy called, gesturing at the side of his leg with a pointing finger.  Jared jumped up from his spot by the car and ran over to the officer, standing, panting slightly.
<br />

<br />
Randy smiled and patted his head, ruffling the fur, hugging him around his neck. &quot;Ah, you have been trained some already boy.  Good boy!  We'll be out on the streets in no time.  You are one smart dog, boy.&quot; He then stood up, and ushered Jared inside his home.
<br />

<br />
The house was air conditioned, for which Jared was grateful.  Panting did not cool him off nearly as much as he would have liked.  The first room looked to be his living room.  There was a couch set against one wall wityh a large TV and video cabinet against the other.  Dark curtains graced each of the windows, while a lovely dark tan carpet covered the floor.  It felt soft beneath his paws, and it muffled the click of his claws.  Despite the dark colours, the room had a warm light.  It was hard to believe that this belonged to a bachelor, as it ws quite well kept.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Are ya hungry boy?&quot; Randy asked, stepping towards the one doorway.  It led to a hallway, but this one had a wood floor. He could see the linoleum of the kitchen just beyond.
<br />

<br />
Jared's tail began to wag, and he felt himself salivating.  He followed Randy into the kitchen.  A rather sizable dog bowl ws waiting for him, as well as a water dish.  Randy first filled the water dish from the tap an set it on the floor.  Greedily, Jared lapped at it, the coolness of it refreshing.  He'd not realized just how parched he'd become.  
<br />

<br />
It was clear that Randy was well prepared to be taking care of a dog like him.  He had a special diet brand of dog kibbles under his sink that he poured into the bowl.  He even took out a can of dog food and mixed that in.  
<br />

<br />
Now, Jared had always detested the scent of dog food, when he was human that is.  But now, his canine nostrils picked up the flavour of beef and bacon mixed together, and he found it irresistable.  Randy barely had the dish upon the floor before he was savagely sating his hunger with the stuff.
<br />

<br />
He was aware of Randy patting him once on the head and then returning to the living room where he flipped on the TV to a baseball game.  Jared enjoyed watching baseball, he remembered going to some of the local games with his Dad.  He felt a twinge of melancholy as he remembered that.  His Dad was probably worried to death about him, wondering where he'd gotten to, what had becoe of him.  Did they think some kidnapper had absconded him?  Did they fear he'd run away?  Jaed said a few prayers hoping to soothe his family's misery.  He hoped he'd be able to get back to them soon.
<br />

<br />
And then, just as he'd finished saying &quot;A-men&quot; he'd also finished with his dinner.  Returning to thew ater dish, he lapped at it a few more times, washing the flavour down, and then headed over towards the hallway.  To his left it headed down to what looked like a garage that was made over into a workroom.  There was a dog door within it, and he poked his nose underneath.  The scent of oil and grease flooded his nose, and he drew himself back.  Kempe must have had another dog before.  He wonder what happened to it.
<br />

<br />
At the other end of the hallway was a bathroom, a small den with a computer and some bookshelves, and the man's bedroom.  A small house, but well kept, and decent.  Inside the bedroom, Jared spied a tall mirror set against one wall.  Padding on over, Jared took a moment to look over himself.  Yet, he was a German Shepherd all right, the same dark nose, deep brown fur, chocolate eyes, perked ears, and long whip tail.  Certianly a handsome dog.  Were he still a boy, he'd wish to pet and scratch such a creature.  But now, he was the dog.  Jared was a dog, and there was nothing he could about it unless he was able to get that medallion back.
<br />

<br />
Turning around, Jared wandered back down the hallway and into the living room.  Randy smiled as he saw him enter, and patted at his side on the couch.  Tensing his muscles, Jared jumped up besie him, and turned around.  Randy bgan to run his nails along behind his ears, something that Jared really enjoyed.  Being scratched was so much more pleasant when he had fur.
<br />

<br />
Out of the corner of one eye, he could see that Randy was smiling.  Perhaps being his canine partner would not be so bad after all.</p>
