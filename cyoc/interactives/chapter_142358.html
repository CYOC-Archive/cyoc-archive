<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Grraaauuuunnnnnh!&quot; Jake honked semi-angrily as the sound of his semi-irritation as his younger siblings getting their time with Annie. As far as Jake saw things, Annie was HIS mother and he was a bit jealous that the new hatchlings Beatrix, May, and Tyrone getting all the time with Annie, particularly as he was still nursing as well, though as his first birthday was getting closer, Annie and Ralph had agreed that it wouldn&#39;t be too long before Jake would need to transition over to a bottle.<br />
<br />
A pair of strong hands caught Jake around his midsection before the young male Maiasaura could manage to walk toward the large sized crib that was set up in the living room for the moment. It was set next to the chair that Annie was in and Jake could see the soft blanket move a bit as the hatchling inside moved and made the blanket move as a result. Jake&#39;s response as those hands began to lift him into the air and he could get a better view of Annie nursing May and Tyrone was to look back and see his father lifting him up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy there, champ,&quot; Ralph said to Jake and nuzzled his son with the tip of his ducklike beak.<br />
<br />
Jake calmed down a bit, but did manage to point with arm toward the younger hatchlings and managed a few soft kicks with his legs. Ralph sighed as he glanced to Annie and then moved back toward the coach and kept his arms on Jake. Neither he nor Annie had actually expected to have more children so soon after they became Maiasaura Animalians in order that Jake who was then pretty much a newborn, himself, would get all the appropriate nutrients he needed, but then they had to come to some realization that the fossil record didn&#39;t necessarily give any indication of when a Dinotopian, or any Animalian that was based on animals that modern man had had no contact with, had their breeding season. However, Ralph and Annie weren&#39;t about to reject the new hatchlings, though it was pretty clear that Jake was a bit jealous.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re your baby sisters and brother,&quot; Ralph said to Jake as he carried Jake around to a side and giving Jake a chance to get a closer look at May and Tyrone, though he was careful to make sure that Jake couldn&#39;t flail at the hatchlings, &quot;Your siblings.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huuuunnnnngggh!?&quot; Jake answered while turning his head from Ralph to Annie and then down to the two hatchlings that were presently nursing. From the angle that Ralph was holding him, he could also see Beatrix in the sort of carrying crib.<br />
<br />
He only looked down to the two for a few moments before May finished suckling and paused to actually look up to Jake. The two blinked at each other for a moment before May gave a short honk of her own, almost as if answering some of Jake&#39;s protests as the attention that Beatrix, May, and Tyrone had gotten since they hatched. Jake paused for a moment as he caught a scent on both of the new hatchlings. It was something that wasn&#39;t perfect, but in a way it smelled a bit like him in a way. It puzzled and surprised Jake in that they smelled like a mix of his parents in a way that it couldn&#39;t just be that they were close to his parents. This challenged everything that Jake knew, though at less than one year old he couldn&#39;t fully recognize that.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re your siblings, Jake,&quot; Annie managed softly and raised one hand softly rub Jake&#39;s head, &quot;and they&#39;re going to end up looking up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And both of us still love you very much,&quot; Ralph said to Jake and nuzzled him again, which actually got Jake to settle down a bit so as to enjoy Christmas with all of his family.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Other Dinotopians found themselves more involved in part of the communal Christmas feast rather than being alone with family. Ralph made one quick appearance to let everyone know that his and Annie&#39;s eggs hatched, but he was quick to return home. Andrew, however, was far more open to enjoying the public feast that Animalia provided for Christmas Day. it fit in very much the communal spirit that Animalia put into many things. Christmas, like Thanksgiving, was one of those holidays where the community did come together and share in the spirit of the season. It was there for some, even if Christmas wasn&#39;t exactly part of their culture&#39;s normal holidays.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must say that the spirit of this &quot;holiday season&quot; can be most infectious,&quot; Miko commented as looked around the great hall and noted the large decorated tree that stood in the center of the main part of the room, &quot;it is a shame that so much seems to be forgotten while others argue over other things and make mountains out of mole hills.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Gigantoraptor was quietly seated at one of the long tables with many of the other Dinotopians that were there for the communal gift giving and for the dinner that went with it. She was also there with Maho, but was also happy to meat with Andrew and Jen, as well as Courtney and Mario. It was something that provided for its fair share of cultural exchanges, given that Japan was mostly Shinto or Buddhist and the religious elements to Christmas were not as well known to them, while Mario was not as big on some of the commercial aspects that America&#39;s way celebrating Christmas.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s normally supposed to be a quiet and peaceful time of year,&quot; Andrew commented, &quot;though... normally other things are far more stable. The good thing is that there are still good people in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others did nod to that. There had often been plenty of things out there that were reported that betrayed some scheme or some issue that was something to worry about. However, there were some reports from time to time in which people did try to show some measure of kindness to one another, which was something that everyone agreed on as being a good thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention some of the other good news that&#39;s out there,&quot; Andrew then continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rex and Tyra&#39;s engagement, you mean?&quot; Mario commented while then taking a small bide from the piece of French bread in front of him.<br />
<br />
Andrew nodded. He figured that just about everyone in Lyre or Animalia had heard about it in some way or another. Tyra was happy, and with her very confident and outgoing personality, she was unafraid to tell anyone that Rex had proposed and she said yes. The memory of it at the Winter Solstice party was something that made Andrew smile, as Tyra was a good friend, and the warm feeling of Jen&#39;s tail slowly sliding over the top of his tail reminded him of some of the happiness he had.<br />
<br />
&quot;They look good, together, don&#39;t you think?&quot; Andrew asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;They look happy together,&quot; Courtney commented, &quot;and that&#39;s what matters. Mario makes me happy... and surely your bond-mates do the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bond mate,&quot; Andrew corrected, &quot;Jen... I think she&#39;s really the only woman for me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... we don&#39;t want to overshadow Tyra and Rex,&quot; Jen nodded, &quot;and I&#39;d think waiting until Dinosaur City is ready... might make for a more &quot;comfortable&quot; ceremony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do not intend to return home?&quot; Miko wondered with wide eyes as she looked over and up to Jen.<br />
<br />
Miko watched Jen smiled and nodded. To her this was a bit surprising. She had figured she would return home to Japan when she&#39;d finished her education and lessons with Rex on paleontology and biology as well as part of the position that had been worked out with the Tokyo Museum of Natural History, providing some extra hands for help and education on prehistoric life. Miko had been more than willing to do that, as it would play with the various trips she&#39;d made to the museum over the years, first with her children and then with her grandchildren. Maho had helped her with a Skype connection and her grandchildren were excited to see that she&#39;d become a Dinotopian and her children were happy to see that she was healthier than where she had been going into her conversion. <br />
<br />
But given the intense urban population in Tokyo, it was expected to be some time before she&#39;d be able to move there. As Tokyo didn&#39;t have the land available to just build a new building for even most larger Animalians based on more modern animals. Miko wasn&#39;t the largest Dinotopian, but she knew she was much bigger than she was, and it would take time Tokyo to have at least one building of sufficient size and sturdiness to accommodate her. She&#39;d figured that Jen would be in a similar situation, especially with the fact that Brachiosaurus was easily larger than Gigantoraptor.<br />
<br />
&quot;They say in this country that home is where the heart is,&quot; Mario commented, &quot;and while there will always be problems... those sorts of things should be faced and debated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And there is plenty in this country that is quite welcome,&quot; Maho commented, &quot;For... if Jen marries Andrew... Japan may be just as &quot;alien&quot; to him as America can be to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m not averse to visiting from time to time,&quot; Andrew commented and sipped his water. Miko watched as row on row of muscles in the Sauropod Dinotopian&#39;s neck then slowly moved up and down to move water down his neck and toward his stomach. &quot;I would like to meet Jen&#39;s parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miko found herself giving a small smile to them, &quot;then I am happy for you both, and may both of you have a Merry Christmas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... it will be merry,&quot; Jen smiled knowingly to Andrew, &quot;but THAT part will come later and in private.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few chuckles at that. It was also something that they raised a toast to.</p>
