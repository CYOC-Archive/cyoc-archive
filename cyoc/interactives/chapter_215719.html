<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate&#39;s parents were about 50 and their ages were starting to catch up with them. Both of your parents had a few wrinkles, were thicker in their body from being a bit less active than when they were younger, and had numerous grey hairs that outnumbered the darker shades their hair had been. So Nate figured he&#39;d go ahead and mess with the age function a little and figured he&#39;d halve his parents&#39; ages to 25.<br />
<br />
His mother&#39;s transformation was astounding as her body shed half of her lifetime. Her hair grew longer and returned to its dark black hair, her chest lifted, her shapeliness became more supple and firm, and the weight of her middle age years was shed. As for Dad, his hair darkened, muscles strengthened, and he generally got a pretty good infusion of youthful vigor. Nate&#39;s parents were shocked to see their youth returned, but after adjusting to the sight seemed to decide it was time to put their younger bodies to good use in having sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you say we take off these clothes and have some fun like we did in College?&quot; asked Dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you promise to remember what I taught you since we were this old...&quot; said Mom.<br />
<br />
While impressed with the results, Nate didn&#39;t wish to see his parents, even if they were younger and fitter, go at each other. He then decided how much of a buzzkill it would be if his Dad was younger than his Mom and he pressed the button again as the matured stud was about start trying to engage his wife to have sex and instead he regressed to about 12 and a half where his pecker was only just starting to work. Despite being married the now more youthful boy was blushing as he tried to reach for his wife&#39;s hand as his adult clothes shrank into just some shorts and a shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got younger!&quot; squeaked Dad, who grabbed his throat in shock at the boyish soprano that came out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems like one of us wasn&#39;t done getting younger, Jim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just old enough that we could--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim, I&#39;m not into little boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
A third halving and the shy boy shrank into an unabashed 6 years old who seemed to have lost any sense of social filter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got even younger! Can I sit in your lap, Ally?&quot; asked Jim eagerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jim, maybe we should get you checked out,&quot; said Mom as her shrunken husband forced his way into her lap and then wrapped his arms about her abdomen. She was at first seemingly put off until what looked like a reawakened motherly affection caused her to embrace and return the affection her youthened husband was giving.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... me want hug. Evewything big and scawwy,&quot; said Dad as his age halved again to make him a three year old toddler.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Jimmy, I&#39;ll protect you,&quot; soothed Mom as she rubbed Dad&#39;s back.<br />
<br />
He shrank again to 1 and half years old, shrinking completely into a baby that needed to be held up in the arms of his wife, and Nate was still curious how far back could he go? Press. Press. Press. At some point Dad&#39;s life went from halving months into weeks, and from weeks into days, then from days into hours, then from hours  into minutes, and then into seconds left very little for a newborn left being rocked in Mom&#39;s arms. Nate began wondering if he could push his Dad any younger as he pressed the regression button, and then the little baby being coddled by his wife regressed into his former wife&#39;s belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...&quot; Nate whispered as his hand pressed the button again accidentally as his mom&#39;s belly shrank back to normal looking size and suddenly another man appeared in the room--a man Nate recognized as his Uncle Pete--his Dad&#39;s 34 year old &quot;kid&quot; brother as Dad had always called him. Suddenly Mom looked at Uncle Pete with an apparently look of lust in her eyes and rushed over and took Uncle Pete by surprise by kissing him. At first Uncle Pete tried to push Mom off of him, especially as she now was working to strip him of his clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ally! What are you doing?!&quot; exclaimed Uncle Pete when he finally could break the kissing as she pulled his shirt off to reveal a thick chest that had muscle coated with just a tiny bit of fat over it from a poorer diet.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t explain it, but if you don&#39;t fuck me right now, I feel like I&#39;m going to burst! Help me now... I&#39;ll try to explain things... later,&quot; explained Mom before going right back into making out with Uncle Pete, who with a bit of reluctance followed through on her demands and desires. Nate spun around in his chair and stopped his ears and closed his eyes and started making nonsense sounds to drown out the noises and visuals from his mind, though he&#39;d started to see enough that his imagination wouldn&#39;t drop the subject easily. It wasn&#39;t until a few minutes later that Nate pulled his hands off his ears and tentatively turned around to find his Mom and Uncle in post-coital bliss. The remote had statistics on 3 individuals: Mom, Uncle Pete, and Dad. Though it listed Dad&#39;s status as (preconception).<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap... I just unconceived Dad,&quot; said Nate. Well, that was one way to get an answer to a question.</p>
