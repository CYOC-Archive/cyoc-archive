<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The girls woke up the next day each in their respective bedrooms and were allowed downstairs for breakfast. None of them appeared to have changed yet but they each knew it was only a matter of time.<br />
At the table the girls were each made to sit down in a special place as each meal was catered towards their transformation.<br />
Kim was given a standard breakfast of cereal and toast. Jane was given a huge breakfast consisting of pancakes, bacon, eggs and toast. Jenni however was given a bowl of cereal and a glass of milk, that itself wasn&#39;t strange but how it was presented was. The bowl was a pink hello kitty bowl and the glass and spoon had a similar design, the meal was for a child not a girl of seventeen.<br />
Only Kim appeared to be eating, as neither Jane or Jenni wanted to.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll Just make your transformation worse if you don&#39;t eat up, okay girls&quot; was all Agatha said to them. Immediately the girls started to eat and were finished in five minutes. Agatha told them to go and get changed as they were going out for a picnic in the park. Each of them went to their bedrooms to get changed, what met them was a bit of a shock however.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kim&#39;s wardrobe was full of nerdy clothes, t-shirts and baseball tees with cartoons and printed pictures on them. She also had many hooded sweaters and thick jumpers to match. There were however pants and skirts that she would normally wear and a pair of blue sneakers that looked a lot like her own. Before she put anything on Kim checked her underwear draw, inside were ust plain bras and panties like she would normally wear. She put on a bra and a pair of panties and then proceeded to put some clothes on. She chose a black t-shirt with an anime character on it that she didn&#39;t hate, a blue knitted sweater and a black skirt. Kim then went downstairs and got in the car, waiting for Jenni and Jane.<br />
<br />
Jane opened her wardrobe to look for some clothes, however what met her she wasn&#39;t expecting. All of the clothes were huge. She went into the underwear draw to look for a bra and panties. Again everything was huge, she pulled out a lace bra and checked the label. 34D. She tried it on and found it fit her, not perfectly but still quite well. She was curious now and tried on some other clothes. In the end she was wearing a pair of fishnet stockings and a pair of lace panties. She was also wearing a blue dress and a red belt over her waist. She also went downstairs and into the car to find Kim, she looked almost exactly the same thought Jane.<br />
<br />
Jenni was the last to come downstairs as she was too embarrassed about her body.<br />
When she went to get changed she went into her underwear draw and found only training bras and plain panties, she checked the label on them and found they were for 12 year old girls.she realised that the floor looked closer now then she noticed that the only clothes she was wearing were a pair of panties with a childish design on them. She looked in the mirror and saw a girl that looked about nine staring back at her. That could not be right she thought, she was seventeen. This must be a sick dream. She went downstairs to find Agatha  in the kitchen.<br />
 &quot;What happened to me&quot; She yelled. Agatha turned around smiling and said<br />
<br />
 &quot;I said this would be your punishment sweetie?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;I look like a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Well of course you do, your my little Jenni.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Jenni was really starting to freak out now, &quot;how is this even possible <br />
 &quot;I have my ways.&quot; Replied Agatha &quot; I did this because you are one of the mist despiteful girls I have ever met and i decided to give you another mother, Me.&quot;<br />
 &quot;Bu..&quot;<br />
 &quot;But nothing, you are to call me mom from now on, if you don&#39;t call me mom then I will have to give you a spanking, young lady. I can only make you younger, the only way to reverse my effects is to grow up.&quot;She half lied &quot;I didn&#39;t know how young I wanted my new daughter, so I am going to leave that up to you. If you behave yourself and accept and act your age then you will get to stay that age and grow up as my daughter from there, But if you act out or don&#39;t do as your told, then I will make you younger.&quot;<br />
 &quot;How could you do this Agatha?&quot; Jenni asked feeling angry.<br />
 Without any hesitation agatha grabbed Jenni by the neck and sat down on a chair from the table and bent her over her knee. She pulled down her kid undies and spanked her butt. Jenni cried out in pain as she started saying while spanking her &quot;I did this because I love you and want you to have a new life with a new family that loves you. you were going down a bad path and this will give you a chance to do it all over again.&quot;<br />
 She gave Jenni&#39;s butt a good 15 whacks and pulled up her underwear. She took her by the hand saying &quot;Come on, lets get you some clothes.&quot; <br />
 Agatha  brought Jenni  upstairs to her room agatha went to the dresser and took out a pair of denim shorts and a short sleeve shirt with the hello kitty logo on it. She handed jenni the clothes and told her to put them on and get in the car.<br />
<br />
When all three girls were in the car they drove to the park and got out of the car. They went into the picnic area and Kim and Jane helped put out all the picnic stuff Agatha had brought with her. They all sat down yet Agatha told them too each run off and play. Kim and Jane went over to a picnic table nearby yet Jenni stayed sat down.<br />
Agatha told Jenni  that she better start acting like a kid and play with the group of kids in the playground, So she did. Jenni played some games with the group of kids for about 2 hours. then agatha called him all the girls over and gave them  each their lunch. Jenni and Kim both had a ham and cheese sandwich but Jane was given two and a bag of chips.<br />
 jenni felt like she had to go pee badly after she was done eating. Well she had to go when he was playing but she kind of got caught up in the game of tag she was having.<br />
<br />
&quot;aga; mom I need to go to the bathroom.&quot;<br />
 &quot;You&#39;ll have to wait for Jane and kim to get back&quot;<br />
 &quot;Cant I go by myself?&quot;<br />
 &quot;Honey you&#39;re far to young. You&#39;ll have to wait.&quot;<br />
 Jenni couldn&#39;t hold it any longer and just let go wetting his pants. Agatha immediately noticed and said that she didn&#39;t bring her a change of clothes so they would go home.<br />
 When they got home Agatha went upstairs telling sam to wait in the kitchen for her. When she got back she had a towel with her and she unbuttoned Jenni&#39;s pants and pulled them down in the middle of the kitchen. She told her that as punishment for wetting her pants that she would have to wear his pee stained underwear for the rest of the afternoon. She had her sit on the couch in just her undies on top of a towel. She didn&#39;t want her ruining her couch. She sat for hours watching TV in just her kid undies. When it was time for bed Agatha took her upstairs and told her to lie on the bed whilst she got her some pyjamas. when she was done she went over to the dresser and took out a pair of goodnite bed wetting pants. They looked like underwear, but much thicker and made out of a cloth like material. she had her stand up as she slipped her legs into them and pulled them firmly up to her waist. She kissed her on the forehead as she tucked her in and said &quot;Goodnight, little one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agatha went into Kim&#39;s bedroom to find her typing away at a computer, she then went into Jane&#39;s room to find her snacking on a box of cookies. Agatha smiled to herself, slowly her three girls were adapting.</p>
