<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Mark in the lead the three satyrs quickly into the frat houses back yard. The street in front of the house was absolutely packed so to avoid attention Mark took the three through a back gate that to some of the campus sports fields. <br />
<br />
Even if they weren&#39;t associated with TFU most students were out partying. So Mark figured they&#39;d run the least risk of anyone seeing the three satyrs. Plus cutting through the fields would take them in the direction of the Second Skin to figure out what was going on with his costume and it&#39;s highly infectious nature. <br />
<br />
Though the task of heading back to the shop was getting more and more difficult by the second. Because of the changes the three had endured all of their senses were greatly heightened and running wild. Their goat ears would automatically twitch towards sounds they found of interest, their enhanced noses would lead them to plant their faces clumps of fragrant grass or flowers. <br />
<br />
Not to mention the scents of the three satyrs. All the running around and the their earlier romp in the pantry had left the three decently sweaty. Each exuded a rather enticing aroma. Likely because he was the most transformed, Peter seemed to be the most susceptible to it. Mark and Travis would find his muzzle taking deep whiffs against their skin whenever they paused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baah! Bah Baah!&quot; Peter would bleat out as he took the scent in. It was clear Peter was ready and wanting to go another round. Even if Mark and Travis&#39;s goat ears didn&#39;t understand the strange language of Peter&#39;s bleats it was clear how horny he was. In truth the other two were as well,  but Mark was thankfully able to keep the trio heading along the path to the Second Skin with no encounters. They had one final soccer field to cross and a fence to hop, which considering their new legs should be easy enough, and then they would be only a few blocks away. <br />
<br />
The trio stopped near one of the lights as they prepared to cross the final field, suddenly a soccer ball flew out of the air and hit Mark in the head. The ball would have probably hurt anyone else, but it instead bounced harmlessly of his horns. Mark and the other two satyrs looked to see where the ball game from. Running towards them was a sweaty student in warmer fall soccer gear, minus the shin guards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry!&quot; he yelled as he approached. &quot;Kinda lost control of that one. Are you okay?&quot;  The student stopped suddenly with a look of surprise as he now got a good view of the three goat men. The three were quite the strange sight, especially Peter    .  <br />
<br />
&quot;Costume party!&quot; Mark blurted out of nervousness. &quot;We were at a frat costume party!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I see,&quot; replied the student. I think I had a friend who went to that. Not really my thing though.&quot; As they entered the light the satyrs were huddled near, the student came into full view. He stood around 6&#39; was lean and athletic with short, thick dark hair and light skin. Your eyes drifted to his particularly muscular legs. Though he was wearing long socks Mark could see some thick brown hairs curling over the top of the socks. &quot;You guys kinda scared me your costumes are pretty real looking.&quot; The student said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we&#39;ve been getting that a lot,&quot; replied Mark as he tried to play off the trios appearance. Mark&#39;s satyr senses were making that increasingly difficult however.  <br />
<br />
Clearly this student had been out practicing awhile because his hair was mussed with sweat. While he didn&#39;t give off the same pungent odor of the satyrs it was a still a nice smell that Mark found very enticing. Combined with his physical appearance Mark was having trouble keeping his mind on getting to Second Skin.  As he was trying to send the student on his way to remove the distraction Mark noticed something troubling.<br />
<br />
Clearly the other satyrs found this scent equally enticing because whether by instinct or design Peter and Travis moved to flank the soccer student. Because the student&#39;s eyes were focused on Marc he didn&#39;t see that the two satyrs behind him were completely erect. Their hands were busily coaxing out their members. Travis&#39;s was already dribbling across his hand. He did say back at the frat he wanted to go again on the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;d you get it?&quot; asked the student. &quot;I&#39;m not super into Halloween, but with a costume like that I might learn to be.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? you want a costume like ours?&quot; said Travis. Turns out it&#39;s not that hard to get one. I can show you if you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh did you make them or something?&quot; asked the student as he turned to face Travis. A prepared Travis rapidly took some of the cum on his hand and shoved it into the unsuspecting student&#39;s mouth. He stepped back coughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or something,&quot; replied a grinning Travis.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell man!&quot; yelled the student after he recovered. &quot;What was that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You wanted to try a costume right?&quot; replied a smiling Travis. &quot;Better get ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
As if light headed, the soccer player took a few wobbly steps back.<br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t good, Mark thought to himself. He really should have stopped Travis, but he also knew there was a part of him that wanted this too. Already he could see the already thick hair on the soccer student&#39;s legs getting thicker.  He saw two small nubs of horns quickly appear out of his thick brown hair. Of course most noticeable was the outline of his eager and rock hard member pressing against his soccer shorts. <br />
<br />
This time Travis really seemed to be taking the initiative. He stepped forward and pulled the soccer student into him. Sticking his hands into his shorts and grabbing firm hold of his member and stroking it. The soccer player let out a lustful &quot;Baah!&quot; and some light bleats as he quickly started to cum a little. It was clear the soccer player was now fully entranced in the satyr libido like the others. <br />
<br />
In a scene reminiscent of the pantry at the house, Travis shoved the player&#39;s head down to his waiting cock. He accepted it eagerly as Peter found his way to the players eager ass. <br />
<br />
Before, Mark had lied about taking a video as he searched for second skin, but now he was actually taking one. This entire night was strange enough Mark wasn&#39;t sure it was real and felt like he needed something to verify the reality of it. So with one hand he held the phone up to take video as Travis and Peter spit roasted the soccer player who was piece by piece becoming less human, and with the other he furiously rubbed one out as he watched. He found it particularly hot watching the Soccer players muscular legs shift into those of goat. The player had lost his shoes during the rumpus. His socks kept stretching and stretching around the newly forming caprine legs until a pair of cloven hooves eventually tore them exposing thick brown fur covered legs. Unable to film any longer, Mark threw the phone aside and jumped into the fray. <br />
<br />
At the end of it all four satyrs were laid out on the cool grass of the field. <br />
<br />
&quot;Baah? Bah?&quot; Peter suddenly bleated up. He was still the only one to have no facility with human speech.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name bah?&quot; replied the soccer player. &quot;We never did actually get to those did we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The satyr thing kind of gets in the way,&quot; replied Travis.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I&#39;ve now experienced.&quot; Replied the player. &quot;The name is Gabe by the way. Nice to meet you all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Travis and Peter. I&#39;m Mark.&quot; he said gesturing towards the other two. &quot;We were trying to get back to the shop that caused all this when we ran into you. Considering what happened, you should probably come with us.&quot;</p>
