<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Wait, what is that on your forefoot? Did you pick it up boy?&quot; Jennifer asked, having spotted the watch still on his wrist. She took it before Tim even had time to react.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-woof! Bark woof! (Wait, Jen, I think that thing changed me!)&quot; He tried to call out to no avail as only his voice badly imitating a dog&#39;s scare out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked the watch over, ignoring Tim. She found odd buttons and decided to hold one down.<br />
<br />
In an instant, Tim suddenly found himself standing on two legs once more. There was no flash of light or strange sound, he was just standing right there in his kitchen. His train of thought trying to grasp what had happened was torn yet again as a tug in his arm quickly grabbed his attention. He looked down and his jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the floor, completely naked was his wife Jennifer. She was staring up at him with her tongue hanging out of her mouth. Her curly red hair was now straightened, but HEAVILY overgrown. The top of her head was cut in such a way that on either side of her head, the hair almost looked like floppy dog ears. Her body was covered in little patches of red body hair, and her pussy was almost just visible through the massive amount of pubic hair which sprung out like a bush.<br />
<br />
Her boobs hung without support of her chest, bouncing slightly every time she panted. Her fat as was sitting on the floor, her now hairy legs scrunched up to her shoulders with her hands on the floor as if she was a dog sitting for her master. Although she was nude, there was a collar around her neck, one that read &quot;Rex&quot; in bright red letters.<br />
<br />
&quot;J-Jennifer?&quot; He asked nervously. <br />
<br />
Jennifer continued to pant, seemingly unconcerned with Tim&#39;s obvious confusion.<br />
<br />
Tim reached out, almost to check if what he was seeing was in fact an illusion, but that&#39;s when he noticed his hand. It was still his large, manly looking hand, but not only was it devoid of hair, but at the ends of each finger were long, blue painted nails. He was even wearing Jennifer&#39;s gold bracelet and HER wedding ring.<br />
<br />
Tim looked down and gasped yet again. He was still himself, but dressed exactly like his wife. He was wearing her tight yoga pants which helped demonstrate he was still a man with his large bulge, had on a bright purple tank top, and her dark sneakers. Worse yet, he could feel a bra was clasped around his chest, and could feel the thighs grasp of panties around his waist.<br />
<br />
He waisted no time in running to the fridge, where they hung a small mirror for last minute checks before walking out. Staring back at him was still himself, but almost as if he was dressed up as Jennifer for a halloween party. His face was coated in a modest amount of makeup, he had his ears pierced with earrings dangling from them, and he even had his body full shaved below his eyes. Only his head still had hair, but his normally straight brown hair was now extremely long, extremely curly, and tied up in a messy  bun on his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell.&quot; He muttered, completely baffled by what he was seeing. <br />
<br />
He glanced over and spotted a family photo, and in it he saw what he least wanted to see. His kids were all fine and smiling at the beach they had visited last year, but where his wife had previously stood he was standing. He was dressed in nothing but a bikini, showing off his clearly hairless body. He brown hair was a curly wet mess, and he was laughing as he was lifted up by... Rex.<br />
<br />
There, in the photo, was their dog Rex, somehow standing on two legs, wearing swim trunks, and lifting up Tim in the photo. Although not visible fully, the fat ass of Jennifer could be seen blearily running out fo the photo&#39;s frame. Tim remembered that when they took the picture, Rex had run after seeing a cat, but now apparently it was Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god.&quot; Tim muttered.<br />
<br />
He turned around to see Jennifer now laying down, knowing mindlessly on the leash that Tim had dropped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rex?&quot; Tim asked. <br />
<br />
Jennifer tilted her head up, let her tongue hang out and barked. She began to shake her ass, gesturing at the door hoping for a walk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit, does this thing swap bodies? No... no that wouldn&#39;t make sense then either I&#39;d have Jennifer&#39;s body now or I&#39;d still be at work with hers. Oh my god, it swaps life roles. I&#39;m still me.... but, but everyone things I&#39;m Jennifer don&#39;t they?&quot; He rhetorically asked a confused Jennifer.<br />
<br />
DING DONG.<br />
<br />
Tim nearly fell to the floor, as the door bell&#39;s alert nearly scared him half to death. He didn&#39;t want to open it, but given everything he had to make sure his suspicions were confirmed. He opened the door and found Shaniqua standing there. She was a college aged kid who was quite the good student.<br />
<br />
She was a bit dorky, with large glasses sweater vests and her curly dark hair that was always in a messy fro, but was very sweet. She was half black on her dad&#39;s side and half hispanic on her mother&#39;s. Though they had a rocky relationship, it inspired her to work hard and always help them if she could. That&#39;s part of why Tim hired her, since he knew she&#39;d do her best.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hi Mrs. Johnson.&quot; She greeted warmly. &quot;I thought you said you were going out?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, she really thinks I&#39;m Jennifer.&quot; He thought. &quot;No, focus Tim... just, play it off.&quot; He thought quickly. He also believed Jennifer was going to go out with her friend Lynda, so he also had no idea what she was doing home getting ready to walk Rex, but it didn&#39;t matter. He decided then and there to just make up whatever came to mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, ha! Yes I was but... I decided I wanted to walk Rex quickly before I went.&quot; He lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hi Rexy!&quot; Shaniqua laughed, petting Jennifer&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
Jennifer barked cheerily then turned around. Tim cringed as he watched Shaniqua scratch Jennifer&#39;s ass. Rex always loved a good but rub, but it was VERY weird seeing Jennifer do it.<br />
&quot;Uh, anyway, T-Tim Jr. is upstairs.&quot; He forced a laugh. &quot;So I&#39;ll leave him and Rex here to you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Tim Jr.? Ha, you sound like Mr. Johnson! Don&#39;t you always call him Timmy?&quot; Shaniqua chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yes that I do... it&#39;s just, you know...&quot; Tim started to panic. What if Shaniqua found out? There was no way right? He was too filled with emotions to think properly, so he did the only thing he could think of.<br />
<br />
&quot;He just rubs off on me what can I say!&quot; He chuckled, grabbing the leash around Jennifer&#39;s neck. &quot;Well anyway I&#39;ll give Rex here a quick walk then I&#39;ll leave him with you. Watch Timmy for me okay bye!&quot; He rushed out the door, barely giving Shaniqua a chance to ask anything else.<br />
<br />
As Tim walked, he pondered everything. Why was this happening to him? Why was he in his wife&#39;s life? Why had he been in Rex&#39;s life previously, and why the hell was his wife in there now? He looked down and watched with a wince as his wife happily crawled on the sidewalk. He ass proudly up in the air, her hair pussy out for the world to see but neither she nor the world seemed to care.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay think Tim.&quot; He muttered to himself. &quot;Put it together. There has to be a reason this happened today. So, what&#39;s different about today than yesterday.... oh shit.&quot; He thought, suddenly realizing the one item that seemed to coincide with the role swaps. &quot;The watch!&quot; He realized.</p>

Wait, where was the watch again?</h3>
