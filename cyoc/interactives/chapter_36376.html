<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You stretch your freshly grown muscles, and head to the mountain, kicking down trees that block your path. You may be slower than you were before, but you can take long strides. A noise sounds from near your foot, and you look down. It's another soldier, wearing body armour. You causally flick him onto his back with your godzilla-scale foot, inhale, and exhale a ball of air the size of a small car. It hits the man face on, and for a moment his belly absorbs it. Then, his incredibly round and bloated stomach goes down again in rapid contractions as the air diverts to his muscles. First his shoes burst off to reveal webbed feet, then his legs burst outwards, but not tearing the black armour, which holds on, creaking and groaning. His hands fatten outwards, becoming swollen and meaty, tearing his gloves. His biceps then puff outwards with incredible speed under his armour. Then, with chest explodes outwards, pectorals actually denting the metal outwards, and his head pops into a new shape, a sharks. He stands up with a groan, clasping his bulk as if trying to force it back into his body. He bends over, and a fin rips out of his back. With a strange cry, he rips off the now suffocating armour to reveal his chest, powerful muscles bulging beneath his shiny black skin, the shielding on his arms tearing off too, allowing his massive biceps to force their way out to full size. He bends over, moaning, and the force of his rear and leg muscles tensing rips the remaining armour off. He sinks to the floor, exhausted. Impressed with your even greater powers, you continue.<br />
The rest of the journey to the mountain proves uneventful. You find a squad of guards scurrying about at the base of the mountain. With a booming laugh you pick them up in your massive, swollen fist, and stuff them between your pecs and tense. You hear a crunch, and flick their remains out of the abyss between your muscles with a massive claw. Then, with a surge of power, you crouch down and actually leap five miles into the air, coming down with a thud on the mountains flat peak, shaking the ground. The man is standing there (thankfully in a new grey suit), seeming to have recovered his calm. He turns around slowly. &quot;Oh, it's you. I see you have progressed to a Type Two. Not to mention swallowed about half the lake those research dumbasses left for testing&quot;. &quot;All of it, actually&quot; you exclaim to him in a voice louder than a explosion. &quot;And what to you mean, &quot;Type Two&quot;?&quot;. &quot;You don't know?&quot; he yells back up at you. &quot;Well, you've come this far. I guess I should explain.&quot; Sitting down on a rock formation, he begins.<br />
&quot;I began as a, well, what you may call goblin, named &quot;Xez&quot;&quot; he explained. &quot;Back in prehistoric times, I always found it hilarious to turn one of you humans into a half-animal, overmuscled freak, and either leave them to desperately try and move your bulk, or degenerate their minds and attack your settlements with them. But now in these modern times, it's hard to do that without people noticing, for example, do you realize how hard it is to fit a gorilla mutant the size of a lorry out a front door. Damn, I remember when this police officer got a banana and-&quot;. He  pauses. &quot;Sorry, a bit off topic there. Anyway, to get to the point, one of your &quot;scientists&quot; offered me test subjects, for a fee. They needed me to incubate a special &quot;muscle gas&quot; for them. For super-soldiers of whatever, they didn't tell me. So they set up a police cordon outside the park when you were in, and let me use my powers on you. Those hunters, they were sent to inflate you to immobility and take you to study as well. But obviously, they failed. Also, you remarked on a Type 2. We get that sometimes, the animal half reacting well to environments and dominating further. But anyway, the mutations are gas based, and this means-&quot;. While you are still standing, listening intently, he moves lightning fast, picks up a rock shard and pierces your leg with it. You roar with anger, but it is no good, you can see your muscles deflating, the gas hissing from your leg. By the time your wound his healed, you are back to your sun-affected, or &quot;Type 2&quot; size. With a bellow, you run towards Xez, and wrap one chunky finger round his neck and squeeze. Choking, he gasps out &quot;Fool! Do you not think I have powers of my own!&quot;. And with that, his chest bulks up with a hissing sound, the gaps between each muscle becoming like valleys. His weight becomes to much for you, and you drop him. His suit rips down the middle and a muscular, grey, rough-skinned chest presses it's way out. His shoes tear open to reveal rapidly expanding rhino feet, his legs becoming fat, thick and chunky, a line of tears snaking it's way up the stitching, before they finally rip off. He laughs manically as his biceps and hands bloat up, and his spine creaks as he grows, becoming 12 metres tall. Suddenly, he stops there, unlike you, and be comes wider and wider, the length of a train carriage across. Still laughing, he steps back- and one clumsy foot shatters a red jar on the ground. Electricity spreads from it, all the way to his head, just as it pushes out into a rhino head. &quot;NO!&quot; he cries, stooping over and clutching his skull. You see a horn push out between his fingers, and he cries out again. But something is wrong, the call becoming more and more of a grunt every time. finally he straightens up and looks at you. There is no intelligence in those eyes, just animal-like rage. Then with a bestial roar he slams his fist out at you.<br />
You duck just in time, the blow just missing your hulking back. His fist hits a the floor and he grabs it, roaring in pain, and you take this opportunity to jog as fast as your massive bulk and weight allow between his legs. As you thought, he is not hunched over like you. He tries again and again to push his head over his hot-air-balloon sized pectorals, but to no avail. You run out, and exerting all of your reptilian strength, you rip out a chunk of the mountain and hurl it at him, but it simply bounces off his chunky abs. He reaches out for you and you flatten yourself on the floor. His clumsy, car-sized fingers try to snatch you, but their swollen size means that his fingers only snatch empty air, not able to pick you up because you are hiding on the level of his massive fingertips. He gives up, and you straighten up again, noting your bulging chest muscles have left a outline on the ground. You ready yourself to hurl another boulder, but with a murderous roar he charges at you, either to spear you on his rhino horn or smash you of the cliff with his bloated chest. A plan forms in your head, and you leap to the side of his path, and then... stick your foot out. His swollen foot hits your tree-trunk sized leg, and you see his top-heavy body teeter, stumble and finally fall! Looking down, you see his hulking body tumbling down, smashing against the sides of the mountain. No way he survived that. Taking a final sad glance down, you look back at whatever he stepped on, and notice it fell from (presumably) his case. You open it, and find a pair of black underwear, made of some strange elastic material, and probably your size. A number on the inside means it's probably for the test subjects. You slip them on. They strain a bit as you wriggle them past your bulky thighs, but eventually you get them on, and rip a hole in them for your tail. Your genitalia may well have a sheath now, but you want to look good when you return to civilization...civilization! You wonder what people will think about your new powers and your hulking, reptilian body. You probably won't have much to fear from that super-soldier project, you reckon they have enough over-muscled, mutated soldiers to keep them going. You stick your meaty, clawed hands into the case again and find it's last content- a red jar, like the one that affected Xez. You gaze at it warily, then press a button on it, and it extends into a somewhat familiar looking syringe with a picture of a apple on it. Suddenly, your mutant side whispers to you again, and you jam it into one of your cable-sized veins. You feel a surge of power, and decide to find some guards to test it on. With a grin, you plant the back of your foot into the side of the mountain, and grind down.<br />
The trip down is far more exhilarating then going up, and soon you are in the forest. Suddenly, you hear a groaning noise and see the over muscled shark-guard, flapping about on the ground. You feel sorry for him, and suck some air out of him, reducing him to slightly heavier than your weight, and pick him up. Suddenly, you feel a tingle from the vein you injected the needle into, and without wanting to you raise a arm and fire a red ball at him. &quot;No, what are you, I-I-can't w-w-hat..aaargh..GRAAAGH&quot; the guard cries out. He seems to be drained of intelligence like Xez, just a simple brute. But suddenly he walks up to you, growling and breathing heavily. He seems to be waiting. With a surge of delight, you command him to kneel. He complies. He is apparently under your control. But you still feel sorry for him. You give him a new order. &quot;You are now free of my power. You can have this island, but you may never leave.&quot;. With that, his intelligence returns, although still with the orders. He shakily thanks you and lumbers away to enjoy his new powers.<br />
Soon, you are back in the aircraft, hometown selected, and you are flying back. You grin, imagining what you could do being a muscular, mind-controlling, lizardlike mutant, and sink into a happy sleep as the jet flies off into the sunset.<br />
THE END<br />
Hope you enjoyed being a bulked-up lizard-mutant! This is just where I leave the story, (I may add new branches sometime, and of course, you can too), you can freely add on from here.</p>
