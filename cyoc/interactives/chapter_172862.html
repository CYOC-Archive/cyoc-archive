<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Valerie would have been having a great day, if she hadn&#39;t been stuck with her little sister, Sammy (short for Samantha).  She&#39;d been waiting all week to go to the shopping center with her friends, and at the last minute, Mom was like &quot;Oh honey, could you bring Sammy with you, I have some errands I need to run today.&quot;<br />
<br />
So now Val was stuck babysitting the munchkin.  They&#39;d been window shopping, and Sammy pointed at a mannequin wearing a minidress.  &quot;Oh that looks nice, doesn&#39;t it, Sis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe on me it would, but not on a baby like you.&quot;  Val snickered, as Sammy&#39;s face fell.  Puberty had been gracious to Val.  Even though she wasn&#39;t quite 14 yet, she already had a great figure and decent-sized breasts.  She&#39;d been starting to get a lot of attention from even the older boys, and was the envy of all her friends.<br />
<br />
Sammy pouted.  She was nine, and small for her age.  She and her sister used to be the best of friends, but ever since Val started to fill out in the 8th grade, she seemed to have no time or patience for her.  She&#39;d call her names, and constantly make fun of her for being a &#39;flat-chested little girl&#39;.  Well she was supposed to be that way, it wasn&#39;t her fault!  Mom said it was a phase Val would grow out of- Sammy hoped that would happen soon.<br />
<br />
&#39;I don&#39;t even get what the big deal is.  So boys like you now?  Big deal.&#39;  But she didn&#39;t say any of those things, Sammy was a very sweet girl, unlike her big sister who could be a little bratty at times.  Like now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was saying you&#39;d look good in the dress, you didn&#39;t have to be mean to me.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Val shook her head.  &quot;Whatever, jeez, don&#39;t cry about it.  You&#39;re such a baby sometimes.  Come on, let&#39;s get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then time seemed to slow down to a crawl.  Both girls couldn&#39;t move, as an unseen wind whipped around their bodies.  Valerie&#39;s hips narrowed, her butt seemed to shrink, and her breasts dwindled to mere buds, as if she was going through puberty in reverse.  Her shirt hung loose on her body, and her jeans slid off her girlish hips.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Samantha felt very strange as her hips widened, and her shirt was pushed out by a growing pair of breasts.  Then the moment passed, and Val swore as she tried to hold up her jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...what&#39;s happened to me?&quot;  Val yelped.<br />
<br />
Sammy&#39;s clothes no longer seemed to fit right.  Her shirt had been pulled upwards, revealing her belly button, even as if felt very tight around her chest.  Her skirt was stretched across her hips, as she now had the figure of a blossoming young lady, despite still being a girl of nine.  &quot;This feels weird!&quot;<br />
<br />
Val turned to look at her her sister and gasped.  &quot;Sammy, you got boobs!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy frowned.  &quot;I wish they&#39;d go away!  I don&#39;t like them at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t an isolated incident, Val noticed.  There were several people who seemed to have been transformed in various ways- a girl who seemed to be half deer bounded past her, being chased by a female security guard.  &quot;Come on, Sammy, we better go to the bathroom.&quot;  She took Sammy&#39;s hand and led her to a nearby restroom.<br />
<br />
Looking at themselves in the mirror, the girls could really grasp the changes.  Val pulled off her shirt, and felt tears sting her eyes as she saw how flat she was.  &quot;No...&quot;  She wanted to die!  The other kids at school would laugh at her!<br />
<br />
Sammy had mimicked her big sister, and was now cupping her breasts, her mouth forming an &#39;O&#39; of surprise.  They were heavier than she&#39;d expected, and it felt nice to touch them.  Then she saw how upset Val was.  In a way, she supposed Valerie was being punished for the way she&#39;d been acting- but this was too cruel.<br />
<br />
She hugged her sister.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Val.&quot;<br />
<br />
Valerie felt her little sister&#39;s breasts pressing against her side.  As if her problems weren&#39;t bad enough, how was she going to explain this to Mom?  She&#39;d been responsible for Sammy, and this had happened!  She imagined the way her little sister would be treated by the other kids her age, let alone the adults.  If this was going to be bad for her, it would be worse for Sammy.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, as she got older and continued to grow, Val could imagine people calling her little sister a slut and worse.  It made her angry to think about.  &quot;Sammy.  I&#39;m sorry for the way I&#39;ve been treating you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I forgive you.  But what are we going to do?&quot;  She looked up at Val.<br />
<br />
Val shrugged.  &quot;Call Mom and have her pick us up.  She&#39;ll freak, but..there&#39;s nothing we can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bathroom door opened, and Val quickly helped Sammy get her shirt back on.  As embarrassing as it would be to get caught topless, it would be worse for Sammy, with her precocious breasts. <br />
<br />
A beautiful girl with long chestnut hair entered.  She looked amazing, with large breasts and wide hips (though her waistline was a bit too thick), along with a tight tummy and well toned muscles.  The girl sighed, looking at the two of them.  &quot;You know, it was funny at first, but I totally ruined your lives, didn&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  Val held her shirt up over her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the one who did this to you, and I&#39;m sorry.  I&#39;ll fix it.&quot;  The girl said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you do this?&quot;  Sammy asked.<br />
<br />
The girl held up a gold ring on her finger.  &quot;This ring grants wishes.  I got carried away.  But like I said, I&#39;ll fix it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wishes?  Really?&quot;  Val&#39;s eyes got big.  She probably shouldn&#39;t be so willing to believe the girl, but at this point, what did she have to lose?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good, I don&#39;t want to have big boobs anymore.  Give them back to Val, so she can be popular again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Valerie frowned.  She realized now that she&#39;d been a bitch to her sister.  &quot;I don&#39;t know if I deserve them.  I&#39;ve been a real brat to you, Sis.  I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy smiled happily.  &quot;It&#39;s ok, Mom said it was a phase or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, we used to be friends, and then what, I grow up a little, and everything changes.  Hey, what are the rules for that ring anyways?&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl shrugged. &quot;There don&#39;t seem to be any, why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...could you change us, but make it so everyone think it&#39;s normal?&quot;  Val had a thought.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sure, that&#39;s easy enough.  What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready to grow up just yet.  I was thinking, maybe you could make me Sammy&#39;s age again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy gasped.  &quot;Oh wow, really?  Wouldn&#39;t we be twins then?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess we would.&quot;  Val smiled at her sister.  &quot;So yeah, make us twin sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we look alike?  That would be so cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
Val considered that.  Sammy was a very pretty girl.  &#39;I could do a lot worse than be her twin.&#39;  &quot;Yeah, make me Sammy&#39;s identical twin.&quot;<br />
<br />
The long haired girl nodded.  &quot;Ok, I can do that, and make everyone think you&#39;ve always been twins.  Though it would be strange for you to be at the shopping center by yourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Val shrugged.  &quot;So send us home, that&#39;s fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um.&quot;  Sammy seemed thoughtful.  &quot;I&#39;m not in any hurry to grow up either.  Could you make us younger?&quot;<br />
<br />
Val blinked.  &quot;Really?  I don&#39;t want to be too little...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Think of how much fun we&#39;re going to have!&quot;  Sammy&#39;s smile was infectious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, ok, how young are we talking?&quot;&quot;  Teri, the long haired girl ran her fingers through her extra long mane of hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, um, how about seven?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Seven?  Oh man, we&#39;re going to be babies..&quot;  Val was starting to have second thoughts, then Sammy reached up to squeeze her hand.  &quot;Oh fine, do it before I change my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, here goes.  I wish you...&quot;  Teri gestured to Val.  &quot;Were her twin sister, and you were both seven years old.  Everyone but the three of us will believe you&#39;ve always been twins.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both girls shrank in height, though Val did so much faster, so that they soon were both adorable little girls.  They were now both wearing scaled down versions of Sammy&#39;s dress.  Sammy squealed and hugged her twin.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then I wish you were both at home, safe and sound.&quot;  Teri waved good bye, and the girls vanished.<br />
<br />
And then...</p>
