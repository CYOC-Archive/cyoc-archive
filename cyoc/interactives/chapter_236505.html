<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Luke sat back on the bench, his large dad body filling the space with ease, a mischievous grin crept across his face. He patted his expansive belly and motioned for Kenny to sit in his lap.<br />
<br />
“Come on, Kenny,” Luke said, his deep voice now carrying a strange, almost magical warmth. “Why don’t you take a seat? I’ve been feeling… different lately. Some kind of strange side effect of that alien transformation remote. I feel all bloated. It&#39;s like I’m filling up with this magic dad gas, and it’s about to come out. Trust me, you’re going to want to be here when it does.”<br />
<br />
Kenny hesitated for a moment, sensing something off about Luke’s tone, but he couldn’t resist the pull. There was something about the way Luke spoke, the way his new dad body radiated this bizarre aura of authority and power, that made Kenny feel almost spellbound. Against his better judgment, he moved forward and sat in Luke’s lap.<br />
<br />
Immediately, Kenny felt the warmth of Luke’s heavy, husky frame beneath him. It was like sitting on a firm yet comforting cushion. Luke wrapped a thick arm around Kenny’s shoulder, holding him in place, his massive hand resting heavily on Kenny’s chest.<br />
<br />
Luke chuckled softly, the sound vibrating through his big belly. “You ready, Kenny? I can feel it building. It’s like I’ve got this magic dad energy inside me, and once I let it out… well, you’ll see.”<br />
<br />
Kenny tried to stand, but it was like his body didn’t want to move. He felt rooted to the spot, as if Luke’s presence alone was holding him there. His heart began to race as Luke leaned in closer, his breath warm against Kenny’s neck.<br />
<br />
Then it happened. Luke’s belly rumbled, and with a loud, exaggerated belch, he unleashed the magic dad gas.<br />
<br />
The air around Kenny shifted instantly. A warm, dense cloud of gas surrounded him, and as soon as it hit his face, his body began to tingle. The sensation was almost electric, starting at the top of his head and cascading down his spine in waves. His limbs felt lighter, almost weightless, and his clothes, which had once fit snugly, began to feel looser by the second.<br />
<br />
Kenny’s heartbeat quickened, and his eyes widened in shock as he looked down at his hands. His fingers, once strong and mature, were shrinking, becoming smaller, softer. His skin smoothed out, as his arms and legs thinned. His feet lifted off the ground, his shoes now too large as his body rewound in time.<br />
<br />
The tingling sensation intensified, and Kenny could feel the very fabric of his being shifting. His muscles softened, his chest flattened, and his face—once lined with subtle teenage signs of adulthood—became rounder, more youthful. His hair, too, changed, becoming softer, more boyish, as if the years were being pulled away from him, one by one.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t just the physical changes that overwhelmed him. As his body regressed, so did his mind. Memories of being a grown man and even a teenager began to blur, replaced by thoughts and feelings from a much simpler time. He felt a strange mix of confusion and excitement bubbling up inside him, like a child discovering something new and exciting for the first time.<br />
<br />
His clothes hung on him now, oversized and baggy, as his body shrank down to that of a 10-year-old boy. He looked up at Luke—or rather, at Daddy, as his young mind now saw him—with wide, innocent eyes. The warmth of Luke’s dad presence seemed even more imposing now, and Kenny felt small, fragile, like he was looking up at an all-powerful figure.<br />
<br />
Luke chuckled again, patting Kenny’s head. “Well, look at you,” he said, his voice booming like a father talking down to a little kid. “Looks like my magic dad gas worked wonders. You look exactly like Alex did when he was a kid.”<br />
<br />
Kenny blinked, trying to make sense of what had just happened. He felt lighter, more playful, yet a little lost in this new, smaller body. His senses were sharper—the fabric of his now-too-large shirt brushing against his soft skin, the weight of his oversized shoes clunking against the floor, the way Luke’s belly still rumbled with energy as it pressed against his back.<br />
<br />
“I feel… different,” Kenny murmured, his voice higher, more innocent. He touched his small, round face, as if trying to understand the change.<br />
<br />
Luke grinned, holding Kenny in place as if he were nothing more than a child. “Yeah, you are different now. But don’t worry, kiddo. You’re in good hands.”<br />
<br />
Kenny couldn’t help but feel a strange mixture of awe and comfort as he looked up at Luke’s towering figure. The power dynamic had shifted completely. He wasn’t the strong, capable man he used to be—he wasn&#39;t even his teenage son anymore--he was just a little boy now, sitting on Daddy’s lap, his fate completely out of his hands. And despite the confusion, he felt strangely safe, as if this was where he was meant to be.</p>
