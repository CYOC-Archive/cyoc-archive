<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Right on” said James nervously. “I didn&#39;t mean to offend. You see, here, gender is much more fluid, and the social politics therefore much more loose, haha.”<br />
<br />
Regina stopped typing her physics notes for when she got back to Earth and turned around to look at the annoying man.<br />
<br />
“Explain” she said, mildly intrigued.<br />
<br />
“Watch” said James, smiling. He shut his eyes, concentrated intently for a moment, and in a flash, an attractive female version of James was now present, still wearing his suit.<br />
<br />
“Hi” she said, a big grin on her face. Her brown hair now cascaded in waves down to her back. Her curvy backside could be seen filling up the empty space of the chair, her gorgeous face was free of scruff and perfectly made up, her arms and legs slender and beautiful. <br />
<br />
Aziz had briefly looked up from her reading and did a double take. She put her fingers to her temple to indicate more private psychic talk between her and Regina.<br />
<br />
“Holy dogshit, did he just turn into a woman too?”<br />
<br />
Regina thought “Yeah, apparently he did”, which Aziz understood, and she smiled her acknowledgment. Aziz continued to watch their conversation.<br />
<br />
“Well” said Regina to James. “This is the fourth impossible thing that I&#39;ve seen before breakfast today.”<br />
<br />
James&#39; female form than slowly melted back into the male body she had been in before. <br />
<br />
“You two must REALLY be green, and Earth more primitive than I thought, to think of gender in such manichaean, draconian terms. Boys, men, girls, women, intersex, androgyne, anthro, otherkin...in this place, it&#39;s all on a continuum. My apologies, miss.”<br />
<br />
“Are...are you saying that we can shift between male and female sexes here?” asked Regina. She had become oddly comfortable over the last two days with her body, and had been starting to accept her role as a woman more and more, as well as more specifically identifying as a lesbian and all that entailed, but if it were possible to be a man when she wanted to be and a woman when she wanted to be...that would be fascinating on both a personal level as well as an sociological one. <br />
<br />
“Easy!” said James. “Here, let me show you how...”<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Millie and Juliana had watched the demonstration outside, which was still going on with a handful of particularly dedicated couples, go off with aplomb. There had only been one protester at the event, which convinced Principal Negrotti that she had overreacted to the phone calls and emails, and she apologized to them both personally. Millie and Juliana gracefully accepted. There was just one tiny detail bothering them...<br />
<br />
“Did you see Billie Marshall&#39;s mom walk away with that protester?” asked Millie, a modicum of sadness and disappointment in her voice. <br />
<br />
“Who?” asked Juliana, who had to deal with hundreds of schoolkids and their parents every day.<br />
<br />
“I have a student named Billie Marshall. Her mother Elizabeth picks her up every day, and I&#39;ve talked to her many times. I saw her walk off with that crazy religious woman.”<br />
<br />
“Is she a homophobe?” asked Juliana. Millie shook her head.<br />
<br />
“The opposite. She&#39;s probably of the most progressive parents at this school. Even before the change, she had been really active in protests like this one. She&#39;s straight, but she&#39;s been a really good ally of gay people in the past, and she was always very nice to me when I was a man. But I saw her walk away with the protester. And what&#39;s weirder is that I never saw her with a younger body. I never saw her as a hottie like everybody else is. I mean, she&#39;s still really cute, but she&#39;s not sex on legs like everybody else is. Like you are.”<br />
<br />
Millie grabbed Juliana by the waist and slowly pulled her in closer. <br />
<br />
“I wonder...”<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Elizabeth had sneaked out of the coffee shop without either woman, Sabrina or Maria, noticing her exit very much, as they were still wrapped up in their quarrel. She walked home on a very pleasant early-late morning, not even 11:00 A.M yet, and she waltzed back in the family domicile. <br />
<br />
“Robbie?” she asked, not expecting an answer, and she didn&#39;t get one. <br />
<br />
She walked upstairs, still upset and not sure why she had really come back home so early when there was nothing for her here now except for bad memories and a horny wife with wandering eyes. She found Robbie in the bedroom, watching Epic Rap Battles of History and fingering herself on the bed.<br />
<br />
“Robbie?” asked Elizabeth with a flat voice. Robbie, as if she hadn&#39;t even noticed Elizabeth&#39;s voice until just now, removed the offending fingers from her vagina and immediately got up to address her spouse.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” she said with false excitement. “I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back. Hangover is mostly gone. Mostly.” She added the last part in the voice of Newt from Aliens. <br />
<br />
Elizabeth stared for a moment at Robbie. She had to admit, she WAS cute. She looked like every wife&#39;s worst nightmare of a hot secretary her husband was cheating on her with, except in this case, the hot looking secretary WAS her husband. It was the most fucked up episode of that old Chuck Barris game show Three&#39;s A Crowd ever.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth didn&#39;t want to divorce. She loved Robbie, and didn&#39;t want to think of herself as someone who divorces people on a whim, as if marriage were just dating+. Marriage MEANT something to Elizabeth. When she had put the ring on her finger and said “I do”, she was absolutely committed to the &#39;till death do us part clause. In fact, up until the Great Change, their marriage had been great, the opposite of rocky. Becoming an attractive lesbian woman had seriously changed Robbie&#39;s psychology, and had made her extremely insecure with who she was. Perhaps Greta had been right, and Elizabeth hadn&#39;t done enough to make Robbie feel wanted.<br />
<br />
She put all common sense on her mental shelf and sat down on the bed next to Robbie. She then grabbed Robbie&#39;s face and kissed her with all her might.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
“Good point, Mandy. I don&#39;t know what came over me” said Kira. “I don&#39;t grade on a gold star system, but I guess you&#39;re allowed to eat a candy bar or something as your reward. Now go get one before I change my mind” waved the mistress.<br />
<br />
“Oh, THANK YOU QUEEN! I SHALL NEVER FORGET YOUR GENEROSITY!” and snuck downstairs to grab a Snickers. <br />
<br />
“As for you” said Kira, staring at the eternally submissive Dana. “You&#39;re a yes girl. You&#39;ll agree to anything I say, no matter how stupid or poorly thought out. I think you&#39;re due for another punishment before we get to school...”<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Allison&#39;s day was once again for the most part uneventful. She was fitting right into the new social ladder at school, and was glad to be there. After the bell had rung and school had ended, she walked home with Sarah, hand in hand, Allison wanting to skip the entire way, to which Sarah relented with a giggle.<br />
<br />
Allison and Sarah were already in their PJ&#39;s inside Sarah&#39;s spacious room, which was all set up for their little slumber party. Slowly, all the other girls stopped by, either from some school extracurricular activity such as cheerleading or swimming, or from home. All of the girls had been friends for years, since before they could remember, all feeling closer than sisters, and while a few of them were apprehensive about allowing a new woman like Allison into their fold, especially since they had all been familiar with Sarah&#39;s boyfriend Alan, the rest were forward thinking enough to follow Sarah&#39;s lead and make her feel welcome.<br />
<br />
The group of girls all sat in a circle, officially to play their weekly round of Spin the Bottle, which was a perennial favorite none of them had outgrown since their tween years, but first they had to share the day&#39;s gossip. <br />
<br />
“So Allison” said one of the girls, “How hot is Logan Hanley now?”<br />
<br />
Allison said...<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Maria Marisol Sevilla returned to her modest home on a quiet block, a little bummed that she had lost another potential convert to the faith in Elizabeth. She had seemed so promising. When she entered her home, she bent over the embrace her kitty cat Eleanor, shut and locked the door, put away her house keys in the little dish she put change in, and walked into her living room. A large crucifix and a picture of the Lamb adorned her walls, as well as some generic but pleasant paintings of ships at sea. Another day, another struggle. <br />
<br />
She sat on the couch, reading her favorite book of the Bible for the 698th time, the Book of Job, and waited for Elizabeth to maybe, hopefully, call back.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Mrs. Carter had left the coffee shop in a slightly perturbed mood thanks to that horrible brainwashed woman who gave everyone in the faith a bad name as far she was concerned. Sabrina was big on the practical belief of works being equally as important as faith, and faith without works being dead. She had studied theology in her spare time on an amateur level, and was not a fan of the idea of predestination or any of the points of Calvinism for that matter or just plain fundamentalism in general. To Sabrina, it was more important for a person&#39;s heart being in the right place than for them to blindly follow dogma. Logic, and the innate desire of man to do the right thing, is what saved souls, not fear. <br />
<br />
But she put that all aside to embrace this glorious morning for what it was! She wondered where a woman such as her should go off to for some good clean fun...<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s going to be such a shame seeing a pretty girl like you butch herself up, but if you insist...” said the the new woman barber.<br />
<br />
Logan had pointed to Andy(Andrea) the exact cut she had wanted. It was a picture of musician k.d lang, who unknown to Logan, was one of Allison&#39;s new heroes and sources of lust. <br />
