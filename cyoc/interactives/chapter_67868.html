<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A conflicting washed over Brian as he wandered. On one hand, he wanted desperately to get rid of the amulet, but at the same time he wanted to use the thing to maybe end the thoughts that were troubling him. He thought about maybe talking to somebody, but the only people he could think of was his cousin, something he wasn't sure about since he could not think how she would take it if she found that her cousin was a raving loony, and, for some reason, Brenda's friends, which he could only remember that one of them was named Jodie.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is the matter with me?&quot; he huffed in agitation as he looked at his watch, surprised that it was about fifteen minutes after five and that he had been wandering for a little over an hour.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;Besides. Even if I tried to use the amulet, it wouldn't work for another two hours,&quot; he kicked at a small pile of leaves, the feeling of being conflicted growing as he decided that maybe going to the mall and browsing the various stores would help him sort out what he was feeling.<br />
<br />
Suddenly realising that what he was really was thinking of doing was visiting several clothes shops, including a popular one called Fashion U, he took the amulet out of his pocket and thought once again about chucking it into the bushes. Instead of doing that, Brian turned about, thought for a moment he saw somebody that looked a bit like Brenda about a block back and headed in a new direction away from the mall, thinking that staying away from stores would help clear his mind.<br />
****<br />
<br />
Unaware that nearly two hours had passed, Brian eventually wandered into a department store, barely aware that he was somewhere on the north side of town, only that he was torn between what he considered to be rather feminine thoughts and what he thought to be his normal masculine thoughts. Heading for the pay telephones, he picked up the receiver and punched in the information for his calling card his mother had purchased for him a couple months ago and then began to dial his home phone number. When his mother answered, he quickly explained that he was not going to be home for dinner and that he was going to get something to eat with his friends and possibly spend the night with one of them.<br />
<br />
After he had concluded his phone call, upset that he had lied to his mother, Brian merely stood there for a couple minutes, staring down at the amulet of Zulo that he still held in his hand, thinking, &quot;This is all your fault,&quot; but still finding himself unable to dispose of the necklace.<br />
<br />
Turning away from the pay telephones, he thought that he caught sight of his cousin again and for a moment thought about confronting her to find out if she was following him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why would she?&quot; Brian asked himself, unsure why Brenda would be doing something like that.<br />
<br />
Figuring that as long as he was here, he might as well as take a look around, Brian turned away from the direction he had thought he had seen Brenda and heading past the cash registers, he began to make his way through the clothes section for children. A clattering noise caused him to stop and looking back, he saw that a thin line of thread was attached from him to some garment lying on the floor.<br />
<br />
Closer inspection revealed that it had somehow become snagged on the chain part of the necklace and untangling it, accidentally touching the amulet part, but thinking that nothing could come of it since he wasn't actually touching any form of clothing, Brian shoved the trinket in his pocket and walked back the couple of feet to pick up the article of clothing, noting that it was a one-piece underwear with long sleeves with a tag that announced it was made by a company called Dance-Kin, while at the same time he thought it was kind of cute and knew that it was for girls that took dance classes, including ballet.<br />
<br />
Shoving the garment on top of the rack, Brian shook his head and muttered, &quot;Got to get out of here,&quot; and turning away from the rack of Dance-Kin brand clothes, he hurried out of the clothes section.<br />
<br />
As he passed the jewelry counter, he noted that it was unmanned at the moment and figuring that as soon as he ditched the amulet he would feel better, Brian fished the necklace from his pocket and after another moment's thought, dropped it on the counter. Turning away, thinking, &quot;It's for the best,&quot; he hurried out of the store, happy when he saw the bus pulling up and running toward it, he hoped on.<br />
<br />
Taking a seat next to two girls, he was startled to see that one of them was Jodie and when she greeted him, he found himself settling into a frame of ease as he greeted her.<br />
<br />
When she asked where it was he was going, he shrugged and comment, &quot;Just wandering,&quot; and nodding in her direction, he asked, &quot;You?&quot; to which she told him that she was taking her younger sister, Brittany, to her evening recital and then asked if he would like to join them.<br />
<br />
Completely caught off guard, Brian shrugged once again and commented, &quot;Sure,&quot; as he felt that weird sense of ease slipping over him even more as the conflicted feeling left him. And when Brittany asked him something, he answered immediately without giving it a second thought, not realising that what she had just asked was something only a girl would know how to answer.<br />
<br />
And when the three disembarked from the bus, Brian actually found himself enjoying himself, forgetting for the moment his worries about the amulet of Zulo as he, Jodie and Brittany walked toward the recital hall were Brittany had here evening dance lessons.</p>
