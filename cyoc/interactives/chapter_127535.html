<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Knock, knock, Chaddy, anybody home?&quot; asked Richard Ambrose III loudly, as he banged his fist on Chad&#39;s forehead. Then he nodded at Mr. Larson, and turned back to whisper in Chad&#39;s earlobe. &quot;Okay, Chad, I know you&#39;re in there. My father&#39;s tech company developed the wiping technology that Larson used on you. It does wipe out other people&#39;s memories of you, but it doesn&#39;t turn you into a blank slate. But you know that already,  don&#39;t you, Chad?&quot; Richard may a show of flashing at otoscope in Chad&#39;s ears, nose and throat as he walked around inspecting the auction item. &quot;I lost $100,000 on the game you beat my school&#39;s Vikings. You wouldn&#39;t take the bribe like your teammates, and you ran the ball 85 yards to win the game. It may cost me another $100,000, but I will own you and make your life hell.&quot; He opened Chad&#39;s mouth again, and sprayed a tiny bit of pepper spray down his throat. Chad didn&#39;t react, he couldn&#39;t, even though it burned like hell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something wrong?&quot; Mr. Larson asked, coming over. Richard was taking too long with his inspection,  and other buyers needed the opportunity to inspect.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure he&#39;s healthy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, the team doctor certified him before the game last week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm. Well, maybe he is just coming down with a cold or flu then?&quot; Richard said with a shrug. &quot;There&#39;s a red inflammation in his throat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Larson opened Chad&#39;s mouth and looked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm, it does look a bit red. Maybe a side effect of the process?&quot; He suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt it,&quot; Richard answered. Then he asked, &quot;is Chad a virgin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, he was quite the ladies man-&quot; Larson confided. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not that, I mean his assistant is virgin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose?&quot;obviously,  it had never occurred to Larson to consider or check.<br />
<br />
Richard was prepared. He pulled out some rubber gloves, and a tube of lube. Then he pulled down the back Chad&#39;s shorts, and shoved one lubed gloved finger up Chad&#39;s bum. Then two, and finally with difficulty a third. &quot;Well, he seems pretty tight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to inspect his cock and balls too?&quot; Larson asked, as he pulled shorts up in the back.<br />
<br />
Richard looked at him like he was an idiot, and said, &quot;Why would I? He won&#39;t be using them, if I buy him. In fact, I may have them surgically removed.&quot; He strolled off nonchalantly. <br />
<br />
Larson signaled his assistant to send the next prospective bidder over.<br />
<br />
Countess Duchesne looked a bit irritated at being kept waiting.<br />
<br />
&quot;There a problem with the merchandise?&quot;she asked glancing from Chad to Richard&#39;s retreating figure.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Ambrose thinks Chad might have a sore throat,&quot; Larson began. <br />
<br />
The Countess immediately opened Chad&#39;s mouth sniffed and laughed. &quot;Pepper spray. Oldest trick in the book.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pepper spray?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Inflames the tissue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ambrose? I&#39;ll throw the squirter out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As much as I would enjoy that, I don&#39;t know that he did it. You have had others inspect him, no?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but he&#39;s the only one to mention the inflammation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which makes it less likely that he did it. If you were to spray a horse or man to cause inflammation,  you wouldn&#39;t want to draw attention to yourself. Unless you were a fool? After all subsequent inspectors are bound to spot it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Larson looked dejected, &quot;so you won&#39;t be bidding.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Countess laughed,  and grabbed Larson&#39;s elbow. &quot;If someone goes to the trouble of sabotaging the merchandise. It is worth having. Of course, I bid.&quot;<br />
<br />
A truck arrived, and off loaded a dozen young men dressed identically to Chad.<br />
<br />
The auction began with a weasely looking lad named Rico. He sold for under 20 grand. The others ranged from $25,000 to $110,000.  Then Chad was on the block. The bidding was spirited.  The Countess dropped out after the price rose to $325,000. But a German, an Arab and Ambrose kept the bidding going higher.<br />
<br />
At last Richard Ambrose III relaxed as the gavel came down for the third time on his bid. He owned Chad at last. His grin turned to a frown as he realized he had paid $400,000 more for his new boy toy than he had expected.  He paid the banker, and received his ownership papers.<br />
<br />
The Countess walked over to Ambrose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations,  Mr. Ambrose, is it? Dick?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
Richard winced, and replied, &quot;Thank you, and my name is Richard Amorose, Countess.&quot;<br />
<br />
She handed him her calling card, and said, &quot;When you get tired of your new toy, and want to sell him, call me. But I won&#39;t pay more than $300,000.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you bid, $325,000, Countess?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, I won&#39;t bid half a million. Besides he will be used merchandise then, Dick.&quot; And she sauntered away, while Richard bit his lip, and crumpled her card. She knew he would keep it, and that there was a chance he would be calling her in a year or three.<br />
<br />
Flustered that he hadn&#39;t responded right away, Richard shouted after the Countess, &quot;Thank you for your interest, Countess, but I doubt I&#39;ll be reselling him!&quot;<br />
<br />
The shout drew the attention of the other bidders.  And before Chad was loaded into Richard&#39;s horse trailer, Richard had three other calling cards in his pocket. The Arab, the German, and a Chinese who arrived late due to a delayed flight had all given him their cards. He felt a bit better about his bid. <br />
<br />
As he secured the trailer doors, he stopped, and waved Larson over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mr.Ambrose, you certainly got a fine specimen there,&quot; Larson said brightly. &quot;Did you want something more?&quot; He asked, afraid that Ambrose might want a kickback or price adjustment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just to return your shorts and shirt,&quot; Richard said handing Larson the still warm clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, they&#39;re free with purchase,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my pool boy won&#39;t be needing them, perhaps you can use them for your next auction?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keeping him naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps or in a Speedo or thong,&quot; Richard said with a shrug, <br />
&quot;Or even shorts and a tanktop,  but not the cheap Kmart stuff you have there. Versace or Ralph Lauren maybe?&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard got into the vehicle, and his chauffeur drove off with the trailer containing Chad in tow.  <br />
<br />
Chad was aware. He couldn&#39;t speak. He couldn&#39;t move. Someone or something else was operating his body.  Had everyone at school really forgotten him? There were newspaper articles, there were photos and videos, there was social media. His parents couldn&#39;t forget him could they?  What had Larson done?</p>
