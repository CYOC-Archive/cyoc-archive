<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucy was nervous as she hopped off her skateboard outside the address that girl at the coffee place had given her. She&#39;d probably only said it to be polite, maybe she didn&#39;t really expect Lucy to show up. Lucy paced up and down the driveway, she wanted to walk away but the memory of the beautiful brown hairs all over the arms of her cute barrista kept drawing her back to the door. If there was even a chance she could grow hair like that herself... But what was it, some kind of steroids? Something dangerous? No, she should leave. Definitely. But just as she turned to go and dropped her board back onto the concrete she heard a voice call out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! The girl from Starbucks. Lucy right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy turned around to see Meadow stood in the open doorway, leaning agianst the frame. She was still wearing her jeans and shirt uniform. But the shirt sleeves were short so she could easily see the two inch long brown hairs adorning Meadow&#39;s crossed arms. Instantly aroused (again) she found herself at a loss for words.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Meadow, in case you forgot. You wanna come in? Maybe have a coffee? I don&#39;t have any pumpkin spice&quot;, she smiled. &quot;Oh! but I do have some nice weed if you&#39;re into that kinda thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucy was. Getting high with such a gorgeous hairy woman was too good an offer to refuse, so she kicked her board back up and headed inside.<br />
<br />
Growing up Lucy had been obsessed with body hair, the obsession taking a sexual slant as she got older. She remembered that awkward school lesson where your teacher explains about puberty and how hair grows on certain body parts. While the rest of the girls in her class had been disgusted Lucy was mesmerised, and from that moment on all of her fantasies centred on lovely black hair growing all over her. As time went on she listened to her friend&#39;s complaints about having to shave, and moaning about hairy legs but her time never came. Once she got a little older and moved out she even tried ordering herself some hair growth products. She lathered the cream all over her arms and legs, getting off on the dream that it would work. It didn&#39;t. She had given up hope, until Meadows cryptic words earlier that day.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, tea? Coffee?&quot; Meadow asked as she made her way into the kitchen, offering Lucy a place on the sofa on her way. &quot;Tea please, green if you have it&quot;. &quot;Sure&quot;, came the answer from the kitchen, followed by &quot;my weed&#39;s in that wooden box on the table, make yourself useful&quot;. Lucy lifted the lid on the box and took a moment to enjoy the scent that came rolling out, before grabbing the materials she needed. She was just licking the paper and closing the joint as Meadow can in with two steaming cups which she placed on the table, before taking a seat next to Lucy. Lucy offered the joint to Meadow, who shook her head, &quot;you start it up. So... you like hair huh?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Lucy smiled at the directness of the question. She took a toke before responding, settling her nerves. &quot;Yeah, I always have been. I love seeing it on other people, and always hoped that one day I&#39;d see it on myself, but I&#39;d given up hope&quot;.<br />
<br />
Meadow laughed, the sound kind and pleasant. &quot;Well, today your dreams might all come true&quot;.<br />
<br />
Getting more comfortable in Meadow&#39;s presence (or maybe just stoned), Lucy asked &quot;can I touch it? Please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have invited you round otherwise&quot;. Meadow accepted the offered spliff in her right hand and extended her left arm. Slowly settling her left hand on Lucy&#39;s thigh. Lucy&#39;s ran her fingers over the glossy threads of hair. Delicately at first, her fingertips coming into light contact with the ends of the armhairs. Then she placed her hand firmly in contact with Meadows arm, ruffling the hairs and generating some friction. She finished by twisting some of the hairs around her fingertips, leaving behind spiral patterns. Meadow found the attention heavenly, it was the first time anyone else had touched her hair. She looked at Lucy appraisingly, she was definitely cute, and looked to have a great body under all that skater gear. But before she could make any kind of suggestion Lucy spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meadow, it&#39;s just amazing. You&#39;re amazing. You&#39;ve got to tell me how you did it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Meadow wiggled her fingers in the air, &quot;magic&quot; she cooed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, seriously. I might be high, but I&#39;m not a child&quot;.<br />
<br />
Meadow crushed the end of the joint in an ashtray and finished her tea. She rose from the sofa and pulled down her shirt. Before she did so Lucy caught a quick glimpse of the thick brown hairs around ger naval. &quot;I&#39;m gonna go get out of these work clothes. I&#39;ll just be a minute or two. Make youself comfortable. Feel free to skin up again, or make another tea. When I come back I&#39;ll show you something amazing&quot;.<br />
<br />
Lucy rolled a second joint, and as she smoked it wandered around Meadow&#39;s living room. The girl was clearly a hippie. Suncatchers and dreamcatchers competed for space with bamboo windchimes. A large tapestry showing the phases of the moon hung on one wall and half burned incense sticks dotted the room. She used the end of her spliff to light a couple. In amongst the hippe accoutrements were a lot of photos, mostly showing what Lucy assumed to be friends and family members, although Meadow herself was in many of them. Some of them looked pretty recent, but in none of the photos could Lucy spot any sign of the hair that Meadow now had on her arms. Maybe there was magic after all. She chuckled at the thought.<br />
<br />
At that moment Meadow reappeared. She had changed into a short white strappy dress bedecked with flowers and sun motifs. She raised her arms and twirled in the doorway for Lucy&#39;s appreciation. The asian girl took in the thick tufts of brown hair in Meadows armpits, and the luxuriant growth on her lower legs and partway up her thighs. With the late afternoon sunlight playing over Meadow&#39;s face she could even make out a faint downy moustache over her upper lip. It was more hair than she&#39;d ever seen on another woman, and she&#39;d spent her whole life looking at hirsute porn online!<br />
<br />
&quot;You like?&quot; Meadow ceased showing off and collapsed back onto the sofa to finish the second joint. <br />
<br />
Instead of replying Lucy just gaped. And for the first time noticed that Meadow was carrying a hairbrush. &quot;Right&quot;, Meadow began, sitting straight and looking at Lucy through slightly reddened eyes. &quot;There&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to believe me without a demonstration, and to be honest I&#39;m probably about as hairy as I want to be. For now at least. Much more and someone might try and lock me away in a zoo! This brush&quot;, Meadow held it up for inspection. To Lucy it looked like any other brush you&#39;d pick up at the store. &quot;Is magical&quot;, she went on. &quot;Anywhere you brush grows hair. More brushing, more hair. Simple. So... if this is really what you want. Go wild&quot;. Meadow stretched out last word.<br />
<br />
Lucy reached out and picked up the brush. Either all of her dreams were about to come true, or she was going to look pretty damn stupid. Still it was definitely worth the risk.<br />
<br />
There was a rip in her jeans half way down the front of her thigh, through which could be seen a few inches of smooth skin. With one last look at Meadow to confirm she wasn&#39;t the butt of a joke - and the eager look in the other girl&#39;s eyes said not - she carefully brushed over her thigh, once, twice, then moved the brush away to give herself a clear view.<br />
<br />
As she watched something strange seemed to happen to her skin, similar to the goosebumps she got in cold weather. At each bump&#39;s tip a black spot appeared, each one slowly pushing up and outwards revealing themselves to be dark hairs. The hairs grew painstakingly slowly, finally stopping at about a half inch long, straight and thin and jet black. Within seconds the brush had grown more hair on one small patch of her thigh than she&#39;d ever managed to grow over her whole leg. Still not quite believing she played and pulled at the hairs, enjoying the sensation of them being stroked and then wincing in pain. They were clearly attached to her. Lucy, the bald little Chinese girl, had finally managed to grow hair. The possibilities flooded her mind and she desparately wanted to do more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad for a first time. From the look on your face I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t wanna stop there. If you want some personal time&quot;, Meadow smiled suggestively &quot;you can use my room, it&#39;s just through there&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like...&quot;</p>
