<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Experiment Day Two<br />
<br />
Gordon and Jason returned to the university lab the next day.<br />
Gordon had taken Dick home and kept him on a pillow at his bedside, waking to find Teacher Dick mostly recovered from the previous days rigorous testing, and quite upset that he had not been heeded when he asked them to stop about halfway through.<br />
<br />
Gordon smiled at this, loading up a video showing their pre-test interview and Teacher Dick explicitly consenting to the full array of tests without the ability to withdraw consent later without risking the integrity of all the data gathered.<br />
<br />
Gordon and Jason were both surprised to see Teacher Dick’s anger deflate, along with his shaft literally deflating as he realized he would simply have to ride these tests out until it was time to be turned back.<br />
<br />
“When did Hugo say I was going to be turned back?” He asked.<br />
Gordon tilted his head as he realized he hadn’t asked.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, but I’ll ask him today, while Jason and the others undertake the next phase of the experiment.<br />
<br />
“Others?”<br />
<br />
At this point 5 other students entered, each picking up a chair and creating a circle before sitting down.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, this phase, we are going to measure you as we attach you to different people, time how long until you cum, collect your ejaculations in the large beaker in the centre then pass you along. Rinse and repeat.”<br />
<br />
Gordon waved to Jason as he left the room, ignoring Teacher Dick’s protests as the students all stripped off their pants.<br />
<br />
“Alright everyone.” Jason addressed the room as he attached Dick to his groin. <br />
“I’ll demonstrate the first time and we’ll go from there.”<br />
<br />
….………………………………………………………………………………………………….<br />
<br />
Day two of the tests provided Teacher Dick a new perspective. <br />
five new perspectives to be precise.<br />
<br />
Starting off in Jason’s familiar hands, stroking him firmly, ensuring his foreskin slid back and forth over his sensitive head with each stroke. The sound of Jason’s moaning increasing as the pressure inside Teacher Dick grew, his fleshy shaft pulsing and tensing with need.<br />
The familiar taste of cum as it gushed forth strongly, Jason’s hands pulling tightly down to Dick’s base as he shot his load forth into the large beaker in front of him.<br />
<br />
A small but firm tug and then he was being attached to another student, Han, a Vietnamese student in Jason’s class. The cold from the plastic measuring tape against his flesh caused Richard to quiver slightly, as Han called out his measurements to Jason before beginning his own masturbation.<br />
<br />
The new person meant Dick was exposed to a new person’s method of pleasuring their own cock. The different way they gripped, stroked and moved. The altered pace as they built themselves up towards their own orgasm. Han spent a long time gently stoking Dick’s shaft but tightening as he got to the head, his fingers preventing Dick’s foreskin from covering his glans, and allowing Han’s nimble fingers to graze over the exposed flesh. The buildup towards orgasm was slower, slower then Dick wanted to go, and the pressure didn’t seem to build much until it came on suddenly. Han lurching forward to unload inside the beaker. <br />
<br />
As he came, Dick noted his cum tasted more bitter, and he realized he had a preference for Jason’s technique over Han’s so far.<br />
<br />
Next was Albert, A chubby quiet guy who gripped almost too tightly and just pumped his fist at a fixed pace until he grunted, a much smaller amount of cum adding into the pot.<br />
<br />
Next was Dale, one of the football players who was curious about the whole dicking experience, took his time with long slow strokes, intermittently letting go as he asked Teacher Dick questions about his experience. Dale watched Dick bob around, his voice gurgling as he struggled to answer between bursts of precum. The excessive amount of fluid indicating that Dale clearly liked the idea of stroking a sentient dick.<br />
<br />
Harry was a slightly older student in his thirties who interrupted his by tugging on dicks bouncy balls. Dick audibly yelped the first few times, his tender balls not used to the firm pressure, causing Harry to slow down, tugging less gently as Dick adjusted top the strange feeling.<br />
<br />
Finally, Lars, the German exchange student used his own spit for lube, and spent his short session polishing Dick’s oversensitive head. Sadistically grinning as he pulled Dicks skin tight, his other fist held tight at the base. Dick came quickly, the cum gathering on Lars hands before he remembered the beaker, slowly scraping the thick heady cum from his fingers into the beaker before handing Dick back to Jason.<br />
….………………………………………………….<br />
<br />
Jason wiped Teacher Dick down with a damp cloth, before placing him on a stool, turning a timer on then and picking up his <br />
clipboard.<br />
<br />
“Dick, we have two minutes to ask you some questions before we continue. How do you feel?”<br />
<br />
Dick was silent for only a moment before he answered.<br />
<br />
“I feel- I feel pretty good actually. I’m surprised I was able to cum again so quickly without any refractory period.”<br />
<br />
Jason nodded as he scribbled down his notes quickly. <br />
<br />
“I see. Any residual soreness or chafing?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm.” Dick pondered, his shaft twisting as his head moved slowly slide to side, as if he was trying to look over himself.<br />
<br />
“No soreness or chafing at all. My testicles should really be painfully empty and my skin rubbed raw considering only two of you used lubricant. I didn’t even think to pay notice to that as a detail. Although several of you were a little bit rougher then expected….”<br />
<br />
Dick had firmed up again by this point, his semi hard shaft causing his cock head to hang forward, his piss slit poking out of his short foreskin as he turned toward Harry and Lars, before returning his ‘gaze’ back to Jason.<br />
<br />
“How much did I ejaculate?”<br />
<br />
Jason looked past Dick to Dale, who was crouching down to read the beaker. “ its just over 150 teach’, almost enough for a cup of coffee I bet.” Dale smirked as several of the other guys laughed.<br />
<br />
“Wow! 150 mls. And so quickly too! Although I don’t suppose we could have a bit more then a 2 minute break by any cha-”<br />
<br />
BZZZZZZZT<br />
<br />
The loud buzzing of the timer cut teacher dick short, as Jason popped his clipboard down, reset the timer and quickly picked Dick up, attaching him to his groin.<br />
<br />
“Let’s begin round two, although this time we are going to aim for at least ten minutes of masturbation followed by attempting to cum as quickly as possible after the timer goes off. Does everyone understand?”<br />
<br />
Jason looked around, noting every head nod and feeling the strange twitch within Teacher Dick, as his head briefly contracted forward, his attempted words already muffled by a large pearl of precum forming in his cockslit.<br />
<br />
“let’s begin.”<br />
….…………………………………………………………<br />
<br />
When Gordon entered the room with Hugo just after 6pm that day, he was surprised to find everyone standing in a circle around the beaker in the centre of the room, naked, glistening with sweat and cheering as Dale stood furiously jerked himself, dirty talking loudly as he approached his own orgasm.<br />
<br />
“Yeah! You like that you leaky slab of dick? Being nothing but a hard, throbbing cock! Doin nothing but shooting load after load for us? Well!?! Do ya?”<br />
<br />
A loud gurgling sound could be heard, quickly transitioning into gagged moaning as Teacher Dick spewed forth another load, the beaker finally full to the brim, several strands of cum trickling down the sides of the glass container as the room erupted into load cheers, several people slapping Dale on the back as panted, his face flushed red from exertion as he finally flopped down onto his chair. His thick fist slowly teasing the last few drops of cum from Teacher Dick’s pulsing cock head.<br />
<br />
Harry grinned, his hand outstretched as he was eager for his next turn jerking off with a cock that didn’t seem to get tired as Gordon cleared his throat, causing the room to go silent as they all turned to the unnoticed new arrivals.<br />
<br />
“If everyone could take a seat. We have run out of time for today’s experiments but will continue in a few days. Does anyone have any objections to returning in a few days to participate in further experiments? I have spoken with Dean Bullheart and gotten approval that volunteering will count towards extra credit for most science courses as well as time served towards any disciplinary punishments such as …”<br />
<br />
Gordon was cut off as everyone expressed their eagerness to return, clearly not interested in any extra credit at this point.<br />
........................................<br />
As the day wrapped up Jason and Gordon delayed their final clean of the room by using Teacher dick for 3 more loads, although not a single drop of his seed landed any wear that would have caused a mess.<br />
<br />
Both men marveled at how good it felt to get off using a dicked person, and how even the taste of the dicked persons semen seemed to taste significantly better than their own normally did.<br />
<br />
Jason had noted Dale had licked the final drop of semen from teacher dick off his thumb before he left, the muscular lads eyes glazing overslightly as he savored that single drop. Jason knew they would have no shortage of volunteers.<br />
Grinning ear to ear the two of them placed Teacher dick inside the special vat he had delivered that morning, the poor exhausted dick unable to muster ANY understandable answer. <br />
Leaving the room for the night the Gordon and Jason chatted away excitedly about their plans, Gordon describing his own theories about how to make his own dicking ray. <br />
Theories that were too advanced for someone of his knowledge.<br />
Theories that were phrased in a very specific way.<br />
Theories that Hugo heard as he approached, stopping him in his tracks and causing him to hide around the corner until the two sweaty grad students were out of sight.<br />
<br />
Making sure no one saw him enter, Hugo checked his computer, cross matching Gordon&#39;s phrasing and finding the source with ease. Frank, AKA the physics Prickcher and his theories on quantum entanglements. Basic, rudimentary, but on the verge of a breakthrough leading him towards the very core of dicking technology.<br />
<br />
Hugo turned his attention to Teacher dick, floating limply in the small bubbling vat of fluid on the table. Mentally blank from a day of being a well behaved, over worked cock.<br />
Pondering for a moment, Hugo thought about what he would need to do to ensure his own experiemnts were not skewed by the recent developments.<br />
...and if it meant even more humans found their new lives as (preferably willing) dicks, then so be it.</p>
