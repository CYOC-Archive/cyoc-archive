<p>&quot;Don't get me wrong... I just want to take advantage of this situation,&quot; she 
said, smiling at John.&nbsp; &quot; I think that it would be neat if you could do me 
a favor and leave him that way.&quot;&nbsp; Her tone turned more serious. &quot;He has 
been such a jerk lately.&quot;</p>
<p><i>What the heck is going on here?</i> John thought to himself.&nbsp; He knew 
that he could sometimes be argumentative, but he always thought that he got 
along with Katie pretty darn well.&nbsp; Now she wanted him to remain a dog for 
the rest of his life.&nbsp; He just stared at her, lost in saddened thought.&nbsp; 
What could she know about him that made her feel that way?</p>
<p>She must have been able to read those sad thoughts because she suddenly 
shifted her tone once again.&nbsp; &quot;Just kidding you goofball.&nbsp; I don't 
want to marry a dog.&quot;&nbsp; She then went up to him and hugged his neck.&nbsp; 
&quot;I'm sorry.&nbsp; I didn't mean to scare you.&nbsp; I just know how much of a 
joker you can be.&nbsp; I thought that you would get a kick out of me returning 
the favor.&quot;</p>
<p><i>Very funny indeed, </i>he thought.&nbsp; <i>Let's see how you would feel 
if you were once a man, now man's best friend.</i> </p>
<p>The wizard gestured Katie to stand back, and she complied.&nbsp; He then 
muttered something simple about canine and rewind that caused the soft, 
shimmering glow to appear around John's form again.&nbsp;&nbsp; The room was 
growing smaller.&nbsp; The fur was receding from his arms and legs.&nbsp; Legs.&nbsp;
<i>Oh crap! My pants.</i>&nbsp; John saw them behind him.&nbsp; He crawled back 
and grabbed them.... with his hands.&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;I have hands again!</i>&nbsp; 
He then slid the pants on quickly, noticing Katie giggle, out of the corner of 
his eye.&nbsp; He then replaced the rest of his clothing and stood up.</p>
<p>&quot;There you go,&quot; said the wizard, proud of his work.</p>
<p>John didn't know what to say at first, but then an idea came to him.&nbsp; 
&quot;That was an experience,&quot; he managed.&nbsp; &quot;I was a little scared there for a 
moment.&quot;&nbsp; He turned to Katie. &quot;And you. You are something else,&quot; he said, 
changing his initial serious facial expression into a smile.&nbsp; &quot;You really 
had me going there for a moment.&quot;</p>
<p>The old man went back to the counter and set the wand down.&nbsp; He then 
asked, &quot;was there anything I can help you with? - now that we have finished with 
all of that mess?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes...&nbsp; I was going to tell you about how your service staff needs 
to be a little more respectful about people and their wishes to be left alone, 
but I guess that the saleslady was only trying to do her job.&nbsp; I can't 
really blame her for trying.&quot;</p>
<p>Katie was confused.&nbsp; This wasn't the John that she knew.&nbsp; He was 
pretty mad earlier, and he wasn't one to give up an argument easily.&nbsp; But 
then again, he was just a dog a moment ago.&nbsp; That kind of thing might make 
someone act a little odd for a while.</p>
<p>&quot;I will speak to her about not being too pushy,&quot; the old man said with a 
sigh.&nbsp; &quot;Here, let me get you a gift card for your troubles today.&quot;&nbsp; He 
then turned and walked back into what must have been a storage area behind the 
customer service section.&nbsp; John leaned on the counter and waited.&nbsp; 
Shortly after, the man returned with a card in hand.&nbsp; &quot;Here you go.&quot;&nbsp; 
He gave it to John.&nbsp; &quot;This will give you one free outfit fitting from our 
new clothing designer.&nbsp; She is one marvelous artist.&quot;</p>
<p>John took the card and pocketed it.&nbsp; He then used the same had to shake 
the old wizard's hand.&nbsp; &quot;Thanks.&nbsp; It has been, well... an experience.&nbsp; 
We have to be going.&nbsp; We have a dinner with some friends tonight.&quot;&nbsp; He 
then turned and took Katie by the hand.&nbsp; They made their way out of the 
store and, eventually, out of the mall.</p>
<p>&quot;That was certainly big of you John,&quot; she said once they reached their car.</p>
<p>&quot;What was?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The whole forgiveness thing.&nbsp; You know.. both for the man, and that 
saleslady,&quot; she replied.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh that.&quot;&nbsp; He looked around briefly.&nbsp; &quot;That was just a cover.&quot;</p>
<p>She lifted one eyebrow at him.</p>
<p>&quot;You see darling, there are more important things than gift cards,&quot; he said 
as he pulled his other hand out of his jacket revealing his prize.</p>
<p>&quot;The wand!&nbsp; You stole it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shhhh!&nbsp; Geeze.. you want everyone to know?&quot; he said, pulling her into 
the car.&nbsp; &quot;I figured that we could really have some fun with this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what about that wizard?&nbsp; Isn't he going to be a tad pissed off when 
he realizes what you have taken from him?&quot;</p>
<p>John smiled.&nbsp; &quot;I thought of that.&nbsp; You obviously didn't see that 
large box of &quot;to-be-repaired&quot; wands behind the counter.&nbsp; I just pulled a 
tag off of a wand that looks like this one and set it where this had been.&nbsp; 
He might get a little confused, but I removed a few more tags.&nbsp; I think 
that I have left him with a sticky situation of his own.&nbsp; He won't likely 
even bother to retest the wand that I left on the open counter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You better hope not, you idiot,&quot; she said, falling into an angered tone.&nbsp; 
&quot;If he does, you might just as well get used to being called Fido for the rest 
of your life, and just like always you pull me into things.&nbsp; Do you think I 
want to be turned into a dog!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Honey... I just thought&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&nbsp; No you didn't.&nbsp; You never think. That is your problem.&quot;</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>The whole ride home was silent.&nbsp; John had been in this situation before.&nbsp; 
He knew that he could find a way to make things right.&nbsp; They never stayed 
angry with each other for long, and the make-up sex was great.</p>
<p>The silent treatment continued up into the apartment.&nbsp; It was only when 
they were both inside that Katie broke it.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me see that thing,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>John was a bit hesitant.&nbsp; <i>Give an angry woman a tool as powerful as 
this?&nbsp; I think not.</i>&nbsp; &quot;Honey, I think we need to calm down a bit 
before we use this thing.&quot;</p>
<p>She walked over to the couch and sat down.&nbsp; &quot;I just wanted to take a 
look at it.&nbsp; I'm not really all that angry anyway.&nbsp; I just wish that 
you would consider the ramifications of your actions.&nbsp; You need to realize 
that I am with you from now on, for better or worse... even if we haven't said 
the words before our families yet.&quot;</p>
<p>She was right.&nbsp; He had been a jerk. It was stupid to steal the wand.&nbsp; 
But it was sooo cool.&nbsp; He had something in his hand that could affect the 
universe around him in who knows how many ways.&nbsp; And then there was Katie, 
snuggling against his arm.&nbsp; He did care for her, a lot.</p>
<p>He decided to........</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
