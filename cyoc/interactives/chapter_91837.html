<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unfortunately before casting the spell on Jacob, Ric had not thought through the consequences of his spell. The book, being magic altered itself to the desires of its owner, casting the spell which it felt best fulfilled the caster&#39;s desire. Ric&#39;s fascination with his former coach&#39;s body hair and a desire to see him before he&#39;d grown it had been interpreted by the book that Ric had wanted to see Coach Conners before he&#39;d grown any hair at all. As such it had brought a spell forth which would regress Jacob back to before he had any hair at all and thus was continuing to get younger--though at a much less noticeable rate. Too bad Ric hadn&#39;t read the summary of the spell more thoroughly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can call her from our house, no problem,&quot; interjected Josh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, aren&#39;t you staying with Fran--Mr. Mendez?&quot; asked Jacob.<br />
<br />
Ric saved Josh with, &quot;Yeah, but he makes the place seem like a second home to us, come on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still confused and standing in damp trunks and flip flops he had to borrow, Jacob decided to go with it. Besides now that he thought on it, he couldn&#39;t exactly recall which way it was to get home from the pool, and Mr. Mendez he knew lived only a few blocks over. It seemed a little odd to him that he was able to recall where a frien--teacher like Mr. Mendez lived rather easily, but where his own home was seemed quite a blur in his head.<br />
<br />
Upon arriving at Mr. Mendez&#39;s house Jacob took notice of two tomcats which seemed to be wrestling for dominance--an odd thing because wasn&#39;t Mr. Mendez allergic to cats? Jacob dismissed that thought--how&#39;d he know that about his teacher anyway?<br />
<br />
&quot;The phone&#39;s in the hall and I&#39;ll get you some of my clothes to wear.&quot; explained Ric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... thanks,&quot; said Jacob as he headed for where the phone was and dialed the number for home without thinking about it--only wondering what number it was that he&#39;d dialed.<br />
<br />
A woman picked the phone up and it took him a moment to recognize that it was his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey mom, I&#39;m at Mr. Mendez&#39;s house. Can I stay over to hang out with Ric and Josh for an hour before I come home?&quot; asked Jacob.<br />
<br />
There was a long silence on the other end of the line, and for an instant Jacob thought that she might have hung up, but then Angela replied, &quot;Sure thing Jake, I&#39;ll be there in about an hour to pick you up. Love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
What Jake hadn&#39;t realized was that during his silence the spell had begun to affect Angela&#39;s mind into accepting the new reality which was slowly taking shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye,&quot; said Jake as he hung up the phone just as Ric emerged from a room with a t-shirt, underwear, and basketball shorts, Jake retreated to the bathroom at the end of the hall to change. As he stripped off the wet and uncomfortable swim trunks he noticed that he was getting hard again. He tried desperately to think of things that would get rid of his boner--being erect in the shower from the spray of the shower head when Josh and Ric had walked in had been more than enough embarrassment--he didn&#39;t need them to see his hard-on through the basketball shorts that left very little to the imagination and have them think he was a horny fucker on top of that shower experience.<br />
<br />
There was only one way to solve this, and that&#39;d be to masturbate. He hung up the swim trunks on the shower rod over the tub and then stepped into the tub thinking it would be easier to clean up after himself afterwards. Annoyed with himself, he wished he could go back to before he had to worry about boners popping up randomly like this. Unknowingly to him, as he began to stroke himself the spell was already working to make that come true.<br />
<br />
Each stroke felt more exciting than the last--as if it were the first time he&#39;d done this. His lanky leg which could easily reach the other end of the tub with him lying down began to need to straighten out from the bent position Jake had had to keep them in in order to lay down, soon they only just barely reach the other side of the tub. Muscles from regular swim practice began to shrink and smooth over. The tufts of hair around his penis and in his armpits began to pull back and shrink into his skin, and as Jake shot out what felt to be his first ejaculation he let out a small cry during which his voice cracked as he went from one side of puberty to the other.<br />
<br />
As Jake recovered from the experience he felt his penis soften and go limp as it along with his balls shrunk along with the rest of his body. When he was finished Jake was an eleven year old kid who&#39;d yet to have begun puberty at all. Confused as to why he was in the tub and what that weird white stuff was on his legs and penis he began to remember that he&#39;d come home with his new friend Josh to hang out with his older brother Ric while they stayed at Mr. Mendez&#39;s house. Realizing he needed to clean himself up, Jake turned on the shower and aimed the nozzle at his legs and penis. He felt his penis stir and grow a little as he did, which it did every now and then for no reason Jake could understand, so he just let it do its thing as he scrubbed himself with a bar of soap, an odd sensation flooding throughout his body as he did that caused him to drop the soap and shudder. It might have been his imagination but Jake thought he saw the tub grow larger, the faucet seeming closer while the mount for the shower head grew further away. The weirdest thing of all was the feel that the shower head nozzle grew in his hand. Rather liking the pleasurable feeling, Jake continued to let the warm spray hit his eight year old body as the feelings continued unabated.<br />
<br />
Soon he could no longer hold onto the shower head nozzle and it slipped out of his hands, spraying his head and bringing him out of the wonderful feeling that made his body tingle and tickle so. Clumsily he tried to turn off the water as the spray from the water went everywhere, eventually getting to the point where the water from the nozzle died down to a trickle that dripped from it when Jake could no longer turn the gigantic knobs anymore with his tiny hands. Recalling then that he was being babysat by his swim team mentor, Ric who was on the big kids&#39; team, until his mommy could pick him up from practice, Jake climbed out of the tub, recalling it being much easier to get into it than it was now to get out of it. Four year old Jake looked around amazed at the gigantic bathroom which towered all around him. Something was wrong here... he couldn&#39;t think of what, but something was very wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jake you okay, you didn&#39;t fall into the toilet, did ya?&quot; joked what sounded like Josh from the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; sniffled Jake, beginning to feel rather scared by what was happening to him. He began rubbing his hands and chubby arms from baby fat over face and his body in an attempt to simulate his mommy&#39;s hugs of him to make himself feel better, as he did he accidentally bumped his pee pee and felt that odd tingling feeling begin again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t sound so good, are you... o... k....?&quot; asked Josh as he then opened the door and stared at tiny Jake.<br />
<br />
The last bit of Jacob Conners&#39; adult mind reached out from his toddler trap as he said, &quot;Help me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh&#39;s eyes went wide in shock before he then shouted, &quot;Ric! Come quickly!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; grumbled Ric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bring the book, now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ric took his time coming and when he eventually did he also looked rather shocked.<br />
<br />
Jake was shrinking again, this time his legs began to feel weaker as he fell over onto the ground, face first into the shorts from earlier. He began to cry. The world was big and scary, and he just wanted his mommy.<br />
<br />
It was at this point that a knock was heard at the door and Josh went to answer it.<br />
<br />
Not a minute later Jake saw Ange--his mommy rush into the bathroom and pick him up off the floor into her gigantic safe arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you boys do to him?!&quot; demanded his mommy as she cuddled him close to her big chest. He began to hiccup as he felt mommy&#39;s hands pat him and soothe him. Mommy would protect him from the mean old nasty confusing world. Mommy would always protect him. He loved his mommy with all his heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;H--he was fine until he slipped and fell just before you came in, Mrs. Conners, really. Then he just started wailing,&quot; explained Ric.<br />
<br />
&quot;And these clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He wanted to play dress up,&quot; offered Josh.<br />
<br />
&quot;A six month year old baby doesn&#39;t want to do much else than eat and sleep, I doubt he wanted to play dress up,&quot; snapped his mommy.<br />
<br />
Jake was hungry... rather hungry, and he began pawing at his mommy&#39;s breast.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you could give me a little privacy boys, he&#39;s hungry now,&quot; grumbled mommy as she shut the door in Ric and Josh&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Josh then realized what had happened and then turned to Ric and said, &quot;I just wanted to see what he was like without that hair...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ric&#39;s eyes went wide with recognition as he then said, &quot;He still had hair on his head.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that a pleasurable scream came from the other side of the door from Mrs. Conners. Jakes&#39; former wife and now mother. Scared of opening the door Ric pushed Josh at it and told him to open the door. Annoyed, but scared for his former coach, Josh did so ever so carefully, opening it to reveal Mrs. Conners on the toilet--apparently having decided to use it while she was in there, here jeans a mess at her feet, and her t-shirt and bra off of her and on the floor as well. There she sat but what scared Ric and Josh more than anything was the fact that Jake was nowhere to be found, and now Mrs. Conners looked about eight or nine months pregnant. She rubbed her belly and seemed caught up in her own sensations that she didn&#39;t notice the door was open or that Ric and Josh were staring at her. She let out another pleasurable moan and the swell to her belly grew smaller still, finally settling around four months along before it stopped, when Jacob Conners had been without any hair.<br />
<br />
Ric and Josh had just learned a valuable lesson of how to be careful with using the book.</p>
