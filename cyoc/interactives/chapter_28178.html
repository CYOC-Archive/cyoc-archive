<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damia left the apartment, her purse slung over one shoulder.  It was warm this time of <br />
year, not at all like her home country.  She locked the door, making sure no one would see <br />
her...that would make for a lot of questions, to be certain.<br />
<br />
She decided to walk across the lawn, rather than stick to the sidewalk.  The slightly damp <br />
grass felt good under her bare feet.  She felt giddy, almost high.  Being young again was <br />
incredible.<br />
<br />
She felt so alive, so full of energy.  Despite her normal moody demeanor, she felt...happy.<br />
<br />
Despite herself, she set down the purse, and played in the grass.  She hadn't done a <br />
cartwheel in years, but her body seemed to remember.  Flips, rolls, tumbles...her body felt <br />
as light as a feather.<br />
<br />
She stopped some time later, laying in the grass, looking up at the stars.  The physical <br />
exertion had burned up a little of her excess energy, and it felt amazing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better than sex.&quot; she said, and meant it.  Come to think of it, she was feeling a bit <br />
aroused...<br />
<br />
Her stomach growled.  &quot;The machine needs fuel, huh?&quot;  She giggled.<br />
<br />
What was wrong with her?  Just a few hours ago, she had been the type of person who <br />
rarely smiled, let alone laughed.  She remembered sneering at girls who giggled and acted <br />
childish.<br />
<br />
And yet, here she was, just a big kid...and loving every minute of it.  Sitting up suddendly, <br />
she reached for her purse and leapt to her feet.  When she had been younger (the first <br />
time around, that is) she'd had a love for dance and gymnastics.  But even at her peak, she <br />
hadn't possessed this kind of athletic ability.<br />
<br />
The new body she had made for herself had energy to spare, and then some.  She <br />
marvelled at how gracefully she moved.  A small grin crossed her face as she thought <br />
about how easy it would be to become an Olympic gymnast now, with this body.<br />
<br />
She headed towards her favorite restaurant.  Right now, she wanted good food, and lots of <br />
it.  To her own amazement, she was skipping by the time she arrived at Little Europe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nicollette couldn't complain about her job.  Sure, she was just a waitress, but Marcus, the <br />
owner, insisted on paying her the same amount as his other employees, tips or no.  And <br />
the 20-year old was good at making tips.<br />
<br />
Oh sure, she was a little too tall for a girl, but she was cute, and people loved her <br />
personality.  Too bad that didn't translate into many dates...which is why she was working <br />
on a Saturday night.  <br />
<br />
When the girl came in, she wasn't sure what to think.  There was something unusual about <br />
her, that was for certain.  It was hard to guess her exact age; she looked pretty young, and <br />
Nicollette was thinking 10 or 11...maybe.<br />
<br />
She had fair skin, and delicate, very pretty features, dark blue eyes, and platinum hair.  <br />
That last was a bit unusual, to say the least.  &quot;Probably a dye job&quot; she said to herself.  &quot;I <br />
mean, look at what she's wearing...Mom would have freaked to see me dressing like that <br />
as a kid.  Stupid Britney, she's got every pre-teen girl in the country dressing like a slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl marched right up to the sign that said 'PLEASE WAIT TO BE SEATED' and just stood <br />
there, waiting, the picture of barely repressed hyperactivity, as she bounced in place.<br />
<br />
Nicolette was struck by the maturity in the girl's expression, however.  &quot;Um...welcome to <br />
Little Europe, how many in your party?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damia grinned.  She was a regular here, and Nicolette was her favorite server.  And yet, <br />
the tall blonde didn't even recognize her!  <br />
<br />
&quot;Just one, thanks.  I'm starving.&quot;  Her stomach decided to chime in with a growl.<br />
<br />
Nicolette was confused, but no other adults had shown up.  She'd talk to Marcus about it, <br />
but first, there was no doubt the girl was in need of a good meal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right this way, Miss.&quot;  She led the girl to a booth.<br />
<br />
Damia slid right in, still somewhat bemused by how easily this body moved around.  She <br />
gave Nicolette a brilliant smile.  Normally, she'd be mortified at being seen as &quot;cute&quot;, but <br />
right now, she could care less.<br />
<br />
Nicolette felt herself warm up to the girl immediately, and smiled right back at her.  &quot;What <br />
can I get you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damia ordered enough food for about two or three girls her age without batting an eye.  <br />
She hadn't been here in awhile, so she figured she could afford to splurge.  <br />
<br />
Nicolette just stared.  &quot;Um...are you sure you can eat all of that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damia nodded energetically.  &quot;Uh huh!  Oh, and I have money, right here.&quot;  She reached <br />
into her purse and put some bills on the table.<br />
<br />
Nicolette smiled.  &quot;Of course you do, honey.  Ok, I'll put the order in, and get you your <br />
Coke, and some bread.  Just sit tight, ok?&quot;  She couldn't resist ruffling the younger girl's <br />
hair gently before going.<br />
<br />
Damia felt her body get warm.  Sure, she -hated- being treated like a kid....but Nicolette <br />
was cute as hell.  Damia had had quite a crush on the other girl for some time, but, well, <br />
she was pretty sure Nicolette was straight.  Plus, well, she felt intimidated by tall girls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, you could have walked in here at 6'3&quot;, moron.  But nooo...you made yourself <br />
into a little girl.&quot;  She muttered to herself.<br />
<br />
She squirmed a little in her seat, trying to get rid of thoughts a 9 year old girl shouldn't be <br />
having.  It was a little inconvenient to be horny at this age, since she wasn't shopping for <br />
pedophiles.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Nicolette was talking to Marcus about the odd little girl.  Her boss was <br />
convinced that there wasn't anything out of the ordinary, the girl seemed healthy enough, <br />
and had the money to pay for her food, which he wasn't going to deny her.  Sure, it was <br />
odd that there were no adults with her, and that she wasn't wearing any shoes, but...no <br />
reason to make an issue of it.<br />
<br />
Marcus was a good hearted guy, and Nicolette trusted his instincts.  If he didn't see a <br />
reason to call the cops, that was good enough for her.  She chatted with the girl whenever <br />
she got the chance, and was astounded at her appetite, since she finished off her meal in <br />
record time.<br />
<br />
Damia leaned back in the booth, feeling truly content.  And stuffed.  She wasn't sure she <br />
could move right now, and it felt good.  She put a hand over her mouth as she burped.<br />
<br />
Nicolette laughed.  &quot;I'm sorry, Miss, you're just too cute.  I wish I could take you home with <br />
me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damia looked up at the blonde.  &quot;You should be careful what you wish for.  I think I'd like <br />
that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicolette blinked.  Again, that mature expression....  Nicolette felt herself blush.  The <br />
comment was innocent, she's just a girl....but why do I feel like I've just been hit on?<br />
<br />
Damia beamed at the other girl.  &quot;Well, I should be going.  Check, please!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicolette nodded.  &quot;Sure thing, honey.&quot;  She took the girl's money to the register.<br />
<br />
Damia stretched lazily.  She felt like taking a nap.  Too bad Nicolette's lap isn't available...<br />
<br />
And then the taller girl was back.  &quot;And here's your change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damia shook her head.  &quot;You've been really good to me, keep it all, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicolette was suprised.  &quot;Are you sure, dear?  That's a lot of money for a tip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damia got out of the booth and impulsively hugged the other girl.  &quot;You deserve it, cutie.  <br />
Ciao!&quot;  And she headed for the door, waving to Marcus as she left.<br />
<br />
Leaving Nicolette blushing and confused.  <br />
<br />
&quot;She called me a cutie...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
