<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will wakes as someone starts knocking on his front door. His own cum has partially dried on his belly, and he&#39;s for a brief moment confused about his strange situation. It only lasts for a moment though, as the memories flash back. Who ever is at the door knocks again, louder. Panicked, Trevor scrambles to his adolescents feet and reaches for a paper towel on the bench to dry his belly off. With his now short arms and legs, he has to stand on tiptoe and press his body against the side of the cold counter to reach it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will, come on! We&#39;re gonna be late.&quot; That&#39;s Todd&#39;s voice, Will&#39;s cop colleague. Shit, that&#39;s right. Will had asked Todd to pick him up today since his car was in the shop. Panicking, Will looked down at his young naked body, then around for where he left his phone. Where was it!? By the sound of things, Todd was getting impatient.<br />
<br />
&quot;You asleep in there?&quot; Todd calls, banging even more persistently. Will checks his now way too oversized uniform pockets. Keys. Wallet. Chewing gum... But no phone. He could not let Todd see him like this. How would he explain it!? He didn&#39;t want to reveal this awesome power to just anyone, and even if he did, how would he explain his choice of transformation!? Todd might see his profile and notice his attraction to boys.<br />
<br />
Where was that damn phone!? Ah! There on the table! Between his haste to return to his old self and his unfamiliarity with his tiny hands, he managed to fumble the phone and drop it to the floor. CRACK! The knocking stopped, as if Todd had heard the sound. Will dropped to his knees and picked up the phone. The screen had a huge crack through it, causing parts of the screen to be flickering and unreadable.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay in there?&quot; Todd called. Will tried to use his fingerprint to unlock the phone, but his now smaller fingers wouldn&#39;t scan as his. What was wrong with this thing!? Fingerprints didn&#39;t change with age, did they? He instead used the pin code. Simply 1111. Yeah, not very secure. He glanced up just in time to see Todd peeking in through a gap in the blinds, and spotting a naked young boy apparently trying to hide behind the kitchen table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you!&quot; Will panicked, taking the phone and running into the living room. The banging on the door grew louder. &quot;HEY!&quot; Will fumbled the flickering screen of the Chronivac menu, trying to reverse his earlier transformation while on the move and barley being able to make out a thing. It now sounded as if Todd was about to break down his door. Will had to hide. No. He&#39;d be found. He had to run and figure this Chronivac thing out when he&#39;d escaped. He sprinted to the terraces door to the back yard. It took all his weight and strength to slide it open thanks to his small body. There, he made it out and ran for the wood fence and began to climb. God, it had never felt that high before. He&#39;d been able to lean his grown up arms on top of it to talk to his neighbors before. Now he could barely reach the ledge by streaching and on his toes. He hoisted one arm up over it. Almost there. Another. Now to swing his leg.<br />
<br />
A strong and warm hand grabbed his shoulder from behind and yanked him easily back into the garden. Todd towered over him, wearing the stern look of an adult about to scold a child. Even though they were technically the same age, Will shrank back from the intimidation, suddenly overly aware of his own lack of dress. He did his best to cover his privets.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boy, why were you breaking into this house?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...? No, no. I wasn&#39;t,&quot; Will tried, voice already quivering like a boy caught red-handed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you lie. I know you don&#39;t live here. I saw you through the window, stealing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, honest mister. I didn&#39;t steal anything,&quot; Will tried, not sure if he should embrace his adolescent instincts to play the part, or try to concoct some kind of lie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what&#39;s that there in your hand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My phone...&quot; Will said, hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it now. Even though it is exactly the same make as the man who lives here?&quot; He snatched it from Will&#39;s trembling fingers. &quot;Even has the same sticker on the back. Fancy that? And you managed to break the screen. Oh, you are in so much trouble young man. You know the man who lives here is a cop as well? What&#39;s your name?&quot; Will bit his lip trying to thing of a way out. He just couldn&#39;t let Todd know it was him. He&#39;d never live it down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... Draco...&quot; Will said, thinking of the first name that came to mind. His hesitance  revealed it to be an obvious lie, but Todd played along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Draco then, since you don&#39;t want to give up your real identity. Why the nudity? Was it for the extra thrill? Or maybe you thought it&#39;d be harder to identify you without anything on you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm...&quot; Will didn&#39;t know what to say. He avoided Todd&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both I&#39;m guessing. A pervert and an idiot. Where do you live?&quot; Will&#39;s eyes flicked to the balcony he&#39;d left open behind it, and then to the narrow walkway and fence gate Todd had come around through. Will didn&#39;t really have a plan, so to speak. He just wanted to run and hide in shame. He darted between Todd&#39;s legs, half crawling, half running across the garden, before Todd&#39;s much bigger body grabbed him and pinned him face down into the grass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doing this the hard way are we?&quot; Will felt handcuffs click shut around his wrists behind him. Todd pulled him upright to look him up and down.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I thought, a pervert,&quot; Todd said, indicating Will&#39;s tiny erection. Will tried to turn away, but Todd kept him facing him. Todd was spending an inordinate amount of time ogling his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Up against the wall. Got to search you,&quot; Todd ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What!? But I&#39;m naked!&quot; Will protested. He was still shoved against the wall, never the less.<br />
<br />
&quot;Standard procedure. Rules are rules. Got to go by the letter.&quot; Will, as a police officer himself knew of course that this was bullshit. Yet there was nothing he could do. Todd&#39;s hands began to wonder up and down his body, stopping to gently rub all the sensitive places along the way, often multiple times. Will couldn&#39;t help it but moan and quiver as his miniature penis stayed rock hard. Was Todd also attracted to boys!? Cuffing and feeling up a naked boy like this was something Will had fantasized about doing a million times, but he&#39;d never actually done so. Todd was living his dream. Todd&#39;s finger ran up Will&#39;s crack then down, circled his taint to the accompaniment of a gasp, then back up the crack more forcefully, resting against his ass. The other hand slid up the inside of Will&#39;s thigh, played with his not yet dropped balls, then gently running one finger at a time up along his stiff member. Will was moments away from another orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;M... Mister....&quot; he whimpered, not sure if he were begging for more or less.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t answer my last question... Draco.&quot; Todd whispered the fake name directly into Will&#39;s ear, causing shivers to run down Will&#39;s spine. &quot;Where... do... you... live...&quot; With each slow syllable, Todd emphasized it with another intimate stroke. Will gritted his teeth. He couldn&#39;t focus. He couldn&#39;t think of a lie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here! I live here, okay,&quot; he cried. This however, was not an answer Todd would accept.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I&#39;m an idiot? I know the guy who lives here.&quot; With that, Todd flipped Will around and lay him over one knee.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, he wouldn&#39;t dare!&quot; Was what will thought, moments before the first spank took palace. It hurt like hell. The young boy cried out, and Todd had to cover his mouth his his hand before the next swat landed. After five harsh blows, Todd finally released Will&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you live?&quot; he demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Will,&quot; the young boy desperately tried to confess. &quot;I&#39;m Will. I regressed myself with...&quot; Todd covered Will&#39;s mouth again and landed another even harder spank.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can keep going as long as you want to keep lying,&quot; Todd threatened, landing the seventh one. Tears welled in Will&#39;s eyes as he cried muffled screams into Todd&#39;s hand. After the tenth, Todd tried again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you live?&quot; Will didn&#39;t dare answer again. A lie would never work, and the truth even less so, it seemed. The spanking resumed. Will&#39;s ass was beginning to get quite red indeed. Then the unexpected happened. Will creamed himself. On the twelfth spank the boy bucked against the police-man&#39;s thigh and came. Toes curling, back arching, eyes rolling back into his head, Will came.<br />
<br />
&quot;My god, you really are a pervert.&quot; Todd sighed in resignation. &quot;If you won&#39;t talk, I guess I&#39;ll just have to treat you like any other criminal and bring you down into the precinct.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Will softly moaned, still in the after glow of his climax. However, Todd easily stood Will up straight and walked him, naked and cuffed to the police car outside, bringing the cracked phone with as evidence.</p>
