<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>"Nice to meet you, Josh. My name is Lindsay. Just follow me and we'll get started. We've got a lot to cover this morning." the woman said, leaving out the door she had entered through. As I followed her out the door, I could swear I heard one of the girls in the room asking what the others thought I got.
<br>
<br>I followed the woman in silence through a short corridor which ended with an exit. Lindsey stepped outside and stood there waiting for me walking few meters behind her still embarrassed a bit by her amazing sex-appeal.
<br>As we walked I realized something. <i>I might be able to change my profession!</i> In the end I possesed he power to alter realities.<br>I crossed my finger and whispered. <br>"In this reality I am assigned ot become a lawyer"<br><br>Nothing happened. Not even a familiar shiver running down my spine which accompanied the reality alteration each time I made it happen. Why was that?<br>And then I got it. When I described the new reality and the profession assignment process I said that nothing can interfere with the program. Apparently that included my own powers!<br><i>Shit.</i> I thought. I was doomed.<br>

<br>"So now we can talk freely with nobody around." she started as soon as I joined her outside. "First of all, sorry for being late. I hope that the changing procedure hasn't started yet. Usually it takes about 10 minutes for the devices at the Remote Enhancement Center to track a person and begin the process..."
<br>
<br>I looked at my watch. It was 8:04. I hoped they could begin the process even later. Or best - never. Once it starts, I'm doomed. The letter clearly said <i>'no negotiation, no complaints. You have to stick to what you got.'</i> I knew already that I was going to hate every single thing that was going to happen to me.
<br>
<br>I opened my mouth wanting to ask if she knew any way of changing set profession, but before I said anything Lindsay turned away from the building and started walking away.
<br>
<br>"Come on." she continued "Lets take a walk in the park. It should be a good place to talk until the changes become noticeable. Then we'll go to my place; we don't want people to see you transforming, do we?"
<br>
<br>I nodded and joined her on our way to the park. We walked in silence for few minutes, Lindsay apparently simply enjoying the nice weather and me being to nervous to say a word. When we reached the park's gate a shiver ran down my spine, but it wasn't like the one caused by my powers. It was much <i>warmer</i>... For a brief moment I felt like if all the shivers I had in my life came back again at once. Then it was gone. I stopped walking and simply stood there with terror on my face. I knew what that thing meant.
<br>
<br>"Oh, I guess that the guys at the Enhancement Center finally began the process!" she looked at me all happy and smiling but when she saw my anxiety she suddenly went serious. "Listen Jon, to be honest with you you're the first boy I am supposed be a mentor for. Until today they only gave me girls. I know that I can't possibly imagine how you must feel right now, just about to change your sex for the rest of your life."
<br>
<br>The words <i>'rest of your life'</i> echoed in my head.

<br>
<br>"The only thing I can assure you about though, is that in the end you are going to enjoy your new life. Believe me. For now you have to fight your fear and work with me. Trust me that neither me nor you want you to end up living in a kennel."
<br>
<br>She smiled warmly at me. And what a beautiful smile it was. Her pout, red lips arched gently as her deep blue eyes were looking at me with almost motherly care. It still didn't convince me but apparently was subconsciously helpful as I finally found a courage to speak.
<br>
<br>"Is it going to be painful?" I asked
<br>
<br>"What? The transformation? From what my trainees were saying - no. Your customers? Maybe the first time, but that's not what we should discuss now. Have you read through the letter you got from the reception?"
<br>
<br>"Yes I have..." I answered scratching my scalp as it felt a small itch "Is all this stuff written there actually going to happen to me? I mean it was quite specific when it was about my future... measurements." 
<br>
<br>I felt I was blushing. Lindsay paused for a while and then answered slowly:
<br>
<br>"Mostly yes. Once or twice I had a girl which developed slightly differently from what she had specified in her letter. But the differences were always... in the favor of the profession, if you know what I mean. Also usually there are some minor extra 'enhancements' being made which are not mentioned in the letter.
<br>Many of my trainees got some habit they weren't able get rid of, usually a compulsion to keep making suggestive lip-bites or something like that. Some have their hair color, type and length changed. Most of them also complained about having to throw away all their pants as their buttocks tended to plump out quite significantly. Then there was stuff like increased flexibility, smoother and more sensitive skin or simply their nipples getting overly pronounced. One girl got an additional mental feature: extreme submissiveness. She made some career in BDSM but eventually gone bankrupt as her clients could simply command her not to accept any payment from them. I mean, you spent your life as a guy, you should know what things make a girl more appealing as a prospective sexual partner. Any of these can be applied to a candidate.
<br>To be honest I can't say which of the 'extras' will apply to you. Maybe none, quite possibly all of them, or you can even get some extras I haven't seen yet. I do realize that me saying this doesn't make it easier for you but I have to prepare you for all the eventualities."
<br>

<br>She was right. Her answer didn't make it any easier for me.
<br>
<br>"So I'm guessing that there's no possibility for me not becoming a girl in..." I looked at my watch again. "3.5 hours?"
<br>
<br>"Well actually," Lindsay said in quite a serious voice "the timing for the physical changes shown on the letter is a bit misleading. The vast majority of the changes occur during the second hour of the process and the remaining two hours serve just to make finishing touches to one's internal organs and to check for possible errors. In fact, you know, we don't have much time left before your actual changes begin so I think we should start heading to my place. It's quite close so don't worry about people seeing your transformation. And then we can talk about your new duties and skill you will need to develop."
<br>
<br>"Ok. Lead the way then." I couldn't really argue. In the end in just few dozens of minutes she was to be be the only person left in the town who still would be able to recognize me. "Just wait a second." I said as I felt my shoes were a little loose "I have to tie my shoelaces."
<br>
<br>I squatted to deal with my shoes but what I saw surprised me. My shoelaces were tied tight as ever! That must have meant... My feet were smaller, that's why my shoes felt loose!
<br>
<br>
<br><i>"Oh my God! It has begun!"</i> I thought and run back to Lindsay trying to not tip over my now-too-big shoes...</p>
