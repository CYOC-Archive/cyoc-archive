<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While you slithered off your dominant partner seemed to have occasional trouble controlling your more controversial thoughts since you weren’t completely gone just yet. You both hissed in pain from the splitting migraine in your brain as the both of you continuously seemed to question if you were two or just one. The nearby husky ran up to you, he must’ve heard your shared hissing with those sharp ears of his. He was so nice, caring, and that musky latex of his always turned the both of you on, and he was always such a dominant yet sweet guy. How could you ever live without someone like him in your life?<br />
<br />
The husky reached out and rubbed your cheek before kissing you deeply on the lips, and a few moments after you broke the kiss the splitting pain continued. It was then suddenly you felt your host take charge, and suddenly you felt yourself being forced out of his head. For a split second you wondered if you were getting a body of your own. However, everything just went pitch black, and you couldn’t hear, nor smell or taste for what felt like the longest time. In reality it was only about a minute or two, but what was freaky was you felt like you were moving but within the tight latex body of the snake.<br />
<br />
Gradually your senses would start to restore themselves, but you couldn’t move your arms, or tail. Your vision was blurry, your hearing was muffled, and you had the saltiest smell and taste in your mouth. The pleasure and sexual lust you’ve succumbed to seemed to be amplified, and your whole body felt sensitive and throbbed even with excitement over these urges. By the time your vision cleared up you saw that you were eye-level with the husky’s girthy sheath, and you started to feel stiffed by the moment, drooling white salty latex from your mouth before you felt a hand wrap around your body, giving you a slight boost of pleasure making you hiss whimsically and gargle the substance in your mouth.<br />
<br />
You then noticed a few peculiar things, first was that the hand was black and reptilian and you felt like it was your own, but you couldn’t move it whatsoever. The next was that you could see the head of the snake, your head smiling above you, and you felt that it was your host’s head solely now. Finally, with what little movement you could make with your body as stiff as it was, you felt you had control over one other part of your body. However, when you caught a glance at what you controlled, you only saw a scaled sheathe, a set of large testicles, and your shared pelvis with your host.<br />
<br />
At first you were confused, but you felt like your host was stroking you with care, and the more he did, the more horny you felt and the more compelled you felt to listen to your instincts, and his guidance. Your host didn’t speak, only moan and hiss with pleasure before the husky kissed him deeply, and looked down at you with a wide toothy smile from cheek to cheek. <br />
<br />
Your host seemed to communicate something to you throughout all of this, and you weren’t sure whether it was thought, instinct or just the latex’s way of forging your brotherhood with him. The one thing you did understand however was your host’s command,&quot;More,&quot; and at the same time you heard this you glanced back at your testicles and felt them twitch. Then you tried doing something, and this resulted in your balls suddenly swelling, and you felt a pressure building in the back of your throat.<br />
<br />
The husky noticed your pleasure and grinned, unsheathing his cock and shoving it into your snout. Without a second thought you unhinged your jaw and deep-throated the wolf’s magnificent musky man meat, and started sucking on it as if you were feeding from a bottle. The husky followed this up by deeply kissing your host once more, and your host wrapped the canine in his coils, all the while you were giving the kinkiest blowjob of your life.<br />
<br />
The two of them rolled around with you sandwiched between them for a few minutes, your host groping the husky’s ass and fingering his asshole, while the husky had a firm but loving grip on your balls. You then felt the husky’s dick tense up in your mouth, and suddenly his hand clenched your scrotum tightly and the result made your entire body tense up. Then suddenly the husky howled out and your host hissed loudly, and at the same time you felt the husky shoot hot and steamy latex down your throat, you suddenly spewed a waterfall of white latex out of your mouth.<br />
<br />
Afterwards the husky pulled out, and you felt nice and loose, while also drooling massive amounts of multicolored latex from your mouth in complete euphoric lust. You practically painted the wolf’s pelvis white from the geyser you shot out of your mouth, and you started settling into your new role, the most important role. It was your job to produce latex, and disperse it while providing massive amounts of pleasure and love to your host and his mates. You were as long as a boa constrictor, and although you were just an organ attached to your host he made it clear that he knew you were conscious and sentient as the words,&quot;My dick, My love, My brother, My lust,&quot; came into your mind from him.<br />
<br />
You looked up at your host and smiled wrapping your long body around his shoulders and neck gently, you still drooled a bit of latex semen from your mouth but neither you, your host, nor the husky minded. The husky even gave you a kiss on the forehead and licked your balls and scrotum clean before you yawned and grew exhausted along with your host. You figured it was time to sleep so you slinked yourself into the warm comfort of your host’s sheath and coiled up inside, content on fulfilling the important role of phallus for him, and all he may love. You wondered if you would even be thrusted into a tight musky asshole, or maybe even a fleshy slick pussy. Until that day though, you would simply sleep, pop out of your home and show affection to your host, and cum whenever he deems it fit. <br />
<br />
Some time later whenever you woke up and yawned, you poked your head out of the sheath and noticed your host had moved. What has he been up, to you wonder as you emerge, soon enough you get an answer upon seeing...</p>
