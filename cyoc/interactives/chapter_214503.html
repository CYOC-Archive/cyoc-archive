<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lily sat in the back of her sister’s jeep feeling more like a little kid then a 23 year old women who was on her way to spring break. Lily looked toward the driver’s seat to see her older sister, Sarah. Sarah was only two years older then Lily but if you put them side by side, most people wouldn’t have guest that they were sisters.<br />
<br />
Sarah took after their mother’s side of the family while she took after their father’s. Sarah was tall just passing 6 feet, athletic with long blonde hair which went down to the small of her back when it wasn’t kept up in a ponytail with shinning blue green eyes. She had a strong core from years of physical activity ranging from soccer to volleyball and strangely boxing. She could make anyone turn their heads and look at her if she wanted. But the thing that really stood out was her chest, Sarah had to wear a D size bra while Lily looked down at her A size breasts which where currently contained in a red one-piece swimsuit. <br />
<br />
Lily was shorter then average, with dark green eyes and a thin frame, with her small chest she was often considered a boy in school. Throw in the fact that she looked extremely young to the point that she got carded to make sure she was old enough to see an R rated movie. Some had said she had the better ass then her sister, but she wasn’t sure about that. Her aunt whom she took a lot of her physical traits from, including her dark red hair which she kept in a short cut told her that when she is older it will be a blessing to look younger than she was. She couldn’t see it now, but she was looking forward to going for a swim in the ocean. Something she loved.<br />
<br />
“Well, we are here.” Said Sarah as her jeep pulled into the parking space as the four of them got out. Along with Lily and Sarah, there was Sarah’s best friend and roommate Amy and Lily’s best friend Kim. <br />
<br />
Amy got out of the passenger seat and stretched her body, she was tall as well but not nearly as tall as Sarah, with a short pixie cut black hair and a good but not over the top size chest. The light purple bikini she currently had on made them look even bigger then normal. <br />
<br />
“I’ll get the stuff out of the back.” Said Amy as Lily got out of the jeep.<br />
<br />
“I texted the guys they are right behind us.” Said Kim as she looked at her phone, she was about average size with blondish, brown hair which she kept about the length of her shoulder blades. Her blue bikini looked good on her, not over the top and clearly feminine. <br />
<br />
“I see them.” Said Sarah as she waved at a truck which was pulling up beside them. <br />
<br />
Coming out of the truck where Tom, a blonde hair young man who was Kim’s boyfriend, he was fit but not over the top having been a cross country runner in his days but he and Kim seamed to get to get along great. <br />
<br />
Along with him came his fraternal twin brother Mike, he was slightly heavier but had much more muscles than his brother and seamed to Lily at least to be the quiet silent type, she didn’t know him all that well. And lastly to her annoyance was Chris. <br />
<br />
Chris had been in a few of her classes in college and drove her up the wall, he was the definition of a bro frat type. Stylized hair, always talking about his sexual conquest and the like. He went on for over two weeks once talking about a poker tournament he won and even had his winning hand, tattooed on his forearm, the Queen being nude on the tattoo for good measure.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t know he was coming.” Apologized Kim to Lily.<br />
<br />
Before Lily could answer a beautiful song filled the air, it was magical. She couldn’t understand the words but it sounded so heavenly. <br />
<br />
Then she noticed that she couldn’t move. <br />
<br />
It was as if, someone or something had taken control of her body, she turned and closing the jeep door began to walk down the beach. She wasn’t alone, she saw her sister seemly in the same trance walking ahead of her. She tried to stop, tried to yell for help but she couldn’t even speak as she headed down the beach. <br />
<br />
They walked past the volleyball court, past the bathrooms and pass the bulk of the crowds to head toward where the beach turned from soft sand to pebbles. Few people if anyone ever went here so it was empty. All the while the sound was getting loader and stronger. <br />
Finally she stopped and turned to face the water, from the corner of her eye she could see everyone else all seven of them had done the same. All of them seamed to be lost in this trance.<br />
<br />
Then as one, they all marched into the crashing water. If anyone had been watching, they would have seen seven fully dressed people walk right into the surf before diving under the water. <br />
<br />
They swam as one, before finally moving into a mass of sea weed. <br />
<br />
In her head Lily was screaming, praying for help all the while the song was getting loader and even more inviting. <br />
<br />
Finally, they burst into a small clearing in the weed to see something impossible. There kneeling around some statues in the sand, where mermaids and merman. It was they who were singing and calling them in. <br />
<br />
They came in all different colors, both tails and skin tones, with some of their hair colors being impossible, a mermaid with neon blue hair standing out as she kept singing. Some looked more human than others. They had multiple types of tails, from the classic tails one would see in the movies, to shark tails, to eels, octopus and what looked to be a starfish type of tail. For some reason, Lily focused on their ears, some had regular human ears, others had pointed ears, while others something that looked to be like fins where their ears should be. <br />
The mermaids and merman kneeling in the sand kept singing as other mermaids and merman came forward and took each of them. <br />
<br />
Lily wanted to fight, but her body wasn’t hers to control. She found herself led toward the seaweed and then while she swam there. A merman covered her throat with some kind of paste.<br />
<br />
“That will allow you to breath when we start the ceremony for each of you.” Said the merman as other merman and mermaids, used the seaweed to tie her up. She could feel it as they wrapped her legs together and then her hands. They tied her in multiple places, across the chest, her elbows and knees, her hips and finally her head. She opened her mouth as they used the sea weed to gag her. <br />
<br />
She saw, that this was happening to everyone as they tied all of them up in a circle around where the other mermaids and merman where singing. <br />
<br />
Finally, the song reached a high point before stopping. <br />
<br />
When the music stopped she gained control of her body and instantly began to pull and fight against the sea weed restraint but it was too tight. At that moment she realized she was still breathing, somehow water was passing through her noise and yet she was breathing.<br />
<br />
“Welcome.” Said a merman who swam forward. “You have all been chosen by the Gods and Goddess of the sea to become mermaids and merman and live the rest of your lives in the sea. Now one at a time, you will be brought into the circle to be remolded by our gods and goddess into the mermaids or merman you were always meant to be.”<br />
<br />
Who is the first to transform.</p>
