<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Its not too much&quot; he reassured himself... he wouldn’t be gaining as much as Jason was. Maybe it wouldn’t be noticeable in clothes?<br />
<br />
Jeff glanced back at the timer, now only 6 minutes left. &quot;Damn&quot; he said under his breath. He clicked the &quot;BEGIN&quot; button. Then the window was minimalized, yet again, and Jeff rushed up stairs to see what was happening to his brother. He got to the top of the stairs and walked briskly into the kitchen. His brother was sitting in a chair at the small round table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude&quot; Jason said upon seeing his brother &quot;when did you start shaving?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff had forgotten about his new thick 5 o'clock shadow, a thought came across his mind 'i should have done a better job at shaving' <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I dunno, I’ve been shaving for, uh, a while&quot; Jeff replied hesitantly. <br />
&quot;Man, i wish i had that much of a beard when i was your age, i didn’t even start getting anything until i was 18&quot;  Jason said. <br />
<br />
&quot;damn Jeff!&quot; he exclaimed while looking down at Jeff's neck. &quot;When'd you get so hairy?&quot; pointing to the patch of hair that pushed out from under the collar of his shirt. <br />
<br />
&quot;um, i dunno, why? is it really that bad?&quot; asked Jeff, enjoying this.<br />
<br />
&quot;no, well, you're just, hell, you're a hairy bastard&quot; He said with humor. <br />
<br />
Jeff shrugged his shoulders took time to observe his brother. Ironically, Jeff noted, his brother had a shadow of a beard on his own face. Jason's added weight wasn’t terribly noticeable, well, or it wasn’t at first, but it became apparent. Jason's normal sized physique seemed much wider, his stomach area in particular, Jeff could see a clear outline of a belly underneath Jason's white shirt. Not only that but his chest was clearly outlined by the white fabric, and two muscular pecs could be clearly seen. The sleeves of his shirt were pretty high up on his arm, showing off a thick, muscular arm. It wasn’t huge, by any means, but it looked like he worked out a lot. In fact, Jason was already starting  to look pretty buff, or his upper body anyway, it was looking good, but his growing gut seemed a little out of place. <br />
<br />
Jeff turned around and grabbed a bowl from the cabinets, went over to the fridge, opening it, and taking out the milk. Cereal today.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Jeff was watching his brother in the corner of his eye. He seemed a little confused, and was staring into his arm at the moment, and rubbed it a little with his hand. He DID look wider, a little bigger. And his face! he definitely had a five o’clock shadow now...<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, it feels like something has happened to me, I swear. Its like, I’m getting... like...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason stood up out of his chair. And when doing so his body seemed bigger still. His gut was now clearly pushing on the fabric of his shirt, and the poor shirt was starting to get a little small for him. The end of it now only barely past his gut, almost exposing it.<br />
<br />
His waist line was now obviously too big for his shorts. they'd been unbuttoned, and still seemed tight on him. <br />
<br />
&quot;God, its like, my shorts... my shirt... its like...&quot; he stuttered, he seemed confused. &quot;and my arms... and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason's pecs were now clearly visible, they looked good, strong. His arms too, thick, and as he moved them, his biceps flexed showing off his newly grown muscle.<br />
<br />
Jason glanced down at his body, placing his hand on his noticable gut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddamn, do you see this Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn’t like this before, i swear, its like I’ve gotten fat or something, I’m bi--&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason cut off this and walked out of the kitchen and into the hallway. Jeff put down his bowl and followed Jason, and as he did so, he noticed, as he walked, a slight pinch of his pants, a little snug, maybe.<br />
<br />
As Jeff walked into the hallway he heard a loud &quot;WHAT-THE-FUCK!&quot; from the bathroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is happening, what the hell...&quot; Jason cried hysterically. <br />
<br />
&quot;wait wait, what?&quot; replied Jeff, feigning ignorance.<br />
<br />
&quot;cant you tell, look at me! I fucking shaved this morning! and look at my face, my hands, my arms, it looks like I’ve gained 50 pounds, Jesus!&quot; Still hysterical. Jason glanced back at the mirror. He looked so different, he didn’t recognize his own body.<br />
<br />
Jason scratched his chest, not thinking. &quot;I've grown, I swear, I wasn’t this big I wasn’t, not earlier! i swear!&quot; cried Jason &quot;goddamn, look, my clothes don’t even fucking fit me anymore, god, what the hell... its so... tight...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason began to undo his zipper, his button already undone, and he swiftly pulled off the shorts, leaving him only his boxers.<br />
<br />
As he lifted up his arms to inspect his new stubble with his hands the bottom of his white shirt lifted up, exposing the bottom of his now bulbous stomach. A dark, thick line of hair covered his gut, all the way up to his belly button. <br />
<br />
&quot;God damn, why am i so...&quot; He looked at his arms again, still scratching his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesu--&quot; He looked down, now gazing between to muscular pecs with a view of a large belly. &quot;i feel heavier... i can feel it...&quot;<br />
<br />
He promptly reached down and grabbed his shirt, pulling it up, and over, and finally off of him.<br />
<br />
Jeff now could see what the chonovac had really done to his body.<br />
<br />
A full, round, and unusually hairy stomach was set underneath two muscular, also rounded pecs, covered in hair. Jason's chest was very similar in appearance to his own, thickest in the center and thinning out, but Jason's was noticeably thinner, and didn’t extend  quite up to his neck. Hair protruded from underneath his arms, and his forearms themselves were quite hairy.<br />
<br />
Jason, now in shock, looked back at the mirror, at his arms, at his chest, and finally back at Jeff. A shocked looked has taken his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;How the Fuck--- I’m so hairy, what the hell, what’s happened to me… why, I’m so...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff thought to himself... &quot;the transformation should be about over. Jeff then looked down at himself, reminded of the transformation he was undergoing. Something caught his attention, his own chest seemed to stick out farther than normal, and his stomach too, it seemed more noticeable, much more so, you could actually see it now under his shirt!<br />
<br />
&quot;I don’t know what the fuck is going on, what’s happening to me, but im not hallucinating, right?!? i look bigger, don’t I? my gut, i have a big gut, don’t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm...uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn’t it look like i grew or something?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;yeah, yes. you look bigger than  before&quot;<br />
<br />
And in fact, he did, he did look bigger now than he did when Jeff first saw him when he was sitting in the chair. <br />
<br />
His gut was so large, so surprisingly large, and his chest had grown pretty buff, and his arms too, but his face looked the same, well... he now had a pretty substantial amount of stubble...actually, Jeff thought, it was now past the point of being even stubble, it was more like a really short beard...<br />
<br />
&quot;Goddamn, i need to be alone for a bit, i might take a shower or something... God, my clothes dont fit me... what the hell...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;i guess you could borrow dad's&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus, Christ, I’m fat!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not fat&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;than what am i?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;uhm... uh, you've just gotten big... maybe its something you ate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that’s shit, I know, I can feel the weight, its fucking massive&quot; replied Jason as he patted his gut.<br />
<br />
&quot;its not that big&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;but what if it keeps growing, AM I DREAMING, WHAT THE...!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jason slammed the bathroom door, he was so concerned, thought Jeff, when he shouldn’t be. He was in control, he was done by now, for sure. or was he?<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down at his own stomach, it did look pretty round didn’t it, at least compared to before.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'LL BE OUT A LITTLE LATER, I JUST NEED TO SORT THINGS OUT&quot; cried Jason in a very concerned tone from inside of the bathroom. <br />
<br />
Jeff hadn’t exactly seen his brother shirtless often, but he KNEW his body looked a lot different. He KNEW he looked a lot more hairy. Jeff was amused, pleased even. He had to hide it, But he thought his brother looked pretty good. He wasn’t so skinny now, he was pretty big. He looked strong... <br />
<br />
Jeff patted his own stomach, growing with each glance down, it seemed. His body too, was starting to look thicker, at least from his perspective.<br />
<br />
Jeff decided to run back down to the chronovac. He rushed down the stairs, and he heard, as he walked into his room, the shower turn on in the bathroom above.<br />
<br />
Jeff walked over to the machine, he looked at the screen and at his own transformation window &quot;3.26 minutes remaining&quot; it read. Jeff took off his shirt. He still wasn’t used to how hairy he'd become, and so looking down at his bare chest was like staring at someone else's body. It was awesome, he thought, but it still felt so strange.<br />
<br />
The hair, he thought, made the changes less visible, but he could tell, nevertheless, that he WAS bigger, his chest poked out more, and his stomach too, forming a little round belly, completely covered in hair. His arms, he felt them, the seemed thicker, and bigger, just feeling them. He flexed his arm. His bicep now looked to be the size of a small orange, it was big for him, he felt bigger, and he liked it.<br />
<br />
He looked back at the chronovac, and indeed, his brothers transformation was done, and he could now do whatever he wanted again, to his brother who was showering above him.<br />
 <br />
Jason's info popped back up again, and Jeff looked at the many options... 'what should I choose?' he thought. Jeff moved the curser over the info and chose to...</p>
