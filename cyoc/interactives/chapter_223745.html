<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Amy thinks about what to do with Jeff, her mother calls for her, “AMY, COULD YOU PLEASE COME DOWN FOR A MINUTE?”<br />
<br />
“ON MY WAY, MOM,” the 10 year-old girl calls back, ‘I wonder what she wants,’ she then thinks to herself as she heads out of her room.<br />
<br />
Amy finds her mom in the living room, “what’s up, mom,” she asks.<br />
<br />
Jane turns around, “wow Amy, that is an amazing costume,” she says when she notices what Amy is wearing, “I hope it wasn’t to expensive.”<br />
<br />
Amy smiles, “thanks mom,” she says, “and no, it wasn’t expensive at all.”<br />
<br />
Jane smiles, “good,” she says, “you look like a beautiful witch. I bet you’ll turn lots of heads, but don’t start anything with a boy, you are to young for… that!”<br />
<br />
Amy mentally scowls, ‘I can do with my life what ever I want,’ she thinks to herself, Amy is mentally so messed up, that she thinks she is old enough to make her own dicisions: if she wants to have sex, she WILL have sex! Besides: she is old enough to be a mommy herself! At least that is what she tells herself and believes in it. “Don’t worry mom,” she then says, “now, why did you call me?”<br />
<br />
“Right,” the woman says, not noticing her daughter’s green eyes and C-cup sized breasts, “it’s about dinner. I was thinking of making a three course meal.”<br />
<br />
Amy smiles, “sounds great,” she says, “what were you thinking of making?”<br />
<br />
“As a starter, I thought a nice Potato Soup with sausages, as a main course I’d make a stuffed chicken and as desert Ice-Cream!”<br />
<br />
Amy’s mouth waters, “that sounds great mom,” she says, “so, what is it you need me for?”<br />
<br />
“I need you to prepare the chicken for me,” Jane says, “while I do some shopping, I need to get a few ingredients for the stuffing. There is a whole chicken in the freezer, if you get it out while I am shopping, it should be thawed by the time I get back.”<br />
<br />
Amy suddenly gets an idea of what to do with Jeff, she grins evilly inwardly, “sure thing mom,” she says, ‘hehe… I will most certainly enjoy the “chicken”! Hehe… oh Jeff, you’ll be sooooo tasty!’<br />
<br />
The 10 year-old girl waits until her mother has left the house, Amy heads to a window and watches her mom get into her car and drive off. The second the car has turned a corner and is out of sight, Amy heads into the basement and grabs the fried chicken out of the freezer, she then carries the chicken up to her room and frees the frozen chicken from its packaging.<br />
<br />
Amy holds out her palm over the chicken, her hand then starts to glow red, so does the frozen chicken. Suddenly the chicken starts to grow, it stops growing when its headless body reaches Jeff’s shoulder height. The chicken then starts to move and suddenly jumps up onto its leg stumps, the glowing stops and Amy grins at the large headless chicken.<br />
<br />
“Go, get him,” Amy says in a commanding tone, the body of the chicken then turns and wobbles out of the girl’s bedroom, heading directly towards Jeff’s room. Amy herself lies on her bed, her hands behind her head, waiting for the chicken to do its “job”.<br />
<br />
Jeff is crouching in front of his Playstation, preparing to load a game, his back is turned to his open door, so he does not notice the headless chicken body entering his room, slowly wobbeling up to him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the large chicken body lunges at Jeff, knocking him over onto floor, “WHAT THE FUCK,” Jeff shouts. The 16 year-old tries to turn his head to look what has him pinned down, but whatever it is seems to have tremendous strength. Jeff feels something starting tug on his shirt, “WHO’S THERE,” the boy shouts, “LET… LET ME GO,” starting to struggle, trying to break free.<br />
<br />
The chicken has Jeff’s head pinned to the ground with one of its fleshy wing stumps, while a leg stump is wrapped around Jeff’s ankles, causing Jeff to be unable to move, as it starts to tug at the boy’s shirt with its free wing stump.<br />
<br />
Jeff suddenly hears his shirt tearing and soon his shirt is ripped off of his body, leaving him topless, what ever is forcefully stripping him then starts to tug at his pants, which are just a pair of cotton jogging pants. The teen feels his pants being pulled down his legs, along with his boxer briefs, soon Jeff is completely naked.<br />
<br />
The chicken’s body then moves into position until the hole, where once the chicken’s head had been, is directly by Jeff’s feet.<br />
<br />
Still unable to move, Jeff feels his toes, followed by his feet, seeming to enter something cold and leathery, what ever it is then starts to move up his body, his legs slipping further into the strange thing, “am I being eaten,” Jeff asks himself in horror, “it… it feels that way, if only I could move!”<br />
<br />
As the… thing… continues to swallow his body, Jeff feels his legs slips into, what he would describe as “freezing pantlegs”, which have “socks” attached to them. Jeff shivers as his hips are swallowed next, it feels as if his entire lower body, including his flaccid cock, are dipped ice-water. Jeff’s teeth start to clatter together from the cold as his body continues to be swallowed, “pl-please,” Jeff begs, “ple-please… s-someone… help me!”<br />
<br />
The chicken body by now has reached Jeff’s chest, the body causes Jeff to be unable to move, the boy has no control over his body parts which have been swallowed up.<br />
<br />
Jeff feels the pressure on his head subside, as what ever it was that had his head pinned seem to let go. His relief is short lived however, as something grabs his left wrist, bending it forcefully and forces it into, what feels like a sleeve with a thumbless mitten attached to it. Jeff turns his head and his eyes widen in horror when he finds himself inside a huge body of a frozen chicken, “WHAT THE FUCK!?”<br />
<br />
The teen, using his still free arm, grabs the “collar” of the body and tries to pull himself free, but suddenly the wing stump, which has swallowed his arm, grabs Jeff’s free arm and twists it, causing the boy to yell out in pain as his arm is forced into the second wing stump, with that Jeff is fully “eaten” by the chicken body, only his head remains.<br />
<br />
Jeff tries to get up, but to his horror he seems to have no control over his body from the neck down.<br />
<br />
A strange sensation then starts to creep over his body, it feels as if the skin of the chicken is melting to his body. As it does, Jeff feels his body hollow out, his muscles, organs, bones, everything seems to vanish, leaving behind an empty void. To Jeff’s surprise, even without his organs, he seems to be still alive, “what the fuck is going on,” he asks himself.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Jeff feels the body… HIS body start to shrink. Jeff watches as his room becomes larger. When his body has reached a normal size for a frozen chicken, Jeff feels his head continue to shrink into the body, with a “pop” his head vanishes, but for some odd reason, Jeff is still able to hear, smell, feel and see, as if his senses have been absorbed into the chicken’s skin.<br />
<br />
Jeff tries to call out but realizes that he has lost his ability to speak, he then hears footsteps approaching him and someone picking him up.<br />
<br />
The former teen mentally widens his eyes when he finds himself staring back at the evil grin of his sister Amy.<br />
<br />
“Hello Jeff,” the little girl says, “I must say, this worked better than I hoped! Hehe… oh, you’ll be sooooo tasty! I can’t wait for you to be coocked!”<br />
<br />
‘WHAT,’ Jeff shouts mentally.<br />
<br />
Amy grins, able to hear Jeff’s thoughts, she then explains everything to him, “so you see, dear brother,” the girl says, after explaining Jeff his fate, “that is why I decided to get rid of you and Josh! Hehe… Josh can call himself “lucky” that he is just my outfit, you on the other hand, I decided to have you suffer more. Hehe… mom and dad will never know what has happened to you and Josh, they will enjoy the “chicken” and I will get all the attention I deserve!”<br />
<br />
Jeff is dumbfounded, how could no one notice Amy’s mental issue?<br />
<br />
Amy walks out of Jeff’s room, carrying the frozen chicken, the little girl laughing as she carries the “chicken” into the kitchen, lying it on the counter, “now, be a good little chicken and stay put, hehe… I know you will, because you have no control over your new body.”<br />
<br />
‘F-fuck you, Amy,’ Jeff thinks to himself, ‘you… you’ll never get away with this!’<br />
<br />
Amy simply smirks, “oh, I WILL get away with this, because no one will ever have a clue,” she says, “oh, by the way: you will not die! I have great plans for you, my dear brother! But THAT will stay my little surprise, maybe you will figure it out by yourself sooner or later. Ah… I think I hear mom… hehe… I can’t wait to stuff your body with yummy stuffing! Hehe… try to enjoy yourself!”</p>
