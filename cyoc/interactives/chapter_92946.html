<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It seem like Chad had to wait for hours for the team to finish practice and hit the showers. What had only been a matter of minutes is eternity to a human plastic bottle. But when they came, it was like an invasion. The 16 showerheads in the shower room quickly had a muscled stud at each one of them. The Bears from the line huddled around at one end, like the heard that they were. The muscled and ripped defensive backs broke through them to get at the heads that had the best hot water. The running backs chiseled and swiveled  their way through all of that, trying a play out to see if they could get to the shower gel first. They all started to realize there&#39;s only one bottle of shower gel for today – and Chad knew this time was up. <br />
Hot naked sweaty bodies started wrestling for the one bottle, trying to gain control. Chad&#39;s plastic skin got wet and slick and kept slipping out of well-muscled hands. The running back&#39;s would grab him, tuck Chad in their sweaty armpits, and try to get away; only to be cornered and surrounded by the defensive line. Chad wondered how the force of the battle didn&#39;t squeeze his head open and spill his guts. He got stripped out of their strong arms and landed in the hands of the center. Gus hiked him up hard between his butt cheeks so that the other offensive line could receive him. The lean muscled back-up quarterback, Steve, snatched Chad up and did a couple of pumpfakes that made Chad really dizzy. Steve spiraled Chad across the room into the hands of a waiting receiver, who then tucked him into a sweaty armpit.<br />
Coach Sinclair sticks his head in to the shower and said, &quot;Enough of this horseplay, you idiots! I don&#39;t have all night – finish up so that I can lock up.&quot; The receiver that currently had Chad flipped his head back and squeezed his stomach. Chad could feel himself vomiting up his heart and his lungs that were now just shower gel.<br />
The receiver lathered up his lithe body, stroking his chiseled chest and six pack abs. He then rubbed the Chad lather down the rest of his body into sweaty balls and down his chisel legs. Chad can somewhat feel his gel turning into the suds and getting more diffuse, it&#39;s spreading down all over the muscle stud. He could also feel of the bubbles breaking up in the rinse water and slowly dissolving into nothing as he ran down the drain.<br />
<br />
The receiver snaps his head back into the closed position and tossed them over to the third string quarterback, Matt. Matt grabs his head and opens it back up ( Chad thinks, &quot; I don&#39;t think he ever used to that feeling&quot;) and liberally squirted Chad&#39;s whole gellified digestive system out on his strong hands and  lathered it up. He rubbed the gel lather all over his thick pecs, musky  armpits, down his muscle arms, and in every crevice imaginable. He took that lather and twiddled his balls until they no longer stunk, and up and down his shaft to remove all the funk that it gathered during practice. He didn&#39;t close Chad&#39;s head back up and pulled back to throw it across the room to the second receiver. He let Chad fly in a sloppy spiral. But his hands were slippery from Chad&#39;s gelled insides, and he flew recklessly through the air. The second string receiver missed, and Chad crashed against the wall. One of his jaw hinges cracked loose; his head started to wobble loosely it in its socket. <br />
&quot;Damn Matt!&quot; Chad thought. &quot;That proves you&#39;re still no replacement for me.&quot; <br />
&quot;Did you book the bottle? Gus asked. &quot;We need to use it up before it drys out&quot;. They start fighting for the Chad shower gel. <br />
&quot;Get it&quot; The defensive back said. They tackled the receiver, but slipped on the wet shower and fell to the bottom of the floor and a wet mess. So wrestle for it!<br />
The dudes cracked Chad&#39;s jaw open again, squirted the rest of him all over their bodies, and then proceeded to wrestle. They tried to pin each other to the wet shower floor. Their bodies slid each over with the gel making it very hard to get a grip. Finally the tailback, Jeff, grab Gus&#39; balls real hard. This startled Gus, which caused him to lose his grip. <br />
&quot;Dude – get your hand off my balls- unless you plan to follow up!&quot;<br />
Jeff remarked, &quot;I think you&#39;re starting to like it...&quot;<br />
&quot;Shut it, asshole!&quot; Gus retorted.<br />
 Coach stuck his head in again and shouted at the players,&quot;Finish this shit up now! Or I&#39;m gonna make you wrestle nude in the middle the field in front of the whole school.&quot;<br />
At this point, it wasn&#39;t much left in Chad. All of his insides and limbs had been drained out and used on the players. He got tossed to the offensive linemen, who proceeded to pound him between their massive bellies to squish out the last little bit. This cracked his plastic, and started leave white marks in the skin.<br />
<br />
Most of the players had left, leaving just Jeff and Gus. Gus looks coyly at Jeff and says &quot;Finally alone- are you going to finish what you started? Wash me out and fill me up, dude!&quot; <br />
Chad knew Gus enjoyed his hands on Gus&#39; ass a little too much when hiking the ball, but didn&#39;t know that he acted on it. Much less that it was Jeff that was satisfying him.<br />
Jeff grabs Chad&#39;s head and yanks hard. Chad screamed silently to the neck pain as his head starts to strip its threads. Jeff realized he was stripping the threads, thus started to unscrew Chad&#39;s head. Chad wondered what would happen to him if his head came off his body. Well- he&#39;s about to find out. Jeff unscrewed Chad&#39;s head completely off,and start to fill his body back up with water. Jeff jammed his head back on, and ratcheted his head open. Jeff shoved Chad up Gus&#39; crotch, and squeezed Chad&#39;s body as hard as he could. Chad spit the water that was inside him all up into Gus&#39; taint, his anus, and up in between his balls and legs. After He emptied him out, Jeff tossed Chad hard at the wall; he  ricochet off and rolled under Gus. Jeff then started lathering up Gus&#39; balls and backside.<br />
Gus said, &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re quite done with that. Come on Jeff, give it to me- I laid a huge shit before practice; you don&#39;t want up in that.&quot; Jeff went and retrieved Chad, and approached Gus from behind as he was bending over. Jeff smeared what was left of Chad&#39;s body gel all over the top of Chad&#39;s head and the upper part of his round bottle. Gus bent over into his football tackle stance, waiting for Jeff. Jeff shoved Chad&#39;s bottle head into Gus&#39; rosebud, and wiggled it around. Chad discovered that he still had some sense of taste and smell, and being stuck up Gus&#39; ass was causing him to gag. That was a side of Gus he hoped he would never have seen.<br />
Just then, Jeff squeezed Chads bottle body. Chad spurted a water and suds mixture deep into Gus. Gus moans in satisfaction.<br />
&quot;Again!&quot; Shouts Gus.<br />
Jeff yanks off Chads bottle head off, refills him with water, and jambs his head back on. He jambs chad back up Gus&#39; ass and squeezes again. This time, the water pressure force is too much for chad&#39;s stripped threads on his bottle neck. Chads head pops off and gets blown up Gus ass and gets stuck. <br />
Chad screams as he is stuck in a hot stinky Colon of Gus. He realizes that  after this, there is no way he will get back on his body. The longer he is detached from it, the fainter his feeling of it fades. If he could still be sick, the pressure, smell, and &quot;rumbling&quot; deep within Gus would have made him retch.<br />
As Jeff pulls out, he realizes the cap is missing. &quot;Dude- The cap came off in you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you kidding me?&quot; Get it out! Get it out!&quot;<br />
Jeff jambs his finger up In Gus and feels around. He can&#39;t feel it. <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just go in after it.&quot; <br />
Jeff&#39;s been enjoying the prep too; his 7&quot;cock is hard and ready. He plows into Gus with such force that it nearly knocks him over. Jeff pumps in and out, nearly taking him over the edge.<br />
Before Chad can fully freak out,  something bats him around. Jeff&#39;s cock starts hitting him deep up in Gus. The repeated force spins him around until his neck is pointing right toward the tip. On Jeffs next thrust, it catches Chad&#39;s neck. Jeff wails in pleasure; and thrusts harder. Now Chad&#39;s head is thrusting really fast through Gus. The additional friction caused by Chads head puts Gus&#39; prostrate into overdrive. Both men are pushed over the edge and blow their load. The force of Jeff&#39;s cum unhinges chads jaw and it shoots deeper than ever. <br />
As Jeff pulls out, chads head is stuck on his tip. He reaches down to take it off, but then decides to leave it there. Gus turns around and starts to stroke Jeff&#39;s cock.<br />
As Gus studies the cock cap, he says, &quot;Do you realize that the cap looks like it has Chads face on it?&quot;</p>
