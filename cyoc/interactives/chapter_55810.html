<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Opening the door, Kai was immediately greeted by Stacy, who gave a kiss by way of greeting and then explained, &quot;Linda will be in, in a moment. Right now she is outside talking with her brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Remembering what a little bore Danny could be, Kai looked out the front door, saw her friend talking with her nine year old brother and looking back at Stacy, who had taken a seat on the couch in the living room, she asked, &quot;Why is Danny coming over? I thought it was just going to be us three this weekend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I want to teach Danny a lesson about girls and why being a proper little prig and a bit of a bore around them is wrong,&quot; a voice announced and turning, Kai watched as Linda led her brother inside.<br />
<br />
Closing the door, Linda handed her brother a shirt that had a denim torso section, pink cotton sleeves with purple and yellow hearts on it, a matching hood and two pink, heart shaped pockets on the front, also with the same hearts and made of the same cotton material. Next she handed him a skirt that Kai saw would extend full length, was made of denim, except for about a quarter of the skirt that would go from about waist to crotch and was made of the same pink, cotton material and had the same purple and yellow hearts on it.<br />
<br />
As she handed him a pair of white tights with faded pink hearts on them, Linda told Danny, &quot;The bathroom is up the stairs and on your left. Make sure you actually look like a girl or I am telling mom what you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Watching Danny go upstairs, Kai turned back to Linda and asked, &quot;So what did he do this time? And where did you get that outfit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Grinning, Linda casually replied, &quot;I knicked it from the high-school lost and found. Which I assume, the outfit was only there because the theatre department dumped it there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, she explained, &quot;And as for what he did this time, well it'll take too long to explain, but let’s just leave it at that he said rather rude things about girls and trashed my room, which is why Stacy and I are late.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, Kai asked, &quot;So, have you had anything for dinner yet?&quot; and started making her way toward the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Upstairs, Danny grumbled to himself how stupid his sister was behaving and wondering how it was that he could get out of dressing in girl's clothes. Looking at the outfit, Danny thought it looked absolutely ridiculous and would rather take the punishment their mum would dish out rather than wear such clothes.<br />
<br />
And then he thought of what their dad would do and how actually their mother would side with him in whatever punishment he was given.<br />
<br />
Shuddering, not liking to think what that might be, Danny located the bathroom and let himself in, disgusted by how pink, frilly and feminine the room looked. Turning, he peered into the bathroom mirror, taking in the nine year old boy reflected back.<br />
<br />
After a moment, he slowly undressed, hating to turn around and look at his nude self in the mirror. Picking up the tights, taking in the fact that there was an oval section in the crotch and wondering what it was for, Danny shrugged and sitting down on the toilet, he began to pull the tights on, hating the way they hugged his body.<br />
<br />
Standing back up, looking in the mirror, Danny took in the bulge in the front of the tights and shaking his head, remembering how his sister, who was two years older than him, looked in her swimsuit, he reached down into the tights and after bit of fiddling about, he tucked his penis and testicles back, hating even more what he was doing just to make Linda happy.<br />
<br />
Picking up the skirt, Danny peered at it, hesitant to actually put it on. Telling himself, &quot;There is no way this could fit me,&quot; as he gently pulled on the elastic waistband.<br />
<br />
Shuddering, he hesitated a couple more minutes and then slowly pulled the skirt on, adjusting it a bit, hating it even more that he was wearing girl's clothing and that the article he had just put on hugged the area from waist to crotch, accenting the fact the space was supposed to be flat.<br />
<br />
Grumbling about how unfair this was, thinking, &quot;The sooner I do this, the sooner it is over with,&quot; Danny grabbed the shirt and pulled it on.<br />
<br />
Confused because the buttons where on the wrong side, he spent the next couple of minutes slowly button up the button-down.<br />
<br />
Finished, he looked into the mirror, hating how much of a girl the dress, tights and shirt made him look. Mumbling, &quot;These clothes even make me look shorter,&quot; he took in how it looked like his height was only three foot seven instead of his normal four foot two.<br />
<br />
Shifting about, unaware that the magick in the clothes was changing more than his height, but also decreasing his age by two years and shifting everything from the neck down, except his penis and testicles, to something more appropriately feminine, Danny hugged himself in the same fashion a girl would, clicked off the light and exited the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Downstairs he was immediately greeted by comments of how cute and adorable he looked. Embarrassed, he pulled the hood up...which started changing his hair to a brownish-blonde and growing it out so that it hung just past his shoulders and looked more like a girl's...and sitting down at the table, asked, &quot;How long do I have to stay dressed up like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Linda grinned and looking at Kai, she responded, &quot;Well. The girls and I were talking. And after seeing how adorable you look, we decided that you will spend the evening with us. Dressed like you are. Next you will spend the night with us. Kai said she'll loan you a pair of pyjamas. And then tomorrow, you will join us, dressed in the very clothes you are wearing right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Groaning, Danny laid his head down on the table and seeing how he was acting, Linda commented, &quot;Unless you would rather I call mum and dad and tell them how you are acting?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, Danny looked at his sister and then at Kai and Stacy and after bit, replied, &quot;Fine. Let's get this over with. What do girls do at a slumber party?&quot; as he shifted in his seat, thinking that the skirt and shirt felt a little bit looser then when he had put them on.</p>
