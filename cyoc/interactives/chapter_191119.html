<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Holy fuuuuuuuck...&quot;<br />
<br />
Max stood in front of the bathroom mirror, clearly at awe of what he saw in it. And why shouldn&#39;t he be? He&#39;d gone to bed still feeling rather sick, but awoke feeling more well and capable than he&#39;d ever felt before. When Max looked in the mirror he saw his chest looking more solid, massive, and strong than it ever had before. Much better shape too, just...so much better. Whereas before he&#39;d have guessed his shoulders might be his highlight muscle group, now it was unquestionably his chest.<br />
<br />
Though it wasn&#39;t like his shoulders had lagged behind. &quot;Mm, fuck,&quot; Max said with a grin. His shoulders were now broader, stronger, each part more delineated and visible. A clap on each with a stronger, larger and more brutish hand led Max to feel a stirring in his crotch. He looked down and saw his abs - etched more tightly and with the full six pack visible, whereas before he was more brawny than anything, having to really flex to see his abs. Now? Now Max could see the full musculature there.<br />
<br />
When Max groped at his crotch and butt, he gasped when he felt renewed sensitivity in his ass.<br />
<br />
His ass! It too was larger and stronger, almost distractingly so. It poorly fit in his pajamas, almost to the point of tearing them. He looked further, and saw his quads - massive and jutting, his thighs competing for space in his pants. &quot;Mmf...&quot; Max grunted and took off his pants, seeing his manhood straining his boxer shorts. He started flexing his legs and quickly noticed it seemed his arousal was wetter and more noticeable than before.<br />
<br />
A large bead of precum dripped through his boxers and landed on the linoleum floor in front of him. Max flexed, and shivered as he registered the arousal yet again. Fuck but today he was seeming sensitive. He started to wonder if Liam went on this stuff at all yet. He&#39;d have to recommend it. Fuck he felt good today - a great contrast to how he had felt yesterday. Twisting and turning for his hungry and eager reflection, Max enjoyed the new way his body looked.<br />
<br />
He felt so much stronger...and so much hornier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck...I&#39;m in the mood to fuck,&quot; He bit a slightly longer nail, not even pondering it, thinking about his girlfriend Trisha, who he already intended on having a date with pretty soon. But now he was thinking a night out would probably become a night in. &quot;Heh, night in...&quot; But as Max contemplated all the various sexy things he and Trisha might do, he found himself getting even more insurgently aroused. He couldn&#39;t well just leave it like this.<br />
<br />
Or it would outright soak his boxers!<br />
<br />
Max gulped, and hoped that Liam would not be awake to see or hear how desperately aroused he was. He gingerly closed the door, careful not to make any excess noise, locking it in short order. Then, propping himself up in front of the mirror and flexing his free arm, he pushed his boxers down to begin jerking off. When he did, his wet cock smacked against his stomach, and he grinned despite how odd it seemed. His cock was every bit as big as it usually was, but it seemed to be releasing much more precum than usual.<br />
<br />
As he wrapped a hand around it, Max almost jerked in place, and had to stop himself from falling backward. FUCK but this was vastly more sensitive! <br />
<br />
He started slowly pumping it from the head to the base, gulping and choking down a moan. Max didn&#39;t consider himself exactly a moaner when it came to sex or masturbation. He would grunt occasionally, and let out a quick gasp when he came. But today he seemed extra animate - every time he went up to down or back, he would find himself uniquely tempted to moan, groan, or let out these oversexed noises. He managed to choke it down yes, but the fact was he had never felt this good before just touching himself.<br />
<br />
Max pondered this as he fought off another buckling feeling in his thighs, &quot;Fuck...fuck...what&#39;s happening to my sensitivity? It&#39;s off the scales...!&quot;<br />
<br />
Increasingly, as Max jerked off, he became less and less capable of completely choking down the moans and groans. He even found himself licking at the air as he eventually knelt down on his knees and jerked his dick. Pumping it into his tight, waiting hand as if it was the wet, inviting snatch of his girlfriend. &quot;Ohh fuckin&#39; A, Yes!!&quot; Max gasped, feeling something new to him. He was feeling so good in the moment that his ass clenched, flexing tight. A new sensation to be sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh fuck, fuck fuck fuck!! Fucking yes...&quot; He couldn&#39;t keep so quiet as orgasm started to approach. And what a cum it was shaping up to be. It seemed to be coursing through his entire body as opposed to just his cock. Muscles twitching and tensing, his jaw clenching tight and his eyes screwing shut from the sheer intensity - ohh this was so much better than it had any right to be... Max gasped, and gripped a nearby towel to absorb his load.<br />
<br />
The load that emitted was heavy, hot, and desperate. He felt himself pump his hips several times into the towel, finally letting out his loudest moan yet as one last rope came out toward the end. A heavier, hotter orgasm than he&#39;d ever had before. Max consciously thought about how if Liam wasn&#39;t awake yet, he surely would be now. The jock got back up and pondered. Considering how fucking good that felt, what would a second dose do for him...?<br />
<br />
Just the thought of being even bigger, even stronger, and getting another really good cum like that made him smile and lazily rub at his cock again, which twitched slightly. &quot;Fucking hell, I wonder how long it&#39;ll take you, buddy,&quot; he looked down at his organ, &quot;To get back up? You&#39;re feeling so much better today...&quot; He did have that idea for his girlfriend to come over and help him out, after all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey big guy,&quot; oh, fuck, there was Liam, &quot;Can&#39;t help but notice it seems you&#39;ve had a really fun time this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max responded, &quot;Oh, yeah, I felt great and I looked great too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Care to show me?&quot; Liam said through the door with a teasing tone to his voice.<br />
<br />
Max...</p>
