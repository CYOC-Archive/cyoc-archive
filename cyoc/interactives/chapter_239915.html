<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The pair activated the template application and to everyone&#39;s surprise, it showed Jeff is remaining Jeff and on the other hand, Jeff is being turned into Mike. The pair shared an uncomfortable glance as the time counted down. It was already 9pm so the transformation won&#39;t complete until 11.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did we make the transformation so slow?&quot;<br />
&quot;Because one of us is saying goodbye to childhood, and that deserves at least a little ceremony. Even if one of us hits 18 and regresses the other. I wouldn&#39;t turn you back into a minor, I&#39;d make you my older brother and keep you at least 21.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be ready to let go of my dad until I&#39;m in my 30s, and at that point, I wouldn&#39;t hate the idea of turning you into my little brother at 26 or something like that. But I&#39;d have to talk it over with you because by that point I&#39;m hoping you&#39;d be a grandpa and I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d want to give that up.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oof, well if you&#39;re discussing it with me, make sure you tell me how we got to where we are now.&quot;<br />
&quot;And whoever becomes dad might be able to start a completely new life and build a new family in the next two years. Mid thirties is still widely considered family starting age. But I haven&#39;t had anything to eat since noon and I&#39;m starving, for obvious reasons, I&#39;d prefer we go downstairs together.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair went downstairs and were already able to see some of the household items had shifted. The new reality with Mike having a kid at 18 made early adulthood a tremendous struggle but he worked hard to make financial stability and time for Jeff. Mike invested in real estate while still living at home with his parents and going to school. He knew that if he didn&#39;t sacrifice his comfort to build his income streams and ensure he had options, he&#39;d be just scraping by for years to come. That was just part of their new family history, it didn&#39;t mean he was turning into Mike.<br />
<br />
Entering the kitchen Jeff looked in the fridge and came out with a chicken and rice casserole that didn&#39;t exist previously and a couple beers. &quot;Figure this will be special for one of us, and for the other, it will be the ringing in of a ton of new rights.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Jeffs sat at the table having grabbed forks and began digging in to the cold casserole directly. &quot;So, I think you might be turning into dad. You have like that whole perma-shadow going on. Its pretty intense.&quot;<br />
Jeff touched his face confirming sandpapery stubble. &quot;Huh, you do too. We changed dad quite a bit and heredity is a thing. However, I think its only fair to warn you, you&#39;re looking more buff, and we set dad up to have a build like an athlete.&quot;<br />
The other Jeff flexed and both were surprised by how much they had changed without notice, &quot;We made him naturally muscular, not needing to try too hard. Meaning its genetic, so it shouldn&#39;t surprise you to know you&#39;re also looking more muscular.&quot;<br />
Jeff took a swig of his beer and let out a belch giving the other Jeff a big grin, &quot;Well if I am dad, you&#39;d better finish your beer before I yell at you for stealing it.&quot; He glanced at the clock, &quot;We&#39;re only a quarter of the transformation in but whoever is dad will have a lot to learn and a lot to forget, so mental changes should start soon. You like the taste of coffee yet?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ha! We made dad pretty laid back, so long as we aren&#39;t arrested and aren&#39;t interrupting his date nights, I doubt he&#39;ll care too much, but no, I don&#39;t like coffee. I&#39;m having fun with this but if you really want to know who&#39;s becoming Dad, we could just hop on the scale to compare weights, or check our drivers licenses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d rather not... I don&#39;t really want to know if it is me. Nothing else seems important enough to talk about though and I can&#39;t get my mind off it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, let&#39;s watch TV then.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair put away their forks, returned the remaining casserole to the fridge, and threw away their beer cans. The living room didn&#39;t smell of spilt beer, nor the cleaning supplies Jeff used. The dent in the doorframe and wall had been erased by the reality shift. The tv turned on and a raunchy cartoon was found that they could both enjoy.<br />
<br />
When the show was over, Mike asked Jeff if he would mind if Mike checked the news at 10 to get a recap of the game that was on earlier today. Jeff gave a sad smile, &quot;Sure thing dad,&quot; as he passed over the remote. &quot;Actually its 10, I&#39;m going to start heading to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike paused for a minute, &quot;Jeff, I feel like I&#39;m forgetting something important.&quot;<br />
Jeff grimaced not wanting to make the rest of the transition any harder than it had to be. &quot;Garbage day? A bill? Upcoming Dr visit?&quot;<br />
Mike focused hard for a moment before shaking his head. &quot;The feeling passed. Hey, thanks for hanging out with me.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure thing, love you dad!&quot; Jeff turned suddenly slammed with the full emotional weight of everything.<br />
<br />
His real dad was erased. He just watched &#39;himself&#39; forced to turn into a replacement father figure against his will. That man was nothing like his original dad and their tinkering ensured he had the personality closer to a college frat guy than a middle aged dad of a teen. To top it all off, Jeff is the only one who recalls any of it. Reaching the bathroom, he flipped on the light and saw himself for the first time.<br />
<br />
His formerly average build was now muscular, and he certainly did get his dad&#39;s facial hair. The weak mustache and sideburns he had been able to grow were replaced with beard shadow. His new memories told him he had started to get confused for a short senior, though it was his sophomore year.<br />
<br />
He looked exactly like a shorter, weaker version of his dad, though of course he did, they hadn&#39;t bothered to change any of Mike&#39;s physical characteristics.<br />
<br />
Jeff got to his room, HIS room! The victory was bittersweet as he collapsed to his bed and mourned the loss of an entire reality.</p>
