<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morgan was very unnerved and embarrassed by many of the things that had gone on since her conversion. Being tricked into becoming a Desert Cottontail Rabbit Animalian, rather than a Fennec Fox Animalian was the starting point and one of them. Partially because it included part of her own plans at getting back at Lars and being able to stand by her claims that he wasn&#39;t that good in bed. That by becoming a Fennec Fox Animalian, that Lars would try to come back to her, and she could reject him showing her point of view and victory. She figured it would also make Lars come off as shallow to Nicole, which would be doubly sweat.<br />
<br />
She lost that chance after becoming a Rabbit Animalian and then had the various conditions that had to be met for the employment that she&#39;d agreed to. Though that was soon made worse by the fact that she expected something a bit more &quot;executive&quot; or at least &quot;clerical&quot; in nature, only to find that she had signed a contract agreeing to be a servant. It let Joanne use Morgan for various odd jobs or even &quot;loaning&quot; her for other roles, which Morgan didn&#39;t like, but she could escape from. And a part of her had to admit that she kind of liked serving drinks and things at the Meat Market, as when they were short servers, she&#39;d found that even the servers got some attention from the guests, particularly if they were Animalians.<br />
<br />
The most embarrassing things though were the punishments she&#39;d had to endure, all of which seemed to cycle back to either things she&#39;d done in the past or provided some means of embarrassment. The wet-tee shirt contest at Heiya Island that Nicole and Joanne roped her into. Then there was babysitting members of the Piper clan for &quot;Mother&#39;s Day&quot; and dealing with all of them as a sort of reminder on how she&#39;d effectively left Lars to raise Philip on his own and only coming back when there seemed to be something she could financially gain from it. Then there were the Memorial Day conversions of those Army Rangers or Marines, Morgan couldn&#39;t be sure which, while thinking she was under the influence of an aphrodisiac. It highlighted that as an Animalian, her own natural libido was higher than it was before and provided a reminder as she converted those men into male Desert Cottontails that she might not even get a lot of action from them again either... as the conversion was part of a deal for Memorial Day and might not show interest in her. The thing that was most embarrassing was a private part of her actually wouldn&#39;t have minded seeing more of them, but that wasn&#39;t likely.<br />
<br />
Then came the jokes that Animalia Ambassadoria decided to pull, and which she wanted to file charges for abuse on. She didn&#39;t have any great interest in participating in the Year of the Rabbit competition next year and was just looking for some way to blow off steam from her third punishment. The aerobics class was helpful but far more vigorous than what Morgan expected, and despite gaining greater health and stamina than she had as a Human, it was more than she could handle. Animalia Ambassadoria somehow got a copy of the teacher&#39;s instructional video and proceeded to make fun of her in comparison to a younger white furred Rabbit woman on that basis. It only led to more laughs and things that were aimed at her that had nothing to do with her past behavior. Thus, it wasn&#39;t part of the punishments she&#39;d agreed to go through and was directly aimed at her. For the moment, though, she hadn&#39;t had time to find a lawyer that would review things and take the possible case.<br />
<br />
And some of that was the fact that she was now being brought into her fourth and final punishment, which was supposed to include providing entertainment at Philip and Lars&#39; bachelor party and was the changing room of the Meat Market getting ready with Nicole and Joanne also there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re so uneasy about,&quot; Nicole said pointedly as she adjusted the hot pants she was wearing as part of the costume.<br />
<br />
The theme for this party seemed to reflect either elements of Lars or Joanne&#39;s condition. It appeared that both had very moderate cases of Regressive Hypersexuality, which had brought out a lot of Lars&#39; old college behaviors, which Morgan remembered and at times when she saw it also reminded her in part of what initially drew her to him. In Joanne&#39;s case it had also loosened up a fair number of her inhibitions and while she had her private issues with Nicole working at the Meat Market, there were times when Joanne demonstrated she could be just as frisky. From the background, Morgan had the sense that this was in part what helped heal whatever disagreement the mother and daughter Fennec Fox Animalians had while also having some moments of unease because they were mother and daughter. Nicole was supposedly dressing up like some sexy college student, playing to Lars&#39; old college behaviors with a pair of bright red hot pants and a grey shirt with the word &quot;college&quot; written across the front that looked like it was almost a size too small and was stretched over Nicole&#39;s generous bosom.<br />
<br />
Joanne was wearing something that was more of a more risqué version of a CEO&#39;s outfit. There was no undershirt but just the suit jacket, which was open enough to give a rather open view of Joanne&#39;s cleavage and to parts of the cups of her bra under jacket. The jacket also only had one button and was buttoned just beneath Joanne&#39;s breasts and left the lower part open and giving Morgan a view of Joanne&#39;s belly button. She also wore a relatively short black skirt, which shook a little bit as Joanne waged her tail and left Morgan feeling uneasy as she looked at the two Fennec Fox Animalians. For the whole thing felt sort of like the first punishment in that Morgan was placed in a V-neck black dress that had the V going down beneath her belly button and she couldn&#39;t wear a bra. There were slits on either side of the legs that allowed for a great deal of movement, but also made her black panties visible to the naked eye as well and had included the idea that she was to go out and entertain Philip and Lars, and any guests that Lars had invited for the party before Joanne and Nicole came out to play their role, and what Morgan figured was to likely also include seducing their future husbands.<br />
<br />
And for a time, Morgan had some private ideas about tempting Lars back, but at present that wasn&#39;t a possibility. Even as a physically desirable Rabbit Animalian, and of comparable height and weight to Nicole and Joanne, things like Animalia&#39;s edicts made the finer points of Morgan&#39;s original plans impossible. And at the same time, she also knew that she and Philip were biologically related and tempting her ex-husband was one thing, but her son was another. And in the course of her work for Joanne and her staff, she&#39;d also seen enough that seemed to indicate that Lars and Nicole, and Philip and Joanne, had the sort of firm relationship that she also had to feel that even if she and Philip weren&#39;t related, her plans wouldn&#39;t have worked. Not to mention that she really didn&#39;t want to be in a position where she was having to play the role of a stripper. Yes, she didn&#39;t mind serving drinks and she didn&#39;t mind drawing some attention. But that didn&#39;t mean that she wanted to be a stripper.<br />
<br />
&quot;As didn&#39;t you WANT to have Lars&#39; attention when you learned he was a striking and well-muscled male Fennec Fox?&quot; Nicole then asked, &quot;now&#39;s your absolute last chance to show him you have what it takes. After all... you turned out to be a very busty bunny, and I know there would be plenty of men and a fair number of women that would want to be with you physically. Some might even want to give it a try to get you to be a just an honest woman. Just as Lars is a good and honest man and a hard working man... even with his frat-boy quirks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And as Philip became a kind and intelligent son,&quot; Joanne added, &quot;someone that at a loving mother would be proud of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... well...&quot; Morgan began nervously before finishing, &quot;I&#39;ve never really wanted to get into stripping...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve gotten good reports when the Meat Market has needed an extra server,&quot; Joanne commented, &quot;along with some smile at the attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s different from stripping though...&quot; Morgan said nervously, &quot;and in that... I&#39;m not much of a dancer... or one wanting to be in a position where I&#39;m not really in control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A good dancer is always in control,&quot; Nicole answered, &quot;people that come to clubs like this can get handsy... even some Animalians that come. But you still have control. You can say &quot;no&quot; at any time to unwanted attention... and to a great degree, most boys will be more interested in seeing our generous busts bounce and our generous hips sway. Ultimately, the &quot;how&quot; won&#39;t matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan didn&#39;t say anything and noted that Joanne was uneasy with anything that involved being around Nicole in the Meat Market and in conditions that would relate to how both were dressed. Though, some of that could be in relation to Morgan&#39;s punishment as there had been some reference made to tempting Lars, which had been part of her original plans. And as things had developed, some of that was beginning mean that it wasn&#39;t possible and that she never should have tried to get herself involved in any of it. There was still the fact that Philip was her biological son, and while she&#39;d never truly known Philip, that didn&#39;t mean she wanted to be in a role such as this. She was about to say when the door to the locker room opened, and Shyra stuck her head in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Shyra spoke, &quot;but I&#39;ve been instructed to let you know that the party is ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Nicole smiled while taking Morgan by an arm and then soon had Joanne taking her by the other arm, &quot;we&#39;re on our way out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan managed to walk along, but it was fairly clear that she wouldn&#39;t be able to avoid it. As they made it to the door, Morgan found that it was presently dark with only a few small running lights that ran along the stage. It was enough to let Morgan know that there were others there besides just Philip and Lars for the bachelor party. She was nervous for a moment and really just wanted to bolt for the door and hope that no one noticed her, if it was possible for an Animalian in clothing designed to attract attention to do so. However, she couldn&#39;t as Nicole and Joanna retained a grip on her. As they came out, a floodlight seemed to come on and Morgan found herself practically blinded by the light as she was lead up onto the stage by Nicole and Joanne. <br />
<br />
She heard some &quot;ohhs&quot; and other proverbial cat calls and was glad that for the purposes of this part no cameras or cellphones were allowed in as the last thing she wanted was for her to be associated with the Meat Market or what went on there with regard to actually stripping. Of course, the rule for that likely had more to do with Joanne&#39;s work in running a fashion company that did a lot of business with Animalia and various other groups in terms of design was something that her being ready to &quot;strip&quot; to arouse Philip and/or set the punishment for Morgan and set her to recognize just how wrong she&#39;d been. And when the main floodlight gone down, Morgan was then able to make better sight as to who was there and found that it was mostly a few Lars&#39; college friends who had become Animalians. A couple of Philip&#39;s friends were there, but Morgan only knew of that because they weren&#39;t Lars&#39;s friends.<br />
<br />
As Nicole and Joanne pulled apart from Morgan, she was able to note Philip and Lars were both there, seated together at the table closest to the stage. Philip looked half horrified as Morgan stood there trembling but was soon also stealing glances away to Joanne as she twirled and began to work at undoing the button that held the &quot;jacket&quot; she was wearing on. Lars gave a polite nod to her, which was a bit surprising. She half expected Lars to be smirking at her as though he were enjoying this punishment for her. As it would be part of a way for him to get even, with all of her plans going wrong and getting what essentially amounted to &quot;just punishments&quot; for perceived offenses come back to bite her while Lars would get action from a woman who was well younger than him, in terms of birth years. Though, this was also something that made her note that in being double dosed, she, Lars, and Joanne all looked and felt young again... like they were physically as old as Philip and Nicole.<br />
<br />
Lars then turned his head to Nicole and looked to her with more fascination and with more alert ears. There was also something in his eyes that also seemed to look fairly attentive to Nicole and captivated by her. It was a look that Morgan remembered back when she first started dating Lars and reminded her of how he did things to help her and trying to make her happy. She also noted how Nicole put her focus on Lars in a way that looked happy and playful. In ways it reminded Morgan of things from the past and things that she&#39;d lost. And in that was where something really began to sit in. Despite the fact that it was a bachelor party for Father&#39;s Day as Philip prepared to marry Joanne and Lars prepared to marry Nicole, the object of the punishment wasn&#39;t the embarrassment of being put in such revealing clothing before her son or in a position where she had no chance of tempting Lars.<br />
<br />
It was the realization that none of plans were ever going to work and that much of what she&#39;d lost was a result of what she&#39;d done in the past. She may not have been ready to a mother when she found she was pregnant with Philip and didn&#39;t like the fact that Lars was all for keeping Philip, but that didn&#39;t necessarily mean that Lars was a bad man or wouldn&#39;t have been there. He showed that in how he looked to Nicole and how Nicole looked back, and the fact that he and Philip looked to get along fine. It was something that often looked well on post cards, and despite all her earrings, it seemed to be something that Nicole wanted to... and Morgan had her chance at it but threw it away over greed and selfishness. As that hit her, Morgan soon realized that even if she hadn&#39;t been tricked by legalese into becoming a Desert Cottontail Rabbit Animalian and had become a Fennec Fox Animalian, she wouldn&#39;t have gained anything from that. Because she&#39;d already thrown all that away. And with that the cat calls from the other guests just fell away.<br />
<br />
As Nicole approached Lars, now down her shirt and panties and with Joanne sitting in Philip&#39;s lap in just her underwear, Morgan backed off from the stage and moved off to the stairs that she&#39;d initially been lead up. No one stopped her or possibly even noticed her, possibly because no one really held much attention in someone who was only nervously standing in one spot. It was like the cat calls were just the embarrassing part of the punishment and not the core part of the punishment . As she dashed through the door back to the Meat Market&#39;s locker room, only one thing went through her mind as she tried hard not to start bawling out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was dumb,&quot; Morgan thought to herself in a rather depressed manner and it only got worse when she heard Lars tell Nicole that he loved her.</p>
