<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drew got up out of the pool and ran up to his room to put away the scale, his newest most treasured possession. Once he was inside, Kendra finally built up her courage to ask Lisa something that&#39;d been bothering her. &quot;Hey Lisa, were you...ever approached by any scientists before you first transformed? Did anyone give you any...treatments or anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa&#39;s smile dropped, confusion taking over her face. &quot;What? Um...no? You mean drugs?&quot; <br />
<br />
Kendra shook her head, suddenly she didn&#39;t feel as sure about this. She watched Lisa&#39;s breasts float on the water before speaking again. &quot;No, not drugs. Like, experiments, or something. Something that might&#39;ve caused you to transform?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa pursed her lips, &quot;Honest Kendra, turning into a mermaid was completely random for me. What kind of science experiment would&#39;ve caused this? Why? Were you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendra nodded, &quot;There... There was an experiment.&quot; She was sharing too much. But she had to tell Lisa about this, it was too great of a coincidence that her neighbor was also an animal hybrid. &quot;Some geneticists were studying animal and human genetic similarities. They...they made me like this.&quot; Kendra finally admitted it, tears began to drip from her eyes.<br />
<br />
Lisa was wide-eyed, &quot;Kendra, that&#39;s horrible... So they turned you into a freak...Just to...Just to what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendra wiped her eyes, &quot;They never told me. They just said they&#39;d unlocked my true genetics. I&#39;d worked with them voluntarily but, after I learned it was permanent, I left the project.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa pushed herself through the water, closer to Kendra, she held her in a hug. &quot;That&#39;s awful Kendra. How did they do something like that? The science is... well it&#39;s impossible. Genetic splicing of that level is...science fiction.&quot; She may have been the cheer captain, but Lisa was going to college for a biology degree. She was smart.<br />
<br />
Kendra pulled herself into composure, letting the warmth of Lisa&#39;s body comfort her. She wracked her brain to remember what had happened, she knew Lisa would want to know the technical details. &quot;They were using a... They had some sort of... They...&quot; She stopped, her mind was blank. &quot;I don&#39;t remember.&quot; For the life of her, Kendra couldn&#39;t remember a single thing the scientists had done to her besides study her and give her the formulas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all? You don&#39;t remember what they gave you? Was it a surgery?&quot; Lisa was pouting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t remember them doing anything to me. I met with them to discuss the treatment, then I transformed... Or did I meet with them after I transformed.&quot; It was the most bizarre feeling. Her mind had always been so clear about what the scientists had done. She had volunteered for the project, they had given her a serum, then on her eighteenth birthday she turned into a freak. She was certain that was what happened. Yet now as she floated in this pool, breathing in Lisa&#39;s intoxicating scent, she wasn&#39;t sure anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kendra, is everything alright?&quot; Lisa asked, lifting Kendra&#39;s face. As soon as Kendra&#39;s eyes met Lisa&#39;s, Kendra pushed forward and pressed her lips against Lisa&#39;s pushing her into a deep and sensual kiss. Kendra&#39;s every nerve was on fire, her brain was running a million miles a minute. She had never experienced such a powerful kiss. <br />
<br />
Lisa was surprised at first, but she&#39;d be lying if she tried to deny any feelings for Kendra. Kendra was always the beautiful shy girl across the street, the one who never played with her anymore, never came over to hang out. Whenever she&#39;d gone to Kendra&#39;s house, Kendra had always been so dismissive. It drove Lisa wild, for years she&#39;d wanted Kendra so badly. Kendra had always thought it was a funny coincidence her and Lisa picked the same college. But Lisa knew, it was no coincidence.<br />
<br />
When Kendra had burst in on Lisa hiding in the pool, Lisa&#39;s hormones had flared up like wildfire, floating naked in the school pool with her secret on display, she hadn&#39;t known what to think, in that moment, her dreams would either come true, or be shattered forever. Then Kendra turned into a centaur. Kendra was just like Lisa, hiding an impossible secret just like her. Lisa hadn&#39;t realized at the time that her hormones flaring was causing her siren side to release intense pheromones, but now she saw clear as day what she had done to Kendra. <br />
<br />
Pushing herself through the shock, Lisa kissed back, she grabbed Kendra in her arms, and Kendra put her arms behind Lisa&#39;s back. Lisa wrapped her tail around Kendra&#39;s legs, entwining them in their passionate embrace. Her hormones were going wild, and her body began to produce even more intense pheromones. The kind that caused even the strongest sailors to leap to their deaths.<br />
<br />
As soon as Lisa kissed Kendra back, Kendra felt a fog over her mind clear away. Suddenly memories that she thought were real were no longer real at all. She pulled away from Lisa, gasping. Lisa let out a whine as the kiss ended. &quot;I wasn&#39;t transformed by the scientists!&quot; Kendra exclaimed. &quot;They had nothing to do with it! My parents took me to them after I had transformed, the scientists only wanted to study me. All they did was give me the formula to stay human. My memories were altered, to help me cope with what had happened! Lisa I remember it! I remember it all!&quot; She kissed Lisa again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kendra, what are you talking about?&quot; Lisa gasped. She was still enraptured by actually having kissed Kendra, she could barely comprehend Kendra&#39;s rambling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa the scientists didn&#39;t make me like this! They were just...&quot; She trailed off. Suddenly Kendra felt incredibly guilty, &quot;They were just trying to help me be normal again. They were just trying to help me... I&#39;ve hated them for so long...all they were doing was helping me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa furrowed her brow, &quot;But...If the scientists were just trying to help, why did they alter your memories?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because...because it wasn&#39;t the scientists...it was the higher ups.&quot; Realization dawned on her. &quot;The people in charge of the scientists. They wanted me to believe I was a result of some failed science project.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But...Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I don&#39;t know.&quot; Kendra admitted. The two girls stayed silent, not sure what to make of this.<br />
<br />
Drew came back outside, wading into the water. &quot;Sorry, I had to use the bathroom.&quot; He looked at both of the girls&#39; faces. &quot;Did...I miss something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You kissed me.&quot; Lisa finally said.<br />
<br />
Kendra blushed, &quot;I...I&#39;m sorry... Being around you was clearing my memory, I figured something more passionate might...make things clearer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Drew was startled, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, what? What exactly did I miss?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled, ignoring Drew she traced a finger along Kendra&#39;s bikini top. &quot;Do you know how long I&#39;ve been waiting for you to do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendra shuddered as Lisa&#39;s finger ran along her bikini, she was suddenly very nervous. &quot;Lisa I...&quot;</p>
