<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric Behr received two free passes to the zoo in the mail.  It is a special promotion through a little known pay site for people who are interested in bestiality.  Eric is one of the thousands of paying customers who enjoy the exotic visual delights offered by Beastly_Pleasures.com, so this comes as no surprise to the thirty-two year old man.  The pass reads: <br />
<br />
Admit One to Elysium Zoological Gardens<br />
As a Special Guest courtesy of<br />
Beastly_Pleasures.com<br />
Hours – 7p m to Dawn<br />
Friday May 1<br />
<br />
Hand written note in the envelope with the ticket reads: Elysium Zoological Gardens welcomes Mr. Eric Behr and Mr. Richard Noble for a night of wonders!<br />
<br />
Mr. Behr is a man who has always loved to work with his body and chose work in high-rise construction.  Eric builds the skyscrapers and makes good money doing it.  He comes from a tough breed of overtly masculine men and it shows.  Eric’s muscular form is only now starting to show the approach of middle age with a small beer belly.  His brown bearded face is weathered and tan and his body is very hairy from head to toe.  His hazel eyes reflect the wisdom gained from sixteen years of working in a highly dangerous environment.  Eric plays poker with the guys and whistles at the girls, but Eric secretly goes out of town every other weekend to meet with his other buddies at a Bear club, where Eric can be himself and is admired for his looks and fur.  The fact that he meets with his big bear of a boyfriend Richard also sweetens the weekends away.<br />
<br />
Eric fantasizes about making love to bears; both real and the gay subculture variety and in Richard, found a kindred spirit.  It was Richard who introduced Eric to the website one weekend and bought Eric a year’s subscription as an anniversary present.  Eric calls up his boyfriend and tells him about the tickets and Richard agrees to come down for the weekend next and go to the zoo for the special night.<br />
<br />
The two big men spend a wonderful evening in the zoo together and somewhere around three in the morning end up in front of the bear enclosure, after having visited it several times already.  It is not uncommon, the other guests have also wandered around and stopped in front of the animals they admire.  A young man and woman not too far away from the bears stare into the timber wolf exhibit.<br />
<br />
As Richard and Eric are quietly talking about getting back to Eric’s place and having a nice romp, a man in a business suit approaches the plaid and jean clad pair.  The man looks very much the same as the couple at the rail, except his beard is more closely trimmed and he appears to have less fat on his tall, broad frame.<br />
<br />
“Good morning Mr. Behr.”  Eric takes the man’s hand as it’s offered and grunts a ‘Good morning’.<br />
<br />
“…And to you too, Mr. Noble.”  The man shakes Richard’s hand too.  “My name is Edward Kimble and I’m a vet here at the zoo, specializing in the larger members of the order Carnivora, but my passion is for bears.”<br />
<br />
The two men exchange a knowing smile that Dr. Kemble seems to have missed or ignored.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, we kinda have a passion for bears too.”  Eric says with a grin.<br />
<br />
“Well yes, of course!  That is precisely why the two of you were invited here tonight.”<br />
<br />
“Oh?”  Richard said.<br />
<br />
“I was wondering if you two gentlemen might want to go down and visit with the bears, up close?”  Dr. Kemble says with a hint of a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
“Won’t we be mauled by those huge grizzlies?”  Eric says.<br />
<br />
“I can assure you, the grizzlies at our zoo are quite gentle and we care for them with the utmost kindness.  We even monitor the people who visit from hidden cameras to be sure that they don’t throw things that may injure our animals it is how I knew you were here and I could see the appreciation for the bears on your face as you looked into the habitat.”  Dr. Kemble says.<br />
<br />
“So we can go into the pen, without the need for tranquilizers or anything?”  Richard asks.<br />
<br />
“Yes, these bears are quite docile.”  Dr. Kemble says.<br />
<br />
“Well, you only live once and I’d rather die by the paw or fang of a grizzly than by falling seventy floors to the ground on the job.  Besides, it may be the only chance I ever get to be that close to a live grizzly bear.  I’m in!”  Eric says.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know about this.”  Richard says.<br />
<br />
“It will be fine, I promise.  The zoo wouldn’t allow me to do it if there were a chance that you would be injured.”  Dr. Kemble said with such confidence, that even Richard’s fears were salved.<br />
<br />
The three men went around the back of the display and Dr. Kemble led the way into the area were the bears sleep.  The first thing that Eric noticed was that there seemed to be a lack of barriers between the humans and the bears save for the locked gate at the entrance to the bear’s habitat.  Inside the communal ‘den’ shared by all the grizzlies, there were no pens.  Indeed, it almost seemed that the bears themselves had become almost social.  Eric and Richard saw them lying in groups and a couple mated, paying little heed to their human visitors.  Eric couldn’t help but raptly stare at the mating pair.  What he realized, after a moment, was that the pair was male; as evidenced by the receiving bear’s erect spewing cock.  After a short time, the two separated and engaged in cleaning each other’s cocks orally and then began to lick each other’s muzzles, tongues touching at first and then that evolved into a kind of French kissing.<br />
<br />
Eric and Richard were astounded and highly turned on.  Both men were very erect and indeed, had wet patches on their legs where both had been leaking pre come.  Both men couldn’t tear their eyes away from the mated pair during the whole exchange.  They had just witnessed some very unusual and complex behavior that they knew was not normal for two adult male grizzlies.<br />
<br />
“Are those two…”  Eric began.<br />
<br />
“Gay?”  Dr. Kemble finished.  “Why, yes, they are and I believe you know at least one of them personally.  Do you remember a fellow you used to work with named Rudy?”  Dr. Kemble asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, he worked with me on some of the buildings; older guy, but not frail.  He was a big grey bearded fucker who liked cigars.  He was in his sixties and he retired to the Bahamas.  Taught me everything I know about workin’ high steel.  He was built like a brick…”  Eric stopped, realizing he’d just said too much.<br />
<br />
He heard an odd chuckling like noise come from one of the bears and then his mate repeated the noise.  <br />
<br />
As if in on a joke, Dr. Kemble chuckled too, “It’s OK, Mr. Behr, your sexuality and that of your partner is safe with me and the bears.”  Mr. Kimble smiled.  “Rudy, would you come over here a minute, I believe Eric would like to run his fingers through your fur and get reacquainted with you.”<br />
<br />
With that, one of the mated pair grunted and rose to his four feet.  He ambled over to Eric, stopped directly in front of him and licked him on the nose.  Eric could smell the bear come on “Rudy’s” breath and it made his cock twinge.<br />
<br />
“Now, wait just a minute.  What’s goin’ on here?  How could this be Rudy?”  Eric asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, Mr. Behr, your friend Rudy here did retire and unbeknownst to you, he was hanging out at the bear bars.  We started disseminating the information slowly and to discreetly selected people.  Rudy sort of found out that we had perfected a method of changing a man into a bear; well actually, not just bears.  That’s what this whole night at the zoo with your bestiality Internet group is all about.  Anyway, a web site was set up and all of you who answered that you were interested in becoming the particular kind of beast you admire were invited here.  Rudy was one of our first volunteers.  He retains his complete personality and sexual orientation.”  Dr. Kemble said.<br />
<br />
“You mean Rudy was gay and a bear lover?”  Eric asked and there was a touch of some loss in his voice.<br />
<br />
The bear made another almost human sounding chuckle and nodded his head up and down.<br />
<br />
“Aw, Rudy, if I’d only had known.”  Eric said.<br />
<br />
The bear ambled over to Eric, stood on his hind legs and hugged Eric to his furry body.  Eric rubbed the bear’s furry sides and hugged Rudy back.  “I wish I had known.”  Eric said softly so that only Rudy could hear what he said.<br />
<br />
“So, you invited us here to change us into bears?  Don’t we get a say in the matter?”  Richard asked in an offended tone.<br />
<br />
“Of course you get a say in the matter, Mr. Noble.  It is completely your choice and that is exactly as we want it.  We don’t want people what are unhappy with what they become and as a matter of fact, there are a number of side benefits to the transformation and some monetary incentives as well.”  Dr. Kemble said.<br />
<br />
“Benefits?”  Eric said, as Rudy released his friend from the hug.<br />
<br />
“Yes, benefits.  When Rudy or any of the others here who wish to return to being human, become men and or women again, they will have found their human bodies regenerated.  When they revert back to their human form they will be completely healthy and rejuvenated.  Disease vanish and scars fade.  The process grows back healthy organs and somehow makes old cells new.  You return to a physical state somewhere in your early twenties.  We don’t quite understand how the regeneration and the rejuvenation happen yet, but it seems to have something to do with the reconstruction of the individual’s DNA.  We take a sample of your DNA before the transformation and cryogenically freeze it.  After the term of the contract is up, we use the same process that changed a human into an animal to change the animal you are back into the human you were.  Rudy the Bear here will become Rudy Addison in about a year or so, once we begin the process to change him back.  The great part about it is, he’s been living here for the last ten years rent free with all food paid for.  His prostate and lung cancer, which would have killed him a few months after he retired, are completely gone and were completely gone as soon as the last cancer cells changed to healthy bear cells.  All his money has been going into an account, our lawyers have set it up so that his retirement checks have been going to a bank in Switzerland, all appropriate taxes paid of course, and Rudy here gets paid to do beast parties.  He actually gets paid to have sex with bear groups.  After all, where do you think we get the pictures that we put on our exclusive, adult only, triple adult check, pay site?”  Dr. Kemble smiled.  <br />
<br />
“Some of the bear clubs have members that pay anywhere from one to three thousand dollars for each person for one night with our docile grizzlies and half of those earnings are guaranteed to go into Rudy’s already huge bank account.  Rudy will retire from what he feels is very pleasant work in about two years.  He’ll be a healthy man in his early twenties with ten million or so in his account and a nice estate house on top of that.  Further, he’s asked for some modifications to his human genetics for when he’s changed back; tweaking the human genes he left as a sample does this.  He has requested size increase adjustments to his genitals, an increase in his natural muscularity, height and he wants more hair on his body, face and head.  Rudy wants to be closer to looking like a twenty three year old bear with all the muscle and body hair that age brings a man; not that Rudy needed that.”  Dr. Kemble said the very last bit quietly and almost to himself.<br />
<br />
“Damn Rudy!  You’re gonna be one hot stud when you change back!”  Richard said. “Not that you aren’t now.”  He added quickly.<br />
<br />
“And you’re offering us the same deal?”  Eric said.<br />
<br />
“No, you can have a different deal if you like.  For instance, we do get couples that never want to be human again.  Some of the wealthier ones have even donated half of their estate to the Elysium Zoological and Botanical Society.  They usually choose to have no memory of who they were as humans and become animals completely.  Hence our choice for ‘Elysium’.  It is for the Greek underworld paradise where the good go, completely forgetting their former lives.  The ones that become completely animalized are placed in zoos where they will live a life of comfort.  They are no longer ‘safe’ for human to animal intercourse.”  <br />
<br />
“Others choose to be animals for a year or so, become human again for a few years and become animals again.  Ever wonder how some stars stay young looking for so long?  We do have strict policies on that, though, you can’t have a movie star that doesn’t eventually age.  Usually those clients disappear or ‘die’; we modify their genetics to give them a new face and a new build and they can start all over again to be ‘discovered’ in Hollywood.”  <br />
<br />
“Honestly, Mr. Behr, Mr. Noble, we are secretive but we are honest.  We aren’t body snatchers and we aren’t Sadists.  You were offered this opportunity because Rudy, before he became a bear, asked that we make the offer to you at some point.  We advertised our web site specifically to you and you were eager to join to see big hairy bear guys having sex with real bears.  We offered surveys and you willingly participated.  No one twisted your arm, did they?  From that, we got a good psychological profile and deemed that you would be receptive to the idea of becoming a bear.  In fact, you seemed far more than receptive, Mr. Behr, you seemed anxious from what I read in the comments section.”<br />
<br />
Eric blushed just a little at that.<br />
<br />
“However, that was all based on a ‘fantasy’ transformation, because you didn’t believe it was possible.  This is the final test, to see if you really do want to become a bear.”<br />
<br />
“If you don’t, that is perfectly fine with us.  You won’t tell anyone, because you’ll sound like a raving loony.  Besides, with as many aging senators, representatives, supreme court justices and ex-presidents as we have who are just waiting to be rejuvenated so they can do it all over again, how far do you think you would get if you tried to expose us?  You’d end up in a mental institution faster than you could shake a stubby bear tail.  What is being offered is a great opportunity.  You wouldn’t have even been asked, were it not for Rudy and were it not for your responses in the multiple ‘fun surveys’ you filled out.  It’s taken five years to complete our psychological profile on each of you.  You even met because of your profiles; you both signed up for our dating service and we found each of you your perfect mate.  Couples and individuals all over the zoo tonight are being given the same opportunity.  That couple you saw over by the wolf habitat is being offered this chance by my associate Dr. Susan Graf; you aren’t being singled out.”  Dr. Kemble said with a warm smile.  “And if your worried about your finances or what will become of your things and your house, we do have people that specialize in making sure your life is still pretty much were it was when you left it.  Apartments can be taken care of, cars maintained, jobs in your field found, things like that.”<br />
<br />
Richard and Eric thought that one over.  They certainly were perfectly matched to each other.  They both complemented each other’s personalities and were extremely comfortable with each other on the very first date and if their lives would not be completely disrupted, it might be easier to accept.<br />
<br />
“May we discuss this for a moment in private?”  Eric said.<br />
<br />
“Absolutely.”  Dr. Kemble said.  He and Rudy moved away from the pair and the couple moved over close to a group of snoring bears.  Dr. Kemble took Rudy’s big furry face in his hands and kissed him in the nose.  Ruby responded by nuzzling the doctor’s neck and licking his face.  Eric couldn’t help but notice the exchange and mentioned it to Richard.  Eric had a question to ask and one piece of proof he needed before he and Richard would give an answer.<br />
<br />
“All right, Dr. Kemble, we’ve made our choice.  However, before we tell you what we’ve decided, I need to know something and I need to see something.”  Eric said.<br />
<br />
“What is it you need to know?”  Dr. Kemble asked.<br />
<br />
“Have you ever been an animal and changed back?”  Eric asked.<br />
<br />
“Ah, I thought you might be picking up on some things.  You’re very observant, Eric.  Yes, I have been a bear, my interest is not merely academic.  My deep love for the Ursidae family of the Carnivora order made it a natural choice and I have no doubt that you have guessed that I too am homosexual.  I’m a little older than Rudy here and, in fact, he is my partner.  Because he cares about you, I care about you and that was what more than made my mind up to invite you here and show you all of this.  I have to admit to a certain amount of lust as well.  I find you two to be exceptionally attractive, as does Rudy, of course.”  Dr. Kemble said in a matter of fact tone to disguise his slight embarrassment.  “Now, what is it you needed to see?”<br />
<br />
“Well, there is the question of whether or not that really is Rudy there.  I knew Rudy well enough that he showed me a tattoo on his right shoulder blade.  Rudy liked Norse Runes and had the one that represented Thor on his upper back.  He had it done right after he was almost struck by lightning while trying to get off one of the buildings we were workin’ on.  The storm came in so quickly that it caught us by surprise.  He felt getting the Thurisaz rune tattooed on him would appease the God of Thunder.  Could you trim the fur off Rudy’s shoulder and show me the rune?”  Eric asked.<br />
<br />
“Certainly, I’m sure Rudy wouldn’t mind.”  Dr. Kemble said.<br />
<br />
Rudy shook his head no when Kemble asked.  Dr. Kemble went to retrieve a pair of clippers and a razor.  Five minutes after the doctor had left, he returned with the items.  They all followed the bear and the doctor to a small room used for examination and Rudy offered his right shoulder for the doctor to trim and shave.  Without too much trimming, Dr. Kemble found the tattoo and shaved it down to the bear’s skin.  Sure enough, Eric saw the Thurisaz rune within a solar disk, just as he remembered seeing on Rudy’s back and right beneath the sun disk was an odd shaped mole Eric had remembered seeing, further confirming that Rudy the Bear was the transformed Rudy Addison.<br />
<br />
“So, now that you have your proof, what is your answer?”  Dr. Kemble asked the two bearish men standing by the big bear as they stroked his furry head and back.</p>
