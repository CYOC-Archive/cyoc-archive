<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy woke up in his basement. There was only one small window in the massive room, so it was hard to tell what time it was. He stood up with the blanket wrapped around him, he was still naked. Andy felt his package, the new ball was still there, he held his hand up next to his morning wood, yep definitely bigger than it had been. He slipped his underwear on and headed upstairs. Mike was in the kitchen. Andy noticed him staring again like he had the morning before, Andy wondered if he noticed the changes. &quot;What?&quot; Andy asked accusingly. Matt had come down and joined the brothers in the kitchen. &quot;I need to go get my money back,&quot; Mike offered back nonchalantly, &quot;Matt and I bought a henna tattoo the other day at that magic shop and put it on your face while you were passed out drunk, cheap thing must have rubbed off on your pillow.&quot; Andy was furious, &quot;what the fuck is wrong with you guys?&quot; he spat at them. They smirked at each other, &quot;maybe don&#39;t drink so much&quot; Matt said playing with his cereal. Andy stormed out of the room. He&#39;d show them.<br />
<br />
The day passed pretty quickly, spent it planning out biking around the city and thinking of who he was going to drain next? And how would he do it? Andy got home around dinner time, Matt had his friend Kyle over. They had set up a tent in the back yard and were planning on camping out. Andy gave them some attitude about it being lame before his father told him to shut up. After dinner Andy went up to his room, thinking he&#39;d have fun jacking off in the room tonight since Matt would be out in the tent. Andy kicked off his pants and grabbed his dick through his boxers, it was amazing what just a little extra size did for his confidence. He looked out the window out the backyard and the tent therein. Matt and Kyle were sitting around a small fire. Kyle was 5 foot 9, with light brown hair, he had a runners body, lean but muscular. He was telling a story or at least thats what it looked like, his arms flailing around gesturing at imaginary scenery. Andy made the decision, Kyle was his next victim.  <br />
<br />
Andy turned off the lights and waited, keeping watch out the window. He watched as the fire burned low, and the two guys go into the tent. At around 1 am, he went downstairs and snuck out into the garage, watching the tent from the door that led into the backyard. He had been thinking most of the night about how quickly it all happened with Kurt, but there was still the moaning. What if Matt woke up? What would he say? How would he explain it. As Andy watched the tent, he noticed someone moving inside. Out came Matt, he sleepily stumbled towards the house. Andy ducked down in the garage next to the car, Matt entered and walked right by him. This was Andy&#39;s chance, he left the garage and sprinted towards the tent wearing only his boxers. Matt had left the tent flap unzipped, Andy slipped in. The night was warm and humid.  Kyle was sleeping on his back on top of his sleeping bag in his boxers at the back of the tent. Andy quietly crawled towards him. As he approached, he noticed a tent rise in Kyle&#39;s boxers. Andy was at Kyle&#39;s side kneeling over him. He slowly and gently spread open the slit to Kyle&#39;s boxers. Kyle&#39;s cock was average size at about 6&quot; hard, and as thick as a bratwurst. He had two golf ball size balls. Andy opened his mouth and slid it down Kyle&#39;s dick. Kyle moaned with pleasure, as Andy slid his mouth up and down Kyle&#39;s member. After about 30 seconds the cum came spraying out. Andy sucked up every drop, he could feel the cock getting shorter and thinner as he slurped Kyle&#39;s manhood out of him. Kyle&#39;s once defined features became soft and rounded. Once he had every drop, Andy took stopped sucking and raised his head. The once average cock was now tiny, it looked like the top half an inch of a chop stick. In the dark Kurt&#39;s balls weren&#39;t even visible. Andy felt the same heat he&#39;d felt before after Kurt. it spread from his throat down to his abs and out to his arms before warming his frank and beans. He laid on the ground next to a still sleeping Kurt. The warmth was now almost burning, Andy could barely move now. He knew he had to get out of the tent, but had to wait for this to pass. <br />
<br />
The heat passed but not before Andy heard the door to the garage close, He laid totally still. Matt stumbled into the tent, he collapsed facedown onto his sleeping bag next to the door. Andy was afraid to even breath, he was laying in-between Matt and Kyle. If he reached out, he could easily touch his brother. If Matt turned his head away from the door and into the tent there&#39;d be no missing Andy. What would he say? How would he explain being there? Andy&#39;s heart was racing, until he heard the unmistakable sound of his brother snoring. He breathed a small sigh of relief though he wasn&#39;t safe yet. As he waited, trying to control his breathing and remain total still until he was certain Matt was deep asleep, the dark voice returned. Andy&#39;s eyes drifted down towards Matt&#39;s butt covered only by the briefs he was wearing. Years of exercise had made it a perky bubble. &quot;enter him, enslave him, plant your seed, make him yours&quot; the voice whispered on repeat. It was if something was guiding him, not quite controlling him, but guiding his actions. Andy slid out of his boxers and licked his palm leaving a generous amount of spit. He started working his johnson. It stiffened quickly, it had grown If he had to guess he&#39;d added another half an inch in length and was now about as thick as Kyle was. His balls had grown too, he swear he could feel them churning out cum and testosterone. He&#39;d become more defined, his fledgling abs had become more defined, his biceps and triceps bigger. His calfs were coming in nicely too. &quot;enter him&quot; the voice commanded. Andy got back on his knees and moved behind his brother. His cock was rock hard and dripping precum, Andy collected it in his hand and worked it around his already slick dick. He watched as his hands reached forward and ripped the back of Matt&#39;s underwear open, the boy woke up confused, &quot;wha, what&#39;s happening?&quot; he said sleepily. Andy lunged forward, and rammed his boner into Matt. Matt screamed in pain, trying to fight off his attacker and wake up Kyle who was out cold. Andy thrust his powerful hips in and out until he felt an orgasm building, he moaned and let out rope after rope of his man sauce. Andy watched as shimmering glow spread up and out from  Matt&#39;s ass up his back and towards his his extremities. As it spread, Matt stopped struggling. Andy pulled out slowly, Matt rolled over and kneeled in front of a now standing Andy.  &quot;What do you command, master&quot; Matt groveled at his brother&#39;s feet. &quot;He is yours now&quot; the voice whispered trailing off towards the end.</p>
