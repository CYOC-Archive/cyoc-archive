<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The contest is in 12 hours. It is 7:00 A.M. and I have been sitting<br />
here all night – staring at the beaker. All night. I look at my 200 lb.<br />
frame in the mirror and see that my eyes are red, my body is shaking from<br />
lack of sleep, and yet I continue to stare at the liquid and wonder. What<br />
will it do to me? What results can I expect? What are the side effects of<br />
taking such a large dosage? I have tried it out on several “subjects” with<br />
incredible results – increased mass and strength, and near physical<br />
imperviousness to any tool of destruction.<br />
<br />
        Eventually they all had to be immobilized before they did any<br />
further damage. The condition of my lab is a testimony to their<br />
accomplishments - total destruction everywhere. And now they exist in<br />
suspended animation in bionic suspension chambers here in my lab - eight men<br />
who once weighed between 120 lbs. to 200 lbs. Each was 10 lbs. heavier than<br />
the other one was, and each was given a slightly larger dosage than the one<br />
before. I am 22 years old, a senior in college, and I purposely chose men<br />
who were smaller and younger than I am. The first was 14  - a high school<br />
freshman - and the last 21 – a junior in college. All were pathetically puny<br />
men who had been longing for more mass and size and who felt rejected by all<br />
of the people they knew.<br />
<br />
        I researched them carefully, followed them around, watched their<br />
habits, and found out their pathetic weaknesses. I played on those<br />
weaknesses in my talks with them about being rejected and scorned and<br />
totally ignored, and eventually convinced them to try the serum. No, when I<br />
think about it, I didn’t convince them – they begged me for it! They begged<br />
and pleaded until I LET them take it. And the results that they got were<br />
mind-blowing! Inhuman muscle! Inhuman mass! Added height! Incredible<br />
strength! They were like machines of destruction. They were capable of any<br />
feat of power! I had built an army that was at my beck and call! Incredible!<br />
Eight men who could have taken all eight world titles. Eight men no one<br />
could beat. But it was gone now.<br />
<br />
        I walk the room, staring into each of the capsules, viewing the 25”<br />
arms – the 60” chests – the 30” waists – the 20” necks – all 6’6” tall and<br />
perfect. What was I going to do? The contest was in 12 hours and I had no<br />
contestant. So what stopped ME from taking the serum myself? I knew the<br />
answer. It was what I knew about their minds! They were all incredible<br />
specimens but the serum had robbed them of any other thought processes<br />
except those of destruction and mayhem. With each man I had tried to change<br />
the formula to make him more able to control his actions; that is, except<br />
when force was needed! With the first few it was impossible. They were<br />
nothing but strength and muscle machines and they had no ability to control<br />
the havoc they caused. The last four were better – more able to keep their<br />
emotions in check.<br />
<br />
        And the last one was almost perfect! Well, that is up until this<br />
morning when he was in the gym preparing for tonight’s event. He was to be<br />
the next Mr. World - the next man to take the bodybuilding community by<br />
storm. The money, the fame, the endorsements – he would be bigger than any<br />
man that had reigned before him. It was all in the bag! He was on the table<br />
getting his post workout rub down. The trainer told him to sit up so that<br />
the assistants could do his arms and legs. Slowly the unbelievable mass of<br />
muscle raised himself into a sitting position causing every muscle in his<br />
body to flex hard. The four of them worked furiously – rubbing all of that<br />
incredible muscle mass and trying to serve this muscle man well. As the two<br />
men who working his arms finished the rubdown, he smiled at them, put his<br />
hands on their necks, and slowly lifted them off of the ground! I saw it<br />
beginning, and I was helpless to stop it. “No!” I shouted. And he ignored<br />
me.<br />
<br />
        He held them off of the ground, their feet dangling in the air, and<br />
smiled into their faces. Then he flexed his massive chest, let out a primal<br />
grunt, and suddenly rammed them together – crushing their skulls. He<br />
screamed again and released them, letting their bodies thud to the floor. He<br />
grabbed the two men working his legs and lifted them and he stood to his<br />
full 6’6” height. They were helpless as he walked toward the mirror and let<br />
them watch themselves in his massive arms. He made them face the mirror,<br />
their noses pressed up against the reflective glass. “That’s you alive,” he<br />
said, as he made them stare into their own eyes. “And now, this is you,<br />
dead!” Then he made his incredible 25” biceps flex into huge peaks, screamed<br />
his horrible primal scream and smiled as he rammed the two men into the<br />
mirror, shattering the glass. But their bodies didn’t stop there. They were<br />
pressed INTO the wall, beyond it, and then into the concrete block that made<br />
up the outer walls of the building! Glass continued to shatter everywhere.<br />
They were embedded a FOOT into their bloody chambers of plaster and cinder<br />
block and glass! A full 12 inches! He turned to the head trainer and smiled.<br />
<br />
        “Leave him alone!” I yelled as I went for the stun gun. He looked<br />
down at Max, his faithful trainer who had prepared him night and day for<br />
this contest, and put his hands under Max’s lats and he lifted him as easily<br />
as if he weighed noting at all. He brought Max to his face, and the poor<br />
trainer turned pale white. I knew the head butt was coming. It was how four<br />
of the previous men had ended their trainer’s lives.<br />
<br />
        I set the gun on ‘high’ and crossed behind the huge man’s back. I<br />
applied the charge to his neck and suddenly he let Max fall. He turned to<br />
me. “Open the chamber!” I yelled to Max, and he did limped across the room<br />
and did as he was told. The creature reached out to take me, and I somehow<br />
managed to press the gun into his head, and the jolt dropped him to the<br />
floor! My heart raced as Max and I struggled to encase him in the eighth<br />
capsule. It was nearly impossible – such massive bulk and muscle!<br />
<br />
        As we closed the door, I stood breathless, scared and bewildered<br />
about what I was going to do about the contest. “Are you all right, Max?” I<br />
asked.<br />
<br />
       “Sure,” came the reply, “but what about the show? The money? The<br />
prizes? Our future?”<br />
<br />
        “Let me think, Max. Leave me for a while. I’ll come up with<br />
something. And Max, no matter what happens, remember that these men are<br />
never to be released. There is no telling what destruction might result.<br />
Promise me you’ll make sure of that.”<br />
<br />
       “I will, boss,” he told me, and left me in the room – a broken man. I<br />
stared at the beaker and then suddenly reached out and swallowed the entire<br />
contents. I gagged and sputtered and fell to the ground. It was an hour<br />
later when I awoke.</p>
