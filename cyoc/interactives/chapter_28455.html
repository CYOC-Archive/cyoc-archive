<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Could you put something on please?&quot; Julio moaned covering his eyes as <br />
Janice/Tabra sat down cross legged. &quot;Know that you both used to be guys in <br />
there kinda ruins the image.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it makes you feel better I don't -have- a real gender, my species was made <br />
before gender was invented.&quot; That was T', no wait, Tabra. Even since that <br />
japanese cartoon came out everyone thought of -that- angel of free will. Much <br />
to T's own vexing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not really.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; said the angel fox in a different tone of voice, &quot;With nothing but ... <br />
well... -other- furry vixens around it hasn't really been that much of an issue. <br />
Let me try.&quot; <br />
<br />
Light shimmered around the angel fox as matter in storage was shifted and <br />
bound around her body. What became of it was a simple one piece dress that <br />
was thankfully long enough to hide the view from Julio. The dress had an <br />
open back to allow for her wings and tail. <br />
<br />
The fox angel looked at herself. &quot;And you did that totally without my help. You <br />
are improving. But no pants this time?&quot;<br />
<br />
The fox then hugged herself. &quot;I'm kinda loosing hope of getting my old species <br />
and gender back.&quot; <br />
<br />
She suddenly put both hands to the side of her, leaned back and laughed <br />
kindly. &quot;I've been every gender, and nearly every sentient species under <br />
every sun to generate life! And well...&quot; The fox tapped her chin clearly trying to <br />
think of something comforting. &quot;At least...&quot; The vixen thought some more, <br />
knowing that she said next could easily blow up in her face. &quot;You still have <br />
everything that actually makes you, you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For now.&quot; The fox's expression suddenly down, then became focused. <br />
<br />
&quot;Incorrect. Fusions don't work that way. She'll still have everything that makes <br />
you, you, just like she'll have everything that makes me, me. Why do you think <br />
we need to figure out an equilibrium between each other if we want our... <br />
heh... -child- to be rational thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
The vixen's expression turned soft. &quot;Ya know, rational thinking was -never- <br />
something I related to ladies before this all happened, they never acted in a <br />
way that made sense to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The expression stayed the same but the body language suddenly became <br />
more casual. &quot;You'd be surprised how often ladies think the same about men.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Geez.&quot; Said Julio. &quot;You two really are having trouble prepping for this, I can <br />
tell whose in control just by looking at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not as bad during fights thankfully.&quot; The formal tone meant Tabra. &quot;The <br />
adrenaline rush and the intensity of the moment pretty much means we -have- <br />
to think along the same lines, but things shift back out of sync once the blood <br />
stops pumping like a race horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So talk to me.&quot; She leaned foreword looking at him. &quot;What's this about you <br />
being over two thousand years old?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julio breathed in deep, he had told this story so many times, he had it down to <br />
a science. <br />
<br />
&quot;Once upon a time,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. I was a scholar. A thinker. A youth eager for knowledge while my <br />
friends were more interested in displaying achievements of physical might.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were a geek.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a geek. A greek geek to be precise. The Israelites' faith meant little to <br />
me, it was just some more information, some more history for me to dig out of <br />
the sea of myths and tall tales. My particular passion was -history-! And thus I <br />
search for the oldest historical volumes I could. Many I just kept since I lacked <br />
at the time the skill or knowledge to translate them. Then came the night I <br />
dared actually leave our family house, mostly because my parents were sick <br />
of me spending all my time indoors, and long story short I was press ganged <br />
to working on a salvage ship. I got more than a few lumps and bruises and <br />
let's just skip that part. The point is, one time when I was diving, I happened <br />
on a piece of sand-script. I was impossible, completely impossible, it should <br />
have by all logic and reason dissolved into nothing long ago. But it hadn't all <br />
the same. Curious I touched it, and I nearly drowned. Images, thought and <br />
ideas that were totally alien to me slammed into my brain. I'm just lucky my <br />
crew mates decided to bring me back on ship when they found me floating on <br />
the surface. I don't know what happened to that piece of sand-script, but my <br />
dreams were chaotic, maddening, my crew-mates began to consider I had <br />
gone crazy when I tried to describe one of my dreams to them. I dreamed I <br />
could see a series of circles interconnected.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For historical reference, that's where the jews got their blue print for the <br />
universe.&quot; The fox angel said. <br />
<br />
Julio ignored the interruption this time. &quot; I dreamed I curiously twisted and <br />
pulled at the lowest of the lines that connected the lowest circle to the bigger <br />
ones . . . I woke up screaming as what I could only describe as a tidal wave <br />
rushed outwards right at me from me. For a time I swore never to do that <br />
again.  It was only years later that any of it began to make sense, when I <br />
finally got off that awful boat. That my friends became men when I still teetered <br />
on the middle ground between youth and man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, he was a bit younger than that.&quot; That -had- to be Tabra. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whose telling this story?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get your facts straight.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, I was totally confused, I wondered if I was cursed, or just a freak of <br />
nature. But all the while my dreams began to make more and more sense. <br />
Until finally I -remembered- the war between loyalists and revolutionaries, <br />
better known to you as the war between angels and demons. As well as . .  <br />
other things that no human should be able to remember. Eventually I also <br />
realized, that seal I had undone if even for a moment.. it had temporally <br />
slowed down my aging. Then I had epiphany, I wanted to -see- God, I wanted <br />
to -meet- God, the all knowing, the all knowledge, my old quest reborn! But I <br />
didn't want to meet him when I was dead, I wanted to meet Jehovah when I <br />
was still a living man! So continued to open the first seal, carefully, never <br />
leaving it open for long.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot; She asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I got curious about what the other seals did . . . I wanted more <br />
knowledge, more information, and that little piece of sand-script I now -<br />
remembered- was just part of a whole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you started looking for it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very much so... and I sort of ... lost track of time... when I came back for what <br />
was supposed to be a visit, I found my parents had died of old age, and all my <br />
friends were all elderly men. They couldn't stand the sight of me, like my very <br />
presence mocked that they their time would soon be up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And yours almost was, wasn't it?&quot; That was Tabra. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. That was when -he- came to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Azrael, has a name.&quot; The fox said coldly. The fox then blinked. &quot;Who?&quot; Then <br />
answered herself. &quot;The Angel of Death.&quot; The fox shuddered. <br />
<br />
&quot;He told me my time was up. He told me that I had run my race and that it was <br />
time for my post job assessment.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess, skeleton in a black robe?&quot; The fox asked. Then she spoke to <br />
herself sternly. &quot;Please don't make that stereo type. Azrael, has always hated <br />
his given task and the stereo types that have gone along with it. You'll met an <br />
angel with more restraint. If you ever see an angel with a huge scythe called <br />
Pain's End, and looks like he doesn't get much sleep, that's him.&quot; She tilted <br />
her head. &quot;Not much sleep?&quot; She said calmly. &quot;Would you get much sleep if <br />
you were the one whose task was to end the lives of others?&quot; The fox became <br />
sullen. &quot;No, I wouldn't.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me.&quot; Said Julio getting back their attention. &quot;He tried to do his job, but <br />
I was way too stubborn to give up that easily. It also turned that the seals I had <br />
been working on, were inside every human in some form, when they say 'God <br />
made man in his image' they meant it spiritually, basically a weaker copy of <br />
his own self design is in every human soul. But after eating from the Tree of <br />
Knowledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The tree Adam and Eve ate from, it proved too dangerous to keep around, <br />
due to human nature to abuse power. So God put a seal as complex as the <br />
universe on it so humans wouldn't accidently blow themselves up unless they <br />
really, really, -really- tried hard at it the old fashioned way. Since I had <br />
partially undone the first part of the seal, my life was extended. Of course I <br />
found this all out later, over the decades I spent hiding and running for my life <br />
from a divine entity, as I learned to carefully undo the seal more. By the time <br />
Azrael, caught up with me, it turned out that my soul had become too altered <br />
to be reset, while Azrael, could reap me all the same, I think he didn't mind an <br />
excuse to spare someone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That's Azrael all right.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think also God was worried an all out fight with Azrael might break one of <br />
the particular parts of the seal.&quot; The words just hung in the air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Will you stop with the dramatic pause?&quot; She interrupted herself. &quot;He has a <br />
good reason for it this time. Remember what happened when I opened my <br />
real wings for just a moment? Well, maybe you don't, but the point is, using <br />
divine power unfiltered on the material universe, it would result in an <br />
extinction level event.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much, so in exchange for being allowed to seek out more fragments of <br />
The Knowledge, I promised not to try and conquer the world, -nor- take part in <br />
any high stakes super battles.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So you're, what? Immortal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hardly, leaking the open seal's power into my body is what keeps my body <br />
from aging quickly, I've never been able to stop it completely. I was a teen <br />
when I touched that piece of sand-script, now I look and feel thirty. Though <br />
back when I was a teen... that was already considered elderly by some. With <br />
the other seals I learned some other tricks, creating matter from nothing, like <br />
being immune to soul and mind alteration, and I can reset my body to it's <br />
original form if I'm infected by a lycantherope or nusferatu and other cursed <br />
forms of transformation, back when they were still around of course. But I <br />
need to actually concentrate on that last one to pull it off.&quot;  <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So what's this 'seal' on him?&quot; Janice asked out load, not bothering to do it <br />
mentally at the moment.  Tabra answered with the same mouth in the same <br />
voice. &quot;It's similar to the one that's used to bind my wings before I'm made to <br />
take a living form. Except mine comes with an emergency release switch. His <br />
he's basically had to hot-wire to open it up as much as he has.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I think I got that. So how do you two know each other?&quot; She paused <br />
then spoke. &quot;I was there when Nero burned the Christians, and they made the <br />
-choice- to stand by their faith rather than denounce it and live.&quot; She pointed. <br />
&quot;He was there hoping the early catholic wisemen there could give him some <br />
clues to where the rest of The Knowledge was. The last time we met was in a <br />
castle in Germany during world war two, I was hanging out with some GIs. <br />
We've had a bad habit of running into each other over the centuries.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You have no idea how tempted I've been to fight some times.&quot; Julio said. <br />
&quot;Consequences for breaking my word or no.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fox angel said. &quot;And you have no idea how tempted I've been to directly <br />
screw with someone's else choices sometimes. Promise or no.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Who had to be Janice said. &quot;So you guys put this kinda force inside a piece of <br />
sand-script?&quot;<br />
<br />
Who had to be Tabra answered. &quot;We didn't put anything in anything. It <br />
changed shape when it accidently got dropped into the material universe, <br />
those terrible lizards sure never saw it coming let me tell you. That piece of it <br />
looked like sand-script because that's what Julio perceived it as.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dropped?&quot; The fox asked herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were in the middle of the first and most intense battle in a war over <br />
creation, don't you think some things would have slipped through the cracks?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't think it was even real... now I find out that the final proof has been <br />
carried around by human beings inside them this whole time... so what <br />
happens if he, or you, broke your promise?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Janice. If you trust me in any shape or form,&quot; Who had to be Tabra said. <br />
&quot;You'll wait until we're one person before learning that, otherwise it'll give you <br />
nightmares for the time you have left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You make it sound like I'm terminally ill.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll be surprised when you learn how much death and birth are alike. Take <br />
it from someone whose been through it a couple of times. And as for you <br />
Julio... mind explaining just how in the hades you came to be here, and what <br />
the **** you're doing in MY -home-?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Julio was taken totally back by the sudden change in the angel vixen's <br />
demeanor, and actually felt a -little- small for -just- a moment. <br />
<br />
Julio said his next words -almost- meekly. &quot;I... I was looking for a friend.&quot; <br />
<br />
The fox girl blinked. &quot;You have friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julio opened his mouth to correct Tabra on the subject but, <br />
<br />
&quot;Janice, not now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julio started... guess he wasn't able to tell them apart perfectly after all. <br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, if you live forever, I'd figure you not want to get emotionally <br />
connected to open.&quot; Janice continued anyway. <br />
<br />
Julio answered, &quot;Actually, it's one of the few things that's kept me sane, <br />
believe it or not.&quot; <br />
<br />
The vixen tone and posture changed. &quot;I still think you screwed yourself over <br />
when you foolish extended your life like this, but back to my question, -how- <br />
did you get in here? This place was tailor made to be detect proof.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julio felt embarrassed. &quot;Well... heheh.. I didn't really detect it.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
The heartless desert sun beat down on Julio as he marched across the sand. <br />
The horizon creating the illusion of water no matter what way he looked. He <br />
closed his eyes against the head as he felt sweat come down his face like <br />
bullets. There was no moisture in the air to condense into water, taking away <br />
that simple solution. <br />
<br />
Dammit, he could feel it, like the string of fate in japanese folk lore. When his <br />
friend had been spirited away, in front of his eyes, by magic he didn't <br />
recognize, Julio had dropped what he had been doing and began the long <br />
distance (nearly half way around the world) to this middle eastern desert. Now <br />
he was so close he could actually begin to make out the source or rather, <br />
detect the source of the magic rather than just following it's 'vapor trail.' <br />
<br />
&quot;I should have rented out a jeep.&quot; He sighed. Well, he was out of other <br />
options, and unless he wanted to die of thirst and have his body keep <br />
regenerating him in agony until the next fog bank rolled in he could condense <br />
into a glass of ice water, he needed to pull out the bigger guns. Well, water <br />
was just hydrogen and oxygen right? There was oxygen in the air, and <br />
hydrogen was the most base element of the periodic table, should be simple <br />
and easy. <br />
Beware any situation in which the word &quot;should&quot; is mentioned instead of &quot;will.&quot; <br />
Julio used the most abundant thing around him, sand, and got to work on <br />
altering the matter... he didn't quite get the formula right in his brain heated <br />
state. <br />
Quicksand! And Julio's sudden panic pulled him down faster! Weird though <br />
was too... there didn't seem to be... any... support .. under... the now... very <br />
loose ... saaaaand!!! <br />
<br />
He fell, hit hard sand, looked around, and wondered if Jehovah had finally <br />
gotten him and he was in heaven, well, before the vixens all got a look at him <br />
and started screaming in panic and fear. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Janice starred, unbelieving (though that was coming a lot harder to do as of <br />
late). &quot;You -fell- in here?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll admit, falling into a quicksand trap of my own creation and landing in a <br />
gaggle of humanoid fox women wasn't the worst landing I've ever had.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fox angel spoke thoughtfully. &quot;At least this place's self repair spell should <br />
have closed the hole back up, and the wards around this place would have <br />
prevented anyone from noticing us anyway in the short time it was exposed to <br />
the outside world... still. I know you're not lying, but I don't believe in <br />
coincidence.&quot; The angel fox laughed. &quot;I wouldn't put it past Jehovah to pull the <br />
strings for this to happen!&quot;  Janice/Tabra sighed. &quot;It's a safe bet now that one <br />
of the vixen or foxes at the castle is or was your friend.&quot; <br />
<br />
Julio nodded. &quot;I figured as much. Still, I'm sure that no matter what Karther did, <br />
he couldn't have erased a person's personality totally!&quot;<br />
<br />
The fox angel nodded. &quot;I agree. The fact I was able to free Janice and the <br />
others is proof of that.&quot; Her face was intense.  &quot;Tammy is still in there as well, <br />
the sane generally well meaning human male who Tammy was. He's just <br />
buried in there deeper thanks to Karther's magic, the life force she absorbed <br />
from Janice's living body, and the two sides of Karther that she then absorbed. <br />
He'd never do these horrible things if he was in his right mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julio realized he couldn't tell who had said that last sentence, he decided -<br />
not- to ask.  <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Tamthis was very pleased with herself, very pleased indeed. <br />
Things went perfectly smooth. Of course to be careful she had to make the <br />
curse so those her children changed couldn't transform others as well, this <br />
was so she didn't appear to be growing like a cancer, which Karther had <br />
clearly wanted to avoid happening greatly. <br />
It had been a rather sweet sight as her children had used their newfound <br />
magic to transform their family and neighbors into wolfen creatures, giggling. <br />
Some had pleaded, some had run, some had even dared try to harm their <br />
own children. It didn't matter, them of them could escape her sand wolves, <br />
and Lucy and Natalie proved quick effective at holding the humans in place <br />
for the littler ones could work their curse on their birth parents. <br />
A couple of her children still needed to be house broken so to speak, but that <br />
task could be left to their mothers. The amplification of the natural wildness in <br />
children was  made apparent as the her children had torn their own clothes <br />
off, many of their parents quickly following suit. <br />
And of course they all revered and honored her beautiful, sweet, dear, and <br />
wonderful Karther. <br />
<br />
Queen Tamthis however was surprised when the girls among the children <br />
she had changed all changed into kitesune with one to three tails and the <br />
people they changed became the species accordingly. <br />
However they remained loyal to Karther all the same, so it was nothing to <br />
worry about. The inhabitant of the village she had raided mass relocated to <br />
within or outside Karther's castle. Their presence enabling her to alter the <br />
landscape around the castle, purely fueled and fed by magic into something <br />
resembling farmland. The kitesune proved useful in using their illusion in <br />
hiding this from cameras in the sky, and travelers. As was part of Karther's <br />
plan, she needed to establish themselves as part of the world as quickly as <br />
possible before Karther's abuse of the rules crossed the line. But she needed <br />
the numbers and the presence before that happened. <br />
<br />
Her children now stood eagerly at attention in her presence, the cute little <br />
things all grinning at her waiting to know what she wanted of them next, truly, <br />
if this didn't know they were brainwashed nothing would. Tamthis didn't see it <br />
this way of course, she say it simply as 'helping them along.' And in her <br />
insane mind, it was truth. <br />
Like an invisible army, she'd have her children go to the next village, then the <br />
next, then all the nomad caravans, then entire cities... it would take time, but <br />
she was knew, in spite of having an unknown time restraint, that once she had <br />
things underway, she couldn't be stopped! And her Karther's dream would <br />
come true! She hugged her children who automatically hugged her back. <br />
Roberta stood calmly at her side, all four of her swords at rest for she was not <br />
being ordered to kill anything, while Laura just clapped in approval by <br />
reaction alone. <br />
While Karther's kingdom great larger, in a way, it was still just as empty. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
When Julio began to ask around the vixen for his friend, (after being told for <br />
the tenth time he wasn't with Karther), he was dismayed to learn that most of <br />
the vixen could only remember their original names, let alone their lives <br />
before Karther had brainwashed them into slaves. He couldn't be sure which <br />
of them if any where his transfigured friend, or if his friend was still with <br />
Tamthis. He felt cheated, or worse, the victim of some inside joke.<br />
<br />
He was surprised when Tabra/Janice hugged him from behind, wrapping <br />
their wings around both of them. &quot;It's okay.&quot; She said, &quot;I know what it's like to <br />
lose a friend, believe me, I've seen it happen right in front of my eyes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Julio started, not sure how to react to this tenderness, but managed to reply, <br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll save your friend, I'll save Tammy, I'll save -everyone- who Karther's greed <br />
has ruined. I promise.&quot; <br />
<br />
Julio shivered, in his two thousand plus life, he had never been hugged by an <br />
angel! He had to admit it didn't feel that bad, kinda good actually... too bad he <br />
couldn't be sure just -who- was hugging him! Then there was the rather <br />
important fact that both of the females who were inhabiting this body were <br />
supposed to be male! He stiffened as this settled in. The angelic fox sensed <br />
this and let go of him gently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; She apologized. &quot;Don't know what came over me. Wait, I do. It's called <br />
sympathy, half of me isn't used to dealing with how painfully high an angel's <br />
empathy can get sometimes. Don't call me half of you. Sorry. Just because <br />
you-Janice, please, don't. Just don't. I didn't want this to happen,&quot; Julio saw, <br />
tears? &quot;I wish it hadn't happened, because you had a life too, and maybe if I <br />
had been faster or smarter you could have just returned to that life. But now <br />
both our existences are going to eventually come to an end, in a way that's <br />
deader than dead, and in a way that's more alive than life, but you didn't -<br />
chose- anything of this, but it's happening anyway... and... &quot; The angel fox <br />
didn't run, only because she couldn't run from herself. &quot;I failed.&quot; She leaned <br />
against a way, wrapping her wings around herself. <br />
<br />
Everyone stared for a few seconds before Janice/Tabra blinked and looked at <br />
everyone before standing straight up scratching her hair and shaking her <br />
head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Emotionally barrier between you two break down?&quot; Julio asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;For a little bit,&quot; Janice/Tabra a little groggily, &quot;Neither of us have really, well, <br />
been one who wanted to show off our feelings, I think having the two walls <br />
pressing against each other caused the foundation on both to break apart for <br />
a second.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sis?&quot; Vicki asked, reminding them that the vixen were still there with them, <br />
&quot;Are ya gonna be okay?&quot; <br />
<br />
The angelic fox put on a reassuring face. &quot;Don't worry sister I'll be fine.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sister?&quot; Julio asked. Had Karther kidnapped entire families? <br />
<br />
&quot;It's all we can really bring to call each other.&quot; Vicki explained, &quot;We've been <br />
together for so long it feels strange treating each other like strangers. Even if <br />
we weren't ourselves for most of that time.&quot; <br />
<br />
Julio didn't have anything to say to that, he hadn't had any direct family in over <br />
a thousand years, and had been out of contact with whatever blood <br />
descendants he might have even longer!  He had managed to remake friends <br />
as his old ones died off, but family was something he had never been able to <br />
replace. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
As Queen Tamthis over saw Karther's city for him, Alexandra looked over her <br />
master. He was clearly still drained from having loaned his power to his <br />
Queen, for he hadn't even bothered from change the female form he was in. <br />
Alexandra hoped he bothered to change back into his male shape soon, for it <br />
was not Alexandra's place to say what form her master should take. <br />
<br />
Jennifer originally Gene, the shiva vixen, had been loaned to Alexandra by <br />
her queen. Jennifer never spoke at all, she merely followed Alexandra's <br />
orders precisely and immediately. She made a suitable bodyguard for their <br />
master, unlike Alexandra. Alexandra hoped the queen saw fit to change her <br />
again soon into something that could protect her master without fail, so she <br />
wouldn't have to rely on Jennifer to protect the both of them, not that <br />
Alexandra would think twice about sacrificing her own life for her master. <br />
<br />
Jennifer hung over Alexandra like a shadow, as Alexandra tended to their <br />
master. Karther was didn't once command Alexandra to pleasure him, <br />
perhaps he had simply decided that no one could match his queen now that <br />
he had enjoyed her. Alexandra wasn't about to challenge that decision. <br />
 <br />
Master Karther of course, didn't stop talking about how lovely his new queen <br />
was, and Alexandra fought back pangs of jealously. She would not question <br />
the master's choices, if she was to be queen he would have made her queen. <br />
She would have been eager to serve him even as a mere concubine, a <br />
reasonable request since almost his entire harem had been stolen from him <br />
by the intruder and the two that remains had been reassigned as warriors and <br />
protectors of the castle. But Karther it seemed had no need of other women <br />
besides his queen as of now. <br />
<br />
Since waiting on Karther hand and foot came naturally to Alexandra, she <br />
didn't question if Karther seemed rather passive compared to his normal <br />
hyperactive self. She made note of her master's decision to use female <br />
postures and motions, she wondered what would happen if her master asked <br />
her to service him in his female form. Alexandra made a shuddered that <br />
echoed in her joints, if asked to service her master while he was female, she <br />
would do her duty, even if it wasn't how she wished to be with him. <br />
<br />
<br />
At least the master had gotten over his previously unknown fear of wolves, <br />
since there were now so many in his service within his kingdom. <br />
Maybe since her queen was currently going around in her female form while <br />
having quality time with the children of the latest additions to their kingdom, <br />
her master would see fit to make himself male again. Alexandra was happy at <br />
the idea. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So after losing Lucy and Natalie that leaves eight of us.&quot; Said Vicki looking at <br />
her other seven sisters not counting Janice. <br />
<br />
&quot;So now we're just gonna stick down here waiting for the world to end?&quot; Lisa <br />
asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;If that's going to happen, I want to at least be with my family.&quot; Barbera said. &quot;I <br />
don't care if I have breasts and fur, they're still my parents!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Might be better this way if we are.&quot; Keiko said. Everyone looked at her. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's just...&quot; Keiko started then began again. &quot;I'm not sure I can go back to being <br />
male... not after what Karther did, what he kept on doing. I don't think I'd be <br />
able to look at myself in the mirror again if I got my old body back.&quot; <br />
<br />
Luna laid back and looked at the ceiling. &quot;I don't know about the rest of you <br />
but I still owe that little thorn Karther, he's not turning everyone I know into a <br />
bunch of empty headed love dolls if I can have a say in it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Anna hadn't stopped looking at herself since their escape spoke up, &quot;I don't <br />
know, there's something, well, almost exciting about all this, now that I have <br />
my own mind and I'm not someone's puppet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna asked, &quot;You were a transvestite weren't you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No I wasn't!&quot; Anna retorted. &quot;I don't know what the whole deal is here, but I've <br />
always been a thrill seeker. Now that I'm not a slave, this is just the next ride.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This ride might not end all that good.&quot; Charlene said, &quot;Personally, I want off <br />
now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So that's it?&quot; Erica had her say, &quot;We're just going to break up, crazy fox prince <br />
is out to conquer the world, and two of our sisters are still his slaves, and <br />
you're just going to pack up and go home? I know we're not this way by <br />
choice, but weirdo magic and brainwashing or no, you girls are all still family <br />
to me, and we still have two family members to save.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We each have to make our own choices.&quot; Vicki said. &quot;None of us can make <br />
them for each other. I'm going to go see Janice.&quot; <br />
<br />
