<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Mark was riding Paul on the way back home he managed to get him accostumed to his new body. What started out as awkwardly placing his hooves one in front of the other eventually became an elegant walking and trotting style that Mark found much more comfortable then his previous attempts at a comfortable ride.<br />
Eventually, they arrived home, the journey taking only 1 day thanks to Paul&#39;s help.<br />
As they entered their home his family was amazed at Paul&#39;s new form.<br />
His mother of course had tears in her eyes, but this was her son&#39;s new form and she would have to get used to it.<br />
His father and his brother Louis were much more practical people as they started inspecting him as they would any other horse. Both having background in working with horses. They checked his teeth, his legs and even his hooves eventually remarking:<br />
Paul, this madame Illusia seems to have done a really good job. I don&#39;t see any apparent problems, you seem to be a healthy draft horse. said his dad.<br />
Louis on the other hand was a bit more skeptical saying:<br />
He might need some horse shoes if you plan to take him on the asphalt.<br />
Paul&#39;s ears jumped up at the sound of horse shoes and Louis noticed, patting him on the side saying that they are not mandatory.<br />
Let&#39;s let him rest, he has a long day ahead of him tomorrow and so do we.said his dad. <br />
As he said that, Paul was lead in to the family&#39;s barn, it was more like a large shed that had been retro fitted for him. <br />
As they placed him in his makeshift stable his brother Mark left a lit gaslamp in the shed.<br />
Goodnight brother, I hope you had as much fun as I did today.said Mark. <br />
Paul nodded and his brother left satisfied.<br />
The following morning Paul woke up while standing, something which was very peculiar to him,but he was going to get used to this as well, in time.<br />
When he opened the latch of his stable with his mouth he found his family struggling to pull the plow out of the house.<br />
He quickly trotted to them and pulled on the rope attached to it with his teeth.<br />
The plow immediately got over the barrier and was sitting in front of the house.<br />
His father thanked him and asked him if he was ready, he rluctantly said yes.<br />
They led him to the field and attached the plow to his back with a series of leather straps.<br />
Paul couldn&#39;t say that those straps were comfortable, but they weren&#39;t as bad as one would think.<br />
When his father gave the go ahead Paul&#39;s right back hoof hit the plow making it ring. Paul looked back with a worried look to see his father adjusting the distance between him and the plow while apologising.<br />
Finally, Paul started to pull the plow with his father guiding it and his brothers planting the seeds behind him.<br />
Paul was surprised at how easy it was for him to pull that plow. His back legs were giving him all the traction he needed and his hooves didn&#39;t let him sink into the ground. His front legs helped him as well just as madame Illusia had said, they gave him more traction and control over his body.<br />
His family was working very hard but at some points he had to slow down or outright stop due to the fact that they were exhausted. In moments like these Paul would look back at them and realise how hard they were working and yet how inefficient their hands were at field work. He wasn&#39;t making much effort at all while they were struggling. At this point Paul couldn&#39;t imagine himself working the field with anything but his hooves and remembered madame Illusia&#39;s words:&quot;By my calculations your hooves will be much more useful to your family than your hands ever could&quot; and he couldn&#39;t help but agree.<br />
After a long day of plowing Paul was lead to the stable where his father informed him that they managed to cover more than 15 times their usual distance.<br />
His Father was very happy and hugged his son&#39;s neck and he couldn&#39;t help but whenie back.<br />
Their schedule was pretty much the same day after day and Paul&#39;s schedule was starting to get repetitive and so was his family&#39;s. After a while Paul started to pull that plow without thinking about anything rather than his childhood friend Anne who was about the same age as him. He was constantly trying to find an explanation in his head as to why he was a horse but he figured that his family would introduce him and he stopped stressing about that and started wandering if she would want to ride him in the first place. He couldn&#39;t help but get aroused from time to time at the thaught of Anne riding him and his family noticed. One night they asked him why he was aroused and Paul simply wrote her name down in the dirt with his front hoof.<br />
His family understood immediately what he meant and started making plans to introduce him to her as a reward for his help, after all Paul managed to plow 3 times more then they had managed on their own and his father figured they had enough for this winter and then some. <br />
In the following days the work stopped as there was no need for more plowing and his father thaught about rewarding him with a pair of horse shoes for his efforts. <br />
One day his father came in into his shed and asked him to raise one hoof at a time. <br />
Paul didn&#39;t know what his father was doing but he heard the familiar sound of a measuring tape. <br />
After his father was done he said:<br />
Son I was thinking about what you have done for us and I wanted to show my gratitude through a gift. I&#39;ve measured your hooves and they a bit on the large side, but that is besides the point. I wanted to buy some horse shoes for you in order to protect them in case you ever want to walk on asphalt. <br />
Paul didn&#39;t oppose the ideea of having horse shoes especially since it allowed him to carry Anne wherever she wanted. <br />
Paul was able to write in the dirt outside his stable:&quot;TK&quot;  meaning thank you. His father immediately understood and said that he will get those custom made horse shoes for him as soon as possible. <br />
Paul was very excited about his reward and what it meant for him and his dream of having Anne ride him. <br />
He fell asleep that night while still standing and dreaming about Anne. <br />
When he woke up the following morning he couldn&#39;t believe his eyes, he was fully up and his front hooves were swimming in a pool of cum. When he lowered his head in between his front legs he also noticed that his back hooves were swimming in cum as well and that his belly was was coated in it.<br />
Paul did remember dreaming about Anne but, by the looks of it he had ejaculated more than once at the thaught of her which only made him more determined to want to be around her more.</p>
