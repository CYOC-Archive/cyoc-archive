<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty, Allen, Peter and Dustin decided to drive down to the beach for the day. They were running a bit late, and Dustin had missed the turn on one of the roads.<br />
<br />
"Dustin! You were supposed to turn right on Highway 98! It says so on the map, right here!" Ty said to him.<br />
<br />
"Okay, let me turn around." Dustin sighed.<br />
<br />
"Well, hurry up! We&#39;re wasting time driving around these little towns!" Allen added.<br />
<br />
"I can&#39;t!" Dustin replied. "The speed limit in this town is 30 miles per hour! If I drive any faster than..."<br />
<br />
Suddenly there was a sound of a siren coming from behind their SUV.<br />
<br />
"Oh crap... A motorcycle cop!" Dustin sighed. "Right behind us..."<br />
<br />
Dustin pulled over and turned off the engine.<br />
<br />
The cop parked the bike behind the SUV and got off. He then walked up to the car and bent down so he could address Dustin, while looking through the window.<br />
<br />
"Is there a problem, officer?" Dustin asked him, with an innocent look on his face.<br />
<br />
"Sir, you were going 47 in a 30 miles-an-hour zone. Speeding is not tolerated in this town..." the officer replied coolly.<br />
<br />
"I&#39;m sorry, officer. We&#39;re on the way to the beach and we lost our way..." Dustin added.<br />
<br />
"Please get out of the car." the officer ordered.<br />
<br />
The foursome got out.<br />
<br />
"Your trip through our little town is going to cost you 75 Dollar fine for speeding right now..." the officer started. “Or, a day in traffic school."<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the officer felt a tingling feeling through his entire body. <br />
<br />
"Hey... What... What&#39;s going on?" he asked.<br />
<br />
"FREEZE! " Demanded Ty. "You will not be able to move until I say so. I&#39;m going to teach all you cops in your little town how to treat tourist right."<br />
<br />
His uniform started to fit loose. His boots were bigger and wider. He was regressing! The cop, who was about 30 years-old, was slowly becoming younger and younger, thanks to Ty’s powers!<br />
<br />
“I can make you into a teen right now…” Ty replied. “Or, I can make you into a little boy…”<br />
<br />
The officer continued to regress, with his uniform now fitting him many sizes too big. The officer was now in his early twenties, as he continued to regress. <br />
<br />
“How about I send you back to high school?” Ty continued.<br />
<br />
The officer was now about 18, as his facial hair disappeared. He lost his height and muscle, and his face became slightly rounder.<br />
<br />
“I can also make you a middle-schooler…”<br />
<br />
The officer now regressed even further, slowly shrinking into a teenager, becoming skinny and short, with his uniform sitting on him like a huge robe, wrinkling on him in the process. His sleeves were just too long, since his arms were shorter. His slacks were all wrinkled as well, since his legs were much too short.<br />
<br />
“How about I send you back to grade school?” Ty laughed, as the regression continued.<br />
<br />
The cop now regressed into a pre-teen, and was now a sixth-grader, small and skinny, with big blue eyes, and an innocent look on his face. He lost all the hair on his arms and legs and on his armpits. <br />
<br />
“And now… A little baby…” Ty chuckled.<br />
<br />
The copy finally regressed into a baby. His face became rounder and his hands and feet shrunk further. He was completely covered by the big, black uniform. Finally, the little baby started to cry softly.<br />
<br />
“All right, time to grow back to fifteen… But this time we are going to change a few things …” Ty ordered.<br />
<br />
The baby started to grow once again, progressing this time. His face started to grow a little longer as his hands and feet grew bigger. His arms and legs grew longer, and his torso expanded. The boy became a pre-teen and then passed through puberty, as hair covered his arms and legs. Muscles started to increase in size, and the boy grew bigger in size and in height. The police uniform started to fit tighter than when he was an adult. Then the muscle growth stopped, leaving him looking like a senior in high school rather than a fifteen year-old teenager.<br />
<br />
“Now, you’re going to waive the stupid speeding ticket…” Ty said to the teenage cop, “Or I can change you back to your original self?”<br />
<br />
The boy shook his head out of fear. "Please don&#39;t change me back. I like this body you have given me. I haven&#39;t felt this good in years."<br />
<br />
“Good, you let us go and you can keep your new body. Just to let you know that there are no hard feelings I will let you decide when your body will stop growing. Open your mind and let me see what it is you really want.”<br />
<br />
The teen aged back to adulthood, right before the four teens. He grew slowly, filling in the ever-expanding police uniform. Ty made the uniform stretchable to accommodate the increase in muscle mass. Within moments, the cop was a twenty five year old, two hundred and seventy five pounds adult bodybuilder dressed in a skintight police uniform.<br />
<br />
Allen, Peter and Dustin looked at Ty&#39;s latest creation. This was one of Ty&#39;s best works yet.<br />
<br />
“You will not remember anything that has happened here in the last thirty minutes.” Ty said in a monotone voice. “You will now have a need to spend more time at the beach to show off your new body. Your friends will not notice a change in your body. Only your fellow officers, who come in physical contact with you, will change into bodybuilding police officers. When I snap my fingers you will act like anything unusual has happened.”<br />
<br />
"SNAP!"<br />
<br />
“Very well I&#39;m will give you a warning this time. Next time I catch you speeding it will cost you a hefty fine.” The officer said, as he walked his now larger body back to the motorcycle, starting the engine as he got on. As he rode off he thought to himself "I need to get a bigger bike. This one is too small."<br />
<br />
“Wow… That was close…” Dustin sighed.<br />
<br />
“Now, Highway 98 to the beach!” Ty said, as he jumped back in the car. "I think the police force in this town is about to get a whole lot bigger."<br />
<br />
All the guys started to laugh as they got back in the car. They rode off, to enjoy the afternoon at the beach. Who would they change next?</p>
