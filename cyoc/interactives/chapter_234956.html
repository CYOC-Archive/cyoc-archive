<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains, and not in any rush to open your eyes and get up, you remained lying where you were. Wanting everything which had happened yesterday to be a dream, you know it cannot be so as you are aware of how soft and comfortable the bed you&#39;re lying in was, as well as the sheets and comforter you&#39;re snuggled up under, you&#39;re aware of the plush you are hugging close to you, as well as the way the pyjama bottoms you have on brush against your body. Your mind clearing more and more as you wake up, things come back to you, including how you&#39;d gotten up in the night to use the bathroom. Sighing, knowing you&#39;d have to get up sooner or later and face the music of what happened, you mutter, &quot;No. Don wanna,&quot; as you snuggled deeper under the covers.<br />
<br />
Your body having other ideas, you eventually open your eyes despite what you want to do. Looking first at the plush dog, then at the Angelina Ballerina you remember falling asleep clutching, you push them away and the covers off you. Ignoring the design of pastel horses printed on the bottom and top sheet, as well as those on the comforter, you roll out of bed. Stretching and yawning, you stumble across the room, out into the hallway, and toward the bathroom. Inside, you stand in front of the toilet for a moment and stare down at the front of the sleeper pants you’re wearing. Pushing them down until gravity took over and they ended up puddled at your feet, you sigh upon seeing your flat groin and the slight cleft hinting of what&#39;s now between your legs, and turning, recalling as best as you can what Julie told you, you sit down to do your business, still disturbed you have no choice but to sit to pee.<br />
<br />
Finished in the bathroom, you exit and stand in the hallway. Listening to the silent house, you guess you&#39;re the only one up. Heading back to the guest room, you yawn, stretch, consider going back to bed, but decided your up for the day. Looking over at the window, you figure it&#39;s going to be another warm day, normal for Southern California, and wondering if you ought to wait until someone else was up or if it was all right for you borrow something else, you figure nobody would mind. Going through the dresser, ignoring the underwear, thinking, &quot;No way am I going to wear girl&#39;s panties,&quot; you select a pair of pastel purple leggings with a unicorn print and a white t-shirt, which also had an image of a unicorn on it. Unsure why there was a piece of fabric on the leggings which went around your foot, not knowing they were called a stirrups, you shrug and figure it was the way girls&#39; clothes were designed as you got dressed. Taking a look at yourself in the mirror, torn between liking how the leggings looked on you and upset they reinforced the fact you were now a girl, you turn your attention to your hair as you attempt you recall what Julie had done to it yesterday.<br />
<br />
Through trial and error, and after going to bathroom to look for a comb, brush, and hair tie, you at last managed to do it into a braid. Taking it out, you redo, making sure you got the general idea of how it was done, before repeating the process until you were satisfied. Taking a final look at yourself in the mirror, thinking you do look pretty, and put-off by how you like looking so, you leave the room and head downstairs. Thinking over what you should do, you wonder if Julie, or her parents, would mind if you borrowed the bike and helmet for the day and if you should leave now to continue your search for the well, or wait until someone else was up.<br />
<br />
Downstairs in the kitchen, you found the choice was already made for you, as you saw Julie was already awake and eating a bowl of cereal. Sitting down across from her, figuring you&#39;d have to wait, you listened as she asked, &quot;Would you like breakfast?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a nod and a, &quot;Yes, please,&quot; you squirmed in place, waiting for her to say something about what you had on.<br />
<br />
Instead of commenting on what you were wearing, Julie took from a cupboard a bowl which was a match to the plate you ate off the previous evening. Pouring dry cereal into it, she added a splash of milk, got you a spoon, also part of the same set, and set the items in front of you. Tucking in to your breakfast, thinking over your plans for the day, a couple things bothered you. Looking at the bowl and spoon you were using, you inquire, &quot;How come you and your mommy haf me use this?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a glance over from her breakfast, Julie saw what you were referring to and smiled. Telling, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. Mom and I are probably so used to seeing Lynn and Jessica, my cousins, and automatically serving them with what they call their Princess dishes. I guess neither one of us stopped to really thing about what we were doing, and seeing you as a girl, we served you on the same things. If you want, and I cannot speak for my mom, I can allow you to use the same dishes and flatware I use.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mind working over what she said, you answer after a bit, &quot;Is okay,&quot; and suddenly feeling unsure, you tell her after a bit, &quot;I, um, really don&#39;t mind. It gives me the right enough food to fill me up and, um, to tell the truth, they are, um, well, pretty. I kind of like them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie hadn&#39;t expected you to admit you liked them, nor was she expecting to hear you describe the dishes the same way her cousins would, and in the same tone. Dishing up a spoonful of her breakfast, she inquired, &quot;Do you like things which pretty? Like the outfit you have on?&quot; before putting the flatware in her mouth and chewing on her breakfast.<br />
<br />
Conflicted, you start to kick your feet back and forth. Setting down the spoon, you look down at the shirt you have on, then the leggings. Taking in how the lower garment is stretched across your front, clearly showing you have nothing there, as well as the way the soft fabric pressed into your girl parts, you squirm in place, shrug after some time and comment, &quot;I guess so,&quot; as you wonder if there was something the matter with, or if your mind was somehow changing.<br />
<br />
She could tell you were uncomfortable with the question. Changing topics, Julie said, &quot;After my mom gets up, she wants to take you to get a few things. In addition, she wants to talk with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wa&#39; abou?&quot; you answer as you return your focus on your breakfast.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not sure,&quot; Julie replied. &quot;But I guess it might have to do with what has happened to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod at this as you figured it was the best response you&#39;re going to get. Finishing your breakfast, you take the bowl and spoon and put them in the sink. Heading back to the table, you sit down to wait for Julie&#39;s mom. Wanting to talk to Julie about a few things, including asking her if she knew what happened to the dress and swimsuit you borrowed. Having last seen them on the kitchen table, you forgot them as you left to look for the well, and wondering if you should still return them, you tried to remember where you got them, but found you didn’t know. Deciding it could wait, as Julie had already gone back upstairs, you sat as patient as you could whilst you waited for Julie&#39;s mom.<br />
<br />
When she did come down at last, you found you had to wait a bit longer, as she got herself a cup of coffee and a bagel. After she&#39;d eaten, and had also made the offer of you going to watch cartoons, something you politely declined, she ate her breakfast, then led you out to the car parked in the driveway. Helping you get buckled into the booster seat in back, something you were at odds with about having to do, she climbed in the front, but didn’t start the car. Turning to look at you, she said, &quot;I have somethings I want to discuss with you. Some you might not like to hear, but I request you listen anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Giving her a nod, you tell her, &quot;Okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First off, I would like to tell you, though I believe it when you and Julie say you are actually Daniel, as incredible as this, but Ronald, Julie&#39;s father doesn&#39;t. This is understandable, as there are a number things he refuses to even entertain the notion of. And a girl who claims to have been a teenage boy until they made a wish is one of them. That said, you may stay with us until you have contacted your parents, something Julie said you and her are going to do today.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod at this, and she continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;And since I believe you, I feel I must point out something. Something I do not think you will like to hear. I think you should not look for the well you claim did this to you. You should remain as a girl, grow up as one, live as one. Learn to be a girl and say goodbye to your old life. You made a wish, and the end result of it was you becoming the person you now are. This is the consequences of what you did, and as such, I believe you should live with it. Not try to undo it. You clearly do not like what has happened, as you have demonstrated, and Julie has told me. But this is what happens when you mess with something you know nothing about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unhappy with this, you are torn between wanting to scream how unfair what she was saying was, or get out of the car and run away. Looking out the window, choosing to remain silent, you listened as she told you, &quot;This an opportunity for you. You may not like it. But tough rocks. Life has its ups and downs, highs and lows. This is one of those points where everything seems at its lowest, but it can get better. Whether it’s through you finding this well, which I cannot forbid you from doing, but think you ought to forget about it, or you staying the way you are. Again, I cannot enforce any rule or anything which says what you should do. But, if you were my child, I&#39;d make you live with the choice you have made instead allowing you to try what it is you are doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I am not your parent. Nor am I trying to lecture you. I want you to understand my point of view and what I feel you should do. With this said, the final item I wish to bring up is this. As I said, you may stay with us for a while, at least until you contacted your parents. But I am not your mother, Ronald is not your father, and Julie is not your sister. However, if your parents do not accept you, or what you tell them, please know you are always welcome here and we could be all those things, if you wanted. The one stipulation I do make at this point is, if you do come live with us, you will not be allowed to look for the well. You are a girl and thus will be expected to live as one. In the meantime, I am going to take you shopping and get you some outfits so you don&#39;t have to always were Lynn&#39;s stuff. Okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears pricked at the corners of your eyes, and without looking at her, you nod. Looking down, your hands folded in your lap, you whisper, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; before adding, &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my pleasure,&quot; she replied, and putting the car in reverse, she backed out of the driveway.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day passing in a blur, you help Julie&#39;s mom help pick out three outfits for you, some pyjamas, a dress and tights, and four packs of briefs. Afterward, the two of you head back, where you have lunch, and after Julie was done with her homework and chores, the two of you set out. Your first stop your house, you found nobody was home. Catherine you could understand, as she was probably at a friend&#39;s house. But you figured at least your mommy or daddy would be home, and after letting yourself in, and confirming they weren&#39;t, as well as the house clearly still showed signs of a teenage boy being one of the members, you leave. Spending the rest of the afternoon looking for the well, you try back your place twice more, all to no luck.<br />
<br />
Not even finding a note, you soon become dejected and wonder why nobody was home. Heading back to Julie&#39;s place, you withdraw into yourself and do not say much for the rest of the evening. Having dinner, you then spend time watching television with Julie, taking another bath, and getting dressed in one of the pyjama sets bought for you and, much to your displeasure, a pair of panties. After using the bathroom, you climbed into bed. Being tucked in and snuggling close to the plush dog you woke up cuddling, you stare out at the room. Your mind racing as you thought about what Julie&#39;s mom, who you were instructed to call Mrs Griffiths, as well as how your parents weren&#39;t home and what you were going to say to them when you finally got a hold of them, you eventually fall into an uneasy sleep, broken only when you awoke to use the bathroom or by the sounds of the house settling.</p>
