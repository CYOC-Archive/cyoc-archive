<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amanda makes her blind choice and... &quot;Option B it is!!&quot; She hits Enter, upon which she sees for a moment another screen akin to the custom change screen, with fine details on what she was getting into. However, like before, all the bells and whistles were daunting to her, so she decided to just trust the Chronivac, hitting Enter a second time, and then once more when a prompt asking if she wanted to commit to this action.<br />
<br />
What Amanda had overlooked was the fact the standard settings of what Pleasure Island Protocol B even did, or that by default the timer was set to one month unless the target gets pregnant then the changes becomes permanent, once the transformation starts, leaving the area of effect will not stop the changes until they finish (however ceasing and refraining from the actions that would trigger transformation and even performing action contrary to the rules [being good, sober, and/or chaste] will stop and even revert changes as so long as the target hasn&#39;t fully transformed), the transformation affects not only the body but their wardrobe as well, that individuals who come in contact with the bodily fluids of transformed or transforming targets will fall under the effect of the Protocol and will transform as though they were within the area of effect as well even outside of the primary effect radius, that reality overwriting is disabled, meaning people will start to notice the influx of transformations if enough people fall under the effect of the Protocol, and that the targets are aware of their transformation. After a progress bar fills, Amanda hears a ping, letting her know the Protocol was in effect, now generating a catch-all field affecting everything within an entire kilometer around the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile at TransDem Industries, a production supervisor was checking on the free test copies they had sent out and asked a coworker about Amanda&#39;s copy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, just curious, but why did you not only send a six-year old girl a copy of the Chronivac, but a copy of the newest version to boot?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her coworker turned to her and responded, &quot;The higher-up wanted a truly pure test run of the software, which meant sending it to anyone at any possible time, regardless of nationality, race, creed, or in this case, age. Now, if you don&#39;t mind, just leave it be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright...&quot; she relents, before receiving a text to her phone titled, &quot;Re: Kaitlyn Peterson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is...?&quot; she then notes on her computer screen that Amanda&#39;s last name was also Peterson. Quietly, she gets up, smuggling away her phone. &quot;Just... um, gotta shit.&quot; She then runs off. &quot;I think that went well.&quot; she thought, as she took off to study this text in depth.<br />
<br />
Back at Amanda&#39;s apartment, about two hours have passed, two hours where Amanda had decided to watch TV to pass the time until someone came home so she could get to see if this worked or not, when her older sister Stephie comes homes from school. &quot;Hey brat!! You better have gotten all your annoying out of your system because some of us don&#39;t get a free week off because of some busted pipes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!! I&#39;m not annoying!!&quot; Amanda snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like hell you are!!&quot; Stephie retorted. &quot;Gimme the remote!!&quot; Shephie jumped on the couch, snatching the remote from Amanda.<br />
<br />
&quot;No fair!!&quot; Amanda began to try to wrestle with Stephie mostly fruitlessly for the remote. &quot;I was watching that!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna watch Riverdale!!&quot; Stephie exclaimed, trying to pull up the DVR queue. &quot;No one cares about your baby cartoons!!&quot; Neither of them had noticed at that moment her hair beginning to lighten and her ears growing into points.<br />
<br />
&quot;They aren&#39;t for babies!! Dora the Explorer, now that&#39;s for babies, but this is The Owl House!! It has story!!&quot; Again, both were lost in their childish arguing to notice Amanda growing just a bit taller or her pants legs starting to ride up her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you&#39;re sounding like a loser weeb!! Is that what you what? It&#39;s bad enough my brother is one, now you?&quot; Still in a huff, Stephie&#39;s breasts swelling from B-cups to D&#39;s went unnoticed as the legs of her own jean shorts began to merge together, turning them into a denim skirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s wrong with that? You just like to bully and be mean to people!!&quot; Amanda shoves Shephie right in her now E-cup breasts, knocking her off the couch into the floor, momentarily stunning her.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s like, what you get for being a total bitch!! Hah ha- HEE HAW!!&quot; Amanda blurts out in a proto-valley girl voice, not realizing where such language, either the profanity, the ditzy &quot;like,&quot; or that seemingly authentic donkey bray amidst her laughing came from. She covers her mouth for a split second, but in the same moment Stephie said something that took her attention away from the growing predicament again.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that? I totally never expected to hear you swear at me until you were almost my age, but then that sound?! It totes fits an ass like you!!&quot;<br />
<br />
If you were wondering if this was normal for these two, well, not quite. By now, their fighting would have petered out, but there was a third party secretly riling them up. In the background, unbeknownst to the two of them, the Chronivac was whirring, part of its current operation directing it to emit a frequency, an &quot;itch,&quot; that helps egg on activities that would encourage them to transform.<br />
<br />
Stephie began to sit up, trying to look over her G-cup breasts now wrapped in a tight pink tank top where once it was adorned in a striped <br />
green t-shirt, when she saw a strange girl that looked almost her age sporting E-cup breasts dressed like a slutty schoolgirl, complete with button-up shirt tied up under her breasts and a tartan pink miniskirt, but most notably were her hairy ears barely visible through her luscious blonde locks that reached down to her ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m like, an ass?! I&#39;ll show you an ass then!!&quot; Amanda, between her anger at, which was starting to turn to lust for, her sister, the Chronivac psychically egging her on, and beginning to lose her intelligence from the bimbofication portion of the Protocol, still hadn&#39;t fully noticed they were changing as she sat down on her sister&#39;s chest and pinned her down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, the fuck?! This is totes not cool!! Something&#39;s happening to me!! Where&#39;s Amanda?!&quot; Stephie exclaimed, finally starting to notice she was changing all while her ears finish their metamorphosis into donkey ears that are poking out of a lush platinum head of hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, Mandi&#39;s here and stuff!!&quot; Amanda, or Mandi as she was calling herself said in a oddly sultry valley girl voice. &quot;...and she&#39;s feeling totally h-HAWWW-t!!&quot; Mandi cups her massive J-cup breasts and arches her back while slightly lifting her rear in the air, moaning as a blonde tufted donkey tail grows out from under her miniskirt. However, from the from end of the skirt, Stephie saw something else that was causing all kinds of mixed thoughts to bombard her mind slide out from under Amanda&#39;s skirt and sliding up between her breasts; a massive 18&quot; long donkey cock. Stephie was concerned. She knew something was wrong, but a growing voice in the back in her head wanted her to lick it, to suck it, to ride it. No!! This was her little sister and... that&#39;s like some totally yummy meat...<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it, Mandi!!&quot; Stephie finally shook off Mandi, who let out a shocked bray as she fell onto her now K-cup breasts. &quot;Something&#39;s not right. Some...&quot; Stephie was so worked up she went into a ten second fit of braying all her own before getting it under control. &quot;...Something is off!! Like, we shouldn&#39;t be all sexy and junk...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was all shocked and stuff when I saw I got transformed too, but look how all sexy we are!!&quot; Mandi exclaimed, pulling on a pool of &quot;adult&quot; knowledge that was basically what was left behind after most of her brains essentially drained down into her boobs, ass, tail, and cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, what will mom and dad think?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm...&quot; Mandi wasn&#39;t considering Stephie&#39;s words as intended, but instead was imagining herself sandwiched between the two of them, stuffing her cock into her mom while riding her dad&#39;s dick, the lewd thoughts causing her breasts and ass to keep growing, and helped start her ears to grow out, one of the last steps needed to complete her transformation into a futa bimbo donkey girl. &quot;That Chrono-thingie is the best &#39;puter toy evah. This is like, totes the best...&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;puter toy? Stephie tried to figure out what Mandi meant, but she too felt her intelligence starting to dwindle, making it harder to think, er, smarty things. &quot;Wait!! I totally got it!!&quot; Stephie ran over to the computer, where Mandi, er, Amanda, had left the Chronivac open and running in the foreground. &quot;This must be that &#39;Chrono-thingie&#39; Mandi was talking about. Keeping it open in plain sight was like a totally smart idea sis!!&quot; Stephie said of the obviously dumb thing her sister had done, leaving it out in the open for anyone to see. &quot;Wow... &#39;puters are hard... Heh, I said hard.&quot; Stephie giggled at her unintentionally lewd joke as she started to feel a warmness building just above her clit. &quot;No time for funnies, girl!! What did Mandi do?&quot;<br />
<br />
As Stephie tinkered, Mandi was finally having a few seconds of lucidity through her lust-filled haze. &quot;Like, I totally wanted to... I didn&#39;t intend to make myself all big boobied and funny feeling and all part donkey and junk...&quot; ...but that moment was short-lived as the bimbo donkey girl in her keeps growing stronger, bonding with the girl that was known as Amanda just a little while ago, and it didn&#39;t help that Stephie was wiggling a juicy ass that was hardly covered by a white leather microskirt as she was trying to look over the Chronivac, and was there some tuft of platinum trying to worm it&#39;s way out from under it?<br />
<br />
The two sisters were on the brink of finishing their transformations, but there was still a (slim) chance of stopping and reversing it before they get stuck like this for at least a month.</p>
