<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While many of the others began to drift off toward the back of the room, where William had noticed a series of tables set up with refreshments of various kinds. He thought he could see carafes of coffee, two teapots sitting on top of glass warmers that held a lit candle underneath the teapot, and two large glass bowls of what looked like some kind of punch,  William, Martha, Jenny, and Harry slowly made their way to a side to speak with Akane directly. It was figured that they would officially be given their den assignments, since they weren&#39;t listed as part of the official ceremony, especially as Akane lead them toward the group that had been seated with her during the ceremony. Jenny figured they were the Skulk&#39;s den leaders.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must thank you for accepting and for not holding all of us responsible for what Yvette Smith has done,&quot; Akane spoke politely as they walked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is no problem,&quot; William spoke, &quot;Martha and I have had plenty to see and talk with other weres since we moved in... at first I&#39;ll admit that neither of us were fully thrilled, but that was probably just the sorts of concerns one would expect from newly arrived normals. Yvette went rogue, but the interactions we&#39;ve had with the others has been warm and friendly. I can&#39;t blame you or the rest of the Skulk for one person&#39;s actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
William was referring more to his interaction with the college dean, who had made a point to help him understand that Moon Lake&#39;s weres weren&#39;t controlled by their were side and that there was very little about weres that truly changed when they became weres, as that was the best experience William could really relate to. Beyond that, William hadn&#39;t really had that many &#39;knowing&#39; interaction with any weres until after his transformation, and then it was more their attempts to apologize for Yvette&#39;s actions on their part. Martha was in a slightly similar boat, as what had really opened her up to the idea of being a were, being a cat was actually the friendships she had formed with Frances and Samantha. She, like William, hadn&#39;t interacted with many other weres, that she knew of, until after she had become a werecat.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it isn&#39;t as though what we&#39;ve become hasn&#39;t provided perks that we&#39;ve come to enjoy,&quot; Jenny added, and leaned against Harry, &quot;I mean... THESE were more of a surprise to me than something I didn&#39;t like.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane nodded as Jenny ran her hands along the sides of her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Akane spoke, &quot;still, you have our thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four nodded as Akane finally came to a halt near the den leaders were waiting.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime, there are some things still to be discussed and introductions to be made,&quot; Akane then spoke and gestured to the den leaders that had been quietly waiting, &quot;particularly with regard to your respective dens. The Skulk is the most centralized and unified were society in Moon Lake, but we do keep a den structure that divides up different areas of Moon Lake, generally based on location within the town, so that the Skulk&#39;s needs aren&#39;t being dictated solely by myself or my family. Leadership is important, but a wise leader makes sure the good of all is always looked after... and even in towns as small as Moon Lake, there can be areas that have needs different from others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Jenny commented.<br />
<br />
Harry nodded as well, though this might be a good opportunity to let Akane know about the idea that his parents had offered him and Jenny to turn an old attic space into an apartment for him and Jenny. The space was, in theory, supposed to be used for excess storage, but his parents really didn&#39;t have that much to store and thus very little of that space was used, thus his his parents had talked to is brother about adapting that space into an apartment, or at least as a starter one for Harry and Jenny. Both of them had accepted, though they didn&#39;t know for sure how that would fully impact what den they would be assigned to at present, because neither Jenny nor Harry knew when that project would be finished<br />
<br />
Akane, meanwhile focused first to William and Martha.<br />
<br />
&quot;William, Martha, since your family has already moved in to Moon Lake and have a set place of residence at 563 Wood Street, you both will be with the Wood Street den,&quot; Akane spoke as two werefoxes came forward, &quot;These are Julian and Diane Wyre, the Wood Street den leaders.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a pleasure to meet you,&quot; William said to them as they shook hands. Martha nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;The pleasure is all ours,&quot; Julian Wyre gave a polite smile to William and a nod to Martha. His wife then proceeded to hug their new den members.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll like it in our den,&quot; Diane said to Martha, &quot;I know that Dawn Hale would just LOVE to chat with you about things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha barely managed to hide a blush at the memory of the vixen she&#39;d met at the school&#39;s in-service earlier in the day. While they drifted away slightly and Julian and Diane began to explain how the Skulk&#39;s regular meetings would go, with them gathering at tables for their respective dens and coming to an agreement within that den before moving forward, Jenny and Harry received Akane&#39;s full attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;And for the moment, Jenny... Harry.... since the two of you are still in college and don&#39;t have a permanent place of residence in Moon Lake, yet,&quot; Akane said to them slowly, &quot;I can hold you both in my den until you have a place of residence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That actually might be something to talk about,&quot; Harry commented, &quot;as we might have a place of residence coming up soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Akane wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents in their happiness at our engagement have offered to have some attic space over the garage done up as a sort of apartment,&quot; Harry explained, &quot;It was built to have the potential room for it... though was only used for storage. But since my parents have never had that much to store up there... and my older brother works with and runs a local construction company, they had the idea to have that attic area remodeled as a wedding present. Unfortunately, my brother couldn&#39;t be here tonight... so all Jenny and I know is the basic plan for the remodeling. Beyond that... I can&#39;t say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you accepted the offer?&quot; Akane wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jenny nodded, &quot;it&#39;d be a nice starter place, we can keep an eye on Harry&#39;s folks, as they&#39;re both still normals, it&#39;ll be cheaper than actually renting a separate home or apartment... and in a way, I also like Harry&#39;s parents. They&#39;ve been very friendly to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry held Jenny to him and rubbed her shoulders firmly yet tenderly.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is most generous of them,&quot; Akane nodded, &quot;Do you know when this renovation will be completed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t know for sure,&quot; Harry admitted, &quot;My brother may have taken a look at it to get cost estimates on construction, but beyond that they haven&#39;t had that much time to get started. It probably won&#39;t be done by the time of the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane nodded, &quot;and your parents are on...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;123 Lycaon Drive,&quot; Harry answered, chuckling a bit at the use of the name of a mythical Greek king for who the term lycanthropy got its name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that will give us the chance to move you to the Lycaon Drive Den when it is completed,&quot; Akane gave a smile and ushered Jenny and Harry over before a well dressed Japanese/American man who stood along side his wife. Both looked pleasant and dignified. &quot;This is one of my son&#39;s, Tora Tachibana and his wife Keiko.* Tora serves as one of our local physicians has made me very proud with his work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny and Harry shook both of their hands. Tora and Keiko looked a bit older than them, not as old Akane but still older than Jenny and Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are the Lycaon Drive Den leaders,&quot; Akane spoke in introduction while they shook hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be a pleasure to have you with us,&quot; Tora spoke, &quot;though if you have questions... you may find Keiko handling a bit more of that... My hours at the hospital can be hectic a times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Jenny answered as she shook his hand, not knowing that Tora and Keiko were Yamato&#39;s parents, &quot;You and your mother have done a lot for me. All of which I&#39;m very grateful for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tora and his wife both nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;We hope your wedding is beautiful,&quot; Keiko spoke, &quot;and I&#39;ve worked at the head of the Skulk&#39;s services for flower arrangement and decoration and will do my best to make sure things for you will be as happy as they can be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Jenny spoke, &quot;everyone&#39;s actually been so helpful to me... and not just the Skulk... I&#39;ve very much enjoyed all the help that I&#39;ve gotten...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially the potential mess your parents could create,&quot; Harry sighed, &quot;as... there just doesn&#39;t seem to be much if anything that would be redeemable...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny sighed, but didn&#39;t say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you had any further direct contact with them?&quot; Akane asked, sounding to Jenny as if she were nervously checking on her own children or grandchildren.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Jenny spoke, &quot;Thankfully... though there are some plans in the mix to make sure they can&#39;t ruin everything. Doctor Twist has been helping me work on getting me mentally ready, should things come to a confrontation and work out all the reasons I can use to justify staying in Moon Lake and above all working on a mantra to run in my mind... to emphasize that I am my own person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good things to work on,&quot; Tora commented, &quot;Doctor Frances Twist has been very gifted in her field with regard to psychology.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May I ask on the plans to avoid trouble?&quot; Akane wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of it is in relation to making sure my folks and their idea of happiness doesn&#39;t totally ruin mine,&quot; Jenny explained, &quot;Both Samantha and Frances Twist agreed to pay for a second ceremony. One can be the formal one and the one that will be legally binding. The second, if my folks realize that I am my own person will simply be a repeat so that they can see me happy... and if they try anything... they won&#39;t be able to. I will already be Jennifer Jenkins by that time no protest they make can change anything. I&#39;d like them to be happy for me, but... I am my own person, and they won&#39;t be taking my happiness from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good for you,&quot; Akane smiled and privately approved of the plan that Samantha and Frances had offered to Jenny. It sometimes made her wonder if the two of them weren&#39;t some rare breed of werefox given cunning that would go into the plan.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
* End note: Dr. Tora Tachibana was introduced the Earth-3 thread and has been identified as a werefox there, though I don&#39;t think his wife in Earth 3 was ever named... Given the surname that he&#39;s had there, and the fact that in Earth 1, the only members of the Tachibana family (which according to what I could find on Wikipedia when Akane was introduced in Earth 1 IS a Royal House in Japan) that have been introduced besides Akane have been her grandsons, I&#39;d figured to introduce  him into the Earth 1 story-line. Here Tora is Akane&#39;s son and Yamato&#39;s father. His wife, Keiko immigrated with the family when they left Japan in the aftermath of WW2.</p>
