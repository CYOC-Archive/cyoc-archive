<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I had to think about what I was going to ask. After all, this was a big moment for her to prove to me that she really was powerful. The courtyard began to clear out as the students and parents all made their way to the next orientation. Lagging behind the group were two girls I recognized: Stacy and Heather. I had known them since middle school. They were inseperable. Stacy was tall for a girl, standing at an impressive five foot, ten inches, but never had much in the way of curves. She was far too athletic, her active lifestyle hindering her more feminine parts as her bust was at best a B cup. Her hips were narrow, ass pretty much non-existant, though firm, and a pair of long, toned legs finished out the physique. Anyone could tell she was a star member to every cross country, track and field, and soccer team. Still, she was pretty, having a sharp jawline, blue eyes, and golden blone hair that she kept cropped in a pixie cut. Heather on the other hand was far more a vision of femininity. Hell, she started developing early and never seemed to stop growing. Even looking at her now I could swear she gained a cup size or two since we graduated. She stood at an average height of five foot, six inches with an E cup bust and wide, voluptuous hips and ass. Her face had a very youthful appearance to it, making her cute quotient go through the roof. What&#39;s more, she had the most gorgeous head of hair you&#39;d ever see, with long wavy brown locks that dropped past her plump rump. The best part was that she never wore makeup, so you always knew what you saw is what you got. <br />
<br />
&quot;See those two?&quot; I nodded towards them. Lara turned to look. &quot;The one on the right is Heather, the other&#39;s Stacy. Stacy&#39;s a lesbian, been so since she knew what sex was. But Heather... Heather&#39;s straight as an arrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I can sense that Stacy wants her bad. That plunging neckline doesn&#39;t help,&quot; Lara mused. Then she looked back at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stacy&#39;s been holding out for Heather but... unless something changes, that&#39;s not going to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, something&#39;s about to change,&quot; Lara smiled, a gleam in her eye. &quot;But you&#39;ll owe me afterward.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that said she squared off against the two girls who were busy laughing and chatting with each other before flicking a finger in their direction. Satisfied, she turned and sat back down next to me at the bench. I stared. &quot;Nothing&#39;s happening,&quot; I muttered, casting a sideways glance at Lara. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just watch,&quot; Lara whispered. <br />
<br />
I did as she insisted, noticing how Stacy had apparently just told Heather a funny joke as the latter was almost falling over laughing. Then Stacy suddenly went quiet, staring intently at Heather who laughed and laughed, holding her sides. After a few seconds Heather recovered, wiping a tear from her eye. &quot;Oh, that is just too fu-&quot; Heather was cut off by Stacy suddenly grabbing her by the sides of her head and forcefully kissing her. My jaw dropped as I watched Stacy kiss the hottest girl in my high school, Heather too stunned and surprised to do anything but stare wide-eyed at the other who had kissed with such passion that her eyes remained shut. I felt a sudden tightening in my pants and Lara&#39;s hand coming to greet it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well then,&quot; she cooed, reaching up to close my mouth, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll be cashing in sooner than I thought.&quot; She unbuttoned my shorts and began tugging at the zipper but I paid no attention. Stacy held the kiss for a bit longer before backing off and staring longingly into her confused friend&#39;s eyes. After a moment she realized what had happened and suddenly blushed deep red. <br />
<br />
&quot;I- I&#39;m sorry!&quot; she squealed, freezing up and blushing beyond anything. &quot;I- I don&#39;t know what came over me. I just- I&#39;ve wanted to do that since Freshman year and you&#39;re so nice and holy shit gorgeous and you just keep getting prettier and I just couldn&#39;t handle it any more I just-&quot; she cut herself off, noticing how nothing seemed to resonate with Heather. Recognizing the matter as a lost cause she suddenly stood upright, refusing to look at her best friend who was still in shock. &quot;I should probably head over to the last orientation. S-see ya, I guess,&quot; she declared before stepping away. <br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s leaving,&quot; I muttered from equal parts disappointment and shock. Lara had exposed my cock and was giving it some superficial licks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm... it&#39;s not over yet,&quot; Lara muttered. <br />
<br />
Just as she said such, Stacy stopped, her legs shaking before giving out entirely. She keeled over like someone suffering a massive stomach ache. &quot;S-Stacy, are you okay?&quot; Heather asked, moving over to her friend. &quot;Do you have a stomach ache?&quot; Heather shook her head as her hands suddenly dove for her crotch and face turned bright red. &quot;Are you cramping? I&#39;ve got some spare tampons,&quot; Heather offered again. Stacy once again refused. &quot;Then what is it?&quot; <br />
<br />
Stacy seemed to be on the verge of tears. &quot;I- I think something&#39;s wrong down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, for goodness&#39; sake Stacy, let me see- whoa!&quot; Heather exclaimed as she forcibly removed Stacy&#39;s hands to reveal a thick six inch rod. Her surprise was equalled by Stacy&#39;s own as the two jumped back in shock. Stacy landed on her hands, imitating a crab walk while Heather jumped to a standing position and covered her face with her hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;N- no way!&quot; I hissed. I couldn&#39;t believe it. Stacy had a cock! Was she always like this, or-? I glanced down to Lara who looked up at me with keen, lustful eyes as she greedily ran her tongue up the underside of my own member. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like my handiwork?&quot; she whispered, though the voice did not come from her mouth, but instead boomed in my head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Stacy you... you have a man&#39;s...&quot; Heather hissed in disbelief, looking again to realize that the telltale slit of a vagina was also present. If anything, Stacy&#39;s penis replaced her clit. She was a fully functioning hermaphrodite. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heather, I swear I don&#39;t know where this came from,&quot; Stacy screamed, seeming more terrified by its presence than Heather. In fact, Heather seemed intrigued by it. &quot;Oooh... it&#39;s so hard and looks so weird...&quot; Stacy moaned, covering half her face from embarassment. Her newly formed member twitched in response. &quot;And it&#39;s twitching! Heather, what do I do?&quot; she asked helplessly. &quot;Heather?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather had taken baby steps towards Stacy, eyes glued to the fleshy rod that poked out from under Stacy&#39;s skirt. &quot;I... I can make it go down for you,&quot; Heather offered, kneeling on the stone pavement, already seeming to assume the position. &quot;But... you&#39;ll have to cum.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Cum with a man&#39;s... thing? I don&#39;t think I want to. Besides, what if it makes it permanent?&quot; Stacy protested. &quot;There&#39;s gotta be another way.&quot; Her body seemed to protest this as another inch of meat pushed skyward gaining length in her member. &quot;Ah!&quot; she gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if it never goes down, Stace? Are you gonna walk around with a hardon forever? Come on, trust me. I have a lot of experience with this,&quot; Heather smiled. Stacy didn&#39;t answer, but she also didn&#39;t move away as her friend bent over and offered a teasing lick to Stacy&#39;s glans. Instead, the hermaphrodite lesbian shivered at the sensation. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Stacy. I&#39;ll make it feel really, really good.&quot; With that, Heather swallowed Stacy&#39;s sword, an action that pushed me past the edge. I came inside Lara&#39;s mouth who dutifully sucked down my cum and continued to service me. Heather followed suit, administering her own oral to Stacy whose eyes rolled into the back of her head as pleasure consumed her. She may have had an aversion to men, but their organs were giving her the experience of a lifetime. After a bit, she was moaning, reaching up to cup her petite breasts to tease and stimulate them. I was honestly surprised at how well Heather was doing, but she took it further as suddenly, without warning she began fingering Stacy&#39;s labia simultaneous to sucking her dick. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh, oh, oh, fffffffuck!&quot; Stacy squeeled in delight. <br />
<br />
Her reaction made me cum again, Lara moaning with satisfaction as I felt my seed go down her hungry throat. &quot;That was a nice load, Jethro. How about another?&quot; she pleaded, the voice once again resounding in my head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep this up and I&#39;ll be empty soon,&quot; I thought, some instinct telling me that she could read my thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, Heather. Yeah, yeah, yeah keep going like that. Suck my dick, Heather. Suck my dick, fuck my pussy,&quot; she screamed, grabbing Heather&#39;s head as though to encourage her to swallow more. &quot;Oh, oh, oh, here it comes, here it comes, I&#39;m cumming!&quot; Stacy screamed as her member twitched and unleashed a torrent of cum into her friend&#39;s gullet. She moaned pitifully as the seed that had magically been injected into her by Lara expelled itself out. Heather lifted up, making an effort to show Stacy how she swallowed her best friend&#39;s magic seed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Stacy,&quot; Heather giggled, licking her lips. &quot;You are delicious!&quot; With that comment, Stacy&#39;s member hardened again. &quot;Oh, dear. Looks like I&#39;ll need another helping,&quot; Heather smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heather,&quot; Stacy whisperd. Without warning she lunged at Heather, knocking her on her back, shoulders pinned beneath Stacy&#39;s hands. &quot;I&#39;m sorry but... I really need your pussy this time,&quot; she grinned, her member twitching in concurrence. <br />
<br />
A concerned look came across Heather&#39;s face. &quot;W-what? But I&#39;ve never- I mean, are you sure you-&quot; She stopped short, seeing the look in Stacy&#39;s eyes, a very hungry look. &quot;U-um... well if you think that&#39;s what you need, just... be easy,&quot; she relented, suddenly becoming shy. <br />
<br />
&quot;O-okay,&quot; Stacy replied now suddenly not so sure of herself. Gingerly she lifted up Heather&#39;s skirt and pushed aside her panties. I was staring, dumbfounded at the scene unfolding before me. &quot;Heather... you have such a pretty pussy,&quot; Stacy whispered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Th-thank you,&quot; Heather whispered before Stacy pushed the tip of her member into her friend. Heather groaned and shifted as the glans entered her, followed by the long shaft. Stacy went balls deep, or at least what would have counted for it had she had balls. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; she asked as Heather winced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m just... you were my first. Just give me a minute,&quot; Heather said. The penetration was all I could take, as Lara successfully coaxed another load of cum out of my balls and into her stomach. After a short while Heather gave Stacy permission to continue. Stacy may have been too hasty as she did not take her blushing virgin friend tenderly. Like a bull suddenly released Stacy pounded away at her best friend&#39;s pussy. This time it was Heather&#39;s turn to moan. &quot;Oh, oh, Stacy, calm down. Oh, you&#39;re going to- oh- you&#39;re going to break me! You&#39;re hitting my- my G-spot! Oh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heather,&quot; Stacy huffed, ramming herself in and out of her friend. &quot;I love you, I&#39;ve always loved you. I&#39;ve always wanted to tell you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stacy,&quot; Heather smiled, reaching up to touch her friend tenderly on the cheek. They exchanged a glance before sharing a passionate kiss and then moaning simultaneously as they both climaxed in unison. <br />
<br />
Stacy froze, still inside Heather, then shuddered. &quot;If this is what sex feels like for men, it&#39;s no wonder they&#39;r crazy about it,&quot; Stacy mused, still huffing and sweaty. Without warning she pulled out, to which Heather moaned. She propped herself up to look and see her friend still hard. &quot;No, it didn&#39;t work,&quot; Stacy groaned, seeming upset and disappointed. She began stroking, hoping it would coax the thing to go down and scolding it for refusing to cooperate. <br />
<br />
Heather reached up to stop her. &quot;Don&#39;t be angry with him,&quot; she giggled. &quot;He&#39;s just doing what he&#39;s wanted to for years.&quot; She began massaging Stacy&#39;s organ back to full erection and then kissed its head. &quot;How about we just skip the last orientation... head back to our dorm and... deal with this?&quot; Heather offered. Stacy just smiled and agreed. Excited, Heather leapt to her feet and tugged at Stacy&#39;s hand, guiding the aroused hermaphrodite after her. <br />
<br />
I moaned releasing another load into Lara&#39;s mouth. She swallowed and pulled away. &quot;Mmm... thank you, baby. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed the show.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I can&#39;t believe you did that,&quot; I huffed, Lara replacing my pants how they were. &quot;That... that was incredible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... stick with me baby and I&#39;ll show you a whole world you never knew existed,&quot; she teased. <br />
<br />
&quot;We should probably go to the last orientation,&quot; I advised, feeling awkward after the whole ordeal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we could do that. Or...&quot; she smiled mischievously, &quot;We could go have some fun in the day room at our dorm.&quot;<br />
<br />
The way she said the last option made me hard all over again, but skipping out on the final orientation was not a good way to start my college career. Which to choose?</p>
