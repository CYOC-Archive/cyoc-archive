<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of course, there were more people in the park than just him, the sisters-turned-sumos and their mom. While their mother may have been interesting to change too, Cody heart some giggling behind him. Turning around, two girls in their late teens were watching the sumos leave. Seems even they aren&#39;t aware of he fact that those three were completely different just minutes ago...<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously? Why&#39;s someone even want to look like that? For a dumb sport?&quot; One of the girls, the one who&#39;d been giggling, remarked out loud. She didn&#39;t even attempt to keep her voice down. Sure, he was the one who had change those guys, but Cody still felt a little annoyed by this girl already. Before he could do much though, the other girl gave her friend a gentle nudge.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re too loud, they&#39;ll hear you...&quot; Her friend mumbled - or, Cody thinks that&#39;s what she said, at least. She was pretty quiet, and with the heavy thumps of the sumo brothers still echoing through the park, it was hard to be completely sure.<br />
The clearly more polite of the two girls had fairly long, black hair that looked well taken care of, and her skin was a bit pale. Fitting of her seemingly demure nature, she was dressed in a modest manner, with a large, dark gray hoodie and some sweat pants. That made it a bit difficult to see her figure, but she seemed curvier than she probably wants to let on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doubt it. I can barely hear my own thoughts due to their stomping.&quot; The more...outspoken of the two remarked in response. She flicked her long, blonde hair, in turn revealing a pair of earrings. Her skin was...slightly tanned, she&#39;s most likely still working on a proper tan. Her body&#39;s got a slim, fit look, and she&#39;s clearly not shy about showing that. She&#39;s dressed in a pink tank top and some snug-looking, black jeans.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Cody quickly got a feel for their personalities - one&#39;s a bitch, the other&#39;s shy... Could they really be friends? Either way, he knew he&#39;s found his next girls to change. At first, he thought of turning them into sumos too, thanks to the blonde girl&#39;s remarks, though doing the same change twice did feel redundant...<br />
Instead, after a moment of thinking, he settled on a different idea - turning the two into kid brothers. One unrelated to sumos, but that&#39;s alright. Luckily, neither of them seemed like they were paying attention to him, so he quickly put the changes in on the remote and pointed it at the two!<br />
<br />
Right away, the blonde girl seemed to wince as she felt...something hit her. A sudden, sharp pain in her arm, though when she rubbed the spot, she found nothing out of the ordinary. ...Not at first, at least. Though as she looked down at her hand, it looked a bit too pale? Like the tan she&#39;d managed to get so far was just being washed away! And that paleness was quickly spreading up her arm. Her nails shortened, their polish vanishing almost immediately. Quickly enough, the same happened to her other arm, too. For a moment, she just stared at her arms in bewilderment, unsure what to say or do... All the while, she didn&#39;t even notice that her hair was growing shorter.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, her shy friend felt that pain, too. At first she could only guess a bug had somehow managed to wiggle under her hoodie, but she didn&#39;t have time to figure that out before she stumbled a bit in her own shoes. They felt...too roomy! Or more accurately, her feet felt too small for them. Even her socks began to feel oddly baggy. Concerned, she looked over to her friend, only to see her predicament. &quot;Rebecca, y-your hair...!&quot; The girl stammered. Guess Cody now knows the blonde&#39;s name, Rebecca. Though considering how each change before this has played out, that name won&#39;t stick around for long.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? I&#39;m already-&quot; Rebecca began to answer, but as she lifted one of her pale hands up, she felt her hair. It was under half the length it should be, and she could feel it just getting shorter in her hands! &quot;What th-the hell is happening?&quot; She blurted out, looking over to her friend...and then going wide-eyed. &quot;Shit, your hair&#39;s getting short too, Julia!&quot; She gasps. Now Cody&#39;s got the other girl&#39;s name, too!<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? D-don&#39;t- I don&#39;t want that...!&quot; Julia muttered timidly. But yes, it was returning to her scalp really fast! Not even a minute had passed before both girls were stuck with all new hairstyles! Julia&#39;s was short and a bit messy, while Rebecca...there was barely any at all! Basically just light fuzz was left, much to her horror. She ran her hands over her head in disbelief while Julia could only stare in horror. While already bewildered though, things only got stranger as both girls started to shrink. Their clothes gradually fit them worse and worse, and especially Rebecca quickly had to grab hold of her tank top just so it wouldn&#39;t slip off her shoulders. But those breasts she tried to hide began shrinking, too, not that they were ever that large. The same was probably happening ander that hoodie Julia had on, which at this point just looked goofy on her shrinking body.<br />
<br />
Julia padded at her chest in confusion, her large sleeves hanging loosely and completely engulfing her hands. At this point, she couldn&#39;t see it, but her hair was getting lighter, into more of a blonde-ish brown color. Rebecca&#39;s hair remained it&#39;s pale blonde color though, but both their eyes gradually gained the same, green color - since they&#39;re to become siblings, it only makes sense that they&#39;d match. Suddenly, Julia&#39;s face turned bright red as she felt something between her legs. Multiple things, actually. For a second there, it even felt a bit pleasurable, though as she shrunk further, that feeling faded, leaving the girl...or now boy, rather, just all the more confused. He only barely dared to reach down lower to feel what had happened down there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ju-Julia, ugh... I th-think we&#39;re...aging down?&quot; Rebecca guessed, and with fitting timing too, as some softness appeared all across her body. Her arms, legs, face, even her belly! At this point, she was no longer a ten, she was a kid again - and as she stumbled and fell onto her rear, she too could feel something grow between her legs. At this point, her jeans were just laying on the floor, so she just had an oversized bra and top covering her body.<br />
&quot;H-how can that...happen? R-Rebeccaaa... I th-think I&#39;m... This is a boy&#39;s...&quot; Julia stammered quietly as his face softened up slightly, too, but at the same time it gained this sort of boy-ish look. He looked essentially nothing like his original self, anymore. Julia looked more like a boy who raided his big sister&#39;s closet and decided to try on her clothes. As for Rebacca, however, she wasn&#39;t quite done aging down just yet. While Julia looked about eleven or so, she soon looked like she&#39;s seven or eight? Nothing like her original self, she...or he, was now a young boy.<br />
<br />
The two just stared at each other for a good few seconds, not even recognizing each other. Though...the more they stared, something did seem to click. They&#39;re...brothers? Memories of being classmates, spending time shopping together and chatting about their crushes, though, somehow still remained - though crushes were more just talking about whatever girls in their respective classes looked cute. At the same time though, they&#39;d also remember bickering over who&#39;s turned it is to play game on the PC, or coming up with gross-out toilet jokes in the back seats of the car... While their minds were glossed over, Cody quickly did some more tinkering with the remote and fired again, wanting to give the two some actually fitting clothes.<br />
Rebecca&#39;s once revealing clothing quickly morphed around his body, changing into a yellow polo shirt decorated with cartoon characters and some bright blue shorts, finished up with sneakers that light up! He thought those were super cool, after all. Julia&#39;s baggy outfit moved in a similar manner, though the sheer amount of fabric seemed to significantly reduce. Soon enough, the boy is dressed in a black, button-up shirt and some blue jeans, accompanied with some sneakers of his own...which don&#39;t light up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...&quot; Rebecca groaned softly, slowly pushing himself up on his feet. He looked down for a second, as whatever remained of his original self felt confused by these clothes, but that was quickly pushed aside as he saw his sneakers flash with red and blue lights. &quot;Big bro...&quot; He called out, grabbing his brothers hand and gently tugging at it. &quot;Those big, fat guys were literally making earthquakes... They gotta weigh more than... Uhh... More than a thousand hippos.&quot; He remarked in a quieter tone than before, which finally snapped his brother out of his daze.<br />
<br />
Huh? Oh, what? ...Really?&quot; Julia was momentarily caught off-guard by his attire too, but his brother distracted him quickly enough. &quot;...Yeah, they&#39;re like...human hippos. They&#39;re so weeeird...&quot; He mumbled, while still not seeming too self-confident, it seems he&#39;s not...quite as thoughtful in his remarks as before.<br />
<br />
The two boys continued making random comparisons between themselves, giggling and bantering not too differently from how he could imagine two friends doing amongst themselves. Neither of them had yet to notice Ryan, though question is if he should find even more people to change, or perhaps watch...or even keep messing with these two.</p>
