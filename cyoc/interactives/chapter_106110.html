<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trusting that my earlier wishes would keep people from reacting to me changing my body in public randomly, I transformed myself into a 27 year old guy with a slim, hard body.  I quietly wished I was wearing loose linen clothes that would look right at home on a Caribbean beach.  My penis was hanging down one pant leg and I silently grew it in length and girth to make sure it got some notice. I started walking the mall and watching couples engaging in all manner of sexual acts right out in public.  There was a lot of more normal sex acts happening all around. It quickly became almost tedious.  There was a surprising amount of gay and lesbian sex happening as well.  None of it was particularly shocking, and there were still plenty of people shopping.<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t help but find myself aroused at some of the sights, and found myself with the expected reaction.  Of course, I wasn&#39;t the only one.  Single guys, especially those with less impressive endowments, were frequently seen tenting their pants.  Since nudity was now accepted, I slipped out of my clothes and opted to walk around naked, see if anyone would approach me.  I immediately noticed several heads turn my way, both younger girls and older women.  Even several guys couldn&#39;t help but scope me out.  I grinned and ran my hand along my cock once, both encouraging the looks I was getting and indicating to everyone that I was interested in some action.  I was a little taken aback when I felt a tap on my shoulder and turned to see a white haired old man addressing me. With a cheesy grin he says, &quot;Better be careful with that, feller.  Might put someone&#39;s eye out!&quot;  He chuckled as his wife led him away, tsking and fussing at his antics.  I smiled in spite of myself as the old woman took several glances back herself.<br />
<br />
With no one actually daring to approach me, I wandered down to the food court only to find at least a third of the tables with at least one person laid out on it being pounded in one or more holes.  Families would be sitting around while their teen daughter got plowed or mom and dad decided to try for one more.  A few of the happy couples I saw going at each other were people I happened to know were related to each other.  Apparently incest had become common and accepted as well.<br />
<br />
I caught a glimpse of a woman turning her head to look away from me and decided to approach her.  She was older than me, probably in her early 30&#39;s, short and curvy, wearing dark framed glasses and her brown hair cut just above shoulder length.  I silently wished to be able to read minds as I walked over to her.  I could immediately sense that she was both shy and horny.  She had seen me walking around naked and wished she had the confidence to do the same.  I knew exactly what she wanted to happen.  It was screaming in the front of her mind, and I decided to give her her wish.  She glanced back my way just in time for her heart to skip a beat.  She had been afraid I would disappear, afraid I would look at her with disgust, all sorts of things.<br />
<br />
I pretended like I was going to walk past her, but came to a sudden stop as I left her field of view and leaned in close to her neck and quietly growled into her ear, &quot;I&#39;m not going to be gentle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still reading her thoughts, I knew that she was suddenly amply wet between her thighs.  She had dreamed of a hunky guy using her for years apparently.  I was going to do just that.  She was wearing a generic Wal-Mart T-shirt and a pair of shorts that were honestly a size too small for her plump rump.  I grabbed the collar of her shirt and with a silent wish for the strength I needed, I ripped it down the middle, exposing her busty chest.  Her plain bra was cupping a pair of large breasts that proved to sag under their own weight when I freed them from their cloth prison.<br />
<br />
She had stood with me behind her as I groped her large breasts and pinched the pale nipples capping each.  After a moment of nuzzling her neck, I let my hands glide down her belly and undo the front of her shorts.  I let her feel them slide down her legs and I could read her shock as they landed in a pool on her feet.  &#39;This is real.  I&#39;m practically naked, in public, with a GORGEOUS man about to help himself to me...&#39;  I could read as my fingers slipped under the waistband of her boring, white panties.  I pulled them tight so she could feel them cutting into her waist and pussy.  I sensed her gushing another small orgasm at being manhandled so, and with another sharp yank I tore her panties off of her.  She gasped in pain and exhilaration as she slumped onto the table in front of her.<br />
<br />
I kicked the chair she had been sitting in out of the way and without preamble I slammed my cock into her pussy.  I immediately felt her tight walls clenching around me.  She was already desperately horny and my little shows of force had her ready to go off the deep end.  The head of my cock slammed into her cervix before I could get the entire length into her.  She took a startled gasp of air at the intrusion, her eyes wide in shock, pain, and lust.  I did not go easy on her.<br />
<br />
I began jack hammering away, pounding on her cervix over and over as I felt her gushing around me.  I reach around and mauled her breasts some more, ignoring the puddle forming around our feet.  After several minutes of her almost constant orgasm, I leaned back over her, my cock still pressed deeply inside her and whispered into her ear again, &quot;I know what you truly want, and I&#39;m going to give it to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could sense the fear that suddenly filled her mind.  I knew she wanted it.  I knew she was afraid of it.  I knew she would love it.  I made another silent wish that what I was about to do would hurt her just the way she wanted, but that she would not suffer any lasting damage or sickness, and that she would also have just as much pleasure as she hoped it would bring.  Fear was flooding her mind, that my cock was too large, that she had never done anal before, that she wasn&#39;t lubed up, and so on.<br />
<br />
I ignored her fears and slammed my cock into her ass in one sudden, hard thrust, just as I had her pussy.  This time I did not stop until I was completely inside her.  She screamed in pain, but I could sense her pussy still throbbing between her thighs.  I did not relent.  I pounded her asshole just as hard as I had her cunt.  She kept orgasming over and over.  After another dozen or so orgasms I finally felt myself on the verge of exploding as well.  I knew she secretly wanted me to pull out and blow a load all over her face, but I was enjoying the tight cavern of her ass too much, and with an animalistic growl I wound up pumping squirt after squirt of my hot cum deep inside her.<br />
<br />
As I slipped out of her ass, I realized she must have passed out.  I carefully helped her slump back into the chair she had been sitting in and sat down in another chair next to her.  I wished up a couple of cold bottles of sparkling water for when she regained consciousness and sipped on one as I politely waited.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t too long before her eyes fluttered open, only to see me sitting there.  I didn&#39;t need to be able to read her mind to see the massive amount of confusion fluttering behind her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Joe.  Help yourself to some water, please.  I wouldn&#39;t want you to get dehydrated.&quot;  I watched her as she gratefully accepted the unopened bottle for herself.  After taking a long drink she began glancing around abashedly, not accustomed to having anything like what just happened, happen.  Certainly not to her.  She was uncomfortable in her body, though she was not unattractive to me, she felt she could definitely stand some improvements.  Slimmer waist, firmer breasts, and a litany of desires for perceived imperfections plagued her life.<br />
<br />
As she was gulping down the water I explained a little about myself.  &quot;I&#39;m a magician, you know?&quot;  Her eyes widened a bit in skepticism, &quot;It&#39;s true.  That&#39;s how I knew what you wanted, I read your mind.&quot;  Her thoughts about my comment were ALMOST as condescending as the rolled eyes that accompanied them.  &quot;It&#39;s true, Karen.&quot;  She stopped for a second, wondering how I knew her name. &quot;Don&#39;t bother speaking to me, I can hear your thoughts.  Please, feel free to test me.&quot;  I paused for a moment as I took a drink, occasionally glancing at her as though waiting for her to think something.  Of course she was madly thinking of what she could use to test me.  Trying to avoid obvious questions that any old stalker could have found out she started thinking about her past, family and friends, old school mates, anything that might explain away the odd occurrence of some stranger making her day.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a simple explanation,&quot; I replied to that thought, &quot;I can read your mind.  No stalking, no investigating your family or friends, nothing like that.  I can do other magic as well, if you would like to see.&quot;  I read her mind thinking, &#39;Yeah right, like pulling a bunny out of a hat is going to convince me of anything.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you see a hat?&quot;  I glanced around me as though looking for the prop she assumed.  I silently wished that she would be able to remember and react to the effects of my wishes.  She finally sat back and gave me a skeptical look, still not saying a word, yet clearly telling me to give it my best shot.  I sat there, still nude, and held up my hands in front of me.  I moved them sinuous fashion, as though I were caressing her body once again.  As I did so, distracting her attention, I silently wished her body to the proportions she wished she had.  Her breasts were now firm and standing at attention in spite of their size.  Her stomach shed several inches and the few spots of cellulite vanished.  I toned her muscles for her and left her not feeling a thing.  Finally, I wished for a deck of cards to appear in my hands, which they obviously did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, making something appear out of nowhere, how original.&quot; she sarcastically commented, unable to keep herself silent any longer, even though I could read her amazement at the feat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, how about this...&quot;  I opened the deck of cards and handed her one.  &quot;Stare at the card.  Memorize it.  No, it doesn&#39;t matter if I know what it is.  Now, think of any other card.  Just think, don&#39;t tell me, don&#39;t give anything away.  You sure you want the ace of diamonds?  You can change it if you want.&quot;  Her eyes jumped in startlement at the ease with I called out her first card.  &quot;Ah, seven of clubs, much trickier, but you can still change it if you want.  She looked nervous, obviously surprised by my accuracy and got a sly, determined look on her face.  She was thinking that she would change her mind at the last second so no matter what card I magicked up would be wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, again, you don&#39;t have to say a single word. You have your card?&quot;  She just stared at the card, idly thinking three of hearts now.  I smirked at her as I silently wished for the card in her hand to change into the three of hearts.  At the same time as she changed her mind, now thinking of the Wheel of Fortune card from a deck of Tarot cards.  She was still startled as the card changed in her hand, but stubbornly refused to believe me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw well, can&#39;t win them all.  Guess I will just go home and watch Wheel of Fortune...&quot; I comment with a smirk as I start to stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!  Wait...&quot; She cries as I make to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?  You obviously don&#39;t believe me.&quot;  I could read in her thoughts that she wanted to believe me, but that she was just too cynical.<br />
<br />
I made another silent wish and we were suddenly on the beach in Cozumel.  &quot;Perhaps it would be best if I just leave you alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked around, not having noticed the change initially, now shocked to see the white sand and deep blue water.  She stood up smoothly and much more quickly than she normally would have, the effect of the changes I made to her body a moment ago.  Startled again, she looked down at her body.  She was in amazement now, looking down at her legs and stomach, playing with her own breasts, touching herself everywhere.<br />
<br />
I allowed her to marvel at her new body, the changes having come straight from her mind, she was obviously pleased.  I sat there sipping at a beer while I allowed her time to wrap her mind around what had happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you...think?&quot; I smirked knowingly.</p>
