<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Theta Kappa Pi is a fraternity on the campus university who is having a house party this Friday night. Two of their members Cody a freshmen, and Jackson a senior found out about the DILF pills and decided to prank some of their fellow fraternity brothers at the party.<br />
 Cody rushed down to the kitchen seeing Jackson laying several grocery bags on to the kitchen counter. &quot;Got everything ready for the party?&quot; Cody asked as he started to rummage through the bags, taking out some of the drinks, and snacks. <br />
&quot;Yeah, I think we got everything,&quot; Jackson replied.<br />
Jackson picked up a bottle of vodka and took a shot from it before turning his attention back to the bag of groceries. He then began to pick out more items that were going to be used for the party.<br />
&quot;You know what? I wonder if we should open up the party to people outside the frat?&quot; Jackson said. &quot;Let the some friends and girls in. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be a great party.&quot;<br />
&quot;You think so? I think we should keep it to brothers only,&quot; Cody replied.<br />
&quot;Yeah, I mean if we really are going to prank our brothers with these DILF pills maybe we shouldn&#39;t have outside eyes watching what happens,&quot; Jackson said.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a good point,&quot; Cody replied, as he put away a few items Jackson had bought at the store.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you did get some of those DILF pills?&quot; Cody asked with a raised eyebrow, &quot;Must have been a bitch to get some I bet!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah it was, but it was worth it,&quot; Jackson said with a sly grin, &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure I can pull this off though.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright, so the party is on tonight, and just don&#39;t get let the other guys know we are going to give them these DILF pills.&quot;<br />
&quot;Got it,&quot; Jackson said, as he started to leave.<br />
<br />
Later that night all the guys from Theta Kappa Pi were in the living room. There was ten of them this year, a smaller turnout due to the small private university trying to limit the amount of incidents that happened in Greek life. As the music was pumping in the house Cody and Jackson watched the room. On one side was Evan a skinny slim guy with pale skin, he was the frat&#39;s first openly gay member, he was next to his roommate a muscular sophomore named Jorge. There was Connor, Nate, and Thomas sitting on the couch, and over by the kitchen Sam and Kyle were taking shots of tequila.<br />
<br />
While the party was getting started Jackson approached Evan and Jorge who were off to the side.<br />
&quot;Hey guys, why aren&#39;t you guys dancing?&quot; Jackson asked.<br />
&quot;Eh, no one here that we want to dance with,&quot; Evan said.<br />
Jorge nodded, &quot;Yeah, why is it just us here, could have brought some girls for us, and maybe a gay guy or somethin for Evan over here.&quot; Evan rolled his eyes as he glanced back at Jackson.<br />
Cody appeared from out of nowhere, he jokingly, pushed Jackson aside as he entered the conversation. &quot;Hey, we did send invites out, probably get here later. Night is still young.&quot; Cody said as he passed some red solo cups where he had dropped some DILF pills inside to dissolve into the drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the plan?&quot; Jackson asked, he knew there was a plan, but didn&#39;t know what it was.<br />
&quot;The plan is I put the pills in some of the drinks, there wasn&#39;t enough for everyone so we will see who changes!&quot; Cody whispered to Jackson as they waited to see what would happen.<br />
Picking up cups, and dumping the contents into a cup Jackson turned to his frat brothers. &quot;You all drink these and see what happens!&quot;<br />
Nodding, the guys complied and swallowed the drinks with the DILF pills.<br />
The first drink Jorge downed in one gulp.<br />
&quot;Is it safe?&quot; Tom asked.<br />
&quot;Dude, all things considered I&#39;d say so,&quot; Cody said, downing his drink.<br />
Evan downed his drink next, and then after a few moments Tom followed suit.<br />
&quot;Well, we are going to see who the DILF&#39;s are,&quot; Jackson said as he took a cup from Tom. <br />
Jorge was the first to transform, as he grew taller and muscular. Jorge began to age up, his muscles growing, his six pack fading to a belly, he was still pretty hairless, but he looked like a sexy latino papi. He began to speak with a thick Spanish accent. &quot;Let&#39;s see those dance moves, que lindos cabrones.&quot;<br />
 he said to Evan he was surprised to see the man in front of him. His drink halfway gone, Evan didn&#39;t move, he seemed to be hypnotized by Jorge.<br />
&quot;Dance, pendejo.&quot;<br />
Evan began to move his feet, while glancing at both Jackson and Tom.<br />
&quot;Que lindo,&quot; Jorge said, as he began to move his hips in time with the music.<br />
Jackson and Cody observed the changes in Jorge, he was older, more muscular, and a total DILF. They also noticed how he seemed to be sexually interested in Evan.<br />
Jorge placed his hand on Evan&#39;s lower back, as he led him to the dance floor.<br />
&quot;Tom!&quot; Jackson yelled.<br />
Tom was next, he too was slower to transform. His drink already half way down his throat, Tom&#39;s body began to shudder as his muscles grew and his hair began to grow. He also grew taller. His youthful and adorable face was soon covered with a thick beard and mustache. He didn&#39;t grow much in height, but he more than made up for it in width. He became the perfect Dad.<br />
He was soon joined on the dance floor by Nate, with his new muscular Dad body. The pair began to sway and shake to the music, their youthful faces covered with thick beards and mustaches.<br />
&quot;Fuck,&quot; Jackson spat.<br />
Last to transform was Kyle. He downed his drink in one gulp, and paid the price. His body shook as he began to grow. His belly and chest began to bulge as veins bulged from his arms. His short hair became wild and unkempt, his face aged greatly. He soon had a goatee and long hair! The man who once was Kyle was now a sexy, muscular, and bearded man.<br />
&quot;Oh, shit,&quot; he said.<br />
Jackson and Cody marveled at the success of their prank, most of their frat brothers were now sexy muscular older men.  Their new bodies ready for whatever the night had in store.</p>
