<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff went back inside and looked at Aaron&#39;s stats, deciding to engineer a further change for the good ol &quot;bro&quot; from high school. Jeff knew that changing Aaron much more might risk Aaron discovering something was up, but he was enjoying this way too much now. Aaron was already so incredibly buff, and Jeff really appreciated that in the sight of him, but what if he was just that much bigger. What if he grew and damaged that pizza delivery boy outfit? Jeff got the Chronivac started up and worked on a new change for Aaron, setting it to go over a certain amount of time, among some other later changes set to occur once this was done.<br />
<br />
Grabbing up the money as he started the change, Jeff almost bounded downstairs again to the front door, eager to see Aaron Corby for the first time in a long time. When Jeff got down there, he opened the door to see Aaron swelteringly standing there, pizza box held in one hand with the rest of him leaning on the side of the house near the door, subtly flexing. Good GOD this guy is such a flirt, Jeff thought to himself. And even as he watched, he saw very slight changes.<br />
<br />
The sleeve that had previously easily held Aaron&#39;s bicep was now starting to get tighter and strain more on that muscular arm both on the bicep and tricep. Aaron took the money and handed over the pizza, smirking a little, &quot;Maybe we should be in touch, eh Jeffy? How about we trade numbers?&quot;<br />
<br />
Deciding to see how naturally the Chronivac&#39;s changes happened, Jeff decided to bring up what had happened so far. Looking Aaron over and observing his pecs starting to fill out his shirt a little bit too much for the shirt to handle, Jeff said, &quot;You know, back in high school, I never knew you were uh...&quot; Jeff gestured at the body language on display and how Corby currently presented himself, &quot;...Bisexual...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not easy being a hot jock and liking guys and girls, my man,&quot; Aaron responded, &quot;But trust me, now that high school and all its bullshit is done, I&#39;m free to be who I&#39;m meant to be.&quot; Jeff visibly swooned at Aaron, and the former jock slightly moved forward, &quot;You want a kiss goodnight? Yeah, you want a kiss goodnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t help himself. The growing nerd moved forward and kissed Corby on the lips passionately, the bisexual athlete eagerly reciprocating his affections. Jeff felt his own manhood thickening in his pants even as Corby backed off of it, sighing, &quot;Much as I&#39;d love to indulge in a good ol&#39; jock on nerd hook up, I gotta keep on with my job...mmph, gotta trade out these clothes too. Way too tight on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff waved goodbye somewhat regretfully and even so, as he watched Aaron Corby leave to head back over toward his delivery car, he saw Aaron&#39;s ass perk up and push outward, muscling up and tearing a hole in his uniform pants. And that was just about all Jeff could take, and the muscular intellectual grunted under his breath as the front of his pants suddenly stained from a load of cum.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Roger Aaron Corby finished up his shift about two hours later and decided to try and find a hook up for the night. The transformation Jeff had induced in him had both thrilled Aaron and kind of resulted in him growing irritated with his uniform. His musculature had pronounced and developed from merely the kind of athletic frame a high school dreamboat might possess to the deliberately massive and strong yet beautiful physique of someone dedicated to honing their body. Aaron hardly noticed anything was awry, per the conditions Jeff had written into it, but he could tell something was odd about it.<br />
<br />
Aaron got home and quickly stripped off his uniform, figuring it would be good to get a new, bigger uniform sooner rather than later. Standing, statuesque, in just a pair of tight socks and boxers Aaron Corby relaxed into a generously large chair in his apartment&#39;s living room. His massive pectorals almost obscuring the tightly muscled six verging on eight pack that took up his midsection.<br />
<br />
Aaron started to look at the hook up apps on his phone, figuring he could do with a late night hook up before bed. He was also looking forward to maybe getting in one more gym session before heading off to bed. Tinder and Grindr, what to do here... Aaron went between the apps, chatting with a blond bombshell named Jennifer, and a hot athletic 36 year old daddy stud named Roland.<br />
<br />
It was just a matter now of selecting who was going to be his date for the night.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was a generously buxom blond with a tight, toned and tan body, her personality according to the app seemed to be a sort of self aware cheerleader type. He adored her confidence and found her tight bum to be awesomely attractive. She was also in the area, and down to have some fun tonight.<br />
<br />
Roland was a muscular man who hardly looked his age, with his light brown hair combed back. He wasn&#39;t as toned as Aaron was now, but he had a really impressive sort of size to him, and a midsection in between being a muscle gut and being abs. Roland seemed really into him, and Aaron was impressed by his openness.</p>
