<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few weeks went by like this. Olivia and you had a lot of spare time all of a sudden, so you spent it drinking wine in the evenings and going outside during the days. Sometimes to the beach, which you grew to really like. It was a chance to see Olivia in a bikini and that just gave you material to work with. You had masturbated a lot the last few weeks. Mostly to milf porn and of course the mental pictures of Olivia. You hated to admit it, but it was mostly Olivia that occupied your mind. Not even your old girlfriend popped up all that often, which was a bit strange. At this point, touching Adam&#39;s penis was second nature and you had more or less fully embraced your new body as your own. <br />
<br />
Not only that, but Adam was now the name you listened to. Olivia and you had been out one night shopping and some friend of Olivia and Adam had approached you. When he called out &#39;Adam&#39; you had reacted instantly. You had been afraid of what would happen if you meet someone that knew Adam since before. If you&#39;d just not react to your new name. With Olivia by your side you had navigated the conversation and made your exit quickly. The friend probably didn&#39;t think twice about how you acted. That felt good, as the implications of people getting suspicious was scaring you. You hadn&#39;t forgotten what the lab would do with you if you tried to tell anyone and you didn&#39;t think they were going to take to lightly to you going about Adam&#39;s life like a complete fool. <br />
<br />
The hardest part was that you missed your family. You missed your girlfriend as well, but she felt more foreign by the day. You had went online to check her out on Instagram. A few pictures of you with RIP in the captions was all that she had posted about you since you died. After that, a few pictures with her and her friends. She looked happy. It made you both happy and sad. You hadn&#39;t been dating for that long, so you guessed her moving on quickly was going to be part of it, but still. Hard to blame her when you were moving on just as quickly. Hell, based on how much you thought about Olivia&#39;s body you definitely had a crush. It didn&#39;t help Olivia was a very pleasant woman whose company you had enjoyed these last few weeks. The wine nights had been a blast. Neither of you could stop laughing at the other person and everything she said was the most interesting thing in the world. Based on how she looked at you when you discussed something, she had similar feelings. The biggest proof of your blossoming relationship, whatever that relationship was, were the fact you had been upgraded from sleeping on the couch, to sleeping in the same room as Olivia. She claimed it was because she could tell you were getting a sore back as well that she felt more secure with someone else in the room with her. But you were pretty certain she wanted you in the room because she felt secure with you. Just not anybody.<br />
<br />
This brought you to now. You were sitting at the kitchen table and had just made breakfast. Olivia was sitting opposite to you gulping it down. Your gaze on her soft, pink lips. What would kissing them feel like? They looked so sensual. How someone like Adam had got to keep someone like Olivia by being manipulative made you sad. This woman deserved better. At least she was free now, although 42 years old. One night she told you she had gotten a spiral in secret, to make sure she wouldn&#39;t get pregnant after she realized what kind of man Adam was. She still wanted kids, but at 42, that might be out of reach. But in a few months you&#39;d divorce her and she could get lucky. With her sexy body and great mind finding a man wouldn&#39;t be a problem, at least according to you. Heck, you were about to pull a move that might just ruin the growing relationship between Olivia and you, or give you a shoot at being that man. You would not mind being that man. <br />
<br />
You collected all the courage you had and still barely got out much more than &quot;Umm... Olivia... Would you like to...&quot; before you trailed off. <br />
Olivia looked at you, puzzled and asked &quot;Like what?&quot;. You took a deep breath and this time said what you wanted to say &quot;Would you like to go out someday? Like a real date. An actual date with romance in mind?&quot;. Olivia was looking at you with a surprised face. You added &quot;I like you. I think I like you a lot even. I think you&#39;re an amazing woman and I&#39;d really like to...&quot; before Olivia had gone up to you and put a finger over your mouth. Olivia opened her mouth to speak.</p>
