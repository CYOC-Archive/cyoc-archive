<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kate and Kerry came back in through the front door and found Michael where they had left him, on his tablet at the kitchen table. “So I gather you return with knowledge of how the socks work?”<br />
<br />
“We think so” said Kate. How about we put the kettle on and I can explain what we found out over a cuppa”<br />
<br />
“Sounds good to me”<br />
<br />
“If you excuse me I might just visit the loo” said Kerry. She suspected her period had started. She went down the hall to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“Where’s Tom?” asked Kate<br />
<br />
“In your bedroom. Hiding I guess. I think I should warn you. After your phone call Tom decided he couldn’t wait. He tried the socks again and well he didn’t revert to his own form”<br />
<br />
“What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
“Go and see for yourself”<br />
<br />
Kate did. She went to her bedroom and knocked “Tom? Can I come in?”<br />
<br />
“I suppose I can’t hide forever” she heard Kerry’s voice from inside.<br />
<br />
Kate opened the door to see Kerry sitting on her bed. No not Kerry. Kerry who she had just come into the house with was wearing blue jeans and a feminine brown top. This Kerry was also in jeans but a light blue shirt. The same shirt she had helped Tom put on this morning.<br />
<br />
“Tom?” Kate had to ask. It couldn’t be anyone else but ……<br />
<br />
“Yep. As you can see it didn’t work as I planned”<br />
<br />
“Why didn’t you wait for us?”<br />
<br />
“I was eager to get my gear back. But you can see how that worked out” <br />
<br />
“You have make-up on”<br />
<br />
“Seems to come with the face. Nail polish on my fingernails as well”<br />
<br />
“Why didn’t you stop when it was obviously going the wrong way?”<br />
<br />
“I did. But my face was Kerry’s by the time the changes stopped. By that stage I thought I may as well go the whole way and put the socks back on again. I had nothing to lose anymore and at least like this I no longer am a freak”<br />
<br />
“You did it on purpose?”<br />
<br />
“Just the hair and my hands. The face had already changed”<br />
<br />
“So you are totally Kerry now? You let the changes complete?”<br />
<br />
“Yep”<br />
<br />
“Are there mental changes? You are still Tom?”<br />
<br />
“I’m still Tom. I don’t think there are mental changes. You&#39;re still my wife and I love and desire you”<br />
<br />
“I suppose that’s a comfort..but….” Kate was still standing in the doorway. She realised someone was now beside her.<br />
<br />
“Hello Kerry” said Tom.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god!” replied Kerry in the same voice upon seeing her identical twin. “It’s like looking in a mirror!”<br />
<br />
“Stand up and turn around” commanded Kate. Tom did. He turned full circle. “I have two sisters-in law and no more husband. At least earlier you had your own face. I could still tell who you were”<br />
<br />
“Kettles boiled” called Michael from the kitchen. “Who wants what?”<br />
<br />
“Has Michael already seen you?” asked Kate<br />
<br />
“He was watching as I completed the change”<br />
<br />
“Well in that case come down to the kitchen. No point hiding any more. I need a coffee. What about you? Do you still have your own taste buds or do you now have Kerry’s tastes?”<br />
<br />
“I have no idea. I have Kerry’s teeth. So I probably have her taste buds”<br />
<br />
“Well if you have my taste buds you won’t like the strong coffee you usually have” Kerry was not a coffee drinker. She found coffee so bitter.<br />
<br />
Kate went to the kitchen and began making drinks. She decided to make Tom his usual espresso. That would quickly answer the question as to whether he had Kerry’s tastes.<br />
<br />
Kerry waited for Tom at the door. When he got close she stopped him. She looked over her doppelganger very closely “It’s exactly like looking in a mirror” she too had to ask “Did you put the make-up on?” Once more Tom explained how the make-up had come with the changes.<br />
<br />
The twins arrived in the kitchen. Michael put his tablet down and stared at the two of them. He realised that it was only the clothes that allowed him to know who was his wife. He asked Kerry “How do you feel about having a twin?”<br />
<br />
“Quite exciting actually. I’ve never had a sister before let alone a twin” explained Kerry “I’d love to take her dress shopping. Are you available this afternoon?” she was again looking at Tom<br />
<br />
Tom had noticed Kerry had referred to him as ‘her’ he couldn’t blame Kerry. “Not high on my agenda. Sorry. My priority is to try and reverse this if I can. I want to know what you found out. Michael said you had described your outing as successful”<br />
<br />
Kate handed out the drinks. To Tom she said “Taste this. I can make you something else if you don’t like it” <br />
<br />
Tom took a sip and screwed up his face “It’s so bitter! Is this my normal coffee?”<br />
<br />
“Exactly as I usually make it. I guess that confirms you have Kerry’s taste buds. So I’m also guessing you would prefer a hot chocolate instead?”<br />
<br />
Tom looked at the true Kerry. She nodded her head, so Tom replied “I guess so”<br />
<br />
When they finally were all seated and Tom was sipping his hot chocolate Kate told of their excursion and how the shop had closed down. She then told how they had been approached by a woman and what that woman had told them.<br />
<br />
Kerry said “I’m sorry Tom. I didn’t consider what I did to you shoes wearing them. I was just confirming that your shoes were way too big for my feet” <br />
<br />
Tom replied in an identical voice “No recriminations. I can see why you might have done it. If what the woman told you is correct there should be no long term consequences. And that is the only thing that is important at the moment. If this works we must celebrate. I’ll take everyone out for lunch”<br />
<br />
“Well finish your drinks and we can try again”<br />
<br />
“But I’ll lose my clothes horse” complained Kerry<br />
<br />
“If this is reversible then you can create a new clothes horse whenever you want” commented Kate. “I’d be willing to try out your hot bod”<br />
<br />
“So what exactly do I have to do?” asked Tom. <br />
<br />
“Put the socks on then step into some of your own shoes that no one else has worn”</p>
