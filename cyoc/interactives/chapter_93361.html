<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashley stumbled at the sudden pain in her chest. She leaned forward which seemed to ease her discomfort, but couldn&#39;t understand what had happened.  She was dressed normally, nothing had struck her, she didn&#39;t think she&#39;d been stung, her underwire hadn&#39;t snapped...and now that the sudden shock was past she couldn&#39;t identify any one feeling out of the ordinary.  It was just what she always felt, only it was so intense!  The tight cups of the reducing bra her mother made her wear felt like they were mashing her bosoms against her ribs.  Leaning over helped relieve some of that pressure, but now she could focus on how hot and clammy her bra was, the warm day and her tight clothing trapping her sweat.  And she could feel tiny droplets beginning to trickle down the sides of her--she clutched her arms tight to her chest and shook her head, she couldn&#39;t be having thoughts like that, not here on the street!  But with every breath she took she felt her skin pressing and pulling away from her damp bra. Sweat was running down the sides of her face, she began breathing shallowly and pulled her arms tighter across her chest; let  the discomfort of that pressure overwhelm other, more sensual sensations, until she could get a hold of herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was some underclassman.  She wanted to scream at him, but long hours of parental discipline kept her impulses in check.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Please go away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her posture was undignified.  &#39;A lady is always in possession of perfect posture!&#39;  She&#39;d heard those words so often she even repeated them to herself when she felt her shoulders slumping.  And now she wasn&#39;t alone, there was a boy here so she couldn&#39;t ignore the guilt, no matter that he was some Faithless nobody.  &#39;A Lady smiles and is graceful in the presence of men!&#39;  There were so many things ladies were and did that much of Ashley&#39;s childhood had been spent learning to stand like a lady, sit like a lady, walk like a lady, eat like a lady--it made her question whether being a lady was so desirable, but such thoughts were not permitted. &#39;A lady is dutiful and beloved of the Lord!&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you hurt? Do you need me to call 911?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Faithful did not draw the attention of secular authorities.  Had she been truly injured she could call the Faithful hotline for assistance.  Secular authorities like the police were important to keep the Faithless in line.  Lacking the Lord&#39;s love they couldn&#39;t be trusted to act correctly.  Ashley stood up and turned to face the boy.  As her shoulders pulled back into position she felt the band of her bra lightly pinch the bottom of her left bosom. She jerked at the sensation, her bosoms bouncing against the damp cloth.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t until they&#39;d started to grow that Ashley realized a Lady could still stand and act and speak correctly and still have some measure of influence over men.  At first she assumed it was just Faithless men, or boys still wrestling with the dictates of acting properly as a man.  She&#39;d come in the past year, as her bosoms continued growing larger than her Mother&#39;s, to realize that even Faithful men could be tempted with Beastly thoughts.  She didn&#39;t think what she did was the Beast&#39;s work.  She stood like a lady, after all, and if men couldn&#39;t keep Beastly desires from their minds that was their failing, not hers.  Her ready wit had long before shown her how to speak her distaste for the Faithless in the sweetest of Lady-like words.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t see how there&#39;d ever be anything I&#39;d need from you.&quot; She said and began to shrug.<br />
<br />
It was such a little thing, a rise and fall of the shoulders.  She&#39;d been doing it she was small, combined with the smile that let others know there was no guile or malice to her thoughts.  Once her bosoms grew that gesture opened the door to new possibilities.  Boys flushed and stammered, tripping over their own tongues to be polite and offer her those services it was proper for Men to accord to Ladies.  As time passed she saw how her instructors at school would drop unpleasant conversations, their sweat and blushes showing the Beastly thoughts within them.  The bobbing of her bosoms had not escaped her mother&#39;s eye either.  When Ashley was last fitted for bras her old ones were all replaced by ones designed to mask the size of her bosoms.  Nothing was said to her directly, but the message was clear.  It had taken some discrete work with scissors and thread to emphasize her bust once again, playing on her mother&#39;s frugal nature to avoid buying new tops as well.<br />
<br />
He should have turned red and slunk away, the Beast riding his thoughts.  But as Ashley raised her shoulders she felt the nub of her left nipple drag across the clingy moist fabric of her bra cup.  She aborted the action in shock, feeling both the pink rosebuds atop her bosoms tighten further.  The boy was watching them, watching her body, and she felt a stirring of heat between her legs. She knew cold weather and agitation, jogging or calisthenics, caused her &#39;rosebuds&#39; to tighten.  She&#39;d noticed men were more prone to beastly thoughts at those times.  If anything he ought to be even more ashamed to be gazing at her bosoms.  Instead Ashley felt as if her rosebuds were so tight and so trapped that they should be tearing holes through her clothes. She swallowed, feeling herself blush as the boy met her gaze.  The warmth and a growing slickness between her legs spiked with each breath which pressed her tight and swollen nipples against her clothes for the boy to see. <br />
<br />
Ashley could feel the Beast stirring; the prickling in her thighs, the ache in her bosoms.  When she was too young to know better the Beast had moved her to feel between her legs once while her mother bathed her.  She hadn&#39;t understood why she&#39;d been pulled from the bath and taken, dripping wet and cold to stand before her father.  The spanking and praying blurred with pain and the humiliation when she was not able to sit during meals the following days.  Both parents bathed her in cold water for some time afterwards, her father glaring and remote, her mother repeating the Lady&#39;s duties.  They kept the Beast from her, and in time she was allowed to bathe herself without their prayers. <br />
<br />
Their Faith taught it was good for children to be exposed to the Faithless, the better to understand the superiority of their community of followers.  Ashley had heard from other girls at school about their touching between their legs long before the &quot;health&quot; class had opened her parents&#39; eyes to the Beast run rampant.  The girls didn&#39;t understand they were giving the Beast access to their minds and souls, but still they were ashamed, saying how good it felt with downcast eyes and flushed cheeks.  As if pleasant sensations were any replacement for the Lord&#39;s love.  When she&#39;d first grown her bosoms Ashley had felt a thrill at the boys&#39; discomfort.  It shocked her to think their weakness to the Beast might weaken her as well, but she&#39;d schooled her mind, ignoring her body and the tempting sensations the Beast offered.  &#39;A Lady bathes in chill waters to keep the Beast at bay.&#39;  &#39;Only with her Wedded husband might a Lady know the Lord&#39;s love, expressed through the marriage bond.&#39;<br />
<br />
Ashley glared at the boy, the accellerant if not the instigator of her struggle with the Beast. She fought to school her thoughts, to ignore the tightness of her rosebuds, and the growing dampness between her thighs.  Had she been at home she would already be under a shower of chill water, letting it carry the Beast far from her body. &#39;A lady is gracious, even to those who are undeserving of grace!&#39;  If she waited, he would leave, surely. Unless the Beast kept him there looking at her body with his warm eyes-- Her body trembled as she fought.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really wish you&#39;d let me help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The words shattered her thoughts.  She felt the shards spiral away.  She still fought the beast for control, but perhaps this boy, Faithless though he might be, could aid her somehow after all.  She tried to think what to say, a Lady could no more admit to a man she was beset by the Beast than she could fly to the moon.  At worst it might rouse the Beast within him as well, and at best it would be an admission of weakness, of unladylike thought. She blinked, changing her glare to a look entreating aid.</p>
