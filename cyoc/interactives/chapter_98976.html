<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know,&quot; said Peter Talbot, while looking more closely at Karen Yuletide, &quot;I&#39;m really beginning to like you. So I&#39;m gonna be honest about a couple of things up front. First off, you do know that once you become a were—&quot;<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t change my mind later,&quot; said Karen, finishing his sentence. &quot;Whatever were I become, regardless of how the personal relationship goes, that&#39;s it. Becoming a were is a lifetime commitment. I read Jenny&#39;s copy of the Moon Lake handbook.&quot;<br />
&quot;That old thing?&quot; commented Peter. &quot;In some respects, that book is seriously out of date.&quot;<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; asked Karen, now a bit concerned.<br />
&quot;I know it mentions the three ways a normal can become a were, and trust me, from what I&#39;ve heard, sex IS the most enjoyable method. But it doesn&#39;t say anything about how we pro-create,&quot; began Peter. &quot;Besides all weres having a higher libido to some extent, the males are more... potent and the females more fertile. It has a more formal name, but that&#39;s why the were birth control pill was created. Otherwise, the world would have been overrun with weres decades ago.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right. I don&#39;t recall seeing anything about that in the book.&quot;<br />
&quot;There&#39;s one specially formulated for every were species, because were science still has yet to devise anything effective to tackle the problem from the male perspective. So, if our relationship does progress to the point where I make you a lioness, let alone <i>my</i> lioness, I must insist that you get a prescription. I&#39;ll even help you acquire and pay for it if necessary, but as much as the mating instinct is part of my leonine nature, I don&#39;t actually want to sire any cubs until after I graduate college and can get on my paws financially.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s understandable,&quot; agreed Karen. &quot;I do feel an attraction to you, but I&#39;m all for graduating first and starting our careers, although I don&#39;t want to wait <i>too</i> late in life for the other stuff.&quot;<br />
&quot;You do know that weres also have extended lives beyond that of a normal human being? So what would be &#39;old&#39; for a human would just barely be middle age for a were.&quot;<br />
&quot;So we could...&quot;<br />
&quot;Till we&#39;re at least 175 in real time, if not later,&quot; confirmed Peter.<br />
&quot;WOW! This is all so much to take in,&quot; admitted Karen. &quot;When I first came here and signed that non-disclosure agreement, I thought it was just a joke the college was playing on the Freshmen class.&quot;<br />
&quot;So you didn&#39;t come here because of any rumors concerning weres?&quot; asked Peter, staring at her.<br />
&quot;No. I may have a fur fetish, which is also the first time I&#39;ve openly admitted it in my life without someone else figuring it out first, but originally coming here was just to continue my education,&quot; explained Karen. &quot;My roommate Jenny being attacked by that rogue were-vixen—&quot;<br />
&quot;Harper,&quot; realized Peter. &quot;I heard about that.&quot;<br />
&quot;Anyway, when you came out of the storeroom and started posing this morning, it was a genuine attraction,&quot; said Karen, grabbing her sketch book to show Peter. &quot;I could never capture your eyes accurately—&quot;<br />
&quot;They&#39;re hazel. Gives me a bit of difficulty with being photographed and obtaining any formal IDs too,&quot; explained Peter, as he started looking at her drawings.<br />
&quot;But I just took one look at you and...&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Peter, holding up the last drawing of him in his human form, standing next to Karen at their wedding.<br />
&quot;Then, when you changed... I could feel my fur fetish stirring, but it was different this time.&quot;<br />
&quot;Different, how?&quot; asked Peter, looking at the drawings of his lion side with Karen as a werelioness.<br />
&quot;For once, I was in control. I wasn&#39;t some silly fan girl or lusting after something I couldn&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t have. I don&#39;t know if it was love at first sight, if such a thing actually exists, but I definitely felt an emotional bond toward you even before you transformed,&quot; confessed Karen.<br />
Peter never replied to her last statement, lost in thought while looking at the drawing of them as a happily married werelion couple, with their two cubs.<br />
&quot;Is there something wrong?&quot; asked Karen, moments later.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Peter, as he flipped back from the wedding drawing to the family drawing. &quot;I&#39;ll be the first to admit that I have absolutely no idea what the future holds, let alone for the two of us,&quot; he began, while handing the sketchbook back to Karen. &quot;But I am glad you were attracted to the man first, and can accept the lion,&quot; he added, before reaching across the table and kissing her.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Considering the hour and their relatively light class schedule that afternoon, Harry Jenkins decided to stop at his folks house for lunch with Jenny Harper.<br />
While they had yet to actually meet his fiance, his parents took to her right away, commenting about how cute a couple they made, what a lucky guy Harry was to find Jenny (even without Yvette Smith&#39;s interference and becoming werefoxes) and that they would have a great life together.<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll do everything we can to help with the wedding preparations too, although next Saturday really doesn&#39;t give us much time,&quot; said Mrs. Jenkins, a nice woman about Jenny&#39;s height, with a full head of gray hair and a few visible wrinkles.<br />
&quot;Besides the fact neither of us wanted to wait after becoming bonded life/mate&#39;s as werefoxes, we just thought Halloween would be appropriate Mrs. Jenkins,&quot; explained Jenny.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Lisa, dear,&quot; said Mrs. Jenkins, &quot;and don&#39;t you worry. Henry and I will do what we can,&quot; she added, while looking at her husband, an older man about her height.<br />
&quot;Based on what our son&#39;s been able to tell us, it&#39;s sounds like you&#39;re going to have a hard time with your folks even under the best of circumstances,&quot; said Mister Jenkins. &quot;There is a small Baptist church in Moon Lake. We could see about booking that for the wedding, which should ease things a bit.&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;d be grateful for any help you can give us Mis— I mean, Henry,&quot; said Jenny, before taking another bite of her sandwich.<br />
&quot;Which reminds me son,&quot; said Henry, turning to look at his son. &quot;Your mom and I have been thinking about what to give you kids for a wedding present, but hear me out before you answer. That floor space over the garage has been going to waste for years as just a storage area. I&#39;ve already talked to your brother about this, and he&#39;s willing to offer his construction firm&#39;s help as his wedding present to you two. What say we turn that space into an actual apartment? I can&#39;t guarantee we&#39;d have it done before the end of your honeymoon, and you&#39;d have to pay your own way in regards to utilities and such, but otherwise, would you be willing to live, rent free, next to your folks?&quot;<br />
Harry looked at Jenny, who just closed her eyes and slightly bowed her head. Then Harry rose as he said, &quot;Are you kidding? We accept!&quot; as he hugged his father.<br />
<br />
And hour later found Harry and Jenny back at the college. He had walked Jenny to her next class, but she was reluctant to part company with him.<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be all right honey,&quot; he said, while holding her hand and kissing her cheek. &quot;You can do this.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know, and I&#39;ll being you later this evening for dinner, but part of me still doesn&#39;t want to be without you.&quot;<br />
&quot;That just shows how strong our love and bond for each other is,&quot; pointed out Harry, before giving her a more proper kiss on her lips. &quot;Now you have a good time and go learn something.&quot;<br />
&quot;You too,&quot; she said with a smile, before entering the classroom.<br />
<br />
After World History 101 and then Introduction to Computer Programming 101; Jenny Harper walked over to the Student Union and asked to see a career counselor.<br />
&quot;What can I do for you Miss Harper?&quot; asked the lady, after escorting Jenny to her cubicle.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been giving a lot of thought to my future,&quot; revealed Jenny, as she sat down in the empty guest chair next to the counselor&#39;s desk. &quot;Right now, I&#39;m just taking basic classes this semester, because I was undecided about a major, let alone a career. But now I know what I want to do with the rest of my life. After what I&#39;ve been through recently, I want to help people. What courses would I have to take to earn a degree and become a licensed therapist like Doctor Frances Twist?&quot; she asked, with the strong confidence of the &#39;old&#39; Jenny.</p>
