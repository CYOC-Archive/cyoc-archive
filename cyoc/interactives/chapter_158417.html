<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Super Bowl was one of America&#39;s biggest sporting events, and for the most part many Animalians had got into it some extent as well. Some of it was from pets having watched games with their owners before being uplifted and picking up the sport and the enjoyment of it from their owners as well. Some were former players from the Lyre High School who had either gotten caught accidentally when the initial outbreaks occurred or converted willingly shortly after because of some attraction to the physique that male and female Animalians had, though of course this was also before many of them recognized that the build that most Animalians had against most Humans would have given Lyre an unfair advantage in competition. <br />
<br />
Though sports enthusiasts in Animalia also noted that as more people converted across the country, many of those restrictions would go down. As there would be enough Animalians that no one town or team would be made up beings who&#39;s average build was on par with an Olympic level Human athlete, but that hadn&#39;t occurred for the moment and as such most sports that Animalians were in would be limited to the specific Animalian centric competitions that Animalia and its respective colonies had become known for. Though, that didn&#39;t remove the interest in football, and  fair number of Animalians had made their way to Animalia&#39;s Great Hall to watch the game. The set up was a bit different from the Thanksgiving feast, and was also a bit smaller, since a fair number of families often stayed home for the football game or had their own small parties to go to, but this didn&#39;t mean that the main party was not without its moments.<br />
<br />
Of course some of those moments were a bit different from others. The main thing was with Kip. He&#39;d come to the party, largely as he&#39;d seen it as a possible avenue to meet new people who enjoyed football, something of a thing that he hoped would be good when he heard about how Animalians did like football, even if they couldn&#39;t play in any official capacity, yet. He found the Great Hall set up with tables and chairs and a large big screen, which normally displayed a repetition on where certain offices were in the building and foot notes on things that Animalia&#39;s City Council had voted on in their last session, was tuned into the game. He collected a plate put some apples, carrots, and lettuce on it and then picked up a bottle of water and made his way to find a spare seat, largely finding that nearly every other table was completely full.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell of a way to meet people,&quot; Kip sighed to himself as he sat down, setting his food and water on the table in front of him, &quot;come to meet new people and find that most tables are completely full up... And I don&#39;t want to intrude on anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren&#39;t intruding,&quot; came a feminine voice making Kip look up, to find six Mare Animalians, though they were each different horse breeds, standing before him. All had shirts on that supported sports teams, though none of the teams were in the Super Bowl, and one logos looked like it wasn&#39;t from the US, but Kip wasn&#39;t sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Kip said nervously, &quot;you&#39;re into football?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit,&quot; the first spoke and offered Kip her hand, &quot;I&#39;m Mary-Anne. These are my friends Sara-Jane, Elizabeth, Jessie, Vera, and Theresa. The game is only part of why we&#39;re here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The rest is to meet new people...&quot; Sara-Jane added, &quot;or meet with other friends that we&#39;d made... but Archie didn&#39;t want to come see the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be a shame... I&#39;ve never been a big fan of the Chiefs or the Forty-Niners, but it&#39;s still the Super Bowl. Gotta enjoy the game,&quot; Kip commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or the commercials,&quot; Vera commented, earning a series of giggles from the other five mares, which made Kip blink, but for the moment he let that be.<br />
<br />
And for the most part the game went fairly well and Kip enjoyed the plays made, and even some of the commercials were pretty good. The one he liked the most was the constant questioning on what qualified as &quot;later&quot; when it came to a guy wanting to clean a stain from his clothes. The six mare Animalians also made for fairly pleasant conversation, though as the game went on, Kip began to note a few things that were fairly far away from football in general or the game on the screen in particular. It wasn&#39;t necessarily bad, but it was a bit different from what Kip expected from a Super Bowl party or from those who were interested in football.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t too bad, as Kip had never met them before and thus some of the questions on where he was from, why he converted, and the things he was interested in made some degree of sense. It surprised Kip to learn that Elizabeth was actually from the UK and really had limited knowledge of American football. Most of the times when she did make a comment on the game, it was more a comparison to European football, what Americans called &quot;soccer.&quot; It gave Kip the opportunity to learn about the six that had joined him as he arrived and made pleasant conversation. That part wasn&#39;t too bad, but there were some points where they got into somethings that didn&#39;t quite relate to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what do you all think about Animalia?&quot; Kip asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s quite nice... gotten us a new start at life and getting to things we missed out on the first time around,&quot; Elizabeth commented with a small smile, &quot;and meeting such handsome young stallions like yourself and Archie have been most polite to meet and talk to...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re older...?&quot; Kip asked as he blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A few of us were,&quot; Theresa commented, &quot;and many Animalian women converted to be younger again. And with the rebirth that doing so brings... the actual age becomes less relevant than it was. I feel like I&#39;m in my twenties again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With better bodies than we ever had,&quot; Mary-Anne smiled as well, &quot;all some of the plusses of being an Animalian.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kip watched as the six leaned back in their chairs to shake the breasts side to side for a moment. The shirts they were wearing did cover everything completely, but it was hard not to notice the generous curves that all of them had. He felt a bit of interest in this, surprisingly, but given that he was adjusting to the fact that he would be becoming bisexual thanks to his own conversion and that he was at the party to see the Super Bowl... he was a bit uneasy with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... uh...&quot; Kip managed slowly, &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re all enjoying things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about you?&quot; Jessie asked, &quot;what do you like about Animalia?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly that people have been accepting of me,&quot; Kip answered, &quot;not being judgmental or anything... given how things went down with my conversion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t in that &quot;seven on four night&quot; were you?&quot; Sara-Jane wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;The group that wrecked a hotel room...? No, I wasn&#39;t in that,&quot; Kip answered nervously, &quot;I think that was entirely a bunch of college students that that group had picked up for their party.  My friends and I... well, it&#39;s more that we&#39;d rented an apartment that was tricked out for that sort of thing... I think the owner of the apartment had gotten things in order for it before the &quot;seven on four night,&quot; as they did pass regulations against mail orders of the Animalia Virus and conversions in remote locations outside of Animalia after that incident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh…&quot; Vera smiled, &quot;a slight rebel!&quot;<br />
<br />
The others giggled at that and left Kip looking rather nervous as he looked up to see the Chiefs score their go ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter.</p>
