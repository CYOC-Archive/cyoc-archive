<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a couple of minutes difference in between the departure of Eric and Spencer, compared to the departure of Nate and Kenya.<br />
As Adaeze walked to the curb with Nate toward her moped, he slung his backpack on and held her hand.<br />
&quot;I hope you weren&#39;t too wigged out by everything in there,&quot; said Nate.<br />
&quot;Wigged out?&quot; repeated Kenya, not understanding the term.<br />
&quot;Frightened?&quot;<br />
&quot;What? Oh no,&quot; Kenya assured him. &quot;Everyone within that house except for you, your brother and his girlfriend are consenting adults and even then, as active weres, you and Miss Spencer are technically legal, at least as far as sex is concerned. You know how it is with weres. But you were not... wigged out? Were you?&quot;<br />
&quot;Only in regards to the possibility of seeing my folks... active,&quot; admitted Nate. &quot;Since Eric and I have been old enough to comprehend such things, mom told us about her bi nature, and both of them explained to us about their open marriage; although even before we moved to Moon Lake and they became werefoxes together, mom&#39;s always had this... rule, for lack of a better word.&quot;<br />
&quot;Concerning?&quot; asked Kenya, mounting her moped while handing Nate the spare helmet, and anxiously counting the seconds until they were back at her house and she was mounting him.<br />
&quot;Dad helped mom realize and embrace her bi nature while they were both still in college. Because of that, mom will do almost anything imaginable with another woman and from what I hear, she has quite an imagination as it is. But dad is the only man that has ever gotten to experience her sexual talents,&quot; explained Nate, while mounting the moped behind Kenya and wrapping his arms around her waist.<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Kenya, as she started her moped. &quot;And you can reach higher,&quot; she added, while moving one of Nate&#39;s hands to her breasts.<br />
&quot;Definitely when we&#39;re alone honey,&quot; he promised, nuzzling her neck the best he could around her helmet.<br />
As they drove off back to her house, Kenya started wondering if there might ever be an opportunity to experience Mrs. Anderson with or without her husband, and what would be the best way to approach Spencer Lawson about some private time between consenting weres. Let alone if she could ever find a way to have Nate and/or Eric Anderson join in the fun.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Anxious to get under way and start the evening&#39;s true festivities, Martha and William Anderson, along with Evan and Maggie Lawson, hurried downstairs to the Anderson&#39;s house basement, shedding clothes and growing fur.<br />
By the time they reached the bottom step, two werefoxes and a werepanthress were already nude and stretching out to their complete fursonas, while Evan was taking the last of his human wardrobe off before releasing his inner werewolf to prevent damaging his clothing.<br />
Yet all were surprised to find not only were Samantha and Frances Twist already in the basement, nude and furry, but the married lesbian werecats in the middle of an argument!<br />
&quot;I love you and will always be yours, but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t try it,&quot; said Frances to her mate.<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; asked Martha, worried about her friends, but they both ignored her as they continued talking.<br />
&quot;But I thought you were wanting a more... what&#39;s the word? <i>Controlled</i> experiment,&quot; said Samantha.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Samantha. I won&#39;t force you to do anything you don&#39;t want to or are not prepared to do, but as a cat, I&#39;ve grown too curious. Besides, we&#39;re both on the werecat birth control pill,&quot; replied Frances, before turning to face the others. &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said Frances, facing Evan and William. &quot;If either of you are willing and you have your wive&#39;s permission, I&#39;d like to taste a cock.&quot;<br />
The smiles on the faces of the werefox and the werewolf as their penises rose out of their respective sheaths was a VERY positive response to Frances&#39; request.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
<i>I better talk to him now, while we&#39;re still alone,</i> realized Spencer Lawson.<br />
They were about a third of the way in between the Anderson and Lawson residences. Eric Anderson was carrying the lion&#39;s share (no pun intended) of their stuff, while his girlfriend just held what she could in her good arm.<br />
&quot;Eric,&quot; Spencer began in the sweetest voice she had. &quot;I was just wondering about something. You know what the word bi means, when it comes to sex, right?&quot; she asked.<br />
&quot;Yeah. It means a person likes both sexes, their own and the opposite one,&quot; he answered. &quot;Both our mom&#39;s are that way.&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; agreed Spencer, &quot;although I think my mom&#39;s feelings are a lot stronger than your mom&#39;s about that. While she&#39;s in love with and extremely loyal to my dad, most of her extra lovers over the last 5 years or so have been women.&quot;<br />
&quot;So? I may only be 14, but I know what&#39;s probably going on in my basement right now. My folks went to parties like that back in Minnesota all the time.&quot;<br />
&quot;They did?&quot; said Spencer in disbelief, now wondering about the possibility of ever experiencing both Martha AND William Anderson, as long as it didn&#39;t hurt her relationship with Eric. But she brushed those thoughts aside as she said, &quot;Well, I&#39;m just bringing this up because while that will be a totally separate conversation we&#39;ll have to have after we find out more about her, if we do eventually agree that Kenya is the one to help welcome you into were society, she might want a little quid pro quo.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean we&#39;d have to pay her?&quot; asked Eric, stopping to stare at Spencer.<br />
&quot;Yes, but not with money,&quot; she explained, stopping to look at him in return.<br />
&quot;Well, you did explain the completion ritual to me, so I figured that whoever inducts me would wind up taking my virginity too, although I still wish it could be you honey,&quot; said Eric, before kissing his girlfriend on the muzzle.<br />
&quot;Awww....&quot; said Spencer, now trying to keep from crying. &quot;That is so sweet. There might be a way to arrange that, depending upon who we eventually choose, but my point is that whether it&#39;s Kenya or another female were, she might want to... try me as much as you.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean Sapphic sex like our moms do?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Would you be willing to? Because there&#39;s no way I could actually ask or expect you to—&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you have any idea how sweet and wonderful you are Eric Anderson?&quot; asked Spencer. &quot;But what I&#39;m trying to tell you is that, while I&#39;m not as crazy about it as either of our mothers, there have been times when I have enjoyed being with another female.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh. I... OH!&quot; said Eric, finally realizing what Spencer was saying.<br />
&quot;Are we okay?&quot; asked Spencer, as Eric kept silently staring at her.<br />
&quot;What? Oh. Sorry. I was just trying to picture you with another girl,&quot; he admitted, blushing a beet red.<br />
&quot;I see the thought piques your interests,&quot; observed Spencer, seeing Eric&#39;s young penis strain to bust out of his pants.<br />
&quot;I guess in some ways, I take after my dad more than I realize,&quot; confessed Eric. Then he grew silent for a moment before asking, &quot;Does this mean I might have to do something with another guy?&quot;<br />
&quot;Only if you ever wanted to,&quot; Spencer reassured him.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t. I have nothing against Ben and Alex if that&#39;s what they want and love each other, but like Nate, I&#39;m straight,&quot; said Eric.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why I can&#39;t do it myself and we have to be choosy about who does welcome you into were society. I don&#39;t care what kind of were you eventually become, just as long you remain the Eric Anderson inside that I&#39;m madly in love with,&quot; explained Spencer, before hugging him the best she could with her right arm still in a sling and her left holding her backpack. &quot;The wonderful, caring, old fashioned style gentleman before me.&quot; <i>Who also wouldn&#39;t mind his girl getting a little honey once in a while as long as he gets to sample it too.</i></p>
