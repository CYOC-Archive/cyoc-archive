<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The mare’s eyes opened suddenly in her stall as the clicking of the big barn door sliding along its track stopped with a familiar metal clang.<br />
<br />
She leaned out of the stall window excitedly, expecting to see Jason, but was absolutely gobsmacked by the sight of Taylor in her robe approaching.<br />
<br />
“He’s told me everything,” Taylor called.<br />
<br />
The mare backed away into the farthest corner of her stall in a frenzied panic. A million horrible visions danced through her imagination at once. A shotgun going off and splattering her brains all over the wall. A humiliating tirade. A baseball bat to the knees. A bolt gun to the forehead. Being forced to leave the only home she had ever known. Losing Jason forever. Changing back without his seed and losing her new self. The glue factory. Being experimented on. Dissected. She screamed out loud, shivering in absolute gut wrenching fear.<br />
<br />
Instead, Taylor approached the stall and gently leaned in, seeing the horse shivering in the corner, as meek as could be. Her body language wasn’t aggressive or even annoyed. She held no instrument of violence. She only held the lantern.<br />
<br />
To the mare’s disbelief, the stall door opened, and Taylor beckoned her out of the corner for a chat with a wave of her hand.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, sweetie. It’s okay. I’m not going to hurt you. Come on out, now.”<br />
<br />
The mare raised back up to her full height and watched Taylor’s amazement as the horse left her open stall and stood in front of the lady with her ears back and her head held down in shame.<br />
<br />
“You really can understand now, can’t you?” Taylor whispered, her eyes wide in the darkness of the dimly lit stable.<br />
<br />
“Y-Yes, ma’am,” the horse whispered in reply, utterly submissive.<br />
<br />
The speech was shocking, yes, but Taylor could only stare in amazement and wonder.<br />
<br />
“W-Would you tell me what happened?” Taylor whispered. “Please?”<br />
<br />
“Y-You said he told you everything,” the mare trembled, her voice barely above a whisper.<br />
<br />
“I want to hear it again from you,” Taylor encouraged, gulping deeply. She was clearly upset, almost in tears.<br />
<br />
The mare winced her eyes and nodded. “He took me out for a ride. He stopped for a drink, took some water, and he became aroused. He had sex with me the first time, and little by little I started to get a little more aware and he started to... change. We did it again, and I got really intelligent and he... was... well, he was getting bigger. He did me a third time, changed some more, and after that I was almost able to speak. So we went again and... here I am.”<br />
<br />
Taylor’s eyes softened. She could hear the mortified shame in the mare’s voice and could feel her intense regret at what had transpired.<br />
<br />
“I wanted to call you Delilah,” Taylor replied gently, ignoring the entire story for the moment. “Jason wanted to call you Whirlwind, because you were very spirited. We had a silly fight about it and in the end, as a joke, we decided to call you nothing. That’s why you have no name. In fact, we literally have you registered as No Name.”<br />
<br />
The mare’s eyes fell on the floor and she took in a deep breath. “I-I’d really like a name. I think Delilah would be nicer than Whirlwind.”<br />
<br />
“I agree,” Taylor said, approaching Delilah and putting a gentle hand on her neck. “This is... remarkable. You... think it’s some sort of sexually transmitted... infection?”<br />
<br />
Delilah’s eyes widened and she took a step back, confusion evident on her face. “M-Mistress Taylor, with respect, ma’am... shouldn’t you be completely pissed at us? I don’t understand.”<br />
<br />
“He... couldn’t help himself, darling. I know he...” Taylor trailed off and shrugged, almost laughing. “Whatever was in the water got him... hot. He would never have done what he did to you otherwise. Maybe it was there beneath the surface. He’s always loved his animals. But... here we are.”<br />
<br />
“We... have to deal with it,” Delilah whispered, nodding her understanding.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm, yes,” Taylor slowly nodded. “Yes, we can’t take it back. I’m... I’m curious, honey, was it.. enjoyable?”<br />
<br />
The mare glanced around the stable sheepishly and finally looked back for a quick mortified nod, the distress on her face evident. She really didn’t want to talk about grinding herself off on a tree.<br />
<br />
“So... every time he... comes, things... progress?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, ma’am,” Delilah whispered, throat going dry.<br />
<br />
The human woman looked the horse up and down and her face screwed up into a strange amused smirk. She crossed her arms and nodded. “You... you always were quite a good looking mare, what with that jet black fur and white star, you know. I can see the attraction. Wouldn’t you be... more comfortable with your own species, though?”<br />
<br />
“Uh...” Delilah gulped, throwing back her mane from her eyes. “Well, the thing is, ma’am, my desire for... other horses, is, uh... decreasing.”<br />
<br />
“The more you’re with a human?” Taylor’s eyebrow raised. “You more you... change interests, as well?”<br />
<br />
“Y-Yeah.” The mare kicked the floor awkwardly. “I guess so.”<br />
<br />
“Fascinating,” Taylor whispered.<br />
<br />
“Uh, my hooves...” Delilah suddenly raised one of her front legs. “Ma’am, look at my hooves.”<br />
<br />
Taylor leaned in, placing a gentle hand under Delilah’s offered hoof and studied it in utter fascination. “It’s... it’s broken. Like...” the realization hit the woman and she gasped. “Like you’re getting fingers...”<br />
<br />
“Y-Yes!” The horse flicked her tail excitedly. “Exactly! I think I’m... becoming more...”<br />
<br />
“So he’s becoming more horse. And... you’re becoming more human.”<br />
<br />
“It seems that way,” Delilah gulped, feeling a deep flush under her cheek fur. God, this was embarrassing.<br />
<br />
“So... it must be... DNA.” Taylor stared in awe. “You’re mixing DNA. I wonder what the end result would be for both of you!”<br />
<br />
“We were too,” Delilah admitted, pleasantly surprised. “I... didn’t... didn’t expect to...”<br />
<br />
“No, no...” Taylor stepped forward, trembling a little. “I... I’m not going to stop you. I... want to see what happens.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my God...” Delilah’s eyes widened. “Really, ma’am? You’ll let us keep going?”<br />
<br />
“Yes!” Taylor’s blue eyes widened. “I don’t believe it, but... I know my husband loves me. And... something has developed between the two of you. Something that transcends mere sex. I... I’m okay with this. If I wind up married to a horse. Or... a horse man. Or... something. Or... or I’m part of some horse/human love triangle... I’m okay.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my God!” Delilah laughed hysterically, prancing on her hooves. “You can’t be serious? Really? We can all get along together?”<br />
<br />
“Y-Yes, darling!” Taylor realized, covering her mouth in a staggered laugh. “I... I think we can! I’m okay with this!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, mistress Taylor!” Delilah leaned in, placing her snout on the woman’s shoulder, tears falling. “I’m so relieved! I was scared you were going to hate me, or... or want me destroyed!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, Delilah, honey, noooo!” Taylor hugged the mare’s neck. A sudden realization met the woman and she blinked, caressing the horse’s big nose as she stepped back. “Can you spread it to me? Can I be changed too?”<br />
<br />
The mare gulped deeply and swayed on her hooves nervously. “I... I don’t know, ma’am? W-Would you...”<br />
<br />
“Well, if... if I have sex with my husband, in his current state, won’t I become infected as well?”<br />
<br />
“I would presume so,” Delilah admitted, gulping.<br />
<br />
“Would I turn more horse? Or would I bring him back to full human?”<br />
<br />
“I guess we could try,” Delilah whispered, eyes wide. “I hadn’t even considered the dynamic between you two...”<br />
<br />
“Hmm. And what if you and I...” Taylor rubbed her chin, looking the horse over. “Well, I kind of want to find out what might happen to us.”<br />
<br />
“Oh God...” Delilah went weak at the knees. “This didn’t go where I expected it to, at all.”<br />
<br />
“Me neither,” Taylor giggled. “And... I must admit, this is all strangely exciting, isn’t it?”<br />
<br />
“Listen, this is important.” Delilah suddenly stood up straight, realizing. “We were going to hold off to see if it reverses naturally. We don’t know what... will happen to us. And you should wait for any... you know.”<br />
<br />
“Mmm!” Taylor nodded. “That’s a very smart decision, honey. I’ll help you keep things under control. W-Would you like to see him?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, can I?” Delilah asked longingly, almost tearing up again.<br />
<br />
“Yes, of course, honey. Of course, my sweet Delilah. I’ll go bring him down to you. Just stay put.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, ma’am.” Delilah sniffed. “I’m so happy!”</p>
