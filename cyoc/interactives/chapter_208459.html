<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Somewhere close to 11:30 it happened, Jeff looked up from his notebook to find he was sitting at a table, Brad was before him, and as he looked back down, the notebook and textbook were replaced by a cold beer. <br />
<br />
Looking around the restaurant wasn&#39;t quite what he imagined, it was more of a bar that accommodated people who wanted to sit down an eat than an restaurant, but that suited Jeff&#39;s purposes even better. He recalled setting up that Brad would carry the conversation, acting and feeling as though everything is normal, with brief moments of horror as his original self gets to peek through, but not enough to cause a scene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, here we go, cheers.&quot; Brad picked up as though the waitress (barmaid?) just dropped the beers off. After the glasses clinked Brad took a few deep gulps while Jeff cautiously took a sip (despite knowing he had programmed himself to love it last night) followed by a more enthusiastic gulp.<br />
<br />
Jeff watched as Brad&#39;s changes began, he grew in height packing on muscle as bodybuilding for bodybuilding&#39;s sake took over his hobbies and pastimes. His face changed shape a little as he pushed out of puberty and became speckled with perma-shadow as thick, dark brown stubble removed any hope of being baby faced for more than an hour or two. Jeff knew a similar change was happening to him, but he was the only one set to be aware of the changes aside from Brad&#39;s brief realizations.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was pleasantly surprised to receive your invite.&quot; Brad offered, his voice was a full octave lower and Jeff noticed as Brad cleared his throat, surprised by how deep his voice was, &quot;Whose is that?&quot; he motioned to the beer in front of him. &quot;Yours.&quot; Jeff answered, as Brad&#39;s eyes locked with Jeff&#39;s the concern and confusion melted away, &quot;Right.&quot; the pair took another sip.<br />
<br />
Jeff wanted to be aware of his own changes but feel comfortable in his adopted body and role, so despite the business suit forming around him and his body becoming that of a 21 year old, it still felt as comfortable and normal to him as his blue jeans and hoodie. Brad continued to grow as he aged, his attire shifting to a muscle t and shorts. Despite the cooler autumn temperatures and being lean, his body now tends to &quot;run hot&quot; and the cooler temperatures are a relief.<br />
<br />
Something clicked in Jeff&#39;s brain a distant desire with a twinge of excitement, &quot;We should sit outside. I&#39;ve got a surprise.&quot; Jeff stood, collected his beer and turned to the barmaid, &quot;We&#39;ll take our meal on the patio.&quot; Brad followed. Reseating himself, Jeff pulled out two cigars and handed one to Brad, his eyes lit up with excitement. <br />
<br />
Jeff watched as Brad aged in high speed. Muscle kept getting added to his frame, and the pair chatted idly. The weather, a neat car that passed by. At one point Brad asked if Jeff was a friend of his dad&#39;s, looked around confused, until noticed the cigar in his hand, disgust and horror washed over him and then he was back to normal taking a few puffs a few seconds later. Jeff chuckled leaning back in his chair, realizing with astonishment, he himself had been smoking and drinking like it was second nature for the last 5 minutes or more, they were even on their second beer. <br />
<br />
As they finished their cigars the food arrived, Jeff got a burger, Brad got a side salad with just balsamic vinegar for the dressing, and 3 grilled chicken breasts on the side. The bartender asked if we wanted another beer with the meal, Brad ordered, &quot;a water for me, I hit my limit on carbs, and a Jack and Coke for my friend Gary here&quot;. Jeff looked at Brad confused until he noticed the look in his eye. &quot;Yes, please.&quot; Jeff said downing the last of his beer and remembering he liked that drink.<br />
<br />
Jeff had worked really hard to come up with and organize all the details. Finding the restaurant, making sure they had patio seating. Setting Brad up to be recognized as a regular here, finding a vacant house nearby Brad could occupy for a week, finding him a simple physical job and setting him up to love it enough to stay forever but always feel unable to get ahead. Jeff wanted to see Brad through the transition himself, his intent was to teach Brad a lesson not expel him to another life and hope his modifications worked as expected. Once he knows Brad is entrenched in his new life, he would regress back to a teenager for the last half of the day and nobody would be the wiser.<br />
<br />
But like Brad, Jeff wasn&#39;t gay and that was a major experience Jeff envisioned for making Brad better. His research brought him many places, testing the limits of his browser&#39;s safe search filters. He was trying to understand what needed to happen to make this all work together. One of the many tangents he came across was a &#39;fursona&#39; which gave him the idea of a &#39;gaysona&#39; or in his case a &#39;bisona&#39; which the device could bring to life and he named Gary... Like he crafted Brad&#39;s identity, he took as much care and time as he crafted his. <br />
<br />
Everything that Brad became was a turn on for Gary, and likewise Gary was specially equipped to please Brad. Brad&#39;s prostate shifted higher and higher, Gary&#39;s penis grew as Brad&#39;s shrunk and lost sensitivity, ensuring things only ever go one way. Jeff came up with: Gary Brown, 32, Commissioned Salesman, bisexual, Married to Sarah Brown. He had all the details specified including house, car, income and that Sarah is expecting. Jeff reasoned, part of why Gary is cheating is panic about fatherhood and being &quot;locked in&quot; as a family man when part of him wants men. It made sense to Jeff.<br />
<br />
Brad was continuing to age as the Jack and coke arrived. Hitting his mid thirties, Gary noticed flecks of silver beginning to appear at the back of his jaw and creep forward aggressively. Brad&#39;s size continued to increase slowly and steadily representing decades of coaxing his body to always be show worthy, lean, and stacked. Seemingly with each new gray hair or wrinkle when Gary glanced at his eating companion he was slightly more enamored with Brad...<br />
<br />
What Jeff didn&#39;t realize when he picked submissive bottom for Brad, and then set Gary up to be a near perfect match with him, the Chronivac fills in the blanks to make things work.<br />
<br />
When the pair finished their meal Brad had completed his transformation and was 53. Gary stood and made a display of pulling out the corporate card and paying for the meal. He tipped well and after signing said, &quot;Come on,&quot; walking to his car. Brad had walked due to the short distance from his home and followed without question. Gary knew where Brad lived, this was the 5th time they were doing this, despite his intent to stop.<br />
<br />
Gary stepped out of the car and tried the door to find it locked. Brad came around and opened it, the stench of stale cigarettes and air fresheners wafted out. &quot;You made me wait too long, On your knees, I&#39;m going to face-fuck you till you learn to be better.&quot; Gary commanded.<br />
The room shook as the 270 lb man of muscle, old enough to be Gary&#39;s father, dropped to his knees in delighted expectation in the center of the room.<br />
<br />
Jeff would be astonished by the cock and balls attached to his body but for Gary, its all normal. Gary did as he promised and when satisfied, he slowly pulled his cock out of Brad&#39;s mouth, gently smacking him across the face with it. &quot;I hope you learned your lesson... Bedroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Watching the behemoth that Brad was, jump at Gary&#39;s every command made him feel in control... Brad was leaning over the bed with his butt pointing at Gary. He didn&#39;t hesitate as he worked his penis into Brad and pumped vigorously. Clenching he would force his head to engorge in time at just the right moment, he knew exactly how to make Brad...<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Daddy, yes you got me!&quot; <br />
<br />
Victory, control, power, pleasure... all Gary&#39;s hotbuttons were simultaneously mashed in that instant and he was left hunched over Brad reaching up his shirt and feeling him up. He felled the Giant! He did that! &quot;I&#39;m your fucking Daddy!&quot; Gary whispered, eliciting a smile from Brad.<br />
<br />
Gary cleaned himself up and left without a word, lighting up a cigarette he got in his car and began returning to work. It wasn&#39;t until much later in the evening he got home. After a late dinner and a shower, Jeff started to resurface. Grabbing his briefcase he opened it up and found the emitter wouldn&#39;t turn on. To Jeff&#39;s horror he realized he left the device in his bag all day yesterday, connected it briefly as he uploaded this transformation, then put it back in his bag so he wouldn&#39;t forget it. After searching online there was no documentation, and more importantly, nobody was selling a power cord for a device that hadn&#39;t hit market yet. Gary being twice Jeff&#39;s age was much more familiar with a variety of cables and power cords but his memories didn&#39;t help.<br />
<br />
It then dawned on him he is currently trapped as a cheating husband, soon to be father, in a well paying job in which he has to constantly pander to people and find exhausting, with a domination kink over older himbos, and he doesn&#39;t know if he&#39;s ready or even wants to be a father. Jeff stepped outside, anxiously lighting up a cigarette, trying to find more info on Transdom Chrony-vacuum. &quot;He could really do with some time with Brad right now.&quot; the thought flittered through his mind unnoticed like his cigarette, as he focused on what search terms to try.</p>
