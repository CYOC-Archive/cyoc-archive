<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frances quietly made her way into the hospital, as so far Yvette Smith was still being held there, with a good many thoughts and questions on her mind. Most of it related on what to do related to Yvette&#39;s mental evaluation and all the consequences that had come about as a result of her capture. That had also only lead to further puzzles concerning her parentage and why she had suddenly stated that she was at least bisexual if not an outright lesbian, as many of those things had also conflicted with the battle that resulted in Yvette&#39;s capture. She remembered the almost self-righteous glare and sneer that Yvette had made at Martha when she realized the second werecat in the room with her and William was Martha Anderson and not Samantha Twist. That left a lot of questions that only raised her curiosity, and Frances did feel that answering them would help give a complete evaluation on the werefox&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
She had already gathered that Yvette did not have the greatest of childhoods, as her mother was rarely there and was rather demanding. That wasn&#39;t an effective way of parentage and only inspired Yvette to try and outshine her mother, though in the end the way she chose wasn&#39;t the best of choices based on the overall image of them. The libidos of were-beasts had lead to the adult entertainment industry not being seen as &quot;perverted&quot;  and &quot;trashy&quot; as it was elsewhere, but it wasn&#39;t something that weres everywhere raised to the highest thing. Yvette&#39;s mother had wanted Yvette to avoid getting sucked into that industry the way she had, but Yvette had made mention that her mother had rarely been there to really make the effort to fix that. That lead Yvette into going down a similar path to outshine her mother and further drove them apart. When Yvette finally realized that that business wasn&#39;t truly what she wanted, she&#39;d found that her engagement in it had bad consequences that lead her into selecting William Anderson as a potential husband.<br />
<br />
The big questions that Frances had yet to solve was related to why Yvette kept insisting that William was hers and was being mislead by Martha even after William had made it clear that he didn&#39;t want any more to do with Yvette, and what what had inspired her claim the change in her sexuality. Frances also felt that it would be good to get Yvette to know who her biological father was, but wasn&#39;t fully sure on what questions to work on first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Doctor Twist,&quot; one of the officers serving as the guards to Yvette&#39;s room, &quot;Making progress?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like to think so,&quot; Frances said with a polite smile. &quot;Though with only two scheduled days before the official sentencing will come... it feels like I&#39;ve uncovered more questions than answers and issues that she needs help and closure for, that as a doctor, I can&#39;t stand aside and let her be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can some of that other stuff wait? Or will it affect the sentence?&quot; the officer asked.<br />
<br />
Frances looked to the officer and sighed. The biggest part of the case related why Yvette couldn&#39;t let go of her obsessions and potentially if there was anything in her mind and thought process that made her flighty and prone to odd decision making. That dealt with her obsessions and her declaration of being bi if not an outright lesbian. She wanted to arrange for a meeting between Yvette and Bart as part of the revelation that Bart was not only her uncle but also her biological father, but that didn&#39;t directly relate to Yvette&#39;s sentencing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose it can,&quot; Frances spoke, &quot;but I&#39;ll need to talk with the DA, the judge assigned to the case, the police chief and a few other officers dealing with Bart Smith&#39;s case, and in contact with city jail&#39;s staff for access.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was something that Frances could count as lucky with regard to Yvette&#39;s case. With many crimes that could or would require prison sentences, Moon Lake had means to make sure that Moon Lake&#39;s secret couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t be used as a means to escape punishment for the crimes committed, but Yvette&#39;s case was different. Cases in Moon Lake where a criminal was to be sentenced to death or when the perpetrator had violated Statute 1-A, they couldn&#39;t be handed over to the state penal system. As executing a were, while possible, wasn&#39;t as easy or painless under the standard methods used outside of Moon Lake, and telling a prison manager outside Moon Lake that an incoming inmate had violated Moon Lake Statute 1-A would only lead to questions as to what was Statute 1-A. To deal with these issues, the police department  did maintain a facility that operated as the &quot;Moon Lake Prison&quot; that was altogether separate from the city jail. If her sentence was prison, Yvette would be sent to the Moon Lake Prison, which would keep her close enough that Frances might be able to arrange a meeting with her father.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get everything that you need,&quot; the officer said politely.<br />
<br />
Frances nodded and made her way into the hospital room to where Yvette lay. The werevixen was still handcuffed to the bed, but for the moment was finishing up the breakfast that the hospital staff had given her. She didn&#39;t even respond to Frances&#39; presence at first. Frances took that as the opportunity to get things ready for the session and sit down in the chair that was set near the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... are we getting close to the end?&quot; came Yvette&#39;s voice as Frances sat down, making her look up.<br />
<br />
Yvette had finished her breakfast and was looking to her.  Frances slowly nodded before she answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have only one more session after this one,&quot; Frances spoke, &quot;at least one that was scheduled... Though there are a few things I would like to do that will give you real closure...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you do that?&quot; Yvette asked, &quot;you have no reason to. I attacked a your neighbor... disparaged his wife and your friend... essentially gave your wife plenty worry over. Figured seeing me gone would be the first thing you&#39;d want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On some level, there is a part of me that would prefer that,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;but as a psychologist... it is my job to heal people&#39;s minds when they are sick or damaged. That applies to all and includes you. Perhaps some of that may help you get yourself together when you&#39;re released... if things come to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvette shrugged, while Frances put her notebook in her lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, we&#39;ve talked on your childhood, your relations with your family, and what made you target William Anderson,&quot; Frances began, &quot;yet, that isn&#39;t really the biggest problem...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t?&quot; Yvette raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not on its own,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;In fact looking for a husband and getting away the escort service could be a good decision and misunderstanding William Anderson&#39;s love for his wife in spite of whatever problems you may have noticed is understandable given how you grew up. The issue that creates the problem is the obsession you developed over William Anderson.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances watched as Yvette looked down, but didn&#39;t say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean he did reject your advances,&quot; Frances began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at first,&quot; Yvette answered, &quot; or at least not upfront with me. In fact in our first &quot;meeting&quot; I approached him, flirted with him, and essentially presented myself as available and then left. I didn&#39;t give him the time to say no to me. I just left... so if he said no... it wasn&#39;t directly to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Frances said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d decided what I wanted,&quot; Yvette answered, &quot;and figured I&#39;d try to get what I wanted. After all... even as a normal, he wasn&#39;t that bad looking... he had to be experienced... and as I said earlier, I didn&#39;t think his marriage was all that strong... like he didn&#39;t want to be there. I figured I could show him real love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvette looked down again for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what fueled my decision to jump him in the parking lot,&quot; Yvette answered, &quot;I figured that once I brought out his inner fox that he&#39;d see just how much I could love him and how good I could be to him...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But he resisted and college dean pulled you off of him,&quot; Frances finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Yvette nodded, &quot;and he rejected me directly when he completed transformation... I... I couldn&#39;t believe that he&#39;d bonded to his wife after everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that why you kept deciding to pursue him, even after rejection?&quot; Frances asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As in why didn&#39;t I just leave Moon Lake after my escape?&quot; Yvette sighed, &quot;At least not without William... I... I really can&#39;t say. I really can&#39;t. I... I just felt his stating of his bond was forced in some way... as he was wonderful in bed and his fox is lovely. I felt he could give me all that I wanted... if he wasn&#39;t loved at home... I could show him that I could love him far more than someone who&#39;d just yell at him for some reason or argue over things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances took her notes as this seemed to relate to Yvette&#39;s poor understanding of love, but it was getting more into Yvette&#39;s reasoning for why she obsessed over William Anderson so much.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that... that would let me show him I can be loving,&quot; Yvette said weakly, &quot;that I wasn&#39;t just some slut who&#39;d go looking for any man when &quot;mine&quot; wasn&#39;t there or something like that... Which seemed to be what many seemed think of me, thanks to my going to the sugar daddies and all that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You... you felt alone?&quot; Frances asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Yvette said weakly, &quot;All my friends from high school had boyfriends... a few were even engaged, one is not only happily married but pregnant besides... You have your wife. The girl that I&#39;d clawed had her mate... but me? I had no one... likely because of all dumb stuff I&#39;d done. William... he was the only one I could show that I was capable of loving in a way that meant something... and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvette actually sniffled for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose thinking that Martha was manipulating him and trying to get him from her was just something to give me hope,&quot; Yvette sniffled, &quot;that I&#39;d get real love...&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances wrote down her notes carefully. From the way Yvette had answered, it seemed as though Yvette wasn&#39;t necessarily so much obsessed with William Anderson as she was desperate to be loved in a way that she hadn&#39;t gotten before. Bart Smith was rarely, if ever, there and was only identified to Yvette as an uncle, that left her without a father. Her mother was around... but was never really there, either, which coupled with the demands that were made of Yvette didn&#39;t amount to much. Unless one believed the movie &quot;Pretty Women&quot; truly represented life for a hooker, it was doubtful than any of the sugar daddies she&#39;d gone to treated Yvette as anything more than a sex toy, or a potential sex toy. The fact that she went to them also ostracized her from many of those her own age... all while building their own happiness. That made Yvette desperate, and the issues she might have noticed in William Anderson&#39;s marriage fueled that desperation.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t really any form of insanity that Frances could name at the moment, but it was enough to help her understand why Yvette focused on William Anderson so much. She checked her watch, and noticed that the meeting had so far gone rather quickly. There was only on real question that would relate to the sentencing that might need answering, as to see if there was anything in Yvette&#39;s mindset that might indicate rather flighty behavior and if not that, than what did trigger her change in sexuality?</p>
