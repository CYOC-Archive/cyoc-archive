<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff grinned clicking the Invisible option. Not only could he change his head into anything, but he could ALSO make it invisible, with any of the other changes also taking place unseen? That was awesome. In fact, he didn&#39;t really care about making any changes to himself OTHER than the invisibility, now that he thought about it. He giggled as he thought of himself going around looking like the headless horseman or something. Then he remembered the &quot;detached&quot; option and realized he could actually BE headless. Deviously he clicked Submit.<br />
<br />
Jeff was shocked when his head tumbled off into his lap and rolled off into the floor. Ouch that hurt! Instinctively he raised a hand to rub the throbbing point of impact on his scalp, but the hand he raised went over the new empty space a few inches above his neck and felt nothing.<br />
<br />
Observing from his new point of view under the desk, Jeff noticed he could see his feet and lower legs in front of his eyes. Even though he had just fallen into the floor and bumped his head, he found could still feel his feet in the floor and his butt in the chair. Jeff stood up. He saw his legs straighten up and push the chair backwards; he saw his feet adjust themselves to take on his weight. One of them came forward a bit and actually bumped into his face! (Ouch again.) He felt every minute motion just like normal, but his vantage point didn&#39;t budge from the floor. A dizzy feeling washed over him as it sank in that he was seeing himself from the perspective of his head--his disembodied head!<br />
<br />
Quivering slightly, Jeff tried to figure out how in the world he was still alive. He could still control his body, and he was still breathing through his head. (The floor really smells horrible, come to think of it, thought Jeff. I really should clean here more often.) Maybe the Chronivac had opened some sort of spacetime portal between his head and his body. Maybe it had sucked him into some kind of ultra-realistic virtual reality and none of this was real. Maybe it manipulated the laws of physics in ways no one but the Trans Dem scientists understood. Just how powerful were they? Jeff crouched down to give himself a better view of his headless body. Seeing his neck there with nothing sitting on it was surreal. It felt like he was in a dream, or a hallucination of some kind. It almost felt like he was in a story and someone else was writing his fate.<br />
<br />
Jeff was snapped out of his existential crisis by an unsettling development: he was going blind! As the world started to fade out around him, Jeff&#39;s mind raced trying to understand what was happening to him. Of course, anyone else with him in the room would have understood immediately what was happening. Indeed, if Jeff had given himself a second head that was still attached to his body (which the Chronivac would have let him), then he would have seen with his own eyes what was happening: his head was fading from view. You see, however powerful the Transdem scientists may have been, and however well they might have understood the laws of physics, they did not (could not?) completely change the laws of optics. His eyes could no longer collect any light because all light was passing right through his newly transparent head. An invisible head could hear, feel, smell, and taste things, but it could not see. The software really should have warned Jeff about that... Oh well.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s heart was pounding in his chest. He felt lost and vulnerable. After all, he could no longer see where his body was in relation to his head! He reached forward with his arms and tried to feel along under the desk. At last he felt a hand touching his face. He got dizzy again when he snatched his own head up from the floor and clutched it against his chest. He realized just how bad it could be dropped his head and couldn&#39;t find it. Right now he couldn&#39;t even see the Chronivac to change himself back! Jeff&#39;s body just stayed there for a while, crouched in the floor cradling its invisible head, while the his brain tried to figure out what to do next.</p>
