<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Attention all units, we have a report of two males on the I-75 highway near the Mile 34 marker fornicating, please respond.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dispatch, this is Unit 5-18, I&#39;m not too far from there. I&#39;ll be there in less than five minutes.&quot; Scott responded through the radio<br />
<br />
Scott had always wanted to be a cop for as long as he could remember. While he became one five years ago, he can&#39;t help but feel as a 30 year old traffic cop that he is stuck in a rut. In some sort of attempt to try and change things he got a buzzcut to his black hair, but no luck. Before he realized it he made to the marker. Once he got out of the car, he found them pretty quickly, doggy style. While he had a decent amount of muscle himself, he was pretty surprised at how big the two of them were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Police freeze!!&quot; Scott shouted to the two guys on the grass. &quot;Take your cock out that guy, then get up with your hands up.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two men did as they were told and turned to face Scott. The one that was on top, who also had clean brown fairly medium length hair, stood at around 6&#39;5&quot; with pecs about the size of medium beaches balls, eight-pack abs, biceps the size of bowling balls, thighs that were like small trees and a still hard cock of 17 inches. The other one had messy blond short hair and while he wasn&#39;t as big but wasn&#39;t certainly nothing to sneeze at. He stood at 6&#39;1&quot;, about three inches taller than Scott, smaller pecs, six pack abs, biceps that looked like two basketballs stuffed together and a still hard cock of 12 1/2 inches. Scott couldn&#39;t help but notice that their chests were covered with cum. Didn&#39;t take a detective to know that they were going at for a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys are aware having sex like this in public like this is illegal right?&quot; Scott asked them both<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; The shorter blond one responded &quot;Of course not too many people bother staying on the highway this long. Right, big brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
The taller one simply nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I&#39;ve heard enough of that.&quot; Scott said pretty disgusted &quot;Hands behind you backs, both of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The shorter one looked like he was about to say something, but the taller one spoke first &quot;Go with it little brother.&quot; he said in a deep voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;okkkkkkkkkkk&quot; the shorter one replied, obviously not liking what was going on<br />
<br />
Both men started to put their hands behind their back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold it! I&#39;m not taking you two anywhere until you handle those first.&quot; Scott said pointing at their cocks &quot;Rub them off right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
The shorter one the grinned and said &quot;Whatever you say officer.&quot; He then grabbed his cock with both hands and started jerking off like crazy. The taller one merely grabbed his with his right hand and started to stroke at a fairly quick place. It didn&#39;t take long for the shorter one to fall onto his knees out of sheer pleasure. He also couldn&#39;t seem to let out a moan with every stroke, while the bigger one was just letting out some animalistic grunts after every couple of strokes.<br />
<br />
&quot;For people who claim to be brothers, they certainly couldn&#39;t be more different in how they do things.&quot; Scott thought to himself as he decided to sit down<br />
<br />
&quot;Big bro...&quot; the shorter one said<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too.&quot; the taller one<br />
<br />
They both came at the same time and a lot further than Scott had expected. To his surprise the shorter one&#39;s cum landed his lap while the taller one&#39;s cum landed on his face. Scott was so disgusted and embarrassed by what just happened he didn&#39;t notice that he accidentally swallowed some of it. When he stood, he couldn&#39;t believe how much the two of them came. On the plus side, both of their cocks went soft.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright now that is done, time to take you two in.&quot; Scott said taking out two pair of handcuffs<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t be sure about that.&quot; the shorter one said as he stood up &quot;Right big brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you--&quot; Scott then cringed as he doubled over and grabbed and held on to his stomach with both arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see my younger brother and I were actually infected with that gay male virus a couple of days ago. And we just infected you with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott wanted to respond to that, but he felt his arms break out of their sleeves and his feet completely tear his shoes and socks apart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at that big brother! His arms are already as big as mine! How big do you think he&#39;s going to get?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No clue, but we&#39;ll find out soon enough. Who know maybe I&#39;ll get an older brother too.&quot; the taller one said as his cock rose again to its full 17 inches. The shorter one&#39;s cock has quick to follow suit. They almost immediately went back to how they were when Scott first found them. As for Scott, the transformation seemed to pick up as he watched the two brothers go at it.<br />
<br />
“Arrhh…. Arrrhhhhhh…. AAAAARHHHHHGGG!!!” Scott screamed out as his growth ripped through all his clothes. The transformation ended as quickly as it began. As Scott got back up, there was only one thing on his mind, joining the two brothers. The only question was how would he be accepted?</p>
