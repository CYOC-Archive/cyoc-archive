<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before any of us knew it, the time on the clock read 11:00.  When I noticed I said, “So does Joyce win for being closest if they don’t come back in the next 30 seconds?”<br />
<br />
“Nah,” said Joyce.  “They’ve surprised all of us.”<br />
<br />
Rachel said, “When they come back, nobody say anything.  If they want to tell us, they will.”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” I agreed.<br />
<br />
A few more minutes passed and the girls’ work on our nails was complete.  “How do you like your nails?” Rachel asked.<br />
<br />
I held my hands up in front of my face with my fingers spread wide apart.  I gazed at a pair of hands that had radically altered in the last 24 hours.  Now that my fingernails sported a bright red color, they looked completely feminine, even though I sensed that they weren’t quite done changing.  I smiled widely and practically squealed, “Ooh, I just love them!”  My voice cracked at the end of my exclamation.  Rachel and Joyce laughed.  “What?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Your voice cracked,” said Rachel.<br />
<br />
“I know,” I said.  “It probably will continue to, now won’t it?”<br />
<br />
Scott cleared his throat loudly.  “Yes, it will,” he said.  Again his voice sounded higher pitched.  “I can already tell mine is changing,” he added as he rubbed his throat.  “I love my nails, too.  You’re awesome.”<br />
<br />
“Why, thank you,” said Joyce with an appreciative smile on her face.  <br />
<br />
Just then Carl and Pam burst back into the apartment.  Pam was leading the way and she held Carl tightly by the hand.  In fact it looked like she was dragging him behind her.  I immediately noticed two things.  First of all, both of their hair were in a state of dishevelment.  Secondly I couldn’t help but notice the way my sister’s breasts bounced up and down when she walked faster.  I honestly couldn’t wait to know what that would feel like.  <br />
<br />
“40 minutes,” Rachel remarked.  “We all lose.”<br />
<br />
Pam and Carl ignored what she said.  “OK, it’s time for another picture session,” said Pam.  “Right now.  Up, up, up and get those clothes off,” she demanded of me and Scott.<br />
<br />
“What’s the big hurry?” Scott asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you’ll see,” Pam answered.<br />
<br />
We all looked at Carl.  “You’ll see,” he said knowingly.<br />
<br />
I knew better than to argue with Pam when she was in such an excitable state.  It was about time for another progress report anyway.  We all got naked pretty fast considering how few clothes we still wore.<br />
<br />
During this session, the girls seemed to spend a particular amount of time focusing on our genitals.  Rachel actually stopped taking pictures for a moment and said, “Oh, would you look at that?”<br />
<br />
“See?  See?” Pam said with the eagerness of a hyperactive chipmunk.<br />
<br />
Scott and I looked at Carl who could only shrug his shoulders.  Rachel quickly finished taking the pictures and we put our few remaining clothes back on.  Our review of the pictures revealed a few new changes.  Hair was still growing longer and limbs were still becoming thinner.  Carl’s waistline was still shrinking.  Scott and I were now getting thinner across our midsections, too.  Our nipples were larger, but there were still no signs of breast growth.  Our faces didn’t seem to have changed at all either.  Scott and I still seemed to be getting shorter and Carl was a little shorter than before as well.  <br />
<br />
The most dramatic changes were just below the waist.  We all had noticeably larger hips and our asses were becoming femininely round.  Meanwhile our penises were probably about as big as when we were ten years old.  But that wasn’t the most dramatic changes.  The pictures clearly showed that just below our shrinking members we had all developed vaginal openings.<br />
<br />
“So that’s why you were so excited,” I said to Pam.  She just grinned at me.  <br />
<br />
Joyce ran out to the kitchen and came back with a bottle of booze.  She poured out six shots.  “This calls for a commemoration of the moment,” she said as she handed the glasses to us.  She held hers up and said proudly, “To our pussies!”<br />
<br />
All of us, including Carl, burst out laughing and agreed, “To our pussies!”  We all downed our shots.<br />
<br />
“Can we do this again when our tits start growing?” asked Scott.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yes,” said Joyce.<br />
<br />
We all sat down again and looked for something to watch on TV.  Finally Rachel was the one to ask, “Did you find what you needed, Carl?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm?  Oh…um, no,” he said.  “I didn’t need it anyway.”<br />
<br />
“You were gone a long time,” Rachel said in an obviously baiting manner.<br />
<br />
“Were we?” Carl asked without emotion.  He kept glancing at Pam.  Pam, however, ignored him because she was in charge of the remote control and flipped through the channels.<br />
<br />
“Yes, you were,” answered Rachel.  “That’s OK, you didn’t miss much.”  <br />
<br />
A silence hung over the room for a very awkward minute.  Joyce broke the silence as she stood up and said, “Be right back.”  She cast a quick glance at Scott before she disappeared down the hall.  A few seconds later Scott stood up without saying a word and likewise disappeared down the hall.<br />
<br />
Pam continued to flip through channels while Carl appeared uncomfortable in his seat.  I looked at Rachel to see that she was looking at me.  She quickly darted her eyes in the direction of my bedroom.  “I’m going to my room for a minute,” I said.  I wasted no time in hurrying to my room.  I barely noticed that the bathroom door was closed.  Once in my room I took off my shirt and waited on my bed.  Spread out on my bed I saw just how small my penis had become.  I wondered if I could even still use it.<br />
<br />
As I pondered that thought Rachel entered the room and closed the door behind her.  She removed her bra and panties without saying a word.  She crept onto the bed and slowly slid on top of me.  We started off with a heavy session of making out.  I couldn’t resist gently massaging her breasts as we did.  She moaned lightly in approval.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of that fun she said, “Let’s test a few things.”  She moved her hands down to my chest.  I wasn’t surprised when she began to massage my chest and eventually focus on my nipples.  They responded to her actions by growing noticeably stiff.  Without hesitation I moaned several times.  “Ooh, you’re a sensitive one,” she teased.<br />
<br />
“It’s just so…different,” I said.  “But nice.”<br />
<br />
“We haven’t even started yet,” she said.  She moved down to my lower body.  I noticed that my penis had become aroused again.  It certainly felt hard but it was now so small that it was hard to tell.  However Rachel didn’t focus on my penis.  She was going after my new part.  “Let me know if you feel any pain,” she cautioned.<br />
<br />
She rubbed my nascent vagina.  The feeling that it produced almost knocked me unconscious.  I felt a jolt throughout my body that started there and went all the way to my fingers and toes.  I let out a load moan in a much higher than normal pitch.  This only made Rachel smile deviously.  Then she began to tease and taunt me.  “Ooh, sounds like I’ve got a screaming little bitch,” she said.  “I’d bet you’d like to feel that again.”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” I managed to barely whisper.  She obliged and rubbed it again.  The feeling it produced was much the same.  “Oh, god, yes,” I moaned.<br />
<br />
“You can’t resist this, can you?” she teased.  “You are becoming my little bitch.”  She rubbed again.<br />
<br />
“Yes, yes,” I moaned in approval.<br />
<br />
She leaned down closer to my meager penis.  “Look at your poor little manhood,” she said.  “I’ll bet it wants to be used.  But it just can’t get the job done anymore, can it?”  She rubbed my vagina again.  Again I moaned in approval.  “You’re not a man if you can’t use your cock,” she said as she rubbed me again.  “If you can even still call this a cock.”  She rubbed again and I moaned again.  “Come on,” she said.  “Can’t you come on me, little cock?  I’m right here.  I dare you to come all over my face.”  She rubbed a few more times.  I could barely think straight.  She was in complete control of me.  “Poor little bitch,” she said.  “You’re not a man anymore, you’re my bitch, aren’t you?” she taunted as she rubbed again.<br />
<br />
“Yes, yes, I’m your bitch,” I whispered.<br />
<br />
“What’s that?” she said as she continued to rub.  Only this time she kept rubbing and didn’t stop.<br />
<br />
“I’m your bitch,” I said louder.<br />
<br />
“One more time?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, fuck, I’m your bitch!” I practically screamed.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yes you are,” she said.  “So why don’t you come all over my face, you little bitch?”  At that moment I felt her take her fingers and actually push them inside my vagina.  I couldn’t believe it had formed that much already.  Even though she could not penetrate very far, the feeling was simply too much and I felt my body climax.  I felt a tiny little bit squirt out of my pathetic little penis.  “Ooh, there’s my little bitch,” she said with satisfaction.  I also felt something in my vagina.  I thought it must have been my first female orgasm.<br />
<br />
The whole time Rachel rubbed at my new womanhood caused me to close my eyes.  I now opened them.  I saw her wipe a couple lines of semen off her face with her finger.  She sucked them off seductively.  The last line, however, she kept on her finger and forced it on my mouth.  “Taste yourself,” she said.  Feeling that I didn’t have a choice I did as she asked.  I will say that was certainly the strangest thing I’d ever tasted in my life.  “Good girl,” she said.  “Now you’re a good little girl for drinking a man’s cum.”  Her continued domination of me was becoming more and more surprising.  But I didn’t object to it at all.<br />
<br />
She proceeded to straddle me and position her pussy over my face.  “Now make me come, you little bitch,” she said.  I felt just like a complete submissive and immediately obeyed her command.  I was still in such a state of arousal that I wanted to please her desperately.  “Ooh, yes, that’s it, bitch,” she kept saying as my mouth and tongue worked over her pussy.  She had positioned herself so well that my hands were free.  Without thinking about it at all my hands went to my chest and I began to tease my nipples.  I was disappointed that they weren’t full grown breasts yet.  I so very much wanted them to be.  I remembered what Rachel had said yesterday when she hoped I’d end up with big breasts.  I wanted them, too.  I wanted to have two huge, beautiful breasts.  <br />
<br />
While I fantasized about my changing body I was able to make Rachel climax.  The taste of her pussy was immensely pleasurable to me.  Whereas I had felt strange doing this to her just last night, now I felt like I’d been doing this for years.  Rachel came with a scream of delight.  By this point I was pretty sure the other four could give a play by play as to our interaction.<br />
<br />
Rachel moved off of me and laid down next to me.  We both needed a few minutes to catch our breath.  “Joe, please tell me I didn’t go too far,” she said after a pause.  “Please tell me you were OK with that.”<br />
<br />
“That was amazing,” I said.<br />
<br />
“You’re not mad?  You’re not angry?” she asked.  Her voice told me she was very concerned that I was.<br />
<br />
“No,” I assured.  “Why would I be?<br />
<br />
“Because,” she said.  “I don’t know what came over me.  I’ve never done that before.  It was just that…I don’t know.  I felt empowered.  I would never be able to do that with A…”  She caught herself from saying her ex’s name.<br />
<br />
“It’s OK,” I said.  “I honestly liked it.  No…I fucking loved it.”  I realized that was the truth.  I did immensely enjoy the way she’d taunted and dominated me.  <br />
<br />
“Really?” she asked.  She smiled but she didn’t seem ready to believe me.<br />
<br />
“Really,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Would you…mind…if we did that again?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Well,” I said, “We won’t be able to do it exactly that way again.”<br />
<br />
She asked, “Why not?”<br />
<br />
“Because I won’t have a cock for much longer, silly,” I laughed.  She laughed too.  “Seriously, though, I think that was great.  If you want me to be your bitch, I’m willing.”<br />
<br />
“This is going to be an adventure for both of us,” she said.<br />
<br />
I smiled at her and said, “It has been so far.  I can’t wait for what’s ahead.”</p>
