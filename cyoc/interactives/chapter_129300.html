<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty surrendered himself to Narissa as she turned the heat up in the shower and hissed as hot water cascaded down her snout and over her warm lizardy flesh. Soon there was a healthy steam as the now young reptile girl lathered her hands in white soapy bubbles and began caressing and massaging Ty in the same way he had pleased her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm.&quot; She moaned, paying special attention to tugging his recently orgasmed member in her fingers. &quot;I kind of like being a little smaller than you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah?&quot; Ty grinned, his nerves accentuating every feeling his reptile lover gave to him, her particular attention to his cock sensitizing it further to the feel of her smooth leathery palms. &quot;How come?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because everything is at my scale.&quot; She smiled, flicking out her tongue playfully as she eagerly washed away the soap from Ty&#39;s body, ensuring he was perfectly clean and pristine from head to toe. Her hand never left his shaft as it began to fill and throb in her grip once more, her slim reptilian fingers gently gripping and squeezing it as it returned to full size.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful.&quot; Ty whispered gently, reaching forward and gently rubbing his hand over the reptile&#39;s cheek. She averted her snout in a blush and tugged him a little harder as he grew firm in her hand, reaching full erection once again. &quot;I could never have imagined such a beautiful creature.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it!&quot; Narissa giggled in embarassment, and then realized she was embarassed. Strange, she thought, she wasn&#39;t usually so flustered in her emotions. Ty must have seen her sudden concern, so she met his gaze again, releasing his cock. &quot;I... I think the longer you keep somebody changed the more their mind warps.&quot; Narissa explained, suddenly worried about herself. &quot;I&#39;m losing my adult composure. Uh, control of my emotions. Krissy surrendered to reptile lust. She became a big lusty beast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get it. I&#39;ll change you back, then.&quot; Ty reassured her cautiously, his boner going down with sudden concern for his lover. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to change like that. I like the Narissa you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... let&#39;s... experiment.&quot; She said curiously. &quot;I kind of want to know how far it can go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean? The mental change?&quot; Ty asked, leaning across Narissa to turn the water off. Their sexy shower had become a little cooled down and awkward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah.&quot; She blushed deeper, becoming a little meeker by the second. &quot;I... guess I should explain a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Ty said, stepping out of the tub and grabbing a towel for himself and the lizard, watching the two sleeping tinies on the counter continue to do so without end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; Narissa shook her head, as if trying to clear it. &quot;This is fucked. I can feel myself turning back into my younger self. I&#39;m losing... confidence. Strength. I feel more like my age.&quot; She waved it away and took the other towel, wrapping it around her chest and letting it hang down to her knees. &quot;So, like, my people, we take a long time to mature. And that means sexually, too. We don&#39;t really... do stuff. Like we just did. Until we&#39;re adults. Or close to adults.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Ty said in realization. &quot;So... it&#39;s...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel kind of dirty.&quot; She said sheepishly. &quot;A proper saurian girl controls her... urges.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty stared in both amazement and a sort of morbid fascination as he watched Narissa the unquestionably confident and sexualized lizard woman regress by the second back into an awkward and younger version of herself. Even her movement seemed to be getting a little unsure and nervous, as she turned away and blushed as she dried her naked body.<br />
<br />
&quot;C-Can you stop staring at me like that, Ty?&quot; Narissa said sheepishly. &quot;I-I don&#39;t like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Ty turned away, wondering how far he should let it go before the &#39;experiment&#39; ended.<br />
<br />
Narissa seemed to be entering some kind of haze. He could see her fading gradually into a young girl, no longer the big strong lizard but a rather confused and decidedly out of her element foreigner. It was strange.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; Narissa turned around again, averting her eyes from Ty&#39;s naked body. &quot;C-Could we get some clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, of course!&quot; Ty offered, taking the reptile&#39;s hand and turning in startlement as she pulled away sharply.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sorry, uh... Ty.&quot; Narissa whispered meekly, as if trying to remember his name. &quot;My father says that I am not supposed to let boys lead me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Ty blinked, suddenly well aware of the now nervously shifting Narissa avoiding eye contact with him.&quot; &quot;Uh... I&#39;ll get you some clothing.&quot; He offered, staring in shock. He... could just change her back into old Narissa. Couldn&#39;t he?<br />
<br />
Quickly, Ty ran to his room and rifled through his drawers. He quickly dressed himself in fresh jeans and a shirt, and returned to the now trembling Narissa, who was looking around the bathroom in obvious disorientation and fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Where am I?&quot; The lizard said, in a newly accented voice as she continued to regress. &quot;What is this place?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You&#39;re in my house.&quot; Ty said nervously. &quot;With... me. I brought you a shirt. It&#39;s a little big, but it should cover you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Narissa nodded, her accent growing thicker, as if she was trying to speak english from the back of her throat, a strange guttural rasp behind her words. &quot;Yes. Thanks to you, huu-man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty backed away and stared at the lizard as she continued to degrade and degrade. He actually saw the moment when her mind blanked and reset itself to her correct age, her eyes momentarily flickering and her expression going strangely distant. She threw his shirt on herself and her tail feel to the ground as she looked around as if seeing the room for the first time. Which technically, she was.<br />
<br />
Narissa turned to Ty, tipping her snout to the side, and looked him up and down in strange fascination. Because she was seeing a human being for the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Et rarrgh?&quot; Narissa asked, pointing to Ty and then looking down at herself in intense confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... w-what?&quot; Ty blinked. Had he been a powerful sorceror or a skilled changer, he would have known that trouble was looming ahead and Narissa had fully regressed into a young Saurian teenager in both body and mind, but he had barely scratched the surface of his abilities, let alone control them, let alone have that much foresight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... s-shirt.&quot; Ty pointed to his own t-shirt, pulling it for emphasis, and pointing to Narissa. At least he correctly guessed why she was confused.<br />
<br />
The young lizard girl looked up at him, pointed to his own shirt dangling over her hips and part of her tail, at least hiding her shame. &quot;Sssshhhriiii?&quot; She queried in a deep hiss.<br />
<br />
She stared at Ty, and had he known Saurian customs, he would have realized that Narissa had put two and two together and realized she was wearing Ty&#39;s shirt. Although she didn&#39;t know who Ty was, what he was, or where she was, only that she was wearing a native&#39;s clothing, couldn&#39;t remember anything beyond the last five minutes, and being an intelligent and deeply ceremonial young lady, had basically assumed Ty had captured her, drugged her, undressed her, and put her in his clothing.<br />
<br />
It was a surprise then, as the young lizard launched into an agressive tirade of hisses and growls as she advanced on Ty admonishing him with a wagging finger. &quot;Esssskrrrgh!&quot; She yelled. &quot;SSsrithissgggrr!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh!&quot; Ty backed into the hallway, praying Narissa didn&#39;t see the other two on the counter, which thankfully she hadn&#39;t as she passed by still chewing him out in her native language.<br />
<br />
Things took a turn for the worse as Ty tried to change her back. Quickly. For a moment, Narissa seemed to stagger. Her whole body throbbed and she momentarily began to grow in size and development, which startled her, but it didn&#39;t take. Her change stopped, almost fighting against itself, and she instantly shrank back into her younger body. This was a threat, of course. She didn&#39;t understand, but she knew how to defend herself. The young reptile roared and pushed her hand into Ty, throwing him against the wall with her full strength and momentarily knocking him silly.<br />
<br />
When Ty regained his senses, he saw Narissa picking up the black rubber of her jumpsuit and tapping it in a panic. Quickly, she threw off his shirt and hurriedly pulled on her jumper as it expanded to meet her form, and as Ty rose, Narissa hastily &#39;zipped&#39; it and began stepping back towards the stairs, analyzing her escape route and watching Ty at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rissa!&quot; Ty held out his hand, almost in tears. &quot;Please! Stop! Something&#39;s wrong!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Saurian stopped dead in her tracks at the top of the stairs and lowered her neck defensively. &quot;Nnngeerissay?&quot; She said cautiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Narissa.&quot; Ty gasped, the wind knocked out of him slightly. &quot;You&#39;re Narissa.&quot; He pointed to her and motioned in exasperation. &quot;You&#39;re... you&#39;re Narissa.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this, the lizard&#39;s confusion only deepened. She seemed totally startled as she stood nervously. Slowly, carefully, she nodded, pointing to herself and gulping. &quot;Raggg.&quot; She growled, rolling the r noise across her tongue. &quot;Nnngerissay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty took the moment of calm to try again. Bring her back, he willed. Please, please, please bring her back.<br />
<br />
Again the reptile staggered slightly, and gasped sharply, raising her arms, as she began to expand back to a lizard *woman.* Ty held his breath, continuing to will the change, and watched with uncertainty as the reptile grew and grew forward, her jumpsuit adjusting to her growing size comfortably. At around six feet tall, Narissa lowered her head and gasped in relief, seemingly about to fall down the stairs, and Ty leapt forward to grab her hands, pulling her forward out of danger. She hadn&#39;t grown all the way back to her full self.<br />
<br />
Ty met the lizard&#39;s eyes with paniced tears and she looked down at him in renewed confusion. &quot;Ty...&quot; She whispered, looking around quickly, eyes darting, and furrowing her brow ridge. &quot;What&#39;s... we were in the bathroom. I was little.&quot; She looked down at herself and tugged her jumpsuit. &quot;I&#39;m dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thank God.&quot; Ty threw his arms around her and held her tight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey!&quot; Narissa said softly. &quot;What&#39;s this? What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You... I thought I fucked you up.&quot; Ty said in relief, letting out a huge sigh. &quot;You... you... changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I got younger.&quot; Narissa blinked in confusion. &quot;You...&quot; To both their sudden jarring terror, they realized Narissa was shrinking back down again. &quot;Uh oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Ty backed away, watching as the lizard began to regress again and was clearly struggling to keep her mind from fading back.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-Ty!&quot; Narissa said in alarm, through clenched teeth and horrified eyes. &quot;What... is...&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty focused his will again, urging Narissa to grow back, and gritted his teeth in panic as she did so much more slowly than before. He could feel himself fighting against something that was distant but very real, as if he was trying to force her to change back but something didn&#39;t want him to. They both took quick and scared breaths as Narissa returned to full size and her adult age once more, but very quickly she was beggining to shrink back down again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!&quot; Narissa cursed loudly, clearly not understanding. &quot;This feels realllyyyyyy fucky, Ty! My essence is... it&#39;s wrong. I&#39;m me but I&#39;m not me. I&#39;m trying to become something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I do?!&quot; Ty had lost all sense of calm, falling into full blown anxiety as he tried once more to grow Narissa back, finding he could only raise her back to just a little over six feet, and he could feel her body fighting against him, trying to become younger.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Narissa&#39;s face darted up and she gasped. &quot;Let me change myself back! You took that away! Hurry! Hurry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck!&quot; Ty realized, nodding, even as Narissa began to contract back, about to permenantly become her young self again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyyyyy!&quot; Narissa groaned, shrinking all the while. &quot;This is it! I can&#39;t change back after this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty focused all of his power. Which such force that his eyes and nose began to bleed. Ignoring the terrifying feeling of his own blood pouring down his face, he took a deep breath, grunted through immense pain, and gave Narissa back her ability to undo his changes. He hoped it worked, as he blacked out completely and collapsed to the floor oozing blood.<br />
<br />
Narissa felt herself locking down into another life, another timeline, another version of herself, something she had already lived, and absently had a moment of resigning herself to her fate as her adult mind and thousands of years of knowledge began fade away into a scared young Saurian girl who was nowhere near the merchant space fleet her dad worked with. She reduced to pinprick of light in her own head as her body merged with her soul and began to enter the third dimension as one.<br />
<br />
And then she screamed. Narissa let out a terrified scream as she unfolded from herself and her will and mind returned in full. The young Saurian girl grew and grew back into a 7&#39;2&quot; tall Saurian woman. She fell forward on her hands and knees, the fresh feeling of resetting her entire soul&#39;s development the most terrifying thing she had experienced. Once she got her bearings and seperated her timelines once again, she began to calm her panicked breathing. And then she saw Ty lying face down in a growing pool of blood.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; She cried, pulling herself forward frantically and flipping Ty over, tears in her eyes, her mind shot. Thankfully, the bleeding had stopped as she turned him over, blood dried at the corners of his eyes and over most of his face. &quot;Ty!&quot; Narissa called desperately, she hadn&#39;t quite regained mastery of her emotions yet.<br />
<br />
Slowly, Ty&#39;s eyes opened against crusty eyelids, and he blinked wearily. &quot;I think we need to do some more practice.&quot; He said dryly, and closed his tired eyes to sleep.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
Some time later, Ty awoke in his own bed, stripped down and cleaned, with Dustin and Krissy tucked in beside him like tiny living dolls. At the foot of his bed, Narissa sat in the late evening darkness, growing suddenly alert as Ty opened his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh thank God.&quot; Narissa said evenly, sighing in relief. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to explain to me in very small words exactly what the fuck just happened.&quot; Ty said a raspy voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; The lizardess nodded. &quot;We fucked up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty smiled bleakly and nodded in return. &quot;Okay. Let&#39;s not fuck up anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal.&quot; Narissa said, nodding nervously. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll start doing a better job of training.&quot;</p>
