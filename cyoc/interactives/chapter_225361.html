<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex was still in a daze as he lounged in the hot tub in Lillian’s Spa. All thoughts of being betrayed by the police officer he thought was going to rescue him were in tatters; just like the remnants of his water logged clothes. The same clothes that the busty female anthro squirrel furry, fished out of the hot tub; tossing them into the trash without a thought or concern.<br />
“Dam,” Alex getting up; noticing the heft of his now large furry balls, he felt a desire to cup and hold them. More so, he had a desire to empty them in a willing partner; that same partner who would also gladly hold and lick his balls.<br />
“You’ll get use to them in no time,” the lion man rumbling, as the bunny girl kept stroking the furry as she herself was being pleasured.<br />
<br />
Alex smiled and nodded as he finally climbed out of the hot tub. Not seeing a towel to dry off his wet fur; Alex feels a warm sensation on his wrists. Noticing his runes glowing, he then felt the water soaking his fur evaporating, leaving him dry.<br />
“Now that’s useful,” Alex getting a better look at his chiseled physique in the nearby mirror. Noticing his abs peeking through the light brown fur with dark spots; typical markings of a spotted hyena; his round ears on the top of his head along with his dark brown eyes added a touch of menace to his already imposing stature.<br />
“Have any of you seen my smart phone,” Alex looking around; “I could swear I had it with me when I was brought in.”<br />
“Use your runes,” the bunny girl moaning as she felt the lion furry’s barbed cock in her.<br />
<br />
Alex pondered that thought as he watched the couple mate and rut while still in the hot tub. Not thinking of anything better; Alex looks at the runes on his wrists and begins to think about his phone. Just like that, the runes glow and said phone was now being held in one of his hand paws.<br />
“Fuck,” Alex chuckling; “dam useful.”<br />
“Your welcome,” The bunny girl managing to mutter as the lion furry grunted and pressed in on her as he spilled his seed into her.<br />
Nodding at the couple, the anthro Hyena furry heads out to the front door. Passing by Lillian, he gives her a polite wave of thanks and steps out into chilly October air. Instinctively he puts up a glamor to hide his new naked furry self from any human eyes and looks at his messages. Before Alex was picked up, he did try to contact people online to warn them what was happening; even going so far as to record a short clip of rutting furries into the middle of a college dorm hallway as he made his escape. The video was blurry and out of focus, and the comments where that of &quot;fake&quot; and &quot;click bait&quot;. He shuts down the commenting then deletes the post. But before he closes the app and puts his phone away; Alex spots an update from his only female friend. Clicking on the update, Alex’s heart grows heavy.<br />
“Darlene! No,” he mutters as he scrolls through the large wall of text. Scanning it, he figures out that it is a long screed that is two parts despair and one part suicide note. Alex growls as he puts the phone away and starts running; sprinting as fast as his new leg muscles could muster he channels his determination to get to his friend’s apartment as fast as possible; the runes on his wrists and ankles glow as he begins to run at a speed that would make an Italian made Ferrari feel like a Soviet era Yugo.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
“Please be in time,” Alex panting as he reaches the apartment complex; his tongue lolling out of his muzzle as he tries to cool down his body. Because he is now covered in fur, Alex no longer has any sweat glands and sweat pores and to cool down he needs to pant like a regular animal. Wrenching open the door he charges up the stairs to the third floor apartment. Knocking on the door of his friend’s place, Alex hopes that she was only bluffing. He growls as the door is lock.<br />
“Perhaps these runes will help,” Alex watching them glow as he place his hand paw on the door knob; the nearby deadbolt magically unlocking he quickly enters the apartment. Letting his glamour fade; Alex&#39;s ears are assaulted with Alice In Chains on repeat as he heads deeper into the apartment. It wasn’t long before he saw her; passed out on her bed with an empty bottle of pills and a half empty bottle of cheap bourbon.<br />
<br />
“No nononononono,” Alex quickly picking the girl up and taking her to the washroom. Jamming his furry fingers down her throat to force her to vomit into the toilet; Alex quickly turns on the nearby shower and carries her under the cascade of freezing cold water.<br />
“Stupid, stupid, stupid decision,” Alex almost shouting as the cold water makes the girl moan and shiver. He shoves his finger down her throat once again to induce more vomiting; making sure to get as much of what she taken out of her system he stays with her under the cold water as he strokes her now wet hair out of genuine concern.<br />
<br />
**********<br />
<br />
A few hours later, Alex turns of the shower and carries the girl out and back to her bedroom. Using his rune he magically shuts off the stereo. &quot;Why put their song Rooster on repeat,&quot; Alex shaking his head; &quot;I&#39;ll never know.&quot;<br />
He thinks the worst is over as she is still breathing, but is still passed out. Removing her clothes as he once again uses his runes to dry his fur and then dry her; Alex places Darlene on her bed. He gives her a deep and passionate kiss; making sure to infect her with the furry virus.<br />
“I hope this helps Darlene,” Alex joining her in bed; “you are the only girl who I have enjoyed being with in this town. Which is saying something as most acted like vapid blond bimbos with enough plastic to kill a baby elephant. Did I tell you I’m originally from West Virginia,” Alex talking at the unconscious girl; noting that her breathing is no longer shallow and becoming more steady along with her pulse. “Not a lot of opportunities in West Virginia,&quot; Alex continuing to speak; “you either become a coal miner, logger or a moonshine runner.”<br />
<br />
Alex glances as he notices white fur starting to grow. Coming in patches, Alex gives her another kiss; this one eliciting a moan.<br />
“Come on Darlene,” Alex lighting slapping her face; “you need to wake up. Don’t you die on me.”<br />
“Hmmmmmm, no one loves me,” Darlene managing to moan as she begins to stir.<br />
“That is a lie,” Alex answering; seeing that the white fur is now covering half her body and that a fluffy white tail is growing in. “I love you,” Alex whispering in Darlene’s ears as it morphs and move to the top of her head. “I’ve just been too pig headed to see it.”<br />
“Only Alex ever talked to me,” Darlene’s eyes fluttering; her vision blurred as she mistaken the hyena furry holding her as a complete stranger. “Who are you?”<br />
“Its me,” Alex answering as he helps Darlene to sit up; “Alex. I just look different. And you will too.”<br />
“Alex is a biker,” Darlene mumbling; “not a furry cosplayer.”<br />
<br />
“Dam it,” Alex getting angry; “wake up!” Alex pinches Darlene’s nipples, now surrounded by white fur. This got the desired response as Darlene&#39;s now emerald green eyes opened up and she started snarling. Her displeasure was soon pushed away as Alex pressed his muzzle on hers; his wet black nose touching Darlene’s pink nose; her face pushed out into a muzzle. The white fur now covering her entire body and her tail, ears and muzzle are now vulpine shaped.<br />
“Is that you Alex,” Darlene breathing heavily as the adrenaline and new hormones surge through her body; burning away the pills and alcohol cocktail she took earlier.<br />
“Yes,” The anthro hyena furry answering; “And you look beautiful.”<br />
“Will you make love to me,” Darlene utters; still feeling woozy despite her transformation almost finished.<br />
<br />
“I was planning to,” Alex climbing on top; gently spreading her legs as the tip of his hyena rod tickles Darlene’s entrance. “Do I have permission,” Alex whispering in the now anthro artic fox furry.<br />
“Yes,” Darlene panting; her body on fire with desire; her sex clearly moist and her nipples fully erect. “Mate and breed me.”<br />
<br />
Darlene’s eyes rolled back in her head as she felt Alex’s rod push inside her. Hilting her in the first thrust, the fat, pulsing knob of Alex’s bulbous knot stretching her already aching pussy to its limit. A desperate moan escaped her muzzle, wild and lustful, but she didn’t care. She long since gave in to the waves of raw pleasure that the furry virus flooded her body and mind, and had stopped her from feeling sad and lonely. She felt Alex bite her ear, sending sparks dancing across her vision, and a delightful pulse of pleasure racing down her body to her cunt.<br />
<br />
“Almost there,” Alex growled.  His hard, steady thrusts giving way to frantic pounding that told Darlene that her mate was on the brink, and she could barely catch her breath as he fully knotted her. He grunted through gritted teeth, giving one last thrust into her, “I’m cumming!” He growls as he pulls her close to him with his powerful embrace.<br />
<br />
Darlene dug her claws into the sheets under her as her body spasmed; her orgasm wracking her body as Alex’s first jet of thick, potent cum raced through her insides. The muscular hyena furry held her tightly in his arms as wave after wave of seed flooded her pussy, until it began to cause a small bulge, making her look pregnant; his knot ensuring that ever drop of his seed went deep inside her. She could feel the drool escaping her muzzle as her mind went blank, all thoughts replaced by sheer, unimaginable ecstasy and joy. Darlene tried to take her life out of sheer loneliness, only to be saved.<br />
<br />
“Stay with me Alex,” Darlene finally catching her breath as her body came down from her orgasm. “Please don’t leave me.”<br />
“I won’t,” Alex rolling the two so that he is now lying on the bed with her on top; his knot still locking the two together. “Just promise me you won’t try and take your life again,” Alex adding; “I’m sorry for not saying it before, but I do love you.”<br />
“I love you too,” Darlene mumbling as she drifts off back to sleep; her body exhausted after transforming on the brink of death.<br />
“Rest then my mate,” Alex Voltsnout stroking the small of Darlene’s furry backside and giving her a light lick with his tounge; “When you wake up, I know you’ll like the new arctic fox you.”</p>
