<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lily made her way down the hallway, catching up to her best friend Tilda. She startled her, making her jump; which made her laugh.<br />
“You bitch!” Tilda said, clutching her books close to her chest, Lily still chuckling,<br />
“Not my fault, can’t ignore that fat ass of yours.” She teased, Tilda looking a little pissed,<br />
“You wish you had half the ass I have.” She retorted,<br />
“Hell yeah, I wish I had the biggest ass in the school!” Lily said, the two girls laughing. They slowly made their way to home-room together.<br />
<br />
As home-room came to a close, and the two continued giggling about boys, Tilda looked at Lily’s abnormally tight looking shorts, “your pants shrink in the wash or something?”<br />
“Huh?” Lily asked, looking down. They did look a little tight, she twisted her head over her shoulder, only to find a fairly plump rump. She looked puzzled, “did I gain weight or something?” She asked herself.<br />
But as she watched, she felt a slight surge of pressure… her ass seemed to make her shorts even tighter. Did it grow?<br />
“What the fuck?” Lily said, looking more and more shocked. Then again, it suddenly jolted a little bigger. She leaned back.<br />
POP!<br />
Her front button flew off her shorts. Her eyes widened, <br />
“What the hell?” Tilda asked,<br />
“Bathroom! Now!” Lily grabbed her friend and dragged her into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Lily looked herself in the mirror, leaning over the bathroom sink, looking at her hips and thighs, her ass was undeniably growing. But Tilda seemed to not believe,<br />
“Are you okay?” Tilda asked, looking at her friends butt. But in that moment, she witnessed it growing. It grew nearly a whole inch bigger! And with it…<br />
RIIIIIP!<br />
A giant rip appeared in the back of Lily’s shorts, revealing her now tight white and pink panties!<br />
“Fuck!” Lily said, “it’s growing, right?”<br />
“D-do you think it’s because we said something earlier??” Tilda suggested, watching again her rear plumped bigger, rounder, wider, causing her shorts to rip a little more!<br />
“We’re being punished!!?” Lily said, “but why just me!? What about you!” She said, looking more and more upset,<br />
“Why would I be punished!?”<br />
“Excuse me?” Lily looked offended, “you think only I deserve to be punished? What the fuck!”<br />
Her ass plumped bigger, this time her hips seemed to widen too, and her thighs got rounder. Even her stomach looked a little bigger. She was easily rocking a real bubble butt by now,<br />
“Your ass is… it’s as big as mine now.” Tilda commented.<br />
Tilda was a bigger, chubbier girl. She was gifted with fair assets on top of her thicker body. But Lily was slim, yet she didn’t have any defining curves… at least she used to be flat.<br />
“W-wait, didn’t you make a stupid joke, li-like saying ‘I should have the biggest ass in the school’ or something.”<br />
“Right…” Lily realised. She felt her ass surge bigger again, growing bigger every second. Her ass was now bigger than Tilda’s, “then I wish my ass was normal again! Please! I wish!!” She said, she chanted, she plead. But nothing.<br />
<br />
“It’s still growing!!!” Lily exclaimed, looking back to see her ass starting to get too big to look normal on her small body.<br />
“I gotta call someone!” Tilda said, grabbing her cell,<br />
“Who the hell are you gonna call!?”<br />
“I DON’T KNOW! I’M FREAKING OUT! YOUR ASS IS GIANT AND BLOWING UP LIKE A BALLOON!!” Tilda yelled in response, she inputted 911 into the phone, simply because she didn’t know who else to call. But she couldn’t bring herself to call it.<br />
<br />
“No… I have to repent or something, call someone. My auntie! She knows magic…”<br />
“Are you fucking serious…” Tilda said in disbelief, “you want me to call your crazy ass auntie?”<br />
“MY ASS IS EXPLODING, WHAT ELSE DO I DO!?”<br />
“Pray or something.”<br />
“FINE!” Lily said. She put her hands together, “whatever god is out there, please for FUCK SAKE make my ass stop growing!”<br />
RIIIIIP!<br />
Her shorts completely split in two, they fell to the ground, leaving only her incredibly tight panties surrounding her absolutely gigantic ass. She caught herself in the mirror, seeing just how gargantuan her body had become. She could merely stare as her ass pulsated, becoming rounder, thicker, juicier.<br />
<br />
Her butt swelled, bigger and bigger until eventually it was the size of a bean bag chair. Undeniably she had the biggest ass in the school. Had she not wished for a bigger ass, maybe she would’ve avoided this problem… wait.<br />
“Tilda… I wished for a huge giant ass.”<br />
“I can see that, Lily.” She retorted,<br />
“WISH ME BACK TO NORMAL!”<br />
“What!? How is that going to work.”<br />
“It has to work!” Lily said, a look of hope on her face, “if I got to make a wish, then maybe you’ll get to make a wish.”<br />
“B-but if I get a wish, I’d rather use it on my family or something.”<br />
“TILDA!” Lily shouted, frustrated, “I know you love your grandma or whatever, but your grandma’s ass isn’t growing into a beanbag!”<br />
“FUCK YOU!” Tilda shouted, upset by her ‘friend’ insulting her family. Lily realised her mistake right as Tilda began to start crying.<br />
“PLEASE!” Lily begged, but Tilda furrowed her brow, mad. She stood there, watching as Lily’s butt grew bigger and bigger, her hips getting wider and her thighs getting thicker. She grew, more and more, until the weight was too much.<br />
<br />
Lily fell down, landing right on her squishy ass. She looked at her friend, feeling herself lifting just a little higher off the ground every second that passed.<br />
She grew for another few minutes, where the two girls were stuck in stunned silence. Lily grew more and more, until eventually she stopped.<br />
Her ass was officially the biggest in the school. She wasn’t even able to stand back up.<br />
The two managed to have a calm and collected conversation, eventually coming to the conclusion that they had to call someone.<br />
Lily felt embarrassed, but she understood that she needed to do it otherwise she’d never leave the bathroom.<br />
<br />
— <br />
<br />
An hour or so later, police arrived. <br />
They’d been called for another emergency at the same school… a similar event taking place to one of the teachers during her bathroom break. It was a strange phenomenon. <br />
Lily was taken by a group of ‘researchers’ dedicated to helping her out, to find out what caused this. The same for that teacher.<br />
Tilda was told to leave. To go home early, as did the rest of the school after the bizarre event.<br />
But as the hours went on, the alerts would becomes more persistent. More and more people found transformed. The public was confused, and the news began to circulate.<br />
<br />
More to Come…</p>
