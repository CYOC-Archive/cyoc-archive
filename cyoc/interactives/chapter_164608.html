<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> Jeff was unable to scream as his body started to turn to plastic and shrink down simultaneously. It was all happening so fast, he could barely orient himself as he turned into Rollo’s sex toy.<br />
<br />
But Rollo could see exactly what was happening. He watched as Jeff’s features faded and turned to transparent plastic. He could see how Jeff’s legs were reforming into a plastic circle, a cock ring. His arms melded with his torso, and his torso shrank and hollowed out, becoming the tube for a cock cage. Jeff’s former butthole would be where a cock would be inserted, and his mouth would be the slit where the wearer would pee through. Rollo laughed as he saw Jeff’s cock and balls relocate and reform. His balls became a metal lock, and his penis the key to the lock. In under a minute, Jeff had turned into a lightweight cock cage, perfect for wearing.<br />
<br />
“Ha!” Rollo said. “This will be fun. At the very least, you’re going to get to know me a lot better.<br />
<br />
Once the transformation was over, Jeff could feel what he was. Being a cock cage wasn’t particularly exciting, that is, until Rollo picked him up. The touch of Rollo’s hand gave him excitement. He felt himself reacting to the idea of being used.<br />
<br />
Rollo placed Jeff the chastity device on the computer desk. He started to strip out of his pants and underwear.<br />
<br />
“I’ve always wanted to try one of these,” Rollo said, knowing that Jeff could hear him. “When I saw the option on the Chronivac, I knew this was my opportunity to try it out. I’m sure you understand.”<br />
<br />
Jeff was suddenly aware of Rollo’s nude penis. Being a cock cage, he seemed to have only selected awareness of his surroundings. Rollo’s dick was suddenly very important in Jeff’s mind. He noticed how smooth it was, but also how short it was. He hadn’t realized that his friend’s peenie was only three-and-a-half inches long. No wonder he wanted to turn Jeff into a cock cage, Rollo obviously knew that was where his peepee belonged. But oddly, Jeff was feeling a need to encase that penis. To trap it. To deny it pleasure.<br />
<br />
And that’s exactly what Jeff was going to be able to do. Jeff felt Rollo unlock his former genitals and open up the cage. Suddenly, he was in three different pieces. Rollo took the cock ring portion of him and pulled his small testicles through. Then, Rollo stuck his peenie through, securing Jeff around his dick and balls. Jeff felt himself shrink around Rollo’s junk, as if he was readjusting to become Rollo’s perfect fit.<br />
<br />
Rollo himself was becoming perfectly rigid, his dicklet showing off how entirely excited Rollo was to be putting on a cock cage for the first time. He started to pull his pud, much to Jeff’s dismay. Jeff wished he could stop Rollo from pleasuring himself. His purpose was to keep people horny, not passively exist as his friend got off on the idea of wearing him.<br />
<br />
Jeff finally got his wish, as Rollo stopped playing with his erect weenie. Rollo looked as himself in the mirror, admiring his horned up self. “You’re getting me excited, Jeff,” Rollo said. “Ironically, not super helpful while I’m trying to put my dick inside you.”<br />
<br />
Even the transformed Jeff had to laugh at that one. He watched longingly as Rollo tried to calm himself down. It felt like forever until Rollo was flaccid enough to slide Jeff’s cage body over his tiny peenie. It was the most fulfilling feeling as Rollo’s nub-head slid into the tube, moving further to the end as Rollo shoved the cage down. Soon, Rollo’s dickhead was instead Jeff’s former head. Satisfaction pulsed through Jeff body as his penetrated tube body met back up with the ring portion of himself. Quickly, Rollo took the lock and fed it through the two sections. Rollo paused only briefly before he clicked the lock on.<br />
<br />
An indescribable feeling of erotic purpose flowed through Jeff’s being. As the key was pulled out of the lock, Jeff felt his tube body growing smaller and tighter around it’s captive member.<br />
<br />
“Woah, Jeff,” Rollo said. “Not leaving much room in there, huh, bud.”<br />
<br />
Jeff scoffed to himself. Now being a cock cage, he was feeling sadistic about Rollo’s captivity. He was horrified as first to be turned into a sex toy, but now…he was loving it. Of course, Jeff’s ability to keep Rollo’s obviously inferior weenie locked was up to him securing his key (his former cock) somewhere he didn’t have access to it.<br />
<br />
“This feels great,” Rollo said aloud. “I hope you’re enjoying this, because I think we are going to have to try this out for a while.” Rollo jiggled Jeff the cage around, feeling how secure his dick was from getting stroked or getting any attention. Suddenly, a thought occurred to him.<br />
<br />
“If I’m going to wear you for while, we are going to have to come up with a reason why you’ve disappeared,” Rollo thought to himself, stroking the cage all the while. Jeff had thought about the fact that he was now inexplicably a cock cage, and how crazy that fact was to the normal world. But he hadn’t been worried about it for a minute, since he was feeling such satisfaction from being a cage and putting Rollo’s peenie in its place.<br />
<br />
Rollo looked the direction of the Chronivac. Still pantsless, he sat down at the computer, thinking that maybe there was an option to be found there. He looked at the status of Jeff, seeing an indicator that labeled him as “satisfied/fulfilled.” Understanding now that Jeff was having fun with this, he felt his dick start to harden again. It was a crazy feeling to him, having it hampered by a cock cage, and even crazier knowing that cage was once his friend.<br />
<br />
Scrolling through the options, he noticed a reality change filter. Rollo noticed that it basically gave him free reign to do whatever. He realized he could get creative, so he did. Typing into the Chronivac, he changed the world so that it was completely normal for Jeff to be a cock cage, and not only did people accept it, they encouraged it. For some extra fun, Rollo made it normal for him to walk around nude. Thinking twice, he went a step further and made it mandatory for him to be naked. He’d be forced to be naked, but for how long?<br />
<br />
Looking down at his cage, he knew that he was letting his horniness cloud his judgement. But, he knew that if he set it up right, he and Jeff would just be having a little fun.<br />
<br />
He decided to set it so that he wouldn’t be able to change these settings, or turn Jeff back, until he was unlocked. Without further thought, he clicked enter. Instantly, the shirt off his back and the clothes he came in with vanished. All he was left with was Jeff as his cock cage and a key to his freedom.<br />
<br />
Rollo stood up, shaking with excitement. He took the key in hand and took his first steps into this new world. He opened the door to Jeff’s room, Jeff himself bouncing between Rollo’s legs.<br />
<br />
As Rollo made it down the stairs, he was startled by Jeff’s dad, watching football on the TV. Rollo instinctually covered himself up.<br />
<br />
“Hey kid,” he said. “I see that Jeff has agreed to keep your dick locked up.”<br />
<br />
Jeff heard his father’s words with astonishment. He started to take in exactly what world Rollo had created with the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
“That was certainly nice of him,” his father continued.<br />
<br />
Rollo uncovered his dick, realizing that this was normal now. His nudity was now normal. Jeff as his cage was normal, encouraged even.“Yes, Jeff is pretty cool like that.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve always been proud of my son for volunteering his time like that,” Jeff’s dad said. “If a boy needs his dicklet locked up, Jeff is the one for the job.”<br />
<br />
Jeff heard his father’s comment and sadistically beamed. He was starting to like this new world that Rollo had created.<br />
<br />
“Are you two just heading out,” Jeff’s dad asked. “Can I expect Jeff back soon, or are we in extended service?”<br />
<br />
“Um,” Rollo paused, not having thought that far ahead. “I’m not sure.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” Jeff’s father replied. “Short dicked boys are the funniest. They know their nubs should be locked, but don’t really think of how to achieve that.”<br />
<br />
Rollo felt his dick straining against his cage as he spoke. Jeff felt it too, feeling satisfied that his purpose was being fulfilled.<br />
<br />
“Have you decided who you are giving the key to?” Jeff’s father looked Rollo in the eye, prompting him to make a decision.<br />
<br />
Rollo, again, hadn’t thought of that. He started to run through his options.</p>
