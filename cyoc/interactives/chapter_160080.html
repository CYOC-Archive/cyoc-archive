<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark sat there for some time thinking. He didn´t want to change something about himself without having it thought through enough. He enjoyed his new underwear, the only piece of clothing he was wearing at the moment. He hadn´t bothered to put more on until now. “What do you think, Aidan? Should I just put my normal clothes back on over you or should I find some others for new clothes? I mean you are more comfortable than anything I have ever worn before.” <br />
Aidan was still furious about his situation, but he was sure for one thing, he didn´t want anyone other in the same situation as him.<br />
Mark had applied he could read Aidans answer in the laptop and grinned at that. “You don´t want anyone to join you I guess. Too bad I already have made up my mind about that.” He let the chronivac scan who was in range. “Oh, there are four people in the flat next door, maybe that is enough for me.” <br />
Aidan screamed again. The flat was owned by Geoff, and he had friends over. He had been on good terms with Geoff and his friends, some were also his own. He didn´t want them in his predicament.<br />
<br />
Mark looked over the four, seeing a set of two brothers and two others. Aidan said Geoff was the owner, and from the data he received he and Daniel were both into computers. And the brothers, Jack and John were both interested in sports. <br />
“Hehe, I can just use the laptop to get them over here, that will be helpful. Let´s see, I will get them all over here and than see what to do with them.” And he started to type away. He got the same comment applied as before for Aidan, “Mark rules” and then let them come over together.<br />
A minute later there was a knock on the door and Mark let the four inside. He had slipped his own jeans and shirt over again, but was still bare-foot. He let them into the living room, laughing over a joke.<br />
“Freeze and silence.” Mark exclaimed when they were there, leaving them in confusion. Why couldn´t they move or talk anymore?<br />
Aidan was blind due the jeans covering him and that also took away a good part of the sound, so he didn´t know what Mark had done. He could just hope Mark didn´t torture his friends. <br />
<br />
Mark smiled at the four young man in the room. He already had decided who was becoming what. “So, first you all will strip naked for me. Then you can lay down on your back, arms close to your sides and legs together. Geoff next to Daniel and Jack and John also next to each other.”<br />
All four looked confused to Mark. That changed to a shocked look when their bodies  started to move on their own, starting to strip. First went their shoes, kicked off into the corner where Aidans shoes still layed. Between Geoff and Daniel landed both their shirts first, followed by their jeans. On top of that dropped first Geoffs socks and underwear, followed by Daniels socks and boxers. On the other side of the room John dropped his jeans first, dropping his socks on top. Then he discarded his shirt and under shirt next to the pile. His speedo was the last to follow on the piles, dropped on his socks. His brother Jack had dropped his shorts, socks and speedo first on top of each other, his shirt went last and covered the whole pile.<br />
Red in embarrassment and shocked by their movements the four layed down, Geoff and Daniel right next to each other with almost touching shoulders. The brothers lay down with a bit more distance to each other, but still only a couple of centimeters away from each other. All four had their arms down on their sides, hands close to their asses while their legs laid down straight to their toes. All four looked up to Mark, shock still on their faces.<br />
<br />
“Because you looked all so confused to why you do what I say, I will explain it to you. When I came here earlier to get my book back from Aidan he had to search for it. He had left his laptop open and I looked at the program he was using. I thought it was a game and typed in “Mark rules”, but this program, the chronivac, can effect reality. I had complete control of Aidan and changed him into my new underwear with some extra features. But I have decided I wanted more, so you four will join him as my clothes.” He laughed at their horrified faces. They hadn´t looked confused over the name Aidan, so even if he not existed as a human anymore he wasn´t forgotten. He would have to change that later, not that anyone searched for them.<br />
After having enjoyed their shock and fear for a couple of minutes he decided to continue, moving over to Geoff and Daniel. “Geoff and Daniel, you will both open your mouth. Your teeth will vanish and your throat will widen in space. Your arms will merge with your sides and your legs will merge together.”<br />
Both Geoff and Daniel looked up at Mark with pure horror and disgust written over their faces. Their mouths opened wide and they both felt a sucking in it, returning their teeth into the gums. A strong pull on their sides sucked their arms into the body, leaving nothing but smooth skin in their wake. Their legs also fused together, down from the genitals to the toes. They looked like big worms on the floor, but both had a full erect cock standing.<br />
<br />
Mark laughed at that. It gave him an idea how to torture them a bit more. “As good as it looks with that pole they would be in the way later. But maybe you can keep them in a way.” Mark than put his right foot into Daniels open mouth, making him gag. Geoff had no time to react as Marks left foot slipped into his mouth only seconds later. “Your bodies will turn into cloth like Aidans had before. It will shrink to fit my feet perfectly. Your cocks will move under the heel of my feet and shrink to nothing, but you will feel it still. Your tongue will clean my feet in you and absorb any sweat and dirt that is there. Your lips will be the rim and your eyes will be painted on the sides above my ankles.”<br />
Slowly, the bodies of Geoff and Daniel started to shrink, vanishing everything inside to nothing. Their cocks shrunk away, but the feeling of that zone just moved around their bodies, back to their shrinking head. Their eyes moved around their wide open mouth, landing a bit above the point were they could feel their cocks still before they sunk back into the flesh. Said flesh all around turned into cloth similar to the one Aidans had become, even the same blue color. Only their lips turned into a black rim. The rest of their features shrunk away into the cloth, leaving them as simple blue socks. But then their tongues started to slowly move up and down the sole of Marks feet, cleaning and also massaging them. Mark could see their absolutely disgusted thoughts on the laptop like Aidans, grinning at that. He checked their stats and added some points like he had with Aidan, before removing his comment from them.<br />

<br />
“So, now that I have dealt with you, I can move to the other two.” Mark said, moving over to John and Jack. Every step send pleasure through the former boys. But without being able to release it and they were as helpless as Aidan.<br />
<br />
Both John and Jack looked horrified and pleading at the same time. But Mark just grinned down at them. “Like the other two, you will both open your mouth wide. Your teeth will vanish like theirs and your throat will widen in space. But only your legs will merge together. Your arm will be needed elsewhere later.”<br />
John and Jack couldn´t do anything as their legs slowly merged from their genitals downwards towards their toes. A sucking motion took their teeth away back into their gums, so that when their mouths dropped open you couldn´t see them anymore. They gagged a bit as their throats widened, but that was all they could do at them moment. Like their friends before they spotted both a big erection.<br />
<br />
Mark laughed again. “I thought you were not gay, but that cocks seemed to show different. But lets move further.” With that he placed his left foot clad in the sock that was Geoff over Jacks mouth and dropped it in, making him gag again. He ignored Jack and moved his right foot with was in the sock former known as Daniel into Johns mouth. Both socks got a bit wet inside, but started to absorb their saliva quickly, leaving both John and Jack with dry mouths.<br />
<br />
“Unlike the others, your bodies will turn into leather. It will then shrink to fit my feet perfectly. Your cocks will lengthen into the tongue of the shoe you will become. Your arms will turn into the shoe laces to bind you. While your back becomes the sole of your new bodies it will act like the tongue in your mouth and clear the ground were I stand. You will look like simple white sneakers, but your eyes will be on the outside of my ankles, just below the rim. That way the others will still be able to see.”<br />
Both looked still horrified up, but that stopped when their eyes sunk into their turning flesh, leaving only an unmoving eye as pictures on both sides. While their whole bodies started to shrink down, their still erect cocks stayed in size and only toppled over towards their face. To them it felt like they could suck their own cocks when it was fixed on the sides to become the shoes tongue. Their arms thinned while growing longer, the fingers merging with their hands into the tip of their now shoe laces arms. They thread themselves on top of their former cock and pulled tight into a knot. Then all of the sudden they felt like they were licking the ground underneath them, absorbing any dirt below them.<br />
<br />
Mark moved back to the laptop to see both their thoughts and to check their profiles again. They were still shocked by their state, as well as disgusted by all the dirt they were licking from the ground. Mark added their extras before he removed his comment.<br />

		<br />
“You are as comfortable as Aidan is down there. Now I just need to change someone into jeans and a shirt so I´m fully clothed in former humans.” Mark grinnes as he used Aidan the first time to release his bowels, pissing right into his mouth. He started to laugh hysterical at Aidans writen thoughts of disgust.</p>
