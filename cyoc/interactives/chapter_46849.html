<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Indeed,&quot; Alexa said.  &quot;I wish that the television would show us Rick's room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly the television turned on.  It showed Rick’s room in perfect, bright color.  It was as if we were watching on a security camera.  Rick still sat on the bed.  He looked around the room.  It was clearly not to his liking.  His face was overcome with grief and I could see a tear trickle down his face.  He wiped it off and sniffled.<br />
<br />
“Do you think he will?” Alexa asked me.<br />
<br />
“I’m pretty sure he enjoyed it at the end,” I answered.  “Didn’t you think so?” I asked her.<br />
<br />
“Yea,” she said.  “But I’d like to know for sure.  Ooh, I know.  I wish I knew if Rick enjoyed being fucked by Joey as he was turning into a woman.”  For a few seconds, Alexa’s eyes fluttered and she didn’t otherwise move.  Then her head reeled back suddenly and she had to steady herself.  “Whoa, that was weird,” she said.  <br />
<br />
“What was that like?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know how to describe it,” she said.  Then she smiled and added, “Why don’t you find out yourself.”<br />
<br />
“OK,” I agreed.  I made the same wish.  Once it was completed, I felt foreign thoughts enter my mind and I went stiff.  In the thoughts that invaded I found that Rick definitely had enjoyed it when I fucked him.  As soon as I processed the thought, the foreign feeling went away and I also had to steady myself.  “Whoa,” I echoed her statement.  “That was definitely weird.”  <br />
<br />
“And the verdict?” she asked.<br />
<br />
In unison we said, “He enjoyed it!”  We were both smugly satisfied that he did.  It told us that what we wanted to happen next probably would.<br />
<br />
We focused our attention back on the television.  Rick wiped away another tear and stood up.  He went to the bookcase and looked at all of the titles.  “Fat chance,” he muttered to himself.  We were not surprised.  We didn’t think he’d cave in this soon.<br />
<br />
He walked to the closet and opened it.  He was confused to find it empty.  He peered in to make sure that he didn’t miss anything.  “What’s the gol’ durn point then?” he asked.  I began to find it interesting that the sound of his voice didn’t shock him more.  He was still the same person, just in a different body.  Maybe he really wasn’t smart enough to question it.<br />
<br />
Next Rick walked over to the dresser.  He looked at himself in the mirror for a few moments.  He ran his hands over his face and took it all in.  He looked at himself top to bottom and ran his hands over his much softer skin.  I could have sworn I saw a slight smile when he ran his fingers over his gigantic mammary glands.<br />
<br />
After he completed his self-exploration he investigated the dresser drawers.  He opened the top drawer and found towels, washcloths, and bed sheets.  He looked through the drawer thoroughly to make sure he didn’t miss anything.  Then he moved to the second drawer.  It was filled with replacement thongs.  “Figures,” he muttered.<br />
<br />
Our anticipation level maximized as Rick closed the second drawer.  Now he was about to get to the good part.  He opened the bottom drawer and recoiled in shock.  “What in the hell?!?” he exclaimed.  Rick found that the drawer was filled with sex toys.  There were a lot of dildos and various types of enhancers.  The look on his face was one of absolute disgust.  “Sick fuckers,” he muttered again.  Clearly he was not happy.<br />
<br />
We were patient, however.  We didn’t make a wish for this situation, but with Alexa’s knowledge of Rick as a person, coupled with the extreme situation, we knew he would oblige us.  It took a few minutes of him staring at the contents of the drawer, but finally his face softened from disgust to intrigue.  He picked up one of the dildos from the drawer and sat back down on the bed.  He looked at it curiously, as if he had seen it somewhere before now.<br />
<br />
This was true.  He had seen this dildo before.  But he had not seen it as a dildo.  He was holding a replica of his own cock.  This, I thought, was a bit of genius to our wish.  Since we had turned him into his idea of a perfect woman, we thought we’d give him his own cock to use on himself.  All of the dildos were of various composition, while some were also vibrators, but they all had the same size and shape as Rick’s former cock.<br />
<br />
Rick continued to stare at the dildo and he appeared to enter a trance.  He drew the dildo closer to his mouth.  Slowly and carefully, he licked at the tip.  Following a few seconds of careful licking he drew the dildo into his mouth and sucked at it with great enthusiasm.  He acted instinctively and moved the dildo in and out as if he was giving a blow job which, presumably, he had never done previously.<br />
<br />
Alexa and I could barely contain our delight.  He was acting exactly as we hoped.  He was trapped by his own body, by his own carnal desires.  If we felt any guilt it was relieved by knowing that he deserved what happened to him, and that he was to blame for his current form and level of lust.<br />
<br />
A few minutes after he started to blow the dildo, he took it out of his mouth.  As best he could he looked over his breasts toward his womanhood.  “I gotta know,” he said to no one in particular.  He set the dildo on the bed, stood up, and slid the thong off his body.  He picked up the dildo and moved to the top of the bed.  He lay down on his back and spread open his legs.  “Here goes nothin’,” he said.  With that he carefully inserted the dildo into his pussy.</p>
