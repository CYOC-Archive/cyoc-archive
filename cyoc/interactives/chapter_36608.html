<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer couldn't understand what was happening. She frantically attempted to lift her left foot out of the slightly damp earth, and yelped in pain when it seemed to be caught on something. Trying again slowly, she found to her horror that her foot wouldn't move at all now. She tried to wiggle her toes with no luck. A few seconds later her toes suddenly felt like they were moving on their own - no, not moving, GROWING! they seemed to be slowly extending and pushing further into the two foot deep pot of earth.<br />
<br />
She tried to kneel down, but found her ankles wouldn't bend at all now, either, she was unable to move her legs below the knee. Slowly and cautiously she bent her knees and found to her amazement that she could get into a sort of sitting position, her feet so firmly embedded in the pot that they were supporting her in this off-balance stance. Reaching down to her legs where they came out of soil about half-way up her shins, she recoiled when she felt the texture of her skin. It was slightly rough yet smooth at the same time, not like skin at all. A strange sensation in her legs below the soil made her stare at them, just in time to see them start to almost seem to liquify as they slowly began to merge into one limb. The merging point very gradually rose from the soil, higher and higher, while she yelled and struggled to somehow extract herself from the grip of the earth.<br />
<br />
Amazingly, no one else in the room paid any attention to the noise she was making. As the merging of her legs into one rose past her knees, she found she was forced into a standing position again, against her will. She was crying in terror by now, unable to understand what was happening. &quot;For god's sake someone please help me!&quot; she screamed to the classroom at large. A couple of people glanced in her direction incuriously, then apparently immediately lost interest and went back to their work. The teacher ignored her completely, lecturing on about the proper use of adverbs.<br />
<br />
Her legs kept slowly merging into one, following the overall shape of her body. By now the change was halfway up her thighs. She bent at the waist, all the movement she was now capable of, and felt her transformed legs in disbelief. She couldn't figure out what was happening or why. As she stared down at her slowly changing body, she realised that the colour of her merged legs was gradually changing as well, starting at the point where it disappeared beneath the soil she was trapped in. A steadily deepening green colour was spreading remorselessly up her legs. The texture had continued to shift as well, she found when she reached down with a trembling hand and touched her lower extremity. <br />
<br />
As the change reached her hips, she was leisurely forced into a standing position, her hands now unable to reach the earth. She ran them over the single limb that was now her body below the hips, as far down as she could reach by bending her waist, and came to a horrible realisation. The colour, the strange but oddly familiar texture... she was turning into a plant! She screamed and flailed her upper body around, desperately trying to free herself from the grip of the pot, without success.<br />
<br />
The slow shifting of mammal into plant reached her waist, as she slumped slightly in despair. Looking down at what had until minutes ago been her legs she realised with a sinking heart it was now best thought of as a stalk. Wondering what would happen when the change reached her head, with tears running down her cheeks, she waited for the apparently inevitable.<br />
<br />
It took her a couple of minutes to realise that while the colour change was still ascending her body, the transformation into immovable plant seemed to have halted around the level of her navel. Cautiously reaching down, she felt her slim waist and stomach. The skin at the narrowest part of her waist felt normal, even though it was now bright green, but as she ran her hands down her sides and over the dramatic swell of her hips, it became the texture she associated with a plant stem. Experimenting, she found she retained full mobility from the waist up, but was completely unable to move anything below that. Oddly, to her mind, was that even though the plant parts of her were immobile, she could still feel them normally although the sensations were very strange as a result of the transformation.<br />
<br />
A sudden thought struck her, and she bent slightly so she could look at where her groin had been until recently. She gasped, as she saw that her vagina was still present, but now appeared to be embedded in the middle of a bright yellow flower! There were dozens of petals several inches long surrounding the area, which now looked a little like a small sunflower with a slit down the middle. When she felt one of the petals she shivered all over from the erotic sensation, they were as sensitive as her clitoris was.<br />
<br />
A sudden weird feeling at the level of her neck made her switch attention higher up her body. Jennifer noticed that her entire torso was now bright chlorophyll green, and also discovered that while she had been distracted by her vagina-flower, her large breasts had inflated considerably. They stuck out some six inches, and when she moved they swayed and bounced off each other. The things seemed to be much heavier and fuller than even their larger size would suggest, and implausibly firm despite the size. She also saw her nipples slowly elongating, finally attaining a size of nearly an inch and a half long and over half an inch in diameter. When she experimentally touched one, again the enhanced erotic sensitivity made her shudder. There was a slow welling of clear fluid building up at the ends of her nipples now, every now and then dripping into her pot. <br />
<br />
Tasting it cautiously, she found it was sweet, and realised it was essentially sap, or nectar. She groaned in irritation. Without the bra which was sitting on her desk several feet away, hopelessly out of reach under the circumstances and now far too small anyway, every movement of her torso made her huge breasts wobble around, and it was annoying.<br />
<br />
The weird feeling at her neck suddenly grew very strong, and abruptly spread all over her head. Without warning something covered her face blocking out the view of her disinterested classmates. Shrieking in fright, she grabbed for her face, only to find something smooth covering it. Feeling around, she was horrified once more. There seemed to be a smooth surface, similar in texture to her stalk, where her head should be. Sliding her shaking hands around this thing, she found it seemed to be perhaps a foot wide around the level of her ears, and went up above the top of her head by several inches, where it formed a soft point. <br />
<br />
Jennifer realised it was a flower bud! Her head was inside it, somewhere. It was slowly growing in size, while changing slightly in shape. After a short period of panic while she was wondering whether she would suffocate, it became apparent that she wasn't suffering any ill effects. Feeling her bud slightly more calmly, she could make out that the outer surface seemed to consist of a number of overlapping leaves. Attempting to peel one of them back over her face only hurt. She became aware that now she had sensation through the leaves, which could feel her hands while her hands could feel them.<br />
<br />
Some time passed, while she waited to see what would happen next. She could hear muffled voices from the others in the classroom, but couldn't see anything at all. After ten minutes or so (it was difficult to keep track of time inside the bud) Jennifer felt that her head was slowly tilting back and back. Trying to move it forward had no effect. Reaching up she blindly ran her hands over the outside of her bud, but was unable to determine any other changes. It seemed to have reached it's maximum size a while back.<br />
<br />
Eventually her head felt like it was tilted back so far her face would be pointing at the ceiling, but oddly there was no strain in her neck. She was still unable to move it into a normal position, although when she tried looking from side to side her bud rotated a bit on the vertical axis. Finally, several minutes after her head stopped moving, sudden bright light struck her eyes as her bud slowly opened.<br />
<br />
A few seconds later she found herself staring at the fluorescent light directly above her, unable to turn her face away. Rolling her eyes side to side, she could see that her face was surrounded by more bright yellow petals. Feeling cautiously with her hands, she finally determined that her face must be set into the middle of a huge flower, probably looking like the one at her groin but a couple of feet across. The leaves that formed the outside of her bud had folded back and down touching her shoulders.<br />
<br />
She tried again and again to move her head, but was unable to do so. Suddenly, a tingle went up her neck, and the ceiling looked like it was getting gradually closer. Raising her hands to her neck in shock, she could feel it was elongating steadily, also having taken on the plant texture. When it had reached a length of perhaps a foot, it slowly tilted until she was looking forward normally again, although from a somewhat higher vantage point. Abruptly she could move her head again, and looked around in a daze of disbelief. Whenever she moved her head her petals shook with a slight rustling noise, while her bud leaves stroked across the tops of her shoulders and breasts.<br />
<br />
Nothing further appeared to be happening now. Her slow transformation into a plant-girl seemed to have completed itself, although she was none the wiser as to why this had happened. Looking around the classroom she realised the lesson was coming to an end. The students packed away their books and classroom materials, and stood as the bell rang. Most of them left, some of them waving to her, while a couple went up to talk to the teacher. Her friend Becky looked over at her, and said &quot;Well, let's get you to the next class, Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Surprise at suddenly being noticed again made Jennifer start, and she would have jumped for joy if she had still been physically capable of doing so. &quot;Becky, help me&quot; she cried, reaching her hands towards her friend. <br />
<br />
Becky held her hands and asked concernedly, &quot;Jen, what's wrong. Why are you crying? Is your earth too dry?&quot; Jennifer stared at her in disbelief. Couldn't she SEE what had happened? She was a flower for god's sake!<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at me!&quot; Jennifer yelled, her petals shaking wildly. She gestured at her plant/human hybrid form. &quot;I'm a plant! You've got to help me find out what happened. I can't stay like this!&quot; Her friend looked at her oddly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about&quot;, she asked, a worried expression on her face. &quot;Of course you're a plant. You always have been. I've known you since you were a seedling, and you've always been like this. Are you feeling OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer stared in shock, then screamed in rage which made everyone left in the room jump. She burst into tears again, holding her head in her hands and shuddering at the feeling of her petals sliding over her arms. If she had been capable of dropping to the ground in despair she would have done so. What was going on? Why, and how, had she turned into a half-plant girl, and why did she seem to be the only one who NOTICED she had changed?<br />
<br />
Becky put an arm around her shoulders and tried to comfort the plant-girl. It was unlike Jennifer to be like this, normally she was a pretty upbeat person. After a moment, the shorter girl went to the corner of the room and grabbed the handles of a heavy-duty two-wheeled sack truck, the sort of thing one would use to move a filing cabinet. While Jennifer watched, wiping the tears from her eyes with the back of her hands, her friend wheeled it over to a position in front of her pot.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, regardless of being upset we really HAVE to get to next class, or we're both in trouble.&quot; She pushed the bottom of the truck under the edge of the pot Jennifer was planted in, and said &quot;Right, grab hold.&quot; Jennifer looked at her in puzzlement for a moment, then realised what she meant and reached out to hand onto the handles of the sack truck as well. Becky tilted back, and the pot tipped forwards and slid into place. Jennifer found herself at a twenty degree angle, which made her very large breasts dangle and sway from her chest. As Becky wheeled her towards the door, her breasts slapped together, more nectar dribbling from her huge nipples with each impact.<br />
<br />
Becky noticed, and commented &quot;Good thing this is last period, we need to get you hooked up to the pump pretty soon or you'll be squirting everywhere. I'll be glad when your mobility aid gets back from being repaired. It's really a pain having to use the hand-pump, rather than the one built into the trolley. It's getting to be hard work moving you around like this as well!&quot; She smiled to make it obvious she wasn't really annoyed, while Jennifer looked at her with a sinking feeling. It looked like, somehow, everyone really thought that this thing was what she had always been.<br />
<br />
