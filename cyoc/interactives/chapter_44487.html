<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think I would like to tour the house first&quot; you said as you and Megan began climbing the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's good&quot; Megan said. &quot;You need to learn your way around the house. If you don't know which rooms to avoid or which staircases you will easily get lost.&quot; You were on the second floor now and Megan stopped and opened a door saying &quot;This staircase leads up to the third floor and it's one of the safe ones. At the end of this hall is a staircase that also leads up to the third floor but it's a different third floor. You go up that staircase you may become trapped up there. Only Madame Morphia, I mean Mother, or her servant demons can be up there and not become trapped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would that apply to us now?&quot; you asked as you followed Megan up the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; she admitted. &quot;It's possible that we won't be affected now that Mother has decided to make us her daughters. We will have to ask. If so then she may send us up to escort whoever is trapped there back down. Also I'm sure we will need to attend her business deals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does she place boys too?&quot; you asked as Megan opened a door.<br />
<br />
&quot;She does&quot; Megan said as she went inside and you followed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't seen any boys here&quot; you said. &quot;Why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother doesn't think it's good to mix boys and girls&quot; she said going to a dresser and opening a drawer. &quot;So she makes everyone a girl. Some may be changed back or some natural girls may be changed into boys upon being placed. Depends on which ones Mother deems are a good fit with the parents.&quot; As she had been talking she had taken out a couple pairs of panties and bras and had gone over to a wardrobe. She opened it revealing it to be filled with dresses. She turned to you and said &quot;Mother is pretty old fashioned and believes that girls should wear dresses. No pants, shorts, or mini skirts. She does allow us to wear skirts as long as they're not too short.&quot; She selected two dresses and put them on the bed along with the panties and bras. Pointing to one dress and the panties and bra she said &quot;You can wear those. Don't worry, they'll fit you. Just do what I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan crossed her arms and pulled her nightshirt off over her head and you did the same with you nightgown. You didn't need to watch her take off her panties to know how to take your panties off. You put on the pink lace panties she had set out for you and then picked up the matching bra not sure you really needed to wear it. &quot;Do I have to wear a bra?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; Megan answered. &quot;If you don't Mother may turn you into a bra like she turned Denise into the dress I'll be wearing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She can turn people into inanimate objects?&quot; you asked stunned.<br />
<br />
With a nod she said &quot;She can. Denise is aware of what she is and can see us. She was a boy when she came here and told Mother that she would wear pants if she wanted. As punishment she turned her into a dress until she would wear dresses. That was three months ago. Now watch how I put my bra on.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched as Megan put her breasts into the cups and using one hand to hold it put first one arm then the other through the shoulder straps. She then bent forward and hooked the bra. You followed what she did. It was difficult for you to hook the bra but you eventually managed. &quot;Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it&quot; she said and then took up the dress. The back had a zipper and Megan stepped into it pulling it up and putting her arms into the sleeves. She then bent forward again and zipped up the dress making sure her hair was out of the way. You followed her example and eventually got your pink dress zipped up. Fortunately you had short hair still so you didn't have to worry about that.<br />
<br />
Megan sat down at a vanity table and put on make-up. After she had you put on make-up too and she helped you pick out the right shades and explained how to put it on. You were surprised that it sounded so simple and you were able to put it on without much trouble. She then opened a jewelery box on the vanity and took out two pairs of earrings. She put a pair in her ears then said &quot;This will hurt for a second.&quot; She took the back of the earring against the back of your ear and then quickly pushed the post into and through your ear. It did hurt but like she said it was only for a second. Same with the other ear. When you looked in the mirror you could see the earrings were dangling ones with pink hearts at the end.<br />
<br />
After putting on a pair of pink sandals Megan took you on the tour. As you walked you were a little self conscious about about wearing a dress and bra. The bra felt funny because you could feel the under-wire on your chest and the fabric of the cups rubbed across your nipples at odd intervals. The third floor was devoted to the girl's bedrooms and baths, at least the regular third floor. The second floor had a few guest bedrooms and baths along with staircases that led to both the normal third floor and alternate third floors. The main floor contained the dinning room, kitchen, sitting room, indoor pool, and game room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's this door?&quot; you asked noticing a door with two door knobs on it, one on the left and one on the right.<br />
<br />
&quot;That door leads to either the altar room which you were in last night or Mother's office&quot; she said. &quot;Which one depends on which knob you turn. The knob on the right leads to Mother's office and the one on the left leads to the alter room. Watch this.&quot; She turned the left hand knob and the door opened on a winding staircase leading down.<br />
<br />
Megan closed the door and was about to turn the other knob when a voice behind them said &quot;Nice to see you Megan.&quot;<br />
<br />
You both jump and turn around. Standing behind you was a male demon. He was carrying two file folders. Megan took a look at him and said &quot;I see you have a couple willing to sell their soul for a child Zelnorph.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do&quot; Zelnorph said. &quot;Perhaps you would be so kind as to take me to Morphia's office.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure Mother would be happy to see you&quot; Megan said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother is it now?&quot; Zelnorph asked. &quot;So she finally decided to take a child of her own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just one but two&quot; Megan said. Gesturing to you she said &quot;This is my sister Victoria.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Victoria is it?&quot; Zelnorph asked turning to you. &quot;You've only had one session I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She has&quot; Megan said before you could say anything. With a look she warned you not to say anything. &quot;Now perhaps you would like to see Mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent idea&quot; Zelnorph said.<br />
<br />
Megan turned the right hand knob and when the door opened there was a short hallway with another door at the end. Megan knocked on the door and Madame Morphia said &quot;Come in.'<br />
<br />
Megan opened the door and said &quot;Mother, Zelnorph is here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah good&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;Let him in. You can stay and so can Victoria. It will do both of you good to see me conduct my business.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zelnorph came in and said &quot;All these centuries and you don't take a child and now you have two daughters. Congratulations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;Now get to business.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well&quot; Zelnorph said. &quot;There is a couple in Iowa that want two daughters and are willing to sell both of their souls. They are an older couple so they want to skip the pregnancy and baby stages.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madame Morphia took the folders from Zelnorph and said &quot;You know what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course&quot; Zelnorph said and left.<br />
<br />
Madame Morphia watched him leave  and then turning to you asked &quot;Did you speak to him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; you answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;If you speak to him before I finish transforming you he'll twist whatever you say to make it seem like you want to be with him. He can be harsher than me though he doesn't have the power to transform someone. So he beats those he owns nearly to death. I would hate to have to buy you back from him if he is even willing to sell you back to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have laid claim to you as my daughter&quot; Madame Morphia said. &quot;Though that doesn't come into effect until your transformation is complete. You have two more sessions to go before that. Though as long as you don't talk to him before your transformation is complete we do not need to worry about it. Now, it looks like we'll be having lunch in the Earth dimension. Remember Victoria, I can track you if you leave the grounds and give you tremendous pain or I could always transform you into something that's inanimate. Now go ahead and do whatever you want. I would like it if you two stayed so you can see the work I do but I do not insist on this.&quot;<br />
<br />
It seems like you have a golden opportunity to at least make contact with Dan to warn him despite Madame Morphia's warning. Then again it would be interesting to see what was in the files. Of course you could just look around the grounds or do anything else.</p>
