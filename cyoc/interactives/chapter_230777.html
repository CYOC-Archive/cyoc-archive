<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So, what did you do when you found out that dad died?&quot; Sarah asked Glitter as she took a deep breath and thought before responding.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell you that the day I found out about it was one of the hardest days of my life. Outwardly, I made it look like I was saddened to hear about it, but shed no tears publicly. Once I was alone and away from everyone else, I cried like I hadn&#39;t cried before in a long time. I cried for myself, knowing I would never see him again. I cried for Annie, who had lost her best friend and husband, and most of all I cried for you, you shouldn&#39;t have lost him when you were so young.&quot; Glitter said as she wiped tears away from her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was a great dad, he encouraged me to help people in the world, not just sit behind a desk. Maybe he got that from you?&quot; Sarah joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I doubt that. I&#39;ve rarely been outside of the kingdom in years. If I&#39;m not doing work for the kingdom, I&#39;m either sitting alone reading or watching an old episode of Gilmore Girls.&quot; Glitter said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, you watched that show too? It was one of the things mom and I got into not too long after dad died.&quot; Sarah revealed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, it definitely helped me through some tough times, I also liked the sequel they did a few years ago. No one can really top the original show, but it was a good attempt to...capture the magic if you will.&quot; Glitter winked at Sarah who chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come on....mom. That&#39;s still kind of weird to say to you, should I just call you your highness when we&#39;re in public? I don&#39;t mind calling you &#39;mom&#39; when we&#39;re alone.&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like that. Hey, you actually just reminded me, I&#39;ve never been able to do this before, but how about a little karaoke with me on the Gilmore Girls song?&quot; Glitter asked as Sarah chuckled a little. &quot;Sounds fun to me.&quot; Sarah replied.<br />
<br />
Glitter and Sarah pulled up a karaoke version of the song on youtube and they both began to sing along to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Loving you the way I do, I know we&#39;re gonna make it through.&quot; Glitter sang this part of the song.<br />
<br />
&quot;And i would go to the ends of the earth, Oh, darlin&#39;, to me that&#39;s what you&#39;re worth.&quot; Sarah sung this part of the song.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where you lead i will follow. Anywhere that you tell me to. If you need, if you need me to be with you. I will follow where you lead.&quot; Glitter and Sarah both sung this part together and before they knew it, the song was over.<br />
<br />
Sarah looked to see Aloe&#39;la was still passed out from earlier and hadn&#39;t woken up at all, she then looked out to the balcony window and thought about something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, before we go, do you think you could maybe....fly me around the kingdom? I&#39;ve always wondered what it would be like to fly.&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s a little complicated, for one thing, you&#39;re just a little too big for me to carry you. Even with magic, I could barely lift you off the ground, the other thing is, it would look a little silly for the queen to fly around a grown human woman.&quot; Glitter explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then maybe.....&quot; Sarah thought for a minute before coming to a realization. &quot;Maybe transform me into a fairy but younger, but I still have my adult mind?&quot; Sarah suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well....alright, I can&#39;t deny that&#39;s not a bad idea. Just hold on a moment.&quot; Glitter said as she concentrated and used her magic on Sarah. Sarah began to shrink in size now, she shrunk from Glitter&#39;s height to about her waist, Sarah&#39;s hair also transformed into a bright brown hair color than before, then Sarah felt a little ache in her back as wings came out from them. Sarah&#39;s clothes also morphed into a purple leotard over her, so she wouldn&#39;t appear naked.<br />
<br />
Once it was all over, Sarah not resembled a ten year-old fairy with her wings, hair, and clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I look so pretty. How do I look, your majesty? I mean...mommy?&quot; Little Sarah asked as Glitter looked to be holding back happy tears. <br />
<br />
&quot;You look beautiful sweetie. Now hold onto my hand and I&#39;ll guide you as we go, remember to not let go.&quot; Glitter said as she and Sarah went out onto the balcony and leapt into the air.<br />
<br />
Sarah would tell anyone if she could that she was definitely scared, she was up so high, she only had wings to help her fly, and a more experienced woman next to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flap your wings like a butterfly, it&#39;ll get easier in a moment.&quot; Glitter explained as Sarah concentrated and soon she saw she was getting higher now than when they started. Sarah could feel the wind against her as they flew about the city.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember sweetie, don&#39;t let go.&quot; Glitter said as she flew on holding onto Sarah. Sarah was so taken by the fairy kingdom and the lights from above, she almost didn&#39;t hear what Glitter had said as they flew on, Sarah casually let go of Glitter&#39;s hand and began to fall down to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah!&quot; Glitter said as she flew down towards Sarah but was relieved to see that Sarah had closed her eyes tightly and was flying all by herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, look at me! I&#39;m doing it! I&#39;m flying all on my own!&quot; Sarah exclaimed gleefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy for you, now don&#39;t do that again to me.&quot; Glitter said as they flew around the city for a few more minutes before going back into Glitter&#39;s bedchambers where Aloe&#39;la was still passed out.<br />
<br />
Glitter closed and locked the balcony doors behind her again as Sarah went over to a mirror and admired herself in it as she smiled and twirled around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy, I feel like such a princess!&quot; Sarah said in her child voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Sarah, enough with the act, it&#39;s time to change you back. You&#39;ve got business to attend to.&quot; Glitter said as Sarah jumped up into Glitter&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me have a good long hug before we say goodbye.&quot; Little Sarah said as Glitter nodded and the two of them twirled around as Sarah slowly transformed back from fairy to human.<br />
<br />
It was around that time that Aloe&#39;la began to wake up from her long sleep. &quot;Oh, wow, I think I had the most crazy dream, Sarah you were....&quot; Aloe&#39;la began to say before seeing a child fairy transform back into the grown up Sarah still hugging onto Glitter.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been great catching up with you again. You have my word, that I&#39;ll help you however I can, I love you, Sarah.&quot; Glitter said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too, mom.&quot; Sarah said with a smile. &quot;I guess I&#39;ll talk to my human mom some time when I get back about &#39;Gale&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you ever just want to come back here and....just hang out with your mother, I&#39;d love that too.&quot; Glitter said giving Sarah a kiss on the forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;So....we&#39;re good with negotiations?&quot; Aloe&#39;la asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we are. Oh, and Aloe&#39;la, I know you have feelings for Sarah, so just know if you two go through with your relationship, I&#39;ll support you.&quot; Glitter said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thank you, your....&quot; Aloe&#39;la began to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you break her heart in anyway, I&#39;ll make your life a living nightmare.&quot; Queen Glitter said with a devious grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, very funny, your highness, you&#39;re joking right? Your highness?&quot; Aloe&#39;la asked as Glitter opened the door for the two of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aloe&#39;la, Director McMillan, it&#39;s been an honor talking with you two.&quot; Glitter said as the two of them walked out of her chambers.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, your majesty....?&quot; Aloe&#39;la said as the door was shut behind them and locked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, do you think she meant that? Sarah?&quot; Aloe&#39;la asked, but Sarah was much too deep in her own thoughts.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m Sarah McMillan of S.P.E.A.R, but secretly I&#39;m Princess Sarah Thea McMillan, heir to the fae throne. I never thought my life could get more complicated.&#39; Sarah thought to herself as she thought back to her flight with Glitter. It would definitely be one of her fondest memories she would ever keep.</p>
