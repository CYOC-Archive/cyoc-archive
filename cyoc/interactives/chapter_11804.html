<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Oh my god! Jeff, you’re.. you’re a dog morph!” repeated Jeff’s friend Dave as he, Mike and Sven walked uncertainly into the room and around their now furry friend.<br />
Jeff watched and smelled their awe and astonishment, his tail playfully flicking back and forth from his own excitement. <br />
“That’s right, woof, woof, I am a dog morph now. A Great Pyrenees morph to be exact.”<br />
“B-but how?” sputtered Sven.<br />
In between a punctuation of barks and woofs, Jeff told them about the Chronivac 4.0. And while he was telling them about it, they all noticed how calm and enthusiastic he was about being a real live dog morph. They found themselves beginning to relax and lose the skepticism they had toward him. By the end of his explanation, they all could see that he was looking more and more like an anthropomorphic Great Pyrenees and less like a guy in a realistic and anatomically correct fursuit. <br />
He was shrinking down from his 250 pounds to something a little more than a fifth of that. He squatted down in the chair before them and smiled before panting contentedly. <br />
“Well, woof, guys? Woof! What do, woof, you think?<br />
“I want to be an Alaskan Brown Bear morph.” Dave said.<br />
“No, a Draft Horse morph!” Mike told his friends.<br />
“A lion morph!” declared Sven.<br />
Jeff held up a paw-like hand in a gesture telling them to be quiet.<br />
&lt;Wait a minute, guys.&gt; He said to them in a couple of near-intelligible barks and woofs. <br />
His friends glanced amongst themselves. Jeff tried clearing his throat.<br />
&lt;Can you, guys, understand me now?&gt;<br />
He frowned and then sighed before turning around and typing in a couple of buttons.<br />
“Can you, guys, understand me now?” He repeated the question to them.<br />
Dave, Mike and Sven nodded their heads while looking and smelling relieved. Jeff briefly tucks his tail.<br />
“Sorry about that guys, must be a bug in the system somewhere, woof. Anyway, woof, you can’t change into something that- woof- is really going attract that much attention, woof. <br />
If we want to spend the long weekend as morphs, we’re going to have to spend it as dog morphs. As dog morphs capable of walking on all fours if need be, we should be able to fool everyone into believing that we are the real thing. <br />
His friends saw the wisdom in what he told them, and all of them agreed to become dog morphs. Wagging his tail and panting with delight, he started to explain to his friends about how the machine worked. By the time he was done, they were all excited at the prospect of being real live, flesh and blood furries for the whole weekend. And they all agreed that Jeff would be the one to transform them into their new dog morph forms. <br />
Tall and stocky Dave demanded to go first, but was undecided about which of his favorite dog breeds he wanted to become. So he asked his buddies. Jeff, Mike and Sven looked at each other, smiled and then announced in unison. They laughed as they spoke.<br />
“An Old English Sheepdog, of course!” <br />
“Hey! Must you guys always associate me with that breed?”<br />
“Well you look at yourself, Dave!” Sven demanded. “You’re stocky, hirsute and a big admirer of the breed. How else can we not see you being a lumbering, shaggy bear of a dog morph?”<br />
“An Old English Sheepdog.” Dave sighed before nodding and undressing himself. <br />
In a minute, Jeff had the machine programmed for his friend. Almost at once, Dave felt a pleasurable surge of warmth flow through him. <br />
“I do happen to have more than one favorite, you know.” He told Sven.<br />
His friends laughed. <br />
Dave sighed and began telling his friends of how he felt. <br />
“Wow!” Dave laughed as his nose darkened and flared up into something black and wet looking. “I can smell everything. This is, woof, incredible. I know what soaps and shampoos you guys used this morning. And Jeff, you really, woof, smell like a real dog.”<br />
Dave shakes himself and pleasurably sighs as his now stocky, muscular body is enveloped from head to hind paw by a coat of shaggy white and light gray fur.<br />
“Wow, this shaggy fur coat of mine is fantastic, woof! And oh, woof, here comes my tail!”<br />
In short order, Dave found himself wagging his docked tail before looking over the rest of his shaggy dog morph body. <br />
“Man, woof, I never thought I would be, woof,  so handsome as a sheepdog. Woof! Paw-like hands!”<br />
He let out one scared yip at the sight of his cock shrinking and disappearing into a fold of skin connected to his abdomen below the navel. He looks at Jeff desperately. Jeff smiles and shows them that his cock is very much the same way as his is now. Dave happily wags his tail. A moment later, his mouth and nose poked their way out of the mass of white and light gray fur covering his face and grow into the typical muzzle of an Old English Sheepdog. And then his transformation was complete. <br />
 A happy Dave hugged his friends, nuzzled and licked their faces and barked ecstatically. Mike and Sven, at first, were reluctant to hug and pet him. After all, this was Dave they were petting and fondling. Their reluctance went up a notch when Dave decided to sniff at their crotches. But Dave was very happy about the whole deal that his enthusiasm carried them along for the ride. And finally they were able to treat him affectionately like just about any other friendly dog, morph or no morph. <br />
“See.” Jeff told them. “He likes being a large, shaggy dog morph. Just like we thought he would.”<br />
Dave ended his playful romp with his friends and perched his shaggy rear end on the desk, scattering pencils and papers with his happily wagging docked tail.<br />
The next one to go to the dogs was Mike who chose to become a plush-coated Shiloh Shepherd dog morph. In short order, he was covered in a thick black and tan coat. Upon completing his transformation, he let out a wolf’s howl that worried and oddly enough pleased Jeff. Smiling he looked out his window to see if his friend’s howl attracted anyone. <br />
 He turned to find Mike and Dave sniffing at each other’s behinds and acting obnoxiously as they began to play fight with one another. In no time, the two of them were laughing and woofing it up on the bedroom floor. Then Sven opted to become a Toller morph, his number one favorite dog breed. <br />
 With the settings set for next Monday at midnight, Jeff moved the computer to a hidden position atop a bookcase and behind some books. All the while feeling and enjoying the amazing cascade of his newfound canine senses. But now he was experiencing the social feelings of being a part of a pack. Jeff as a Great Pyrenees morph sniffed and rubbed against, play fought and drooled on his pals. They truly were a pack now, and they would work together no matter what. <br />
&lt;Come on pack mates, let’s go to the park for some fun!&gt; He barked at them before dropping to all fours and charging out of the room. Happily they all went after that, laughing and barking all the way as they all trotted outside and followed his lead as they made their way to the park.</p>
