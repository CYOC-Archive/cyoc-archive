<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sound of multiple merpeople talking outside drew Damon, Monica, Chloe, Tim and Ana out of the hotel which they had been waiting in. The crowd was gathered around what the five of them had come to call the town center, since it seemed like a sort of marketplace area and the main government building was there.<br />
“What do you think is going on?” inquired Tim as the crowd parted a bit to show Cura swimming ahead of a group of new merpeople. For a moment both groups of new merpeople just looked at each other studying each other.<br />
Damon with his dark red tail with black strip down the side, Monica with her metallic purple and pink tail holding a merbaby in her arms, Ana and Tim both now graced with royal blue tails, Chloe who’s dark forest green tail swayed back and forth.<br />
Colton with his orange tail with black bottom and back, Harmony with her sky-blue tail with pink highlights which really brought out her bright blonde hair and blue eyes. Lupe with a bright golden tail with red scales on one side which looked like an Aztec dragon and had a huge smile on her face. Adrian with his brown tail had his arms crossed with a stoic look but a happy one, seamed the most plane but the best built. And Stacy who jet black tail was even darker than her own black hair and who smiled brightly as she saw her girlfriend only a few feet away, her own green tail moving back and forth.<br />
“God…Stacy I never thought I would see you again.” Said Chloe as the two swam up to each other and embraced, both holding each other tight as their tails moved back and forth just enough to keep them level. <br />
“I will never leave you.” Said Stacy “I am just happy this wasn’t some big lie and you where back on land.”<br />
“Well it’s not.” Said Tim as the friends came together. <br />
“We can see that…and is that the little man who caused all this trouble?” inquired Colton as he looked at the merchild in Monica’s arms.<br />
“Yes, she is.” Said Monica “We just found out she is a girl, something about the scales being a different shape.”<br />
“I see…” said Harmony as she swam forward and looked at the mermaid baby who was looking around with confusion at all the new people while pulling herself closer to her “mother”.  “She is so cute…and she even looks like you and Damon…even the tail.”<br />
“What?” inquired Ana “Her tail is blue while their tails are…”<br />
She looked and the baby’s tail had changed from the light aqua blue which would have been a close color to Harmony’s own tail to a darker red like Damon’s only with metallic flecks like Monica’s pink and purple tail. The child’s blonde hair was now darker as well and her face looked different as well.<br />
“What the?” inquired Monica as she looked at her new daughter.<br />
“Ah…she is about done as well.” Said Cura as she placed her hand on the baby’s forehead. “The magic is a two-way current, she transformed you and Damon into her parents and she transformed herself into your child.” <br />
“What?” asked Damon confused as he looked at the child, she did have his nose now and Monica’s skin tone and hair color but had his tail color. <br />
“She is as she would be if you and your wife had given birth to her.” Explained Cura “She is your daughter not just by our law but by blood.”<br />
“Our daughter.” Said Monica breathlessly as she looked at her and Damon’s child with tears in her eyes.<br />
“But what about her birth family, what if the mother and father had family?” inquired Adrian<br />
“By our laws and custom that child is Monica’s and Damon’s and not theirs anymore. The magic is meant to make sure the baby lives on and in ancient past the only way some families kept abounded children was if they magically where transformed into their own blood.” explained Cura “Come let’s go inside, I am sure you all have questions and are hungry.”<br />
They swam inside the hotel and to what looked to be a sort of meeting room with a table made of coral and large benches on either side, which allowed them to sit with their tails spread out under the table. Monica was still holding onto her daughter who was now asleep her head resting on her mother’s chest so she could hear her heart beat.<br />
“Well we have a lot to go over, so lets start with some basic stuff.” Said Cura as she proceeded to tell them about some of the more basic stuff about being a mermaid and merman. Some of it was like how they used the restroom, how they ate and how they made love. They talked about mersociety set up how their where multiple kings in a grand alliance with a single high king and many powerful families. <br />
The food arrived, it was not surprising fish but there was also different seaweed and colorful coral. Everyone watched as Cura took a bite of the coral, to a human this would have been a rock but she ate it like it was a piece of bread. Adrian was the first to try the coral and to his amazement it had taste and tasted very good. The seaweed also had different tastes as they ate the food.<br />
“Ah…question what are we going to do for jobs?” inquired Colton<br />
“Well from what we have heard Harmony and Monica are nurses in the human world, that will be useful down here.” Stated Cura “What of the rest of you?”<br />
“I am an Uber driver not much used down here.” Stated Adrian “But I was in the army before that.”<br />
“That could be useful, we have armies as well but we could also use hunters and defenders from sharks and the like.” Stated Cura<br />
“Tim was in the army as well.” Added Ana “I am or was a teacher.”<br />
“I don’t know if it will be any use or not but I work in IT and repairing computers and the like.” Stated Damon<br />
“We study human technology and adapt it where we can, that may require you to go to a larger city we are just a farming and fishing community.” Stated Cura before raising her hand. “Don’t worry, you will all do well either here or in one of our other communities…now if what I have heard is true then transformation takes a lot out of you.”<br />
Everyone shared a look among each other, they where all tired but the rush from dealing with all these new items had kept them awake. <br />
“I recommend you all retire and in the morning we will talk more about what to do.” said Cura as she moved away from the table. “We have arranged rooms for all of you, the couples sharing a room of course, now get some rest there will be a lot to do an a lot for you to learn tomorrow.”</p>
