<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adam couldn&#39;t move. Couldn&#39;t see. He&#39;d been stuck in the cage forever. His whole body was constricted within too small a space. Straps enlaced his whole shaft, all five inches of it (he was small, so what?). Sometimes, the cage vibrated. Not much. Enough to feel nice on his dickhead, enough to keep him awake and aware. To remind him, again and again, of his status as a tool at a bastard&#39;s mercy. He would hyperventilate, if he had lungs. He didn&#39;t. <br />
<br />
Dicks couldn&#39;t breathe. <br />
<br />
Couldn&#39;t speak. <br />
<br />
Couldn&#39;t move. <br />
<br />
Couldn&#39;t do anything, except cum.<br />
<br />
Not even that much, right now. Despite how badly he wanted to. Drips of pre accumulated at his slit, seeping into the fabric, widening the spot. A whole section felt cooler to the touch now. Felt... good. It was all he could feel. The cool, the frustration of being teased, the constraint over his body. <br />
<br />
It was bad enough being his own penis when he could see and feel things around him. At least, he could remember how to think outside of the tests. The tests... they weren&#39;t bad. Adam... Adam loved them. Couldn&#39;t wait until the next ones. Couldn&#39;t lie to himself and pretend he wasn&#39;t looking forward to new tests every day. When Hugo just shoved him in a contraption and used him, rocked him, thrusted him, when the world narrowed down to warmth and friction and the build-up deep in his balls, Adam... Adam loved being a dick. <br />
<br />
The cage&#39;s mechanisms thrummed and the fabric around him started to buzz gently. To rub against him, against the very tip of his dickhead, just *there*. To stroke circles on his balls, to stimulate their churning. The build-up started again, so deliciously tantalizing, and-<br />
<br />
It stopped. The cage stopped. Every. Fucking. Time. <br />
<br />
He. Wanted. To. Cum! <br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t wait till Hugo took him out of this thing. He&#39;d hold back as best as he could. Be the better test subject for him. Be the perfect dick, just so he could feel what dicks were made to feel. <br />
<br />
That was all he wanted to be right now. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Joey woke up, again, and frantically tried to fight off the paralysis, again. And saw the lab&#39;s white walls again. <br />
<br />
He denied that the thought made him hard. Just like Hugo&#39;s indifference didn&#39;t make him hard. It was unfair to hold that against him. He was a dick! That was all dicks could do! That and cum. Shit, he wanted to cum now. <br />
<br />
For fuck&#39;s sake, he&#39;d only cheated at an exam, he wasn&#39;t a criminal! Why was he being held prisoner? He&#39;d find a way to change back. Something would happen to transform him back into a man, he knew it would! <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Oliver laughed to himself as Matthew was replaced gently on his usual spot. He couldn&#39;t imagine Matthew&#39;s thoughts, but he figured it might be something panicked. Scared. Poor guy had never even had sex before. Seeing him like that really didn&#39;t help Oliver understand. Guy was a fucking stallion. He&#39;d have fucked him just to try that dick. <br />
<br />
Mason too, the big slut. Eight inches of cock that were being pumped through one of those milkers. Enough to make somecock jealous.<br />
<br />
Oliver personally thought it wasn&#39;t a big deal, being a dick. No one expected anything out of you. No stress, no pressure. No overbearing families. Just days of doing nothing and spewing seed every so often. <br />
<br />
It was a good life. Surely, the others understood that?<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
I&#39;m a cock I&#39;m a cock I&#39;m a cock I&#39;m a cock I&#39;m a cock I&#39;m a cock I&#39;m a cock I&#39;m a cock I&#39;m a cock I&#39;m a cock I&#39;m a cock I&#39;m a cock <br />

<br />
Felix entered the amphitheater with his boyfriend. There&#39;d been a rumor going around campus. Something big was about to happen. Something to do with all the guys getting turned into their dicks. It was immensely strange, in Felix&#39;s opinion. But also, intriguing? How did it work? Why did they choose to lose their human lives in favor of being living sex toys?<br />
<br />
What did it feel like? <br />
<br />
Probably good, he realized with a blush as Charles walked him toward a few tables on the side of the room. One of them was lined up with a handful of dildos of varying sizes and shapes. No, not dildos, he thought again. They were hardening or softening accordingly with curious guest&#39;s touches. Some were still in their boxes, waiting to be opened. <br />
<br />
&#39;Free sample penises&#39; said the sign. &#39;Replace when done, I will know.&#39;<br />
<br />
Hanging from the table to the immediate left, three dicks had been tightly bound upside down and were weeping cum into plastic cups. The cardboard cut-out for this one was &#39;I DID warn you&#39;. The short, smug words sent a flash of want through Felix&#39;s groin. It looked so real. He couldn&#39;t take his eyes off the black, chubby cock in the middle. That HAD to be Allan. He&#39;d recognize those balls anywhere, and Allan was a real horndog, he&#39;d try to get away with a dicked guy. <br />
<br />
Charles, good sports, tossed a coin into the donation box and pushed the glass under Allan toward Felix&#39;s mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here, luv, your favorite chocolate milk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felix snorted and shoved Charles. &quot;Fucker,&quot; he said fondly. <br />
<br />
Charles leaned in, dropping the cup back on the table. He grinned evilly and put his hands on Felix&#39;s hips. &quot;Oh, soon. Very soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
The promise in those smoldering eyes made Felix&#39;s dick twitch. Damn. He loved it when his boyfriend talked like that. Charles&#39; hands squeezed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, look,&quot; he said, teasing, &quot;the show&#39;s starting. Better find our seats.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felix&#39;s cock begged him to stop Charles, but his bigger brain prevailed this one time and led him to follow his boyfriend into the theater itself. Their seats were right in the middle, in-between tall, gentle Nick and campus prankster Jordan. <br />
<br />
Before they could start a conversation, the lights turned off in the room, and the projector in the back sparked to life. <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings, my name is Hugo and I will be the host of this dick-based auction. As you might be aware, some of you have recently chosen to experience life differently,&quot; - lewd laughter rang from the front rows, along with some wolf-whistling - &quot;and there is nothing wrong with that. Now, the community here has given a lot of funds for our research, and thus it was agreed by the participants that they would auction themselves to you tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felix&#39;s gasp got caught in his throat as his heart fluttered in his chest. He shot a look at Charles, who looked back with a horny grin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, before we start the official bids, I believe it is tradition for spectators that wish to do so to come on stage and offer themselves in an &#39;amateur&#39; round of bidding. Do any of you wish to be dicked for the sake of being sold for our university&#39;s prestige and funds?&quot;</p>
