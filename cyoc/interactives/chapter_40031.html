<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In an underground chamber a pink puff of smoke appeared inside two glass domes, one nestled inside the other. Jen dropped out of the pink smoke and another puff appeared outside the glass domes. Hanna appeared out of it and landed easily. Jen wasn't so lucky, she landed hard on her side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meow! That hurt nya&quot; Jen said. &quot;Why did you do that Hanna nya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know me creature?&quot; Hanna demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't call me creature nya!&quot; Jen said getting angry. As she got angry the fire on her wings intensified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me who you are&quot; Hanna demanded. &quot;How do you know me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's me Hanna nya&quot; Jen said. &quot;Don't you recognize me nya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I recognized you I wouldn't be asking who you are&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Jen Hanna nya&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen?&quot; Hanna asked with a surprised look on her face. &quot;What happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle Perkins cursed me nya&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean that Kyle Perkins is the one we've been looking for?&quot; Hanna asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;According to Gina he is nya&quot; Jen said. &quot;Why did you put me in here nya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was to prevent you from transforming more&quot; Hanna explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;If Kyle can't speak to me then how can he transform me nya?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once Kyle asked you Transform or Dare it created a link between you two&quot; Hanna said. &quot;With that link he can transform you wherever you may be. You're safe in there for now. These domes are designed to block that link. As long as one or the other dome is closed Kyle can't transform you. The only way in or out is through the doors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you teleported me in here nya&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both doors were open a tiny crack&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Once you were in the doors were shut completely. It's standard proceedure when coming in hot to lock down the Containment Chamber once someone is inside. That means that no one goes in or out for twenty-four hours. That's why I had to drop you. If I didn't make it back out before the doors closed I would have been stuck in there with you. Not that I wouldn't want to be with you. It's just that I have things to do around here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I'm stuck in here for a day nay!?!&quot; Jen asked. &quot;What about food nya? And how am I supposed use the bathroom nya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a supply of food in the chest&quot; Hanna said. &quot;As for going to the bathroom, there is a toilet and shower in there too along with a bed for you to sleep on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked around the dome and saw the chest, bed, toilet, and shower. The toilet and shower were out in the open. &quot;Hey nya!&quot; she said. &quot;What about privacy nya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Jen but you don't get any privacy in there&quot; Hanna said. &quot;This is so we can keep an eye on any transformations that may happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you said Kyle can't transform me in here nya&quot; Jen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He may have given you a delayed transformation be I got you in there&quot; Hanna said. &quot;We should be able to tell if that's the case within twenty-four hours. Don't worry about any perverts seeing you. All the agents that watch the Containment Chamber are carefully selected and trained. They are very proffesional. Now I must go give my report. I'll see you later.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a puff of pink smoke Hanna was gone and Jen went to see what there was to eat in the chest.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Gina and Lady Tsunade had just arrived in Director Musha's office when Hanna appeared out of a puff of pink smoke. &quot;I guess you got Jen into the Containment Chamber in time&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll see if I did or not&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sure you did&quot; Lady Tsunade said. &quot;You acted without hesitation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just hope it was soon enough&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you sense?&quot; Lady Tsunade said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The immediate danger is past but there is something on the horizon&quot; Hanna said. &quot;I can't tell what it is yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I hope you can see it before it's too late&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady Tsunade, Agent Barry, Agent Walsh&quot; Director Musha said as he came into his office from a side door. He was a short man of Japanese descent though he had a presence about him that commanded respect. &quot;Would you care to tell me why there was a Code Red Charlie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a vision of a huge sphinx like creature attacking the village&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Naruto fought it and died. The Nine Tailed Fox was released and the two devastated this village and then the world. When I saw Jen I knew she was the one from my vision and immediately called the code.&quot;<br />
<br />
Director Musha looked at Lady Tsunade and said &quot;Lady Tsunade, I assume you brought her here. Why did you when there was a danger?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am the Fifth Hokage of the Village Hidden in the Leaves&quot; Lady Tsunade said. &quot;It is my responsibility to make sure this village is safe. If I had thought there might be a danger I would not have brought her here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was my fault sir&quot; Gina said. &quot;I may have given Kyle Perkins a clue that I'm an agent when he admitted that he transformed Jen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't arrest him?&quot; Director Musha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No sir&quot; Gina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well your assignment was to find and arrest him&quot; Director Musha said. &quot;I expect it to be carried out. Now you and Agent Walsh will arrest this Kyle Perkins immediately. Is that understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir!&quot; Gina and Hanna said at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Director Musha said. &quot;Now Lady Tsunade, I expect you to be more careful in the future. You can't be bringing dangerous people into HQ.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Need I remind you that you and your agency are here at my discretion?&quot; Lady Tsunade asked. &quot;You do not have any authority over me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are just a civilian&quot; Director Musha said. &quot;I have full authority over you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My patience with you is wearing thin&quot; Lady Tsunade said. &quot;If I so wish I will banish you and your agency from this village.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not make idle threats&quot; Director Musha said. &quot;My agents are very well trained.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your agents may be well trained but never forget that this village is full of ninja and that I am Hokage&quot; Lady Tsunade said. &quot;We are more than a match for your agents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lady Tsunade and Director Musha glared at each other. They have had this disagreement before and they usually cooled off after a few moments. This time however it looked like things may escalate. Just then Naruto, Sakura, Chizune, Sam, Alex, and Tiffany burst into the office.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a problem&quot; Sakura said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are these people Lady Tsunade!&quot; Director Musha demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're my friends sir&quot; Gina said. &quot;I personally vouch for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I vouch for them too sir&quot; Hanna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They shouldn't be here!&quot; Director Musha nearly yelled, a vien standing out on his forehead.<br />
<br />
Hanna was looking at what Naruto was holding in his hand. It was a headband that had four diagonal lines on it. &quot;Naruto, where did you find that Mist Headband?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was on the helicopter's landing struts&quot; Naruto said. &quot;There was a note attached to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does it say?&quot; Lady Tsunade asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It says that Zabuza is returning to seek revenge on me and Kakashi&quot; Naruto said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you that it's not possible&quot; Sam said. &quot;Zabuza is dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I don't know that!?!&quot; Naruto asked. &quot;I was there when he died.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will somebody explain what's going on here!?!&quot; Alex nearly yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zabuza was a rogue ninja from the Village Hidden in the Mists&quot; Hanna said. &quot;He died shortly after avenging his friend Haku's death. So the note doesn't make any sense. Zabuza had his revenge on the one who killed Haku andhe died.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is an ancient jutsu that can summon the dead&quot; Lady Tsunade said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What!?!&quot; everyone asked with surprised looks on their faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a difficult jutsu to perform&quot; Lady Tsunade said. &quot;It often kills whoever uses it since it takes so much chakra. If one were to be succesful though they can control those that they summon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So someone could be summoning Zabuza for their own revenge on Naruto and Kakashi&quot; Hanna said. &quot;Though why was it in the clearing and how did it get on the helicopter's landing struts?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those are good questions&quot; Lady Tsunade said.</p>
