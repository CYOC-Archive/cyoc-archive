<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The dinner had gone well, though there was still some underlying tension, particularly in relation to the meeting at City Hall. Eric had known that the rumors about it at school had upset Julie in the sense of people often asking her about it, and he got some sense that Martin Stovall had some general idea on what the meeting was about when he&#39;d said he was going to stay in the back of the meeting during dinner. It gave him some hint that something was really going on with this meeting that neither Martin Stovall could share nor the others at school fully knew. It left things rather quiet as the table was cleared those at the Stovall residence not going to the meeting settled into their nighttime routines.<br />
<br />
Eric and Julie watched quietly as Melissa Stovall went upstairs, and it wasn&#39;t too long before they could hear the sound of the upstairs master bathroom being filled. From there, the two young weremers made their way out into the backyard and then the cabana. Inside they changed into a pair of swimsuits and moved out and to the pool, which had become something of a spot that both Eric and Julie felt comfortable at. It was where Julie began to truly help him &quot;get used&quot; to Moon Lake and all its secrets and where their romantic relationship began to go beyond just seeing each other at school. It was where they had what Eric still felt to be the most wonderful moment of his life, when he became a weremerman and could be with Julie in every way and for as long as they lived. In that, the Stovall family&#39;s pool was special to both of them. <br />
<br />
Though the meeting and all the tension that went with still hovered over them. Instead of jumping in and actively swimming, Eric simply sat down on the edge of the pool and let his legs hang over into the water. The rumors played back through his mind, as did Julie&#39;s frustration with those rumors, and some of the unease that he could tell was at the dinner table. Some of the questions he&#39;d asked around with regard to actually forming a &quot;chess club&quot; at the school didn&#39;t even enter his mind at the moment. The underlying tension with the meeting was that high. Julie noticed this and instead of walking down the stairs  into the pool and just turned to sit down beside Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; Julie said softly to Eric as she sat down.<br />
<br />
Eric looked to her, and smiled as he looked into her blue eyes and the blonde hair that framed her face. Her soft features and her smile made him smile, as just being near her made him feel that all was right in the world. Though it wasn&#39;t enough to fully end some of the tensions and concerns over other things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I&#39;m okay,&quot; Eric managed to smile back, &quot;I suppose I&#39;m bit concerned over everything that&#39;s gone on. This meeting... and all the rumors it has spawned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the rumors will probably be settled by the meeting tonight,&quot; Julie commented carefully. <br />
<br />
She had some awareness that the meeting related to the possible revealing of weres to the world, but because of the sensitive nature of things that related to it, her father had made her promise not to share what he&#39;d been told was the purpose of this special meeting until after the news was fully reported. It had been something that had made the rumors frustrating for her because she had to keep silent on things. She often had been able to share things that she&#39;d picked up from time to time with friends at school, but those cases were often with rather small things, things like legislation on parking laws, garbage and recycling ordinances, and so on. Those things were fairly easy to share, and even some things that related to Moon Lake&#39;s were population, such as the concerns over Yvette Smith&#39;s actions, was still something that could be shared. The were secret, however, was different, and she couldn&#39;t talk on that in order try and prevent there being a panic. That was the thing that made dealing with rumors the most frustrating, but she&#39;d made it through the week.<br />
<br />
Julie then took Eric&#39;s hand and felt her hands shift as she changed into her stage two form. Webbing grew between her fingers and ran practically all the way to the fingertips even as she held all her boyfriend&#39;s hand. Goldfish scales ran down her legs and her feet lengthened until they practically resembled flippers. On her back her gill slits opened slightly and became a bit more visible to anyone that might have been behind her. Eric could feel her change and Julie smiled as he began to instinctively change as well. The bones in his feet cracking a bit as they lengthened into a more flipper-like shape and blue green scales covered his legs. The scales on both of them came up to their waists, but that was presently covered by their swimsuits at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;And for the moment... we can&#39;t know how that will be resolved,&quot; Julie said to him, &quot;we can only hope that what is discussed and decided is something that is acceptable to all sides.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure...&quot; Eric commented, &quot;though that won&#39;t stop many people from being nervous. And I think even your parents were a bit nervous about all of this at dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie nodded, and supposed they were. After all, Moon Lake had lived by keeping the were secret for as long as it existed. Suddenly revealing it would mean major changes, and even if it was for a good reason, it likely wouldn&#39;t be easy. It was that that probably made her father the most nervous, for if it did happen it would be under his watch as mayor that the reveal would take place.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s understandable,&quot; Julie spoke, &quot;but for the moment it&#39;s beyond our control. All we can control... you and I, my love, is our love and personal happiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am happy by your side, my Jewel,&quot; Eric smiled to her kissed her cheek, though it soon turned more passionate for a moment or too. The two did pull back with matching smiles as their matching blue eyes gazed to each other.<br />
<br />
Julie squeezed Eric&#39;s hand slightly and privately still wishing she could think of a nickname for Eric that matched the one he&#39;d given her, &quot;my Jewel.&quot; Some other weres might consider that sort of thing rather sappy, but to weremers and their were-species biggest specialty being their ability to see their &quot;one true love&quot; at first sight, it was perfect. Julie wouldn&#39;t have it any other way, and she was continually pleased by Eric matching that feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;So let us put those worries aside for now,&quot; Julie said to him, &quot;the water isn&#39;t too cold, it is a beautiful night, and we are with our one true loves. What could be better than that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our wedding day after we graduate high school or college... whichever our parents will allow for first,&quot; Eric offered with a small grin, which Julie only laughed to.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s still a few years off,&quot; Julie laughed and slid off the edge of the pool and into the water, pulling Eric with her, &quot;Let&#39;s focus on what is more immediate. It doesn&#39;t have to be sexual... it doesn&#39;t even have to be &quot;romantic&quot; in the traditional sense. We can just swim together and enjoy being together and hope for a bright future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If our shared dreams are prophecy dreams from our future...&quot; Eric commented, &quot;I&#39;d imagine our future will be very bright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie smiled at that and the two soon relaxed onto the top of the pool. They actually didn&#39;t do a lot of active swimming as they lay on their backs and looked up toward the sky above them. For the moment things seemed calm and tranquil with a rather clear night sky and the twinkling of the stars down on them. They floated together quietly with Eric wrapping one arm around Julie&#39;s shoulders, her silky hair brushing against his arm as they settled into some quiet stargazing. Concerns over the meeting and what it might mean were still there, but with Julie beside him, there would always be hope for the better as far as Eric was concerned.</p>
