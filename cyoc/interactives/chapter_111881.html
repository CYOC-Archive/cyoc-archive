<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the next few months, the three of us sort of fall into a routine. Almost every day after school, Jake comes over, does some homework, and hangs out with Atla and me before he has to go to work at his uncle&#39;s bait shop. On weekends he&#39;d spend the whole day with us, but lately he&#39;s been spending more time with a certain Ms. Jordan Robertson. She was always nice to us in school and Jake crushed on her badly, but he was convinced she would never go out with him. So he cashed in a favor and I made him a little taller, gave him some more muscle so he doesn&#39;t look like a string bean, and got rid of his acne. He didn&#39;t need the changes to impress her, but for the sake of his confidence I let it go.<br />
<br />
Atla and I met with them a few weeks after to go to a movie together. Atla thought they looked adorable together and really likes Jordan too. I would&#39;ve have invited them over to the house but she would see Atla&#39;s tail. As her pregnancy progressed, Atla got very huge very fast and it became very uncomfortable and difficult for her to stay on land too long so  she spent more and more of her time in the pool. To make it more livable for her, I turned it into salt water, made it go further into my backyard and made it deeper. It goes so deep that I added a hidden basement to the house to act like a Bat Cave for all of our mermaid stuff. Instead of glass separating the dry room from the pool, I put magical barrier that only Atla, Jake, and myself can see and move through.<br />
<br />
We are sticking through this routine and all three of us are patiently waiting for Atla to give birth. Today we are about three weeks out from the doctor&#39;s predicted arrival and I&#39;m in the Mer Cave waiting for Jake to come over from school. Atla lays on the pool floor, rubbing her belly. &quot;Chris?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, babe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think we have more than one baby in here?&quot; I look at my very swollen girlfriend. Her stomach has grown beyond any I have ever seen, maybe four feet from her hips. I swear her hips have gotten wider too, to accomodate her heavy load. Her breasts have grown also, to a L cup from her regular DD. Even the width of her tail has grown to help her move around the water. &quot;More than likely. How many kids do merpeople usually have at once?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we can be hatched in groups of five to ten. Do you think we have ten babies in here?&quot; Atla rubs her belly nervously. &quot;I don&#39;t know babe. I could use the ring to find out for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I want it to be a surprise. I just wanted to know what you think. I&#39;m a little worried. Those books say giving birth can be very painful with just one. But I&#39;m huge! What if I don&#39;t make it?&quot; She&#39;s starts to tear up, or she would if she wasn&#39;t underwater. Poor Atla, these hormones are really doing a number on her. I go through the magical wall and into the pool to sit by her side. &quot;Oh Atla, baby, no. You&#39;ll be fine.&quot; I gently rub her belly which feels very soft and moves a little under my touch. &quot;Nothing is going to go wrong. And if it does, I can stop it. You feel okay, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like a whale.&quot;Atla tries to get up by herself but the weight of her belly has been getting too heavy for her to move by herself. I help her get comfortable again and kiss her on the forehead. &quot;Baby you&#39;re not a whale.&quot; I will never tell her this but I had to wish myself bigger to be able to lift her easily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Chris. I can&#39;t even get up underwater without you helping me. I bet I have barnacles but I can&#39;t even see the backside of my tail. I&#39;m massive!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have barnacles, angelfish.&quot; I have been looking. With her hips being so wide now, her ass has bulked up and, man, I can&#39;t wait to see that once the belly&#39;s gone. &quot;And you look beautiful.&quot; I float up to her and playfully peck her lips. Atla giggles as I move my trail of kisses down her neck and onto her chest. &quot;Uh please, Chris. Can you wish off this bra until Jake gets here? It&#39;s feeling very tight.&quot; And with a kiss, the bra disappears. And her breasts fall forward, unrestrained and free to breathe. They look bigger than yesterday but all the better for me. And the babies, of course. I swim down float in front of her. Her aching nipples look very sore from so much pressure. I float back up to her face. &quot;Looks like they&#39;ve grown babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Again? These babies better be thristy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, you look hot.&quot; Atla twirls one of her beautiful brown and blue curls in her hair. &quot;I do feel kind of sexy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The sexiest.&quot; I half-lay, half-float on one of her boobs. &quot;Please, you just like me big and pregnant.&quot; She acts annoyed but she&#39;s just playing around. Atla loves this little game. I do too. &quot;And what if I do? Don&#39;t I make you feel good?&quot; I slide down her body letting my short&#39;s &quot;special guest&quot; graze her as I do. I stop on her tail and am about to make my move...<br />
<br />
Knock, knock, knock. &quot;Hey its me Jake. Let me know if guys are decent.&quot; Great mood killer, Jake. But he&#39;s right. And we don&#39;t want another, ahem, walk in. Last week, he kind of saw me, &quot;unleash the beast&quot; when Atla was about to tame it...with her mouth. Hey a guy and his girl have needs and we&#39;ve been trying to reach them with such a big belly in the way. We&#39;ve moved past it, but he still looks at me weird sometimes. So I wish up a new, bigger top for Atla, kiss her belly, slap her scaley booty, and swim out into the basement. I unlock the door and fist bump Jake. &quot;Sup dude, come on in.&quot; He walks in and tosses his bag on the table and grabs a chair. &quot;Hey Atla, how is the belly today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jake. It&#39;s been okay with Chris helping me out, but it&#39;s just so big. Its basically got me pinned here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow that must be crazy...&quot; Jake looks over to me &quot;Remember you did that to her. You gotta take care of her- Oh jeez man!&quot; Jake shields his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, what happened?&quot;<br />
&quot;Dude, put that thing away!&quot; I look down and my mast is still up and ready, and it&#39;s pitched a super tent in my shorts. &quot;What? You interrupted some Mommy-time. And some things don&#39;t go away as fast.&quot; Jake looks to Atla and shakes his head. &quot;You deserve better than this scoundrel.&quot; She laughs and I take my seat. &quot;See its gone now. It won&#39;t scare you anymore.&quot; He carefully brings his head around and breathes out with relief. &quot;Jesus, man. You gotta watch where you point that thing. Now back to business. You gonna help me with my homework or no?&quot; I pull his notebook and textbooks out of his bag and we get to work. Well not really work, we laugh and goof too. I wish up some snacks, we joke with Atla, he tries to beat me in a arm wrestling contest, and he tells me about his day. We really do love it when Jake comes over. It makes us kind of feel like parents. When we&#39;re done with his homework, Jake busts out some playing cards and we play the game of men: go fish.<br />
<br />
While we&#39;re picking out our hands, Jake yells back to Atla. &quot;Now Atla, you know the rules. No helping your boyfriend cheat, okay?&quot; We laugh but no response from the pool. &quot;Babe you okay?&quot; No response. Jake and I look at each other, drop our cards, and run over to the barrier. Atla is still there, but she&#39;s breathing hard and holding her tummy. I jump in and swim to her side and hold her hand. &quot;Atla, baby, you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looks at me with a terrified look in her eyes. &quot;I think, I think it&#39;s time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s time? Time for...&quot; Atla squeezes my hand hard and cries out before I can finish. Jake splashes his hand on the barrier wall. &quot;Guys what&#39;s wrong?&quot; I look at her belly, then back to her eyes. Atla nods. &quot;Jake! It&#39;s time! She&#39;s in labor!&quot;</p>
