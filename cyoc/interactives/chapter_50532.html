<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A while later she went home. They had talked for some time about what to do, but had come to no real conclusion. Having any more sex was obviously out for the foreseeable future, but he risked a kiss and then waited tensely to see if any more changed were forthcoming. In the event nothing happened, so he helped her put her halter back on then watched as she hopped off down the street. Closing the door once she was out of sight he went back into the living room and looked around at the mess they had made, then down at his changed body with a despondent sigh. <br />
<br />
He began to clear up the room, but stopped after a couple of minutes annoyed at the way his huge breasts dangled and swung around whenever he bent over. Stuck with a thought, he went into his room and looked through his clothes. Sure enough, the curse had been typically thorough, and he found in his top dresser drawer a number of neatly folded halters similar to the ones he had worn when a full kangarootaur, but slightly larger to allow for his still-male torso. Holding one up he was embarrassed to see it still had holes in it for his enormous nippled to stick through, but after a moment shrugged making his breasts shake. There wasn't much he could do about the situation. <br />
<br />
Pulling the halter over his head he struggled to he it past his breasts but managed after a moment or two. Tugging it into place, he pulled his nipples through the holes, looking down in amazement at them as they grew erect under the stimulation of being handled. It was still jarring for him how big the damn things were, sticking out several inches. They looked more like something you'd find on a cow.<br />
<br />
Rummaging further, now his breasts were under control, he dug out underwear and pants, both of which looked rather odd, cut as they now were for both his tail and forelegs. It took a little experimentation but he worked out how to put them on, his forelegs sticking out from the front and his tail from the rear. He also found a large t-shirt which went over the halter, but also had holes for his nipples. The curse seemed determined that these would be exposed at all times. Having discovered how sensitive to touch they were he sort of understood.<br />
<br />
Finally dressed, he returned to the living room and finished cleaning everything up. His parents would be back in the evening and he didn't want any evidence of their drinking lying around.<br />
<br />
Once he had finished tidying up, he went outside to his SUV. A couple of neighbours were walking past in the road, and to his slight surprise simply waved to him as if his large-busted, exposed-nipple, kangaroo-tailed, eared, and forelegged body was completely normal. He waved back, realising once more how powerful and complete the curse really was. When you thought about it, he and Jennifer had gotten off lightly. There were much worse changes that could have been made.<br />
<br />
Looking into the vehicle, he frowned. There was something different about it. He unlocked it and opened the driver's door. After a moment he realised that the seat looked odd, because it was modified from a normal one to allow someone with four feet of thick muscular tail sprouting from their lower back to get into it. He tried it, and found that it took a little more effort than getting into a car had originally done before he was changed, but it wasn't difficult and WAS surprisingly comfortable. What wasn't comfortable was the seat-belt. It compressed one of his new breasts fairly unpleasantly, and it took some fiddling to get the shoulder strap passing between them rather than over them.<br />
<br />
He drove to the supermarket to get groceries to replace the food he'd eaten over the period his parents were away. Once more, it was a bit odd to find out that no one gave his a second glance. He was very aware of his changes, feeling his breasts move every time he did would take a lot of getting used to. At one point he managed to sweep a couple of dozen cans of beans off a display with his tail when he turned around, and even then the shop worker who came running to clean up seemed more annoyed at the mess than surprised it had been caused by a half-kangaroo teenager with huge tits.<br />
<br />
The tail was really a nuisance, in fact. While the breasts were weird, and he barely noticed the ears and to a degree the forelegs (which after a little trial and error he kept folded against his body), the tail stuck out so far it was forever banging into things he though were a safe distance away. It was going to take quite a while to become proficient at dealing with it.<br />
<br />
Once he had returned home, he decided to take a bath then go to bed. In the bath he played with his pouch and forelegs for a bit, experimenting with his changed body. Eventually he found himself tweaking and rubbing his breasts, and almost automatically his forepaws began playing with his cock, which rapidly became erect. The changes made masturbation very weird but amazingly satisfying, and it wasn't until after he orgasmed that he had a sudden unpleasant thought. Did this count as sex as far as the curse was concerned?<br />
<br />
When half an hour had gone by with no further changes, he finally relaxed. Apparently it didn't count. So for the moment he was safe, as long as he and Jennifer refrained from intercourse. drying himself off he climbed into bed, wondering what the next days and weeks would bring, and how long it would be before he could look at himself in a mirror and not be surprised at the reflection.</p>
