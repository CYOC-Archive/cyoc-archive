<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a good hour later by the time Sharon and Mary had returned. Mary had a huge grin on her face as they saw Mike who was watching TV. <br />
<br />
&#39;How&#39;s it going Michelle?&#39; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
&#39;Shut-up Mary. I&#39;m just counting down the hours. 2 and a half to go&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;About that Mike. I am going to ask you to do us a favour&#39; said Sharon. She looked a bit sheepish.<br />
<br />
&#39;What is it Mum?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well you may have overheard at breakfast that one of the girls injured herself last night. ..... Well after you left breakfast Mrs Maloney the cheerleading coach took your seat. She was in a dilemma. Evidently we were entered as a team of eight for these regionals and with Katelin going home that left only 5 girls and the two boys Tom and Alistair. The opening ceremony is at 12 and all team members have to be there&#39;<br />
<br />
Mike was feeling sick in the stomach. It wasn&#39;t just that she had eaten too much. She didn&#39;t like where this conversation was going.<br />
<br />
Sharon continued. &#39;It was Tess&#39;s idea. She suggested to Mrs Maloney &quot;Why don&#39;t you enter Mary&#39;s twin Michelle as the 6th girl. She&#39;s a pretty little thing like Mary&quot; Well we all thought that was a good idea so I gave my consent&#39;<br />
<br />
Mary cut in &#39;Mrs Maloney had spotted you as you left the restaurant. She thought it was me and was surprised when I apparently ignored her greeting&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Anyway to cut a long story short Mrs Maloney should by now have added Michelle Strong to the team list. You now in the cheerleading team and will need to be at the opening ceremony in uniform with the rest of the team&#39; finished off Sharon<br />
<br />
&#39;But Mum you can&#39;t do that to me! I&#39;m not a girl. I don&#39;t know how to dance, I don&#39;t know any of the cheers they have been practicing&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well it was either give my consent or the team would have to forfeit. Besides cheerleading isn&#39;t just for girls, there are two boys in the team. Mrs Maloney assured me that she could give you a simple role in the routines that with a bit of practice anyone could do&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Those boys aren&#39;t pretending to be a girl. Besides if I do that, how am I going to change back at 12?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well sometimes we just have to make sacrifices for the greater good. You were going to be here watching for the weekend anyhow. The only difference is that you will now have a grandstand seat&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;What do you mean?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You are going to stay as Michelle until the competition is completed at about 3 pm tomorrow&#39;<br />
<br />
Just then there was a knock on the door. Mary answered and let a woman in. <br />
<br />
The woman immediately approached Mike &#39;Hi. You must be Michelle. I&#39;m the cheerleading coach, you should call me coach or Mrs Maloney. It&#39;s so good of you to help us out. I got your name entered just in the nick of time&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I didn&#39;t..&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Did you find a uniform for Michelle?&#39; asked Mary, cutting Mike off. <br />
<br />
&#39;I sure did. I always have a few spares just in case&#39; She produced a green and white garment from the bag she had been carrying. &#39;However I don&#39;t have any white runners. Do you by any chance have any white sandshoes Michelle?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I can quickly go to the mall and buy a pair&#39; suggested Sharon<br />
<br />
&#39;She might need some white bobby socks as well while you are at it Mum&#39; added Mary.<br />
<br />
&#39;That&#39;s settled then. It&#39;s great to have you on board Michelle. Remember we are all meeting in at the tennis courts in 45 minutes. If you are already dressed then we can get straight into practice&#39; With that Mrs Maloney hurried off.<br />
<br />
&#39;Mum how could you? Uttered Mike as soon as the door was closed.<br />
<br />
Sharon just ignored her. &#39;Well I guess I had better hurry off and buy those shoes. It&#39;s alright girls I know your size. While I&#39;m gone you two get ready. If I&#39;m longer than 45 minutes I&#39;ll meet you at the tennis courts&#39; she picked up her handbag and was also out the door.<br />
<br />
Mike then directed her anger at Mary. &#39;Why the hell didn&#39;t you stop this? You just want to make me make a fool of myself&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;It&#39;s the last thing I wanted. I only found out from Mum that she had volunteered you when we were walking back to the room. As if I would want you on the team&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Err. I am so mad!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Calm down. We only have 40 minutes now. I guess if I am stuck with you I had better help you get ready. Put the dress on and meet me in the bathroom. I&#39;ll get my own uniform on&#39;<br />
<br />
Mike had slept on the fold-out couch last night so took the uniform into Sharon&#39;s room. There she dressed in front of a full length mirror. She had to admit she was a pretty good looking girl. The green and white uniform was of a stretchy material that showed off her curves. She put it on over the bra her Mum had changed her with last night and the pair or white panties that she had worn yesterday, indeed she had been wearing since Mary and Sharon had first made her wear girl clothes yesterday afternoon.<br />
<br />
Now dressed she went to the bathroom where she found Mary fixing her own hair. She was tying it into a pony tail with a green ribbon. That achieved Mary brushed Mikes long brown locks then gave her an identical ponytail. <br />
<br />
She then told Mike to &#39;Stay still&#39; and produced her make-up kit.<br />
<br />
&#39;No way! I&#39;m not wearing make-up!&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Don&#39;t be silly. Of course you are. It&#39;s part of the uniform. Now stay still. We don&#39;t have much time and I still have to do my own&#39;<br />
<br />
So Mike had to stay as still as she could, as Mary applied various potions to her face. She even applied bright red lipstick. &#39;What do you think of the taste? I really like it&#39; said Mary. &#39;I&#39;d normally do mascara as well but we don&#39;t have time. I guess I have long lashes anyway and we can get away without it. Besides we should get a chance to touch up before the competition starts&#39;<br />
<br />
To be honest this was the first time Mike had tasted lipstick. He had never kissed a girl. He had fantasized about kissing a girl and tasting her lips. This wasn&#39;t the way it was meant to happen.<br />
<br />
Mary finished her own make-up then told Mike. &#39;You use the toilet first. Then it will be time to leave. We will have to meet Mum down on the tennis courts. Better just wear my white sandals&#39; She meant the sandals Mary had worn yesterday.<br />
<br />
So for the third time Mike sat down to pee. On her first attempt when they had first arrived at the hotel she had experienced a lot of difficulty even though she was busting, however by now she had figured out which muscles to relax. It was no longer such a big deal.<br />
<br />
Sharon still hadn&#39;t arrived back. Mike wore Mary&#39;s sandals down to the tennis courts.</p>
