<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up feeling different not a human but a wolf all you can remember is your life as a wolf cub like its been... Always been you look at yourself your a grey wolf with white on the tip of your tail and ears and a black ring around your left eye and yellow eyes. you realize your in your den. You walk around on all fours it feels different but you&#39;ve been walking like that since you were born. The den was small but it felt like home you looked around there was not Much to see you could see roots hanging from the ceiling and moss and leaves where you and your mother slept there were a pile of bones where there was food and a small pond near the exit there were strange carvings near the rocky part of the den but they were there when he was born so he assumed they were there a long time the carving looked like his mother drew it with her claw it showed a strange house and a strange human with a wolf mask on and mother was in front of the human he didn&#39;t know what it meant but it looked important so he shrugged it of and he realized how hungry he was so he trotted over to the dens entrance and he heard his mother coming he yipped he was so hungry and thirsty his mother walked thru the entrance she looked at him smiling hungry I suppose my dear she said (you can&#39;t talk yet your still a cub) you yip really exited she lays down immediately you race across the room suckling on her milk after some time of feeding you lay down she lays down beside you and you slowly close your sleepy eyes she says goodnight then she draws you in closer into her warm fur then you slowly fall asleep. You wake up to the same smells of your den and your mother you open your eyes and sniff the air it seemed to be morning you trot over to the pond with a full belly and you lap up some water you then turn around to see your mother up she opens up her eyes and looks at you and let&#39;s out a big yawn you race over to her yipping really exited you hug her and she hugs you back alright little one I think it might be time you tilt your head at her confused. She smiles it&#39;s time for you to see the world outside your den your eyes go wide you feel your heart racing finally you get to see outside the den finally you get to run thru the trees and splash in the lakes and rivers and go hunting and howling at the moon. She smiles as you run to the exit to the den immediately you stare at your mother wide eyed you feel so exited you can&#39;t even feel how tired you are from running around so much then all of a sudden you fall asleep. You wake up to find your mother who held you close then you are hungry so you wake your mother up and start suckling on her nipples it taste so good. Meanwhile your friend Ty finally gets over his sickness and drives to the house (your mother is going back to the house to look for more stuff and food) Ty walks in to find the place like trash well this is disappointing he call out to you he gets no answer Ty walks around to find the window completely smashed and your clothes all over the floor and a strange werewolf mask and fur! All over the ground  Ty walks over to the mask and picks it up he stares at it finally Ty tries it on he says why not he will soon regret it but he does it anyways he then realizes how dark it is getting so he try&#39;s taking of the wolf mask but finds it stuck and he feels his hand on the mask Ty starts to panick like crazy banging his head on desks table trying to rip it off but nothing works he sits down and then a werewolf jumps threw the window frozen with fear Ty stares deep into the beasts eyes the werewolf walks up to him he stares at it feeling strange like he was drawn to something her nipples... They looked oh what was he thinking he tried to run but he couldn&#39;t he was drawn closer closer closer until he stood face to face with it the beast lays down he can&#39;t resist those nipples he try&#39;s to stop himself but he can&#39;t he bends over her and sucks... It tastes so go- Ty was cut off when he couldn&#39;t talk anymore all that came out of his muzzle were yips growls barks and howls muzzle! He realized as his body started to shrink he grew fur all over his body he let out a loud howl as pads started forming at the bottem of his paws his legs became digigrade his ears became pointed and grew to the top of his head then Ty felt a pushing above his but and he howled uncontrollably at the moon as his tail pushed out he grew claws and sharper teeth his senses heighten he forgets his entire life as he is forced down on all fours then suddenly all his memeris are gone and replaced by new ones... As a wolf cub Ty feels hungry he starts sucking more and more until he is full then finally he forgot his name he fell asleep only to be dragged out of his clothes picked up out of the house and to the forest... Meanwhile Your ( not Ty)girl friend alea is deciding whether or not she should go visit you and Ty.</p>
