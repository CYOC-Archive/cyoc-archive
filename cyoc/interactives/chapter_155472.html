<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">How can I get so busy with my transition, I will only start making weekly entries in this journal I am writing. <br />
<br />
&#9642; Week 13<br />
<br />
Already on Monday Lara and Chris found out I was writing a diary about my transformation, Seeing that I had put parts about their transformations, they asked to include them in the diary with more detailed information.<br />
<br />
When it comes to Chris this week, the irises in her eyes have changed and they have become a wall of a feline.<br />
<br />
Lara already had her legs covered with her new fur, and her feet began to change. Other things we noticed this week was that she started producing a lot of milk for us to consume ourselves, so we suggested she sell what was left over. She agreed with the deal here as the milk was hers, and we agreed that she would get 80% of the profit.<br />
<br />
With me the main change was the fur, which from my knee to my feet began to grow by white instead of black like the rest of my body.<br />
<br />
&#9642; Week 14<br />
<br />
This week Chris&#39;s fur covered her face. Another big change was that this week, when we went to have sex, she took a condom packet.She told me that her testicles were already fully developed and had descended into her sac and that she didn&#39;t want to risk an unwanted pregnancy.<br />
<br />
As far as Lara is concerned, the main difference this week was that her horns began to become very apparent.<br />
<br />
As for me, my hands are now. the only part of my body not covered in fur. Before I forget my feet are finally fully hoofed, Thanks to this I stopped wearing any shoes from this week. <br />
<br />
This week also had a visit from Jack at my house. Seeing him with a full body of fur and only a wolf-shaped head, He really did look like a werewolf instead of someone changing.<br />
<br />
&#9642;Week 15<br />
<br />
This week Chris and Lara decided to stop wearing clothes, and all three of us started to walk around naked.<br />
<br />
Both Lara&#39;s udders and breasts got bigger this week, And her milk production reached the level that we were bottled in the five bottles every day. Her breasts went from B-cup to C-cup. This time we are smarter without you asking hoping to ask the doctor why this happened, we searched the internet. We found the information that those who turned into cow did not lose their breasts before completing the anthro stage of the transformation.<br />
<br />
Cris was jealous of Lara. Because her breasts were shrinking (Which is normal since she is becoming a male), they were also C-cup today, but they used to be D-cup. Her head is already totally from my panther too, except for her red hair that was still there.<br />
<br />
About me. My growth this week has accelerated. Saturday, I was eight and a half feet tall. It was also that day that I woke up with a hell of a fright when my bed broke, because it couldn&#39;t stand my weight anymore. That I confirmed later, and saw that I was weighing 260 kg.<br />
<br />
During our meeting of people in transition, Jack broke the news for us. He said he had become quite capable of having an erection, and that after the medical examination it was confirmed that he was beginning to go through the sex change and was going to be a female. He also said his girlfriend broke up after hearing the news, she did it simply by saying that she was not a lesbian to be in a relationship with a female.<br />
<br />
&#9642;Week 16<br />
<br />
This week my blond hair started to fall out and my face started to look more equine.<br />
<br />
One night Chris, after fucking me and Lara, said he was getting used to certain things considered masculine, using as example that she can now pee standing. And we both joke that later she&#39;ll have to pee on all fours. She had acquired padding in her hands as her hair moved up her arm and began to cover what was left of her breasts. Then she said she&#39;s basically already a male, since her breasts were all she had yet to remember she was once a girl, and that she wanted them to start treating her as such. In the end she said that as a man we should call her by her new name, now him, Bruce.<br />
<br />
Friday was the last day of class before winter break and to this day our classmates made a strange request. They asked us not to milk Lara before class. When we arrived in the classroom, we found a surprise party, organized with the permission of the university. They said they learned that after the holidays we would lock our enrollments as we would have to learn to control our new bodies and instincts, and this was a good luck party for us.<br />
<br />
We noticed that there was no drink at the party, and Mr Roberts joined in saying that everyone heard that Lara&#39;s milk was very good and wanted to try it, so they asked her not to be milked before.</p>
