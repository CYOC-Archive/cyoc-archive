<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even though they were mainly there to watch after their own children, that didn&#39;t mean that the chaperones didn&#39;t enjoy their stay at Mieni Atoll. Right now, the four of them were enjoying a few drinks at the juice bar.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to say, this place makes a great resort,&quot; said Jessica&#39;s father, Paul.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish I could have brought the rest of the family,&quot; said Roland&#39;s father, Winston.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same here, but someone had to watch the farm back home,&quot; said Abby&#39;s mother, Josephine, the only Animalian among them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure Martin came come eventually,&quot; said Sophie&#39;s mother, Francine, &quot;You&#39;ll probably get to come here more often than the rest of us, considering the discounts they give you for being on the council.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that big a discount,&quot; said Josephine dismissively.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a bit odd that the Wesley sisters and their mates didn&#39;t bring any of their parents,&quot; said Paul.<br />
<br />
&quot;Julia&#39;s in too delicate a state for travel,&quot; said Josephine, &quot;Those pups are coming not far from now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know I couldn&#39;t handle having to give birth to twins in 6 months,&quot; said Francine.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what about their boyfriends?&quot; asked Paul.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently Travis&#39;s parents didn&#39;t want to intrude on his vacation and Sandra...well, she&#39;s a bit preoccupied with her boyfriend,&quot; said Josephine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hard to believe that she used to be a worrywart only a few months ago,&quot; said Winston.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s got nothing to worry about now and plenty of youth to enjoy,&quot; said Francine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bet you feel the same way,&quot; said Paul to Josephine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...of course. It takes a bit of getting used to though,&quot; said Josephine. She finished her juice before deciding to go for a walk. She left the others and strolled down the beach. Eventually, she came to the spa that they were setting up here and Josephine said to herself, &quot;I could use a massage.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before Josephine had stripped down and was lying face down on a bed. She gave little groans of content as the masseuse kneaded the muscles on her back. She had no idea how stiff they were before. She could really fell herself loosen up.<br />
<br />
Then she heard another voice ask, &quot;How long until you&#39;re available?&quot; Josephine looked up to see Eliza standing at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be with after I&#39;ve done with her,&quot; said the masseuse, &quot;Excuse me, ladies. I need to get some more oil.&quot; With that, the masseuse walked out.<br />
<br />
Eliza looked at Josephine and asked, &quot;You&#39;re Abigail&#39;s mother, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, yes,&quot; said Josephine, trying to cover herself up a bit. She was getting used to relaxed Animalian modesty and Eliza&#39;s orientation wasn&#39;t making her feel more comfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about me,&quot; said Eliza, &quot;Beth is all the girl I need. You do look great though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, thanks,&quot; said Josephine, &quot;So, uh, how has your new youth been treating you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ve already gotten used to being a cat,&quot; said Eliza, &quot;The strange part is that being young is the hardest thing to adjust to. It&#39;s been decades since I was this young and things were so different back then. Catching up with the times is a bit of a bother, but at least Beth is helping me get used to this modern era. I suppose you&#39;re having an easier time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I admit I wish I were a bit older,&quot; said Josephine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, surely it can&#39;t be that hard to adjust to this year&#39;s idea of youth,&quot; said Eliza.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not for my sake, it&#39;s for Abby&#39;s,&quot; said Josephine.<br />
<br />
Eliza looked surprised at that and asked, &quot;Is your daughter uncomfortable around you and your husband now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she&#39;s gotten over that,&quot; said Josephine, &quot;But our youthening might get in the way of her future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; asked Eliza.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we always intended to pass the farm to Abby when she was old enough and we were ready to retire. Even after the outbreak, that didn&#39;t change. Sure, she might be getting the farm earlier and Samson would also be running it with her, but that seemed like a good thing. But when me and Martin converted, it made me start to wonder what will become of Abby. Martin and I are practically the same age as her and we won&#39;t be likely to retire for a long time. And, well, while we&#39;re refraining from having any more children, I can&#39;t guarantee that eventually me and Martin will be having foals. I&#39;m sure that will feel awkward for Abby especially if she&#39;ll be having foals of her own before long. So what are we going to do about her inheritance and her children&#39;s inheritance. Were we wrong to take a second dose?&quot; Josephine was surprised with herself by revealing all of her worries to Eliza. She just seemed so naturally empathic, or perhaps it was because she had a cat&#39;s way of making her feel more comfortable and open.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you have to worry about your daughter,&quot; said Eliza, &quot;Abigail&#39;s an intelligent young woman, even if she isn&#39;t truly one in terms of years. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she&#39;s started thinking of her own plans by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could you know?&quot; asked Josephine.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was the same with Beth,&quot; said Eliza, &quot;When I asked her what she intended to do after high school, she didn&#39;t seem to be certain. She considered becoming a professional boxer or maybe a bouncer. I told her that she could put her talents to better use than that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess, you suggested she should be a police officer,&quot; said Josephine.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, it&#39;s pigeonholing, but Dobermans are trained as police dogs for a reason,&quot; said Eliza, &quot;She didn&#39;t seem to care too much about upholding law and order. But I think she could do some good with some training. I think she could make a good security guard if she wanted to.&quot; Josephine gave her another look. &quot;Ok, ok, I&#39;m thinking too much inside the box. But a guard seems like a safer job than a bounty hunter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bounty hunter,&quot; said Josephine flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another one of her ideas,&quot; said Eliza, &quot;Well, I&#39;m sure eventually we&#39;ll figure out something. Until then, I&#39;ve got enough funds to keep us supported.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Out of curiosity, do you still get Social Security benefits?&quot; asked Josephine.<br />
<br />
Eliza made a snorting sound and said, &quot;They&#39;re trying their hardest not to pay. They keep arguing that I&#39;m actually under the benefit age and I should be the one paying them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The system was designed for people who can&#39;t get younger,&quot; said Josephine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, the Fountain of Youth is a bureaucrat&#39;s nightmare,&quot; said Eliza dryly.<br />
<br />
The masseuse came back with the oils and said, &quot;Sorry about the wait. I think someone&#39;s been moving the boxes around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This early in April, there is always someone looking for the slightest opportunity to pull a joke,&quot; said Eliza, &quot;I&#39;ll just wait here until she&#39;s done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; said Josephine, relaxing as the masseuse started rubbing oil onto her back. Eliza did seem to have a strong point. Maybe Abby was already plotting herself a new path. She really ought to talk to her about that soon.</p>
