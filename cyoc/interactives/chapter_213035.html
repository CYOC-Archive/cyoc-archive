<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy headed down stairs in his tank top and sweatpants, grabbing some leftovers in the kitchen. Finishing, Andy noticed the door to the basement slightly ajar. Andy knew that Jesse had set up a gym in the basement about a year ago. So with his sudden growth, Andy could not help but want to be able to maintain them.<br />
	<br />
The first thing that Andy did after walking down the stairs was look around at everything that Jesse had set up. From a bench for benchpresses to dumbbells and even a set of full body mirrors, Jesse had a pretty good setup for a decent workout. Not really knowing what he was doing, Andy had at least watched enough videos on the internet to use the dumbbells without hurting himself.<br />
	<br />
It was about an hour later when Andy heard Jesse come stomping down the stairs to the basement. Just as he was finishing a last set, Andy heard, “What the fuck are you doing with my stuff asshole?”<br />
	<br />
Even as Andy turned to face his bother, the air seemed to stand still, yet again, and Andy gained another inch in height, putting him at 6’1, and his cock grew to a whopping 11 inches. Along the with the added height and length, Andy also gained an inch in the width of his shoulders, and unbeknownst to Jesse, Andy’s balls grew larger, hanging lower.<br />
	<br />
Staying calm, “I was just getting a feel for this new body you gave me.”<br />
	<br />
Andy’s growth had taken the wind out of Jesse’s sails, so he could only reply, “I’ve told you not to touch my stuff. Now get out.” Jesse was surprised by how calm Andy was acting. When Andy simply rolled his eyes and headed upstairs, Jesse started to grow concern. <br />
	<br />
Jesse quickly forgot his worry, when Andy yelled from the top of the stairs, “I’m going to take some more of your clothes since none of mine fit me.” Before Jesse could respond, Andy had slammed the basement door shut and was heading up to the second floor.<br />
———<br />
Andy could not believe how stupid his brother was acting. He had quickly gathered some of Jesse’s clothes so he would have something to wear, before Jesse could make another scene. Going to his room, Andy stripped off the sweaty garments he was wearing and went to the bathroom to take a shower. This was the first time that Andy had really had a chance to look at himself in the last few hours. With his new growth and a nice pump, Andy stood in front of the mirror and really gave himself a full once over.<br />
	<br />
Andy could not help but smile as he looked at his reflection. His increased height and wider shoulders, helped Andy enjoy his new physique the most. Could not not help but think that he looked two or three years older then his actual fourteen years. He liked that he already had six abs on display, and while they did not stick out, Andy’s pectoral muscles would become very pronounced. <br />
	<br />
Of course, the crowning glory of his body was hanging between his two long and muscular leg, his cock and balls. Now a whopping eleven inches, Andy knew that a lot of fully grown men did not have his length. Andy did wonder what the affect of his enlarged balls would have on his larger body.<br />
	<br />
Jerking off a few load and then taking a shower, where he released five more times, Andy finished up in the bathroom and got ready for bed. He realized that he could not wear his pajamas to bed, now far too small. Instead, Andy put on some athletic shorts and got under the covers not even thinking about the fact that he was shirtless.<br />
	<br />
This first thing that Andy noticed as he woke the next morning, was the fact that he felt very itchy, especially his face. Scratching his face did not feel normal. Instead of smooth skin, Andy felt something ruff. Opening his eyes wide, Andy threw back the covers, jumped out of bed and rushed to the bathroom. What he saw in the mirror made him freeze in shock.<br />
	<br />
After the bullying by Jesse, Andy knew that he could probably pass as being the same age as his brother. However as he looked in the mirror, Andy was sure that he could probably now pass as being even older. Where before had been smooth skin the night before, dark stubble now covered Andy’s face. But Andy’s face was not the only place that now hd a hair. His arms and legs were much darker from the arm that grew on them and his hands and feet. Also, Andy might have had some pubic air before, now he had a bush that spread up to his navel. On top of everything else, some hair was also spread across both of his pecs.<br />
	<br />
With the sudden appearance of his body and facial hair, far more then Jesse had, the only thing that kept running through Andy’s mind was he didn’t know how the shave.</p>
