<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steven wanted to give him higher number cards out of the four of them, he knew that his dad would make the best choices for them.  His brothers seemed to have gotten a bit accustomed to this game&#39;s changes.  He glanced at them. They were too young too naive.  Tony had been a know nothing professional student with no thoughts other than partying and extending his time in college. His youngest brother Jeff had been spoiled to the brink of uselessness always getting whatever he wanted because he missed his mommy.  <br />
<br />
Steven had missed his mom too. But he used that loss, that suffering, that pain to push himself.  To finish school.  To succeed.  To be an example.  He wanted wealth and success and he wanted to put the past behind him.  His dad had always given him good advice and supported his dreams and up until this fucking game he had done a good job.  <br />
<br />
Steven wanted his dad or himself to win. So he had to play smart.  His eyes darted back from the expectant faces waiting for him to make a choice. <br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t want Doggy Daddy whatever that meant.  It seemed to him that it would make it harder for his dad to win. He didn&#39;t want sick and twisted even if his dad twisting his nipples almost completely off had made his whole world seem to come alive.  <br />
 <br />
He needed his dad or himself to win so that the correct wish could be made to set this all right. <br />
<br />
&quot;I pick....&quot; his voice sort of leaving him as he tried to pick the best option. To make the best move. To win like he&#39;d won in all the other areas in his life. &quot;Commanding Presence and Hungry.&quot; <br />
<br />
He said it as a pronouncement as he passed the cards to his dad. The other options fading away.  <br />
<br />
His dad looked at him and breathed out.  He had been worried that he would start to change.  But he didn&#39;t feel a shift. He didn&#39;t sense anything different.  He said, &quot;Good job Steven.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steven felt himself fill with pride and his cock spring to attention.  His dad said he had done good.   How wonderful.  Then Steven realized that his dad hadn&#39;t changed but the effect of his words had.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Be careful dad!&quot; He said but his dad had started to stand.  <br />
<br />
Dan felt within himself a need.  He needed something.  He felt empty.  Emptier than when his wife had died. Emptier when he had sat alone in the house while Jeff was off with friends empty.  The Dan shifted him the chair and he felt the shorts move against his rear and he knew.  <br />
<br />
He looked over to where Jeff and Tony were sitting. Still naked. Still half hard and he knew.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Tony and Jeff, I want you to fuck me,&quot;  He said.  The words slipping out of him without him even hesitating.  He was hungry.   He needed to be filled.  <br />
<br />
The boys hesitated looking at him.  Their cocks starting to liven up again.  They wanted to do what their father wanted them to do but he was talking crazy.  <br />
<br />
Their dad didn&#39;t hesitate.  &quot;I told you to come over here and fuck me.&quot;<br />
<br />
This time they sprung into action. Ready to follow their father&#39;s command.   <br />
<br />
Steven looked on horrified.  As his father pulled down his shorts and got on all fours next to the table.  Tony and Jeff were tripping over theirselves to get to his ass.  Tony was closest and got their first.  <br />
<br />
He pushed in and Dan squealed. He didn&#39;t offer any resistance.  He just wanted to be filled.  Jeff trying to still follow his father&#39;s demands came around to the front and brought his cock at eye level to his dad.  Dan lurched forward gobbling up the large tool in front of him.  <br />
<br />
Both boys pistoned in and out of him. Doing their best to comply with his wishes.  Dan was there on the floor getting spit roasted by two nineteen year olds. Getting rammed on all sides.  <br />
<br />
Steven watched in horror.  His dad had changed into this.  He tried to stop it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Cut it out you idiots. Get away from him.&quot;  Steven got up and tried to pull them away but he wasn&#39;t able to stop the rut that the boys had been driven to by their father&#39;s command. <br />
<br />
He went back to the game board and rolled the dice.  Hoping that it would change something.  He pulled his two cards and they said pass them to the next players.   He could only sit there and wait. He averted his eyes. He heard the twins pick up the pace and he heard a wet splashing and saw that his father&#39;s cock was spewing a river of cum.  <br />
<br />
The boys began to shoot. Both crying out at the same time they pulled out from their father, their cocks not dripping a single drop.  His father looked up satiated.  <br />
<br />
The twins stood there panting.   Their dad slumped into the puddle of his own jism sighing contentedly like he&#39;d just stood up after a four course meal.  <br />
<br />
Steven looked back down at the board.  He&#39;d rolled double sixes and the board read &quot;Double or Nothing.&quot;</p>
