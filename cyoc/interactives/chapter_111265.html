<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie could feel her body growing again as she could feel another growth spurt happening, shooting up another couple of inches. Her body then continued to mature further as her cones upgraded to size A cups, small but round. She could feel her hips expanding as her waist gotten a little curvier then normal. Tracing her finger to her hourglass, she was amazed at how shapely she’s becoming. She then spotted her fingernails and noticed that they were extending while her hands grew big and dainty. She could even see the nail polish on her nails as the pink began to sparkle. She looked at the polish as the sparkle reflected on the shine, feeling amazed by it all. She then started to stretch as her muscles beginning to strain, as she could feel the tone of her muscles improving after years of working out. She checked her face again and could see its journey through adulthood. Face looking so much oval like, nose getting longer and thinner a faint freckling on her nose, and eyes smaller and less childlike. She also noticed her lips puffing with cartilage and darkening to give her something to be kissed with. Her hair started to grow longer as it brushed past her shoulders and was getting brighter by the second. Katie watches it all as the 14-year-old stretched a little, enjoying her changes bit by bit.  She felt a minor migraine as she could feel her brain growing as well. Years of knowledge are filling her mind, as she was getting smarter by the second. In fact, common knowledge of kindergarten and grade school are easier for her as knowledge of high school entered her head. But that’s not the only thing that is entering her head. Ever since she was five, she always like going outside to play, rather it is hide and seek, ball, or playing tag. But now that she’s growing, her body is becoming predisposed and more athletic. Looking at herself, Katie could tell that her body was a little toned then before as she was gaining both energy and metabolism from the ‘years’ of sports. Her mind was also being filled with memories of the many years she participated in sports including T-ball, soccer, and gymnastics. Katie looked on in disbelief as her body was developing faster then before.<br />
<br />
She now felt her body growing more pronounced as she raced through the teen years. Her growth spurt got to a couple of more inches and she could feel like she was rising on the elevator. Her chest started to feel heavy as she looks down to see the mounds growing bigger and looking like AAs. Hips widening and curving as she had the hourglass of a young teen. Katie crossed her legs as she could feel them growing longer and shapelier, letting her free foot dangling as she moved her dainty foot to the beat.  Her legs took the same direction as well and grew longer with muscles swelling to young surf girl status. She looked to her hand to see it changing shape with fingers getting thinner and longer and her nails extending further. Katie decided to look at the dashboard mirror and see if the face has changed much. So far, she could see it maturing more, as her cheeks look less puffy, her nose thinning to a sleeker shape, lips puffy a little bit, and her eyes and ears growing smaller. Starring at herself, she was starting to look like such a beauty.  Just as she was looking at herself, she could feel a little discomfort in her mouth. Opening her mouth, she noticed braces appearing on her teeth. Katie was surprised by that and wondered how that got there. That’s when she remembered her memories altering. She remembered that she needed braces to help straighten her teeth. That could explain why she had them in the first place. She then noticed the skin on his face as saw a little dot on the cheek. Was that a pimple? She heard of teen girls getting them, but she never thought it was possible for her. Guess it was a price to pay when growing up.<br />
<br />
“Looking at yourself, sis?” Katie looked to Kellie and could see her looking a little young a vibrant. The twenty-three year old peeked to her fifteen-year-old sister and smirked saying, “Still feeling worried about your looks?” Katie felt a little nervous and said, “Yeah… The braces hurt and I swear I could see a zit on my face. I feel embarrassed going to the beach looking like this.” Kellie gave off a bit of a laugh and let the poor girl know that it’s all right. “It’s cool girl, I understand. I was like that when I was your age. I too was a little embarrassed at the fact that I looked like the teenage version of the ugly duckling. But as years passed, my ugliness faded and I have become the ravishing gal that I’ve grown to be. Give it a few years and maybe you can become as perfect as me.” Katie smiled and knew that Kellie was right. With her memories altering, she remembered the Kellie was going through a gawky teen phase and in a matter of years, she looks completely hot. Perhaps in a few years, she can be just like her too. Or to be more precise in Katie’s view, a few minutes.<br />
<br />
“Urgh… This music is so boring.” Kellie said as the elevator music was aggravating her she was listing to since she started driving. She started to change the station and picked up a pop channel that had an up beat. “There… That’s much better.” She said in pure enjoyment, “I swear if I hear another antique song again I’m going to tear my ears off.” Katie looked to her sister and could tell that she was looking a little fresher. And who could blame her; she was now twenty-three and was going through her senior year in college. She was also behaving like a college girl too as she tapped her fingers to the music and twirling her hair with her free hand. She seems to be more relaxed then before and was enjoying her life as a young adult. Katie could tell that she looked happier then when she was once her mother. As she was looking at Kellie, she notices something else off. For one, the car looked a little different. Sure, she was driving a Honda Civic, a typical mom’s car, but it looked like it was shifting a bit, looking sleeker and more powerful. <br />
<br />
Katie could feel another tingle as she grew another couple of inches, reaching four. Her maturing body continued its crossover through adulthood as she could see her body shaping very finely. Her breasts expanded a little more, shaping into a pair of perky B cup breasts. Her hips and waistline curved up some more, as the hourglass shape was looking well defined. Her arms and legs stretched further and her muscles grew to athletic proportions. Her face matures even more as her freckles faded out of existence, replaced with multiple pimples spread throughout most of her face. Her hair was now at her upper back and was getting shiny and wavy. Katie looked to her sweet sixteen self and could tell that she was a little bit ugly. But she knows that it’s a matter of time before she has a beautiful face.<br />
<br />
Tingling again, Katie could feel herself growing into a teen of seventeen. She’s inching closer to the six-foot mark and was near the adult size. She took a deep breath as she her body matured into a young adult status. Breasts now grew to BB and his hips flared more and more, getting curvier by the second. With her arms and legs stretching, the muscle tone expanded and toned to the point of athletic status. She could feel her face maturing more and more as her cheekbones were looking a little high and there were fewer pimples dotting her face, leaving most of the skin really smooth. Other changes of her face took place with her eyes getting smaller, nose thinning and getting longer, and lips getting a bit puffy. Her hair lower down her upper back and was reaching midway through. She crossed her legs very womanly and could feel her body language changed. Once she was all preppy and happy as a young girl, now she was turning into a mature woman with the strength and ability of a terrific athlete.<br />
<br />
Katie then turned to see her mother/sister and could tell that she was looking radiant then ever. Going down a year, the now 22-year-old was feeling more energized then ever and felt like she was ready to take on the world. She even noticed the car their in shifting around as she could feel the seat getting more snuggled and the gauges and dashboard went from being old fashioned to almost digital. She could even feel the car going faster then normal as the engine shifting into something more powerful. &quot;Kate, Are you sure you&#39;re gonna wear that old thing?&quot; Kellie asked her sister. &quot;Yeah, what about it, Kellers?&quot; asked Katie as her older sister smugly answered in a rather coy tone. &quot;Well, it&#39;s starting to look a little too small for you, bubble-butt!&quot; The two laughed it up, as Katie was amazed of the mental regression her former mother is going through. Normally, she would’ve teased her because of her being a little sister, but now that she’s getting older and Kellie getting a little younger, they’re relationship is getting closer then ever. It was going to be a matter of time before the two become twins, and then their relationships will be bonded together.<br />
<br />
Sensing another tingling coming, she sat back and felt her body growing a little more until it went past the five-foot mark. The last of her body matured one last time, making her look like a young woman then a kid at ten. Her breasts stopped growing and were now a pair of bouncy C cups while the last of her hips expand and was extremely curvy. The muscle tone on her arms and legs remained the same, but her skin darkened a bit more then matched Kellie’s own skin. All the remaining pimples on her face disappeared as well, leaving it smooth and flawless. She could even feel her braces magically removed from her teeth as she opened her mouth partly to reveal her teeth looking all evened out and pearly white. Along the way, she could see no trace of her childish innocent anywhere. Instead it was a complete beauty with lips to kiss, sultry eyes, and an elegant nose. Her hair grew longer and was at the middle of her back and was shining a blonde hue. The eighteen-year-old looked to herself and was glad that she looked beautiful compared to the pimples and braces that she had on. Her brain kept on filling with high school knowledge as history, math, English, and social studies felt easier for her. But her athletic knowledge continues to dominate more of her brain as memories of her taking on karate, track, and volleyball now entered her mind. The teen watched on and was amazed by how her body has grown and developed. If it’s possible, she might be able to surpass her former mother’s body. The ring continued to glow as Katie left her teens and entered her twenties.<br />
<br />
Her growth and development continued until she stopped at twenty-one, the same year as her former mother. Once the changes are done Katie was stunned at the fact that in front of the mirror was he adult self. In fact, she looked like an exact replica of your young mother but with a few exceptions. Her breasts now grew to D-cups as additional muscles were added to her own physique. The top part of her two piece was now looking like a skintight bikini with a rip in the middle to show off her melon like cleavage. Her waist was wide and curvy as she traced her now dainty hands on the barely visible abs on her stomach. She could even see the bottom half stretched to the limit and now looked like a thin bikini with tight straps. Her arms and legs looked muscular, yet at the same time sexy as well to fit her beauty. Speaking of her beauty, her face was beyond beautiful. She had some high cheekbones, plushy and kissable lips, elegant eyes, and a long and thin nose to complete her looks. Her hair was long and full as it goes down to her lower back. Suddenly, Katie felt a little prick on her left shoulder and looked to see what it is. What she discovered is a heart tattoo with the words, ‘Kellie’ on the ribbon. Katie looked on and was amazed that it actually appeared on her. She then looked to her former mothers and saw the same tattoo on her right shoulder, only with the words, ‘Katie’ on the ribbon. She looked on and could tell that they now had tattoos with each other names, a strong bond between twins. She smiled at the mirror and thought to herself: “Mmm… Damn girl, you’ve certainly grown up to be a fine woman.” She looked around and noticed that the car is continuing to change to match their age. It was changing to a sleeker, more durable, and fast model as the engine was sounding that it had a whole lot more horsepower then ever. Almost like the car is changing into something teenagers like to drive.<br />
<br />
As her body finished growing, Katie’s mind finished as well. She now has knowledge and sports and any athletic activities that gave her the body to an Olympic athlete. Any sports for females filled her mind and she felt very competitive. So much so, that she thought that her former mother would hate her so much. But then, another thing occurred to her. For in Katie’s mind, memories between her and Kellie had been altered completely. Now she didn’t think that Kellie was her former mother or big sister, but now a twin sister.  She could even feel memories swarming into her brain, memories of the two being twins. Memories of them being born together, playing together, being in the same schools, the activities they’re both playing, until they would compete together to get money for themselves. Katie’s was amazed as once they were mother and daughter, are now identical twin sisters of twenty-one. The car finished changing as well as the top opened fully, the windows went downward, and the car finished shifting. Now the car went from being an old, raggedy Honda Civic to a sleek and cherry red Jaguar F-Type sports car with the wind blowing through their hair and two surfboards strapped to the back. It was one of the prizes they’ve won in a surfing competition and in Katie’s memory; it was the greatest prize of them all. Now they are focusing on a million dollar prize for a similar competition in a week, and they now have to train for that.<br />
<br />
 “You know,” she said with a little sultry sound to her voice, “We could go to the bar after training today. I mean we&#39;re both legally twenty-one, right Kate? I should treat myself with a little alcohol in my life.” Katie chuckled up and could tell that Kellie was entering the alcohol phase of her life. She then said in a coy voice, “Sure think Kel… Just don’t drink too much since we got school tomorrow who knows what your teacher might do to ya if she catches you slumping like this.” The older sister look to her younger one and said, “Oh come now Kate. Just going to have one bottle and that’s it. Now ain&#39;t the time for a total binge just yet! But I am in the mood for some serious hunk if you know what I mean.” Kate rolled her eyes around and told her not yet. “Practice now, Manhunt later. We need all the money we can get if we&#39;re gonna keep our heads above our loan debt.” With their new memories, they looked out for each other when they grown up together. But as they grew, the two took different paths of their lives. For Kellie, studying to be a lawyer, for Katie, a sports athlete. Still, they looked out for each other no matter the obstacles they faced. Thinking about that, Katie thought that being a twin seems easier then that of a little sister. It almost feels like a bond is now connected between the two as Katie felt like her as a mother or a big sister didn’t seem to work out. Katie looked to herself in the mirror and said to herself, “You know what? I think I could get use to the twin life.”</p>
