<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jared loved his new bike. It took no time at all to get to school, and the ride felt amazing. He grinned as the wind rushed against his face and hair, the smooth motion of the BMX under him making every pedal feel effortless. Best of all, the jealous looks from his friends when he pulled up in front of the school made the whole thing even better.<br />
<br />
“Damn, Jared, where’d you get that? That thing looks expensive!” one of his friends, James, said, his eyes practically glued to the sleek black frame.<br />
<br />
Jared smirked, casually kicking down the stand. “Let’s just say… I got lucky.”<br />
<br />
He could almost feel Jeff’s silent rage radiating from the bike beneath him, though there was no way his friends could ever know. That just made it all the more satisfying.<br />
<br />
But then, just as he was soaking in all the admiration, he spotted Sam across the courtyard, showing off his brand-new phone again—the same one he’d been bragging about all last week. A top-of-the-line smartphone, sleek, expensive, something Jared knew he’d never be able to afford.<br />
<br />
“Huh…” Jared murmured to himself, a smirk forming as an idea took root in his mind.<br />
<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
He rode around the corner to the bike shed, out of sight from the others, and parked the Jeff-BMX against the wall of said shed. Resting a hand on the handlebars—on his brother—he leaned in slightly and whispered, “Okay, Jeff, you’re gonna be my new fancy smartphone now. The one I’ve had for the last month. No one will even think it’s weird that I suddenly have an expensive phone then.”<br />
<br />
In an instant, the bike under his fingers was gone. No sound, no transition—just gone. And in its place, resting neatly in his palm, was a sleek, brand-new iPhone.<br />
<br />
Jared’s eyes widened slightly as he turned it over, admiring the glossy screen, the perfectly smooth edges. It felt real. More than that—it felt normal, as if he really had owned it for a month already, happy that worked being able to change what people thort as well with this power. He pressed the power button, and the screen lit up, showing a wallpaper of him and his friends, along with a list of text messages and app notifications, like he had a history on the phone.<br />
<br />
“Damn… this is cool.”<br />
<br />
For a brief moment, he wondered what it felt like for Jeff—to be trapped as a phone, motionless, unblinking, unable to move or speak. Was he even aware? Could he see? Could he think?<br />
<br />
Jared chuckled and shrugged. “Whatever.” He’d figure that out later.<br />
<br />
Sliding the phone into his pocket, he went about his day, checking messages, playing games, even casually using the camera—Jeff was useful for once. The thought made him smirk every time he took the phone out.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t until the end of the school day that he gave Jeff and his power over him another thought.<br />
<br />
Sam and James were standing by the lockers, chatting about their after-school plans.<br />
<br />
“Man, it sucks that you don’t have you swim suit with you, Jared,” James said. “You should come to the swim meet now.”<br />
<br />
Jared grinned. “Actually, I think I do have a spare speedo in the changing room.”<br />
<br />
His friends shrugged, not thinking much of it, and Jared made his way toward the locker room. Once inside, alone, he pulled Jeff-the-phone from his pocket, smirking at the smooth black surface.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Jeff,” he whispered, making sure no one else was around. “Turn into a nice, tight speedo for me.”<br />
<br />
There was no flash, no effect—just like before, one second he was holding a phone, and the next, dangling from his fingers, was a snug, elastic black speedo.<br />
<br />
Jared grinned as he felt the material stretch between his fingers. “Perfect.”<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, he stripped down and pulled it on, shivering slightly at how tight it was. He adjusted it slightly, feeling the snug fit against his skin.<br />
<br />
A thought crossed his mind—what did it feel like for Jeff?<br />
<br />
Was he conscious in there? Could he feel everything?<br />
<br />
Jared smirked at the idea and ran a hand over his hip, snapping the waistband against his skin just to see if there’d be a reaction.<br />
<br />
“Man, Jeff, you really love my ass now, don’t you, rubbing right up to it like you are doing?”<br />
<br />
He chuckled, stretching his arms above his head, rolling his shoulders. “Well, at least you’re actually useful for once now.”<br />
<br />
What he didn’t realize was that deep inside the fabric of the speedo, Jeff was screaming. Trapped, aware, helpless—forced to endure every movement, every stretch, every shift. Drowning in his own silence.<br />
<br />
And Jared?<br />
<br />
He was already heading toward the pool, wondering what else he could turn his big brother into next. Maybe he will turn him into that annoying five-year-old neighbor… so he can at lest &quot;talk&quot; to him then.<br />
<br />
Yeah but at home.<br />
<br />
............................<br />
<br />
the swim was great so much fun and jeff was so much better as his speedo Jared thort riding Jeff now back in his BMX form,<br />
<br />
The ride home was smooth, the wind cool against Jared’s damp skin as he pedaled hard on his Jeff-BMX. The swim had been great, but nothing compared to the real fun—his ever-growing collection of transformations.<br />
<br />
Once he pulled into the driveway, he hopped off, smirking down at the expensive-looking bike. &quot;Alright, Jeff, back to a phone.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a blink, the BMX vanished, replaced by the familiar weight of a sleek iPhone in Jared’s hand. He slid it into his pocket as he walked inside, casually kicking off his shoes. &quot;And now…&quot; He grinned. &quot;Let’s try something new.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holding the phone in both hands, he whispered, &quot;Jeff, become that brat from next door and love it when i cuddle you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The transformation was instant. One moment, Jared was holding a phone, and the next, standing in front of him was a perfect copy of their four-year-old neighbor. Scruffy brown hair, skinny as a twig, dirty-looking clothes—everything matched.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down at his small, grubby hands, then back up at Jared with sheer misery in his young, wide eyes. His voice came out high-pitched and whiny. “Ugh, Jared, this is horrible! Do you have any idea what this feels like to be turned into diffrent things, and that speedo i could feel you... dick it was like on my face uhhh, and why make me this twerp?”<br />
<br />
Jared just smirked, not really listening to him. “Yeah, yeah, sucks for you.”<br />
<br />
Jeff let out a tiny, frustrated squeak, but before he could complain any further, Jared suddenly grabbed him and pulled him into a cuddle.<br />
<br />
Jeff stiffened at first, clearly not expecting it. But after a few moments, his tiny body relaxed against Jared’s, sinking into the warmth. His scowl faded ever so slightly as they sat on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, cartoons playing on the TV.<br />
<br />
Jared didn’t say anything—he just held his little Jeff-clone close, watching the bright, silly characters on screen.<br />
<br />
Minutes passed. Then an hour. Then two.<br />
<br />
It was… nice.<br />
<br />
Jeff, despite himself, found a strange comfort in it. He hated this. Hated being stuck like this. But for the first time since this nightmare began, there was no humiliation, no helpless transformation into something inanimate. Just quiet warmth.<br />
<br />
But then—<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, this is boring now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff barely had time to react before Jared pulled back and smirked. &quot;Time for something better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff’s stomach twisted. &quot;W-wait, Jared, hold on—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn into the latest console!&quot;<br />
<br />
And just like that, the little boy in Jared’s arms was gone.<br />
<br />
Now, in his lap, sat a brand-new gaming console, complete with controllers and a game already installed.<br />
<br />
Jared let out an excited laugh. &quot;Oh, hell yeah!&quot;<br />
<br />
He set the Jeff-console on the entertainment center, grabbed a controller, and powered it on. The screen lit up with the latest, most hyped game of the year, fully installed and ready to play.<br />
<br />
Jeff—trapped, silent, aware—could only endure as Jared happily spent the rest of the night playing, completely lost in his new entertainment.<br />
<br />
His transformations were endless.<br />
<br />
And Jared?<br />
<br />
Jared was just getting started, when he herd someone coming into his house or arriving?</p>
