<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After breakfast, Nate trudged back upstairs. He couldn&#39;t believe it but he was still feeling tired and wanted to sleep some more. He knew he should try and fight through it otherwise he&#39;d be up all night, but he couldn&#39;t help it. He closed the bedroom door and shuffled over to the bed. He slid under the covers and pulled the blankets over him again. He soon dozed off again as he quickly fell into a deep sleep. Vivid dreams filled his mind of him running through the woods at night, the moonlight filtering through the tree tops. There was a bonfire in the distance and others around it. There were howls in the distance, beckoning him forth. <br />
<br />
Nate was startled awake by Eric bursting into his room. The door flew open as Eric walked in, loudly announcing his presence. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey brother! You sleeping again?&quot; he exclaimed as he walked over to the window. &quot;Mom said we should go check out the resort, maybe head down to the lake. Get some air.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nate let out a grumble about wanting to sleep and started to pull the blankets over his head to block out the world and especially his obnoxious little brother. Eric was having none of it though and pulled the blankets away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t. If I have to go check out this crazy place then so do you!&quot; Eric started pulling at his brother to get up. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t wanna...I wanna sleep...&quot; Nate resisted, just wanting to give into his body&#39;s natural desire to sleep the day away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. But I think Mom and Dad are going to be staying here and having sexy times all over the cabin. Enjoy.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting up.&quot; Nate had zero desire to be around to witness or hear any of that as he darted around the room, pulling on a pair of jeans and slipping on his favorite pair of sneakers. As they walked out of the room, Nate grabbed the paperback novel he had been reading on the way up there and stuffed it in the back pocket of his jeans. He caught his reflection in the mirror again and paused, opening his mouth and examining his teeth. Were my canines always that pronounced, he wondered as he walked out of the room.<br />
<br />
* * * <br />
Nate settled down on a park bench overlooking the beach and shimmering lake of the resort they were staying at, happy to find one in the shade.  His brother had found an arcade and was currently playing video games galore. Nate could see him chatting with others and quickly making friends. It was surprising as Eric had never been this outgoing before. He opened his book and began reading, trying to get back into his book. But there was something else that kept drawing his attention and he didn&#39;t know why. It was a group of similarly aged teens sitting under a tree, talking and hanging out. One in particular kept his glance. A handsome young man with jet black hair and piercing eyes. Nate couldn&#39;t help but feel a deep attraction to this young man despite not even knowing his name. Their eyes locked for a second and then Nate quickly looked away. He went back to his book. That was safe, he thought to himself. He didn&#39;t want people to think he was a creep. He was surprised when he felt a tap on the shoulder and looked up. It was the same young man. He braced himself for the guy to sternly tell him to quit checking him out. Instead, he flashed Nate a warm smile and held out his hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I&#39;m Ben. You&#39;re new here, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Nate reached over and shook his hand, setting his book down beside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I am. We just got here yesterday.&quot; Nate still felt nervous. He long had an inkling he was gay but this was the first time found himself fancying someone who wasn&#39;t on T.V or something.   <br />
<br />
&quot;And how are you liking the resort?&quot; asked Ben.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s...different.&quot; Nate wasn&#39;t sure he wanted to elaborate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Different is a good word. Did you notice anything different about yourself or your family this morning?&quot; asked Ben. Nate was a little surprised at how forward this boy was being.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Nate was confused. Yeah, his family had been acting a little different. But that could&#39;ve just been the natural high of being on vacation.<br />
<br />
&quot;This resort changes people.&quot; Ben smiled as he said it. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s ridiculous.&quot; Nate started to look around, wondering how to get away from a person who sounded so deranged. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know it sounds crazy. But think about the way your family was yesterday as opposed to who they are today. Who you were yesterday as opposed to today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate&#39;s heart sank. There were changes happening to all of them that he couldn&#39;t explain. His folks looked younger and couldn&#39;t get enough of each other when last night they could barely stand each other. His brother was suddenly the most extroverted and charismatic person ever. What did I wish for though, he thought to himself. What did I want more that anything? It suddenly came to him. It was when they were first arriving in the car. Then again that night as he sat at the window, hearing the howls in the distance. He immediately regretted it. He didn&#39;t want it. Not really. Not like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay. It&#39;ll be okay...&quot; started Ben.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be...it can&#39;t be true.&quot; Nate was trying his best not to panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;This resort, the land it&#39;s built on is magical. It allows people to become what they most want to be.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;This is insane. Why are you telling me this?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could sense a kinship in you. We all could,&quot; he gestured to the other four teens. two guys and two girls. Nate waved because he didn&#39;t know what else to do. &quot;And if you&#39;ve become what I think you&#39;ve become...meet me in the woods tomorrow night. There will be a bonfire to light your way.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I, uh, look I need to go find my brother. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Nate got up and walked towards the arcade, freaking out over what Ben had just told him. <br />
<br />
* * *<br />
Nate and Eric returned to the cabin to find their parents gone with a note on the kitchen counter informing the boys that they were going to dinner and a show afterwards and would be home late. They also said there were some burger patties to grill for dinner for the both of them. Nate almost immediately picked up the scent of sweat and sex throughout the cabin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, we need to open some windows.&quot; Nate walked into the living room and started opening windows to let some fresh air in. &quot;Can&#39;t you smell that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Smell what?&quot; Eric seemed completely unfazed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nevermind.&quot; Nate went upstairs and into his room, closing the door behind him.  <br />
<br />
He walked over to the mirror and checked out his reflection. His stubble was even more pronounced now. He checked his teeth and his canines were a bit more pronounced as well. His heart began racing. His parents only got a bit younger. His brother just became more popular. But he...he was going to turn into something else completely. He had wished for it. He knew he had wished for it and it was happening now. Even his senses were improving. How was he going to ever explain this to his family? He leaned over the dresser, banging his fists on the wood. He couldn&#39;t help but freak out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please...I didn&#39;t mean it. I don&#39;t want to change. Please...I didn&#39;t mean it.&quot; he silently pleaded. He looked back in the mirror. Nothing was different. He let out a deep breath and went downstairs. <br />
<br />
* * * <br />
Nate was ravenous when it came time to start cooking dinner and cooked all six burger patties in the package. He didn&#39;t even care what his brother thought as they sat down to dinner and he chowed down on one burger after another, eating four of the six in total. <br />
<br />
Since Nate cooked, Eric volunteered to do the dishes. Nate told him he was going to go upstairs and read for the evening. Once he reached the sanctity of his bedroom, he closed and locked the bedroom door. He knew tonight was the first night of the full moon, which meant he had to take precautions. He began to pace the room nervously as he watched the sun begin to set. He&#39;d read enough books and seen enough movies to know what was next.  He sat down on his bed and looked out the window, the sounds of the forest drifting in, waiting for whatever came next.</p>
