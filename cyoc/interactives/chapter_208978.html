<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Fine,&quot; Finn said. He pulled out his phone and pulled up the app. Vance was quick to go over his shoulder and watch him. He watched as Finn changed a couple of settings so Vance would be able to tell the difference, but the world couldn&#39;t. &#39;Vance is a 6&#39;3&quot; perfectly built football player who has a scholarship to our school.&#39; Finn turned to Vance. &quot;Good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make me 6&#39;4&quot; and a starter,&quot; Vance said. Finn added the two additions. &quot;Good,&quot; Vance nodded. Finn rolled his eyes as he hit the enter button. The progress bar instantly filled. Vance took a second. &quot;Woah...&quot; he muttered as he stretched his arms to the sky. Already his body was starting to grow taller. Small pops came from his joints as the stretches became deeper. &quot;No way,&quot; a smile filled his face as he had to look a bit further down at Finn to properly see the small fox. &quot;It&#39;s really working!&quot; <br />
<br />
He looked down at his hands and watched as callouses from hard work started to form. No longer were they the soft baby hands that were only used to touching the computer. Instead, they were strong and firm. Each second growing a bit wider as all of his body was growing bigger. His attention quickly shifted to his biceps as they started to grow. What had been a fairly flat muscle, even when he flexed started to show both size and definition. With each flex, it bulged more. More power building into it. His excitement grew as the sleeves of his shirt started to recede back into his shirt, showing off the powerful muscle even more.<br />
<br />
However, Finn wasn&#39;t about to let him just have his own transformation. He quickly changed the settings to where Vance would no longer be aware of the changes and added some of his own. &#39;Vance is an anthro german shepherd who loves receiving attention from other men. If another man does something nice for him, depending on the size of the gesture determines how obedient he becomes to them.&#39; Finn felt himself smirk as he clicked enter again.<br />
<br />
The smile on Vance didn&#39;t falter as he continued to watch his body grow more and more like a football player. Thick pecs pushed tightly against his sleeveless shirt, but it hung fairly loose as his thin waist wasn&#39;t nearly large enough to push up against it. He continued to flex and enjoy the growing muscles on his body. Each one was looking more and more defined. But he didn&#39;t notice the long black and brown fur starting to coat his body. Nor did he notice the top of his ears turning into points. They quickly migrated to the top of his head and formed into large triangles.<br />
<br />
His tongue doubled in size and hung out of his mouth. Not that he cared as his face started to shift and mold into a german shepard&#39;s face. His nose turned black and teeth sharp as the shape of his face turned into a snout. &quot;This is amazing!&quot; he celebrated. A long black and brown tail emerged right above his perfectly sculpted ass, wagging uncontrollably. Without thinking, Vance lifted Finn with ease and started lathering his face with puppy kisses. &quot;You&#39;re the best friend ever. I&#39;d do anything for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Finn smiled as he pushed the overbearing dog&#39;s face away from his own. &quot;Put me down.&quot; Vance did as he was told. He stood there almost waiting for more instructions. His tall framed had only grown taller as his weight shifted to his toes instead of his whole foot. Two massive paws to hold his much larger body had formed and there weren&#39;t any shoes to speak of. Instead of khaki shorts, Vance was wearing comfortable athletic wear. His dark blue sleeveless shirt clung tightly to his chest and black shorts really showed off his ass. Finn nearly felt himself drooling as he stared at the athlete standing at attention just for him. &quot;How do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great! I can&#39;t believe how much energy I have. But I want to make you happy too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn felt a devious smirk appear on his face but fought the urges. &quot;Sit,&quot; he commanded. Instantly, Vance dropped onto all fours. The moment his brain started again; his tail wagged slightly. A smile was planted on his face. &quot;Good boy. Down,&quot; Finn pointed to the ground and Vance laid there. &quot;Roll over.&quot; Vance did as he was told right in the middle of the hallway. His shirt rolled up showing off his abs. Finn reached down and rubbed his belly. &quot;Who&#39;s a good boy? Who&#39;s a good boy?&quot; He continued to rub.<br />
<br />
Vance&#39;s left leg started to kick his left leg as a ticklish and joyous sensation run through him. He couldn&#39;t help but make a bunch of playful yips as Finn played with him. He was almost disappointed when the fox stopped. He looked up, a bit of concern on his face. &quot;Hmm?&quot; his head twisted, tall ears along with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; Finn said. &quot;You&#39;ve got practice. Make sure to burn off all that energy. Alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Vance stood up and started running for the locker room. Finn watched with a smile, wondering what he should do next.</p>
