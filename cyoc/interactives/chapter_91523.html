<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Very well then,” said Victoria.  She stood up from the table and backed away from it a few feet so that I could see her whole body.  Then she began to undress herself.  “Since you have already seen me naked, this will not be very shocking to you,” she said to me and then added, “At first.  You see, Joe, I am a lesbian.  But I am also a man-hater.  As soon as I realized I was a lesbian, I fell in with some of those groups that believe all men are evil.  Surely you noticed some pretty blatant hostility from me towards you, right?”<br />
 <br />
“Just a tad,” I said.<br />
 <br />
“It is because of those characteristics that my alter-ego was chosen for me,” she said as she removed her bra.  She was topless now and I could feel myself getting an erection.  Luckily the table blocked it from her sight.  “Our alter-egos reflect parts of ourselves that are our worst characteristics, or the things that we fear being the most.  Because of this, our alter-egos are our way of confronting those issues and trying to be better people when we are ourselves.”  She took off her panties and was now as naked as I’d made her on the street.  “Prepare to meet my alter-ego.”<br />
 <br />
Victoria seemed to enter a trance.  Her face totally blanked out.  Then her eyes seemed to roll back in her head while her body quivered and beads of sweat appeared on her forehead, her arms and her chest.  She groaned a few times as her body continued to tremble.  Then I noticed the changes beginning to take place.  Her long, thick black hair grew shorter.  It was quickly receding into her head.  In a matter of seconds her hairstyle changed from a typical female style to what looked to me like a male buzz cut.  It looked like something out of the military.<br />
 <br />
The changes did not stop.  Victoria’s entire body grew larger and taller.  I guess she was only about 5’6” or so but her body grew taller by another foot.  Soon I could see muscles appearing everywhere.  They were growing on her arms, her legs, her stomach and her chest.  These were no ordinary muscles, either.  These were the kind of muscles you would see on a bodybuilder.  The shape of her body was completely altered as she changed from a lithe, athletic woman into a huge, thickly muscled…<br />
 <br />
Man, I thought to myself.  She was clearly changing into a man.  Even though her body had never been curvy, it still had a definite feminine shape.  With the acquisition of these muscles, it didn’t have that shape any longer.  Her hips were no longer bigger than her waistline.  Now they appeared the same size.  I could also tell that her feet and hands had grown larger and the digits on them were thick and covered with the slightest bit of hair.<br />
 <br />
As the muscles on her chest kept growing thicker, her breasts underwent a gender defining change.  They deflated and pulled back into her body.  Her nipples decreased in size and now stood at the tips of her incredibly large pec muscles.  Just below her pecs she now sported a rock-hard six-pack abdomen.  <br />
 <br />
During this entire process she groaned a few more times.  With each new groan, her voice deepened considerably.  I saw a lump form on her throat.  Then the soft curves of her face expanded out into rugged lines.  Her cheekbones lowered as her mouth became larger but with thinner lips.  Her nose broadened and her eyes grew larger.  Signs of wear appeared on her forehead.   <br />
 <br />
Lastly there was a dramatic change in her groin.  Skin began to pour out of her pussy.  The skin quickly shaped itself into a cock.  This cock rapidly grew in size and girth as pubic hair thickened behind it.  I had to admit feeling jealous when the cock grew out to what had to be a full foot long, because it was bigger than mine.<br />
 <br />
Her eyes finally appeared in their normal position.  They had changed color from a soft blue to a steely cold black.  She looked down at her impressive, naked body and said in a very masculine voice, “Proper attire.”  Just then clothes began to appear on her.  Before I could blink, she had on a pair of military-looking, steel-toed boots.  She had camouflaged pants and short-sleeved shirt, which didn’t appear they could be any tighter as the outlines of her muscles were clearly evident.  In addition she now had on a pair of black gloves, a large watch of some kind, a pair of sunglasses and a black beret.  She also had dog tags around her neck.  She clicked her heels together and barked, “Commander Victory, reporting for duty.”  Then she opened her stance and clasped her hands behind her back.<br />
 <br />
I couldn’t say anything.  I was beyond astonished.  I looked at Allan.  “Is this really happening?” I asked.  He just nodded knowingly.  He also moved his head in a way that told me I should be paying attention to…Commander Victory.  “So where is Victoria?” I asked him.<br />
 <br />
“Victoria is resting comfortably within my mind,” he said as he tapped his temple with the index finger of his right hand.  “From now on, you will address me as Commander Victory, is that understood, young man?”<br />
 <br />
The “young man” remark lit my ire again.  But I didn’t think it was a great idea to pick a fight with this hulking mountain of a man.  “My apologies,” I said.  “So…who are you exactly?”<br />
 <br />
“As you have already been told, young man, I am Victoria’s P.H.A.N.T.O.M. alter-ego,” Commander Victory explained.  “Currently my role is to function as the leader of this elite, secretive group.  I am a master strategist, an expert in planning, and an expert in both hand-to-hand-combat and weaponry.  I am a superior soldier in every respect.”<br />
 <br />
“So you’re the leader?” I asked.<br />
 <br />
“Correct,” he replied.<br />
 <br />
I turned to Allan.  “Even though you were a member before her…I mean, him?” I said.<br />
 <br />
The Commander answered my question.  “Leadership in this organization is not determined by longevity,” he said.  “It is determined by personality and needs of the group at the time of recruitment.  The Doctor here is a vital member of P.H.A.N.T.O.M. but his skills are not best suited to leadership.  Mine, however, are.”<br />
 <br />
“It’s true,” sighed Allan.  “I never did inspire much.  For reasons that will become apparent to you over time.  But getting back to what you just witnessed.  What do you think?”<br />
 <br />
“I don’t know what to think,” I said.  “I mean, that was…incredible.  So the man-hating lesbian, as she put it, turns into the ultimate male specimen.”<br />
 <br />
“Indeed,” said Commander Victory.  “When Victoria accepted her place in P.H.A.N.T.O.M., this was the alter-ego for which she was selected.  It is a statement on all the characteristics that she loathes.  When I am present, she is aware of what I do and say and she has to deal with it.  Likewise, when she is present, I have to deal with her in the same way.”<br />
 <br />
“So you’re both sharing a mind?” I asked.<br />
 <br />
“And a body,” Commander Victory answered.  “Both the person and the alter-ego are constantly aware of each other but are powerless to control each other.  Each retains the other’s memories and experiences.”<br />
 <br />
“So when you change back into Victoria, she’ll remember everything we’ve talked about?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Correct,” he answered.  “Now since you have met me but not yet accepted membership, I must leave.”<br />
 <br />
The transformation process I witnessed moments ago happened completely in reverse.  Commander Victory went blank, his clothes disappeared and his body reformed into that of Victoria’s.  I couldn’t help but get aroused again, especially when her tits and pussy reformed.  She redressed herself as if she was racing someone else to be the first to finish.<br />
 <br />
“So you have now met the Commander,” she said, “and gained a little more understanding about the alter-egos.  Now we are at the point where you must decide.  Will you accept membership into P.H.A.N.T.O.M.?”</p>
