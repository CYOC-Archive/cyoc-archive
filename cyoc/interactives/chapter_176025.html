<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The process felt good. An invisible force pulling and pushing on his body. It was strange, but damn it felt good. Jay groaned<br />
<br />
“Are you alright?” Emma fretted from the couch<br />
<br />
“Relax Em. I’m enjoying this.” he reassured her.<br />
<br />
Jay was starting to feel it more. He staggered, almost losing his balance. Was his center of gravity changing or was the thrill making him woozy? Anyways, he ought to sit down. He stumbled back to the coach, sitting down next to Emma.<br />
<br />
“Are you totally completely sure you’re alright?” Emma asked again. She clutched his arm.<br />
<br />
“Yeah.” he grunted. “I’m fine, but you can help me.” He motioned towards his groin and his fully erect member.<br />
<br />
Emma hesitated for a short while, but then she was quick to act, earnestly doing her best. She brushed her hair behind her ear and bent down. Jay leaned back and enjoyed it. It was intense, the blowjob adding another facet to all the complex sensations sweeping through his body. He clenched his hand and curled his toes. He made noise, though it was less of a masculine grunt, and more of a husky moan. <br />
<br />
Emma  released the hold with her mouth. Jay was disappointed for a second, fearing she was about to stop, but she was just shifting her focus. She continued pumping with her hand instead, leaving the rest of her free. Free to move up along his torso. Tongue licking his stomach. A light and wet touch. Upwards. Slowly. She was teasing him. A little nibble. It sent shocks. More. He wanted her to go wild on him. Rougher. Emma used her one free hand to cup his boob, part fondle, part curiosity on her part. Jay was about to finish. He was close.<br />
<br />
He shuddered. His thoughts paused. Cum was shot into Emma’s hand. Absolutely amazing. Then it slowed down. Slowly he returned. Slowly he took in his current situation. He was hot and sweaty, wet strands of hair on his forehead. Had ten minutes passed? Was the transformation done? His body didn’t feel like it was changing. He looked to his side. Emma was smiling at him expectantly.<br />
<br />
First, he had to check the situation of his dick. He hoped it hadn’t reduced too much. Looking at it, it did appear a little smaller. He grabbed it. Somehow it felt much bigger in his hands than usual. He was confused for a second before he realized the obvious. His hands were smaller, of course his dick would be larger by comparison. He looked at his hand. A little dainty. He followed along his arm. He flexed his bicep. Reduced, but still something to be proud of.<br />
<br />
“How does it feel? Do you feel fine?” Emma asked, seeming both concerned and curious.<br />
<br />
“I’m fine. I’m fine.”<br />
<br />
He stood up from the couch and did a little stretch. It felt good. Emma stood up as well. He immediately noticed how tall she reached. He barely had to look down to meet her eyes. He was eye-level with her forehead. It was expected. Girls are shorter, but it was still weird to experience. Jay was used to towering over most people.<br />
<br />
Moving on, Jay had yet to get a proper look at how he now looked. A little excited, he turned to the room mirror. He did look like a girl. A very muscular and kind of boyish girl, but a girl nevertheless. Of course one would have to hide the thing between his legs to complete the illusion. <br />
<br />
He studied his physique, checking how his muscles survived. A little reduced, but still pretty big, especially for a girl. He couldn’t help but immediately pose and flex, both exploring and admiring his new look. He emphasized his chest as he posed, sticking his boobs forward. He They were a decent size now. He glanced towards Emma. Comparing the two of them he’d say he might be a little bigger. Emma didn’t have the largest boobs, but it still filled him with some sense of pride. He was only at 60%, and already he could probably outcompete several girls. Not just in the tit area, his entire body was damn sexy.<br />
<br />
Jay was about to walk to the mirror for a close-up. He wanted to check out his face, but he was interrupted by Emma grabbing his attention<br />
<br />
“Um. Jay.” she started. “I know that you always know what you’re doing and stuff, but could you change back? Just so I know it’s possible.”</p>
