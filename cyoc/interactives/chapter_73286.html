<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff fiddled with the settings on the remote. &quot;Let's see if this will work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Alisha's eyes went wide, and her mouth opened. &quot;What the fuck?&quot; she said. &quot;I-&quot; she stretched her neck around. &quot;I can't move my body.&quot; She grunted as she tried to get control of some part of her body below her neck, but her body remained an immobile living statue, one hand still stretched out to close the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give it up,&quot; Jeff said, her eyes darted to him, finally noticing him in the room. &quot;You're not moving until I want you to move.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You!&quot; she said, recognizing him. &quot;You little pipsqueak piece of shit. You did this?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get you for this, Jeffy,&quot; she threatened. &quot;Let me move now, and I won't totally destroy you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shook his head, still smiling.<br />
<br />
She grunted in fury, and tried to move again. Jeff just laughed at her helplessness.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; he said. &quot;How does it feel to be the helpless one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How does it feel to be under someone else's control?&quot; He waited a moment. No reply. &quot;Feels bad doesn't it? To be powerless. To be someone's plaything.&quot; She just stared  at him. &quot;Just think of all of the embarrassing things I could do to you now.&quot; He walked up to her body a reached for her right breast with his free hand. She promptly spit in his face.<br />
<br />
Surprised and grossed out, Jeff stumbled back away from her and wiped the spit off on his shirt. Once his face was dry, he felt at ease again. &quot;Nice one,&quot; he said. &quot;I guess breaking you won't be that easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here's an idea,&quot; she said. &quot;Why don't you go fuck yourself, you chicken shit little pussy? Is this how you get your jollies? Torturing girls for fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was unmoved. &quot;I'm not the torturer here. Remember? Or did you forget? Did you forget how you used to abuse the 10-year-old boy you were supposed to be taking care of? You say I'm torturing girls. Well, I learned torture from a master.&quot;<br />
<br />
That seemed to shut her up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; he continued. &quot;I had planned on simply humiliating you for a little while and then leaving you pretty much the same way that I found you. But, after the threats and the spitting, I think you deserve something more.&quot;<br />
<br />
He started programming her change into the remote.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff,&quot; she said, now sounding a bit concerned. The full weight of her situation was becoming clear to her. &quot;Jeff. Can't we work this out somehow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too late for that,&quot; he said without taking his eyes of his work. &quot;Just a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah ha,&quot; he said theatrically. &quot;Done. Ready to have the tables turned?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Too late.&quot; He activated the remote.<br />
<br />
She started to shrink. Even if she couldn't move, she could feel her body, and right then she felt herself getting smaller. Other more subtle changes were becoming noticeable as well. Her skin seemed to twist and contract on her face and all over her body. Her hair was getting shorter. He breasts were flattening out. Her hips and ass were narrowing. Then, she felt and odd inside out twist in her crotch. Her genitals seemed to be leaking out of her pussy. Wait, no. There was no pussy there anymore. &quot;Oh my god!&quot; she cried, her voice sounding a bit off... Younger? Rougher? She had never felt the thing between her legs before, but she knew what it was. &quot;Why the fuck do I have a dick?&quot;<br />
<br />
As if in reply to her question, the changes ceased. Looking around, she realized that the room seemed much bigger. She estimated that she was over a foot shorter, probably close to 4'6&quot; tall now. Her clothes hung off of her body loosely, and she could feel her pants and panties ready to slip off of her narrow hips. Her bra felt uselessly deflated on her flat chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect,&quot; said Jeff. &quot;You look just right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck are you talking about?&quot; she said, but the words felt strange and clumsy coming out of her new mouth. A little probing with her tongue showed her that a few teeth were either missing or only half grown in. Just like a... &quot;You didn't,&quot; she said as the realization hit her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But,&quot; she said. &quot;That's impossible. I can't be...&quot; She drifted off, unwilling to face what had been done to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't be what?&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed. &quot;...a little boy. A 10-year-old boy, right?&quot; But, he didn't have to answer. She could her it in her new voice, the voice of a boy, a fifth grader. &quot;You turned me into you, a boy like you were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll let you have a look at yourself if you promise to behave.&quot;<br />
<br />
She said nothing, but he hit a button anyway. And, finally her body was back under her own control. She stood up straight, and her pants and panties dropped to the floor. &quot;Shit,&quot; she said as she crouched to grab them. For the briefest of moments, she had felt the cold air on her new crotch and felt her new genitals shrink away from the cold. She pulled up her pants with both hands, and felt her dick uncomfortably pressed against her warm panties.<br />
<br />
Some instinct overrode her common sense, and she tried to escape. She took a step, and fell over, having tripped on her too large shoes and too long pants. &quot;Damn it,&quot; she said from the floor as she sat up on her knees, feeling like a total fool. She became aware of someone chuckling above her. She looked up to see Jeff thoroughly enjoying her discomfort. &quot;Fuck off, pervert,&quot; she said. &quot;What? You into little boys?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Jeff. &quot;But, I have a sense that you are. It was a little realization I came to while walking over here. Why else would you take so much time to strip me down and put a diaper on me when I was a boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; she said. She was shocked. Shocked that he'd said that, and shocked that it almost made sense. &quot;That's bullshit.&quot; She was becoming aware of how increasingly silly profanity sounded coming out of her young mouth, especially when she was falling into denial. &quot;You... you're full of shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Jeff said, not caring enough to argue. &quot;But, remember who started all of this. It wasn't me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing the smug look on his face, Alisha wanted to prove to him that he couldn't break her. She stood up, leaving her pants on the ground, and pulled off her top and her bra. She stood up straight before him, naked, defiant. A full-length mirror stood on the other side of the room. She carefully stepped out of her tangled clothes and marched to the mirror barefoot, ready to show Jeff how little she cared about what he'd done to her. But, when she saw her reflection, her shoulders dropped and she groaned.<br />
<br />
The boy reflected back to her looked like a total joke. For one thing, he was wearing makeup. His lips were painted bright red, and his eyes were rimmed with a faint hint of purple. That was alluring on a young woman. On a boy... not as much. His fingernails were long and painted red as well. With the makeup and his pierced ears, he might almost pass for a little girl if it weren't for his short hair and that thing between his legs, which now drew her full attention. God, was it small. Were all boys this small? For the first time in her life, she understood what &quot;penis envy&quot; truly meant.<br />
<br />
She saw Jeff behind her in the mirror now.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Al,&quot; he said. &quot;How does it feel to be a humiliated little boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
She balled her fist, turned, and punched him in the crotch. The remote dropped out of his hand. He doubled over, grasping his crotch and moaning. A kick caught him right in the nose, which started leaking blood immediately. He staggered back, dazed, holding his face and his crotch, hoping to avoid the next blow but feeling totally confused about where his attacker was. A little fist slammed into his gut surprisingly hard, right into his liver. He dropped to his knees and cowered in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;'How does it feel?' you say,&quot; she said. &quot;It feels just fine. Because no matter what you do to me, I'll always be able to beat you. Know why? Because your a loser, a wimp, and a coward. You're the one that's a terrified little boy still. I know who I am, and I like who I am.  You're just some spineless dork with a petty grudge. I mean, if you have all of this power, why come after some girl who humiliated you when you were a kid? Why not go out and rule the world, or build yourself a harem of playboy models, or make yourself president? Why not? I'll tell you why not. Because that would be scary. That would take balls, and all you've got are little boy balls. So, you sneak up on me and take me like some chicken shit rapist. You try to make me just like you were back then. But, I'll never be just like you. I'll never be a scared little boy. I have some real balls. So, fuck you and your god damned magic or whatever. Oh, and by the way, you shouldn't mess with a tae kwon do black belt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Near the end of her speech, Jeff became aware that he no longer had the remote. He saw it lying at her feet. His eyes betrayed him, though. She looked where he was looking and picked up the remote. &quot;And what is this?&quot; she said holding the remote in front of him. &quot;Is this your magic box? Your sci fi gun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alisha...&quot; he started.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is!&quot; she declared. &quot;It has my name on it.&quot; She started pressing buttons.<br />
<br />
Realizing that the remote had, as the cliche went, fallen into the wrong hands, Jeff summoned up his small courage and lunged to grab the remote from her hands...</p>
