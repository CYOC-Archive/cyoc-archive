<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave sat at Janet's desk, still in her body and apparently still more or less on auto-pilot.  He really had no idea how, exactly, it was happening.  His mind was just sending the message to the rest of his borrowed body for it to act on, leaving the majority of his mind free to wander...since he couldn't seem to make himself stop.<br />
<br />
Oh, he could still feel everything, alright.  Everything from the way that thin, lacy bra cradled his smallish (but very nice and shapely) B-cup bosom to the way those panty-hose crept up his smooth, sexy legs, leaving his groin and ass bare while wrapping around his tight little waist like stockings and garter-belt all build into a single garment.  Or the way that small pair of silky panties cradled his purloined feminine sex and pulled up a bit behind him to ride up between the soft cheeks of his fuller, more peach-shaped ass.<br />
<br />
Heck, he could even still take some actions on his own, like rubbing a small itch on the side of his nose or pausing to stretch from time to time...but he just couldn't bring himself to stop what he was doing to go back to his 'old' office to try and reclaim HIS magic pen!  He could only hope against all hope that whatever the 'new' Dave had done to make him behave like this had been accidental, and that he would be back in his own body, pen in hand, when the day was through.  But then...something very strange happened.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, as if a weight had been lifted from his slender, slightly curved shoulders, he was back in control of Janet's body again!  Well...kind of.  She still couldn't bring herself to disturb her boss &quot;Dave&quot;.  After all, if he needed her for anything, he'd call her.  But other than that, as far as she could tell, she was right back to being firmly in the driver's seat, as it were.  Which...posed yet another problem.<br />
<br />
While it was obvious that she was expected to perform the normal duties of a secretary...she had no idea what many of those actually consisted of.  In her limited experience having secretaries working under him, they answered the phone, kept the schedule, arranged meetings, forwarded calls, fetched and filed documents, brought drinks or snacks when desired, gave great head, didn't wear much and only if it could be called 'sexy', and were probably bisexual and horny as hell.  None of this in any way prepared her for the forms she had been filling out for most of the morning, and was now faced with taking care of without the aid of magically-enforced aid!<br />
<br />
It was lucky for her it was just for today, and nobody would ever be the wiser.  All she had to do was make it till the day was over...so who cares about that kind of stuff?  She could leave it all and let the real Janet deal with it tomorrow.<br />
<br />
So thinking, she adjusted the strap of her bra, standing and making her way over to the coffee pot to pour herself a cup of coffee, not even noticing the honey-blonde color of her hair.  If she had, she'd have been both shocked, and dismayed, as it was supposed to be a rather mundane brown color.  Well cared for, but nothing that really stood out.  It also would have informed her that a certain perverted version of her formerly-male self was well aware of what that pen was capable of!<br />
<br />
What she had no way of knowing was that every sip of coffee was making her bladder shrink slightly smaller, to ensure that if she didn't catch on quickly enough, she'd be making her first trip to the ladies room by the time this one cup was empty.  She was also blissfully oblivious to every passing moment she wasn't hard at work filing those reports for 'Dave', her breasts were swelling up just a little bit bigger.  It was unnoticeable, really, from inside or out of that body...yet every little bit adds up.<br />
<br />
She took another sip of coffee on her way back to her desk and sat down again, smoothing her short, tight black skirt and straightening the front of her cream-colored silk blouse, making sure it was still properly tucked in and every bit of cleavage she had to muster was on full display, then pressed the space bar on the keyboard of her computer to see what Janet had been up to on there before she had switched bodies with her and to try and find something to do while waiting for 'Dave' to tell her he needed something.<br />
<br />
Taking another sip of her coffee and then reaching up to idly adjust a bra-strap, the screen-saver turned itself off to reveal a perfectly uncluttered, wonderfully organized desktop with three programs still running, minimized at the bottom.  Huh...apparently Janet's office computer was still running Windows XP.  How...archaic!</p>
