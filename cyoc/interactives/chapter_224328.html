<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;See? That wasn&#39;t so bad, was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris shook his head, &quot;I guess not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be fine. Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Anne said, &quot;it&#39;s gonna be great.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris nodded. The pill was already beginning to kick in. His stomach was beginning to feel warm, the heat spreading out to the rest of his body. It wasn&#39;t painful, but rather, comforting. Like sinking into a hot tub after a long day. His arms and legs felt relaxed and light, and he leaned back onto the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa..&quot; Chris muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You feel it, huh? I do too. It&#39;s... pretty nice.&quot; Anne replied, smiling, &quot;I bet you&#39;re going to look so pretty. I&#39;m sure of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The warmth was growing, the sensation intensifying. It felt almost euphoric, and Chris had no desire to stop it. He wanted to see this through, to know what it would be like, if only for a moment.<br />
<br />
The sensation was slowly taking over. It wasn&#39;t just the physical changes. It was like someone had reached into his brain and was rearranging his thoughts. He found himself thinking differently, his mindset becoming more girly and submissive.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... feel weird...&quot; Chris mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, just relax,&quot; Anne said, moving in and giving Chris a kiss on the forehead.<br />
<br />
Chris nodded, closing his eyes and leaning his head back. He was still thinking about the sensation, and it was getting stronger and stronger, more and more powerful. He was starting to feel different, his body changing, his mind rearranging.<br />
<br />
The first change, the first physical change at least, was his hands. They became daintier and smaller. Chris&#39;s nails grew, becoming perfectly rounded and feminine. Smooth and glossy with perfect French manicures.<br />
<br />
He felt subtle shifts in his arms, like melting wax as his muscles softened and became more supple. His shoulders began to round out and shrink slightly, his bones and joints shifting into a shape that befit a woman&#39;s frame. The changes were gradual but undeniable.<br />
<br />
Breasts began growing, the tissue under his chest expanded and took shape. They were soft, almost fluffy. A perfect pair of princessly boobs, the nipples becoming light pink. His arms came up to touch them, and were surprised. It was odd, touching a body part you&#39;re not used to.<br />
<br />
Chris&#39;s hips pushing outward and creating a nice waist-to-hip ratio that most women would kill for. His waist shrank in conjunction, becoming a perfectly accentuating hourglass. He reached up with both hands and felt his neck, which had somehow grown more supple and was slightly longer than before. His Adam&#39;s apple receded, almost disappearing all together. His shoulders dropped an inch as his collarbones became more visible, giving him a softer silhouette. He could practically feel the femininity blossoming.<br />
<br />
Then, his face. It began to lose its definition, making it softer, rounder. His jawline became less noticeable, his cheekbones rising. His eyebrows became smaller and more dainty, his nose shrinking and sharpening ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
Chris felt a tingling sensation at his scalp, as hair started to rapidly sprout and cover the top of his head. His hands ran through newly grown strands, marveling at the softness, length, and fullness of his new flowing brunette tresses. The waterfall of brown curls was impressive, exploding out of his head and continuing further and further until it reached his waist.<br />
<br />
A burning sensation ignited around his groin area, almost too painful to bear yet also strangely pleasurable. His penis began to shrink until it was barely visible as an outline on his skin before disappearing completely.<br />
<br />
Looking down, the burning spread down to his legs and inner thighs as he could feel his muscles seemingly evaporate away. His knees and calves rearranging, becoming exclusively thinner than they once had been. His feet became slim and delicate, his ankles shrinking. His skin felt smoother, more silky.<br />
<br />
Finally, his manly mentality faded away and was replaced with a distinct sense of femininity. Not only did it manifest externally, but internally, too—the way he thought, felt, and viewed the world had taken on an entirely new shape. He was no longer a man; instead, he had assumed the identity of a woman, a princess. Gone was his former body, in its place was something utterly different.<br />
<br />
Her eyes opened as the pill&#39;s effects on his body finished. She let out a deep breath. She felt strange. It was as if her entire world view had shifted and nothing seemed to make sense. But, somehow, it seemed right.<br />
Looking across, she could see that her girlfriend&#39;s body was now far more voluptuous than before. The curves were definitely more prominent and her breasts had swelled several sizes. Her hair had grown out much longer, falling down just above her waist. She looked radiant.<br />
<br />
Chris felt a soft, tingling sensation crawling over her skin. She looked down. Her clothes began changing into something more regal. Her black button up shirt had begun its metamorphosis into something exquisite; a shimmering ball-gown that covered much of the floor, something fit for a ballroom. It was a deep purple, with intricate needlework delicately outlining its bodice and adorning it with glittering jewels, embroidered in a way that appeared to have taken countless days to complete.<br />
<br />
The skirt blossomed outwards in an explosion of fabric, creating a perfect silhouette around her waist. It was truly a piece of art in the form of an outfit, and fit her form perfectly. Looking over her shoulder, she noticed that a long cape trailed behind her. She looked like genuine royalty.<br />
<br />
Anne, meanwhile, had turned into a beautiful princess of a woman. Her lips looked a touch redder, her eyes a bit larger. Her nose and cheeks appeared rosier and the emerald earrings and diamond bracelets made her appearance appear all the more vibrant. Her gown was a tapestry of pristine white and gold, the bust perfectly framing her enlarged breasts and revealing a touch of cleavage, her bare shoulders accentuated by the ruffled collar, while her large, poofy, skirt flared out elegantly from her waist, displaying her smallish frame. There was no way anyone could confuse her with a peasant, this girl was a queen in the making.<br />
<br />
And then came the tiaras, levitating above their heads for a moment before settling into place. Chris&#39;s tiara was golden and dotted with brilliant white diamonds, while her cape clasp had metamorphosed into a glittering golden rose. Anne&#39;s crown shared many of the same features, with clear white diamonds radiating from its frame and with a heart-shaped locket dangling below her throat. She felt the cool metal of her tiara and was overwhelmed by emotion--a dream she&#39;d held since childhood had finally become reality.<br />
&quot;Anne?&quot; Chris said, faintly noticing the change of cadence and accent in her voice.<br />
Anne shook her head. Her princess training was kicking in. She raised a hand as if to correct her boyfriend, &quot;Milady, if anythi-&quot; She paused. Suddenly aghast at her own voice coming out of her mouth. &quot;I say! Lady Charlotte! My voice has changed!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris tilted her head, confused at both the change in speech patterns and the new name she was just called. Then, she realized; the drug had taken its toll not just on their bodies, but on their minds and souls.</p>
