<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt thought about the cornucopia of options offered by the Chronivac. There were so many things that they could try, but as he looked over the list, he realized there was something he wanted to try.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey dad, I was thinking about what we could try, and I have a plan... but I need your help with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you have in mind?&quot; Mike asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you know I always wanted a pet since when I was young, but we never got one. Now that we have the Chronivac, I was hoping that you could help me with this wish...&quot;<br />
<br />
It took a while before Mike understood what Matt was trying to say. &quot;So you&#39;re saying you want me to become a pet for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt mustered all his confidence to reply, &quot;...Yeah. I thought it would be an interesting experience for you. Since you&#39;ve been taking care of us for so long, I figured you could enjoy a break like this, with nothing to worry about. Please dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike pondered over Matt&#39;s proposition. It was a huge request for Mike to turn into a pet for Matt, if the Chronivac was even capable of that. But Mike felt that Matt was responsible enough to take care of a pet, and he wanted to be able to grant Matt his wish even after all this time.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Mike gave in. &quot;Alright... I&#39;ll do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s eyes lit up. &quot;Thanks dad! You&#39;re awesome.&quot; He excitedly pulled up the animal transformation option, and a huge list of animal species appeared. He turned to his dad. &quot;Which one should we pick?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike looked at the options, considering each one. He guessed that Matt would probably want a cool pet. As he thought about his choices, he had an inkling of what he could try. He had been fascinated by reptiles as a kid, but the one memory that stood out was his friend showing off his pet python. Mike remembered how huge it looked, and how he was in awe of the powerful yet magnificent creature. It was probably cool enough for Matt&#39;s standards, and he trusted that he was mature enough to learn how to care for a python as a pet. &quot;Matt, I think I&#39;ll go with becoming a python. What do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt was momentarily stunned. &quot;Dad, are you sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, why not? It&#39;s a pretty cool pet, not one that you see everyday. I think it&#39;d be fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt decided to go with his dad&#39;s choice. He clicked on the option to apply the transformation to Mike, and started adjusting the settings. They set the transformation to happen over 15 minutes, and for Mike to be a python for a full day. Mike decided that to be safe, he should still keep his human mind during the transformation. Matt noticed the pleasurable option and selected it, wondering why anyone wouldn&#39;t want it. Finally, they had to set a reality change so that no one else would notice what had happened to Mike. <br />
<br />
They came to the end of the settings, and looked through it a few times to check everything was right. Finally, the time had come to start the transformation. Both Mike and Matt were nervous and excited about what would happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready, dad?&quot; Matt asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I sure am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;m starting the changes now.&quot; Matt hit the enter button, activating the emitter. Immediately, Mike felt a tingling spread through his body, as if a wave of static electricity had passed him by, brushing against his skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt? I felt a tingling sensation just after you pressed the button. Is this supposed to happen?&quot; asked Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have a clue, but it might be a sign that it&#39;s starting.&quot; Matt could only hope that the Chronivac was working as intended. He noticed that a countdown for 10 minutes was already ticking. Mike, meanwhile, was anxious about the changes, feeling his heart pounding and the adrenaline coursing through his system as he waited nervously for something to happen.<br />
<br />
An itching manifested itself around Mike&#39;s belly. He absent-mindedly reached down to scratch it, but oddly, it didn&#39;t relieve the itch. Instead, it seemed to spread and grow more intense. Mike knew something was off, and he lifted his singlet to check. He found a patch of dry skin around his navel. Running a finger along it, Mike felt the texture change, becoming smooth and tough. His eyes widened as he saw the dry skin spread outwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt, I think it&#39;s happening!&quot; Mike exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Is it working?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It definitely is, I can see the skin changing.&quot; Mike watched as the change radiated outwards from his navel, the skin changing before his very eyes. Near the center of his gut where the change started, the curly brown abdominal hair fell off, revealing the smooth underlying skin. Matt saw that the transformation had really started, and remembered something important he had to tell his dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad... this is going to sound awkward, but... I think you should remove your clothes or they&#39;ll be ruined.&quot; Matt stammered and blushed slightly as the mental image of seeing his nude dad weirded him out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guess you&#39;re right, son. I won&#39;t be needing them in a few minutes anyway.&quot; Mike said as he pulled off his clothes to reveal his naked body in its full glory. Matt grimaced internally, but Mike knew exactly what his son was thinking and chuckled. &quot;Aw, come on, there&#39;s nothing embarrassing about this. Besides, you aren&#39;t the one naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike inspected his body for more changes. By now, the skin had spread over most of his belly. The generous layer of hair on his formerly hairy gut had mostly shed off, leaving his belly smooth. The smooth skin was spreading around his sides towards his back, and up and down his torso. Mike noticed his navel slowly fading away, as the depression flattened out and disappeared without a trace. Placing his hands on his slightly round stomach, Mike realized that it was shrinking and flattening. An unexpected bonus, but only temporary, since there were going to be many more changes to his body structure.<br />
<br />
An itching in his crotch signaled the start of the transformation there. Mike moved his attention downwards to see the skin becoming smooth and tough. His dense brown bush of pubic hair fell out in clumps as the skin underneath became inhuman. However, a warmth began to concentrate in his dick, causing it to throb and grow to a full erection. Mike felt a growing, basal urge to pleasure himself as he grew more aroused. Matt was somewhat horrified until he remembered that they had checked the pleasurable option, and finally understood what the Chronivac meant by pleasurable.<br />
<br />
Mike reached down to touch his erect length, too horny to resist the temptation. Under his touch, he felt his dick begin to morph and shift. The head lost its shape, the tip blunting while the rest of it became continuous with the shaft. The shaft itself was somehow growing wider and a depression was forming in the middle. Suddenly, the shaft split into two in an immense rush of pleasure, forming two cocks. Mike grunted as he came powerfully, ejecting a huge load of cum. His balls had emptied out all their remaining human sperm, and began to change as well. They pulled upwards and popped back inside his body, journeying to the proper positions in a snake. His now empty scrotum shriveled back and flattened as the skin there turned smooth too. While his dicks continued morphing into their new reptilian forms, a slit appeared in the smooth skin surrounding them, forming their new protective home. Fully spent, his flaccid cocks retreated into the slit, leaving Mike with a smooth crotch that bore no evidence of his former manhood and testes.<br />
<br />
Mike was embarrassed by the accidental indecency in Matt&#39;s presence, but shrugged it off sheepishly since neither of them had expected this to happen. Matt was just hoping that he could forget what he had just seen. <br />
<br />
The lower half of Mike&#39;s torso was now fully covered by the smooth skin, and the skin on his chest and the upper half of his back was also rapidly changing. His pelt of brown chest hair fell out as the changes spread, and even his nipples had been obliterated. The skin had started to take on some texture. On his belly, long horizontal plates started to grow and overlap, becoming the scutes on a python&#39;s underside. Near his sides, however, the texture changed to scales, and scales were also starting to form along his back. Mike could feel the scales and scutes pushing out of his skin.<br />
<br />
Mike felt a strange feeling above his butt. He reached back to feel a pointed appendage push its way out, and knew that this was going to be his tail. Mike ran a hand along his growing tail, feeling the smooth scales and scutes that were growing on it. He found that he could move his new tail slightly and feel his own touch on it. There was a cracking in his back as new vertebrae formed in his spine, causing his torso to stretch out. It didn&#39;t hurt, but it was still a little disconcerting. From his knowledge of snakes, Mike knew that this would be a drastic process, as his spine would have to extend dramatically. <br />
<br />
Mike could see his vantage point move higher as his body lengthened, but it was becoming harder to reach back to touch his tail. Mike brought his hands forward and felt something strange. Holding his hands up in front of his eyes, he watched as the fingers began to shorten. He took a glance at his feet and saw his toes shrinking into his feet too. It seemed that it was time for Mike&#39;s limbs to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like I won&#39;t be able to stand any longer,&quot; Mike remarked. &quot;Matt, help me lay myself down.&quot;<br />
<br />
With Matt&#39;s help, Mike carefully lay down on his side in front of the mirror in Matt&#39;s room, so that he could still watch the changes. His fingers and toes were almost gone now, leaving his hands and feet heavily deformed. His arms and legs were also starting to lose their form and pull back into his torso. Yet, at the same time, his torso continued to lengthen and narrow, losing its human form as more vertebrae and ribs grew in. His internal organs shifted to accommodate his changing shape, moving into a linear layout. The muscles on his torso strengthened, giving him more power to constrict his prey with. His limbs were now rapidly-disappearing short stumps, and even his hips were all but gone.<br />
<br />
The scales and scutes began to take on new colors, as Mike&#39;s gained his patterning. Across his sides and back, the scales darkened into shades of brown and black, forming geometric patterns. The scutes on his underside became light and pale, in contrast to the rest of his body. Mike turned over to lie on his belly and gradually learned how to move in his new form, attempting to slither around to get a better view of his size. He estimated his body to be more than 10 feet long and still growing. He could see that his limbs were now completely gone, his body now serpentine. But even then, it was still evident that he was becoming a truly mighty beast.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s growth began to slow down as he approached his full length, and the changes advanced up his neck. The skin of his neck grew scales and scutes like the rest of his body. Mike felt his head shift, his skull realigning to point his head forward. The final phase of changes had started. Mike felt his teeth change into fangs as he ran over them with his tongue, which started to extend and become forked. Meanwhile, his brown hair and beard, and even his eyebrows fell off as the skin on his face changed. Mike felt his face push outwards as his nose flattened out, the nostrils shifting. New pits formed along his mouth, giving him the ability to sense heat. Finally, as the scales covered his face, Mike&#39;s eyes shifted towards the sides of his head and changed. As Mike completed his transformation, the timer on the Chronivac chimed. Mike was now a fearsome python.<br />
<br />
Matt stared in awe as he admired the beast that was his dad just minutes ago. He still couldn&#39;t believe that he had watched his dad transform into a python. But now, he needed to to take care of his new pet python Mike.</p>
