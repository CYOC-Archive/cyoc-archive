<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Titty, er Ty...&quot; quietly spoke Rachel, having remembered everything. She was so confused at the moment. &quot;Ah this feels so wrong. I should hate you for what you did to me, but I just can&#39;t because of this submissive persona which is only directed towards you. And now because of it, it is making me happy and excited about how you forcibly raped me and wants you to do it more. Fuck. I don&#39;t know anymore. It is like I can&#39;t be mad at you and it is both a calming feeling while also pissing me off. The fact that we are stuck together doesn&#39;t help either.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I am so sorry. Something came over me, like they use some kind of drug or something. Also, though maybe the timing could be better bu, is Ty your chosen nickname for me now?&quot; Titty asked. She remembered what happened, but still thought she was a girl named Tittellia, not a guy named Ty. She had remembered the actions, but her own identity had been overwritten by the last conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, no. Your name is Ty, unless you have been lying your entire life. And to correct my previous statment, you were a guy. Are you perhapse, not able remember who you really were, and only what you, uh, you know, what you did to me?&quot; Meakly replied Rachel.<br />
<br />
This revelation shocked Titty. Now she was actually a he? Furthermore, only she somehow didn&#39;t know that? &quot;No, something must be still messed up with the wish. She somehow thinks I was someone else. I mean, it would make sense in a way, I guess, but even before, she had started by calling me Titty still. So maybe she is trying to mess with me for a bit of payback.&quot; Thought Titty, completely overlooking the fact that Rachel would never lie to her while she was in this state, due to her being completely submissive as well as loyal to her. Rachel lying to her at this time was practically impossible. &quot;Maybe 1 more wish will fix this.&quot; She determined. &quot;I wish I always have been Tittellia, a futanari girl.&quot; She knew just changing Rachels memory was impossible due to her previous eish, so she would just have to rewish her own self back to normal. But of course, she didn&#39;t realize that she had just accidentally erased her former self from existence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, are you sure I was once a guy named Ty, Rachel?&quot; Titty asked, testing to see if it worked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, I am sorry sweetie, I don&#39;t even know what I was thinking. You are clearly my girlfriend Tittellia. And no, I obviously will keep using the same nickname I gave you years ago, Titty. Can&#39;t have me overwriting your perfect name which represents you most defining features right?&quot; Joked Rachel. She had decided that only just this once, and only since she was her girlfriend, that she would forgive Titty&#39;s actions and simply take it as her being out of her own control because of some demon drug or something. &quot;Now, with all of that being cleared up, why don&#39;t we move on to this brand new, (and cute, she thought in her head) progression? You moo&#39;d just now, didnt you Titty. I didn&#39;tforget it, and you won&#39;tbe avoiding the question either. My. Little. Cow.&quot;<br />
<br />
A chill ran down Titty&#39;s spine, going throughout the rest of her body. &quot;Mooooooo!&quot; She let out accidentally, while her mind was still experiencing the sudden chills. Now she had done it. She had hopped that Rachel would have forgotten about her previous outburst with their conversation, but it didn&#39;t work. Glancing at the clock, only confirmed her suspicion. 12:01am. Dominant Rachel had arrived and had brought submissive Titty along with her. For the next 24 hours at least. She knew now there was no hope for her with dropping this topic. <br />
<br />
Reluctantly, Titty let out another moo, though this time, she did it on purpose, no longer trying to stifle them. She had been having the urge to occasionally let out a few moo&#39;s for the past hour or so. Clearly this was her next progression into a cowgirl. &quot;It is my next stage apparently. I get Mooooo!&quot; Titty currently was looking back at Rachel, completely red now with her mouth hanging open in total embarrassment. She just wanted to disappear. &quot;I-I-I just get these sudden urges to... you know, moo... b-because well... I-... I&#39;m becomming a cowgirl, ok so I am going to moo. So, stop staring at me like tha-Mooooooo!&quot; She tried to continue, but ended up shouting at Rachel in the end entirely due to overloading with embarrassment, which ended up causing her to once again interrupt herself with another moo. <br />
<br />
Rachel just watched Titty with an amused smirk on her face. She felt that her girlfriend&#39;s moo&#39;s were adorable, but nothing compared as to how cute she was when she was embarrassed, especially to the extent that she currently was. This Titty was truly the cutest Titty, she determined in her head. Taking her right index finger, she leaned forward, pressing Titty&#39;s lips shut as she moved closer to her ear. Then she said in a whisper &quot;That was quite bold of you, my little cow. Suddenly raising your voice in towards me. However, I might be willing to forgive you. That is, as long as you manage to convince me. Now then, what will you do to convince me I wonder?&quot; <br />
<br />
After saying that, she leanded her upper body back to her normal position, still amusingly staring right at Titty, directing her aura of pure confidence and superiority at her. She knew her whispering was effective because while she didn&#39;t change her facial expression, titty had clamped down with her entire pussy, which Rachel could feel getting absolutely soaking wet. Normally it was just moist enough to not harm either of them from just moving around. However she could now hear the telltale dripping sound of liquid on pavement. <br />
<br />
Titty, after hearing what Rachel said, had frozen. She realized what she had done to her dominant girlfriend. Although she couldn&#39;t move a muscle, her body had taken over for her, lubing her pussy up while gently tightening down on the ever present monster of a bull cock in anticipation of the fucking she would be soon receiving. &quot;Moooooooo!&quot; Was all she could say as Rachel grabbed her tits, playing with her longer nipples, as Titty began to slowly pump herself up and down with her newly aquired pussy muscles that she had gotten from yesterday&#39;s injection.</p>
