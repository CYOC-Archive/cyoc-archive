<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle rolled his eyes in annoyance, and decided that Mrs. Jones could also use an attitude adjustment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Jones, transform or dare?&quot; Kyle smirked diabolically.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Mrs. Jones says. &quot;Kyle, you now have detention, so sit down and stay there. Further, you may not speak until I tell you that you may. And the same goes for you, Miss Jennifer Smith.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle tried to say something, but his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth like it was glued there by industrial strength peanut butter.  And he couldn&#39;t move from his seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, class, except for Kyle and Jennifer, I want you to answer &#39;Dare&#39; to this question,&quot; and she looked over the lot. &quot;Class except for Kyle and Jennifer, transform or dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
They obediently answered, &quot;Dare&quot; even though some of them wanted to say &quot;Transform&quot; instead. It was like she somehow had the power to compel their answers, which of course she did. Even though the school could not prevent the use of the curse, they could and did use its power to protect their teachers and staff, since the students didn&#39;t have the good sense to stay within reasonable boundaries, so all the teachers had been cursed to be immune to the curse so long as they were teachers unless they agreed to it, and they had been dared to have the power to compel their students to obey when they were attempting to misuse it. Because, dear readers, even though the school board might not completely believe in it, the school administrators from the Principle down to the Janitors had all been given a very specific protection, because teachers and administrators are not stupid, and the curse is not that smart.  Of course, they did not remember that the curse was real either, except for a few who were responsible for maintaining the defenses, at least they didn&#39;t remember until some student tried to use it on them.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Jones looked at all the obedient classmates, and at the disgusting mess of fecal matter sprayed across the room, some of it having gotten onto other students.  She determined the proper punishment, but first, to repair the trauma to the other students.<br />
&quot;Very well. Your dare is to forget that anything involving the curse or its effects has happened today, and to return to your state of doubt that the curse is real, and none of you Dare-accepters will use the curse on anyone before next month. Now go to sleep for the next ten minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The class obeyed, as they had no choice.  Mrs. Jones looked at Kyle rather the same way that the Medusa looked at intruding males.<br />
&quot;Kyle, transform or dare.&quot;   Kyle couldn&#39;t move, though, because she hadn&#39;t given him permission.<br />
&quot;Now, Mr. Kyle Perkins. You seem to have completely forgotten all morality and all common decency if you ever had any.  I cannot remove the ability to use the curse completely from you, or it will backfire in a horrible way, but I can tell you this.  You have not answered me.  Isn&#39;t it unfortunate that I told you to be silent? Anyone in your position should be terrified and ashamed and be expecting the worst possible punishment. And we&#39;ll be making sure of that.  First, your transformation.  This is a staged transformation.  You will transform into a gelatinous blob, like the ones in that game you were playing last week during detention, except that instead of dissolving flesh, clothing or metal, you will only dissolve and consume feces and other human wastes, and you will be excruciatingly hungry. It will still smell and taste like what it is, and will be thoroughly disgusting and horrible to you, of course, but you will be hungry enough that you will flow over every surface in this classroom and cleanse every bit of the filth your nasty-minded curse has caused Miss Smith to spray about, and it includes the vomit in the garbage can and everything in her diaper. You will leave behind a pleasant clean lemon scent.  You will then return to your normal human form as it was before any use of the curse on yourself, and remain human until the end of the week. At the end of the week, should you have used the curse in any way that goes beyond harmless pranking, you will be cursed to return to the gelatinous glob form, which cannot speak, and you will remain that way until and unless everyone you have cursed is restored and forgives you.  This weekly re-judgement will remain a permanent and recurring part of your being for as long as you live and cannot be removed by the curse. It exists to make you think about consequences. For your dare, you are to apologize to me, to Jennifer, and to anyone else you&#39;ve harmed with your perverted antics, and you are free of any compulsions and commands that may have been given to you by previous uses of the curse before this. After this and any time going forward when you attempt to use the curse, you will remember your misdeeds, feel shame and remorse, and will consider the effects on the people you are cursing and on the people around them.  Do you understand? You may nod if so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle nodded his head frantically, as he was already becoming translucent and jelly-like.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then get to cleaning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle felt himself dissolve and every bit of his transparent surface could taste and smell everything he was touching. He slimed about like a gelatinous roomba over the surfaces, walls, floors, and desks, removing any trace of feces from the students, the room, and oh yes, the nasty sour bitter vomit from the trash can.  He was still starving hungry, and knew it would only be satisfied if he cleaned Jennifer, so he swirled around her and her desk, dissolving and devouring the massive mess she&#39;d emitted, cleaning out her diapers and clothing, and leaving her looking like a pig who had been bathed and deodorized for a contest then stuck in human clothing.<br />
<br />
When he was done, he found himself reverting to his regular form... but not the geeky, skinny nerdy one he had been in. He was a year older, and an athlete. He remembered then that he had been Jennifer&#39;s boyfriend and that someone had cursed him to be the geeky nerd -- one of the football players.  The Dare took place, and he found himself apologizing to Jennifer -- and that was a sincere apology, because he still loved her and couldn&#39;t believe he&#39;d been forced to do this to her.  Then he apologized to Mrs. Jones for acting like a smug little dick.<br />
<br />
Jennifer meanwhile remembered that Kyle had been someone else, and was furious at what had been done to him as well as what he&#39;d been made to do to her by the curse, but she still couldn&#39;t move.  Even though a pig, she was still a student at the school and Mrs. Jones&#39; orders were binding at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this is interesting,&quot; Miss Jones said. &quot;I can see that there&#39;s something else going on here. I&#39;ll have to notify the principal that there have been undetected changes.  Kyle, return to your seat please.  I need to deal with Miss Smith.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle sat down, with two sets of memories, and a great desire to revenge himself, but fully aware that things would not go well if he did.  And he wanted nothing to do with being a feces-devouring slimy blob again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Smith. Transform or dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naturally Jennifer was unable to reply, and Mrs. Jones waited the full minute.<br />
&quot;Good. You receive both. Your transformation is to return completely to the form you had before anyone used the transformation curse on you. Your dare is to return to normal behavior as you had before you were cursed, so you do not have to comply with any dares made before this one. You will, however, always be aware that any use of the curse has consequences, and you will never use it for permanent harm, only for short, harmless pranks.  You may transform now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer was abruptly herself, but again not quite the same self.  Her snotty attitude and evil cheerleader arrogance evaporated; still quite attractive but with smaller breasts and slightly less perfect skin, she was once again a real person rather than the stereotype she&#39;d become when the ... quarterback of the football team had decided to ruin her for turning him down, and turned her into the stereotype of a cheerleader.<br />
<br />
She was both furious and heartbroken.<br />
<br />
There were five minutes left to class, and the student who had run earlier was abruptly thrust back into the room, followed by the vice-principle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Vedder. I was about to send a note to you. We have a problem.  Oh, and while I&#39;m at it... Jason? answer &quot;dare&quot; to my next question.  Jason, transform or dare?&quot; Mrs. Jones was completely efficient, as per the instructions she&#39;d been given.<br />
<br />
Jason answered Dare, of course, and was given the same orders as the other innocents in class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, Jennifer, please report to Mr. Davies in the counselor&#39;s office, where you can discuss things with him. He&#39;ll help you deal with your anger over this situation without escalating things unduly,&quot; Mrs Jones advised.<br />
<br />
The bell rang, and the rest of the class woke and headed for their next class, while Mrs. Jones talked with James Vedder about what she&#39;d seen with Kyle and Jennifer.  The school would need to take steps.</p>
