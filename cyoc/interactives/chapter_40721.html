<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yesterday...<br />
<br />
Clara was wondering what she should do. In the back of her mind she knew that she had been a guy named Rick. That part of her was torn between staying like this or trying to find a way to change back. She didn't want to have all those worries again but she had a different set of worries now. She was afraid that her body would betray her again and she'd have another period in public this time. Would it happen while she was at the water park?<br />
<br />
If she did decide to stay as a girl should she take her mother up on her offer? She let her mind drift back to a memory of her mother talking about her days at the school. She had said that she had been happy there. She had made a lot of friends, especially her three roommates. That was one of the things she was worried about, during the school year she would be living at the school. She would be away from her family and she would miss them, even her annoying sister.<br />
<br />
As she was trying to decide they arrived at the water park. The water park had water slides, a wave pool, bumper boats, water tube rides, and even an aquarium. When her mother had paid and they went inside she saw a sign saying they had a new attraction in the aquarium. It claimed that the park had a couple of young mermaids. Usually she would have thought that it was just a stunt but something seemed to be pulling her to see the mermaids. She was about to ask if they could go see the mermaids when her mother asked &quot;What do you two want to do first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to surf&quot; Christine said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to go see the mermaids&quot; Clara said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can be so stupid&quot; Christine said. &quot;Mermaids aren't real.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will not have you calling your sister stupid&quot; her mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I don't think they have actual mermaids&quot; Clara said knowing what to say to get Christine to want to go see them. &quot;Though we could go see them and laugh at the costumes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then let's go!&quot; Christine said running off in the direction the sign pointed.<br />
<br />
Clara smiled and her mother said &quot;Sometimes you can be too smart for your own good.&quot; Clara looked up at her mother and noticed that she was smiling too. She then ran after her sister with her mother close behind.<br />
<br />
Clara couldn't explain why she was drawn to the mermaids but she went to them any way. She didn't need the signs pointing the way and a couple of times she had to call to her sister when she went the wrong direction. Finally they arrived at the aquarium where the mermaids were kept. Clara was expecting a couple of women in mermaid costumes sitting on rocks. What she found was what looked like two little girls with actual fish tails swimming in the huge underwater tunnel. As they passed by she could tell that they were sisters and she flashed back to the arcade. The mermaids looked like the two girls she had seen at the entrance only younger and mermaids now.<br />
<br />
As she was watching them she noticed a five year old girl wearing a pale yellow sundress staring at them too. For some reason she felt drawn to this girl too. She went over by the girl and said &quot;They're beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl nodded her head and then said &quot;I think I know them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clara continued to watch the mermaids and said &quot;I think I've seen them before.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment a park employee came into the tunnel and started speaking. &quot;I'm sure most of you have questions&quot; the lady said. &quot;I'll be happy to answer any that you have but let me tell you a little about them. We found them holding onto a piece of wood about a month ago. We thought that they were just two little girls who had been in a boating accident. They were bleeding and there were sharks nearby. We naturally fished them out and were surprised that they seemed to be the mythical mermaid. We brought them back here and determined that they were actual mermaids. They tried to speak with us but all were could hear were screeches. It wasn't until we had put them in water and put in a microphone that we were able to understand them. They told us that they had been caught in a net but were able to cut their way loose with a sharp rock. They suffered numerous cuts and scrapes in the process.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did they tell you their names!?&quot; the girl interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes they did&quot; the lady said. &quot;They said their names are...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dani and Maria&quot; the girl interrupted again. &quot;The younger one is Dani and the older one is Maria.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know that young lady?&quot; the lady asked with a very puzzled expression on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; the girl said. &quot;I just know. They should be older though. How old are they now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dani has said that she's four and Maria has said she's six&quot; the lady said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They should be older&quot; Clara said. &quot;They should be teenagers. I think Dani should be fourteen or fifteen and Maria should be sixteen or seventeen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya&quot; the girl said. &quot;And Dani should be a boy instead of a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you girls come with me please?&quot; the lady said.<br />
<br />
Clara looked at the girl and then at her mother. Her mother just nodded indicating that she could go. The girl looked at what appeared to be her mother who looked at the lady and asked &quot;Why do you want to see them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to see what else they know&quot; the lady said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I could let Andrea go with you&quot; the girl's mother said. Looking down at her daughter she said &quot;Andrea, I wan't you to be good and stay with this lady. You know what to do in case anything happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mommy&quot; Andrea said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The same goes for you Clara&quot; her mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know Mom&quot; Clara said rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
They followed the lady into an office with one entire wall looking out into the aquarium. There at the wall was Dani and Maria. Once the door was closed she gestured for Andrea and Clara to sit down which they did. Clara sat rigid however prepared to fight or run or perhaps both if she needed to. The lady sat in a chair behind a desk and said &quot;Allow me to introduce myself. My name is May. Now Andrea, you seem to know the most about Dani and Maria. Everything you've said they have said except for how they were transformed. They mentioned a specific place that's involved. Do either of you two know it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The new arcade at the mall&quot; Andrea and Clara said at the same time.<br />
<br />
May nodded and said &quot;That's what they said. How do you two know them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; Andrea said. &quot;I just know them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw them at the entrance to the arcade a month ago&quot; Clara said. &quot;Though to me it just seems like yesterday or today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That arcade is no good&quot; Andrea said. &quot;I got a couple of eggs and Dani and I were able to open one. Three bras popped out and we dared each other to try them on. We turned into girls with penises. I was able to open the other one and out popped three pairs of panties. I put one on by accident and it changed me the rest of the way to a girl. I put another pair on by accident again and it made me five. I remember now that Dani is my friend and Maria is his older sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why couldn't you remember before?&quot; May asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That may be part of the transformation&quot; Clara said. &quot;I was a guy before I opened up the egg I got in the arcade. Inside was the swimsuit I'm wearing now. Though I just touched it and I was in so much pain. When it went away I was as you see me and a month had passed. My memories of my old life are dim but still there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Dani and Maria seem to be happy with their lives&quot; May said. &quot;They no longer want to try to return to the way they were. What about you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You believe us?&quot; Clara asked stunned. She had never suspected that anyone would believe her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do&quot; May said. &quot;It was your knowledge that made me believe. When Dani and Maria told us their story I didn't believe them but now I do. So, are you two happy with your lives now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am&quot; Andrea said. &quot;I got two more things from the arcade that make up for what happened. They were two rings. One changes me into Molly Elizabeth Cunningham from Tail Spin and the other changes me back. I won't go back to that arcade now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about you Clara?&quot; May asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I couldn't decide if I should try to fix myself or not&quot; Clara began. &quot;But now I'll stay the way I am. I see that if I try to fix myself things can get worse. I could end up a bug.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ewwww&quot; Andrea said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand&quot; May said. &quot;I'm going to extend an invitation to both of you to come here whenever you wish, free of charge, to see Dani and Maria. We're planning on building an outdoor tank to let people swim with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be great!&quot; Clara said. &quot;Can my sister get in free too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mine too?&quot; Andrea asked.<br />
<br />
May smiled and said &quot;We'll see. Now I need to go get a couple of passes for you two. Stay here and I'll be back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once May left the office Andrea said &quot;Mommies signing me and my sister up at an all girls school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which school is that?&quot; Clara asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's called Mrs. Mur... Mur...&quot; Andrea started to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Muriel's School for Girls&quot; Clara prompted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya that's it!&quot; Andrea said. &quot;Are you going there too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My Mom offered to enroll me in it just this morning as a birthday present&quot; Clara said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy Birthday!&quot; Andrea said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; Clara said then smiled. &quot;If you're going to be there I think I may go too. At least we'll each know at least one person there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great!&quot; Andrea said. &quot;If only Dani and Maria could go then it would be the greatest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe there's a way that they can&quot; Clara wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think so?&quot; Andrea asked.<br />
<br />
Before Clara could answer May came back in and handed each of them a pass. &quot;These passes have your names on them&quot; she said. &quot;These are temporary until we get ones with your pictures on them. We'll need a current head shot for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok&quot; Clara and Andrea said at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; May said with a smile. &quot;Is there anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can Dani and Maria go to Mrs. Muriel's School for Girls?&quot; Clara asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll see what I can do but I can't promise anything&quot; May said. &quot;Anything else?&quot; Andrea and Clara shook their heads and May said &quot;Alright then. Let's get you back to your mothers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once Clara was back with her mother she said &quot;Mom, I want to go to Mrs. Muriel's School for Girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's wonderful!&quot; her mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're going to be a stuck up snob&quot; Christine said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't talk like that to your sister Christine!&quot; her mother said. &quot;Now, let's enjoy the rest of your birthday. We'll have to leave before five so you girls can get ready to go out for your birthday dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clara now knew what the dress on the back of the door was for.</p>
