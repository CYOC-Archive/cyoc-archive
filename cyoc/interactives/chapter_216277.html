<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maybe he really should try something extreme. Something so outrageous, it was bound to freak others out unless reality changed accordingly. <br />
Thus Sean began to just mess around with the options until he saw and realized one that was bound to make things rather... interesting.<br />
Udders. Freaking udders. From cows all the way to those of other animals. And he could attach them to his model. <br />
That was when an idea popped in his mind as he picked and dragged a cow udder towards his model only to have it replace his dick and balls actually. Then he pulled up the options and quickly typed in: &#39;Produces milk that can work as cum. Milk production replaces bladder.&#39; No way did he want the contents of the udder mixed with anything else. However, then his gaze fell on the teats and he just wanted to make further tests. <br />
He pulled up the options for dicks and checked which ones he liked best before finding an above average one that he thought would make do. And thus he dragged it over to the udder four times. Replacing each teat with a dick respectively. Now it really looked outrageous. A giant udder fit for a dairy cow attached to his crotch with four above average dicks as teats. Hell, it look like he could have attached a huge water melon to his crotch. <br />
But he also made sure to just increase the sensitivity of it as well. If he already gave himself that as a new dick just to mess around, he might as well make it so it would feel hella good for the time he had it as well. <br />
And when he was done, Sean finally pressed &#39;Accept Changes&#39; and almost immediately he was hit with a wave of pleasure.<br />
It felt like his crotch was on fire. To the point as though he was experiencing an orgasm so extreme, he could hardly stop himself from letting out a loud moan as he leaned forward and grabbed his crotch. Fuck, he forgot to take off his pants... And yet the idea of feeling the growth press against the fabric only increased the sheer pleasure he felt. It was intense, he just began to tightly grab onto himself. That already was enough to make him feel like he could cum at any second.<br />
Yet his hands felt as though they were being pushed away. Pushed away by the mass filling the front of his pants alongside the four growths on top of it. He felt like the fabric was presisng down far too tightly on him by now, and yet the sheer pleasure it brought him was so intense, he wanted even more. Even when it became painful, it only sent more waves of ecstasy all over him. Even the moment he finally did try to pull his pants down made him grunt and moan in utter lust and pleasure. It felt amazing. <br />
Yet when he finally managed to pull them down, it allowed Sean to finally see the udder still growing along with the four dick-teats. It looked beyond outlandish, and yet he was so turned ln by the experience and pleasure alone, he immediately grabbed two of the dicks and began to stroke at them with all his might, increasing the intense feeling as he laid down on his back. The udder continued to grow, the fullness more than evident. And yet it felt to him as though the veins of it were pulsating and further pumping blood in all four of his erect cocks which he kept stroking and even pulling at the whole time. It was during this that he realized that this was also the only way he could cum. &#39;Milking himself&#39;. Yes, he increased the pleasure, but he did not make it so he could still cum like he used to. It was still an udder. And fuck did it feel great. He never felt anything like this before. Even pressing down on the flesh of the udder sent shivers down his pain and only increased his arousal. <br />
He didn&#39;t know how long he was basically masturbating and milking himself, but it must have been a long time. Because when he finally came down from his high, it was already 4pm. And Sean finally got to see the mess he made from all the milking. Yet even he had to admit that this was the best orgasm he&#39;s ever had. Hell, just for that alone he was more than tempted to keep that thing or make it... even better. Especially if reality was to truly change and make it so he&#39;s always had this. <br />
Though, when he tried to get up, the newly added  weight of the udder did make him struggle quite a bit. Not to mention the fact that every little bump, stroke and moment it pressed against his thights, it was literally about to make him get turned on again. Clearly an effect of the sensitivity he added to it. But he did need to at least wear something. Altered reality or not, there was no way he&#39;d run around showing off his dick to his roommates. Plus.. the idea of the fabric pressing down and rubbing against him with every step... it just was too good to not try out again. <br />
Though, just as he moved to do so, he paused and looked at the Chronviac again. He could also just.. make it a little bigger. Sure, it was already huge but the idea that the udder could be bigger... including his dicks... It really was tempting. Especially since it would mean he could experience such ecstasy of it growing all over again.</p>
