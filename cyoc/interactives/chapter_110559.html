<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Fuck ..... someone needs to see ... to FEEL this Beast growing bigger ....&quot;<br />
<br />
Then he remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;JOEY! Get the fuck back in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey walked back into the room, where the musclebound Guy was waiting for him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Get over here Joey.  This beast ain&#39;t done with you yet.&quot;  <br />
<br />
He did a double bicep pose, his body putting on a crazy pump that even the biggest bodybuilders would salivate at.  Joey could swear that even amongst the pump, Guy&#39;s body was swelling bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Worship my muscles, man.  I want you to feel me growing bigger.  UUMMMPPPHHHH .. growing stronger.&quot; <br />
<br />
The beast laid down on the floor in the middle of the locker room.  He looked up over his beefy pecs and beckoned Joey toward him.  At first Joey was unsure, but after Guy assured him it would be ok, he straddled Guy&#39;s huge muscle gut, feeling his naked balls rub against guy&#39;s hard round plated stomach.  He sat looking at Guy in front of the muscle hunk&#39;s dick, which at 12&quot; was very impressive.  Slowly it rose to attention, riding higher and higher until it reach just to the middle of Joey&#39;s back.  It was as hard as steel, which gave Joey a nice backrest as he watched the changes unfold.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Guy grew from 400lbs to 450lbs in about half a second.  His face tensed as his body swelled, the veins becoming apparent in his neck and arms, as though he had just undergone a full body workout.  <br />
<br />
As the growth slowed, Joey found himself adjusting his position on the hunk as the muscle gut had become larger.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like I grow bigger when you rub me up.&quot; Guy winked.  Joey noticed that Guy&#39;s stubble had thickened since when he last looked at him, and his jaw had squared off even more amid the shaggy sandy blonde hair, which in fact seemed to be getting shorter with each growth spurt.  As Joey began to massage Guy, the bloating man of muscle mass suddenly underwent another growth spurt, reaching the weight of 530lbs.  His arms had swelled to the size of beach balls, and his ball gut was steadily bloating bigger as a result of the cream.<br />
<br />
Guy&#39;s body was smooth due to the immense amounts of cream that Joey had lathered on Guy.  He traced the behemoth&#39;s 8-pack, feeling every ridge and crevasse.  He stuck his finger in Guy&#39;s belly button, giving it a gentle swish as a soft &quot;ooohhh&quot; escaped Guy&#39;s lips.  He turned around and focussed on the cock, which was standing erect and now almost as big as Joey was.  The angry purple head was almost the size of Joey&#39;s own head, and the balls that hung low looked to be swelling bigger as they churned with copious amounts of man seed.   <br />
<br />
&quot;You can touch kid, but ...  UUUGGGGHHHHHH ....... don&#39;t overdo it&quot; said Guy from behind his growing wall of pectorals as his body suddenly burst momentarily with more muscle.  His voice was slowly changing, becoming low and baritone with each gradual burst of growth.  No longer able to straddle his abdomen, Joey slid down to the base of Guy&#39;s scrotum, where his chest pressed against Guy&#39;s mammoth penis.  After that surge of growth, the giant dick was just slightly bigger than Joey.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly, another surge of growth.  A shorter interval than last time.  It was all Joey could do not to fall off, so he grabbed Guy&#39;s dick and held on for dear life.  It was like a mini volcano: warm, pulsating.  As Joey pressed his face against it he could almost feel the blood coursing through it as it grew bigger and bigger.  He began to massage it with his fingers, to which an even lower moan could be heard from Guy.<br />
<br />
He heard the sound of creaking.  Guy had grown so large that he was starting to fill out the room.  The lockers were uprooted, and fell against Guy&#39;s expansive body.  Whilst they were heavy enough to crush a normal man, they stood no chance against this growing muscle monster.  <br />
<br />
Joey took the opportunity to have a look around the bed of swelling flesh that he found himself on.  Behind him was the Great Pec Wall of Guy, capped with engorged nipples that were easily the size of Joey&#39;s head.  They hung over the abdominals, each of which were larger than the biggest bricks, and still growing.  The belly button was now large enough that Joey could stick his fist inside and still have room to spare.  He took to climbing the Great Pec Wall, taking care not to get caught in the canyon that was his cleavage.  Intentionally pinching a nipple along the way, Joey was rewarded with a deep rumble from Guy that shook the foundations of the room, followed by a surge of growth once more.  The nipples instantly puffed up from the size of his fist to the size of his head, whilst the behemoth&#39;s pecs swelled to massive proportions, finally hitting the ceiling.  <br />
<br />
Guy&#39;s cock was not omitted from the growth.  It pulsated and grew to the point where it was touching Joey&#39;s back.  Anticipating that it would grow even bigger.  Joey held on to the giant&#39;s foreskin and rode above the Pec Wall on the engorged penis.  The penis was starting to leak precum.  But what may be &#39;leak&#39; to a growing muscle beast is a torrent of sticky fluid to a normal man, which made it all the more difficult to hang on.  Fortunately, the seed lubed Joey up from head to toe, making it easy to slide between the giant dick and the Pec Wall cleavage as both giant parts grew bigger.</p>
