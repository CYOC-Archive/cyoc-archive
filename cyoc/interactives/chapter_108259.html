<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll take, uh, let&#39;s see, how about 6 meat-lovers&#39; pizzas, 6 sausage, 3 pepperoni, and what the hell, how about another 6 Philly Cheese Steak, all extra large,&quot; Hank subtly rubbed his stomach even as he placed the order. Jake himself found himself almost moaning in anticipation of the feat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hank, what the hell are you doing? We can&#39;t eat that much! There&#39;s only 5 of us here!&quot; Phil protested. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, relax, big guy, you&#39;re not the one paying! It&#39;s your last night of freedom and if I want to treat us to some pizzas then I&#39;m gonna do it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, we need something to wash down with all this beer!&quot; Joe added, motioning to the veritable stockpile they had accumulated for the event. Ever since Phil had gotten into microbrewing, he&#39;d gotten really into the subtle differences in beers, and his buddies had accounted for that by getting as many different kinds as they could track down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, whatever, but I&#39;m not dealing with fitting all the leftovers in my car! Between that and the candle I&#39;ll be smelling like pepperoni on the altar,&quot; Phil laughed, knowing that it was best at this point to just let Hank have his way. The former football linebacker had a way of stubbornly hunkering down on certain issues, and once he had settled on a decision there was rarely anything that could convince him to change his mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Great, they&#39;ll be here in 45 minutes. Hey, someone pass me another beer - and not one of those fruity ones! - i&#39;m feeling lucky this round.&quot; <br />
<br />
The gang continued to play the game, getting increasingly intoxicated. Even Phil was starting to look a little tipsy and loosened up a little after he tossed a few back. After a couple rounds, Jake let out a belch and clumsily got to his feet, declaring he had to take a leak. By this point he was well and truly drunk, and was feeling the waistband of his jeans cut a little uncomfortably into his sides. This level of bloating was usually his sign that he was done for the night, but there was no way he was cutting back on Phil&#39;s big bash!<br />
<br />
Stumbling into the bathroom, Jake realized that the smell from the candle really did permeate almost everything. He felt like he was in some Italian kitchen, not a cheap hotel. Fumbling with his belt, he realized that his discomfort wasn&#39;t only with his tight waistband - his dick was rock hard! <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah there, buddy, we haven&#39;t quite made it to the strip club yet,&quot; he mumbled, trying futilely to quell his raging hard-on. Usually, Jake had the worst case of whiskey dick - two beers and he would be soft for the rest of the night. As he maneuvered awkwardly to aim into the toilet, he wondered what could be different about tonight. Was there something in that candle? <br />
<br />
Jake stuffed his stiff cock back into his jeans, wincing a little as he zipped his pants back up before his next struggle came: no matter how hard he tried he couldn&#39;t get his pants to button back up! Glancing in the mirror, Jake realized that he must have really let himself go the past couple of weeks. It made sense, he&#39;d taken on a larger workload at his job and hadn&#39;t been heading to the gym as much as he&#39;d used to, but he never thought that a night out with friends would push him over the edge past being able to wear size 34s! Groaning, he patted his stuffed gut and let out another belch, hoping that getting rid of some gas would help with the bloating, but it seemed he had no such luck. <br />
<br />
Stumbling out into the room, he was hit by another powerful wave of the candle aroma. The guys seemed to have finished another round and were mostly waiting around for the pizzas to arrive, yakking and finishing a couple more beers. Now that Jake knew what to look for, he could tell from the various tented pants and uncomfortable outlines around the table that everyone else was suffering the same effect of the candle that he was. <br />
<br />
Before he resumed his seat, Jake bent over - with more than an expected level of difficulty - to retrieve the paper that had come with the candle. He had never heard of an olfactory aphrodisiac, but then again he had never bought candles from a sex shop either. While his vision was beginning to get a little hazy, he managed to make out the text that came with it: <br />

Jake didn&#39;t even have time to look over the supposedly inspirational poem that came with the candle when there came a knock at the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pizzas here!&quot; boomed Hank, adjusting his crotch as he got up to pay the delivery guy.</p>
