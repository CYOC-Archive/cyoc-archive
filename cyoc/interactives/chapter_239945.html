<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun beamed in from the window, lighting up Jeff&#39;s messy room. The unpainted white walls were covered in posters. Curvy models with wide hips and round perky tits, bulky men with overstuffed bulges, thick women spreading their pussies open with manicured fingers, slutty twinks on all fours fingering their pink bussies. Each of them with yellowed and crusty spots on the waxed paper. The floor was littered with used cumrags, used custom-made fleshlights and musky dirty clothes. Some workout equipment was also spread around here and there.<br />
<br />
Just a few pieces of furniture adorned the room: Jeff&#39;s cum-crusty Alaskan king, a dresser, his computer desk, a chair, and a wide mirror. He didn&#39;t need much in life; his cock and a hole. Maybe even a cock in his hole. He was a simple man.<br />
<br />
Absentmindedly, he picked up one of the multiples weights strewn across the floor, and worked on bicep curls. He opened the door to his room, and headed to the kitchen. There, a man wearing only an apron was preparing eggs and bacon on the cheap stove, the smell filling up the small room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sonny! We missed you at practice this morning,&quot; the cooking man teased, turning his head to Jeff and sticking his tongue out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Jeff chuckled as he approached the man from behind, bringing his free hand under his cook&#39;s apron, rubbing the burly ex-jock&#39;s stomach as he pulled him back towards himself. &quot;I can film content with the boys to celebrate their next win.&quot; He kissed the man&#39;s neck before licking all the way to his ear, nibbling it playfully.<br />
&quot;Ohhhh, sooooh–nny!&quot; the man let out, his knees buckling. &quot;You cou–ld at leas–t let me fi–inish you–r breakfa–ast!&quot; he stammered. Just then, he flipped an egg, the white flopping partially over itself. &quot;Dan–git,&quot; he half-moaned half-muttered.<br />
<br />
Jeff stopped nibbling the man&#39;s ear, before whispering, &quot;Good boy. I&#39;ll leave you at it then.&quot; He smooched the now-blushing man&#39;s cheek, adorned with a short salt and pepper stubble. Moving his hand away from the beefy stomach, Jeff squeezed the older man&#39;s ass. &quot;Hmm, feels pumped. Were you squatting over something this morning?&quot; he playfully teased as he walked away. <br />
<br />
A bit of blood pumped to Jeff&#39;s third leg as he left his roommate to cook him breakfast. He headed to his bedroom to pick up his cellphone, leaving the weight on the floor before heading back to the kitchen to sit at the dining table.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at his messages. Some of the most recent ones were from some of the boys:<br />
<br />
– Tyler<br />
bro, cant belive ull miss practice 2day :( i was ready 4 u<br />
– Curtis<br />
duuuuude dont leave us hangin plzzzzzzzz<br />
– Finn<br />
Jeffy!!! Skyla&#39;s with me today, she wants a 3way quickie before practice (This is Skyla btw ;))<br />
– Rafael<br />
youve got to make it today papito!<br />
<br />
The plate clanging on the table reminded Jeff of how hungry he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eat up sonny,&quot; the older man winked. He pulled a chair next to Jeff and sat down, his hand roaming on the hung stud&#39;s hairy, muscular thigh. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Melv,&quot; Jeff smiled at his roommate. He scarfed down the meal, vacuuming the plate&#39;s content in just a few short minutes. Done with his food, Jeff thumped his chest a few times, before letting out a loud burp. &quot;You&#39;re a good cook, boy. Did Beth teach you or...&quot;<br />
<br />
A bittersweet chuckle escape the ex-jock&#39;s mouth. &quot;She did.&quot; The burly man leaned in closer to Jeff, putting his head on the hunk&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Just a few years ago. I think she knew we were done for.&quot; <br />
<br />
This version of Jeff knew his roommate&#39;s ex-wife was a bit of a touchy subject ever since they&#39;d moved in together. But he silently enjoyed the power he held over this man. Causing the separation of a couple married for over 25 years was a turn-on to him. Every time he heard the name &#39;Beth&#39; uttered in a somewhat poignant manner reminded him of the time she caught him fucking her husband in their master bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sorry to hear coach,&quot; Jeff smirked, aroused at the pathetic display of sadness. He placed his arm around the football coach&#39;s waist, using his hand to caress the lesser man&#39;s package.<br />
<br />
&quot;J–Jeff!&quot; the man indignantly blurted out as he felt Jeff&#39;s bulky hand massage his cock and balls. He turned his head to face the younger, bigger, man.<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled his roommate closer, tightening the grip his arm held against the other man&#39;s waist, while he started stroking the smaller cock he held in his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Melvin,&quot; Jeff sternly said as his brows furrowed, &quot;you&#39;re a pathetic lil&#39; fuckin&#39; bitch when you talk about her.&quot; <br />
<br />
Melvin gasped as Jeff sped up his stroking.<br />
<br />
&quot;So–sorry– J–&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, WHAT,&quot; Jeff roared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiled darkly as Melvin showed him the proper respect, his colossal cock chubbing up as pre dripped on the floor. They were both in Jeff&#39;s appartment after all. Jeff was paying for it entirely, knowing most if not all of Melvin&#39;s assets were caught up in divorce paperwork. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy,&quot; Jeff praised. &quot;Am I going too fast?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melvin blushed, &quot;N– No sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff tightened his grip on the smaller-than-his-own cock as he sped up, collecting all the precum he could with every stroke. Melvin moaned and panted from the wet caresses, his hard cock throbbing and throbbing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Je–&quot; he caught himself, &quot;Sir....&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling Melvin&#39;s cock pulse made Jeff&#39;s reach full mast. He used his free hand to begin stroking himself, knowing full well he could not fully reach around it. He pointed the precum leaking monster cock towards Melvin&#39;s smaller tool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I going too fast?&quot; Jeff asked with a shit-eating grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hnnngg– Ye–&quot; Melvin moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Jerk me off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trembling, Melvin put both his hands around Jeff&#39;s cock, barely fully reaching around. He stroked the wine-bottle thick cock as his own hips buckled, sensing an orgasm approaching.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m– I–&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff let go of Marvin&#39;s cock, having edged him where he wanted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy. Thanks for warning me.&quot; Jeff moved his slick hand to Melvin&#39;s stomach, spreading the coach&#39;s precum on his belly. He leaned forward, giving a quick peck on Melvin&#39;s forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you sir,&quot; Melvin blushed. &quot; I– I really want to cum now...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know the rules, boy,&quot; Jeff chuckled. &quot;And after that meal, you deserve a treat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melvin bit his lip at the upcoming prospect. He stood up swiftly, pushing the chair he was sitting on away. A thump echoed as it tipped and fell on the floor. Jeff turned his chair around to face Melvin, sitting back down with his legs spread wide open. His hard shaft pointed directly at Melvin, a thick string of precum connecting it directly to the floor, Jeff&#39;s thick foreskin covering most of his blood-swollen cockhead.<br />
<br />
Jeff brought both his hands behind his head, his hairy armpits&#39; musk wafting through the room. He flexed his cock, savoring how Melvin&#39;s stupid gaze followed his fuckstick as it bobbed up and down. And he flexed it again, just to see Melvin&#39;s mouth open up. And again, until Melvin&#39;s tongue hung out. And again, to make the pitiful man salivate until he was drooling over his own chest.<br />
<br />
Two puddles of precum had formed on the ground. A small one under Melvin, barely the width of a ping-pong ball, and a big one under Jeff, the equivalent of a complete football team&#39;s loads of cum. The smell of fresh precum adorned the air, joining itself to the more regular scents of Jeff&#39;s dry sperm and musk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Start with the balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melvin dove face first into the musky, hairy orbs. He lapped the salty balls, kissing and massaging them with vigor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank– You– Sir!&quot; he blurted out between licks. Sniffing Jeff&#39;s ball sweat, he felt himself fall deeper into his embrace. He knew he was lesser than this complete stud, he was lesser than this man who&#39;d helped him escape the path of monotony, the path he was always told was the only correct one. He loved Jeff. He loved the concept of Jeff, the concept of a man so much more man than him that he could put Melvin in his place at any moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy. Get to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melvin wrapped his hands around Jeff&#39;s cock again. Before putting his mouth to the source of Jeff&#39;s tasty pre-cum, Melvin used it as a paintbrush, his face the canvas. Sticky, bitter, salty precum covered his forehead, his cheeks, his chin. Then he started making out with the huge dick. Jeff chuckled as Melvin pleased him. This was his rightful place. Himself on top of every other man.<br />
<br />
Moans escaped from Melvin as he tasted Jeff&#39;s precum. He loved that tartness, that saltiness. But he&#39;d already wasted Jeff&#39;s time enough. He opened his mouth wide open, and forced himself to take it in. Jeff was incredibly girthy, everyone on the team knew that much. Yet, Melvin pushed two inches in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oof– Goo–d boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
He motioned backwards and dove back in, pushing another inch in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmmm, stay there. Savoooor it–&quot;<br />
<br />
He was blessed by Jeff&#39;s precum. He guzzled it, swallowing the sticky substance eagerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deeper.&quot; <br />
<br />
The next inch hit the back of his throat. He felt his gag reflex try to pop out, but he suppressed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Breathe it in.&quot;<br />
<br />
The next two inches pushed the tip of Jeff&#39;s cock into his throat. He practiced his breathing, calmly so he could take it in and avoid choking. He moaned, his throat flexing against the invader.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shoul–dn&#39;t have do–ne that–&quot; Jeff moaned out in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s hands were on Melvin&#39;s head mere seconds later, holding it securely in place. Melvin breathed in deeply, before he accidentally moaned again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck– Alrigh–t, you ask–ed for i–t!&quot;<br />
<br />
Melvin&#39;s throat was just a fleshlight to Jeff from this point on. The oversized fuckstick did what it was meant to do: it fucked. <br />
<br />
With every thrust, Melvin gagged. Melvin choked. Melvin gurgled. His eyes watered and his nose ran. Regardless, Melvin moaned. He knew Jeff was using him, and any movement from his throat would increase Jeff&#39;s pleasure. In that moment, that&#39;s what mattered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, fucking bitch, yeah!&quot; Jeff groaned as he abused Marvin&#39;s mouth. The little bitch wasn&#39;t allowed to cum until he did, and that was fine by him. &quot;Take that, hnnnggg, yeah!&quot; He felt his balls throb, biting his lip as pressure increased within his crotch. &quot;Get– get ready boy– Hmmmmmmmmmghhhh!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s fuckpole throbbed. Melvin knew what that meant. He moved one of his hands to his hard cock, and stroked it quickly. His throat was forced to widen as Jeff&#39;s length pulsed repeatedly, which meant he still had some leeway before cum would shoot out. Jeff had already closed his eyes, his toes curling. He was biting his lip from the pleasure.<br />
<br />
Melvin felt the first shot deep within him. And he felt his first shot outside. Like Jeff was filling him up, he was making a mess on the floor. He shot two, three, four times. It was over within 10 seconds. That was shorter that Jeff&#39;s first shot. He already felt full, but his head was locked in place. The second shot came in, it felt like Jeff was just pissing inside him. He wanted to burp, but he knew he&#39;d have to wait. And the third shot arrived. He started feeling woozy. He knew Jeff came a lot, but damn. And then the fourth. And the fifth.<br />
<br />
By this point, Melvin&#39;s insides were basically half cum. Jeff exhaled a sharp breath as he opened his eyes, still anchoring Melvin to his cock. He let go of his grip on the coach&#39;s head, who slowly pulled himself off the softening monster.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do we say?&quot; Jeff teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Th– thank you, sir,&quot; Melvin answered before burping loudly. &quot;You&#39;re always an experience, y&#39;know that?&quot; Melvin stood up, shaking from the brutal skullfucking he&#39;d just received.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I know.&quot; Jeff stood up slowly, before leaning towards Melvin&#39;s face. &quot;That&#39;s what my boys say.&quot; He placed a hand on Melvin&#39;s neck, before kissing him. &quot;Now clean this up, I&#39;m gonna dress up and head out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melvin blushed, his spent dick throbbing slightly, &quot;Yes sonny.&quot;</p>
