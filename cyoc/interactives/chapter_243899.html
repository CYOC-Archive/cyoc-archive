<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(author&#39;s note: sorry this was so long. I just got very passionate about it.)<br />
<br />
They decided to throw the party, hoping the increased number of people might bring more information. Rachel had sent out invitations a few days ago, and the word was spreading like wildfire. He was Rachel, the cool girl with the house big enough to throw a party in. He had transformed the party preparations into his brother&#39;s and mate&#39;s. Rachel had always loved parties, but now, as Riven, the were-bear, he saw it as a necessity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, this party will have two steps. First is information, any news about Mei or a bear where they aren&#39;t supposed to be will be given back to me&quot; riven then closed his eyes. &quot;if no information about Mei is found or she is in danger then we recruit as many of the humans as we can then head out&quot; Rachel said, his mind racing with the gravity of their situation. Bea and Jake nodded in agreement, their human fears momentarily forgotten in the face of the pack&#39;s urgency.<br />
<br />
Sam raised his hand tentatively. &quot;I know a few people who might have seen something. I&#39;ll spread the word discreetly,&quot; he offered, his eyes darting between them. Rachel nodded, his human mind appreciating Sam&#39;s tact. &quot;Good, we need all the intel we can get without raising suspicion,&quot; Rachael said, his voice a mix of authority and gratitude.<br />
<br />
The four werebears got the house looking ready for the party in no time. Then Sam pointed out that not everyone would be impressed by their exposed junk. Luckily for Riven, Mei has been through a lot of boyfriends, including one who tried to make a clothing business. It fell through when he accidentally ordered them all too large.<br />
<br />
It was partially why Mei was rooming with Riven, as they lost their house and broke up. The good thing was that there were still some sweatpants for him, Sam, Jake, and Bea. Rachael&#39;s human mind was quick to realize that they needed to maintain a human facade for the party. &quot;We&#39;ll need clothes,&quot; Rachel said. The others nodded. It was a struggle to put the pants on. While the material was very stretchy, their claws cut several holes. Rachael felt ridiculous in his over sized sweatpants, the waistband barely holding his massive frame in place. But it was a necessary disguise for their mission.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Mei had been using the material from the shirts to make face masks. Rachel felt a twinge of sadness for his friend&#39;s lost dreams, but they had to focus on the task at hand. &quot;We need more people to search for Mei, and this will be the perfect way to get them involved without scaring them off,&quot; Rachel said. Bea nodded in agreement, her new fur brushing against the couch as she sat down.<br />
<br />
To help with her breasts, they had wrapped them with bandages to flatten them. Rachel felt a bit self-conscious but knew it was necessary. Rachel looked at Sam and Jake, the three guys couldn&#39;t find anything to cover their torsos, so Rachel had to come up with a plan B. They had to look as human as possible without arousing suspicion. Rachel went to Mei&#39;s room and dug through her closet, finding a few over sized hoodies that she hoped would cover their fur-covered chests. With a bit of maneuvering, they put the hoodies on, the fabric stretching to accommodate their bulky forms.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Riven&#39;s body was larger, so when he tried the sweatshirt, it looked like a child&#39;s plaything. Riven lifted his arm to take the tight thing off, only for it to rip. Rachel sighed and turned to Bea, &quot;Guess I&#39;m going bare-chested.&quot; The others snickered, and Rachel felt a bit embarrassed but knew it was for the greater good. Rachel looked in the mirror and flexed his biceps, watching them bulge with power. He had never felt more masculine. Rachel had never felt more alive.<br />
<br />
He patted his fat, muscle gut and smiled as he tore off the ruined shirt. A knock on the front door alerted them that the party guests had arrived. Rachel took a deep breath, trying to calm the bear inside of him that wanted to roar in excitement and greet the crowd. Instead, he composed himself and opened the door with a smile.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, everyone bought that he and the others were wearing highly realistic bear costumes. A few even asked where they could get one for themselves. Rachael&#39;s heart raced as the party goers filed in, the smells of cologne and perfume mixing with the underlying scent of excitement. They had to be careful not to let their true nature show, but Rachael couldn&#39;t help but feel a thrill at the power that surged through him.<br />
<br />
The split up into different rooms. Hopefully, someone had heard about Mei or an unusual bear sighting. Rachael took a deep breath, his heightened senses picking up on the pulse of the party. He could feel the vibrations of the bass from the music in his chest, and the laughter was almost tangible in the air. He knew that he had to be cautious, that the humans couldn&#39;t know their true nature. But the thrill of the hunt was in his blood now.<br />
<br />
The party was in full swing, and Rachael found himself in the living room, chatting up a group of college guys. His deep, rumbling laughter and casual gestures made it easy to blend in, despite his towering frame and furry paws. He subtly steered the conversation towards recent events, dropping hints about a wild party animal they might have encountered. The guys exchanged glances, and Rachael felt hope—perhaps they had information.<br />
<br />
Bea, now fully embracing her new form, flitted from group to group, her human-like grace surprisingly intact. Her newfound curves and animal allure had the humans eating out of her hand—or paw, in this case. Rachael watched her, feeling a strange mix of pride and protectiveness. She was doing well, playing the part of the seductive hostess while keeping an eye out for any signs of Mei. Rachael knew she had the instincts of a predator now, too, and he was grateful for her sharp senses.<br />
<br />
Jake and Sam had taken to the kitchen, their smaller forms allowing them to move more freely among the party goers. They listened intently to the gossip and whispers, their sharp ears picking up any mention of strange occurrences or missing people. Rachael had briefed them on what to listen for—anything that might lead them to Mei. The pack had to stick together, especially when one of their own was lost.<br />
<br />
As the night went on, Rachael&#39;s hope began to wane. Despite the party&#39;s success and the influx of information, there was still no sign of Mei. Rachael felt a twinge of frustration, his bear instincts telling him to push harder, to do more. But he knew that patience was key. He had to trust in his pack, in their ability to find her without revealing their secrets. He took a moment to survey the room, watching Bea flirt with a group of girls and Jake and Sam deep in conversation with a couple of guys. They were all playing their parts perfectly, and Rachael felt a swell of pride.<br />
<br />
The party was their best chance to find Mei. To bring her back before she did any more harm. Rachael knew that time was running out, that each moment she was stuck in a cursed werebear form was another moment she could get killed. Rachael couldn&#39;t bear the thought of losing her like that, not after what they had been through together. The house was packed with people, all blissfully unaware of the furry truth hiding beneath their bandages and oversize clothes.<br />
<br />
Bea, Rachael noticed, was flitting around the room, her newfound feminine grace surprising even him. She was a natural, playing the part of a shy and slightly overwhelmed girl at her first college party. Rachael felt a strange mix of pride and jealousy. Pride because she was handling herself so well, jealousy because she had a part of him that he had lost in his transformation. Rachael watched her from the shadows, his eyes drawn to her full hips and the way she moved. She was a creature of beauty and power, and Rachael knew could be an asset to their pack.<br />
<br />
Sam and Jake, on the other hand, were playing the typical college bros, tossing a football around and making crude jokes. Rachael had to admit, it was a good cover. They had the height and build to pull it off, and their animal instincts made them surprisingly good at mimicking human behavior. Rachael felt a twinge of something in his chest, something that was not his heart. It was his cock, reminding him of the hunger that never truly went away.<br />
<br />
But Rachael pushed those thoughts aside as the party grew wilder. The music was loud, the lights were low, and people were getting drunker by the minute. It was the perfect setting for their plan. Rachael knew they needed more people to search for Mei, to keep an eye on the town, and maybe even to teach her how to control her new form. He looked around the room, searching for potential candidates. His gaze landed on a group of girls huddled in the corner, whispering and glancing at him and his pack. They were curious, and Rachael knew could be a powerful tool.<br />
<br />
With a deep breath, Rachael made his move. He approached the group, his towering figure cutting through the crowd like a knife. They looked up at him with fear and excitement, their eyes lingering on his broad chest. &quot;Hey, I&#39;m Riven,&quot; he said, his deep voice rumbling like distant thunder. &quot;You girls want to see something cool?&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls nodded eagerly, and Rachael led them into the backyard. The night air was crisp, and Rachael could smell the fear and excitement on them. He knew that scent all too well. It was the scent of prey. But tonight, he had to be the hunter with a different purpose. He had to bring these girls into their fold to help them find their lost friend.<br />
<br />
Once they were far from the house, Rachael put his plan into action. He turned to the group of girls, his eyes glowing with a gentle, persuasive light. &quot;You see, we have a... problem. And we need your help,&quot; Rachael began, his deep voice carrying an air of authority despite the playfulness of his words.<br />
<br />
The girls leaned in, their eyes wide with curiosity. Rachael knew he had to tread carefully—these were humans, not members of his pack. He couldn&#39;t just demand their loyalty. Instead, he had to make them want to be a part of this. &quot;We&#39;re looking for someone,&quot; Rachael continued, &quot;a very special person. We think she might have gone through something like we did. And we need your help to find her.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls exchanged glances, their interest piqued. Rachael took a step closer, his fur brushing against their legs. &quot;We can give you something in return,&quot; he said, his voice dropping to a whisper. &quot;Something that will make you feel... incredible. Powerful. Like you can do anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Riven pulled down his pants to reveal his hard cock, which was already erect and dripping with pre-cum. The girls gasped, and Rachael felt a mix of excitement and anxiety. He knew he had to be careful—these humans didn&#39;t understand what was happening. He had to make it seem natural, like it was part of the party.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, we have this... game,&quot; Rachael began, his voice still deep and rumbling, but with a hint of mischief. &quot;A drop from it will give you what you want,&quot; he grinned as one of the girls approached. He knew Courtney in high school. She&#39;d bang any guy she could. Rachael knew she&#39;d be perfect. He took a deep breath and hoped she wouldn&#39;t be his type. Rachael knew he had to be careful—his bear instincts were strong, and he didn&#39;t want to claim her without her consent.<br />
<br />
With a low growl that sounded almost seductive, Rachael leaned in and whispered to Courtney, &quot;Do you want to feel something truly powerful?&quot; She nodded, her eyes wide with anticipation. Rachael carefully guided her hand to his cock, watching as she gripped it firmly. &quot;Taste,&quot; he urged, and she did, licking the precum from her palm. Rachael&#39;s heart pounded in his chest—this was it. He had to be sure she was willing.<br />
<br />
Courtney&#39;s eyes flashed with confusion and desire as she swallowed. Rachael felt the transformation begin—her body grew taller, her features more defined. The fur began to sprout, and Rachael could see the beginnings of her new bear form. &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?&quot; she gasped, but Rachael just smiled, his teeth elongating into sharp canines.<br />
<br />
Courtney&#39;s transformation was rapid, her body stretching and contorting before their eyes. Her clothes ripped and tore away, unable to contain the new muscles that bulged forth. Rachael watched with pride and hunger as her body morphed into that of a strong, handsome young man. The fur grew in thick, luscious waves, a stark contrast to the smooth skin she had once known. Her face elongated slightly, the muzzle of a bear emerging. Rachael&#39;s heart pounded as he watched her, feeling a strange kinship with the new were-bear.<br />
<br />
Her breasts receded into her body, and Rachael noticed the beginnings of a cock forming between her legs. It grew longer and thicker, pulsing with the same primal energy that coursed through Rachael&#39;s veins. Courtney&#39;s eyes widened with fear and excitement, her pupils dilating as she took her new form. Rachael stepped closer, placing a furry hand on her shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; he murmured, trying to soothe her. &quot;You&#39;re going to be okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Courtney&#39;s legs grew stronger, her feet changing into large, padded paws with sharp claws. She took a tentative step forward, her new form surprisingly stable. Rachael watched with awe and pride—she was becoming one of them. The fur on her body grew denser, her human features morphing into those of a powerful were-bear. Her nose elongated into a snout, and her teeth grew sharp and pointed. Rachael could see the muscles rippling beneath her fur, and he knew she would be a formidable member of the pack.<br />
<br />
Courtney&#39;s transformation was not without its moments of discomfort. Her bones cracked and popped as they realigned into a more animalistic form. Rachael winced at the sound, his bear instincts telling him that pain was a necessary part of growth. But Courtney&#39;s expression was one of wonder and excitement. She reached down, her furry paw tracing the contours of her new cock, a smile playing on her lips. Rachael could see the desire in her eyes—she liked what she saw.<br />
<br />
The fur on Courtney&#39;s body grew thicker, the color a rich, chocolate brown that matched her eyes. Her shoulders broadened, and her arms grew stronger. Rachael watched as Courtney flexed her new muscles, amazed at the power she now wielded. She took another step, her new paws landing firmly on the ground. Rachael saw the confidence in her stance, the way she held herself with authority. It was clear she was going to enjoy being a were-bear.<br />
<br />
Courtney&#39;s eyes lit up as she felt the changes between her legs. Rachael watched as she reached down with a furry paw and gripped her growing cock, her human hand now replaced by a bear&#39;s. She stroked it gently, marveling at its size and the sensitivity of her new body. Her balls dropped, heavy and full, swinging slightly with every step she took. Rachael felt his cock throb in response, his animal instincts telling him that soon Courtney will be his brother.<br />
<br />
He then grips it harder, feeling the power in his new form. Rachael could see the pleasure on Courtney&#39;s face as he stroked herself, his eyes glazed over with desire.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does it feel?&quot; Rachael asked, his voice filled with curiosity and a hint of envy. Courtney looked up at him, a wolfish grin spreading across her face. &quot;It feels...amazing,&quot; she managed to get out between gasps. Rachael watched as Courtney&#39;s body continued to shift, her hips narrowing and her cock growing thicker and longer. Her hand moved in a slow, deliberate rhythm, pumping the length of her new member.<br />
<br />
&quot;What shall we call you now?&quot; Rachael prompted gently, his eyes never leaving Courtney&#39;s face. She thought for a moment, her cheeks flushing with the excitement of rebirth. &quot;Conner,&quot; she murmured, her voice deepening slightly. &quot;Conner the Were-Bear.&quot; Rachael nodded, a smile tugging at the corners of his muzzle. &quot;Welcome, Conner,&quot; he said, his voice rumbling with warmth.<br />
<br />
Conner&#39;s hand didn&#39;t stop moving, his grip tightening around his cock as it grew to its full length. Rachael could see the veins pulsing beneath the fur, the shaft growing redder with each stroke. His breathing grew ragged as the transformation reached its peak. finnaly the mans pussy closed up and his testicles dropped into a furry sack between his legs. Riven stepped aside as Conner let out a roar of pleasure. His cock pulsed as he came, his semen spurting onto the grass in thick, creamy ropes. Riven smiled and offered his hand to Conner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the pack, Conner,&quot; Rachael said warmly, his fur ruffling in the cool breeze. The transformation complete, Rachael watched as Conner took in the sensation of his new body. The former Courtney looked down at himself, a grin spreading across his muzzle. Rachael knew that becoming a were-bear was a gift and a burden, and he was happy that Conner seemed to be embracing the change with enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
Once they embraced in a hug, Riven approached Connor&#39;s two stunned friends. Sarah and Ally were so stunned at the sight of Conner, their former friend, now a giant furry creature, that they didn&#39;t know how to react. Rachael could see the fear in their eyes, but he knew he had to maintain control. He stepped forward, his massive paws landing heavily on the ground. &quot;Sarah, Ally, I know this is a shock, but I need your help.&quot; His voice was a mix of Rachael&#39;s softness and the deep rumble of a bear&#39;s growl.<br />
<br />
Conner put his hand on Riven&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Let me do this, please,&quot; Rachael nodded. Conner walked up to Ally and Sarah with a gentle swagger that was surprisingly alluring for a creature of his size. &quot;Guys, I know this is crazy, but I need you to trust me.&quot; His voice had a new depth to it, one that seemed to resonate within their very souls.<br />
<br />
They stared at him, wide-eyed and trembling. Rachael could see the fear in their eyes, but also something else. Curiosity. &quot;What do you want from us?&quot; Ally asked, her voice shaking.<br />
<br />
Conner took a deep breath, his fur ruffling. &quot;We need your help. And in return, I can offer you something... incredible.&quot; Rachael watched as the girls exchanged glances, their expressions a mix of terror and fascination. &quot;We want to make you like us,&quot; he continued, his voice a low rumble that seemed to echo in the room. &quot;You&#39;d be part of the pack, stronger, more powerful than you ever imagined.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ally&#39;s eyes narrowed, her hand unconsciously reaching to her neck where the necklace with the bear charm lay. Rachael could see the wheels turning in her head, the curiosity fighting the fear. &quot;What&#39;s in it for you?&quot; she asked, her voice steady despite the tremble in her hand.<br />
<br />
Conner leaned closer, his breath hot against their faces. &quot;Protection,&quot; he murmured, his eyes locking onto Ally&#39;s. &quot;Companionship. The power of the pack.&quot; Rachael watched as Ally&#39;s expression softened, the fear slowly giving way to something... more. &quot;We&#39;re not monsters,&quot; he assured them. &quot;We&#39;re just... different. And we need each other to survive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah looked at Ally, then back at Conner. &quot;What do we have to do?&quot; she asked, her voice a mere whisper. Rachael knew that the scent of their fear was tantalizing, but the scent of their curiosity was even stronger. The decision was theirs, and Rachael would respect it, no matter the outcome.<br />
<br />
Conner&#39;s cock grew hard as he explained what they needed to do next. He couldn&#39;t help the excitement that surged through him at the thought of bringing more people into their world, especially these two. Rachael watched as Ally and Sarah exchanged a look, their expressions a mix of terror and fascination. The were-bear within Rachael recognized the desire in their eyes, the same that had driven Rachael to seek out this life-altering transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll need to drink from the same source that changed us,&quot; Conner told them, his eyes gleaming with excitement. &quot;It&#39;s the least painful way, and the quickest.&quot; Rachael nodded in agreement, his paws clenching and unclenching with anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Ally finally said, her voice shaky but determined. Rachael could see the resolve in her eyes, the unspoken promise that she would do anything to protect those she cared about. &quot;We&#39;ll do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Rachael and Conner shared a knowing glance. Rachael stepped back, allowing Conner to take the lead. He dropped to all fours, his cock swelling with anticipation. The transformation process was intimate, and Rachael knew girls would have to trust them completely.<br />
<br />
Ally, the one with the bear charm necklace, approached Conner first. She knelt before him, her eyes locked on his twitching cock. Rachael watched with excitement and trepidation as the transformation was about to begin. Ally put her lips to its head, and Rachael felt a strange kinship as he remembered his first kiss of the elixir. Conner&#39;s cock filled her mouth, and she sucked him eagerly, her eyes never leaving his. Rachael could feel the power building in the room, the air crackling with the energy of the shift.<br />
<br />
Ally&#39;s body began to change as soon as she swallowed his cum. Conner sat on his rear and watched with excitement and pride as the girl he had just met began to shift into something more powerful. Rachael could see the awe in her eyes as she felt her body bulge and reshape itself into something more than human. Her clothes ripped away as fur sprouted from her skin, muscles rippling and growing with every suck. Rachael watched as Ally&#39;s form grew more masculine, her breasts flattening and her hips widening into a powerful, more bear-like stance. Her hands and feet elongated into clawed paws, and Rachael felt a thrill run through his fur at the sight of it.<br />
<br />
Ally&#39;s transformation was a mesmerizing spectacle, her body contorting and expanding with a primal force. Her hips widened dramatically, the flesh and bone moving as if sculpted by an invisible hand. Rachael felt a strange mix of excitement and apprehension as Ally&#39;s feminine form morphed into a powerful, male were-bear. The fur grew denser and darker, covering her now muscular body as her breasts disappeared and her shoulders broadened. Rachael watched with a keen eye, seeing the transformation play out in a way he hadn&#39;t expected—his creation becoming a creature of strength and dominance.<br />
<br />
Rachael could see the hunger in his eyes as Ally&#39;s pussy receded, replaced by a swelling cock that grew with each pulse of his new heart. Her legs grew thick and powerful, the muscles rippling as she experimentally flexed her new paws. Rachael stepped back, giving the new male were-bear space as he took in his transformed body with a mix of shock and excitement.<br />
<br />
Ally looked down at himself, watching as his testicles dropped into their fur-covered sack with a soft plop. His hand, now a furry paw, reached down to cup the sensitive orbs, a look of wonder crossing his face. Rachael recognized the sensation—his transformation had been equally as mind-boggling. He watched as Ally began to stroke his cock, the motion almost mechanical at first as he figured out his new body&#39;s capabilities. Rachael&#39;s cock twitched in response, the sight of a fellow were-bear discovering his power stirring his instincts.<br />
<br />
With each stroke, Ally&#39;s cock grew larger and harder, the fur around his groin standing on end with excitement. Rachael felt his bear instincts roaring within him, eager to claim a new pack member. He took a step closer, his breathing heavy as he watched the transformation unfold before him. Ally&#39;s body grew more muscular, his chest broadening and his shoulders squaring. Rachael could see the power in the new were-bear, the potential for a fierce warrior.<br />
<br />
As Ally touched himself, Rachael noticed his fur thickening, the soft brown giving way to a rich, deep color. &quot;What color is it?&quot; Ally asked, his voice now deeper and gruffer. Rachael stepped closer, his nose twitching as he took in the scent of the new male&#39;s arousal. &quot;It&#39;s a beautiful shade of amber,&quot; Rachael rumbled, his eyes gleaming with approval. &quot;It suits you perfectly.&quot;<br />
<br />
The transformation grew more intense as Ally stroked himself faster, his cock now fully engorged. Rachael watched as Ally&#39;s body grew more masculine, his breasts receding into his furry chest, his hips narrowing, and his thighs thickening. The sound of his fur brushing against the floor as he moved was mesmerizing. Rachael felt his own cock throb in response, the sight of such raw power and change a potent aphrodisiac.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; Ally gasped, his voice cracking as he felt his body contort and shift. Rachael leaned down, his breath warm on Ally&#39;s cheek. &quot;You&#39;re becoming one of us,&quot; Rachael murmured, his desire evident in his tone. &quot;Embrace it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fur grew denser, the transformation accelerating as Ally&#39;s hand worked his cock with increasing fervor. Rachael watched in amazement as Ally&#39;s features began to morph—his nose elongating into a snout, his teeth growing sharp and pointed, and his eyes taking on a fiery golden glow. The transformation was complete when Ally roared in pleasure, his cum spurting across the ground in thick, white ropes.<br />
<br />
Panting and exhausted, Ally looked down at his new body, his hand still wrapped around his now fully transformed male organ. He flexed his new, powerful limbs, feeling the strength and virility that surged through him. Rachael saw the wonder in Ally&#39;s eyes, but also the beginnings of acceptance. &quot;What do I do now?&quot; he rumbled, his voice a mix of confusion and excitement.<br />
<br />
Rachael stepped forward, his cock still erect and leaking from the intense experience. &quot;You choose your new name, as is the tradition of our kind.&quot; Ally took a moment to consider this, his mind racing with the implications. Rachael watched as Ally&#39;s hand moved to stroke his new fur, feeling the softness and strength in every inch of his new form.<br />
<br />
Finally, with a smirk that was more canine than human, Ally said, &quot;I am... Axel.&quot; The name rolled off his tongue with a newfound confidence that resonated through the room. Rachael felt a surge of pride—his pack was growing, and each new member brought a unique strength to their bond.<br />
<br />
Now it was Sarah&#39;s turn, Rachael could sense her nerves. he knew that soon he would gain another brother. Rachael watched as she approached the two eager werebears, her eyes flitting between their erect cocks. Alex&#39;s was large and veiny, a deep brown color that matched his fur, while Conner&#39;s was slightly smaller, but no less impressive, with a slightly paler hue. Rachael&#39;s cock twitched at the sight, the pheromones in the air making his fur stand on end.<br />
<br />
Sarah licked her lips, her human mind struggling to comprehend the decision she was about to make. The scent of the two male were-bears filled her nostrils, making her head swim with desire. Rachael watched her with a knowing smile, his arousal clear in his posture.<br />
<br />
With a deep breath, Sarah reached out and took hold of Alex&#39;s thick, brown cock. It was hot and heavy in her hand, pulsing with the beat of his heart. She stroked it gently, feeling the veins throb beneath her fingertips. Alex groaned, his fur ruffling with pleasure. she decided that she wanted one that hadn&#39;t been sucked on yet.<br />
<br />
She looked into Alex&#39;s eyes, his bear necklace snug around his neck, and whispered, &quot;Take me.&quot; Rachael watched as Alex&#39;s eyes grew dark with hunger, his cock swelling even more in her hand. He leaned in, his teeth elongating slightly, and Rachael knew what was about to happen. He had seen the look in a male&#39;s eyes before—the need to claim, to dominate, to fill.<br />
<br />
She dropped her panties and leaned over a rock. Her anus clear for him to see, begging to be filled. Alex&#39;s eyes glazed over with need, and Rachael knew that the human part of him was lost to the animal within. Rachael stepped aside, giving Alex the space to initiate her into the pack.<br />
<br />
Alex approached her, his cock bobbing in front of him. Rachael watched as he positioned himself behind her, his furry hands gripping her hips tightly. He paused for a moment, savoring the moment before he thrust into her tight, human ass. Rachael could feel the tension in the air, the anticipation of the coming change.<br />
<br />
Sarah&#39;s gasp was muffled by the rock she was leaning against, her eyes squeezed shut as Alex&#39;s cock stretched and filled her. Rachael felt a strange kinship with her, a shared understanding of what it meant to become something more than human. The sound of fur against flesh filled the sky, the rhythm of their coupling growing faster and more intense.<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s grunts grew louder, and Rachael knew he was close. The anticipation was almost unbearable—the moment of transformation was always explosive. Rachael&#39;s cock ached in his human clothes, the pressure building as he watched his new pack mate claim his first human. The smell of sex and change was intoxicating, making Rachael&#39;s bear instincts stir restlessly beneath his skin.<br />
<br />
A wet spot grew at the tip of his bulge. Rachael watched as Sarah&#39;s body began to shift, her form becoming more masculine, her breasts flattening, and fur sprouting from her skin. Her eyes glowed with a mix of pleasure and terror as Alex&#39;s cock swelled even more, filling her. Conner was getting hard too from the sight, Rachael could feel it in the air.<br />
<br />
With a roar that seemed to shake the very earth, Alex climaxed, his seed spilling into Sarah&#39;s body. Rachael could see the transformation happening in real-time, her human form morphing into that of a were-bear. Her bones cracked and shifted, her body elongating and growing in size. Rachael&#39;s heart raced as he watched the power of the transformation unfold.<br />
<br />
Alex pulled out but Sarah stayed put, the rock pressing against her now-exposed clit, sending shock waves of pleasure through her body. Rachael watched as her skin began to change, fur sprouting in a mesmerizing pattern that started at her core and spread outwards like wildfire. Her body grew, muscles bulging and face elongating into a snarling muzzle. Rachael couldn&#39;t help but feel a mix of pride and arousal as he watched his friend become one of them.<br />
<br />
She rubbed against it, the pleasure building to unbearable levels. Rachael watched in amazement as Sarah&#39;s body grew and shifted, her clothes tearing away as fur sprouted from her skin. Her breasts shrank rapidly, her hips narrowing and a cock grew in their place, trapped between the rock and his body.<br />
<br />
Sarah&#39;s body convulsed as the were-bear curse took hold, the rock beneath her now a prison of pleasure that he kept his cock pressed against. Its tip grew past the rock&#39;s top, leaking precum, as he felt his claws dig deeper into the stone.<br />
<br />
The fur grew in thick and fast, a rich chestnut color that matched Rachael&#39;s eyes. His body structure shifted, broadening his shoulders and thickening his thighs, creating a powerful, masculine frame. Riven watched, his cock growing hard at the sight, as the transformation continued to claim Sarah&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Sarah&#39;s moans grew deeper, her voice dropping an octave as the fur covered her face and her features began to shift. Her eyes went from a soft brown to a piercing gold, the same color as Riven and Bea&#39;s. Riven felt a strange kinship with the creature she was becoming, a kinship that went beyond friendship or even lust. It was the bond of pack, the bond of shared blood and fur.<br />
<br />
Her hips bucked against the rock, cracks forming from where his cock and palms touched. Each time he rubbed against it, they spread wider, threatening to break the stone.<br />
<br />
Her breasts flattened and receded, giving way to a firm, muscular chest that heaved with each breath. The fur grew denser, the chestnut hue darkening to a rich mahogany as it crept down her torso, her skin stretching and reshaping to accommodate her new form. Rachael watched with bated breath, his cock pulsing in time with hers.<br />
<br />
The rock broke beneath him. as he felt the unfamiliar weight of his cock thicken and swell between his legs.  He roared with pleasure, his voice echoing through the night as he felt his balls drop, heavy and full. Rachael watched in amazement as the transformation reached its climax, the fur growing in thick patches down Sarah&#39;s now male body, her legs stretching and reshaping into powerful haunches.<br />
<br />
Sarah&#39;s eyes rolled back in ecstasy, and Rachael knew the moment was approaching. He felt the tension in the air as the power of the moon surged through her, rewriting her very essence. Rachael leaned in, whispering, &quot;Choose your name, your true name.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her body spasmed as she reached her peak, and with a final, powerful thrust, she let out a roar that seemed to shake the very earth beneath them. The rock beneath her shuddered and cracked, the pressure of her transformation too much to bear. Rachael watched as Sarah&#39;s cock grew before his eyes, thick and long, a testament to the power of the were-bear within her. Her climax washed over her in waves, the fur on her body thickening, her muscles bulging and shifting, her very bones realigning.<br />
<br />
Sarah felt his cock pulse as he cums across the crumbling rock, &quot;my name is Seth!&quot; he roared. Rachael felt a surge of pride as he watched the final stages of Seth&#39;s transformation unfold. Seth&#39;s body was now fully that of a powerful male were-bear, his fur a rich brown that matched the earth they stood upon. Rachael knew that with each new member, their pack grew stronger, and the bond between them grew deeper.<br />
<br />
With a nod of respect, Seth and Rachael turned to Axel and Conner. &quot;Thank you, Alpha,&quot; they said in unison, their voices a mix of awe and excitement. Rachael felt a warmth spread through him—his pack recognized him as their leader, and they were willing to follow him into the unknown.<br />
<br />
The four of them made their way back to the house, their heavy footsteps echoing through the night. The party was in full swing, music and laughter spilling into the quiet neighborhood. Rachael&#39;s heart raced as they approached the house, his fur bristling with excitement and anticipation. They had to find Mei, and he hoped she would be drawn to the gathering like a moth to a flame.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to split up,&quot; Riven instructed his pack, his deep, commanding voice resonating with the authority of their new alpha. &quot;We have to have the numbers to confront Mei without hurting her, but to do that, we must grow our pack. Remember, we seek new members willing to embrace their inner bears.&quot;<br />
<br />
Axel, Seth, and Conner nodded and split into the party, each scanning the room for potential recruits. Rachael, now known as Riven, watched them go with a mix of pride and concern. He knew humanity was still a part of them, and the temptation to take what they wanted might be too great. But he had faith in their ability to control their instincts and find willing participants.<br />
<br />
Riven took a deep breath, his nose twitching as he took in the smell of fear, excitement, and lust that filled the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember,&quot; Riven called out to Axel and Conner as they disappeared into the throng of party goers, &quot;we need willing recruits. Be gentle, be charming. Let them choose to become a part of us.&quot; His voice was a low rumble that carried through the house, leaving no doubt that he was in charge.<br />
<br />
Riven padded back into the living room, his fur brushing against the furniture as he moved. He could smell the fear and excitement of the humans, the sweet scent of their arousal mingling with the smell of spilled drinks and sweat. His nostrils flared as he picked up the trail of his pack members. Jake was easy to find; his scent was like a comforting blanket of musk. Bea&#39;s was a more complex bouquet of fur and feminine scents, hinting at the powerful she-bear she had become. Sam&#39;s smell was more elusive, but Riven&#39;s heightened senses had no trouble tracking his smaller pack member&#39;s movements.<br />
<br />
Jake was in the kitchen, his bear form surprisingly adept at maneuvering the human appliances. Riven watched as his friend rummaged through the fridge. He then pulled out some party snacks and placed them on the counter. He then walked to where Bea was, who was in the living room, her fur ruffled with excitement. She was talking to a group of jocks who were eyeing her with a deep desire. Rachael could smell the pheromones in the air, thick with the scent of potential new members to the pack.<br />
<br />
Finally, he tracked down Sam&#39;s scent to the backyard, where he had decided to take a break from the festivities. Rachael found him leaning against the fence, his fur glistening with the dew of the night. He looked up as Rachael approached, his eyes reflecting the distant street lights. &quot;What&#39;s up, Riven?&quot; Sam asked casually, his tone hinting at the ease he felt in his new form.<br />
<br />
Looking down he saw Riven lack of cloths and his cock was already growing hard as it swung between his powerful legs. Rachael had to admit that being so exposed and primal was exhilarating. He was no longer Rachael, the shy college student, but Riven, the mighty Alpha of a growing were-bear pack. He felt his bear instincts surge, his cock pulsing with each step he took.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just hope this party works in our favor,&quot; he said as he turned around and leaned on the fence.<br />
<br />
Riven nodded, his fur brushing against the wood as he did so. &quot;It will,&quot; he said with confidence, his deep voice rumbling through the night. &quot;The scent of fear and excitement is ripe. It&#39;s like a buffet for us.&quot; His eyes scanned the party goers through the kitchen window, watching them dance and laugh, oblivious to the predators in their midst. &quot;But we must be careful,&quot; he added, his expression growing serious. &quot;We don&#39;t want to cause a scene.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam chuckled, his tail swishing from side to side. &quot;Yeah, I know. But it&#39;s so hard not to just... let go.&quot; He reached down and gave his cock a gentle squeeze, his eyes closing briefly as he enjoyed the sensation. Rachael felt his cock twitch in response, a reminder of the primal desires that now ruled their bodies. They were stuck in their were-bear forms until morning, and the urges that came with them were almost too much to handle.<br />
<br />
Riven leaned against the fence some more, his fur bristling slightly as he watched the party from the shadows of the backyard. The college students were getting rowdy, their laughter and shouts carried on the night air. It was a stark contrast to the serious conversation he and Sam had just had about the nature of their existence. &quot;It&#39;s strange,&quot; Rachael said, his voice a deep rumble that was now as much a part of him as his fur and claws. &quot;Being a were-bear, I mean. Having a cock and everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam looked at him, his cock still semi-hard from their earlier discussion. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s pretty wild,&quot; he said, a smirk playing across his lips. &quot;But I&#39;ve got to admit, it feels pretty good.&quot; He gave his cock another squeeze, and Rachael felt a twinge of envy. Rachael had been a girl before this transformation, and the feeling of having a cock was still new and strange to him. He hadn&#39;t had the chance to explore it fully, but the way the other bears talked about it made his cock throb with curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like we&#39;re two different people,&quot; Rachael mused, his paws flexing as he tried to get used to the new sensations. &quot;One minute we&#39;re just Rachel and Sammy, hanging out, and the next we&#39;re these... these monsters with cocks and a lust for sex and meat.&quot; He chuckled, his bear form rumbling with the sound. It was surreal, but somehow, it felt right. Rachael had always felt like an outsider, but as a were-bear, he had found his place.<br />
<br />
Sam nodded, his eyes gleaming with mischief. &quot;It&#39;s like the ultimate bro-bonding experience, right?&quot; he said, slapping Rachael on the back with a fur-covered hand. &quot;We&#39;re not just friends anymore, we&#39;re pack brothers.&quot; Rachael felt a warmth spread through his chest, a strange mix of human camaraderie and animal kinship. He had never felt so connected to anyone before, not even Mei.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s weird,&quot; Rachael said, his voice still a mix of Rachel&#39;s softness and the deep rumble of his were-bear form. &quot;We&#39;re guys now, with cocks and everything.&quot; He looked down at his erection, feeling a sense of wonder. &quot;I never thought I&#39;d say that.&quot; Sam laughed, his fur ruffling. &quot;Yeah, I know what you mean. But it&#39;s also kind of hot.&quot; Rachael felt his cheeks heat up, his human side blushing at the admission.<br />
<br />
They both turned to look at Bea, who was currently entertaining a group of college guys. Rachael felt his cock throb at the sight of her, her new body powerful and alluring. But it wasn&#39;t just lust—there was something more. Something...familial. &quot;Yeah,&quot; Sam agreed. &quot;It&#39;s like we&#39;re brothers now. But with Bea...it&#39;s complicated.&quot; Rachael knew what he meant. Bea was now part of their pack, and while Rachael couldn&#39;t deny the attraction he felt for her, it was different than the primal urge to claim her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Riven said, his voice a mix of Rachel&#39;s sweetness and the gruffness of his new form. &quot;We&#39;re all connected, but it&#39;s not just about mating. It&#39;s about protecting each other, about being a family.&quot; Sam nodded, his eyes lingering on Bea&#39;s curvy figure as she moved among the party goers. Rachael felt a twinge of something—not quite jealousy, but a protective instinct. &quot;We need to make sure she knows she&#39;s safe with us,&quot; Rachael said firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s hard not to want to just...&quot; Sam trailed off, his erection obvious through his sweatpants. Rachael knew exactly what he meant. The scent of Bea&#39;s arousal was thick in the air, and their cocks throbbed in time with her laughter. &quot;We&#39;re mates now,&quot; Rachael said, his voice low and intense. &quot;But we need to treat her like a pack member, not just a conquest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Sam said, his eyes still on Bea. &quot;It&#39;s just...&quot; He took a deep breath, his chest heaving. &quot;It feels so good, Rachael. To cum like this. To have a cock. To be a man.&quot; Rachael nodded, feeling the same thrill. &quot;It&#39;s like we&#39;ve been given a second chance,&quot; he murmured. &quot;To live a life we never knew we wanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them stood there for a moment, their cocks still hard and their bodies buzzing with the aftermath of their conversation. Rachael felt a strange kinship with Sam, one that went beyond their shared experience as were-bears. They were brothers now, in a way they never could have been before. &quot;We should take a break,&quot; Rachael said finally. &quot;Let&#39;s just... be guys for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
They made their way to the living room, where the party was in full swing. Rachael watched the humans dance and laugh, feeling a strange sense of detachment from them. He was one of them, but he was also something more. He sat on the couch, his furry body sinking into the cushions, and picked up a beer with his massive paw. The cold liquid was surprisingly refreshing, and he took a long swig, letting it run down his throat. Sam sat beside him, his eyes scanning the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s weird,&quot; Sam said, his voice a mix of awe and disbelief. &quot;I mean, we&#39;re guys now. With dicks and everything.&quot; Rachael nodded, unable to hold back a smirk. &quot;It&#39;s like we&#39;re living in a fucking porno,&quot; Sam continued, his eyes glancing down at his crotch. Rachael chuckled, feeling a sense of camaraderie with his new pack mate. They were adjusting to their new forms, but the excitement of it all was undeniable.<br />
<br />
Riven took another swig of his beer, feeling the coolness of the bottle in his furry hand. He couldn&#39;t help but agree with Sam—it was strange to have this newfound sense of masculinity, this power that came from having a cock and the ability to cum. He shifted uncomfortably, his cock swelling slightly at the thought. &quot;It&#39;s an adjustment,&quot; Rachael said, his voice a low rumble. &quot;But it feels...right. Like we&#39;re finally complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam nodded, his eyes lighting up with understanding. &quot;Yeah,&quot; He leaned back, his new body sprawled out in a way that Rachael never could&#39;ve managed in his human form. &quot;I mean, I always knew I liked guys, but now I get to be one. It&#39;s fucking amazing.&quot; Rachael felt his heart swell with pride at Sam&#39;s words.<br />
<br />
Riven took a moment to appreciate the situation. He had never felt so alive, so powerful. And yet, he was still Rachael—his mind, his thoughts, his emotions. The bear inside him was a part of him now, but it wasn&#39;t all of him. He looked at Sam, who was now devouring a plate of nachos like it was the last food on earth. It was a stark contrast to the way Rachael had eaten when he was human—dainty, careful bites. Now, they ate like men—or bears—whichever felt right in the moment.<br />
<br />
No longer worrying about looks and social norms, Rachael felt a sense of freedom in his new form. He watched as Sam devoured more nachos, his eyes lighting up with every crunch. Rachael felt his bear instincts kick in, and he reached for a handful of the cheesy goodness. The tang of the salsa mixed with the richness of the meat, sending a delightful explosion of flavors across his bear-enhanced taste buds. He savored each bite, the crunch and the chew satisfying him in a way that human food never had.<br />
<br />
Sam looked up, catching Rachael&#39;s gaze, and smirked. &quot;Oh man, this food is so good!&quot; He said around a mouthful, his cheeks bulging slightly. Rachael couldn&#39;t help but chuckle, his bear instincts making him feel more relaxed and at ease in his new form. &quot;I know what you mean,&quot; Rachael said, his deep, gruff voice still taking some getting used to. He felt his fur ruffle as he stretched out his arms, feeling the power surge through his muscles.<br />
<br />
As they sat there, Rachael noticed an itch on his fat stomach. Without missing a beat in the conversation, he lifted one of his massive paws and began to scratch vigorously, his claws digging into the fur and skin. Sam watched him for a moment, then shrugged and finished the nacho cheese platter. He licked his fingers, leaving a trail of cheesy goodness on his furry chin. Riven couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of kinship with his pack. They were men, but with the power and instincts of bears.<br />
<br />
Riven leaned back, feeling the couch dip under his weight. He looked around the room, watching the party goers dance and drink. &quot;It&#39;s weird,&quot; he said thoughtfully. &quot;I&#39;ve always felt like something was missing, you know? And now, with this... I feel complete.&quot; Sam nodded, his eyes reflecting the same contemplation. &quot;Yeah, I know what you mean,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s like we&#39;re finally... I don&#39;t know, free.&quot;<br />
<br />
Riven nodded, his fur ruffling slightly as he considered the truth in Sam&#39;s words. They were stuck in their were-bear forms until morning, but Rachael didn&#39;t feel trapped. He felt alive, more alive than he ever had as a human. The bear inside him roared in agreement, eager to explore this new world of sensations and power.<br />
<br />
He felt sad that he would return to being the pathetic woman Rachel was the next morning. Rachael took a deep breath, savoring the scent of the room—the beer, the pizza, the faint hint of sweat. It was a far cry from the floral perfumes and hairspray of the salon he had worked at. He turned to Sam. &quot;What&#39;s the first thing you want to do when we&#39;re stuck as bears?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam looked thoughtful for a moment before his face lit up with a mischievous grin. He let out a burp that rumbled through the room, deep and resonant, echoing his newfound power. Rachael, now going by Riven, couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. The smell of nacho cheese and beer wafted from Sam&#39;s mouth, a stark contrast to the elegant fragrances Rachael had grown accustomed to in the salon. Instead of being embarrassed, Sam puffed out his chest, his fur ruffling with pride. &quot;What?&quot; he said, grinning. &quot;It&#39;s not every day you get to burp like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Riven&#39;s smile grew wider, showing off his sharp teeth. &quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; he said, letting out a huge burp himself. The sound was so deep it was almost a roar. &quot;It&#39;s not every day you get to be a bear.&quot; Rachael&#39;s human mind was still in there, but Rachael was gone. Riven felt a thrill of excitement as he thought of all the things he could do in this form that Rachael never could.<br />
<br />
He and Sam had a moment of understanding, sharing a laugh that was part human, part bear. Rachael&#39;s human worries were fading away, and Rachael was fully embracing Riven. The scent of fear and excitement from the college students filled the air, and Riven&#39;s nose twitched with curiosity. He could feel the presence of the new werebears, their unique aromas mingling with the smells of spilled drinks and sweaty bodies.<br />
<br />
With a gentle pat on Sam&#39;s shoulder, he said, &quot;See you later, dude,&quot; and got up. Riven&#39;s massive bear paws made a thumping sound as he lumbered across the floor, looking among the human party goers to see who had changed. He could feel the power of his new form as he moved through the house, his nose working overtime to pick up the scents of his new kin. His eyes glowed with an inner light as he saw a group of his new pack members laughing.<br />
<br />
The two then turned around and smiled. &quot;Riven, I assume,&quot; one of the werebears said, stepping forward. Rachael nodded, his fur ruffling with pride. The werebear introduced himself as &#39;Grizz&#39; and the other as &#39;Luna&#39;. Rachael felt a strange kinship with them, despite their differences. Grizz was a large, burly creature with a thick coat of fur, while Luna was a sleek, graceful she-bear with piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through Rachael. Rachael felt his human ego shrink a little, but Riven&#39;s bear spirit swelled with excitement.<br />
<br />
The two then told the story about how they changed. Luna started them off &quot;here is how it happened. We were just minding our own business near the snack table when a werebear named jake brought out another deli plate. He said it was special and we had to try it&quot; she spoke in a smooth, almost hypnotic tone that made Rachael&#39;s human mind swim with memories of late-night infomercials. Grizz took over, his deep voice rumbling through Rachael&#39;s chest. &quot;Yeah, and it was the most amazing thing I&#39;ve ever tasted. I didn&#39;t know what was happening, but when I looked down, fur was sprouting everywhere.&quot; Riven can imagine how that happened</p>
