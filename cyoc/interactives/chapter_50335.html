<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This could be bad,&quot; Jensen spoke as he listened to Alice's answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's still likely that he would be loyal to you,&quot; Kaylee commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but if the curse didn't interpret &quot;all of you&quot; to mean both Zack and the females but only the females, we could potentially have a male wolf that, while he will not challenge me directly... or even indirectly, he might be quite willing to work BEHIND the scenes to alter the Pack's mentality,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;Eager to please the Pack's females, which would likely include you and the Betas, Kaylee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we are only for YOU, master,&quot; Kaylee protested from her &quot;chair&quot;, &quot;Only for you... and we love only you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't mean a male who is eager to please the Pack's females won't be attracted to you,&quot; Jensen found himself involuntarily shuddering and protective of Kaylee and the twins, &quot;he might try to rape you if he gets the chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll KILL him!&quot; Hope spoke firmly in defense of her Alpha Female, &quot;I'm sure Grace and Isabelle could take him on their own, and I will follow the Alpha Female to complete the task.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Jensen responded, &quot;Zack is still our friend, Hope... even his manipulativeness has been improved from when he was a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But he could cause trouble,&quot; Darla spoke, knowing that the revaluations about Zack had now likely postponed any attempt to bring Julie, Abbey, and Samantha into the pack by at least a day, and hoped that one, Fran could take it, and two, Julie didn't do anything that risked foiling those plans, &quot;Even if he has no interest in replacing you, Master, if he begins manipulating the other females to do what he says... it could cause problems. He might even by trying to establish a hierarchy that could destroy the Pack's organization. If he was your &quot;best friend&quot; before you became the Big Bad Wolf, he might seek to return to that sort of status... which would demote Kaylee and myself and my sister, as he doesn't know us, and from little we know about your past, Master, both he and you did not like Kaylee's male form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you still have me kill my best friend?&quot; Jensen questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Master,&quot; Darla admitted, &quot;until he actually commits the act of treason against you, Master, legally I would not urge you to do anything of that nature. I merely wish to warn you of the danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isabelle and Grace are already watching,&quot; Kaylee commented weakly, &quot;perhaps they could continue such a mission... Zack would trust them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen nodded, &quot;Hope, you are to join 'Belle and Grace in spying on Zack. Find out anything and everything he has done or is doing and report to me or Kaylee. I also want to know WHO Zack has been associating with. If he does ANYTHING that seems remotely traitorous against ME, use your turn. If he chooses transform... make him into a male wolf that is as &quot;scrawny&quot; as Lawrence and Roger were with blind obedience to me. If he chooses dare, you are to make him one hundred percent loyal to me and respectful of Kaylee and the twins. But remember, your turn is ONLY to be used if he does something treasonous. He used his turn to transform Mr. P, so we do not want to rapidly give him his turn back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understood, Master,&quot; Hope answered as Kaylee let her up, &quot;We will watch him like a hawk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope then left the room and passed Alexandra without betraying any hint of remorse or disapproval of her mission, but then that was the Master's orders. And Alexandra had her own hopes that Zack would be punished. His mistreatment of Roger and Lawrence, and likely Ulysses had pissed off Nicole, and embarrassed Alexandra for having mated with him. The other males were part of the Pack and were deliberately left as males for a reason. Deriding them and trying to make it so that they wouldn't ever get a chance to mate was wrong in Alexandra's eyes... especially as Nick, despite his perverted side, and complete willingness to mate with any of the females, seemed to have a deep attraction toward Nicole only. If Zack had been left unchecked, he might have insured that he was the ONLY one available to mate with... and that made Alexandra shudder.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may return to what you were doing before,&quot; Jensen spoke to Alexandra, &quot;Inform the females that Zack is under official investigation. He is not to know of it, and if he does anything other then directly trying to please you sexually, you are to report it to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He has already tried, Master,&quot; Alexandra reported, deciding to report Nicole's concerns, &quot;Nicole observed him eying both Kaylee and the twins when Mr. P joined us... as though he wished to mate with them... and in one private conversation with Nick, he seemed to indicate at least the willingness to make Roger and Lawrence, and possibly Ulysses as well feel inadequate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take that is why he was seeming somewhat wounded shortly afterward?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Alexandra nodded, &quot;Nicole struck him firmly between his legs to defend you and the other males, Master. She has since declared us to be off-limits to him until he submits to you and the Alpha Female and likely until he apologizes to at least Roger and Lawrence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch,&quot; Darla commented in the background grimacing at injuries sustained as Daryl back when &quot;he&quot; was in high school, and feeling grateful for her present femininity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Inform Nicole that officially, the pack's females are to mate with him,&quot; Jensen instructed, &quot;or at least that there is to be no &quot;law&quot; against mating with him. What they decide to do with Zack is their business... and with Roger and Lawrence's recent upgrades, there should be no reason to assume that there will be no competition for your attention, should I not be interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Master,&quot; Alexandra nodded and then slowly left.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Ulysses, Master?&quot; Fran asked as she had remained silent through all of this.<br />
<br />
&quot;He'll likely grow into his role as another male,&quot; Jensen answered, &quot;and from what I've seen, Sarah seems attached to him. I doubt she would let Zack do him any harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would she be attached to him?&quot; Kaylee asked, &quot;He seems to be only old enough where a boy would only begin to mature physically.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Likely as a brother/sister relationship,&quot; Darla commented, &quot;Like the way you see Jenny, Bart, Kevin, Marcy, and Alice behave despite the fact that originally they were all unrelated to each other and Jenny and Bart and Kevin and Marcy were married to each other... either that or its simply platonic friendship... which could transform into serious romance when Ulysses matures. It's hard to tell, with the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee found herself smiling at the mention of the children the game had created for her. They all did get along and behaved as brothers and sisters should. She then turned to see Alice still standing there, silently listening.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may return to the other pups, Alice,&quot; Kaylee spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Alpha Female,&quot; Alice curtsied, &quot;I will also inform Mr. P of your thanks...&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that Alice was gone out the door and headed for the study.<br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the rest of the pups were fairly nervous as they entered the study with Martha leading and Mr. P protectively bringing up the rear. The black and gold wolf's warning to Jensen had unnerved them as they did not want to see their father deposed as the Alpha of the pack, or at best given a difficult life supervising his subordinates.<br />
What made it worse was that Zack was part of the pack. Kevin and Marcy fought to be Karen and Mark before they had been brought into the pack, and Patrick had chipped one of Jensen's teeth before becoming Mr. P. In each case the person attacking their father wasn't yet part of the pack and didn't understand... but Zack should no better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will father be alright, grandpa?&quot; Jenny asked they came into the study, &quot;Zack won't fight him, will he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll get him if he tries!&quot; Bart vowed bravely, with Kevin giving a cheering &quot;yeah&quot; beside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you will not,&quot; Mr. P said firmly, &quot;You are the pack's future. If there is to be a fight, you will let the adults do it...&quot; Mr. P then carefully rubbed his chin on the top of Jenny's head, giving a low and seemingly comforting growl, &quot;at the same time, I believe your father will be fine. Do not worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if he doesn't win?&quot; Marcy asked, remembering something from Animal Planet that when male lions took over a pride, the previous male's offspring would be killed without mercy, and while they weren't wolves, the principle of how their wolf pack operated and how a lion's pride operated seemed to be the same, &quot;what will happen to us then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. P and I will protect you,&quot; Martha said firmly as she lifted up Marcy and stroked her hair and fur with her two free hands, &quot;Remember that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Miss Martha,&quot; Marcy answered and leaned forward to hug silver four armed she-wolf.<br />
<br />
Martha nodded and then turned to see the mess that Nick had left when he had been trying to find out if the Smith's had any books on body-building. The dark gray male was still there and was frantically trying to clean up his mess.</p>
