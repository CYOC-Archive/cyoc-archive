<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric barely had any idea what had happened to him over the course of that time he&#39;d spent playing his game, though he had some hint as when he got up to go get some water he noted he felt heavier all over. He looked down at the golden band around his arm, noting it was seeming to glow a bit. He didn&#39;t even realize he&#39;d gone from 12 to 15 in the space of an hour, and just assumed he was having a bit of a growth spurt or something, though increasingly the way he was feeling was starting to seem more natural to him.<br />
<br />
As he drank some water, adjusting his shirt over his fattened body, he heard his phone start ringing. He checked his phone and saw it was his friend Mark from school. Mark was a pretty cool guy, and always loved to hang out, run around, and toss around a football or something. While Eric was for some reason not feeling too inclined to run around and exercise right now, he was more than up for hanging out with Mark despite this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man,&quot; he said as he answered the phone, &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You down to toss around the pigskin at the park and do some exploration around town?&quot; Mark was always the adventurous sort...<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, I&#39;m down!&quot; Eric usually needed to tell his mother when he was heading out even to go out like this...but for some reason he skipped on that today. It just felt more normal, more right to him that he was able to go ahead and go hang out with his friends whenever he wanted to, within some reasonable limits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great,&quot; Mark said with a distinct mischievous sound in his voice, &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to looking around some of the old abandoned houses. You ready for some spooky shit?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it!&quot; Eric said, not even flinching a little at the casual use of profanity. Usually they had to curate their words when they were talking around the house. But right now Eric didn&#39;t really mind. After all, he guessed, he was 12 and he wasn&#39;t some little kid any more...right? That was his age...he remembered that being his age.<br />
<br />
Eric hurried upstairs and got dressed in more fitting clothes for the adventure Mark wanted to take him on, dressing in a thin white tank top that bared a bit of his belly at the bottom, shorts, and pulled on some running shoes for the day. As Eric hurried out, the band of age was taking into account his activity level shifting a bit, while also remembering the preference from earlier.<br />
<br />
The park was pretty active at this time of day, and by the time Eric arrived, he was feeling winded but in some way better than usual. As the band of age worked on him, his hefty body weight adjusted, his muscles strengthening under the fat as he ran off to the park. He was starting to drift from fat over toward just stocky. Nowhere near demonstrably fit yet, but it was a first step.<br />
<br />
Mark had been two years older than Eric at the start, but now, Mark was one year younger at present. He was a muscular and fit young jock with bushy, bright blond hair, a beaming, boyish face, and he usually wore a red jacket over a blue tank top, jeans and sneaker shoes. He was very proud of the fitness he had for his age, and liked to talk about where he intended to go with it. At present Mark was tossing around a football in one hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ready for this, man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it!&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that the two started taking off, trying to trick and get the ball past one another as they tossed it back and forth, shooting it over and under their usual throw strength. Mark was so impressively fit, and Eric was hoping he could overcome this weird funk he was feeling today and get as fit and strong as Mark was. Little did Eric know, the band of age was observing all of this and initializing even more changes to take place in the young man.<br />
<br />
Fifteen year old Eric began to shift, his body staying stocky and retaining its fatty appearance, but as he tossed the football back and forth, this impetus began to play out. His arms and legs grew stronger, broader and more pronounced with muscles, Biceps and triceps fighting off any sleeved shirt. His shoulders broadening, developing in the back, front and lateral sides. His chest shelf began to develop from just plain moobs into a pair of tight, powerful but untoned pectorals. Strength radiating out from them, in a way Eric was totally unfamiliar with. His back swelling and widening, lats growing into existence between throws of the football.<br />
<br />
He grew taller, swelling in height to around six foot or six foot one so far. Such a change in height resulted in a different looking body overall.<br />
<br />
His gut remained for now, and even swelled a little bit more, but developed a tighter appearance, less slouching - changing to reflect strength immediately behind the weight of his fat. Even though Eric retained his double chin to some degree, he developed from a kid into a handsome young man - in such a way that barely made the chin issue a problem for him. It just made him look rather round faced, but still a knockout good looking young man.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s feet grew larger, all the better for helping his large physique move. His hands likewise grew broader and stronger, more weathered from exercise. He froze up as the football landed behind him, feeling his groin changing and finally becoming noticeably different. Even with his gut slightly hanging down near it, his manhood grew larger and longer as he matured to 18. His balls hanged low, and complimented a 7.5 inch manhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, what happened there?&quot; Mark asked, running over to the newly athletic Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have utterly no idea, this day&#39;s been weird all around man.&quot; Eric didn&#39;t know what all of this was, or why his groin was now so weird. It felt...kiiinda good. He realized he was now looking down at Mark, and rubbed his eyes. This seemed so weird...he was...he was 15? Was he 15? Or was he 12? Fuck, something weird was going on here and he needed to figure out what...<br />
<br />
&quot;...Dude, that&#39;s a pretty sweet little golden thing you&#39;ve got on your wrist there. Can I try it on?&quot; Mark was staring at the golden band, unknowingly the band of age.<br />
<br />
Eric looked at Mark and then down at the band of age, starting to wonder...</p>
