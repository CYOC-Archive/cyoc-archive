<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">During the original Outbreak, many people have been exposed to the Animalian virus, often more than once. Among them were several children who not only became Animalians, but were matured into adulthood early. But not every tale from the Outbreak has become public. There were many who wished to keep their privacy or their family preferred that way. But some may feel ready to share their story with the world, often as they&#39;re taking the next step in life. This is one of the Animalia Declassified.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, many relationships were completely remade by the Animalian virus, not just by the breaking down of species barrier, but by the maturing and rejuvenating effect a second exposure would cause. New Animalians found lovers among former pets, former masters, and old friends. Societal rules were broken down and remade, often guided by an invigorated libido.<br />
<br />
For instance, Carnelia hadn&#39;t had an easy childhood. Even when she was young, she could tell that her mom and dad didn&#39;t love each other like her friends&#39; parents did. Most of the time, it was just cold looks at each other, at least while Carnelia was around. But there were often arguments that Carnelia could overhear, even if she didn&#39;t always know what they were arguing about. Things got worse as she got older until finally, just as Carnelia was about to start high school, her parents decided to divorce.<br />
<br />
Of course, that brought the tough decision of which parent Carnelia wanted to live with. It wasn&#39;t that she loved so much that she couldn&#39;t pick between them. In fact, they seemed more interested in hating each other than caring for her. Once, Carnelia had overheard that the only reason they were married was because she had been an accident and their families forced them to marry. Thankfully, Carnelia had people who actually cared for each other. Grove was an old friend of the family and often babysat Carnelia while her parents were too busy. In fact, the judge had declared that until the divorce was settled and one of her parents was deemed suitable enough to care for a child, she would be living with Grove. Carnelia was perfectly happy to be staying with Grove. In fact, she hoped that Grove would adopt her. Things may have been heading that way, but sometimes fate has slightly different plans.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Carnelia had a bit of an awkward day at school. At 14 years old, puberty was getting started with her, with her hormones awakening new feelings. While she had been aware of boys for a while and knew that it was normal, she also found herself looking at other girls. Carnelia didn&#39;t think that was normal and thought something was wrong with her. She didn&#39;t dare tell her parents, but with Grove, she felt more comfortable. In fact, Grove revealed she also liked both boys and girls, though she was long since past looking for love.<br />
<br />
Well, if Carnelia wasn&#39;t certain if she really had an attraction to girls, today removed all doubts. She had saw Abby Brown that day. Not only had Abby become a horse, but she had the body of a woman, an incredibly sexy woman with huge breasts and a killer figure. Carnelia couldn&#39;t help stealing looks at Abby at every chance she got. For a while, she wondered if she lost all interest in boys. But one look at the high school&#39;s football team assured her that she still found guys attractive. Needless to say, Carnelia was wanting to get home as soon as possible to have privacy.<br />
<br />
Grove’s house was in a secluded area. It was built within a short distance inside the woods. That made a bit of a long walk to their closest neighbor. Grove said she moved there because she liked being closer to nature and the surrounding trees made it feel more private. Still, after the bus dropped her off, Carnelia wished she didn’t have to walk up such a long drive.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, Carnelia opened the door and called, “Granny Grove, I’m back!” Grove wasn’t her actual grandmother, but Carnelia had started calling her there when she was little and it had stuck ever since.<br />
<br />
“I’m in the den,” called Grove’s voice, “We have a guest here today.”<br />
<br />
“A guest?” asked Carnelia in surprise. She didn’t see any other parked cars and it was rather far for someone to just walk out. Still, she was heading towards the den.<br />
<br />
“Now, Carnelia, but you say anything, don’t be alarmed by his appearance. Or mine,” called Grove’s voice.<br />
<br />
Carnelia’s curiosity peaked. “Why would I be alarmed?” she asked.<br />
<br />
“Well, I’ve changed a bit,” said Grove. Carnelia soon saw how as she walked into the den. Sitting her usual chair was what looked like Grove based on her wearing the same green dress this morning and having the same long black hair. But Grove wasn’t an anthro wolf with blue-black fur this morning, also her breasts looked like it filled a bit more of her dress.<br />
<br />
There was also another anthro wolf sitting on the sofa. He had grey fur and didn’t look too old. Carnelia might guess he might be a year or two older than herself. The wolf wasn’t wearing anything, but he didn’t look embarrassed, not that there was anything showing through his fur. The wolf waved a hand and said, “Hi, my name’s Scout.”<br />
<br />
“Hi, I’m Carnelia,” said Carnelia out of habit, “You’re one of those Animalians, aren’t you?”<br />
<br />
“I guess so,” said Scout, “I haven’t met any others. I had wandered away from my pack and taken a drink from the stream. Then I felt strange all over. Not long after this, I turned into…this.” He indicated his own body. “I didn’t want to go back to the pack like this, so I wandered away and this was the first house I came across.”<br />
<br />
“He looked so lost and confused that I let him inside,” said Grove, “We had some tea while we were waiting for you to come home.”<br />
<br />
“So why are you a wolf now?” asked Carnelia, looking at Grove.<br />
<br />
“Er…I accidentally drank from his cup,” said Grove, “Apparently whatever made him like this is catching. But it’s not so bad. I actually feel a bit better than before.”<br />
<br />
“Really?” asked Carnelia before she walked over to Scout. “I want you to change me too,” she said.<br />
<br />
“You do?” asked Scout.<br />
<br />
“Carnelia, wait a minute,” said Grove, “You don’t need to change.”<br />
<br />
“I want to,” said Carnelia, “I saw Abby at school and I think she looked…good. And if I’m a wolf too, maybe I can stay with you for good.”<br />
<br />
Grove thought it over. She wouldn’t deny that keeping Carnelia here was something she wanted. Carnelia was lucky enough to grow up well-adjusted as she was from living in that fractious household. A lot of that was due to her having friends outside her house, including Grove herself. She wondered if the judge would rule in her favor over this. Of course, there obviously weren’t any laws against it since Animalians didn’t exist until very recently. “Well, if it’s sure of what you want, I guess I’m ok with it,” said Grove.<br />
<br />
Carnelia grinned before turning to Scout, “Ok, how did you change Grove?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not really sure,” said Scout, “I guess some of my saliva or something was still in my cup so-” Carnelia quickly planted a big kiss on his mouth. The wolf was too started to keep his mouth closed so she was able to snake her tongue in for good measure. “What was that?” asked Scout as she pulled away.<br />
<br />
“A kiss,” said Carnelia, “A French kiss, to be exact. I guess you’re more used to wolfy kisses.” She looked at her hands with anticipation. She didn’t have to wait long as a tingle passed through her body. Her palms grew what looked like callouses until they expanded into paw pads. Fortunately, her hands didn’t really change aside from her nails becoming claws and fur growing on the back of them. Her feet were a different matter, and she had to take off her shoes as her arches became too long to fit them. She didn’t need to stand on them as her legs adjusted to her walking on the balls of her feet, which soon became wolf paws. She had to lower the back of her jeans a bit to make room for wolf’s tail and her red hoodie got a bit snugger as her breasts grew up to B cups. It felt strangest when her face pushed out into a wolf’s muzzle and her ears moved up her head. But Carnelia was not unhappy with the results. “Oh, wow, I’m like a werewolf,” she said happily.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think we’re the same as werewolves,” said Grove going up to her.<br />
<br />
“But I bet my parents won’t want me like this,” said Carnelia excitedly, “Now I don’t have to pick between them.”<br />
<br />
“Are they really that bad?” asked Scout with concern.<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid so,” said Grove, “At least they didn’t abuse her.”<br />
<br />
“But you’re so much better than them,” said Carnelia before giving Grove a big lick across her muzzle.<br />
<br />
Grove spat in surprise before wiping off her mouth. “What was that for?”<br />
<br />
“What? That was just a wolfy kiss,” said Carnelia, “We’re wolves now, so we can kiss that way.”<br />
<br />
“Carnelia, we’re not animals,” said Grove before saying to Scout, “No offense.”<br />
<br />
“Why should I be?” asked Scout.<br />
<br />
“Granny Grove, I’m feeling funny,” said Carnelia.<br />
<br />
“Funny how?” asked Grove.<br />
<br />
“Like I’m tingling all over,” said Carnelia, “Am I changing again? And I’m going to become even more of a wolf?”<br />
<br />
“I think you’re becoming more of…something,” said Grove. She could see that Carnelia was getting taller, the distance between their heads getting shorter. “Carnelia, you’re growing,” said Grove.<br />
<br />
“Looks like you are too,” said Carnelia, a slightly different tone to her voice. That’s when Grove really noticed her own tingling. Unlike Carnelia, she wasn’t getting taller. But she could feel her body getting bigger in other ways. Muscles were starting to thrum with energy as strength she hadn’t felt before started filling them. Excess fat was melting away from her waist. But not from her breasts, which seemed to only get larger and perkier.<br />
<br />
Carnelia was fascinated by them as they started to stretch the green dress out. Her own breasts were swelling more, filling up more of her hoodie. As they took up more room, they dragged her breasts up even more than her height. Her jeans were creaking as her hips and ass were filling out. Carnelia could feel the lust pouring out of her groin and it soon started clouding her thoughts. She cupped Grove’s breasts, teasing the nipples that were pushing through her too-tight bra. “Granny, what big boobs you have,” she said in a sexy growl that sounded more mature than it was before.<br />
<br />
Grove gasped as Carnelia caressed her. She shouldn’t encourage it, but the lust from her own groin was starting to cloud her thoughts. And she could smell the arousal in the young wolf girl in front of her. Only she was less of a young girl than before. She was clearly becoming a woman as her body filled with sexy curves. Desire like she hadn’t felt in years pushed the rest of Grove’s doubts aside. “All the better to nurse you with, my dear,” she said in a sexy growl of her own. Her new claws easily tore through the taut straining material of her dress and bra and tore it away from her torso. It was quite a relief to be able to breathe and let her girls breathe. Below her breasts, her stomach had flattened out and was starting to ripple with abs.<br />
<br />
Carnelia quickly latched onto Grove’s exposed nipple and started sucking. She found herself starting to crouch a bit as she grew taller. Her own breasts were getting more cramped inside her hoodie, her sleeves being pulled up as they got longer. Fortunately, Grove was there to help with that. She pulled at the hoodie, ripping it and the shirt under it until she got it off. The training bra had snapped already and fell as soon as the shirt was removed. Grove ran her hands down Carnelia’s sides, feeling the muscles beneath the fur. When they came to her ass, Grove groped it, feeling it squeezed inside her jeans. “Ooh, what a big ass you have,” crooned Grove.<br />
<br />
Carnelia grinned and said in a sultry voice, “All the better to bed you with, my dear.” Both wolf women shredded away decorum like they shredded each other’s clothes. Pretty soon, they were both naked. As Carnelia finished maturing into a grown woman, so had Grove regained her youth and more of a figure than she ever had. And while Carnelia was definitely fit, Grove’s muscles were a bit bigger, possibly from having more years of experience. Both women were completely caught in each other’s arousal. They drew close, large breasts squishing against each other. Carnelia’s fingers found the drenched slit between Grove’s legs. “Granny, what a juicy pussy you’ve got,” growled Carnelia.<br />
<br />
Grove, who hardly looked like a granny now, growled, “All the better to play with you, my dear.” Her own fingers found Carnelia’s pussy and they quickly sank in. Both women moaned loudly as they fingered each other, breasts pressing further together. Carnelia kissed Grove again, only this was a deep, more passionate kiss that Grove gladly returned. The two drew each other tighter as they got so close to their climaxes. Then they howled as a small flood gushed from their clefts.<br />
<br />
Carnelia and Grove grinned at each other, savoring the other wolf woman’s beauty. “Guess I don’t have to worry about living with my parents now,” said Carnelia, now old enough to be a mother herself.<br />
<br />
“My house is more than big enough for the two of us,” said Grove before looking past Carnelia, “Or should I say three?”<br />
<br />
Carnelia followed her gaze to see Scout was still there. He was obviously mesmerized by the two sexy wolves in front of him. His dick has fully hard and out of his sheath. But now that they were looking at him, Scout felt more nervous. “Uh, do you want me to go?” he asked, trying in vain to hide his erection.<br />
<br />
“Oh, we don’t want you going anywhere,” said Carnelia, licking her lips.<br />
<br />
“Except up to my bedroom,” said Grove.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, Scout was on Grove&#39;s bed while she was riding on top of him. She said Scout should have an experienced woman first. Carnelia wasn&#39;t upset as she was still getting herself off as she watched Grove fuck Scout. And she was liking the improvements she was making to him.<br />
<br />
It was clear whatever made Carnelia grow up was also working on Scout. As he thrust his dick into Grove and sucked on her tit, his body was also getting bigger and older. Carnelia licked her lips as Scout&#39;s shoulders got broader, his muscles becoming more noticeable. Grove was appreciating his changes from the way she was shaking her hips. Carnelia&#39;s hands were occupied with one deep inside her pussy and the other squeezing her nipple and getting a stream of milk going. By the way the other wolves were thrusting, they were getting close to their climax and Carnelia wanted hers too. As the three of them reached their peak, Grove made a surprising move. She pulled herself completely off of Scout&#39;s dick, though not before a burst of seed fired inside her. The rest of his load shot out over her stomach and partly on his.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that was so hot...&quot; moaned Carnelia, her pussy still quivering with aftershocks.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why&#39;d you pull out?&quot; asked Scout, his voice now deep and mature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I don&#39;t want to get stuck on your knot,&quot; said Grove, &quot;And it would be unfair to make Carnelia wait so long. I&#39;d say you&#39;re more than ready for her now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carnelia grinned as she sauntered over. She admired Scout&#39;s body, now that he was a true man of a wolf. His muscles rippled under his short coat. And his dick had definitely grown while inside Grove&#39;s pussy with balls swollen and yet to be emptied. Carnelia couldn&#39;t wait to have it inside hers. She crawled onto the bed and lied on her back, her legs spread open. Scout quickly took her invitation and climbed on top of her. He probed in slowly at first, getting Carnelia used to having something inside her. Carnelia felt a bit of pain as her virginity tore, but her pleasure soon overrode it. Wrapping her legs around Scout, she pulled him in deeper. Scout quickly got the message and started thrusting. Grove smiled with approval before she also climbed on top of Carnelia, namely her head. Carnelia soon found Grove&#39;s pussy right in her face and quickly started licking it out. The taste of Grove&#39;s juices and Scout&#39;s leftover seed was intoxicating. Carnelia was in total bliss between these two wolves.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
After their post-conversion euphoria eventually settled down, things became more settled for Grove, Carnelia, and Scout. First off, it wasn&#39;t much of a surprise that Carnelia&#39;s parents wished to wash her hands of their daughter, not just because of turning into a &#39;freak&#39;, but revealing herself to be a &#39;deviant&#39;. Carnelia wasn&#39;t particularly sorry to see the last of them. The legislation eventually determined that all double-dosed Animalians were considered legal adults, regardless of their chronological age. As such, Carnelia was free to move in with both Grove and Scout. However, Grove wanted her to complete her education, so Carnelia had to attend WSA with other former children from the Outbreak. At least Scout was also there to support her.<br />
<br />
Grove, meanwhile, used her second youth to reapply herself. She went to a community college to get a better degree. Though until she had her new job, she performed at the Meat Market to help bring in enough income. Carnelia and Scout didn&#39;t think less of her for it. In fact, Carnelia was more than happy to perform with her, though obviously school schedules have to be worked around.<br />
<br />
As time went on, their financial situation improved, especially after Carnelia and Scout finished high school and college. And with those out of the way, it was finally time for the three of them to legally cement their relationship. Animalia&#39;s laws had no problem with Scout having two wives, thanks to adjustments made for more communal species like lions. A few months later, Grove and Carnelia were delighted to learn that they were both pregnant. Carnelia promised her pups would grow up in a far better household than she had. Which shouldn&#39;t be a problem considering her husband and wife.</p>
