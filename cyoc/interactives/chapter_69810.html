<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen woke from her groggy stupor, feeling the familiar salty liquid running through her lips. Her mind felt fuzzy and cloudy, but she was just beginning to become aware of the outside world. As she peed, she heard her mistress...what was her name?...say something. She couldn't understand a word she was saying. She tried to rid her mind of the images of fingers being stuffed down her throat, and focused. Finally, her comprehension began to return. <br />
&quot;Jen, you okay?&quot; she heard. <br />
&quot;I'm fine,&quot; Jen said, &quot;What's wrong?&quot; <br />
&quot;Y-you didn't talk to anyone besides me, did you? Like a spirit or something?&quot; <br />
&quot;Spirit?&quot; Jen asked. She could vaguely remembered what had happened. A voice maybe? &quot;Maybe...&quot; <br />
&quot;Jen, if you did, than you might be stuck.&quot; <br />
&quot;Stuck?&quot; <br />
&quot;Forever.&quot; <br />
&quot;Forever?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; she said. &quot;Forever. The lady who created the curse floats around the town as a spirit, and will occasionally offer her services to victims of her curse. In your case, she may have asked you if you wanted to stay in your current form.&quot; <br />
&quot;But why would I say yes?&quot; <br />
&quot;If you were aroused, you really aren't yourself, so...you may have said yes. I did have a wet dream last night.&quot; <br />
&quot;So...this is it?&quot; <br />
&quot;I think so,&quot; Michelle said. &quot;I'm so sorry this had to happen to you.&quot; <br />
&quot;I-it's okay.&quot; Jen said, mentally crying. Her life was gone. Everything she had worked for. Everything she had planned to do. Gone. Just like that, she had traded her life for the simple existence of a sex organ. <br />
The rest of the day went by in haze for Jen, the only highlights being when she got to see the inside of a toilet bowl. She would weep mostly, making no contact with Michelle. Michelle didn't mind, understanding how hard it was for her. <br />
<br />
That night, Michelle quietly went to sleep. She went to bed nude, feeling sorry for Jen. Jen, of course, couldn't sleep. She wallowed in self pity most of the night, realizing this was how it would always be. The most boring life, not even being able to sleep. <br />
&quot;Are you not happy, young one?&quot; Jen heard a voice. <br />
&quot;You took my life away from me!&quot; Jen screamed at the voice. <br />
&quot;That's what you-&quot;<br />
&quot;You knew that I was...I was...drunk on the pleasure. I couldn't think straight. Now I'm stuck.&quot; <br />
&quot;But you will learn to like being a body part. No worries. No planning. No thought.&quot; <br />
&quot;No thought?&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes, my dear. Body parts don't think. They don't need to. All you have to do is feel. Michelle's brain is controlling you just fine.&quot;<br />
&quot;But I have a mind too. I'm thinking right now!&quot; <br />
&quot;Then let go,&quot; she said. &quot;And life will become so much easier. So much better.&quot; <br />
&quot;But I-&quot; <br />
&quot;Shh&quot; the spirit said. &quot;You have only experienced a fraction of what it is like to truly not think. To just be. Now, for the rest of the night, you will just be. You will come out of it when your mistress relieves herself tomorrow morning, and maybe then you will realize that this is what you want. For now, good bye.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jen felt her mind rapidly slipping away. She felt no pleasure. No need for a penis, but her comprehension plummeted. Not that there was much around her to be aware of. But her thoughts of self pity, thoughts of what could be, just vanished. She simply was. Her thoughts drifted from anger to simple contentment. And her thoughts were no longer coherent sentences she was used to. All her focus was now on what she could feel. She could feel the light air currents that the fan above her made. It made her feel slightly tingly, but not aroused. Her mistress stirred, and said something, but what came out of her mouth no longer made since. Time's flow seemed to become distorted, as time had no meaning any longer. The only indication that it was morning was the slight warmth coming from the window. Her mistress got up, and went to the toilet. Jen felt the salty liquid pass through her. She was doing her job, she thought. But as she began to relax, her mind began to return to her. Her thoughts became sentences, and she began to take in what was going on around her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Michelle!&quot; Jen yelled. Michelle jumped on the toilet as she was wiping herself. <br />
&quot;God Jen, don't scare me like that.&quot; <br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Jen said. &quot;I just...I just woke up.&quot; <br />
&quot;I thought you couldn't sleep.&quot; <br />
&quot;Well, I wasn't really asleep. I just...was. The spirit from the curse came to me again.&quot; <br />
&quot;Did she offer you a way out?&quot; Michelle asked, turning the shower on. <br />
&quot;No,&quot; Jen said sadly. &quot;She said that I would like being a pussy. She said that I needed to stop thinking and just be.&quot; <br />
&quot;Be what?&quot; <br />
&quot;Content with what I am.&quot; <br />
&quot;Jen, don't listen to her. You still have some humanity left.&quot; <br />
&quot;Do I? I mean, I'm just your pussy after all. For the rest of my...well, existence.&quot; <br />
&quot;Stop that Jen! You were a girl, and you can still think like a girl.&quot; <br />
&quot;Why?&quot; <br />
&quot;Jen,&quot; Michelle sighed. &quot;Do what you want. But remember that whatever that crazy old lady says, you were a girl. A real girl. Please don't let go now.&quot; <br />
<br />
The shower was enjoyable again. Michelle didn't pleasure Jen nearly as much as last time, but it was enough. Jen stopped worrying, and just savored the sensations she was feeling. Warm water flowing down her lips, the soft soap being rubbed across her. It was heaven for her. To just feel. Not think, feel. It was oh so tempting to just let go of thought, but she could be strong she told herself. Finally she was dried off, dressed, and was back under Michelle's jeans in school again.</p>
