<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Inside the Tolliver house, Tony saw that there were really almost 3 or 4 separate parties going on in the living room, kitche, basement and elsewhere.  He found a safe spot for Jeff the bear cub to stay and wanted to join the dancing in the living room, but found that it was very difficult for him to get out of his stooped gorilla posture.  He opted, instead, for a spot atop the wide arm of a leather couch.  With his wide, hairy gorilla rear seated there, he could look all the other partiers in the eye.  <br />
<br />
A few people were shocked and scared by the sight of Tony the gorilla, but most everyone just assumed that it really was a costume.  Tony made sure to keep up a steady chatter with whoever happened past him so that his human voice was always there to reassure people.  Some people insisted on inspecting him quite closely, looking for some detail of his appearance that didn't fit.  Tony had fun with them.  &quot;Nope, no seam there&quot;  &quot;My hands?  Here, look at them&quot;<br />
<br />
One girl who professed to be a huge fan of &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;, touched gingerly at Tony's flattened nose.  &quot;It's perfect.  The only human thing about your face at all is your light colored eyes&quot;  She traced her fingers around Tony's dark gorilla lips.  &quot;Amazing&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It should be&quot; said Tony.  &quot;We had to heat the suit in a tub full of near boiling water and then I had to put it on right away so that it would mold to my body.  Then we heat sealed all the abdomen seams shut and glued the top to my head at my nostrils, lips and eyes.  You can't even see my skin at the edges, can you?&quot;<br />
The girl inspected him closely again.  &quot;No.  That is the most amazing costume ever&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I hope you vote that way&quot; <br />
The girl promised she would.  She also did Tony the favor of getting him a drink a couple times.  A beer or two was no big deal for a 475 pound gorilla.  And, of course, she eventually tossed a banana to him.  Instinctively, Tony devoured it, peel and all as gorillas do.  <br />
<br />
That was when Claire saw him.  She really didn't pay any attention to his eating the entire banana.  She had heard that Tony was at the party in an amazing costume and came looking for him.  She made a beeline for him from across a room of dancing teenagers.  <br />
&quot;That's really you in there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, it's really me&quot;<br />
Claire laughed.  &quot;Oh my god.  That's gotta be the greatest costume ever&quot;  she said and inspected him closely.  &quot;There's no visible seams or zippers or anything.  How'd you get in there?&quot;<br />
Tony repeated the same tale of a heated suit molding to his body and being glued at the eyelids, nostrils and lips.  He added a new part about a sort of a ripcord string being located where he couldn't show her.  Claire accepted it easily enough.  He was so casual about it and she always liked talking to Tony.  Hearing his voice coming from a gorilla didn't faze her.  It must be a suit, as he said.  They shared a few laughs about other partiers and their costumes and Claire came to have her arm around his giant, hairy shoulders.  After they shared another laugh, Tony turned to her.  Their eyes met.  They kissed, Claire's beautiful feminine lips seeming tiny against Tony's wide gorilla mouth.  Claire recoiled.<br />
&quot;Ugh!  Your breath is just horrible.  Did you have to simulate that part of being a gorilla, too?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry.  I- you know I didn't mean to displease you&quot;<br />
Claire sighed and rubbed Tony's big round belly eventually laughing at how it felt real.  She talked with Tony a bit longer then left to go back home.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may have fooled her, but you don't fool me&quot; said a voice behind him.<br />
&quot;Huh?  What?&quot; Tony spun around to face a girl he knew from school.  Her costume was a sort of goth girl melange that was really just a slightly amped up version of how she always looked in school.<br />
&quot;You really are a gorilla, aren't you, Tony?&quot;<br />
Tony forced a laugh.  &quot;Yeah, that's right.  I'm a talking gorilla.  Oh please.&quot;<br />
Tony could feel his gorilla bladder and bowels ready to burst and took the opportunity to jump down to the floor and scurry up to the upstairs bathroom.  Luckily, it was unoccupied.  He locked the door behind himself and set his huge rear down uncertainly on the seat.  He carefully relieved himself and wiped and washed his slick black hands while looking in the mirror.  He ambled out into the hall only to see the goth girl waiting for him.<br />
&quot;Gee, you must've gotten that suit on and off awful fast&quot;<br />
Tony tried to avoid her eyes.  He went to the right outside the bathroom, seeking to avoid her but only trapping himself with her in Wayne's bedroom.  The girl shut the door behind her and stood in front of it.<br />
&quot;You could always throw me out of the way&quot; she said.  &quot;Tony the 500 pound gorilla can do things like that.  Tony the 160 pound pretty boy weighed down by 50 pounds of suit probably couldn't, could he?&quot;<br />
Tony was flustered.  Why was this girl so insistent about this?  Why did she care?<br />
&quot;I don't know what I'm supposed to do to convince you.  I'm speaking to you.  I'm a human being.&quot;<br />
&quot;All you have to do is take off the suit to prove to me that it's a suit.  But you can't, can you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I-I have to keep on the suit until they vote on the best costume.  I-&quot;<br />
&quot;Relax&quot; she said, shocking Tony by sidling up to him where he sat on the edge of the bed.  &quot;I find you more attractive this way&quot; she said, taking Tony's gorilla face in both hands and planting a big wet kiss on his wide simian lips.  Tony gasped.  What is with this girl?!<br />
&quot;You're too perfect the other way.  All those stupid girls drool over you and they don't give a shit about Aldous Huxley or anything deeper than mtv and seventeen magazine.  The way you are now . . &quot; she chuckled and kissed a shocked Tony again and on top of that, Tony felt her tiny hand reach between his hairly legs, grasp his gorilla penis and give him several quick strokes.  <br />
Grrrrrrrr!  Tony let out a purely simian grunt and shoved her off him.  She was propelled across the room into a safe landing on a laundry basket.  She quickly collected herself.<br />
&quot;So&quot; she said brushing her hair out of her face.  &quot;You still want to pretend that you're just Tony in a gorilla suit, that you're that strong&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you want from me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Duh!  I was trying to get it&quot;<br />
&quot;But-but I'm, I'm a gorilla right now!  You *want* a gorilla?!&quot;<br />
She chuckled and approached him &quot;At least you admit it.  Your brother really *is* a werewolf, isn't he?&quot;<br />
Tony nodded slightly.  Again, she climbed atop him and Tony found himself leaning back on the bed with the girl kissing him, her tongue probing his gorilla mouth.  She chuckled under her breath.<br />
&quot;You have gorilla teeth.  How could you be faking that?  Or this&quot; she said, taking his penis in her hand again and vigorously stroking Tony.<br />
&quot;It's smaller than it was&quot;   He mumbled under his breath.  She laughed.  &quot;It is?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, much smaller&quot;<br />
&quot;Good, then you won't hurt me&quot; she replied and started pulling off her clothes.  In a few moments, she had mounted Tony and was furiously bucking up and down on his ape phallus.  Tony wanted to just let her ride him till he came but he was physically all gorilla.  And his sensory inputs and instincts led him to quickly brush her aside after just a minute of being ridden by her.  But he immediately picked her up off the bed and slammed into her from behind.  This was more like it.  He thrust over and over, alternately whispering words and grunting as an ape in her ears as he did so.  At last he shot his gorilla seed into her.  She turned around and hugged him, positively beaming and chuckling.  &quot;Tony, the gorilla&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Tony let her hug him, calculating all the while, waiting all the while for his erection to subside.  What a bizarre girl.  She never even asks how I got this way or whether I'll be stuck this way.  She wants me this way but not as I was.  He sighed and shook his gorilla head.  A few minutes later, he was out of there.  He jumped down the stairs and rejoined the party just before they announced the vote.  The title of best costume went to Mark.  Tony was a bit disappointed.  He was told he'd finished second.  The Tollivers all congratulated him on his costume as he hopped out of the house, as did many others.  <br />
<br />
But Tony couldn't get away from the whole situation fast enough.  He led bear cub Jeff and old man Jack back to the park.  When the electric wave passed through him and his body started slimming and losing hair, Tony could not have been more pleased.  He happily ran over to the bush where he'd hidden his clothes and pulled them on.  He made his way back to the Tolliver house with restored Jack and Jeff and on the way saw the goth girl.  She scrunched up her nose at the sight of him.</p>
