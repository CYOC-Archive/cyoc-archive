<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I&#39;m back, y&#39;all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been busy with life and with art, so unfortunately I wasn&#39;t able to write anything for A Paladin&#39;s Journey. However, I&#39;ve been trying to come up with a spin-off story based on the Cloud Plane (or the Nubial Plane) from the &quot;main&quot; branch of the thread. Plus, I&#39;ve been drawing visual references for Isaac&#39;s multiple forms as well as some of the other characters present in the story.<br/>
<br/>
Hope y&#39;all are safe amidst these times. I look forward to writing again. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    “I… was one of the scholars studying this crypt when it wasn’t infested with corruption,” Fytomorphia admitted.<br />
<br />
    Isaac’s eyes widened at the statement. Some of the scholars who were at the crypt when the corruption first spread out into the world would have perished in the battle to keep it at bay or amidst their escape from the crypt to safety. Some have succumbed to the corruption regardless of their protests, turning them into creatures without rational thought or awareness. The few that escaped were unfortunately too late as the forests surrounding the hidden venue had become twisted and repulsive. The foliage and liana were just as ravenous and as hostile as their faunal counterparts, as evidenced by the form Isaac had been turned into before his body took the White-Heart inside him.<br />
<br />
    “I was one of the scholars sent here to study plants for their magical properties. They gave me this atrium where I observed and tended to special plants imbued by the energies that the crypt emanated. It seemed that whatever went on deep in the crypt affected the area around it, so it made sense to study them as well at the time.”<br />
<br />
    “Wait,” Isaac interrupted, “you don’t know what was done any further than this point?”<br />
<br />
    “I was only able to see a few glimpses into other studies and experiments that weren’t in my expertise, but I couldn’t tell you anything that would be of great help to you, other than there are rooms similar to this one below.”<br />
<br />
    “Are there any noteworthy people you remember then when the crypt was populated with students and researchers?”<br />
<br />
    “...I can only remember a few,” Fytomorphia said, “before the spread of the corruption, Crawnav had been studying relics and enchantments in the room next to me. Other than that, I don&#39;t remember much else, although it could also be that I haven&#39;t left this room for years after the event.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Isaac took a deep breath. He was fairly impressed at how Fytomorphia hadn&#39;t lost her sanity being stuck in the same room for such an unfathomably long time.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Does the name Calmach sound familiar to you?&quot; <br />
<br />
    &quot;Um… yes, although I only remember their name in passing, but nothing else. For most of my time here in the crypt, I was mainly stationed here and outside in the forests where I was observing the trees nearby.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Fytomorphia then sighed, looking at the rays of light shining through the apertures of the ceiling. &quot;It&#39;s strange how much time can pass in one place. Sometimes I even forget it&#39;s been nearly a decade and I can still remember the events as if they had happened yesterday.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I didn&#39;t know something had gone horribly wrong until I heard the panic from those who were fortunate enough to flee. I was in the middle of pruning one of the plants I brought back from the forest the other day. When I saw those… black, tarry veins spread on the ground and taint the life around them, my blood went cold, and I ran to save whatever plants I could gather in my arms. Had I not bothered with that, I would&#39;ve been able to flee the crypt before the corruption had made it impossible. I could not step out of my garden without having to touch it, and I was already disgusted when I first knew of their existence.”<br />
<br />
    She only embraced herself, looking down towards the ground as she further narrated her reminiscences. &quot;I only clutched the few magical plants I had in my grasp, trapped by the sea of black that I found myself to be in. I felt hopeless. Lost. I was so close to death when it happened that I cried while embracing the few of my saplings in my arms. One of them—” She then gestured towards the White-Heart tree— “being the seed for the White-Heart. If I had known about their property to keep the corruption at bay, I would have left everything behind and took the seed so that it may grow and flourish where people can be protected from the corruption.”<br />
<br />
    Isaac knew of the White-Heart, but its rarity made it coveted by the nobles of his time. And with the ongoing threat of the vile corruption spreading all throughout the kingdom, it only became a luxury that even he could not be able to possess such an item. And yet, here he was, his entire being infused with the cleansing aura of the seed.<br />
<br />
    “I must have been lucky or blessed, because even with my corrupted form, I still retained my awareness and self. Even though my urges gnaw on me at times, I’ve still been able to resist, all because of the White-Heart.” Come to think of it, she has never been overtly sexual to him like most of the corrupted creatures he had faced before his adventure in the crypt. Her actions were, for the most part, as sane as the actions of any normal human being.<br />
<br />
“I still don’t know what went on down there or what cruel creatures you’ll have to face, and I can’t follow you, unfortunately. I am bound to this place, and even if I could leave, it would be dangerous for me to stray far from the White-Heart. You, however, have the physical strength and mental resilience to withstand corruption. Most people would have succumbed to it by their first contact.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you for your help,” Isaac expressed his gratitude. “You have been benevolent to me, and I cannot thank you enough through words alone. But I must leave you again in order to continue with my mission, and even then I don’t know if I will succeed in vanquishing the source of the corruption.”<br />
<br />
    “Will you return to see me if you do succeed?”<br />
<br />
    “I will, and I will not forget you even if I fail in my mission.”<br />
<br />
    Fytomorfia closed her eyes and smiled, golden tears already brimming on the corners of her eyes. She was glad to see that there may still be hope that the corruption can be forever destroyed.</p>
