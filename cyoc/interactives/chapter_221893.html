<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few hours later, Jasper was woken by Argent having sex with her. He was inhaling the crook of her neck and shoulder, obviously thinking her scent was like that of a delicate perfume. He nuzzled and cuddled her, rumbling his affection. Jasper tried to resist but Argent was just too strong. Too big. He could crush and immobilize her extremely easily. The sixteen eggs were settled upon soft cushions in a corner, safe from the sudden movements of the mating about to occur. Jasper protested but Argent was deaf to his snaps and insults. She could a little more willing and grateful! After all he was doing for her.<br />
&quot;Quit your struggles, dearest. You&#39;ve laid a clutch of eggs that are not mine. Eggs that will become hatchlings that I will raise. And their sire is obviously gone for good or else he&#39;d be here or you&#39;d have mentioned him. Not that I am angry regarding this, mind you. I was raised by a different sire than my own. My own sire died slain by humans but my mother&#39;s new mate was a very good father. I learned to be a good sire from him. So they are now my charge and responsibilities. So as compensation I&#39;d like to have a few hatchlings that would be mine. And a very pretty mate to go along with it. Because you are so, so beautiful. I&#39;m sure your baby dragons will be just as adorable. Was your last mate handsome?&quot;<br />
What could Jasper answer to this?!?! He was a human male not long ago! Until very recently, even! And now he had to raise his own reincarnated bastards with his own hands, without all the help and servants of his palace! He couldn&#39;t pawn them off to wetnurses or other silly women! He&#39;d have to do woman work! He was a concubine himself now! How vile! How humiliating! How degrading! He had to give birth to his own children, those he&#39;d had as Prince Jasper and the ones that disgusting Argent was literally thrusting upon him! And Argent was praising his new mate for being incredibly beautiful and fertile! He was waxing poetic regarding Jasper&#39;s beautiful curves, enchanting snout and enthralling traits and pupils. He told Jasper that no other dragonesss had mesmerized him so and that he was overjoyed at spending their long millennia together. He caressed and rubbed himself against his body and much to Jasper&#39;s horror, his new body was going away with its new tastes and desires. He could feel himself rise in desire and get frisky, and when he felt the humid lump of flesh unsheathing himself right next to his hindlimb, he sensed his utter revulsion. Ugh! But his body had other desires, and he could feel the lips and muscles of his vagina mew and clench, unhappy to squeeze merely air and nothing. Argent guffawed, attentive to every detail which hinted to his dearest mate&#39;s desire. He mounted her and thrust into her, roaring his utter elation at this glorious mating. Her womb was receiving him more than willingly and squeezed his member with much enthusiasm. He clenched his willing, magnificent and trembling gem between his four limbs, squeezing her as much as her womb tightened around his virile member. She was an utter delight, that one! She hit all the right places and when he finally ejaculated, he drenched her womb which received his gametes joyfully. Her fertility was incredible, welcoming the seed which would make adorable and the cutest little babies, to grow up into magnificent beast under the attentive care of two watchful parents. Argent ejaculated once more at the thought of the domestic bliss about to happen. A dream come true! He flattered his precious gem, while Jasper could only be a slave to his body. His mind reeled in utter disgust at what he had become. Part of him regretted the way he had treated his concubines and women in general, now that he was a female dragon about to raise many babies. Another part of his mind just wanted to kill Anya and get revenge at this humiliation he did not deserve at all. It wasn&#39;t his fault he was male and women were not! And he hadn&#39;t been as corny and pushy as this stupid male dragon! His harem of concubines loved him, they told him so! He always pleasured them and he was praised by them for it. Of course, he was infinitely too self-absorbed to realize that the gifts he gave them prompted their compliments and that they shouted little cries of pleasure just so he could leave them all the faster. He had been worse than what he criticised Argent about. This self-criticism would eventually come to him as years passed and as he adjusted to his new life and took on overdue responsibilities. And as the life of a concubine went, Argent was a lot kinder, attentive and understanding than Jasper had ever been as a human. Hopefully the gruff but kind-hearted and gentle big dragon would rub off on him.</p>
