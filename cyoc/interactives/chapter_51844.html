<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With their tails rubbing together as they kissed, it was one of the most pleasurable feelings that Kendra had ever felt.  Who knew that being with another mermaid could be so erotic?  She had never really questioned the fact that she was the only mermaid she knew.  She knew so little about what had happened to her; she only knew that she had to transform once a day willingly, or else she would start to transform in front of anyone.<br />
<br />
She had never thought that there might be other mermaids out there.  But now that she had found one in the form of Lisa, she wasn't at all disappointed.<br />
<br />
Kendra moaned slightly and they rolled over on the pool deck, with Lisa on top of her, the girl's hair tickling her face.  They kissed and kissed, and Kendra ran her hands across Lisa's naked back.  The two of them were topless.<br />
<br />
A distant part of Kendra's mind felt that this was wrong, but she couldn't imagine why.  She just wanted more.  She needed more.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This feels so good,&quot; Lisa murmured.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Kendra whispered back.  She kept rubbing their tails together...the tingling sensation increased and she moaned again...she could hear Lisa moan as well.  She was close to an orgasm.<br />
<br />
Lisa started to lower herself down Kendra's body...kissing her neck...then her chest...gently caressing her skin as she went.  It felt so good, Kendra just laid back and let Lisa do the work, feeling the tingling grow stronger and stronger as it happened.  She wanted this; she needed this.  She needed Lisa in a way that she had never needed anyone before.  The distant part of her mind became more concerned; why did she feel so strongly towards this girl who she hardly knew?  Was this just lust, or something deeper, something only mermaids could experience?  And why did something about this situation feel so wrong, when it was clearly so right?<br />
<br />
Lisa was kissing her belly button...and then going lower and lower...rubbing her tail...and...<br />
<br />
WHAM!!!<br />
<br />
The door burst open.  Both Lisa and Kendra shrieked.  Lisa rolled off of Kendra, who moaned in both disappointment and fear.  She reached towards Lisa, grabbing her hand, even as they turned towards the back door.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you DOING?!&quot; a girl's voice shouted angrily.<br />
<br />
A teen girl, around their age, came storming out onto the pool deck, looking furious and afraid.  She had black hair, short, so that it brushed against her shoulders.  She was wearing a dark blue shirt and black jeans; even her eyes were a dark shade of blue.  She looked familiar, but in her panic, Kendra couldn't place her.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Who--?&quot; Kendra started to ask.  <br />
<br />
&quot;April!&quot; Lisa said.  &quot;What the hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't 'what the hell' me Lisa!&quot; the girl named April said.  &quot;Look at you!  You know what will happen, and you're doing it anyway!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's she talking about?&quot; Kendra demanded.  &quot;What would happen?  Does she know what we are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I know what you are!&quot; April said.  &quot;And if I didn't, don't you think I would've found out right now?&quot;  Kendra blushed and didn't say anything.  &quot;Well, Lisa?  I think Kendra here deserves an explanation!  It's bad enough what you did to me; just think of what would've happened to you and this poor girl if I hadn't interrupted!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't mean...&quot; Lisa started to say, before growing silent and looking troubled.  &quot;I knew, I just...it's so hard...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you two talking about?&quot; Kendra demanded.<br />
<br />
April ignored her and walked over to Lisa.  She crouched down.  &quot;I know, Lisa,&quot; she said.  &quot;I know--HEY!&quot;<br />
<br />
Without warning, Lisa reached out and grabbed April, and dragged her to her.  They kissed deeply.  Kendra watched in a sort of stunned silence, feeling suddenly very hurt.  Her body had stopped tingling, and her mind was more clear now, but at the sight of them kissing, she felt...weird.  Betrayed.<br />
<br />
At first, April resisted.  And then, without any warning, she suddenly stopped and leaned into the kiss, ripping off her shirt and bra.  Lisa helped April remove her pants and panties, and then rolled on top of her, kissing her deeply.  Kendra continued to watch...and then it happened.<br />
<br />
Blue patches began to appear on April's legs.  They grew and grew, and then her legs began to fuse together.  April shuddered and moaned, and her tails merged...into a mermaid's tail!  April was a mermaid too!<br />
<br />
April's breasts grew slightly, just like Kendra's had.  <br />
<br />
Kendra let out a little moan of longing...Lisa stopped kissing April long enough to glance over, and then she pulled Kendra towards them...and then all three of them were rolling around on the ground, kissing and caressing one another.  The sensation of TWO mermaids rolling around with her, all of their tails intermingling and twisting and rubbing was almost too much for Kendra.  The tingling returned, and she was breathing deeply...she rolled on top of April, licking her breasts, and massaging her sides.  She started to lower herself, down towards the tail...like Lisa had been doing with her...she felt April shudder, and shudder some more...<br />
<br />
And then, as though she were moving through amber, April sat up and shoved Kendra off of her.  &quot;You have to stop,&quot; she panted.  &quot;Stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa clearly didn't want to stop.  She started towards April, lust in her eyes.  April shoved Lisa aside and into the pool, where she disappeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on?!&quot; Kendra demanded, shuddering from denied pleasure.  She felt so confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; April said.  &quot;Let me explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please do!&quot; Kendra said.  &quot;I feel so strange!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa isn't your typical mermaid,&quot; April said, glancing over her shoulder.  Lisa surfaced, her head appearing, hair slicked back.  She didn't look angry; just regretful.  She didn't quite look at April.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what is she?&quot; Kendra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A siren,&quot; April said.  &quot;Still a mermaid, of course.  You can see the tail as well as I.  But her main power is...well, you've witnessed it first hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendra felt sick.  She dragged herself away, bending her tail and wrapping her arms around it.  &quot;Oh God!&quot; she said.  &quot;You mean...you mean, she planned this?!  Dragged me over here because she was using some kind of....oh God!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry Kendra!&quot; Lisa said.  &quot;Please, it's not like that--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet, Lisa,&quot; April said.  &quot;Look, Kendra.  That's not entirely how it works.  You came over here because you wanted to.  She didn't force you to do anything.  Her power doesn't always work that way...and it's strongest on the people who already HAVE feelings for her.&quot;  Her expression darkened.  &quot;I should know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa looked away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't used to be a mermaid.  I'm not like you, Kendra, or Lisa.&quot;  April sighed.  She was silent for a few moments.  &quot;I've only been a mermaid for a few months.  And it's not because I was meant to be one.  It's because Lisa here took an interest in me.  We had been friends for a long time, you see.  Best friends.  And then Lisa turned...and she had to transform each day, just like you.  But unlike you, she also inherited the Siren part of being a mermaid.  And we were already close.  When I saw her in her transformed state...I couldn't resist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened then?&quot; Kendra asked in a low voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were...intimate.  We both reached orgasm.  And then I transformed into a mermaid too.  Both of us were so shocked...it was a miracle that either one of us weren't caught that day.  We were in my room at the time.  It took us almost three hours to transform back to normal after that...for awhile, I was so worried that I wouldn't be able to!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man...&quot; Kendra said.  &quot;You mean...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  If a girl has sex with either you or Lisa, it'll turn them into a mermaid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendra tried to absorb this information.  &quot;And with a guy?&quot; she asked.  &quot;If I had sex with a guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know.  It hasn't happened yet to any of us.  Considering we were lucky enough to meet a lesbian siren.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa looked away, blushing furiously, and looking sad.  &quot;I never meant to do this to you, April.  And I'm sorry.  It's so hard to control sometimes.  I just want to feel close to people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; April said.  &quot;I'm sorry too Lisa.  I know.&quot;  She reached out and grabbed her hand.  They smiled at each other.  &quot;And I hope you know why I had to stop you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Kendra asked again.  <br />
<br />
April hesitated.   &quot;Because...if you have sex with Lisa, or with me, and we both orgasm...then the transformation becomes permanent.  We'd never be able to switch back to our human forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kendra stared at her in horror.  &quot;Oh my God!&quot; she said.  &quot;I was so close to...you mean I would have been stuck?  Stuck as a mermaid?  Oh my God!  I love being a mermaid, but not being able to change back would be...oh man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; April said.  &quot;We've come pretty close a few times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Christ!&quot; Kendra said.  &quot;I didn't even like girls before today!  And now I have to deal with this fact too!&quot;  She hadn't been close with anyone since this whole thing had began...she was too afraid of revealing her secret.  And with this knowledge, it would be awhile before she was intimate with anyone again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Lisa said sadly.  &quot;I really am.  I didn't intend for that to happen.  It's kind of like you and your itch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay,&quot; Kendra said finally.  &quot;I know you didn't mean it.&quot; But she still felt a pang of regret.  It had felt REALLY good to be with Lisa.  Even now.....<br />
<br />
She tried to shake it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what?&quot; Kendra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, we wait for it to wear off.  And hope that Lisa can keep it in her bra.&quot;  April glanced at Lisa, who grinned guiltily.  &quot;It'll probably take a few hours for us to transform back.  Hopefully we won't be discovered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hours!&quot; Kendra repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.  Sexual energy really charges up the transformation.  You have to be careful, by the way.  Even masturbating will make you transform, and you'll end up spending most of the night and probably some of the morning trapped with a tail.  It's happened to me a few times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And me,&quot; Lisa muttered.  &quot;Quite often.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that explains why you're always so late,&quot; Kendra said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh.  I can't help it!  It feels so good!&quot;<br />
<br />
After feeling how good she felt after kissing Lisa, Kendra knew that she would probably be late a few times as well.  At least that wouldn't cause her to be permanently changed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Great.  So what are we going to do while we wait to transform?&quot; Kendra asked.  Then she paused and looked at April.  &quot;And neither of you were surprised to learn that I was a mermaid!  And how do you even know so much about being a mermaid?  I want answers!&quot;<br />
<br />
April sighed, and then glanced at Lisa, who nodded.  &quot;Alright,&quot; April said.  &quot;While we wait for our tails to go away...I'll tell you everything I know.&quot;  Then she frowned.  &quot;But I have to tell you...it's really hard to be serious when there's three topless girls, all of them with TAILS, sitting out like nothing is out of the ordinary.&quot;  Then she cracked up, and despite herself, Kendra laughed too.  <br />
<br />
It was turning out to be a very interesting day, that much was for sure.</p>
