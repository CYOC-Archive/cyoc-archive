<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a normal day of high school for Billy. Other than the fact that he was on his period, that is. It was so annoying that he couldn’t wear tampons, since there was no real way you could get them to sit in his throat without accidently inhaling them. On mornings like these, he would wake up to a mouthful of blood and vaginal discharge, which he had to rush to the toilet to expel from his throat, before thoroughly washing his mouth out with mouthwash. As disgusting as it was, this had been his life ever since he had started puberty. Combine this with the fact that the large, soft, fleshy lumps that filled his scrotum had recently started lactating, causing milk to ooze out his penis, and you could see why he was really starting to get sick of puberty. A womanly voice moan/farted out of his ass in frustration, before getting dressed and going downstairs. The boyish voice of his mother greeted him warmly from the kitchen, muffled by her panties and leggings. “Guah moaig biwwy, yuh re-eh fuh bethetht? I maeh thauthabe ah pa- OH! Paphhcaphes!” She moaned as the stimulation from speaking had built her up to a small orgasm. Billy was used to this, and simply replied “pptoupts pweet, muum”.<br />
As he sat down, he was greeted with a steaming plate of pancakes and sausages, topped with maple syrup. He voraciously bit into his meal, shuddering slightly as a lump of sausage slid past the sensitive walls of his throat, which, since he was on his period, were swollen and sensitive. He absentmindedly felt around his windpipe, feeling his ovaries and fallopian tubes wedged between his neck muscles. His mother, meanwhile, had a very different problem, and as she ate, the food sliding against the sides of her semi-full bladder causing her discomfort which soon forced her to excuse herself from the table. She quickly rushed to the bathroom, bending over the toilet and wretching a stream piss into the toilet. Since her bladder and vocal cords had aged along with her son, she had gradually gained control of them, but back when he was still an infant, she had many incidences of her uncontrolled bladder emptying itself into her mouth while she was preoccupied, forcing her to swallow the piss to avoid getting it on the carpet, her clothes, and whatever else was nearby. There was also the issue of her infant vocal cords moaning uncontrollably whenever she was upset, horny, hungry, or whatever else her body wanted to loudly communicate to her, and all reverberating through the deepest parts her sensitive inner walls, which frequently led to several orgasms while she fumbled to determine the source of her body’s displeasure. In these months her own body had become as needy as the baby she was supposed to be taking care of, who would also cry out of his ass until his mother let him suckle the nutrient-rich sperm from the rapidly developing testicles inside his mother’s breasts. The one part she did somewhat miss from those days was the incredibly orgasmic feeling of having her tiny balls sucked dry by her hungry baby. She remembered how she had rapidly learned to speak after her baby had been born, which had been the first time in her life to do so, because before then she had been totally mute, lacking any sort of vocal cords. Ultimately, she considered the bladder that had grown in her neck a small price to pay for her ability to speak, even if it was difficult to properly enunciate with her vaginal lips, as well as the constant arousal it caused. Having been born a mute and living that way for most of her life, she considered her masculine-sounding, cracking, pubescent voice to be as much of a miracle as her son.<br />
<br />
Her son, meanwhile, was jealous of his mother’s slurred speech, which compared to his own, was at least somewhat comprehensible. Even after years of speech therapy, and though his mother could understand him fairly well, having taught him his first words, his anus simply didn’t have the range of movement necessary to really speak coherently, often leading him to resort to farts of varying tones to convey emotion while writing out more detailed thoughts. <br />
<br />
As he sat on the bus to school, he thought of other minor inconveniences that other kids didn’t have to deal with. Like the fact that, since both his anus and nose were connected to his lungs, his breath constantly smelled vaguely of asshole, and if he inhaled from his anus and then accidently exhaled through his nose it smelled was as if he was farting through his nose. Overall, he wished he had a normal body, but had adapted to his current one to the point that the idea of speaking from his mouth or having testicles instead of mammary glands seemed strange to him. <br />
<br />
As the bus got closer to his school, his mind drifted to sex. If he really thought about it, he was technically a woman, with ovaries, mammary glands, and no testicles. Despite this, he still had a penis, and was still attracted to big-breasted women like any other teenage boy, though he would often fantasize about having a big, thick cock shoved down his sensitive throat, filling the womb that took the place of a good portion of his left lung (which was another mild annoyance, as it left him out of breath more often than the other boys, and the girls for that matter, while playing sports or doing other physical activities.) The idea of having sex with a guy still disgusted him, though, and instead his fantasies would often involve busty women with massive cocks between their legs, which they were more than willing to shove down his quivering throat. One girl in his class happened to have just that, in a way. In between her legs were a pair of massive horse testicles, which hung pendulously between her legs and obscured the tight human pussy behind it. Behind that she had a massive puckered donut of a horse’s anus, which took up most of the space between her plump ass cheeks, and above that a shark’s tail jutted out from her tailbone, in stark contrast to her other animal based features. Furthermore, a pair of cat ears sat atop her head, and on the sides of her head, obscured by her hair, were two small vaginas, situated where her human ears would have sat if she had them.  Due to occupying the same space as an ear canal normally would, her vaginas’ internals were incredibly tight, just large enough for a few fingers, or a very small penis. Finally, her most prominent feature was the two massive orbs set into her chest, though instead of breasts, these are instead two melon-sized human testicles surrounded by a thick layer of fatty breast flesh. All four of her massive testicles were connected to her esophagus, with each orgasm propelling a huge wave of human and horse semen up her throat and out her nose and mouth. Additionally, skin on her neck was sensitive and baggy like the shaft of a penis, and her lips and tongue were as sensitive as a cock head. She too had been a hapless victim of the same swapping spree that had changed Billy and his mother, but none of them had any way of knowing that.<br />
<br />
Oh, and he had totally forgot to mention that this was actually his beautiful girlfriend. They had been going out for a few months now, and they were truly a perfect match for each other. They were deeply in love, and each time they kissed and she unleashed a load of cum into his womb and stomach, he secretly hoped it would make him pregnant, though the prospect of squeezing a baby through his throat and jaws both aroused and terrified him.</p>
