<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your name is unimportant, it&#39;s always been unimportant, just like the rest of you. You lived an unimportant life on the streets, in an unimportant back alley where you hid for the nights, all the while scraping what unimportant bits off the street that you could. You hated being unimportant, being ignored by everyone, only noticed as a nuisance to other people&#39;s lives, so today would be different, you would become someone important. How did you plan to do that? Simple, a new shop had opened up recently, one proclaiming it sold all kinds of magic items and everyone seemed to believe it, you&#39;d even seen a person every now and then doing something no normal person should ever be able to do, and whenever asked how they were able to do it they would always mention this shop.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s how you figured you&#39;d do it, that&#39;s how you figured you&#39;d become someone important. Sneak in at night when the shop was closed and take all that you desired, gaining whatever powers the owner&#39;s products gave. You already had all the supplies you needed, a crowbar to open any locked cases, a glass cutter to cut your way past any sensors, and a lock pick you could use well enough. With nothing else left needed, you had no hesitation to wait.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get this over with.&quot; Like butter, everything went as smooth as could be. You didn&#39;t find any alarms in place by the back door and had easily picked your way inside, but when you&#39;d entered you couldn&#39;t help being blown away by what you found. All types of strange items of nearly every kind from the normal to the abnormal were littered about the store, haphazardly laid on open shelves and making your prepared tools all but useless. That didn&#39;t mean you were disappointed though, rather instead you were quite pleased by the fact, making it all the more tempting to take everything you could. With no reason not to, you did just that, stuffing everything you could get your hands on in the backpack you&#39;d pilfered from a nearby department store&#39;s trash. Everything from glowing crystals to crusty books, no telling what could be important after all. By the time your backpack was nearly full, there was just enough space for one more item to take before you had to leave for the night unless you wanted to get found and arrested.<br />
<br />
With hours till morning though, you figured you&#39;d take your time and look over what the shop had to offer before halting in your tracks at what you found. Across the room, placed delicately on a pedestal with strange ruins surrounding it was an egg of some sort. Larger than most, easily the size of a tennis ball, the egg itself had strange markings dotted across its pale surface. While unimpressive compared to the rest, you could help being drawn to the strange object just sitting out in the open. Cool to the touch as your hands glided across it, you would gently make to pick it up from its perch and feel just how heavy it weighed causing your muscles to strain just from holding it...no, it wasn&#39;t just heavy, it was getting heavier for some reason and you found yourself unable to let go. Forced to hold onto this egg from unknown origins, you would become acutely aware of how the egg seemed to grow large in your grasp, not just that however, you were growing smaller and as your clothing loosened across your shrinking frame you found your panic soon replaced by a desire of all things, desire to have all that was you absorbed by this egg and grow it, for you the shrink away into nothing with only clothing left behind as your remains.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the egg had grown larger than your entire body and your shrinking form had left you no other choice but to lay it upon the floor as all you could do was lay against it. Eventually, everything had gone black and you were gone. All that remained were the clothes you&#39;d been wearing, the backpack full of magic items you&#39;d stuffed it full of, and the now medicine ball-sized egg just laying on the floor that now pulsed with the heat of the living within it. As for what now lived within it, only time would tell, revealing what was to grow and develop for the day it finally hatched, but such a discovery was thousands of years from being known, instead, the egg passing from owner to owner as the years went by. Some curious to study it, others desiring to see it hatch before their very eyes, but each like the last it would be to no avail and the egg would be lost to time.<br />
<br />
While the egg was lost, however, society was not. Magic and sorcery now flooded the land creating new discoveries nearly every day for the people of the world. With all good things, however, there was a price, as for every good there was evil, and like always good fought against evil in its eternal struggle. Back and forth the two sides would wage their eternal war, history repeating itself over and over again with new players every era until eventually, the world had become a land unlike what it had used to be. Magic still persevered, however, but the wonders of science weren&#39;t so lucky as they disappeared over the course of time, people finding the necessity of such outdated and impractical creations unnecessary. Instead, humanity had reverted to times of old, with knights and kings across the land, but the magic of ages has created a golden age in which to live, the only hardships one could possibly face being the monsters that now roamed the land, creations of evil that still persisted to this day and forever would, their only deterrent being the adventurers who went off to do battle with these monsters, slaying them and taking what resources they dropped as spoils of their battle and the experience of such time affecting quite possibly the greatest achievement of man, the system.<br />
<br />
No longer was man confined to the shackles of natural evolution, instead, their very being was at their whims so long as they met the requirements to change them. Collecting experience to increase their &quot;level&quot; and gaining &quot;points&quot; to either change their shape, change their ability, or learn new and more exciting skills and magics without even so much as lifting the pages of a book or hearing the words of a teacher.<br />
<br />
It was during this time you finally hatched, long forgotten in the ruins of a time long past in what would have been called an apartment long ago but not seemed more like an overrun greenhouse of vines and other greenery. Sitting in a corner of this ruins of a room, your egg would shake as you thrashed within, held in place only by the vines that had grown around you, before finally, cracks would spread across its surface. More and more they would spread before finally you would burst free with a roar, more akin to a babe screeching pathetically to the wind. Gasping for air, slowly your memories would dawn upon you, what you were and what you&#39;d done, but not the who, or the why, as those specifics had become lost to the void of your memories. <br />
<br />
When you felt confident enough to stand on your own two feet you were shocked to find they weren&#39;t the feet you were most used to, instead, they were animalistic, backward, tipped with talons at their ends, yet for some reason felt as natural as the one&#39;s you&#39;d been born with. The rest of your body was much the same, claws and limbs that weren&#39;t that of a human, wings having grown from your back, a snout and horns now adorned your face and head, and to top it all your entire body had become completely covered in deep violet scales. <br />
<br />
You had become a dragon. Not just any dragon, a skinny dragon that stood only a foot tall and completely genderless with nothing between your legs or even nipples on your flat chest.<br />
<br />
Before you had long to question what you found, new memories made themselves known to you, filling your mind with the knowledge you knew wasn&#39;t yours, to begin with, unknown to you, the egg you&#39;d been growing within had absorbed the ambient magic of the land, training and teaching you for what was to come. The first of which being, the system, as numbers and letters took shape in your mind to form what was to be your stat page. Then it had finally taken its full shape, you found it to look like this.<br />
<br />
Lv: 1<br />
XP:0/10<br />
HP: 5/5<br />
MP: 5/5<br />
Combat Stats:<br />
Phys: 5<br />
Vit: 5<br />
Ment: 5<br />
Physical Stats:<br />
Size: 1<br />
Strength: 0<br />
Girth: 0<br />
!Breasts: 0<br />
!Cock: 0<br />
Skills:<br />
MV: 0/10: 0<br />
<br />
Along with knowing what it looked like, you also gained the knowledge of what each stat piece meant. Physicality meant how well you could move your body and damage your enemies in regards to physical means, Vitality was how much punishment your body could handle before finally succumbing to what wounds or poisons you took, mentality was your mental ability and controlled how well you were able to think and process information as well as how much magic you had available to cast with, Size was quite literally how large you were and how tall you could become with each point determining a new foot in height added with the rest of your body growing equally as well, strength was how much muscle you had on you and how strong you had become, girth was how fat you would become with excess stores of food and energy easily able to be held in your folds, Breasts and cock were rather in tandem with one another as neither existed but by adding points you would not only gain those features but the sex they were related to and to possibly become a man a woman or even both, after that was your skills whic determined what you knew and how well you knew it, and finally was MV which was a special case.<br />
<br />
Unlike the other stats on your page which all could be affected by fighting monsters and gaining experience to level up, MV was increased by simply collecting objects of monetary value, to become a dragon with a horde that was to be your own and signify how much you amassed. the more value you amassed, the higher the number would grow before reaching its limit, and when it did you would gain points in a new way, points in a way outside the normal system, points in a way that you desired most to no longer be unimportant like you once were.<br />
<br />
With all this known to you but with no knowledge of where you were or how you got there, what would you do next?</p>
