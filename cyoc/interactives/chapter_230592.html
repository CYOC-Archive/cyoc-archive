<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This is a story i thought of in celebration of the Solar Eclipse! Enjoy! c;</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a hectic day out in the world as news of the solar eclipse spread worldwide, You had everything planned out for the major event... or so you thought. As you argue with the clerk both sad and angry that you won&#39;t be seeing the eclipse tonight, &quot;what do you mean you are out of solar eclipse glasses?&quot; you ask the clerk, but she just shrugs her shoulders &quot;sorry dude but we are all sold out, better luck next time&quot; you knew the chances of a &quot;next time&quot; were slim to none, &quot;are you sure there aren&#39;t any in the back?&quot; you ask her as she rolls her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look man, the only way you are getting a pair of glasses is if some miracle happens or you happen to get lucky and i don&#39;t see either panning out before the eclipse tonight&quot; she tells you in a solemn tone. Defeated you leave the store as you see that it is nearly time for the eclipse on your watch. &#39;what am i going to do?&#39; you ask yourself. Just then you hear a faint &quot;psst&quot; and look around a bit shocked. It&#39;s then that you spot a older gentleman beckoning you over. The gentleman looks ancient but wanting to know what this was all about your curiosity got the better of you as you walk over.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard you were looking for solar eclipse viewing glasses young man&quot; the old man says in a old and raspy voice. You look at him skeptical and ask &quot;yeah i am, why?&quot; He then smiles at you as he pulls something out of his coat, as your eyes land on what he is holding you can hardly contain your excitement. &quot;i got these so i could view the eclipse with my family but my eyesight is not what it used to be, i feel like you will get more use out of them than i will&quot; the man tells you and suddenly a pang of guilt wells within your gut. &quot;So how much do i owe you for them sir?&quot; you ask but he just shakes his head as he places the glasses in your hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;No charge young man, just try to enjoy the eclipse&quot; he then mumbles something under his breath but it is hard to make out but it sounded like he said &quot;and also enjoy what follows&quot; the man smiles at you as he walks away. You try to stop the man to ask him about that last part but he is gone quicker than you can get the words out. As you look over the glasses they are a bit of a far cry from the ones you saw being advertised, these glasses while tinted like solar eclipse glasses have a purple rim with diamond studs on it and the shades are tinted a slight pink.<br />
<br />
The thought that you just got scammed crosses your mind but then you remember that he never charged you for the glasses so you shrug as you slip them into your pocket and get ready for the night. As you get your lawn chair setup you then raise the glasses up, still a little skeptical you do a little test by holding them out in the direction of the eclipse and with your eyes firmly shut you face the eclipse as you then slowly open your eyes to see if you can safely see the eclipse through the glasses and sure enough they seem pretty legit.<br />
<br />
Wasting no time you then lay down on your lawn chair as you crack open a beer and slide the glasses on into place. As you do you feel a slight sting as if you were just shocked by static. Shrugging you ignore it as you gaze at the solar eclipse in awe. As you are staring you fail to notice as your eyes take on a pink sheen as the glasses seemingly disappear from your face. Thinking you are still wearing them on a count of the pink sheen across your vision you fail to notice as a wave of changes start spreading out from your eyes.<br />
<br />
The first things that change are your eyes themselves taking on a larger and more alluring appearance. As your eyelashes extend out longer and your eyebrows thin out the changes eventually reach your nose which shrinks and becomes petite. As the Changes near your cheek bones they become less prominent and smooth over as your lips plump up and take on a pouty Disposition. The final change on your head takes place as all your facial hair disappears from your face as your hair lengthens down past your shoulders and changing from brown to a pitch black color. All the while a visible ring of skin tone change which radiates from your eyes also engulfs your had making you as pale as possible without being albino.<br />
<br />
As the changes converge at your neck they take your Adams apple with it slimming your neck down considerably. Next the changes start to spread out from your neck causing your broader shoulders to narrow and slim down as your chest bones become more prominent and visible. The changes then cascade down your chest and arms removing any and all hair from your body. As your arms slim down and your nails become elongated with a purple galaxy patterned nail polish you also fail to notice as two mounds start to push out from your nipples.<br />
<br />
Your nipples enlarge as well as your new breasts take form stopping in size at a perfect DD. The changes then travel further down your abdomen shrinking your waist in the process giving your frame a hourglass figure, your spine cracks as your back is given it&#39;s feminine arch. The changes then reach your hips as they widen out to child bearing proportions. Your ass also plumps up to match your hips becoming about as big as your breasts.<br />
<br />
You then feel a slight tugging sensation in your groin as your penis and balls melt into your abdomen smoothing over completely as a new hole is then torn lower down your abdomen right above your ass. Your new Vagina then forms inside you as your old balls take place as your new ovaries instead. The changes then continue down your legs fattening them up at first to match your hips while also making your body void of any hair save for your pubic region which is now cleanly shaved. The changes then culminate at your feet as they shrink and your toe nails take on the same pattern off nail polish as your fingernails.<br />
<br />
Your body then suddenly pulsates with pleasure as your height diminishes all at once leaving you at 5&#39;6&quot; which is a far cry from the 5&#39;11&quot; you used to be. Your clothes are the next thing to change as your shirt and pants disappear as they are replaced with a bra and a bikini. The pink sheen taking up your eyesight then disappears as your entire eyes including the sclera and your pupils and irises take on a purple sheen with tiny stars dotted throughout.<br />
<br />
As this change takes place you suddenly realize that the pink sheen is gone and begin to panic &quot;oh no, what happened to my gla-&quot; but then you are cut off at the sound of your voice which is distinctly feminine. Looking down your heart beats faster and faster as you take in your changes. &quot;what the fu-&quot; but you are cut off again as a massive headache rocks your head. New memories flood your mind and a new name however they do not overwrite your existing memories but rather they co-exist within your head just like how the eclipse is co-existing.<br />
<br />
You then look back up at the solar eclipse as you get entranced by the beauty of it and realize that you are able to view it just fine without any protection. and as the solar eclipse begins to separate your old memories as a man begin to slowly fade away along with them until there is nothing left but your memories as a woman. Smiling a thought then enters your new mind &#39;well i won&#39;t be seeing his memories until the next eclipse&#39; THE END</p>
