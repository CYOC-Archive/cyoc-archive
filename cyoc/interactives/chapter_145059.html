<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To go with the comic convention theme of this year&#39;s Spring Carnival, there were a few unusual exhibits on display for the visiting nerds and geeks to look at. One particular display stood out for not being from any comic or show, but it was still eye-catching nonetheless. A restored 1986 Daytona Ferrari would attract a lot of attention by itself, but one that&#39;s been given a black and white striped paint job stood out even more. It was pretty clear why the car had a rather unusual color scheme. Its owners, Annie and Stuart, had a small table next to the Ferrari and were answering questions about it.<br />
<br />
Naturally, the most common question was &#39;Where did you get it?&#39; Of course, there were a few signs detailing the car&#39;s discovery placed around it so Annie and Stuart wouldn&#39;t be pestered with that question too often. But occasionally, they answered it directly. &quot;It&#39;s a rather funny story, actually,&quot; said Annie, &quot;I suppose it&#39;s more &#39;funny weird&#39; than &#39;funny ha-ha&#39; to some people. Anyways, it started last week...&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
While Sarah and Malice were eager about their upcoming trip to the UK, they still had a few things to do before that. For one thing, PR-MD would like them to do an interview with the disco queens regarding the upcoming dance club. They were saddled with another unexpected job as well. Their parents were at the groomers&#39; today, getting their winter fur brushed out. That left Sarah and Malice to watch Bell and Bash. Fortunately, Ella and Simone didn&#39;t mind them bringing the pups along for the interview.<br />
<br />
Malice would have liked to do the interview in their penthouse, but it was such a nice day outside that they decided to sit out at some picnic tables near the apartment complex. Anyway, it would might have smelled too much like the two cats for Malice&#39;s tastes. Ella and Simone were waiting for them. So was Annie, who had moved into an apartment with Stuart. Part of her worried she was betraying her beliefs, but she was happier with Stuart than she would have thought. After the requisite amount of the cats and Annie fawning and cooing over the pups, Bell and Bash were put on leashes/harnesses and allowed to roam under the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you three have been advocating for a new dance club,&quot; said Sarah, opening the interview.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they&#39;ve been pushing for it, really,&quot; said Annie, &quot;I can work out wherever I need to. I was just feeling a bit nostalgic for the old days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some might say a dance club would be redundant with the Meat Market,&quot; said Malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, I am not one to dis the Meat Market,&quot; said Ella, &quot;In fact, I love performing over there. But it ain&#39;t what you would really call a dance club.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not?&quot; asked Malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, girl. The Meat Market&#39;s a joint for only a few people to dance while other cats watch,&quot; said Simone, &quot;What we really need is a place where everyone can get down and funky, shake their groove thangs and dance the night away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you lost Malice,&quot; said Sarah. Malice did have a confused look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, of course. You girls wouldn&#39;t remember disco, would you?&quot; asked Ella.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t born before 2000,&quot; said Sarah pointedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let me put it this way. Which is more fun: to watch a few people dance or let everyone dance if they want to? It doesn&#39;t have to be sexy stuff, though I wouldn&#39;t complain. But a dance club would let everyone have fun,&quot; said Simone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, didn&#39;t think of it that way,&quot; said Malice.<br />
<br />
Just then, Annie glanced under the table and said, &quot;Uh, sorry to interrupt, but I think we&#39;ve got a couple of loose dogs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah and Malice looked under the tablet to see that Bell and Bash were gone. &quot;Malice, you were supposed to secure their leads,&quot; scolded Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were taking care of that,&quot; said Malice.<br />
<br />
Ella stood up and looked around. &quot;Well, at least they didn&#39;t go far,&quot; she said, pointing.<br />
<br />
Sarah and Malice stood up and spotted their baby siblings in the grass not too far away. At least they weren&#39;t out of sight, but they were digging up the ground. &quot;Bell, Bash, no!&quot; shouted Sarah, hurrying over to them. She picked them up by their harnesses. &quot;Oh great, now they&#39;ll need baths,&quot; she said, looking at the dirty pups.<br />
<br />
&quot;And of course we&#39;ll have to do it since Mom and Dad just got groomed,&quot; said Malice with annoyance.<br />
<br />
The other three had walked over and looked down at the whole. &quot;Hey, what&#39;s that?&quot; asked Simone, pointing at the hole. At the bottom, there was something soft and blue.<br />
<br />
Annie knelt down to take a better. &quot;Huh, looks like a towel. Who would bury a towel?&quot; she asked, reaching down to pick it up. When her hoof-tipped fingers touched the bottom of the hole, there was an audible tapping sound. Annie paused before knocking on the towel. They all heard a hollow, metallic ringing sound, like if Annie had tapped on an oil drum. The adult Animalians looked down at the hole in bewilderment.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
It took a remarkably short time for the police to be called as well as the Animalian Construction Company. The moles were busy digging up the hole, uncovering more towels. A small excavator would soon be pulling away more earth. This unexpected excavation drew a lot of attention from the apartment house&#39;s tenants and they were gathering outside to see what was being dug up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s another time capsule,&quot; said one tenant.<br />
<br />
&quot;There would be a record of it, wouldn&#39;t there?&quot; pointed out another tenant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be buried treasure,&quot; said a third tenant jokingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please. Pirate treasure in Nevada?&quot; asked the second tenant skeptically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who said it was pirate treasure? More likely a bank heist from way back. Heck, maybe it&#39;s a car,&quot; said the third tenant.<br />
<br />
Not long after, the buried item was uncovered more, enough to remove the towels (which there were a lot of) and reveal what it was. To everyone&#39;s shock, it <i>was</i> a car. A car that had been covered with towels, seams taped up, and more towels stuffed into the vents. Everyone was staring at the unexpected find with various looks of amazement. After taking a good look, the third tenant said, &quot;If you all will excuse me, I am suddenly tempted to try my luck at the casino.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;That car was buried for an insurance scam?&quot; asked one visitor incredulously, &quot;Most people would drive it into a lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I said,&quot; said Annie, &quot;I think that was the original plan, along with disassembling it and selling the parts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously, whoever owned it hired the wrong guys for the job,&quot; said Stuart, &quot;They buried the darn thing instead and were going to come back for it later. I don&#39;t know if they just forgot it or they were arrested before that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But being buried for decades must have ruined it,&quot; said another visitor.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t in great shape, no,&quot; said Annie, &quot;The windows weren&#39;t all the way rolled up so there was some interior damage. But one of my clients has an older brother who specializes in restoring and customizing old cars.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he not only got it running again, but he modified it for us to better fit in and gave it a new paint job,&quot; said Stuart, &quot;It&#39;s one heck of a wedding gift, I&#39;ll tell you that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Annie nodded. She was surprised how many of her friends were supportive of her marrying Stuart. They didn&#39;t think she was being a hypocrite and were really hoping the best for her. It was a little embarrassing for confident Annie to break down in happy tears, but she was just so overwhelmed. She was looking forward to driving this Ferrari around Maelewano, assuming they could transport the car overseas.</p>
