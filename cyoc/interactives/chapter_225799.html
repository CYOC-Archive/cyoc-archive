<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was an awkward and silent moment in the kitchen. Brittany doing everything she can to avoid both Jimmy and Allison as she was still suffering from her heat. The cold shower did help some, but only staved off her urges for a brief moment. She accepted the offer of an ice pack from her friend Allison and she promptly shoved the freezing cold object between her fury legs; making sure her swollen lips make contact as she quickly sat down.<br />
“Ooooooooh th… th… that’s c….c…..c….cold,” Brittany genuinely shivering; yet it did have an immediate effect as her burning desire to be mounted and bred abated for the moment. Accepting the cup of coffee with trepidation from Jimmy Proudhoof, her mate’s twin brother, a stag-deer furry; she sipped it as she watched both Allison and Jimmy make breakfast.<br />
<br />
“I thought you couldn’t cook,” Allison remarking as Jimmy was beating eggs while the bacon was frying on the skillet.<br />
“I can cook,” Jimmy smirking; “I just purposely act like I can’t just to put a bug up Jake’s craw.” Jimmy ending with a chuckle as he takes the bacon off of the skillet and dumps the scrambled eggs on the hot pan. “But try to get Jake to mix you an Old Fashion or a Mai Tai,” Jimmy adding some salt; “then be prepared to wretch as the drink is either too sweet or loaded with too much booze.”<br />
“Bug up my craw,” Jake entering the kitchen after hearing his twin brother&#39;s comment and seeing him at the stove; “so that cake you made last month; was that an accident or did you purposely mix chili powder instead of cinnamon in the batter?”<br />
“That was an accident. Both spices looked the same,” Jimmy remembering the cake he tried to make for their father’s birthday. A take on cinnamon sticky buns; but ended up being an evening of upset stomachs and massacred taste buds.<br />
“And I suppose the lasagna in the microwave for twenty minutes was a mistake,” Jake sitting next to Brittany and examining her make shift anti-heat ice pack.<br />
“No that was intentional,” Jimmy snickering; turning off the stove top and placing the eggs and bacon on four plates. “don’t forget the toast love,” Jimmy motioning Allison to the toaster.<br />
<br />
“If the eggs are crunchy,” Jake looking at his plate and then at Brittany; “you know who to blame.”<br />
“I’m not going to purposely inflict food poisoning on us,” Jimmy sitting across from his brother; “I may like to get a rise out of you, but I’m not out to personally hurt you.”<br />
“Small comfort there,” Jake taking his first bite of egg; finding it rather plain but palatable he continues to eat in silence.<br />
“What are your plans today,” Allison adding some jam to her toast while looking at Brittany.<br />
“Staying in,” Brittany quietly eating; while not feeling sociable, she was hungry.<br />
“We are both staying in,” Jake placing a comforting hoof-hand on his anthro gray wolf fury’s thigh. “We’ll watch some t.v and look online for our own place. I doubt dad will want us around now that he has found love again and will want to expand the family,” Jake looking at a nearby picture of their father Michael with their deceased mother Victoria; a picture showing their father as a human and not a stag-deer fury.<br />
“Mom did have property,” Jimmy commenting; “If I recall, she had a condo that she used for short term rentals as added income.”<br />
“I’ll look into it,” Jake nodding; feeling appreciative of the offer.<br />
“The house next door to mom and dad is for sale,” Allison speaking up; “I think I can get you in contact with the realtor if you are interested.”<br />
“That would be nice,” Jake nodding in thanks.<br />
<br />
The rest of breakfast was sat in silence as they chewed on the bacon and the remaining eggs. Jake getting up with his empty plate and Brittany’s he takes them to the dishwasher then escorts Brittany out to the living room.<br />
“She has it bad,” Jimmy breaking the silence; “even with that ice pack I could still smell her desire.”<br />
“Think of it as a warm up for what I might eventually go through,” Allison collect her’s and Jimmy’s plates; “best give them space for the time being.”<br />
“Wise,” Jimmy nodding; “At least I can hide at the restaurant for the day.”<br />
“Come to my parent’s home afterwards,” Allison answering; “we can spend the night there and decide what to do afterwards.”<br />
“You want a ride as I head out,” Jimmy getting up to embrace his mate as she does a little cleaning; “I can drop you off before going to work.”<br />
“Sure,” Allison smiling; “what time are you leaving?”<br />
“I’m leaving around noon,” Jimmy answering; “no lunch service on the weekends, so it is just dinner hours.”<br />
“That is a few hours from now,” Allison looking at the clock on the microwave; “what are going to do until then?”<br />
 “I can think of a few things,” Jimmy grinning as his hoof-hands trail down Allison tawny furred body and lingering just before her entrance.<br />
“Brittany’s pheromones put you in a randy mood,” Allison answering; the feeling of Jimmy’s cervine phallus poking her from behind as she instinctively wraps her tail around one of Jimmy’s legs. &quot;But let&#39;s save those amorous thoughts for later tonight,&quot; Allison pulling away; let&#39;s take a stroll downtown together.&quot;<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
It wasn’t long before Jake had Brittany sitting on a sofa and had the t.v remote as he started surfing through the channels. He scowled as there wasn’t anything worth watching at the early Saturaday morning hours. All that he could find was Daytime news and paid product promotion shows.<br />
“I have a streaming account,” Brittany speaking up; adjusting her position on the couch to be closer to Jake. “Plenty to watch and no commercials,” Brittany holding out a hand paw for the remote.<br />
“Have at it,” Jake handing over the object; “you need another ice pack, or a drink?”<br />
“Maybe later,” Brittany wrapping an arm around her mate as she keys in her login info on her streaming service; “right now I just want you next to me.”<br />
“What are we going to watch,” Jake getting a whiff of Brittany’s scent and getting aroused as he felt the need to take a deep breath.<br />
“A lovely little rom-com I’ve been meaning to see,” Brittany confirming her selection and placing the remote back on the table; purposely letting the ice pack fall away from her crotch. Her pheromones beginning to pool about in the room.<br />
<br />
“We’re leaving,” Jimmy speaking as he and Allison head to the front door; “if dad comes by, let him know we are going to stroll around downtown.”<br />
“Okay,” Jake nodding; his nostrils flaring as he gets another hit of Brittany’s intoxicating scent. He turns back to the T.V and tries to focus on the program that Brittany selected just as the door closes leaving him alone with the anthro wolf furry.<br />
“You know,” Brittany sighing as she snuggles closer to her mate; “I like these kind of movies. They always get me in the mood for a little fun.”<br />
“Is that why you put it on,” Jake feeling Brittany’s pheromones affecting him; making him subconsciously explore her body as he tries to focus on the plot.<br />
“I and Allison would usually make out and play with each other,” Brittany working her hand paw to Jake’s rising rod; “Nibbling each other’s sensitive nipples, sampling each other’s juices.”<br />
<br />
It was then that Jake realized the subtle trap he was caught it. Trapped alone with his mate; and anthro wolf in heat. Remembering the lust filled haze he experienced early in the woodland park and how he lost all control rutted like mad; he didn’t want a repeat of that, but still had a desire to make his mate comfortable.<br />
“Let’s just say we make our own romantic moment,” Jake looking at his mate as he invites her to sit on his lap; “we can always pick up the movie where we left off.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes,” Brittany needing no other cue as she climbs on her partner; taking a hand paw on his shaft and guiding it to her moistened entrance. She sighs and moans as she feels the shaft spreading her folds as Jake starts working to quench her heat.<br />
“That’s the ticket,” Brittany moaning as her breasts bounce in rhythmic synch to Jake’s gentle yet purposeful thrusting. “Don’t let up,” Brittany moans; leaning in to give him a kiss as her hand paws explore his back as his hoof-hands grip her waist.<br />
“Almost there,” Jake huffing; feeling the need to pick up speed as he begins to sense resistance.<br />
“Yes,” Brittany panting; “push through my cervix like before, fill me with your seed!”<br />
“As. You. Wish!” Jake grunting with each thrust as his fury balls clench and he feels the usual rush race through his shaft just as Brittany clamps down and gasps as she feels her orgasm washing over her.<br />
<br />
“I think it’s safe to say,” Jake speaking as Brittany slowly climbs off of him; her entrance leaking the combine juices of her honey and his cum; “that you are well on your way to being pregnant.”<br />
“I placed an online order earlier for a home pregnancy test and few other things,” Brittany panting as she grabs the ice pack and places it back on her still heated sex; “they should be here tomorrow.”<br />
“You seem confident that this is only going to last two days,” Jake pausing the movie as he looks at her.<br />
“I&#39;m not. But if it is anything like mating cycles for most animals,” Brittany smiling as she watches Jake’s shaft soften and slowly retreat back to its sheath; “the fertilized ovum should already be well on its way to my womb. These extra sessions are just the cherry on top of my cream pie,” Brittany adding; turning her attention back to the paused movie, she rests her head on Jake’s shoulder. She manages to reach the remote and resumes play of the romantic movie they were watching.</p>
