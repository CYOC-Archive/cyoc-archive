<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Judy pushed her stroller through the mall, she realized that she was looking at everyone from a new perspective. Of course, she had a literal new perspective, considering that she was now twice as old as the girl she had been that morning. The other change in her perspective came from the powerful little red balloon she held in her hand. When Judy looked at people now, she saw all of the possible ways she could transform them with the balloon. It felt amazing.<br />
<br />
“Judy?” said the baby below her.<br />
<br />
“Quiet,” she replied, not bothering to look at her new daughter. “I’m thinking.”<br />
<br />
“Please don’t do this,” the baby said. “I get that you did this to me, but these are just strangers. They don’t deserve this.”<br />
<br />
Judy was getting annoyed. “Quiet.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s just go home. We can make ourselves norm…”<br />
<br />
“Shut up!” she said a bit too loudly. Some people passing by stared at them. She stopped the stroller, walked around in front of it and knelt down to stare Jim in the face. “Now, you listen to me,” she said, pointing at the baby threateningly. “I don’t want to hear about Mom and Dad or strangers or anything anymore from you. I will turn you into a newborn baby if I hear one more word out of your mouth. Do you understand?”<br />
<br />
The baby nodded.<br />
<br />
“Good girl,” she said and then stood up and started pushing the stroller again. After a minute, she had cooled down and felt ready to find a new target.<br />
<br />
Two girls walked by. Judy could tell immediately that they were sisters. They resembled each other and wore their blonde hair the same, long and straight. The also wore similar short shorts and tank tops. The older sister was blessed with a nice pair of breasts and almost a foot of extra height above her younger sister, mostly in her legs. The tall one looked to be about 16, while the younger sister looked to be about 11.<br />
<br />
“Can we stop at Victoria’s Secret?” the little sister said.<br />
<br />
“Why would you need to go there?” said the older sister. “You’re flat as a board.”<br />
<br />
“Mom said I would need a training bra soon.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe in another year.”<br />
<br />
Frustrated, the younger sister replied, “I’m starting to grow there.”<br />
<br />
“Those mosquito bites?” said the older sister, with a disparaging smirk. “They don’t look like much to me.” The older sister did have an impressive pair of breasts to compare with her younger sister’s. The younger sister just blushed and looked embarrassed and frustrated.<br />
<br />
Judy could clearly see the relationship here. The younger sister obviously idolized her older sister. She even tried to dress like her. It just didn’t seem fair that her older sister was so much older than her.<br />
<br />
Judy had her first target.<br />
<br />
She blew some air into the balloon and said, “Control that older girl’s age.” She started to let air out of the balloon slowly as she watched the older girl. She still wasn’t sure if using “older girl” as a target would actually work, but, in a few seconds, she had proof that it did. The older sister was clearly getting smaller. Her once impressive chest had started to deflate as her long legs had shorted noticeably. Soon, the two girls were much closer together in height. A few seconds later, and the older girl tripped. Her newly loose sneaker had caught on the floor and made her lose her balance. Her little sister caught her as she was falling.<br />
<br />
“Whoa,” said the little sister. “Are you all right?”<br />
<br />
When they both stood up straight, the girls discovered that the older sister was not “all right.” They stood eye to eye with each other now, and stared at each other in silent amazement.<br />
<br />
Smiling, Judy said, “Release.”<br />
<br />
The once older sister was now her formerly younger sister’s twin. Aside from the one sister’s loose clothes and clearly deflated bra under her shirt, the two looked almost identical now.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on,” said the formerly older sister in a voice that nearly matched her younger sister’s.<br />
<br />
“You…,” said the formerly younger sister. “You shrank. You’re younger. You look like you’re my age now.”<br />
<br />
“What?” squeaked the formerly older one as she looked down at her baggy clothes and grabbed her flat chest with horror in her eyes. “No,” she said. “Impossible... I can’t… This can’t… My boobies… Oh, God!”<br />
<br />
The formerly younger one put an arm around her horrified sister’s shoulders and sincerely tried to comfort her. “Don’t worry. You can borrow some of my clothes.”<br />
<br />
The other sister started to cry.<br />
<br />
Judy smiled and pushed her stroller as she walked away. “Who’s next?” she said to herself, satisfied. That had been a real rush. She wanted more.<br />
<br />
Below her she heard a sound like a huff or a disapproving grunt.<br />
<br />
“What did I say about talking?” Judy said looking down at Jim.<br />
<br />
The baby girl below just pointed to her own closed mouth and then crossed her arms and stared off into the distance.<br />
<br />
Judy pressed on and soon found her next targets at the window of the Victoria’s Secret that the other girls had been talking about. Three 13-year-old girls were standing there looking at the merchandise and chatting about it, one brunette, one blonde, and one redhead. Two of the girls had impressive breasts for their age. The third was as flat-chested as a little girl.<br />
<br />
“Oooh,” said the stout brunette with the biggest breasts. “I like the blue one.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” said the taller blonde with her slightly smaller breasts. “But, check out that pink one.”<br />
<br />
“It’s nice,” said the flat-chested redhead. “Probably too expensive, though. Maybe we should just go to the Gap or something.”<br />
<br />
The other two girls looked at each other and smirked. “How about you go to the Gap and check out the tops in the children’s section?” said the brunette.<br />
<br />
“Ouch,” said the blonde. “Burn.” The two high fived and laughed a bit as the redhead blushed.<br />
<br />
Standing a short distance away, Judy said to herself, “Girls can be so cruel sometimes, even to their friends.”<br />
<br />
“Watch our stuff. We’re going in,” said the blonde girl as she and the brunette put down their bags next to the redhead. They walked into the store leaving the redhead alone to wait. She looked so sad.<br />
<br />
Watching all of this, Judy said, “Well, let’s see if I can fix this situation.” She held up the balloon. “Control the redhead’s breast size.” She started blowing and the redhead’s breasts swelled. FFFFFFOOOOOFF. The redhead gasped as she felt her training bra get very tight on her suddenly. She quickly unhooked it as her breasts expanded to a size just slightly larger than her friends were.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God!” she said as she stared at her enormous new breasts. They had to be at least C-cups.<br />
<br />
“Release,” said Judy, then she smiled. “Now it’s time for the real fun. Control the breast size of the other two girls.” She let the balloon deflate in a loud raspberry.<br />
<br />
A pair of shrieks erupted from inside the store. Seconds later the blonde and the brunette came running out. Both of them were flat as a board on top now. They were mumbling incoherently about their lost breasts.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God!” the redhead repeated as she saw her two friends. “You changed too!”<br />
<br />
The two girls looked at the redhead and gasped in amazement and envy when they saw her huge breasts.<br />
<br />
Judy walked off with her stroller, leaving the girls to cry, shout, and accuse each other.<br />
<br />
“Release,” Judy said. She had never felt such a rush of power like this before. “More. I need more.”<br />
<br />
Seeing a muscular tall guy who looked like a high school football player with a petite blonde girl clutching his arm, Judy decided to try another trade. She filled up the balloon and said, “Control that guy’s height and muscle size.” She let the balloon deflate and watched the big guy shrink to the size of his girlfriend. The couple both gasped in shock. He looked like a skinny little wimp now in too large clothes. “Release,” said Judy. “Control that girl’s height and muscle size.” FFFFFOOOOOFFFF. Judy blew the balloon back up to the size it had been before she’d shrunk the big guy. The girl’s clothes ripped as her body stretched taller and her muscles swelled. When the growing stopped, she stood as tall as her boyfriend had been and had muscles just as big as his had been. Standing in her shredded clothes and feeling stunned, the enormous blonde girl just looked down at her buff body in wonder and awe, while her shrunken boyfriend looked up at her in horror. He barely looked big enough to be in high school now.<br />
<br />
“Release,” Judy said, feeling giddy.<br />
<br />
A mother and her 7-year-old daughter walked by. A few seconds of playing with the balloon and Judy had reversed their sizes. The shrunken mother gazed up in horror at her giant daughter, who whimpered, “Mommy?” down at her.<br />
<br />
A rowdy bunch of five teenage boys walked by, loudly chatting, laughing, and pushing each other around. They all had baggy pants on, showing off the top of their underwear. Seconds later they all found themselves to be suddenly squeaky preschoolers tangled up in absurdly baggy teenager clothes.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” said Judy. The rush was amazing. “More.”<br />
<br />
A trio of skinny teenage girls eating ice cream suddenly found their clothes bursting as they rapidly became 100 pounds fatter.<br />
<br />
A 6’ tall woman shrank into a stout 3’ tall dwarf.<br />
<br />
An 8-year-old girl quickly sprouted into adulthood right before her mother and brother’s eyes. A few seconds later her surprised 10-year-old brother shrank into a crying baby.<br />
<br />
A crowd had started to form in response to all of the shouting and crying. Some people had witnessed the changes and were trying to help the affected people. Others were just staring in amazement at the oddly shaped people in ill fitting clothes. Judy wanted to continue, but she knew she had to get away before someone pointed their finger at the woman with the balloon. She turned and walked off with her stroller and listened as the commotion behind her got further away. A security guard rushed past her toward the crowd, but she paid him no mind. She just kept walking smiling her secret smile.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” she said, once she had turned a corner. She had decided that she wanted to hear Jim complain about her actions, just so she could laugh at his helplessness again. “I’ll let you talk this once,” she said without looking down. “Tell me what you think of my work back there?”<br />
<br />
There was no reply.<br />
<br />
“Talk, Jim. What did you…?” she started to say but stopped when she looked down at the stroller and found it empty.<br />
<br />
Judy looked around frantically, but the baby was nowhere in sight. Jim was gone.<br />
<br />
“Jim!” she called, and then corrected herself. “I mean, Jamie! Where are you?” She looked and listened, but there was still no sign of the baby anywhere. “You’d better get back here right now, Jamie, if you ever want to be back to normal again.” The rush of power she had felt was fading, while her anger was rising. That little jerk must have snuck off while she was transforming all of those people. She had to find her before that jerk told on her to someone.<br />
<br />
“Jamie!” she shouted. “Where are you?”<br />
<br />
“Ma’am?” said a security guard near her. “Can I help you?”<br />
<br />
Judy was worried for a second that he might be there to catch her for what she’d done with the balloon, but then she remembered that she was an adult now and that she was looking for a lost child, her daughter. “My daughter is lost,” she said. “Can you help me find her?”<br />
<br />
“Certainly,” he said. “Show me where you last saw her.”<br />
<br />
As Judy and the security guard walked off, she considered what punishments her little “daughter” had earned. Jim was going to be in big trouble when she found her.</p>
