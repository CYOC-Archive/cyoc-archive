<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While prom wasn&#39;t too far away for WSA&#39;s student body with finals and the last days of school about two weeks after prom, a fair number of other events continued to play out. For Herman and Jason, this related many of the other issues that had been there since their conversion. When Jason became a Great White Shark Animalian and Herman an Orca, the two had considered themselves two normal homosexual men, living life together and being happy with their partner, regardless of his choice in Animalian to be. The only problem they&#39;d had been contracting Herpes, which had been their reason for signing up for Project Phoenix in the first place.<br />
<br />
However, after their conversions, they&#39;d soon found out that becoming Animalians opened up new desires and new longings. Things that neither had considered them an issue they&#39;d ever have to deal with before. After all, they&#39;d both always known what they were interested in before, but becoming Animalians changed that and in surprising ways. They knew what women looked like and they knew that there were many men who found them sexually attractive, but before their conversions they&#39;d never figured that THEY would be among them. It didn&#39;t help that all Animalians seemed to be built to attract the opposite gender. It was something that had been worrying for both of them.<br />
<br />
That had soon brought them into Homosexuals Anonymous in addition to their various acclimation classes, which had included its fair share of counseling and encouragement that the growing &quot;bisexual&quot; urges they were now feeling wasn&#39;t the end of Herman and Jason. It would mean there would be some new urges that would be there, but those urges weren&#39;t bad and didn&#39;t mean they wouldn&#39;t be able to stay together. The two males accepted that, but they didn&#39;t want to get into anything that would separate them. They didn&#39;t become Animalians to cure their homosexuality, regardless of what some people in the present government felt on the issue. <br />
<br />
This complicated some things and it was agreed that Herman and Jason would get an opportunity to learn first hand that acting on their new urges wouldn&#39;t break the bonds of love that they had. They had been paired up with another couple that in many ways seemed to have been going through the same things as Herman and Jason. Madam Matryoshka had set them up with a Moxie and Arlene, who had apparently been having some of the same issues after their conversion. Like Herman and Jason, Moxie, a Great White Animalian, and Arlene, an Orca Animalian had been wrestling with many of the same issues, though in reverse. They were suddenly finding themselves a bit more into men than they were used to being. <br />
<br />
Much of the match up seemed to be more of a &quot;test&quot; to show that real love and sexual desire weren&#39;t necessarily the same thing. A lot of that sort of thing played out, particularly as Herman and Arlene and Jason and Moxie went on a few dates. It started with things like dinner and a movie, or even some workout routines at the Claw Coliseum. It was all fairly harmless, but both pairs often found that each found some attraction to their opposite gender partner, the things that always came back to the conversation was always on their same gender partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... he&#39;s really thought of it as sort of show on par with what Sea World did?&quot; Moxie asked to Jason at one of Animalia&#39;s steakhouses and giggling a bit when she saw Arlene raise an eyebrow while looking to Herman.<br />
<br />
&quot;He really had the idea...&quot; Jason nodded, &quot;but in a way, it&#39;s not like it would be a bad thing. The reference to it being like Sea World is funny, but it&#39;d work a lot like synchronized swimming and that could be quite artistic. Herman would be good at that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t synchronized swimming be more of a woman&#39;s sport?&quot; Arlene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a land where all should be equal,&quot; Herman commented, &quot;it should not matter what one&#39;s gender is if that is what one wants to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ll always support you,&quot; Jason assured him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know... you two are a lot like me and Moxie,&quot; Arlene said slowly, &quot;totally together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In spite of you different species choices,&quot; Moxie commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what makes it fun,&quot; Jason gave a toothy smile that earned a chuckle or two.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I think I met a female Animalian who&#39;s been teaching some of those sorts of skills,&quot; Herman answered, &quot;I think she&#39;s an otter... or maybe a mink... I&#39;m not really sure... but she&#39;s been teaching those interested in some of those sorts of skills, moving together. It could lead to something if we can find enough that would be willing to go along with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ll be there for you,&quot; Jason assured Herman.<br />
<br />
&quot;As will your friends,&quot; said Arlene.<br />
<br />
&quot;With benefits,&quot; finished Moxie<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d still...?&quot; Jason began as he glanced over to Moxie who gave a coy smile back at him when his eyes drifted down to the impressive valley that was her cleavage that her V-necked shirt flaunted.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve both flirted and flaunted somethings with you two,&quot; Moxie admitted, &quot;some of it a test and some of it genuine interest... and strangely a real part of us is quite happy that some of that flirtation has been returned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;ve both soon returned to each other,&quot; Arlene agreed, &quot;quite loyal and quite loving. Not something Moxie and I want to break up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we&#39;ve asked around... and it would appear that a few of those that have been in Homosexuals Anonymous have been quite into more open relationships,&quot; Moxie smiled, &quot;the two that are putting together the Kat&#39;s Klub over in Lyre... They&#39;ve been in the program, and seem to be just as in love today as they were before they joined Animalia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But they&#39;ve had some fun with some of the male big cat Animalians, and even a foursome with two Zebra Animalians, one female, one male,&quot; Arlene finished and almost chuckled when both Herman and Jason&#39;s eyes practically bulged out of their heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;A foursome...&quot; Jason said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And they&#39;re both still together and with each other,&quot; Moxie smiled, &quot;which means we could have some fun... tonight, even, and it wouldn&#39;t change who we love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finishing dinner wasn&#39;t too hard, and the four of them soon arranged to return the apartment that Jason and Herman had. Both males had some sense of anticipation, though also some nervousness. After all, while both Herman and Jason were loyal to each other, there was some eagerness to find out about what it would be like. And being that they&#39;d never been with women before, sexually, there was some nervousness that they wouldn&#39;t be any good. Arlene and Moxie were a bit nervous too, but Arlene actually found herself smiling at the tent Herman was pitching in his pants. If that was a sign of things to come, even if they only remained &quot;friends with benefits,&quot; the benefits would well be worth it. And while there may have been a plan to make it to the bedroom, none of them made it that far before passionate kisses and nuzzles were exchanged and clothing was very nearly torn off.</p>
