<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mason Harris and his dog Fenrir, had arrived at the Superior Church&#39;s HQ not too long after S.P.E.A.R. had also arrived and Fukushu had begun his attack on the Superior Church soldiers. They merged into their hybrid form with their sword ready and carefully made their way inside. As soon as they entered, they heard many voices inside screaming and shouting, they were either giving orders or shouting warnings, or screaming. Mason made his way through the warehouse, until he found a member of the Superior Church that was just barely alive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Fukushu? Where is he?&quot; Mason asked growling through his teeth to look intimidating.<br />
<br />
&quot;F.....fu....fu....fuc......you.....&quot; The soldier said barely able to speak before he passed out. Mason felt the man&#39;s pulse to make sure he was still alive.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s alive, but barely, he was stupidly lucky that he missed the end of Uncle&#39;s blade.&quot; Mason said to himself and to an extent, Fenrir.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is somewhere in this building, we can find him. Smell the air for his scent.&quot; Fenrir suggested as Mason now sniffed the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can smell him,&quot; Mason said as he sniffed the air again. &quot;He&#39;s not too far away, and I can also smell,&quot; Mason took in a deeper breath. &quot;Akira? He&#39;s here too? He must&#39;ve heard about what Uncle was doing.&quot; Mason now took one more sniff and made his way through the warehouse.<br />
<br />
As he ran, he saw several S.P.E.A.R. agents looking dazed but alive, and searching through the dead Superior Church bodies to find living ones and arrest the ones that were still alive. As Mason made his way, he helped out a few S.P.E.A.R. agents by knocking out the Superior Church members non-lethally, they gave Mason a thank you nod as he went off to try and find Akira and Fukushu.<br />
<br />
As Mason was knocking out a few more soldiers making his way through the warehouse, he suddenly came upon three Superior Church soldiers that looked massive in their gear as their muscles showed through their suits. Mason readied his sword, knowing that these three were definitely going to be tough to deal with.<br />
<br />
Before Mason had a chance to swing his sword at the soldiers, ice suddenly started forming at the bottom of the soldier&#39;s feet and made its way up to the soldier&#39;s waists freezing them hard into the spot. Mason knew that this wasn&#39;t him at all and looked around and saw his mothers, brother, sisters, as well as Nyx coming up behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason!&quot; Mika shouted with joy as she saw her son alive and wrapped her arms around her son.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m alright mother, I&#39;m alright.&quot; Mason said patting his mother on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Young man, you are going to be in so much trouble when we get home.&quot; Claudia said crossing her arms but then gave Mason a smile and a small hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m just glad that you&#39;re safe.&quot; Claudia said breaking away from the hug and putting her hand on Mason&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, but I can&#39;t stay and talk, I have to find Uncle Fukushu and stop him.&quot; Mason said holding his sword low.<br />
<br />
Mika and Claudia, as well as his siblings, and Nyx all looked concerned about this notion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, your uncle was like this before long before you were born, when he gets like this....&quot; Mika began to say before stopping with a sigh unable to finish.<br />
<br />
&quot;When he gets like this, with his mind set at killing his enemies, there&#39;s almost no way to stop him. So we&#39;re going with you to stop him.&quot; Claudia said as they stepped forward to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry mom, but I need to do this by myself, Uncle Fukushu is just doing this because he believes it&#39;s the only way to keep me safe and only I can get through to him.&quot; Mason argued with his mom stepping back a little bit.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, many Superior Church members rounded around the corner and raised their guns at Nyx and the Harris family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Freeze you animal freaks!&quot; A Superior Church soldier shouted at all of them.<br />
<br />
Nyx and the Harris family didn&#39;t pay them any mind as Mika and Claudia looked towards their son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moms, please, let me do this. Believe in me.&quot; Mason asked with his kind eyes that they could always see in their son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be safe my brave little boy.&quot; Mika said with a smile as Mason smiled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;TIME FOR SOME ASS KICKING, FAMILY!&quot; Claudia shouted as she, Mika, Aaron, Haley, Kari, and Nyx all began fighting the Superior Church members while allowing Mason the chance to run and find Fukushu.<br />
<br />
Claudia took a breath, summoning forth her fiery tigress avatar. The massive creature now pausing as it stared at Claudia. The petite sorceress pointing at a group of soldiers. Nodding, the fiery tigress sprinted towards a group of soldiers, attacking with ruthless aggression and protecting S.P.E.A.R.<br />
<br />
As Claudia&#39;s avatar engaged the Superior Church, the petite blonde glared at the approaching soldiers. With a wave of her hand, Claudia summoned forth a trio of flaming swords that levitated in front of her. Claudia now marched forward, sending the swords rocketing forward, spinning like flaming saw blades, which collided with the soldiers like fiery concussion grenades. As they fell, Mika summoned forth a spell of her own, securing the stunned soldiers within a bubble of ice. Taking a moment, both mothers took a moment to see if their children were okay.<br />
<br />
Haley and Kari were fighting each other back to back as they took out some more soldiers, they suddenly found themselves confronted by a couple of formidable foes, that were tough and actually made Haley&#39;s lips bleed.<br />
<br />
Before the soldiers could do anymore damage to the girls, they soldiers were disabled from behind by the sudden arrival of two familiar kitsunes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ikuro!&quot; Haley cheered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Genki, my hero!&quot; Kari equally cheered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry we were a little late getting here. We were taking in a drink at a human bar together when Akira called us about what was going on. Did we miss much?&quot; Genki apologized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, just the usual, our uncle went nuts, my brother is trying to be the hero at stopping him, while we&#39;re neutralizing a bunch of these soldiers. S.P.E.A.R. is also around here, so no killing anybody.&quot; Haley explained as they went back to fighting.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is any of that usual?&quot; Ikuro asked in confusion.<br />
<br />
Haley and Ikuro fought well together side by side like a well trained pair taking out the soldier&#39;s with their combined strength, while Genki and Kari were better being technical fighters.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at that honey, our girls certainly know how to pick boyfriends. Kari! Haley! After this is all over, I want a wedding from you both asap!&quot; Claudia jokingly shouted as she fought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom!&quot; Haley and Kari both shouted blushing at their mother&#39;s comment.<br />
<br />
Mika and Claudia also looked to see Aaron and Nyx were also engaged with their own battle against the soldiers, but the two acted like they were in a dance as the two fought the soldiers while at the same time confusing them. To the two of them, it was almost like their first dance all over again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our son has also chosen a girl who&#39;s a very fierce fighter. She kind of reminds me of someone when I was younger.&quot; Mika said to Claudia who smirked.<br />
<br />
The soldiers were becoming fewer and soon enough their fight would be at an end and they would try and catch up with Mason hoping that he had managed to get through to Fukushu before they reached him.</p>
