<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty's new something had happened to him.  Was it just the fact that he was fifteen or did something recent cause it and him turning 15 just be a coincidence?  &quot;What to do next?&quot; he thought about it for a while, Dustin was taken care of, at least for a little while.  So how about June? maybe Mark? Or himself?  It was a hard decision but he concluded it best try it out on someone other than himself or a while before he targeted his own mind and body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think June is up for a little fun&quot; he smiled as he headed for the kitchen&quot; his foster mother was in the process of kissing Mark goodbye.  &quot;I'll see you tonight&quot; she winked.  Ty almost gagged.  With their goodbyes out of the way June returned to the kitchen table to read the paper.  &quot;Typical&quot; Ty sighed, if sh wasn't bitching at him she was bitching at the world.  As he watched, Sam, Dustin's golden retrieve walked into the kitchen, and then Ty got a wonderful idea.  &quot;I wish Sam was extremely attracted to June, and the more she denies his advance the more of a bitch she'll become.  Suddenly Sam seemed to quick fixate on June.  He waddled over and placed his nose between her legs.  &quot;Sam! What's gotten into you boy&quot; she laughed.  &quot;Go on, shew mommy's reading the newspaper&quot; with that Sam walked away turning back once and a while to look at June. <br />
<br />
&quot;Silly dog&quot; June laughed and a strange wave hit her.  It felt odd to her sitting at the table all of a sudden. So she headed to the living room and sat in the chair, yet that to felt wrong, as if she was doing something wrong.  &quot;Just can't seem to get cozy today&quot; June then sat on the floor and continued to read.  &quot;That's better&quot; she flipped page after page, and as if he new she was more accessible now Sam came flying into the living room.  He suck he nose right between her legs, this time rubbing her just right for she let out a soft cry of pleasure.  &quot;Sam! Bad dog go outside, bad do...&quot; before she could finish she could smell something in the air, like a musty cologne.  &quot;What's that smell?&quot; her nose pushed outward the tip slowly turning black. June's eyes met Sam's dripping dick.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sam... why... I feel... funny&quot; she tried to hold herself back but she lost to her animal lust.  Her now much longer tongue licked up the cum beneath his dick, and suddenly reality came back to her. &quot;What am I doing!&quot; she spit out what little hadn't been swallowed. &quot;I did just lick...&quot; then she felt a itchy feeling just above her ass.  As she itched she could feel the start of a tail.  About five inches in length and covered lightly in long golden fur.  &quot;What's happening to me&quot; June raced to the bathroom. She then saw her face and screamed.<br />
<br />
Ty looked on as his mom transformed.  As of now she looked like a anthro-dog girl.  Her tail now a whopping 2 feet long and covered in thick golden fur.  Her face a mix between dog and human, and her body lightly patched in golden fur.  Her feet had started to change as well, while her hands retained much of their original shape.  Ty was over whelmed.  He reached into his pants and rubbed member.  &quot;Why whats going on with me&quot; then June heard a bark.  Sam was outside the door rolled over, his penis fully erect.  &quot;You, you did this to me, but how?&quot; June started to cry and fell onto her knees. Her legs continued to change.  &quot;No! I don't want to be a dog, I don't to have sex with Sam, please I... I&quot; her mouth pushed out farther, and her tongue changed making it difficult to talk.  Her hip cracked and legs shortened to fit her canine needs.  From her waist down she was completely canine.  <br />
<br />
She looked back at herself and howled in disgusted, Ty and Sam ready to burst from pleasure.  &quot;NOOOARRROOOOW!&quot; she howled.  Her hands lost their feminine shape and her thumbs pushed up into her arms.  June whined as the transformation continued.  She waddled away from Sam thinking he was the cause of her transformation, but the further she got the more drawn to him she felt.  June whined the last tear fell from her eye.  She was a female dog through an through, a real bitch.<br />
<br />
Scared June raced for her room and hid under her bed.  Ty followed her staying out of sight as best as he could.  Sam waddled into the room sniffing around for his potential mate.  June stayed as quiet as she could, licking at her moist canine vagina.  As she licked she feared he'd find her, fuck her, and then she'd be stuck like this, but as she hid her mind began to change, its desires, thoughts, and wants all began to rewire.  Suddenly June had forgotten why she was running and came out of hiding to Sam waiting patiently outside.  June bared her teeth, who was this dog to make her his mate she thought, then she could smell his must.  It was truly a breathtaking aroma.  Suddenly she let her guard down and approached him.<br />
<br />
June kept her eyes on Sam as she grew closer.  With a quick sniff of his as and groin, June turned and offered herself to Sam.  Sam finally achieved his goal.  He mounted his prize.  Junes mind flooded with ecstasy.  Never in her small mind felt so much pleasure.  Ty continued to walk a little offset. &quot;Did I go to far?&quot; he walked away from the two dogs and down stairs.  His penis was still erect from watching June and Sam.  &quot;I have to change her back, but I think I wait till their done.&quot; Ty laughed thinking about what it would look like seeing his human foster mom having with a dog.<br />
<br />
As he rounded the corner Dustin flew from the kitchen.  &quot;Okay ass-hole what did you do, put estrogen into my lunch yesterday or something?&quot; Ty just laughed.  &quot;Estrogen couldn't do that much in one day stupid&quot; Ty smiled. &quot;But I did make you this way&quot; he laughed seeing Dustin light up like a neon sign.  &quot;I knew it! Wait till I tell my mom you'll be out on your ass!&quot; &quot;Calm down stupid, I can fix it, if I want to, and I don't think you want to bug mommy right now, she's not exactly herself at the moment&quot; Ty walked passed Dustin with a smile. &quot;Get back here!  Fix this now!  I have the body of a 13 year old!&quot; Dustin screamed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure are whinny today Dustin, that gives me an idea. I wish Dustin was a girl, you seem a little prissy to me anyway.  And to make it all better, I also wish he was very attractive and meat head men were drawn to her&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin's face light up as red as an apple.  &quot;You little&quot; suddenly Dustin's hips were wider, and his ass more supple and round.  &quot;No, this can't be real&quot; his voice was already female.  &quot;That isn't me, it cannot be!&quot; suddenly his clothes changed, and two C cups began forming.  Standing before Ty was a very pretty 17 year old girl.  Her Onyx hair shimmered in the light and accented her tan skin and pink tank top and tan skirt.  &quot;I'm a girl!&quot; Dustin screamed.  &quot;How did you!&quot; &quot;The same as the last two times&quot; &quot;Last two, what do you mean last two?&quot; as if to answer Dustin's question Sam and June darted down the stairs still immersed in wooing the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dustin meet June, the new family bitch!&quot; Ty laughed as Sam mounted her again.  &quot;June, you mean, MOM!&quot; Dustin looked at the two dogs.  &quot;You turned our mother into a dog!&quot; &quot;Your mother, all she was every to me was a slave driver, I just turned 15 and got nothing while they shower you in gits all the time.  I'm sick of being the underdog, now its her time to shine&quot; Ty laughed.  Dustin ran over to the dog.  &quot;Mom stop it your having sex with Sammy, please mom quit it!&quot; Dustin tried to push Sam off but to no success.  &quot;Reverse this now Ty, she can't stay like this!&quot; Ty just turned and walked away.  &quot;Ty!&quot;<br />
<br />
As he left the living room Ty felt guilt all of a sudden, did he take this to far.  Yes both Dustin and June were horrible people but this mad him worse.  &quot;I have to turn them...&quot; that's when he heard Dustin scream.<br />
<br />
Ty ran toward the living room.  When he got their Dustin was on all fours and Sam on top.  Ty burst into laughter.  &quot;How in the hell did..&quot; &quot;I push him off mom but fell over, and I wasn't wearing any underwear and he must of thought I was mom! Get him off!&quot; Ty just kept laughing as Sam humped his new foster sister.  June was off to the side relaxing, she looked beat from the constant sex.  Sam how ever was ready to go.  &quot;Ty! Ah!&quot; Dustin came. &quot;He won't stop!&quot; yet Sam still wanted more.  &quot;Give a couple hours he'll get tired.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty watch as Sam had his way with Dustin.  IT last a good 45 minutes.  Finally same dismounted Dustin and laid on the floor.  Dustin tried to stand but her body felt like rubber.  Ty simply walked away.  As he headed for his room a car could be heard pulling into the drive.  From the sound it was Mark coming home, but why?<br />
Mark marched into the kitchen mud room.  <br />
<br />
Dustin heard her enter the house.  &quot;Dad...&quot; she whispered still out of it.  June just happily liked herself clean as Sam rested from his wild morning.<br />
<br />
Ty met Mark at the door.  &quot;Sup Mark&quot; Ty smiled.  &quot;What the hell are you still doing her boy, school started an hour ago!&quot; Mark slipped his shoes off.  &quot;Thought I'd just skip today&quot; &quot;Is that so, well I hope you don't mind me calling the police then will you.&quot; Mark got right into Ty's face.  &quot;You fucked up for the last time kid&quot; &quot;On the contrary my dear Watson, you did&quot; Mark just laughed &quot;What the hell are...&quot; Mark's eyes left Ty and fixed on Dustin standing in the door way.  &quot;Dad he...&quot; she was still tired from earlier.  &quot;And you brought a hooker, oh it keeps getting better, wheres the hemp, crack, and acid boy!&quot; he slapped Ty hard.  Dustin fell on to the floor.  &quot;Dad he...&quot; Ty just smiled.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish Dustin was really horny, and Mark was her only play thing of her choice.&quot; &quot;What the fuck are you babbling about now boy! Aw damn sluts pissing on my floor.  When I'm done with you boy you'll...&quot; &quot;Strap on dildo!&quot; Dustin screamed out.  &quot;Shut up hor...&quot; but he was cut short as his mouth sealed shut.  Marks arms went limp and his face became flat.  His legs fused as did his arms.  His body shrank yet his penis became hard and longer.  In his place was a strap-on dildo.  Dustin grabbed her father and shoved him into her vagina.  &quot;Ah!&quot; she cried.  &quot;Now that poetic justice right there&quot;.<br />
<br />
Dustin continued to play with herself, and then turned to Ty.  &quot;Please play with me! I beg you play with me....</p>
