<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katherine gave a low whistle as and Malice made their way into the Chinese Embassy on the new Animalian Colony. It wasn&#39;t huge, by any means, but it did carry some obvious symbolism in the entry area and the room they were lead to by the present guards, which included a full on image that represented the present regime on mainland China with a portrait of Mao on one side of the emblem and the present Chinese President on the other side. It carried its own political implications, as the Taiwan government was not considered, but then at the same time, given China and Japan&#39;s issues going back to World War II, the fact that they were willing to build it on a small island that was still part of Japan was intriguing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Impressive, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Malice commented as the two began to set up the tripod for their camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;For its overall size? Yes,&quot; Katherine answered, remembering the point that they didn&#39;t want to antagonize the participating governments and the embassy&#39;s representative and his interpreter was standing with him.<br />
<br />
As they finished, Malice hit the record button and both she and Katherine approached the two Chinese government representatives. There were a few select handshakes as they got started.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Mary Alice Wesley, though I prefer Malice, combining my first and middle name,&quot; Malice introduced herself, &quot;but I bear no malice. And this is one Animalia Ambassadoria&#39;s newest members, Katherine Keuchel. We&#39;d like to ask a few small questions China&#39;s participation in this colony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Fang Tao,&quot; the embassy leader spoke after his interpreter translated Malice&#39;s introduction and shook hands with both Malice and Katherine, &quot;and I would be happy to answer basic questions, and particularly in the hopes that Animalia will open a colony on Chinese soil.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, China is still looking for that?&quot; Katherine asked after the interpreter gave them Fang&#39;s answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Fang responded, &quot;Your company... Horizon has produced great progress in science and its applications, as demonstrated by Animalia&#39;s success. And we feel that by participating here, we may open doors and avenues for eventual cooperation between the People&#39;s Republic of China and Animalia, which in the end will benefit all of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that sounds very... cooperative,&quot; Malice commented, though &quot;cooperative&quot; ultimately sounded like a question as she was looking for the right word to say, &quot;and you&#39;ll work with the colony government and with the Japanese embassy across the street?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fang nodded, &quot;We would hope and prefer that the colony&#39;s laws and policies treat all in the colony according to their local custom... or the customs of their homeland and not try to impose Japan&#39;s culture on those that come here that are of Chinese descent... But, in order to accomplish that we will have to meet and talk. Hiding behind a Great Wall will not help any of us. In fact, I would think that if this colony succeeds, it may perhaps open the door to direct and improving relations between China and Japan... as symbolized by the successes that Animalia has already managed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can all hope for that,&quot; Katherine gave a genuine smile at that.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Across the street, Travis and Johan had a similar meeting with the Japanese embassy minister, a Rika Iramato. Unlike the meeting at the Chinese embassy, which had been in a room that was likely intended for major press releases to the Chinese state media, this meeting was in a smaller conference room with Travis and Johan on one side of a wooden desk and Rika and her translator on the other. There were windows behind Rika from which Travis and Johan could see the island&#39;s northern coast, though the camera had been set up to look down the table and frame both the interviewers and the Japanese government representatives in the shot.<br />
<br />
&quot;To answer your question,&quot; Rika spoke in Japanese. She knew some English, but not enough to really speak it well, &quot;Japan generally hopes that this colony would serve as a continued springboard for success and cooperation between Japan and Animalia... both with regard to establishing other colonies and communities and a prospect where all may flourish. And I would think that things are progressing well in that regard. The National History Museum in Tokyo has had an agreement to bring in one of the Dinotopians to help with educational tours of the museum as a staff member, and one of Horizon&#39;s Tokyo Office has an Animalian as a member of its staff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be Chel...&quot; Travis commented, &quot;she&#39;s worked with some of the projects that helped Horizon perfect the development on the various Dinotopian related projects.&quot;<br />
<br />
Johan, meanwhile, flipped through his phone at the moment regarding some of Animalia Ambassadoria&#39;s past coverage on the Dinotopians, and there had been one that had become a Gigantoraptor and had often made some commentary on eventually returning &quot;home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But wouldn&#39;t establishing the colony here... in Japan&#39;s Volcano Islands be a step back from that if you are wanting a colony in Japan?&quot; Johan wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically we are still in Japan,&quot; Rika answered, &quot;but I can see the concern... Though at the moment, fully establishing an Animalian colony in Tokyo or one of the other cities in Japan&#39;s home islands would have some difficulty in accommodating the enlarged size of some Animalians and the fact that many hotels and apartments in Japan have some strict rules with regard to pets and animals. And with as densely populated as a city like Tokyo is... a lot of the work that will need to be done to house and move people will take time, and that won&#39;t be easy. In this... we would hope that the colony here would provide an opportunity for success for those Japanese Animalians to live and thrive while the bigger issue of getting things ready in the Home Islands to accommodate the larger Animalians in particular.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know on how long that will take?&quot; Travis wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Rika gave sigh, &quot;based on what I&#39;ve read in my countries papers... perhaps a year to handle all the related activities to updating the infrastructure to allow for them. But that is at best a guess on my part. Though... we also have no plans on forcibly moving the smaller Animalians here. Those that have found homes in Tokyo and other cities are perfectly free to remain where they are.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Pauline and Rebecca were covering some of the more touristy aspects on the new colony, which included the hot springs that were there. Unlike the springs in Animalia that were all underground, these springs were all above ground where they came on Nate Bowman. He was seated on the edge of the spring with only his lower legs in the water. It provided a great opportunity to play up the new colony&#39;s tourist prospects. He did notice them as they approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is prime tourist attraction that the new colony has, its hot springs!&quot; Rebecca announced as Pauline pointed the camera to her and viewed the hot springs behind Rebecca, &quot;Like the Cavern Spa in Animalia, it is warmed by geothermal energy from the volcano that formed the island. Though from the reports from scientists that have looked at the island after it was found on the maps, the volcano is largely inactive. Which does well for those looking for a warm bathing spot!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pauline then handed the camera to Rebecca and waited for her to move it so that the largely grey feathered Microraptor Dinotopian was in focus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though unlike Cavern Spa, there is no nude bathing here,&quot; Pauline spoke, &quot;which would mean it would be open to tourists of all ages. Such as a friend we made when we flew here... Nate Bowman, whom we&#39;ve found enjoying the hot spring already.&quot;<br />
<br />
They then came up to Nate who had sat quietly watching as they gave their introduction. They came up and soon crouched down next to him near the edge of the spa. Rebecca went to balance on one knee while Pauline sat back and balanced, not too unlike a catcher in baseball. As they settled in, he finally made a comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I have actually been &quot;enjoying&quot; the hot spring, yet,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;I only got my legs in. I&#39;m actually just waiting for Shuixing to get here to enjoy the spa. It was very kind of her to offer me a chance to visit. But I have gotten to meet a couple of people that have already come here to live... and they have seemed to enjoy the hot springs too. They told me it is a good place to relax, which is what any hot spring would be for... I suppose. Thankfully they knew a fair bit of English. My Chinese isn&#39;t very good...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But do you think it&#39;d be worth coming to see?&quot; Rebecca asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Nate actually smiled, &quot;the people here have been friendly and courteous to me. Which has been nice... though for me personally... the best part of this has been being able to see Shuixing again. She taught me a few things during SAMAS that were very helpful. And... it&#39;s felt like I&#39;ve made a good friend with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca thought she heard an almost wistful tone in Nate&#39;s voice, which almost sounded as though there was hope for more than just friendship with Shuixing, though she didn&#39;t want to say anything on that subject. As they had been instructed that Animalia Ambassadoria was not to be used as a dating service. Though, as she and Pauline then signed off and began to leave the area, they found the Five Elements approaching and with some of the giggles that were aimed at Shuixing, it was pretty clear that they had overheard the tone of voice that Nate had. Rebecca also thought she heard Huoxing say to Shuixing, &quot;told you&quot; as the Elements approached the hot spring and Pauline and Rebecca left the hot spring.<br />
<br />

<br />
On another portion of the island Samson and Penelope were looking at the land that was just to the east of the airfield as Japanese scientist and a Japanese Macaque Animalian were discussing the farming potential of the island. This was seen as a critical need, given that many terrestrial animals were actually herbivorous and needed some plant matter to eat, and that would apply to Animalians based on those animals. The animals that would be needed to feed the carnivorous Animalians would also need that sort of thing to eat as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... do you really think you could active manage farms on the island?&quot; Samson wondered as he looked at a couple of the small structures that were built there and the groups of people presently taking some of the soil samples.<br />
<br />
&quot;We believe so,&quot; the human scientist answered in Japanese, which the Japanese Macaque Animalian, who had been part of the Lyre Zoo as part of a specialized exchange program from a minor Japanese zoo, translated, &quot;The island is larger in land area than the other Volcano Islands and the old volcano&#39;s slope isn&#39;t too great. In this we theorize that the island&#39;s soil should be nutrient rich for certain plants. In this we speculate that farming here will mirror some of the agricultural practices on other volcanic islands, like Hawaii in the US.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But unlike Hawaii, the volcano here isn&#39;t active,&quot; the Japanese Macaque Animalian added on his own, &quot;which could do well with certain elements of the agriculture industry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But not all Animalians that are herbivorous rely on fruit,&quot; Penelope asked, &quot;Do you think the island could support growing other crops? Be they grains, like wheat or rice, or like carrots?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That may be a bit more difficult,&quot; the Japanese scientist commented, &quot;but that&#39;s also why we&#39;re taking as many soil samples as we can to see what it can support. And even if it ultimately cannot, then there is the option that the farms here could support a trade economy where they export what they grow to get the funds to import what they need on the whole. Much like what Hawaii does today with the US with regard to certain foods. And given its placement... there will also be the potential to open up low level fishing fleets to support the island as well... though that would be something would benefit carnivorous Animalians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And from a tourist aspect, much of what can be grown here could also serve to attract people wanting something a bit more exotic,&quot; the Japanese Macaque added after he finished translating for the scientist.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what do you think of the island, not as a scientist but... as a person?&quot; Penelope wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s actually rather nice,&quot; the Japanese scientist replied, &quot;perhaps a bit isolated, and that&#39;s why it wasn&#39;t truly colonized by Japan... but it is nice. It&#39;s warm and relatively sunny with nice views. You can go up to the peak of the volcano and look out for miles to sea. Calm and tranquil... Though... that may be lost if it becomes a tourist hot spot... but I suppose if it can bring joy to people, it may be worth it.&quot;</p>
