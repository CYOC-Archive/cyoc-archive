<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Feeling good about bringing Maureen to an apparently sensational orgasm, Sean got off the now prone Maureen, pulled his condom off and discarded it with the earlier ones into the bin before wiping his spent cock on the shirt he had worn last night. He then put his underwear and trousers back on, eager to have a shower and find some new clothes.<br />
<br />
As he departed the room he came face to face with Mason, Claire, Cameron and Charlotte who were sipping on coffee’s and fully dressed, looking ready to head across the road to the beach. Claire and Charlotte just smiled at him letting him know that they were well aware of what had been happening in Maureen’s room. Mason quietly said “Way to go bro” and held out his hand for a High Five. Sean gave Mason a slap and was unable to suppress the grin on his face. He gave a second High Five to Cameron. This time the congratulations were mutual. The two had been best mates since the first day at college.<br />
<br />
“Um I need to go and clean up” Sean sheepishly headed to the other unit. Where he ran into Steve and Kirsty. Steve asked “What the hell was happening next door?” <br />
<br />
Sean just answered “It seems Maureen is a screamer”, hoping to give the impression that causing girls to moan like Maureen had was part of everyday life.  He then ducked into the room he had been sharing with Cameron where he quickly located some fresh clothes and entered the shower.<br />
<br />
Maureen took a long time before she stirred. She realised she had made a lot of noise and just hoped she had not been too audible. When she got the energy to reach for the handbag and retrieved Liz’s phone she got a shock to see that it was almost 10 am. She then looked at who had been ringing at such an inopportune time. Seeing her own name as the caller she listened to the message. She groaned once more when she realised Liz would be expecting her at any minute. She knew it would be a couple of hours before she could clean up and drive home. She texted back to Liz “I’ll be there for lunch”<br />
<br />
Things got worse when she gathered her clothes and prepared to leave the room. She stuck her head out the door to see if the coast was clear enough to dash to the bathroom in her nakedness. To her dismay all the students except for Sean were gathered in the lounge (Including Steve and Kirsty by then) apparently waiting for her to emerge. <br />
<br />
“Good morning” said Kirsty who had observed the door opening in a cheerful voice and a big smile on her face. <br />
<br />
“Oh God! How long have you all been there for?”<br />
<br />
“Long enough to hear your hymn to the altar of Aphrodite. The whole complex probably did!” joked Mason. Maureen did not appreciate the joke. She slammed the door shut.<br />
<br />
She vaguely heard the girls chastising Mason for his poor taste.<br />
<br />
A minute later she heard Kirsty’s voice from the other side of the door. “We are all heading to the other unit. It will be safe to come out in a minute”<br />
<br />
A minute later Maureen stuck her head out the door once more. The coast was clear. She made the dash to the bathroom. There she ran the water, stepped under the stream and began to cry.<br />
…………<br />
Liz was annoyed when she got the answering text from Maureen. Why did her friend sometimes make things harder than they needed to be? It seemed she was to be Maureen Manning for a couple more hours. How could she fill in that time? She had already cleaned up everything. In the end she went out to Roger’s shed, more out of curiosity than anything else. She was wondering what project he might be working on now. <br />
<br />
It was there that she discovered well sealed boxes of old clothing against the back wall of the shed. Liz had no idea who’s clothes they were but some were female and some were male. There was a box of young girl’s clothes in there as well. Kirsty was Liz’s youngest and about 23 now. Liz figured these clothes must have been put here when Roger and Maureen had first bought this house 15 years ago. This was a jackpot! She would show the boxes to Maureen when she arrived. Potentially there were clothes in here of both Maureen’s and Roger’s from when they were in their 30’s!<br />
<br />
While waiting for Maureen, Liz made herself a cup of coffee and glanced through some of the brochures she had been given. She began to throw around ideas in her head about the trip to Spain. Instead of making the trip as a group of 50 year old’s or even 40 something year old’s they could go as 30 somethings! To Liz that was the perfect age. Old enough to be a mature adult but not old enough to have aches and pains. Roger would have to be included. In his 30’s he still played basketball. Liz could remember admiring his muscular figure. Roger was still quite fit and had not allowed his body to go to fat as Maureen had but in his mid 30’s Liz thought Roger was at his peak! That was when she had first regretted introducing him to Maureen.<br />
<br />
They would have to tell Roger and let him in on their secret. She would raise this subject again when Maureen got back. She imagined having tapas with a young Roger on the water front at Lisbon. Yes! If she was in her early 30’s once more she wanted Roger to be only a year or two older.</p>
