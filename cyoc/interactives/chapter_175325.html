<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">20 minutes later you were at your own house. However technically it wasn&#39;t your house. For the evening you were Monica and Monica was you. She was the person coming home.<br />
<br />
Monica rang the doorbell even though she had keys. Your mum answered and greeted Monica with a hug &#39;Oh son, you look great. What a fabulous suit. When did you buy that?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;It belongs to Monica&#39;s Dad. I&#39;ve just borrowed it for the evening&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well come in&#39;  They did. Your Mum gave you a hug. &#39;Hi Monica, You look great as well. Thanks for getting him to dress up&#39;<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t say anything. You were stunned by the feeling of touching your mothers skin. It bought back memories of childhood and cuddling in Susie&#39;s arms. She felt so &quot;comfortable&quot; you instinctively knew you wanted to try out her form. However now was not the time.<br />
<br />
&#39;Um thanks Susie. You look great yourself&#39; You had to be careful not to call her Mum. Susie had always insisted that Monica should call her Susie. &#39;Has anyone else arrived yet?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Not yet you are the first&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Well can we help with anything?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;No all is under control. Though perhaps you could help with serving when everyone is seated&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Sure, Who else is coming?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;The Arnold&#39;s, the Smith&#39;s and the Delaney&#39;s.&#39; That told you something. Mum&#39;s best friend Fran and her husband Greg were not coming. They would be the couple you had replaced. You became a bit anxious, all of those coming had met Monica before. Would they detect you were not the real Monica?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Graeme had come out to greet the new arrivals. He was shaking hands with the real Monica. It was strange to recall those two souls had been fucking each other a week ago. Graeme came and gave you a hug. It felt strange to be hugging your stepfather, you had only ever shaken his hand before. You got to feel his &quot;skin&quot;. He was strong and authoritative. He felt so different to your Mum. But you now had the feeling you knew Graeme so much better than you had earlier. You had always been a bit standoffish with him. Perhaps that had been a bit of a defensive reaction against someone who was trying to replace your father.<br />
<br />
Now you were looking at Graeme through Monica&#39;s eyes. He was an older man but you could see he was quite good looking. You could understand why your Mum was attracted to him.<br />
<br />
You were ushered into the lounge and a glass of champagne was put in your hand. The evening had begun. The doorbell rang again and over the next 10 minutes the other guests arrived. Each of them greeted you with a hug. Your senses were overcome with the feelings of each persons skin. You found you could remember what each persons touch felt like. Suddenly you knew each of these people so much better. They were no longer just your mother&#39;s friends. Now you knew each of them personally.<br />
<br />
For instance you knew immediately that Anne Delaney was insecure about her looks and that she had spent a ridiculous sum on the gown she was wearing. That gave you the confidence to say to her &#39;Wow, that dress looks great. Where did you find it?&#39; These insights made it very easy to talk to your mothers friends.<br />
<br />
However not all of your discoveries were good. You learned by touching Dean Smith that he lusted after you. A warning bell went off in your head. You sensed that given the opportunity he would go for the grope. You knew you were safe in the presence of his wife Liz but if you found yourself alone with him you needed to be on alert. You were a bit disconcerted that somewhere in the back of your mind that thought excited you.<br />
<br />
The evening went well. With your insights into the guests you were able to make easy conversation with them. You also heard all about your mothers upcoming week in the country.<br />
<br />
You did help your Mum to serve dinner and were thankful that you didn&#39;t spill anything on Monica&#39;s dress. Susie was very thankful but surprised that you knew where the good wine glasses were kept. After that you were careful to appear ignorant of things that Monica shouldn&#39;t know.<br />
<br />
The hardest part of the evening was sitting next to your old body at dinner. Your current body lusted after your &quot;Boyfriend&quot; the slightest touch excited you and you were aware of how moist your vagina was becoming. It was very hard to restrain yourself from feeling under the table to discover whether he was as excited about your proximity as much as you were about his.<br />
<br />
After dinner everyone retired to the lounge, where true to form your Mum coaxed everyone to get up and dance. Dancing with your former body was almost too much her you. You were actually relieved when Graeme took away your &quot;Boyfriend&quot; to help clean up the dishes.<br />
<br />
However that created other problems. The dancing continued and Dean Smith decided that you needed a partner. You could hardly turn him down in public, so found yourself in his arms. You could feel his fingers feeling your body and as he was touching you you could sense he was fascinated by the lingerie he could feel. Maybe wearing the g-string panties Monica had laid out for you hadn&#39;t been such a good idea? At the same time you were thrilled that this man found you so attractive. You didn&#39;t try to stop him. However you knew it would be very dangerous to be alone with him. You were very confused.<br />
<br />
It was a relief when your boyfriend returned. He was the most attractive male in the room. When he suggested &#39;Perhaps we should go home as well&#39; as the Delaney&#39;s were leaving. You agreed.<br />
<br />
After a round of farewell cuddles, including an unnecessary brush of your breast and a squeeze of your bum from Dean, you were finally back in your car. Monica drove you back to her house.<br />
<br />
On the way you decided that once home you would let your &quot;boyfriend&quot; deflower you. These female hormones were driving you crazy. You longed to have that dick inside of you. You didn&#39;t say anything but let your hand wander across and feel his crotch as he drove. You could feel the hard sausage hidden in his trousers.</p>
