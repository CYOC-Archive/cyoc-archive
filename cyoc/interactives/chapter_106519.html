At s1&#39;s suggestion, it will probably be available in the Forum section of CYOC.net for reading and input because of its length first, but hopefully in time it can be split and posted over several episodes to cover each Earth of our ongoing saga in their respective threads.}}<br />

<br />
As Martha Anderson started walking up the stairs to the master bedroom on the second floor of their house, she couldn&#39;t help teasing her husband by wiggling her bare ass seductively before him.<br />
That had the desired effect as William felt his penis begin to stir and Martha could smell the renewed scent of arousal coming from him.<br />
As they entered the bedroom, Martha paused in front of her bureau to grab a medicine bottle from its top surface. &quot;Technically, I&#39;m still good for another hour, but why take chances?&quot; she asked rhetorically, while seductively swallowing her werecat birth control pill for that day.<br />
&quot;Now then,&quot; she said, turning to embrace William before she started caressing his hairy chest. &quot;Just to clarify one point on our new, opener marriage policy. While I&#39;m willing to share my women with you who are into threesomes, I&#39;m just not ready yet to have any man other than you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Whatever you&#39;re comfortable with dear. Just as long as you know how much I love you and shall always be yours,&quot; replied William, while wrapping his arms around her. &quot;Would you like to take that shower now?&quot;<br />
&quot;Actually, I had something else in mind first,&quot; she said with a smile, as William felt her hands start to drift below his waist.<br />
&quot;Are you wanting some more fun?&quot; he asked seductively, even as William saw his wife&#39;s feline fursona start to emerge again.<br />
&quot;Just some?&quot; she asked teasingly, twitching her whiskers before the werecat sank to her knees to enjoy some added protein with her breakfast.<br />
William started yipping in pleasure as a horny werefox soon joined a lusty werecat on the carpeted floor of their bedroom.<br />
Their morning agenda of him preparing lesson plans for the week while she studied for her teaching recertification would eventually become afternoon events, but neither of them cared at that moment as Mister and Mrs. Anderson thoroughly enjoyed the love and comfort each had to offer the other.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Next door at the Twist residence, Samantha, Frances, and Ben Twist were marveling at how great a cook Ben&#39;s girlfriend Kenya Adaeze turned out to be.<br />
&quot;I have <i>never</i> tasted ham and eggs like this before!&quot; declared Samantha, cleaning her plate with a piece of toast.<br />
&quot;I must agree,&quot; said her wife Frances. &quot;I&#39;m a fair paw in the kitchen, but this is truly delicious. What&#39;s your secret?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s in the spices,&quot; revealed Kenya. &quot;Most people only use seasonings while the food is cooking. I mixed them in to the raw egg batter and briefly marinated each piece of ham steak in that first, before cooking everything simultaneously in the same skillet.&quot;<br />
&quot;I watched her cook and I know it sounds weird,&quot; said Ben, while looking at his mothers. &quot;But you can&#39;t deny the results.&quot;<br />
&quot;True,&quot; agreed Samantha, as Frances simply nodded.<br />
&quot;I am glad everyone has enjoyed their meal. Despite having some legitimate concerns about me being a little older than him and dating your son, you have shown me nothing but love and kindness since I first met you. This is just my simple way of showing my gratitude for welcoming me into your family, and when the time is right, you are more than welcomed to meet my aunt and uncle,&quot; offered Kenya.<br />
&quot;We shall enjoy that moment when it approaches,&quot; Frances said diplomatically.<br />
&quot;On that note, I have made a decision that I wish to share with all of you first. One that even my family is not aware of yet,&quot; announced Kenya.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; said Samantha, arching an eyebrow suspiciously at her as Frances and Ben shifted their positions to look more directly at Kenya.<br />
&quot;While I have yet to hear my fate in regards to my application for the summer internship program at Tachibana Industries* next summer, after I graduate college the year after next, I have decided to stay in Moon Lake and... how you say, seek my fame and fortune here,&quot; announced Kenya.<br />
The biggest smile his mothers had ever seen crossed Ben&#39;s face at the news, as Samantha and Frances briefly glanced at each other before turning back to face Kenya again.<br />
&quot;Not that we ain&#39;t happy to hear that, but can we ask what influenced that decision?&quot; inquired Frances, although both had their suspicions.<br />
&quot;Never in all my life have I felt or experienced such freedom of expression as I have here in Moon Lake,&quot; began Kenya. &quot;Back in New York City, the were community is not so organized or friendly among the various species as it is here. One not only must be always on their guard to prevent normal human beings from discovering our uniqueness, but there are those there who seem to specialize on preying upon their fellow weres because they know their victims cannot turn to normal authorities for assistance without risking exposure.&quot;<br />
&quot;While I know of the existence of other weres around the globe, this is the first I&#39;m hearing of such problems within any were community,&quot; admitted Samantha, who served as Moon Lake&#39;s Town Chancellor.<br />
&quot;It is true, and also why as soon as my sister graduates high school, the remainder of my family intends to move here too,&quot; revealed Kenya.<br />
&quot;When is that?&quot; asked Frances.<br />
&quot;The year after I graduate college, she will be a high school senior if all goes well. That next summer, Kendra and my parents will relocate here,&quot; explained Kenya.<br />
&quot;Well, when the time comes, they&#39;ll be more than welcomed,&quot; promised Samantha.<br />
&quot;I shall stay with my aunt and uncle until time dictates otherwise,&quot; said Kenya.<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; wondered Frances, although she had her suspicions.<br />
&quot;Whether or not I get the summer internship, I still hope to acquire a job with Tachibana Industries upon graduation. They are not only the most were friendly company that I know of, but they also do their best to help the world, regardless of who you are. That is the kind of company I have always dreamed of working for,&quot; said Kenya.<br />
Samantha made a silent promise to herself to discuss with her wife later whether or not it would be a good idea to say something to Akane Tachibana about Kenya the next time she saw the Skulk leader in something other than a tense town business moment; preferably after the matter of the Harper/Jenkins wedding was successfully resolved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there any other reason?&quot; wondered Frances, as she could not help noticing the way Kenya and Ben kept looking at each other.<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Kenya said shyly, as somewhat of a blush momentarily colored her mocha toned cheeks, &quot;but that decision is not mine to make,&quot; she added, looking demurely at Ben.<br />
Ben looked at her and said, &quot;By now you know the content of my heart, but for the moment, all I can officially say is that I am <i>very</i> glad you will be here for a long time to come.&quot;<br />
Those words made Samantha&#39;s heart swell with pride over her son as Ben leaned forward and kissed his girlfriend.<br />
