<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Please delete the other, I switched ideas but not titles.)<br />
<br />
You were greeted by your new draconic instincts, and you looked at Droze and said,&quot;H...Hey, until this is done, an you uh....close your eyes and look away?&quot; Droze looked up at you and paused then he nodded and covered his eyes with his wings respectively. You felt a bit more comfortable now as Droze didn’t watch this happening to your body. <br />
<br />
You continued to watch the scales spread up your arms and to your shoulders and you paused as you saw your muscles diminishing. Your arms now looked dainty and slender for some reason, and soon you realized why as the scales reached your pelvis. You looked down and watched your dick suddenly become erect, but then it shrank into your body and left behind a scaled slit.<br />
<br />
You paused shocked, but you didn’t want to disturb Droze and scare him so you refused to scream. It was then that you felt a painful crack in your legs and spine and you fell onto all fours. Your body then started growing and every inch of it was expanding by the second.<br />
<br />
While you grew your face was overtaken by the scales and it formed a muzzle on the end of it. Your hair fell out and two gray horns emerged from the back of your skull then curled forward like a ram. The scales now made it onto your chest and you felt two soft areas of flesh slowly expanding around your nipples while this happened. Your hips also became wider as oddly as it was, but they did so anyways giving you the distinct feminine capability of bearing children within your womb. Your mouth then changed on the inside as your teeth were replaced with the sharp jagged teeth of a carnivore, and your tongue became forked and slick. <br />
<br />
Your mounds, or new breasts kept expanding by the second as now larger, thicker and flexible gray scales were covered them and your stomach. Then the scales finally reached your back and not only did you see a tail sprout out of your rear age grow to full length, but two large wings emerged as well, they were blue with gray flaps. Spikes then trailed down from your head to your tail and they also turned gray too. You body stopped growing eventually and you now seemed almost as tall as the trees around you, and you let out a bellowing burst of fire from your mouth as your transformation to a dragon concluded.<br />
<br />
Beathing heavily now, you look down at Droze, who now stared up at you with his jaw dropped in awe. Moments later you felt a churning in your stomach and you saw it bulge out and your breasts swelled some too and you paused before looking down at Droze again and smiling at him. Your draconic instincts had changed now and you felt more maternal towards Droze as if he was your child, but something inside you told you that he wouldn’t be an only hatchling, and you could tell that clearly.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless you layed down on your side and nuzzled Droze gently and said,&quot;Sorry, are you alright Droze?&quot; Droze paused looking up at you and he blinked then said,&quot;Y...you look like Mommy, and your tummy...&quot; You paused and blushed then said,&quot;I do? Well....did your mommy have a big tummy too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Droze paused and nodded then said,&quot;Yeah, Mommy’s was bigger though, and you look....less old. Mommy also had those big large things, and she fed me from them.&quot; Droze pointed to your breasts and you paused then said,&quot;Well....would you believe that....I&#39;m your new mommy? Because I feel like that I am your new mommy, but...obviously not your other one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Droze paused then he cheered,&quot;Yay!&quot; He then ran up to you wagging his tail and he scooter up to you and licked your muzzle and he said,&quot;I got a new Mommy! I’m so happy!&quot; You smiled then you licked him lovingly and you looked down at his leg and sighed. <br />
<br />
&quot;You’re still hurt, and you can’t walk like that at all though. I feel....as if you shouldn’t go anywhere without me at your age too.&quot; You exclaimed and Droze paused and nodded then he said,&quot;I don’t care, I&#39;m just happy, very very happy! Mommy, can you feed me like you used to?&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused blushing and looked down at your breasts and grew a little bit nervous. Both of your breasts were far bigger than Droze, hell you&#39;d even bet they one of them was twice your size and weight from before you were a dragon. You looked down at Droze and asked,&quot;Can you hunt?&quot; Droze shook his head and said,&quot;I&#39;m not supposed to for another 276 years, or at least I&#39;m told not to.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused and thought,&quot;Damnit, who knows how long these eggs will be in me. I can’t teach him to hunt while I’m pregnant and warming eggs. Will he be too old to teach afterwards? Maybe, and then I’ll have others to care for. Damn, he needs a father, but where do I find a male who would be willing to love me, and him knowing that I’m pregnant and already a mother? Oh, I just need to hope that someone believes in that story Droze knows about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Droze then batted at your muzzle and said,&quot;Mommy, can I please feed like I used to?&quot; You paused for a moment then nodded and said,&quot;Uh...s...sure, here you go, just don’t choke.&quot; You lifted Droze up and too a moment to lay over on your side. You then lowered him to one of your nipples, and noticed that it was almost the size of his head. Without a second thought however, Droze clung on and began suckling your teat.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly even though he had teeth, Droze didn&#39;t hurt you at all, and at most it just tickled. You scanned your surroundings for a moment to check for danger and you felt Droze draining the milk from your breast. You looked back at him and sighed then said,&quot;Droze, can I ask you something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Droze paused and looked over at you smiling and he burped then he said,&quot;Yes Mommy?&quot; You paused unsure how he would take this, and then you said,&quot;Would you....like a new daddy? Not like your old daddy, but just a daddy to care for you is what I’m saying. Are you okay with having a different daddy from before?&quot;<br />
<br />
Droze paused looking to you confused then he perked up and said,&quot;Like a daddy, who is different from my old daddy? Sure, I&#39;d be happy,  really really happy!&quot; You smiled at him and laughed then you picked him up and put him on your back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on then Droze, first we need to find a nice comfy cave, and then I promise that I&#39;ll look for a new Daddy for you.&quot; You said and Droze nodded and said,&quot;Okay! I want to know though, why is your tummy so big? Is it because your a big adult?&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed and peered down at your swollen gut and looked back at Droze, and said,&quot;Uh...yeah, for now at least.&quot; Droze nodded to you, and you sighed in relief that his little mind was willing to accept this information as fact, at least for now.<br />
<br />
You then slowly began to stand up, and Droze stayed on your back easily. You looked back to check and he smiled at you and laughed. You then looked around and scanned your surroundings yet again before you did anything else. Everything seemed so much closer now that you’re body was so large, but you were barely able to get your head above the trees around you. You knew not to trust the cave behind you due to those other dragons, so you decided to go the opposite direction instead for Droze&#39;s sake.<br />
<br />
You walked slowly through the trees and Droze didn’t seem to want to stop asking questions. You happily answered what you could until the question every parent fears cake up,&quot;Where do....hatchlings come from?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your eyes widened at this and you froze in place, then you looked back at Droze and said,&quot;You....aren’t old enough to know that yet.&quot; Droze then replied,&quot;But why? I want to know now!&quot; You then gave him a stern look and said,&quot;When you’re OLDER Droze, I&#39;d be more concerned with that leg if I were you.&quot; Droze then whined,&quot;Aww, okaaaaay.&quot;<br />
<br />
You then let out a sigh and you heard a male voice from behind you say,&quot;Hello miss, or whatever one would call you in your situation. I witnessed your transformation and I would like a word with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused and turned back around front and you saw a.....</p>
