<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What do you mean &#39;you can&#39;t find the car?&quot;, Will spoke with anger in his voice.<br />
<br />
It was the morning, and was the 2nd official day of them in the cabin. James lived up to his word, and searched for the car, but...... There were some complications.<br />
<br />
&quot;I looked man! Just like last night, every trail lead back to the cabin&quot;, James was angry himself, but also very scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you have something to do with this!&quot;, Will got close to James, and pushed his finger into James&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were the one who drove us to this place, you fucker&quot;, Tensions were high. James wouldn&#39;t back down however.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was the bear! That&#39;s what made us swerve to begin with, you conspiracy riddled shit!&quot;, James was now a having a fullblown meltdown.<br />
<br />
&quot;You go out there, and search! You will see what I mean. Right now I personally feel like stabbing you in the eyes!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was silence after a few seconds, Will stepped back, never seeing James like this shocked Will.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah man take it easy&quot;, Will put his hands up in saying this, trying to decrease the tension in the room. Will was positioned right in front of the kitchen table, and there was a knife on a plate. If James came at him, he would surely grab it!<br />
<br />
<br />
James for the second time in two days was having a borderline panic attack. This entire situation was stressful enough, but having Will confront him like that set him off. He currently had all the symptoms of one, but in Will lifting his arms, James noticed something as his shirt sleeves buckled down, which revealed something to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at your arms! You look like a monkey&quot;, James just started laughing after seeing Will&#39;s furry arms. I guess laughter was one cure for a panic attack in the cabin. This also completely de escalated the scene entirely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shutup!&quot;, Will quickly rolled his sleeves over his hairy arms. A part of him was glad that happened, he was truly afraid of what was about to happen if James didn&#39;t laugh right there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look I feel your pain, I have donkey fur from the waist down&quot;, James at this point was just trying to comfort his friend.<br />
<br />
Of course James didn&#39;t know the half of it. Not only did he have this same fur from the waist up, he also had it from the waist down like James! His whole body was covered in this black fur. Even wearing clothes made him extremely uncomfortable. It made him so hot, and the itching &quot;Oh god the itching&quot;, Will thought this to himself as he was even itchy right now! Wearing clothes was a nightmare, but what other choice did he have?<br />
<br />
The only thing he could think of was a poncho, but the cabin probably wouldn&#39;t have one, or maybe a dress. Dresses would feel smoother on his skin, and wouldn&#39;t smother him like mens clothing, but.........    &#39;NO&#39; was the definitive answer to that, he was the king of the jungle, not some female.. &quot;what?&quot; Internally Will caught what he just thought, but before the man could think any further, James spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know about this curse right?&quot;, James saw Will who was lost in thought, he wanted to bring him back into the conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have sex, we change right&quot;, Will half mindedly said this, he couldn&#39;t stop thinking about what he just thought &quot;Why did I just call myself the king of the jungle?&quot;, He was scared of that intrusive thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I quess that&#39;s about right, something is making us hornier too.&quot;, After saying this, Will&#39;s lion ears perked up, this was a conspiracy, something right up his alley!<br />
<br />
&quot;Everytime we orgasm, we change, we can&#39;t leave. Look James, we are becoming animals, I have been thinking about something since last night&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;, James was just happy Will was speaking again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember you basically called us Jackasses last night&quot;, Will was now nervous, his voice was even raspy.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! It can&#39;t be.... You called Cameron&#39;s hair a lion mane didn&#39;t you?&quot;, James was astonished, could this really be why this is happening?<br />
<br />
&quot;I did, but I cant recollect what Cameron said, can you?&quot;, Will loved mysteries, and solving them was a borderline hobby for the young man.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, everything just seems like a blur, but you&#39;re right, that can&#39;t be a coincidence&quot;, After saying this James could feel that itchy sensation. Much like Will, wearing Jeans was painful, he also wore his jeans slightly lower to accommodate his donkey tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well right now we should probably investigate around this cabin. Clues have to be around here somewhere on who is doing this to us.&quot;, Before finishing Will had some last words.  &quot;Go wake up Cameron, honestly Im starving, im going to finish this food!&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, ok&quot;, James was still ashamed of the way he acted earlier, and just complied with what the man said.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will cooked some eggs, and prepared them before James came back, which of course lead to the spat they just had. The man was truly starving. You couldn&#39;t really do anything without a nice breakfast in the morning, at least that&#39;s what Will thought. He grabbed the chair in the kitchen, and looked at his plate of luke warm eggs, it looked good. Will sat down on the chair, a pain instantly nagged him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn forgot about this stupid tail!&quot;, Will in frustration, just pulled his cargo pants all the way down. Somehow he forgot about his tail, but he was just so hungry right now, he didn&#39;t want to cut a hole in his pants right now. As Will was basically nude from the waist down, he could feel how relieving it was for him. This gave him the encouragement to keep on eating, and as he was grinding his hips on the chair, he felt something strange, weird, foreign, was the only ways to describe it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn I must have made some good eggs&quot;, Will didn&#39;t know why he was feeling so good, it wasn&#39;t the eggs, but something completely different. Will had no idea of his other change from the night before. It was a cleft around his taint, sloppy moist, it was a vagina! The way it was positioned on his body, basically meant that every time he sat, he would be sitting on his vagina. His tail wasn&#39;t even the Pain when he sat down...... It was the vagina the entire time. As he slowly was grinding his hips as he ate, the pain turned into pleasure. Slowly his focus turned from the eggs onto this pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mbmmm, ya&quot;, He put his hands off the plate, and grabbed the table. Will started to grind on the chair with more passion, it was amazing for him. His vagina was getting the attention it wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh stick it in me, and fuck m.... What?&quot;, His willpower prevailed, and he jumped up off of the chair. He quickly put his hand around his taint. Doing this quickly, made him accidentally put his fingers completely in his vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHat is that&#10084;&quot;, Curiosity got the better of the man. His fingers sliding into his vagina was a mistake he could soon regret!</p>
