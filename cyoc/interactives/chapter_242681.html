<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day, Jeff and Amy had gotten up early to drop Jamie off at her grandparent&#39;s house before school and leave her luggage there.  Jeff and Amy stayed a little while to say goodbye to Jamie before they went away for the week on their anniversary holiday at an inn that Jeff had rented for the two of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, mom, please, you&#39;ll see me when the week&#39;s over, I promise.&quot; Jamie said as Amy was kissing her daughter all over her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I know sweetie, but I just can&#39;t bear the thought of not seeing your face for an entire week.&quot; Amy said as she finished kissing her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you&#39;ll be good for grandma and grandpa, right?&quot; Jeff said putting his hand on Amy&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dad, I will.&quot; Amy said crossing her fingers over her heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll ask them first if you can have your friends can come over to their house?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What!?  But...but why!?  They&#39;re my friends!  Mom, do I have to ask grandma and grandpa first?&quot; Jamie asked Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re staying under their house, you respect their wishes.&quot; Amy said crossing her arms at her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll ask first.&quot; Jamie sighed as Jeff now came over and kneeled down to Jamie to whisper in her ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be safe and don&#39;t do anything drastic.&quot; Jeff said to Jamie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same to you.&quot; Jamie replied back to her dad as Jeff and Amy now got into their car with Jeff opening the door for Amy first.<br />
<br />
Jamie and her grandparents waved them off as the car drove away.  As soon as the car was away, Joey approached her grand daughter and patted her on the shoulder.  &quot;Well, come on my princess.  I better get you to school before you run late.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie turned to her grandfather and nodded with a smile.  &quot;Okay Grandpa Joey!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary soon pick up Jamie&#39;s luggage and told the two, &quot;You two go.  I&#39;ll start getting all this to the guest room.  You have fun at school now sweetie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie looked to her grandmother and said back to her, &quot;Of course, Grandma Mary.  I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so the two headed to Joey&#39;s 1950&#39;s Cherry Red Convertible and let Jamie in first.  Once she was in, Joey start the car and revved the engines to start to leave.  The car left the driveway as the two headed for school while Mary waved them off before taking Jamie&#39;s luggage to the house.<br />
<br />
Fifteen minutes later, Joey was driving down the town&#39;s street while Jamie had her phone on her music playlist, listening to more of Taylor Swift.  But as she was enjoying it, a strange thought occurred to her.  She knew that last night, she met Mary and Joey as grandparents, but before hand, Joey was in fact the eldest son when she was once a mother.  Turning to him, he could see a lot of resemblance to the previous grandfather, with a few exceptions.  The gray thinning hair and the wrinkled face was the same, but he was more fit then the original grandfather.  Probably because Joey was once pro high school football player when he was once a teenager before the Chornivac.  Even with a limp on his leg during the war, he remained in the top of shape despite how frail he was.  It was amazing the longevity he has.<br />
<br />
She soon looked at his car and was baffled by it.  She remembered on his seventeenth birthday, he got a Chevrolet Corvette, cause he was always into speed.  But thanks to the Chronivac, his ride had a major downgrade and became a classic Corvette he had for a long time and kept it running.  Everything, right down to the sound system was untouched and he like it as is.  Really strange for reality to alter like that, but of course, a grandfather can&#39;t drive anything fast.  He needs to get things slow.  And even if it is a Chevrolet, he prefers to have cruise around then the adrenaline.<br />
<br />
As she was trying to process all of this, she felt a tap on the shoulder and turned to see Joey there with a little grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything wrong, princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie removed her pods and answered, &quot;No...  Nothing wrong.  Why you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause you&#39;ve been very quiet for some time.  Normally, when you were younger, we always chat like crazy in my car.  Now you are focused on those dodads and whatzamacallits that you never want to say anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie heard that and realized something.  Even before her altered memories, Grandma&#39;s home is always so retro.  As in, there&#39;s no technology within the house hold.  No Wi-Fi.  No streaming services, no flatscreen TV, nothing.  She has a rotary phone in the kitchen, a wooden box TV in the living room, and appliances that are from the 60s and 70s.  Hell, the furniture was antique as well as there isn&#39;t anything modern since.  Now she&#39;s going to be living with them for a week without anything.  Thankfully, her tablet, phone, and laptop has built in wi-fi to connect anywhere without home connection, otherwise, she would be bored to death.<br />
<br />
Shaking that thought, she told him.  &quot;Oh...  It&#39;s nothing...  Just that...a lot is on my mind recently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About your mom and dad leaving for the week.&quot; he asked her.<br />
<br />
Peering her eyes back to him, she sighed and said, &quot;Yeah...  Sort of...  I&#39;m just a little worried on what would happen to them.  I hope everything will be okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing that, Joey chuckled and said, &quot;You really remind me of Mary, always worried about me going to Vietnam to serve my country.  Look, if I know my daughter, she is a strong and independent woman.  She knows how to take care of herself.  As for Jeff, he knows how to look after my precious Amy.  Both of them will always look out for each other and will be happy together on their anniversary trip.  Have a little faith in both of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie heard his opinion and still wasn&#39;t sure.  She remembered that during dinner last night, Amy seem to be a little frisky with Jeff.  And strangely enough, Jeff sort of liked it.  But they were once teenage brother and younger sister and now they are just a husband and wife just flirting over each other.  Is it possible that the changes in age made them super horny.  Better yet, were what she experienced last night were the after affects of her regressing back to a teen.  If that&#39;s so, then she would be concerned of what would happen between Jeff and herself during that week.  With a sigh, she said, &quot;I...guess you have a point, Grandpa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Darn tottin&#39; right I have.&quot; he said in his old grandpa saying, &quot;By the way...  Do you have a special someone in school?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie heard that and blushed in shock.  &quot;Grampa Joey!  Please!  That&#39;s a touchy subject!&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey laughed a little and told her, &quot;It&#39;s nothing to worry about, princess.  This is the same high school I met Mary when I was your age.  In fact, your mom met you dad at the same age too.  So it is basically a tradition within the family.  If you ever have a special someone in that school, then you must take the opportunity.  You may never know when that opportunity would come again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie listened to him and turned away blushing.  Pretty soon, the thoughts of Jeff&#39;s friend, Antonio came to mind as she was trying her best keeping her teenage hormones in check.  &quot;Uh...  Sure...  Of course...  I&#39;ll be sure to find that someone.&quot;  She was feeling embarrassed as she hope that this ride is over.<br />
<br />
Suddenly...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;re here.&quot; Joey said.<br />
<br />
Hearing that, Jamie looked out and saw her high school with teenage students heading in to start the school week.  It was a three story high school that goes around the block with a wide variety of classes to partake in and a huge sporting field in the middle of it for various activities.  In fact, there is a banner over the school entrance that is talking about Big Homecoming Game between her school&#39;s football team and the rivals one town over on Friday night.  Jamie sees the school as Joey looked on with nostalgia in his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;My...  How much this place has changed.  Back then, it used to be just a one floor school that goes in a line.  Now look at how advanced it has become.  If I was your age again, I would&#39;ve enjoyed what this place has to offer.&quot;  He looked to her granddaughter and told her.  &quot;Now you better be off now.  I don&#39;t want you to be late for class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie was awestruck that her school was different back when she was once a single mother.  Now looking on, she was as a student heading in to experience what Jeff experiences.  Shaking off that thought, she said, &quot;Right.&quot; before opening the door of her passenger seat before heading to the backseat to get her Taylor Swift backpack.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...  You want me to pick you up after class.&quot; Joey said to her.<br />
<br />
Jamie placed her bookbag on her back and was about to say something.  But a new memory popped up in her head and she realized something.  Shaking that thought, she looked to her grandfather and said, &quot;Actually, I have to be at cheer practice after school.  This Friday night is the big homecoming game and I need to train to cheer for my team.  Think you can pick me up afterwards?  It ends at 5:30.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey heard that and smiled.  &quot;Of course, Princess.  Anything for my precious grand daughter.  See you then.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Joey drove off and returned home with Jamie waving to him.  As soon as he was gone, she turned to the school in front of her and gripped the straps of her book bag.  &quot;Okay...  First day as a teenager in this school.  Let&#39;s make this the start of the best week ever.&quot;  With that, she walked down to the entrance with the some prep in her step, ready to begin her new life as a teenager for a full week.</p>
