<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ahote got home about 15 min later.  He immediately headed to the shower.  The warm water reenvigorated his muscles.  After washing his long hair, he soaped up his body, massaging each muscle.  When he got to his cock, he started stroking.  Those 3 were hot.  He could tell the shorter one and the tall black bodybuilder were in love, but the third...he started to finger his ass, thinking about the third guy...he had noticed him checking him out while he was running.   There was something about him...just them he exploded, launching cum.  He finished washing himself, grabbed a towel and dried off, before wrapping it around his waist. <br />
He walked into his room.  Park noticed it had changed slightly.  All of his soccer clothes and trophies were replaced with lacross gear and trophies.  Mixed in win the Korean things were now Native American totems and books.  Park was thoroughly confused by what he was seeing.  He wanted to create someone that would make Jae regret what he said.  Now it seemed like he was driving in the backseat.  He walked over to double check the settings but the program said it was updating.  He laid down on the bed wondering what he might have done wrong in the program before passing out.<br />
---------<br />
The next morning Ahote woke up well rested.  He smiled at the tent in his sheets.  He reached down and started to slowly jerk himself off.  He had dreamt of that soccer player.  For some reason, every time he jacked off, he felt more like himself.  He walked over to the computer and brought up his favorite porn site.  But he couldn&#39;t get the soccer player out of his head.  As soon as he tried to picture him without a shirt, he came.<br />
After showering, he tied his hair back, threw on a muscle t, some board shorts and his black Osiris clones. He considered his options but decided on heading to the park with his board.  He had felt so tired since moving to the area and wasn&#39;t sure why.  Each day he felt a little better, but he was still having blackouts.  Like he couldn&#39;t remember what happened after taking a shower yesterday and he didn&#39;t remember going to bed.  When he dreamt, it was a Korean boy about his age.  The soccer player was also there. Both he and the Korean boy were kissing passionately and then he was in the Korean boy&#39;s body until it morphed into his body and he was kissing the soccer player.  As he daydreamed, he slammed into someone.<br />
&quot;Ow!  Sorry about that, I don&#39;t know where my...&quot; He grabbed the hand that was extended, feeling a shock go through his body.  He lost his balance, falling backward and pulling the person on top of him.  At this point he was mortified but had no place to look except at the person on top of him.  All he could see was the top of the guy&#39;s head, spiked black hair.  He could feel his muscles, and the warmth of his body felt so good.  A bit of the boy&#39;s sweat trickled onto Ahote as it glistened on the stranger&#39;s black hair.  He wanted to run his fingers through it. He could feel the stranger&#39;s cock growing and it was causing his to respond. Rather than getting right back up, the stranger looked up and smiled. <br />
Finally he said &quot;Wow!  I guess we&#39;re both clutzs.&quot;<br />
Ahote couldn&#39;t believe it.  This was the guy from his dreams!  He had the same brown eyes, black hair with red and blond highlights.  He had an amazing body.  He then realized that this was the soccer player from yesterday.  <br />
Brushing some of his hair back, he blushed and rapidly said &quot;hey don&#39;t worry about it!  It was definitely my bad to begin with because I wasn&#39;t paying attention.  Although I guess I was lucky this time, I always wanted have a hot guy fall into my arms!&quot;<br />
Jae blushed.  &quot;Im flattered.  Normally I&#39;d see where things go but my bf and I had a fight and that pretty much ended things.  The last I heard he switched school...but that was 3 weeks ago. So yeah...&quot;<br />
---(wait what?!?!  No how can that be???? I set this to only last 3 weeks!!! What&#39;s going on?!?)-- Ahote shook his head, wondering where that bad come from.  He could see the pain in Jae&#39;s eyes as he helped him to his feet.<br />
Jae thanked him, &quot;you&#39;re new aren&#39;t you?  I&#39;ve seen you around but can&#39;t figure out where.  You should come and meet my friends.&quot;<br />
&quot;We kind of met and kind of didn&#39;t.  You got hit by a soccer ball in the head.  I was about to offer you an Ice pack but you ran off before I could introduce myself.&quot;  He put his hands behind his head and looked away, blushing &quot;From what I could see, it kind of looked like you were...checking me out&quot;<br />
Jae turn about different shades of red.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be embarrass...I was actually flattered!  No one has ever taken a ball to the head for me.&quot; He smiled.<br />
As Jae, started to skated off, Ahote grabbed him by the arm and pulled him off the board, catching him in his arms.  &quot;Whoa!  Hang on now.  Will you stop running already and learn to take a compliment?&quot;  They both jumped back.  &quot;I&#39;ve actually already hung out with some of your crew...Ty and Luca.  They&#39;re really worried about you.  Actually from what they&#39;ve said everyone is.    They said you&#39;re so sullen and depressed now, and it not like you.&quot;  He pulled Jae into a hug  &quot;Look I know you don&#39;t know but sometimes talking to a stranger can start the healing process.&quot;  Jae then just collapsed in Ahote&#39;s arms, crying.  Ahote let him cry it out, running his hands up and down Jae&#39;s back.  A few elderly couples passed by and either gave them a dirty look or made remarks under their breath.  Ahote just smiled and popped them the finger.<br />
When he finally calmed down, Ahote picked up both boards, taking Jae by the hand saying &quot;Come on.  I know a place we can talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
They walked for about a half hour, Ahote never letting go of Jae&#39;s hand but neither said a word to the other.  They walked around the woods, until they finally got to a stream, secluded from the world.     When they got there, Ahote set the boards down and took off his tank top.  He spread it out on the ground near the stream and told Jae to sit. Jae refused at first, not wanting to get it dirty but Ahote wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer.  He had kicked off his sneakers and dipped his feet in the stream.  Jae shrugged and did the same.<br />
<br />
They say in silence for a few minute, until Jae finally opened up.  After that it was like a dam had burst.  He told Ahote everything.  About the maker, the after effects of the confrontation with the coach and what led to Park leaving him.  Ahote just stared in disbelief.  To show him that he wasn&#39;t some lunatic, Jae pointed to the yellow roses bush on the the other side of the stream.  He told Ahote to watch.  To his surprise they turned red.  Ahote couldn&#39;t believe what he was seeing.  &quot;You&#39;ve done this to people??&quot;  <br />
Jae nodded.  He explained the people he had done it to and that they knew and preferred their life now over the past.  <br />
&quot;It sounds to me like you&#39;ve angered Kokopelli.&quot;  He smirked.<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
&quot;Kokopelli is the Hopi trickster God...&quot; Ahote said as he was had walked over to the other side of the stream.  He had plucked the one of the roses and smelled it.  He then walked back across &quot;but he&#39;s also a storyteller...and...&quot; He sat down again, this time much closer, &quot;a healer.&quot; Handing the rose to Jae.<br />
--**no no no no**--  <br />
Jae looked at the rose and then at Ahote.  What was it about this boy?  He reminded Jae of someone but he couldn&#39;t put his finger on it.   He laid back, putting his hands behind his head to stare at the clouds.  Where ground should have been, he felt Ahote&#39;s hand.  Ahote removed his hand, and lay down on his side next to Jae, propping his head up with his hand and arm.   Jae tried not to be obvious as be looked the tribal design around his 20 in bicep.  Ahote had been staring at the sky, and as he was turning his head to stay something, he could have swore he saw Jae close his eyes.  <br />
Jae had hoped he didn&#39;t get caught.  He had hoped he closed his eyes before he could be embarrassed.  Suddenly he felt warm lips press up to his, as the sucked on his lower lip.  He let out a sigh as he felt Ahote&#39;s tongue enter his mouth.<br />
--**no no no this wasn&#39;t supposed to happen!**--<br />
Jae opened his eyes briefly and saw Ahote, leaning over him, eyes closed.  Jae reached up, putting his arms around Ahote.  Ahote felt Jae&#39;s arms around him and suddenly he had been pulled down on top of Jae.  Ahote ran his foot up and down Jae&#39;s legs until their legs became intertwined.  Jae ran his hands up and down Ahote&#39;s muscular back and through his hair, accidentally untying the pony tail.  Ahote&#39;s hair cascaded down both sides of his head.  As they continued to make out, Jae had managed to slowly reposition himself, until they somehow both ended up sitting, briefly.  Ahote took the opportunity to quickly strip Jae of his shirt, putting behind Jae&#39;s head before slowly laying him back down.  Ahote ran his tongue up and down Jae&#39;s body, driving him wild.  Unable to reciprocate, he teased Ahote&#39;s nipples while his other hand dug into his shorts and grabbed his cock.  Then as Ahote made his way back to Jae&#39;s mouth, Jae latched on to his ear, sucking on it and then his tongue up to Ahote&#39;s mouth.  Ahote then took Jae&#39;s cock into his mouth, running his tongue up the sides and teasing the head, as he inserted 2 fingers in Jae&#39;s ass.  He nearly came right there.  Jae spit into his hand and the reached down and ran his hand up and down Ahote&#39;s cock, removing his own shorts.  Ahote looked up, uncertain but Jae reached down and guided Ahote&#39;s cock to his waiting hole.  For some reason Jae needed this badly...it couldn&#39;t remember the last time he got laid or with who.<br />
--**this wasn&#39;t supposed to happen like this**-- the voice screamed for a sec.<br />
Ahote grabbed Jae&#39;s legs and put them up on his shoulders.  He then gently entered Jae who let out a moan.  As Ahote slowly went in and out, he leaned dow, hair cascading, and kissed Jae with utter passion.  Ahote had never made a connection like this...sure he&#39;d hooked up with guys but he never felt anything this.  He supported himself with one arm as he continued to kiss Jae, with the other arm he grabbed Jae&#39;s cock and started to stroke it.  Jae was amazed at Ahote&#39;s stamina.  As he quickened the pace, Ahote could feel himself getting close.  As the kissed, Jae run his hand up Ahote&#39;s muscular arm as he other hand teased Ahote&#39;s nipples. He then wrapped both his arms around Ahote, as he felt him tense up.  With what almost seemed like a road, Ahote came, causing Jae to cum.  He felt Ahote collapse on top of him.<br />
Jae brushed the hair out if Ahote&#39;s face, gazing into his big brown eyes.  He wanted to say something but at the moment words escaped him.  He could still feel Ahote in him and had no desire to get him to withdraw.  The 2 just stared into each other&#39;s eyes, kissing occasionally, but neither saying anything.  After a while Jae took control, now fucking Ahote.  Finally they collapsed on the riverbank, Ahote had his arms around Jae, bodies pressed together, losing track of time and falling asleep.</p>
