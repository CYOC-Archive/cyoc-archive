<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*ding-dong*<br />
Rita opened the door, finding a lovely, well dressed teen girl standing there patiently.<br />
&quot;Ah, you must be Tonya!&quot; Rita greeted, beckoning the girl in.<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am. Thank you for hiring me!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, well thank you for taking this on so last minute. I know it&#39;s a strange request.&quot; <br />
Tonya enters the grand house, taking the spectacle in. Of all the things she thought she&#39;d do over the break, this was definitely not on that list.<br />
&quot;Now, all I need from you is to stay with her so she doesn&#39;t get into trouble. I&#39;d like hourly updates on her location, status, and state of her underwear, okay?&quot; Rita asked, as if it&#39;s the most normal thing in the world to say. Tonya kept her poker face strong, already starting to feel a tad uncomfortable.<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, got it! Will do.&quot; She responded with as much fake cheer she could muster. Rita gave her a genuine smile before handing her a bag. A diaper bag. It took everything in her power not to react too strongly at being handed something she was expected to use to change her best friend. &quot;That should have enough supplies in there for the day, but if you need extra go ahead and buy them, I can reimburse you. Also don&#39;t forget to lock up when you leave, Leah has a spare key. Questions?&quot;<br />
Tonya kept her smile wide, hoping the older woman couldn&#39;t see through her façade. &quot;Um, where is she?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, of course. You&#39;ll find her in the guest bedroom to the left there. She&#39;s currently wearing a diaper, but she&#39;s allowed to wear training pants outside if she wishes. Teenagers, am I right?&quot; The old woman chuckled, making Tonya truly wonder if there was actually something wrong with her. She kept it to herself and nodded. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll just go meet her.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright, go have fun, and try not to get pregnant!&quot; The woman said with a wave as she walked out the door. Tonya waited until the door closed, locked, and her footsteps could no longer be heard before she let herself burst into laughter.<br />
&quot;Oh my god, what the hell?&quot; She chuckled to herself, moving towards the guestroom door. She didn&#39;t think twice before opening it, feeling no need to knock; the two have been close friends for so long, they could walk in on each other masturbating and not bat an eye. <br />
&quot;Holy shit, you weren&#39;t kidding.&quot; She said as she walked in. Leah jumped, no doubt surprised. Tonya saw her take something from her mouth and shove it into her pocket, but paid it no mind. What she DID pay mind to was her friend&#39;s attire. Leah, the tiny teen who despised being treated like a baby more than anything, dressed up in cute little overalls covering an obvious diaper bulge. The image was enough to give anyone pause. Tonya could count on one hand how many times the girl dressed up in childish attire, and she always thought Leah looked adorable. Now was no exception, with even Leah&#39;s embarrassed indignation looking like a toddler pouting. Of course, Leah hated few things more, so Tonya has always kept that to herself.<br />
&quot;I knew you said you were dressed like that, but...wow.&quot; Tonya said with faux admiration, making a little frame with her hands as if taking a picture. Leah rolled her eyes, but couldn&#39;t stop a smile from budding.<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah, my eyes are up here.&quot; The shorter teen joked, gesturing to her diaper then to her eyes. Tonya&#39;s glad she can joke about it at the very least, making Tonya feel a little less tense. In all honesty, she has no idea how to react to the situation.<br />
&quot;So I take it Rita bought it?&quot; Leah asked, crossing her arms. She was still tense, not as relaxed as she normally is with Tonya--not that she could blame her, given the incredibly awkward get-up. Still, it hurt a bit. After all this time, does Leah think Tonya would judge her? If anything, she kind of wants to encourage Leah&#39;s new attire, but knows that&#39;s entirely inappropriate; being forced to wear diapers in any scenario is humiliating, and entirely not fair to Leah. Tonya winked and finger gunned.<br />
&quot;Yep! Hook, line, and sinker. Even told us not to get pregnant!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh my god, she didn&#39;t.&quot; Leah said in exasperation, but not surprise.<br />
&quot;Yep! Man, what a crazy person to be stuck with.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just glad it worked. Honestly, I don&#39;t think I could take anyone else seeing me like this, especially not a stranger. Thanks again for doing this for me.&quot; The relief in Leah&#39;s voice had a weight of it&#39;s own. Just how rough were the past few days? <br />
&quot;Well, now you&#39;re free from your Aunt&#39;s weird reign, at least for the next few hours. Get some real clothes on, and let&#39;s get out of here!&quot;<br />
Leah&#39;s face dropped, and...oh, there&#39;s that tension again. She&#39;s no longer comfortable, or worse...hiding something. Tonya&#39;s smile dropped.<br />
&quot;Leah, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
&quot;I, uh, kinda need to wear these.&quot; Leah mumbles out. Tonya blinks in confusion.<br />
&quot;Cause you aunt wants hourly checks on your underwear to make sure you&#39;re wearing diapers? Come on, Leah, I can just tell her you were wearing it. You don&#39;t have to put up with this.&quot;<br />
Apparently that was the wrong thing to say, because Leah grew more tense, and her rosy cheeks turned redder. It was at this point Tonya realized there was more going on here, and she was starting to get very concerned. Leah has never been this guarded around her, and she had no idea why.<br />
&quot;Alright, I should probably start at the beginning.&quot; Leah said in a quiet voice, not looking Tonya in the eyes, &quot;Tina and I were in this new department store, and I...&quot; she paused, cheeks reddening further &quot;...I kinda wet myself.&quot;<br />
&quot;You &#39;wet&#39; yourself?&quot; Tonya asked in disbelief. Of all the things, the choice of word stuck out the most. It sounded so...infantile, the exact opposite of what Leah would use. Leah cringed but nodded.<br />
&quot;I wet my pants. It was a total accident, but...yeah. I needed to change clothes, cause...I mean, Tina always treats me like a little kid, I really didn&#39;t want her to see, so I...kinda just grabbed what was nearby to replace my clothes. That just so happened to be clothes from the toddler section, so I *sigh* I end up putting on toddler clothes and training pants cause I didn&#39;t have many options. Then Tina sees me, and...&quot; once again she pauses, and looks up at the ceiling as it it murdered her mom, &quot;...and I told her I was dressed that way to see if I could pass as a little kid for a day. Tina took it too far, and started treating me like a toddler. So by that point, it was far less embarrassing to just pretend I was a toddler and not some weird teen dressed like a toddler because she just kept making really dumb mistakes.&quot; <br />
Tonya couldn&#39;t help but look absolutely baffled given just how insane the story was. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but...you did what? Is this real?&quot;<br />
Leah&#39;s face tensed further, and she stiffly nodded, still not looking her in the eyes.<br />
&quot;Okaayyy...why did you tell her that?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; She droned, clearly more baffled by her own behavior. <br />
&quot;And why didn&#39;t you just-&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, okay?!&quot; She snapped, and Tonya shut her mouth. It&#39;s weird, and kind of an embarrassing story, but...<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that have to do with-&quot;<br />
&quot;Do you remember your brother&#39;s party a few weeks ago?&quot; She looked both impatient and afraid. What the hell is going on? Leah looks like she wants to be anywhere but in that room with Tonya, and it&#39;s breaking her heart a little.<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, of course. I remember Tina came, but heard you couldn&#39;t make it.&quot;<br />
&quot;I was there.&quot; Leah said in a defeated tone, eyes closed tight, &quot;That whole story earlier? With acting like a toddler? It happened on the same day.&quot;<br />
Leah&#39;s voice sounded like she was on the verge of a panic attack, making Tonya scramble to make sense of the story. So, Leah was forced to...act like a toddler? But she was at her party, even though Tonya was sure she didn&#39;t see her? But she was apparently with Tina at the time, who Tonya does vaguely remembered seeing at the party with a-<br />
And then it clicked. The little kid that was banging on the bathroom door, and ended up having an accident. Tonya came out and saw the girl standing there with a clearly used diaper, bawling her eyes out. She remembered feeling bad, but not wanting to be around a kid in a dirty diaper, and didn&#39;t pay her anymore mind. Thinking back...how the hell hadn&#39;t Tonya recognized her? <br />
&quot;Y-you were that girl with a-&quot; She stopped herself, but the implication was enough to make Leah immediately burst into ugly tears. The tension, the secrets, the weird distance they had for the past few weeks suddenly make sense.<br />
&quot;I-I *sniff* I&#39;m sorry! I was so *sniff* so embarrassed, I didn&#39;t know what to do!&quot; Leah screamed through her violent sobs, &quot;And-and then, she wanted me to do it again *sniff* and-and *sniff* it&#39;s not an act anymore! I-I keep *sniff* keep having accidents. I wet the bed! I suck my thumb without thinking! I-I don&#39;t know! I don&#39;t know anymore!&quot;<br />
Without thinking, Tonya crossed the room and swallowed the smaller teen in a hug, letting her brain process things while she tightens her embrace. So Leah was forced to act like a baby (kind of?), and now...she was kinda becoming one? The diapers...she needed diapers now? And most of all, she never told Tonya because Leah was embarrassed Tonya had seen her at her absolute lowest and never even knew? Her  brain was getting hazy from the toxic cocktail of guilt, confusion, discomfort, and a tinge of excitement? None-the-less, the situation was clearly far more complicated than she could ever imagine. What the hell was she supposed to say to this? She wracked her brain while Leah absolutely drenched her shirt in tears and snot (far from the first time). As Leah finally started to calm down into whimpers, Tonya released her and met Leah&#39;s eyes for the first time. She eyes were big and vulnerable, and absolutely terrified. She saw her hand twitch and her lips pucker...something that she picked up from babysitting when a kid wanted to suck their thumb but stopped themselves. <br />
&quot;A-are you weirded out?&quot; Leah asked in the softest, most heart wrenching voice. Tonya could feel her own emotions swelling as she finally got her thoughts together. &quot;Leah...&quot;</p>
