<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A couple of days later and after signing so many pieces of legal papers signing away wavers for almost everything under the sign Taylor formally Tyler was finally heading toward the transformation center. Her stuff had been moved into a storage locker or sold off. <br />
<br />
Mythtopia had multiple parks based on different types of mythical creatures but behind the scenes was a massive community where the employees all of whom where transformed people lived. One of the areas was the welcome and transformation center where new employees were transformed and employees who had finished the terms of their contract where transformed back into humans. <br />
<br />
“Miss Taylor.’ Said a nurse who looked like a elf only with darkish skin and pure silver white hair came forward while she was standing in the waiting room of what looked like a hospital. It took Taylor a moment to realize the nurse was a drow or a dark elf.<br />
<br />
“Here.” Said Taylor as the nurse nodded her head.<br />
<br />
“Please, follow me.” said the nurse as Taylor followed the nurse back into a rather large room with a couple of machines along the wall and of all things a pair of straps hanging from hooks in the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Once again a lawyer went over one final contract which she signed after reading it over before a doctor this one some kind of lizard person gave her one last physical.<br />
<br />
Taylor looked down at the mistake between her legs one last time, the manhood which she had been cursed with since birth. Part of her was actually somewhat sad to see it go but that was more because once everything was done, she would no longer be a transgender woman but a full women, a centaur women yes but once she has done her contract she would become a human again, only this time she would be a full women. <br />
<br />
What came next was rather strange but when you thought about it made sense. They had her strip and then stand, in the center of the room before the nurse put the straps which hung from the ceiling under her arm pits. <br />
<br />
“This is to prevent you from falling over.” Explained the nurse as the doctor prepared three needles. <br />
<br />
“This may pinch.” Said the doctor as he put the first needle in on her right hip and the second one in her left hip. “Those where pain killers, because growing a new pair of legs can be painful.”<br />
<br />
“I know, I am ready.” Said Taylor, she had read some blog post explaining how the transformation process worked. <br />
<br />
“Alright, here we go.” stated the doctor as he injected the final shot, this one much larger than the other pain killer shots. <br />
<br />
There was a long moment when nothing seamed to happen then a strange feeling began to come from her ass. She twisted her head just in time to feel something burst from her ass, what came out as a long jet black hair, she moved her ass and the hair flicked with ease. She now had a horse tail. <br />
<br />
Soon the hair was the last of her concerns, as she looked down to see her toes had fused together into a black mass as her toes/feet become hooves. She didn’t feel any pain per say, it was more of a something a kin to getting a cavity filled by a dentist only it was around her hips. She watched as two masses began to grow as a second pair of feet, these one horse feet began to grow. Her lower body began to grow in size as well as her ass moved backwards as she began to take on the appearance of a centaur body. The restraints loosened a bit as she grew in size, horses were bigger then people after all. <br />
<br />
She would never get to watch as the mistake between her legs finally went away, that was out of her view but she did feel it as it became smaller and smaller before finally going into her body.<br />
<br />
Then with tears in her eyes she began to watch as her upper body began to change, her skin became smooth as all the hair disappeared from her chest. Her shoulders became narrower as her hands became much more feminine. She felt her face change, but she couldn’t watch that. Then with tears in her eyes she watched a pair of breasts begin to bud from her chest. They grew and grew, passing A cups, B cups, C cups and ending either large D or possibly even E cups. <br />
<br />
She grabbed her chest, letting out a soft moan as she felt her new breasts but with tears in her eyes. She finally had real breasts of her own, she was a women in every way. <br />
<br />
She didn’t even pay attention to the final parts of the transformation. <br />
<br />
“We are done.” Said the nurse as she came over, this time with a small step ladder to remove the restrains. Taylor had grown in size so that the nurse who had been about the same height as her now only came up to her bust line. <br />
<br />
“Have a look at yourself.” Said another nurse as she wheeled in a mirror.<br />
<br />
Taylor took a couple of steps, her new hooven feet hitting the floor as she moved toward the mirror. What looked back at her was clearly a female face and a rather beautiful one at that. She could still see some of her old self within the features but now it kind of reminded her more of her sister/mother which made sense. Her black hair a trait she got from her father was still the same and even styled the same but she would fix that. She turned slightly to see a line of hair running down her back, a horse main like one would find on any horse. Her breasts were massive but firm, she would latter learn centaurs had muscles which acted like a natural bra. Her horse body, while not thin and graceful like a racing horse was covered with pure rich black fur which was rather beautiful. <br />
<br />
“I think you turned out great.” Said the nurse<br />
<br />
“Lets do a medical check and then you should be able to join the herd tonight.” Said the doctor</p>
