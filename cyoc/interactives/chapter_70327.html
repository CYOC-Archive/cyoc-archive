<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Listening to the deserted school, making sure that it was indeed empty and not even the janitor was still around, Neil slipped out of the crawlspace behind the bleachers and stared at the gym.<br />
<br />
After a couple seconds, which was roughly the amount of time his eyes took to adjust to the dim light, he reached back to where he'd been hiding and grabbed his backpack. Unzipping it, he began to take out the items he had been nicking from the lost and found for the past month, his excitement about what he was about to do growing as he touched and looked at each item.<br />
<br />
After taking out the seven items, Neil returned the backpack to where he had been hiding and figuring he would get it when he was done, he listened once more to the vacant school before slipping quietly across the gymnasium, glad that he had decided to leave his shoes behind.<br />
<br />
Out in the hall, he gazed up and down the dimly lit corridor and after a couple seconds, tightening his grip on the items he'd taken from the lost and found, Neil headed for the girl's locker room.<br />
<br />
Pushing open the door, glad that the toilets weren't locked after everyone had left, he fumbled for a moment until he found the switch for the main lights and flicking it on, he watched as the secondary lights switched off and the room was flooded with bright, fluorescent lighting.<br />
<br />
After engaging the deadbolt on the door, Neil walked around the tiled partition and stepped into the main room. Off to his left he could see the office of the girl's coach, now dark and no doubt locked. To his right were several rows of locker banks that stretched all the way to the far wall. If he walked a couple rows in, Neil knew that he would see an opening in the wall that went into the room where the girl's showered.<br />
<br />
Walking forward and through a doorway, Neil found himself in the part of the locker room that contained the toilets, sinks and several large mirrors. Dropping the items on the sink, he separated each garment, running a hand over each as he did so. Gazing into the mirror, his excitement growing, Neil forced himself to calm down.<br />
<br />
As he took another look at what he'd nicked, he listened to the locker room, still not fully trusting that the school was empty. Heading back into the first section of the locker room, Neil headed for the lockers and for a couple minutes wandered the rows, even stopping once to open the door that led into the pool. When he was at least satisfied that nobody else was present, he headed back to the area with the toilets and sink.<br />
<br />
Gazing at his reflection, a feeling of giddiness coming over him, Neil took a deep breath and than slowly began to undress, worrying over for a minute of what type of germs might be on the floor, but deciding in the end that girls were cleaner and that he had nothing really to worry about.<br />
<br />
When he finally stood naked, Neil peered into the mirror at his body, glad that he'd shaved off all his body hair. Thinking that he looked rather like a flat chested girl, and that his penis and testicles destroyed the illusion Neil began to fold his clothes and put them in a pile.<br />
<br />
After he'd done that, he took the pile of clothes over to one of the lockers and placed them inside. Gazing at the office of the girl's coach, Neil wished he had a padlock and curious about something, he headed towards the office and trying the lock, he was surprised to find it turning in his hand.<br />
<br />
Slipping into the darkened office, Neil paused and stood in the exact centre, peering about, wondering where, if anywhere, one might find a padlock. Spying a couple metal cabinets, Neil decided to try there first and opening the first one, he noted that it was only full of the stuff used for gym class. Shutting it, he tried the next one and when he didn't find what he was looking for, he was just about to shut it when he saw that there were several bikinis folded up one of the shelves, still with tags attached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I'll take a dip afterward,&quot; Neil thought as he took one of the bikinis and shutting the door, he peered into the next cabinet.<br />
<br />
On the fifth try Neil found a padlock and the number to open it. Feeling that it was appropriate to lock his clothes in the locker for the moment, Neil made sure everything looked the same way it had when he first came in before exiting the office and heading back over to the banks of lockers.<br />
<br />
Locking the locker, Neil headed back to where he'd left the garments he nicked and feeling that this time he was ready, he gazed at the bikini and decided he would try it on first, maybe seeing how it looked with the rest of the clothes.<br />
<br />
As he had never worn a bikini before, Neil struggled with it for a moment before finding that the only part he could actually get on was the top part and feeling ridiculous, he almost decided to take it off.<br />
<br />
Instead, he looked at the nicked garments for a couple second before picking up the sheer thigh-high stockings and sitting down on the sink, he slipped them on. As he did this, he thought how nice they felt against his skin and how they clung to his thighs just a couple inches shy of his groin.<br />
<br />
Next, he pulled on the skirt, which came down to about mid-point on his thighs, followed by the belt. Cinching it tightly, Neil marvelled at how he looked like a girl from the waist down and reaching for the shoes, he slipped his feet into them.<br />
<br />
At first he was afraid that they wouldn't fit as they pinched the sides of his feet and toes in an uncomfortable way. But after a few moments of shifting and wiggling his feet and toes, Neil was delighted at how the pinched sensation had vanished and that his feet actually appeared smaller while that shoes felt a couple inches bigger.<br />
<br />
Reaching for the tube-top, he pulled it on over his head and than, after adjusting it, disappointed that it didn't go well with the bikini top, Neil grabbed the denim jacket he had taken and shrugged it on.<br />
<br />
Again, at first it wouldn't fit and Neil hissed in agitation that he'd selected something that was too small. Struggling to take it off, Neil accidentally pulled it further on and feeling like he was going to rip it, he tried harder to take it off. But than, as had happened with the shoes, the tight feeling had disappeared and Neil found that actually the coat did fit and thinking, &quot;Just needed to relax,&quot; he reached for the hat.<br />
<br />
Noticing a pleasant odour coming from it, Neil pushed his face into the fabric and breathing deeply, he suddenly thought of spring and other things that smelled fresh and new.<br />
<br />
After a moment of just standing there, smelling the inside of the hat, Neil took his face out and plopped the hat on his head, noticing that it covered his head completely and that for some reason it made his face look rounder.<br />
<br />
Giggling out loud, thinking that what he was wearing really made him look like a girl, he leaned closer and whispered, &quot;Why even my ears appear pierced,&quot; and gazing down, he added, &quot;And this tube-top really does make it look like I have breasts,&quot; and giggling again, Neil turned sideways, struck a pose and than turned so that he was looking at his butt.<br />
<br />
As he did this, Neil let out another giggle and commented, &quot;My butt doesn't really look that big,&quot; and than stopped.<br />
<br />
Realising something was wrong, he faced forward and stared at his reflection, suddenly understanding that every time he had spoke or giggled he had sounded like a girl. Worried, but at the same secretly hoping that his dream had come true, Neil slowly reached up and began to undo the string noted at the back of his neck.<br />
<br />
As he pulled of the bikini top, Neil noted that his chest actually did stick out and that the clothes he was wearing had nothing to do with the way he looked. Dropping the bikini top on the sink, Neil shrugged out of the coat and taking a deep breath, he closed his eyes and not really wanting to open his eyes after he'd done what he was about to do, he reached down and pulled off the tube-top, noting that it felt strange as it passed over his chest as he did so.<br />
<br />
With his eyes still closed, Neil reached down and undid the buckle on the belt and loosening it a bit, he pushed down on the skirt until it slid down his legs and puddled around his feet. Taking a deep breathing, Neil opened his eyes and peered at his reflection.<br />
<br />
What he saw reflected back nearly made him cry out in alarm. Pulling off the hat, noting his hair spilling down past his shoulders, Neil dropped it on the sink as he took in the two mounds of flesh that now made up his chest, the smooth flat skin that started beneath his breast and continued down until it bulged outward in what Neil could clearly see was his penis and testicles.<br />
<br />
But than he noticed that something about his genitals appeared off and peering down and than back into the mirror, it took him a couple seconds to realise that his male genitals were way to small and that they looked more like something he had scene on the new-borns pictured in health class.<br />
<br />
Unsure how the transformation had happened, Neil stood there for a bit, just staring. Finally, closing his eyes, he took a deep breath and opening his eyes, he peered into the mirror and cupped his breasts, knowing that they were a C cup, but unsure how he knew this.<br />
<br />
Taking his hand away from his breasts, Neil gingerly touched his penis and testicles, noting that there was no feeling of arousal as he did so, and slipping his hand betwixt his legs, he touched the smooth skin. When it became apparent that he did not have a vulva, he took another deep breath and giggled in a nervous fashion.<br />
<br />
As he ran a hand over his legs, liking how smooth they felt and how flesh-like the stockings appeared, Neil thought for a moment. Unable to figure out how the change had come about, he decided to put back on the girl's clothes he nicked.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;Well they're mine anyway,&quot; he shrugged on the tube-top and the jacket and than put back on the hat, making sure his hair was up under it as he did so.<br />
<br />
As he reached down for the skit, Neil remembered the bikini bottom and feeling weirded out by the thought of wearing no underwear, he reached for the bottom piece of the bikini and sitting down, he tied the two straps in such a natural way, he thought that he must have been doing so for some time.<br />
<br />
Pulling back up the skirt and cinching tight the belt, Neil took one final glance in the mirror and stuffing the bikini top in his pocket, he wondered what his parents would think of him coming home looking like a girl. Turning away from the mirror, suddenly unsure of actually going home, Neil gazed at the empty locker room and let his mind wander, trying to decide what he should do and how it was that he'd transformed.</p>
