<br />
I loved this story but I wish it hadn't ended how it ended, with Edwin deciding to give up the muscle and beauty he had been given because he didn't feel it was moral keep it. This is my alternate version of what could have happened to Edwin if he had been convinced to keep the gift he had been given, how his personality would change. I am picking up from here:<br />

<br />
Once again, all credit to Clarence591 for inventing this great story. The first few paragraphs and all the characters mentioned below belong to Clarence as well.)<br />
<br />
<br />
The Story so Far: <br />
<br />
Edwin is a geeky college student who is being harrassed by the hottest jock on campus, Drew. One day he forms a friendship with a mysterious boy named Aaron who tricks him into stealing Drew's looks and muscles, but not his jock spirit. Edwin transforms into an incredibly sexy and beautiful jock with a legendary cock, gaining the height and the strength, and even realizes he is gay when he has his first sexual experience with his ox-like teammate Rich, but he rejects his former life and his friend Sam, who is quite taken with his new jock self. Ultimately Edwin discovers that Aaron is actually himself from the future, and through the use of a magical disc, he was able to come back in time and turn Edwin into the man he always wanted to be. But when Edwin discovers that in stealing Drew's muscles he has ruined his life, he has a change of heart. The final straw is when Ed uses his new jock persona to reject Sam in spectacular fashion. And so we continue...<br />
<br />
Dramatis Personae:<br />
<br />
Edwin - A nerd who is given the jock body he's always longed for, but regrets it. <br />
Drew - the jock he takes it from.<br />
Ed - Edwin from the future. He has become a selfish jock who cares about nothing but sexual pleasure and dominating others.<br />
Sam - A boy in love with Edwin's new body.<br />
Rich - Edwin's teammate and first sexual experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Since when did Edwin become violent when he got angry? And when did he start calling people faggot? Sam was right; he was behaving like a Sigma man. This is what Edwin had feared. His physical transformation was changing his mindset. Would it only get worse over time? Maybe it was out of his control. People constantly complimenting you, worshipping you, begging for your attention, doing anything to please you had to cloud your thinking. That’s basically what Rich said happened to Drew. Edwin was falling prey to the same condition. Maybe the way Drew acted wasn’t totally his fault. What’s the old political saying; absolute power corrupts absolutely. That appeared to apply to this situation too.<br />
<br />
Edwin removed the disc from the portfolio. He dropped the envelope and held the disc in both hands. He looked at his room, then at the staircase in the hall. He moved toward the hall. He climbed the stairs until he reached the roof. He walked to the edge. He held the disc at arms’ length in front of him. A warm breeze wrapped around him exposed skin. It fluffed his wavy hair and rushed up the legs of his shorts. The circulating air tickled the pubes of his huge ball sack and kissed the head of the dinosaur. The incredible sensation sent a chill up his spine. All the muscles in his body contracted. He watched his forearms throb with strength. He removed his left arm from the disc and bent it to make the muscle grow. He watched the ball of power ebb and flow as he flexed several times. He put his hand on his chest to feel the seductive pillows of hard muscle. He pinched his rubbery nipple before caressing the carved bricks that protected his stomach. Edwin’s eyes began to tear up. He worked his hand under the waistband of his shorts. He squeezed his balls hard. He wanted to feel the sting from torturing his over sized twins. He inhaled sharply, it hurt so good. He squeezed harder wanting to remember the sensation.<br />
<br />
His fingers explored the incredible length and girth of his manly masterpiece. A tear ran down his cheek. He pulled out his hand and wiped the tear away. His skin felt smooth under his thick fingers. He traced the contours of his stunning face. He combed his fingers through his soft, wavy mane. He looked up at the star filled heavens. “Goodbye, Ed.” He opened his right hand and held his breathe.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Edwin realized he couldn't move. He was frozen in space and time. Try as he might his brilliant, enormous muscles wouldn't budge. He had become a living statue.<br />
<br />
Fog rolled into Edwin's dormroom and all the physical around him seemed to become less real. What was happening? Edwin suddenly felt a sense of fear. Was this the consequence of breaking the magic?<br />
<br />
&quot;I tried to warn you,&quot; A voice said. Aaron's voice. Edwin couldn't move from the window, couldn't turn around to see. &quot;I told you what was best for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn't the real Aaron. It was the... the him, from the future.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin felt his body obey in spite of himself. He turned around and there stood Aaron, looking sick. Edwin tried to urge his body to tackle him, to run, to throw the disc, but nothing responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you're going to hand that to me and then go sit down on the bed like a good boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin complied, hating himself for every moment. Now his future self, that selfish monster, had the disc. Somehow Edwin knew the game was over.<br />
<br />
The moment the disc was in his hands, Aaron suddenly began convulsing, his body shaking every which way, violently slamming around. Then suddenly, Aaron dropped to the floor, yet the disc floated in the air, ghostly. Then Edwin realized he could see a pair of small hands clutching the disc, attached to scrawny arms, which connected to a body, slowly filling into reality. Before him stood a man, himself, or the old him, in 20 years. Ed looked at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin licked his dry lips, carefully choosing his words. Maybe he could talk him down. &quot;How? how are you doing this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's dangerous to use this much magic. They warned me that if I used too much of my power, the magic could get out of control. That's why I couldn't change your mind. It would have completed the spell and made the changes permanent, but I knew if I did, we would forget we had ever changed in the first place, but the magic would be left behind, and there would be nobody to control it. In fact, anyone could control it. Today I was having the most amazing sex with these three hot twinks, and suddenly, I was smaller then them, I was nothing. They were disgusted with me and they left, not realizing how they had gotten there. And instantly I knew, remembered... you had destroyed it. I had to stop you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... Ed... if you remembered everything, you must know it was wrong. It's wrong to steal someone else's life!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Edwin!&quot; Ed growled. &quot;YOU don't know! You don't know the regret that will stalk you every day for the rest of your life if you do this! You don't know how sorry, how truly sorry you will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin began to cry. He looked like a spectacle, the handsome, enormous, 6'4&quot; jock crying like a little baby. &quot;But it's wrong. We don't deserve to live then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it's so wrong, why am I still here? Why do you still grow up and seek out the magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
They stared for a long time at one another, seeing the truth of one another's words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will Aaron be okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ed shook his head. &quot;That much is up to you. Every minute I am here I steal another year of his life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;You brought this upon yourself. So it's up to you. Cooperate or seal his fate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin closed his eyes, and then finally, opened them. &quot;What do I have to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ed smiled. He looked sinister. &quot;Well, we have a guest.&quot;<br />
<br />
A small figure entered the room from the mist. Edwin shuddered. &quot;Drew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure is,&quot; Ed said with a laugh. &quot;Now both of you, on your knees in the middle of the room.&quot;<br />
<br />
A zombified Drew complied and Edwin was helpless to resist his body's compulsions. To Edwin's horrified eyes, he saw that Ed's body seemed to be flickering between two realities. The wimpy reality he had almost brought back on himself and the future Ed desired, the man, the monster, becoming more solid and there all the time. Edwin was slightly thrilled and slightly scared to realize this alternate, muscled Ed was really, really turning him on. His cock hardened.<br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; Ed said. He flicked his hand and Drew began to caress Edwin's monster cock. &quot;Deep down inside, you understand. You're on my side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never,&quot; Edwin said bitterly.<br />
<br />
Ed frowned. &quot;Grasp hands.&quot; They did so. &quot;Man, Aaron's life force gives me so much magic... so much power... now brace yourself. I'm going to enter your mind. Prepare, because this is the end of the Edwin you knew. I'm going to finish the spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin shut his eyes, fear filling him up, and then it was all gone. All that was there was a comforting presence, a voice, and in front of him, Drew. He...</p>
