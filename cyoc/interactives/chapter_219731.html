<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I left Noah&#39;s temporary Weredragon design up for others to fill in. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Noah took a step back, his hands shaking, before yesterday he had always thought weres were fantasies, and now he was being offered the chance to be a weredragon! The problem was that in the past hours he had spent with Moonclaw&#39;s pack he had grown fond of them, more importantly he had grown fond of her. Would their friendship change if he was a weredragon? Could weredragons and werewolves even be friends? What if the weredragons were insistent that he stay with them, could he return home? What would his parents think? What would his father think? &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot; His voice faltered. &quot;I just can&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; The stranger spoke, her eyes borrowing into him, suddenly Noah felt like he was the one being tested. <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to stay with her, Moonclaw, maybe one day I can join their pack if they will let me.&quot; He spoke from his heart and then looked down a sudden realization dawning on him, maybe this was the only way he could help the pack. &quot;If I say no, will the weredragon clan not help Moonclaw?&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragoness rolled her shoulders and fluttered her wings. &quot;If I say no, would that change your mind?&quot; She asked curiously. &quot;Would you give your humanity to help this child?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If it saves their lives I would.&quot; He balled up his fists.<br />
<br />
The weredragon chuckled and stepped forward, stroking his cheek. &quot;Don&#39;t worry dear, this is only a test for her and her pack, by sunrise you will be a human again, I know your heart yearns to join her as a wolf.&quot; She cooed as a blush covered Noah&#39;s face, was it that obvious?<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I will do it, as long as it is only temporary!&quot; He said confidently, slipping out of his shoes. &quot;What do I do? Do you bite me?&quot; He asked closing his eyes momentarily, anticipating the pain that her fangs would bring. <br />
<br />
The dragoness shook her head and slowly she began to grow, what was once someone that was similar in height to him grew twice as large, and then five times as large, her body lost all human definition as her neck extended further and further, popping along the way as new bones grew in place. Her muzzle pushed out, forcing more and more fangs in, a fire glowing in her throat as smoke rose from her nostrils. Behind her a thick tail, thicker than Noah&#39;s body coiled around the boy, it&#39;s scales brushing his side as the weredragoness lowered her muzzle down and ran her forked tongue over his face. &quot;If I were to bite you, it would mark you permanently, this is more personal.&quot; She bellowed in a deep growl that shook Noah to his core. <br />
<br />
The Dragon&#39;s tail dragged him along the ground, keeping him in a grip that was both gentle and tight, for Noah it was imprisoning but as the Dragon lifted her leg he could see where she was aiming, a pulsing scaly slit between her legs. &quot;Enter and be reborn for one night.&quot; She commanded as Noah&#39;s face was pressed against the entrance, a smell like cinnamon wafted from the interior. Noah had never been this up close to any girls privates before, especially a dragon&#39;s, a mixture of excitement and fear filled him, but he knew he had to do this, he had to do this for Moonclaw. When the tail relaxed he took in a deep breath, kicked off his shoes, pulled off his underwear and shirt and gently parted the slit, his hand becoming wet with the warm slime that coated it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Only for tonight.&quot; He repeated, looking at the Weredragon&#39;s eyes who nodded in return, he took a deep breath and spread the slit open, his head pushing into the darkness, instantly muscles grabbed onto his head and began to pulsate around him, pulling him forward, up through his shoulders, his arms going limp as he went deeper and deeper into the darkness. He wasn&#39;t sure how long he traveled but soon he was surrounded by warmth, and fluid, he felt relaxed, his body going limp inside. He could feel a hard shell form around him, and vaguely felt it being pushed out of the dragon. <br />
<br />
The egg began to feel confining and Noah stirred, how long had it been, a minute? ten minutes? a hour? two hours? He pushed on the shell. He had to get back, he had to help her, Moonclaw, she dominated his thoughts even now. He pushed harder on the shell and it began to crack, fluids spilling out. He pushed again and the shell gave way, he tumbled free and hit the hard Earth, his body shivering in the cold. &quot;Welcome back Noah.&quot; The Weredragoness cooed, wiping the fluids from his eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just get this over with, if I can help her, let me help her.&quot; He coughed, his mouth struggling to work with the new muzzle.</p>
