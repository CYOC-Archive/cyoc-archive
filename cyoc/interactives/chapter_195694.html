<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as he had gone Charlotte said quietly to Maureen “That was wonderful. I owe you. He’s so shy and cute”<br />
<br />
“It’s the least I could do. It was obvious he likes you a lot. He just needed a kick along”<br />
<br />
“You have to stay and come out and celebrate with us. You’re a real friend”<br />
<br />
“Sorry I should be going. This will have to be my last. I’ll need to head off soon it will take me an hour to get home”<br />
<br />
Charlotte replied. “You would be welcome to stay. We have a spare bed since Special K is sharing Steve’s” Earlier Maureen had gathered that &#39;Special K&#39; was the nickname that the other Kirsty (Not Maureen&#39;s daughter) was called.<br />
<br />
“I should get back tonight. I have something I need to do tomorrow” She could hardly tell Charlotte that she needed to change back into her own body<br />
<br />
“Working?” <br />
<br />
“No just meeting a friend”<br />
<br />
“So you don’t need to be back tonight then. Besides you’ve had a couple of drinks you really shouldn’t drive”<br />
<br />
“This is only my third”<br />
<br />
“You look about 19. Am I right?” Maureen nodded. She guessed she was about that age. “And how long have you had your licence for? I’ll bet you are still on zero blood alcohol”<br />
<br />
Maureen realised Charlotte was right. In this state Under 25’s were allowed no alcohol in their blood when they drove. She said “I’ll be fine” but instantly Maureen began to fear what would happen if she was pulled over. How would she explain who she really was? She had no licence but had found an identity card belonging to her daughter. If she was pulled over by the police she had planned to say she was her daughter Kirsty but had misplaced her licence. But could she risk her daughter losing her licence and gaining a drink driving conviction?<br />
<br />
“No you won’t! You are now my friend! I won’t allow you to go. Give me your car keys!”<br />
<br />
The slightly raised voice bought Mason and Sean out of the adjacent rooms and a half dressed Clair from the girl’s unit. Claire voiced “What’s going on?”<br />
<br />
“Maureen is intending to drive back to her house. This is her third beer and she is on zero blood alcohol. I’m demanding her keys. She can stay in your bed”<br />
<br />
Steve looked at Maureen and simply told her. “You are staying the night or catching a taxi. We can’t allow you to drive. Give me your keys”. The voice was very commanding.<br />
<br />
Liz’s home was an hour away and she did not have the money to pay for a taxi ride that far. She saw she had little choice. If she didn’t drink any more she would be fine to drive home in the morning. She took the keys to Liz’s Mazda from Liz’s handbag and handed them to Steve. <br />
<br />
“Good decision” said Charlotte. “Where is your car? Is it safe? We have two parking spaces that none of us are using” <br />
<br />
“It’s across the road. I can see it from here. That red Mazda” Maureen pointed out Liz’s car.<br />
<br />
“I’ll put it in the car park where it will be safe” said Charlotte “I have only been drinking Coke” she alerted Maureen.<br />
<br />
Maureen’s mind was rushing. Would should she do? She saw no choice but to stay the night. She would have to let Liz know she might be a bit late in the morning. Letting Charlotte park the car in a safe spot was the sensible thing to do. It was preferable to leaving the car parked by the beach. Liz need not know that Maureen had allowed someone else to drive her car. Consequently she said nothing when Charlotte took the keys from Steve.<br />
<br />
With Charlotte gone the half dressed Claire led Maureen back to the girl’s unit where they ran into &#39;Special K&#39;. Claire explained why Maureen was going to stay the night. Special K approved and showed her the bedroom where she had stowed her clothes but was not using the actual bed. “It’s all yours” She looked at Maureen sizing her up. “You look about my size. I’ll lend you a dress you can wear out tonight”<br />
<br />
“I’ll just stay here”<br />
<br />
“Don’t be silly. You’re our friend now. Besides it will be good to have even numbers. I’ve seen you glancing at Sean. You can’t pretend you don’t find him attractive”<br />
<br />
Maureen blushed and said “But I have a boyfriend back in town”<br />
<br />
“So? He’s not to know. We certainly won’t tell him. You may as well have some fun”<br />
<br />
Maureen thought of Roger and Liz. No doubt by now they were dressed and waiting to be picked up by Paul and Ginny. Roger would be having fun, why shouldn’t she. “Okay. Why not?”<br />
<br />
“Great!” Kirsty seemed genuinely happy. “I only have a couple of dresses appropriate for clubbing” She opened the wardrobe. “I was going to wear this” she pulled out a green dress “But I also have this one” she pulled out a charcoal coloured satin dress “I think the charcoal would look great on you”<br />
<br />
The dress seemed very skimpy. It would have looked slutty worn by an overweight fifty year old but now Maureen had a slim 19 year old body. She no longer had anything to hide. Besides she had just spent half the day in a bikini. The dress was less revealing. “Thanks” She accepted the charcoal dress.<br />
…….<br />
Back in town Liz had just revealed herself to Roger. She twirled for him in the brown wrap dress. She was wearing the tallest heels she could find in Maureen’s wardrobe. In fact they were from the wardrobe in the other room where Maureen had found the green shoes that had changed her into her daughter. These shoes were silver with 4 inch heels and clearly not shoes that Maureen wore often. It looked as though they had barely been worn at all. She had teemed the dress with gold hoop earrings and a simple gold necklace, she actually thought the wedding ring on her finger was all the jewellery she needed.<br />
<br />
She had convinced Roger to wear a jacket and tie and thought he looked spiffing. She enjoyed it as he complimented her attire. She accepted that she had made Maureen look as desirable as she possible could. It even appeared that she had a waist. Despite being fat she felt really good and was excited about the night ahead.<br />
   <br />
Liz heard the ‘Maureen’ phone buzz indicating that she had a message. She had been a little puzzled that she had not had a reply from Maureen up until this point. <br />
<br />
The message was simple. “All’s good. Enjoy your evening. I might be a little late in the morning”</p>
