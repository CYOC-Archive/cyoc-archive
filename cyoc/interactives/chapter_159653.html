<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As much as Ben wants to mess with his newly acquired ability, he knows that time is of the essence for any successful operation, since it will give the enemy less time to counteract. Even though he is in a different body, movements are intuitive to control. He thought, &quot;Got to give credit to all the researchers here. This nanoparticle mechanic is actually working very smoothly. I was half-expecting minor lapses in consciousness, given past failures. That certainly boosts my confidence about this whole project.&quot; He proceeds to tell Matt that he will start the mission right away, thinking that he will learn the rest along the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good. Mr. Darcy has already provided me the necessary information to get started, since he had a meeting to attend at this hour.&quot; Matt pulls out a folder. Inside, there are papers describing a profile about a Halcron intern named &quot;Seamus Jones&quot;. Apparently, he is a recent graduate in software engineering who just recently joined the company. The picture of him shows he has short blonde hair with brown eyes. His build is average but fit. &quot;Not a bad host, certainly better than this one,&quot; Ben thought. He then asked, &quot;Why choose him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have recently been tracking him in our surveillance. Because he recently joined the company, we assume that he won&#39;t have many responsibilities in work, which helps to keep a low profile. Remember that you don&#39;t have direct access to their memories, so you will have a hard time impersonating the host if there was no research done beforehand. While his profile here is a good start, it is certainly not comprehensive, and we want to minimize any suspicions from their company, especially the higher-ups. This company has some advanced technology hidden inside, and they might be more dangerous than we anticipated. His intern position will probably not give us much room to inspect, but our purpose here is to just get the general picture here, focusing on their software department. Since nanoparticles only last about 24 hours in a body, one workday will be the time limit here. Just try to gather as much info as possible, note other potential hosts we could look into, and we can work from there for the next plan. Is everything clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt, are you sure you&#39;re just a researcher, since you know quite a bit about this mission here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ben, before I joined the research department, I was an agent myself, until I got into an accident on the job,&quot; Matt trails off slightly, hiding his suddenly sad expression. &quot;...But that&#39;s not important right now. The point is that I&#39;ve known Mr. Darcy for several years now, and I serve sort of an information link between the research department and the rest of the agency. Now, it is almost time to start. We know Mr. Jones&#39; schedule, so he should be arriving at Halcron soon. We should hurry up and intercept him before then. Mr. Darcy has already prepared a ride for you upstairs. We wish you the best of luck on this mission.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that said, Matt points Ben toward a set of clothes meant for his current body. Once he gets changed and retrieved a small bag of essentials, he headed towards the entrance of the building. Along the way, he is surprised at the amount of energy his host has. Being a old man, he certainly still packs quite a bit, more than he anticipated before. It is hard to imagine that this body came from a failed test, and its rightful owner is already deceased. Perhaps it&#39;s from those &#39;modifications&#39; Matt mentioned earlier, or from his nanoparticles getting accustomed to their function. Arriving at the entrance, he locates the chauffeur who will drive him to his destination. Soon after, he arrives a block away from the headquarters of Halcron. According to the information, Mr. Jones should be passing through here soon. After being dropped off, Ben sits at a nearby bench to wait for his prey.<br />
<br />
Soon, he sees Mr. Jones sauntering down the sidewalk, with a black briefcase in hand. Ben waves his arm to grab his attention. As Seamus comes toward the bench, Ben says with the most feeble voice he could muster, &quot;Young man, you seem to be quite strong. Could you do me a favor? Can you carry me to that portable potty over there? I have a terrible leg, and I&#39;m afraid I might fall and injure myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, Seamus accepts and wraps Ben&#39;s arm around his shoulder as they slowly amble over to the toilet. Once inside, Ben settles himself on the seat and asks if Seamus can wait for him to walk him back to the bench. He agrees as he closes the door to the toilet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh. It&#39;s good that he is a nice guy. I feel bad for taking advantage of him, but it is for the job,&quot; Ben thought. Remembering the instructions, he slowly eased himself of the control over his old host, leaving the body on an &#39;autopilot&#39; of sorts. Instead of having conscious control, Ben can only control through sending signals to reflexes. the nanoparticles will detach from the brain to move toward the renal system to be eliminated. This manual control is only possible in the surrogate, as normal hosts don&#39;t have the modifications to perform such control. (Normally, the nanoparticles would slowly detach, leaving the consciousness with gradually less control over time.) As this process continues, Ben could feel his senses fading into blackness. In the last second, Ben intentionally made his body slip from the seat, producing a thud on the floor. <br />
<br />
As expected, Seamus steps in to notice that the old man has slipped onto the floor, with pants down. He starts crouching down, asking if the old man is alright. Suddenly, drops of urine spurts out to the floor, and Seamus jumps back, his back leaning on the door. He pulls out his phone to dial for help, failing to notice the small nanoparticles traveling towards his mouth.<br />
<br />
After losing all control of his host, Ben felt nothingness. He did hear the door opening before losing the control though, indicating that Seamus heard the thud. After a few seconds, the nanoparticles sent one last impulse to eject the nanoparticles by urine. Once out of the body, Ben could detect a warm body nearby through the onboard infrared sensor, and he feels the nanoparticles quickly inching the way towards the open orifice of the body, the mouth. As he propels toward the new body, Ben could feel his speed decreasing, as the liquid used to propel the nanoparticles starts to evaporate. But it is still more than enough to enter the mouth. Once inside, Ben could feel the nanoparticles targeting the brain of his new host and establishing control. Slowly, he felt his senses returning.<br />
<br />
When Ben opened his eyes, he saw that he was now leaning on the door with a phone in hand. Looking at his phone, he saw the emergency number punched in, but the call wasn&#39;t dialed. Turning off the phone screen and putting in his pocket, Ben remarked, &quot;Luckily, I got to this body on-time before he called for help.&quot; <br />
<br />
Looking over himself, Ben noticed that he was now wearing Seamus&#39;s black work suit. Opening and closing his hand, Ben realized that the transfer went smoothly. He was now in the body of a Halcron employee, but probably just as important, he was no longer in a feeble body. He felt like his more youthful self again. But before he celebrated, he quickly composed himself and stepped out of the toilet, with briefcase in hand. He was told before that the agency would take care of the surrogate host, so he could just leave it alone. Making sure the door is shut tight, Ben walked toward the Halcron building in his new &#39;disguise&#39;.</p>
