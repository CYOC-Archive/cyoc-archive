<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After dinner, Jeff was asked to help his Mom clean up while Brianna went to use the bathroom (an excuse she gave in order to leave the room and use the device). As it was just him and his Mom, his Mom didn&#39;t hold back and got right into it. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, she seems like a real keeper.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, oh... well she is very sweet and we do seem to get along well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, so... what was the real reason why you didn&#39;t eat much at dinner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, that&#39;s a little...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh! So she actually does have one? I knew it.&quot; Said his mom with a proud smile. &quot;Just be careful with your teeth, alright. I am sure you don&#39;t need me explaining how biting it would not be appreciated. Oh, and while sucking does help, don&#39;t do it too hard, or for too long or else you may hurt her or cause a blood vessel to break. Keep it enjoyable, but just don&#39;t go too far. It helps to pay attention to the face as well, as their expression says a lot about how well they are enjoying it too. So don&#39;t just close your eyes. Sex is all about having proper communication between loving and consenting partners afterall.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, that&#39;s a little...&quot; began Jeff, but he was interrupted by his Mom. <br />
<br />
&quot;Also, I know they are not normal, but you still should wear protection too, just in case. You are still far too young to become a mother. And while I do want to one day hold my grandchildren, I can still hold out for a few more years. Trust me, the last thing I ever want is for my daughter to suddenly be overwhelmed with becoming pregnant with twins. Just the thought of how large your boobs can swell already brings me enough concern as it is. If they each had a life within them as well, and you and Brianna were in no place to support a family with at least twins... I just can&#39;t... the thought of it just worries me sick. So please do not rush this and be sure to use protection, and I will get you some birth control too, just in case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Mom. I don&#39;t plan on getting pregnant anytime soon. I don&#39;t even know if I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why couldn&#39;t you? You have 2 working wombs don&#39;t you? All it takes is a little seed in either one and you may become pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... um...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaa, it seems I am too late. I&#39;ll go out and get some things tonight, so don&#39;t worry. But I am happy that you finally found a boy who loves you enough to do this with you. And he is nice and very polite as well! I am sure he loves having you as his girlfriend too. So be sure not to lose him, alright my daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daughter? Mom, aren&#39;t I your son?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? Why would you be? I mean, I&#39;d you want to be called as such, I can respect that. But you are most certainly my daughter until you request otherwise. But are you that unhappy about being a young woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? No, wait... hold on a minute, I need to check up on something first.&quot; Jeff exits the conversation and runs over to the Chronivac to find Brianna sitting next to it with an expecting smirk on his face. &quot;Hey their, Honey&quot; he says with a laugh. Jeff shakes her head. &quot;What did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much, I just changed our label genders. Physically we are still the same as before, just now everyone believes you are and always have been a girl, and I a boy is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It seemed like fun. Plus, I have 2 dicks while you only have one. And vise versa for pussies too. Oh, I also made you able to conceive twins as well, but it would take a lot of my cum to impregnate you. And I mean a lot. Like several orgasms worth. So we can continue doing it raw without worry as long as we wait a little bit in between each creampie for it to all drain out of your tits. Maybe one day we can do it though, if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a wave of relief wash over her. She wasn&#39;t pregnant. She did want to have children one day, but it was much too early still. Though she was glad that Brianna was at least willing to have them with her one day. Wait, no. Why was she so happy to hear that? She didn&#39;t want to be the one carrying their unborn children, and in her boobs no less. But the thought of being a mother was warm and comfortable. It was a happiness that she would love to feel one day. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you didn&#39;t change any other settings Brianna? Nothing to do with our minds or anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all. I only clicked on the opposite gender option for the both of us. That is all.&quot; Reassured Brianna. He said it with such confidence that he had convinced Jeff that he was telling the truth. And so she choose to believe him. Brianna grabbed her arm and pulled Jeff over next to him before pulling her head in closer for a kiss. Jeff practically melted in her boyfriend&#39;s arms, and wrapped her arms around his back. She eagerly joined in and returned his kissing in full. <br />
<br />
But she broke off the moment she felt her breasts swell up 2 cup sizes. She knew if things were to continue, that she wouldn&#39;t likely be able to hold herself back and would welcome Brianna&#39;s dicks to fuck her. Or maybe she would blow him again instead. She was quickly becoming addicted to the taste after all. <br />
<br />
She was about to say something when Brianna grabbed ahold of the front of her tits and slipped his middlefingers underneath her top and into each of her pussies. Jeff tried her hardest not to moan. And when Brianna sat down, she too sat down upon his legs, facing him with her arms still wrapped around him. She knew that she was completely smitten with him. Her love for him may be rather new, but it was strong nonetheless. She had just given her breast virginities to him after all. <br />
<br />
So while Brianna fingered her pussies, Jeff didn&#39;t put up any resistance. In fact, in order to not allow herself to make a sound, she had sought after and successfully found his lips again. Kissing him would keep her quiet, or at least muffled. She didn&#39;t know why she was so into Brianna now all of a sudden. But she also couldn&#39;t deny that it made her happy. <br />
<br />
Brianna was happy that Jeff was being so receptive of him. He felt a little guilty however, as he had made one other change which he didn&#39;t share. Jeff normally shouldn&#39;t be like this, but his change caused her to be like this. What Brianna had changed was that he made Jeff a lot more open to things. She wouldn&#39;t automatically shy away from new things anymore, and was a lot more honest with her feelings. <br />
<br />
He knew she was into him, but had not expected her to be this into him. Not that he could complain though, as he was into her just as much. Jeff was almost at her limit and pushed Brianna&#39;s hands away from her now quite massive breasts. After catching her breath, she looked at Brianna and asked &quot;please spend the night here?&quot;</p>
