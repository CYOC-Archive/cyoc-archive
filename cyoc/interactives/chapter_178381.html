<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex relaxed by the fire as Eli worked, letting his nerves calm. He felt, off though, and when he finally took the wolf pelt off his shoulders he noticed why. He hadn&#39;t really looked to check on himself after the encounter, and unfastening the pelt brought his attention down to his own torso. &quot;Eli! I think something&#39;s wrong.&quot; Alex rubbed at his chest, the hair there having grown markedly thicker. Still not to Eli&#39;s chest covering, but considering it was mostly fuzz this morning and he now had a quite noticeable patch of hair on his chest as well as a inch wide strip up his stomach, it was remarkable.<br />
<br />
Eli looked up and came over. &quot;You said he didn&#39;t penetrate you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He didn&#39;t..&quot; Alex blinked as Eli pushed aside the kilt covering Alex&#39;s lap, revealing his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still human.&quot; The hunter let out a sigh. Alex remembered the cock was the one part of the werewolf that hadn&#39;t changed when he was knocked asleep. &quot;He must have dribbled some of his fluids on you. Those can change you a bit but not infect you. I wouldn&#39;t worry about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what Chel said is true? Cum changes you? He said..&quot; Alex sounded worried as he looked down at himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chel.&quot; Eli shook his head, interrupting. &quot;That fae, that&#39;s a bit simplistic. It depends. Human cum doesn&#39;t do anything, no innate magic in the species. Species with a bit of magic in them, like elves and orcs, you may notice some small changes, but you&#39;d need to fuck a few dozen to really start changing species, unless it&#39;s magicked up to be more potent. Fae and were creatures. Well, fae are pure magic as it is, their cum is potent and they can even force the changes.&quot; The hunter motioned at Alex. &quot;Were creatures. Their cum is charged with transformative magic, almost instantly effective. Enough that their pre can even cause some changes, but it takes their cum to pass on the magic completely.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nodded slowly at the lecture, his eyes down a bit, feeling embarrassed that he needed this explained. &quot;You really aren&#39;t from this world. I keep forgetting that. Sorry, Alex. This is something people of this world are used to.&quot; The stew was simmering away, so Eli took a seat next to Alex, arm around the younger man&#39;s shoulders. &quot;I&#39;ll introduce you to one of the wizards I know in town. If he doesn&#39;t know how to help. And if the hairy chest bothers you, it&#39;ll go away with the other changes when you take the purging potion. Honestly. I think you look good with a little chest ruff though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex smiled and leaned in against Eli. Even after their run and fight, he didn&#39;t smell. Alex knew he must be a bit pungent himself, but Eli smelled earthy and woody. His skin was warm against Alex&#39;s. &quot;Sorry you have to deal with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli snorted. &quot;I could have just saved myself the effort and left you to the wolves, but I got a soft spot for helpless kids lost in the woods.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a kid.&quot; Alex said, just a bit defensively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not anymore.&quot; Eli said as he reached over and ran his fingers through the thicker hair on Alex&#39;s chest. God that felt erotic, especially as Eli found his Chel enhanced nipples. &quot;This though, you&#39;ll have to live with. It&#39;d take fae magic to undo what that dryad did. Lucky that&#39;s all he did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t.&quot; Alex admitted, looking up to Eli. &quot;He made sure I&#39;m, um, flexible enough to take you. Asked me to consider staying with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli coughed a little in shock and peered down at Alex. &quot;He really is a fucking horny, little pest. Trying to hook me up with a mate, it&#39;s none of his business.&quot; Eli got up and began to strip, folding up his kilt and setting it atop his boots. Alex watched, always surprised how good the hunter looked just striding around naked, how natural it seemed. &quot;I&#39;m going to take a dip while dinner cooks. You should come join me. Water might be a bit cold, but it&#39;s refreshing.&quot; And with that he was headed to the cave entrance, and passing through the waterfall with a splash.<br />
<br />
Alex sat in the cave for a moment, watching the fire. He wondered if his family was missing him yet, but his thoughts kept drifting to Eli outside. Eventually he stood and stripped down himself, setting his clothing off to the side of the cave and went out to join Eli. Alex leapt through the water fall instead of taking the path to the side, landing with a splash in the cool water. The sun had started setting, and only dim light filtered through the trees above casting the whole pond in shadows. Eli floated in the middle of the water, hands folded together on his chest, did his lips quirk into a smile when Alex popped up, pushing his wet hair back out of his face. Alex swam a lap of the pond, enjoying the ease at which his new muscles pulled him along through the water. A little overweight before, mostly for baby fat he still hadn&#39;t shed, he never really enjoyed going to the pool before, but he didn&#39;t have the same reservations anymore, besides, only Eli could see him and he traipsed after him naked through the woods for a few hours.<br />
<br />
Eli drifted over to the rock wall by the waterfall, where there was an underwater ledge that made a convenient seat to sit and soak, just watching as Alex swam around. &quot;You&#39;re awfully quiet.&quot; Alex said as he finally went to join Eli on the outcropping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just not used to human company.&quot; He said with a smile. Alex could see through the crystal clear waters to Eli&#39;s lap, where his cock was fully at attention, something that seemed to happen quite a bit when Alex was naked around him. He reached over and wrapped his hand around the shaft. Even under the water it was warm to the touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you stop me this morning?&quot; Alex said as he began to stroke Eli off. The hunter didn&#39;t stop this, only leaned back with his eyes closed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want you tying yourself to me.&quot; Eli bucked his hips a little against Alex&#39;s hands, a small deep growl coming from low in his chest. A sound of pure pleasure, but he continued as Alex kept stroking his cock. &quot;You have to learn. Sex here is a form of magic, the more intimate, the more powerful. And there&#39;s nothing more powerful than becoming one like that. I can also smell the.. innocence on you. You&#39;ve never fully been with another man.&quot; Eli turned his gaze towards him, hand drifting up to caress Alex&#39;s cheek. &quot;The first time? That&#39;s more powerful than anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said there was no danger with a human.&quot; Alex said softly, scooting in closer until his body was pressed up against Eli&#39;s. He leaned in to kiss the hunter on the lips, and when he didn&#39;t move away he leaned into it eagerly. Eli returned the kiss at first, tongue darting between Alex&#39;s lips. He felt Eli&#39;s cock twitch a little in his hand, then the hunter pulled back. He reached down and pulled Alex&#39;s hand off his cock right before he would have cum.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re assuming I&#39;m human. Come on, dinner should be ready.&quot; Eli started swimming back towards the waterfall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you stop me?&quot; Alex sighed, moving into the water to follow as Eli hauled himself up and out of the water. <br />
<br />
&quot;Even my cum in the water could affect you. Just trust me on that. Enough questions.&quot; Alex found his next question stick in his throat. Unable to be spoken. That promise was starting to get annoying. He followed Eli back into the cave. At least dinner smelled good.</p>
