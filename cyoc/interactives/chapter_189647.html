<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric watched as female and male admirers swarmed around Jon.  Jon was an all-star athlete at their high school and Eric couldn’t figure out which version of Jon was his favorite.  As he was now, all bulked up for football, or in the Spring when we dropped all the extra padding and strutted around with over 250 pounds of rippling muscle when he was captain of the wrestling team.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Eric he did not have anything in common with Jon.  Where Jon was popular and outgoing Eric was a nobody and very quiet.  In fact, hardly any of the students noticed him.  There was no comparison when it came to their bodies.  <br />
<br />
Eric looked down and took in his skinny arms, his flat chest, his weak stomach, and stick legs.  Eric thought it was safe to sneak at look at Jon.  He was so glad Jon chose clothes to accentuate his physique.  Massive thighs stretched the seams of Jon’s jeans, his muscular ass stretched out the back as his giant manhood fought for room in the front of his pants.  The front of his shirt was stretched by Jon’s massive gut and then further up it was strained by his large pecs that rested upon his muscle gut.  The sleeves of his shirt were being stretched by his huge biceps and boulder shoulders.  Resting on top of those shoulders could be found his bull neck and his superhero jawline.  As Jon brushed the hair from his face the light caught the ring that Jon always wore.  <br />
<br />
Eric took his eyes away from Jon long enough to realize it was the end of the day on Friday.  Time to go home to his miserable life.  His father was long gone, and his mother worked long hours to support them and was rather clueless when she was around.  To make matters worse they had just moved across town so she could be closer to her job.  Eric figured he would spend the weekend exploring the woods behind their new house.  <br />
<br />
¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬<br />
Eric was actually having a lot of fun exploring the woods.  They had recently had some storms in the area, so a lot of trees were uprooted and so many branches were hanging or bent at odd angles.  Eric continued to explore until he started to hear some music.  Eric thought maybe these woods butted up against the houses in the ritzy section of town, so he proceeded slowly.  Eric was careful to stay hidden behind the trees as a large backyard with a pool and expensive landscaping came into view.  It looked like this area had been hit hard by the storm - there was a lot of tree limbs and a couple of trees down. Suddenly a hulking shirtless man came around the corner of the house.  Eric’s jaw dropped as he realized it was Jon.   <br />
<br />
It must be Jon’s house, and it looked like Jon was moving all the debris out of their yard and getting quite a workout from it.  His torso was glistening with sweat accentuating his large arms and chest.  Jon walked up to a particularly big limb, gave it a yank, and nothing happened.  Eric couldn’t believe as he watched Jon try again as the limb continued to resist his strength.  <br />
<br />
After struggling a few more times Jon stopped to catch his breath and wipe the sweat from his face and his massive pecs.  Suddenly Jon looked around, placed his hand on the hand with his ring, and looked around one more time.  Eric thought it seemed like Jon wanted to make sure he was alone.  Eric wasn’t sure what was going on, but he made sure to stay hidden behind the tree.  <br />
<br />
Jon appeared to twist the ring on his finger and Eric saw the impossible.  The bicep above his hand with the ring appeared to grow.  The growth continued as his pecs raised up, grew firmer and bigger.  Next his muscle gut started to shrink as his waist got smaller until all the extra weight was gone, and a six pack was in its place.  Next the growth continued in his other arm until they both matched.  The changes continued on Jon’s body below the waist as his glutes shrunk a little but also got firmer and higher at the same time.  Finally, Jon’s leg muscles grew more defined than they were moments ago.  Eric couldn’t believe it – with one twist of the ring Jon went from ready to play football to ready to hit the mats in top form for wrestling.  <br />
<br />
Jon smiled as he brought both arms up into a double bicep pose.  He brought his arms down before he started bouncing his pecs and finally finished with a most muscular.  Jon strutted over to the large limb with determination etched on his face.  With a mighty bellow he picked up the large limb and began dragging it around the house.  Before long Jon came back into the backyard and looked at all the limbs that remained to be cleaned up.  He must have realized they were all smaller than the limb he had just dealt with because he looked around the yard again and gave the ring a twist.  Eric watched on in awe as Jon’s body softened and enlarged back to what it had been when Eric arrived a few moments ago.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly Eric had a plan, he wasn’t going to be a small nobody anymore because he was going to….</p>
