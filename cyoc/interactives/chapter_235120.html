<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zack returns home after an hour, he heads to his room and sits on his bed, the 12 year-old feels strangely tensed and somewhat frustrated, he started feeling this way around an hour ago, ‘I have to find a mommy soon,’ he thinks to himself, ‘if I don’t I’ll go crazy! Mom is out over the weekend and I don’t know where to find another female to be the mommy! Only Jeff and Shannon are around... wait... Shannon!’<br />
<br />
And it was with that realization that Shannon was nearby that Zack felt a sort of complete calm wash over himself. After confirming that his brother and girlfriend had dozed off while cuddling, Zack suddenly feels the strong urge to head to his brother’s room, without a second thought, the boy jumps off of his bed and starts to strip out of his clothes, throwing them to the floor, and makes his way to Jeff’s room.<br />
<br />
The naked 12 year-old enters Jeff’s room, finding his brother cradling Shannon, his soon-to-be mother in a big spoon-little spoon position, with Jeff wrapping himself around Shannon. Both were fast asleep and continued to sleep, even as Zack pulls the covers off of them, throwing them to the floor before climbing on the bed between Shannon’s legs.<br />
<br />
Zack looks down at his big brother, who seems to be sweating, panting and moaning in his sleep, along with Shannon who was still dressed in jeans and her casual wear, causing Zack to whimper in frustration as he thought: “How am I supposed to get into mommy, when her pussy is covered?” Zack whined before he deftly pulled the pants down and off of Shannon’s body.<br />
<br />
Zack wasted no time, the boy stretched his right hand out, his fingers pressing against the pussy, this causes Shannon to moan. Zack looks up, a smile on her face, “don’t worry, mommy,” he says, “I’ll be where I belong soon,” he then lowers his head, still smiling as he pushes his fingers slowly into Shannon, Zack’s hand soon follows.<br />
<br />
When Zack’s hand pops into the pussy, Zack presses the fingers of his left hand against the pussy and pushes, his fingers entering his brother&#39;s girlfriend, who lets out a loud moan as his pussy is stretched as Zack continues to insert his hand into him.<br />
<br />
Once both of his hands are inside his Shannon’s pussy, Zack can’t help but smile, “it feels so comfy and warm,” he says, “now… I really have to get into mommy,” with that he starts to push his arms into Shannon. Zack feels his hands pop into the womb, the boy grins as he wriggles his fingers, giggling when he notices the movement under Shannons’s skin. The 12 year-old continues to push his arms into Shannon, watching with glee as Shannon’s tummy starts to bulge and grow the more of him enters her teenage womb.<br />
<br />
The boy soon manages to insert his arms halfway into Shannon, Zack lies down on his tummy, stretching his body out, he then spreads his arms a bit, causing Shannon to groan in her sleep. Zack smiles at the opening, which is to small for his head, but the boy still lowers his head and starts to push it against the opening, gentle at first, but soon he presses harder against the pussy.<br />
<br />
Finally, Zack feels Shannon’s pussy start to open up around his head. Shannon’s groans of discomfort start to quickly chang0e into screams of pain as her pussy starts to get stretched unnaturally far as Zack continues to force his head into her, using his hands to grab the walls of the womb, using this to pull himself into her. He also uses his feet to push himself forward.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Zack’s programming, Shannon doesn’t wake up and continues to sleep, even though he feels the pain of something forcing itself into her, but Shannon is unaware of what exactly it is, then a faint whisper in her head says, ‘relax, Shannon. It is only your baby returning to the womb to be reborn,’ Shannon’s body even starts to relax.<br />
<br />
Zack’s head suddenly pops into Shannon’s pussy, luckily Shannon is still able to breath, the boy smiles to himself as he continues to pull and wriggle himself deeper into his soon-to-be-mother.<br />
<br />
The more of Zack enters him, the bigger and rounder Shannon’s tummy gets. In her sleep, Shannon even lays her hands on the bulge, cradling it. Her hands are matched with Jeff&#39;s protective support of her belly.<br />
<br />
Zack, meanwhile, has his body half in the womb, and is already rolling himself into the fetal position, only his feet still remain outside of Shannon, but suddenly with a pop, they vanish into Shannon’s body.<br />
<br />
Shannon pants, holding her huge tummy in her sleep, unaware that she has just unbirthed her boyfriend&#39;s little brother.<br />
<br />
Zack himself feels relaxed, warm and safe, the boy is able to see, hear, smell and even breath, when Zack feels something attach itself to his navel, he looks down and smiles when he sees that an umbilical cord had attached itself to him.<br />
<br />
The 12 year-old suddenly feels himself starting to get tired, he lets out a yawn and closes his eyes, while feeling himself starting to shrink, becoming younger and younger, as the cord seems to pump the years out of him.<br />
<br />
While Zack shrinks, so does Shannon’s tummy until it is once again it’s normal says, no trace of there ever been something inside of her, unaware that a little ovulum is patiently waiting in her womb. Once Zack had reached this point, suddenly both Jeff and Shannon awoke and felt incredibly horny.<br />
<br />
Skipping foreplay, both Jeff and Shannon fumbled with their clothes--though Jeff was thankful for Shannon having discarded her jeans and panties already, which made it all the easier for him to enter her once she had freed his own lower half from the imprisonment of his jeans and boxer briefs. Jeff and Shannon re-positioned themselves  a few times until at long last they found the position they trusted would work this time.<br />
<br />
It was over almost as soon as it had begun, with Jeff releasing his seamen in Shannon&#39;s awaiting and eager womb where Zack&#39;s ovum was met with a sperm from Jeff, effectively transforming Zack from Jeff&#39;s brother, to now his child.</p>
