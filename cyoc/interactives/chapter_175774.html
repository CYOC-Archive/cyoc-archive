<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Phil woke up the next morning a little earlier than he usually would and feeling quite energetic. His new body was craving exercise, and he was going to give what his body needed before he had to get ready for school. The jocked-out class clown got on the ground and started doing push-ups. This time he was doing the push-ups quicker than he was doing in gym class with more reps to boot. It was strange. Before, he used to hate exercising, but now that he was so muscly now, he loved it now and wanted to do more.<br />
<br />
After finishing up his last rep, Phil flipped around and did some crunches. He never thought he would get abs before, but now they had magically appeared on him and looked so good.<br />
<br />
Phill wanted to work out more but knew he needed to start getting ready soon, or he&#39;ll be late for school. Thankfully he still had that one set of clothes that used to be too big for him for a prank he did before. They&#39;ll fit perfectly on his new buffed out bod.<br />
<br />
Once he was ready, Phill put the jock jacket into his backpack and jogged to school to meet up with his friends.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
Phil arrived later at the meetup place, and if it wasn&#39;t for the fact the tips of Phil&#39;s hair was still green, his two friends might not have recognized him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, you&#39;re looking good, dude! You look like you came out of Michelangelo painting.&quot; Jax said while looking a little sleepy. Clark nodded in agreement, imagining how he&#39;ll look after his turn with the jacket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks! You guys have seen the pics I&#39;ve sent you, right? I&#39;m so big and ripped now. I&#39;ve gained 60lbs of muscle and burned off all of my fat! I&#39;d joke about being able to become Mr. Universe, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s too far from reality.&quot; After Phil had said that, he flexed an arm that was bigger than yesterday to prove his point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; Clark started, &quot;Anyway, I did research like I said I would and got some results. I did some reverse image search with the jacket and found that more than one of these things in existence. I definitely saw a photo of two people wearing the same jacket like this. I haven&#39;t seen any pictures of these jackets internationally, but I&#39;m sure there are some there too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I found out some things too,&quot; Jax added. &quot;I did some digging and found this forum on the deep web. Apparently, it was run by people that changed due to this jacket brand. None of the people I talked to there know where these jackets came from, but they have their theories. Some people think it&#39;s a government experiment; others say that a wizard interested in jocks created them. I&#39;ve even heard of people saying it&#39;s a gift from God or something. The that everyone says is that it seems like the jacket can cause people around the wearer to not notice the change and act like everything is normal. Apparently, the jacket can change reality if the change is drastic enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C-change reality?!&quot; Phil exclaimed in shock. Was reality changing around him?! But if that was true, why did Clark, Jax, and even Jackson from gym class seem to remember who Phil used to be?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I&#39;m not even done yet,&quot; Jax responded. &quot;It&#39;s theorized like the jacket can read your subconscious and adjust the change you go through accordingly. It&#39;s probably why we still remember how Phil was before. It&#39;s because Phil wanted us to remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, wonder rumors were about to go around,&quot; Clark muttered to himself. Considering that Phil was the class clown, it would make sense that he wanted as much attention as possible without it inconveniencing him. &quot;What about side effects? Are there any we should look for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there seems to be some sort of mental changes, but most of the time, it&#39;s just adding a fondness of working out and some sports knowledge. You&#39;ll basically be the same person before you put the jacket on, but a buff version of that. Drastic changes only seem to occur if the wearer completely rejects the changes that are happening to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
A wave of relief washed over the funnyman after hearing Jax&#39;s words. Sure some changes were going on in his head, but it seems like he won&#39;t lose himself and become a completely different person. All this talk about the jacket had got him curious about where these things even came from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that was a lot more information than I gathered. How did you get all that info, Jax?&quot; Clark asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I just got really interested in the jacket, and before I knew it, it was already 4am. Oh, speaking of which, I&#39;m going to go take a nap. Wake me up when study hall ends, okay?&quot; After he said that, Jax yawned and went to the school library to take that nap. You know most people wouldn&#39;t act so casually after finding a magic jacket, but not Jax. He was just as lackadaisical and a bit too relaxed as ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jax really is something else...&quot; The funnyman mused. He could only imagine a buffed out Jax acting roughly the same as he did now. Oh, speaking of the jacket, that reminded him of what he agreed to do. He opened his backpack, pulling out the jacket and handing it to Clark. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I&#39;ve been looking forward to this all day yesterday.&quot; There was a sparkle in Clark&#39;s eyes as he looked at the jacket.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, now that I think of it, being in the military and being a jock is two different things. I wonder what sort of jock you&#39;ll end up turning into then. Oh! I almost forgot I wanted to talk to coach Grayson about joining the weightlifting team. I&#39;ll see you at lunch, Clark!&quot;<br />
<br />
Clark waved goodbye, and before he put on the jacket, he pulled out his phone and looked at his &quot;Before&quot; progress photo that he and Jax agreed to take. He was so skinny and short in that picture, nothing like his father. Yet, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn&#39;t put on any muscle. Well, today, that will change. Clark put on the jacket feeling the tingly warmth the jacket gave as it slowly began to change him. As long as this jacket can help him achieve his dream, he didn&#39;t care what sort of jock he&#39;ll become.</p>
