<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Faded, like a dream, Chris could just barely remember her life as a boy. Sitting on the toilet, she could vaguely recall that, when she had been a guy, she hadn&#39;t peed sitting down since she&#39;d been younger, sometime before she&#39;d been five. But even as the weird feeling continued to grow, and more and more of her life as a girl asserted itself, Chris felt her bladder release. Hearing the stream of urine spray into the toilet, she didn&#39;t bat an eye when she reached for some toilet and began to wipe herself when she finished.<br />
<br />
She did however pause when she reached for a bit more toilet paper and saw blood on her fingers. For a fleeting moment, he male self reasserted itself and she was frightened and disgusted by the little bit of blood. But even as she thought, &quot;Christ. What&#39;d she do to me. Am I dying?&quot; her female self reasserted itself, stronger, and she understood what she was seeing meant.<br />
<br />
Again, she didn&#39;t even flinch as she finished her business, reached over and down into the area under the sink. Grabbing a blue box, she shook out a tampon, unwrapped it, shifted in place and proceeded to slide it in. Feeling weird about having used such an intimate and feminine product, Chris stood. The sensation leaving her as her mind assured her she&#39;d been using such products for about a year or so, she took one look at herself in the mirror before heading toward the sink to wash her hands. Finishing that, she reached for the clothes on the sink.<br />
<br />
It was as if she had done it hundreds of times, which her memories insisted as set about getting dressed. Pulling the strapless bra on over her head, she ran her fingers through her hair and gently pulled up so it wasn&#39;t caught in the back. Glad it wasn&#39;t too long, she then adjusted her breasts so that they rested comfortably in the cups. Afterward, she pulled on the panties, finding them as soft and comfy as the bra. The tank top, shorts and sandals next, she turned and peered at her reflection.<br />
<br />
A quick tease of her hair and after she&#39;d taken a scrunchie from one of drawers on the sink, she tied her hair back in simple ponytail. Another look in the mirror and she whispered, &quot;You can do this. Get through the next twelve hours and you can go back to how you were,&quot; and starting to reach for the door knob, but stopped. Finding she was still shocked and suprised by how natural it seemed being a girl, how much she knew, the way she felt, Chris leaned against the sink. Placing the heels of her palms on the cool surface, feeling the lip pressing into her bum, she took a shuddering breath and tried to find a way to get herself to accept that, for the moment, she was a girl, but only managed to whisper in astonished tone, &quot;Oh, god. Tanya, you did it. I did it. We did it. I&#39;m a girl. An actual, real girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Inside her room, Tanya told her friend, &quot;Okay, we&#39;ll see you around six,&quot; and hanging up the phone, she breathed a sigh of relief. Leaning back in the desk chair, she heaved another sigh, still trying to come to grips with that, somehow, Nancy now believed Chris was a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;And not just any girl, but that she&#39;s my sister,&quot; Tanya thought and sending the chair so that it was swivelling, she wondered what was keeping Chris. Thinking about the amulet and what she&#39;d read, she had never expected that it would change reality, and found that not only was she stunned that it had, but also dazed.<br />
<br />
Her mind going to new memories she felt threatening to intrude, she found she could actually recall growing up with a younger sister. Somethings were still the same, like their dad bailing on them a couple months after Chris had been born, and their love of basketball. But other things, intimate stuff, things she could only share with another girl were different, like discussing boys, advice on clothes, make up tips, and experiencing monthies. Thinking about this stuff, she had a brief flitting thought about finding a way see if she could convince Chris to remain as a girl, but then changed her mind. Reaching out to grasp the desk and stop the chair from swivelling, she looked at toward the bedroom door. Wondering what was keeping her sister, she was tempted to go knock on the bathroom door, &quot;And maybe take a peek and see if anything in the house has changed,&quot; but remained where she was when she head a door open.<br />
<br />
Not really paying attention, Chris wandered down the hall and toward her sister&#39;s room. The door open, she entered, as her memories insisted it was all right to do so, and flopping down on Tanya&#39;s bed, she grabbed a body pillow and curled herself around it. Thoughts roiling, she looked over at her sister, who said, &quot;So. How it is it. I mean, it clearly worked. So, how does it feel to be a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Confusing,&quot; Chris immediately replied and clutching the pillow tighter, she said, &quot;I&#39;m having my period. And I am not sure, but I think the amulet turned me gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Surprised what she was told, Tanya stood, crossed across her room and as if she&#39;d done it before, she flopped down on the bed behind to Chris. Hugging the other girl close, she whispered, &quot;I&#39;m sure it will be fine. I mean, you do know what to do with, well,&quot; she faltered as, for a split second, she felt like it was like she was talking to a guy, but then getting over it, she said, &quot;tampons,&quot; and getting a nod from Chris, she asked, &quot;So what do you mean you think the necklace made you gay? You mean you&#39;re attracted to girls? If so, that&#39;s all right. There&#39;s nothing wrong with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; her younger sister whimpered. &quot;It&#39;s not that. It&#39;s like I said, it&#39;s confusing. My mind, it&#39;s like it is still changing. Somethings, like understanding how to dress myself, or what do when it&#39;s my monthy, are, well, feminine. But other things, I am still struggling with. Like, it almost as some of my mind is still to be male, so I am forced to to come to terms with being attracted to boys,&quot; and before her sister could say anything, &quot;I remember that there was this cute boy in my class last year. And I wish he had ask me to the dance last spring, but instead he stayed home. So, as I said, I think the amulet made me gay,&quot; and heaving a sigh, she added, &quot;Maybe not. I don&#39;t know. As I said, confusing,&quot; and enjoying the closesness of her sister, she said, &quot;I guess it will be best when I can go back to being a guy. It probably shan&#39;t be so much of shock.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod and Tanya did say anything. Lying next to her sister, waiting to see if the other girl would say anything, still trying to get over how normal it seemed to be doing what she was doing,  Tanya eventually said, &quot;Why don&#39;t we go down to the mall and get dinner. And afterward, we can bum around and do some window shopping until we have to go meet coach Sara. Game&#39;s at six thirty and we should get there early to warm and practice before hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris, as she pushed the pillow away, thought about how their mom was working late. Nodding, she sat up. Saying, &quot;That sounds like a plan,&quot; and before she could stop herself, she said, &quot;There&#39;s this really cute bikini I have been thinking of getting, but I am worried it is too skimpy. Maybe you could give me your opinion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, sure,&quot; Tanya said and getting up, she grabbed her purse and lead her sister out of her room.<br />
<br />
Chris, going along with her, followed her down the hallway. Tempted to take a peek inside her room, wanting to know if it had changed to a girl&#39;s bedroom, she instead stopped and ducked into the bathroom. Grabbing the Amulet of Zulo off the sink, she stepped back, just as Tanya said, &quot;Oh, I almost forgot,&quot; and rushing back to her room, she returned and handed Chris a sports bra and pair of underwear, telling him, &quot;Here. These are yours. Mom accidentally put them in with my laundry,&quot; then stopped, as something didn&#39;t seem right.<br />
<br />
As she took the undergarments, and thanked her sister, Chris almost tossed them into her room. Instead, she folded the bra, rolled up the underwear and figured she&#39;d wear them during the game. Asking, &quot;Coach Sara will provided me with something to wear,&quot; she listened as Tanya told her the coach would and explained she&#39;d be given a jersey and shorts.<br />
<br />
Grabbing a two small Ziploc bag from the kitchen, Chris put the undergarments in one, the necklace in the other, located her purse, into which she placed the two baggies, then asked Tanya, &quot;Ready?&quot; to which her sister nodded.<br />
<br />
Both still adjusting, shocked and surprised to how much things had changed, Chris more so than Tanya, the sisters left the house. Deciding to take their bikes, they were only slightly taken aback to find that Chris now had a girl&#39;s bike. Figuring to just go with it, they got on their bicycles and after Chris had gotten used to sitting on a girl&#39;s bike seat, they headed for the mall.</p>
