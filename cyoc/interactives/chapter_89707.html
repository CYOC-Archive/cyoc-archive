<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris looked at the mannequin, it&#39;s tan plastic smile beckoning him, but his size was by far better, but he kept yearning for some more. As he was about to let trainer go at him, another knock on the door snapped him out. He waddled towards it, but trainer already had it open. There stood two brothers, one a big defensive lineman just about on his last year of college, and his younger brother who was just as tall but skinny as a rail.<br />
<br />
&quot;What can I do for you, my brotherssss&quot; said trainer, already thinking of wonderful ideas in his head. His eyes gleamed with sadistic evil as the older of the two spoke up with a nervous stammer. &quot;M m m my name is micheal, and this is my bra bra brother Gabriel!&quot; Micheal seemed relieved after speaking, so nervous at this evil being befor them. Gabriel just hide behind his brother and said weakly &quot;we heard you can train for nfl players to be?&quot; He almost coward back like he was gonna hide into a hole. Trainer smiled showing his gleaming white teeth behind his darkened face &quot;indeed I can, I will train you two as the best positions the nfl has to offer....&quot; He trailed off as the two almost floated in looking at the dummies in the corner, bumping each other as the rocked back and forth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes they will be your guides.......Chris please leave ussssss&quot; and dutifully as always he hoped back on to the elevator and waited. And trainer began the regiment, keeping the one as a hulking defensive player. Bulking him up, making his chest barreled, his shoulders wide enough he had trouble walking through doors, his arms and legs so stressed out with muscle he almost waddled in satisfaction. His arms looking like giant buffet turkeys were stuck on, every vein pronounced! Next was his brother Gabriel, he was to be an offensive lineman.<br />
<br />
Gabriel was fed a high calorie diet just as micheal, but was trained like a powerlifters, with a tiny amount of drills enough to keep him mobile but bulking. His continuous training had him able to out bench and out strengthen his brother micheal, but give him a bigger belly protruding. But both were satisfied, like faithful little zombies to there master. Finally once they were done there training, he had them both step on the scales.....micheal was 420 and Gabriel weighed 540 pounds!<br />
<br />
They both looked at trainer like naughty children, expecting to be punished. Trainer gave an evil smirk and said &quot;you&#39;ve both done very well, I&#39;m almost pleased....&quot; And both brothers high fives each other, Gabriel&#39;s belly giggling like jello in a earthquake. Trainer walked up the them both and whispered into there ears, the brothers hypnotized by his serpent like voice. &quot;You my defensive lineman, you will do drills till you are a new black football uniform and helmet with lineman grill.&quot; Like a puppet on a string he kept over to a patch of astro turf that appeared and began on the dummies. &quot;And you my offensive lineman, you will grow and change until your a new leather football.&quot; And with a dull satisfied look he began to eat and lay about, bulking himself up. <br />
<br />
Trainer watched as micheal did drills, each hit changing his body, each tackle sounding more like the rattling of gear. The top of his head began to take on a shine as his sides began to turn black. His giant shoulders began to rattle and puff out as they began to turn to padding, a jersey began to form on them, with it trailing down to his biceps as they diminished into long rubber sleeves for winter, his legs becoming padding at his muscles as they turned to black Lycra and his feet to black cleets. Finally his face began to first grow almost a black tatoo of a face grill, but then became more 3d as his insides began to diminish aways almost like a small whisp of wind with sound. At last he stood there frozen in position to tackle and just fell apart onto the floor in pieces. His helmet hit tumbled to his brother who began to change as well<br />
<br />
First his skin began to become more tan, taking on a leather texture and shine, as goosebumps appeared on him. As each set he did became more stressed, his midsection began inflating. As he grimaced in action his head began to push to a point, as his hair fell out. Finally he tried walking to his next machine and fell over, teetering back and forth as his shoes and feet melded together to form the other point. His workout sweats were pushed to the limit as he continued to swell, his arms and hands twitching in there brown leather skin, slowly dissaperaing into his new form. He said sleepily as he rocked back and forth on his rounded leather back &quot;have we made you happy trainer?&quot; As he fell asleep, a light hissing noise starting up as he finished changing. &quot;Yes my new nfl ball, you&#39;ve done well, as has your uniform brother...&quot; You could almost see the bars on the helmets grill form a tiny smile. Meanwhile laces began to form as the hissing grew louder, Gabriel&#39;s body shrinking down till it was regulation size and weight.<br />
<br />
Trainer picked up the uniform and placed it on the bodybuilder mannequin, it was a little loose since it was defensive lineman gear. A prominent number 00 was on the jersey in jagged white writing. He picked up his brother the ball and placed it in the mannequins arms as he position it in a running stance. &quot;Perfect for the beginning of the season&quot; he said with an diabolical tweak of a chuckle. The uniform and ball looked happy as could be, displayed and ready to be used when</p>
