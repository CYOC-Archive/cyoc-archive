“Eric hi. Thanks for coming over so soon.” Evan said. Eric nodded, still a bit out of breath, and entered the house. <br />
<br />
“Do you need me to do anything int articular sir?” Eric asked. <br />
<br />
“I appreciate the offer, but the only thing I need you to do is make sure Spencer stays out of trouble. I’lll be around until noon. And remember, keep things PG.” Evan said with a smile. Eric again nodded his head, and started walking upstairs, where he found his body was extremely tense.  <br />
<br />
“Why am I so nervous. It’s just Spencer. It’s just…” Eric thought. But he stopped thinking when he knocked on her door. <br />
<br />
“Just get in here.” Spencer laughed from the other side. <br />
<br />
Eric stuck his head through the door first, taking in the sight before him. Spencer was still wearing the oversized sweatshirt from earlier. She sat cross legged on the floor, her right arm also still in the sling. Eric noticed that upon seeing him, her tail began to rhythmically thump against the floor. <br />
<br />
“Hey.” Eric said, waving sheepishly.<br />
<br />
“Hey yourself. Gonna stand there all day? Your legs will get tired.” Spencer said smiling. Eric hastily ran into the room, and sat next to Spencer. <br />
<br />
“What’s in the bag?” Spencer asked. <br />
<br />
“Huh, oh nothing much.” Eric said, zipping the bag open so Spencer could look inside. She did, and found herself laughing even more. <br />
<br />
“Batman underwear?” she said, pointing to the boxers Eric had on top of his change of clothing. He blushed and said something about them being a Christmas present. <br />
<br />
“Don’t be so embarrassed, I’ve got plenty of Batman undies too.” Spencer said. <br />
<br />
Eric blushed harder, and tried not to let his imagination get the better of him. He was glad he had the backpack on his lap to provide some coverage. <br />
<br />
“PG, Eric. Keep things PG.” he thought to himself. <br />
<br />
“So, I hear you’ve been busy cooking.” Spencer said.<br />
<br />
“Just the small stuff. Mom’s a bit of a maniac during the holidays. A perfectionist is a better way to describe it.” Eric said. <br />
<br />
“You guys do the whole classic Thanksgiving dinner then.”<br />
<br />
“Ya, you don’t?”<br />
<br />
“Not really. Back in Virginia, it was usually just me and my parents. Mom was sometimes called in to work. And if by whatever miracle my mom did get work off, we just did Chinese take out, or put turkey meat on a pizza.” Spencer said indifferent to the whole situation. As far as she was concerned, that was Thanksgivings. <br />
<br />
“So what are you doing this year?” <br />
<br />
“Going to my aunt’s place in the morning. Then running back to your house.” Spencer smiled at Eric, and slid her good arm closer to his. The two were soon holding hands (paws). <br />
<br />
“It’s just going to be your family there? You said before your dad didn’t have anyone out here…”<br />
<br />
“Ya, just my mom’s parents, my aunt and uncle obviously, and maybe my uncle’s parents.”<br />
<br />
“What are your grandparents like?”<br />
<br />
“Eh, okay. It’s just Grandpa Mike on my dad’s side, and I hardly see him. Mostly because he likes to keep himself locked in his house. My mom’s parents are the opposite. They behave like twenty somethings. Going out, drinking, partying, dancing and the like.”<br />
<br />
“Wow. My grandparents just complain about the youth of today, and drink prune juice.” <br />
<br />
Both laugh at that. They continue to talk about their respective holiday plans. And somehow they end up on the topic of Spencer’s parents. Eric asks Spencer if she and her dad have been getting along better since her “accident”. It would appear that way, but you never know. <br />
<br />
“Ya, it’s so weird. It’s like Mom and Dad swapped brains. All of a sudden she’s the one who insists I be monitored and put under a microscope. Meanwhile Dad has all but let the leash go.” <br />
<br />
“A change for the better?” Eric asked. <br />
<br />
“Not sure yet. I kinda feel like I fell through the looking glass. My parents are acting like each other, I just spent the past two days inside playing with my own fur balls, and thinking about yo…” Spencer stopped herself when she realized what she was about to say. <br />
<br />
Eric felt like the rug had been torn out from under him. <br />
<br />
“She was going to say ‘you’. She’s been thinking about ME.” he thought elated. <br />
<br />
He tried not to show it, but the wild grin on his face gave him away. And he started to hold the backpack tighter against his chest. Spencer took pity on him and pretended to be very preoccupied looking at the carpet. <br />
<br />
The awkward silence only lasted for a few minutes. The two soon locked eyes, and kissed. Well, Eric did most of the kissing. Spencer stuck her tongue out a number of times and sort of half french-kissed him. Either way, the two shared a nice moment. <br />
<br />
When Eric pulled away he was very aware of the new awkward situation they’d created. Both teenagers were obviously aroused by the other. Spencer felt er cheeks getting hot, and subconsciously curled her tail around her legs. Eric just smiled, and leaned against Spencer. Even if she was wearing the sweatshirt, there was that same comforting factor he felt when he petted her fur. <br />
<br />
For the longest time they sat there, Eric leaning again Spencer. After a while he head this odd buzzing, and realized Spencer was sort of purring. As much as a werewolf cross can put without it sounding like growling. <br />
<br />
Eric slides his hand up to pet her neck. Spencer’s purring noises get louder, and Eric can actually feel her throat vibrating. He shivers a little (good shivers), and kisses her again. <br />
<br />
“Hey Spencer I’m ordering take out. What do you and Eric want?” Evan Lawson shouted. <br />
<br />
The two jumped apart, once more bushing fiercely. <br />
<br />
“Uh, we’ll come down in a second.” Spencer called back. They gave each other a quick and uncomfortable smile before hurrying down the stairs. Spencer hoped her father wouldn’t say anything, and to her relief he didn’t. Though on the inside he was rolling with laughter at Spencer’s apparent embarrassment.</p>
