<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not being able to enjoy the changes she had made to either Chris or Amanda frustrated Jen. Her new found perversion made her lust for their changed bodies. Just thinking about their changes made her hot and horny, yet at the same time she was relieved. The curse had made her feel these strange lusts and she knew that she should have been disgusted by the transformations. She wasn't though, and try as she might not to think about them, she was unable to resist the curse's compulsion.<br />
<br />
Keeping her eyes on the floor to keep her from looking at any of her classmates and getting ideas, Jen made her way down the hall to her next class, which hopefully would distract her. Unlike the droning Mr. Hanks, Ms. Travers managed to make her biology class interesting, even though Jen hated anything science related with a passion ever since she had needed to dissect a fetal pig in freshman year. Just the memory of the smell, chemicals and rotten meat, was enough to make get queasy. Yes, science class was likely to be survivable, since if she was feeling sick she wouldn't start thinking perverted thoughts. This week they were supposed to be learning about amphibians, which would, depending on how things went, end with them dissecting frogs on Friday. Needless to say, Jen had decided that she was going to call in sick that day.<br />
<br />
Feeling confident that she could at least make it through this one class, Jen took her seat in Ms. Travers class just as the bell rang. As long as she kept thinking of disgusting, slimy frogs, wiggling tadpoles, and salamanders, which she had come to think of as one of the most horrible little creatures ever, she was going to be fine. All of those things were far too disgusting for her to think of transformations based on, and trying not to get sick would keep her from focusing on other things.<br />
<br />
While Ms. Travers set up the slide show she had set up for the class, Jen took out her textbook so she could read along and highlight important information, figuring that everything else she gave herself to think about would keep her mind from wandering.<br />
<br />
Looking for the readings for the day's lessons, she accidentally went a couple dozen pages too far and opened up to a picture of a bright green snake. Jen wasn't terribly fond of snakes, but she had a feeling that the color and pattern of its scales would stick with her, even as she flipped back to the correct pages.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright class,&quot; Ms. Travers began, &quot;Today we'll be focusing on the anatomy of the basic amphibian groups, salamanders, frogs and toads, with special focus on the morphological differences between toads and frogs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before the professor had even finished this, a hand shot up in the front row, causing Jen to roll her eyes. Becka, the shy little girl who sat in the front of the class always had something to say, typically something that took the class on a long, highly technical tangent.<br />
<br />
The professor loved it, but it made the class drag on forever for all the other students.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Becka?&quot; Ms. Travers said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what about caecilians?&quot; Becka stammered, &quot;Th-they're amphibians too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right, but they're a highly derived group. Taking time to discuss them would mean having less time to talk about the other groups that are more relevant to the purpose of the syllabus as a whole,&quot; Ms. Travers paused, thinking, &quot;But if you want to tell us a little about them you can as long as you keep it under five minutes. It might help the class better appreciate the diversity of forms amphibians can take based on their lifestyles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Caecilians are a c-cryptic group, li-living underground for m-most of their lives,&quot; Becka began, &quot;Th-they are legless and su-superficially resemble worms or s-snakes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mention of snakes brought Jen back to the image of the bright green snake in the textbook and it got her thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Jen shook her head, trying to think about anything other than the snake, or snakes in general, with their exotic colors and lithe forms. The problem was, she felt bad for Becka. The girl was a hopeless nerd and probably knew more than any of the teachers, but she was too shy for her own good. If not for her stammering and impenetrable vocabulary what she had to say would probably be worth listening to. As it was, it was impossible for Jen to take notes of what she was saying, or even pay much attention to it.<br />
<br />
Unable to make sense of what Becka was saying, Jen instead began to focus on Becka herself. For a nerd she was pretty cute, with short blond hair and perky little b-cup breasts, even if she didn't dress to flatter her body. Jen could imagine giving her a makeover, getting her some new outfits, and maybe getting her to use some makeup for once, not too much since she was cute enough on her own, but maybe just a little blush so she wouldn't look so pale when she spoke.<br />
<br />
The image of the snake, specifically its color, a green too bright to be natural, sprang unbidden to Jen's mind.<br />
<br />
Jen tired to push it away and stay focused on Becka, but it was just too sexy a thing to let go. Unable to stop herself, Jen's perverted imagination began to combine the two trains of thoughts.<br />
<br />
Becka's pale skin began to take on a bit of color and not a natural blush either. Pale and barely visible at first, but slowly deepening to the same shade as the snake in the textbook, Becka's skin became bright green. Unaware, Becka continued talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-this helps Caecilians detect th-their prey underground,&quot; Becka licked her lips nervously, her tongue becoming longer and splitting at the tip, &quot;Th-though little is k-known about wh-what they eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to look away, or even stop, Jen watched Becka flick her forked tongue out nervously, tasting the air before she continued. At this point Jen wasn't even trying to listen to what she was saying.<br />
<br />
Becka's hair sank back into her scalp as scales grew in. A moment later the scales of her head and neck began to rise and spread into something that resembles a cobra's hood, which flared slightly wider when someone in the back of the class coughed.<br />
<br />
Jen didn't like the way it looked when the hood pulled at Becka's shirt when it opened fully, and with that thought Becka's shirt vanished. Biting her lip to keep from moaning, Jen stared lustfully at Becka's perky breasts with their erect nipples a darker shade of green. She imagined that they would feel as hard and smooth as chips of jade if she were to touch them, running her hands over then, then down the smooth scales of her belly, lower and lover until she was fingering the slit in Becka's scales that was her pussy. Jen wanted to see that scaly little pussy so bad, to see the scales glistening with moisture and her little clit peaking out from beneath those hard scales.<br />
<br />
Becka's pants vanished, granting Jen her wish, though it only made Jen want more. She wanted to finger Becka's tight pussy, lick her hard nipples and feel a muscular tail wrapping around her.<br />
<br />
Hoping that no one was looking, Jen put her hands between her legs to rub at herself as Becka began to grow a tail which stretched longer and longer until it was at least fifteen feet long. Once it stopped growing longer, it began to thicken, absorbing Becka's legs until she was sitting on her coiled tail in front of the class. <br />
<br />
The new Becka looked amazing to Jen, but she still wanted more. She was exotic, but Jen knew she could push it further. Two sets of bumps began to swell on Becka's chest scales, expanding into breasts the same size as her original pair, topped with erect dark green nipples. Excited by this multiplicity, Jen decided to give Becka more of something else as well. There was a shifting around Becka's sides and shoulders as two rapidly growing nubs formed beneath her arms. Muscle and bone grew and strengthened until the nubs grew into a pair of fully functional arms.<br />
<br />
To draw more attention to Becka's endowments, Jen decided that some piercings would be nice and as she imagined them, they came into being. A ring of gold appeared in each of Becka's nipples, connected to each other by golden chains, from which hung little bells of the same metal, which jingled merrily whenever Becka moved. The scaly hood of Becka's clit was also pierced by a golden ring with a bell hanging from it.<br />
<br />
Before Jen could imagine anything else for the girl, Becka finished and slithered back to her seat, easing into her chair and wrapping her tail around the legs of her desk to keep it out of the way. Once seated Becka put all of her arms to good use, flipping through her textbook with one set and using the other to hold her notebook and take notes, the bells and chains jangling as she wrote.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Becka,&quot; Ms. Travers beamed at the snake girl then addressed the rest of the class, &quot;Caecilians won't be on the test next week, but I might ask you an extra credit question about them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Several students groaned, the noise masking Jen's moan of pleasure as she slid her hand under her skirt to rub at her clit through the silky fabric of her panties. She could feel the heat through the fabric, which was practically sopping wet with pussy juice. She needed relief badly, but when she looked at the clock she saw that it was less than fifteen minutes into the class.</p>
