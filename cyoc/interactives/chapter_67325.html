<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle’s heart pounded in his chest and his arm and leg muscles burned as he jogged down the concrete path through the forest preserve. Waking up early for a jog was exhausting, but it was good to finally be getting back in shape. He had spent the better part of his twenties getting accustomed to the life of a banking executive, succumbing to stress, and neglecting his body. At twenty-nine he was finally accustomed to his professional life and he was determined to carve out the time for dating and exercise again. Kyle always felt like he was a pretty average looking guy who cleaned up nicely. Strong jaw, dark blond hair, blue eyes, winning smile. As long as he put the effort into keeping off the extra pounds, grooming his beard, and getting his hair cut every couple of months he knew he’d be attracting the ladies again in no time. <br />
<br />
The early morning breeze was cool and refreshing against his sweat covered gray T-shirt. His black nylon jogging pants swished as he raced onwards. His heart pounded even harder and finally he felt as if his chest was going to explode. He slowed down to a trot as he rounded a bend of trees and collapsed his hands onto his knees as he panted. He definitely was going to have to get used to doing this. He let out a long exhale, wiped the sweat off his forehead, stood back up and stretched. Maybe he would walk the rest of the way home. Kyle finally caught his breath and started off down the trail again when his foot hit a stump in the road and he stumbled forwards barely catching himself on the concrete with his palms.<br />
 <br />
“Hey! What’s the big idea!” Came the voice of an angry Irishman. “Why don’t you watch where you’re goin’ boyo?!”<br />
 <br />
Kyle stood up and dusted himself off. “Sorry, man. I didn’t even see…” His jaw dropped, “…you?” In the middle of the jogging path was a tiny little man, about two feet tall wearing bright green pants and shirt with a dark green overcoat. He had black leather elf boots with big gold buckles and a bright gold belt buckle. His face was very flushed with a red goatee and pointy little ears. He was sporting a nasty scowl as he fidgeted with a little green hat.<br />
 <br />
“Saints preserve us! Keep your eyes in your head lad!” The little man snapped.<br />
 <br />
“I’m sorry, I just… I never…” Kyle rubbed his eyes. He had to be dreaming.<br />
 <br />
“What you’ve never seen a Leprechaun before?” The little man put his hat back on and did a little jig with a sarcastic smirk on his face. “Bah! Doesn’t give you the right to be rude!”<br />
 <br />
“I’m sorry… I didn’t see you there… um. Do you need help? Are you hurt?”<br />
 <br />
“Do I look like I need help!” The Leprechaun snapped. “I’ve got more magic in me little finger than the whole a humanity put together!”<br />
 <br />
“Sorry.” After an awkward pause, Kyle finally decided that this had to be a very small person playing some kind of prank. Still he’d never even seen a little person this small before. The only thing he could think to do was play along. “So do I get a wish or something? For finding you?”<br />
 <br />
The Leprechaun laughed long and hard, holding his little stomach and collapsing back on his behind. “That’s rich! You come lugging along through the forest smelling like a sweaty gym sock. You kick me in the ribs, then you think you’re getting a reward!”<br />
 <br />
“Well then I guess you’re not really a leprechaun,” Kyle laughed. “Because if you were really magical you could grant a wish.”<br />
 <br />
The Leprechaun stood back up and rubbed his little hands together, a mischievous glint in his dark eyes. “You want a little magic? Sounds good. How about we play a game.” The Leprechaun snapped his fingers and suddenly Kyle’s whole body felt very cold. He lifted his feet up and felt the hard pavement of the jogging path on his bare feet. He quickly grabbed his arms and chest and glanced down at his body. All of his clothes were gone. He was a sweaty hairy guy standing butt naked in the middle of the jogging path.<br />
 <br />
“Hey! What the hell?!”<br />
 <br />
“I’m sorry, was that not your wish? You looked a bit overheated from all that exercise! I thought you might like to cool down.”<br />
 <br />
Kyle’s face turned beet red as he reached down to cover his balls and cock. “Hey, you can’t do this man. How am I supposed to get home? What if somebody comes along and sees me like this?”<br />
 <br />
The Leprechaun eyed Kyle greedily as he paced around him in a circle grinning a toothy grin. “So what if somebody sees you like this? It’s the way God made you boyo!”<br />
 <br />
Kyle reached down and grabbed for the Leprechaun. He was sure he had him in his grasp but at the last possible second the little man poofed into a plume of green smoke and reappeared nearby. Kyle scrambled to catch him again, but he continued to miss every time, crawling and lunging on the ground. Finally the Leprechaun appeared behind him and slapped him hard on the ass. Kyle stood up and groaned. He couldn’t remember the last time he felt so humiliated. “You have to give me my clothes back! Come on!”<br />
 <br />
“I don’t have to do anything.” The Leprechaun skipped down the path and Kyle followed him in desperation. <br />
<br />
“Please!”<br />
 <br />
“Now here’s a sight. The big manly man, begging the wee little Leprechaun.”<br />
 <br />
Kyle groaned again. He was getting cold. “I’m sorry I kicked you. It was an accident. Can you stop this, please?”<br />
 <br />
“Oh but the game’s just gettin’ started! You’re gunna start makin’ things up to me, boyo. What I need is a good house boy. Scrub the floors, make me my stew, rub me little feet, fetch me pipe… that sort of thing.”<br />
 <br />
“And if I don’t do those things, you’re going to make me walk home naked?” Kyle sighed and looked down at his hairy chest and stomach, and his dangling manhood. The thought of being this creepy little gnome’s manservant repulsed him. “I can’t do that. I’m sorry.”<br />
 <br />
“Well of course you can’t! Not like that. You ever been to a Leprechaun’s house before? You’d never even fit through the door.”<br />
 <br />
Kyle felt a deep pit form in his stomach. He wasn’t sure where this was going but he didn’t think he was going to like it.<br />
 <br />
“I’ll have to cut you down to size to make a good house boy out of you.”<br />
 <br />
“Are you going to… turn me into a leprechaun???”<br />
 <br />
“Oh I’ll bet you’d like that. Then you’d have all sorts of magic of your own to use to escape. No, no, no. I’m going to turn you back into a wee little boy. An obedient little house boy who will obey my every command.”<br />
 <br />
“This is crazy. I’m getting out of here.” Kyle turned to walk back down the path. If he could just find some clothes and come up with a reasonable enough explanation, he might be able to get a key from his building manager and put this whole thing behind him.<br />
 <br />
“Like you’re ever gunna escape from me,” the Leprechaun giggled. “I said we’d play a game. You’ll get a sporting chance.”<br />
 <br />
Kyle stopped in his tracks and turned back around. “What kind of sporting chance?”<br />
 <br />
“You’re a lonely man, aren’t you Kyle?” The Leprechaun taunted.<br />
 <br />
“I’m not lonely… I just… how do you even know my name?”<br />
 <br />
“Oh you’re a lonely thing. You haven’t been with a woman for how long? Five years? Six?”<br />
 <br />
“What does this have to do with anything?” Kyle said coldly. Any second now someone might stumble upon him standing here in the buff in the middle of the jogging path and he was losing patience.<br />
 <br />
“The point is when you relieve that big old ding dong of yours, you do it all by your lonesome. Nobody ever sees the deed. And you do it every night don’t you? Play with your frank and beans there until you explode with happiness.”<br />
 <br />
“What is the point of all--”<br />
 <br />
“The point is, from now on, any time I catch you at the peak of your personal playtime you will transform back into a little boy and become mine for twenty-four hours.”<br />
 <br />
“You’re saying if you see me… ejaculate… I become your little… slave boy?”<br />
 <br />
“For a full day!”<br />
 <br />
Kyle laughed. “Okay, fine. Can I have my clothes back now?”<br />
 <br />
“Those rules are acceptable to you?”<br />
 <br />
“Sure, I’m never going to get aroused with a weird little guy around anyway.”<br />
 <br />
“Oh, is that a fact?” The Leprechaun snapped his pudgy fingers and Kyle heard a cartoonish boing. Almost instantly Kyle felt his penis engorge with blood and spring up ninety degrees. He was suddenly incredibly horny, sporting a massive hard on.<br />
 <br />
“Oh man…” Kyle stared helplessly down at his throbbing cock, his right hand was sweaty. His fingers wiggling back and forth. He wanted so badly to grab his dick.<br />
 <br />
“What’s the matter there Kyle?” The Leprechaun laughed. “Looks like you have something to take care of.”<br />
 <br />
“I don’t want to do this…” Kyle moaned as he grabbed his right wrist with his left hand, and struggled to control himself.<br />
 <br />
“Why wouldn’t you?”<br />
 <br />
“This is cheating. You’re forcing me to do this…”<br />
 <br />
“I said we’d play a game, I didn’t say it would be fair!” The Leprechaun cackled.<br />
 <br />
Kyle’s whole body felt warm and his head was dizzy with desire.<br />
 <br />
“Go ahead and play with yourself boyo. You can’t stop it.”<br />
 <br />
Kyle sighed longingly as he collapsed backwards on his bare bottom and leaned back onto the concrete jogging path. He stared up at the sky and fought the urge to grab his dick. It throbbed so intensely it was becoming painful.<br />
 <br />
“Ha Ha! Big bad manly Kyle’s going to put on a show for the little Leprechaun. He can’t stop himself.”<br />
 <br />
Kyle couldn’t fight it anymore. His hand reached down and his whole body relaxed as he grabbed his rock hard dick in his hand. The slightest touch sent waves of pleasure across the shaft of his privates and he let out a long moan of ecstasy as he continued to stroke himself. His left hand reached down and cupped his sweaty hairy balls as he worked himself over.<br />
 <br />
“That’s right! Soon you’ll be trading that big meaty sausage for an itty bitty cocktail weenie! That beefy hairy chest for a scrawny kid’s rib cage. You’ll be as smooth as a little bitty baby.”<br />
 <br />
The Leprechaun’s words somehow made Kyle feel even better. He couldn’t remember the last time he felt so incredibly aroused. He pumped his dick more furiously.<br />
 <br />
“Good boy,” the Leprechaun giggled. “Faster and faster. Once you squirt your load, you’ll be squirting out all your manhood. Shooting the years right out of your body, mind, and soul. You’ll turn right back. A helpless little kid.”<br />
 <br />
Kyle moaned even louder. He was getting close, and somehow the thought of the transformation was exhilarating.<br />
 <br />
“Just a wee little laddie in his birthday suit. Forced to obey Mr. Leprechaun.”<br />
 <br />
Kyle screamed in ecstasy as he felt his fluids shooting forth. His semen shot up several feet in the air and splattered on his chest, then suddenly he felt a very funny sensation. His skin became tighter. His muscles contracted. His bones started collapsing in on themselves. It wasn’t painful at all. Just very strange. He stared in fascination down at his body as all in a matter of a few seconds it shifted back through his twenties into a lean college boy. The hair on his chest arms and legs thinned out and sunk right back into his skin as he de-aged through high school and became a young adolescent. As he moaned in pleasure he heard his deep masculine voice kick up several octaves into a boyish cry. His arms and legs quickly became smooth and his hands and feet child-like. His cock shrank down into a little boyish nub as all traces of his pubic hair disappeared. Once it was all over he sat up and rubbed his eyes. It was the most incredibly euphoric experience of his entire life. He reached his young hands up to his face and felt his smooth cheeks. His beard was totally gone.<br />
 <br />
The Leprechaun trotted up to him, beaming with pride and made a small hand mirror appear with a flick of his wrist. He held it up to Kyle’s face, and the reflection of a baby faced, bright blond haired eight-year-old stared back at him. “I think you liked that, didn’t you?” The Leprechaun teased.<br />
 <br />
“I… I don’t know…” Kyle cringed at the little boy’s voice that came out of his mouth.<br />
 <br />
The Leprechaun laughed as he produced a round metal collar from inside his coat, attached to a silvery chain, and fixed it around Kyle’s neck. “Get up, boyo!” Kyle stood upon command. “It’s time to come home with Mr. Leprechaun. I’ve got floors that need scrubbin‘!” The Leprechaun slapped little Kyle on his boy’s behind then trotted off into the forest, pulling the chain tight and dragging young Kyle behind him like a good little slave boy.</p>
