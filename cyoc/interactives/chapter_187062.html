<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carl grinned at the given information. So, Jeff turned his masturbation sock into his twin, but with a time limit? “Well, let´s take advantage of this little program then.” Carl thought, already planning what he could do.<br />
A little later Carl had decided what he would do, and while he would need to wait for Jeff and the twin to return home, he could at least prepare something small and enjoy the time afterwards. A few small tweaks with the chronivac would keep Jeff from accessing his computer or harm Carl in any way, even keep him from leaving the room again. Grinning, Carl started to strip naked, putting each part of his clothes on Jeff´s desk next to the computer.<br />
When Jeff and his twin returned, Carl grinned at them evilly. But what shocked Jeff wasn´t Carl being in his room, but that he was sitting on his desk chair naked. His twin in turn grinned in surprise. “Oh, hello Carl. Are you waiting for us? Need me to suck you, now that I´m able to do so?”<br />
Jeff whipped around to look at his twin in shock. Does that mean Carl used his sock to masturbate, too? Carl just shook his head as he answered: “No, that won´t be necessary, sock. I wanted to use you when I arrived, but now I have another willing drinker of my cum. Right, Jeff?” He then again grinned evilly at Jeff.<br />
Jeff looked with a mix between disgust and anger at Carl. “You asshole. It´s disgusting that you used my sock. And I never noticed it. Yuck. Why would I suck you, fucking asshole? Let alone willingly, gross.”<br />
Carl laughed at his outburst. “Oh, I know you wouldn´t notice, I only used it when I was sure you wouldn´t use it yourself for at least an hour, after all. If your younger twin-brothers did notice, I wouldn´t know. After all, they used you too, right sock?”<br />
While Jeff blanched in horror, the sock-twin nodded. “Yeah, I was busy with you four using me. But the twins used me some times a bit after you, Carl. But as far as I remember, they thought I was damp from Jeff using me.”<br />
Jeff was in a turmoil of emotions. Disgusted not one, but three other people had used HIS masturbation sock as well, let alone it being his younger twin-brothers and his best friend. Angry at the three of them for not asking, even if he clearly would have said no to them, but also at himself for never noticing they used it. Confused why the twin said it in such a happy tone. He wasn´t gay, and neither should his twin be. Also still not knowing what Carl meant. Why would he willingly suck him? There was no way he would do that, other than … “Oh no” Jeff thought slightly panicked, “will Carl use the chronivac to make me suck him “willingly” as some kind of slave?”<br />
That at least Carl partly answered after he had stopped laughing at the twin’s answer, “Well, if you were happy with your work before, your old “life”, I will gladly return you to said happy life, sock. But I won´t need you today, as I plan for Jeff to suck me off after I change him. But I´m sure you will still be used later sock. Now how about we start everything by turning you back into yourself, sock?”<br />
The twin grimaced at the thought of becoming a dumb, lifeless sock again, but made no move to stop Carl from accessing Jeff´s computer. Jeff was horrified for thinking of sucking Carl´s cock alone, but also shocked that Carl would just change him like he wanted. He had to stop Carl, but his body was frozen in his shock, not even his mouth worked, just hanging wide open.<br />
Just before Carl saved the sock-twin´s changes, said twin spoke up: “Wait Carl. While I liked my uses as a sock, being mindless as clothing normally is, I want to remain human now. I guess I can be of more use than as I´m as a sock. And if you change Jeff anyway, why not let me be a replacement? Please let me remain human, Carl.”<br />
Jeff´s head turned to look at his twin, the shock and horror still present. He hadn´t even talked to save him, the original Jeff, but his own, newly created life. And to ask to replace him if Carl changed him anyway. “What a traitor” went through Jeff´s head.<br />
Carl edited something in the sock´s profile before saving it. He then turned around to watch the changes, answering the twin´s plea: “While that sounds interesting, I don´t need you as a human any longer, sock. And when I need a replacement for Jeff here I already have something planned. But I gave you some extras for your future uses. I hope you will like them, as I won´t turn you human again to ask.”<br />
As Jeff and Carl watched, one fearing for a similar fate or worse, the other in fascination, the twin turned slowly back into his sock body. There had been no time for more pleading, as his voice was the first thing lost to him.<br />
Slowly, the twin´s skin turned paler and paler, while his light brown hair was also bleaching out. His pleading look lost its strength when his eyes turned completely white as well, while his mouth dropped wide open, and he was unable to close it again. Even the inside of his mouth by now was completely white, teeth and tongue vanished from sight. His fingers had merged together already, leaving him with useless mitten-like blobs, and even without seeing them, it was clear his toes had done so as well.<br />
A shudder went through his whole body as he slowly begun to shrink into the clothes he was still wearing. He didn´t collapse, so the reduction in size was clearly visible. His shirt soon slipped past his shoulders and down his body, his underwear and shorts already in a pile around his feet. As soon as the shirt left his upper body bare and white-skinned, his arms connected to his sides, merging into them seamlessly. At the same time from his waist down his legs also merged with each other, his cock already vanished by the time the shorts had dropped.<br />
A last shudder went through the clothes pile as the transformation finished, turning the white-skinned shrunken twin from skin to the cloth the sock had been before. That let it finally collapse, as the last bit of its insides had vanished as well. Now, on top of the clothes pile, right in the shirts collar, laid the old masturbation-sock again. On the cloth appeared dirty specs and the whole sock got more and more stiff and crusty, completely returning to the state it had been before Jeff turned it into his twin. If Carl and Jeff hadn´t known, it could have never been anything other than that sock.<br />
Only Carl knew of the edits he had made to it. The sock itself noted it was still “alive”, could still think and feel, but was unable to move or speak. It could taste the cum baked into its fabric and smell the dirt it had collected over time. But what it didn´t realized was the edits Carl made beside that. Because the sock-twin had meant it would be of more use if it remained human, and even asked if Carl wanted to be sucked, Carl added just that. If anything went inside the sock, it would move like it was sucking on its inside, while also vibrating as a whole, raising the pleasure for its user. And it was now fully absorbent, so even when damp from use, it would never leave a mess behind when used.</p>
