<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Now my thrall… my love…”  The doppelg&auml;nger soothed and Brian showed some surprise.<br />
<br />
“What?  Are you surprised that I can love or that I now love you?”  the doppelganger asked.<br />
<br />
“Master, I thought I was merely you’re thrall.  I did not know I was worthy of your love?”  Brian said.<br />
<br />
The doppelg&auml;nger caressed Brian’s cheek and bent so that their grey featureless faces were almost touching and whispered, “You are my thrall, but not merely anything and that doesn’t mean that I don’t also love you.  You will obey me because I am your master and because I love you and I know that you love me too.  We are bound as master and slave.  You will seek to please me every waking moment.  Someday, you will be my equal and at that time, we will love as equals, but for now you are my willing slave and lover.”<br />
<br />
The doppelg&auml;nger pressed his mouth against Brian’s and forced a changing tongue down Brian’s throat.  Brian found that he was not choking on the now cock shaped tongue of his master.  Brian sucked on it as it grew to be as large as the member hanging between the doppelg&auml;nger’s legs.  Brian found that he could breathe comfortably while sucking his master’s cock/tongue.  Brian’s air passages had changed and he could now suck cock and breathe at the same time.  Further, his throat easily changed shape to accommodate the increasing size of his master’s tongue.<br />
<br />
His master withdrew his cock/tongue and Brian watched as it slithered back into his mouth, changing to the regular shape a tongue should be.<br />
<br />
“You are a shape shifter now; see how wonderful a body like ours is?  I was once human like you.  I was a large powerfully built man.  I was well endowed and proud of my muscular masculine body.  No woman refused me and some men dreamed of having me.  Let me show you what I once was.”<br />
<br />
With that the doppelg&auml;nger shifted into an almost seven foot hairy, red bearded mountain of muscle covered in battle scars.  His eyes had become ice blue and as the burly man stroked his beard and felt his hairy chest Brian noticed the pleasure had an effect on his cock.  Brian saw that his master’s cock was completely rigid and as long as it had been when he was in his natural state and was drooling pre come.<br />
<br />
“I had almost forgotten what my body used to feel like.  This form is so pleasing to me and you will learn it that I might make love to this shape.”<br />
<br />
The doppelg&auml;nger ceased fondling himself and focused his gaze on his thrall.<br />
<br />
“I was a warrior, centuries ago.  Look at me, my thrall, am I not magnificent?  Would I not be worthy of any woman?” the doppelg&auml;nger laughed, but it was mirthless.<br />
<br />
“I fell in love with a beautiful woman; the daughter of a prince and that was what changed all.  I had come to the service of the prince as a palace guard and occasionally saw the curtained sedan chair his daughter traveled in as it was brought through the palace.  I’d seen it many times and wondered who traveled in it, never knowing the prince’s daughter was the one who was in that curtained box.”<br />
<br />
The doppelg&auml;nger paused and stroked absently at his beard as he recalled, pacing a little as he did so.  Finally he stopped and fixed his gaze into Brian’s eyes again.<br />
<br />
“It was about three years since I’d come to the palace that I finally saw her.  She parted the curtains and I saw the most beautiful woman in all of creation.  In that moment, I was hopelessly in love.  It was a brief look, because the prince had orders that the curtains always be kept drawn and no one was to look, but my curiosity won over orders and the threat of expulsion from the principality.  I was the only one on duty that evening and the porters did not notice what had happened.  I also saw in that brief instant that he prince kept her in silver shackles.  She had shown them as she drew the curtain shut again.  Her look was sorrowful and pleading.  The Prince kept his daughter in the top chambers of a tower and allowed no one but himself to see her.  The top chambers had windows, but they’d been walled up with stone and mortar.”<br />
<br />
“I, of course, was love-struck and outraged that a man should treat his daughter so.  So I began to plot to save her.  I would rescue her from the bondage of her cruel father and perhaps, in her gratitude, such a beautiful flower as she would learn to love a rude brute beast like me.”<br />
<br />
“To shorten a long tale, I will skip the rescue.  I seized opportunity late one night while the prince was away and got into her chambers.  I released her from her silvery bonds.  She was full of gratitude as I had hoped and vowed her love to me eternally.  She lay me down in her silken bed and we made love.  As I slept, satisfied after sex, she tied me as I have tied you.  She began lovemaking again and I was excited by the powerlessness I felt at being tied.  Never before had anyone tied me and subjugated me.  She took my full load and like you I found that I kept needing to come.  She extracted so much of my seed I thought she had taken my balls out through my cock when I finally could shoot no more.  It was just as I have done to you and I did not know that I was being bred.  After she removed my cock from her, she revealed her true form.  The princess was a doppelg&auml;nger as I am and you have become.  I watched in horror as the opening I had just fucked sprouted a horse sized cock and with that huge member, he raped me for the first and last time.”<br />
<br />
The doppelg&auml;nger, smiled and continued his tale.<br />
<br />
“You see, ever after, his fucking was the most pleasurable and loving sex I could have, not rape at all.  I had been taken in by doppelg&auml;nger and, as I have done to you, he made me his thrall.”<br />
<br />
“The prince had imprisoned him with the magical silver shackles and used him against his enemies as an assassin and spy.  After my transformation I resumed my former shape and remained as a palace guard.  Changed as I was, I found it much easier to move about the palace.  I was under my master’s control, and as you love me, I loved my master.  My master imparted wisdom and experience directly from his mind into my own and together we plotted against the prince. I did his bidding willingly and brought him a large muscular male bodyguard of the prince.  I helped to tie him down and watched as my master brought him into thralldom as he had done to me.”<br />
<br />
“One evening, a year or so after rescuing my master, and having worked my way into the prince’s confidence and trust, I accompanied the prince to his private chambers.  The prince had just elevated me to his personal body guard.  By now my master had made another thrall to take his place in the tower and roamed about the palace as the man he had made his Thrall.  The prince suspected nothing.  He was safe in his private chambers with his trusted, well trained warrior-guards.  He was quite surprised when I removed the medallion that protected him from doppelg&auml;ngers.  It burned my hand badly, but it healed and was a small sacrifice for my master.  I, and the other bodyguard my master had enthralled, held the prince down as my master merged his mind with the prince to learn all his secrets. We then had the pleasure of watching my master slowly dissect the prince for the cruel imprisonment of my master.  We secretly buried the body and my master took the prince’s place.”<br />
<br />
Brian’s new master shifted back into his grey, smooth, less muscular, shorter form.  <br />
<br />
“I am you master, now.  I have bred tonight by making you.  We doppelg&auml;ngers reproduce by changing humans, dwarfs, elves, orcs and other bipedal intelligent beings into us.  You cannot breed yet, that will take a century or so, but once you are my equal and have matured,you will be capable of breeding and making your own thralls.  For now you are my thrall and you will be complete once our minds touch and you service me for the first time.”<br />
<br />
Again Brian’s master moved his head close to Brian’s head.  His master moved over his prone body, laying on him, covering him with is muscular form.  Again they kissed, but this time their faces began to merge.  Soon their heads had merged into one faceless mass.  An air hole opened up in his master’s throat and in a moment, Brian’s throat did the same.  Their heads merged further, the forehead bone separating their brains dissolved and their brains touched and merged.  All of Brian’s memories, skills and experiences flooded into his master’s mind and all of his master’s memories, skills and experiences flooded into Brian’s.  The two became one, sharing everything; then after an hour or so joined they separated.  Brian knew his master’s true name; the name he’d been given all those centuries ago as a human, but Brian was a thrall doppelg&auml;nger.  He knew his master was called Kral, but he dared not call him anything but master.<br />
<br />
“And now, you will service me, my thrall and in so doing gain you full size and powers.”  Kral said.<br />
<br />
Brian lay still as his master released him from his bonds.  Wordlessly, for he knew exactly what his master wanted, he got up from his place of restraint.  Kneeling worshipfully before his master began servicing him.  Brian sucked his master’s cock and his master leaned on his kneeling form with his legs spread wide.  He pumped his cock into his thrall’s face, moaning with pleasure.  Brian’s throat pleased his master because Brian had learned in the sharing of their minds how to manipulate his throat to best pleasure his master.  Brian’s throat milked his master’s huge cock, his tongue snaked out, growing longer as needed and splitting into a fork to massaged his master’s hairless scrotum.  Kral’s huge balls were caressed by each fork of Brian’s changed tongue.<br />
<br />
“Yesssss…” Kral growled, “your form will grow strong and with my seed you will gain our ability to become anyone, my love… my precious thrall.”  Kral stared lovingly into his thrall’s worshipful tearing eyes.<br />
<br />
Brian lived for his master; giving him this pleasure gave him his own intense pleasure.  The touching of their minds linked them slightly and both master and thrall mildly experienced each other’s pleasure.  Brian’s cock felt as though it were being sucked ever so lightly and Kral felt a phantom cock in his own throat.  It was not as full physical contact would be, but heightened the experience for both slave and master.<br />
<br />
Kral stroked Brian’s hairless head and massaged his grey shoulders more vigorously as he came closer to orgasm. Then it happened, Kral passed the point of no return and soared into full orgasm.  He began shooting his sperm into Brian’s waiting throat, pumping into his thralls face as hard as he could.  Kral’s orgasm lasted for five minutes as he filled the stomach of the changing form crouched before him.  Brian grew larger as his body assimilated his master’s seed.  His muscle increased all over his body as he shifted into his full doppelg&auml;nger form.  Brian grew taller and eventually looked exactly like his master in every respect.<br />
<br />
With a last volley of seed shot into his thrall, Krall shuddered in pleasure and reluctantly pulled out of Brian’s sucking throat.<br />
<br />
“It is done, you are mine completely.” Kral said simply<br />
<br />
Brian wept for joy and kissed his master’s genitals.</p>
