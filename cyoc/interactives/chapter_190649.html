<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel and Hunter ran after one another, randomly turning corners running into dead end after dead end, not noticing that when they had to back track the hallways were not the same. After five minutes they both slowed down to catch their breath. While the two of the did this, Daniel looked around the dim space for any clues on how they could get out of the Magical Maze Rooms of Wounder. He noticed thick lines painted on the walls. He looked towards an intersection and saw that they were painted in a way that looked like an arrow pointing to the left. “Let’s go that way,” he said to Hunter pointing to the left. Hunter tried to argue back saying that they had just taken a wrong turn back up the hallway, but Daniel pointed at the arrows and hunter relented, walking behind his brother. <br />
Because both Daniel and Hunter were the same height, neither one noticed when they both gained three inches in height leaving them at 5’7. Their clothes didn’t change at all, leaving them in smaller shirts that were tighter and a little shorter. <br />
Because of the dim lighting, both Daniel and Hunter failed to notice that their skin began turn a light brown and their hair began turn from a sandy blond into a rich black. <br />
After a minute of walking down the hall, the two entered a small room with a large circle taking up most of the floor. Looking around the room for any clues, Daniel and Hunter walked onto the middle of the circle. With a jolt the circle started to turn, leaving the twins in a tangle heap in the floor. The brothers tried to pull themselves up over and over, but it was like the floor was made of ice. When one of them would get to their feet they would slip and fall back to the floor. Every once and while they would get to their feet holding one another but let go as soon as they got to their feet. Each time they worked together, they seemed to read what the other was going to do easier and easier, until they had shakily made it to the edge of the spinning circle. <br />
Daniel and Hunter gave a yell of victory, they had beaten the puzzle together, like they always did. Forgotten was the brotherly rivalry of who was the better twin. The two, still dizzy from being spun, held on to each other. Being dizzy, Hunter and Daniel failed to notice that their skin had become bronzed, and their now black hair became sun-bleached from many hours in the sun, with the memories of endless hours of video game fading and being replaced by time outside at the beach and working out filling their place, sliming down their bodies giving them beach bodies. Their hair had also grown but had started to form curls, so it didn’t look and longer. Their clothing had also been affected by the spinning. Daniel and Hunters matching polo shirts had shrunken and tightened a little more so that their belly button was now just barely peeking out from under the bottom of the shirt. The collar had disappeared turning the polos into tight t-shirts. Their shorts had also shrunk until they reached their mid-thigh, and their shoes had changed the most drastically. Gone where their socks and shoes, and in their place where a pair of backless sandals. The biggest change, however, was not the most easily seen. The two had aged two years. They were now two sixteen years olds.<br />
“Where do we go from here?” Daniel asked Hunter, who had a feeling that that question was coming. Before he could answer a loud thunk could be heard to the right of the twins. The two quickly looked toward the noise and saw a flashing light around the conner. “That way.” Hunter replied flatly. The two loosened their grip on the other and begin to walk to the hallway with the flashing light. They walked closer and more in sink then they had before, keeping an eye out for anything odd.<br />
Daniel and Hunter rounded the corner of the short hallway and looked down an even longer hallway that had no lights in the ceiling, just a feint light at the end of it. There was a soft swoosh and a hidden down closed behind them. With no other way to go, the twins begin the walk towards the feint light. <br />
The twins quickly fell into a silent lockstep that brought them closer to the end, and closer to their new forms. <br />
After two minutes of walking the two had passed their oldest sister in age by one year. The eighteen-year-olds also started to become more feminine. Their hips thighs and ass grew to much more pleasant proportions, giving the twins a pleasant sway to their steps.<br />
Hunter looked over to their left when something in the corner of their eye moved. “What the fuck!” he said in Portuguese, as he fell onto his now bigger ass. During the fall he had a feeling of his stomach dropping, which was his penis receding into his body, forming a vagina. “What is it, Isabella?” asked her sister Maria in English. “That thing spooked me.” Isabella responded, back in English while pointing at a cardboard cutout of a stock photo doing an odd pose as it quickly disappeared back into a small indent in the wall. Maria laughed as she helped her twin off the floor. Isabella dusted off the back of her shorts, which had shrunk into a pair of tight low-rise short shorts. <br />
As they continued on their hair grew longer and wavier until it was shoulder length. The memories of them coming to the island with their family faded as new ones of them coming here with one of their friends, their friend’s girlfriend, and their friends sister and her boyfriend replaced them. Memories of a Brazilian father and Portuguese mother raising the two of them in the United States replaced that of Karren and Jim. And their middle school education grew and expanded until they had a college education, though they liked their modeling gig on the side more than any classes they attended. With most of their new memories in place the twins reached the age of twenty-two and stopped aging. <br />
After what felt like another ten minutes Maria and Isabella reached the light source. It was a dim bulb that was above a mirror. Walking up to the mirror the twins new reflections looked back at them. They both had toned bodies that they where happy with, with nice hips that they liked to swing at the clubs they partied at, and butts they like to tease the boy the two of them wanted for the night. They both however had flat chests that they wish was a little bigger so that when they fished for boys they would get more bites. The twins had similar outfits on, but the long walk down the dark corridor had altered them a little. Both had on a tight belly shirt but Maria’s was a black shirt with yellow markings while Isabella had on a yellow shirt with black markings. On their bottom halves both had on a pair of grey low rise shorts with bikini bottoms that had inverted colors of the wearers top peeking over the top them. <br />
Maria and Isabella looked both left and right if the mirror and saw identical hallways that both turned right. They quickly played a game of rock paper scissors to pick a way forward. Isabella won so they went down the right hallway and turned right. Thirty seconds later they where standing back in front of another mirror. The twins studied the mirror just in case it held a clue. But alas it wasn’t even a fun house mirror because all it sawed was the two of them in their bikini tops, shorts, and sandals. Maria adjusted her bikini top so it stopped bugging her.” I hope the end is close,” said Isabella to her sister in Portuguese,” I want to get down to beach to see if we could snag any hotties.” They had been convinced by the attendant that going through the Maze was quicker then walking straight to the beach. That and the friend wanted to try the maze. “Both ways look the same as the last one,” said Maria. “Lets go the same direction and see it any thing changes. <br />
It did not. Both were left scratching their heads when Isabella pulled out a marker from their purse and drew a one on the mirror. They then walked right for the third time and came to another mirror. The same mirror the had just left in fact. “That doesn’t make any sense,” said Isabella” Come on.” She added pulling her twin down the left hallway. The mirror was different. <br />
The light was brighter and the hallway them spent forever walking down was gone. This time it was Isabella that adjusted her top, but it was to make sure her A cup breasts filled the top better. Confused that walking backwards changed the room, Maria pulled her sister back the way they came and came across the same mirror. She then ran back the way she came and found a mirror with a brighter light. Maria stopped running abruptly causing her B cup breasts to shift in an uncomfortable manor. <br />
After Isabella caught up, they both figured that the way forward was a process of elimination. Try one way and if that fails go the other. They tried the left and that lead them back around, so they went left and found a brighter light then the last one. This caused Maria and Isabella to excitedly hug causing their C cups breasts to press together. <br />
The last path out of the maze was easy. Both of them smelled the ocean breeze coming from the left. The walked down the short hallway and out into the sun they loved so much. <br />
At the same time…</p>
