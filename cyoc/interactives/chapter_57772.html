<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Are you sure we should be doing this?&quot; Helen whispered in my ear as we entered the <br />
forest. &quot;If we get caught out of bounds we'll be in so much trouble. Not to mention that <br />
it's dangerous. The centaurs are getting hostile you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at Helen and whispered back, &quot;I do know that but Katrina came into the forest <br />
for some reason. She's been leaving the school quite a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if Katrina is a werewolf?&quot; Helen whispered as she looked up at the sky. &quot;I don't <br />
want to die or be turned into a werewolf if we survive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Katrina's not a werewolf,&quot; I said a bit annoyed. &quot;If she was she wouldn't be attending <br />
school or would be locked up during the full moon. No there's something else going <br />
on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What else could it be though?&quot; Helen asked her voice rising in fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe she's been coming out to practice magic,&quot; I suggested shrugging. &quot;Maybe <br />
she's trying to become an Animagi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think she would try that after what Professor Hackett said about it going horribly <br />
wrong without supervision?&quot; Helen asked with a look that clearly said she didn't think <br />
Katrina would do that.<br />
<br />
&quot;She may,&quot; I said shrugging my shoulders. &quot;At least if she gets stuck my sisters and I <br />
can change her back with the pearls our father gave us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd still like to meet your father,&quot; Helen said. Shaking her head she continued, &quot;I still <br />
have a hard time believing that Professor Hackett is actually Hecate (pronounced&nbsp;<br />
HEK-&amp;#601;-tee).&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well she is,&quot; I said giggling. &quot;It makes sense that she would be teaching in a magic <br />
school since she is the goddess of magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
We heard a rustling in the bushes and Helen grabbed my arm. I touched my bracelet <br />
and it grew into my shield. If it was the centaurs I hoped that they would notice I was <br />
taking a purely defensive stance and not attack. It was with relief that we saw Katrina <br />
come out of the bushes. Helen ran to her and threw her arms around her giving her a <br />
long kiss. I smiles at the sight then Helen broke the kiss and said, &quot;You scared us. <br />
What have you been doing out here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Helen could respond though ten centaurs came out of the bushes with their <br />
arrows drawn. One of them was bigger than the others and he asked in a dangerous <br />
tone,&quot;What are you doing in our forest?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were just looking for our friend,&quot; I said bowing a bit and making my voice <br />
respectful. &quot;We mean you no harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you really expect us to believe that?&quot; the big centaur asked with a snort. &quot;We <br />
know what you humans think of us. You think that we're mere beasts that you can <br />
order around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We would never call you beasts,&quot; I said putting my conviction behind my words. &quot;And <br />
we would never think to order you around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All humans think alike,&quot; the big centaur said. &quot;Bring them.&quot;<br />
<br />
I saw Helen and Katrina reach for their wands and I said, &quot;Don't make any aggressive <br />
moves otherwise they will kill us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wise words for a human,&quot; the big centaur said. &quot;Put your shield away.&quot;<br />
<br />
I touched my shield and it shrank back down to my bracelet. A centaur grabbed me <br />
from behind and hoisted me up. Two others did the same with Katrina and Helen who <br />
had looks of fear on their faces. I gave them a reassuring smile and then the centaurs <br />
took us deeper into the forest.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
I slowly woke up feeling like something was wrong. I wasn't wearing my pajama pants <br />
or panties. I felt a tube running from my genitals over my left leg and another tube on <br />
my right arm. Opening my eyes I saw that I wasn't in the home anymore and there <br />
was an IV in my arm. I could only guess that the tube I was feeling between my legs <br />
was a catheter and I was in a hospital. I didn't know how I had gotten here or why I <br />
was here. I looked under the covers and was glad to see that I was still a girl. As soon <br />
as I put the covers down a nurse came in smiling and said, &quot;I see you're awake. That's <br />
good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did I get here?&quot; I asked in a raspy voice. My throat and mouth were so dry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you've been unconscious for the last two days since the fire,&quot; the nurse said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fire?&quot; I asked not remembering any fire.<br />
<br />
&quot;The furnace at the home blew causing a fire,&quot; the nurse said looking sad. &quot;You're the <br />
only survivor.&quot;<br />
<br />
I just stared at her in disbelief. That couldn't be true. My first dream had me and my <br />
sisters on a train to Salem's Witch Academy. They couldn't be dead could they? No I <br />
refused to believe that they were dead. Something was going on and I didn't like it. I <br />
was about to get up when I felt something burning in my arm. I hadn't noticed the <br />
nurse come up beside me and as I looked at her now I saw her withdraw a needle <br />
from the IV tube. I wondered what she had injected into me and would have asked but <br />
I couldn't speak. I tried moving but found that I couldn't. As a laid there the nurse took <br />
out the IV and then the catheter. She had a couple orderlies come in and put me on a <br />
gurney. They then wheeled me out of the room and I wondered where they were <br />
taking me.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later I had been wheeled into a room that I didn't think was part of the <br />
hospital and the nurse said, &quot;Here she is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; a male voice said coming into view. He took off the hospital gown I was <br />
wearing leaving me completely naked and asked, &quot;What time did you inject her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;12:42 pm,&quot; the nurse said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then her time of death will be 1:30 pm,&quot; the man said looking me over. &quot;She is pretty <br />
and will make an excellent mannequin.&quot;<br />
<br />
I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I tried moving again but whatever the nurse <br />
injected me with was still working. The orderlies lifted me off of the gurney and put me <br />
on some sort of tray on a conveyor belt. The man came over and spread my legs a bit <br />
then he went out of my field of vision. I heard what sounded like jets of water begin to <br />
spray and felt the conveyor belt start to move. I felt the liquid hit my feet and I knew it <br />
wasn't water since I couldn't control it. My feet felt like they were hardening as the <br />
liquid hit my legs. The hardening hurt and I wanted to cry out but I was powerless to <br />
do so. I could only suffer in silence as more of my body entered the spray and <br />
hardened. The pain became unbearable when my genitals entered the spray. When <br />
my chest entered the spray I stopped breathing and my heart stopped beating. I <br />
thought I was going to die right there and then but I didn't. Soon my entire body had <br />
been through the spray and was hard but at least I wasn't in pain anymore. Somehow <br />
I could still feel my body and I knew that I was made almost entirely of the stuff <br />
mannequins are made of.<br />
<br />
&quot;She did turn out to be a lovely mannequin,&quot; the nurse said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew she would when I saw her,&quot; the man said as the orderlies picked me up and <br />
carried me over to some sort of pedestal with a metal rod sticking up from it.&nbsp;I felt the <br />
metal rod run up through the heel of my right foot and up through my leg a short up. <br />
&quot;Now to get her measurements,&quot; the man said coming into view again holding a <br />
measuring tape. He was going to measure me himself it seemed. He looked behind <br />
me and said, &quot;Height 61 inches.&quot; He then took the measuring tape and wrapped it <br />
around my chest saying, &quot;Chest 29 inches.&quot; He repeated this for my waist and hips for <br />
measurements of 24 inches and 30 inches. He then asked, &quot;How old was she?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She was eleven,&quot; the nurse said.<br />
<br />
The man looked thoughtful then said, &quot;Well she was pretty tall for eleven and it looks <br />
like she had an A cup.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man reached down and grabbed my right arm and hand then twisted. I heard and <br />
felt a little click before he took my hand off. He pushed down on my right shoulder and <br />
pulled up straight up on my. Once again I heard and felt the click but this time I could <br />
see my arm come up before the man removed it. The same happened to my left hand <br />
and arm then the man grabbed me around my waist while one of the orderlies held <br />
below my hips. With a twist and click my body was divided in half at my hips. There <br />
was another twist with my left leg and I was fully disassembled. My parts were placed <br />
on a conveyor belt and passed through some sort of machine. As each part was <br />
passed through I felt them flex into new poses. Once all my parts were through I was <br />
reassembled and put on a metal base in front of mirrors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you do that?&quot; the nurse asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like to imagine that they're still alive and can see what lovely mannequins they've <br />
made,&quot; the man said.<br />
<br />
Well I could see myself. My left hand was on my hip with my head turned to the right a <br />
little bit. My right arm and hand looked like they were relaxed and my feet were spread <br />
apart a bit. My breasts were still the same size though my nipples were just round <br />
protrusions now and my crotch was blank. My hair looked like it was a wig and I was <br />
smiling slightly. I was disassembled again and packed up into a shipping crate. I had <br />
to wonder where I was going.</p>
