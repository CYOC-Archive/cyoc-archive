<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bobby had been patiently and diligently finishing his lunch of potatoes and sausage when his school crush Runa had passed him the magical note. He opened it up and read...<br />
<br />
To my new friend,<br />
<br />
You look so bored, just sitting there. Here's a game to amuse yourself into. Have fun! I know I did! Your new friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm&quot; said Bobby to himself in his nasally tone of voice. He didn't know what to make of this. Runa had always been nice to him, or at least not contemptible of him, so maybe she really did want to be his friend? But she has never indicated before that she wanted to pass the olive branch of friendship, and by the way she hurried off to her class, might this be some kind of joke? &quot;Nah, if it were, she would probably want to see me get humiliated&quot;, Bobby noted. Oh sure, she helped him out in gym class when he struggled sometimes, and earlier in the year she pointed out a few mistakes on his calculus homework when they were study buddies that one time(Bobby absolutely LOVED a girl that could kick his ass. Runa could, both physically and intellectually). At the time, Bobby yelled at her in his nerd voice that it was impossible that he could have gotten something so easy like calculus questions wrong, but she was nice and polite enough to correct his mistakes, and then throw in some verbal wordplay that embarrassed but not humiliated his ego. <br />
<br />
Bobby continued to read the note anyway. It looked like it was a quiz of some kind, like a personality test, and he always enjoyed those. Luckily he didn't have to go to class until 1:30.<br />
<br />
Question 1: If you were a girl... would your handwriting be nice?<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of question is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby had considered putting the test/game away, but then the note had changed the wording of the question.<br />
<br />
Question 1: Your dream girl... would her handwriting be nice?<br />
<br />
Bobby blinked at the change in questioning, and assumed that he had just read the question wrong. <br />
<br />
He wrote down, &quot;Yes, she would have nice handwriting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 2: Would your dream girl like the color pink?<br />
<br />
Bobby didn't mind pink himself. Thinking that the maxim that &quot;pink is for girl&quot; was arbitrary, he wrote down &quot;Yes, but she would like all the colors, and her favorite ones would be different shades of green.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 3: Would your dream girls hair be straight or curly?<br />
<br />
Bobby loved curly hair on women, but not all the time. He wrote...<br />
<br />
&quot;She would have extremely curly hair when the humidity level is high. Curly enough without it being an afro, but in less humid weather it would just be wavy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby didn't notice as all the  hairs on his head began to become more curly. It looked as if he had just gotten out of the shower.<br />
<br />
He also didn't notice that his pen ink was now forest green, as he was slowly turning into his dream girl.<br />
<br />
Question 4: What would be your dream girls favorite color?<br />
<br />
Bobby already answered this. Annoyed, he wrote down &quot;Green, all shades.&quot;<br />
<br />
All of his pens now had different shades of green ink.<br />
<br />
Question 5: What color would your dream girls hair be?<br />
<br />
Bobby thought it over for a while. Hair color really didn't make a difference as to whether he liked a girl or not, but since Runa's hair was dark red and he liked her the most, he wrote down:<br />
<br />
&quot;Dark red hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
His hair suddenly turned that color, though Bobby didn't notice it. He looked down at his watch, and it said the time was 1:10. He had twenty minutes left.<br />
<br />
Question 6: What color would your dream girl's eyes be?<br />
<br />
&quot;This is easy&quot;, he both said and wrote. &quot;Green. Emerald Green.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby didn't notice as his eyes turned the color of envy.<br />
<br />
Question 7: Would your dream girl like makeup?<br />
<br />
Bobby thought this was a silly question. He didn't care about makeup, so why would his dream girl care?<br />
<br />
&quot;She would use makeup, but wouldn't really care either way about it. She would just think of it as a social convention that she didn't mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 8: Would your dream girl be sporty?<br />
<br />
As I noted earlier, Bobby loves girls who could kick his ass. And even though he wasn't athletic in the least, he admired those who were. He figured that &quot;jocks&quot; were just sports geeks when he was just a math and science geek.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dream girl would excel in every sport, both team based and individual based. She would be as athletic as she could possibly be in every area without looking freakish.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby suddenly bent over due to the unexpected weight of his newly formed stomach muscles. He also noticed that his arms were burning. Pulling up his sleeves, he noticed that they were now toned and more muscular than before, but not TOO muscular. In fact, his arms looked like the arms of a particularly athletic female. His legs felt the same way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird&quot;, whispered Bobby to himself. He thought for a moment that the note was magical and somehow transforming him, but he thought the better of it. He's probably just excited and psyching himself out, Bobby rationalized. This test was getting a little weird, but it was indeed fun and he couldn't stop now.<br />
<br />
Question 9: Would your dream girl wear high heels?<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes&quot; was quickly jotted down. Bobby didn't care either way what she wore.<br />
<br />
Likewise, the next question was also a no brainer and a waste of time:<br />
<br />
Question 10: Would your dream girl wear a skirt?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but no more so than pants, shorts, jeans, dresses or whatever. Skirts would be just one part of her wardrobe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby didn't notice the sudden draft his legs were feeling as his jeans turned into a purple silk skirt that ended just at his knees.<br />
<br />
Question 11: Would your dream girl wear jewelry?<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Bobby didn't care for jewelry. He didn't even like carrying his iPhone, much less something superficial.<br />
<br />
Question 12: What size would your dream girl's breasts be?<br />
<br />
Bobby didn't know much about bras, being a nerd and all. He did watch a show once though where a big breasted girl said that she had natural 33C's, so that's what Bobby wrote down on the quiz.<br />
<br />
His shirt suddenly puffed out with his wish.<br />
<br />
He looked down in shock. So he WAS turning into a girl. His dream girl. He looked down at his hands again. Yup, just as he figured. They were big, he then he looked at his also large clearly girlish looking hands. Pulling his sleeves up, he immediately noticed the lack of body hair on his arms. He felt the top of his head. Curly hair? He didn't have curly hair! <br />
<br />
Bobby, panting, started to erase his answers to the questions he already responded to in hopes of mitigating these developments, but then the quiz itself vanished, replaced by a warning.<br />
<br />
ALL ANSWERS ARE FINAL. YOU MUST ANSWER EVERY QUESTION, OR ELSE.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or else what?&quot; Bobby asked the piece of paper angrily. The warning then vanished too, replaced by this:<br />
<br />
&quot;OR ELSE. PUNISHMENT OF MY DECIDING.&quot; Then the quiz reappeared, with Bobby's erased answers reappearing in his new curvy handwriting.<br />
<br />
Bobby sighed. Then a voice said to him, &quot;finish&quot;.<br />
<br />
Question 13: What would be your dream girl's intelligence be on a scale of one to ten? One being stupid and ten being high enough to drive the class nerd up the wall.<br />
<br />
Bobby WAS the class nerd, so he wondered what would happen if he wrote down what he was thinking of writing down. If it were feasible, maybe he would be able to find a way of turning back into a boy later. He wrote:<br />
<br />
&quot;My intellect would be off the scale. I would have the scientific genius of Reed Richards from Marvel Comics, the deductive abilities and detective skills of Sherlock Holmes, a world class wit, and I would be one of the smartest people in existence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, an avalanche of brain power seeped into Bobby's brain. Neurons fired up in ways he couldn't even had pondered a moment earlier, and he suddenly became both very excited and very depressed. Depressed because he was so far above everyone else in intellect now, and happy because...because he was so far above everyone else now. If he had to be a girl temporarily, it was worth it just to feel the oneness with reality he now felt.<br />
<br />
Question 14: Would your dream girl be into guys?<br />
<br />
Bobby cringed at this question, but since it appeared he was going to be a girl no matter what, he decided to make the best of it, and then wrote:<br />
<br />
&quot;I will be bisexual, but I will tend to prefer other girls. Sometimes if I like a boy enough, I might date him, especially if he's a geek.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby didn't want to be a complete lesbian. Not that he was homophobic, but it just felt...weird to him. Uncomfortable. So he would be attracted mostly to other girls, but it wouldn't be impossible for a boy to catch her interest.<br />
<br />
Bobby looked around the mostly empty lunch hall, and found himself attracted in equal parts to both the boys and girls that were remaining. He checked his watch again. 1:15<br />
<br />
Question 15: If you were a girl... would you use pads or tampons?<br />
<br />
Bobby knew that this was it. The point of no return. Hell, the genie or whatever it was that was fulfilling the questions replies didn't even give into the &quot;dream girl&quot; pretense anymore. When he answered this question, he knew that he would transform completely into a girl. He wrote down quickly: &quot;Tampons&quot;<br />
<br />
He then felt his old parts quickly melt away, replaced by new girly parts. Then he felt the tampon make it way up his new crack. He was both ashamed and truthfully...fascinated at these new developments. Bobby inhaled deeply.<br />
<br />
Question 16: If you were a girl... would you shave?<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I would have surgery making sure that I would be hair free except for my eyelashes, brows, and the hair on the top of my head.&quot;<br />
<br />
And the last remaining leg and armpit hair fell off of Bobby's body.<br />
<br />
Question 17: If you were a girl... what type of shirt would you be wearing right now?<br />
<br />
&quot;The same shirt I am now, except it's now a girl's shirt.&quot;<br />
<br />
His shirt made a few adjustments to compensate for his breasts. There was now more room in the middle for the fabric to stretch out.<br />
<br />
Question 18: If you would were a girl... would you be wearing briefs, bikini, thong or boxers?<br />
<br />
&quot;None, I usually go commando.&quot;<br />
<br />
No changes were made, as Bobby wasn't wearing any undergarments anyway.<br />
<br />
Question 19: If you were a girl... what type of bra would you be wearing?<br />
<br />
&quot;A comfortable one with a comic book design on it. No wait, it would have the Death Note logo on each cup.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby's bouncing breasts were now supported by a black and white Death Note 33C bra.<br />
<br />
Question 20: If you were a girl... how old would you be, how tall would you be without shoes and what would you weigh without clothes?(Don't lie)<br />
<br />
Bobby was 15, and he didn't want to be any older. So he wrote down:<br />
<br />
&quot;15 years old, 134lbs, and I would currently be 6' even, but I would grow to a maximum height of 6'3 when I turn 18.&quot;<br />
<br />
The table Bobby was writing on suddenly got further and further away from his face as he grew a few inches from his barely average male height of 5'8 to an almost Amazonian height for a woman of 6'. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; he said, surprised at both his new body and his sweet alto voice.<br />
<br />
A few heads suddenly turned Bobby's way, and looked at the genius jock chick in the corner, who was allowed to skip certain classes for the week so she could think up her own lesson programs.<br />
<br />
Question 21: If you were a girl... what type of shoes are you wearing?<br />
<br />
Bobby jotted down: &quot;Just comfortable girl's sneakers. Pink.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 22: If you were a girl... what other accessories would you be wearing?<br />
<br />
&quot;Just my watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Question 23: If you were a girl... how long would your hair be, and how would you wear it?<br />
<br />
Bobby liked long hair, but not so long that it got in the way of belt buckles and going to the bathroom, so he wrote:<br />
<br />
&quot;Long enough so I can put my hair into Princess Leia buns if I wanted to. I would also have bangs that covered my entire forehead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby's hair then grew to her lower back, and then indeed formed themselves into two buns on the side of her head, tied together with some girlish ribbons. Her red bangs nearly fell in front of her face. Giggling, she realized that she had reached the final question.<br />
<br />
Question 24: If you were a girl... what would your name be?<br />
<br />
Bobby's mom had always told him that his name if he were born a girl would have been Candice Marie Searle. He thought for a moment if that's what he should change his name to. He toyed with making a distaff tribute to his comic book hero, Reed Richards, considering calling himself Rebecca Renee Searle. But his mom was the one who birthed him, so shouldn't she decide her name? Bobby couldn't make heads or tails of it, so he acquired a quarter from his new purse, and tossed it in the air. &quot;Heads, I'm Candice. Tails, I'm Becky.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby caught the quarter of her forearm, uncovered her left hand from it...<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, my name is now Rebecca(AKA 'Becky') Renee Searle&quot; she wrote on the card.<br />
<br />
At the very bottom of the quiz was this postscript:<br />
<br />
If you want to have a happy life as a girl, pass this on to the next person. Boy or Girl, doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Becky then looked around the room, crumbled the note into a little ball, and tossed it onto someone's table. She meanwhile was going to her research lab, trying to figure out the secrets of magic that befell her into this quandary. As she walked out of the cafeteria and into the hallway, she was ogled by everyone, and her confidence level was at an all time high. She was the best of all worlds: brainy, beautiful and brawny. Almost a literal Mary Sue. She was only 15, but could rewrite all of Michio Kaku's and Stephen Hawking's work for them, and she would!</p>
