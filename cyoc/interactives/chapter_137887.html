<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arriving at home you find your mother asleep on the couch, TV on, a box of chocolate chip cookies next to her and a paperback book resting on her chest. You know that work&#39;s been stressful for her the past few months due to the promotion she&#39;s been trying for and it&#39;s starting to get the better of her. Everyday she comes home exhausted, has a snack, takes a nap and then cooks dinner, a routine that&#39;s caused her to gain a few pounds. It&#39;s nothing too bad, but she&#39;s been complaining about what it&#39;s doing to her figure, not that she has the energy to do anything about it. Looking at the light still in your hand, you wonder if you can make some changes to improve her situation in some way. You know that she&#39;s long suspected that her boss favored men over women, not out of misogyny, but because her boss was a woman and seemed to view other women, even those working under her, as competition.<br />
<br />
Turning the light to &#39;or&#39; and setting it to light blue you start shining it on her chest.<br />
<br />
The change isn&#39;t what you expected. Her breasts, soft and sagging thanks to a combination of age and weight, flatten and shrink slightly, but not as much as you would have thought. Her bra helps support them, but it&#39;s not enough to make them look like actual breasts rather than the soft flab of an overweight man. You turn the light up a little higher and they shrink a bit more, but at the same time her chest and shoulders expand, straining against the blouse she&#39;s wearing and pulling it open enough that you can see fine hairs across her chest, hairs that are growing thicker and darker as you watch.<br />
<br />
Nervous, you bring the light lower, to her stomach and watch as the soft paunch she&#39;s developed expands into a full on gut, straining her blouse until the changes catch up with it, causing it to grow several sizes to fit her larger torso. In her sleep she shifts slightly, and stretches, her shirt lifting enough for you to get a glimpse at her stomach and the thick trail of hair running up the center of it, originating below the waist of her skirt. The trail of hairs fan out, spreading across her stomach.<br />
<br />
You take a step back to look at what you&#39;ve done, given her a large, hairy male torso while leaving her head, arms and legs unchanged. It&#39;s unsettling and the temptation to reverse the changes is strong, but you remember that you wanted to see the changes the light would have on reality and observe them first hand, so you decide to press on.<br />
<br />
Best to make things at least slightly less strange then.<br />
<br />
This time you bring the light down to her feet. Since she&#39;s not wearing shoes and she&#39;s taken her stockings off you get an excellent view of her feet growing in size, going from small and dainty to large, hair growing on the backs of her toes for good measure. Moving the light higher you watch as her legs thicken, dark hairs sprouting on them.<br />
<br />
You stop just short of her crotch because you want to keep her your mom and therefore female, though you do bring the light across her hips, watching them rearrange to go from wide to powerful. It would seem that you&#39;ve got the light at a high enough setting that it&#39;s working to make your mom quite the impressive example of masculinity despite her not being in the best of shape.<br />
<br />
To further even things out you take shine it on her arms. There you get the best and most dramatic results so far. Her fingers thicken, hairs growing on the backs of them, becoming strong and manly. Despite this her nails stay long and well maintained, right down to the tasteful french manicure that she got on her last day off. You suppose it makes sense, you haven&#39;t used the inanimate setting or made any changes to her mind so there&#39;s no reason that she wouldn&#39;t want to let her nails grow long or go to a beauty parlor for a manicure. Bringing the light higher up on her arms the changes only get more dramatic. There&#39;s hair of course, apparently your mother would have been quite the bear of a man, but there&#39;s also muscle, to the extent where you get the impression that she might have worked out at some point. Maybe she did, you&#39;ll have to figure out a way to find out based on how reality changes.<br />
<br />
Seeing her head, unchanged on such an otherwise manly body is still strange enough to be unsettling and you decide that there&#39;s only one thing to do.<br />
<br />
Bracing yourself for what you&#39;re about to do and see, you slowly bring the light up her neck, watching as an Adam&#39;s apple bulges into being. You&#39;re sure that she&#39;ll have a deep voice when she wakes up and you&#39;re curious as to what she&#39;ll sound like, but that can wait a few more minutes at least.<br />
<br />
When the light reaches her chin stubble appears, gradually growing into a full beard as her jawline grows more angular, just a hint of excess weight lingering to soften it. Her lips become thinner, though they remain noticeable thanks to the light pink lipstick she put on that morning, standing out amidst her beard and rapidly sprouting mustache. Higher still the changes continue, her eyebrows becoming thicker and darker, though still carefully shaped, making it clear that she still plucks them each morning.<br />
<br />
You decide to leave her hair as it is, shoulder length and carefully styled to leave some visible trace of femininity to her.<br />
<br />
The results are shocking to say the least and you can&#39;t help but stare at the bulky, hairy man that your mother had become. Or not quite a man you remind yourself, you left her crotch unchanged and her mind, so she&#39;ll still think of herself as a woman and be one where it counts. Still, seeing her new, masculine body still clad in a blouse and skirt is something else.<br />
<br />
You don&#39;t have long to admire your handiwork though. Shifting in her sleep again she yawns loudly and scratches her hairy stomach with one hand and rubs at her beard with the other.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re certain that she&#39;ll notice the changes and that she&#39;ll wake up fully and panic, but instead she calmly opens her eyes and looks at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must have dozed off on the sofa,&quot; she apologizes, her voice every bit as deep as you&#39;d expect it to be, &quot;Sorry. I hope I&#39;m not too late to start dinner. Is your father home yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope and I just got in,&quot; you reassure, amazed that despite the physical changes nothing else seems different. Maybe you should have done some mental changes too, but now that she&#39;s awake, even if she won&#39;t notice anything, you&#39;re not feeling brave enough to try the light, &quot;How was your day?&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiles and stands up and for the first time you realize how tall she is, at least six foot four since she&#39;s taller than you are, &quot;Not bad, busy though. Ever since I got that promotion I&#39;ve had a lot more responsibility piled on me. I can&#39;t tell if Vicky&#39;s setting me up to fail or if she really has that much faith in me. You know how she is about other women.&quot;<br />
<br />
You know that Vicky is her boss and you&#39;ve already encountered the first change, she got the promotion that she&#39;d been wanting, &quot;You&#39;ve told me, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
You trail off, gesturing kind of helplessly at her, not sure what you&#39;d been wanting to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; she lets out a deep chuckle, &quot;There are times I think that if I didn&#39;t put on makeup and wear a skirt she&#39;d forget that I&#39;m a woman, but I&#39;m not going to complain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Smoothing her blouse over her chest she starts walking towards the kitchen. You watch her, noticing that despite her increased size and bulk she still walks with a decidedly feminine sway to her hips.<br />
<br />
While she&#39;s in the kitchen you walk around the house, curious to see what&#39;s changed. The answer turns out to be not all that much. In the laundry room you note that all her clothing is still women&#39;s clothing, albeit in much larger sizes, including her bras and panties. It&#39;s kind of creepy to think of your mom wearing women&#39;s underwear given how she looks now, but it&#39;s apparent that she still does.<br />
<br />
The other big change is the family photos around the house. They now all show her as a man, even the wedding photo hung up in the living room. It shows your father in a suit, the same as always except younger, standing next to your mother in her wedding dress. In the picture your mom looks outwardly like a virile young man, strong and muscular, sporting sideburns and a well groomed goatee, her hairy arms and a good portion of her chest, slab-like pecs also covered in a dense pelt, proudly on display thanks to the cut of her white dress. Both her and your father look so happy in the picture, not a single hint that anything&#39;s out of the ordinary, despite your father being dwarfed by your large, manly mother.<br />
<br />
In the kitchen you can hear her humming to herself as she gets to work making dinner.</p>
