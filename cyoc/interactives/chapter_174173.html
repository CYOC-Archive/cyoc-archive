<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scott and Alora backtracked to the Magic shop. Noel (formerly Joe) and Erika had asked to be put back inside their Sluttyballs so that they wouldn&#39;t be seen in public dressed how they were. Both Scott and Alora also had quickly agreed to that. Luckily the shop was nearby so the awkward walk wasn&#39;t too bad. <br />
<br />
After entering the shop, they made their way to the front counter in order to ask the owner more about the Sluttyballs and how to release their respective partners. The old man appeared after a few seconds and immediately began talking without giving them even a chance to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sluttyballs are a magical tool which bring captured humans into a battle-esque style game where the objective is to either get their opponent&#39;s trainer, their opponent&#39;s Sluttymon, or their own trainer to cum first. In the case of the first 2, the one who comes first loses, and the opposite is true for the third. To keep it fair, when a battle is established, by default, option 1 is used if none of the other 2 are specified. And each trainer&#39;s arousal level is set down to 0 at the start. Each trainer can have up to 6 sluttymon at once, but may only use a predetermined amount at once, which gets set before the battle begins. As a sluttymon levels up, which is done by winning battles and gaining XP, their skills and appearances gradually become more and more seductive and slutty. Some Sluttymon can evolve too, gaining either an entirely new wardrobe, or a sluttier version of their own. Also, all male sluttymon will evolve at level 2 into a girl version of themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and once captured, all Sluttymon are permanently kept, and can only be released once they either reach max level, or win first place in one if the many Sluttymon tournaments held every year. When a person becomes a Sluttymon, their existence is altered so that the world acknowledges them as being Sluttymon. And they are seen as if this is something like their career, which isn&#39;t taken in a bad way. So they shouldn&#39;t need to hide from the public.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lastly, all Sluttymon come in different types. And their strength in a battle is heavily dependent on the sexual preferences of their target. Not meet their baseline and your Sluttymon will be useless. On the other hand, if you match them perfectly, sometimes, but also quite rarely, the targets may even cum on the very first touch. A sluttymon&#39;s skills and their proficiency with them are also big factors. A well seasoned sluttymon with a lower typing strength can still beat a amature skill level Sluttymon with a higher typing advantage. Oh, and win or lose, be respectful. If you do lose, just take your day punishment and move on, dont bitch about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man was about to leave when Alora called out to him. &quot;Wait, what do you mean by day punishment?&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man looked back and replied. &quot;Whoever loses a battle can&#39;t participate anymore for a half hour, nor can they cum again for a 24 hour period, outside of a battle, no matter how horny or on the edge they are. This is meant to be a light hearted game for damn sakes. It isnt like we are going to demand you do something extreme. Of course you can decide anything additional on top of that yourself, but then it is your own decision to accept it or not too. Now go. And before you come back asking  yes. Their unused Sluttyballs are now their trainers property to use however they see fit.&quot; And with that the old man disappeared once again.<br />
<br />
Scott and Alora left the shop and released Erika and Noel. And as the man said, no one seemed to care that the 2 girls who were dressed how they were, were out in public. No one really paid them too much mind, outside of a lot of glances that is. &quot;Well this is just perfect. The 2 of us are stuck like this until you guys win some kind of tournament&quot; complained Erika. Before either Scott or Alora could say a word, Noel responded, timing it almost the exact moment Erika stopped speaking. &quot;Erika, enough. You need to just accept that this is how it will be for a while. Nothing any of us can do, can instantly fix this. That being said, I do think we should become partners. A sexy nurse paired with a slutty french maid would make for a strong team that should be pretty hard to beat, in my opinion. Plus that is just costumes. I seem to excell in submissive acts, as well as fulfilling requests. And, if I had to guess, a nurse would have more dominant acts, and could also be strong in both bondage and possibly something involving sadomasochism. Like, maybe you are more of a support style Sluttymon where you either hinder enemy progress or boost your allies?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erika listened to her ideas, but didn&#39;t really get it yet. &quot;Assuming any of that is true, then what role would you play?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am likely a DPS style Sluttymon given that my current skills seem to be based around having different ways for me to service my target. So I would guess I will win out in the end if battles go long. So really, our combined weaknesses are pretty much condensed down to just needing quick hitter style Sluttymon to be covered. If I had to guess, I would say, maybe either a sexy masseuse, a sexy bimbo slut, or a sex demon like a Succubus, if getting someone to become one of those is even possible for us that is. In addition, either of us could possibly evolve and either go into a new class or gain a wider range of skills.&quot; <br />
<br />
Noel then turned to address Alora &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I dont blame you in the slightest for this. and actually, I will need your help. You see, and I know Erika also knows this, but the way the two of us recover, is by having sex with our trainers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noel!! Shhh.&quot; Quickly said Erika. She had known this too, but wanted to not let Scott become privy to that little detail just yet. But now it was too late. Hearing that, Scott couldn&#39;thelp but cheer. &quot;Really? You are not messing with me right, man, er woman?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. She is telling you guys the truth&quot; reluctantly confirmed Erika.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah, that&#39;s awesome!&quot; <br />
<br />
A few people had now stopped to see what all the shouting was about. Seeing this, the group decided to change locations to a more private environment, and decided to just go to Erika&#39;s house since she had the largest private outdoor space to test their abilities out in without being interrupted or spied on by unwantwd onlookers.</p>
