<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How about making me part lion?&quot; Mike asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Jeff started typing into the computer. &quot;I don&#39;t see why not.&quot; He finished the sentence and then hit enter. The green progress bar loaded and then finished.<br />
<br />
Mike stared for a second. &quot;Did it work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You tell me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well--&quot; he was instantly cut off as a sharp pain ran through his body. Suddenly, every muscle and bone felt like it was on fire. His hand gripped the door frame, nails digging into the wall. They sharpened into claws, tearing several small holes into the walls. Golden fur started to replace the dark brown hair that covered the back of his hands and arms. It grew far thicker than it had ever been before. <br />
<br />
The bit of scruff that rounded his chin instantly started growing out more than he&#39;d ever had in his life. It was the same with the hair on his head. What he&#39;d always tried to keep fairly cropped and easy to manage had lengthened well past what he would have ever said that he wanted. The black color shifted more into a muddy brown as his beard and hair started to merge into more of a mane than a human hair style.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-fuck,&quot; he grumbled as he tore off a piece of the door. The depth of his voice had a significant more amount of gravel in it. Somehow sounding more commanding than Mike already was. Even though Mike was always a pretty big guy, he seemed to be getting even bigger. His broad shoulders and thick chest with an even thicker belly seemed to reshape itself more into a powerlifter&#39;s build than the overweight one he&#39;d been cultivating over the last few years. His rotund stomach pulled back in while his chest pushed out in front of him. His wide shoulders filled the football jersey he was wearing. Just looking at him, he looked imposing.<br />
<br />
But Mike continued to grow a bit taller. That might have been more because his heels were lifting off the ground and the front of his feet were turning into paws. Sharp nails erupted out of his sneakers completely tearing the shoes to shreds. His toes cracked as they molded themselves into something far taller and more round. The sharp nails dug into Jeff&#39;s carpet.<br />
<br />
&quot;F-fu-fuck...&quot; Mike moaned as his face began to stretch out in front of him. He continued to snap his mouth as his jaw continued to mold into more of a muzzle. His nose bent backwards and his nostrils flared out as his nose into more of a triangle. &quot;Fuck yeah,&quot; he began to run his hand over his throbbing dick that was leaking down into his jeans.<br />
<br />
A tail sprouted out from behind him. The long appendage whipped back and forth as he went over to a mirror. &quot;Fuck yeah!&quot; He flexed his arm watching the muscle bulge. His tail continued to swish back and forth excitedly as he continued to look over his body. &quot;This is awesome!&quot; he smiled flashing his sharp teeth at himself. &quot;But...&quot; Jeff looked up to see the smile fade. &quot;Can I really be king of the jungle? I&#39;m kind of small...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Small?&quot; Jeff tilted his head. He&#39;d never considered his dad small. At 6&#39; he was always in the top 15% of men in terms of height and his broad shoulders and thick chest made him hard to want to deal with. But now with his body always being on its tiptoes due to his paws he had to be 6&#39;2&quot; at least and his muscles just looked bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Small,&quot; Mike repeated. &quot;How bout you use that computer of yours to make me really stand out. Hmmm?&quot; he spun Jeff back to the computer and leaned in, watching the screen intently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Sure,&quot; Jeff said. He began typing. &#39;Mike is 6&#39;8&quot;--&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bigger,&quot; Mike commanded. His grip on the chair tightened. Jeff erased the &#39;8&#39; and put &#39;10&#39; &quot;Bigger,&quot; Mike breathed heavily. &#39;7&#39; 3&quot;,&#39; Jeff typed. Mike let out a hot breath onto the screen. &quot;Yeah...&quot; he moaned. <br />
<br />
&#39;Mike is 7&#39;3&quot; and weighs 400--&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;More,&quot; Mike commanded. <br />
<br />
&#39;500--&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;More.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;650&#39;<br />
<br />
Mike laughed happily. &quot;Perfect...&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Mike is 7&#39;3&quot; and weighs 650 pounds. He&#39;s avid about working out and staying as strong as possible.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww... Man, that sounds great. But make it so that I never stopped growing,&quot; Mike added. Jeff added the statement and Mike pat him on the head. &quot;Perfect,&quot; a low rumble of a growl rolled out of his throat as he touched himself.<br />
<br />
Jeff cautiously hit the enter button. A warmth ran through his body deep down inside each of Mike&#39;s muscles. Slowly, his body began growing. Muscle was building on top of muscle. Each group becoming far larger than they already had been. He stripped off his football jersey off to watch his chest balloon outwards. His massive hands groped his thick and meaty chest making sure to grab onto the massive mounds of muscle. Even if he didn&#39;t have a six pack, he didn&#39;t care. His hands ran down the firm belly coated in a bit of fat and dipped down into his pants.<br />
<br />
The tight jeans he was wearing molded into soft flexible shorts as his quads continued to grow. Just one of his legs was starting to be the same size as Jeff. His ass rounded out behind him and even in the loose fitting clothes, the globular sized ass cheeks were still easy to see. The shorts still held tightly again his body showing off damn near everything. His feet only continued to grow, supporting his already unbelievably large body even better. His toes slowly inched forward while his feet grew wider.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck yeah!&quot; Mike roared as he finished. A distinct wet spot was forming in his shorts as his shorts as he slowly came down from his high. &quot;Shit... That was awesome...&quot;</p>
