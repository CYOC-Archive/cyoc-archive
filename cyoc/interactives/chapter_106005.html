<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter Talbot stirred. Something wasn&#39;t quite right to his werelion senses.<br />
He rolled over in bed to discover a beautiful werelioness sleeping next to him, despite the fact he could of sworn he was alone when he retired for the night.<br />
He moved to identify who was with him, but was shocked to discover that it was none other but Karen Yuletide, now the werelioness of his dreams! Peter recalled Karen still being a normal human when he dropped her off in front of her dorm building, but now the woman was even more gorgeous than before! Beautiful blonde fur, sleek curves, a luscious tail...<br />
He started to say something when she awoke and stared at him. &quot;Morning my love. Feeling up to a little <i>breakfast in bed</i>?&quot; she asked, kissing him.<br />
Peter couldn&#39;t help returning the kiss, or the next one, or the kisses that followed.<br />
He still didn&#39;t understand what was going on when he heard his bedroom door open, but didn&#39;t see anyone enter the room.<br />
It wasn&#39;t until the intruder came closer to his bed that he saw two children. A black haired boy of about 6 and a blonde haired girl a few years younger.<br />
&quot;Look Petra. Mommy and daddy are furry again!&quot; exclaimed the boy, as both children jumped into bed to join them.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Lionel. When the time comes, you&#39;ll get your fur coat too,&quot; said Karen, hugging both kids in her furry arms. &quot;Isn&#39;t that right daddy?&quot; she asked Peter.<br />
DADDY? thought Peter, suddenly sitting upright within the darkened bedroom, alone.<br />
Keen lion eyes saw nothing in the shadows except the furniture and clothing that should be there.<br />
Puzzled, Peter laid his head back down on his pillow and stared at the ceiling, trying to figure things out until he finally drifted back to sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then Mister Anderson, Mister Ramsey. You do understand the importance of what you&#39;re about to sign. Correct?&quot; asked the man in the suit behind the desk.<br />
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; they said, shaking their heads affirmatively almost in unison.<br />
&quot;Okay then. Nate, I&#39;ll need your signature by the yellow post-it note flag pointers, and Alex, yours by the green ones,&quot; said the stranger.<br />
They briefly turned to look at each other. Nate&#39;s literary career was starting to take off. The local diner was doing great under Alex&#39;s management and cooking. The time was right.<br />
Without any further hesitation, they signed the documents.<br />
The other man took them and briefly looked over the paperwork before pushing a button on his phone.<br />
A moment later, a woman walked into the office escorting a little girl with her.<br />
&quot;Alice,&quot; began the man behind the desk. &quot;It&#39;s official. Meet your new daddies.&quot;<br />
With that, the girl ran over and started to joyously hug both of them...<br />
Alex Ramsey stirred and looked at the handsome werewolf in his furry arms.<br />
They had perched on the vantage point overlooking the lake, enjoying each other&#39;s company and love until they fell asleep in each other&#39;s grasp.<br />
As a huge smile formed on his muzzle, Alex briefly kissed his boyfriend before falling back asleep next to Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re doing well sister,&quot; said the dream image of how Jenny Harper looked before the rogue were-vixen Yvette Smith intentionally dragged her into were society.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re definitely getting stronger,&quot; added the dream image of how Jenny looked in her new fursona as a  beautiful were-vixen.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re getting stronger, but there&#39;s still a week before the wedding,&quot; old Jenny reminded her, even as she tried to reach out to touch furry Jenny. They could bring their hands closer now, but still could not actually touch each other yet.<br />
&quot;You still have to be careful around our father and brothers,&quot; pointed out furry Jenny. &quot;But most especially Dieter Wilhelm,&quot; she warned, as the three of them heard thunder roil across the dreamscape.<br />
&quot;But what about trying to save mom and sis?&quot; current Jenny asked her dream sisters.<br />
&quot;It&#39;d be nice if you can, but don&#39;t risk yourself or anyone else trying. It has to be their decision,&quot; the other two Jennys said together.<br />
With that, the furry werevixen that was now Jenny Harper started shaking in her sleep as her fiance Harry Jenkins held her closer within his werefox arms until she calmed down again.<br />
<br />
Eric Anderson awoke, a bit disoriented to find himself under water. Then seeing the beautiful were-mermaid Julie Stovall in his arms brought it all back to him.<br />
After their hot love making session in the bedroom section of the cabana, they had moved their activities to the fresh water swimming pool in the Stovall&#39;s backyard, exploring what it truly meant to be two young were-mers in love in all stages of transformation.<br />
Now Eric disentangled himself from his girlfriend/fiance to briefly surface and resume his human form so he could return to the cabana long enough to use the bathroom and collect a couple of things.<br />
Thoughts of Julie, as well as the children they would bring into the world and raise as a happy family, filled his heart and mind as he returned to the pool.<br />
Yet that happy and bright future they would have together did not officially start until after their wedding, he reminded himself, as Eric sat an unopened bottle of water and the prescription bottle with Julie&#39;s were-mermaid birth control pills by the edge of the pool.<br />
With it still being a couple of hours before dawn, Eric resumed his Stage 3 form: full merman tail and blue-green scales with matching webbing between his fingers as he reentered the water.<br />
He swam back down to the bottom of the deep end, wrapped his arms around the woman he loved, and fell back to sleep with Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can do it honey. PUSH!&quot; screamed Samantha Twist.<br />
The married lesbian werecat was standing behind her wife, wiping Doctor Frances Twist&#39;s sweaty bow even as she still wondered how they wound up like this.<br />
&quot;Honey,&quot; moaned Frances, reaching over her head for Samantha&#39;s hand.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here dear,&quot; said Samantha, grabbing it in hers.<br />
Then they both heard a slap, followed by a wail.<br />
&quot;Congratulations. It&#39;s a girl,&quot; the Twists heard the doctor say, as they welcomed a beautiful daughter and future werecat into the world. &quot;But despite all the test results, I still can&#39;t believe Samantha is the biological father,&quot; the doctor added, handing the new bundle of joy to a nurse to be cleaned up and registered.<br />
&quot;I keep telling everyone she is, but you still don&#39;t believe me?&quot; asked Frances.<br />
<i>WHAT THE FUCK?</i> wondered Samantha, waking up in her wife&#39;s furry arms. <i>I know Frances still wants to have our child someday, but that was just too weird for words,</i> she thought, before the werecat curled back to sleep with her mate; not knowing about the healer abilities Jenny Harper possesses that will make that dream a reality when the time is right.<br />
<br />
&quot;And so, by the power invested in me by the town of Moon Lake and Washington State, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride,&quot; said the preacher, as Benjamin Twist leaned over to kiss Kenya Adaeze Twist even as the werepanthress and the werewolf huddled closer in each others furry arms on the blanket in the forest where they fell asleep after their last passionate session of sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; screamed Martha Anderson in her werecat fursona. &quot;Harder! Faster! Deeper! Fuck me!&quot; she demanded, feeling the werefox top knot lodge deep into her cunt even as the vulpine penis it was attached to kept plunging in and out of her.<br />
The horny woman was on all fours, getting taken from behind and loving every moment of it, moving her body in rhythm, meeting thrust with thrust for the latest ride of her life.<br />
Martha knew she wouldn&#39;t last much longer as she started moaning louder, and soon screamed out &quot;I&#39;m coming!&quot; even as her body shook in orgasmic pleasure.<br />
When the last tremor finally subsided, Martha managed to twist around on the werefox penis to take her lover within her furry arms.<br />
&quot;You were great!&quot; she told Douglas Hale, as the werecat and werefox started passionately kissing until they could fuck again, even as they heard Douglas&#39; wife and werevixen Dawn Hale enjoy Martha&#39;s husband and werefox William Anderson nearby.<br />
With that, Martha awoke and looked around. She was still within her husband&#39;s furry arms, his werefox rod where it belonged between her legs, although it finally slipped out from their last love making experience. Nearby, the Hales were cuddled and asleep together, although Martha didn&#39;t know the status of Douglas&#39; cock in Dawn&#39;s pussy.<br />
The two couples had spent happy hours in the shaded forest grove. Each woman fucking their mates like crazy when they weren&#39;t enjoying lesbian sex with each other.<br />
But no matter how much the Hales tried to hint at it, let alone William and she discussed it privately, Martha still couldn&#39;t bring herself to take that final plunge at a true orgy and let Douglas fuck her while Dawn and William had sex together.<br />
<i>Our marriage is healed at last since we&#39;ve both become weres, and I&#39;m happy after finally acknowledging I&#39;m bi. Maybe someday we&#39;ll fully open it like Douglas and Dawn have theirs, but while I&#39;m now prepared to start sharing my women with William when the time and opportunity are right, I&#39;m still just not ready to have sex with another man yet. Maybe someday...</i> Martha thought, briefly looking at Douglas before she laid her feline head back on William&#39;s foxy chest fur and fell back to sleep in his loving arms.</p>
