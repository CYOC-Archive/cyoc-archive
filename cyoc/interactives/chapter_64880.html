<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Poppy, Pops and Sandy arrive on the Carnival and Big Top Circus. They see Jen, Mark-O, Blink, Twink, Deen-Deen, LuLu, Petunia and Jellypie, all ready for the fun on the circus. Sandy runs to LuLu and Mark-O and starts to talk and giggles.<br />
&quot;So, Poppy, Pops have a job now.&quot;, said Petunia.<br />
&quot;Indeed. I just expect he will stay here and settle himself down. You know... I love him: he's funny and you can't say he isn't a hard worker. I believe that now that he said goodbye for the booze, maybe he'll behave himself.&quot;<br />
Pops looked around for his friends when...<br />
&quot;Pops! Guy, you look well.&quot; said a sandy haired guy.<br />
&quot;Ryan! I don't know you like circus.&quot;<br />
&quot;Neither me. But the girls are hot here.&quot; Pops knows Ryan from his drinking nights: he wasn't a bad guy like Josh. He is a hard worker guy on construction and he's very well mannered and not a addicted on alcohol like Pops was. In fact, Ryan was so much times the one who leaved Pops on Poppy's door when he was drunk. He had only one fault: he's a womanizer, a Don Juan that slept with a new woman either day. Except this, even Poppy liked Ryan a lot, which explain Ryan being Sandy's godfather.<br />
Ryan smelled Pops: &quot;So, Poppy made you bathe again, nah? Yesterday you was drunk as a skunk, and as smelly as one. I don't think she'll leave you go out with just a shower.&quot; Ryan said, smiling.<br />
&quot;Yep, but no more booze for me. You see, sometimes a man needs to settle down, have a work and wife and kids. Freeloader's life is good, but a true man can't live as freeloader forever.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, no more poker nights and NFL and NHL and NASCAR? The guys'll miss you.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't think Poppy will forbid me a little poker. You know how good I am. NASCAR and so on... Maybe, without drinking and being a hard worker and good husband and pops, I'll can buy a HDTV and cable.I don't think Poppy would forbid it.And the money I lost drinking will have a good use.&quot;<br />
&quot;You thinking on everything, nah, Pops? That's the guy I know.&quot;<br />
&quot;But I still say: leaving my hoodlums days was the best thing I had done until now. You should give a try: stop drinking and womanizing and settle down yourself.&quot;<br />
&quot;No chance at all. I tried it before.&quot;<br />
&quot;Maybe I can help you!&quot; Pops said, the chance ready and the idea on his mind. &quot;Transformation or dare?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, c'mon, Pops? Do you think I believe all these curse mumbo-jumbo?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, it's up for you, but choose soon, or it'll be both.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, so it's both.&quot; Ryan said, smiling &quot;I know you're joking. You're really a laugh, Pops.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm not joking, but I think you'll like this. For transformation you'll be also a clown, and have a full knowledge of practical and impractical jokes, and everyone will think this is normal. For everyone, you was always a clown. You'll also have all cartoon physics. But you'll be a hobo clown, like me, although a little auguste-ish. As a hobo, you know you're the underdog of the clowns, so you could not be mean with others. But you'll be a happy hobo and you'll like to make people happy. You'll be specially adept in card tricks and in card cheats, but you'll never cheat in serious games, as you cheat for the laugh, not for profit.<br />
For dare you will try and Transform or Dare friends. If they pick transform, you will make them into clowns for their transformation. If they pick dare, you will dare them to try Transformation and Dare their friends, and give them the same T &amp; D I'm giving you until now. And if they pick both, you' ll give them both. And there more on your dare: First, you'll no more drink booze. Two, you'll turn our drinking friends on hobos and daring them to no more drinking, like I'm daring you. And you'll settle down yourself and being no more a womanizer. You'll stay romantic and attractive and you'll find a good woman and maybe T&amp;D her into a good clown wife. And you'll be a happy husband and father.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay, okay ... So, now, how about.. Heeheehee... What's... Hahahaaahaaa!&quot;<br />
Ryan starts to feel yourself funny, but a little afraid: &quot;My god, so it's truth, the curse... Hoohoohoo!&quot;  His belly shakes as he goes chubby. Her skin goes a little sunburnt, but with a reddish hue, opposed to dark blue black from Pops. Her chin covered with a day beard and her muzzle turned white with a little red circling it. Wrinkles filling her forehead, as white shows around his eyes and the top of his hair falls down. The rest of his hear turns ginger and curled, as the a maroon bowler shows up over his bald top. His suit turns maroon with patches all around, his pants supported by leathery suspenders. His underpants turns on fiery red boxers. Maroon colored clown shoes shows over his feet, very worn and a little tattered. Below his suit jacket this white shirt turns a little worn and tattered, as fingerless gloves shows in his hands. A bowtie, maroon as over his all clothes, as big as cover all his neck, almost framing his face. Her nose start to swell into a clown nose, flash toned with a dark red hue.<br />
&quot;My God! Pops, I'm turning into a clown...&quot; Ryan says, but it too late, as his memories and knowledge are changed to a clownie one. A 4-leaf clover appears on the top of his bowler and some big playing cards can be shown on his pants pockets. A volume on them shows that there's also playing card decks.<br />
Pops goes and HONK!!! Ryan nose:<br />
&quot;Heya, Pops! Do you thing it's so funny honks others' noses?&quot;<br />
&quot;Happee, you were stared there as a mummy!&quot; says Pops to Ryan, now Happee &quot;Whatcha should I done?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don't know, but not squeezing others' noses like grapefruit!&quot; says Happee, faux-indignantly.<br />
&quot;Sorry... It's just you stayed there staring to God-knows-where, and I need to wake you up!&quot;<br />
&quot;I just was thinking on what you said about quit drinking. You right. No more booze for me also! Neither hot woman! It's good, but no more for me. I'm in time to settle somewhere and make family. Do you know that Julia girl from bar?&quot;<br />
&quot;I know... The red haired? You like ginger, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yep... Irish blood, what can I do?&quot; said Happee &quot;I think she'll came here and maybe I could ask him marry... I have some money from work and can make some bucks on poker.&quot;<br />
&quot;You cheat again yesterday, Happee?&quot;<br />
&quot;No cheat, just luck.&quot; he points the 4-leaf clover. &quot;You'll need to born again to beat Happee here on poker.&quot; he laughs.<br />
&quot;Why you...&quot; said Pops, as he looks over the clock &quot;My god! It's time for show! I expect you and Julia engage soon... I need to go, before Poppy came here and take me by the ears!&quot;<br />
Pops goes, as Happee waits Julia came...</p>
