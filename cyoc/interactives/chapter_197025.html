<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s POV:<br />
Jeff was led into a large foyer that had around 12-14 people in it, seemingly waiting for him. Kayla was in tow, being silent, which Jeff was grateful for.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Mr. Good, there are two teams assembled, one dedicated to monitoring your health and safety while ensuring certain physical expectations are reached. The other will evaluate the effects of the mental conditioning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; a woman in the back piped up. She was the only one not wearing a lab coat. &quot;I&#39;m actually here specifically for the girl, so I&#39;ll take her and we will leave you to... all this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see each other soon,&quot; Jeff reassured her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, at dinner,&quot; one of the doctors chimed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get things started, you&#39;ll have plenty of time to answer and ask questions as we go along.&quot; The group made its way into an operating room and they made quick work of Jeff&#39;s general measurements original date of birth the medical team was all a buzz discussing goals and target attainment. One man unwrapped Jeff&#39;s bandage, flushed the existing port, and attached a new IV.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t mind them, they are figuring out where they expect you to end up, but this... this will get you started. The first IV has had time to work into your system and this will be working off of that. One of the most easily noticed traits of male adulthood is hair. Facial and body. Men can be of wildly varying heights, weights, builds, the deepness of their voice, but if someone has a beard shadow or something more substantial, instinct is to think they are a man. This cocktail will also push you into a growth spurt later in the week, and your voice should drop soon. You&#39;ll notice your testicles will start swelling within a couple of hours, this is a prohormone slurry which means we are going to make your body do all the work for us. The first externally noticeable effects will show up as early as tomorrow morning or midday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your voice might start cracking or drop, and you&#39;ll start developing facial and body hair. It&#39;s important we get that started right away because it grows as fast as your hair follicles are programmed to grow. Nutrient creams might help a tiny bit but you aren&#39;t going to wake up tomorrow with a beard, but by end of the week, you&#39;d be able to grow one if you wanted. All in all this process should be smooth aside from some literal growing pains.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On that note.&quot; Someone from the other team interrupted. &quot;We have some questions surrounding the first neural upload... what do you remember of the procedure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was drugged. Something was in my mouth and then I woke up and the IV was done.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;There is a tiny bit of flexibility in some packages surrounding personal preferences and hobbies. What would you like to enjoy doing when you have free time? Examples may be playing or watching sports, a musical instrument, DIY home improvement type things...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can make me like things?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kind of. We can make you informed on a topic, and then we can make you remember engaging in that activity and liking it. Will you like it the next time you do it? Probably. You&#39;d feel excitement leading up to it. You&#39;d feel comfortable doing it, and you&#39;d feel proud of the accomplishment or camaraderie with other people who engage in the same thing. We can come back to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I like the idea of being self-sufficient. Make me my own handyman type of person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it. As you may have pieced together, Your new identity is going to be Aaron Jacob Good, your daughter is going to be Kayla Elizabeth Good, and honestly, the rest of the process will just need you to not fight. You will pick up new skills and habits as we upload. It may not all stick but let&#39;s be honest, adults don&#39;t remember everything either. The footage of you walking here gives us a solid indication that the process is working. Sometimes through this process, you may think of Kayla as your sister, other times your daughter, but by the end, your new life should feel entirely normal. Let&#39;s see, mentally you are around 18 now, let&#39;s give you some of that cultural knowledge you&#39;d have if you were twice your age. You&#39;d raise some eyebrows without it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um sure...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kayla&#39;s POV:<br />
The woman took Kayla into a cozy office space, nicely decorated but not personalized. She made sure Kayla understood what was happening to Jeff, described what the plan is, and then focused the conversation on her. &quot;Now that we are on the same page of what&#39;s happening and what the goal is. The best way you can help is by not confusing him when treatment is done. Over the next few days, his mind will be given a whole new history which will include your birth, raising you as a single parent, planning and taking you on vacations in the summer, helping you with your schoolwork, and so on. Once he has gone through this process, he will look, sound, and think like any other man of similar age. He may be wanting a mate and to grow the family, he may make friends at work and drink with them. What he needs from you, is to not be reminded that he&#39;s really just a sixteen-year-old Frankenstein made with drugs and brain tech.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, he did accept these consequences but his options were greatly reduced, if he is reminded that this is all an orchestration he may become unsure of himself or worse yet, depressed over what he gave up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that doesn&#39;t mean that you have to feel good about the situation. You can feel angry, scared, happy, excited, anything at all, and that&#39;s okay and entirely understandable and you can talk about it here. My strong recommendation is that you take advantage of any time you can get with him. Keeping the details of who you are alive in his mind with help both of you with the transition. He probably doesn&#39;t know your favorite tv show or flavor of ice cream but with your help, this is an opportunity to make him the best dad a girl could ask for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kayla&#39;s eyes twinkled as she realized she isn&#39;t going to be dealing with her brother acting like her father, she&#39;s going to have a father who used to be her brother. Fear, hope, relief, and nervousness washed over her in waves and she finally let feelings the feelings that had been shoved down since 10 minutes after she woke up, out.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later Kayla and the woman were chatting up a storm about all her favorite things, the color to paint her room, what extracurricular activities she wanted to be a part of, a favorite game they love to play together, the things Kayla cannot stand, all of which would be loaded into her dad.</p>
