<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff could hear three voices entering the room at the same time and quickly identified them as his mother and both of his sisters. He heard a shriek from his younger sister as she saw the giant member on the bed, followed by laughter.<br />
<br />
“The fuck is this? My brotha’s a fucking assboy?” laughed Janine, hardly able to contain her amusement at what appeared to be the huge dildo on the bed.<br />
<br />
“Damn, I wouldn’t’ve pegged the boy as a pansy!” his mom exclaimed, more entertained than anything.<br />
<br />
Hosanna wasn’t as taken aback. “Whatever, some niggas like dick. I get it!” Her comment only elicited a more jovial response from her other family members.<br />
<br />
While all of this was going on, the Chronivac was still operating in the background. With Jeff stuck as a giant penis, he didn’t have the vital systems to keep himself alive, and the Chronivac was designed to prevent accidental death in mind, however, due to the nature of the package he selected on becoming another person’s body part, the device had entered a conflict between restoring Jeff and attaching him to someone else. The device had to reach a compromise as its coding forced it to come to a conclusion.<br />
<br />
What this meant in practice for Jeff first was that he felt a horrible splitting pain as he laid there on the bed. He couldn’t see what was going on as a penis, but aside from the pain felt movement over the bed. What his family experienced was quite different, as they turned towards the bed and saw the hefty penis duplicating itself to make three copies of the large throbbing member on the bed. Of course, these other copies weren’t sentient like the Jeff penis was.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s sisters and mother weren’t able to react to this though, as the Chronivac had gained control of them in its feedback loop. The three were none the wiser at the fact that in a blink, they were naked and standing neutrally in the room, almost as if waiting for something to happen.<br />
<br />
The force emitted by the Chronivac didn’t make that waiting take very long though as the three truly inanimate penises rose up from the bed, basically levitating, and zoomed at the women’s crotches, fusing to their skin over their vaginas. All three women let out a moan as their bodies made contact with their new members. Jeff, on the bed, was confused as hell despite being thankful that the pain was over. From his perspective, the weight on the bed had shifted again and then he heard moans from his family members. What the hell was going on?<br />
<br />
Of course, the Chronivac wasn’t content to leave the rest of the family as penis women, and was rapidly making adjustments one by one to the ladies in the room. Jeff’s mother was first up for the device as she suddenly shot up in height from 5’4 to an average male height of 5’8. She shuffled awkwardly around as her body proportions shifted, bigger feet and hands, thicker arms and legs, getting used to the large dick swinging under her groin. Her breasts shrank within her body as they formed pectoral muscles, boobs becoming lean muscle. Her abs followed suit, a six pack visibly on her ebony skin.<br />
<br />
Perhaps more dramatic were the changes to her head, as an Adam’s apple made an appearance on her neck, and her face started to shift to take on a more masculine appearance. Her face remained clean shaven, with the exception of a thick and bushy mustache above her lips, which were no longer made up with lipstick. The rest of the makeup on her face had also entirely vanished. The hair on her head started to furl inwards as the individual strands grew kinkier and lost the dye that was in them, forming a neat afro. Her, no, his transformation was complete as Jeff’s dad Xavier found himself dressed in a pair of basketball shorts and a stringer, with big basketball shoes and high socks on his feet.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac then turned its programming to the younger sister, Jasmine. Unlike her now father, Jasmine’s changes started at the head as her hair begin to fall out in clumps by itself, disappearing as it made contact with her body or the floor. Soon, she was displaying a chrome dome to the world. Her face grew thicker and more manly in shape by the second, as it aged to an appearance matching a man in his early forties.<br />
<br />
The only thing missing was facial hair, and it quickly began to make an appearance on Jasmine as her face erupted in a giant beard, obscuring her mouth and rising high on her cheeks. Her face wasn’t the only part of her body though which grew hairier, as all over he started to grow hair everywhere that it was possible. Soon, her boobs were covered in hair which was in a pelt going down to her groin, where an enormous bush was growing around her dick. Her legs, arms, and ass all grew hairy as well.<br />
<br />
Jasmine looked very out of place as a petite girl with an aged, manly face and a hairy body. This was quickly corrected though as her body began to grow large: her stature grew to 6’6 and thick. Her arms and legs grew wide, and her ass stuck out. Her boobs shrank down, but were replaced by a fairly hefty chest and gut – Jasmine in her new form was by no means fat, but her barrel chest and large gut were clearly mixed from working out and enjoying good meals. <br />
<br />
No one on Earth would look at Jasmine and mistake her for a woman anymore, as memories rewrote themselves for Jamal, Jeff’s other dad. Clothing manifested on him, a tailored three piece suit, with a smart watch on his wrist and a pair of oxford shoes on his feet. Jamal’s skin darkened even further to a deep ebony as he was the adoptive father of his two children. Possessed by the Chronivac, Jamal subconsciously wandered over to his husband and draped his arm around Xavier, reaching his hand into his stringer and giving his nipple a pinch. Xavier, though otherwise spaced out, felt the stimulation from his husband’s contact as new memories of the two meeting in their youth and living a wonderful life together replaced old ones of being mother and daughter.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac was hardly finished though, as it focused its efforts on Hosanna. In this new life with more successful parents, Hosanna did not have to resort to being a hoe anymore, and it was reflecting on her body as the jewelry and tattoos faded out of existence on her body. Hosanna’s hair grew short and kinky in the same way that Xavier’s did, but pulled even closer to her head, leaving her with a close cropped haircut of kinky curls. Unlike her parents, Hosanna’s changes were alternating between various parts of her body, almost like watching a cartoon.<br />
<br />
Her dainty feet grew large and mannish, followed by a breast reduction to a fairly skinny state, followed by masculinization of the face. With every change, Hosanna was going from a glamorous woman to a fairly unremarkable looking man. Unlike her fathers, Hosanna wasn’t growing especially muscular, the Chronivac instead opting to leave her in a skinny form. By no means did Hosanna look nerdy though, as his face took on a clean complexion and a smart goatee grew around his mouth.<br />
<br />
New memories swirled into Hosanna’s head as clothing started to appear on him. A green polo shirt and a pair of khakis made their appearance on his body, with a pair of gray chukka shoes on his feet. A pair of glasses appeared on Homer’s head, as his vision adjusted to them. The sheer amount of reading that the chemistry grad student had to complete had taken its toll on his vision, but he knew that his hard work would pay off in many other ways.<br />
<br />
With his family fully transformed into men based off clones of the penile Jeff, the Chronivac only had one task left, and that was restoring Jeff to a form where he would be able to live again. The Chronivac, knowing that his family consisted of two fathers now, randomly selected one of them to be the new Jeff’s father, and it selected Jamal. The penis on the bed, still erect and confused, grew several shades darker to match his biological father’s genetics.<br />
<br />
The changes were very peculiar for Jeff, as he suddenly realized that he was gaining his senses other than hearing and perception again, as he could suddenly see some blurriness in the room. The growth of the person from the penis was grotesque, as Jeff maintained his penis size and length, but was essentially growing a person out of it. It was also exhausting, and as Jeff finally grew back to his old self, albeit with a new member, he found himself laying on the bed.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac had other ideas though as he was forced to sit on the edge of the bed. Unlike his family members, Jeff knew that something was wrong and that the Chronivac was forcing him to undergo some changes. He felt a throbbing sensation from his penis, as it grew harder than before. Like his biological dad Jamal, a big bush of pubic hair started growing above his cock which expanded to his chest and limbs, though not as dense or long as his fathers. His body gained some muscular weight as his limbs and spine expanded, giving him extra height.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a splitting headache as his body conformed to this new reality, his hairstyle changing to a clean fade and a thick chin goatee growing on his face. Like his other family members, clothing started to appear on him. A jockstrap grew over his cock, which felt nice over it, and a pair of basketball shorts over it. A jersey for the Toronto Raptors with one of their star players formed over his torso, and a cap with the teams logo plopped itself on his head. A pair of socks and basketball shoes formed over his feet.<br />
<br />
Jeff was so horny and could no longer hold it in as his throbbing member finally erupted, with several loads of jizz creaming his jockstrap. As Jeff came, new memories filled in his mind of his family: his brother and his dads. New memories of his life, being a freshman student at a college on the basketball team. New memories of his boyfriend, Jace, and how his family loved him. As he finally stopped cumming, Jeremiah noticed his family standing in his room.<br />
<br />
He was only mortified for a second, as he realized that his jockstrap was dry and that he didn’t have a hardon, quickly forgetting about everything that had happened. Everything unusual faded away as Jeff forgot his time as a cock and about the Chronivac entirely, just having a conversation with his brother and his two dads, jovially getting along as a family.</p>
