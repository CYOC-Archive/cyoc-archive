<br />
Beach Weekend<br />
<br />
It had been almost a week since Rob had joined the group.  At this point he almost never tripped on his own feet any more and hadn’t poured anything down his front all day.  Like an average teenager in a growth spurt, his body didn’t always operate the way he expected it would.  The extra 4 inches (mainly in his legs and arms), the change in weight, new center of gravity and muscle had taken some getting use to.  But with the running (something that he now truly enjoyed), working at the gym with Peter, Dustin and once Ty, and trying to do the gymnast strength training routine from a book by former Olympic gymnast Mitch Gaylord, he was quite comfortable in his teenage body now.  And he could even press a handstand and do a couple of freestanding pushups.  “Life is good…” something he would not have said a week ago.  Before his chance encounter with Peter, Rob had been a short overweight 50 year old trying desperately to get in shape with little success.  He had been working for a company that owed him 6 months of back pay.  Now he was a teenager again with the body he would have sold his soul for, good-looking, lean, tightly muscled and athletic. And he had friends, people that actually seemed to like him for himself and not for what he could do for them.  Peter and Ty could do just about anything at the blink of an eye so no one really needed anything.  For the first time that he could remember, Rob actually liked himself and felt truly happy to be alive.<br />
<br />
Ty, Peter, Dustin, Ryan and Rob are looking for something to do.  None of them the others had much homework as none of their teachers want to start any thing new in the couple of weeks between the end of the Thanksgiving break and the start of the Christmas break just the have to start from scratch again after New Year’s.  So the guy’s were planning a little weekend trip while most of the rest of the world was busy with shopping, Dustin and Rob wanted to go somewhere warm and sunny with a beach and good diving.  Rob had done some SCUBA diving in his previous life and Dustin wanted to give it a try and both wanted to catch some “rays” and maybe meet a couple of girls.  Ryan like the 9yo he really is inside wanted to go to an amusement park   After some debate everyone decides that a weekend at the beach for some fun in the sun would neat.  Dustin and the rest would get to have Rob introduce them all to diving and Dustin would show Rob how to pick up girls and other of the “finer points” in the art of being a teen stud.  Rob still needed the chance to get use to dealing with the world as the teen hunk Peter had made him.  After a bit of searching on the Internet they found the perfect location good beach, great diving and an amusement park for Ryan.  Reservations are made and the gang would leave right after school on Friday.<br />
<br />
They all go their rooms to pack… when Rob got to his room he realizes that he had a problem.  He didn’t have any thing to pack.  It had only been a few of days since Peter had morphed him into the studly teen that stood looking back at him from the dresser mirror, dressed only in the now very baggy cargo shorts and cross trainers he had been wearing at the Gym when Peter had granted his wish for a new start.  None of his old clothes remotely fit the compact muscular teen, so they were left at his old apartment.  Since then the only place he had been was the gym and he had worn gym shorts and a tank top Dustin had loaned him.  He remembered Dustin insisting he not wear the old cargo shorts and t-shirt to the gym and tossing him the shorts and shirt saying,  “So you look more like the stud you are… and they will shows off that body for the gym bunnies and you might get lucky.” Dustin then gave him a big grin and a playful punch and added in a mock conspiratorial whisper, “It’s nice to have another ‘normal’ dude in the group.”  The rest of the time around the house or while take a good run through the neighbor hood, Rob hadn’t worn a shirt very much preferring to see, feel and show off his muscular chest and chiseled abs.  He was the guy he had always dreamt of being but could never even come close to achieving.<br />
<br />
So Rob goes to talk to Peter and finds that Dustin has already realized Rob’s wardrobe problem and had gone to talk to Peter too…  They talked about it. Rob is a reluctant to impose on Dustin any further and did not really feeling comfortable with Dustin’s tastes, tending toward the more extreme.  Peter understands but he and Dustin remind Rob that he needs to loosen up… that he’s not the 50yo guy anymore and that dressing the part of a “jockish teen stud” will help him adjust to the new Rob… and Peter adds “I really had considered this… when I morphed you I made your clothing sizes match Dustin or me so you wouldn’t need to worry about clothes for now.  We can loan you some, until you have had a chance to workout who the new Rob is in your own mind.”  So the three pick out a couple of outfits for Rob…<br />
<br />
Friday comes and the guys gather in the living room for the trip.  To avoid the long line at airport security and generally save time Peter and Ty “ZAP” the gang to an alleyway near the hotel.  They quick walk there and get checked into the hotel… Reluctantly Ryan is shrunk by Peter to be a more manageable size… hotel rooms and scuba gear for 25ft people being in short supply and Peter has to remind Ryan that at 25ft tall he wouldn’t be able to go on any of the rides at the amusement park…  Rob makes arrangement for the scuba gear and a boat to be ready for them early the next morning.  Then they grab some dinner where Rob gives the guys a quick briefing on what to do and not to do when using scuba.  After which they all take Ryan to the amusement park for a couple of hours at which point they were all getting tired, so they headed back to the hotel to made it an early night to be well rested for the morning.<br />
<br />
The morning comes and after a quick breakfast the crew heads for the boat and Rob takes then to a small strip of beach near what is suppose to be a little know but great dive site for beginner divers… They beach the boat and get out and do a quick, hands on, Scuba 101 class and do a few practice dives to be sure everyone is comfortable in the water and with the gear.  Once everyone appears to be able to handle himself in the water, they climb back in the boat and head over to the dive site.  GPS is great they anchor the boat at the coordinates Rob was given and everyone hits the water.  The site is more spectacular than the shop owner indicated it would be.   A beautiful live coral head 20ft below the water surrounded by a plain of sand and smaller coral heads, 40 to 60 feet deep, all alive with various types of hard and soft corals, small swarms of brightly colored fish and other sea life… in every way the ideal dive site… The guys spend several hours and two air tanks each exploring the reef, being careful not to touch the coral or kick up the sand as that could damage the delicate balance of the eco-system.<br />
<br />
After being out for nearly 6 hour they head back to turn in the boat and dive gear.  After which Ryan convinces Peter the take him to the amusement park again and Ty, Dustin and Rob choose to catch some “rays” and scope out the sights on the beach.  Rob intends to wear his baggy cargo shorts but Dustin talks him into a pair of Speedos similar to what he had decided to wear.  So the three hit the beach… Rob is totally embarrassed by the idea of walking around in public with less cover than his underwear provided.  But after a while he had to admit, Dustin was right Speedos were the rule on this beach and he now had a body that looked great in them.  So he starts to relax a bit.  After a walk up and down the beach to get the “lay of the land” they staked a claim to a “well placed” patch of sand and setup camp.  Ty having worn a pair of board shorts and a tank top was the only one with pockets, and therefore cash on him, so they send him off in search of some cold drinks.  Meanwhile Dustin and Rob settle in for some serious rays.   <br />
<br />
After laying there for a while, Dustin with an MP3 player feeding tunes into his earphone and Rob listening to a audio book, a dark shadow slides across the sun and hangs there.  The sweaty studs open their eyes. And see than a pair of very attractive, bikini clad girls are blocking the sun as they gaze down at the pair of hunks.  Dustin is instantly on his feet, dragging Rob up with him.  Dustin introduces himself and Rob to the girls while subtly flexing to show off his muscles.  The girls introduce themselves as Kelly and Jenny.  And they chat for a while… The girls had seen the guys when they had strolled the beach earlier and had hope they might come back that way but guys hadn’t and Kelly and Jenny were heading back to their hotel when had come across Dustin and Rob stretched out on the sand.  They chat more and decide to meet to do some clubbing that evening.  About this time Ty wanders back with the drinks. And he is introduced and brought up to speed.  The guys ask if the girls happen to know someone to go with Ty.  They don’t and Ty suggest that he would just as soon hang with Peter and Ryan at the amusement park.  So Dustin Rob and the girls make plans to meet for dinner and to hit a few clubs… and the girls leave and go back to their hotel and the guys spend a couple more hours soaking up the sun and head back to the hotel.  <br />
<br />
After a shower and change of clothes Dustin and Rob head over to pick up the girls at their hotel, and Ty, Peter and Ryan head to the amusement park.  But after an hour or so Ty gets bored and decides to hit some clubs on his own.  In the course of the evening Ty happen to come across Dustin, Rob and the girls and decides to tag along but stay out of sight.  As Ty watches, Kelly and Jenny start to be affectionate with Dustin and Rob who’s hormones think that is just great as would any studly male teen and respond in kind.  This gives Ty an idea to have some laughs at the expense of his brother and his buddy.  So he wishes that Dustin and Rob would get younger the longer and more intense any display of affection becomes.  After awhile, the two couples decide to take a moon light stroll on the beach.  As Ty follows them he can see that both of two studs are already a bit shorter and less muscular then they were at the start of the evening.  <br />
<br />
Eventually Dustin with Jenny and Rob with Kelly wander apart and sit down in the sand for a bit of more serious snuggling.  Quickly the girls have got both guy’s shirts off and are stroking their pec’s and running their finger tips around their chiseled abs and soon pull them down for a deep almost lustful open mouth kiss… exactly what Ty had expected would happen.  And Dustin and Rob slide from being a pair of well-muscled 14-15 year olds to slightly chubby prepubescent 12 year olds a shift that both felt in an instant.  They could both hear someone laughing uncontrollably and Dustin recognized that laugh.  “Ty!!! Just wait till I get my hands on you!!!”  It was Dustin but at least an octave higher then his normal baritone.  And Rob understands what had just happened to him.  The first time he had been alone with a girl that wanted his body and it’s ripped away from him.  And he is enraged.  The two boys jump up and run top speed at Ty who is still laughing.  The now pre-teens each grab one of Ty’s arms pinning him to the ground and demand that Ty put them back the way they were.  Ty still laughing tells the pair that he had done them a favor by saving them from their own hormones, pointing out that the girls must have been a bit sluttish to be willing to go as far as they did with guys they had just met and if he hadn’t stopped it them might have gotten something more then they wanted.  And Ty added that they were really not in a position to be making demands.  The former studs tighten their grip on Ty and repeat their demands.  Ty chuckle and says, “Don’t say I didn’t warn you” and Dustin and Rob now find themselves in the bodies of 6 year olds and Ty shakes the pair little kids from his arms and stands up and leaves Dustin and Rob laying in the sand, still sort of wearing the clothes they had left their hotel in as teen muscle boys<br />
<br />
Dustin and Rob pull themselves together and collect their shirts, shoes and other affects that a this point where strewn across the beach between where they had be with the girls, that were now no where to be seen, and where they had foolishly confronted Ty.  The pair both realized the futility of their actions against Ty.  “What was I thinking,” said Dustin to no one in particular.  Rob responded, “I’ve never reacted like that before... just like an impulsive teenage jock.”  He shakes his head and with a sheepish sick grin says, “I am or was a teen jock… may be Ty had a point we were listening to our hormones and not our brains.”  Dustin sighs, “Well maybe, but what do we do now?”  “Well.” Rob said, “I don’t see that we have much of a choice but to go back to the hotel and hope that Peter and Ryan have gotten back and get him to put us back or we can try to catch up with Ty and apologize.”  “We can’t go chasing after Ty dressed like this.” Dustin says and throws up his hands, releasing his pants that promptly fall to his ankles.  “Agreed,” says Rob as he tries to find a way to cinch his belt down enough to keep his pants at his waist.  “We should get back up to the street and flag down a cab to take us back to the hotel.”  And Rob starts to search for his wallet with out finding it… “I can’t find my wallet Dustin.”  And Dustin feels for his wallet but can’t find it either…They quickly search the area and find the two wallets empty of cash twenty or thirtyfeet from were they had been sitting with the girls along the path the girls had used to leave the area.  “They were going to roll us” Dustin whines.  Rob replies, “I’d have to say that they did.  With a little help from Ty… but then again neither of us got hurt… so Ty may have done us a favor, even if it wasn’t quite what he had in mind.”  “So what are we going to do now, without cash we can’t take a cab?” whined Dustin.  “No we can’t” replied Rob. “We’re going to have to hike back and in these bodies it’s going to be a long one and in our bare feet because at this size our shoes are worthless.”  Dustin starts to whine again but Rob cuts him off, “Come on Dustin, snap out of it, your 17 inside and you’re acting like you really are 6 years old.  We have a problem but it’s nothing we can’t handle if we use our heads. We have a long walk ahead of us so let do what we can to make our clothes more serviceable and get started.”  They rip the excess length off their pant legs and shirtsleeves.  They manage to cinch their pant waists down enough to keep them from falling off.   And start walking back to the hotel. <br />
<br />
Ty finally make it back to the hotel and expects to find Dustin and Rob waiting and possibly already returned to normal by Peter. But Ty is the first back to their room and he becomes concerned that leaving Dustin and Rob on the other side of town as preschoolers might not have been a good idea.  And he wishes the pair back into their studly bodies.  <br />
<br />
Peter and Ryan return from the amusement park and Peter puts Ryan straight to bed because Ryan was exhausted from spending the day as a “normal” kid.  After a while Dustin and Rob stumble into the room, dressed in the tatters of what had been Dustin’s good club clothes and barefoot. Both Peter and Ty are surprised by the state of the pair.  Peter exclaims, “What happened to the two of you, you look awful.”  The pair scowl at Ty from a moment and Rob tells Peter, “We did a couple of stupid things and ended up getting ripped off by the girls we met on the beach this afternoon… we’re ok and neither of us got hurt… but it’s a long story and we really don’t want to talk about it right now.”  And Dustin chimes in, “Maybe later we can all have a good laugh about it but not now.”  Both Peter and Ty look a bit confused and Ty at the same time relieved.  Peter senses that some thing had gone on between Dustin and Rob, and Ty but didn’t look any deeper at it since no one wanted to involve him in the matter.  <br />
