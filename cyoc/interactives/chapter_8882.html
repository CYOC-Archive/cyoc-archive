<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kelvin patted his full gut, what a pig out! Sliver had done them proud- not one of them looked anything like they where less than stuffed. He grinned at Tim and they touched hands under the table. Kelvin caught Henry watching them and smiled at the boy. He was way way too young for Kelvin’s taste- maybe if he filled out to be as large and hairy as his dad then………Kelvin became aware of the familiar pressure in his bladder.<br />
“Gotta go piss” he whispered to Tim then got up and left the table. <br />
<br />
The toilets were well decorated he noted as he entered, then a strange smell hit him- familiar somehow. He took deep breaths as he walked into the spacious bathroom. What was that smell, it was making his dick tingle……one of the booth doors was shut and Kelvin paid it no mind as he walked to the urinal. He pulled out his massive cock and let loose all the while trying to place the annoying smell. Finished he shook and put his monster member away reluctantly- it was still amazing to him how big it was, how big *he* was now- and what he could do. He smiled to himself, since he was more or less alone he allowed himself a little shift- not much, just a little change, a bit of muscle, fur and the Bear mask. Kelvin felt himself bulk, the shirt pulling tight over his barrelling torso, his jeans tightening round his legs, the tingle of fur growing across his body. He wanted to get hard and wank off right here in front of the wall of mirrors- he rubbed himself and smiled a fanged grin at the semi-Bear shaped face looking back. <br />
<br />
Kelvin traced the lines of his head, from his slightly moved and rounded ears, down across the bulge of his jaw line and blacked nose. He flared his nose out and drank in the smell of his own fur- hang on that was not his fur! That’s what was the smell was- Bear!!<br />
<br />
The Bearman looked round the bathroom confused, there was none else here, yet…..then he heard it, a light sobbing coming from the closed stall. He paused, this was none of his concern, yet……..Kelvin willing himself, reluctantly back to Human form, he rearranged his clothes then squatted to look under the closed stall door. Facing him where a pair of claws, Bear claws. Fur covered legs where encased in tight trousers, a pair of polished black shoes where discarded to one side, a black tie sitting strangely on top of them. Kelvin straighten up and considered his options, there was a Bear Shifter in distress, but was it his problem? He made a decision and knocked on the stall door<br />
“You all right in there?” he rumbled. The sobbing stopped.<br />
“Go away” a deep but weak voice said. Kelvin thought he recognised it. <br />
“Cosgrove?” he asked “is that you?” <br />
“I said go away” Cosgrove answered. <br />
“Look man, I can’t. You are a Bear Shifter- I can leave a fellow in trouble!” Kelvin took a grip on the door.<br />
“Look, whatever, I am alright!” Cosgrove sniffed.<br />
“Well you won’t mind me having a look then!” Kelvin growled and lifted the door clear off its hinges. <br />
<br />
Cosgrove’s head snapped up as the door vanished, looking directly into the deep eyes of Kelvin. <br />
“Leave me alone” he said quietly. Kelvin surveyed the mess the Agent was in- half naked, half Bear and obviously upset. <br />
“What’s up man?” he said leaning on the stall wall, which creaked but held.<br />
“Nothing” Cosgrove said and tried to will himself back to Human form. <br />
“Really?” then why you shaking and unable to shift? Talk to me man!” Cosgrove jumped to his feet the rage suddenly pumping through him<br />
“You really want to know?” he growled his voice low and deep “you sure you want to know?” Kelvin was taken aback by the sudden rage; he swallowed his own instinct to shift. <br />
“Try me” he said calmly. Cosgrove looked the burly Shifter up and down<br />
“Out there” he waved a semi-clawed hand in the direction of the restaurant “sits a man that denied me my heritage, my family. He destroyed my only chance of finding my folks. Felix Tal is a dangerous, evil man that brings disaster everywhere he goes. Today was no accident, what he did to you was no accident! He has a history of being in the right place at the worst time- he has destroyed rituals that have taken years to prepare! He has a store of magical artefacts capable of destroying the world. He is known to shift homes, move around ahead of the authorities. It is believed he traffics with off-world monsters!! Felix Tal is the single most wanted, most sort after man on this world! He is poison!” Cosgrove took a deep breath. <br />
“So which bit of that applies to you?” Kelvin said, somewhat shocked at the revelations about Tal, after all he *had* ripped him from another world to this one! Did Cosgrove have a point, how much did they know about Tal? <br />
“He destroyed a ritual that would have told me if any members of my relations survive- he denied me my family” Cosgrove deflated and sat down again, ignoring the slight ripping sound from his trousers. <br />
“Man, that’s bad, you’ve never found them?” Kelvin said.<br />
“No. I am an orphan. I found a distant cousin that’s all. The records are missing or destroyed” Cosgrove willed the change again and slowly shifted into Human form. <br />
“You tried paying someone to search for you?” Kelvin asked- suddenly remembering his grandmother had paid for some genealogy research one time. <br />
“Who would research a Shifters family tree?” Cosgrove snorted.<br />
“Why not the people at the 'Thrope Centre” Kelvin said.<br />
“The Therianthropy Center? Ha.” Cosgrove laughed reaching for his shirt. <br />
“You tried them then?”  Cosgrove paused and looked at the big man. “I take it from that look you didn’t?” <br />
“I am an Agent of the FBM! Why would they help me, they’d think I am trying to close them down!” said Cosgrove angrily. <br />
“Dammit!” Kelvin said slapping the side of the stall “you are not the only Shifter in the world! There are others like us!”<br />
“You have just Changed, and you have a partner, you would not understand!” Cosgrove said almost as a sigh. <br />
“Why not?”<br />
“I shifted very early. I was 10. The orphanage freaked and got me transferred to a ‘special school’ –nearly a mental home. I only got pulled out of there due to a FBM sweep. I have lived my entire life dealing with stereotypes, ignorance and stupid people. I do things by myself and the way I want to!” Cosgrove cross his arms across his hairy chest and stared at Kelvin as if demanding he prove him wrong.<br />
“Well, that’s your call mate” Kelvin said “you don’t have to be as stubborn as the Bear we resemble sometimes. Tell you what- you ever decide you want some help, come look me up and we’ll go and find your folks. No strings attached. I am not going to be after your money, body or anything else, and its not as if I won’t understand what being a Shifter is all about. Perhaps you’ll relaise your not on your own!” With that Kelvin turned and walked away from the stall. He just got to the door to the bathroom when he heard Cosgrove and turned back to face him.<br />
“Look thanks, I’ll think about it” Cosgrove said standing in the doorway to the stall. Kelvin smiled warmly at him.<br />
“Put the door back on and call me sometime” he said and left the bathroom.</p>
