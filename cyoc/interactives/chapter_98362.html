<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harry and Jenny meanwhile had a very good day once her transformation was completed. While Harry noted Jenny&#39;s unease from time to time concerning meeting some of the other weres, particularly female weres. He figured that was probably a result of Jenny being incomplete for so long, and he hoped that in time, Jenny would get better with the therapy that Frances Twist had offered. As many of their interactions with other weres in Moon Lake had been fairly pleasant. Werefoxes apologized for Yvette&#39;s actions and welcomed them to the Skulk and the others were all friendly and welcoming. Harry, having grown up in Moon Lake, was used to this, and at times, he thought that Jenny was adapting well to it. It had it&#39;s fair share of surprises, in learning that their teacher at the college was Yvette&#39;s first victim and that his wife had become a different were, but those meetings had gone well.<br />
<br />
They had collected an extensive amount of clothing at Awareness, which had ended up having a large bill. Though thankfully, both the city government and the Skulk had agreed to cover those sorts of expenses. Arranging for the split bill took a bit of negotiating with the Awareness cashier, but went well and the two began to make their way back to the college campus.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could just spend all my time with you,&quot; Jenny said to him as they rode along in his car.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do too,&quot; Harry smiled, &quot;but all your stuff is in your dorm room and you&#39;ll have to get it if we&#39;re to get an apartment for the two of us, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded, as thoughts of their wedding in the future floated into her mind. Halloween wasn&#39;t that far off, and they had plenty that they&#39;d need to do. She would need to invite her parents. They may not have spoiled her and were certainly more demanding of her than they had a right to be, but they hadn&#39;t necessarily been &quot;bad&quot; parents or parents that didn&#39;t love her. There were a few friends in Alabama that Jenny wanted to invite, including Regina Maxwell who had been Jenny&#39;s best friend growing up. Regina had interest in more exotic pets, and owned a pet fox that actually looked like Jenny&#39;s own werefox form. Jenny enjoyed visiting Regina&#39;s just to pet the fox, which was rather friendly to her. There were of course also figuring out how to explain her new figure without revealing were-beasts and for the moment, Jenny hadn&#39;t had time to figure that out.<br />
<br />
And for the moment she hadn&#39;t had time to fully figure that all out as she and Harry were still working over what were the most immediate concerns that related to adapting being a werefox now. And that included her dealings with her present roommate and being ready for all the potential surprises that went along it. By now they had pulled into the dorm building parking lot and Jenny prepared herself for what was sure to follow. Harry found a parking space and pulled in and the two went about the process of collecting the clothes that had been bought to refurbish Jenny&#39;s wardrobe. Thankfully they had been put in bags, so it wasn&#39;t as though there was a risk of showing everyone her new underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything will be fine,&quot; Harry assured her, &quot;the students that have come here from outside Moon Lake have all signed waivers that they agree not to reveal anything that might relate to Moon Lake&#39;s were-beasts... and those of us that have grown up here have been raised to to understand that were-beasts aren&#39;t the move or folklore monsters that they&#39;re portrayed to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... what about seeing me as a victim...&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;I don&#39;t want to be pitied...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t,&quot; Harry assured her, &quot;people will understand... and for the moment, you know that I&#39;m here.&quot;<br />
<br />
That only made Jenny smile as she followed Harry along the sidewalk and then into dormitory. The entryway and lounge area was quiet. There were some students there, but they were collected around the television watching ESPN in getting ready for Monday night football. They weren&#39;t quite close to even the official &quot;pre-game&quot; program, but the 24 hour sports channel was still doing a lot of that sort of pregame coverage. The students there didn&#39;t notice Jenny and Harry as they entered and made their way to the elevators that were in the center of the dormitory hallway. They entered it and Harry set one set of bags down and pressed the button for the third floor.<br />
<br />
The ride in the elevator went quietly and the two new werefoxes were quick to go to the dorm room that Jenny had been assigned to. Jenny was quick to pull out the dorm key that the dean had given to Harry after the hearing to replace the one that had been in her duffel bag that Yvette had stolen. Harry had then given the key to her before they had gone to Awareness. However, the door was unlocked and Jenny found herself bombarded by new scents that had been left behind by her and by her roommate. Jenny had actually caught her own normal scent that had been left behind, and figured how it differed from her new werefox scent, but that was an old scent that lingered from the past. The other scent, however, was fresher and belonged to a normal human, and was her roommate. And she was present.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jen!&quot; came her roommate&#39;s rather peppy voice from a small desk.<br />
<br />
The dorm room had two beds that were on opposite sides of the room with small writing desks  next to each bed. Above the desks were bookshelves that were nailed to the wall and allowed for books and papers. Things for health, clothing, and any makeup  and other things were in closets that were next to the wall that divided by the door. And Jenny&#39;s roommate was at the desk on her side of the room and she looked to Jenny as she and Harry entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn girl... you&#39;re gonna have to beat off all the boys with a stick,&quot; her roommate commented noticing Jenny&#39;s new curves, &quot;and a few girls too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I suppose so,&quot; Jenny shrugged, &quot;but I have Harry... and we&#39;re bonded to each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s good,&quot; her roommate replayed with a smile, &quot;Hey, Harry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re rather calm with things,&quot; Harry commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... the dean called me to his office to explain things after lunch,&quot; her roommate explained, &quot;sucks that I&#39;m gonna lose a good roommate... but I do understand... and I expect to be invited to the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lose a roommate?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re gonna move in with you HUSBAND?&quot; he roommate spoke with a smirk, &quot;aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny managed a blush at that. &quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, there&#39;s only one thing left,&quot; her roommate then finished...<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I see the vixen you&#39;ve become?&quot; her roommate asked.<br />
<br />
Jenny looked to her roommate and then back to Harry who shut the door behind them. He gave her an understanding smile and set the bags he was carrying down on floor near Jenny&#39;s bed and continued to smile while Jenny then turned back to her roommate. She did feel thankful that while her roommate was so understanding. And she would invite her to the wedding. And with that, Jenny began to transform.<br />
<br />
She kicked off her shoes and socks as her cream colored fur began to grow out and as her toenails and fingernails lengthened into short claws. It let her grow slightly taller and let her feel what was come forward.  She felt warmer as she changed it didn&#39;t hurt, and in fact the transformation to a certain degree  i even felt good. And a present, her clothing actually git her better and even shifted with her.  He cream furred tail grew ought through the designed hole in her panties and through the designed hold/hole in her jeans. And since the clothing she now wore as designed to fit her greatly increased bust line, transforming into her vixen form didn&#39;t make her fell tight in her clothing.  As her ears grew larger, pointed, and moved to the top of her head she actually watched her roommate look on in awe as she continued to become more and more fox-like.<br />
<br />
&quot;Karen...you like?&quot; Jenny asked as she face pushed forward into her pointed muzzle, not as long as Yvette&#39;s or William&#39;s, but still the pointed muzzle of a fox. It didn&#39;t give Jenny any pain, even though she could hear the crackling of bone as the bones in her face pushed into her muzzle to house her now sharper teeth.<br />
<br />
Her roommate actually let out a squeal, &quot;Ohhhhh! You&#39;re all fuzzy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny found herself in a hug as her roommate, Karen Yuletide, came forward and ran her hands through Jenny&#39;s fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not just sexy... you&#39;re adorable!&quot; Karen smiled as she tried to fluff the fur on the sides of Jenny&#39;s muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jenny said weakly. A part of her mind thought back to her childhood friend&#39;s pet Fennec. She had thought that fox was adorable too. She wondered if that connection was why she became Fennec Fox based werefox rather than being based off the Red Fox that so many other werefoxes were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though I&#39;ll have to admit that I&#39;m rather jealous,&quot; Karen admitted, as she poked Jenny&#39;s right breast, &quot;but don&#39;t worry. Your secret&#39;s safe with me. The dean explained everything and showed that were-beasts aren&#39;t mindless or mean... and after seeing the new you... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen squealed again in excitement and hugged Jenny again.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you&#39;re fan?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of things that are cute,&quot; Karen answered, &quot;I want to be an animator when we graduate and will make all sorts of cute cartoons for kids to watch and love... and you&#39;re now very cute...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny only shook her head and gave a laugh. It might be a bit odd, but she was glad that her friend understood... or at least was friendly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jenny said after a few moments, &quot;and don&#39;t worry. Harry and I won&#39;t let you miss the wedding.&quot;</p>
