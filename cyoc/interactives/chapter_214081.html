<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erik made a beeline for the door, not wanting to stick around any longer. He had to see for himself what was going on, and he couldn&#39;t do that surrounded by all the other guys. He was just about to reach for the handle when Coach called out to him.<br />
&quot;Erik, hold on a minute,&quot; Coach said, making his way over.<br />
Erik hesitated for a moment, then turned to face the coach. &quot;Sorry Coach, I&#39;m not feeling well. I need to get out of here. I&#39;ll bring the jockstrap back tomorrow,&quot; he said, trying to make his voice sound as convincing as possible.<br />
Coach raised an eyebrow, looking at Erik skeptically, but didn&#39;t press the matter. &quot;Okay, feel better.&quot;<br />
Erik nodded, then quickly made his exit, eager to get home and figure out what was going on.<br />
<br />
As he drove home, his mind raced with a mixture of confusion, fear, and excitement. He couldn&#39;t believe what he had seen in the locker room, and he couldn&#39;t wait to get a closer look. He had never been the biggest guy, and he had always been a little self-conscious about it. But now, it seemed like things were changing. What was causing it? Was it permanent? And what would happen if he couldn&#39;t control it? These were all questions that raced through his mind as he drove.<br />
<br />
Erik pulls into his driveway and rushes inside, eager to get to his room and examine himself more closely. He barely notices his parents as he breezes past them and heads straight to his bedroom. He closes the door behind him and stands in front of the mirror, taking a deep breath before he begins to undo the waistband of his practice pants. With each button, he feels his heart pounding faster and faster in his chest. Finally, he pushes his pants down to his ankles, revealing his transformed body to himself for the first time.<br />
<br />
<br />
He started by examining his chest, then his arms and legs, but everything looked normal. Finally, he reached down to unbutton his pants and pull down the jockstrap. He gasped as he saw the size of his new package. It was bigger, thicker, and more defined than it had ever been before. He rubbed his hand over it, feeling the hardness and fullness, and then he finally let out a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
Erik reached for a measuring tape and began to take his official measurements. He was amazed at the results. He was now 5.5 inches soft and 7.5 inches hard, and his testicles had increased in size as well. They were no longer the size of large cherries, but now they were at least as big as ping pong balls.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t believe what he was seeing. This was his body, but it was different. He had always been small, but now he was big. He was nervous and excited at the same time. He didn&#39;t know what was happening to him, but he was eager to find out.<br />
<br />
As the days passed, Erik found himself becoming more and more confident in his new body. The locker room no longer held any fears or anxieties for him, and he even began to enjoy the playful teasing from his teammates. Instead of hiding in a corner, trying to avoid attention, Erik now walked around freely, proud of his new form.<br />
<br />
He was no longer ashamed or self-conscious, and he no longer felt the need to hide himself from the rest of the world. In fact, he was now one of the bigger guys on the team and his size was no longer something he was ashamed of.<br />
<br />
It was a strange feeling at first, to have the extra weight between his legs. But over time, he grew to love the sensation of the heft, the power it seemed to convey. It was a constant reminder of his transformation and it made him feel even more confident in his new body.<br />
<br />
In class, he would sometimes feel the weight shifting in his pants, reminding him of his size, but instead of being embarrassed, he found himself enjoying the feeling. He would adjust himself surreptitiously and relish in the sensation of his own body.<br />
<br />
Erik was now more confident in the locker room and was no longer afraid to change around his teammates. He no longer felt the need to hide himself, and some of the guys on the team even playfully teased him, calling him &quot;big.&quot; Erik was now one of the bigger guys on the team, and he was proud of his size. Over the next few days, he got used to his size and realized that he no longer had to be ashamed.<br />
<br />
Even Coach noticed Erik&#39;s improvement, &quot;Good work out there today, Erik!&quot;<br />
Tyler, too, could see the change in Erik. &quot;You seem to be in a better mood lately, man. Glad to see you at the top of your game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erik was feeling great and was on top of his game. However, little did he know that this was just the beginning.</p>
