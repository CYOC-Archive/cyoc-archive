<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James saw a note land on his desk just as the bell rang. Without thinking he folded it up and put it in his backpack. He wasn't for ignoring notes, especially ones from girls, even if the girl happened to be a known gothic and rumored to be a lesbian.
<p>
While most notes he recieved tended to be short and very stupid the quick glace he had given it showed it was long and looked sorta of like a test. He couldn't help but like answering those.
<p>
The next period was his most favorite of all, Lunch.
<p>
Rushing from the room in long but subdued strides he managed to breeze by his classmates which we're rushing to thier lockers. In the big lunch race, he was the best, he never bothered to go to his locker because he was always near the front of the line and able to put down his bag quickly for the same reason.
<p>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<p>
After getting through the line and going to sit down at a table he glaces back at the huge line and is glad he isn't stuck in that huge line.
<p>
He picks out his customary table of solitude in the back and quickly downs his lunch before pulling out the note that had been passed to him.
<p><i>
To my new friend,<br><br>
You look so bored, just sitting there. Here's a game to amuse yourself into. Have fun! I know I did! Your new friend.</i>
<p>
Well look at that, she actually wanted to be his friend, or more likely wanted to laugh with her friends over douping into doing something dumb in a motion of friendship. Unfortunately that was the only way to find out for sure. but first he wanted to read this to the bottom.
<p>
Looking at the page it seems like questions. Pulling out one of his favorite precision black pens he decides to answer them for the simple fact of doing so.<p>
<i>Question 1: If you were a girl... would your handwriting be nice?</i><p>
That was a easy question, he had often wondered what it would be like if he we're a girl, and had made mental plans on many of what he would like to be. He tries to make his handwriting nice but its to much work. Nodding to this he writes down, "Yes".
<p><i>Question 2: If you were a girl... would you like pink?</i><p>
Thats a strange question, but considering he was okay with the color already didn't wonder why it would be any different as a girl, he writes down a "I would be okay with it. But I probably wouldn't wear it much."
<p><i>Question 3: If you were a girl... would your hair be straight or curly?</i><p>
Ah ha, getting to the meat now, this one is simple and writes down in now neat handwriting "semi-curly". His hair gets slightly curly but is concentraiting really hard on things and doesn't notice.
<p><i>Question 4: If you were a girl... what would be your favorite color?</i><p>
His favorate color now was white and has no intention of changing it. But to add some flavor to the answer he puts, "White, with green next in line."
<p><i>Question 5: If you were a girl... what color would your hair be?</i><p>
This is a hard question, generally since there are so many colors to choose from, he writes in "Dark Red" as he likes red-heads (he doesn't understand why anyone wouldn't). Unknown to him his hair color shift in hue from a dark brown to a dark red.
<p><i>Question 6: If you were a girl... what color would your eyes be?</i><p>
This one is harder, and unable to think of anything he writes in "Hazel" as thats his eye color.
<p><i>Question 7: If you were a girl... would you like makeup?</i><p>
Simple and to the point, he hates the idea of putting on makeup every day, and quickly writes "No".
<p><i>Question 8: If you were a girl... would you be sporty?</i><p>
He loves sporty girls, they would never give him the time of day though, and wouldn't like to be like that, so he writes in "somewhat sporty". Not noticing as his body gets leaner and slightly more muscular.
<p><i>Question 9: If you were a girl... would you wear high heels?</i><p>
He has seen to many girls trip over thier own feet to think he would have any chance in any and write in "no".
<p><i>Question 10: If you were a girl... would you wear a skirt?</i><p>
Being serious about this quiz, he writes in a "No, only sometimes", he wouldn't like to be that revealing but at the same time not limit his options.
<p><i>Question 11: If you were a girl... would you wear jewelry?</i><p>
He tried it before but always thought it felt odd wearing it, so writes down "No."
<p><i>Question 12: If you were a girl... what size would your breasts be?</i><p>
Tapping his pen on the table he thinks.. but realizes he likes petite girls and writes in "B-cup". All of a sudden his chest rises and he or rather she realizes whats happening now. Scared but also somewhat excited she realizes she can change her entire life with this test. While she wouldn't of picked now of all times to be a girl when would she have another chance to entirely redefine herself? Leaning over she gives her full attention to the note.
<p><i>Question 13: If you were a girl... would you be into guys?</i><p>
Thinking she puts down "Yes, but I would also like girls." Realizing she wants to keep her options open she notices the boys in the room are more then undefined blobs of nothing to her now.
<p><i>Question 14: If you were a girl... would you shave?</i><p>
Thinking about this she didn't like shaving when she was completely a boy, but did so anyway because she hated the hair. Thinking of a witty way to get rid of both problems she writes in "I have a genetic trait where I do not grow body hair." After finishing and picking up her pen, all the hair on her body except her head pulls into her body.
<p><i>Question 15: If you were a girl... would you use pads or tampons?</i><p>
Not knowing to much about either she opts for the middle ground, "I use either, but perfer tampons". At this she notices whats left of her male self disappear replaced by a vagina and inside it she feels something place itself there. She now knows the difference between the two and is glad she went with tampons as her preference. Good riddence to her old self.
<p><i>Question 16: If you were a girl... what type of shirt would you be wearing right now?</i><p>
A simple enough question, she writes in "I would be wearing a simple tight t-shirt, but not so tight its uncomfortable." All of a sudden the button up shirt she was wearing is replaced by a tight green t-shirt that shows off what little she doesn't have and considers revising an earlier question but decides against it.
<p><i>Question 17: If you would were a girl... would you be wearing briefs, bikini, thong or boxers?</i><p>
She writes in "bikini" as its the most likely of the bunch. She notices has her underwear gets smaller and tighters around her bottom.
<p><i>Question 18: If you were a girl... what would be your intelligence? One being stupid and ten being high enough to drive the class nerd up the wall.</i><p>
Frowning she considers herself already to be a 9 or so, anything else would be a step down considering she used to be the local nerd. Considering the question carefully, she writes in a number well off the top of the scale at "18". Afterall it never said she was limited to that range of numbers. All of a sudden she understands a whole lot more and also realizes the answer she put down for questions 6, 12 and 37 on her last test we're wrong, one even idiotic. She also remembers what she was forgetting due to this test and looks around to make sure no one is looking in on her. She remembers what she was forgetting from putting in the other answers, but they are still true and she accepts that.
<p><i>Question 19: If you were a girl... what type of bra would you be wearing?</i><p>
Being as smart as she is now, she realizes she knows all the types of bra but settles for the simple one considering her now somewhat sporty. Puts down "A Simple, yet Comfortable Sport Bra"
<p><i>Question 20: If you were a girl... how old would you be, how tall would you be without shoes and what would you weigh without clothes?(Don't lie)</i><p>
She notices this question to be a little more demanding then the rest. She was currently a junior, but already to old for it at an age at 18, being lazy in school a few years back. When she was a boy she liked the smaller girls, but didn't want to be to short herself, and she liked the skinny petite girls so not to heavy. Taking into consideration all this and the standard Body Mass Index for the height to weight ratio she writes down "I would be 16 but still a Junior because i'm a hard worker. I would be 5 feet and 5 inches tall and weigh 115 pounds." All of a sudden she gets smaller and leaner and she shrinks a bit and get about 40 pounds lighter, her face smooths and softens to that of a younger girl.
<p><i>Question 21: If you were a girl... what type of shoes are you wearing?</i><p>
Taking advantage of the openness of the question, she puts down "Small and Simple Walking Shoes for my small feet". After finishing she notces her feet shrink a little and her loafers transform into walking shoes.
<p><i>Question 22: If you were a girl... what other accessories would you be wearing?</i><p>
She considers but realizes she doesn't want anything gaudy so she writes in "A small silver mechanical watch." She watches as her old mens massive digital time-x turns into a much smaller mechanical ladies watch.
<p><i>Question 23: If you were a girl... how long would your hair be, and how would you wear it?</i><p>
She always liked girls with long hair but its hard to manage, she writes in "It would be only about neck length but full of volume and easy to manage, its worn down naturally."
<p><i>Question 24: If you were a girl... what would your name be?</i><p>
Well realizing she couldn't be called James, well she could but it would be strange. As smart as she was now, it was a hard question, there is alot to put into a name, and she knew as soon as she wrote it down it would become true. Noticing lunch is about over however she decides quickly and writes in "Runa" for rune.

As she gets up she reads the last line of the note.
<p><i>If you want to have a happy life as a girl, pass this on to the next person. Boy or Girl, don't matter'.</i><p>

She realizes this must be the deal sealer, so on her way out she smiles and passes it off to one of the nerdy geek boys that she thinks also needs a break from the constant humiliation and torment she recieved when she was simular. As she passes it she sees her text vanish as soon as he looks at it, he looks up and says, "Um Thanks.. Runa."<p><br>

She smiles to herself.. but at the same time has a naughty thought that she realizes that she is actually is a girl as she 'accidently' brushes one of her breasts as she slings her backpack over a shoulder. She can't wait for school to be over. But there are only two classes left. Gym, which will be great fun now that she is more athletic and she gets to change in the grils lockerroom and Math, boy is her teacher in for a heart attack.</p>
