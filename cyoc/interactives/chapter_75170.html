Travis and Riley are your typical male college students. They study when they have to; party a little when they don’t, and love to meet all the upstanding college females while they are at it. They also enjoy sports, eating tons of whatever they can get (especially Travis), and somehow manage to stay pretty slim and in shape while doing all of this. These two fellas are also roommates and best friends. Travis has darker skin and black hair is about 5’11” and is pretty fit. He and Riley love to play intermural sports like, football, volleyball, basketball and Frisbee together. Riley is about 5’8” tall with a short but stocky yet slim frame, and at this time of year has decently pale skin with a short crop of dirty blond hair normally worn spiked or faux-hawked on his head. Riley also plays for the soccer team at his university; they are the home of the Mighty Malamutes.<br />
<br />
Exams had finally ended for the pair and they were officially on Christmas break. Riley busted into Travis’s room excited to see his best friend at school like always but even more so because the dark ages of the semester exam period was finally over. “Traaaaaaaaavis we are finally done man I’m…..” Riley stopped mid sentence because when he turned the corner from the bathroom that connected their two single bedrooms the first thing he saw was Travis who was shoveling food into his mouth. Upon hearing his name called Travis turned his head with food still hanging out of his mouth. Riley laughed and said, “man you eat so much and you don’t gain a pound! And its always some of the junkiest foods too,” as he pointed to Travis’s trash can that was full of Asian food containers, Taco Bell wrappers, and worst of all a box that at one point contained some of their hellish food that the Mighty Malamutes kennel (their cafeteria) had cooked up. Travis swallowed his mouth full and put his food down on his desk and said, “Man you are just jealous you cant fit that much food in that pint sized belly of yours,” he said laughingly. With all the soccer you play and running you do you should eat twice as much as I do. You can run for days! You have to be able to eat enough to keep you all fueled up!” Riley moved to sit on Travis’s bed, “Haha that’s true I guess, but hey you thinking what I’m thinking?” Riley said winking at Travis. “No one is left in our dorm building by now and almost no one is left on campus except for the basketball teams, I say we have some fun.”<br />
<br />
You see what wasn’t so typical about these two roommates is that they have a passion for transformation but only recently found out they both had this passion in common. They found out when Riley while delaying studying for his first exam about a week and a few days ago stumbled upon a website called, Incantation.com. Upon further investigation of this website Riley found that the site had a myriad of different spells that could change a person’s age, gender, and even species. Immediately Riley gravitated towards his favorite, animal transformation. What happened next changed the two boy’s relationship forever.<br />
<br />
They had been close before but when Riley sent a message to Travis via Facebook right after Riley’s transformation into a white German shepherd had begun. “&quot;Travis man you should check out this web page, it has some crazy stuff on it,” the message had said; and before Travis could respond Riley had signed off of Facebook. Interested in what his friend had sent him Travis went on the site and managed to find his interest piqued by the same section his roomie had. After reading an incantation to become a border collie in jest he heard a commotion from the bathroom that connects his room with Riley’s. In walked a white German shepherd with the remains of Riley’s favorite boxers he wore frequently with no other shred of clothing around their suite. Travis’s transformation then started and within moments the two human boys were two young dogs; they spent the rest of the day having fun with each other, they had a fantastic time.<br />
<br />
It was this very site and experience that Travis knew Riley was so giddy talking about. After this memory quickly flashing in his head Travis responded with smirk and fake calmness, “Yea, I guess I’m down to give it another go.” “YES YES YES YES YES!!” Riley yelled at the top of his lungs, “I can’t wait to change again! We are going to have so much fun! And this time the campus is empty! I already know what I want to become!” Riley kept rambling on when his friend interrupted him. “Ok OK calm down man, jeez you are hyper active when you don’t get exercise aren’t you?!” “I know I’m just excited to change into a…” Travis interrupted Riley again, “Don’t tell me Riley I want it to be a surprise like it was last time. So you go to your room ill change in here,” Travis said pointing to his bed. “Ok sounds good,” Riley said as he left the room but quickly poked his head back out of the bathroom and said, “don’t forget to record it!” he said winking again before sprinting back to his own room.<br />
<br />
As soon as Riley sat down at his computer he immediately turned on the camera and set it to record. We then got on the Internet and quickly typed in the URL he had been fantasizing about since that faithful day about a week ago. He legitimately so excited and he knew exactly which incantation he wanted to try.<br />
<br />
Travis was just as excited as Riley was but did a much better job of hiding it. The college boy moved from his bed over to where his computer lay on his desk and turned on the camera just like Riley had on his. Like Riley, he also knew which spell he wanted to try, but what he didn’t know is that somehow Riley had chosen to try the same one. The incantation they had decided was the “Inner Animal Revealer.<br />
<br />
Both boys were busy finding the incantation and when they finally did locate it both started to read the information about it. “This incantation will cause the chanter to become their totem animal. As every human has traits, mannerisms, and physical features, an animal spirit lives with in them that represent the individual. Upon the reading of this spell the caster will become their inner animal.” Under the incantations information was a bold bright read disclaimer that read, “INSTRUCTIONS/WARNING: This incantation is to be read aloud. For fully permanent and fully immersive affect all 10 lines must be read. For 12-hour affect, only 9 lines are to be read. Depending on strength of the casters will power, in addition to the physical change, there will be a degree of mental change. Including new instincts, behaviors, needs, and mannerisms of the new species. For the 9 line incantation the caster can, if strong enough mentally, resist total change of mental ability/instincts. The full incantation will cause permanent mental change.<br />
<br />
They both had read and understood this warning before although they both silently thought to themselves that it was a good reminder of what to do. Riley being a little bit gung-ho immediately started to read the incantation slowly, stumbling over each oddly sounding word like a 1st grader learning to read. By the time Riley had barely gotten halfway through with the 5th line Travis started to recite it with what sounded like a practiced tongue. In fact Travis ended up finishing the 9th and final line of his incantation just before Riley did.<br />
<br />
Suddenly it there was what seemed like a brief loss of power just like what had happened before their canine transformations last week. Both boys felt similar feelings of static electricity course through their bodies. It felt like their entire bodies were steadily being exposed to a very light current when suddenly Riley felt a more intense tingling on his belly. He looked down at his treasure trail to see it changing to black color and on just either side white hair... no fur was growing. The trail continued up past his naval where even the center trail turned bright white. The fur white fur then continued to spread forming a very fine layer and now spanned form just below the waistband of his boxers to his collar bones on each side of his chest and as wide as his nipples. At the sides of his torso the fur took a drastic change and became the same dark black that his treasure trail had turned into as the fur continued onto his back.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Travis had felt the same intensification of tingling but in his feet. He immediately removed his shoes and socks and continued to strip down until he like his roommate was only in his plaid boxers. His feet started to spasm and palsy, but barely felt any pain, in the bones cracking and realigning in his feet when paired with the grey fur now growing on them actually tickled. The metatarsals and phalanges of his feet shrank and changed shape while his toenails shrunk along with is feet but sharpened into black claws. Suddenly the same sensation occurred in his hands and he held them up in front of his face as they shook and spasmed uncontrollably. The bones shrinking and transforming while the same gray fur grew up his shrinking hands.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the suite Riley’s changes had accelerated. He felt the powerful sensation focus on his tailbone and groin area. On his tailbone he could feel his sacrum push towards the surface of his skin until it seemed like another vertebrae formed. Riley suddenly had the urge to bend forward as if doing so would help the growth on his tail bone along. He moaned as his black boxers now tented in both directions because at the same time the additions to his backside were taking place his manhood rose to attention from the intense pleasure focused there. It pushed through the opening breaking the button that held it closed off in the front of his boxers as it thumped along with his heartbeat. Still hunched over hands on his knees butt pushed back Riley got a great look<br />
at what was happening to his maleness. It had almost completely turned cherry red and his mushroom tip began to come to a sharp point. As that was happening skin attached to the base of his dick and slowly worked its way up its length slowly bringing it against the boys stomach right along the line of black hair that hard formed over his treasure trail. This skin then grew black fur to finish creating his furry sheath. Finally at the base of his now almost complete doggy-hood a bulge formed. Riley looked confused as it plumped up and remembered hearing while on his TF sites that dogs had knots right at the base of their equipment when they were excited and they caused them even more pleasure. While this was going on Riley’s bulging tailbone was pushing harder and harder against the fabric of his boxers. Finally after the pleasure and pressure built and built and finally with a thrust backwards and forwards Riley’s let out a loud moan, “OOHHHRRRWWWHHH”, that cracked into a very canine sounding growl mixed with a whine. The growing tail exploded through his boxers ripping them right down the middle of his rear. And on the return thrust forward his doggy-hood got rid of any human remnants in his doggy balls as he made a mess on the carpet. The tail quickly spurted straight out to its full length of about 3.5 feet long before becoming animated and rising up exposing his butt. Riley stood and noticed his boxers now hung like a limp flag only by the hole that his new sheath had pushed through in its center. He knew he was a canine but couldn’t tell just by the black and white fur he had of what he was becoming, until he looked over his shoulder and saw the huge tail that was so long and going straight up his back that it tickled the bottom of his neck. He knew then. He knew he was becoming a husky of some sort.<br />
<br />
The changes to Travis’s hands and feet had left them looking comically small on his still completely human body. Luckily he was sitting on his bed or he definitely would have fallen over on his now much smaller paws. The weird thing is though is that his where his hands where still had opposable thumbs but had the look of claws. “Interesting” Travis, thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the intense feelings left his arms as they were now completely covered in grey fur and it returned in force on his torso. Travis quickly removed his shirt as the grey fur spread over his shoulders and down slowly started down his chest slowing down even more when it reached his nipples. There the fur slowly crested over the slightly risen pieces of skin and tickled Travis as it did so. It then moved down his abdominals. On his back the fur bristled in the middle of his spine causing Travis to arch his back from the feeling. The new fur when it had finished growing to its full length stood on end as if electrified. The fur on his shoulders was now very thick and as the fur pushed closer and closer to his waist, the density of the fur that had already sprouted from his hairless torso and back fought to catch up. Eventually the fur fully covered his chest and back and had dove beneath the waistband of his boxers and shorts.<br />
When this happened Travis couldn’t help but shudder from the feelings that was now assaulting his brain coming from inside his shorts. What Travis didn’t seem to realize is that he was slowly shrinking, although the pleasure now coming from his stretching tailbone made Travis groan in pleasure. The friction of his cloth boxers on the tip of his lengthening tailbone and now completely erect manhood was causing Travis to shudder and shake with pleasure. He got on all fours on his bed as the tension grew in both the front and back of his underwear. The intense feelings were causing his body almost involuntarily to raise his butt high in the air and lowering his chest then immediately lowering his groin to the bed with a grinding motion once there while raising his chest then repeating. This seemed to cause so much pleasure for Travis as he felt what he knew what his tail growing and his dick also started to change. While the rest of his body may have been shrinking Travis’s maleness and tail were growing until eventually as his manhood changed species, becoming slightly pointed but still keeping some of its shape and fading in color from its normal dark skinned appearance to pale grey color, and his tail broke the skin just beyond his tail bone and exploded with fur and growth. This explosive growth tore through the red and white plaid boxers he had on ripping them literally in half. His now bush tail found the path of least resistance going straight down his shorts leg while his now even more sensitive almost fully coon-hood still rubbed against the inner fabric of his athletic shorts. Grey fur from his groin traveled up his maleness just a bit and surrounded it in a sheath, the same fur covered his slightly more plump testicles as this new sheath connected his mutated shaft to his stomach so in a four legged stance it would not drag on the ground. The attaching to his stomach caused the tip of his penis to push above the waistband of his shorts giving Travis his first look what his human package had become. It was at least 2 inches longer than normal. Suddenly he felt something big coming as he continued to rock his hips until with one last thrust he released any human DNA he had left inside of him. At the precise moment this happened his tail became innervated and the majority of its now 3-foot length flexed and went all around hitting and rubbing his legs and flexing against his shorts. Travis panted out of breath has he noticed the fur on his feet had now met the fur growing down his now much shorter legs. He also got a look at the huge bushy ringed grey and black tail of what he knew belonged to a raccoon.<br />
<br />
In the other room the now more husky than boy Riley had fallen down to all fours when his hips shifted let him stand more comfortably on his hands and knees. The furry fun that had made a mess and left his favorite boxers in tatters draped around his still slightly visible red rocket and sheath that surrounded most of the length of his member. As the fur moved down his shoulders where it was black it faded to white as it approached his hands, his arms his arms shortened. Simultaneously his torso was narrowing and chest barreling slightly. His arms twisted slightly so that his hands, which were now being covered in fur, were planted with his five fingers pointed straight in front of him. They then started to spasm and shake as his fingers shortened while his fingernails darkened and sharpened much like Travis’s had. Unlike a raccoon paw, dog paws have a dewclaw, which as all his fingers shortened Riley’s thumb moved up his foreleg to form this trademark appendage.<br />
<br />
On the other end of his body the Riley’s black furred butt cheeks flattened and spread giving him the normal looking husky butt. The fur changed colors as white fur started to cascade down his legs. His whole leg shrank as his quads became less powerful and hamstrings grew massive. His heels left the ground as they stretched upwards becoming his hocks. His feet then underwent the same process as his hands, as they became his hind paws complete with dewclaws of their own.<br />
<br />
Travis who was already on all fours really started to feel his entire body starting to shrink down. His arms and legs essentially kept their same anatomy they just became stubbier but in proportion to his shrunken coon form looked completely normal now.<br />
<br />
The two boys turned animals were almost done with their transformations. The only part of them that had yet to be touched was their heads and faces. Both of them looked in mirrors and looked how odd they looked one with a fully husky body one with a raccoon body but both with still completely human heads, but this soon changed as the culmination of all of the intense feelings ran up their bodies and concentrated on their necks and heads. Travis’s gray fur slowly moved up over his head and to his chin. As soon as they fur made contact with his ears they immediately started moving up his head as they covered in soft darker grey fur and rimmed with white fur around their edges. He winced when his ears started to ring as they changed from a human shape to a triangular shape of a raccoon.<br />
<br />
He could hear everything now including his roommate in the other room, whose black fur rushed up the back of his neck and changed the color of his blond hair on his head while white fur crept up to his chin. His tiny human ears covered in black fur and moved up his head becoming the high and pointy triangular ears that allow huskies to hear so well. His hearing also became unbelievable but was now filled with the sound of bones crunching, cracking, and changing shape as the white fur spread over his face and his nose and mouth merged together all in one swift motion. His nose became cold and he felt his tongue lengthen and loll out over his sharpening teeth. He moaned, “OHHHHRHHRRRRR” and his voice cracked between human and husky vocals as his muzzle started to push out ever so slowly. His eyes flashed black but then settled on his normal brilliant blue.<br />
<br />
While Travis’s face was now covered in a grey base coat his eye brows lightened into a brilliant white like that on his ears and on Riley’s body. While beneath his eyebrows came the one other distinctive feature all coons have, his black mask. It spread and covered his human eyes as they darkened briefly from brown to black but then settled on his normal brown color. And just below his mask white fur covered his mouth and chin as they merged together with his nose to start to form his muzzle; his human tongue flattening and lengthening his teeth shrinking and sharpening. Travis let out a groan of desire and pleasure, “OHHHWEEEEK,” that cracked and fluctuated between a human noise and a high-pitched squeak of a coon.<br />
<br />
They both were on par to finish their transformations as the same time! Their muzzles were almost fully-grown. Whiskers grew in on both young animals. With that both let out their last long human cries as the electric sensation built and built on their now fully distended noses as their voice cracked one last time and straining as right in the middle of their cries became completely feral. They were done. Fully animals.<br />
<br />
Suddenly they both twitched and in an instant had smelt each other. A dog and a raccoon would never get along. Their animal instincts causing them both to crouch and let out very audible growls and hisses as the fur on their back stood on end. Their human minds were at war with their new animal instincts and thankfully for them both they managed to subdue those instincts just like they had last time, at least, mostly subdue them. They both sprinted to the bathroom to see what they other had become and immediately started laughing. To each other it sounded like laughing but to the cameras still recording in their rooms it sounded like yips, whines, growls, squeaks, and barks. “HAHAHA You are a raccoon?! That fits you so well!” Riley laughed. “Yea yours matches you quite well too Riley,” Travis said back. “What is that on your uh…. Package there?” Travis sad pointing to the torn boxers still attached to Riley’s sheath. “Ohh haha whoops!” Riley said and shook his body like any dog would to dislodge something they didn’t want touching them. “Riley did your transformation…” Travis hesitated, “feel better this time?” “Uhh yea I definitely made a mess,” Riley quickly said back. “Haha yea I can smell it!” “Ohh don’t act like you didn’t! I can smell yours too,” the husky said as he got down in a playful stance. Riley then jumped at Travis and they wrestled around nipped at each other. They rolled and tumbled and barked, growled, hissed, and squeak while they had fun in the bathroom. It ended when they jumped at each other and fell into their bathtub where they both looked at each other panting then broke out in laughter again. When the laughter stopped Riley asked, “wanna go explore campus this time? We didn’t get to last time because neither of us had thumbs! We can go anywhere now!” Travis stood on his hind legs and flexed his hand/paws, “sure… as long as we stop by a dumpster first… I’m starving!”<br />
<br />
Before they left Riley and Travis cleaned their… messes and Riley may or may not have even tried a lick of his before tugging a towel off of the rack in his room with his mouth, dropped it on the big spot and then let his instincts take over. He twisted and rolled and got the towel wrapped all over him by the time he finished. He shook the towel off and for good measure did the canine 4-step shuffle over it as if he was burying some thing. Travis was much more civilized. He climbed up onto his sink grabbed a washcloth put water on it grabbed it with his mouth then used his thumbed paws to wipe away the mess.<br />
<br />
Riley finished cleaning his mess first and then sprinted into Travis’s room. “Man huskies are fast!” Riley then stood under the door and Travis jumped on top of him reached up and turned the doorknob so they could leave. “Man what would you do with out me,” Travis joked, “btw Riley its odd you chose a husky why…” I didn’t choose it,” Riley said as they walked down the three flights of stairs to the main floor. “I did the incantation that releases your inner animal or whatever.” “Whoa me too,” Travis said as they went towards the back door to leave the dorm building. Before Riley could respond to what Travis said suddenly he saw the raccoon straighten up and freeze. He was sniffing something. Then he took off like a bat out of hell. Riley after being surprised caught up with him and tried to slow him down, but suddenly he caught whiff of an oddly pleasing aroma. They turned a corner and Travis stopped and whispered just loud enough so Riley could hear, “The mother load.” Riley started to roll on the concrete laughing as Travis took off and jumped into the dumpster behind the cafeteria that their noses had led them to. “See this is why you are a raccoon man!” Riley said through laughing, “you will eat anything.” An eaten of off T-bone suddenly was thrown out of the dumpster. “In between bites Travis picked his masked head up out of the dumpster and said, “don’t act like you wouldn’t either! Huskies eat anything too, now enjoy that.” Riley tried his best to resist his instincts to eat out of the garbage but it just smelled too good. He pounced on the bone like it was fresh prey tail wagging and started knowing at it from ever angle. Riley barked at Travis to throw some more food out. Travis struggled with a huge back of trash 3 times his size before he managed to throw it over the edge to the waiting canine. Riley’s instincts took over again as he went to town on the bag while his raccoon friend was eating his fill inside the dumpster.<br />
<br />
After 30 minutes of gorging themselves on trash Riley was laying on his side about to slip into a nice food coma when Travis crawled out of the dumpster and jumped on the husky. “Wake up big guy!” He yelled as he jumped. Riley jumped up and bared his teeth before shaking his head, “Man I gotta get these husky instincts under control. German shepherd last time was no where near this bad.” “Yea I need to also I couldn’t do anything to stop running here, believe me, I tried,” Travis said. Their conversation was cut shot when unexpectedly they both heard the back up siren of a big piece of machinery or something of the sort coming towards them.<br />
<br />
They scurried quickly behind the dumpster to find that it was a big charter bus and on the side it said Rhodes University Raccoons. The bus stopped and what had to have been a basketball team strode out of the bus and towards the event center on campus. “Ohh this is too perfect,” Travis said with the best effort at a smile a raccoon could manage. Riley looked at him and gave him the doggy “I don’t understand” head tilt that people think is so cute. “Look they are the raccoons,” Travis said matter-of-factly. Riley gave him he same confused head tilt. “Ok pup pay close attention our school is the Mighty Malamutes. There school is the Rhodes Raccoons. I’m a raccoon, and you are a husky.” “Yes I know that… what about it?” Riley retorted. “Oh my gosh this is hopeless. A husky and malamute are very similar breeds. In fact if you would think really hard and get past the urge to go mark that tree right there,” Travis said pointing to a nearby large tree, “because I have definitely thought about it and remember that our mascot is a black and white malamute and you are a black and white husky. While.. Well while I am a raccoon we don’t have different colors.” “I understand that, dang it, what about it?!” Riley howled. “My proposal is Ill run in and be other team mascot you will run in and be our team’s mascot and we will be the halftime show.” Riley stood straight up and his tail started to wag as fast as he could wag it. “I am so down!”<br />
<br />
They entered the event center through back door, courtesy again of Travis’s handy thumbs. “Ok when the teams role out of there we will go out with them and I guarantee no one says a word of protest,” Travis said. “Yea you are right cause the only people still here will be hard core fans for either team because most students are on vacation! Alright I’m ready if we get in trouble we can meet back here.” Riley said finally sounding assertive. They went their separate ways.<br />
<br />
When Riley approached his team he was immediately met with pats on the head and petting and rubbing his belly someone even accidently handled his doggy-hood, which got him even more excited. Meanwhile Travis was at first met with trepidation by the away team. They all coward before this small marsupial until one of them rolled a ball they had at him to try and scare him way. Travis caught stopped the ball with his big bushy tail and then climbed on top of it and got on his hind feet. He then went around in circles while balancing on the rolling ball. The team sees this and laugh and one guy steps forward and Travis meets him and as the guy reaches a hand out to pet the animal Travis runs up his arm and sits on his shoulder. “This thing is awesome!!!” one team member said. “Yea he’s our new mascot now, who needs that freak in a costume when we have the real thing!!” Both teams ran out on the court to the applause of their fans. The teams were on opposite sides of the court so Riley and Travis could see each other. When they made eye contact Riley barked and Travis made the biggest noise he could make. “This was gonna be fun they thought.”<br />
<br />
The first half was played very close the biggest lead was by the Coons and it was only four points. The boys sat by their benches and as a player went in to the game they would pet their new mascots for luck. During half time the announcer introduced the two randomly while they sat at one end of the court arguing over who was going to win when they heard over the speakers, “…The new team mascots the Mighty Malamuteeeeee and the Rhode Raccooooon.” They stopped their conversation and ran to their fans diving into the stands and getting pet, getting belly rubs, food, and all the attention they could have ever wanted. A malamute fan even ran out on the court and threw a Frisbee for Riley who just let his instincts take over for a bit. It is so fun to give in to the dog instincts,” he said to himself. While Travis was busy doing his best to flirt with some female coon fans he even got a little excited. After the game they ran out together after Riley did some last minute celebrating with the home team fans with their 3-point win. By that time it was getting late and the boys were so tired from all the attention they had gotten.<br />
<br />
They got up to the dorm room and got inside and started talking about how much fun they had and Riley made fun of Travis for getting a bit of a coon stiffy in front of the girls. They even wrestled one more time before getting into Riley’s bed. Travis had an old box that Chinese food used to be in and Riley had an old leather shoe. The two young animals passed out from exhaustion. And awoke the next day completely naked and almost completely human with his shoe still in his mouth. Riley was on his back, his doggy morning wood in full display, as he looked over and saw Travis who was laying on his side in a tight ball the Chinese container not far from him at all who had just woken up as well to see him Riley in his morning glory. “Little excited their pup?! Travis said. Riley’s now much shorter tail reflexively moved between his legs to cover his excitidness. “Ohh don’t give me that I know you are no better he said playfully kicking Travis off the bed and in the process sees his coon hood in the same state of arousal and shrinking tail. The two sat there not caring about the nudity now and recapped the night one last time as the last changes reverted. After their recap they got showers, got dressed, and packed to head to their families’ homes. When Riley walked in to Travis’s room and said. “We gotta do that again! Maybe exotics next time?” He asked excitedly. Travis noticed that Riley wagged his butt like he had a tail just now and didn’t realize it. “Haha I just saw you wag your butt there pup. You don’t have tail anymore!” Riley blushed, “but ohh yea don’t worry we have plenty more adventures to come! :3</p>
