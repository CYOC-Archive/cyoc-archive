<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Your not mad?&quot; asked Nancy again.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I'm not mad! I told you that if by some way I could be a horse, well I asked for it and my good dear friend had a way.!&quot; said Tina. &quot;I remember something as you said you were a jenette mule, so you might know how it felt.&quot; wondered Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a mule for an afternoon but just as I was unloaded and put inside a corral with other mules I vanished finding myself back at Uncle Singleton's. It was when I found a pile of clothing the Medallion rolled out, it was the power behind your change to a horse.&quot; explained Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to your Uncle?&quot; asked Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suspect since my Mother called and according to her he was very nervous and tried to change the subject, or blame the train as late. So she took the train down to see him, he vanished about the same time I found myself back at his house. I think he planned some trick for Mother and ended up as a jenette mule or maybe something worse?&quot; replied Nancy with a shrug of her shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to say first of all that you were a good friend for changing me to that Filly. Oh, at first I was scared, but who wouldn't be see, feeling, and having to cope with such an enormus change! It hurt a little when my face changed but otherwise I sort'a felt like a tree growing real, real fast.&quot; Tina said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How was it then, you as a Filly?&quot; asked Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well where can I begin? At first like I said there was fear of being changed. Then as the change finished I felt odd but also very natural. I guess the first thing was getting used to being naked. Now when you or I were human our taught morals of life make us comfortable walking around in clothes. Yet as a Filly I felt overly conscience of the fact my privates were in clear view by all! The swishing of my tail graced the sensual rear parts and offered some covering, but then too my breast became instead tough muscle. As my breasts became teats attached to a small udder, I guess? Anyway after you walked me to Sandy's house the instincts began to set in and break down those human things which make us different than the animals.&quot; Tina tried to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you seemed happy when I visited you the next day!&quot; said Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was that first night when I had the urge to nibble some manure. Then as if something driving me to try I lowered my head and reached for grass blades with those thick lips. To try and bite the grass off is quite the trick and took most of that night to master.&quot; explained Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;But the next morning, you and Pegasus!&quot; said Nancy with a tone of wonderment in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes he came over just after Sandy let the two Palamino horses loose in the pasture. I think my nervous feeling was making me give off pheremones a sign of sensual need to a stallion. Anyway he wondered over and I made no agressive moves, if I had he'd stayed a distance from me. Instead he came over and like a boyfriend he began to lip kiss and nibble while nickering around my face, cheeks, and neck. I accepted his very tender manners and let him explore me from front to flanks. He reached down and in true male horse form nibbled my teats making sure once he got behind me I was willing to accept his advances.&quot; told Tina as Nancy's eyes were wide with wonders.<br />
<br />
&quot;You let him makeout with you&quot; asked Nancy. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was a Filly, a young Thoroughbred horse soon to mature into a mare what else was I there for if not to be bred?&quot; asked Tina.   <br />
<br />
&quot;I lowered my head, its a sign to the stallion of willing submission to his sexual advances. Then being very nervous about being a filly and knowing how big a stallion's penis gets when aroused I shook all over. It was when he came close and sniffed my rump that something in me made my vaginal muscles jump. In a spurt came some female juices which splattered his muzzle making the stallion whinnie. I then got more nervous and my bladder let escape a stream of urine sending poor Pegasus into a seventh heaven. He jumped up and his weight almost pushed me to my knees. he moved forward till his teeth bit into my whithers. I felt his male organ push against my rear about three times before his techinque took over.&quot; said Tina as she sat down next to Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe you let him do that!&quot; said Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was some feeling of what I've heard called the primal need. Even that doesn't describe the female urge and passion for his touch!&quot; replied Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were a virgin, and lost that to a horse, didn't you think about what might have happened?&quot; asked Nancy.<br />
<br />
I didn't care then and I don't care now, no human man could give me the pleasure I enjoyed as Pegasus big cock pressed deeper, deeper, and deep into my body. Then being a horse gave me an ability we humans don't have as I recieved enormus muscle control of the vagina. When pegasus thrust in and deep I relaxed those muscles. As he pulled back and out I clamped down on his maleness making it more sensual. This made him desire the mounting even more as he started humping away with harsh bestial thrusts. It was crude, raw, passion as we both felt it together, his passion mixed with mine. if it wasn't for seeing you standing by the pasture gate with Sandy I might have held my tail up high and accepted his generous pleasuring for yet another round.&quot; said Tina as she had her hand scratching a personal itch.<br />
<br />
&quot;I now that after seeing you with that stallion I left you alone till much later, can you forgive me?&quot; asked Nancy.<br />
<br />
Tina laughed softly, &quot;that was just the beginning, just the very beginning! I learned quickly the life of a filly horse. I was shod, bridled, wore a bit and harness, pulled a cart, and found a common bond between me and those two other horses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But for over a year I let you live as an animal!&quot; chidded Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you have changed me back sooner, I doubt it! I remember your spell and something about me becoming of season before I might return to my once human self, right?&quot; asked Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, once you were in season, then you could change back!' replied Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know a filly doesn'tcome into season until she's about to become a mare at a year old, and even then she might not come into season for a while more. I tell you I as you have had bad periods but being a female horse is far, far, worse!&quot; told Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Worse, how?' asked Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well its kind'a like your standing around day and night, every waking hour as some unknown takes a long feather and traces the wrinkles of your horsey vulva. It tickles, it tingles, never ending and without anything to remove your concentrating on it, the feeling builds and builds. At last after a week or more of no sleep, little food, and a nervous feeling which makes everything all the worse, you stand about day and night in a heavy sweat. You rump itches and nothing one could try can stop this feeling of deep inner neeed, a desire, a passion for blessed relief.&quot; explained Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's being in heat?&quot; asked Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;No there's more! I sweat day and night as those urges build. I try to rub my buttocks against the barn walls, a fence post, or even let Pegasus play and lick at my female parts, but nothing stops the consuming feels.&quot; said Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;He licked you?&quot; asked Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, its normal for a stallion to taste the mare's juices before mounting and being at stud.&quot; said Tina with some sort of inner pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tina, Tina Bayoun, time to come in for dinner!&quot; called out Mrs. Bayoun.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's time for our mid afternoon supper, lets get together tomorrow and talk it all over, OK?&quot; asked Tina.</p>
