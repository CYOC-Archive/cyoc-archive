<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While his mother was able to confidently slip in and transform her good friend, Kyle was having a bit more trouble. Unfortunately Kyle didn&#39;t know any of the people who lived in this house very well so taking an aggressive approach would be more likely to backfire. Since the first floor lights were still on, the dragon-man decided that instead of trying to force his way in he would use a subtle method. Mirroring the incident that put the candies into Mary&#39;s hands in the first place, Kyle set the candies in front of the door and rang the doorbell before hiding around the corner of the house. He listened for the sounds of the door opening and closing before, after checking that the candies were gone from the doorstep, moved over to a window and peaked inside.<br />
<br />
Kyle had arrived just in time to see an older man returning to the living room with the tub of candies. There was an older woman, most likely his wife, sitting on the couch watching television. Unfortunately the sound of whatever she was watching drowned out their words as the man seemed to offer his wife some candies. She refused them and the man rolled his eyes before grabbing a mixture of black and blue candies and tossing them into his mouth.<br />
<br />
As he made to sit down with his wife, the man stumbled as his legs swelled suddenly, tearing his pants and causing him to fall directly into her lap, bent forward awkwardly. Unaware that his fate was already sealed, the man chuckled and went to stand up. His face turned into a look of confusion and then terror as he realized his legs and hips had begun to fuse with his wife&#39;s. As her husband began desperately struggling to free himself, the wife sat paralyzed with terror as she watched both of their legs fuse together, their feet morphing into four-toed dragon claws covered with blue scales.<br />
<br />
The husband meanwhile, had noticed that his hair had started to fall out and when he reached up to feel his scalp, he felt a covering of scales as well as two bony lumps, the start of his horns. Once the last of the hair on his head and face was gone, the scales wasted no time spreading over his entire head, pushing his nose and mouth into a muzzle and turning his ears into simple holes in the process. He went to explore his new head, but found that his arms no longer reached. Panicked, he looked down and saw that his arms had begun to recede into his body, which itself was losing definition and now appeared to be a simple tube stretching out his t-shirt.<br />
<br />
The wife, now recovered from her initial shock, went to stand up on their fused dragon feet, but found herself tumbling forwards as their feet stretched out, becoming digitigrade. As the wife attempted to adapt to the new stance they were forced into, the changes continued up their now fully fused legs. Their calves and thighs grew longer and thicker as the blue scales enveloped them. By the time the scales reached their shared hips, their legs accounted for over two-thirds of the wife&#39;s now ten foot tall stature, and their hips were twice as wide as the wife&#39;s shoulders, causing her still human torso to look comically out of proportion.<br />
<br />
Completely oblivious to their growing size, the husband continued to struggle as his tube-body slowly thickened. The friction between his shirt and his body started out painful, but it gradually turned into a pleasurable sensation, almost like when he masturbated. His eyes widened in realization. Almost in response, his head shifted so that it was connected to his body from the back instead of the bottom. As his struggles grew more intense so did the lustful sensations from his cock shaft body. Slowly his panic abated, replaced with confusion as to why he was fighting this in the first place. His writhing stopped being an attempt to rebel against what was happening and became him trying to maximize the incredible feeling of rubbing himself against his stretched shirt. Eventually though, his growing body brought his shirt to its limit, the garment coming apart at the seams and falling to the floor in tatters. With the shirt ruined, the simulation it provided vanished, leaving the cock-dragon with an aching feeling in its place.<br />
<br />
With desperation in his eyes, he looked up at his wife, now the only one of the pair with hands. Her face was flush with arousal and she was panting desperately, making the answer to his unspoken question obvious. He lifted his shaft-body up to her, allowing her to wrap her arms around him. She then began to slowly stroke him, sending shocks of pleasure through both of them. Unknown to either of them, a scaly blue sack had begun to grow between their shared legs, separating the wife&#39;s transformed vagina and the base of the husbands body. The sack was soon stretched out by a pair of balls that pulsed larger with each stroke of the wife&#39;s arms. As her movements began to speed up, she leaned forward and attempted to kiss him as best she could with his draconic muzzle, tasting the small dribbles of pre-cum that had begun to reach his mouth from their still growing testicles, now large enough to press against their thighs. It wasn&#39;t much longer before both of them tensed up, the wife&#39;s fevered stroking finally rewarded with a shared orgasm stronger than any the couple had felt before. A torrent of cum blasted out of the husband&#39;s mouth, striking the ceiling and creating a rain of jizz that began to flood the room. As if in response to their climax, a thick dragon tail burst out of their tailbone with enough force to smash the wall to the next room.<br />
<br />
The couples orgasm lasted for several minutes before the stream of cum slowed to a trickle. They looked over their new body in awe, any fear or uncertainty long forgotten. After a bit of trail and error, the couple adjusted to walking on their massive dragon legs and left the room, barely managing to squeeze their body through the doorway, and went upstairs to explore themselves in greater detail.<br />
<br />
With the couple now out of sight, Kyle went back round to the front of the house and tried the door, finding that the husband had left it unlocked by mistake. Relived that he wouldn&#39;t need to noisily force the door open, the dragon-man entered the house and waded through the pool of cum that filled the living room. Ignoring the musky aroma that assaulted his nostrils, he retrieved the tub of candies and, after wiping it off on a section of furniture untouched by the couples semen, slipped out of the house. Looking over to the next house down the street, Kyle inwardly hoped that it would provide him an opportunity to deal with the throbbing erection he now sported after breathing in the couples scent.</p>
