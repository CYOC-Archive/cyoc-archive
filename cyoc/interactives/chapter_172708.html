<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was supposed to start as any other Halloween night for me. Sit at home and watching some B rated horror movies for some laughs, eating popcorn along with it. I had made sure to just leave a bowl of candy outside for the trick or treaters, so that they couldn&#39;t bother me with consistent knocking and doorbell ringing. All the pieces were put together to have a sweet night of funny horror movies, all except for the fact my friends had to cancel last minute. Going out with their families, or spending the nights with their girlfriends, it resulted in me sitting on the couch with a bowl of popcorn way too big for just one person.<br />
<br />
Having decided on a movie with a malicious leprechaun killing people that had possession of his stolen pot of gold, I had a blast at the unique ways he finished off his victims within the absurd plot. It was so good, I couldn&#39;t resist and watched the sequel, finding it even better for my sense of humor. And then came the third film, wherein the leprechaun was loose in Vegas. As expected, this film followed suit of it&#39;s predecessors with it&#39;s kills, but eventually the movie came to a halt. <br />
<br />
At this point of the movie, a milf showgal named Laura had made a wish on the gold to make herself look younger and sexier. She looked completely different from her introduction scene, having a noticeably larger chest and butt, slimmer body, and shorter hair. When she encountered her soon to be executor in her casino dressing room, she wore a tight blue dress accentuating her features, with flip flops on her feet. &quot;Weird choice of footwear in that setting.&quot; I had noted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell are you!&quot; Laura screamed at seeing the leprechaun, as she clutched the pot of gold. The short trickster creature laughed and floated around the room, chuckling to himself. It would seem he was about to kill of this character in an ironic way, devising the best was to do so. And that was when he started; with a wave of his hand, the leprechaun started to make Laura&#39;s chest swell in size. She was shocked and dropped the pot, spilling the magical gold all over the floor. This seemed to irk the leprechaun, as he waved his other hand; with this motion, Laura&#39;s ass and lips proceeded to grow as well.<br />
<br />
I was in awe at seeing this woman get what she wanted and then some. Her assets kept growing and growing, as she stared at herself in the mirror. &quot;What are you doing?!!&quot; She shrieked, horrified by her oversexed appearance. She had started crying, as her lips puffed up to perfect DSL&#39;s, with her upper lip big enough to touch against her nose. <br />
<br />
She was struggling to stand, with such an offset jiggling balance. Her instincts must&#39;ve then kicked in, as she tried to wobble out of the room, as her bust and butt kept getting bigger. If I knew cup sizes, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to call her breasts a size ZZ; and her ass cheeks were practically as big as them. Her hips and thighs had grow to accommodate her posterior, and they got stuck against the doorframe, preventing her escape. I could see her still expanding assets were actually splintering the wood of the doorframe from their absolute mass. The camera angle shifted multiple times from her butt to boobs to huge lips, as if showing this sex creature before it perished.<br />
<br />
Looking back it was a weird thing to do, but when it shifted to her front again, I got up from the couch and placed my hands on the screen over her hands. &quot;I&#39;ll get you out!&quot; I shouted, gripping my hands and proceeding to pull. Normally one would just fall back to the floor and be stared at as insane for trying to save a person on a screen. And normally, I&#39;d agree with them; yet this time was different. As I fell back, someone else fell with me. As I landed to the floor, I found my face full of tit, leading me to only one conclusion. <br />
<br />
It was proven when I heard the leprechaun on screen talk. &quot;Eh, where did the lass go? I wasn&#39;t finished with her.&quot; He said, picking up his pot of gold and the coins. &quot;Well, off to punish the rest of those laddies that owe me some coin!&quot; The scene ended with him saying. Reaching over to pause the movie, I struggled to get up to see what had happened.<br />
<br />
Somehow, my attempts at rescuing Laura had proven successful, as I found her lying down on the floor in front of my tv. But even more shocking, was that she was still expanded from her run in with the leprechaun! Her huge ZZ cups tits pressed tightly against her dress to the point it looked painful. Her equally big ass, wide hips and thick supple thighs did the same, showing off her parts just ripe for grabbing. Her plump, thick lips were large enough to cover half of one&#39;s face if she kissed them, though instinct wanted them wrapped around a dick.<br />
<br />
And now we come to my current dilemma. What am I supposed to do with a character from a horror movie that was in my house? She doesn&#39;t have an identity in the real world, and certainly not with assets her size. The worst part was my boner painfully pressing against my pants. Laura&#39;s enhanced body was making my mating instinct go wild; having half a mind to just jump her right now to claim her as my woman. No one would mind since she doesn&#39;t actually exist and count as a person in the real world. I thought my options over as Laura continued crying from how messed up her body had become and how she would be stuck like this forever.</p>
