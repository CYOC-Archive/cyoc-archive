<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Reality has a way of not always operating how you wanted and I should have known this as Sam led me back to her place. Presently our tears stopped and when we reached her place, we found it dark, her parents not home. Sitting in the dark kitchen, we discussed the options we had to choose from.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile:<br />
Cory took off like a bat out of hell down the alley. Twisting and turning through the maze of the back ways of the city, all the while the voices in his head were telling him what a bad person he had been. And when they said he was going to get caught, he stopped and slapped his head and screamed, &quot;SHUT-UP!&quot; Before stuffing the money and what he called the pretties in the pockets of his tattered olive green coat.<br />
<br />
Reaching the place he called home, an apartment above a pawn shop, he thought that he should dispose of the pretties there, but in the morning and the voices agreed. Opening the door, he walked upstairs and let himself into a sparsely furnished apartment. Dumping the stuff on the table, he grabbed himself a beer and went into the bedroom for a bit.<br />
<br />
When he came back out, the voices had subsided for the time being because he had taken a pill and was now wearing a faded pink bathroom. Walking over to the table, he looked at the earrings, was immediately disgusted that they were not clip-ons and instead turned his attention to the ring.<br />
<br />
Looking at it, Cory noted that there was nothing overly special about it; it was just a faded band of gold. Wondering if it was real or just some fake costume jewelry he slipped it on his finger.<br />
<br />
Looking at it, he commented out loud, &quot;Cory's done a bad thing. Cory is going to be punished. But if they did not know about such pretties, they could not punish Cory. They should not know about such pretties; especially the ring. They should forget and have never ever known about it. It should not have existed for them, because it never came to them. They forget about it, all of them except for Cory.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile:<br />
Back at the carnival, Ron and Billy had decided to go on some rides and then had disappeared somewhere, leaving Danny, Jack and Jen to decided to do something. Suddenly a gust a wind blew across the grounds and all the previous memories were gone; all that was left were the ones that told of an odd group of friends. There was Ron the geek and his girlfriend, Billy. Danny, the jock. Jen, who was somewhat into cheer leading. And Jack, the young man who comes from a military family, but mistrusts the government and wants nothing to do with the military.<br />
<br />
All memories of there being anything about a ring and how it changed Rick into Allison the hermaphrodite are gone. Gone as well is the knowledge of what has happened to Tim and his gang. Now there is only the present and this strange group of friends that despite their differences, still managed to come together.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile:<br />
I have forgotten my old life. The only thing I know of any Rick is the time when I was nine and tried to act like a tomboy. I dressed in boy's clothing and tried to pee standing up. It wasn't a problem to pee like that, I do have a penis, it just was really uncomfortable because I was used to peeing sitting down all the time. The other thing that was difficult to adjust to was the problems people had; I had been raised Allison and suddenly I wanted to be called Rick.<br />
<br />
Sometime between six months and a year, I gave up on the idea. Mostly because people couldn't adjust and the fact of my breast buds, which basically reminded me that I'm a woman with a penis.<br />
<br />
And right now I'm spooning with the woman of my dreams, also a hermaphrodite. I had met Sam two years ago and it was like I suddenly understood I was not alone in the world. These thoughts and more raced through my head as I shifted my naked body under the sheets and moved closer to Sam. After a while, my thoughts calmed and I slept.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile:<br />
Cory was unaware that anything had changed. Opening the bathrobe, he tucked his penis between his legs and standing before a mirror, told himself, &quot;Cory could you ever be such a pretty thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Going back to the bedroom, he put on a black skirt, a bra and a t-shirt. Laying down on the bed, he began to masturbate until the voices returned. And when they did, he heard also his mother telling him what a bad boy he was. Slamming his hand against his head, he screamed, &quot;The voices are not there. Cory has never heard the voices, nor will Cory continue hearing the voices. They are gone; nothing at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly he felt better, like his head was clear for the first time since he was about thirteen, which had been about thirty years ago. Feeling clear, not knowing why, he went back to what he was doing.<br />
<br />
An hour later, Cory lay on the bed looking at the ring on his finger. Sleepily he mumbled, &quot;Such a fine pretty. Cory should be a young creature suitable to wear it.&quot; Taking the ring off, he set it on the sheets and drifted off to sleep; unaware of the rings power and what it had done to him.<br />
<br />
As he slept, his short blond hair grew out and past his shoulders and eventually turned dark red, almost black. His skin lighted and turned softer and then he began to shrink.<br />
<br />
He shrank down to a height of three foot five and as this happened his normal weight of one hundred and seventy dropped down to about thirty seven pounds. As his penis and testicles rearranged themselves into something more feminine, Cory shifted and kicked the ring off the bed.<br />
<br />
As the transformation finished and Cory became a healthy six year old girl with no signs of mental problems in her future, the ring dropped to the floor, bounced twice and rolled across the floor.<br />
<br />
Presently it hit a hole in the floor and dropped down to the ceiling of the pawn shop. Bouncing again, it fell into a hole in the ceiling and plinked down onto the linoleum floor of the pawn shop. It would be found by the owner in the morning and not knowing what he found, he placed it amongst the rest of the rings and jewelry.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile:<br />
I awoke to the sun shining through the curtains. Grinning at Sam, I kissed her and before long we both were wearing protection and probing each others vaginas and taking each other anally. Afterward I got up and told Sam I wanted to go home to get a shower and a change of clothes.<br />
<br />
Home, I took a shower and decided I wanted to try something new; if it didn't work, nothing wrong there. I pulled out a pair of low cut button fly jeans out of my dresser and tucking my penis between my legs, pulled on a small, low cut, thong on and then the pants. Standing in front of the mirror, I made sure no strange lumps were pressing out and satisfied, I pulled on a bra.<br />
<br />
Next I insert two breast enhancers into my bra and gave me the appearance of having two C cup size breasts; even though I knew for a fact that I would never have breasts that big and always have two B cups. Pulling on a T-shirt with a V line that exposed my cleavage, I made sure everything still looked feminine and nothing was out of place was showing. After that, I grabbed my denim jacket, purse and as  I put into it a bikini that I kept in zip-lock bag, I thought about how I'd ask Sam if she wanted to go swimming.<br />
<br />
On my way back to Sam's place, I stopped in a pawn shop and thought it might be nice to get her something. Knowing that she loved rings just as much as she loved earrings, I made my way over to the counter with the rings.</p>
