<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maggie Lawson was feeling content; being spooned by her werewolf husband after another round of hot animalistic sex, she was ready for a sound night’s sleep.<br />
“You know we still have the pie and ice cream waiting for us,” Evan tickling Maggie’s nipples as he spoons her from behind. His member still locked in her sex from his knot.<br />
“Let’s save that for after dinner tomorrow,” Maggie purrs; “Spencer would appreciate that.”<br />
“You did take your were birth control pill right,” Evan asking.<br />
“Just after I got home from work,” Maggie yawns; “I’m still up for waiting until Thursday, before we officially proceed to make a new son or daughter.”<br />
<br />
Evan growls as he embraces his wife even deeper; wrapping his arms around her abdomen and placing his meaty paws just above her sex; Evan allows his wife to drift off as he thinks of the sound of tiny feet and energetic children running through a house again.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Samantha and Frances twist both yowled and purred as they each orgasmed. After alternating eating each other out; both finished off their own act of love by simultaneously eating each other out in a sixty nine position. The feeling of their life partner’s tongue in their snatch while probing their respective partner’s was always Frances favorite act to do. The fact that Samantha made it their final for the night was to show Frances how much Samantha loved her.<br />
<br />
“That was pure bliss Samantha,” Frances pants; after licking the honey from Samantha’s sex and inner thighs.<br />
“I know,” Samantha sighs; “come up her and sample your juices still on my muzzle.”<br />
“And I licked all of yours off mine clean already,” Frances looking sad.<br />
“That’s okay,” Samantha answers as she looks her partner in her feline eyes; “this night was just for you.”<br />
“Was this an early Christmas present,” Frances licking and kissing Samantha; “or do you have something else special planned?”<br />
“Oh I have something already planned for Christmas day my love,” Samantha purring; “but that’s not for a while.” Remembering that Saffron and Jasmine were still in their basket, Samantha collects them from her night stand and allows the two kittens to snuggle with the spent were-felines, “now let’s get some sleep;” Samantha kissing Frances as Jasmine and Saffron snuggles in between both and softly purr.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Just as John Shaffer’s knot deflates enough for Jesse to get off of him; Kaley was itching to have it in her. John placing a paw up to stop her and give him a moment, only fueled her lust.<br />
“You want me in you,” John looking at the horny were-panthress; “I want to mount you.”<br />
“Oooh sis, he is eager;” Kaley giggles.<br />
“Go for it Kaley,” Jesse laughs; “our large prize is clearly capable in satisfying our desires and possibly more.”.<br />
<br />
Kaley gets on all fours a raises her rump into the air.  John seeing the werepanthress’s aroused and dripping sex; fuels a lust in him he never thought existed. Running on pure instinct, he places his nose up to the eager hole and inhales the erotic scent coming from the willing female. Licking her sex with his tongue; sampling her juice; John growls in pleasure. He gets up an guides his once again swollen member into the waiting and willing were-panthress.<br />
<br />
Feeling her folds push and stimulate him, as he thrusts in and out of Kaley; Causes John to bite down on the nape of Kaley’s neck. Not to harm her but to establish dominance as he works to bury his knot in her. Kaley feeling the large rod in her and the love bite John gives her, just moans as she rhythmically thrusts in time to John’s. Panting and sighing as her body shudders with multiple micro orgasms; she just stays there. Unable to move as she inhales the arousal coming from both her and the werewolf on top of her; she winces as she feels John’s knot pushing her to her limits. Sensing her snatch has consumed the knot; Kaley feels she will soon explode.<br />
<br />
John lets go of biting the Nape of Kaley’s neck as he feels himself locked in with his knot. Grunting and growling he picks up in tempo with his hip thrusting. Moaning and yowling; Kaley’s can feel her body clamping down on John as her orgasm reaches its boiling point. Feeling resistance, John thrusts even harder, determined to go all the way; he can feel his balls churning and pressure build with in him. Unable to hold back John lets loose a long howl as he explodes in the second twin. Kaley feeling the spasms and twitches from John’s lupine member; her body also explodes, and earth shattering orgasm making her yowl so load it causes several other were panther couples to either wake up from the post sex naps.<br />
<br />
“oh god,” Kaley pants; “that… that was incredible. Oh sis we have to come back to Moon Lake.”<br />
“Well it looks like you got wish,” Jesse grins as she hugs the werewolf still mounted and locked in her twin sister; ”but I want another go.”<br />
“Unfortunately you are going to have to be denied that Jesse;” Benton who witnessed the last of the act; “John’s help is needed to help tear down the pavilion and he does have school tomorrow. Despite his height and stature, he is only fourteen years old.”<br />
“Can it wait,” John coming down from his post orgasmic high; “I’m locked in Kaley and it’s going to be a few minutes before I can pull out.”<br />
 <br />
Benton just nods as he walks away; Knowing that the kid’s anatomy will keep him tied to his mate for a bit he just heads back to tents. Kaley who was still clearly in the throes of her orgasm just mumbles nonsense.<br />
“Your only fourteen,” Jesse looking impressed at the seven foot werewolf as he cradles and supports her twin sister.<br />
“Surprising isn’t it,” John grins as he enjoys the moment; “your sister is clearly pleased.”<br />
“Yeah,” Jesses looking like she was denied a treat; “and now I’ll have to wait for her to come back to reality before we back home.”<br />
“Get your cell phone handy,” John sighs as his knot deflates enough to slowly pull out; “I’ll give you my number so you can call me later. Make sure your sister get my number as well.” Looking at the were panthress collapsed on the ground feeling content; “she is probably going to want another go.”<br />
“But not before I get a good rutting from you,” Jesse trying to help wake Kaley up; “you know I’m surprised Mr. Knight allowed you to leave your duties early. Even more surprised he didn’t snarl at me and my sister.”<br />
“Why is that,” John looking at the twin were-panthress; “he seem pleasant to me.”<br />
“Benton Knight has been known to be less then civil to those that engage in none traditional sex acts. He is a known homophobe.”<br />
“Well I’m not gay,” John answering; “are you two bi-sexual?”<br />
“Not with each other,” Kaley speaks as she starts to come down from her orgasmic bliss; “what did I miss?”<br />
“Benton Knight ending our fun,” Jesse helping her sister up; “John has to go back to work.”<br />
<br />
John watches as Jesse helps Kaley walk off; feeling satisfied in more ways than one, he heads back to the buffet tent to see three young were-panthers ripping into a roast beef with Benton clearly beside himself;<br />
“Frieda,” Benton nearly shouting; “were are you manners?”<br />
“Oh please,” Frieda scoffs; “it’s not as if I’ve caught you raiding the fridge for a midnight snack after hearing you have hot sex with mom. How is it any different with me or my friends?”<br />
“you mean the three have been going at it non stop for a few hours now,” Benton looking shocked.<br />
“We had a short nap,” Spencer grinning, “but woke up hungry.”</p>
