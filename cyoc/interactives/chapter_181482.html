<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tiffany and Princess stood by and watched as Juliet lead the last of her girls away from her family&#39;s home. Princess had been there as part of her student teaching program, and had been running the work for the High School gym classes, which had brought Tiffany some insights into the school that had been built in Animalia and &quot;for&quot; Animalians that she and Princess missed out on because they graduated high school before WSA opened. There were some things that were fairly interesting to Tiffany, especially the idea that students had the chance for adventures in the shows, something she&#39;d never had before, but that was likely more a recognition that with so many Animalians in Lyre/Animalia that those sorts of desires were going to be higher. <br />
<br />
But there were a lot of things that hadn&#39;t really changed all that much. Things like the scheduling for the year was one of them. Like Lyre High, seniors would have their finals and graduate in the and around the second full school week in May and juniors, sophomores, and freshmen would have their finals in the third week of May. If they had a lot of &quot;make up days&quot; for things like snow or something else, they could go into the fourth week of May, which was pretty much the same as how the Lyre School District had run four years before when Tiffany and Princess had been seniors at Lyre High. Tiffany was interested in that, but was back in Lyre more because of it being a weekend and UNLV wasn&#39;t that far from Lyre/Animalia if one didn&#39;t want to make the trip. And Tiffany did want to make the trip, as it was a way to be with her sister, if for a short period of time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure everything will go well...&quot; Tiffany said with a sigh as she followed the Silver Fox Animalian now walking the Black Furred Poodle Animalian of, grateful that Horizon had also provided the vaccine shots to make sure that she and Gigi wouldn&#39;t be contagious with regard to spreading the Animalia Virus. &quot;Or at least not completely well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sensed that too?&quot; Princess asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... she&#39;s supposedly a noble,&quot; Tiffany answered, &quot;so it&#39;s no surprise that she&#39;d be a bit more uptight about things... likely in a way that many of dad&#39;s friends are, but even more so... even if France isn&#39;t a monarchy. That attitude is likely there. Though, I&#39;d think that she is more caring than snobbish about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Caring is good... but she&#39;s going to ultimately find that many of &quot;her girls&quot; are going to find that as Animalians, they&#39;re going to be drawn to things in ways that may not line up with her expectations,&quot; Princess commented, &quot;and as an Animalian, herself, she&#39;s likely going to find that she&#39;s going to be more interested in some of these things on a certain level. Regardless of her good intentions... Not unlike someone I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was a real bitch back then, wasn&#39;t I?&quot; Tiffany gave a sigh as she looked down, remembering on how far she&#39;d come. She still liked being the &quot;eldest&quot; daughter of the richest family in Lyre, but after her accidental conversion, and then ultimately gaining Riley as a bond-mate helped her see things a bit differently.<br />
<br />
For while she&#39;d initially competed hard to get Simon, at least to try and retain her status as Lyre High&#39;s &quot;queen,&quot; she&#39;d ultimately learned a lot from losing that competition with Mary-Alice Wesley, or Malice, as she preferred. It helped her get over things and in dating Riley, and seeing how those that weren&#39;t in her family&#39;s stature lived and were still essentially the same as the others, she&#39;d mellowed in many ways. It was something that let her grow, and in some ways even got her father&#39;s attention a way that hadn&#39;t been there before. Tiffany had her own business ideas to invest in, and while she privately sensed that her father would expect Riley to be the &quot;bread-winner,&quot; Tiffany really didn&#39;t care if he was or wasn&#39;t. He was kind and protective, and despite all his muscle, was very gentle. She wouldn&#39;t give up anything for where she&#39;d come to... and all of that wouldn&#39;t be possible without the start and sisterly love she&#39;d gotten from Princess.<br />
<br />
And that got Tiffany&#39;s mind drifting back to the past...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Tiffany came home from the first day of her senior year at Lyre High in a somewhat foul mood. She&#39;d expected to come into that year with a final hurrah and garnering more attention from the boys in school, a few of which she&#39;d already slept with in her Sophomore and Junior years, thankfully, her mother had mandated birth control pills for years. Of course some of that that was a result of the fact that Tiffany felt her mother was bit more frisky than what she imagined a woman in her late thirties to early forties should, but she wasn&#39;t going to complain too much on that. Her parents kept their sexual adventures in their bedroom, or at least in an area where Tiffany wasn&#39;t and that then in turn lead to them ignoring Tiffany&#39;s sexual adventures. And the start of her senior year in High School was going to continue on that way, she&#39;d be a cheerleader, retain her crown as &quot;queen&quot; and use that to get what would be &quot;needed&quot; to advance through some sorority in college. She might even pick up a boyfriend that would make it to the NBA or NFL... but the school year didn&#39;t start that way.<br />
<br />
It started with a Horse Animalian, who was only a freshman, come into school and garner all the boy&#39;s attention. Granted the Horse Animalian had a bigger bust and hips than most adult women that Tiffany knew of, but she&#39;d also seen the news reports that gave an indication that the Animalians had their rules against inter-species breeding. In this, those boys should not have been attracted to Abby Brown as they were and remained focused on her, but they did, and that left Tiffany feeling a bit frustrated. She only looked up from her frustration as a soft bark was heard along with the clicking of toe claws coming across the hardwood floor. She looked up to see Princess approaching with her tail wagging.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, girl, I trust you had a good day?&quot; Tiffany asked<br />
<br />
Princess barked back and then turned her head back toward the doorway she&#39;d come from, which would ultimately lead toward the kitchen and one area where Princess&#39;s water bowl and food dish were. The white furred French Poodle had been a birthday present when Tiffany entered high school four years before as a puppy, and while Tiffany often shied away from &quot;responsibilities,&quot; Princess was different. Princess was relatively smart for a dog, proved easy to work with, and was easy to talk to when her parents were busy with either social functions or their own horizontal mambo. That was enough for Tiffany to be willing to teach Princess a few tricks and play with her when she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Tiffany wondered as she moved to follow toward Princess who again turned her head toward the doorway and began to walk that way. Tiffany only followed, and eventually made her way through a few hallways to the kitchen where Princess&#39;s water bowl lay empty, and there was no one else in the room. Tiffany almost immediately huffed, &quot;the staff should have refilled your water! I can&#39;t believe this! Ignoring my precious Princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany then set about lifting up the silver dog dish with &quot;Princess&quot; written into it in calligraphy and moved it to the sink and filled it. Once filled she crouched down to place the bowl before Princess. Princess came and started lapping up the water while Tiffany calmly starting patting the dog&#39;s head and neck, marveling at the stylized cut that Tiffany had chosen for Princess. The groomer said it was a prize winning cut, which she felt Princess deserved. Princess lapped up the water eagerly for a few moments, but then paused to look to Tiffany and gave a surprised &quot;yip.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Princess!&quot; Tiffany cried out in surprise as she watched her dog begin to shake and tremble, something she couldn&#39;t just let be. Though about the only thing Tiffany knew to do was to pull the dog into a hug and hold Princess to her. As this happened, she soon felt Princess&#39;s body seeming to change. Princess put her forepaws onto Tiffany&#39;s legs and through her jeans, Tiffany could feel Princess&#39;s paws stretching out as her digits lengthened to become more like Human fingers, tipped with a dull claw. They then lengthened even more. This also lead into a series of other developments that startled Tiffany a bit more. As Princess&#39; hips began to widen to allow for a more Human like stance when standing, this ended up in Princess actually falling forward and forcing Tiffany to fall back. What then followed in Princess then falling on top of Tiffany and actually stretching out a bit more.<br />
<br />
The result of this was that Tiffany found herself getting a mouthful of furry boob. It seemed like Princess was growing Human like breasts that swelled larger with each passing moment and with the nipple sitting right over Tiffany&#39;s lips. Princess yipped again and tried to move, but this made her new breasts jiggle a bit and the next thing Tiffany tasted was milk falling into her mouth. It tasted sweet, but different, and she reflexively swallowed as Princess finally recovered and managed to get up. Tiffany was already feeling warm, for some reason, but could only find herself looking up to the voluptuous Poodle Animalian that Princess had just turned into. It was enough that Tiffany didn&#39;t notice that she was starting grow white fur on her body, and when Princess spoke, that became even more of an issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; Princess spoke hurriedly, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean that... and... how... am I...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany wanted to cry at seeing her Princess turn into an Animalian, as she&#39;d seen some of the news reports about them starting their own community out on the Brown Farm and some of the adjacent ranches outside of Lyre. It was something that would mean she&#39;d lose Princess, but it was only then when a white furred muzzle began to come into view, with a black triangle at its tip. Looking down, Tiffany soon found that it wasn&#39;t Princess&#39; muzzle, it was her muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... no...&quot; Tiffany managed as her shoes began to feel tight as her feet swelled within them. At the same time her bra, pants, and panties were starting to become far tighter than she would have expected them to be. She was already a healthy C cup, but given that she&#39;d turn 18 in a week or so, Tiffany expect to get any bigger in that department. Now, as she looked down her muzzle, she could see them swelling larger with in her shirt, and straining her bra as it struggled to contain her. The worst part though was that she felt something growing underneath her while also wrestling with her growing feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me help,&quot; Princess offered and carefully helped Tiffany get her shoes and socks off while Tiffany managed to get the back of her pants down far enough to free her growing tail. It moved almost involuntarily against the tiled kitchen floor and to Tiffany&#39;s horror, she could feel its movement, as she watched her feet lengthen into the long digitigrade feet that Princess had.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a freak,&quot; Tiffany whimpered, her tone sounding weak and timid and something she&#39;d never show anyone else.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you&#39;re not,&quot; Princess said to Tiffany, and hugging Tiffany to her, privately interested in Tiffany&#39;s hair, even though it was different from Tiffany&#39;s fur and longer ears hanging down from the upper sides of her head, &quot;You&#39;re my sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tiffany could only hug Princess back.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;You had a lot of pride and confidence in yourself... and that isn&#39;t a bad thing,&quot; Princess commented, &quot;and a lot of that I think came more from the fact that mom and dad were often busy in their own work and social climbing. They set one set of expectations that would be high, but didn&#39;t provide a lot of direct guidance... which then lead into your own form of rebellion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A rebellion that drew little attention,&quot; Tiffany commented, &quot;and when it did come... mom I think complemented me more on who I&#39;d slept with than lectured me against it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And she liked Riley,&quot; Princess chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she liked his muscle,&quot; Tiffany answered, &quot;but I still... I had a lot of other growth after becoming an Animalian... and before that growth happened I was rather bitchy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Princess didn&#39;t always like the comparison that Humanity took the gender designation of a female dog as an appropriate metaphor for an irritable female, but then, she would accept Tiffany using it. They were, after all, sisters. And while Tiffany was the more assertive of the two of them, Princess also knew that Tiffany had grown out of the stances she&#39;d held in High School.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I owe a lot of that to Jamie... and even Sarah and Malice,&quot; Tiffany gave a small chuckle, &quot;but the biggest help was the sister who was always there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Princess only smiled in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll stay in touch when you start teaching somewhere... likely with Marvin out golfing,&quot; Tiffany commented referring to the male Corgi Animalian that had gradually made progress with Princess through their time at UNLV and referring to the one sport where Animalians and Humans could theoretically compete against each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you with Riley,&quot; Princess answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but while we&#39;ll graduate in May, Riley has a whole year ahead of him,&quot; Tiffany sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;All time for us to continue to grow,&quot; Princess reminded Tiffany, which Tiffany nodded in agreement at. As they&#39;d both come so far over the past four years.</p>
