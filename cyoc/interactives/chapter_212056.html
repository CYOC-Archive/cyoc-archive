<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was awkward being a furry artist in this neighborhood. People who had seen that sensationalist news story, would give Laura her &#39;sympathy&#39; at all those &#39;filthy degenerates&#39; doing &#39;depraved&#39; art of her. The idea most furries just like the idea of animal-people and weren&#39;t sexual predators was hard for them to grasp. <br />
<br />
But they did know Laura&#39;s parents, and knew they were good people, and so was she. She struggled to come up with art she could show her family. At least being a rabbit girl meant she could get away with showing self portraits at least. After all, it obviously was porn when she was doing art of herself of course!<br />
<br />
Given her body was covered in fur, most clothing just wasn&#39;t practical to her, and her family and neighbors accepted it. She was a person, but she wasn&#39;t human. <br />
<br />
Laura had never had any sense of &#39;not belonging&#39; to her family. She&#39;d just been born looking a little more different than most. <br />
<br />
The remote had done its absolute best to alter reality to accept Laura being a nudist anthro rabbit as always having been normal. It helped human language and human culture was FILLED with the little contradictions that made up civilization, humans were conditioned to accept them.  That Laura was the only rabbit girl in existence should have made her a global news story... or vivisected in some government lab. But the mindless, unthinking, unconscious programming of the tablet connected to the &#39;network&#39; (for lack of better term) of its creators, had gone for a more &#39;don&#39;t think about it too hard&#39; approach. With Laura&#39;s state of being more of an oddity than a shocking impossibility. Laura&#39;s family had their fifteen minutes of fame and had moved on with their lives. <br />
<br />
Plus, the priority filters built into the programming had gone for the path of least resistance in this instance, as this iteration of reality was not likely to stick around for long the Creators of the remote knew. <br />
<br />
Though Laura did have the infamous honor of being among the few who had not only turned off the &#39;users aware&#39; option (the creators would send out an update patch it so it wasn&#39;t easy to turn off by accident, not that Laura would know this, since it was forbidden for the creators to meddle with the options the user chose), but also one of the few to COMPLETELY IGNORE the tiny little question mark symbol in the bottom corner that was the remote tablet&#39;s MANUAL! She&#39;d bought and used tablets before after all, she knew how they worked. <br />
<br />
The Creators figured Laura would fall into one of two types. She&#39;d either splurge several changes at once, then use the tablet again, or she&#39;d start out transforming subjects one at a time and build up from there. Or she&#39;d fall somewhere in the middle. The more ambitious those with their products started out as, the less likely they were to complete their visions. <br />
<br />
Now Laura knew her neighbors personally, and knew none objected to being subjects of her art. She&#39;d done so before. And she most DEFINITELY wanted to try out her new toy some more. Maybe even have some fun with the background option for her self model. <br />
<br />
BUT! Work before pleasure. Her commissioner had been waiting too long as was. Laura had been sick with the flu, and her commissioner had paid in advance. A good commissioner lived by their reputation, and she best follow though on obligations awaiting. On the bright side... this magic tablet was gonna make her job a whole lot easier! <br />
<br />
She&#39;d been skeptical when the old man in the bathroom with glued-on glitter stars had said she&#39;d never spotted his shop in the mall before because he was a wizard and he traveled between universes ... but given how amazing this device was, she wondered if he was a time traveler from the future giving her tech so advanced it might as well be magic? Naw. Why go to all that trouble to make it compatible with machines of the past to make some quick cash in money that might not even be viable in a hundred years? The tablet being made by a wizard actually made MORE sense. <br />
<br />
Laura shook her head and stopped procrastinating and got to work. <br />
<br />
This kinda art was borderline for the kind she&#39;d agreed to make. But it hadn&#39;t been listed on the &#39;will not do&#39; list of her artist profile, and she&#39;d needed the money fast. Maybe that was WHY she was so eager to procrastinate. She&#39;d indulged in &#39;kink&#39; art from time to time, but &#39;kink&#39; meant literally anything, maids, robots, genies, pool toys, pirates, brainwashed to the point of identity-death, petrification, cat-ears folded halfway, you name it, someone somewhere had interest in it. Though that also meant it was easy to miss as BEING a kink to the person who paid for the art. Usually. <br />
<br />
Laura didn&#39;t know anything about the commissioner in real life, not even their name, and that was fine by both of them. Commissioners preferred to not have their identities known most of the time. <br />
<br />
As a file name he wrote down the alias of the user. She was surprised when the default model was of a teenage boy. She wondered if the system had a sense of humor. She began modifying the picture. Aging up the model and changing it to a female, oh most definitely obviously female. Then came the option of species, and she scrolled straight to tigress. Like the machine was responding to her thoughts, the million opinions she&#39;d had before narrowed down to simple things like hair color, eye colored, hair length. Then came musculature, it really was like the machine was anticipating what options she wanted next. She was still surprised when the option of &#39;occupation&#39; came up. She opened up ... and typed in &#39;dominatrix.&#39; Instantly the tigress was done up in leather, and the proper equipment, including the ever-present whip.  <br />
<br />
The background option was next, and she was able to illustrate a &#39;dungeon&#39; with eerie violet and blue lights, and more of the cliche dominatrix gear on the walls. <br />
<br />
She strongly considered putting in a blind folded and gagged skinny male fox like the commissioner had wanted but hasn&#39;t been able to come up with the money for as an apology for the delays... but it was best to keep things professional. A couple commissioners had thought they were automatically friends after she&#39;d done art for them. <br />
<br />
She had her model, now it was time for the art. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Robert hoped ArtBun01 was doing okay, and he hoped she wasn&#39;t upset with him for him sending all those message wondering if she was okay. Truth was that he&#39;d been burned before by con artists who came to his saying the needed money NOW and would draw anything if paid in advance... only to vanish into the void like conmen shall. <br />
<br />
But there was nothing to do but wait. At least ArtBun01 had a gallery full of great art that was all in one style, her account had existed for years, and there were unrelated people who vouched for her, and above everything, she HADN&#39;T come to him like a conman would. <br />
<br />
The fourteen year old didn&#39;t notice as he body aged up to twenty one... or that he parents had married years earlier than planned to compensate, or that their ancestors had been all married just a little bit earlier, spread out through the generations to make this possible. And why should he? He hadn&#39;t been fourteen in seven years. This also meant he&#39;d made completely different friends than he had before, not that he&#39;d ever know this, and so would never miss the friends he never had. <br />
<br />
Nor did she notice as reality changed that she was now a she, and why would she notice something she&#39;d been born as? Going from a geek interested in indie furry comics and media his parents would have a heart attack if they knew he indulged in... to keep her body in shape, and her parents, well... reality changed so there was an exception... after all, their daughter was a professional, she knew how to keep things safe, sane, and consenting. <br />
<br />
Her waist, breasts, and hips shaped into something you wouldn&#39;t seen outside of a hentai manga, but with muscles of an amazon that could break your arms and legs without even trying. <br />
<br />
And while all of THAT was happen... she ALSO didn&#39;t notice a change in species, because there was nothing to notice, because she&#39;d never been human, never been male, never been a submissive geek with fantasies of being a woman&#39;s plaything and catering to her every whim. Now she WAS the fantasy woman. She could wrap men around her little finger easily. She could get them to what she wanted no matter how proud or stubborn. Like toys. She wasn&#39;t sadistic, but she knew it was what they wanted deep down. <br />
<br />
Her third change came as orange, white, and black fur covered her body, familiar strip patterns forming. Her nails becoming claws, a stripped tail growing from the base of her spine, and coiling around her. Her muscle mass even bigger than before. Her head morphed into that of a tigress. The only difference between the intelligence in her eyes, and the long blond hair done in a long braid that reached the base of her tail. <br />
<br />
Rose smiled, wondering how ArtBun01 was doing. She had trust her ability to give her a good artist rendering of her. <br />
<br />
So called experts thought that modern art had risen as a response to the advent of the camera... Rose had seen far too many modern artists continue to do landscapes and paintings of quiet ordinary things to buy such dribble. Art was about what the artist saw. And Rose was curious how ArtBun01 would see her. <br />
<br />
She checked the clock, it was about time for dinner. She was buying tonight. She left her dungeon/bedroom to join her parents in the dinning room. With how good business way, she&#39;d been able to rent her own studio soon. <br />
<br />
As she opened the door there was a beep beep from her computer. Checking, she smiled, a message saying &#39;draft 1&#39;. Rose clicked it open, finding an artist rendering of herself and her room, it was honestly a bit creepy how true to life ArtBun01 had made it, like she&#39;d hacked Rose&#39;s computer camera, except Rose always covered it with tape, so Rose brushed it off as just random chance, as that was clearly the reality of it, and she didn&#39;t need to think more about that. It was freakin&#39; PERFECT! There was no need for any revisions. <br />
<br />
&quot;YES! FINALLY! BEST HUNDRED BUCKS I EVER SPENT!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sis, everything okay in there?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Mira! I told you to stay out of my room!!!&quot; Rose barked. This was another reason she really needed her own studio. Her little sister&#39;s bedroom was on the bottom floor, while she was on the top floor. And the walls were soundproofed and her door had a double lock on it. The sheltered and naive teenage girl didn&#39;t need getting any ideas from Rose. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Sorry! You sounded really happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just got a portrait of me done from someone online.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool! Do you think they could do some art of me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you could fork over the cash, but seriously pipsqueak, go help mom and dad with the table!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir big sister!&quot;  The little redhead girl skipped off. Rose swore, Mira acted like a girl half her age sometimes. <br />
<br />
Rose was sure to send ArtBun01 positive feedback. <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a load off my mind,&quot; Laura smiled at a job well done. The magic tablet was definite the best investment she&#39;d made in a long long time.</p>
