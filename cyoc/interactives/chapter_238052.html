<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The night Andrew spent with Lady Roseblood wasn’t what the vampire prince had expected. Despite what she said, they barely discussed the attempt on her life the night of the ball. She was apparently unconcerned with the allegiances of the attackers or their motives. The second thing, that made things awkward, was their biological differences. Andrew had some coq au vin brought up for them but she didn’t touch the food, in fact she appeared repulsed by the meal.<br />
<br />
“My sweet prince, I am afraid coq au vin will do nothing for me. Neither will sauerbraten, gnocchi di Patate, trockenbeerenauslese, or matcha gateau au chocolat. I am a full vampire…my needs are more…sanguinary.” Roseblood reminded.<br />
<br />
“O-oh. I’m so sorry my lady. I’m so used to eating with my family it must have slipped my mind.” The prince stumbled.<br />
<br />
The vampiress smiled and and made her way towards the changing area.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t you head down to the wine cellar and bring me up ‘Essence de Marie de Bordeaux’. If I remember your great grandfather had an extensive…collection.” She asked from behind the dressing screen.<br />
<br />
“Of course my lady. I thought you couldn’t drink wine, what is it?” Andrew asked before he could stop himself. He knew the answer.<br />
<br />
“The blood of a fair maiden named Marie of Bordeaux. A lovely girl,” she replied.<br />
<br />
Andrew left for the wine cellar. It was dark but his nocturnal senses made torches unnecessary. He moved past the bottle racks of wine and towards the back where a side path led to where the blood was kept. He was searching the wine racks when he became aware of another presence.<br />
<br />
“Andrew, I never expected to see you down here. You and your siblings have never had a taste for these kinds of things…other than Nyx of course.” Dracula said.<br />
<br />
“G-Great Grandfather. I-it’s not for me, it’s for Lady Roseblood.” Andrew replied.<br />
<br />
“Ah, Eveline. I should have known. You are quite smitten with her I hear.” Dracula said.<br />
<br />
“I suppose I am. What of it?” Andrew asked defensively. He was getting tired of explaining himself when it came to his interest in Lady Roseblood.<br />
<br />
“Nothing, I apologize. It was not my intention to offended. It is just…just that she isn’t what I would call tender and kind. Certainly not a woman I would expect my great grandson to be involved with romantically.” The vampire said.<br />
<br />
“Lady Isabella told me the same thing. I know she’s reclusive and kind of scary at times but she’s not a monster. At least no more than others of our kind.” Andrew replied.<br />
<br />
“True, but she is cunning and deceptive. She was even before I turned her. I know you’ve been in love with her for as long as anyone can remember, but just be careful my child.” Dracula remarked and handed him the blood that Lady Roseblood has asked for.<br />
<br />
“When did you turn her?” Andrew asked before leaving.<br />
<br />
“Prince Andrew. I thought your parents raised you to be a gentleman. You never ask a woman her age.” Dracula replied with a sly smile.<br />
<br />
When Andrew got back to Roseblood’s room he saw something that nearly made him drop the bottle of blood. Lady Roseblood had changed out of her ball dress and into a long, lacy black nightie. A deep red, sheer, silk robe. Her wine colored hair was freed from its usual tight braids and cascading down her shoulders.<br />
<br />
Andrew’s heart pounded in his chest as he entered the room. He’d never seen Roseblood like this before - vulnerable, almost ethereal. The contrast between her delicate features and the darkness that lurked within her eyes was both alluring and terrifying.<br />
<br />
“You have the Bordeaux?” she asked, her voice a soft whisper.<br />
<br />
“Yes, my lady.” Andrew nodded.<br />
<br />
He handed her the bottle, his fingers trembling slightly as they brushed against hers. She took it, a small smile playing on her lips.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, your highness,” she said. “You’ve been quite helpful tonight.”<br />
<br />
As she poured herself a glass Andrew couldn’t help but stare. Her eyes, usually so cold and calculating, now held a warmth that surprised him. To Andrew, it was as if a veil had been lifted, revealing a side of her that he’d never seen before.<br />
<br />
“Ah, sweet Marie. She was a vivacious and beautiful young lady.” She mused as she drank.<br />
<br />
When she was finished, she turned to him. “Come closer, Andrew,” she said.<br />
<br />
Hesitantly, he moved towards her. As he drew nearer, he could feel the warmth of her body, the sweet scent of her blood. She reached out and gently touched his face.<br />
<br />
“You are a good man, Andrew,” she said. “A better man than I deserve.”<br />
<br />
Her words hung in the air, heavy with unspoken meaning. Andrew felt a surge of emotion, a mix of confusion and desire. He wanted to reach out and touch her, to hold her close. But he hesitated, unsure of what to do.<br />
<br />
Roseblood seemed to sense his hesitation. She smiled, a knowing look in her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, my prince,” she said. “I won’t bite.”<br />
<br />
Andrew sat next to her and they both looked into each other’s eyes.<br />
<br />
“Have you ever been in a hunt?” She asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I’ve been on several with my brothers and father.” He replied.<br />
<br />
“No. Not one of those hunts…a real hunt, for…sustenance?” She explained.<br />
<br />
Andrew swallowed his nervousness, he knew what she was asking.<br />
<br />
“I, uh—no, I suppose not.” The dhampir answered.<br />
<br />
“It’s exhilarating and freeing. Most Nobles would call it savage. But is it not savage to deny our instincts…our nature.” The vampiress practically moaned.<br />
<br />
Sensing his nervousness she continued, “Have you ever killed before? Killed a human that is?”<br />
<br />
“No. I haven’t my lady.” Andrew replied.<br />
<br />
“But you have thought of it. I’m sure there was a time when you’ve wanted to kill someone.” She then asked.<br />
<br />
Andrew paused for a moment, then his face became more serious.<br />
<br />
“Yes. I have thought about killing someone, a long time ago.” Andrew answered.<br />
<br />
“Why? It couldn’t have been for hunger or pleasure. What made you want to kill?” She asked.<br />
<br />
“To protect my family. To keep anyone from hurting them ever again.” Andrew said as his thoughts went to when he was 10.<br />
<br />
Lady Roseblood’s demeanor shifted, her gaze softened and she looked away. Andrew noticed this and placed his hand over hers.<br />
<br />
“I made a vow that day. I would never let something like that happen again. I would protect those I love.” Andrew stated, his voice firm.<br />
<br />
A knock at the door interrupted the moment.<br />
<br />
“Maid service! Hehe, any sheets need cleaning?!” Isabella’s voice called from behind the door.<br />
<br />
“Uh—s-sorry, you must have the wrong room!” Andrew shouted back turning red.<br />
<br />
He went to the door and silenced Isabella with his hand. He looked back into the room and saw Roseblood turned to the bed, she was in the middle of removing her robe.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps next time Prince Andrew.” She said with a coy smile.<br />
<br />
Andrew closed the door behind him and dragged the blonde dhampir down the hall.<br />
<br />
“Come on, don’t tell me you’re mad. It was just a joke.” She defended.<br />
<br />
“Very mature Lady Isabella.” Andrew sighed.<br />
<br />
“How did it go anyway?” Isabella asked.<br />
<br />
“It was amazing. She was so beautiful and elegant. You could take a few lessons from her.” Andrew said.<br />
<br />
“Don’t get too carried away. It was just one sort-of-date.” She replied.</p>
