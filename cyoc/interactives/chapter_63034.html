<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice looked through the menus on the program and browsed the choices of species. She noticed a fantasy <br />
subcategory, and had an inspiration. Before she had graduated from high school, some of her friends met <br />
occasionally to do role playing. One of her characters had been a satyr, and she remembered how much she <br />
enjoyed fantasizing that she was a satyr herself.  Maybe a very young satyr, since she was now almost like a <br />
little girl.  From her memory, she recalled that young satyrs were called fauns.<br />
<br />
Her heart skipped a beat when she saw faun was one of the choices on the list. She knew she shouldn't have <br />
been so surprised. The list was so comprehensive, half of the mythical creatures weren't even known to her.<br />
<br />
Upon clicking the satyr option, the menu with her physical stats returned. A slider bar labeled &quot;Faun&quot; was now <br />
included among everything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I want to remain the right height for an eight year old.&quot; Alice slid the height bar to 3'8&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Lets see how much this does.&quot;  She slid the bar to 50 percent change.  Then she clicked the save button.<br />
<br />
She felt tickling all over her legs, and instinctively brought her hands down to scratch them. She gasped when <br />
they fell upon hundreds of tiny hairs. She threw off her towel and looked down to see coarse brown fur growing <br />
on her legs. Her feet, swinging in the open air beneath the desk, suddenly shrank, darkened and hardened into <br />
little cloven hooves. The shaggy fur grew into a thick coat that covered her completely from the waist down.<br />
<br />
Alice felt a twitch from the base of her spine and twisted her upper half around to see for herself a pointy <br />
nub that was her new tail. With a newfound reflex, she felt it flick behind her. <br />
<br />
She stood up shakily, trying to balance on her new hooves. She noticed how quickly she got used to walking, <br />
and assumed she must have been given some new instincts to help her adjust to her body. Instinctively she felt <br />
energized as a little kid should be.  She broke into a delighted prance and skipped around the room, enjoying <br />
the feeling of hooves on the carpet. She dashed down the hall into the bathroom to hear the hooves clopping on <br />
the tile floor. It echoed crisply inside the room. Alice smiled gleefully at herself in the mirror. A cute <br />
little eight year old girl stared back at her, an eight year old girl with the lower legs of a goat.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I want to continue this change!&quot;  She thought to herself.  &quot;Why not become faun all the way?&quot;<br />
<br />
Back at her computer, Alice looked around in the program to see what else she could do. Underneath the faun <br />
slider, she noticed a word that said &quot;Details.&quot; Clicking this brought up a window with a bunch of sliders and <br />
fill-in text boxes that corresponded to every single aspect of her new form. Hoof size, fur color, and much <br />
more. Alice was so excited to see the depth of the customization that she squealed in delight. &quot;This is it,&quot; <br />
she said.<br />
<br />
She found a facial features submenu with sliders for every part of her face. Each one was set to the extreme <br />
left, labeled &quot;human.&quot; The right side of each slider said &quot;Faun/Goat.&quot;She slid the slider for ears all the way <br />
over, and horns about 1/4 of the way over.  Finally, she increased the freckles slider significantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, let's see what that does,&quot; she said. She clicked Save again, and felt a weird but not unpleasant <br />
pulling and pinching sensation on top of her forehead. She grabbed a small mirror from atop her dresser and <br />
looked in it.  She had gained a cute abundance of freckles and new long, brown-furred ears popped up from the <br />
sides of her head. She realized she could move them up and down, and spin them a little.  Then she saw the <br />
tiny buds of little horns which had grown atop her forehead.  &quot;Cute!&quot;  She thought to herself.  &quot;I'll look <br />
adorable with these.&quot;  <br />
<br />
In the program, she looked over other options on her main screen. She selected a new hairstyle for herself, <br />
something that would befit a faun's traditional image. She increased the amount of freckles on her arms and <br />
upper chest. Then she pondered the weight slider. She shrugged and clicked it, nudging it up a few pounds. <br />
Fauns were usually seen to be very childish in spirit and in form, so she figured a little baby fat would add <br />
to the perception.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, what's this? I can control where the weight goes?&quot; Alice had clicked on the &quot;Details&quot; underneath the <br />
weight slider, and a diagram of her body appeared with vertical sliders and arrows that pointed to different <br />
parts of her. All of the sliders were at equal settings. She clicked on one and pulled it up, and saw that all <br />
of the other sliders went down a miniscule amount. &quot;I see! Heh, then let's put some of those pounds into a <br />
nice little belly.&quot; She clicked the slider pointing to her stomach and pulled it up. Alice giggled at the <br />
thought of having a pudgy stomach. It probably wouldn't be attractive to most people, but it wasn't like she'd <br />
be living the rest of her life in this body.<br />
<br />
Clicking save, she leaned back in her chair to watch the changes. Freckles appeared like raindrop stains all <br />
over her arms, shoulders, and on her chest near her neck. On her back and shoulders, she felt her hair shift <br />
about. Her hair was already long and matched the color of her fur, but it was very straight. She had chosen to <br />
make it curlier, with more fluff and body<br />
<br />
She also felt an odd sensation as her body became a little heavier. It was mostly concentrated in her stomach, <br />
but even on her arms and legs she could feel the weight gain take effect. Her body's lean form puffed out, not <br />
becoming overweight, but in fact making her look more healthy and well-fed. The big change was in her belly, <br />
which had started out with an inward curve she had always been proud of. Pulling up her shirt, Alice saw that <br />
curve invert as fat deposited itself in her gut. She patted the small bulge, which felt firm and moved little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, let's go bigger,&quot; she said. She coaxed the slider for her stomach up a little more, and this time also <br />
increased her hips somewhat. She clicked save and felt her stomach push out against the hand that was still <br />
resting on it. Now it was halfway to a pudgy pot belly, with a small fold over her waistline. Her goatish hips <br />
inflated almost like balloons, creating a pleasing curve. Alice patted her bigger belly and it wobbled gently. <br />
She could feel the new pounds tugging at the skin and weighing down her body. &quot;This is kinda cute, actually,&quot; <br />
she admitted to herself.<br />
<br />
Alice stood up and looked herself over. She was instantly aware of her extra girth, about five pounds of it, <br />
and adjusted her balance on her hooves. Her thick and wavy brown hair brushed the tip of her little goat tail, <br />
and she brought her arm up underneath it to give it a satisfying toss. She shook her head as the strands <br />
floated down around her new form. &quot;Now I feel like a proper Faun,&quot; she said, smiling.</p>
