<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">'All That's Old Is New Again'<br />
<br />
1689 February<br />
<br />
A tavern in Frostvile was currently occupied by the owner, his bar wrenches, and a very <br />
large number of men with guns who fancied themselves militia men. These were not the <br />
legendary Minutemen of nearly ninety years hence, nor were they the revolutionary quick <br />
response trooper's ancestors or predecessors.<br />
<br />
None of these men were from Glendale, and if they had been the puritans would have <br />
thrown them out on their ears and likely sworn to give them a waste of their own medicine <br />
if they came back.<br />
<br />
The owner merely had his wrenches serve them drinks, as they asked for, as long as they <br />
kept paying and as long as they didn't cause damage. To their credit, they didn't truly <br />
misbehave around the wrenches anymore than any other bunch of semi-drunk men with <br />
an overblown sense of purpose.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we're all agreed then?&quot; Said the large, hairless leader of the so called militia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Roy we are.&quot; Said one of the men with short brown hair and blue eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just me be the first one to get a shot at'em!&quot; Said a scarred blond man with blue eyes.<br />
<br />
There had to be around twenty to thirty of them. Besides being male, over twenty, all <br />
armed, all having had one or two drinks, and now having the same idea lingering in their <br />
heads, there was nothing truly disciplined or organized about them. Their weapons were in <br />
various state of upkeep or neglect, and were not the same models, and their clothes <br />
likewise didn't bare the least to anything resembling a match uniform, and were also in <br />
various states of being clean or dirty.<br />
<br />
Roy said loudly, &quot;Alright then! Then we're going to Glendale! We're going to those witches! <br />
And we're gonna fix'em just like they do in Europe to witches!!&quot;<br />
<br />
The other men all cheered.<br />
<br />
The bar owner said nothing, as long as they paid before they left, and left his waitresses be, <br />
he wasn't about to say anything, it wasn't his concern what this gang of thugs with <br />
weapons did with themselves to a bunch of other women in a town that wasn't even his <br />
own.<br />
<br />
Hardly as one, more like a blob of people that slowly congealed into one direction, the mob <br />
slowly left the tavern, barely remembering to pay. People outside in Frostvile did their best <br />
to ignore them or simply stay out of their way.<br />
<br />
They moved with a parody of military precision, marching along in loose nit columns and <br />
rows like blades of grass in the wind. They ultimately had to stop and rest for a short bit <br />
before continuing onward... even if Frostvile was the closest town to Glendale... it sure was <br />
in the bloody middle of nowhere!!! And Frostvile and Glendale themselves could be <br />
considered to be in a LARGER bloody middle of nowhere until you hit Salem.<br />
<br />
Glendale did however just happen to be in the middle of some major trade routs... thus <br />
how the town was able to exist at all... if one didn't count the original local population of <br />
natives of course.<br />
<br />
The puritans, did not like the mob's presence. Even when Roy began demanding to know <br />
where the witches were, the puritans acted with a sense of distain, not liking these thugs <br />
anymore then they liked.... the nice woman who were taking care of their children for them <br />
out of the kindness of their hearts.<br />
<br />
The thugs barely noticed the way that the puritans eyes turned glassy whenever they spoke <br />
of the witches for more than a second, and how their tone and attitude on the whole <br />
subject completely changed after one second.<br />
<br />
The grunts saw the rune in the middle of town, and instead of avoiding it, kicked, <br />
scrapped, danced, and otherwise messed it up as badly as they could.<br />
<br />
Alice, &quot;DID the rune have any magic at all?&quot;<br />
<br />
Glass Marie said, &quot;No. Not in the least. It was empty. A failure. Less than a ghost. A simple <br />
scape-coat for some and nothing more.&quot;<br />
<br />
They didn't notice how as they had gotten closer to Glendale some of the plants had started <br />
to look a little strange, colors being different than they should have.<br />
<br />
 They also ignored the lupman pops and young teens who were the wrong colors (two of <br />
their numbers was in fact a couple of lupman 'lone wolves').  They ignored their talks about <br />
one mother's litter apparently having given birth to more oddly colored wolves.  Yes, the <br />
felman mating rumors were not about to die any time soon (in fact, for the felman, being <br />
born with fur colors that were considered normal for mundane cats was the lowest of the <br />
low marks of shame one could have and generally did not find mates).<br />
<br />
The clear blue sky was wasted on that day.<br />
<br />
&quot;No strange storm clouds?&quot; Lawrenced asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was far out at sea, from the 'things they would never again talk about,' rather than <br />
anything the witches did. The storm clouds from Kurse only appeared because in spite of <br />
the loss of Lilith, Gaal, and Solome, the curse was effectively at full power again from all <br />
those who had multiplied the game.  The storm clouds over Glendale wouldn't have <br />
appeared until the start of December when the spell within Glendale was effectively <br />
complete and was building up power to spread across the rest of the colony the next year <br />
to repeat the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;The November stage would have had everyone else as fairies, satyrs, centaurs, dryads, <br />
and any other fantasy creature the witch's whims wanted to create, and of course by then <br />
everyone in Glendale would have seen the witches as their one true rescuers from the <br />
bindings of sanity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Previously October would have everyone within increasing an radius of miles having a <br />
slowly more irresistible urge to go to Glendale for some excuse or another and willing to <br />
enact violence to anyone who tried to stop them.<br />
<br />
But since it was the middle of February when the small army of thugs came their way, the <br />
transition of Glendale into what Big Bad Island became was only more or less one tenth <br />
complete. So only plant life had been or was being altered so far, and of course lupman <br />
births who had already been touched by the witch's magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How far did the witch's GET?&quot; Samantha asked remember that island she had help <br />
celebrate it's twisting.<br />
<br />
Glass Marie, &quot;Obviously since Glendale today isn't populated only by insane pixies, the <br />
witches fell before November. But like I said, this was all slow transitions, not steps or <br />
'stages' as I put it before for simplicity's sake. And it could be considered a slowly <br />
expanding ball from the center of Glendale to it's city limit or what would be it's city limits. <br />
It was chaos, it's progress is tricky to quantify.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Qaunti-what?&quot; Lilly asked.<br />
<br />
Alice answered, &quot;To make it work like a math problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot; Lilly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, Marie and her group would spend some months recovering after their disastrous <br />
first encounter with the witches that forced Marie to become a grave robber. Something <br />
she was sure beyond all doubt she was sealing her fate in Hell for. In the meantime forced <br />
to watch Glendale mutate around them as their bones reset and skin regrew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whose bones were they?&quot; Lawrence ask.<br />
<br />
Maddex really, really REALLY didn't like his daughters hearing this part at all, and used his <br />
form arms to cover their ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to ask? The only thing that could reliably penetrate the witches defenses, was <br />
something like the witches themselves... the bones of a witch. And there was only one <br />
witch buried in Glendale. But we are getting, far, far, FAR ahead of ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
The small army of thugs marched to where they were told the witches were.<br />
<br />
<br />
A dark haired Jewish girl was picking flowers that were swirl rainbow colors in front of the <br />
large but incomplete house.<br />
<br />
A dozen or so other children were in the front yard playing, some wearing fancy clothes, <br />
most wearing simple one piece clothing with a cloth and string but never the less looked <br />
happy, and a few going around naked with none batting so much as an eye lash.  They <br />
thugs heard more such noises from inside.<br />
<br />
One of the 'militia' who fancied himself a carpenter when on the job noted the impressive <br />
add-ons to the original modest dwelling with multiple bedrooms added and more <br />
apparently being built at the moment.<br />
<br />
The dark haired Jewish took one look at the approaching army, gasped, dropped her <br />
flowers, and ran inside shouting, &quot;Mama-I mean, Goldwyn! Gita! Griselle!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Children come inside!&quot; Shouted a scared woman with her hair in a series of curls wearing <br />
a normal middle class dress, not something wild and strange like a witch would wear, or <br />
bland like the puritans.<br />
<br />
There were some words of &quot;Yes Antie' Maggy'~!&quot; But the men with guns weren't exactly <br />
listening. The middle class woman retreated inside at once.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're all witches.&quot; Roy said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Said the blond scarred man.<br />
<br />
&quot;We kill'em all.&quot; Said the dark haired man.<br />
<br />
&quot;The brats are all their familiars I'm sure,&quot; Said the lupman. Even a broken clock is right <br />
twice a day. &quot;They die too or they could bring them back to life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Best to kill anyone they're associated with afterwards too, just to be safe.&quot; Said the other <br />
lone wolf. This would have of course included an elderly native American named Joseph <br />
Running-Bear.<br />
<br />
None of the mob protested, and many nodded their head grimly.<br />
<br />
Three adult women emerged.<br />
<br />
One was blond, and was wearing a 17th century century red dress with a black hooded <br />
cape. Around one of her bare arms was a large bright red nearly bowa sized snake. &quot;I am <br />
Gaal.&quot;<br />
<br />
A woman who in life wore an emerald dress and hood identical to Gaal's with long long <br />
black hair that reached her ankles, a black cat at her side, half her face deformed since <br />
birth that resembled a death's head. &quot;I am Gogatha.&quot;<br />
<br />
The youngest of the witches, with no familiar to call her own. Wearing a brown hooded <br />
cape, and ruffled black dress with pearl jewelry her blond hair done in many different and <br />
seemingly random braids like a mad child. &quot;My name is Gomorrah.&quot;<br />
<br />
A 'milita' missing half his original teeth from when a horse kicked in the face in his youth <br />
said through wooden replacements, &quot;Abomination? Place of the Skull? City of Sin?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gaal looked at the gatherings of twenty to thirty men, she didn't look the least bit <br />
impressed. &quot;We are being ready to face a pack of dogs. You,&quot; Gaal said simply, &quot;Are LESS <br />
than dogs! Nothing but curs!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you listen here beotch!&quot; Snapped Roy. &quot;You don't seem to realize what trouble your <br />
in! Now! Are you the witches that have been causin' trouble for this here town-?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven't been causing trouble,&quot; Said Gaal, &quot;We have been liberating, saving, rescuing! <br />
We don't expect shallow and pig headed ADULTS like you to understand!&quot;<br />
<br />
The men all actually looked at each other confused. These women were as adult they were, <br />
some were even older. However,  &quot;You lot have been spreading DEMONS throughout this <br />
here town! Bringing Satan himself here! And we're gonna send ya right to em!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a lie!&quot; The jewish girl screamed running out putting herself between the witches and <br />
the mob. She put her legs together and put her hands outward like a cross in a pathetic <br />
attempt at a barrier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joella get back!&quot; Shouted Gomorrah shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;They aren't spreading demons! They aren't bringing Satan here!&quot; Joella said with absolute <br />
truth. &quot;They're HELPING PEOPLE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Roy raised his musket and cocked the hammer.<br />
<br />
Joella felt her body freeze as her eyes widened. She was just a deer in his sights. <br />
<br />
There was the sound of thunder.<br />
<br />
The musket ball flew straight for between Joella's eyes.<br />
<br />
In the split second it took for the bullet to fly it's path, it bounced off a solid wall of <br />
invisible mana. The ball of lead hit the dirt harmlessly in a small cloud of dust. <br />
<br />
Everyone, EVERYONE was dead silent, staring. Except Gogatha, glow in hers and Herodias <br />
eyes very visible. <br />
<br />
The children, those that were able to care, peaked from around corners or out windows, <br />
some beholding the different directions the next few moments could take in a hundred <br />
possible futures. Benjamin and Magdalena hugged their daughters, Benjamin thinking of <br />
where he put his own hunting rifle in a futile hope of warding off this danger to his wife <br />
and children. <br />
<br />
Joella blinked as she realized she was still alive. <br />
<br />
The 'militia' just stared dumbly at what happened. The logical conclusion of attacking those <br />
armed with the powers of Hell now slowly trickling into their minds along with the tinkle <br />
down some of their trousers. <br />
<br />
Gogatha swore wind flaring up around her showing off the skeletal side of her face that <br />
actually startled the men even more! &quot;No one. No One! NO ONE! NO ONE HURTS JOELLA <br />
YOU FILTH!&quot; <br />
<br />
Glass Marie spoke, &quot;If the bullet had made contact, and Joella struck dead, Gogatha and the <br />
combined power of her sisters and their charges and familiars would have turned all the <br />
men's brains into feces and left their corpses for scavengers.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Joella lived, and so did what in the witches mind was a tiny sliver of mercy.  Joella <br />
looked at her foster mother, and ideal being that Joella was, did not as a normal human <br />
would, and instead pleaded with her foster mother to spare them. And so in the witch's <br />
minds, they did.&quot;<br />
<br />
The witches' eyes glowed, the familiars' eyes glowed, and the eyes of the children save <br />
Joella also glowed. <br />
<br />
The first to notice what was happening was the two lupman whose precious custom made <br />
rifles for their oversized and clumsy hands turned into solid wood and rust, sprouting <br />
leaves. This caused all the other men to look at their weapons seeing them turn to <br />
branches which they quickly dropped. Roy went straight for his bowie knife and charged. A <br />
small bolt of lightning from Gomorrah's fingers made him drop it and nearly electrocuted <br />
him. <br />
<br />
The next thing the men noticed was their clothes aging a hundred years in under a minute, <br />
decaying in dust before their very eyes! Some screamed and covered themselves. Some <br />
turned to run away or charged for a desperate final attack but tripped over their own feet! <br />
<br />
&quot;You do not deserve this gift in the least,&quot; Gaal said, &quot;But you're adults, you can't HELP but <br />
the the way you are, so we'll free you all from this horrid version of you!&quot; <br />
<br />
And then, it was like time itself was rewinding for the horde of angry men now scared for <br />
their lives. They got smaller, shorter, losing muscle tone, baby fat returning, features <br />
becoming softer, rounder, hair becoming lighter shades.  Many fell on their rears in shock <br />
some just stared at themselves or others.. and began giggling at the sight of each other. <br />
<br />
Even as they shrank they looked at each other, noticing the lengthening hair, the <br />
packaging between their legs inverting on themselves and pulling backwards becoming a <br />
vagina. It happened to four in five, or five in six, it wasn't like any of them were bothering <br />
to count. <br />
<br />
Over half of the girls and boys also saw their hair changing colors, and giggled at the sight <br />
pointing at each other: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet, -Pink-! Their eyes <br />
changing color to match! Their collection head of from above looking like a rainbow <br />
almost. <br />
<br />
The dark haired man looked at the scarred blond man. They began swatting each other <br />
blaming one another, soon however, it became a clapping game. <br />
<br />
The song 'Patty-Cake' wouldn't be written for about ten years, but they made due.<br />
<br />
The dark haired man from before as 'he' continued to regress her still dark hair grew longer <br />
and braided itself into a simple pony tail.  The blond haired boy next to her continued to <br />
play with her even if 'girls were icky' she was fun anyway. <br />
<br />
The man with no teeth got them back, and got green hair and began prancing about.<br />
<br />
Ones who tried to run away soon forgot what they were running away from exactly after a <br />
few steps and instead began a game of hide and seek. <br />
<br />
The two lupman also squabbled and then began to play with each other rough housing.  <br />
<br />
One of the lupman pup's features became less broad and more slim before they regressed <br />
past the point of there being a difference in appearance between ages. The other lupman <br />
pup also went from being 'bald' and grew dirty blond hair so long that she was almost a <br />
lupman Rapunzel. <br />
<br />
They kept getting smaller until all were a uniform year and a a day younger than Joella. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiii.&quot; Said the girl who had been at the very front of the little cute horde with pink hair in <br />
a bowl cut. She came up to Joella and the naked girl stuck out her hand, &quot;I'm Rosalie. But <br />
call me Rosy, I'm not very sure where I am right now, or what's going on, or where I came <br />
from, but I really want to be your friend, wannabe?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joella stared for a moment then nodded and hugged her. <br />
<br />
An hour later or so later Joella was wearing a 'captain's hat' from who knew were but was a <br />
gift from her mothers. The still mostly naked horde of new children and two pups stood at <br />
attention at best they could as they played the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who do you love? Who are your sisters? What's our goal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We love aunt's Goldwyn, Gita, and Grissle. We are each other's sisters! Our goal is to bring <br />
happiness and peace to the entire world!&quot; They all cheered together and laughed! <br />
<br />
&quot;I am loath to say it,&quot; Maddex's heads said and one actually looked away, &quot;BUt those men <br />
are about the victims of the witches I feel the LEAST sorry for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty, Lawrence, Alice, Abbey, Samantha, Lilly, Casandra, and glass Marie, or Marie-Eliza <br />
(as was her middle name and that of her mother's), all nodded.</p>
