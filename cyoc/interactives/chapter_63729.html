<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rain went to and opened the door, Daniele following closely behind.  Standing there was a college-aged young <br />
man with an angry look on his face.  He would have been handsome, Rain noted, had he not been holding a blood-<br />
soaked rag over his nose.  &quot;Can I help you?&quot;  She asked, hesitantly.  He pointed accusingly at Daniele.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm here to have a word with the redheaded bitch.&quot;  He said angrily.  Rain looked back at Daniele, who stared <br />
at the man with a cold fury in her eyes.  &quot;You broke my fucking nose!&quot;  He shouted, attempting to enter the <br />
house.  Rain got in his way, attempting to block his entry.  'This sorta thing was a lot easier when I was <br />
Sean...' she thought to herself.  <br />
<br />
She could feel Daniele pushing against her back, sandwiching Rain between the two.  &quot;You groped my sister you <br />
shit!  You deserve to have more than that broken!&quot;  The shouting continued, accusations punctuated with words <br />
like 'cunt', 'cockstain', 'whore' and 'babydick.'<br />
<br />
&quot;ENOUGH!&quot; Rain shouted, loud enough to divert their attention for half a second.  &quot;Clearly, something is going <br />
on here that I don't know anything about, but we're going to get it settled, and I mean RIGHT FUCKING NOW!&quot;  <br />
They both quieted down, glaring angrily at each other, but waiting for Rain to speak.  &quot;Daniele, you go <br />
first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniele smiled sourly at the boy, and started up.  &quot;Well, when I told you that I grabbed Misty and got out of <br />
that bar after she downed all those shots?  Well, the frat boys followed us outside.  Clearly, they got the <br />
wrong impression as to our intentions and got a bit...grabby.  That's when this idiot grabbed Misty and <br />
started groping her breasts!  So I pulled her away and gave this shit something to remember me by.&quot;  She <br />
cracked her knuckles for emphasis.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's fucking bullshit!&quot;  The boy shouted, &quot;One, common courtesy dictates that when somebody buys you a <br />
drink, you at least say hello.  That tequila wasn't cheap, and me and my bro's just wanted to get to know you <br />
girls a little better. So, she downs our liquor and gets dragged out the door by her sister, and we all say to <br />
ourselves 'What the hell?'  We follow to find out what we did wrong, and then she fell into my arms and I <br />
caught her!  I didn't fucking grope her!  And besides - even if I had, she didn't complain about my hands on <br />
her body.  She was moaning like she wanted it and giggling as she stared at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I see a pretty girl stumble in her heels, about to go down and hit the ground, and I catch her.  And her <br />
sister breaks my nose?!  That's what I get for being a decent guy?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Daniele, despite being a full head shorter than the interloper (even in her heeled boots) rushes back to him, <br />
getting within a few inches of his face.  She hissed, &quot;Your hand was down her fucking shirt and she was so <br />
drunk she didn't know what was happening.  And then you follow us home?!  In other parts of the country, that <br />
kind of behavior would earn you a night in jail and a restraining order.  Your lucky all I broke was your <br />
nose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain sighed.  She was sure that the truth was somewhere in the middle of the two stories, but frankly, she was <br />
too tired and too annoyed to even bother sorting out the details in her own mind.  All she knew was what her <br />
friend was telling her. 'You groped my sister!' rang out in her mind.  And despite the fact that Rain herself <br />
had only existed for the better part of a day, and that Daniele and Misty had only REALLY existed for the <br />
better part of an hour or so, Rain felt a weird connection to her friends.  Moreso than when they had been <br />
Sean and Jay and Dan - like, they were truly sisters.  And sisters needed protection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Rain said, with more than a little irritation in her voice.  &quot;We're going to find some way to <br />
resolve this to everyone's satisfaction.  What's your name?&quot;  She asked the boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;My bro's call me Slider.&quot;  He replied, his voice calming down a bit from it's previous angry timbre.  Daniele <br />
looked at Rain quizzically, but let her continue talking.  Rain was churning on the inside, hating everything <br />
about this boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Slider?  Look at me - tits, pussy, long hair, fingernails and makeup.  I'm not one of your 'bro's.'  So <br />
what's your real fucking name?  She asked, soaring past annoyance and into genuine anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chris Smith.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay - Daniele, take Chris to the living room and then meet me in the Kitchen.  I'll get us all a couple <br />
drinks and we'll talk this out.  Chris, what would you like to drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris thought about it for a second. &quot;Miller Lite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have Miller Lite.  We drink good beer in this house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Bud Lite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Coors Lite, then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain was getting mad.  &quot;Are you fucking kidding me?  I know you're a frat guy, but fucking really?  Have you <br />
never had a good beer in your life?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris seemed deep in thought for a second longer.  &quot;PBR then?&quot;  Rain massaged her temples with her fingers as <br />
she walked into the Kitchen.  &quot;I'll find something for you...just...don't touch anything.  Danni, meet me in <br />
there once he's settled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain walked towards the fridge, trying to decide which of their decent beer collection to waste on the <br />
neanderthal in the living room, finally settling on a German Hefe - Franziskaner.  She grabbed a Stone <br />
Ruination IPA for herself and an Indian Wells Orange Blossom Amber for Daniele.  &quot;I can't believe you're going <br />
to waste good beer on him.&quot;  Daniele fumed as she stomped in the kitchen.  &quot;He's lucky I'm not calling the <br />
fucking cops on him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rain sighed, handing Danni her beer.  &quot;If you called the cops, you'd be in just as much trouble for hitting <br />
him.  But it doesn't matter, because soon everything will be just fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Asked Daniele.  She had taken a sip of her beer, admiring the orange aroma wafting up from <br />
it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean I'm going to use the Chronivac program to fix it so that he's our friend.  Remember the old saying?  <br />
'An enemy is just a friend you haven't changed yet.'&quot;  Rain grinned wickedly, taking a mouthfull of beer and <br />
savoring the piney hop flavor and aroma before letting it flow down her throat.  'There's another saying,' she <br />
thought to herself, 'Power Corrupts.'  This thought was quickly squashed by the more rational part of her mind <br />
categorizing how much more interesting her life had gotten since she had found the program.  For her part, <br />
Daniele looked at her friend skeptically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Earth to Rain: That program is impossible.  There's no way it actually works - you can't just change people <br />
and things however you see fit.  YOU. GOT. SCAMMED.  And besides, even if it did, Misty wrecked your laptop.  <br />
You can't use it anyways.&quot;  Daniele reminded her.<br />
<br />
Rain grabbed Chris' drink and began to start towards the living room.  Feigning ignorance, she said &quot;Well, I'm <br />
pretty sure it does work - it came with instructions and an emitter and everything.  That's a hell of a lot of <br />
capital to invest in trying to sell a scam product.  And the laptop just needs to dry - I'll check it in an <br />
hour or so, excusing myself to 'use the bathroom' and if the laptop is sufficiently dry, I'll use to program <br />
to change 'Slider' into something more suitable for us.  You always talked about wanting a triplet, right?  <br />
Twins works so well, triplets must work even better?  Or maybe a new friend in the house?  Perhaps a maid?  A <br />
male sex slave?  A female one?  A butler?  Or even a dog or a cat.  Hell, if we want to turn Slider into a <br />
shelf or a statue, we can do that too.  You don't seem to understand how far we can go!&quot;  Rain was getting <br />
excited thinking about the power she had.  Well, more than excited.  She was getting...horny.<br />
<br />
Daniele was looking at her as though she had gone off the deep end, so Rain calmed down and took another sip <br />
of beer, attempting to appear nonchalant.  &quot;Besides, if you're right and the program is a scam, then Chris <br />
gets to spend the night drinking with two hot girls - three, if Sunny comes home early.  If need be, when he's <br />
too plastered to remember what's going on, you'll kiss his boo-boo and make it better.&quot;  Daniele started to <br />
object, but Rain interrupted.  &quot;Look, it's either we do this or he calls the cops and you get arrested for <br />
assault.  We need to keep him drinking, and that means we drink - be a big girl, bury the hatchet, and drink <br />
your medicine!&quot;  Rain clinked her glass against Daniele's and stared at the redhead expectantly.  <br />
<br />
Reluctantly, Danni brought the glass to her lips and, in salute, drank a hearty mouthful in tandem with Rain.  <br />
They put their best fake smiles on and went back to the living room.<br />
<br />
<br />
Several hours later...<br />
<br />
<br />
Rain stumbled into her room.  The previous three attempts to bring the laptop had resulted in nothing.  'Maybe <br />
the fourth time is a charm,' she thought to herself.  As she sat down on her chair, attempting to boot the <br />
laptop up, she was greeted with a POST beep.  She clapped her hands together excitedly (drunkenly) and waited <br />
for the OS to boot back up.<br />
<br />
After several minutes of navigating and ensuring that the laptop was back to working order, she opened the <br />
Chronivac program to see the last set of changes made - Daniele.  Unfortunately, Rain couldn't seem to find <br />
Dan's original profile (or that of his drunk friend, now the new Misty), but she shrugged, figuring it was in <br />
a recovery file or somewhere else on the laptop.  'Besides,' she thought, 'Danni seems happy.  What's the <br />
worst thing that happens if I can't find it?'<br />
<br />
She loaded up the current active profiles - Daniele, Misty (currently sleeping), Chris and herself.  She <br />
figured that, since Sunny was out of range, she was no longer considered an 'active' profile.  Selecting <br />
Chris, she thought about what she wanted to do.  &quot;He can't remember what heppened tonight, but other than <br />
that, the sky is the limit...&quot;<br />
<br />
