<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On Saturday, Jeff/”Amber” wakes up, “man,” the “girl says, stretching, “I haven’t slept this good for ages. Sleeping as a girl is way more relaxing and comfy than as a boy! I should sleep as a “Amber” more often.” When she turns her head to look at her Alarm, her eyes widen, “damn, 12am already,” she says, “I’m supposed to meet Tyler at the park in two hours. I have about an hour to get ready, so I should get cracking, I don’t want to keep him waiting.”<br />
<br />
“Amber” jumps out of bed and hurries into the bathroom, the “girl” strips out of her nightgown and turns on the water. Once the water is warm enough, she steps into the shower, when “Amber” starts to rub bodywash on her body, she can’t help but be amazed at how sensitive her skin and especially her breasts and private area are. “Je-Jesus… I wonder if all girls are this sensitive, or if it is just Jane’s body that is hypersensitive,” the “girl” says to herself.<br />
<br />
After the shower, “Amber” dries herself off and dry blows her hair, then she uses her mother’s flat iron to smooth out her hair. She then heads into her room, in hair naked glory, since she is the only one in the house, and starts to pick out an outfit. “Amber” decides on the following: a blue lace bra and matching panties, and since it is supposed to be a very warm summer’s day, she decides to wear a blue knee length bodycon dress with short sleeves. Once dressed, Jeff/”Amber” checks herself out in her mirror, “damn, I look stunning,” she says to herself, “he… if I were in my normal body, I would be all over myself.” Jeff/”Amber” giggles at that thought, unaware that the outfit is the perfect outfit for a date, in her mind she is not going on a date, she is just meeting up with a kind boy, that’s all. While looking at her reflection the “girl” tilts her head in thought, “should I keep my hair open, should I wear make up and maybe a necklace,” she asks herself.<br />
<br />
After a while, “Amber” decides to leave her hair open, “I haven’t put on make up before,” she then says, she looks at her watch, “I still have time to watch a tutorial on YouTube, to at least do descent job.”<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Amber” sits down at her Laptop and opens YouTube, she soon finds a tutorial make up video and starts to follow the advice of the YouTuber. After ten minutes, “Amber” has managed to do descent job, she looks at herself in the mirror and nods satisfied, “man, with all the make up on,” Jeff/”Amber” says, I no longer look like a 14-year-old girl! I look more like a 20-year-old woman,” she says to herself, “bloody amazing what a little bit of make up can do. Now for the final touch: a nice little fake diamond Pendant… aaand… we are ready to go!”<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Amber” puts on her black Mary Jane shoes, then she grabs her handbag with her purse  and exits the house, as she walks down the street towards the bus stop, the “girl” is wondering if she shouldn’t have made herself look so… sexy. ‘What if Tyler gets the wrong idea,’ Jeff thinks to himself, ‘I really don’t want him to think I am trying to “impress” him, I don’t want to send him the wrong signals.’ Jeff/”Amber” gets on the bus, she notices every boy’s head, even the heads of grown men, turn to stare at her. The “girl” heads right to the back of the bus and huddles into a corner, ‘man, all those eyes on me,’ Jeff thinks to himself, regretting his decision for making HIMSELF look so stunning. “Amber” lets out a sigh, ‘welp, I can’t head back home and change, I’ll be late. I should relax, if Tyler assumes anything, I can simply set things straight,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I’ll just say, that it was the only outfit I could find, that looked good enough. And that I am not interested to start a relationship just yet, that I just broke up with my boyfriend and that I still need time to overcome it.’ The “girl” lets out a sigh, ‘come on Jeff,’ she thinks to herself, ‘there is no reason to be nervous, you’ll come up with something. You don’t want a boyfriend, you are not gay! Besides, “Amber” won’t be around anymore after the weekend is over.’<br />
<br />
When “Amber” arrives at the park and walks through the gate, she can’t help but feel still a little bit nervous, ‘I just hope Tyler does not get the wrong idea,’ she thinks to herself. She then remembers, Tyler and her hadn’t made out where to meet, she starts to wonder how she’d be supposed to find Tyler when she suddenly hers a voice call her name. “AMBER, OVER HER,” when she turns, she sees a smiling Tyler standing by a small fountain, “Amber” takes a deep breath, ‘here goes nothing,’ she thinks to herself, starting to walk up to the boy, who by the way is at least a head taller than her, ‘no backing out now.’<br />
<br />
The second Tyler had spotted “Amber”, he could not believe his eyes, ‘oh… my… god,’ he thought, ‘she looks AMAZING!’<br />
<br />
“Amber” stops in front of Tyler and puts on a small smile, “hey Tyler,” she says, “so nice to see you again.”<br />
<br />
Tyler smiles back, “ye-yeah,” he says, blushing a little, his eyes darting all over the “girl’s” body, “it… it is great to see you again.”<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Amber” notices Tyler scanning her body, ‘is… is he checking me out,’ she asks herself, ‘nah… I bet he is just amazed at how good I look… y-yeah that must be it.’ The “girl” lets out a couch, “ahem… Tyler,” she says, “are you done looking at my body?”<br />
<br />
Tyler jumps and blinks, “ye-yeah… yeah,” he says, tearing his eyes from the “girl’s” breasts and looking into her eyes, “s-sorry… y-you just look so amazing,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Amber” lets out a giggle, “don’t worry, Tyler,” she says, “I guess I should have put something… less… “stunning” on. I have to admit, I kinda overslept, and this was the best I could grab in the hurry.”<br />
<br />
Tyler shakes his head, “n-no… the outfit is perfect,” he says, “um… ha-have you thought about something that we could do? I… I have a few ideas… um… su-suggestions.”<br />
<br />
‘Man, he looks and acts so nervous,’ Jeff/”Amber” thinks to herself, ‘makes him kinda cute… wait: WHAT AM I THINKING?! Did… did I just call Tyler “cute”?! N-no… must have imagined it… I am NOT gay!’ The “girl” then looks at Tyler, “not really,” she says, “we could go and eat some ice cream, or just walk around and talk. I’d like to know more about you.”<br />
<br />
“Ice Cream sounds nice,” Tyler says, “um… yeah, I’d love to know more about you too. I was thinking… m-maybe we could go and see a movie?”<br />
<br />
“Amber” thinks for a while, “I haven’t been to the cinema for a long time,” she says, “I would be interested. What kind of a movie do you have in mind?”<br />
<br />
Tyler smiles, ‘this date really is going really smoothly,’ he thinks to himself, unaware for “Amber” this is not a “date”. The boy then says, “there is a romantic comedy movie “Something from Tiffany’s” or… we could go and see the “Black Adam”.”<br />
<br />
Jeff/”Amber” thinks for a while, ‘I don’t want to watch some kind of romance… he might get “ideas”,’ she thinks to herself. She then looks at Tyler and smiles, “I kinda would like to see “Black Adam”,” she says, “I have heard that it is supposed to be amazing.”<br />
<br />
Tyler smiles back, “hehe… I thought you’d prefer something… less romantic,” he says with a chuckle, “yeah… I prefer “Black Adam” myself. So, let’s first grab us an ice cream, we can get to know each other more and after head to the 8pm show. I believe four hours is enough to at least learn more about each other, right?”<br />
<br />
“Amber” smiles and nods, “sounds like a plan,” she says, so both head towards the café located near the park to get some ice cream, before heading back into the park and sitting down on a bench and start to talk.</p>
