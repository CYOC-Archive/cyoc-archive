<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;When you bigger then me you didn’t want to dance. So I better make you younger then me.&quot; Mandy reason as she selects the baby character on the screen.<br />
<br />
With a sudden jolt of feelings. Jake found he was a lot bigger now. Still in a diaper but much bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two.&quot; Mandy said as she saves the game then switch off the computer. She walked over to his crib after computer’s power was off.<br />
<br />
Jake supposes that meant he was two years old now. To test his theory he stood up. Yes, he thought I can stand again on my own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Mandee.&quot; Jake piped in a baby voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oldwer.&quot; Jake said point at the computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. No. I want you to play with me.&quot; Mandy said as she stretched out her arms for him to climb down into. Jake easily slipped over the bars and with Mandy’s help made a soft landing on the carpet with his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Timmee?&quot; Asked Jake said as soon his feet touched the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh, He still slweeping.&quot; She said as she put her finger to her mouth then she took his hand and leads him out to her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plway what?&quot; Jake asked as they enter the hallway going toward her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;House silly.&quot; Mandy answer back as they enter her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;You going to be the baby and Timmy is the daddy when he wakes up.&quot; Mandys explain as she shut the door.<br />
<br />
With door shut tight, Jake had no choice as Mandys drag a box out of her closet. He was too small to open the door. Jake knew he could reach the handle, but he could not turn the knob.<br />
<br />
Mandys proceed to open the box and pulled out her biggest doll clothes. Jake was dress in a blue button shirt and bonnet before he knew what happen. Mandy had finally found what she was looking for. She then pulled out a baby’s bib for him to wear. Mandy knotted twice as she tied around his neck.<br />
<br />
Feeling like an over dress doll Jake only sat there while is pretended to spoon feed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lookee, Daddy is home.&quot; She said when Timmy came into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Playing house?&quot; Timmy asked and already knowing the answer. Mandy would play the same games over and over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup and your the daddy.&quot; Mandy said then handing him a hat to wear. She herself had on a big round pink hat with flowers and matching dress that went down to her feet. Jake thought Timmy was very funny when he put the hat on. It slipped all the down past his ears. Rim of the hat was barely above his eyebrows now.<br />
<br />
None of children notice that Jake and Mandy’s mother peak in on them. Upon seeing such an adorable site she ran back down the hallway to get her camera. They quietly creep back and lean her body into view with the camera ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cookies!&quot; She said. When they all smile at the word and look at her. She pushed the button on the camera.<br />
<br />
Great white flash hit their eyes and spots of light were still dancing in front of them when she took one more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! We trying to play house.&quot; Mandy said with an irritated tone of voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; She said then lean back out of the room and closing the door behind her. Another hour of playing house pass before all three was very bored. Then they played nearly ten rounds of Sorry. Mandy was winning nearly every game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lunch!&quot; Jake heard his mother say from somewhere downstairs.<br />
<br />
Unable to undo the knots that held his bib. Mandy left it on Jake as they went down the steps. All other clothing was put back in the box before they left the room.<br />
<br />
Jake was happy to see it was chicken fingers and there was one for him on a small plate. After Jake’s mother lifted him into the high chair. He barely fit now in it. She cut up his chicken into small squares and sets them in front of him to eat. He uses his fingers to eat while Mandy and Timmy used forks to eat their chicken fingers.<br />
<br />
Mandy was little jealous when her Mom cut up her brother’s chicken and then lets him eat with his fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I use a fork?&quot; Mandy asked when she saw her mother cut up another chicken for Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because your big girl, honey.&quot; She explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jakey doesn’t have to use a fork.&quot; Mandy said to show her point.<br />
<br />
&quot;He’s baby dear. He doesn’t know how yet.&quot; Her mother said as she put the pieces on Jake’s plate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Upmfh.&quot; Mandy said then went into pouting look as she watches Jake use his fingers again.<br />
<br />
This gave Jake an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oldwer!&quot; He said then pointing at Mandy.<br />
<br />
&quot;That’s right, Jake. Mandy is older then you.&quot; His mother congratulated him.<br />
<br />
After lunch all the kids were back in the living room. Mandy did not play as much with the toys her mother bought them as she normally would have.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jake, I am the baby of family. Come with me.&quot; Mandy order then taking Jake by the hand. She left Timmy alone to play while climb they climb the steps.<br />
<br />
Their mother was too busy cleaning up to notice two the children left for the nursery stash computer room.<br />
<br />
Mandy turned on the computer then selected baby Jake character in the game. In a blink of eye Jake found himself back to his 7-year-old self again.<br />
<br />
&quot;My tuwn.&quot; Mandy said. In another second were 5-year-old girl was sitting a 2-year-old girl was with pink trim diaper on that had ruffles in the back.<br />
<br />
She keeps the aware function on the entire time she made the changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I babee.&quot; Mandy said as she looks at her young body and diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup. You are.&quot; Jake said with smile as he helps her down off the seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better change your bed to a crib, Mandy.&quot; Jake said as he moves the mouse to her room in the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okee.&quot; Mandy said and looking toward her room.<br />
<br />
After a few more change to his own room. Jake selected the character ‘friend 1’ and keeps his age the same, but put aware on before hitting OK button. Jake did a quick save of the game and then waited.<br />
<br />
After a minuet he noticed nothing had happend. He guessed that when Timmy was regressed that he lost his memory forever. He then aged Tim to 7 again, but clicked unaware. He noticed Becky reaching for the keyboard. He got there just in time to stop her. He set her to unaware and took her back to her crib.</p>
