<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It didn&#39;t feel like Ty was left with a lot of good options. He started by leaning over the wall to confirm his suspicion. Erica was down at the bottom of the wall somewhere, with a snapped rope and tattered climbing equipment, but she was much too far away to hear anything he said, and she probably couldn&#39;t even see him. As he watched, Erica turned away from the wall and began to storm off, likely in search of Aaron and Stella. Looks like he was on his own.<br />
And beside, if what this fox-boy was saying was true? Ty was going to need a lot of help to finish his quest, and he seemed like a powerful ally to have.<br />
With his mind made up, Ty gave the other teen a resolute nod. &quot;Uh, alright, then. If that&#39;s what it takes to take out this &#39;Raunr&#39; of yours, I&#39;ll let you turn me into a girl.&quot; He raised one hand to uncomfortably scratch the back of his head.<br />
&quot;Oh, simply delightful!&quot; The fox-boy jumped a little bit in excitement, clapping his hands together. His heavy uncut cock bounced slightly, but he didn&#39;t even seem to notice. &quot;Now, this will get a little messy, so just trust me, alright? It&#39;s all ancient magic out here, so we&#39;ve got to follow the ritual, hm? Start by bending over.&quot;<br />
Ty raised his eyes in a questioning look, but the young kitsune didn&#39;t refute himself or even smile to make it clear it was a joke. With a resigned sigh, he turned around and bent over the wall, spacing his feet about shoulder&#39;s distance apart. Immediately, he felt his mage&#39;s robes- though, on second thought, they were really more of a dress- being hiked up around his waist. Soft fingers then wrapped around his cloth undergarments, pulling them down around his ankles and revealing his bare ass to the mythical kitsune standing beside him. Ty felt nothing except the soft, cool winds on his exposed ass, lightly-haired balls, and flaccid cock for a few seconds, before the unfamiliar sensation of a slender finger, newly-damp, probing into his virgin pucker.<br />
Ty winced and shuddered in surprise. &quot;I-is that really n-necessary?&quot; He mumbled, feeling his tight hole clench around the invading finger in instinct.<br />
&quot;Oh, very much, so.&quot; A second finger slipped into Ty&#39;s pucker, making him wince once more. &quot;Ancient, mystical magic, forgotten through the ages, et cetera.&quot; Ty really couldn&#39;t look over his shoulder thanks to the heavy robes hiked up around his waist and back, but he thought he might&#39;ve heard the kitsune let out a little cackle of amusement.<br />
The young wizard&#39;s concerns were cut completely short when those fingers slipped out of his ass, and were replaced with something... thicker. Ty&#39;s jaw dropped in surprise as he felt a thick cock press into his hole, claiming his virginity in seconds and spreading his passage all the while. He felt the kitsune lie over him, with the fox-boy&#39;s chest pressed against his back, and that cock forced itself deeper into his asshole. Then, he began to thrust, slowly at first, but soon building into a rapid pace. Ty gasped out as his own cock hardened, somewhat involuntarily, with every drive into his prostate, and every slap of those heavy, hairy balls against his own smaller pair.<br />
Ty&#39;s eyes drifted shut and he let out a soft, feminine moan. Before long, the fox-boy&#39;s thrusts picked up, slamming his hips against the mage&#39;s and driving balls-deep constantly. Ty felt his own cock throb as he reached orgasm without any direct contact, spurting his cum onto the stone wall and down in the inside of his skirt. Before long, the kitsune joined him, driving especially deep and letting out a deep, animalistic grunt as he, too, came, releasing his sticky load deep into Ty&#39;s tight hole.<br />
<br />
The kitsune didn&#39;t remain buried for long before he drew out and stepped back, smirking to himself. Ty panted heavily to himself and slumped down into a crouch, using the wall for leverage. After a minute or two of heaving breathing, he glanced up at the fox-boy in confusion. &quot;You...you didn&#39;t transform me into a girl.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, damn. Must&#39;ve forgot.&quot; His words were kind, but far from sincere, and that glint in the kitsune&#39;s eye only supported Ty&#39;s suspicion. Still, the nude boy stepped forward and raised one hand. He chanted a few words in some language Ty had never heard, and his fingers glowed in a vibrate blue light.<br />
An odd discomfort rushed through Ty&#39;s body, and he felt a wave of nausea hit him like a truck. He fell onto all fours, shuddering and shivering as the magic worked its way through his system. His now-flaccid cock burned as it began to shrink, receding into his crotch, soon followed by his balls. A new wave of fiery pain rushed through him as his skin split, and a new cunt emerged, a soft shade of pink and slightly damp. Then, the magic all faded, the pain disappeared, and Ty was left, newly female. Except...<br />
&quot;Wait, you didn&#39;t give me breasts?&quot; Ty raised one hand to his flat chest and frowned. He didn&#39;t really mind that much- in fact, it&#39;s possible he preferred the minimum change possible- but it seemed to defeat the point. &quot;Raunr won&#39;t even be able to tell I&#39;m a girl.&quot;<br />
The kitsune waved his request off with a little shrug. &quot;Oh, no worries. Raunr will like you all the same.&quot; That mischievous look returned to the kitsune&#39;s eyes, and he broke out into a little cocky smirk. &quot;Of course, if you&#39;re really that worried about it, I know a way I could give you some...&quot;<br />
Ty was just about to tell the mystical fox to fuck off when his eyes reached that uncut cock, flaccid, thick, and heavy, between the male&#39;s legs. An intimate heat rushed through his body, and he felt his brand-new cunt clench desperately, already dampening between his legs. He stared at that cock in a new light with a new perspective he&#39;d never really experienced before. It wasn&#39;t just &quot;equipment&quot; or whatever, it was a piece of beauty, an object of worship.</p>
