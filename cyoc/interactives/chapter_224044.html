<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before the madness from &quot;The Incident&quot;, I was just an ordinary teenager who was out shopping with my girlfriend. If I hadn&#39;t been dragged out to help Leah, my girlfriend for over 5 years, then I would&#39;ve still been a guy. <br />
<br />
But I&#39;m getting ahead of myself here. Let me tell you a tale of my first step into Loli-hood, and how much it sucks to be one.<br />
<br />
Prior to the comet crash landing into the mall, releasing an unstoppable virus that affected everyone, I was called Steve. During the summer, I was well known as &quot;Steve the Shark&quot; due to my aggressive swimming ability in nearly any swimming category. Hell, I even got a scholarship because of my swimming and would&#39;ve easily been in the Olympics given enough time. As such, my body which I had worked hard for years was fit and toned, with just enough muscles to show off to my girlfriend.<br />
Speaking of my girlfriend, Leah didn&#39;t change much from the virus. She was already short, to begin with (5&#39;4&quot; to my previous height of 6&#39;1&quot;) and thin as well. In fact, a lot of people thought that Leah was still a kid because of how youthful she looked and how she acted, never knowing that she was 17.<br />
<br />
Leah was bouncing ahead of me, walking from storefront to storefront to find some last-minute presents for our friends and family, with me carrying various bags full of goods pulling up the rear. We were both dressed up for winter, with me wearing jeans, a jacket, and a beanie hat while Leah was thickly wrapped up in a long, puffy jacket that covered her leggings and a hairband to hold back her hair. &quot;Come on Stevie, we need to get to the Bath & Body Works to get something for my sisters!&quot; Leah was basically pulling me like how a kid would be grabbing their parent&#39;s hands and pulling them to what the kid wanted.<br />
<br />
At that point, we heard a shatter of broken glass above us, with the comet smashing its way through and landing in the fountain. The same fountain that my girlfriend and I were standing not 10 feet away from.<br />
<br />
There were already people who were standing or sitting by the fountain, which would make them &quot;Patients 0&quot; for everyone who interacted with them. Whatever the comet was made out of, it released a fog of pink gas when it hit the water. Soon enough the miasma began to flood the mall with its pink smoke, like the worst gender-reveal party ever.<br />
<br />
I guess it is like a gender-reveal party, since the guys that were caught in the gas, yours truly included, were transforming into gals. I didn&#39;t have time to run away from the pink cloud, it was bellowing out too fast for me to run. I can feel the fumes flowing into my lungs and enveloping around me like a heavy blanket. I was coughing like mad from the inhalation of the smoke and even though I could no longer see Leah, I could still hear her coughing in the fog along with everyone around us.<br />
I reach out my hand toward the sound of my girlfriend&#39;s coughing, in an attempt to not be separated, but I can barely see my nose in this colorful smog. Then the transformation happens.<br />
<br />
The first clue of my transformation was that I could feel my clothes getting bigger on me. While I could also feel my body shrinking, I blamed it on the fact that the thick cloud was very dense and that it lay heavily on top of me. I tried to bring my hand to my face, but the fog made it nearly impossible to see without placing it inches away from my eyes. <br />
Another clue that something was wrong was that my hair was growing out of my beanie hat. I usually keep my dark hair short for swimming and low maintenance, but the cloud from the comet has basically said no to me and made my hair grow like crazy. My black hair exploded out of the beanie hat, cascading down from my scalp to my butt like a midnight waterfall. I grab my longer locks and bring it up to my eyes, confirming that it is my hair and that it looks very feminine on me.<br />
<br />
But what really set in stone for me that my life as a guy is over is that I can feel myself swelling inside my jacket, transitioning my pecs into breasts. While my workout does include utilizing my pectoral muscle for faster swimming, the miasma has affected it to grow even more. Even if I can see myself changing, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that I&#39;m bigger than Leah. <br />
Second by second, my womanly tits have grown tighter and tighter within my zipped-up jacket while getting longer in the sleeves for my little hands. Soon enough, my once loose jacket became taut with my tittie flesh and it hasn&#39;t ceased it growing. I whimper in my now cuter voice at my increasing boobs, rubbing my shrunken hand against my unyielding knockers through my jacket. Even when my breasts have unzipped my jacket, nearly breaking the zipper along the way, they still haven&#39;t slowed down from their expansion. And then, when my expansive breasts&#39; conquest has made me wider than tall, with each tit big enough for me (without the boobs) to comfortably fit inside, they finally stop.<br />
<br />
There were other notable changes that happened to me; from my face becoming much girlier, to my muscles disappearing from my body, and even my sausage having been turned into a clam. While I was upset with all of those losses (with my penis most of all), they can never beat the most notable change which is my breasts and that I am now 4&#39;3&quot;.<br />
<br />
And then the fog fades away. The gas from the comet has successfully transformed everyone in the mall and then vanished. Maybe it escapes into the atmosphere or perhaps it saturates itself into the water. In either case, the people were infected with the virus that had transformed them and now being able to see themselves for the first time.<br />
<br />
Once I can see more of my surroundings, all I can see is young girls. Granted, they were young girls that had some odd characteristics on them, but I can see that they are in fact, young girls. I can see young girls with different animal ears, young girls with animal parts, and even some of the girls looking straight out of a fairy tale. <br />
<br />
I looked at where my girlfriend was and all I saw was a young girl made of purple slime. She looks a bit like Leah from years ago, back when we were children. She was even wearing her puffy jacket but wore it like a dress. But that is where the similarity ends. The slime girl who looks like Leah is much taller than me and she is made of slime. <br />
<br />
The girl I deduced that it was Leah turned her head to look around her, probably in an attempt to find me amidst all of these girls. What she didn&#39;t mean to do was to keep turning her head around in a complete 360 turn, just like an owl. She then looked down and saw me. She oozes her way toward me since she doesn&#39;t have legs anymore and says in her younger, slimy version of Leah&#39;s voice &quot;Steve?&quot;</p>
