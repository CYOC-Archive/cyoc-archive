<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><center></center>Neither girl knew how much time passed as they sat in silence, both pondering and plotting over the situation while trying to ignore the pungent pheromones hanging in the air.<br />
<br />
The building tension in the room broke as Rhianna let out a high-pitched giggle, “it really is that simple, isn’t it?”<br />
<br />
Janine lifted her head back up to look at Rhianna, her stiff body audibly crackling in the process, “what is?”<br />
<br />
“You’ll see for yourself, but first, let’s get you in something more fitting.” Once again, the pendulum swung,<br />
<br />
<br />
<center>“I’m wearing a magical top that Rhianna gave me when I first started filling out, it’s always clean and fits me perfectly. By adjusting it, I can limit how much of my figure I show off and shift the rest of my clothes to match… oh, and I’m still wearing underwear”</center><br />
<br />
Once again, Janine felt the cool air caress her body for just a moment before new material appeared around her. Down by her legs, black strands of spandex snaked around her thighs, up her hips, and across her shapely butt, forming a stretchy pair of boyshorts that still showed off a swollen sex despite the thicker material. <br />
<br />
Further up Janine’s body, narrow rolls of cloth, like bandages, began to unravel as they orbited around her boobs, slowly encasing them in material. Despite appearing as haphazard binders, they behaved like a seamless piece of material, grasping and lifting her chest with such delicacy that Janine could barely feel them at all.<br />
<br />
Not that Janine was paying too much attention down there at the time. She clenched her teeth in an attempt at stifling a moan as pleasure bounced around her head in waves. New memories flashed behind her eyes as the wording of the change warped her very history. The old Janine had been mocked for her height growing up, of course, but now she was a good five years ahead of even that. The comparison with her so-called peers was downright comical. <br />
<br />
But with that, came memories of Rhianna, not as a distant sneer across a hallway, but as a shoulder to cry on. Janine’s attraction to the other girl mixed with these new feelings of intimacy to form unrequited love; only to fester, bolstering her resentment. Janine could never be one of the beautiful people like Rhianna, and when Rhianna had to choose between her and the sycophants… it wasn’t even much of a choice for her, was it?<br />
<br />
As Janine swirled in conflicting emotions, she ended up spitting out the first thing that came to mind, “needed another excuse to peep on me, eh? If you wanna rub one off to me so bad, just wish me naked or something and get it over with!”<br />
<br />
Rhianna slouched into her chair with a pout, “hmmm. I suppose I got a little too optimistic after you opened up to me. Still, we’re on a closer wavelength than you know. That binding is just the right style for what I’ve got planned next.”<br />
<br />
“Somehow I doubt that. Even if we are… were friends… now we… used to be… we couldn’t be more different from each other. And what the hell are you planning anyway? This isn’t helping either of us.”<br />
<br />
“Of course we’re different, in fact we’re opposites,” Rhianna stood up, and again made that sexy strut over to Janine. But this time, instead of looming over the tormented girl, she stepped in and sat down, straddling Janine. “But I’ll make you my equal as well.”<br />
<br />
The ever-changing outcast on the bottom was stunned, frozen in place by all these tantalizing sensations. The warmth, and feeling of Rhianna’s heavy breath inches from her face, the touch of her hands on Janine’s bare shoulders, her piercing blue eyes, her shimmering hair, the rise and fall of her perfect breasts, practically touching Janine’s own; and the steaming wet heat of her sex, very much rubbing against Janine beneath the cheerleading skirt. <br />
<br />
Janine’s bitterness buckled against the full weight of sensuality thrown against her. Her escalating disaster of a brain practically dribbling out her ears as her heart began pounding, and her entire body turned beet red. Though time soon resumed as Rhianna reached down to Janine’s back, pulling at two strands of the ‘makeshift’ bra.<br />
<br />
As the bindings tightened, the magic did its work. Rather than disappearing, her feminine features seemed to be compressing and hardening. Breasts becoming an almost flat, solid pectoral board; cushions of fat on her thighs and ass coiling into steel cable as her legs were smashed back together by collapsing hips. Finally, her legs and spine contracted, forcing her height back to a ‘mere’ 6 foot, albeit with more normal proportions. Aside from her face, she looked downright boyish now.<br />
<br />
As expected, the transformation stimulated many of Janine’s most sensitive areas. Yet some part of her brain, perhaps still tethered to life pre-magic-pocket-watch, insisted she resist splooshing directly on her… rival? Thankfully, her new memories acclimated her to the feeling of this change, at least, keeping her off the edge.<br />
<br />
Not that Rhianna seemed to care, as she insisted on touching the shrinking girl’s body all over as it changed, feeling the flesh move and reshape under her hands, even lightly grinding against Janine’s thighs as the gap closed itself. Still, she waited for the transformation to finish before resuming her speech.<br />
<br />
“I thought I could make you into someone who could naturally fit in, but you were made to stand apart, so I’ll make sure you stand out.” With each sentence, Rhianna’s breathing grew heavier, her voice trembled more and more, “As I embody social hierarchy, you shall move where you please. As I am order, you shall be my chaos.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, what?” With Janine’s newfound insight into Rhianna, this actually made less sense. But the look in Rhianna’s eyes made it clear that the cheerleader’s brain wasn’t calling the shots anymore. <br />
<br />
Before Janine could regret her plan’s inadvertent success, down came the watch,<br />
<br />
<br />
<center>“I don’t reject femininity, but my style and mannerisms are masculine enough I can be ‘one of the guys’ if I want. Keeping up, even with jocks, is easy for me thanks to winning the genetic lottery. I have the agility of a gymnast, the brute force of a powerlifter, the tone of a bodybuilder, and the curves of a porn star to bo-oooot….aaaaaaaaaaaa<b>AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!</b>”</center><br />
<br />
If her age-up had been a fireworks show, this was nothing short of a nuclear bomb. Every cell in her body was molten steel, blooming and expanding with incalculable heat, yet not a single sensation existed to her outside of pleasure. There was no resisting this. There were no distinct climaxes, but an open floodgate, ruining both girls’ underwear, and only sparing the rest of them by virtue of Rhianna’s skirt. There were no cries of pleasure, only a wordless, primal scream; only stifled as Rhianna plunged in, her tongue probing every inch of Janine&#39;s mouth as she frantically made out with her changing victim. <br />
<br />
The binders held, hiding the incoming curves for now, but it did nothing for the rippling muscles forcing their way to the surface. Both girls were raised slightly off the seat as swelling glutes substituted her suppressed booty. The ropes tying her arms and legs fought back against the growing girl at first, biting into flesh before giving way against unyielding muscle, fraying within inches of breaking outright. Her entire body radiated power, and was hard as stone even beneath silky-smooth skin.<br />
<br />
Rhianna was eventually forced to come up for air. While catching her breath, she watched in glee as a golden tan spread across the new tomboy’s skin. It wasn’t the deep bronze Rhianna had been picturing, but it showed that Janine’s new life included plenty of time in the sun…<br />
Including some spent naked, if the lack of tan lines were anything to go by.<br />
<br />
This lasted twice as long as any transformation, but eventually began to wind down as a light jacket (unbuttoned) and cargo pants (unzipped) stitched themselves together over Janine’s soaked form. <br />
<br />
Janine slumped back in her chair, silently trembling. Some rational corner of Rhianna’s mind wondered if the intensity of the transformation fried Janine’s brain in lieu of knocking her out. But no, Janine’s eyes were silently locked in a piercing gaze, first towards Rhianna, then towards the swinging watch.<br />
<br />
<br />
<center>“The magic top Rhianna gave me eventually became a part of me, letting me control it like a new muscle. Not only can I adjust it, but I can make it disappear and reappear now too. Sometimes I do poses in front of a full mirror, wearing only the top, while changing. Just watching it happen, in either direction, can bring me to the edge without a touch.”</center><br />
<br />
Jolts of pleasure traced from Janine’s shoulder-blades and up her back as live nerves and dead fabric bonded. But, still reeling from the last transformation, it barely registered to her. All Janine could force herself to focus on was the women on top of her, and the swirling cloud of base impulses directed at her.<br />
<i>Want… Love you, fuck you, wed you, hurt you, worship you, kill you, become you, destroy you…</i><br />
<br />
A slight tensing of Janine’s body was the only outward sign that the transformation had worked, but it was enough for the girl on top. She gingerly lifted Janine’s head back up, and whispered, “Come on, darling, you know what to do.”<br />
<br />
Even if Janine had the will to resist at the time, she wanted, needed, to see it for herself. As she extended her new limb, her brain interpreted this new exertion as if she unfurling a pair of wings from her back.<br />
<br />
The bandages began to loosen, and Janine began growing, but far more drastically than she shrunk. <br />
“more, more, more, more…” she began muttering, almost mindlessly as skin and fat formed to compliment her newfound muscle. The spectating prep found herself tipping back in her juicy seat as Janine’s rear once again bubbled out, further accentuated by flaring hips that began to hang off the sides of the chair. A thin, yet pillowy-soft layer of fat encased the two skyscrapers of muscle contained in her thighs; and skyscrapers they were, as Rhianna’s eyes seemed to be able to trace Janine’s still-elongating legs for miles. They even retained just enough open space to display her pubic mound swell with the same softness.<br />
<br />
“Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes….” Janine’s mantra grew louder, even her binders began expanding in fits and gasps as her breasts ballooned out to keep pace. Soon, Janine’s mountainous mammaries began to press against Rhianna’s own bosom, teasing them both as daintily covered nipples danced wobbly circles around one another. But these new Amazonian boobs proved to be nearly as unstoppable as the rippling pecs beneath, and the increasingly-dwarfed woman on top had to hold on to avoid being pushed off the chair.<br />
<br />
“Yes! Yes! Ye-EEEES!” Janine’s body squeezed with the force of a beartrap as she reached yet another orgasm, spraying directly inside her mistress-apparent. The same explosion of force tore the ropes around her arms to pieces as they shot up triumphantly above her head.<br />
<br />
For an instant, fear shot through her alleged friend, believing the tables had finally turned. But that fear was replaced by both curiosity and renewed arousal as the bandages disappeared, exposing Janine’s perfect breasts in all their glory. One tree-trunk of an arm cupped and fondled this new flesh, as the other delicately traced each segment of her washboard abs. <br />
<br />
Indeed, while she remained nominally aware, her mind was still too addled to do more than marvel at her new form for the moment. Soft and billowing as a cloud in all the right places, and sculpted into an impervious monument across all the rest. Even without her magical bra, she could tell her boobs could stand perfectly at attention without issue. Yet the silky skin gave way and deformed beneath her fingers so easily, squishing like bread dough. Even having grown a bit, her hands (still dainty, despite strategically honed patches of callous) were too small to fully cup their new size. So big, in fact, she couldn’t properly ogle the rest of her midsection.<br />
<br />
But she could feel it, <i>oh</i> could she feel the limitless vitality radiating just beneath the surface. Waves of untapped power, ready to be unleashed in whatever form she saw fit. As unstoppable as an earthquake, as sudden as lightning, or as elegant and smooth as the wind and tide, her body could do it all. Janine felt like she could do anything now.<br />
<br />
And yet, her eyes once again fell helplessly upon the swinging watch.<br />
<br />
<br />
<center>“There I go. I will stay seated and keep my hands to myself until you are finished with my new self.”</center><br />
<br />
This prompted barely any feeling in Janine, save a jagged edge of shame forcing her back to lucidity, knowing she had just been defeated by her own horniness. Janine re-summoned her binder, but rather than contracting herself back in again, she simply wrapped her arms around her chest to separate them from her leering counterpart.<br />
<br />
Said woman finally stood up from Janine’s lap, deciding on her next words even as she fought the urge to just fuck Janine then and there. Rhianna figured it was hers for the asking at this point. But it would have to wait. Janine’s body might be perfect, she wasn’t Rhianna’s masterpiece just yet.<br />
<br />
She needed a mind to match, along with a few other details.</p>
