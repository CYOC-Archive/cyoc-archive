<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A young girl of 9 was laying in a bed, semi-bored this evening. Alyssa was on vacation with her parents to their family&#39;s summer lake house. It was an absolutely beautiful location right at the edge of the forest and a decently sized lake. She definitely had fun, but she&#39;s just a kid, so even her own enthusiasm for nature had its limits, and the extremely spotty service certainly didn&#39;t help. It was so bad, that she couldn&#39;t watch any of her videos that she&#39;s used to consuming. On the bright side, this was the last night of vacation.<br />
<br />
The sun was starting to set finally, and her parents were gone for the evening and most of the night at a grown up only event. Her parents thought Alyssa was very mature for her age, so they weren&#39;t worried about their daughter getting into any trouble. And they were mostly right.<br />
<br />
Except that she was texting her friend Jane. Now Jane wasn&#39;t a bad girl per se, but she, as Alyssa&#39;s parents puts it, &quot;gets into trouble too much&quot;. The service, while bad, was fine enough to text and slowly send and receive pictures, so it was Jane&#39;s idea to text Truth or Dare.<br />
<br />
&quot;lol that was embarrassing alyssaaaaa truth or dareeee&quot; the text read. Alyssa thought for a moment and typed &quot;truth pls&quot;. A soft moment of waiting, and Alyssa received a text saying &quot;who r u crushing on&quot;<br />
<br />
Alyssa squirmed a bit as she thought about Enrique at school. He was a grade older than her and they discovered that they were each in the scouts (girl and boy scouts respectively), and they bonded over learning about each others&#39; activities there. Most boys were pretty icky, but he was always so very nice. Alyssa shook her head out of her daydream as she sees a new message containing a &quot;?&quot;, getting the hint that she was taking too long. &quot;that boy a grade up enrique&quot;. Alyssa sent it and flipped her phone upside down as her heart beats a bit faster from admitting that. She only looked back at her phone once the notification sound was heard. &quot;oooooooo i knew iiiiiiiit u wanna kiss him?<br />
<br />
Alyssa, not wanting to talk about it any longer just texted back, &quot;truth or dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ill take a truth this time&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;if u could have anything right now, what would it be&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;i want u to pick dare the next time i ask. its the entire reason i suggested this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alyssa rolled her eyes as Jane asks her truth or dare again, to which she responds with, &quot;ur parents are still gone right? u should sneak a glass of one of the grown up drinks&quot;<br />
<br />
Alyssa&#39;s Daddy was an avid whisky enthusiast, and he made sure to have a good supply of whisky everywhere he&#39;s at. She&#39;s never had any of that stuff, nor did she have any interest, but she felt obligated to comply, especially since Jane did do her last dare.&quot;ok ill do it&quot; and as she placed her feet on the ground, Jane sent another message saying, &quot;and make sure to take pics&quot;<br />
<br />
Alyssa quickly walked to the kitchen and searches for an opened bottle of whisky that she could sneak. Unfortunately after a little bit of searching, there was only one that was opened. In the fridge she spotted Skunk Spray Whiskey. Just a few hours ago, her father poured the first glass of the bottle for himself, but didn&#39;t get to drink it, as he tripped and dropped the glass and all of its contents. By the time he cleaned it, he and Alyssa&#39;s Mommy had to run out.<br />
<br />
Alyssa grabbed one of those tiny glasses and carefully poured the whisky. She took a selfie of her holding the shot glass, and then lifted it up to her lips. She took another selfie right as felt the liquid pass her lips. She swallowed the entire contents at once and was immediately met with an extremely uncomfortable and intense burn. She dropped the glass and her phone (thankfully neither broke) and coughed heavily as she fell to her hands and knees. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, time seemed to flow extremely slowly as she looked down at at the floor, her head very dizzy, vision blurring, watching black fur grow on her hands. Wait fur? She stared closely as her hand grew pads and the fur quickly spread. She felt thick fur on her legs and back now, making her body itch and her clothes feel too constricting. Sheepishly, she managed to sit down and started to strip, first peeling off her shirt as she watches her belly and chest be covered in black fur. She sees her immature nipples being covered up by the new pelt while a muzzle creeps into the corner of her vision. That&#39;s when she realized, she&#39;s becoming a skunk!<br />
<br />
She screamed and started to panic! Her legs and feet felt even more constricted now and desperately strips off her capri jeans and socks. Her feet by now have fully transformed into anthro skunk feet, the bottom being very leathery. Alyssa looked down at her naked body and felt between her thighs and could feel the fur even around her privates. She shivers when she does feel herself, as it was much more sensitive than it usually is. Her very lower backside felt tingly, causing her to lift her butt up, and out grows a very bushy white striped skunk tail! She screams again, crawling in a random direction, which just so happened to be a bathroom. She manages to get back up on two feet, turning on the bathroom lights, and looks in the full body mirror, seeing a young anthro skunk girl look right back at her. She screams a final time and passes out from shock.</p>
