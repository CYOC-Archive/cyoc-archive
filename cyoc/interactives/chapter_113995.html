<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frederick Parker was standing in the police station glaring at the sheriff as he made his request; to talk to his son Daniel Parker. Despite the Sheriff’s reluctance, he knew he could not deny the man’s request. More so that that Daniel’s lawyer was also present. A young man that though he could impress a court room by emulating a fictitious lawyer by taking his name; the kid soon found out like the rest of Frederick’s cadre of lawyers how unamused Judge Brian Flagg was with his antics. Putting the man to task after having to deal with him during the Daniel Parker’s arraignment. An initial court appearance stemming from the man’s charge of aggravated theft, aggravated attempted murder and attempting to elude police; all stemming from shooting Peter Talbot Friday evening just for his ’66 mustang.<br />
<br />
“You cannot deny my request sheriff,” Frederick Parker or Freddie ‘The Shark’ as he is know; “my son has rights after all.”<br />
“And as Daniel Parker’s attorney on record,” P. Mason trying to look threatening; “I demand to confer with my client.”<br />
“Fine,” Sheriff Cooper growling; “I’ll take you to an interview room. You’ll wait there while I drag you son from his cell.”<br />
<br />
As Sheriff Cooper showed the mobster and his slick lawyer to the room; he closed the door and headed to the holding cells were Daniel Parker was being held. Deciding to take his time in collecting the Parker, Douglas Cooper went back to his office to do some paper work.<br />
<br />
“I’ll just let Moe and Curly stew a bit, before I rouse Larry,” Douglas grinning as he pours himself a cup of coffee and taking a pleasing sip. Not taking two steps; the sheriff swears as a deputy runs into him by accident, spilling the hot liquid all over his uniform. Glaring at the deputy while he stumbles through his apologizing; Sheriff Cooper’s visage turns from one of anger to outright horror. Hearing the dreaded phrase ‘officer shot’ and finding out Deputy Carter is radioing for medical assistance, a part of him wanted to leave the Parker’s and their lawyer to rot while he ran out to the location. <br />
<br />
“Is Deputy Carter alright,” Sheriff Cooper barking; “what happened?”<br />
“He radioed that he was wounded,” the deputy answered; “Shot by a man named Chelnik…”<br />
“Fuck,” Sheriff Cooper swearing as he ran towards his office; now wanting to get a spare uniform so he can get out to the scene his cell phone rings, causing him to growl as he looks at the caller i.d and seeing its Agent Brooke Reed.<br />
“Tell me some good news,” Sheriff Cooper snapping; “I just heard the deputy with you was just shot.”<br />
“Chelnik is dead,” Agent Reed responding; “we saw him as we were making our way to the Knight Estate and I rushed to try and arrest the man.”<br />
“On what charge,” Sheriff Cooper growling; “what fucked up reason did you have to go getting my deputy nearly killed?”<br />
“Did you not look at your email,” Agent Reed responding; “Evan’s Interpol contact sent us information regarding Chelnik Vladomir. The man is wanted for war crimes and my director called me minutes before accompanying your deputy to arrest the man. Expect to get a couple of calls from Homeland Security, immigration, and the CIA and NSA sheriff Cooper. All those agencies are in a state of panic after finding out a known war criminal from the former communist Yugoslavia nation managed to slip into the country.”<br />
“Why should I have to deal with them,” Sheriff Cooper answering; “it’s not my fault Chelnik snuck in. What do they expect to get from me?”<br />
“Well, agent Reed pausing; “they will want Chelnik’s body to confirm he is the man wanted for a half dozen acts of genocide. They will want to do tests.”<br />
“So,” Sheriff Cooper answering; “let them have the man. It’s not as if I should care.”<br />
“You should,” Agent Reed sighing; “before I killed Chelnik, I dug my claws into him and he was starting to change into a werewolf.”<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper puts down his phone and absently grabs his nearby bottle of Aspirin. Not paying attention to the FBI Agent as she is trying to speak to him through the phone; he sits on his chair and pops a few pills while he dreads at the implications that will come as a result.<br />
‘they’ll do DNA tests,’ Douglas sighing; ‘they’ll discover the were-virus and the existence of weres. This cannot happen.’<br />
<br />
Grabbing his phone the Sheriff takes a breath before beginning to speak.<br />
“Agent Reed,” Douglas speaking; “as a fellow were, you know what the implications are if Chelnik’s body is handed over to the CIA or the NSA. They will discover things that the were-community has managed to keep under wraps. They cannot have Chelnik’s body.”<br />
“I know,” Agent Reed responding; “so does the head of the FBI who is also a fellow were. But when Evan requested his friend at Interpol to Email me Chelnik’s dossier, it set off so many alarm bells; every major federal agency now knows were the man is and wants him right away. I wouldn’t be surprised if they are on their way to Moon Lake as we speak.”<br />
“And now that he is dead,” Sheriff Cooper lamenting; “they will want a body as proof. Perhaps we can set it up so that he was attacked by the local wildlife. But that would invite hunters that think there is a pack of wolves with a taste for human flesh in need to be put down.”<br />
“We could always say that since the man was working for Frederick Parker,” Agent Reed speaks; “that we suspect he was killed by a rival mobster who noticed Frederick leaving San-Francisco and sent a hitman to rub the man out.”<br />
“And he takes out Freddie’s bodyguard Chelnik instead,” Sheriff Cooper thinking; “but mob hits tend to mean a body disappears.”<br />
“That shouldn’t be a problem,” Agent Reed answering; “if it means keeping the existence of were’s a secret then so be it. Besides we can always report we had Chelnik and Freddie under surveillance the moment they entered town. The report of your men losing sight of him and unable to locate him, couple with the fact that Frederick Parker does have enemies…”<br />
“I’ll run it by Tachibana,” Sheriff Cooper thinking; “perhaps we can use this to get a few of Freddie’s men to flip on the man for your RICO investigation. Without the fear of being killed by Chelnik, some might be inclined to turn on Freddie the Shark.”<br />
“It couldn’t hurt,” Agent Reed answering; “oh and before you hang up, can you instruct a deputy that will be over at our location to bring a spare robe? My clothes got ruined when I shifted into my fursona before I snapped Chelnik’s neck.”<br />
“Not a problem,” Sheriff Cooper answering; “just try and keep my deputy conscious and stay in a wooded area for the time. We’ll have an ambulance sent your way shortly.”<br />
<br />
Sheriff Cooper hangs up and sighs. Pulling open a drawer on his desk and pulling out a crystal tumbler and a bottle of rye; Douglas Cooper pours himself a drink and takes a swig before putting his bottle away.<br />
“Now let’s see this email from Interpol on Chelnik before I deal with the Parkers.”<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Frederick Parker was sitting in the interview room with his son’s attorney. Fuming that he has been waiting for roughly an hour; the man was completely unaware that the fact that his bodyguard and hitman Chelnik was just killed. His mood was even further soured when his son’s lawyer spoke up.<br />
“Now that we have a moment, I would like to discuss that matter of your bill.”<br />
“What bill,” Freddie snapping; “I gave you a hefty retainer before we left in the usual off-shore account.”<br />
“About that,” the lawyer sighing; “the account was closed sometime last night, the money in it gone.”<br />
“What,” Freddie shouting; “what do you mean gone? No one knows of that account but you and I! This better not be some pathetic attempt to shake me down,” Frederick seething; “because it will not work with me!”<br />
“Then where is the money you promised me,” the lawyer glaring; “if only you or I knew of the account and the fact that only you have the ability to close it…”<br />
<br />
Before Frederick could answer, the Sheriff returns to the interview room with Daniel Parker in handcuffs, and sporting a smile that would make a Cheshire cat look like its depressed.<br />
“You can leave us now Sheriff,” Frederick glaring; “this is a legal consult after all.”<br />
Yeah,&quot; Daniel Parker sitting down next to his father; &quot;fuck off!&quot;<br />
“Not before I give you some news,” Sheriff Cooper grinning; “good for me, but bad for you.”</p>
