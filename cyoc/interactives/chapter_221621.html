<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the party at Nat&#39;s house, and the incident with Chenoa, Stephanie was glad to have not made an enemy with Chenoa. It was going to be a little awkward now seeing her short lived ex-boyfriend across the street now. Stephanie made her way inside her house to see that Ann and Jackie had finished packing and the inside of the house looked amazing. Ann was getting her office set up while, Jackie was putting together Ann and Jackie&#39;s bedroom, Stephanie let them have the master bedroom as they were her parents now, technically. She then thought about how even though she was on good terms with her new friends, she was still lying to them about who she really was and she now felt conflicted about everything. She came to a conclusion and decided to inform Ann and Jackie of her plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann, Jackie, can I....talk to you two for a moment in the living room?&quot; Stephanie asked as the two of them looked at Stephanie then at each other concerned. Stephanie now sat in the chair next to the couch where Ann and Jackie sat.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong Stephanie?&quot; Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I....I...I can&#39;t keep living like this....&quot; Stephanie said beginning to cry. &quot;Oh, Stephanie, it&#39;ll be alright. I know it&#39;s been hard on you since you&#39;ve become a teenager, but just know we&#39;re here for you.&quot; Ann said as he patted Stephanie on the shoulder while she continued to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s just it. I can&#39;t go back to my old life! Who I am is...practically over and done with....I may be a teenager now but I still have all my adult memories and I don&#39;t want them anymore.....&quot; Stephanie said through her tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stephanie, what are you saying? You want us to erase your memories?&quot; Jackie asked unsure of what she meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;I....I...I want you to use your magic on me.&quot; Stephanie said through her tears wiping her snot on her arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? But Stephanie, I can&#39;t just....&quot; Jackie began to argue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jackie, please, if you love me like the daughter you&#39;re supposed to, you&#39;ll use your magic on me. All I ask is that you change reality around a little so I was really adopted by you guys at 14. I know a few other things will change but I don&#39;t care, I want to be your daughter!&quot; Stephanie cried as she embraced Ann and Jackie in a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Angel?&quot; Jackie asked concerned. &quot;I don&#39;t want to see her sad, but you&#39;ve got to really concentrate on things so it doesn&#39;t change too much of the last few years, just some things with us and Stephanie.&quot; Ann said agreeing with Stephanie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, but both of you hold my hands.&quot; Jackie instructed them as Ann, Jackie, and Stephanie now held hands with each other. &quot;I wish...&quot; Jackie began to say and then she used her magic to rewrite reality as best as she could.<br />
<br />
Stephanie Marsh had grown up with her folks constantly focused on business and rarely had any time to focus on their own daughter. Stephanie&#39;s nanny, Nina, took care of her for most of the time as she grew up, until not long after she turned 14, her parents had died in a plane crash. Nina couldn&#39;t afford to take care of Stephanie on her salary alone. Fortunately for Stephanie, her parents had made good friends with Ann O&#39;Toole and were aware she had wanted to have a child for a few years now seeing her sister start her own family. Ann was sad at the loss of her coworkers and friends but promised Stephanie she would take care of her as best as she could. Ann&#39;s small apartment wasn&#39;t really fit for a teen girl to stay with her in.<br />
<br />
Ann also didn&#39;t have much time at first to spend with Stephanie, but tried as best as she could. When Ann and Jackie started dating, Jackie encouraged her to make more time with her adopted daughter. Some of the events with Stephanie involved had now been swapped out with Nina in place of events that Ann and Jackie would never have allowed her to be in such as the events with Dyson. But she was still in moments with Ann and Jackie such as the Halloween party with Megan that the four of them went to. Stephanie was glad that Ann and Jackie could be there so much for her, unlike her parents. She shed tears of joy when Ann and Jackie revealed that the two of them would be her moms now. Finally the reason that Nat and Rei, didn&#39;t know too much about Stephanie before was because Ann and Jackie didn&#39;t want their daughter involved with the trauma she might endure. After the incident with the former demon hunter was over with, Ann decided that it was time to move closer to her sister&#39;s home town and that&#39;s how reality was reset with Stephanie. She was now no longer a former adult turned teenager, she was a teenager with deceased parents and supportive adoptive parents. She also had an inheritance waiting for her when she turned 21 that was originally from her previous life.<br />
<br />
After the wish was over, Ann and Jackie saw Stephanie still crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweetie?&quot; Ann asked as she put her hand on Stephanie&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate them...I hate them so much....&quot; Stephanie cried. &quot;Hate who?&quot; Ann asked her as Jackie put her hand on Stephanie&#39;s other shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents! They were never around, it was always Nina who was there....and you two. You two have been better parents than they ever were. But I still miss them.&quot; Stephanie cried. Ann and Jackie looked at each other with sad looks before Stephanie embraced the two of them in a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU&#39;RE MY PARENTS! YOU&#39;RE MY REAL PARENTS! You&#39;ve always been to me....&quot; Stephanie cried through her tears. Ann and Jackie looked around their living room, they now had pictures of the last couple of years with the three of them. They had a picture of when they adopted Stephanie, they had a picture of the two of them at the courthouse getting secretly married earlier in the year. There were numerous other pictures of Stephanie with Ann and Jackie as their memories now shifted to giving Stephanie the childhood she had deserved.<br />
<br />
Stephanie was also aware that Jackie wasn&#39;t totally an adult, but she had always thought of her as one since she always acted more mature when she was with Ann.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you moms.&quot; Stephanie said as she began to calm down. &quot;We love you too, Stephanie.&quot; Ann said with a smile. &quot;You are our daughter after all.&quot; Jackie said as Stephanie now stopped crying and a smile formed on her face. Stephanie didn&#39;t know why now, but she felt like it was her first time being a real family with the two of them.</p>
