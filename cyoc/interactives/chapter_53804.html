<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I didn't do anything,&quot; Declan cried out.<br />
<br />
&quot;DON'T LIE TO ME,&quot; Mike roared as much as a nine year old girl could. &quot;YOU CHANGED YOURSELF THEN YOU CHANGED ME TO TRY TO GET OUT OF TROUBLE. WELL IT WON'T WORK. NOW CHANGE ME BACK THIS INSTANT OR YOUR ASS IS GOING TO BE RED.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike,&quot; Diane said in a shocked tone, &quot;you know I don't like that language around Katie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm just a little bit upset here so I have the right to say ass,&quot; Mike said glaring at Diane.<br />
<br />
Diane put her hands on her hips and said, &quot;I think you need your butt spanked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't spank me I'm your husband,&quot; Mike said indignantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not from what I see,&quot; Diane said. &quot;Don't change her back Deirdre.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't,&quot; Declan now Deirdre said. &quot;I didn't do anything. It was the Medallion of Zulo that did it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A likely story,&quot; Mike said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's true,&quot; Deirdre said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's the medallion at now?&quot; Diane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In my room,&quot; Deirdre said looking up at her mother. &quot;But I don't think it will work right now. I tried changing back before I was caught and it didn't work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because you have to wait half a day to change back,&quot; Katie said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know?&quot; Deirdre asked confused.<br />
<br />
Katie looked down and said, &quot;I uh... I was on the internet on your computer and uh... browsed through your history.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we'll have to wait until tomorrow morning to change you two back then,&quot; Diane said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't stay like this,&quot; Mike said with a look of horror on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's only until tomorrow morning,&quot; Diane said with a slight smile on her face. &quot;Now I'll keep the medallion until then.&quot; She went into Deirdre's room and asked, &quot;Where is it Deirdre?&quot;<br />
<br />
Deirdre went to look for it and after a minute of searching said, &quot;It's not here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure it was in here?&quot; Diane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had dropped it when Mike came in,&quot; Deirdre said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what did you do with it Mike?&quot; Diane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What makes you think I did anything with it?&quot; Mike asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you changed into Katie's twin so you had to have touched it,&quot; Diane said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean that shitty piece of costume jewelry?&quot; Mike asked. &quot;I threw it out along with the sissy clothes Declan had.&quot; His eyes went wide as he realized what that meant. &quot;You have to be shitting me,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we can go get them before the garbage truck comes,&quot; Diane said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They've already been here,&quot; Mike said looking down. &quot;This is just fucking great,&quot; he said throwing up his hands. &quot;I'm stuck looking like Katie's fucking twin now.&quot; Katie turned around and ran to her room crying. &quot;What the fuck is her problem?&quot; Mike asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was obviously hoping that you would be her twin sister for a little while,&quot; Diane said sharply. &quot;Your outburst told her that you didn't want to be her twin sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I don't want to be her fucking twin,&quot; Mike said crossing his arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well because of your impulsiveness you are her twin sister now,&quot; Diane said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't pick this,&quot; Mike said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's true but you're stuck like that now,&quot; Diane said. &quot;Since you're now Katie's twin you'll go by Kaylie. Now go apologize to your sister and quit using the vulgar language.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She isn't my sister,&quot; Mike said, &quot;she's my step-daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not anymore Kaylie,&quot; Diane said in a tone that said she was losing patience. She yanked the oversized shirt off of Kaylie and turned her around to face the mirror. &quot;What do you see?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Kaylie looked at her naked reflection and mumbled, &quot;I see a girl that looks like Katie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right,&quot; Diane said. &quot;Now tell me how a nine year old girl that looks like Katie could be her step-father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her step-father was transformed,&quot; Kaylie said shrugging her shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one will believe that except for us,&quot; Diane said. &quot;Do you have another explanation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Kaylie said looking down. She knew no one would believe that she was anybody else but Katie's twin. &quot;What about my work though?&quot; she asked looking up at Diane. &quot;They'll be expecting me there Monday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They'll be expecting Mike there on Monday not Kaylie,&quot; Diane corrected. &quot;I'll have to think how to explain Mike and Declan's disappearance and Kaylie and Deirdre's appearance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could go to the dump and look for the medallion,&quot; Deirdre suggested. &quot;That way you don't have to explain it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylie looked excited about that but Diane squashed her hopes by saying, &quot;We are not going to the dump to look for the medallion. The dump is a big place and we have no idea where to start looking for the medallion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could ask where they dumped the garbage from today,&quot; Kaylie said. &quot;That would give us a starting point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't have you girls going through the dump,&quot; Diane said sternly. &quot;I won't risk you getting pricked by a discarded needle and get something like AIDS. Also they won't let you search through the dump. You two are stuck as girls now. Deirdre, I know you wanted to be able to switch between being a boy and a girl but that's not possible now. Kaylie, I know you didn't want this but it can't be changed. I know it's not fair to you two girls but you have to live with it now. Kaylie, go apologize to your sister and borrow some of her clothes. I'll order us some Chinese for dinner. Denise, I'd like you to gather up Mike's clothes and see if you can find his wedding ring. Karen, I'd like you to get out all of Katie's old clothes and see what will fit Deirdre. Also get out a couple of sleeping bags since Deirdre and Kaylie will be sleeping in Katie's room until I figure something else out. Now get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane watched her daughters go do what she asked them. She hoped that Deirdre and Kaylie would be able to adjust to their new lives. Deirdre should have an easier time than Kaylie but it was going to be hard on both of them. For all intents and purposes Declan and Mike were now dead so they wouldn't be able to talk to their friends and Kaylie wouldn't be able to talk with Mike's family like she used to. She sighed and went to order dinner. On the way she thought about how she was going to explain all this so it was believable.</p>
