<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The battle was over, Darren had defeated the pair of undead wizards. While Fukushu should have been happy, he realized this was only the beginning of the conflict. As Darren now spoke with the ghost of Kellie and Mika, Fukushu excused himself. He had a feeling neither would be thrilled to see him.<br />
<br />
Entering Yurikos damaged home, the kitsune now studied the frantic scene before him. Akira lay unconscious on the couch, his wife Ayami attending to his wounds. Sachiko stood nearby, the white kit sobbing as Raiden tried to comfort her. Fukushu could only sigh, Akira would recover but he wondered how his life would be moving forward. Beckoning Abolith over, the pair now entered a side room to talk. &quot;Where is Yuriko?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ayami sent her into the kitchen to find medicine,&quot; Abolith stated. &quot;Who did this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan,&quot; Fukushu growled. &quot;She attacked out of malice before summoning her mothers spirit. Where is her apprentice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Escaped in the confusion,&quot; Abolith sighed. &quot;As I suspect Morgan has as well.&quot; Fukushu simply nodded, the kitsune sporting a grim expression. &quot;I need to speak with Yuriko,&quot; he stated. &quot;During our battle I saw something from the Catalyst. She need to be told.&quot; Abolith simply nodded, the elf assassin looking to leave before Fukushu grabbed her arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be wise if you kept out of sight beloved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why,&quot; she asked, casting a kitsune lover a curious look.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Catalyst will be bringing the ghosts of Kellie and Mika here to talk,&quot; he stated. &quot;He may have broken the spell Morgan cast but we both know neither will be happy to see you.&quot; Abolith nodded in agreement, if she was spotted it could prove problematic. &quot;What will you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a plan,&quot; he stated. &quot;Just trust me. After I speak with Yuriko I must go. I will return shortly.&quot; The elf gave her lover a stiff nod, placing a gentle kiss on his cheek as they now parted. &quot;Be careful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heading towards the kitchen, Fukushu now beheld Yuriko. The elderly wizard was shaken, her face ashen as she tried to gather supplies. &quot;Yuriko a moment.&quot; Yuriko paused, glancing up at the kitsune with red eyes. Fukushu could see she had been crying, the injuries to her long time guardian proving to be difficult. &quot;Yes Fukushu what is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu now stood before his old foe, explaining what he had seen. Darren&#39;s magic was growing stronger, the young teen progressing faster than either of them would have anticipated. What concerned the kitsune though was Darren seeming to evolve. The boy pushing past his magical limits into something he had never before witnessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your student is evolving Yuriko,&quot; he stated. &quot;The power he wielded far exceeded any magic I have ever seen. The boy moved faster than thought, the power he generated was almost godlike. Have you ever heard of a Catalyst reaching these limits?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I can&#39;t say that I have,&quot; Yuriko replied softly. &quot;At Katie&#39;s peak she was the epitome of magic. Stronger than perhaps any magical being, her strength borderline divine but never crossing into the arena of the gods. She was also much older when she accomplished those feats. To think that Darren has already reach them at such a young age...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Fukushu said softly, the two understanding that Darren was entering into previously uncharted territory. &quot;Yuriko I need to depart,&quot; he stated. &quot;The Catalyst has the ghosts of Mika and Kellie with him. Neither will be happy with my presence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where will you go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan is still a threat,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;As is her apprentice. There is something I must do before I return.&quot; Yuriko simply nodded, watching as the kitsune now exited her home.<br />
<br />
*****************************<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean someone bought half the company!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well sir,&quot; a nervous accountant now stammered time the Boss. &quot;The company is publicly traded. The markets have been a bit hectic and someone put in an offer to purchase half the stocks. Honestly you should be thrilled, your portfolio has increased, making you a very rich man.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Boss said nothing, his face blank as he stared at the accountant. Without a word he now unholstered a pistol, shooting the accountant in the heart. The poor man dropped to the floor dead, a death that would be short lived as the Boss reanimated him. &quot;Grab a mop and go clean the employee bathrooms,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;It was burrito day in the cafeteria and it&#39;s a fucking mess in there!&quot; The Bosses latest undead slave happily left, leaving the Boss alone with his most trusted lieutenants. &quot;So is their anything we can do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Boss,&quot; Casseus stated. &quot;Whoever purchased a share in the company did so legally. Regrettably we now have a partner.&quot; The Boss groaned, sulking in his chair. How could things get any worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why so glum Boss?&quot;<br />
<br />
Raising his head, the Boss now watched as a middle aged Japanese man now entered his office. &quot;Can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The man smirked, rubbing the stubble on his face as he approached. &quot;Dont tell me you&#39;ve forgotten who I am?&quot; Yhe Boss was clueless, studying the man carefully. Looking towards Casseus and Choon Hee, the Boss became apprehensive. The wizard and kumiho angrily glaring at the man.<br />
<br />
Fukushu chuckled, allowing his disguise to fade. The man&#39;s features shifting into vulpine proportions, his ears rising to the top of his head as orange fur now covered his body. The Boss watched as the kitsunes nine tails now spread out behind him like a fan, slowly swaying as the kutsune grinned at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You gotta be fucking kidding!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; Fukushu smirked. &quot;You&#39;re looking at your new partner.&quot; The Boss scowled, once more reaching for his pistol as Fukushu simply shook his head. &quot;It will take more than that to finish me off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you get the money,&quot; the Boss growled. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been alive for nearly a millennium,&quot; the kitsune stated. &quot;Acquiring the wealth to purchase a share in your company Boss was an easy feat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So is this how you plan to stop me from taking out the Catalyst?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushus face became serious, his eyes narrowing as he gazed at the Boss.  &quot;Its already too late,&quot; he said. &quot;You do not have the power to stop him. No I&#39;m here because we have a mutual enemy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morgan,&quot; Fukushu growled. &quot;We are both a target for her vengeance. I propose an alliance to finish her once and for all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if I say no,&quot; the Boss asked. &quot;What if I want to focus on your buddy the Catalyst? You gonna stop me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said J won&#39;t stop you in your dealings with the Catalystc Fukushu smiled. &quot;I won&#39;t even give him knowledge of what you are doing. He has surpassed you and your organization in every way. You are as much of a threat to him as ants at a picnic. A minor annoyance he can easily deal with.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Boss scowled, not appreciating the kitsunes dismissive attitude. The Normal has wiped out many who thought themselves superior. What made this teenager so special.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just giving you friendly advise,&quot; Fukushu shrugged. &quot;You can fight against fate as much as you wish but the end result will be the same. The Catalyst will triumph.&quot; The Boss was incensed, finding himself in an unfamiliar situations as the kitsune now circled the desk, placing a hand on his shoulder before smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I anticipate great things in our future....partner.&quot;</p>
