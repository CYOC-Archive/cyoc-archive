<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Hi everyone :) This story was based on another idea that was sent to me. I hope you like it!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Here we are,” Vicky said as she placed a heavy glass terrarium on top of the table in front of you, “say hello to the Cruiz family! Quite the collection aren’t they!?”<br />
<br />
For once, you actually found yourself agreeing with Vicky as you studied the big glass terrarium more closely. As you did so, you noticed that the tank was subdivided into a number of smaller compartments. Inside, many of the animals appeared to be preoccupied as some of their passionate squawks and squeaks filled the room.<br />
<br />
“Well Princess,” Vicky continued excitedly, “I suppose I had better introduce you to the family. Here we have Gabriella and her new partner, aren’t they a cute couple?”<br />
<br />
As you followed Vicky’s gaze to where she was pointing, you immediately felt a bit sick as you saw two big, bright yellow slugs, laying entwined around each other on the floor of their miniature compartment.<br />
<br />
“Ah,” Vicky said with a giggle as she looked at the two slugs more closely, “we seem to have caught our two banana slugs at a bad time. Perhaps we should let them get on with their mating in peace; after all, we don’t want to put them off!”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky swiftly moved on as she next came to a compartment filled with dozens of noisily chirping crickets. “And here we have Katrina and some of her descendants. We use these little critters to feed many of the carnivorous animals in the Collection. Thankfully though, the little tag I placed on Katrina ensures that she is safe from danger. In fact, there she is now…”<br />
<br />
Vicky laughed as she pointed to the corner of the compartment. There, you could see a distinctly sad-looking cricket staring back at you. Regrettably, you thought you knew why this was the case as she sat with another cricket on her back, presumably being bred against her best wishes.<br />
<br />
Vicky let you stare at the mating crickets for a moment, before turning to yet another sub-compartment of the large terrarium.. Inside this one, five brightly coloured hummingbirds were busy socialising as a few of them spectacularly hovered in mid-air. <br />
<br />
However, as you looked more closely, you soon noticed that one of the birds seemed to be in a more compromising position than the others. This particular bird was tied to a makeshift perch by its feet. The poor bird was clearly terrified and desperate to break free as it flapped its wings and squawked out pleadingly. What’s more, this bird was evidently female, judging by the fact that she had one of the other birds on her back, flapping his wings frantically as he ground his cloaca against her own.<br />
<br />
“Ah, and here we have Elena,” Vicky said happily as she watched the two birds mating in front of her. “As you can see, she too has taken to her new life like a duck to water; and, like the rest of her family, has become a prolific breeder as a result!”<br />
<br />
Upon hearing this, Elena squawked out in an effort to refute Vicky’s point. However, Elena’s argument wasn’t helped when the male on her back chirped out in satisfaction, before pumping his sticky load directly into her waiting cloaca.<br />
<br />
With their mating complete, the spent male quickly flew away to get something to eat. Sadly though, Elena was given no such reprieve as she felt another feathery body landing on her back and her new mate’s throbbing cloaca connecting with her own; all in preparation for another round.<br />
<br />
Vicky laughed out loud as she saw the female being claimed once again. Meanwhile, you just felt sorry for the poor bird as you saw the obvious human intelligence in her wide, terrified eyes.<br />
<br />
With that though, Vicky moved on to the next compartment, which housed half-a-dozen small, large-eyed rodents. “Now then, here we have our kangaroo rats, aren’t they adorable?”<br />
<br />
As you looked more carefully, you quickly spotted that most of the little furry creatures appeared to be male; with the exception being one lone female who was currently preoccupied by one of the males.<br />
<br />
“Ah, there she is,” Vicky said as she watched the lone female being violently pounded by the male on her back, “Lola here is a very popular girl indeed. In fact, I think she is due to give birth either today or tomorrow. As you can see, she’s practically bursting with little ones, meaning this litter should be a big one.”<br />
<br />
As Vicky said this, a deep groan echoed out from the female kangaroo rat as the male on her back continued to stuff his dick deep into her furry folds. <br />
<br />
Sadly, like with the female hummingbird earlier, Lola’s protests soon faded once she felt her mate’s semen erupting deep inside her. Seeing the horrified reaction on the female’s face made Vicky laugh out loud, while you just felt sorry for the poor animal as you waited for the male to release her.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, the male only ejaculated for a short while before he seemed satisfied. He then scampered off to see his friends, leaving Lola panting in exhaustion as some excess seed slowly dripped from her gaping pussy.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, Vicky finally turned her attention to the main compartment at the centre of the terrarium, where a pair of iguanas sat looking up at you.<br />
<br />
“And lastly, we have the main event,” Vicky happily declared, “say hello to Carlos Cruiz, local property magnate and business mastermind.” <br />
<br />
Upon hearing this, one of the iguanas appeared to visibly bristle with anger as the spines on the back of its neck rose up slightly.<br />
<br />
“Now then,” Vicky continued, “I suppose I had better explain how this little dear came to join the Collection. Well, old Carlos here tried everything in his power to make us sell the farm and all of our land. But sadly, when we turned him down flat, that’s when Carlos started to truly earn his place here.”<br />
<br />
Upon hearing this, the iguana hissed out in protest. However, Vicky simply ignored the distressed reptile as she continued with her story.<br />
<br />
“When he didn’t get his way,” Vicky continued, “Carlos turned to other tactics like blackmail and death threats. Sadly for him, our family is used to this sort of thing, so naturally we weren’t swayed. After this though, things got even worse; with Carlos sending his idiot sons to vandalise our property and poach some of our animals. Thankfully though, we were able to stop them before they could do any serious harm.”<br />
<br />
Again, hearing this made the iguana bristle in anger. However, this only made Vicky giggle as she continued.<br />
<br />
“After this,” Vicky resumed, “we decided to see how Carlos liked having other people come onto his land and messing with his business. As a result, Carlos and his family wound up here, where they are all happily being put to work as breeders for their respective species. And best of all, thanks to HER new 360 degree vision, ‘CARLY’ here gets to watch her entire family as they fuck like the dirty animals they now are!”<br />
<br />
In response to this, a few more of the animals joined the iguana in voicing their outrage. However, this only made Vicky laugh as she continued to smile evilly at the distressed female iguana looking up at her.<br />
<br />
“Awww, what’s the matter dear?” Vicky said as she leaned in to look at the iguana more closely, “why are you so glum? Oh hang on a minute,” Vicky said after a brief pause, “what’s this? Oh my... I see you and your mate have been busy again! Congratulations!”<br />
<br />
As Vicky said this, she reached a hand into the terrarium and moved to grab the angry lizard before it could react. In response, the iguana tried to bite and swipe at the hand with her claws as she hissed out in protest. However, Vicky was far too experienced with handling animals to care as she easily lifted the lizard up out of the terrarium before presenting it to you.<br />
<br />
What greeted you made you shudder in disgust. There, nestled between the lizard’s scaly legs, was the smooth, rounded shape of an egg, in the process of being squeezed out of the scaly vent from where it had emerged.<br />
<br />
“Ohhhh, look at that Carly,” Vicky said with a smile, “yet another little one to be proud of. Honestly, this must feel like second-nature by this stage, after all, I must confess that I have lost count of just how many offspring you have had.”  <br />
<br />
In reply to these mocking words, Carly let out an annoyed hiss, though it was now clear that she was mainly focused on the uncomfortable egg-laying process that she was now embroiled in.<br />
<br />
“Now then dearie,” Vicky said as she held Carly up close to her face, “let’s get a closer look at that egg of yours. Hmmm… I’m afraid it looks rather stuck to me. Do not fret though, I’m sure we can find a way to help that egg of yours along.”<br />
<br />
Again, Carly simply hissed out in annoyance. Meanwhile, you just tried to maintain your composure, despite the creeping sickness you were starting to feel as Vicky prepared to help her pet iguana lay the pesky egg lodged inside her cloaca. <br />
<br />
Surely this performance couldn’t get any worse than this...</p>
