<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fran and Darla led along the happy and perky Jack and Marcine and pranced along behind <br />
the two blond wolves without much of a care in the world looking at everything with <br />
bright eyes. The two twins look at each other uncomfortably, 'We're not that bad are we?' <br />
<br />
The blond wolves led the two ninety-two-percent humans to Master Jensen. Their hair had <br />
turned into brownish gold fur, and their eyes had started to becoming large black orbs <br />
with no whites or centers. <br />
<br />
Kaylee was found 'playing' with the Master. The twins said nothing, but Jack and Marcine <br />
were shocked and took a couple steps back. However they didn't flee. <br />
<br />
Kaylee and Jensen looked up at the twins and the eight-percent-deer. &quot;Yes?&quot; Jensen <br />
asked. <br />
<br />
The twins flanked between themselves and bowed swiftly, &quot;Master!&quot; <br />
<br />
Darla said, &quot;... I called the gargoyle's father, he said he had no son.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran said, &quot;I brought Jack and Marcine, they finished telling their parents how they eloped.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... the father said he had no son?&quot; Jensen asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; The twins answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;... Make sure to include the new gargoyles call their relatives fair well anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot; The twins blinked. <br />
<br />
&quot;It would be rather humiliating if all our plans fell apart because the man had been <br />
speaking symbolically wouldn't it?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Yes of course Master!&quot; Darla bowed quickly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Quite right Master!&quot; Fran bowed in turn. <br />
<br />
Jensen then looked at the two blonds, &quot;Your names are Jack and Marcine right?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jack said blinking solid black eyes and nodding like a doll, &quot;Oh yes!&quot; <br />
<br />
Marcine said hopping up and down, &quot;Yes it is!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good. You're grateful for the new lives the pack have given you yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Yes!&quot; &quot;Very much so!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then we I have a something to ask in return. You won't be using the game once you're <br />
deer, so we'd like you to play the game with the rest of the staff who are due very soon.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really? Okay.&quot; &quot;Sure why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Fran you'll give instructions with Jack for the five new Gargoyles. Darla, you'll <br />
instruct Marcine on Transform or Daring the remaining staff to become part of the pack.&quot; <br />
<br />
The twins hup to, &quot;Master!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I trust you read Bart's proper instructions?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.&quot; The twins replied. <br />
<br />
Kaylee smirked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Make sure Jack and Marcine follow them to the letter. No mistakes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There will be no mistakes Master.&quot; Fran nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;We promise you that.&quot; Darla added. <br />
<br />

Alice smiled as she stuck her arm between her glass eyes the illustration of the lilliputians <br />
tying down Guliver. Her entire body was one piece of glass, at the right angle it was <br />
reflective, at another it was transparent, it made for some amusing effects. Still Alice with <br />
the window open a tiny crack kept her ears sharp for the sound of a bus, or the gating <br />
being opened or feet on the driveway. <br />
<br />
Alice noticed the shadows walking single file down the same hallway she was sitting in on <br />
the window cill, &quot;Who cares for them, they're like a pack of cards.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice's curiosity was perked however when she noticed that half the men were now <br />
wearing Jennifer I's business dresses and were walking in high heeled shoes, and doing a <br />
relatively decent job of not trying over their own feet in them. Apparently they were <br />
categorizes the house's furniture (the pack would need less tan half of it). <br />
<br />
&quot;Curiouser and curiouser.&quot; Alice commented as the shadows not even looking at her just <br />
continued to walk, the men in the business dresses swaying their hips a bit. <br />
<br />
Alice wanted to check them out more, but she had been given an important task and while <br />
she was curious to a fault she didn't dare cross the Big Bad Wolf, her father. <br />
<br />
That was when her glass ears perked. She looked outside, and then shouted down the <br />
hallway, in a manner that Mr. and Mrs. Smith before their change would have deeply <br />
disapproved of, but now would have been even more likely to do than Alice. <br />
<br />
&quot;They are coming!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
All four o Martha's ears perked as she heard the sound of Alice's well mannered voice then <br />
one of her heads repeated the shout down the stairwell. &quot;They are coming!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And we're stuck in here again.&quot; Bart lamented. <br />
<br />
Kevin asked, &quot;Maybe we could go and see if we were really really quiet?&quot; <br />
<br />
Martha calmly stepped into the doorway and kept herself between freedom and the pups, <br />
putting her lower arms behind her back and crossing her upper arms between her breasts, <br />
&quot;I'd say 'go ahead and try' but personally I'd much prefer if I didn't have to deal with that <br />
particular brand of non-sense.&quot; <br />
<br />
The four cubs all looked at each other, then look at Martha who had an eye on each of <br />
them with the remaining two eyes sweeping the room. And they all looked at each other <br />
again and went back to reading their books. <br />
<br />
Martha stepped away from the door as she kept one head looking at Bart and Jenny while <br />
also looking at Kevin and Marcy. Her arms reminded the pubs at the moment of lightning <br />
quick cobras. <br />
<br />
Her heads kindly smiled, &quot;Now come what page are you on?&quot; She asked Kevin and Marcy to <br />
their copy of Alice in Wonderland. <br />
<br />
Jenny and Bart moved their feet a couple of inches. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please don't make me have to interrupt reading with your younger siblings.&quot; Martha said <br />
with her left head, her other head not looking up with her left head continued to look at <br />
the older cubs. <br />
<br />
the elder cubs inches their feet back. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;They're coming!!!&quot; Darla and Fran echoed looking up hearing the echoing voices. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go to the rooms we told you!&quot; The twins said to the ninety two percent humans. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right!&quot; &quot;Got it!&quot; <br />
<br />
The twins looked at each other, &quot;So are we ready for this?&quot; Darla asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;You tell me, you were on the beat that showed you how it was done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're the one whose married! You've seen a lady who knows how to keep one!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran nodded, &quot;Well I guess we'll have to see how our different experiences play out.&quot; <br />
<br />
Darla nodded, &quot;Right! Remember if your group with Jack is larger than five just keep them <br />
in line and have the new gargoyles hold onto them until Marcine has completed <br />
transforming the other staff members.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if it's smaller I'll send one of the new gargoyles to recruit one of yours.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be sure to hold off on one if your group ends up being short any.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fran closed her eyes and sighed, &quot;Okay, let's do it.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Kitchen, household support and junior staff, their numbers varied from good size to <br />
amazingly small (the kitchen staff was actually did cooking composed of two people).<br />
<br />
Those in the employ of the Smiths opened gates and walked inside... <br />
<br />
Ladies and males alike stopped dead in their tracks at what greeted them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hiiiiiiii....&quot;<br />
<br />
Two seven foot tall dirty blond wolf women with breasts that so large that squashed into <br />
each other. The men stared in amazement, the women stared in bewilderment. <br />
<br />
Yet none of them were screaming at the image of two giant animal people, let alone two <br />
giant naked animal people. It was like they saw animal people each day, they didn't, but <br />
they just didn't have the feeling of things being extra ordinary alien or overwhelming <br />
unnatural. <br />
<br />
the two wolf women leaned against each other, their pairs maternal material squashing <br />
into each other as they pushed their chests against each other, their heads turned towards <br />
the staff with coy looks in their eyes. <br />
<br />
'I feel so dirty.' Fran thought, and thus so did Darla. Doing it for Master was one thing of <br />
course, but for a bunch of people they didn't know? Darla ignored the shiver while Fran <br />
shuddered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, how ya all doing?&quot; Fran spoke sultry. <br />
<br />
&quot;You feelin' good all of ya?&quot; Darla enticed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.... what are you doing here?&quot; Said the Useful Man.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do realize you're trespassing right?&quot; Asked one of the maids. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we're very very very much here by the approval of the owner...&quot; Said Darla. <br />
<br />
&quot;So why don't you all come along now? We have lots of surprises and -rewards- for you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So please....&quot; <br />
<br />
The twin said together, &quot;Catch us if you can!&quot; <br />
<br />
The twins then separated. And thought it was unpleasant to separate they did have their <br />
duty to their Master. <br />
<br />
They skipped along, swaying their hips and swinging their arms a little and taking mock <br />
baby steps as they went in opposite directions to the 'transformation rooms' as they had <br />
begun to think of the servant's foyers. <br />
<br />
&quot;She's pretty...&quot; Drooled one of the men and went after Darla.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's stupid they look exactly alike!&quot; Snarled a maid with a small ribbon in her hair <br />
stamping her foot. She then groaned and ran after him. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile the two men who composed the cooking staff (both quite thin and one <br />
described as a 'man boy' by his own mother!) looked at the direction Fran was going and <br />
followed her out of idle curiosity and not wanting to get in the way of the maid with the <br />
small ribbon in her hair.<br />
<br />
The much larger staff looked at each other as the lovely sexy wolf women practically <br />
swayed towards the servant's foyers. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what Mr. Smith wants with them? Mrs. Smith will kill him and make sure his <br />
body was never found.&quot; Said one of the remaining maids. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe Mrs. Smith swings both ways and they're a gift?&quot; Said The Butler. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well let's hurry along ....&quot; Sighed the Useful Man. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you think the ground keepers are?&quot; Looked around the maid who had spoken.  <br />
<br />
A maid who was actually elderly (as the vast majority of maids were) said quite simply, <br />
&quot;Well if they're late Mrs. Smith ate them alive.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe the wolf women ate them?&quot; Asked the Hall Boy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on let's ask them already! Up close and personal!&quot; Finally said the brother of the <br />
man who had gone after Darla who then went after Fran. <br />
<br />
The large group then divided together and walked after Fran and Darla.</p>
