<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick sighed as he sat in Social Studies. This class bored him so much that his attention would often wander. Mostly it wandered to the girls in the class and what they were wearing. Today it had wandered to Tanya's dress. She was wearing a pale blue tube top dress. It looked so soft and comfortable. He wished he could wear one like it. Unfortunately he was a closet cross dresser and had to sneak into his older sisters room to get girl clothes. He didn't wear most girl things outside the house except for panties. He was wearing a pair of yellow satin panties now that he snuck from his sister. He had a feeling that she and the rest of his family suspected that he was wearing his sister's clothes but haven't said anything.<br />
<br />
He sighed again and began flipping through his Social Studies book. His sister was going to be home all weekend so he wouldn't get the chance to wear any of her clothes. Maybe if he came out and told her she would allow him to wear her stuff. Or maybe she would buy him some clothes of his own. His thoughts were interrupted when he had flipped several pages at once and found a folded piece of paper. Opening it he noticed that it was addressed to him. Reading through the note he could hardly suppress a laugh. There was no way this note could change anything, some had to be playing a joke on him.<br />
<br />
Looking at the clock he noticed that he still had a little over half an hour left of class. He started to think about what he would want if things could change. He had been curious about being a girl and wearing girl clothe but he did like his dick. With a smile he started writing his wish.<br />
<br />
I wish that over the next two days I would slowly change into a hermaphrodite. I should look like any other girl when my transformation is done except for the the fact I will still have a dick. At the end of my transformation I should have a girlfriend who is also a hermaphrodite. Our dicks should remain soft until we are ready to use them. We can not get each other pregnant since we lack balls. We can get pregnant if we have sex with a guy though.<br />
<br />
Rick thought of what else he might write. His eyes rested on Tanya again and he smiled. If everyone would be oblivious to the changes he might as well write what what his mind fancies. Looking back at the note he began writing again.<br />
<br />
As soon as I finish my wish the panties I'm wearing now will be mine instead of my sisters. I will also be wearing a yellow tube top dress and yellow sandals. I also carry a black leather purse. I go to Girl's PE and shower with them. I even use the girls restroom and I have to sit to pee. I am also on the swim team as is whoever my girlfriend is after my transformation is complete. This is considered normal for me and people will instantly call me Viki or Miss Tanner.<br />
<br />
Rick thought that he should put in someway to be sure his transformation was complete. He figured that he would have a girlfriend when it was done though would that indicate his transformation was over? He figured he better put in something that would be unmistakable and also to close it properly so the note knew he was done.<br />
<br />
When my transformation is done my hands will glow pink then blue then red and finally pink again before fading after I notice it. This is my wish.<br />
<br />
Rick chuckled a little bit as he folded the paper up. He was going to stick it in his pants pocket when his clothes disappeared. The only thing that didn't disappear was his sister's panties. He looked around to see if anyone noticed. Just at that moment Mr. Jenkins asked &quot;Do you have the answer to the question Miss Tanner?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick could hardly speak. Mr. Jenkins was looking at him waiting for an answer as was everyone else. They didn't seem to notice that he was now practically naked except for his sister's panties. He hasn't been paying attention but he took a guess. &quot;Uh, 1532&quot; he said tentatively.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is incorrect&quot; Mr. Jenkins said. &quot;Does anybody have the correct answer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick didn't pay attention after that. He looked down at his body in time to see the tube top dress he wanted to wear appear on him. He couldn't believe this, it had to be a dream. He shrugged his shoulders and decided that if this was a dream that he would go with it. Hopefully he wouldn't be waking up soon like he always did when he figured out he was dreaming. He spotted a purse just as the bell rang. He stuffed the note in it and got up with the rest of the class. He was expecting the bell to ring again figuring it was his alarm clock going off. The bell only rang at the beginning of his next class.<br />
<br />
By the time the class finished Rick was convinced that he wasn't dreaming.</p>
