<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Billy took a deep breath. He was nervous, but he already made up his mind and need to follow through with it. &quot;A-alright. Let&#39;s do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Billy could see Luis&#39;s eyes light up when he agreed. While he was happy to see his friend happy, it had also added to the anxiety Billy was feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, so what do we do first? Do we just-&quot; But before Billy could finish, Luis had pulled him in for a kiss. This had surprised Billy when it happened, but slowly his apprehensions started to disappear, and he kissed back. This kiss was different from the ones he gave Katie a couple of times before. This was deeper and lasted so much longer. Since it was both of them&#39;s first time kissing like this, the kisses were a bit sloppy, but they slowly managed to get better over time.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like forever to both of them, Luis finally stopped making out with Billy, only to start kissing Billy&#39;s neck instead. This simple action had caused Billy to gasp as a wave of pleasure ran throughout his body. Luis continued to trail kisses down his best friend&#39;s body until he reached Billy’s large pecs. Remember just how good it felt when Billy touched his nipples; Luis decided the same, only instead of his fingers, he did it with his tongue. This sensation outright made Billy moan in pleasure. Was this what sex felt like, he thought? If that was the case, then he didn&#39;t want it to end any time soon.<br />
<br />
After a little while longer, Luis pushed Billy onto his own bed. It was a good thing Billy had a good size bed because now it had to hold two adults having sex. Luis honestly had no idea what he was doing. All he could do was act on instinct, and instinct was telling him to claim every inch of Billy&#39;s hot body.<br />
<br />
Billy was surprised that Luis was taking the lead on this. He was so used to the somewhat meek and scrawny Luis that this confident and brawny Luis almost seemed like a different person altogether. Would Luis grow up this confident like this naturally, Billy thought? Would he be able to build the muscles that Billy couldn&#39;t keep his hands off of without the leaching cube? Either way, Billy was finding this older Luis so sexy. Well, until Luis opened his mouth to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;m starting to get why you were so obsessed with Katie and growing up, Billy. Or maybe I should be calling you William instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?! What are you saying? That is so not a sexy thing to say right now.&quot; This complaint from Billy only Luis to chuckle as he continued worshipping Billy&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, maybe your right, but it&#39;s the truth. Hey, remember when you said that you knew I was always jealous about your muscles? Well, I think I  was feeling more than just jealousy. Don&#39;t get me wrong, being buff feels amazing, but being able to touch your muscles, kiss them, lick them. It makes me realize that I think I prefer men more than girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy wanted to say something, but he couldn&#39;t. Between sentences, Luis had continued his onslaught on Billy&#39;s senses. Every touch from Luis was like fire, and it almost felt like his body and mind were melting away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think it&#39;s about time we wrap this up.&quot; Billy wanted to ask what Luis meant when he said that but got his answer quickly when Luis entered him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh!&quot; Billy screamed out in pain. It hurt so much! Was this normal? Luis stopped when he heard Billy scream and looked at Billy apologetically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, should we stop or...&quot; Luis asked. Honestly, a part of Billy wanted to stop here, but he already made up his mind, and he needed to see this through to the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no, I&#39;m fine. J-just keep going. I can take it.&quot; After Billy said that, Luis continued. It was hard for Billy to endure, but after a while, it started to feel good. Really good. So good, in fact, that neither of them could last any longer and released together.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Afterward, Billy found himself cuddling Luis as they both basked in the afterglow while also trying to process what just happened. When he first woke up today, receiving an age controlling cube, becoming an adult with Luis, and losing his virginity to his best friend were not on the itinerary. But it happened.<br />
<br />
Was it wrong that his first thought was wondering if they could do it again? Was this going to be a running thing in the future? Them turning into adults when no one is around just to have sex? Well, if that is the case, maybe next time he can be the one in control?<br />
<br />
That was Billy&#39;s first thought, but there was another one that was much stranger to him. Being in Luis&#39;s arms felt... nice. Maybe... if he and Katie don&#39;t work out, it wouldn&#39;t be so bad to be with Luis...<br />
<br />
But before Billy could stew on that thought, a voice that came from downstairs suddenly called out to him. &quot;Billy! What on earth are you doing up there?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh crap! Billy forgot his older brother Daniel was still in the house. He must have heard them from downstairs! Luis instinctively ran into Billy&#39;s closet to hide, while Billy locked the door to his bedroom and then grabbed the leaching cube.<br />
<br />
Billy needs to return to his original age and fast!</p>
