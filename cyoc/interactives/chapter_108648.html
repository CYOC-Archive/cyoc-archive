<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">     You yawn in your fox form, as you sat down on the remains of the camp. After a quickly rummage through their belongings you don&#39;t find anything of real importance or value. Though you did find a couple of pornographic magazines but you didn&#39;t care too much.<br />
<br />
       You yawned once more as you realize that despite eating a soul right now, you were still pretty hungry. Why not go out for more souls? After all your soon to be prison buffet plan won&#39;t be doable until a couple of weeks.  You close your green eyes and concentrate. You slowly feel the presence of other souls far away from you. Some where in another state, some were back at the city, others were in smaller towns a few miles ahead. Yet there was one similarity between all of them. The presence of their evil minds tainted with desire and want for murder, robbery, and destruction. You begin growing angry as you feel their disgusting smell of evil fill your nostrils.<br />
<br />
        You abandon the campsite and head for the closest evil soul. You run at top speed, running by the prison Winter Slam , and running alongside a road. Passerby cars would barely see a glimpse of you as you dash by. Eventually you grow closer to the soul you detected. <br />
<br />
      Then you find not him... but her. She lived in a town miles west from the city you lived in. She was a con artist. She would suduce unfortunate men and then in the middle of the night after the men fall asleep she would take any of their belongings. Then she would use the money for not so legal things.<br />
<br />
       This woman cared about herself and money alone. She was cunning and adaptable but you had a plan. <br />
<br />
        Right now the woman was standing by the doorway of a pub in the morning hours. Waiting for any potential men to scam.<br />
<br />
      You begin your plan and shapeshift into a man wearing an expensive suit .You walk out of the bushes from where you were hiding and begin to enter the pub where the woman was standing by. As you were about to grab the door handle, the woman stops you.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Woah, hey handsome, why do you wanna go in there? That place stinks of beer and alcohol. I can tell your not around from here, let me show you a better place.&quot; she says her voice smooth and soft. She made sure to sway her body sensually as she spoke, you didn&#39;t fall for it though.<br />
<br />
        &quot;Alright, thanks for helping out, like you said I&#39;m new around here. Miss...&quot; you say hoping for her name.<br />
<br />
       &quot;Call me Trish, now come on let me show you a better place.&quot; she replies and begins walking away. <br />
<br />
      You follow her through the town, and she leads you to what seems to be an motel. Trish goes to the check in and pays enough money to rent a room. After she gets a key from the woman at the counter she leads to you to a small room with only one bed and a tiny bathroom:<br />
<br />
     &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry Trish, I just wanted a place to get some beer or something. I&#39;m not into this kind of stuff.&quot; You say<br />
<br />
      &quot;Oh hush you, come on it will be fun for the both of us. Here let me close the door so we can get some privacy. &quot; Trish closes the door and locks it, leaving you alone with her. <br />
<br />
        &quot;I think I should leave.&quot; you say, wanting to play the nervous guy, the kind of men she purposely targets. <br />
<br />
      &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, what&#39;s the harm in a little fun?&quot; She says with a hint of annoyance in her voice. <br />
<br />
       She walks closer to you and begins to grope your groin, you feeling immense satisfaction as you see the look of surprise on her face when she feels your massive member. You pretend to groan a little, as she does it. <br />
<br />
      She pulls back her hand, and says &quot;Well I should get ready, I&#39;m going to use the bathroom for a bit.&quot; She enters the bathroom and shuts the door. <br />
<br />
     Now it was time for part two of your plan. You snap your fingers and watch as you become completely invisible. You wait for her to come out.  When she leaves the bathroom she gives a massive sigh of disappointment and rage as she sees you have completely disappeared from the room. <br />
<br />
    She sits on the bed not knowing you were still there standing still in one of the corners. <br />
<br />
      Trish starts laying down on the bed and slowly begins to fall asleep. As she does, you sneak closer to her and cast a spell over her. Her once delicate skin wrinkles, her smooth hands become baggy, veins more visible as her once large round breasts turn saggy. Her appearance becomes the equivalent of a 78 year old despite her still actually being in her twenties.<br />
<br />
                   She wakes up once the transformation completes, as if she felt the presence of someone else in the room. She sits up on the bed, still not realizing her transformation. Then she takes out her phone and in the reflection of the screen sees her new face. She lets out a screen.<br />
<br />
    She drops her phone and examines her new body, her wrinkly face in shock as she sees her frail hands. Trish starts hyperventilating as the shock of it comes over her. <br />
<br />
    Then, you bite down on her arm and feel a sense of pleasure as she gives out a hoarse scream. Tasty blood flows into your mouth and  pink light glows out of her eyes as you throw her down into the abyss, eating her soul in the process.<br />
<br />
     That one was especially tasty you think. Now to move on to your next meal! You&#39;ll need to save up energy once Winter Slam has a decent amount of prisoners in it. <br />
<br />
      You leave the motel, invisible, not bothering with the checkout. You were on a hunt for souls. Going into the woods near the town you begin to search for souls once more. You transform into your demon fox form and start heading back to your apartment, the city would probably have more souls than a small town like this place you think. <br />
<br />
      By the time you had arrived back at the city, it was about four in the afternoon, but you didn&#39;t mind as you turned invisible again, making sure not to attract the wrong kind of attention.<br />
<br />
        Then you sense an immense cluster of evil souls. On a hunch, you run towards the direction of the cluster, your mouth watering at the prospect of eating more souls. But as you run you can&#39;t help but wonder what the cluster really was. A terrorist group? A city gang? A group of escaped criminals?<br />
<br />
    You make it to the cluster of souls and find out like you thought was a large gang of thugs in the more ghetto part of the city. They were all standing in a parking lot to a grocery store that looked as if it hadn&#39;t had a customer in a while. <br />
<br />
        There were no other humans nearby but then you could tell. Perfect. You a deep whiff of the gang. They were all tainted with malice and greed. Each one of them has done a terrible crime and never looked back. You knew you had to stop their spree.  <br />
<br />
<br />
      Then you sensed something else nearby....</p>
