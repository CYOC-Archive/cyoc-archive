<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As soon as your friend starts to watch your hair receding, you realize that your boyfriend has picked the pink change candy. You gently brush down your hair and discover that it can’t reach your shoulders anymore. Your boyfriend gains the vise versa, with his hair now close to his ass. His light coating of stubble magically vanishes in exchange, and his lips turn kissable. You end up getting quite a bit of facial hair, and your lips become thin to adapt to that. Next, your eyes narrow as they take on a rather ovular shape. Your eyelashes rapidly shrink while your eyebrows do the opposite. Your nose widens, but your boyfriend’s nose shrinks. The only things remaining at this point are your cheekbones, jawline, and chin, but the former hardens to support both your jaw sharpening and your chin getting pointy.<br />
<br />
Your neck widens to make some space for an Adam’s apple to form. Your shoulders similarly broaden as your muscles grow and develop around your biceps and forearms. Your breasts, on the other hand, recede into your chest, and your nipples simultaneously decrease in size and sensitivity while darkening. You check your hands in the meantime. They have become big, callous, and meaty while your fingernails have shrunk. By then, your chest has already gotten rid of your tits. But wait! The changes are not leaving it at that! Instead, they make sure your boobs are reborn as your hard pectorals and give you a decent amount of chest hair. This forces you to take off your shirt and bra. Your pelvis snaps like a stick as it narrows, and following that is your waist thickening. Both of these cause your feminine curves to be annihilated. However, something else is forming within your stomach, and that is your six-pack abs.<br />
<br />
You quickly glance at your boyfriend, and you aren’t surprised to find that not only is his Adam’s apple is nowhere to be seen, but his chest starting to form breasts. They might probably develop into at least a D-cup, with big nipples and all that. His shirt is starting to look a bit tighter, and this forces him to reluctantly take his shirt off. Not long after that, his new breasts confirm your idea, and they have become exactly as perky as you would expect, with big nipples and all that. When your boyfriend’s shoulders narrow, his hips widen, and his waist gets rid of his abs before taking on a more waspish form, earning an hourglass figure. By now, it should be obvious where this is going; you are trading your femininity for your boyfriend’s masculinity.<br />
<br />
Whereas your boyfriend’s body hair disappears, from his limbs to his hairy trail that connects his belly button to his thinning pubic hair, yours surfaces across those areas. Out of the blue, your spine extends until it hits six feet tall. You then look around the room. Everything just seems smaller, even your boyfriend, who is a little more than he should be. Fortunately, he stops shrinking once he is at around five feet and a few inches.<br />
<br />
“Hey, wait,” you start to ask, but you quickly stop to consider your new voice. It’s around a baritone. Deep enough to be commanding. Finally, you finish asking, “Didn’t you say you weren’t taking off your clothes?”<br />
<br />
“I was going to say the same thing,” your boyfriend replies. He rapidly covers his mouth with his petite hands in surprise. Now that you think about it, you should understand why. His voice has gotten higher until it is at a soprano. “I tried to tell myself to keep my clothes on no matter what,” your boyfriend explains, “but when these boobs popped out, my shirt got too tight.”<br />
<br />
“And you had to take it off?” you inquire.<br />
<br />
“Yes.”<br />
<br />
“You’re not alone. I had to strip out of both my bra and my shirt.”<br />
<br />
At that moment, you feel a pang right inside your pussy.<br />
<br />
“What?!” you spit out. “Already?”<br />
<br />
“I think somebody’s growing a cock,” your friend teasingly comments.<br />
<br />
“Why are you trying to provoke your—“ your boyfriend tries to ask, only to feel the same sensation as you are without warning, and this time, it is around his penis and testicles. “Crap! It’s happening to me too!”<br />
<br />
Your friend pulls down your skirt and panties to watch the inexorable. Your clit instantly shoots upward as it speedily forms into an erection. While your clit becomes harder and bigger during that phase, your vagina seals up. All your egg cells convert to sperm as a scrotum pops out from your labia. Your womb shrivels and ultimately forms into your prostate after your testicles get quite a bit of hair. Once your clit has hit six inches, your clitoral hood turns into your foreskin by spreading across your clit. Veins bulge from your new erect, rock-hard twelve-inch cock as a tip surfaces at the end. Even though you have every right to feel shocked, you can’t help but feel kind of… horny.<br />
<br />
During all of that, your boyfriend feels his penis quickly receding into him along with his testicles, which get less hairy over time. A uterus and fallopian tubes develop inside your boyfriend, and his prostate migrates to convert into his womb as his birth canal forms. By the time your boyfriend’s scrotum has finished turning into his labia, all of his sperm cells lose their tails and become his egg cells. His labia promptly splits open in time for his penis to get inside and finish converting into his pink clit, leaving him with a new pussy in the process. You and your boyfriend’s bodies pump out testosterone and estrogen respectively, speeding up both of your changes.<br />
<br />
You feel your ass getting smaller and tighter because its fat is altering into muscle. Your thighs join along by also letting fat turn into muscle. Your boyfriend’s behind and thighs are going from a D to a V as he gains a minted bubble butt with thick thighs to perfectly match it. Neither of your calves is an exception from the muscles as they trade their fat for that. Finally, your feet extend so that they will ultimately become big and meaty like your hands before letting your toenails lose their polish and shrink, putting an end to your changes. Your boyfriend’s calves slim down while his feet decrease to become petite, and finally, his toenails grow similarly to his fingernails and gain some polish.<br />
<br />
“Woah,” your friend comments. “You both are looking great!” Your friend looks at you. “I’m starting to get quite jealous, (your name). You got to completely swap genders with your boyfriend, and on top of that, you get to have a big cock while I don’t!”<br />
<br />
“That’s because most of the time, the pink candy should change your gender entirely,” you explain as best you can. Meanwhile, your penis goes back to being flaccid and limp at nine inches.<br />
<br />
“Maybe you should give me another pink candy?” your friend requests.</p>

Do you give your friend the needed candy?</h3>
