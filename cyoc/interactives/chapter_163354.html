<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken had to get devious in order for him to access Jeff’s Play-to-Create program. He knew the name of the dog to which Jeff had transitioned, “Fang” if he had a pedigree, the American Kennel Club would have a record to that address, as it was a place to begin his investigation.<br />
<br />
The needed info was the full name, date of birth, and a telephone number of where Jeff called as home, as getting that was the first hurtle.<br />
<br />
Ken e-mailed the Kennel Club and within minutes he received an answer about Fang. The dog had quite a family pedigree and the address came with a phone number and an e-mail what made the contacting of the owner as much easier.<br />
<br />
Ken laughed at that point in his investigating about Jeff, as how could he ask about Fang and his human mentality doggy cock as if the dog owner knew Jeff had merged with the dog’s body. There had to be some rural connection as to why from what Jeff blatantly requested that his quest must be close at hand; or he might well have become conjoined with the penis of a human male.<br />
<br />
Checking the locale around where Fang called home, Ken contacted the township office and requested a copy of the house taxation list, what gave the addresses of houses, the names of the owners, and a telephone number along with the state assessment of what the home was worth. Ken began calling, stating he was a repairman for the Play-to-Create gaming company. As he called, most denied they had such a game in their house and hung up on Ken.<br />
<br />
Nine phone numbers as called and Alice replied in the affirmative, and that her brother had become as a missing person, but the computer was still operating. Ken had then the address and he needed Jeff’s birthday still. Alice was very friendly and quick to answer the questions Ken posed, even to the birth date of Jeff, and that her parents decided to leave the computer operating as if doing so was of a lucky hope their son might return. Only Alice had tinkered with the program, and saw the original desired erotic plan. She told of Kitty being chased by her dad’s dog Fang, their other pet, as the cat ran into the bedroom and was caught walking across the keyboard.<br />
<br />
Alice was laughing when she told Ken as to the duration change done by Kitty, and her brother, wherever he was had if the machine did something real, would keep Jeff as he was for 13 plus years, and of that she was glad to be rid of him.<br />
<br />
Ken thanked Alice for the story and the needed information, as she asked if he resided close by, she was always willing for a hot date or a one might stand! <br />
<br />
Ken entered the information about Jeff and gained his entrance into the Play-to-Create game. Ken brought up all the preset perimeters Jeff typed into the program, and sat back in his chair when he saw what the cat had changed. He shook his head with the thought of disbelief; as he then felt shivering feeling began at his neck and trail down his body as a chill of fear ran throughout his flesh. Ken sat peering at the computer screen, as it notated the selected change away from the original setting of “Permanent and/or Irreversible!”<br />
<br />
There blinking in green letters and numbers read what somehow the dumb cat caused, was the new time slot showing in large numbers. “Minutes_13, Hours_13, Days_13, Months_13, Years_13:&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken stared at the time slot with amazed wonder. &quot;Changed now, for thirteen years, thirteen months, thirteen days, thirteen hours, and so many such minutes, meant in total that Jeff might well remain as a horse cock for the total of 14 years, 1 month, and 13 days, 13 hours, as 13 minutes, was his lifespan of being doomed!&quot;<br />
<br />
“Well,’ Ken exclaimed as he chuckled, “It is slightly less a duration of living vile than to be as permanently a horse’s cock!”<br />
<br />
Ken had the control of Jeff’s first game setting as duplicated onto his laptop. He transferred from the Cloud security backup the recorded scan of Jeff’s D.N.A. pattern; not that for the next 14 years it would be of much good. He decided to report back to Jeff of his findings, and ask a few more questions to clarify what Jeff might want to do as next, if there was a next to do?  <br />
<br />
Just after midnight was when Ken with his L.E.D. lantern in hand did enter the stable where Jeff, and his host stallion should be asleep. As quiet as ever Ken entered the stable from the pasture side. The door to the stable stood open for to aid with cooling the interior barn temperature. He used the non-direct light of a near full moon to get close to where Jeff was lying dormant, his stallion asleep.<br />
<br />
When Ken lit up the lantern the bright light worked to disturb awake the stallion and he stood up as if alert and ready for whatever.<br />
<br />
“Jeff, it is me Ken, and did I discover what happened to your game settings, your cat changed the duration setting from…” Ken babbling about his news, as then from the tack room the voice of a man said, “I tend to shoot trespassers, and have the local police ask the questions!”<br />
<br />
Ken fell back from where he had knelt and with the light from his own lantern he saw a man, likely the horse’s owner holding a sawed off scatter shotgun pointed at the ground.<br />
<br />
“Please excuse the cloak and dagger style of my coming here, as I discovered something about your horse, that it holds two different life force entities, one being the animal and the second that of a friend of mine, he being Jeff Taylor, he was experimenting, he a science genius, tried his experiment and became as merged into the genitals of your horse. Now I know that plot sound dumb, but if you would please kneel down and with my lantern, check about the peak area of the sheath and see there a pair of small eyes, that being Jeff!”<br />
<br />
“What bullshit is that, you expect me to believe a story like that?” The rather angered man said, but Ken kept motioning as he went to lying flat on his back, beneath the stallion.<br />
<br />
The man stopped his grumbling when Ken lay under the stallion’s belly and held up his lantern into the stifle area of the horse’s groin. “Please look, Jeff is awake, his eyes are blinking.”<br />
<br />
Feeling miffed by what Ken said and did, the man knelt down and with the brightness of the lantern, to his amazement he saw two dime size eyes and black skin eyelids as blinking, looking back at him and Ken.<br />
<br />
“See, what I told you is, or was mostly true!” Ken said as the man then sat down and began petting a horse leg to keep the big horse as calm, while he looked at two eyes staring down at him.</p>
