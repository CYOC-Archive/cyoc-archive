<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lawrence exasperated, &quot;Okay, I know gargoyles can be big, there is no way any gargoyle <br />
other than the oldest of the old and the biggest of the biggest have ever been twenty-two <br />
feet tall! And THEY have all the grace and agility of drunk elephants!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fear can do powerful things to people's perceptions.&quot; Marie-Eliza said simply. <br />
<br />
Lawrence wasn't done, &quot;Cutting through Free's fingers. The daggers should not have been <br />
able to do that on their own... And not to mention cutting through ANYTHING IN EXISTENCE <br />
rather than just the magic seems rather odd to me. They could have just used the daggers <br />
to cut through the house's armor then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The bone daggers -hadn't- been able to do that before... the witches grounds thank to <br />
their pulling in of so much magic made it the most saturated place of magic on Earth at <br />
that moment, and the magic that flowed though those old bones was more intense than <br />
anywhere. It also meant that by proportion, that Running-Bear's pendants were in more <br />
danger of failing under stain there than anywhere.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;AND HOW did those thorns, that had already lost their geass, possible injury that leoman <br />
from before that still had his?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THe Thorns were recognized as being of the witches' magic, the geasses were not <br />
programmed to defend against such things by their very nature.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abbey asked a much less hard hitting question,  &quot;With Kathrine's head hair, how did people <br />
keep mistaking her for a female lioness? Wouldn't they mistake her for a male?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember Kathrine was a NUN now, cutting her hair short was a tradition. In the chaotic <br />
heat of battle, she could pass for what the leomans thought her to be well enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know how long our advantage of surprise with the bones weapons are going to <br />
hold up.&quot; Marie Cruz observed, &quot;They've had to seen us use them to shatter the geass <br />
around their fellows by now... &quot; Marie was worried at this point that witches might tire of <br />
waiting for their defenses to wear Marie's team now that it was clear that there was no <br />
army attacking and it was now down to four hunters. <br />
<br />
Linus spoke up like thunder, the only one there to serve in battles, &quot;WE DON'T HAVE ANY <br />
MORE TIME TO JUST STAND AROUND AND CHAT! EVERY SECOND WE SPEND SPEAKING NOW <br />
IS ANOTHER SECOND THEY HAVE TO RETALIATE IN A MORE ORGANIZED MANNER! KEEPING <br />
THE PRESSURE UP IS OUR ONLY CHANCE!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
Draco, Marie, and Kathrine realized that Linus was very very right. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
The two remaining outer leoman looked around frantically and called out, and quickly <br />
realized they were the only ones still on their feet outside... normally they'd have retreated <br />
inside... but the witches whom they had sworn their undying loyalty to had given strict <br />
instructions to give no ground. <br />
<br />
The remaining two male leoman outside decide to use themselves as a living wall between <br />
the four remaining hunters and the front door to the witches' house. Creative thinking <br />
seeping into their minds, one Leoman dropped his cannon.<br />
<br />
&quot;You handle yours,&quot; He said to his companion, &quot;I'll protect you if they get in close, and I'll <br />
help you load the weapon so you won't have to put it down and leave yourself vulnerable!&quot; <br />
<br />
The other Leoman nodded, both with grim determination to defend against these obvious <br />
creatures from Hell sent to prevent the witches free, fair, and equal world where everyone <br />
would be happy from coming about. <br />
<br />
&quot;To the end brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To the end brother.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
There had been ten leoman females transformed into males in preparation for the battle, <br />
and ten leoman had been assigned to protect the outside. <br />
<br />
This left Earl, the leoman male created for negotiation and luring people to Glendale inside <br />
with the lionesses and familiars, along with the other leoman male, whose name before her <br />
transformation into a lionesses had and always been in any version of reality Hera, but <br />
now, she had a new name now: Hercules whose physique lived up to his name. <br />
<br />
The human Jimmy really wished Lark was here, but she had been given the really important <br />
job of projecting Joella far away Outside the Manor. <br />
<br />
Dawn and Twilight saw the battle involving Kathrine and Linus from the windows. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dear St. Leon! Ohmygod,ohmygod,&quot; Dawn dared whisper the forbidden three letter word, <br />
there was no punishment for saying so, because none had ever said it. &quot;CAIN! SETH! <br />
Ohmygod! Twilight! They aren't breathing! They aren't moving! They're dead! Those <br />
monsters killed them!&quot; <br />
<br />
Dawn thought in horror, 'How could two humans, a dragon, a midget leoman, and a <br />
gargoyle slaughter their way through ten leoman males and another gargoyle? IT DOESN'T <br />
make any sense!'<br />
<br />
&quot;Dawn can you look after both Francis and Julianna for a moment?&quot; She said referring to <br />
the two lupman pups who were honorary members of the Witch Pride. Frank had once <br />
broken both arms of a Lupman with fur as black night who had tried to take them by force <br />
once declaring that Lupmans should raise Lupmans. The next lupman who tried with <br />
reddish brown fur had to be carried away by friends due to having two broken legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? I-I-think-so, but-why?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;There's a quick something I need to do. I'll be right back.&quot; <br />
<br />
Twilight calmly went to the house's kitchen of all things, and calmly took out a knife, and <br />
calmly cut the rune spelling 'revenge' onto her arm, and then carefully cut the same rune <br />
onto her back.<br />
<br />
Then she called out, &quot;Gloria! Rouge!&quot; The expensively dressed girls in the room full of child <br />
and child nudists came to the call obediently at once from where they had been playing <br />
with 'Zuzu' another of the former mob members. Yes playing.  <br />
<br />
The two red and crimson leoman cubs Flora and Peter Renard ... Mondain's two children, <br />
observed what happened next intensely and with absolute amazement and thrill. <br />
<br />
Twilight put a hand on each of the two human girls shoulders, and said, &quot;Girls, I need to <br />
you do something very special for me. Look into my eyes, see what I'm thinking behind my <br />
eyes, look at what you see, and at the same time, reach into the rainbow ocean you can <br />
see on the other side of the witches... and help me be all that I can be.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two confused familiar never the less obeyed and tapped into the infinite chaos while <br />
using the image in Twilight's mind to mold her body. <br />
<br />
Her figure remained lithe, agile, graceful, and perhaps beautiful, but her breasts receded <br />
into her chest, and her womanhood vanished, making her effectively genderless and with <br />
far fewer weak points. But 'it' also carried a feeling of non-personhood, and would not <br />
have been proper.  <br />
<br />
Her muscle mall increased, her claws became like black daggers. Her muscle mass <br />
increased again but she didn't look one iota of her agility or speed. Then an -extra- sets <br />
of arms GREW out of her below the armpits. Her skin under her fur became like leather <br />
armor. Her fangs became like those of a sabe-tooth tiger.  Her eyes turned completely <br />
gradient red. Then her vision split in two, and she felt another presence, which echoed her <br />
own. The two heads turned and looked at each other, able to function independantly, but <br />
able to hear each other's thoughts just fine, and united in their pure purpose.<br />
<br />
And a thought that was most uncivilized blazed in her mind -vengeance!- And Twilight <br />
knew it was uncivilized. But she didn't care. She felt the infinite chaos for less than a <br />
moment, and found it liberating. <br />
<br />
And Twilight became the single most efficient and deadly living killing tool created by the <br />
witches' magic in their lifetime, even the beasts created later by Kurse paled in <br />
comparison. Because her mind was crystal clear, with rage hot like an inferno and thoughts <br />
as cold as ice. She was something none of Kurse's creation had ever been, she was SANE. <br />
And that made her the most dangerous thing ever spawned directly by the witches magic <br />
save the Game of Transform or Dare itself. <br />
<br />
T-Twilight?&quot; The lioness looked in amazement. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's okay Dawn.&quot; The two heads echoed kindly. &quot;Don't worry. We're going to make sure <br />
those monsters never lay a hand on the witches or the children, or any more members of <br />
our Pride.&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
The half-age humans and lioman backed away while Mal'Akh let out a fearful feline scream <br />
and fell on her rear and scooted away. <br />
<br />
Vatican felt dirty from touching Free, but he reminded himself that she was technically in <br />
her original body, and thus was not a Soul Transferred and thus was not a breaking of the <br />
taboo. <br />
<br />
Vatican had no idea just how far away was far enough away from the battle that was now <br />
being wagged by four hunters against a full pride of leoman, three witches, and a small <br />
army of familiars. <br />
<br />
He laid down Free, the children didn't dare move close to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why... WHY ARE YOU BRINGING THAT THING HERE?&quot; Mal'Akh gasped. <br />
<br />
&quot;If she is a thing, then I am a thing.&quot; Vatican said simply.  And he looked at Free, &quot;And it is <br />
time you learned the other side of the story.&quot; <br />
<br />
The condition of Free's body had done nothing to weaken her resolve or spirit. She began <br />
to crawl BACK to the witches manor! <br />
<br />
'Just as any gargoyle would.' Vatican thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;I do not care. What your story is. I do not care what their story is. I will protect the witches' <br />
future of a world where everyone is free... hence my name, Free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The witches are taking -away- freedom, can't you see that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What I PROMISE: is to pursue, hunt down, and kill, and kill, and kill every single slaver, <br />
slave holder, plantation owner, slave trader, and seller, slave master, and slave owner in <br />
existence! My stone will be stained red with their blood!!! The witches have given me the <br />
power to do this, and I owe them to help them bring about the TRUE new world!&quot;  <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Sydney finished her shift, and left work early. The lavender she-wolf Sarah meanwhile after <br />
her distractions had reached an intolerable level hugged Ulysses and began to march <br />
straight for the entry room and determined not to leave until she figured things out.<br />
<br />
She looked at the statues intensely, she had to figure out what was drawing her attention <br />
so! <br />
<br />
The Monkey Prince was, of course, a monkey. Sitting on his rear with his legs frozen in a <br />
swimming motion. Atop his brow was a simplistic 'gold' crown (actually bronze like the rest <br />
of him). His curl turned behind him, looking excited and grinning ear to ear, his hands on <br />
the backs of the two other statues.  With a pair of sheaths between his legs like a lupman <br />
omega would have. Whose to say he wouldn't have had four if all the statues had been <br />
commissioned? <br />
<br />
The other two statues were Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi, or 'Sunny' and 'Luna' as the <br />
children called them for short unable to pronounce the foreign names.  The Monkey Prince <br />
wore a wolf pendant and vest and bracers for all four of his hands. <br />
<br />
Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi were made to look like human woman but with the heads of <br />
wolves and tails to match, the two wearing kimonos that were opened in front easily <br />
showing their breasts, their belles and womanhood. The two women were of course were <br />
tall enough that if they stood up straight their ears would go through the ceiling. And the <br />
Monkey Prince likely, while shorter, was big enough to grin down on nearly any Lupman <br />
and most Leomans.  Their expression were serene yet serious, intimidating, but noble, an <br />
interest contract to the Monkey Prince's happy-go-lucky impression. <br />
<br />
'It's like those two other hands are missing someone... of course they're missing someone <br />
since the other two statues weren't commissioned. But why does it feel like more than <br />
that?' <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Trevor opened and read the letter. It was like the envelope said and from the girl <br />
Kathrine... one he recognized as a girl he had saved from a bad man who had used the <br />
Dare to make her sing all the songs from a Disney movie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Trevor The Leoman. <br />
<br />
Thank you for saving me. That was very heroic for a leoman to do. I know precisely what <br />
would have happened if you hadn't saved me, and it wouldn't have been good. Thank you. <br />
Thank you. Thank you. I'm not sure what's real anymore, what's reality, what's fantasy. But I <br />
do know that I wish to thank you for saving me. Thank you... Thank you. Included should <br />
be my new home address, phone number, and e-mail. It would be an honor for you to <br />
contact me little man. For a Leoman, You're a Hero. Thank you.<br />
<br />
Love Kathy The Felman.&quot; <br />
<br />
All the girls present giggled.</p>
