<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Okay, to clarify a couple of points. Despite both being in the same grade, Julie Stovall only had Freshman lunch with Eric Anderson this semester, and the episodes featuring Doctor Twist&#39;s morning counseling session with the Stovall family are running a bit behind the rest of the story at the moment. NOW THEN...}}<br />
<br />
As Moon Lake High School let out for the day, Brian Walker made quite a stir being picked up by the same stunning older blonde (Alyssa Cooper) that met him yesterday.<br />
Not saying a word to anyone other than the were-mermaid, who he gave a big kiss before throwing his book bag into its back seat, he hopped into the rented convertible smiling and waving at everyone watching as the odd couple drove off to Moon Lake itself for another afternoon of sexual hi-jinx.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
John the chauffeur picked up Frieda Knight, along with her friends Eric Anderson and Spencer Lawson, in the Knight family town car with much less noticeable fanfare.<br />
The three teenagers sat in the back with their seat belts on, with Eric in-between the ladies.<br />
&quot;Where to today Miss Frieda?&quot; asked John, knowing that Frieda preferred to be more down to earth with everyone when alone, compared to the airs her rich parents put on around the staff.<br />
Frieda looked at her friends, who simply shrugged, leaving the decision to her. The young werepanthress thought about it for a moment, and then said, &quot;To the local diner please.&quot;<br />
<br />
By the time they reached the lone diner of Moon Lake, the three teenagers had decided to go dutch treat, each paying for their own meals; despite the fact they all wound up ordering a burger with fries and a soda.<br />
As they occupied a booth in the rear, John the chauffeur sat nearby, where he could keep an eye on his charges while enjoying a chocolate malt.<br />
&quot;So,&quot; began Frieda, after taking a few bites of her burger, &quot;I thought since our plans got interrupted, we could do what we originally planned to do yesterday and get to know each other better,&quot; she suggested.<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Spencer, before recapping what everyone present knew about her being a hybrid were (her father being a wolf and her mother a panthress/cat mix), how her family bounced around because of her father&#39;s military assignments as a Navy SEAL, and her bad luck with boys before the Lawsons moved to Moon Lake and she met Eric.<br />
Then Eric told Frieda of his life in Minnesota as a geeky intelligent bookworm, before the Anderson family moved to Moon Lake after the end of the previous school year.<br />
&quot;It was amazing. Except for Nate in regards to wolves, we didn&#39;t even know what a were was until Samantha Twist told us about the town&#39;s mandatory were law*. Before the Fourth of July Nate was already howling for joy as a werewolf himself, and soon my folks joined the furry set as werefoxes, thus increasing the strength of their marriage vows via the vulpine life/mate bond foxes have.**&quot;<br />
&quot;So why did you wait so long to get a fursona too?&quot; Frieda asked him.<br />
&quot;Well, it wasn&#39;t that I was against the basic idea. But first I didn&#39;t know exactly what to be, and the rest of my family was cool with me still being a normal at the time. Then, after the new school year started here, Julie Stovall started showing an interest in me and kept talking about how I should become a were-merman to be with her. Yet I wasn&#39;t sure about my feelings for her then and, this may sound silly coming from a guy, but I wanted my first sexual experience to be something more special than just a way of joining were society,&quot; added Eric, as Spencer reached out to hold one of his hands and smile.<br />
&quot;No. I think that&#39;s sweet,&quot; admitted Frieda, staring at him. &quot;Of course you&#39;ve already told me over lunch today about how you and Spencer met after you caught Julie cheating on you with Brian Walker and then how you broke up with her after the second time she went behind your back with the were-otter. Yet both your parents and Spencer&#39;s were already swingers before moving to Moon Lake and hooking up with each other, besides other couples, right?&quot; she asked, to which her friends nodded affirmatively.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what about you? What&#39;s the Frieda Knight story?&quot; asked Spencer.<br />
&quot;In truth, there&#39;s not really that much to say,&quot; replied their friend, after taking a sip of her soda. &quot;I&#39;m a naturally born werepanthress and the only child, to date, of rich parents. The Knight family name goes back in history long before Moon Lake was founded, with only the Tachibanas of the Skulk being more successful business wise and rich overall. Dad handles practically all the business matters first hand while mom&#39;s busy with this charity and that cause, so I rarely see them most of any given day.&quot;<br />
Spencer and Eric were both about to comment when Frieda stopped them. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ve gotten used to it and adjusted well enough, if I do say so myself. Part of the reason I treat those in our employ more like people than staff. They&#39;re the closest thing I&#39;ve had to a family on a regular basis.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got us,&quot; her friends chimed in.<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t think I&#39;m unappreciative,&quot; Frieda said with a smile. &quot;A lot of my so called peers over the years have either been afraid to approach me because of the differences in our social standings, or were just hoping to somehow advance their own importance by befriending me. I&#39;ve learned to know the difference over time which is why, after Julie started her bullshit, I took a chance getting to know the two of you better. Since you were both relatively new to Moon Lake, neither of you knew about my family and accepted me as is.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I AM your friend, and more as the opportunities present themselves,&quot; whispered Spencer, holding out her hand to Frieda, while thinking about their get together yesterday afternoon.<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; whispered Eric, grabbing Frieda&#39;s other hand in his.<br />
Frieda quickly kissed both hands before releasing them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which reminds me. We still need your Skype contact info so we can start including you in our nightly before bedtime chats,&quot; said Spencer.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll write it down for both of you before we part company,&quot; promised Frieda.<br />
&quot;Yeah. And if I&#39;m Yin and Spencer&#39;s Yang, we need a nickname for you too,&quot; Eric pointed out.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind Whole,&quot; said Frieda, recalling the touching moment toward the end of their time together yesterday.<br />
