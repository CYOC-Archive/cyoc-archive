<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Word quickly spread about the brotherhood. Every adventurer and soldier under the sun knowing of this rugged group of bulky males. That they would raid towns and villages, capturing anyone in sight never to be seen again. Countless bounties were on their heads, and the head of their king. But no one was able to claim them, no hero returning from their missions to the bandit&#39;s stronghold.<br />
<br />
Though these impossible odds didn&#39;t stop most adventurers, and another group of three set off. Nirbolg, the catfolk wizard with lithe build and covered in blue robes. Morgri, a half-orc warrior showing off his pure brawn with only a vest and shorts covering his person. With their human leader in his full plate, Brant ready to earn some coin with his two friends. The group of them heading off to opened plains where these bandits live. Passing through an emptied town, buildings and shops in perfect condition, but not a soul in view. An eerie sight to all of them as Nirbolg hesitantly asks the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we... know why they don&#39;t kill captives?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brant letting out a laugh when hearing that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Worried we&#39;re going to become captives?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More worried they might be making some demonic abomination.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, they&#39;re bandits. Ain&#39;t smart enough for that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brant looks to his two companions, ready to join the conversation until he hears movement around them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet! We&#39;ve got guests!&quot;<br />
<br />
The group stands together, drawing weaponry as they look for the source of the sound. Three bandits stepping out from behind one of the larger buildings. Each somewhat similar in appearance with broad and muscular bodies covered in brown hairs, everything exposed to the world as not a single piece of clothing covers them. Each of them standing at least seven foot tall, all three men with beards and strong features. The central bandits beard reaching down to his neck, strands braided with tight bands. The one to his right having short cut hair and well-trimmed beard, but his body is covered in tattoos. While the one on the right has an unkempt and wild beard, but not a single hair on the top of his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bandits! If you surrender, we will let the courts decide your fate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brant says to the newcomers. Though the bandits just laugh, the central one taking a step forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah. We&#39;ve got other plans.&quot;<br />
<br />
The three brigands run over to the adventurers. No weapons on their person, but ready for a fight. Brant and his squad meeting the brutes on the field. Him and Morgri charging forward, while Nirbolg stays behind. The braided brigand meeting the human in combat, the bold against the half-orc, and the last managing to slip past the frontline and reach the catfolk.<br />
<br />
Brant strikes at the bandit with his sword, but each strike is dodged with ease. His shield ready to deflect any blows, but no blows come. Instead, his opponent seems focused on grabbing the adventurer or controlling his movements. Brant&#39;s face nearing the brutes sweat covered pits several times, smelling the rancid and mighty smell of this wildman each time he is close. It is so mighty... so enticing. It&#39;s the smell of a true man, one covered in muscle and hair...<br />
<br />
His focus starts to waver, eyes glancing at each inch of this bandit. The mighty pecs bigger than his head, tight abs leading down to his currently erect cock. Surrounded by thick brown hairs, with dick thicker than four fingers. Ten inches long and dropping pre onto the dirt, which produces a scent that is just as delightful. Brant&#39;s sword drops to the ground as the bandit looms over him, two hands placed on the sides of his head as he is forced to look to the now grinning brigand. Brought slowly to the man&#39;s lips, as they lock in a kiss for only a second, before the adventurer is roughly shoved against the victor&#39;s underarm. Nose taking in every scent of his opposition, letting the sweat wet his nose and the smells dominate his person. Feeling his body alter with the smell, his armour pressing tight against his now larger chest. Bringing in images of a new version of himself, brown haired and broad bodied. Standing tall and proud with the rest of the bandits, ready to spread further and further...<br />
<br />
&quot;BACK OFF!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brant&#39;s concentration returns as he hears the voice of his half-orc friend. The bandit currently pinning him being pushed back and the adventurer let go. Seeing the light of the sun once more, Morgri staying by his side as the brute ahead quickly recovers. His greenskinned friends&#39; pecs seem larger than before... but there is now time to focus on that now. The bandit starts looking to the two of them with a smirk, before slowly circling around. Both the human and half-orc taking deep breaths, weakened from their battles and fighting off the effects of the bandit&#39;s musk. Not ready to make a strike of their own, and not needing to as the brigand backs off. Rejoining his brothers, one of which stands towards the adventurers with arms crossed. The other having Nirbolg&#39;s face stuffed under his pits. The catfolk eagerly moving his nose up and down the bandit&#39;s underarm, as the bandit undoes his captives&#39; robes. Exposing his golden fur to the world around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! Nirbolg!&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgri says as he charges forward, though Brant places a hand on his shoulder, stopping him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m barely holding on. Just looking at them is... affecting me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He feels his cock throb, taking in their might once more before shaking his head. Morgri just as affected, his dick tenting his loincloth, green flesh tickled by the cold air as he watches the brutes as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck! But we need to save him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nirbolg&#39;s now is in the complete nude. His thin body a good two feet shorter than these bandits, and far from impressive. Not a single bit of bulk on the catfolk, though that starts to change. His back pressing out as he continues to absorb every smell he can. Hunched over for some moments until the front of him catches up. Expanding as smooth skin becomes showy muscles. Definement seen past the fur, two meaty pecs as big as the rest of the bandits. Followed by a trail of abs down his stomach as his entire body grows. Easily reaching seven feet tall now, his arms holding onto the back of the bandit as they too become brutish and fitting with his new companions. Nirbolg&#39;s face leaving the brigands pits, the catfolk licking his lips as his fur goes from gold to brown. Starting from the top of his head and moving down like a wave, bringing changes with it as more definition strikes his form. His legs becoming strong like stumps and barbed cocked growing several inches. The feline&#39;s hand instinctively being raised into the air as the bandit holding him leans in and takes a sniff, seeming satisfied before bringing the catfolk to his knees.<br />
<br />
Morgri and Brant cannot look away, stunned to see their friend go from a shy and thin wizard to a muscular and cocky brute that resembles these bandits. Even his face and expression look different. Jaw more squared, a few fangs pocking out of his mouth. Fur around his chin longer and wilder, mouth naturally resting in a smirk. Nirbolg happily getting to his knees and bringing his mouth to the bandit&#39;s dick. Taking in all ten inches, nose smooshed against the brutes&#39; pubic hairs as he once more takes in the smell. His lover holding onto the back of his head and thrusting in and out. Giving short moments of rest to the catfolk so he can take in more of his fellow&#39;s stink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drink it all down, and you&#39;ll be ours.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bandit says, Morgri turning to Brant, furious.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can still help him! C&#39;mon Brant!&quot;</p>
