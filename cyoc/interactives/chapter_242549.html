<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The murder scene of the Dogmen at the state park had been quite a grisly one for many who were there. Director Meyers decided to hold a meeting in the briefing room back at S.P.E.A.R. headquarters and invited the Moreland demon hunting group to join them since they were also in deep on the &#39;Seraphim&#39; situation as well. Director Meyers had some last minute business she had to attend to before she arrived at the briefing room, so it gave some of the group there some time to catch up on other matters to lighten the mood a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how have things been over in the kitsune realm?&quot; Tom Harris asked his cousins Aaron and Haley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things have been relatively quiet ever since the end of the war. My grandma and grandpa have been continuing peace conversations with other leaders since the end of it. That&#39;s how I met Ikuro here, he&#39;s the royal guard for Lady Odayakana.&quot; Haley explained as she held onto Ikuro&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and since we&#39;ve been dating, I&#39;ve learned from her friends and family that Haley is....quite the character.&quot; Ikuro said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know.&quot; Tom and Aaron both said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what did you think of the kitsune realm Nyx?&quot; Tom now asked Aaron&#39;s girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s really beautiful and I had a real good time there. Aaron and I got to dress up and have a nice dinner,&quot; Nyx said leaning on Aaron&#39;s arm as he blushed. &quot;I also met his uncle Fukushu and he certainly seemed very introspective about a lot of stuff.&quot; Nyx commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;On that I agree with you princess Nyx. I myself thought that when he tested my resolve.&quot; Ikuro said as Haley patted him on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, don&#39;t let it get to you. My uncle&#39;s a lot of things, but if you survived a fight with him then I think even my mom&#39;s have a greater respect for you.&quot; Haley smiled as Ikuro now rubbing his neck in slight embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, the way you talk about the kitsune realm sure does make me miss home sometimes. It&#39;s been a while since Nyx and I have been back. I hope everyone back home is doing alright.&quot; Andromeda said as Nyx nodded in agreement with her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re all doing fine over there sis.&quot; A new voice suddenly said as Andromeda and Nyx looked over at the briefing room door to see their brother, Brendan, coming into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brendan!&quot; Andromeda and Nyx both exclaimed joyfully hugging their brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s great to see you again, but what are you doing here?&quot; Andromeda asked as she and Nyx let go of their brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was actually Miss Cheyenne who thought I should come over here. She was talking with her daughter and thought I would be the perfect candidate to be the diplomat for the family.&quot; Brendan explained as Nyx and Andromeda both agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brendan, you remember our boyfriends, right? This is Aaron, my boyfriend, he&#39;s a kintaro.&quot; Nyx said re-introducing Aaron to Brendan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I remember you. Pleased to see you again.&quot; Brendan said shaking Aaron&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and you remember Chase, right? Caleb&#39;s youngest brother?&quot; Andromeda reminded Brendan hoping that would like Chase better than Caleb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I can&#39;t forget you. I gotta say, I&#39;m still amazed you survived that brawl with Little Ann.&quot; Brendan said shaking Chase&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, thanks for reminding me, I&#39;m sure I still have the bruises to prove it.&quot; Chase casually joked as Brendan nodded understanding it wasn&#39;t the most pleasant memory for Chase.<br />
<br />
Not too long after, Director Meyers entered the briefing room carrying a few folders with her and she asked that every sit down so she could get the meeting started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you all for coming here. The recent brutal attacks from Seraphim have become even more brutal as of late based on what happened with the Dogmen and the vampire that was reported at the church from Connor Moreland and our mediator, Brendan Tepes.&quot; Hailey explained. &quot;Now, I&#39;ve gone back and forth on this, and I&#39;ve decided that the best thing to do in this situation to draw Seraphim out is another sting operation. One that will be successful this time.&quot; Hailey said eyeing Aaron, Chase, Andromeda, and Nyx. &quot;Now unfortunately at our last sting operation, there were....complications and some of our agents were exposed to our enemies. So was there anyone here who wasn&#39;t seen by Seraphim and their forces on our last sting operation?&quot; Director Meyers asked the group assembled before her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, me and Ikuro haven&#39;t seen this Seraphim person before and they haven&#39;t seen us, so they wouldn&#39;t really recognize us, right?&quot; Haley Harris suggested as she raised her hand and pointed to herself and Ikuro.<br />
<br />
&quot;They haven&#39;t, so it could probably work with you two. However I don&#39;t think they would find kitsunes to be aggressive, do you think you two could pose as a human couple out on a romantic stroll?&quot; Director Meyers asked them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, no problem there.&quot; Haley said holding tightly onto Ikuro&#39;s arm as he blushed a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, well I know you two can take care of yourself, and we&#39;ve got plenty of back up for you both once Seraphim and the Superior Church group show up. Agent Harris,&quot; Hailey said addressing Tom. &quot;Based on the information we have regarding Seraphim, they seem to have some pretty durable armor. Do you think your ferrokinesis will be powerful enough to handle going toe-to-toe with Seraphim?&quot; Director Meyers asked Tom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t met anyone yet that was more powerful than me yet, but I&#39;m pretty sure I can withstand whatever this guy throws my way.&quot; Tom reassured Director Meyers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear it. Now our only concern is who can be a surrogate to go after Haley and her boyfriend. It can&#39;t be another kitsune, vampires might do the trick, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;d fall for that again.&quot; Hailey said trying to think before looking at the files she had been carrying of Henry and Effie Amberhill she had been studying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I think I know who we could ask for help on this.&quot; Hailey said rubbing her chin with a smile.<br />
<br />
*****************************************************<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we&#39;re not going to help you.&quot; Eliana Hoti said sitting on the couch in her living room with Lilith Kane sitting next to her also crossing her arms while Alyssa and Rebecca stood nearby their mothers listening to what Director Meyers was asking them.<br />
<br />
&quot;But this is important, and you would finally help us bring in this assassin we&#39;ve been after for years. Besides we have more allies this time around and you and your daughter would be a great help to us.&quot; Hailey Meyers explained to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you just said it yourself. You seem to have plenty of allies helping you, so then why ask us?&quot; Lilith now asked Hailey.<br />
<br />
&quot;News of what happened with Henry Amberhill has spread throughout the werewolf community and it&#39;s no doubt gotten to Seraphim and their allies. So I was thinking that you, Eliana, and your daughter could pose as aggressive werewolves pretending to attack an innocent couple to lure out Seraphim. They&#39;re part of the demon hunters, and a couple of kitsune, so you won&#39;t have to worry about hurting them at all.&quot; Hailey suggested to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you mad?! My daughter just survived an attack from that monstrous family, and now you&#39;re asking the two of us endanger our lives again?!&quot; Eliana asked shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Not at all! I swear to you, both you and your daughter will be safe and sound. We have plenty of agents and allies who&#39;ll be watching your backs should anything go wrong.&quot; Hailey promised as Eliana just shook her head.<br />
<br />
Lilith looked over at a family picture of her and Alyssa together with Eliana and Rebecca smiling and a sudden thought came to her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are....are there other children out there who could be in danger from this &#39;Seraphim&#39;? Like other werewolf children or vampire children?&quot; Lilith asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We believe so, yes. There recently was a community of Dogmen and....there may have been children in there, we&#39;re....still analyzing bodies.&quot; Hailey sighed as Rebecca and Alyssa gasped hearing that news.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay! Excuse us, but we&#39;re going to have a quick family meeting.&quot; Lilith said as she rose up out of her seat and took Eliana, Alyssa, and Rebecca into the kitchen to speak in private. Lilith&#39;s mother, Mary, was already in there sitting at the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilith, please don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re actually thinking that we go along with this insane plan?&quot; Eliana asked her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I am. But Eliana, listen,&quot; Lilith said holding her friend&#39;s hands gently. &quot;You and Rebecca survived quite the ordeal before with the Amberhills and I don&#39;t want to see either of you get hurt. But this our chance to help other families out there in the supernatural community that weren&#39;t as lucky as us. Alyssa and I could also be there to back you up in our solar guardian forms too. As your best friend, I can promise you that you and my goddaughter are going to be in the best hands.&quot; Lilith promised giving Eliana a warm smile.<br />
<br />
Eliana looked at her friend and wholeheartedly believed her as she knew Lilith would literally go to hell and back for the two of them. Eliana now grabbed Lilith and pulled her into a great big hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rebecca, Alyssa, are you two sure you want to go along with this as well?&quot; Eliana asked her daughter and Alyssa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course mom, this could also be our own way of helping out mister Moreland for what he did for us.&quot; Rebecca said as Alyssa nodded along with her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need my help?&quot; Mary Kane asked Lilith as she sat at the kitchen table.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we&#39;ll be fine mom, but thanks for asking.&quot; Lilith reassured her mother as Mary stood up to hug both Lilith and Alyssa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take good care of yourselves out there.&quot; Mary said to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks grandma, we will.&quot; Alyssa said hugging her grandmother.<br />
<br />
Eliana, Lilith, Alyssa, and Rebecca now exited the kitchen to come back out and speak with<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, we&#39;ll do it. Provided you take the utmost care that our kids are safely away from any danger.&quot; Eliana said to Director Meyers.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have my word, I won&#39;t let your kids get harmed in any way.&quot; Director Meyers promised as she, Eliana, and Lilith shook hands.<br />
<br />
************************************************<br />
<br />
It was night when Director Meyers&#39;s new sting operation went into effect. Andromeda had actually suggested to make the scene look more realistic with Haley and Ikuro dressed up fancy. It was quite different for Ikuro to see Haley dressed up as his eyes widened at the beautiful sight of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you....you look amazing.&quot; Ikuro complimented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, you know, I was never much the dress up type, that was always Kari. I mean, I like to dress up, but really it&#39;s only for special occasions or the like.&quot; Haley said starting a conversation to make it look casual.<br />
<br />
As they were walking along, they took notice of several civilians around them. of course these civilians were S.P.E.A.R agents while some of their companions were waiting in hiding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, and please don&#39;t tell her I said this when you see her in person again, but, I think you look even more beautiful than Lady Odayakana.&quot; Ikuro praised as Haley blushed a bright red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Oh, wow, uh...thank....thank you. Like I said, I never pictured myself as much of a princess, I always pictured myself as a warrior.&quot; Haley said as they made their way to the point where Eliana and Rebecca would come out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t you be both? If you and I were together the rest of our lives, I would treat you as both a princess and a warrior, for you are my warrior princess.&quot; Ikuro again praised as Haley gave a loving smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa....so you see me like Xena?&quot; Haley asked invested in the act, although Ikuro was very committed to it and Haley took it word for word.<br />
<br />
&quot;If this....Xena is a warrior princess, then yes, be my warrior princess.&quot; Ikuro said as he now gave Haley a passionate kiss on her lips as Haley realized this was the first time they had kissed on the lips before now and although Haley knew that the two had to continue the act, Haley realized in the moment just how in love with Ikuro she was.<br />
<br />
Suddenly they heard a rustling in the bushes and both Ikuro and Haley looked to see two werewolves emerge from the bushes. Haley gave a startled scream as Ikuro tried to look equally frightened. Both of them now ran as Eliana and Rebecca chased after the pair hoping that the plan was working. Eliana and Rebecca had been told to make it look real, but not too real, so they slashed at Haley&#39;s dress and Ikuro&#39;s suit and after about five minutes of chasing and threatening them, the four of them suddenly saw a few trucks pull up. The so called &quot;Superior Church&quot; had arrived, just as planned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Restrain the beasts! Restrain the beasts!&quot; Shouted one of the soldiers.<br />
<br />
Eliana and Rebecca held their own as best as they could waiting for S.P.E.A.R&#39;s target to show up as they defended themselves against the Superior Church soldiers. Soon, a lot of them stopped trying to fight the beast and continued to restrain them as they watched as &#39;Seraphim&#39; now made their way onto the scene. Seraphim activated a button on their arm and revealed a hidden silver blade as they made their way over to Rebecca. Seraphim raised their arm preparing to strike Rebecca dead, but they never made it that far.<br />
<br />
&quot;FREEZE YOU SELF-RIGHTEOUS SANCTIMONIOUS SHIT BAGS!!!&quot; Director Hailey Meyers shouted as she came out from hiding along with several other S.P.E.A.R. agents. <br />
<br />
The Seraphim raised their arms first, before elbowing one of the soldiers of the Superior Church and tossing them at a nearby S.P.E.A.R. agent to get to their motorbike. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it! Harris, you&#39;re up!&quot; Director Meyers said into her communicator.<br />
<br />
The other S.P.E.A.R. agents rounded up as many Superior Church soldiers as they could, at least the ones that didnt&#39; take their cyanide pills.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Lilith and Alyssa rushed over to Rebecca and Eliana to check on the two of them. Eliana was holding and comforting a terrified Rebecca.<br />
<br />
&quot;Becca, it&#39;s okay, you&#39;re alright.&quot; Alyssa said reassuring her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t scary.&quot; Rebecca said taking in a few deep breaths.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know honey, I know. I was scared too.&quot; Eliana said kissing her daughter on the head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alyssa come on, let&#39;s catch up with that Seraphim character, maybe we can give that Harris guy some backup.&quot; Lilith suggested to Alyssa who nodded her head and the mother daughter Solar Guardian duo took off to catch up with Tom Harris and Seraphim.<br />
<br />
Tom Harris may not have been a police officer anymore, but he certainly felt like one again chasing after the Seraphim perpetrator. He was also lucky that it was a slow night for road traffic as he chased after Seraphim in his vehicle. Once or twice, he tried to ram into Seraphim to knock them off their motorcycle, but they manage to hold on tightly to it. Tom was equally surprised when Seraphim took out a fire arm and began carefully aiming at Tom in the driver&#39;s side. The window was certainly getting cracked and Tom didn&#39;t feel like getting glass on his body, so he thought of another idea and turned off road. Seraphim was confused as to why he had done the move, but kept a watchful lookout before seeing Tom ram into Seraphim and the motorcycle too late and knocked them off of the bike.<br />
<br />
Seraphim carefully stood up as they revealed the hidden blades in their armor as Tom smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice parlor trick, wanna see mine?&quot; Tom teased as he used his ferrokinesis to form armor on his body and made a weapon as well to fight against Seraphim.<br />
<br />
Tom had faced a lot of thugs before as a cop and could tell one fighter from the next. This Seraphim person wasn&#39;t any slacker and knew their way around in a fight. The fight was a brutal one as Tom could feel every it and every kick against his body. Seraphim seemed to be taking in a few breaths too, before continuing. At one point Seraphim caught Tom off-guard and managed to knock him back onto the concrete. Seraphim held their blade and Tom barely had enough time to make a ferrokinetic shield and held it as firmly as he could against Seraphim before he could barely hold his arms up anymore. As Seraphim brought their blade up to strike Tom, a sudden metal disc was thrown at Seraphim&#39;s direction knocking them back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you two doing here?!&quot; Tom asked surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Backing you up, you look like you needed it.&quot; Lilith answered as Alyssa threw some more of her discs at Seraphim before Seraphim caught the discs and began tossing them back at the three of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look out!&quot; Alyssa shouted as Alyssa, Lilith, and Tom dodged out of the way of Alyssa&#39;s reused weapons.<br />
<br />
Lilith could see that Seraphim&#39;s helmet had been damaged from the fight with Tom and chose just the right moment to use her staff strike Seraphim&#39;s helmet as hard as she could making it fall off and Seraphim fell backwards underneath a street light.<br />
<br />
Lilith, Alyssa, and Tom all watched now to see Seraphim rise up on their feet and all three were surprised to see a woman beneath the helmet who looked to be in her early forties. But that wasn&#39;t the most surprising thing to the three of them, she looked vaguely familiar. That was when Alyssa transformed from her Solar Guardian form back to her civilian from.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sophie?&quot; Alyssa asked.<br />
<br />
Seraphim looked confused eyeing the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who the hell is Sophie?&quot; Seraphim asked as it was Lilith&#39;s turn to transform back into her human form as Lilith and Seraphim now looked at one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are...?&quot; Before Seraphim could finish the question she suddenly touched her ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it, I&#39;ll be waiting.&quot; Seraphim said as a sudden truck zoomed between the two of them before something dropped in front of the trio.<br />
<br />
Tom immediately recognized it to be a flash bang and grabbed Lilith and Alyssa as fast as he could and turned them around and plopped them onto the ground as the flash bang went off.<br />
<br />
A few minutes went by before the rest of S.P.E.A.R showed up including Director Meyers who was looking at Lilith.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lilith, get up. Your daughter says you and her recognized Seraphim?&quot; Hailey Meyers asked as Lilith looked around to see several faces looking at her to see if she had the answer they all had been waiting to hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s....it&#39;s....my older sister. I thought she had died, but she&#39;s alive somehow. Sophie Kane is Seraphim.&quot;</p>
