<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty ran his hand over his distended abs.  He felt their size, their shape, their solidity.  He turned to his side in the mirror and looked at the muscle gut he created, loving how it heaved from his torso.  He tore himself from his thoughts, feeling he had done enough for now, and turned to leave the room.  He couldn't though.  His huge erection kept him from turning to the door, hitting the wall beside it. <br />
<br />
 'Stop being erect for a bit will ya. After I'm out, you can get bigger.'  and it happened.  Softening in hartbeat, his 18 inch cock hit the ground with a meaty thud, permitting him to leave the room.<br />
The second he walked into the hallway it swelled again, his crotch expanded instantaneously up past its 23 inch erection to a huge 27 inch hard-on; it HAD gotten bigger as he had said. Ty supported his massive rod as best he could and thought to himself ' These commands are getting far to litteral.'  He waddled to the living room holding his manhood, and trying to get as much motion out of his massive legs as possible.  He sat in front of the TV and turned it on.  It was difficult to see the screen past his cock, but he guessed it would soften eventually.<br />
<br />
  He was greeted by a weight loss ad, you know those ones where everyone is a model or a bodybuilder under their fat? 'Mark could use that stuff.' he said with a slight chuckle.  He stopped chuckling when he noticed his hand feeling his muscle gut again.  He would try being fat next, but he was already huge.  ' I wish the scale was here.' he said.  Ty wasn't surprised to see the scale in front of the couch, then he wished for a large mirror.  With all things set up, he stood on the scale 'I wish to lose 50 pounds of muscle mass.' and he started to shrink in the mirror.  Looking down at the scale, he noticed it read 370 pounds, so he had been over 400.  <br />
<br />
  'I wish Dustin was in the kitchen, and that he would constantly cook and bring me food, until the house has none left in it.'  A clatter of pots was heard, and Dustin ran into the living room with a large bowl of cereal. He still looked 13, which was kind of creepy, so Ty Wished he looked like he did when he was 16, but he wished that Dustin would keep his 13 year olds cock just for being a jerk.<br />
Ty made his next wish a good one. 'I wish that every bit of food I eat in this house would make me fatter, and that the ammount of fat added on would equal exactly what I had just eaten.'  without finishing the wish, he thought of what Mark looked like with his new weight.  He had boobs and his face had retreated slightly into a second and third chin, and Ty didnt want that. ' I want all the weight to go to my ass, thighs and stomach, and that I could eat every bit of food in the house in one sitting.'  Confident in his new wish, Ty sat and got ready to chow down.<br />
<br />
  He picked up the huge pot filled with ceral and milk, it had to weigh at least five or six pounds, so he decided to give it a try.  He tilted the pot to his face, and began to guzzle it down.  It felt like seconds until he finished.  He looked in the mirror, waiting for something to happen, but he couldn't tell whether or not he'd changed yet, since it was only 5 pounds.  The scale spoke true though, it registered him at 375 pounds.  He thought again, that this would take forever, even with all the plates that Dustin kept brining into the room. 'Change weight gained to double the mass of what was eaten, and make more mirrors on all sides, so I can see all the changes.'<br />
<br />
  He lifted the next pot, one heavy with macaroni and cheese.  It also weighed about 5 pounds.  He started to eat it, and again it was gone in an instant.  He looked at the mirror and waited, he could see his backside in the new mirror behind him and was amazed when he saw his ass fill out, maybe by about 5 pounds.  Then he looked at his stomach, his abs lost definition.  He was ready for the real fun.<br />
<br />
 'I wish for a machine to feed me any food that is in the room, and I wish that all of the food in the house was already prepared.' And in a flash, a large machine stood humming near the mirrors, and Dustin started to pour pots and plates of food into it.  A large tube dangled from the machine, and Ty placed it in his mouth.  The machine started with a whirr, and a thick fluid pulsed through the tube.  It reached Ty's mouth, and he was surprised that it tasted like chocolate ice cream.  The fluid pumped into his stomach at a high rate, and Ty had the pleasure of watching himself expand once more.  <br />
<br />
  His ass swelled out bit by bit, and his stomach lost its sharp cut look.  He could see a scale number projected on the mirror, probably so he could see his weight climbing.  It passed by 390, his stomach starting to droop.  He felt it growing outward, he felt his ass crack coming closer together with the fat piling up under his skin, and his thighs growing ever closer.  He passed by 400 again.  He was forming rolls on his stomach, and the top of his quads had smoothed out.  He wished Dustin and the machine into high gear, his gains started to come even faster.  He stood there bimping up stroking his 27 inch cock and his ever growing stomach.  His groin started to get some fat on it as well, and his cock started to look shorter.<br />
<br />
  He passed by 450, trying to hold his growing gut, only to have the fat grow out over his arms, his ass filled out considerably, and was starting to sag.  His thighs met in the middle, almost down to his knees.  Ty stood and grew.  The scale read that he was 600 pounds now, his stomach was getting most of the fat in it. and he was starting to look very disproportioned.  His gut no longer defied gravity, and started to use his erection as some kind of support. 'Oh, man. I wish all the food was in me now...' he thought, and the machine stopped.  He realized he had wished for all the food in the house to be in him right now, and there was a lot.  He wondered what was going to happen.<br />
<br />
  In a matter of moments he got his answer.  His stomach, ass, and thighs almost exploded with new growth.  Inches added on to each of them in seconds.  His weight climbed like crazy, adding 10 pounds every second like he had done in the bathroom.  He fell backwards from the shock, and the couch collapsed under him.  His rolls jiggled, and pictures fell off the wall.  But he continued to swell up.  His gut spread outward, nearly to the head of his dick, and his lower back and ass went in the opposite direction.  His thighs grew out, and pushed his balls under his gut.  His crotch had added on enough fat to make his erection only look 12 inches.  The growth had stopped.<br />
<br />
  Ty tried to encompass his new girth, but couldn't come close.  His waist had to be 10 ft around!  He peered up at the mirror to see the damage.  His weight read 1348 pounds.  He tried to stand, but couldn't.  He made one more idle wish though when he said to the sleepwalking dustin. 'I wish we had more food in the house...'</p>
