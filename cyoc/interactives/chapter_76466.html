<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You don’t want to change me?” asked Rose.<br />
<br />
“No,” said Colette.  “We never wanted to change anything about either of you.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” said Rose.  “Well, I’m ready.  What about you, Lily?” she asked her girlfriend.  <br />
<br />
“Yea, I’m ready,” Lily answered.  “So how do you do this?  What do you have to do?”<br />
<br />
I said to them, “There are two parts to this.  The first part might be a little uncomfortable,” I said.<br />
<br />
“Why?” asked Lily.<br />
<br />
“This is why,” I replied.  I used my enhanced speed to instantly run behind her.  I wasted no time in biting <br />
her with my fangs.  Lily moaned loudly in pain for a few seconds.  Her cries of pain changed into soft moans <br />
of pleasure.  Again I made sure to wish that I could not kill her.  Once I had enough I took out my fangs and <br />
held her limp body.  I put her down on the bed.  However, unlike Colette, she did not mutter or babble.  She <br />
looked asleep except for the fact that her eyes were open.  I looked at Rose.  “Are you ready?” I asked her.<br />
<br />
She stood up and took a deep breath.  “Yes, I’m ready,” she said.  I walked over to her.  She tilted her head <br />
to expose her neck.  As gently as I could I bit into her.  She moaned briefly and softly, though it did not <br />
sound like a moan of pain.  I got the sense that she smiled as I drank her blood.  Once I was done with her I <br />
placed her on the bed next to Lily.  Her eyes were closed, she didn’t say anything, but she did have a slight <br />
smile.<br />
<br />
“I just realized how unfair this is,” said Colette. <br />
<br />
“How’s that?” I asked.  <br />
<br />
“You get to have their blood, but not me,” she said.  “But I know why it has to be that way.”<br />
<br />
I motioned at her to lower her voice.  I walked over to her and whispered, “They’re still conscious.  There’s <br />
a few things I’d rather not tell them about for a while at least.  Like the ring and everything.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I get it,” she said quietly.  “You’re not going to give them all the same powers then, right?”<br />
<br />
“Not right now,” I said.  Colette didn’t look completely satisfied at that declaration.  “If ever,” I added.<br />
<br />
I went back to the bed in order to proceed with the second part of the transformation.  “Girls?” I asked.  <br />
There was no response.  “Rose?  Lily?”<br />
<br />
This time both of them came out of their trances.  They both sat up and simultaneously said, “Yes?”<br />
<br />
“In order to become like us, you must drink of my blood,” I said.  “Through it you will have our powers and <br />
abilities.”  I attempted to sound ceremonious, but the pretense was a bit too theatrical.  I performed the <br />
same act as I had with Colette.  I had one of my nails grow out and cut my wrist.  Again I took precaution to <br />
make sure I could not harm myself.  “Drink,” I instructed.<br />
<br />
Lily took my wrist first.  She took my wrist and sucked at it eagerly.  Rose took my wrist and was actually <br />
more aggressive in drinking my blood.  She drank more of it as well.  Once they finished I made the wish for <br />
them to become vampires.  Soon they clutched their throats and gasped for air.  They endured the same process <br />
of dying as Colette and I.  When both of them stopped breathing, I wished for them to not reawaken <br />
immediately.<br />
<br />
“Is there anything you’d like to restrict them from having?” I asked Colette.<br />
<br />
“No shape-shifting,” she said.  “I think you should make it so they don’t want that ability, so we can use it <br />
when we want.  Everything else is OK.”<br />
<br />
“Alright,” I said.  I wished for them to be revived with all of the powers except for the shape-shifting.  I <br />
also made it so that, while they would be able to read the thoughts of others, they could not read ours, nor <br />
could we read theirs.  I decided that was only fair, and Colette agreed.  <br />
<br />
As soon as they awoke, they ran to the mirror and admired their fangs.  They asked how they could make them <br />
vanish, and we explained that they just had to concentrate and they would retract.  They were both able to do <br />
so with ease.  We explained what powers and abilities they now possessed.  Both looked excited at the <br />
description of those abilities.  <br />
<br />
“Now that we’ve finally changed you two, what would you like to do?” I asked them.  <br />
<br />
Lily whispered something in Rose’s ear.  Rose’s face lit up.  Rose looked at me and said, “Well, Lily’s naked <br />
and you’re naked, so why don’t we all get naked and have some fun?”<br />
<br />
I turned around to look at Colette.  She already began to remove her clothes.  “Sounds good to me,” she said.  <br />
I turned back to Lily and Rose.  Lily was assisting Rose in removing her clothes.<br />
<br />
Very soon we were all on the bed and engaged in a mini-orgy.  Colette let Lily and Rose have a turn with me <br />
first.  I found that Rose had a better body than I had assumed.  I would still put Colette and Lily ahead of <br />
her, but she was more than attractive.  Colette made a great decision as it turned out, since her choice of <br />
Rose led to Lily as well.<br />
<br />
In order to make sure I could satisfy all three of my brides, I wished that I could become sexually aroused <br />
whenever it was needed.  This was an especially good idea since each bride decided that one time with me was <br />
not enough.  I was amazed by willingly and easily my brides pleasured each other when I was occupied.  We <br />
ended up going for two hours before we exhausted ourselves.</p>
