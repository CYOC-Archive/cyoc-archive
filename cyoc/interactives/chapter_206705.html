<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">7:00, again on the dot. It was time for school, so I turned in my sheets to get out of bed. Feeling a sudden pleasure in my groin as my dick pressed against the frame. I looked down and saw I was as hard as I could be. Last night I dreamed of Sam, his werewolf self alongside Mugrel. He helped his master break me into the pack, and I felt so good as the fur started to set in and my tail began to wag. Why did I have to find these werewolves so sexy?<br />
<br />
I waited a second for it to die down, then got out of bed and into the shower. Washing up, then drying off in the mirror. Dressing myself, which ended up being a bit of a chore. My shirt and pants were tighter than I remembered, my meaty body refusing to be fully covered by the fabric. My mass being only further defined by the clothing, as anyone could tell I was a sporty youth in ill-fitting clothes. My curling chest hairs escaping at the top of the shirts collar, with my now grabbable beard above it. It wasn&#39;t too long for concern, but you could grip a few hairs no problem. <br />
<br />
When going downstairs I found my food already on the table. Mum having left a note which I skimmed over &#39;Out shopping, lock up please. Love you, enjoy your day.&#39; Dad was nowhere to be seen either, so I wolfed down the food and walked out of the house. There were plenty of other kids on the road to school, looks like things are getting back to normal compared to yesterday. Though the other students were all looking different. Some bigger, some smaller. Some thicker, some thinner. My bracelet tightened as I noticed all these changes, just reminding me that this was normal with growing up.<br />
<br />
Finally reaching the school gate, there were teachers and staff around. Yeah, everything&#39;s gone back to the regular. Most of the teachers do have bracelets on them, and some have those oddities. Mr Spencer&#39;s is a foot shorter and with a long beard reaching his chest. Ms Vivet having rippling muscles throughout her body. While the third teacher I spot, Mr King, is growing his hair out and looks a lot thinner, giving the students a cheeky grin as they enter the school.<br />
<br />
I checked for Sam, but he was nowhere to be seen. I had to just go to class and hope I could see him there, spotting him as the roll was being called. Sam answering his name, and me looking to see my friend. He had gotten even bigger compared to yesterday. Fitting the perfect image of one of the school&#39;s jocks. Long blond hair with a clean beard having grown on his chin. Very top heavy with large torso and broad shoulders, and an almost mature look to him. He could pass as an early adult if he tried with the more defined features, not to mention the free-flowing hairs popping out at the top of his shirt. He was so hairy he made me look practically hairless by comparison. Sam eventually started to look at me back, giving a wink as I went red in the face. Now was not the time to be checking out my boyfriend, I still had a full day of school to go through.<br />
<br />
Class went by, and I kept stealing peaks at Sam. He seemed mostly the same minus the new look, but something was wrong. He was talking to the school jocks during the day, laughing and hanging out with them. He never liked any of the sporty kids at our school, they just bullied us and went on their way. But now it was almost like he was one of them, I even caught him showing that same dumb smirk. I had to approach him about this for lunch, and the moment the bell rang I got up and walked after him. He was moving quick with his new squad, and I only caught up when they sat down as a group for lunch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam-&quot;<br />
<br />
I called for him and was silenced as one of the jocks pushed me from behind, and Sam caught me with his strong arms. The group chuckling as my lips pressed against his, my boyfriend holding onto me tight as we embraced for a few moments. The others cheering and clapping for us. Sam ruffling my hair when it was over, looking to me as if everything was normal. Though I went bright red.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
&quot;W-whats up? A-a lot uh, ca- Can we talk somewhere private?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nah, wanna hang out with the guys for lunch. Plus we need to be somewhere in ten.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then... I&#39;ll come with you!&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry Ray, but this is only for the guys. Maybe another time, just remember to log into the game tonight.&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh? But you&#39;re a monster in game, we can&#39;t hang out. Oh, you&#39;re making a new character?&quot;<br />
&quot;Werewolf is sticking.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then uh-&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just be hunting you down Ray, no worries. Going to be a lot of fun. Already got the alpha&#39;s permission for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He kisses me before I can respond, pushing me back as I stumble, and the table goes back to its lively chat. The jocks and Sam acting as if nothing weird happened, while I tried to comprehend everything that did occur. Why was Sam hanging out with these people? Why was he so fixated on being a werewolf? What was he doing in ten minutes? I stepped out into the school hall, trying to find an answer to all of these questions at once. Only to take a few steps and feel a firm grasp on my right arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I saw all of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stared into the eyes of a boy my age. Shaggy brown hair and scruff on his chin, Martin, I think? He&#39;s a farm boy from the country, hell of a trip for him to get to school each day. Never really had any friends from what I knew, and he also seems to be one of the few kids without a bracelet. His emerald eyes looked into mine, as he bluntly stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yer friends acting weird. Whole school is.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know he&#39;s weird, but what&#39;s wrong with the school?&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t remember any of yall growing full beards or getting fit overnight.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s...&quot;<br />
&quot;Ya ain&#39;t gonna say it&#39;s normal. Can&#39;t be.&quot;<br />
<br />
He&#39;s right, it isn&#39;t normal. But why was I so willing to accept it as normal? I just had more questions added to the pile, Martin looking from the hall to Sam and his friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna find out what&#39;s goin&#39; on.&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh? How&#39;re you planning to do that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Easy, just follow them there jocks. Gotta be up to somethin&#39;, ya want in?&quot;<br />
<br />
He gestures to the table I was just at. They did just say they were going out soon... maybe it&#39;s a clue on why Sam is acting so weird. I was still at odds on what to think, if this was all just normal or if something concerning was going on. My bracelet trying to overwrite my mind, and I couldn&#39;t tell what was winning.</p>
