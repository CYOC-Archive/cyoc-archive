<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Frances&#39;s late afternoon got a look of potential difficulty. It had started with Yvette&#39;s call to talk with her, which she did answer. That lead to the revelation that completing Jenny&#39;s transformation had turned Yvette into a lesbian, or at least made her bisexual. Now, while Frances was well aware of the possibility of such a shift in sexual orientation, but that had only occurred in werecat transformations. Werecats were entirely a female were-beast species, which had lead the species being at least bisexual, and because of that if a heterosexual normal woman got a dose of werecat in some way, that normal would become at least bisexual in her transformation into a werecat. That had lead to werecats, regardless of their pride, being very careful with who they looked into recruiting. Had Martha not been bisexual, neither Frances nor Samantha would have advocated transforming her, regardless of what they thought of William&#39;s past mistakes, because they wouldn&#39;t want to force changes on Martha&#39;s sexuality. <br />
<br />
Both Frances and Samantha knew that potential all too well. While it didn&#39;t occur with them or with their pride specifically, while they were in college there was an accidental transformation of a normal. A werecat from a different pride was living in the dorms at the college and was given a normal roommate. The roommate had been born in Moon Lake, but was heterosexual and had been in a serious male/female relationship. However during a bit of rough-housing between the two roommates, the normal ended up being clawed by accident as she had tried to pounce on her werecat roommate while the werecat tried to climb up onto the bunk bed that the two had constructed. Neither noticed it at first, but a few hours later, the normal began to transform in earnest as the two got ready to meet with herself, Samantha, and the girl&#39;s boyfriend and go to dinner. The transformation was completed promptly, of course, but from when the two new werecats came out, the first werecat was in tears at the accident. The new werecat tried to assure her friend that it was an accident and that she didn&#39;t hold anything against her friend, but that didn&#39;t make it easier. In fact, between the former normal and her boyfriend, things rapidly went south as the new werecat had lost sexual interest in him, as her werecat transformation had made her a complete lesbian, and from she had told Frances that she&#39;d actually begun fantasizing about her roommate. The former boyfriend and girlfriend ended up being just friends and as far as Frances knew, the two new werecats married each other after graduation from college and were still together. The whole story had demonstrated the ability of werecat transformations to effect sexuality.<br />
<br />
But neither Yvette nor Jenny were werecats. They were werefoxes... werevixens, and to Frances&#39; knowledge, werefoxes were known for being strictly heterosexual. She wasn&#39;t sure that Yvette was truly acting, but her preliminary diagnosis on what Yvette had said was that Yvette was more likely to have been bisexual all along and had been repressing it, just as Martha had. The only difference between Yvette and Martha had been that Yvette had gone further with regard to repressing that side of her, but she would need more information, and since she was likely to be the psychologist called to do Yvette&#39;s psychological evaluation for the court, patient/doctor confidentiality would keep her from sharing what they discussed. She might report some basics to Samantha or to the Mayor in an official capacity, but she couldn&#39;t do much more and couldn&#39;t even share anything with Martha on the matter until after things had been cleared with the courts... and potentially if Yvette decided to allow what she had shared with Frances to be told. Besides, there was still too much to be figured out with Yvette before anything definitive would be known. <br />
<br />
While Frances did go to med school as part of her training to be a psychologist, as med school was a preliminary to the specialization in psychology, she wasn&#39;t as good with several of the sort of hormone and blood tests that the Skulk lawyer and the DA had likely asked for/agreed on, but she did know that the doctors in charge of the tests would include some explanation of the results when they sent copies of the results to Frances&#39; private clinic. And that was what she&#39;d need to come to a complete and accurate decision one what went on in Yvette&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
As she came out of the nurse&#39;s station, she caught the scent of weredog headed toward Yvette&#39;s room. While she wasn&#39;t an official part of the hospital&#39;s staff, she was sure that Yvette&#39;s mental status was likely fragile and too many visitors or pointed questions could change things. As such, for Yvette&#39;s mental state, Frances approached both of them rather than heading out as planned. They were likely detectives, but she had to make sure that they didn&#39;t do anything that would alter an already fragile mental state.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Frances spoke as she approached, &quot;can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The older detective glanced to Frances and blinked, &quot;You&#39;re here, Mrs. Twist?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yvette had called to speak with me earlier and I&#39;m likely to be assigned to do her psychological evaluation,&quot; Frances answered. &quot;So... I&#39;m here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two detectives glanced to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have anything that would say anything on her mental health?&quot; the older detective asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing complete... but I would think that her psyche is surprising fragile at the moment,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;and I will need to talk more with her in order to come to any firm conclusion... but I wouldn&#39;t want any really pointed questions being made that might hurt her psyche.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again the two detectives looked to her and then sighed. &quot;Very well. You can come in with us... as she might need some comfort with what we have to tell her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances raised an eyebrow, but nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;For warning... she&#39;s been pleasuring herself since completing Jennifer Harper&#39;s transformation,&quot; Frances then spoke.<br />
<br />
Both detectives looked to the door and noted that the main window through the door had the blinds drawn over it, preventing anyone from looking in. Frances noted that both detectives shuddered, but they did recover. They nodded and opened the door with Frances following quietly behind. They found Yvette still in her werefox form and still had her free hand under the blankets, and moaning slightly. The detectives cringed a little at the scent but did recover and Yvette did notice their arrival.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Yvette asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; the lead detective answered carefully, &quot;I&#39;m Detective Denny Miles and this is my partner Detective Jensen Lukasky. We have a few questions regarding your mother...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told the officers at the station that my mother&#39;s dead,&quot; Yvette answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... we know that,&quot; Denny answered, &quot;We found her body this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yvette looked on with a puzzled look, &quot;She died years ago. Why did you only just find her now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what we were able to find out was that no one contacted the local coroner/funeral home to arrange for the burial,&quot; Denny answered, &quot;and as her closest relative... that would be your responsibility to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d moved out before she died,&quot; Yvette answered, &quot;I wasn&#39;t there when she died... she left me ALONE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances stood by quietly. So far the two detectives hadn&#39;t done anything to aggressive, and that was a good enough place to start at least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you aware of the note she left behind?&quot; Jensen asked, &quot;we found a note among several medications that are aimed to correct for the excessive production of the hormones that help drive were sexuality as well as drugs that deal with depression and other mental issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She left me ALONE!&quot; Yvette repeated, now beginning to become irritated.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you let her body rot?&quot; Denny asked, his own irritation rising.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;ll excuse me...&quot; Frances cut in, &quot;are the two of you trying to investigate something or simply commit insults? Notifying the coroner&#39;s office or a funeral service on her mother&#39;s death... but unless you have proof that her death was directly caused by Ms. Smith&#39;s actions... this is bullying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re trying to find out the conditions on which the two separated,&quot; Jensen said weakly, &quot;the note claimed that Margaret Smith did claim to care for her daughter but had no way of reaching her... of helping her and that she was giving up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If she cared, she wouldn&#39;t have left me ALONE!&quot; Yvette answered removing her free hand from under the blanket and shaking it.<br />
<br />
&quot;In that sense we suspect her death was a suicide,&quot; Denny added ignoring the werevixen&#39;s comment, &quot;but we want to figure what caused it and why Yvette, here, didn&#39;t see that her mother was buried. May not be an outright crime... but it certainly would have been more responsible...&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances sighed and brought one hand up to rub at her temples. Things were getting to the point for her that date night would be limited to a simple dinner and cuddling and nothing more. It was that tiring.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can get you your answers when I do the psychological evaluation,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;but you aren&#39;t going to get them this way, and if you don&#39;t have suspicion of a crime... you&#39;ll only make MY job tougher.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Denny sighed, &quot;just file your conclusions with the police department with a forward to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances sighed heavily and nodded as the two detectives left. It was enough to make her start drinking. A part of her had figured that with the threat that Yvette posed over with, things would calm down, and yet there still seemed to be its surprises and frustrations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to evaluate me now?&quot; Yvette asked.<br />
<br />
Frances and looked to the female werefox, who was for the moment laying calmly on the bed. The room still reeked of sex, but Yvette hadn&#39;t picked up where she left off. Her eyes were focused on Frances and her pointed ears alertly raised.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that will be sometime tomorrow when all the paperwork is in order and when you&#39;re ready to answer questions that won&#39;t be trying to accuse you of something,&quot; Frances answered calmly, &quot;after all this... I&#39;d imagine things are a little charged up at the moment.&quot;</p>
