<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As my new shaggy friend ended his panting spree, he just as quickly and playfully tugged at the bottom of my T-shirt. Since the dog was my only companion at the moment, I saw no harm in offering up my T-shirt as a plaything for him. I took it off and immediately handled it over to him<br />
The dog grabbed my T-shirt and shook it a few times before managing to flip it over his head. It landed on his back and now looked like it was made for him.<br />
&quot;Here, boy...&quot; I beckoned.<br />
My shaggy friend padded over to me and I assisted him by putting his forelegs through the short sleeves of my T-shirt. And soon he was happily wearing my T-shirt and giving my now naked torso a friendly lick. I chuckled and then gave him a friendly rub behind his ears. <br />
Upon giving him my T-shirt and a friendly rub, I stood up, only to have the dog reach up and pull at the hem of my shorts. And as he did that much to my amusement, I couldn’t help but feel that the dog was making me strip down on purpose. But the notion that the dog was making undress for some unknown reason was just plain ridiculous. It had to be something else that was making me feel this way. <br />
But who could it hurt for me to have some fun with my shaggy friend by undressing in front of him anyway? It was just him and me and no one else. So I continued to undress myself for both our amusement. I peeled off my shoes, socks and shorts and gave them over to my friend. Feeling perfectly fine, I stood up again in just my briefs. I then looked at my friend and he looked up at me, and I found myself once again wondering if the dog was making me undress on purpose. <br />
&quot;What is it, boy? Something wrong?&quot; I joked with him.<br />
The dog then pawed at his collar until it slipped from his shaggy head and landed on the floor before him. With some bemusement, I watched as he picked it up and brought it to me. Was he trying to offer me his collar in exchange for the clothing I gave him? Yes, I guess that he was doing just that because upon me taking his collar, the dog padded back over to my clothing and attempted to nose into my shorts.<br />
&quot;Well you are certainly an odd sheepdog, I’ll give you that. So why don’t help you out here since you are so interested in wearing my clothing.&quot; I told him.<br />
And within minutes, the dog was sporting my shorts.<br />
&quot;How’s that?&quot;<br />
My shaggy friend seemed happy before returning to his collar and offering it to me again.<br />
&quot;Okay, boy, okay... if it’ll make you happy. A fair trade..&quot; I said as I picked up the collar from him and fastened it to my neck. *Click*<br />
No sooner I had put on the dog’s collar than I felt dizzy and warm all over. And I had the strangest feeling that I was becoming something else. My vision blurred and other senses reeled. The sensation lasted for a moment before I heard someone speak up.<br />
&quot;Feeling much better, boy?&quot; <br />
Opening my eyes again, I found myself looking through a veil of my own hair at a guy wearing the clothes I had just recently given to my shaggy friend. The guy was looking down at me with a concerned smile on his face. And he just smelled so ‘friendly’ that I wanted to happily greet him and get a scratch behind the ears?? I shook my head to clear it of these rather strange thoughts. But that action resulted in me receiving yet another surprise as my ears and lips flopped back and forth. I stood in shock for next several seconds and thought I must be imagining things, but when I tried to say something to this stranger before me, all I heard was...<br />
&quot;Woof, woof?&quot;<br />
I was woofing like a dog! I then realized that the thing I was looking across to see the guy before me was a bearded and mustache muzzle. I looked down at what I thought were my hands and arms. But what I saw instead were a pair of paws and forelegs covered in a thick shaggy coat of fur. A look over one shaggy shoulder confirmed that the rest of my body was just the same. I was.... I was a dog, a large shaggy sheepdog! And just when I thought I was going to lose and go happily and merrily insane, the guy before me spoke up.<br />
&quot;Don’t panic, my now shaggy friend.&quot; The guy told me. &quot;You’ll get use to being a dog and you’ll be well looked after by me.&quot;<br />
I cocked my head and looked incredulously at the man before me. He smiled and then chuckled.<br />
&quot;That’s right, you are going to be my pet dog just as I was the pet of the witch who use to live in this cottage. Your selfless act of kindness is what freed me of my curse.&quot; He told me before he looked at me sadly. &quot;You freed me of my curse unknowingly and as a result of your actions you have taken my place as a dog. And what’s worse is that you will be a dog in both body and mind from now on.&quot;<br />
I looked at my shaggy body with its thick shaggy fur coat. And then looked at my friend bemusedly. I didn’t know what made him so sad, but I was just as determined to make him happy. As soon as I thought to make my human friend happy, I felt something leave me. What it was I didn’t care. What mattered was making my friend happy again. So I padded over to him as he skulked and gave him a friendly licking.<br />
My friend smiled as I licked him. He squatted down before me and reached past my muzzle to give me a friendly rub behind my docked ears.<br />
&quot;Not to worry my friend, I’ll get over what the both of us had done here.&quot; He chuckled. &quot;I’ll get over it just as easily as you have become a real dog in both body and mind. And to prove that I am going to be okay, all I need to do is to command you.<br />
&quot;Woof?&quot;<br />
&quot;See for yourself... stand my pet, stand!&quot; My friend told me.<br />
I immediately reached up to my friend’s shoulders and then leaned up against him. My friend smiled at me and I smiled back before giving him another tongue bath. I panted happily and contentedly at my own canine accomplishment.<br />
&quot;Good boy! Good dog!&quot; He told me while giving me another of those wonderful ear rubs. &quot;Now how about we find a place to stay for the night. The two of us have got a big day ahead of us. I have to find out what has happened to the world while I was a dog to that witch. And you? You get to come with me as my pet dog. How’s that for you?&quot;<br />
I didn’t answer him with a woof or a bark. I just smiled and then gave him another friendly lick. My friend smiled back and chuckled.<br />
&quot;Good boy!&quot;<br />
&quot;Woof!&quot;</p>
