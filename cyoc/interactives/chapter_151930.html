<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Dad you home?”<br />
<br />
Kellie quietly closed her front door as she now scanned her home. Although Kellie was anxious about how her friends lessons were going, she had faith they would make the right choices. At least, that’s what she hoped.<br />
<br />
As Kellie opened her fathers study she could see the ancient wizard carefully studying several timelines intently. Looking up from his work he gave his daughter a small smile. “Kellie,” he said warmly. “I didn’t hear you come in. How do you think your friends are doing?”<br />
<br />
“Was hoping you could help with that,” Kellie stated as she pulled up a chair. “Have a feeling you’ve at least peaked in on them so far.”<br />
<br />
“And you would be right,” he answered. “I have glanced at the lessons however, I trust you judgement. The decisions in handing out apprentices was...interesting.”<br />
<br />
“Interesting Huh,” Kellie smirked. “Is that your way of saying I screwed up?”<br />
<br />
“Not at all,” Merlin said calmly. “In fact, you would be pleasantly surprised at how well the lessons are going. As well as how your friends are growing as not only wizards but as people.”<br />
<br />
Kellie gave Merlin a curious look, indicating she was interested in what he had to say. “Judging by your expression you would like for me to elaborate,” he said to which Kellie nodded. “Okay, for instance Kumi.”<br />
<br />
“What about her,” Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
“Well the wild, rebellious teen may not be quite as rebellious as you thought,” he said. “The girl seems solely interested in proving herself as a responsible levelheaded girl. True she has a wild streak in her but she seems determined to prove to not only her friends but to herself that she is more than what you think of her.”<br />
<br />
“Interesting,” Kellie said, rubbing her chin. “So what brought that on?”<br />
<br />
“Claudia’s brother Cole,” Merlin smiled. “The girl has seen what a possible future with the young man could look like and it has preoccupied her thoughts. She is determined to prove that she, like her doppelgänger, can have a happy and stable life.”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled. To think that the wild Asian teen that seemed so reckless when she first arrived could begin to change her ways truly surprised her. Kellie was now curious as to how the rest of her friends were doing in their lessons. “How about the others?”<br />
<br />
“Mary Elise and Mika seem to be building a friendship,” Merlin stated. “Mary has finally admitted to being jealous of the others. The poor girl has wanted nothing else than to be special and have the world see her as such. Mika however, has shown her that she has people that truly care about her. Mika has provided an olive branch to Mary that the girl will most certainly not forget.”<br />
<br />
“So what did Mika do?”<br />
<br />
“She has given Mary a cat,” Merlin smiled. “I know the gesture may seem odd, but it means the world to Mary Elise. Her father had promised her one before his passing and Mika has now fulfilled that promise. It also is quite impressive that the girl was able to instill life into an inanimate object.”<br />
<br />
Kellie gawked at Merlin as she too in this information. Bringing something to life was an impressive show of power that even the most highly trained wizards had some difficulty with. That a novice like Mika was able to accomplish the feat was incredible. “Incredible,” Kellie whispered. “And the spell was a success? This cat isn’t going to end up killing anyone or becoming some sort of vampire or something right?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Merlin chuckled. “I have studied the spell she cast. It appears she was quite successful.”<br />
<br />
Kellie breathed a sigh of relief as she now listened to Merlin talk about the others. Katie and Samantha had an interesting lesson as Samantha learned quickly that concentration was of the utmost importance. After shrinking to only 3 feet tall the Samoan teen was able to counter the spell she had cast and return herself to her original height without incident and with minimal embarrassment. Claudia too had proven to be quite capable in her spell work, while branching out and making friends. Despite temporarily transforming Karen into a teenage boy named Karl she had been able to form a bond with Karen. The two teens shared similar experiences with their fathers and had bonded over that fact. <br />
<br />
“Glad the lessons went well,” Kellie sighed. “Still, I am a bit worried about Claudia. Do you think Circe could turn her towards her side?”<br />
<br />
“It’s a possibility,” Merlin said grimly. “However, by forming a bond with another girl it will help her from pledging her soul to Circe. The bond you and your friends share is critical when dealing with Jack and his family. It isn’t that bond that needs to be strengthened and it is what I wish to talk with you about.”<br />
<br />
Kellie leaned back in her chair gazing at her father. “Guessing this is about the retreat,” she said, to which Merlin nodded. “Yes,” he said. “This is an important event not only for your training but for strengthening our alliance with the other timeline, specifically your daughter.”<br />
<br />
Merlin now stood, slowly pacing as he gazed at his daughter. “We have been in inventoried territory for quite sometime now Kellie,” he said. “That our timelines are so interconnected is both a blessing and a curse. Yes we have incredible amounts of allies and family that we can rely on. Yes it is possible that we can use our shared experiences to both grow and become more powerful but there is a pitfall.”<br />
<br />
“So what’s the pitfall,” Kellie said. “Because I had a feeling there was going to be a major but to this.”<br />
<br />
“You are correct daughter,” he said. “For you see as our power grows and our bond strengthens with the othe timeline inevitably it will bring stronger enemies. Enemies that shall either try to eliminate us or eliminate one of the other timelines.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” Kellie said gravely. “So there are beings out there that would actually try to eliminate one of the other timelines that’s connected to us. Wouldn’t that cause more harm than good? We’re talking about erasing an entire timeline.”<br />
<br />
“Normally yes,” Merlin stated. “However since the dimensional barriers have thinned it could be seen as strengthening the walls once more. It would however lead to the destruction of numerous lives and people. If those trying to eliminate one of the other timelines succeeded it would erase far too many people from reality.”<br />
<br />
“How many out of curiosity?”<br />
<br />
“I would imagine that if someone were to attempt to destroy or even merge the timelines than it would see many of those we call allies vanish. I would easily say we would see the destruction of half of the life in both interconnected timelines.”<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed heavily, rubbing her eyes as she now thought things through. From what Merlin was saying they had bigger problems to deal with besides Lilith, Circe, and Jack. Beings of immense power could be making moves to end not only her timeline but Katie’s as well. “So what do we need to do?”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you asked,” Merlin smiled. “You see, It appears your daughter and her friends have now brought forth into this world the next generation of wizards. Wizards that shall prove to be not only quite powerful but will be charged with protecting not only their timeline but this one as well.”<br />
<br />
“Are we talking about Morgan and Lynne,” Kellie asked curiously.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Merlin stated. “But also Tricia, Tommy, Kari, And Kumikos unborn daughter. They are the future.”<br />
<br />
“Okay so what should we do then,” Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
“Kellie your are going to cast protective charms on each of those children,” Merlin stated. “Very powerful charms that will protect those children for a lifetime. That though is not the only thing we shall do.”<br />
<br />
Kellie gave her father a curious look as he now reached under his desk, producing a small chest. As he opened the chest Kellie could see several items contained within. Kellie could immediately sense an incredible amount of magic emanating from these items. “Unfortunately Kellie,” Merlin stated. “While you and your friends may be growing in power, trying to protect those in the other timeline will be difficult. Yes, your daughter, her sister, and her friends may be able to provide necessary protection but I fear it may not be enough.”<br />
<br />
“So you want us to train more people,” Kellie said solemnly.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Merlin said quietly. “The recent attack by the rogue Kitsune has shown that although powerful, your daughters friends are still vulnerable. Katie and Gloria’s friends will be needed if the worst happens.”<br />
<br />
“You think it could be that bad,” Kellie asked.<br />
<br />
Merlin nodded as he now closed the chest. “Yes I do,” he said. “Lilith, Circe, Baba, Morgan LeFay. They are powerful true but their are deities out there that make their power seem trivial by comparison. If they were ever to make a move. Attempt what I fear. Then we will need to be ready.”<br />
<br />
“Let me guess,” Kellie said glumly. “This little bit of apocalyptic information stays between you and me.”<br />
<br />
“Do you really wish to alarm everyone that their very existence is being threatened by forces we have yet to see or even comprehend?”<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed, shaking her head as she looked at her father. The last thing wanted to do was alarm everyone that something far worse than they could possibly imagine may be targeting them. While she did not wish to hold anything back from Katie and her friends she would need to keep yet another secret. “Fine,” she grumbled. “So what do we tell everyone?”<br />
<br />
“We make it a celebration,” Merlin smirked. “Our gift to the future and an olive branch to the others in your daughters timeline. We have your friends train them in the mystic arts and enjoy a quiet weekend. The true nature of what we are doing shall never leave this home.”<br />
<br />
“Alright dad,” Kellie sighed. “I may not like keeping this secret but telling everyone things could get worse before they get better isn’t much better. I’ll call Katie, make the arrangements, and make sure she invites not only her friends but Gloria’s as well.”<br />
<br />
“Very good,” Merlin smiled. “After which I will need your assistance in preparing the spell that will bring them all to this timeline. I think it best that they be brought here so that you can perform your protective spells on the children without having to worry about losing any of your strength.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds as good as any plan,” Kellie shrugged. As she now left Merlin could only sigh sadly. Hopefully he was overreacting, however he doubted it. Merlin could feel dark powers gathering, powers that made everything he and Kellie had faced so far seem tame in comparison.</p>
