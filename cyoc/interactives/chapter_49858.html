<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kaylee found Jensen resting on the master bed that she and the twins had shared with them the night before. He was awake, but seemed to be thinking about something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I disturbing you, master?&quot; Kaylee found herself asking.<br />
<br />
Jensen looked up from whatever he had been thinking about to see the one she-wolf he consciously thought of as his mate entering the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all,&quot; Jensen gave a smile, &quot;just enjoying the work you've done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My work, master?&quot; Kaylee asked, trying to play distant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most wolves aren't the colors of the rainbow, Kaylee,&quot; Jensen pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither are they red, yet...&quot; Kaylee then gestured to herself, almost in a highly provocative manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but you are a reddish-brown, not a bright crimson,&quot; Jensen countered, &quot;and that can be explained by our connections to the story &quot;Little Red Ridding Hood&quot;. I became the Big Bad Wolf, and you became Little Red Riding Hood, but with the obvious twist of becoming a wolf as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Little Red Riding Wolf,&quot; Kaylee breathed, &quot;although, nothing about me is &quot;little&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen smiled, and did his best to keep his thoughts away from mating. There was much work that Kaylee still had to supervise, and he still wanted to run the test to see if an asker in Glendale could use the game on an askee living outside the city limits would require Jenny and Alice. Jenny to ask the question, and Alice to see if it worked, and then to obviously recover the new wolf... or whatever he came up with. And then there was also the test to see how much the game affected reality or just the person being asked with Marcy's turn, which of course only needed Marcy, but then, he wanted his leg to fully heal before he did that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed,&quot; Jensen smiled, and then turned serious, &quot;is there something you wished to tell me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is lunch time, Master,&quot; Kaylee answered, &quot;and I'm sure you're hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen got up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lead the way... Alpha Female.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Master...&quot; Kaylee blushed, practically through her fur, at the teasing tone that Jensen put at the end of the comment.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Fran came back outside to find Jenny, Marcy, and Alice walking about the garden near the back of the house. Jenny was explaining what specific flowers they were and lead all three females in periodic sniffing of each flower. Marcy looked fairly curious about gardening, although she didn't seem to have any care about where future flowers would be placed. Fran only found herself shrugging at that. When the grounds went wild, they would likely only have wild flowers. Alice meanwhile, seemed to merely be along for the ride with the other two. Bart and Kevin were not that close.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something you need?&quot; came Martha's voice from nearby.<br />
<br />
Fran then turned to find Martha standing near her. The silver furred Omega was standing at a spot where she could observe both the female pups, walking about the garden, and something moving about closer to the edge of the property.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is lunch time,&quot; Fran explained, &quot;Alpha Female Kaylee wishes the entire pack to present... where are the boys?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Masters Kevin and Bart have gone in search of rabbits,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;I think that Master Kevin did catch one... although I do not know if they actually stopped to actually eat it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can watch these three while you collect them,&quot; Fran offered, &quot;you can even tell them that they can bring the rabbit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Mistress,&quot; Martha answered and then moved off in the direction of the boys.<br />
<br />
Fran, meanwhile, turned to the three girls as they moved her way near the flower garden. Once they were close close, Fran began to speak with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you three ready for lunch?&quot; Fran asked politely.<br />
<br />
Jenny and Marcy paused for a moment and then noticed their stomachs rumbling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am rather hungry,&quot; Marcy admitted as Jenny nodded.<br />
<br />
Alice meanwhile looked rather distant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Marcy asked the glass wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not sure if I am hungry,&quot; Alice answered, &quot;For I am made of glass, and glass never eats, but in the mirrorverse I am flesh and fur...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And wears a dress,&quot; Marcy added.<br />
<br />
Alice ignored the comment for the moment and continued with her answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;...so would I be hungry there?&quot; Alice wondered, &quot;or not, since I am made of glass?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Darla or I could tear you a piece and you could take it into the &quot;mirrorverse&quot;,&quot; Fran offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Auntie Fran,&quot; Alice curtsied.<br />
<br />
That answered which twin Alice considered her mother. It saddened Fran that Kaylee and Darla had pups of their own, even if neither of them had actually been pregnant and neither of them had actually given birth, but then Julie and their daughters would hopefully one day join the pack. Part of her wondered if Julie could even become a male and that their daughters would remain theirs.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will be going in once Martha collects your brothers,&quot; Fran then said, &quot;Darla is getting sides of meat ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean dragging it to the dining room,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;it's not like we need food cooked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fran nodded, remembering dinner the night before. A large side of beef from the meat locker. Uncooked and eaten raw. Breakfast that morning had been several raw eggs and some leftover ham from the fridge. The ham wasn't entirely to Fran's liking, but she wasn't sure if that was because it had been cooked or because it was cold.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Bart lead the way, on all fours, sniffing for any other sign of a rabbit on the property. Kevin followed loyally behind him, still carrying the rabbit he had killed earlier in his mouth. He had caught a few scents, but they all lead to the rabbit holes at the base of one of the trees that formed the hedge around the edges of the estate. It depressed him somewhat, as it meant there was nothing for him and Kevin to chase at the moment, as neither of them had actually planned on catching a rabbit.<br />
<br />
It was Martha's voice that snapped them out of their &quot;hunt&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Masters Bart and Kevin,&quot; Martha spoke, &quot;It is time for lunch. Time to go inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart gave a sigh and turned to follow Martha. Kevin also sighed, dropping the rabbit as he did so.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may bring your kill with you,&quot; Martha spoke and began to head in with Bart following.<br />
<br />
Kevin quickly snatched up the carcass.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Millie fidgeted nervously as she waited in the dinning room. It was one of the first rooms that had been altered. The rug was gone, to make lapping up any spilled blood easier, as well as the table and chairs. Robyn and Maxine stood by her as they waited. She was amazed by how much things had changed at the estate, and so quickly. The day before, she had been male who commuted to the estate to work. Now, she, along with most of the staff, was she-wolf who would be living at the estate, and hopefully mating with the Master... although she found herself able to settle for one of the subordinate males, even if only one of them looked masculine at first glance.<br />
<br />
As she thought about herself and her new form, Millie smiled and wagged her tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, girl, it's just lunch,&quot; Robyn whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we'll get to see the Master,&quot; Millie countered.<br />
<br />
She received no other response then he feeling of Maxine's and Robyn's tails impact against her outer thighs. It was at that time that the twins returned. Darla easily bringing in two large slabs of meat while Fran lead four flesh and blood pups and one glass pup while Martha brought up the rear. A red furred male was carrying a dead rabbit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we eat now?&quot; Bart asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We must wait for the Master and Alpha Female,&quot; Martha told her charges, and after letting them take a place in front, moved to the rear, keeping her eyes on the pups.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we are here,&quot; came Jensen's voice as he and Kaylee entered the room, &quot;and I will say that you all make a very lovely pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, master,&quot; all of the females chorused and let Jensen and Kaylee approach the slabs of meat with Bart, Jenny, Marcy, and Kevin moving along beside them.<br />
<br />
Millie could barely keep herself from drooling at the sight of Jensen. She glanced to see that Robyn and Maxine were doing the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dig in everyone,&quot; Jensen then commanded and took a large bite out of one of the sides of beef.</p>
