<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hello everybody and welcome to a new episode of Animalia Ambassadoria.&quot; said Jessica, kicking off the latest episode of Animalia Ambassadoria.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going to do things a little differently today and do some on-site recordings, because this summer is the 2019 International Animalia Convention, and we are going to check up on some of our members who are staying at certain colonies to do coverage of the events there.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;This surprising event happened at Lord Dorian&#39;s estate here in Great Britain, which is also now having a professional archaeological team look over the Roman Ruins found on said property.&quot; said Fred Stairs. &quot;What&#39;s not really a secret is that there&#39;s a slow-moving creek on Dorian&#39;s Property which also happens to be a functional swimming hole. While one tourist was dangling her feet into the water at the swimming dock, an enormous fish grabbed her foot.&quot; Then the clip, clearly from one tourists phone camera, played. It showed one girl sitting on the swimming dock started screaming &quot;It&#39;s got me! Get it off!&quot; At that, Dorian leapt into the water and began wrestling with what could only be called a nightmarishly huge catfish. &quot;After we got it onto the shore, we decided to have it identified by a professional fisherman because some were accusing it to be a mutant, but here&#39;s what our fish expert says the fish is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This fish is, without a doubt,&quot; said the fishing expert, &quot;the Wel&#39;s Catfish. It can grow to over 5 meters in length and weigh more than 550 lbs.. It can be found all over Europe, and into the Balkans in Russia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now the fish is en route to MacDuff&#39;s Castle, where the Horizon Lab is planning to uplift the fish so he can apologize for trying to eat her.&quot; said Fred.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Julie Jenkins also had a really interesting story.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steele, who was a male peacock who inflicted hundreds of dollars of vandalism damage to a pricy car at a motor show in Venice Beach, has finally identified the one who owns him.&quot; Julie Reported &quot;To everyone&#39;s not-so-surprise, he was one of those small-scale drug dealers who hang out on street corners, take your money and gives you a small bag of drugs in return. But what made it a prime example of karma, Farmer&#39;s Insurance gave him a &#39;payment&#39; of $50,000 for using the video of his attack on the car for one of their commercial.&quot; With that, Stewie said &quot;SAY WHAAAT!?&quot; &quot;You heard me right, $50,000! His owner, on the other hand, landed in jail for drug charges.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Sarah and Malice, doing coverage at the Australian town were showing everything from the street artwork to the style of the houses. Part of what made it a little notorious was the fact that Ben and Tyree spent both the wedding ceremony and the reception dressed as tribal chieftains.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this sculpture supposed to be?&quot; asked Malice, pointing at a wooden sculpture in a tree of a small man with a bell-shaped head and oddly shaped hands and feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a type of vampire from Aboriginal Australia before the arrival of Europeans.&quot; said one of the &quot;guides&quot;, &quot;It&#39;s called a Yara-Ma-Yha-Who.&quot;<br />
<br />
After explaining what it was and how it drained blood from it&#39;s victims, Sarah said, &quot;Goes to show you how different some cultures can be before Europeans arrived.<br />
<br />
One comment asked if there was a vampire &quot;king&quot; called the &quot;Yowieyahoo&quot;, which was clearly a reference to the Scooby Doo movie: Scooby Doo and the Legend of the Vampire. While another simply read, &quot;Well I&#39;m not going to Australia this year, so Yara-Ma-Yha-Who cares?&quot; That comment generated a lot of hilarious comments, partly because of the pun and partly because of the running gag on how so many dangerous creatures lived in Australia that nothing good would ever come out of it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Heiya Island was known for being the main place where the IAC Martial Arts Tournament. Rebecca was doing interviews with some of the participants and the masters. But one was also an advertisement for Gillette. <br />
<br />
In it, Rebecca was interviewing Mr. Shikamatsu when one of the participants in the Zen Archery fired his arrow and went way off. It seemed that the arrow was going to strike Rebecca in the head when Mr. Shikamatsu caught it with a barehanded catch. Later, the ad would be called &quot;Brilliantly faked&quot; and debunked by a professional special effects artist, who pointed out the lack of motion-blur.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;From Dino City, this is Sophie and Roland, and JC and Arcelia with some new updates.&quot; said Sophie, before helping Hazel with her flight lessons.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no secret that the Velociraptors from the Jurassic Park series were inspired by the Deinonychus, but neither of them were as large as their movie counterparts. So imagine Spielberg&#39;s excitement when a large enough species in the same family was discovered in 1975.&quot; said Roland. &quot;In fact, the Utahraptor was almost named after him. Some would say that the Velociraptors from Jurassic Park were actually Utahraptors, but the main thing was that in this day and age, after the discovery of Microraptor, they would have had feathers.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s also a group of girls who had just finished high school and are going to be part of the Dinotopian branch of Pi Eta Tau.&quot; said JC. &quot;While I didn&#39;t get their names, I do know that they managed to get the money required for all their conversion, minus the &#39;discount&#39; for choosing a species they didn&#39;t have data for, by one of the infamous bikini car washes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But just so you know,&quot; said Arcelia quickly, &quot;The one they did wasn&#39;t as risqué as some people make such things out to be. Also, sorry boys, I don&#39;t have any video recorded of it because, if you&#39;re a microraptor like me and JC, why drive a car when you can fly.&quot; At that, there was a lot of mixed reactions, ranging from relief to disappointment.<br />
<br />
There was also an interview with the now famous, or infamous, &quot;Mr. M.&quot;.  While he was now the largest theropod Dinotopian, he was also known for both staring, as the main character, and directing a new Dinotopian-themed, R-Rated movie entitled <I>King of the Jungle</I>, which was already reaching hundreds of thousands in preorders.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
There was also a decision to move a lot of IAC Track and Field events moving inside due to temperatures regularly hitting triple digit numbers.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll be doing coverage of the sporting events in the next episode.&quot; said Jessica, &quot;And since next week is Fourth of July week, please be safe out there. And if you&#39;re as dumb as this guy, keep plenty of fire extinguishers and first aid kits ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
After that, they showed one of the infamous clips of guys who thing that it&#39;s a good idea to use their pants as a place to put one of those rockets-on-a-stick (not bottle rockets, but I can&#39;t remember what they&#39;re called) and getting a toasted tush as &quot;payment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun and be safe.&quot; said Roger, &quot;And We&#39;ll see you next time in the wilds of Animalia.&quot;</p>
