<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time they’d arrived back at the house Jenny was completely covered in her own juices, and was desperately trying to wipe it off.<br />
Martha turned off the engine and got out of the truck, walking round the back just as Jenny opened the tailgate and the gargantuan amount of pussy juice poured out all over the driveway. Martha giggled, “Have fun did we?” Jenny was beyond mortified; here she was covered in pussy juice sitting on the back of a truck while her maid teased her. But she thought it better to avoid responding, she knew she was going to be in trouble with her parents for turning up at school... dressed.<br />
<br />
Jenny jumped down from the truck, grabbed her bag from inside the car and walked into the house, Martha followed her smiling.<br />
<br />
When they got inside Martha shouted, “We’re home!” before walking into the kitchen. Jenny’s little sister, Emily emerged at the top of the stairs. Emily was in her last year of Junior high and the two sisters had never gotten on very well. Jenny removed her heels and placed them next to the door, she was now completely naked and the feeling of her pointed bare feet on the floor was a strange sensation. She looked down at herself, the pussy juice that had covered her body was clinging to her like oil and it gave her skin a glistening sheen.<br />
<br />
“Hey Slut, how’s it going?” came Emily’s voice down the stairs. Jenny blinked; her sister had never spoken to her like that before, normally she would have retaliated but today she didn’t feel as though she had the energy. She ignored the younger child and walked into the kitchen where Martha was gathering ingredients ready for dinner, avoiding looking at the dining table...<br />
<br />
“Emily just called me ‘slut’ ” she said sitting down on one of the bar stools lining the worktop.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, she’s always called you that, otherwise you cum everywhere.” Marta’s voice came from inside the refrigerator. <br />
<br />
Jenny was mortified; her own sister was allowed to call her a slut, what made it worse was that she had a good reason too.<br />
<br />
“Martha! Slut just ignored me!” Emily’s whining voice echoed from upstairs. Martha stood up, and looked over her shoulder at Jenny.<br />
<br />
“Be polite to your sister, please. It makes my job so much easier if you guys just make an effort to get along.”<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded solemnly; “Sorry Emily, I’ve had a difficult day!” she called back. Martha turned to face her, <br />
<br />
“Apparently a teacher found you at school today walking around in the halls completely dressed. You’re parents want to talk to you about that. Care to explain before they come home?” Jenny shook her head, she was dreading explaining it to her mum and dad. “Well ok, it’s none of my business anyway.” The maid said turning back to preparing dinner, “Oh and I’ve put all of your stuff back in your room now that the decorators are finished, you can move back in there tonight. I know how much you hated sleeping in that other room.”<br />
<br />
Jenny looked up, what was she talking about? She dreaded to find out but decided to take a look. Walking back out of the kitchen and into the hall she picked up her shoes and climbed the stairs, trying desperately to ignore the wetness that covered her whole body. When she reached the top she went to what had always been her room, but she now found it full of all of the things that the family usually kept in the spare room. The bed was still the one she’d woken up in this morning but it was bare. There were several large bin-liners all stuffed full with something piled up in the corner of the room. Jenny looked around, all of her stuff had been moved and she knew where.<br />
<br />
She headed to the next door along, what she knew as the spare room, it was about half the size of her room and she wondered how all of her stuff had fitted in here.<br />
<br />
Opening the door she soon found out that it hadn’t. There were no cupboards or closets, except for a desk and dressing table that was covered in her make-up. The floor was laminated and sloped slightly into the middle, where there was a drain. Jenny figured this was for the pussy juice. <br />
<br />
The window was much larger than she’d remembered; it now seemed to engulf nearly the entire wall, with no curtains and the fact that it faced the road; anybody on the street opposite would be able to see her.<br />
<br />
She looked at the bed, the mattress was covered in a plastic layer and so were the sheets and pillows. Around the room were large pornographic posters, images of beautiful woman lounging in erotic poses. On the shelves were pictures of her that she had collected from various times in her life, in all of them she was naked and in one she looked like she was having a massive orgasm. Jenny stared at them in disbelief, and then at the cabinet on the opposite wall to the bed. It was full of dildos and shoes, all neatly arranged and displayed through the glass doors.<br />
<br />
She walked over to it and found a space available for the pair she was holding, putting them away she turned and sat on the dressing table’s stool. She wasn’t surprised when she felt the plastic sheath of another dildo slide up inside her. Pivoting around on it she turned to face the dressing table and started opening drawers.<br />
<br />
In the top ones she found about 3 pairs of both arm and leg warmers.  In the next drawer down she found a pair of high heeled slippers and what looked like a pair thick transparent rubber socks. Jenny picked them up and examined them closely, realising they were to be worn instead of shoes. The next drawer contained a single pair of stockings and the drawer below contained a single t-shirt with two large holes cut where her breasts would go. Jenny realised that this was all of the clothing she now owned; she presumed that Martha had put the rest in the bin-liners next door. She looked around her room again, noticing the robe hanging on the back of the door.<br />
<br />
She carefully lifted herself off the dildo and reached up to grab the bathrobe. Once she’d grabbed it she realised that it wasn’t quiet as covering as a normal bathrobe, it was only the length of a small t-shirt and wouldn’t cover her lower half at-all. It also wasn’t wide enough to cover her front and would therefore simply hang from her shoulders and cover just her arms and back.<br />
<br />
Jenny let out a cry of despair, the curse had changed everything and there was no way to change it back, she felt completely alone.</p>
