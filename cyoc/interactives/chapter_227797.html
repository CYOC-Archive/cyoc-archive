<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake&#39;s eyes opened, but his body didn&#39;t respond to any attempts to move. His brain was in a fog, there was a growing awareness of not just his eyes were open, but he could feel. He felt Kelly&#39;s legs wrapped around his. He felt a weight on his chest and his belly felt uncomfortable and full. Jake was just there, he could feel his fingers, but they did not move. His lips tingled, like they were numb, and the same for his tongue. Jake could feel the dried tears on his face, but the memory of the long orgasm and before was blurred. Jake remained motionless on the floor for hours as Kelly slept. Jake kept working on his fingers and arms. Daylight was gone for a while when Jake first moved his arm along with both hands. That movement woke Kelly.<br />
<br />
Kelly sat up next to the day bed in her office and examined Jake. The leggings were coated in a still moist mucus. Kelly saw Jake reach down to the waistband of the leggings and slide the waistband down. Kelly helped slide the leggings down, and eventually free of Jake&#39;s eight tentacle legs, with little suckers just like hers. Kelly put the leggings on the bed and then rolled Jake on to his back. Jake felt his newly enlarged breasts move slightly along with his expanded belly bulge, with all new sensations and touches that made no sense to him. Jake tried to put his arms down to push himself up, unsuccessfully. Kelly saw this and helped Jack to sit up on his tentacles, as Jake no longer had a human looking butt. Jake moaned in fear from the new sensations as the size of his belly bulge along with his large breasts that he had yet to see began to sink in. Jake brought his hands and arms up to where he could see them. His once muscular arms and hands were not smaller, but had lost a lot of muscle mass during his transformation. Jake felt his cock throbbing, but the throbbing was no longer between his legs. Jake was looking around when felt Kelly&#39;s hand pick up the end of one of his legs, and a flared cock tip was starting to emerge.<br />
<br />
Kelly smiled and whispered in Jake&#39;s ear, &quot;Your a lot bigger now dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
The words made Jake smile, and more of his new cock emerged from the end of the tentacle. Kelly took the tip to her lips, and licked the flared tip. The taste and smell was different, as his cock tip was oozing out more of the mucus lubricant. Kelly could not grip it tight enough to get it into her mouth. Kelly decided to massage his shaft and tip with her mouth over the opening. Jake didn&#39;t last long as his first orgasm hit and Kelly&#39;s mouth was filled with his release. Kelly didn&#39;t let any of Jake&#39;s seed go to waste, and swallowed it all. Kelly had given Jake a blow job in the past, but he tasted different this time. Jake&#39;s seed had that familiar metallic salty taste, but there was a strong new taste, like oysters, and Kelly loved it. Jake reached down to his new vaginal cavity, and explored with is finger until he found his new clitoris. Kelly watched as Jake&#39;s fingers started to work his sensitive nub. Jake gasped softly as he felt a growing warmth throb from the nub. Jake wanted more of this feeling, but his large belly was keeping him from pushing deeper or harder. Jake became frustrated and stopped, letting his throbbing clit to fade on its own. Jake could feel something was inside him when his belly moved as he sat up. Jake was curling the ends of his tentacle legs, trying to control each one one at a time. Kelly realized that Jake&#39;s belly was bigger. Even with the leggings off, Jake&#39;s belly bulge was continuing to stretch him. Jake&#39;s belly button was stretched smooth. Jake felt a pressure inside him build, but it was painful to push. Jake looked down and watched as his skin continued to stretch, he could feel everything was so tight, yet he continued to grow. Jake did everything to avoid moving. He wanted to push, as there was something there needing a nudge, but the pain from pushing told him to stay as relaxed as possible. Kelly didn&#39;t know what to do, and just held Jake as he leaned against her as they sat on the floor. Jake tried to talk, but his tongue and lips were still numb and not cooperating.<br />
<br />
Kelly whispered, &quot;I&#39;m sorry for this baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
The pressure was constant in Jake&#39;s belly. Jake&#39;s eyes closed once he was accustomed to the pressure. Kelly felt Jake&#39;s body relax in her arms. She kissed the top of his head as Jake laid on her chest. Kelly leaned Jake onto the edge of her office day bed before crawling away to the bathroom. She did not know what to do for Jake, but she needed to figure out how to move around better than she was. Kelly spent a long time in the bathroom, holding onto the edge of the door as she tried to bend and flex her legs to stand upright. Her new legs were so rubbery, she could not lock them into position. She could bend and flex, but keeping her tentacles rigid was so far beyond her ability. She could push herself up and lower herself down on her legs, but could not stay standing. She finally gave up after many attempts and making her legs sore. She sat on the bathroom rug, covered in her leg mucus. Slowly she crawled back to Jake, using her legs to push against the floor. Kelly&#39;s own vagina was a mucus factory, as she enjoyed dragging her clit across the carpet. She reached out and found the tentacle with Jake&#39;s cock inside, and teased the tip for a bit until his cock began to emerge. Kelly tried to be careful and do most of the work so she would not wake Jake. Kelly thought she was doing a good job of it, until Jake&#39;s eyes opened, and he felt himself deep inside his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s so big dear. It feels so good,&quot; Kelly said in a low, sultry tone.<br />
<br />
Jake tried to smile, and tried to push his cock in deeper. Jake was careful to keep the rest of his body still, but he was not yet a master of which leg was which, so about half of his legs squirmed and pushed, but the one that counted felt great. Kelly&#39;s orgasm built faster than Jake&#39;s, and soon her slick vagina was squeezing Jake&#39;s cock as much as she could, as Jake worked his cock faster as he was almost there. Kelly was trying to grab Jake&#39;s cock, when Jake released his load as he bottomed out against Kelly&#39;s cervix. Jake&#39;s orgasm served as the right opportunity for his first egg to finally stretch his own cervix and enter his birth canal. Jake&#39;s pushing of his cock leg into Kelly turned into him pushing egg after egg out onto the floor.<br />
<br />
Kelly was breathing in rhythm with each wave of her orgasm, slow to fade as she felt Jake&#39;s still hard cock deep inside her, feeling his seed fill her. Kelly saw egg after egg slide from Jake&#39;s vagina. She lost count at 28, as eggs were coming out that were blocked from her view. Jake felt the pressure in his belly remain constant, but the sharp pain from pushing was long gone. The eggs themselves were quite large, about 10 cm long and 5 cm in diameter. Jake&#39;s once stretched belly skin returned to normal, showing no sign of being stretched to a near transparent thin bubble. Jake moved both his hands up and down his belly, making sure nothing was amiss. Jake was feeling up his now large breasts, and stroking his sensitive puffy nipples. Kelly was continuing to enjoy a still fully hard cock Jake was still holding deep inside her.<br />
<br />
Kelly was doing her best to squeeze Jake&#39;s cock, and smiled, &quot;You never stayed so hard this long. It&#39;s incredible.&quot; Kelly leaned back onto the floor, and dozed off from the dopamine overdose still flooding her brain.<br />
<br />
Jake began to work his legs more, and as he pulled his large cock from Kelly&#39;s vagina, he felt it withdraw back into his leg. Jake was hungry and needed a bathroom first. He followed Kelly&#39;s mucus trail to the bathroom and was more successful than Kelly, pulling himself onto the toilet. Jake pushed hard as a plug in his ass and colon slowly broke loose and moved out of Jake. Jake flushed multiple times to get rid of the mucus mixed mess. Jake tried for the shower next, cleaning himself for the first time. His legs felt stiff and burning if they were dry. After the shower, it took a few minutes for his legs to get covered in a thin sheen of mucus. Jake&#39;s attempts to stand went better than Kelly&#39;s, with eight legs working better than 2. Jake had the same issue with not being able to lock his legs, but he could have three pushing up when he lowered himself on three more, and the other two kept him steady. In the mirror, Jake saw himself slowly moving up and down as he worked to keep himself upright on his own legs. Jake took a long stare at his soft, feminine face and hair that extended past his shoulder. Jake considered himself a breast man, and now he had sprouted his own generous sized pair. Jake notice he no longer had buttocks as such, but had eight legs arranged in a circle from the bottom of his waist and inside the circle were two holes. Jake opened his mouth, trying to move his lips. Jake went to extend his tongue, but what came out from his mouth was a tendril nearly two feet long. He took a moment to pull it back inside. He tried to say &quot;ah&quot; and &quot;ha&quot; and &quot;era&quot;, coming out &quot;ah&quot;, &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;eya&quot;. Jake was also feeling the need to be filled grow, as his pussy was oozing a steady flow of mucus now. A moment ago, he was just fine, staring at the mirror, standing on wobbly legs. Jake felt the need surge into a burning fire from between his legs, and he lowered himself on the floor, and filled his aching pussy with his cock. Jake&#39;s body was on automatic, as he pumped himself furiously, feeling his dueling orgasms build, and his male orgasm won the contest, as he stopped thrusting as he held his pumping cock hard against his cervix, feeling his belly being pumped with is own seed. The fire between his legs became a satisfied throbbing and squeezing as he could think normally again. Jake pulled his cock out once he was empty, and started to get back into what he now considered a standing position. Jake took his time, and worked out a way to raise and lower to a set of legs in such a way as to move about. He &quot;walked&quot; back to Kelly, who was still sleeping. He saw the leggings on the daybed and picked them up. They still had eight legs instead of the two when he first put them on. Jake pulled himself up onto to the daybed, and proceeded to put the eight tentacles into the eight leg holes of the leggings. After some effort and learning some coordination, Jake pulled the leggings up to his waist. Jake then slid off the bed and onto his legs. Something was different, as he was able to stand easier, but he was still bouncing but now he was walking, rather crawling, like a spider on his eight tentacle legs. Jake went to the kitchen and raided the refrigerator.</p>
