<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anija was in Vaestro&#39;s room, laying in his comfortable bed, from time to time, Anija would remember her days as a hatchling, she remembered how the Cultists kidnapped her, killing her parents and their riders aswell, she was scared thinking of what those monsters were about to do to her, then Vaestro arrived when serving in the military, by just laying her small eyes on him at that time, made a deep bond forge between the two.<br />
<br />
During that time, Vaestro took great care of her, almost to extreme levels, he would make himself sure to feed Anija only the healthiest food for Eastern dragons, he would make himself sure that Anija wasn&#39;t sick or injured, he would make himself sure that Anija was in a safe place. All of these actions only strengthened the bond between her and her Rider, although some of the safety procedures were quite strict for Anija, she knew that Vaestro did them because he loved her.<br />
<br />
The same question circled around Anija&#39;s head, &quot;Would Vaestro prefer me as an Anthro or a Feral?&quot; thought Anija, this question made her feel like she was obsessed with him, a part of her wanted to know what it felt like standing on two feet again, meanwhile the other part wanted to keep her form, if she mated with Vaestro in a bipedal form, then she would be stuck in that form until she gives birth, however, her ability to heal, cast blessings and grant health involving wishes will still remain, her physical strength would just be weaker.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Vaestro was wandering in the streets of the kingdom, he wasn&#39;t wondering the kingdom alone, he was with Karyu, Avelia and Vrackie, but they splited up to find more about it, Vaestro while taking notes on important places in the kingdom, was also thinking about Anija, the idea to mate with her made a shiver run down his spine, he saw his dragoness like a daughter, he raised her as one, mating with her would make him feel like he was doing incest, which Vaestro despised since most of his family did.<br />
<br />
The poor dragoness was still in deep thoughts wondering if her Rider prefered her as a feral dragon or as an anthropomorphic one, then she realized something, her Rider took care of her when she was a hatchling, her Rider spent time with her when she needed someone, her Rider loves her, no matter what form she has, Anija took a deep breath as she slowly got up, Anija quietly chanted the spell, when she finished chanting it, her body seemed to glow for a little, until it suddenly stopped glowing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaargh!!!&quot; Groaned Anija as a terrible wave of pain struck her back, making her fall on the ground painfully, it felt as if a sledgehammer was constantly hitting her back, her spine was shifting, becoming smaller, her organs also shifted into a much more suitable size, but they were healthy without any side effect, Anija&#39;s spine finished shifting, making her resemble the size of an average woman.<br />
<br />
The next thing to change were her hindlegs, which became longer, the bones and muscles shifted as well, eventually Anija&#39;s hindlegs stopped shifting, she slowly got up standing on two feet instead of four, while her hindlegs changed, so did her forelegs, her digits cracked as two more grew, apart from the white scales and her golden claw like nails, her arms fully resembled the ones of a human.<br />
<br />
In an awkward delight, Anija&#39;s breasts also grew a little, giving her a much more attracive look. Eventually the changes were over, Anija slowly went towards Vaestro&#39;s mirror, the reflection showed a beautiful anthro angelic dragoness, with a shape that would make any drake and human male melt, the only things that weren&#39;t changed were her face and her hindleg paws.<br />
<br />
Anija went towards Luka&#39;s room, tripping from time to time since she wasn&#39;t used walking on two feet, Luka was laying on her bed reading a book, she heard footsteps as she saw Anija awkwardly entering her room, this made Luka gasp as she went towards her, &quot;You look so pretty!&quot; said Luka as she looked at Anija&#39;s slender form, &quot;Uhm... T-Thank you?&quot; said Anija awkwardly, blushing a little as she looked at her breasts, Luka went towards her drawer as she grabbed her spare teddy, &quot;Here, try it on.&quot; said Luka as she gave it to Anija, who quickly tried it, after the transformation, her scales became sensitive, it was one of the side effects when dragons switch forms consecutively, this made Anija shudder as the soft fabric of the lingerie brushed her scales, she looked at herself in the mirror, although the black colors of the lingerie didn&#39;t fit with the coloration of her scales, it made her look even more attractive, Luka smilled at this, as she put on her evening outfit, &quot;Me, Avelia, Karyu and Vrackie will go for a walk around the kingdom, so you and Vaestro can have some privacy during your romantic session.&quot; said Luka with a wink, Anija quickly hugged Luka, &quot;Thank you Luka! You&#39;re the best!&quot; said Anija, &quot;Now go back to Vaestro&#39;s room, he could come back any second now.&quot; said Luka as she went towards the living room, waiting for the rest of the crew, meanwhile Anija went back to Vaestro&#39;s room, waiting for him to arrive.<br />
<br />
Eventually Vaestro and the rest of the crew arrived, being greeted by Luka with her adorable evening outfit, &quot;What did you all find out?&quot; asked Luka, &quot;The streets are quite silent and empty during the night, the guards are absent most of the time.&quot; said Vaestro, &quot;The most secured area is only the castle, and the jail is, ironically, less secured.&quot; said Avelia, &quot;If the plans screw up then we can go through a forest, it&#39;s not secured at all so the getaway could be pretty easy.&quot; said Karyu, &quot;We didn&#39;t have enough time to look through the entire kingdom, so we will return again exploring the streets.&quot; said Vrackie, &quot;Good, i&#39;ll tag along.&quot; said Luka, this made Vaestro cross his arms, &quot;Oh so i&#39;ll be the one to stay here.&quot; said Vaestro, &quot;Atleast your dragon will be with you.&quot; said Karyu, by hearing this Vaestro gave a suprised look, &quot;Speaking of Anija, how&#39;s she doing?&quot; asked Vaestro while looking at Luka, &quot;Oh she&#39;s alright, she&#39;s sleeping in your room, on your bed.&quot; lied Luka.<br />
<br />
Vaestro nodded as he headed towards his room, a smile formed on Luka&#39;s lips as she and the rest of the crew explored the rest of the kingdom. Meanwhile Anija, stood on Vaestro&#39;s bed, waiting impatiently for her rider, eventually she heared the door open as Vaestro entered his room, his eyes quickly locked on Anija&#39;s, the two of them looked at each other in an awkward eye contact, &quot;Is that Luka&#39;s lingerie?&quot; asked Vaestro suddenly, breaking the eye contact, he was quickly replied with a nod by Anija, by seeing this, Vaestro facepalmed himself, &quot;God damn it Luka...&quot; said Vaestro, he sighed as he sat near Anija, he looked at her beautiful body, &quot;You did this all for me, didn&#39;t you?&quot; asked Vaestro, with a smile, &quot;Y-Yes i did.&quot; replied Anija, biting her lips, &quot;You don&#39;t like it, do you?&quot; asked Anija with a sad voice, this made Vaestro silently chuckle as he locked his lips with Anija&#39;s in a warm and tender kiss.<br />
<br />
Vaestro quickly broke the kiss, &quot;Do you want to do it now or do you want me to wait to adjust yourself in your new form?&quot; asked Vaestro, as he looked at Anija.</p>
