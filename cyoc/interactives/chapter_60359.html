<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peace and quiet. It was a rare commodity for Equus. He had it now.<br />
<br />
Fries and Mul had moved on to their next target some time ago. Equus didn’t know how long. In truth, he didn’t care. He was in a barn full of tainted horses screwing a willing philly, that was all that mattered at the moment. This philly was so willing she seemed determined to milk every drop of cum from Equus and his huge equine balls. While Equus bred regularly, it had been a while since someone had tried to milk him like this. He loved it.<br />
<br />
“I may just take you home with me”, Equus said to the philly who neighed in response. <br />
<br />
The philly’s eyes flashed red in the darkened barn from all the taint she had already milked as she thrust back into the demon stallion. She liked this funny two legged stallion. He smelled different from the other beasts in the barn, his scent was more virile than any of them, and she had so wanted to be mated, it was her first real heat. Now more than two feet of him was inside her, filling her with his tainted cum. It felt so good. She slammed back into him trying to engulf even more of him. His leathery balls slapped her cunt. She stomped a hoof in satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Equus laughed and fucked her even harder. He let rip a neigh of triumph as he came once again inside her. His balls jumped and churned as they unleashed their flood, then instantly started filling once more with supernatural speed. In a few minutes he would be ready to cum again. <br />
<br />
Equus had lost count of how many times he had cum. The truth was he didn’t care. Thanks to his power his balls refilled with incredible speed. He was always ready for sex. He had what was in effect an infinite supply of cum, and the supernatural endurance to match. The fact is he had cum so much that it was spilling out of the black philly, running down his legs and pooling on the ground beneath them.<br />
<br />
The philly felt herself changing, growing. It was as if her animal mind was expanding. She felt another presence. It was close. The funny stallion. She felt his alien mind near to her evolving intelligence. She sent pure thought to him. <br />
<br />
“Frida love funny stallion. Frida mate.” Equus was so stunned he nearly lost his balance. He sent calming thoughts to the philly, all the while asking himself what he had unintentionally done. She was more than a mere beast at this point, and apparently getting stronger with each blast of tainted cum. That was when he noticed their audience.<br />
<br />
Standing outside the stall were two adolescent looking bovine lust demons watching him and the philly mate and stroking themselves with stupid grins on their human faces. They were 8 feet tall and fully formed, but looked gangly. Their cocks had grown to a respectable foot and a half, which was as large as they would ever get. So far their muscles had not filled in. They would probably need to drink from the special cow a few more times to finish their development and gain the necessary mass. Right now they each weighed about three hundred pounds and looked like famine victims. Eight or nine hundred pounds would be their healthy fully developed weight. Equus himself was a heavily muscled six hundred pounds.<br />
<br />
Equus sent thoughts of praise and affection to the philly. He asked her to release his cock so he could deal with the creatures watching. She reluctantly agreed and released his trapped cock. He pulled out with a sploosh of fluids, causing the watching bulls to shoot their own loads and stomp their hooves. All Equus could do was laugh.<br />
<br />
“Awsome boss horse”, Bart said. Billy nodded and snorted in agreement. <br />
<br />
“Guys, call me Equus. I’m dropping the binding spell now as promised, we have a lot of serious things to talk about before the sun comes up.” <br />
 <br />
To the bull’s credit, they got right down to business as requested. It turned out Bart had tentative plans to dispose of his parents involving the use of a rented wood chipper. These plans actually pre-dated his tainting, another mark in the favor of Stripes it seemed. After some serious discussion it was decided that it would be smarter for Bart’s parents to “decide” to retire and turn the dairy and their home over to Bart, while Bart’s parents took that well deserved trip around the world. They had a few million in the bank. Equus went with Bart to his home and cast the necessary suggestion spells as Bart’s parent’s slept. <br />
<br />
They returned to the stable and dairy. Fortunately it was still before midnight, but only just.<br />
<br />
“Guys, I have some bad news and some good news.” Equus looked at the two bulls. He decided that they could take what he had in mind. “I have some things I have to teach you immediately, and I have no time to do it. That’s the bad news. The good news is I have no choice but to have a three way with you to impart the knowledge.” As Equus expected the bulls snorted and grinned.<br />
<br />
“You can actually teach us through sex?”, Bart asked. He had happy amazement in his voice.<br />
<br />
“We are lust demons. We live for sex. It’s what we are. We can do a merging of minds to facilitate almost instant knowledge transfer, but we have to screw to do it. All three of us must screw and be screwed forming a circle. Three is the minimum to make it work. You should feel privileged,  I don’t let just anyone under my tail.”<br />
<br />
After some coaching they stroked themselves to hardness and got in the proper positions. Equus quickly discovered it was easier with equines. The extra length while not mandatory made things easier. The two bulls had to struggle to get in position, but finally they managed it. After much thrusting, neighing and grunting they came and achieved the merge.<br />
<br />
Equus shielded most of his mind and knowledge from the bulls, who didn’t have the knowledge to even try and circumvent his blocks. He gave them the basics, powers of illusion and suggestion, along with instructions on how to taint humans and animals properly. He also told them to keep feeding from the cow daily until they achieved proper weight.<br />
<br />
As a bonus Equus implanted his own hidden suggestions to ensure that they would not do anything too crazy without consulting him. They had been 19 before all this started, and physically they were again. They had been immature to start with, and becoming imps had only made that worse. The imp experience had also created a twin brother relationship that was magical and demonic in nature. There would always be a streak of mischief in them that would never go away.<br />
<br />
They pulled out of each other and lay panting on the stable floor a while. After basking in the afterglow the bulls ran off to the dairy to corrupt some cows and plan for the arrival of the staff in the morning. The dairy would close for a week to facilitate the transfer. A forged memo in the staff mailboxes would plant that cover among the staff, and prevent tainted milk from reaching humans before it was decided to pursue mass corruption.<br />
<br />
Equus returned to the philly and stroked her muzzle affectionately, she in turn licked his half muzzle. “Girl, you and I will fuck some more, I promise you.”<br />
<br />
About the time Equus contemplated his return to the ranch with the philly, his cell rang.<br />
<br />
“Master, it’s Kyle. I have news. Your plan is now ahead of schedule, most of my friends are safe, and Ponius will not bother us for a while.”<br />
<br />
Equus was stunned. Kyle was not one given to imagination or flights of fancy. He had been quite a good student thus far. “Can I speak to Donk?”<br />
<br />
“He just got here. We are briefing him. Frankly it would be better if you opened a portal and let us come to you. There is a situation that only I can fix, and I need to be in Glendale to do it.” Kyle seemed quite adamant. <br />
<br />
After conferring with Donk, Equus realized that Kyle had appeared to have pulled a major coup, and that a face to face was probably a good idea. Before Equus opened the portal, Donk warned him to expect lots of unusual company.</p>
