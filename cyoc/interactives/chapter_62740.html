<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Erick's entire new wardrobe - You want to try him on, son?&quot; Uncle John said with a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, can I use your bathroom to change, Uncle?&quot; Erick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, but why don't you use Luke's room, there's more room in there to move around, and he has a full-length <br />
mirror if you need to make any adjustments,&quot; Luke's dad said happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad?&quot; Lukw whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Luke, let's put you on,&quot; Erick said grabbing Luke's cock and leading him to his own room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I get it,&quot; Luke said, &quot;You're all putting me on!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, just Erick is putting you on. You belong to him, and from now on you'll be anything he wants to wear, so <br />
he'll be wearing you practically 24/7, and I won't have to buy him any more clothes,&quot; Uncle John said merrily, <br />
&quot;Isn't that great, bro?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure is, John. Oh, and I guess since Erick will be wearing Luke, Marge and I won't have to buy his clothing <br />
any more. Let's see last year we spent nearly $2000 on clothing for him including his sports gear and team <br />
uniform. That's enough for that Hawaiian vacation we've been putting off, Marge!&quot; he said pleased at the <br />
thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hawaii would be nice...&quot; Marge said in a distracted voice.  Something was bothering her.  She had barely <br />
talked all night.  She couldn't figure it out herself, but everything seemed to feel wrong.  She was sure that <br />
John wasn't even her husband's brother - no he was, but somehow he wasn't.  It wasn't like he was a pod person <br />
or anything like that, but when she concentrated hard on remembering him from the past the memories didn't <br />
seem right, they were like a badly spliced movie. Normally, Marge's memory was crystal clear.  She even <br />
remembered details from when she was barely five, but she all her memories of John were blurry like he had <br />
been edited into them and didn't belong. She glanced at her son's retreating bare ass. He should be wearing <br />
something, not being worn.  Still being Erick's clothing for a while would probably do him some good. Luke <br />
could be so thoughtless sometimes, and helping Erick out this way should make him more thoughtful and caring <br />
in the future.  John had said something about male bonding, at least she thought he had, but she couldn't <br />
actually recall him saying it. She rubbed her temples, and muttered, &quot;I think I need an aspirin.&quot;<br />
<br />
John frowned as Marge disappeared into the kitchen. His spell was perfect, but somehow she was fighting it. <br />
How?<br />
<br />
&quot;So, bro, I think Erick mentioned something about Luke's mother's side of the family going back to Old Salem <br />
back at the witch trials?&quot; he asked. Maybe she was a distant cousin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no it wasn't Salem, Massachusetts.  I understand the confusion. Her family were witch hunters in Salem, <br />
Germany near Baden. It was back in the middle ages.  I think one of her and Luke's ancestors wrote the <br />
&quot;Malleus Malediction&quot; of something?&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;?  The &quot;Witch's Hammer&quot;?  The handbook used by the Roman Inquisition?&quot; John said <br />
with a gasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Maleficarum!  That's it &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;, so Maleficarum means Hammer in German?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The title is Latin.  Malleus means hammer, and well Maleficarum, well it does exactly mean witches, but evil-<br />
doers maybe, but it meant Witches, and in German it was called Hexenhammer,&quot; John said as he remembered the <br />
fires, and the tribunals. He shivered. Then he smiled.  That was all in the past, and this was a fitting <br />
revenge for the descendant of one of those inquisitors.<br />
<br />
In the former Salem Abbey, a church bell rang of its own accord. A shadow moved in the wrong direction toward <br />
the light. It was otherworldly, and it moved with purpose.  It hadn't written the Malleus Maleficarum, but it <br />
had in life been the source of much of the material in the book. It had a definite purpose, and it had miles <br />
to go before it rested.  It sensed the Enemy.  The Enemy had escaped it once in life.  It had fled to Holland, <br />
and then on to England. It was too far to pursue then, it seemed to be farther now, but without frail flesh, <br />
the witch hunter could move tirelessly and the sea was no longer an impediment.  Johannus would finally face <br />
his trial for all the human lives he had destroyed. The shade would not be stopped by any creature of the <br />
night this time, its mission would be a success. Divine justice would be done.<br />
<br />
The lights at the train station flickered, and several people drew their coats tight as an unseen chill seemed <br />
to sweep past them. Iron Horses seemed to be neither iron or horse, but they would prove an adequate <br />
conveyance and faster than the shade could move on its own.  It wasn't exactly sure how it knew about trains, <br />
planes and automobiles, but it did.  It seemed to know what it needed.  Perhaps the mental ability to detect <br />
supernatural creatures had been augmented in death, and the thoughts of humans came to the shade in answer to <br />
its own thoughts.  It had waited long in purgatory, it had waited to finish its job.  It had waited for <br />
Johannus.<br />
<br />
In Luke's bedroom, Erick stood looking at Luke, and then said, &quot;I guess I won't be needing these anymore.&quot;  He <br />
snapped his fingers, and his clothing vanished into dust. He was stark naked. At his feet lay his wallet, <br />
keys, a pen, and some two dozen folded magazine clippings. He reached down and picked them up.<br />
<br />
Luke recognized the clippings as items of men's clothing from catalogs.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can I become your entire wardrobe?  I'm only one person!&quot; Luke protested in fear.  He couldn't resist. <br />
Somehow he knew that Uncle John and Cousin Erick could do this. He had no idea how, and he prayed they <br />
couldn't. His voice cracked. He was on the verge of tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now don't go to pieces, Luke,&quot; Erick said, and then he paused, &quot;Well, actually, you will go to pieces, but it <br />
won't hurt, and father says you'll probably like it. Because well, I hope you will. I think I'll need let's <br />
see 7 pieces - no wait 8 with the jacket, 10 with the gloves, and the hat- that makes 11. Now logically, your <br />
head should be the hat, but I have another idea - oh wait, glad I didn't separate you yet. I forgot, I'll need <br />
a scarf too.  After all it's Christmas, so 12 pieces of present you'll be like the 12 days of Christmas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke trembled as Erick touched his shoulder.  He felt his joints pop, and his body parts separating.  He fell <br />
backwards on to his bed. His head rolled off his neck, across the bed, and on to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops!&quot; Erick said dashing around to pick up Luke's head, &quot;Next time, I'll have you lie down first. Though <br />
eventually, father says I'll be able to convert you into separate articles of clothing without separating your <br />
body parts first.&quot;<br />
<br />
He placed the photo of some spandex underwear on Luke's forehead. Luke's mouth formed an &quot;O&quot; as if to say <br />
&quot;no&quot;, but it remained when the head became fabric.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, this pair has a built-in c-ring to make my junk stand out and away from my body. I just slide you up <br />
me, and slide my cock and balls through the ring into your pouch. It's like my manhood's in your mouth now. <br />
Hope you can taste it. Hee hee,&quot; Erick chuckled as he modeled his new underwear.<br />
<br />
Then he turned his attention to the 11 remaining body parts.  It was like a Bionicle or Lego person sort of- <br />
you had the head and the torso, hands, arms, genitals, legs, and feet. He selected the appropriate photos and <br />
soon was modeling his new outfit in front of the mirror.  <br />
<br />
When he entered the living room, his father and uncle were sipping brandy.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how do you like my new Christmas togs?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hm? Very nice, but you didn't use his hands for the gloves,&quot; John said thoughtfully. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, they make grand socks, I figured it would be like he's massaging me feet when I walk,&quot; Erick explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that's his penis around your neck?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that is nice,&quot; said Luke's father, &quot;When you wrap him around your head, it'll be like you're kissing <br />
him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh,...yes,&quot; John said thoughtfully, &quot;Though I don't think it's cold enough to have to do that yet.  Still, <br />
it'll make a grand school tie when term begins again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is America, dad, they don't have old school ties,&quot; Erick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;John knows that, Erick, he grew up in Chicago with me remember?&quot; Luke's father said.<br />
<br />
Erick licked his lips. &quot;Yes, uncle, I do remember,&quot; he answered.  He did remember that, but he also remembered <br />
that his father had been at Oxford and later Cambridge, and Sorbonne in Paris, and he wasn't really his <br />
uncle's brother, but he was - after all possession was 9/10ths of the law. Erick wondered if the real John was <br />
still inside his father's body trapped and unable to act or speak or if he had ceased to be or was trapped in <br />
John's old body. Except that was John's body, but maybe it hadn't always been or maybe it hadn't always been <br />
called John.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look distracted, Erick, don't you like your new present?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it's great, dad,&quot; he said pursing his lips.  He added, &quot;But - well, did you put me under the spell too? <br />
Because it's like I have conflicting memories.  I mean both sets of facts can't be true, can they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, that's the thing about magic son.  They can both be true if the magic man is powerful enough.  Ain't that <br />
right, muggle brother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess, John,&quot; Luke's father said without conviction.  He yawned, &quot;It's been along day. I think I should be <br />
getting to bed. Marjory's upstairs waiting for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, brother, I guess we should be going it's almost the feast day of that Pope Dionysius,&quot; John said <br />
distastefully, &quot;We want to be safe inside before that happens, Erick. We best get going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Feast day of Pope Dionysius? I thought it was St. Stephen's Day?&quot; his brother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it's that too.  Pope Dionysius is the first pope who didn't die a martyr.  He got on the good side of the <br />
Emperor.  I suspect he or his wife was a closet Christian.  Do you know on Dionysius' say-so, that Emperor <br />
ruled he could depose bishops and take the houses the bishop's church had bought for him and give it to a new <br />
bishop!&quot; John said in livid rage.  It was as if he had been Paul of Samosata himself. He licked his lips. <br />
Possession was 9/10ths of the law, and he had been Paul of Samosata for a while. But that was a long time ago.  <br />
Still that witch hunter had sensed it in him, had sensed the heretical nature of Johann's being. It was a very <br />
old evil, it maybe hadn't always been evil, but it had no conscience but its own pride and hunger.  Still he <br />
had a son now, he stared proudly at Erick.  John wasn't exactly sure how that had happened, but it had. Erick <br />
had the power too.  Usually, the children he fathered weren't his, just the biological outcome of his current <br />
body having sex with a woman.  But over the generations, he learned to preserve and change the body using them <br />
far longer than their original lifespans, and then he had found Lilly, Erick's mother.  She was like him, a <br />
true lamia, a true witch. Somehow, biology and supernatural essences had combined, and a new hell spawn had <br />
been created. Hm, he pursed his lips, hell spawn wasn't quite the right phrase, John thought as he trudged <br />
along the cold pavement blowing puffs of white air.  Still, John felt certain that Erick would do great things <br />
in a few centuries, if nothing went wrong.  Now why should he think that.  He shivered.  It wasn't the cold <br />
that made him shiver or made the hairs on the back of his neck rise. It was something that had returned to the <br />
world, something familiar to John - no to Johann. Something was hunting him. He shook his head.  It was his <br />
imagination.  It was thinking about Dionysius and that stupid court or tribunal or synod or whatever.  They <br />
were like the Inquisitors who came later. They couldn't understand his profundity, his - <br />
<br />
John's train of thought derailed as his foot hit black ice and slid out from under him. Strong hands caught <br />
him before he hit the walkway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright, sir?&quot; said the man holding him.<br />
<br />
John stared at the man's collar.  He belonged to the clergy. He seemed distracted. He glanced over his <br />
shoulder.  A young boy hung back behind him. The tall edifice of a stone church loomed behind them both. John <br />
had been so caught up in his thoughts he actually walked across the church's entryway. He swallowed. He didn't <br />
put much stock in hallowed ground.  He hadn't noticed this church before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright, sir?&quot; the priest repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes. Thank you, just had the wind knocked out of me by that fall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I should say something religious, but I can't think of anything appropriate offhand,&quot; the priest <br />
said helping John up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pride goeth before the Fall,&quot; quoted the choirboy or altar boy.<br />
<br />
John glared at the boy.  It was more than a boy, there was something older behind his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yes, I suppose, but maybe your guardian angel was looking out for you.  I know I wouldn't have been here <br />
to catch you if little Nicky here hadn't gotten himself lost, and then when recognized the church, he pounded <br />
on the rectory door, and pleaded with me to walk him home. We cut through the churchyard and just reached you <br />
as you slipped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guardian angel?&quot; John said.  There were good and evil angels, so why not a guardian angel for a witch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Happy St. Dionysius's Day,&quot; Nicky said with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you mean, Merry Christmas, Nicky.  It won't be Pope Dionysius' feast day until tomorrow.  I know most <br />
churches celebrate St. Stephen's Day, but it's also St. Dionysius' Day, and this church is dedicated to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;St. Pope Dionysius Church?&quot; John said backing away and staring up at the generic stone carving of a bishop <br />
over the church doorway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he was pope back in the 3rd or 4th century, we just call it St. Dionysius Church,&quot; the priest said <br />
politely. &quot;We do put on a nice mass and church festival afterward. Do stop by tomorrow, if you can. Mass is at <br />
10, and the festival begins with a dinner at 11:30. It's buffet, so if you can't make mass, come any time <br />
before 2 PM.  There should be plenty of food. Now, I'd best be getting Nicky home. You said you live on 12th <br />
Street?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sixth Street, father, apartment 13 at 66 6th street,&quot; Nick answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Six, Six, Six, number thirteen?&quot; muttered the priest unconsciously crossing himself. &quot;That's only three <br />
blocks from here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, are you alright?&quot; Erick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just slipped, but luckily this good priest was here to catch me. In front of St. Dionysius of all places,&quot; <br />
he said with the grin of a man who just escaped great injury and knew he shouldn't have.<br />
<br />
The boy Nicky stared with his eyes wide open and his mouth gaping. He hadn't expected this.  He wasn't even <br />
sure what this was. He saw Erick clothed in living human body parts. They were distorted to fit like garments, <br />
but no glamour would ever make him see a dismembered human body as anything but that.  Strangely, the separate <br />
parts weren't bleeding, and they were obviously and unnaturally still alive.  He said hurriedly, &quot;My mum will <br />
be worried, Father, please take me home now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick kept looking nervously over his shoulder at the retreating father and son.  He had seen a lot of things <br />
in his existence, but this made the short list. He contemplated sticking around to see what would happen.  <br />
Maybe he could accuse the priest of molesting him or-<br />
<br />
The priest had stopped. It had been only 3 blocks. They stood at the brownstone number 66 on 6th Street. The <br />
priest pushed the buzzer for apartment 13.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, it's Father Tim from St. Dionysius, I seemed to have found your little Nicky, and just wanted to make <br />
sure he made it home safely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be down to get the boy. Thanks for bringing 'im ome,&quot; said a throaty female voice.<br />
<br />
Thirty seconds later the door flew open. A tall haggard looking blonde woman in a frilly negligee stood there <br />
holding a cigarette in one hand and a martini in the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nick, where ya been? You shoulda been 'ome hours ago,&quot; she said in an odd accent pronouncing the H in hours. <br />
Then she looked at the priest and said, &quot;Thanks for bringing him home, padre. You want to come up for a <br />
nightcap?&quot; she asked with a wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, but no. Though, if you'd allow it, I'd like to bless you both and your home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, why not?  Bless your heart out, padre?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicky suppressed a snicker. Then he noticed the faint scent of roses. There weren't any roses here. As the <br />
priest raised his hand to make the sign of the cross, they both saw the stigmata. Nicky grabbed his mother's <br />
hand, perhaps their combined powers could...<br />
<br />
It was a simple blessing, the simplest exorcisms were the best. The entire apartment house had been exorcised <br />
in the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Nicky stood clutching the skeletal succubus' hand as <br />
the cold fires of hell burned all around them.<br />
<br />
&quot;His mother&quot; looked at the hand which formerly held the martini, and looked mournfully at her empty hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could really use a drink right now!&quot; she shouted squeezing Nicky's hand hard with her other hand.<br />
<br />
Nicky just flexed his hand, and the bones of her skeletal hand went flying.  She shrieked in agony.<br />
<br />
&quot;You forget your place, mum.  I have a report to deliver,&quot; Nicky said shaking his head.  He still looked like <br />
the little boy he had found in the river Thames during the Great Plague.  He had animated that corpse ever <br />
since, and his own form clung to its shape out of habit.  <br />
<br />
The sight was disquieting to the succubus who had been the boy's mother before she had drowned him to keep him <br />
from catching the plague. Nick had explained to her that her boy had the gene that made him immune to the <br />
plague same as she had, but murder was a cardinal sin, especially an unnecessary one. She had stared at what <br />
she perceived as the corpse of her son returned from his watery grave to punish her. That he had done, he <br />
transformed her into a succubus.  She had been cast down to hell, but whenever he needed a mother, the demon <br />
or fallen angel or whatever it was would summon her back to earth to possess a human woman and use her body, <br />
and allow her to feed on whatever men she could seduce.  Possession was 9/10th's of the law, but she had been <br />
dispossessed.  But this time Nicky had been cast down with her, so he wouldn't be summoning her out of hell <br />
any time soon.  She had expected him to look like Cthulu or an imp or anything but her drowned son. It was <br />
very unnerving.  She really did need a drink, but this was hell, and it was dry as Utah during prohibition.<br />
<br />
Nick's hurried pace slowed as he thought about his report. It was less of a report and more a series of <br />
uncertain impressions and conjectures.  His simple mission to protect an evil minion from slipping on ice in <br />
front of some old church in some third rate town had proven far from simple. Oh, his mission had been <br />
successful.  Up until the point he saw a young human with an unlost soul- not exactly an innocent-but <br />
definitely no yet damned, and not possessed, but filled with power which no true human should possess, and <br />
dressed in the pieces of a living person.  Nick shook his head, and stopped walking. That priest had been <br />
waiting for him, Nicky had been expected. Nick had expected to knock a good long while to rouse the sleeping <br />
priest from his Christmas brandied egg nog. But the door flew open on the first knock, and the priest was <br />
already in his hat and coat. Nick had assumed that the priest had come outside for a smoke or to walk off his <br />
drunk, but he was stone sober, and eager to help.  Too eager in retrospect. Guardian angels indeed, thought <br />
Nick angrily.  In his anger, he forgot his shape and began to grow beyond his usual size, but from habit still <br />
retaining the corpse boy's original shape.  It was just now about 15 feet tall, and Nick realized it when he <br />
had to duck through a doorway.  Still he was too angry to shrink back.  The saint - because that's what the <br />
stigmata signified, and that's what the priest had been- had known Nick's mission and had helped him complete <br />
it.  Then, that saintly priest had exorcised not just Nick and Sybella, but the entire unholy cadre that had <br />
called the apartments at 66-6th Street home. He had sent them all packing to hell.  What did it all mean?  <br />
Nicky paused, and shrank back to his former size. It meant his master would be displeased with him for not <br />
knowing, and his master would do what he always did in such circumstances.  Nick's master would torture him to <br />
make him remember some important detail that he had forgotten, or never knew.  Of course, the torture would <br />
continue until the evil master got the answer he desired.  Nick had no answer. The torture would go on <br />
forever. He looked around, maybe he could find a messenger to deliver his report, and take the inevitable <br />
punishment instead of him...<br />
<br />
Laura Stockbridge dropped to her knees, and started sobbing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thank you, thank, father. You saved me,&quot; she sobbed tears of gratitude. She held out her hands.<br />
<br />
Behind her the boy sputtered and coughed.  She turned to him, and her CPR training kicked in. His body was <br />
cooling rapidly, it was like he had just drowned. She pressed on his chest and breathed in his mouth while <br />
pinching his nose. He sputtered and coughed up water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-where am I?&quot; he said looking at the strange woman who had breathed life into him. His mother and the <br />
Thames were nowhere to be seen, and everyone was dressed so strangely. He spoke with an odd accent that <br />
sounded vaguely like a Bostonian one to Laura Stockbridge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, you're home with your mother now, Nick, you asked me to bring you home, remember?&quot; said the priest in a <br />
slow kindly way. He looked a Laura Stockbridge, and said to her, &quot;I think we'll be needing a new secretary at <br />
the rectory, Mrs. Hanover's children have been pestering for her to move to Florida with her and she just <br />
turned 65. How would you like the job?  It doesn't pay much, but I'm sure it's enough for you and your son to <br />
get by on. You live in apartment 13,&quot; he added helpfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A young boy needs a caring mother, and you just breathed life back into him,&quot; the priest added solemnly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yes, yes, I guess I did,&quot; she said hugging Nick closely to her bosom.<br />
<br />
Nick looked around and whispered softly with a high degree of suspicion in his voice, &quot;Are we still in <br />
London?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;London, England?&quot; Laura asked looking at him. &quot;No, we're in America - you're in America now, son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  Is Charles still king?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No, Prince Charles' mother Elizabeth is still queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Elizabeth isn't Charles Stewart's mother, and she's been dead a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Longer than you think, Nicholas Blair Stockbridge,&quot; the priest said in a strangely firm and knowledgeable <br />
tone, &quot;For the year of our Lord is now two thousand and eleven, and Elizabeth the Second is seated on the <br />
throne of England.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not the year of the devil? One-six-six-six?&quot; Nicholas asked uncertainly.<br />
<br />
&quot;1666?&quot; Laura Stockbridge asked as she looked from Nicholas to the priest, whose face and hands seemed to be <br />
glowing from within.  <br />
<br />
His eyes sparkled when he answered, &quot;God works in mysterious ways. What the lord taketh away, he giveth too. A <br />
second chance, even for the devil himself. At least that's what St. Thomas Aquinas reasoned.  That prodigal <br />
son parable was really an invitation for Lucifer to forsake his evil ways and return to Heaven's fold, at <br />
least ways that's one interpretation. Now it's getting late, and you need to get young Nicholas properly fed <br />
and to bed.  You can introduce him to television and the internet tomorrow. He's got nearly 400 years of catch <br />
up to do. Stop by the rectory tomorrow at 9:30 am, and we'll have you fill out the necessary paperwork, Laura. <br />
And when the next semester starts, there will be a place for Nicholas at St. Dionysius' School.  Merry <br />
Christmas!&quot; <br />
<br />
He closed the door and and was gone.<br />
<br />
Father Timothy sat up with a start in his easy chair. His eggnog sat on the table undrunk next to him. The <br />
phone was ringing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?  Yes, Mrs. Hanover? What? Speak slower. Oh, your children sent you a one-way ticket to Florida? They <br />
want you to fly out tomorrow?  No, no that's fine. We'll make do, no worries, Mrs. Hanover. You just go. God <br />
will provide.  No, no, everything's planned for the festival. Yes, I'm sorry you'll have to miss it, but <br />
seeing your first grandchild born is worth missing the festival.  Your flight leaves in less than two hours? <br />
Oh, they called you late last night, and emailed you your tickets?  That's wonderful.  You can come back next <br />
year to visit if you like,&quot; the priest said jovially. His heart was racing, and his head was spinning. Where <br />
would he get a secretary the day after Christmas? He felt so warm. He looked down he was wearing his overcoat <br />
and collar. The sun streamed through the window. He glanced at his watch it was 9 AM.  He had Mass at 10.  He <br />
raced into the bathroom, shaved and showered and dressed.  He didn't remember putting his overcoat on. He <br />
shook his head. He looked up at the crucifix by his bedroom door. &quot;Oh, lord, help me get through this day,&quot; he <br />
said. It was precisely 9:30.  The doorbell rang.<br />
<br />
Laura Stockbridge stood there in the closest thing she owned to her Sunday best.  The priest blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you told me last night to be here at 9:30 to take over for Mrs. Hanover?&quot; she said uncertainly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I?  Well, I'm not sure how it happened, but I'm glad you're here. I just found out a half hour ago that <br />
Mrs. Hanover was flying to her children and not giving the customary 2 weeks notice.  She's expecting her <br />
first grandchild and wanted to be there when she is born.  You say I told you?&quot; he asked doubtfully, shaking <br />
his head, &quot;Last night? But I fell asleep in my chair, oh it must have been sometime around 8 o'clock. I <br />
couldn't have been in two places at the same time could I? Only a saint could be in two places at the same <br />
time, and I assure you I am no saint. I am just an ordinary man, who has to get changed into my vestments or <br />
I'll be late starting mass.&quot; Hurriedly, he grabbed a black spiral notebook from inside the office next to the <br />
door. He thrust it into Laura's hands, &quot;Obviously, God sent you.  The church needs a secretary, and here you <br />
are. Here's the office manual.  Mrs. Hanover compiled it over the last few months for her replacement. She <br />
said she didn't know when God would call her away, and she wanted to be prepared. I looked through it last <br />
week, and she was very thorough, right down to which drawer the paperclips are kept in. Aha, that's it! Mrs. <br />
Hanover sent you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, never met the woman,&quot; Laura said truthfully and nervously. She glanced down at the cleaning printed pages <br />
of the notebook.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that doesn't matter. All that matters is you're here. Skip ahead to the last section, she arranged it by <br />
month from January through December, and look the 26th - it's the Festival of St Dionysius. Oh, it's nearly <br />
10, I've got to fly,&quot; Father Timothy said brushing by Laura and out the door. He spun on his heels, &quot;Oh, <br />
almost forgot. What's your name, Ms. Stockbridge?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it's Laura Stockbridge. You knew it, see you did meet me last night!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Laura Stockbridge?  It does sound familiar, but I think I dreamed it all. No matter, there's Mrs. Flannigan, <br />
if I don't get into the church before she sees me, she'll talk my ear off, and I'll most certainly be late <br />
starting Mass.  The office is in there. Help yourself to coffee and whatever. And welcome to the parish, Ms. <br />
Stockbridge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Father,&quot; she said with more earnestness than the priest expected from a secretary. As he <br />
disappeared into the side door of the church, she added, &quot;You really are a saint, even if you don't realize it <br />
yourself.&quot;  She closed the door and sat down and flipped to December 26, 2011, and started reading.</p>
