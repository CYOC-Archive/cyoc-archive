<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bertha smiled at her creation. Despite her almost utter lack of breasts, Sindy had become the fattest woman most human beings would ever see. Her face was still very attractive - though her blubbery jowls, thick double-chin, fatter lips and bags under her eyes had changed the nature of her beauty - and her hair was the same thick, golden mass of curls it had been. But...<br />
<br />
  Her body was so fat as to be called globular. From her fat feet, basketball sized calves, treetrunk thighs, massive hips (she was now almost five feet wide from beam to beam) enormous ass (heaping a full two feet behind her), vast and wobbling belly (like a beanbag chair filled with pudding), fat laden arms (her upper arms were as fat as her calves) and hands (her fingers were so fat they looked like polish sausages and could barely curl into a soft, doughy fist) she'd become a living monument to gluttony.<br />
<br />
   And suddenly...she knew it!<br />
<br />
   Sindy gasped as she realized what had happened to her. She'd been intending to slip into her new bathing suit and go down to her buildings pool when her transformation occurred. Then suddenly...THIS!<br />
<br />
   &quot;OH MAH GAWD!!!&quot; she suddenly screamed, noticing that even her voice was thicker and deeper. And what was wrong with the way she spoke?<br />
<br />
   &quot;Wha' happen' teh meh?&quot; she asked the empty air. After a moment she realized that the sudden fattening of her face (particularly her much thicker lips and cheeks) had changed the way she formed words. She dropped the ends of individual words and rolled long words together differently. She smacked her lips, rolled her tongue, then said in her newly deepened, heavy voice &quot;Th' rain 'n Spain faws mainly on th' plain.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Then she inspected her body again, and realized that her speech was the least of her problems.<br />
<br />
  &quot;Wha's wrong wid mah body?&quot; she wailed. &quot;Wha' happen teh meh? Ah'm fat! How did ah become show FAT?&quot;<br />
<br />
   She turned and waddled slowly and ponderously out of the room, noticing that the door to her room was much wider than it had been. Almost as if she'd always been this fat and the door was designed for her.<br />
<br />
   She soon found that to be the case, as her whole apartment had been redesigned! Wider doorways, lower furniture and thicket foundations were the rule. She waddled about in shock as she saw that the smallest chair she owned looked like a sofa. It made since, as she'd never fit her ass into anything smaller.<br />
<br />
   In the kitchen she found the crowning obscenity. Their was junk food...everywhere! Boxes of various snack cakes, bags of chips, cheese curls, salty pretzels and pork rinds, and boxes of donuts sat on her counters. Inside her cabinets were more of the same, as well as cans and cans of puddings, cake frosting, mixed fruits (in heavy syrup) and a bewildering assortment of boxed candies.<br />
<br />
   The refrigerator was now different. Several cases of soda and jugs of juiceless-fruit punch were all she had to drink. more than a dozen cakes and pies filled the shelves, while her freezer bulged with ice cream, Popsicles and other frozen treats.<br />
<br />
   It was almost as if her whole kitchen was made to store snacks and dessert. Their was almost nothing that could be called a &quot;Dinner&quot; item.<br />
<br />
   That didn't stop her. She'd noticed the pang in her stomach right from the start, but shock had kept her from it until now. But as she waddled through her kitchen, she found her hunger growing by leaps and bounds. She opened a box of donuts and started eating, then grabbed a box of candy and tumbled several into her mouth at once. This only fulled her need, so she took three pies out of the fridge and stuffed the slices of one (they were ALL pre-sliced) into her maw  one at a time. She found she chewed little, as that took to much time. Instead she pushed a slice of chocolate pie into her mouth, swallowed almost instantly, then went back for another slice.<br />
<br />
   While she did all this, her mind seemed to trance out. She stopped thinking of her speech, her apartment or even the changes to her body. Her belly was empty, and she needed to fill it. Little did she dream that her primary goal for the rest of her life would be to fill the vast emptiness of her belly.<br />
<br />
   Eventually she started to slow down, as her belly became fuller and fuller. When she was done, she'd devastated the supplies of her kitchen...but that great roaring emptiness within her was finally stilled.<br />
<br />
   She moaned in ecstasy as she lolled back in one of her reinforced kitchen chairs. Her belly was packed so full that it had become a great, tight globe before her. She suddenly didn't miss her breasts or her conventional beauty. All she wanted to do was sleep.<br />
<br />
   She stood shakily and waddled back to wards her bedroom, unable to think clearly she was so full. She rubbed and stroked her belly like a gypsy with a crystal ball, unable to imagine any happiness greater than this. As she rolled into bed, she found that her bedroom was decorated with paintings of fat woman. She only barely noticed these, as she flicked the lights off (with a hand held remote equipped with very large buttons) and closed her eyes almost at once. As she drifted off, her mind tried to focus on the issue of her sudden transformation. Unfortunately, she was now dominated by her belly, and her belly wanted to sleep.<br />
<br />
   She drifted off quietly, moaning just once &quot;Wha's wrong wh' meh?&quot; as sleep overtook her.</p>
