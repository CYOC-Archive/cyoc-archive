<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kirk's father, Eli, looked suddenly horrified as he grasped the truth that his son had full knowledge of how to use his voucher.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, dad...it'll all be over soon...at least I hope it will,&quot; said Kirk, taking a few steps back.  Kirk wasn't wearing his glasses because part of his wish called for an immediate gift of 20/20 vision. <br />
<br />
Eli gasped as he noticed himself in the small round mirror situated high up facing him on the wall.  The wall grew upwards, shooting past his view.  He could no longer see the mirror anymore...it was like being inside a room inside the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland...but that was impossible!<br />
<br />
It dawned on him the wall was not growing, but rather, that he was shrinking.  In panic, he ran into the bathroom, stumbling because his pants had grown baggy and were now several inches too tall for his legs.  He turned around in a daze and his son, walking casually into the room, now dressed in one of his small T-shirts, presumably for effect, and began to calmly explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, dad, it's just been mean of you.  It's all your own fault.  You wanted me to be everything I couldn't.  You wanted me to be bigger and faster than my body was ready for.  So *I* decided to just TAKE you up on your offer!&quot;  Eli saw that his son's voice had grown tight on him, cracking and jarred, and Kirk's stomach could now be seen to have wisps of fine hair.  <br />
<br />
&quot;But this can't happen!  Kirk, I'm your father, whatever I've done it was because...because...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you wanted to be in control.  You wanted me to feel weak and beneath you.  You wanted me to feel guilty because I wasn't the best physical model for a boy my age.  Well I guess I just decided I'd have to take care of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kirk was fifteen by all appearances now.  His face was still like a child's, but his frame had grown taller, and his stomach could now be seen amply, and his legs were spindly, but he now came up to his father's neck.  His neck!<br />
<br />
Eli fumbled around in his clothing, unable to move, the shock of being stuck in time overwhelmed him.  None of this seemed real, only in a dream could such a thing occur.  But it wasn't, and he knew it.  The Madame Illusia was only too real, and he had been given the short end, as it were.  All of his dreams were slipping away, like his clothes were slipping around his body.  He stuck his hand around hopelessly into his pants, trying to clutch them to his frame.  He could easily move his hands around, and if he let go of his pants now, they would fall to the ground.  He turned to walk over to the kitchen door and stumbled and fell because his feet were now way too undersized for his feet.<br />
<br />
Getting up he saw his son face-to-face.  Kirk grinned devilishly.  He now looked noticably older, his face had taken on not just the dim facial hair growth that would take quite some time for Eli to get used to, but his face had grown, his chin strutted out, his mouth was bigger, his entire lower face looked strong and shone with sweat and stubble.  His hair was fine, spiky, and thick, and longer from growing several centimeters, and his skin flushed with color.  Kirk spoke in a voice now unfamiliar:  &quot;Dad, think of it this way.  You get to have what people only dream about...you get to live longer..ha ha ha!&quot;  Kirk looked at himself in the hallway mirror, moving outside his father's line of vision.  Eli felt himself on the verge of tears.  He numbly walked out, dragging and hopping along with his pants until he finally gave up and walked outside of them...leaving his manly slacks on the floor, abandoned.  <br />
<br />
Eli had outgrown his shirt and it now clung to him, begging to rip.  His arm muscles had already become positively huge.  He looked like the quarterback for a college football team.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Daddio!  Check out this package.&quot;  said Kirk, grinning, and posing a flexed bicep over Eli.  Kirk's face was much more square now, his body lean and perfect, and imposing.  He was an adult.  <br />
<br />
Kirk had become shorter and shorter as he watched, mesmerized.  He was now only in appearance the age of thirteen, and his manly visage disappeared in a ripple once, twice, three times until he had the humble face of a mere child.  Everything about him that had once exuberated confidence now dwindled to nothing.  Kirk took off his T-shirt and the smell of his pungent man-sweat filled the air.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad for eleven, huh, dad?&quot; he said, laughing and grinning.  Kirk backed up and joyously surveyed the room, in his too-tight underwear which could by the way no longer completely cover his immense shaft of a dick.  &quot;Ohhhh, man.  Oh man, I can't believe I did it!&quot; said the unfamiliar man now looking down on Eli. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't believe it either,&quot; said Eli, looking like he was playing dress up or make believe, in his white collar shirt.  He slowly took it off and stood helplessly before his son.  Kirk scratched one of his bulky pectorals and reached down and lifted Eli off the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU are going to school.  *I* am going to WORK.  Are we clear, YOUNG man?&quot;  Another grin.  Another dodge into an unreal situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I don't have a choice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll like it!  I get to be the adult now and you don't have any decisions to make,&quot; declared Kirk, sounding for all intents and purposes like a grown man.  &quot;And if you don't like it, tough.  Cuz' you're not getting the chance to go back.  I like this body and I like being bigger and in charge.  Now get YOUR things ready for school.  Something tells me you won't be bringing a power tie, little guy.  Dad, dude, this is gonna be GREAT!&quot;  And with that Eli triumphanttly swaggered to his new room to get dressed.<br />
<br />
Eli picked a muscle shirt first and felt the smooth fabric caress his skin tightly, over flowing ripples of rock hard flesh.  His flesh.  He looked down on everything now.  It was a rush of power he did not know he could feel.  In addition, he did not look like his father, not exactly.  He shared similar features, but he was cleaner looking and had a bigger chest than his father did.  His arms he realized, were positively massive and he could feel their weight as he shifted them through the air.  It was like he was lifting something heavy just by MOVING.  <br />
<br />
Over the muscle shirt came an old gray sweatshirt, stained with sweat, and it clung to his massive frame.  He must be 6'3&quot;, and he confirmed it on the wall he always measured himself.  In fact he made a new notch, just to make himself have a good laugh.  His previous notch was down near his waist now.  <br />
<br />
He dressed in some underwear briefs and slacks, and then decided to wear a power tie and business shirt just so he could feel it press against his muscular build.  After he was finished he came down to get Eli.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eli?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli turned around, sullenly.  &quot;Oh, you're calling me by my first name, now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am.  And if you were smart, you would start calling me oh, I don't know, DAD.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But people will know.  They've never met us before.  They'll know something is wrong.  And you don't even HAVE a job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I own your gym now.  And I teach phys ed at the local high school.  Just check all of my accounts and finances.  When I wished to be in charge, the magic took care of those little details.  I have it completely covered.  As far as anyone knows, I've always been a giant, and you've always been my widdle wugwat.&quot;  He rubbed Eli's hair.  Eli straightened it out and took some deep breaths.  Kirk leaned against the kitchen counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not gonna be mean, like you were, but you are gonna get used to it, and I will punish you if you get out of line.&quot; Kirk said, finalizing his dominance.  &quot;Now get in the car.  I'm driving you to school.&quot;<br />
<br />
Putting on his immaculately clean executive suitcoat, Kirk rushed Eli outside.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This is crazy!&quot; said Eli.  &quot;You don't even know how to drive!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you?  Think hard.&quot;  Eli tried and gasped.  He'd completely forgotten!<br />
<br />
Little things like your memories of adult things...I also got rid of your ability to remember legal jargon and anything TOO complex.  I got the driving abilities and rest as they say, is history! Now get in, sailor.&quot;  Eli complied and got in the passenger's seat.  Eli got in the front and looked on the driver's stick greedily.  He performed his job as parent and guardian and dominant male eloquently as he cruised on down the highway singing a tune and dropping Eli off with some sound advice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't ever let them see you afraid or panicking,&quot; he said.  &quot;Now understand, you'll never forget who you are or your memories as an adult.  I don't want that.  I WANT you to remember so you know exactly what you've lost.  And the way I figure it, I'm doing the world a favor.  You were gonna pull some age switch on some poor sap to escape middle age when the time came.  Now you ARE the sap.  Heh.  Well, don't just stand there.  Get going.  Room 212.  Have fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Watching him with a mix of disgust and awe, and wishing he could be more like him, Eli watched his son disappear down the street, driving towards his new happy life.  And then he turned around to the school and gulped.</p>
