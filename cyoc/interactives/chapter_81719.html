<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake held up a pair of diamond stud earrings.  Wait, why did I pick these out, he wonders.  Jake had always <br />
associated them with popular and/or cocky guys which he was not but something about them he just couldn't <br />
resist.  Jake found himself walking into the changing rooms as if under a spell and before he could change his <br />
mind the earrings came to life and stuck themselves to his ears causing him great pain.  &quot;Ouch!&quot; he yelped as <br />
he felt enter him.  He worried briefly if some kind of poison was coating the strange earrings but his <br />
thoughts were interrupted by an overwhelming heat and nausea that brought the young man down to his knees.  He <br />
tried to stead himself as his bones inflamed with agony and he could hear them crack and expand.  As he slowly <br />
rose his legs lengthened, his body stretched.  Every bone and joint contorted, broken and repaired a thousand <br />
times a second as they were forcible pulled apart.  The skin was stretched disproportionately at first before <br />
also expanding. When Jake finally stood straight he was no longer an average height guy but now he was 6&quot;1.  <br />
He marveled at his new perspective and just as he began to think this may not be so bad another wave of heat <br />
engulfed him, this time focused on his skin.  Spreading out from beneath his shoes and from his finger tips <br />
came a wave of darkness that washed over his body, slowly spreading up and around, down into his sleeves and <br />
into his nethers.  He lifted his shirt to watch his frail and thin chest become darker, his nipples the <br />
darkest of all and slightly larger.  He now had a distinctly Portuguese complexion from his face to his toes.  <br />
&quot;Oh fuck, what do I do?  Who will recognize me now?  I look so different!&quot;  Even his hair had changed and was <br />
now a dark, rich brown of a thicker texture than before but a shorter length, a proper jock cut.  Had Jake <br />
been inclined to sports he might recognize the signature way his hair was rearranging itself, as a small <br />
amount on top slowly lightened to a high lighted blond color, deeply contrasting the dark brown around it and <br />
styling itself up with gel all on its own.  But sadly Jake was clueless towards sports, for the moment, that <br />
would soon have to change as well.  His hands began to shake and he held them before his eyes watching them <br />
tremble and itch, the fingers spreading out on their own accord, sticking out and stretching longer, growing <br />
thicker.  His palm cracking and expanding as his hands shifted to be in proportion to his longer body.  <br />
Expecting what was next and beginning to resign himself to the change Jake moved to remove his small skater <br />
shoes but was too late as already the material was bulging and tearing, finally ripping brutally in the front, <br />
as his larger toes emerged and then on the sides, utterly destroying them.  Jake watched his darker feet <br />
expand a few more sizes before settling on a large size 13.  He didn't have time to ponder his lost foot wear <br />
as his legs began to painfully ripple with muscle, the unmistakably large muscles of a pro soccer player.  His <br />
calves almost tearing as they expanded frighteningly quickly.  The sinewy muscle continuing to grow and bulge <br />
out into thick, tree trunks devoid of any fat and hard as diamond.  His thighs undertook a similar change <br />
beneath his cargos, so drastic they shredded his pants as entirely as his feet had to his shoes until Jake was <br />
left standing in boxers, looking even more ridiculously small on the legs of a giant.  His arms grew too, not <br />
as much but sizable, he flexed them eagerly, becoming drunk with the new power of his muscles.  He marveled at <br />
how his biceps expanded into lady killing guns that even fit men would surely envy.  Confidence washed away <br />
his hesitation and soon even the pain of his change was like pleasure as he groaned and moaned, his voice <br />
deepening and enriching to a low but soothing tone and unknown to him he was slowly developing a Portuguese <br />
accent to his new voice.  He was so enraptured by his change and he was allowing it to become him entirely.  <br />
He ripped his shirt off in a fit of pleasure and ecstasy, watching and rubbing his pecs as they bristled with <br />
strength and pushed themselves into a mighty shelf of muscle unlike any he could ever imagine possessing.  His <br />
nipples expanded more and pointed downwards slightly, almost hanging off the iron mounds of flesh he now wore.  <br />
His stomach carved itself into an indomitable set of abs, he punched his own gut to watch how his hardened <br />
stomach deflected it easily.  The change took another turn a strange feeling swept Jake as he began to age 10 <br />
years in mere minutes, time and transformation bestowing their gifts as his thin treasure trail blossomed and <br />
darkened across his tan chest, the hairs becoming dense, black and curling as befitting his new age and <br />
ethnicity.  They spread into his boxers as he pulled them off to watch his darker dick grow and grow, he <br />
stroked it eagerly as it expanded to full mast, now 8 thick inches with low hanging balls wreathed in dark <br />
curly hairs.  A dark forest enveloped his arms in legs as stubble fell across his face like a slowly spreading <br />
shadow.  His face itself aged beneath it and sharpened to a visage of unimaginable masculinity and charm, his <br />
smile now dripping cockiness from white teeth and jaw hard and powerful.  His nose broadened and ears shrank.  <br />
His bros furrowed and thickened.  His eyes burned with a dark passion almost startling himself as he gazed <br />
into his reflection, memorized.  His gaze seemed to bore into him as if his reflection was another man <br />
entirely trying to force himself upon Jake.  He fought briefly and pitifully against the onslaught of new <br />
memories and talents that soaked into his mind, in accepting the pleasure Jake had already sacrificed his <br />
self.  He was a football star, born and breed for the game.  A deep seated aggression from being raised in an <br />
atmosphere where football was life took hold.  Football is life, his mantra. He cared deeply for his club, <br />
Real Madrid and found himself overcome by a new sense of brotherhood with the men he played with and against.  <br />
A new love for a game others couldn't understand, an intensity that utterly obliterated Jake.  As the new <br />
Cristiano Ronaldo rose and shook his head, he pulled on some new clothes including a much larger pair of <br />
shorts to better reveal his legs and leave his new bulge undisguised and a skin tight polo with his nipples <br />
clearly etched into the fabric, ready to slice through at any moment.  He smiled at his reflection, testing a <br />
few poses before leaving the changing room a new man.  He waved at the shop clerk as he left, thanking him <br />
deeply for this irreplaceable gift before heading out on a quest for a new model to date and keep him <br />
entertained between games.</p>
