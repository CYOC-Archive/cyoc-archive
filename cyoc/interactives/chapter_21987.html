<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Woo... is it hot in here?&quot; Josh says as he shifts his weight a little on the sofa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel fine. Maybe I should feel you and see if you are fine too.&quot; Rick smiles and then lets out a loud crashing laughter as his jokes most often entertain him more than the rest of the world.<br />
<br />
Josh squirms a little more feeling a tightness in his clothing, its uncomfortably tight bunching up in the wrong spots: under his armpits and in his crotch as well as at his knees. He pulls at his collar a little trying to loosen it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow... ow what the hell..&quot; Josh grabs his crotch as he feels a pinching sensation and then it fades in to a feeling of pressure. Rick looks on extremely interested in whats happening, especially the crotch grab.<br />
<br />
Josh's shirt begins to shrink as the fabric shifts, becoming shiny and smooth as the sleeves on the shirt stretch out to his wrists with a slow creeping sureness. Rick gasps in shock and Josh is simply speechless.<br />
<br />
His shirt becomes lighter blue with a large yellow lightning bolt emblem on the front. The neckline moves up Josh's throat and then stops at the base of his head, like a spandex turtleneck.<br />
<br />
Doug is watching from the doorway transfixed. Its like watching a dream materialize. He had no idea the device would act so perfectly, and so slowly, giving him time to drink in the details. It was bliss.<br />
<br />
&quot;My shirt... I can hardly breathe.&quot; Josh said as he ran his hand over the shirt, it was indeed becoming tighter on him, squeezing his skin under it, working its way in to the details of each muscle to make his shape part of it, accentuating.<br />
<br />
He stood up and looked down at his pants. With a sure dread of realization he undid his belt and unzipped his jeans. He took a peek inside and exhaled in disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well those were boxers, and they were flannel... and kinda expensive...&quot; Josh says matter of fact, trying not to become too upset by his change.<br />
<br />
Pulling down his jeans and stepping out of them he revealed his new clothing. His boxers were gone, now replaced by what appeared to be a blue speedo that held him so tightly it looked like he might rip through the spandex itself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my.&quot; Rick said from the sofa. Josh had his back to him and was giving Rick a good view, he turned and Rick nearly fainted at the site of the full monty.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dont know whats happening. I wasnt wearing this!&quot; Josh exclaimed.<br />
<br />
The speedo joined with a little swish sound to his shirt, forming one item of clothing as it did so, and then the legs began to descend to Joshs knee and stopped. He looked like he was wearing a knee length set of tights and a matching shirt.<br />
<br />
With a pop his nice leather shoes turned to cloth and were replaced by bright red track shoes with speed laces.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you arent just a little super hero!&quot; Rick clapped his hands as he ran his eyes up and down Josh, who ranhis own hands over his clothing finding that it wasnt just tight, it was stuck on him as if painted there.<br />
<br />
Steph still didnt speak, completely fascinated, as was Doug from his vantage point at the entry to the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel funny.&quot; Josh said gripping his sides as if with a stomach ache.<br />
<br />
His muscles swelled, his chest at first, then his arms and legs and abs. Not a lot, but enough that he easily just gained 15 pounds of pure muscle. His calves were enormous like split melons exposed just at the base of his new costume.<br />
<br />
Josh exhaled, the change didnt appear to be pleasant, but not painful either. Doug wondered what it felt like and found himself entering the room.<br />
<br />
With a grunt Josh gripped his crotch again. This time he did have a look of pain on his face. Doug realized it instantly. Comic book heros  almost appeared to be male in form only. You never really saw the goods outlined against their tight uniforms. Josh was finiding that out too. His genitals were crushed by the costume before and now were being smoothed in to a blob beneath his cluthing hands, his face twisted with the pain and throbbing like a man who had been kicked.<br />
<br />
He slowly gained composure and lifted his hands. Sure enough he had a bulge, and that was all. Smooth spandex covered him and left only the hint of his manhood like a true comic hero.<br />
<br />
With a zip Josh was gone and a small breeze blew through the room. With a wave of air he was back again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just ran to the end of the street and back. I dont know why. I just suddenly knew I could. Holy shit man... Im fast... like... super hero fast!&quot;  Josh's face was a grin from ear to ear. Rick's was too. Steph was staring at Josh's package with a lusty gaze that moved around his muscles. Doug knew the truth, it wasnt a costume, it was part of him, the matter reshaping had been absolutely flawless.<br />
<br />
This would be a fun party.</p>
