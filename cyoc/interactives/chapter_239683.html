<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John had lost Ryan and Roy hours ago. At first he had worried, but as the night dragged on he found himself caring less and less. He was having a great time and he was sure his friends had found their own fun to keep them occupied. He had spent the last half hour at the centaur races, placing bets and hitting a winning streak. He had an eye for horses and that just seemed to translate to the weird hybrids they somehow had here. He just wished he could figure out how those costumes worked.<br />
<br />
He had also gained a new companion a few races in. A young woman had noticed his winning streak though he tried not to let on too much. She had latched on to him and followed his betting, all the while flirting quite overtly with him. She was just his type, too, with long auburn tresses and a nice full set of breasts that she knew how to display. Sally. That was her name.<br />
<br />
Soon the races came to a close, or at least a break to give the races some time to rest up and probably eat. John found himself being dragged off into the carnival by Sally, who seemed to want to stay by his side for now. John was more than a little pleased by that.<br />
<br />
&quot;What should we do next?&quot; She asked in a sing song voice. &quot;The burlesque show is supposed to be amazing, though only if you&#39;re into men.&quot; She added with a smile and a look to John, he grinned back.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want, I like both.&quot; He replied, as she looped her arm through his, the information making her grin mischievously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or there&#39;s the gambling hall, how&#39;s your luck with other games?&quot; She leaned in close, her warmth radiating into John&#39;s arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady&#39;s choice.&quot; He offered, earning another smile from her. She moved to her tippy-toes and looked around, grabbed John by the hand and dragged him off to the side of one of the alleys between a pair of tents. She came up to a door that clearly read &#39;Employees Only.&#39; She pressed at the door, only to find it locked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; John asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Privacy.&quot; She replied, slipping something out of her pocket and working at the lock. The carnival was adults only, and there were no rules as modesty went. As the night had dragged on John noticed more people wearing less, and even some sexual encounters happening out in the open. Hell, at the races he had a couple trading blowjobs next to him, opposite where Sally had stood. Still if she wanted privacy and if it mean John was going to get lucky, who was he to complain?<br />
<br />
She gave a small jump of joy as the door lock clicked and she pushed it open, dragging John inside. He thought he smelled the distinct aroma of cigar smoke for a moment, and for some reason it sent a chill up his spine. But then the throbbing in his pants had his attention back on Sally. Just the thought of getting laid was fogging his brain.<br />
<br />
The inside of the space was quite well lit, and it wasn&#39;t the snug closet it looked to be from the outside. It was actually quite spacious, and the walls of the tent were lined with shelves. Boxes and baubles lined the shelves, some of them glittering in the light. John bet it was mostly costume props and jewelry, because if even a few pieces were real.. then he locked eyes on a safe that sat in one corner. &quot;Maybe we shoul..&quot; But the words dried in his mouth as Sally opened the fly of his pants, letting the garment drop to the floor as she took his cock in her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hush. The risk is half the fun. Who cares about doing it where everyone can see if there&#39;s no rules against it.&quot; Sally pressed her mouth to John&#39;s as she stroked his cock, her hands working his shaft like an expert. Once more he thought he smelled a faint waft of cigar smoke, but he was too busy to question it. Instead he fumbled at Sally&#39;s skirt, finally getting it loose, he slide his hand into her panties, intending to slip a finger between her legs only for his hand to find something unexpected and familiar. He stepped back and looked down, a sizeable cock had popped free from Sally&#39;s panties.<br />
<br />
John didn&#39;t have much going for him physically, he was charming and confident which carried a lot, and part of that confidence was he was fairly well-endowed. Sally was apparently a match for him. Except she looked down and for a moment seemed as surprised as him, then she giggled. &quot;Look at that!&quot; She moved one of her hands off of John&#39;s shaft and on to her own, letting out a soft moan. &quot;Oh, I always wondered what that felt like. No wonder you boys like playing with yourselves so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, that wasn&#39;t?&quot; John started his question, only to see Sally shake her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;No..&quot; She didn&#39;t sound worried though, just intrigued. &quot;But I kind of like i---it..&quot; He voice suddenly dropped in pitch at the end, and she cleared her throat. &quot;Oh.. I guess more&#39;s happening.&quot; She added, giggling in her new deeper voice.<br />
<br />
John knew he should find it weird, or wrong, or.. something. But she still was stroking him off with one hand, and he had to admit there was something oddly arousing with the whole situation. She grabbed at her shirt with the hand that had been on her cock, and yanked. Newly grown biceps flexed and tore the fabric free, exposing her chest which had begun to lose its feminine fullness.<br />
<br />
John couldn&#39;t resist reaching out to take her breasts in his hands, rubbing them as they changed from fat to muscle. He didn&#39;t expect Sally to tear open the front of his shirt, sending buttons pinging off in several directions. &quot;Mmm.. you were hiding from me, you should dress a little more to show off.&quot;<br />
<br />
John blinked a looked down. He did dress well, and for his body. He didn&#39;t want too tight as he never had much to show off and actually the last few years had started something of a spare tire. But he looked down to see a pair of pecs and a lean stomach all his own.  &quot;That&#39;s.. new.&quot; He murmured.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.. I see.&quot; Sally added with a grin, &quot;we&#39;ve both gotten surprises. You ass is nice too.&quot; She added, reaching around to squeeze one of his cheeks. &quot;You should let me take my new cock out for a spin. You said you like it both ways, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
John coughed lightly. &quot;I like men and women, but I only top.&quot; He replied. Another whiff of smoke. &quot;Well.. maybe once.. just to try.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally was giddy, giggling and clapping which was beginning to look a little odd with her masculinizing body. John sighed and turned around, grabbing a pair of shelf supports with his hands. Sally was only too eager to get to work, spreading his cheeks with her hands, and then getting a finger to his hole. He had never had the courage to let someone penetrate him before, and Sally was sporting something not exactly on the small side. Still that finger was the first thing to enter him and he gasped. It hurt a little at first, but.. a whiff of smoke.. everything felt so much better all of the sudden, especially when her finger found just the right spot and he let out a loud gasp. The laugh from behind him was deep and masculine, he swore he could feel the finger in him getting bigger.<br />
<br />
The finger was pulled free, only for the thick head of Sally&#39;s cock to press up against his hole. He felt warm slick pre, but that was the only lubrication he had as she slammed her cock into him, no gentleness or slow going here. It should have hurt, he should have been screaming, he wanted to scream, but for a very different reason. It felt so damn good, his knees shook a little and he had to brace himself, shifting his stance a little to keep from falling over.<br />
<br />
She pulled out and thrust in, over and over, each time making John moan in pleasure, though as he pulled back he began to feel himself being yanked back. &quot;I&#39;m stuck.&quot; He heard the deep voice that now belonged to Sally say.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; John asked, reaching behind him, except where he should feel his ass pressed up against Sally&#39;s crotch there was just.. no gap. Then he felt his leg twitch, as if someone else was trying to move it and looked down. Where he should have seen two pairs of legs, there was instead one pair, thick and muscular, with large feet and powerfully thick thighs. &quot;What&#39;s happening to us?&quot; John asked. Once again, he wanted to freak out, but.. smoke.. no, he was worried but something about this felt.. right.<br />
<br />
He no longer felt like someone was filling him from behind, but a strange sensation formed in his crotch. His cock began to lengthen, and thicken, &quot;Huh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening up there?&quot; Sally asked, not sounding all that worried either.<br />
<br />
&quot;My cock&#39;s getting bigger. A whole lot bigger.&quot; John replied, releasing one of his hands from its grip on the shelf to grab at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! I feel that!&quot; Sally said, as John stroked the swelling member. It stopped growing longer, though it must have been a foot long by then, but still it was growing wider. Not thicker all around, just wider. Until the head of the growing monster popped apart into two, the split continuing to form down the middle until John was sporting two perfectly identical monster cocks. Or.. Sally and John did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lemme see.&quot; Sally said, and John felt her arms wrap around him, though they were no longer slender and feminine, she pulled herself forward enough to peek at the twin members. &quot;Oh, wow. Oh.. uh..&quot; John could feel Sally trying to pull back, but where her torso met John&#39;s back, they had begun to meld.<br />
<br />
Sally&#39;s newly formed muscles sank into John&#39;s torso, causing his to swell even further.  HIs pecs, which less than ten minutes ago had been non existent, and then nicely defined, were now swelling into mounds of muscle, his midsection thickened, but also maintained its rock hard cobbled abs, the groves between them growing even deeper.<br />
<br />
His shoulders widened, but oddly one side more than the other, though as Sally&#39;s head seemed to slide into place net to his own it suddenly made sense. Her features were no longer soft and feminine, she had a thick brow and a squared jaw. The only part of them that didn&#39;t seem to combine were their arms. Though that didn&#39;t stop John&#39;s arms from growing massively thick, Sally&#39;s arms were still well-muscled, but didn&#39;t grow any further.<br />
<br />
For a moment, SallyJohn felt like they had gone from two minds, to one, back to two, then one, then settled somewhere between. Thoughts flowed between them now, quick as lightning. A wondering what was happening to them, the conclusion they were becoming one being, their minds remained mostly separated, but the jerky motions as they both tried to control their shared body began to smooth out, a consensus coming between them on which mind should operate what at any given time. Sahn had a moment of respite and calm, enough to consider playing with their double cocks before another jolt passed through them, along with that lingering smell of smoke. They both had smelled it separately before, but now they both smelled it.<br />
<br />
Sahn doubled over, feeling their spine pulling in three directions, one behind and then both heads. A thick conical tail slipped free behind them, dropping to the floor with a heavy thud, even as their necks stretched out longer, giving their individual heads enough flexibility to look around them and even face each other. As soon as they did they let their lips meet, making out as their faces stretched into long, wide muzzles that fit together perfectly.<br />
<br />
Scales began to form on their skin, first on their shoulders and chest, an iridescent purple-red that glimmered darkly in the light of the tent. The hands that had been John&#39;s went down to begin pumping their twin cocks as the dropped to sit on the floor. The cocks were shifting in his grip, the heads becoming pointed as rough ridges formed along the backs. Their four massive balls pulled up inside them as the scales covered over that part of their body, then formed a slit around their twin cocks the hide them away when soft. Though they had the feeling they would rarely be completely soft. Legs reformed as the scales grew down, already thick and powerful thighs growing more so as their feet splayed wide, each toe becoming a thick digit tipped with a sharp talon. John&#39;s old hands similarly sprouted thick talons but remained human like as opposed to the splayed reptilian feet.<br />
<br />
Sahn was too busy making out with themselves to notice their features becoming more draconian by the moment. Each of their heads sprouting a pair of proud horns, their nostrils flaring and beginning to emit small plumes of smoke as they breathed little gouts of flame into their furiously kissing mouths.<br />
<br />
The arms that had been Sally&#39;s began to twist where they met the shoulders of their shared body, the fingers growing long and spindly as thick skin grew between the digits. Their chest already thick with powerful chest muscles perfect for flight shifted shape ever so slightly as the wings came in fully, spreading out behind them and threatening to knock a bunch of the treasures off their shelves.<br />
<br />
Then with a roar, they came, each cock spurting several thick loads of smoky smelling dragon cum all across the floor of the tent. Where once two people had been, a twin headed humanoid dragon now sat, panting softly in the afterglow of their orgasm.<br />
<br />
A faint clapping came from one side of the tent, where a man sat lounging in a chair. How Sahn hadn&#39;t noticed him they couldn&#39;t have guessed, but he looked amused. He wore a white suit that set off his dark skin. his head was shaved smooth but he sported a short curly beard. He was handsome and fit, the suit hugging toned muscles. And in the corner of his mouth, a cigar that gave off a faint plume of smoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite the performance.&quot; He said in a deep baritone as he got to his feet. Although the dragon was sitting, when the man stood they were eye to eye. And even if the dragon were taller, Sahn new that this man was not someone to trifle with. He was in charge, not them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Sahn&#39;s twin heads said in unison, though they weren&#39;t quite sure what for.<br />
 <br />
&quot;So you like your new body? Good.&quot; The man hadn&#39;t even waited for an answer. &quot;This sort of thing is more my brother&#39;s specialty, but I think I do well once in a while. You can call me Zephyr, a run this little carnival with my two brothers, and you&#39;ve been recruited.&quot; He looked around him and back to the dragon. &quot;I&#39;ve been needing some security to look over our treasures here and what better guard for a hoard than a dragon. I&#39;d ask you if you wanted to, but you don&#39;t really have a choice. Should have minded the sign.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zephyr adjusted his suit and plucked his cigar free to flick some ashes off the glowing cherry. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be well fed, and when you get sick of fucking yourselves, well, you&#39;ll have time off to play with the others around here. And anyone who wanders in here is yours to do with as you please, though you might cause some changes in them doing so. Good deal, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; Sahn&#39;s heads said in unison, their thoughts in agreement on this one. This wasn&#39;t such a bad deal, and this body could be endlessly amusing, and powerful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect. Spend the rest of the night getting acquainted with your space. I&#39;ll introduce you to the rest of the security team in the morning.&quot; And with that Zephyr disappeared out the door. Sahn&#39;s heads looked into each other&#39;s eyes, each getting the same idea. Maybe they could lure someone in to play with. How fun would that be?<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I like to hear.&quot;</p>
