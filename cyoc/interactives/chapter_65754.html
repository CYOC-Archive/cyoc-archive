<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Officer Barnes and I stayed on hand as the two sets of crews began to pack up their equipment. It was relatively quick work for them to do, and was mostly done as Molly and Patten headed out of the Conference room to head back to their respective classes. Molly paused give me a small nuzzle before ducking through the doorway and heading out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a good day, George,&quot; she said as she left.<br />
<br />
&quot;You too, Molly,&quot; I replied back to her.<br />
<br />
As Molly left, I returned my attention to the two reporters that were packing up their equipment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will any of the other teams come around here today?&quot; Officer Barnes asked, &quot;Do you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They could,&quot; the first reporter sighed, &quot;but all of that will depend on how they decide to cover the story related to this election.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are plenty of angles to be covered,&quot; the second reporter added, &quot;and no two reporters always follow the same angle... and since we'll be here until the election... there is plenty of time for us to cover everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, the other teams will come here eventually, but you don't know if they'll do that today?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's about right,&quot; the first reporter nodded, &quot;the only times when you'll have all of us in one place will be at your debates.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes and I glanced at each other. As a school function, the reporter's presence at the debates would probably require us to pull some &quot;overtime&quot; to provide security for the debate. I had no personal qualm with that, as Molly and I would probably go to the debate anyway. The assignment would allow me to earn some pay for what I'd probably be doing anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;And because this is so big, our parent networks have already asked for purchasing rights to copies of what we cover here,&quot; the second reporter commented, &quot;which means, they could end up as bits on what will be part of national level news programs. They might even come here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, more reporters,&quot; Officer Barnes grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it isn't that bad,&quot; the first reporter almost chuckled, &quot;for the most part, there is actually quite a lot of support for Animal People nationwide. Between the people who have ordered the Serum, those who approach the situation in very legalistic terms, and those who are simply tolerant... you're actually in the majority. Especially as it becomes clear to a lot of people that you aren't slobbering and uncontrollable. Having more reporters would give you good press.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And when is good press bad?&quot; the second reporter quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not so much the fact the press is good or bad... but that it changes how the town functions,&quot; Officer Barnes explained, &quot;this is a small town. A lot of this attention will be something the people here haven't dealt with much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On top of it, it may not matter if the majority of the people are supportive of Animal People,&quot; I added, &quot;if the guy in the minority is fanatical enough to take really drastic measures. I'm sure you remember Bill Williams' attack on the school and our station last spring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both reporters blinked and nodded. Nearly every local channel had covered that attack on some level. So they could understand that not everyone would be willing to let the majority take the lead in things. Knowing that made me somewhat nervous of Hireman. If he not only lost the election, but couldn't take the School Board down with him, would he turn to the same insane rampage that Williams had gone on? I seriously hoped not.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to assume that not everyone will take such extreme measures,&quot; the first reporter sighed.<br />
<br />
And with that the reporters and their crews slowly made their way out. They had just left the office and were headed out of the school when Mrs. Fitzpatrick returned from her &quot;sub&quot; mission with Molly's present class.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how did it go?&quot; she asked before Officer Barnes and I could head out, ourselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seemed to go fairly well, I think,&quot; I told her, &quot;they didn't cause any trouble and no one stormed the building.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know if any more will show up today?&quot; Mrs. Fitzpatrick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; I sighed, &quot;the two reporters that came were from two separate networks, and they have said that all the major local networks have reporters here... Fox, ABC, NBC, and CBS... they all have reporters here. The others probably will come here sometime during their stay... but the exact time is unknown.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They also intend to stay for the remainder of the campaign,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, &quot;Just give us a call if you need us for security again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, I will,&quot; Mrs. Fitzpatrick answered.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The rest of the day went relatively quietly. None of the other reporters showed up at the Elementary school for the rest of the day. It left me guessing that they might be either with the school district's Central Office, which would mean they were interviewing Hireman... or they they might have ventured up to Dave's vineyard, which would mean they were interviewing Tabby. Or they could very well be interviewing some people on the street to get some sort of consensus.<br />
<br />
The fact that the two reporters that Officer Barnes had met had mentioned that the election was bigger then any they'd dealt with before, left me nervous as to how their coverage would go. Officer Barnes and I couldn't be everywhere so we couldn't obviously know how all of their coverage went. All that I really knew of was the interview with Patten and Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how do you think the interview went?&quot; Molly asked me as we met on the way home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yours and Patten's?&quot; I replied, &quot;Okay, I guess. I'm more concerned about what the other reporters were doing today. They obviously decided to cover some other portion of the &quot;contest&quot; today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose there's only one way,&quot; Molly shrugged, &quot;our local news should just be coming on when we get home... or shortly after.&quot;<br />
<br />
I slowly nodded and we continued on our way. When we returned to Bandhavgarh Cabin, we did part ways briefly. I went upstairs to change out of my uniform while Molly went into the living room. As I took off the shirt portion of my uniform, I heard the television go on downstairs. I listened to Molly flicking channels while I undressed and then redressed in clothing that was more comfortable against my fur. When I came downstairs again, Molly had settled on to ABC and was watching the end of the national level news program.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what's going on?&quot; I asked as I moved to sit down beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;They just ended with a sort of human interest story,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;something about kids recovering from cancer... or something like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Remembering what the reporter had said about the national level programs taking minor interest in the Columbia Falls School Board Elections, I had a new question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything on the election?&quot; I wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;I came in at the end of the program. If they did, we missed it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed. It reminded me a bit of the story Clemens had mentioned while he had visited Patten. The fact that zoo employees would release venomous snakes on little kids, who when they understandably panicked were doomed to get bit, to get Clemens attacked by the irate parents and the fact that Molly's schedule and mine ended up making us miss all the coverage on the incident was a bit frustrating. Hopefully, the local news would repeat a lot of the information that the national level program had broadcast.<br />
<br />
&quot;The local news should be coming on next,&quot; Molly finished.<br />
<br />
And as if on cue, the local news titles came on. As they did so, Molly and I both focused on the screen as the reporters introduced themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our top story this afternoon comes from the northern part of our viewing area in Columbia Falls,&quot; the male anchor, who apparently went by the nickname Skip, even while on the air, &quot;and is related to the growing intensity of a local School Board Election.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skip then paused as a small picture of the Columbia Falls Elementary School appeared on the screen beside his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;The election largely deals with the presence of Animal People in the town and even in places of authority within the town itself,&quot; Skip continued.<br />
<br />
That was an exaggeration. I held no authority in the town. I was a patrol officer and at the lowest rank in the Columbia Falls Police Department.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, the Government in Washington DC has long since granted Animal People equal rights with Humans under the Civil Rights Act after the discovery of the truth behind Eugene Changes' scheme with the Animatrix Fun House,&quot; Skip continued, &quot;but as has been the case in countless Animal-Person cases, the presence of sentient and sapient animals has raised tensions and problems never considered by the framers of the Civil Rights Act. And the issue has largely had to deal with the instincts of the Animal-People in question verses the concern over how much their former &quot;human&quot; selves have control over their instincts. The incumbent, Wayne Hireman has charged that their instincts are in full control and that they have no humanity that would be recognizable under the Civil Rights Act... whereas his challenger, Tabitha Choir has insisted that the opposite is true and that the Animal-People are human in every way but appearance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Skip then paused and looked up, &quot;because of the intensity of this race and the potential consequences that could result from it, we will be bringing you coverage of the race and the principle characters in the race. And we begin with an interview conducted with the Animal People in question and with the man fighting to help Tabitha Choir, a newcomer to the town's &quot;political&quot; scene, win.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly and I watched as they played back the interview. Some pieces were edited out. Obviously the voices of the other reporter were not heard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Saying you hate Hireman may not have been the smartest thing, George,&quot; Molly commented nervously, &quot;you're justified in saying so... and I probably hate him too... the fact that he keeps coming after me... but you know if he's able to tape and edit that portion, he'll use it to make him appear as the victim.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed, &quot;They asked how I felt. And honestly, that's how I feel about the man... he's made Beauregard's racism his goal... I could tolerate him more if he weren't pulling such stunts, but he isn't. And so that is how I feel about him and how I feel about what he's doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly nodded, &quot;Hopefully, he doesn't get a chance to pull anything like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
And to that, I nodded.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next major piece of news that came out in relation to the election came not from the television reporters but from the newspaper. While Molly focused on our breakfast the next morning, I turned to follow the local newspaper and their coverage of the election. So far the polls hadn't changed to much. Hireman had made the race closer, but Tabby still appeared to hold a slight edge in the race as a whole. However, there were still plenty of charges of either corruption or other nonsensical things in the letters to the editor section. This likely all had to do with Hireman's latest charge, that I was urging the high schoolers to throw away their humanity.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how do things stand?&quot; Molly asked from the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unchanged,&quot; I sighed, &quot;though...&quot;<br />
<br />
My answer was cut off by a slightly longer section of the &quot;letters to the editor&quot; section in regards to the coverage of the election.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, George?&quot; Molly asked as she came to the door to the dinning room.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Amy has decided to give her statement,&quot; I told her, &quot;there is a longer letter to the editor here, and her name appears to be at the bottom of the letter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She has?&quot; Molly gasped.<br />
<br />
I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does it say?&quot; Molly wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It says,&quot; I began and then read, &quot;to the people of Columbia Falls, Montana. My name is Amy Vin. I am the person seen in the security camera footage used by Wayne Hireman to discredit Officer George Wayne and by association his wife, Molly Wayne. As has apparently been the case throughout this campaign, Wayne Hireman has used a series of dirty tricks to try and get ahead in the race. The facts he used in the attack are out of context and without understanding of the situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
I glanced up to Molly before I continued reading.<br />
<br />
&quot;To begin with, I must state that I had spoken with Officer Wayne and his partner of my own free will,&quot; I read, &quot;there was no collusion, nor coercion, nor any type of force applied to make me go in. Do not believe Hireman's charge that Officer Wayne would force the Animatrix Serum on anyone. My reason for being there had to do with personal issues related to my girlfriend taking the Animatrix Serum on her own. And yes, I mean girlfriend. She is Marcella Tyeree and was originally a human male before she took the serum because she loved me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I heard Molly gulp.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I'm sure you're beginning to guess, I am a Lesbian. A homosexual. Someone who's sexual attraction is to members of their own gender... yet Marcella found me beautiful when she was male and wanted to be with me. Because of my sexuality, I couldn't love her as a he. And she took the only option she could think off. She became Marcella. Became my girlfriend, and I love her very much, and I know she loves me. But since she included the DNA of the Maine Coon breed of House Cat, Marcella and I still have our difficulties. Marcella is still straight. She is a heterosexual Maine Coon, and while she loves me, I can not give her what she wants, biologically speaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
I glanced to Molly, who was checking on our breakfast, but had one ear turned toward me. I continued reading.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is why I went to speak with Officer Wayne,&quot; I continued reading, &quot;I've always loved cats, and as a large cat person himself... granted he is a tiger, not a house cat, I figured Officer Wayne would understand my predicament. I went to him to get help and advice for my situation. He and his partner were quite accepting and tolerant of my sexuality and have offered me plenty of useful advice. It was through that conversation that I learned that Marcella's heterosexuality was to do with her Cat instincts more then any personal desire to be with a male... and that assured me that I will always have Marcella's love. They gave me advice as to how to deal with it and work with Marcella's instincts. The easiest path, that they mentioned would be for me to use the Animatrix Serum myself... become a heterosexual tomcat and make my relationship with Marcella more normal. I can not say that we have made a finished decision in that regard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly had now moved back to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;But still, the conversation was private and dealt with me and my girlfriend and our relationship. And recently I have learned that Wayne Hireman has used me in an attack against Officer Wayne and his wife, against Mrs. Tabitha Choir because the solution offered to me involved the Animatrix Serum. Whether or not I do take the Serum and whether or not I become Felis Catus, that conversation had nothing to do with my other classmates or with anyone else in Columbia Falls. It was with me and about me. Mr. Hireman claims he's protecting me. I am telling you the truth now, is that Wayne Hireman is trying to destroy this school district. Trying to make people hate Animal-People because they have fur... trying to destroy the very thing he leads with his own paranoia! He had no right to view those tapes. No right! Do not blame the School Board. I have met with one Joseph Patten... and if the other board members are like him, I can not believe that he would commit such a flagrant act of invasion of privacy. Blame Hireman and his paranoia!&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that I set the newspaper down.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that's about it,&quot; I said to Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's come out with a lot,&quot; Molly replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she's trying to justify her positions as well as point out that Hireman is a manipulative liar,&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
Molly nodded, &quot;You know that people will turn on her. Homosexuals haven't had things any easier then many Animal People.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded. It was a said fact on how people could hate others. One of Changes's victims, Harry, had been killed by a mob that thought he'd committed some sin with his girlfriend. The girlfriend in that case was also badly beaten, and I couldn't entirely remember if she had even survived. And there were also the violent crimes committed against Homosexuals. Things were never easy, and Amy was not in for an easy path ahead. I only hoped that either her parents had come to accept who she was or that I, Officer Barnes, Marcella, Patten, the High School Staff, Officer Howard, other officers, or anyone who truly cared might be able to help and protect her from the metaphorical rapids she was sure sailing into.</p>
