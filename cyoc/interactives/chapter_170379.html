<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a town far from where the pandemic has started, people was still doing their activities like usual, nobody was really worried about that almost ridiculous virus that turns kids into adults. That means that kids in the area were still walking, riding, or playing on the town streets.<br />
<br />
Like any other day, Wendell had just left his home heading to school. He was short, thin, and skinny, with short blonde hair and green eyes. He was a regular fourth grader boy wearing jeans and a hoodie over his Fortnite t-shirt, he was well layered for the cold mornings in his town.<br />
<br />
He was walking downtown when he found a young woman crying in front of a hotel. He would normally ignore something like that but that girl was really beautiful with long curly red hair, a huge butt and two melons instead of boobs. He had a few extra minutes and toilet paper in his backpack so he approached her and offered a bunch of toilet paper to clean her tears.<br />
<br />
At first, she didn&#39;t want to accept the kid&#39;s help but then, she noticed how pretty he was and blushed as she was flattered. She thanked him and took the toilet paper from his hand. Wendell blushed too and smiled at her before he kept on his way to school. During the rest of the day he can&#39;t stop thinking about the beautiful girl he met. When his classes ended he rushed back to the hotel where he found her but she wasn&#39;t there.<br />
<br />
He felt a bit sticky and sweaty, probably from running. But most importantly, he was very sad. He knew it was a little stupid to think that he would be there again and was leaving when he heard a voice calling for him from above. It was her who was looking through a window. She invited him to come over and he immediately ran inside. His body felt tingly all over, but he just brushed it off.<br />
<br />
When he made it to the lady&#39;s apartment, he found her alone and wearing very provocative clothes. She told him that she came from another country with her boyfriend but they had just broke up and he left the town that morning. She kept talking for a while about her, her rich family and how she didn&#39;t worry too much about school or working. Wendell didn&#39;t know why but he was like hypnotized listening to every word she said.<br />
<br />
What he didn&#39;t know is that she was just doing time. Her true intentions were to get a new boyfriend and this little gentleman had a potential inside him. She just needed to trigger it with a little help from the virus that had already turned her into the bombshell she was now.<br />
<br />
After almost an hour of non-stop talking, she began to notice that Wendell&#39;s shirt started to feel a bit tight. Not only that, but his shoes were getting tight on him as well. He started to feel very uncomfortable but he didn&#39;t want to complain in front of that beautiful lady.<br />
<br />
After about ten more minutes of sitting and feeling his shirt, his shoes, and now his shorts getting unbearably tight, he couldn&#39;t stand it any longer and he asked her a minute to go to the bathroom. She  just smiled and nodded while she indicated him where the bathroom is.<br />
<br />
Wendell smiled back and tried to walk calmy despite he really wanted to dash out. He felt really uncomfortable. The top buttons of his shirt were about to pop off. When he was inside the bathroom, he immediately closed the door and ran to look in the mirror. Just in time, for the top three buttons of his shirt popped off, one right after the other! POP!<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy smoke! What the heck is going on?&quot; he wondered realizing that his chest had gotten too big for his shirt. Next, he bent down and noticed that his jeans had become too small for him. He had gotten taller!<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang! These jeans are new!&quot; he gasped, as he frantically started unbuckling his belt which was around his waist. In the meantime, his feet were killing him! His shoes were just holding back his feet from growing, while his toes, his ankles, and his feet were expanding at a rapid rate! His sneakers, which were new as well couldn&#39;t resist his growing feet any longer and RRRRRIIIIPPPPPP!!! Suddenly, his toes burst out from the front soles of them!<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAHHH!&quot; Wendell gasped, just as he had managed to get his belt off and started sliding his jeans down his much longer legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is happening to me?!! WHOA! MY VOICE!&quot; Wendell immediately noticed how his voice sounded different. It sounded deeper. Lower! No matter what happened now, those clothes needed to come OFF! He thought.<br />
<br />
He frantically tore the remains of his hoodie and his t-shirt off, while he had already gotten rid of his jeans and his shoes. Now, all he had left were his underwear and his socks. Then he heard the door opening. It was the lady who now looked way more smaller than him.<br />
<br />
She had a big grin on her face as she approached him. Then she put a hand on his chest and he looked down just to realize it. His chest was bigger!! his torso was wider!! his arms were thicker and his legs were longer! His muscles had inflated and now he had HAIR!!!!<br />
<br />
The blonde hair on his head had grown past his ears, but he had also gained hair on his chest, under his armpits, on his chin and under his nose! He has a beard now!!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man!! Ohmygosh!! What is this? Why I look OLDER?&quot; Wendell gasped as he still didn&#39;t believe that he was the huge man looking back in the mirror. He no longer recognized a ten-year-old kid but a young man, who was now possibly twice as old! He guessed that he now could pass as a college student! He was about six feet tall!<br />
<br />
Then he remembered that he was almost naked in that lady&#39;s hotel room. Not only were his socks too small for his feet, but his underwear was killing him. He desperately wantes to pull it down but he didn&#39;t want to be naked in front of her. Especially right now.<br />
<br />
However, she was way more naughty than he thought and she pulled his undies down. She gasped at the sight of his new manhood and testicles. And he gasped too!  They had grown tremendously!<br />
<br />
&quot;I need to get home! I gotta get outta here!&quot; he said in a panic as he tried to take his clothes and leave but she has other plans. She closed the bathroom&#39;s door and started to undress herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I got a new boyfriend.&quot;</p>
