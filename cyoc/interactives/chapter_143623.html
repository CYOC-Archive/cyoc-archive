<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As uncomfortable Stew was with both Jenny drinking he did find it curious that her drink evolution from hard lemonade to some of her mother&#39;s favorite cocktails was interesting... but of course she was drinking a lot for her body&#39;s first time and as such...<br />
&quot;shshshshssstewie why are you looking at me like a child? I know my way around the bar, and just look at my body.&quot; She then grimaced for a second and clutched her head. <br />
Stew said &quot;First off your totally drunk. No control just like your mother once...&quot; <br />
&quot;Huh? What&#39;s Mother got to do with any of this? Is it because she never liked you?&quot; Jenny seemed pretty out of it, and considering it seemed like her mom&#39;s memories were overwriting hers... Stew just hoped she wasn&#39;t talking about his wife and not his wife&#39;s mother. Regardless Stew he needed to do something fast or his daughter could be gone, and looking at the map while sipping on a Moscow mule (she was starting to know his more adult habits too well) and found a fountain of youth. <br />
He slammed down the rest of his drink and said &quot;How about we dance under a fountain then Honey!?!&quot;<br />
Jenny giggled and said &quot;Sound&#39;s fun letsss... you know I am kinda tip-&quot; <br />
Stew said &quot;I&#39;ll help you.&quot; As he grabbed the conglomerate of his wife and daughter. Jenny seemed to enjoy this and let herself be semi carried by Stew. A short walk later they saw a fountain spewing extremely clean water in the middle of a pond. The couple waded into the pond, and Stew checking on his daughter/wife noticed that her curves were slowly shrinking ever so subtly. Getting closer to the center the water was still as deep as their ankles. <br />
Jenny giggling said &quot;C&#39;mon let&#39;s dance.&quot; and as she attempted she tripped a bit and she fell down onto the water as Stew who was holding her also tripped down. Jenny getting up from her face forward fall got up and said &quot;Why don&#39;t you a bit better with a few years off?&quot; Stew only saw that her tits grew younger a bit faster than her ass, but Stew looked at himself and noticed his hair had gotten darker and thicker on his arms and legs. Jenny who seemed less drunk picked herself up with Stew and then said &quot;You look a little too old for me though, wouldn&#39;t want you to seem like a pedophile right?&quot; then pushed Stew backward as he fell into a stream of water the fountain was spurting out. To Stew it felt like the water was getting heavier when it was really him getting smaller.<br />
Stew scrambled out of the water and squeaked out &quot;The heck Jenny?!?&quot; as he looked at himself. At least his trunks shrunk with him, but he felt like he may barely be in puberty. <br />
Jenny giggled thinking to herself &quot;I guess cold water may have some shrinkage.&quot; then said &quot;Oh fine i&#39;ll do it as well so we actually look like a couple.&quot; She then jumped through the fountain&#39;s water and screeched &quot;Cold!&quot; then giggled a bit as she looked a bit like a 16 year old and then jumped through it and became a 12 year old. Jenny giggled and Stew felt his little guy stirring a bit as he stared at her figure, hips barely larger than her waist, tits just big enough to push out her bikini top a little. Jenny said &quot;I think it&#39;s getting late, how about we get dinner then go to the hotel?&quot;<br />
With them getting out of the youth water Stew asked &quot;So then... your not Jenny are you?&quot; <br />
Jenny thought a bit and said &quot;It&#39;s odd. I still feel like Jenny, but all my memories are kind of mish mashed with mommies... Then when I think of you.&quot; she giggled a bit and held up her ring on her hand and said &quot;I can only think about us as a couple, the wedding ring I had is now just a thing of plastic but the feeling is still there. Is this so wrong if we both want it?.. Do you want it?&quot; Stew wondered if there was anything wrong with a transformation vacation turning his daughter into kind of his dead wife and him enjoying it... The answer was probably there was something wrong and messed up with that, but he couldn&#39;t quite admit he didn&#39;t want it... it&#39;s just how much would Jenny remember when they returned to the real world and were untransformed. <br />
He did however say &quot;I kind of do... So how much of you is mommy exactly?&quot; <br />
Jenny tried to think and said &quot;Well... that&#39;s kinda lost... My name... it is Jenny...&quot; the girl was having a hard time as the park was continuing to overwrite Jenny&#39;s memories somehow pulling information from the heavens and shoving them into her brain. She closed her eyes and shuddered a bit and said &quot;Aside from maybe how I did some things and my name... everything... including the end...&quot; <br />
Stew grabbed a hold of Jenny and asked &quot;Are you going to be alright?!? Is there something I can do?!?&quot; He wasn&#39;t sure how painful it would be for someone to remember their death, but it couldn&#39;t be pleasant.<br />
Jenny smiled as she felt the heartbeat in her chest and said &quot;There is something on the other side... I think... I do feel kind of happy about that... I... no Mommy must be in there watching down over us.&quot; Stew could only watch and then Jenny grinned and said &quot;Hope Mommy doesn&#39;t get jealous. C&#39;mon there my love let&#39;s get dressed and get dinner.&quot; <br />
<br />
The hotel room they were given was a double suite with both rooms having a television, a king sized bed, a large closet, and a tablet in the wall. Their bags were in the shared living space however. Jenny was looking at a room service menu and said &quot;Man those ribs look good.&quot; as she tapped the ribs on the room service menu a plate of short ribs materialized on a table in the room. &quot;Well we don&#39;t need to go to a restaurant and this is service.&quot; she pointed to some buffalo wings for an appetizer, and then she pointed to something else when she yelled &quot;The heck do you mean to young?!?&quot; <br />
<br />
Stew said &quot;You barely have any boobs and you expect them to serve you alcohol?&quot;<br />
<br />
The two had a nice meal, and then after putting their luggage away (said luggage having change with their bodies with Jenny now finding bras in her luggage) the two of them were in Stew&#39;s room. Stew turned on the TV to the news channel while Jenny was looking around. Jenny started fooling with...</p>
