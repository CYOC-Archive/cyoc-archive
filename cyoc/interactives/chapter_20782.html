<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For Lee the days passed and like them he went into oblivion. His daily romps and dozens of rounds mating with sows kept those human thoughts and worries away.<br />
<br />
Mr. Gilke was so impressed by how Lee, his new boar hog did his duties and kept a growing sow population well satisfied. He entered Lee in the county fair, loaned him for breeding on other farms, and made sure his best hog was healthy and looking happy.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the F.B.I. had finished the sweep search of the county, as Lee's wife reported her husband as, missing.<br />
<br />
She recieved a small box containing her husbands soiled clothing, and shoes. Inside the box was a small plastic bag, it containing a ring with several yellow animal ear tags, and a dusty silver metal coin.<br />
<br />
No trace of Lee was ever found, not a body, marks of a scuffle, or anything giving a clue to where he went or why.<br />
<br />
Marlene sat at the kitchen table, the last belongings of Lee spread out in front of her. Tears still trickled down her face, she toyed with one thing and then another, but the yellow triangles on that steel ring held her wondering mind.<br />
<br />
A reply from the F.B.I.  told of just where the itens had been found by the detectives. She was puzzled about them, the names on the tags all being men's names, this had to be a clue.<br />
<br />
Tags in hand she took the note and drove in her car to the very spot. <br />
<br />
Standing there she saw the wooden stakes marking yet the spot each item of what was in the box, were found.<br />
<br />
The shifting breeze soon announced the local pig farm, it was as she looked at the yellow tags her memory flashed an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pig ear tages, the triangles belonged as a marking on Pigs!&quot; Marlene rationalized.<br />
<br />
Jumping into her car she drove the road and came naturally upon the Gilke Swine Farm.<br />
<br />
Like had the F.B.I.  agents, Marlene interviewed Mr. Gilke.<br />
<br />
His comments suggested there was something more than what he was telling, she wondered if this man might be some sort of mass murderer?<br />
<br />
She was about to leave when from one pen nearest the barn came this god awful squealing scream.<br />
<br />
Marlene looked toward the direction the sound came from, Mr. Gilke took off on a run toward it too.<br />
<br />
Standing inside his extra large pen stood this enormus black Berkshire boar hog.<br />
<br />
His sighting of someone he knew personally once, her voice, and the scent of perfume told even a man now boar hog, his wife was near.<br />
<br />
Mr. Gilke stood by the short fence, he looking at a very nervous boar . Lee stood shaking and foaming at the mouth, his boarish corkscrew cock out in a ragging hard.<br />
<br />
Eyes bugged out of his fatty face, he strained to mouth a propper greeting as Marlene stepped up, standing along side the farm's owner.<br />
<br />
Mr. Gilke told Marlene that this boar showed up out of nowhere. Almost he came the same day the F.B.I.  agents said her husband had vanished.<br />
<br />
Marlene dug into her purse, taking out the steel ring and seven named yellow ear tags, the same kind as his Boar, had in its right ear.  <br />
<br />
Even as they conversed the obvious seemed stupidly insulting that a man, Marlene's husband could have changed form, becoming a Berkshire boar hog. Yet, the more the told each of what they knew, it seemed ever so likely, the boar must be Lee.<br />
<br />
Now walking in circles, as would anny animal about to fold its legs and lay down, Lee walking along, dragged his cock's end along the concrete.<br />
<br />
Oinking maddly, a squeal now and then, the Boar hog was one upset critter!<br />
<br />
At this point nobody could know what Lee might be thinking, his sensualized body made for sex and dumb little else. His daily use, that of a breeder boar, his every waking hour kept his thoughts on sex, and feelings of and for having it with sows.<br />
<br />
This is when Marlene contacted me, I was her brother-inlaw.<br />
<br />
She asked of me to think about what she heard and then witnessed while at the Gilke farm.<br />
<br />
The time line was right, but the reality of a man becoming a boar hog seemed, silly.<br />
<br />
Marlene let me have Lee's last belongings, and I soon sat at home, by my desk there, looking over the items closely.<br />
<br />
The silver medallion or coin took a quick note, I cleaned it under the kitchen faucet, rubbing it to a highly, polished shine.<br />
<br />
Looking it over with a magnifing glass, I took note of the gothic print and the words written. Coping them down I turned to the computer, and then to the Babel translater program. Here I typed in the words and tried this language and that until I found the correct one.<br />
<br />
It then explained much, and the possibility of Lee becoming as a boar hog was now more likely.<br />
<br />
I knew that telling Marlene of what I expect could have happened, might lose her trust in my sanity. The only real way of proving it was to try the Medallion's story, and either Marlene of myself would become the proof and volunteer.<br />
<br />
After a full check of my closet I came upon an old shirt I have worn for the last high school reunion party. It, left over from the late seventies, would if warn maybe rejuvinate me into what I was then, if the coin really had any powers.<br />
<br />
It was that fated morning when I arrived to explain, show, and hopefully prove, my theory.<br />
<br />
The F.B.I. box in hand, I took them out of the box, showing it all to Marlene. She stood there gawking at me, her anger waiting to spring forth.<br />
<br />
I began to explain of the silver medallion, its inscriptions, the computer's suggested meaning of the words, and then my only real possibility for what happened to Lee.<br />
<br />
My explanation was met with obvious hostility, Marlene tossing the box at me, screaming at me, and telling of just how stupid she thought my theory was to her.<br />
<br />
Grabbing the silver Medallion she held it high up in the air above her head. Angered more than I had ever seen her get, she took hold of the steel ring, still having the seven yellow ear tags, and shook both in my face.<br />
<br />
As one might expect I tried to get the medallion away from her and she fought back. It was as the steel ring slid down her hand, my hand tried to graffle it away, my hand slipped through the ring as well.<br />
<br />
Instantly the Medallion changed from just shinny, to a glowing and powered thing, humming, telling it was anything but just a common silver coin.<br />
<br />
I looked at Marlene, she stopped struggling and looked at me, we both saw changes beginning.</p>
