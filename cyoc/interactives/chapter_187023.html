<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Help out your father in the garage.&quot; His mother said. Help his father? Jason gulped, looking over at the fat man, still shoveling food into his mouth and eyeing him as he noisily chewed and swallowed, belching loudly with each bite, slobber dribbling from his maw. &quot;Uh, help dad?&quot; He asked. His mother nodded, &quot;Well with me going grocery shopping with your sisters, I just needed you to keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn&#39;t hurt himself or break anything&quot; she giggled as Martin quickly responded, his mouth still full and flecks of food and spittle spilling out, &quot;Now Martha, I can take care of myself. You can take Jason shopping with you if you want.&quot; She shrugged it off, grabbing another handful of food to stuff her face, &quot;Oh I know dear, this is just to ease my own worries. Besides I think the two of you would keep each other company while me and the girls are gone.&quot; Martin huffed as Jason realized he had no say in the matter. Well, hopefully he could stand to be around one slob rather than a whole family of them. &quot;Alright. Well, me and Jason are still gonna have some fun around the house, won&#39;t we son?&quot; Jason still had no idea how to respond, so he just quietly nodded as his dad grinned, &quot;Thatta boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason sat through the meal, watching his family belch, fart, and noisily scarf down food. By the time it was finished, he hadn&#39;t eaten much himself, instead just handing his plate off to the rest of them and excusing himself back to his room, sickened by the display. Once he was inside, he placed the floor, still trying to get the image of their disgusting, fat faces out of his head and wondering about what had happened to them, or if there was any way to reverse this. He sighed, sitting on the bed, hoping this was just a nightmare, when he heard his mother yell, &quot;Jason, we&#39;re going!&quot;, followed by his father &quot;Come on down here and help out your old man!&quot;. He groaned, hesitantly leaving and going to see his father, hoping this wouldn&#39;t be as awful as he thought it&#39;d be.<br />
<br />
He returned to the kitchen to see the mess his family had made, still reeking of their stench and flatulence, and found the garage door was open, letting him hear the passing of more gas within. He cautiously walked through, seeing his father bent over the hood of a large van where he&#39;d normally park the family&#39;s honda. It occurred to him they probably wouldn&#39;t be able to fit inside it anymore at the size they now were. His father&#39;s disgustingly brown skid marked plumber&#39;s crack was on full display, blasting out farts like crazy, probably because of the large meal they&#39;d eaten. He seemed to be fiddling with the engine, briefly taking a hand out to scratch his exposed rear before returning to his work. The air in the garage was so vile it made Jason&#39;s eyes tear up. <br />
<br />
His father didn&#39;t notice him at first. Jason wondered if he should let him know, but before long Martin turned around, seeing Jason there, and his face lit up. &quot;Jason! How long have you been standing there?&quot; He grinned as Jason awkwardly chuckled. Martin got up from his position, wiping his grease-covered fingers on his shirt, &quot;Uh, a while... what are you doing?&quot; His father chuckled, &quot;Just a bit of tinkering, changing the oil and all that.&quot; Jason nodded. He knew his dad liked his car, so he figured this dad must too. Martin grabbed a toolbox off the table and went back over, &quot;So, you wanna help out eh?&quot; Jason nodded, a tad reluctantly. His father just beamed, &quot;Excellent! Come on over here, I&#39;ll give you the basics.&quot; He said, before releasing a thunderous belch.<br />
<br />
Jason&#39;s father excitedly explained about car engines and tools needed. He&#39;d ask Jason for supplies off his work bench and Jason would give them to him. It would&#39;ve been nice if not for the smell. When he first opened it, he found that his father&#39;s toolbox was full of snack bags in addition to equipment. Apparently his dad got hungry on job, a fact Jason found hard to believe after the breakfast he&#39;d eaten. He wouldn&#39;t even was his hands first as he tore open bags of junk food, sloppily consumed them, and let monumental burps and farts. His habit definitely wasn&#39;t helping the air quality in the room. Likewise his father seemed even sweatier and greasier than he was at breakfast, if that was possible. <br />
<br />
Soon his father was on his back, checking it&#39;s underside, his massive belly barely able to fit under the vehicle, while Jason was just exhausted. So far, while his dad definitely stunk, it was better than breakfast was this morning. Eventually his father pushed himself out from under the vehicle. Jason hoped it meant he could go back to his room, &quot;Everything okay dad?&quot; He asked, hopeful. His father seemed a bit pensive for a moment, &quot;Actually...&quot;</p>
