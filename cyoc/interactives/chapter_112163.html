<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric watched as Cindy, Jasper and Yogi rushed in to pool. When he as well as Jasper and Yogi left the male changing area they were waiting for the girls to put in an appearance. Cindy coming out wearing her bathing suit; she and her younger twin brothers raced to the pool’s edge, jumping into the fresh water pool with energetic glee. Moments later Spencer comes out wearing a simple green colored bikini. Smiling as it matched hers, Frieda’s and Eric’s vivid green eyes; grinning as she approaches Eric.<br />
“Wait until you see Frieda’s bikini,” Spencer swooning; “it’s enough to make that inner panther in you come out for a wild romp.”<br />
<br />
Smiling as she guides Eric to look on at the female changing room entrance; he sees Frieda sauntering out. Her smooth legs looking enchanting; his eyes trail up to her bikini bottom and he couldn’t help but smile. A solid white tight fitting bathing suit bottom that looks like its two sizes too small for the voluptuous were-panthress figure. But it being “European cut” and haute couture; Frieda was able to make it work as her hips swiveled and sway with each step. Eric instinctively purred as his eye traveled up Frieda’s beautiful tanned skinned. Her taught and toned stomach already inviting to be explored by his hands; it was her bikini top that sold the outfit. Like her bikini bottom it was a solid color; only black. Each cup barely containing the warm soft pillows Frieda is all too eager to let Eric play when in their fursonas; it was clear by Eric’s happy face and severe tenting in his swim trunks that he liked what he sees.<br />
“I knew it would be a hit,” Frieda placing a hand on Eric’s crotch; finding his arousal enticing.<br />
“If we weren’t minding children,” Eric growling; “I’d be bending you over and claiming you right here and now.”<br />
“That can come later,” Frieda smiling; “I’ll even let you disrobe either the top or the bottom. But only one,” Frieda purring; “Spencer also gets to disrobe a part of my bikini as well.”<br />
“Goodie,” Spencer happily growling as she licked her lips in anticipation.<br />
<br />
Their dirty talk was interrupted when moderately small splashes tickle them. Turning around to see Cindy along with Jasper and Yogi flinging water at the three; Eric grins as he launches himself into the pool; making a large splash that soaks both Spencer and Frieda. The two looking shocked as the cool water caused them to shiver. Growling in unison, as both launch themselves into the water and join in on the impromptu water fight.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
With Amanda Knight pulling up in her navy blue Tesla Sports car; a vehicle Frieda got for her for Christmas, thus prompting Benton to impose a spending limit of her daughter’s card. She looked around the neighborhood and huffed in dismay. Seeing split level duplexes everywhere; Amanda was worried she arrived at the wrong house. Seeing Ester opening the door to the house; Amanda groaned as she used her clicker to engage her car’s alarm.<br />
“This is where the baby shower is being held,” Amanda looking positively aghast.<br />
“Welcome to the carpenter residence Amanda,” Ester holding the door open.<br />
“This place can barely hold two people,” Amanda looking shocked; “how is it you, your husband and three children live comfortably here.”<br />
“I also use to live here,” Lila walking out from the kitchen to the front entrance; “Trust me Amanda, if it wasn’t for the basement, this house would have been wrecked with having three children sharing a room.”<br />
“We are looking to get a bigger place,” Ester looking at her pregnant sister in-law.<br />
“Sure,” Lila rolling her eyes as she munches on a fudge brownie; “now that I’ve moved out, you’ve suddenly realize this house is too small.”<br />
“With Cindy, Jasper and Yogi growing like weeds,” Ester answering; “Rick and I need to look for a bigger house.”<br />
“For crying out loud Ester,” Lila shaking her head; “I’m only teasing you.”<br />
“Is she always like this,” Amanda looking at Ester.<br />
“I married her brother,” Ester sighing; “so I also married into the sibling rivalry.”<br />
“It keeps you on your toes,” Lila cackling; “now let the war horse in Ester, that way we can get this baby shower going.”<br />
<br />
Amanda growls as Lila smirks at getting a dig at her. Entering the small household Amanda sees several people she is not familiar with. Apart from Ester who is the hostess of this gathering and Lila the guest of honor and carrying Lance’s first cub. Amanda is soon greeted by several of Lila’s former work friends at city hall. Surprised to see a large hulking man with tribal tattoos that look fresh; Amanda soon learns that his name is Marcus, the town’s Comptroller and Lila’s former boss and a wer-mer. The large Samoan is the only man at the small baby shower being held at the Carpenter household.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Back at the rec center Eric and Frieda were standing at the pool edge watching Spencer try at teach Jasper and Yogi how to do the breast stroke while Cindy was content to do cannon balls off the nearby diving boards.<br />
“Dam if this is good experience for when we become parents,” Eric smiling; “can you picture use spending quality time like this with our future cubs?”<br />
“I’m picturing it already,” Frieda purring; “Maggie-Martha and Bethany if I recall.”<br />
“You give birth to Bethany while Spencer gives birth to Maggie-Martha,” Eric smiles; “just ten years before that happens. Yet I have this feeling that our first batch of cubs,” Eric purring; “won’t be the last.”<br />
“Oh,” Frieda glancing at Eric; “you want a large family don’t you.”<br />
“Don’t you,” Eric watching Spencer laughing as she is splashed by Jasper and Yogi; “a house full of cubs, it make the inner panther in me purr proudly with my mates displaying swollen bellies full of my cubs.”<br />
“Careful,” Frieda looking at Eric and grinning; “Spencer and myself could both carry twins as destructive as the two in the pool. You want to risk that?”<br />
“If it means being with you and Spencer for centuries to come,” Eric smiling; “hell yeah, I’ll chance that.” <br />
<br />
<br />
“I’ll most likely be running Knight Industries or some aspect of it in ten years,” Frieda looking on in bliss; “what about you?”<br />
“You know how I’ve been making a little money tutoring after school a few days a week,” Eric placing an arm around Frieda; “I wouldn’t be surprised if I take up a profession similar to that of my parents.”<br />
“A teacher,” Frieda looking at Eric; “how so?”<br />
“Well,” Eric grinning; “believe it or not, if it wasn’t for me Nate would have repeated several grades. Spencer would of failed math and you would have gotten a D in history. You cannot deny,” Eric grinning; “that I have been an influence on you both. Plus I’m on the honor roll with my grades. But like I said,&quot; Eric grinning; &quot;its a possibility.&quot;<br />
“You looking to be the class valedictorian when we graduate,” Frieda chuckling.<br />
“Face it darling,” Eric looking at Frieda; “you’re dating a nerd.”<br />
“And you are one hot looking nerd at that,” Frieda grinning; “Any ideal what Spencer might do after high school?”<br />
“No clue to be honest,” Eric looking at the third member of their love triangle; “to be fair, Spencer has been busy helping her parents as they wait for the birth of their second child.”<br />
“Now that we know Spencer will have a brother,” Frieda glancing at Cindy joining her twin brothers; “you think he’ll be a hybrid like Spencer or a werewolf like his father?”<br />
“The question is,” Eric giving a devilish grin and pushing Frieda into the pool and the jumping after; “which one of us is going to reach Spencer first and pull her underwater by her legs.”<br />
“Oh you are so on,” Frieda laughing; not waiting as she starts swimming as fast as she can to get at Spencer first.</p>
