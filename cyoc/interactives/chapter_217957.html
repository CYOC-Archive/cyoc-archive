<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chuck had to piss. Damn this beer was running through him fast. “Brand, gotta take a leak, be right back.” “Its Brad yo, what the fuck?” Chuck didn’t really care, he kinda tipsily stumbled to the bathroom and whipped out his schlong. Just then, he felt a wave of something wash over him.<br />
<br />
Chuck looked down at his cut manhood. He kept his bush at a manageable length. Beneath it his 6 inch dick and egg sized balls hung free. Chuck didn’t understand why he was feeling like this but he hated what he was seeing. Fucking disgusting. Dicks were fine enough, in fact Chuck kinda wondered what Brads little man looked like. His dick was definitely wrong though. <br />
<br />
You know how a woman&#39;s pussy is nice and soft and full, not fucking dry? Fuck he was jealous. Right now, if Chuck looked down at his member, well it just wasn&#39;t that. Man, what the fuck? <br />
<br />
“Yo, you okay in there?” Chuck heard Brad yell from down the hall. He wasn’t, but still answered. “Gonna take a shit.” He locked the door.<br />
<br />
Chuck knew doctors sometimes turned men into women, and he was curious. Pulling out his phone, he googled “sex change man to woman”. The results were strange. Vaginoplasty? Bottom surgery? Some websites even had videos. It didn’t take long before he was convinced. A before and after photo was really what pushed Chuck over the edge. Before, a plump sausage and eggs hung into the field of view. After, that was all gone, v-shaped stitches flanked either side of a fresh new hole, above it a little pink nub. It looked so clean, it looked so right. That’s what Chuck was supposed to have.<br />
<br />
Instead, his dick looked weird. In fact, damn weird looking. Disgusting.<br />
<br />
Chuck leaned over the toilet seat letting his taint droop to the floor as he peed. Yup, definitely thinking about getting a sex change. Maybe Brad would like him, he knew Brad talked about all the tight pussy he was getting.<br />
<br />
More research disappointed him though. The average price was nearly a hundred thousand dollars, and the wait time nearly 3 years. Fuck. They also wanted him to live as a woman. Nah Chuck was a big man, and proud of it. The surgery didn’t look too hard? Maybe he could just do it right now on himself?<br />
<br />
Chuck scoured the medicine cabinet for supplies. Scissors, good, gauze, check. He even found a sewing kit,  made for fixing clothing Chad didn’t care, he was too drunk. Lucky him, he always had a condom in his pocket, he could do what the doctors did and stuff his soon to be new meat sock. He grabbed his lighter from his jacket pocket and got ready to get to work.<br />
<br />
Chuck pulled up a video for reference. Hmm, the first thing he needed to do was chop off his nuts. Using the scissors (as carefully as he could) he cut down the middle of his ball bag. Damn that stung, but he was drunk enough not to scream. His nuts hung mostly free now. Chuck tied two tight loops around either of his cords.  Once he was satisfied he clipped them together with one loop being an extension of the other. Now his ball sack hung in two halves between his legs, his two grey orbs suspended by threads. Chuck chuckled to himself. So weird, but strangely hot. He had never been more aroused. His boner was like a rock pointing straight up from his crotch.<br />
<br />
This was it, no going back. Chuck heated his scissors with his lighter until they glowed a deep red. He grabbed his exposed nuts and pulled them together. Snip, sizzle, plop. Chuck dropped his severed testicles into the toilet bowl beneath him.  <br />
<br />
Wasted sperm squirted into the water below him, with each drop his eyes grew wider. How amazing would it feel, his new snug moist vaginal lips wrapped around his best friend’s schlong? There was only one way to find out. Chuck flushed his male orbs down the drain and got to working on his dick.<br />
<br />
First up, he had to unskin his cock. Picking up his razor he drew out the thin line separating shaft from the fat ridge of his dickhead. Chuck shivered as the sharp blade skimmed across his skin. It hurt so good. With his own hand, he gingerly peeled the sheath back, revealing his naked, pink dick.  <br />
<br />
He held his manmeat against the sink and started cutting away down either side of his thick shaft. He had to tie off his erectile tissue, no more hardons for him.  What followed next seemed almost impossible to him. But he tried, he was going to make it happen.<br />
<br />
Cutting downward, along both sides, the blade slicing deep. Chuck watched as his the filets of engorged tissue separated from his manhood. Near the tie, far past where he thought the base of his penis ended, Chuck cut and burned through the rest of his erection. There it lay, sliced in half by his own hand, but attached to his body at the top. Two small pieces remained. <br />
<br />
Chuck fixed his eyes and marveled at his masterpiece in the making. Looking down, the remains of his tool hung in front of him, a thick empty tunnel of skin, a short pink pisstube, and his dickhead, now freely hanging by a thread of nerves and vessels from his pelvis.<br />
<br />
Not wasting much time, he had started to bleed faster, he sewed the end of his new vaginal canal shut, and turned the former dickskin inside out.  He cut cut a small hole above the new entrance. Deciding that he liked pissing from his head, he left the urethra attached and pushed it into its new home. A bit of super glue and makeshift sewing held his newly rearranged pleasure center to its new home.<br />
<br />
Chuck trimmed what was left of his scrotum and sewed down the flap of skin his dick had been attached to. He opened the condom and filled it with gauze. Bracing himself for the intrusion, he pushed his inverted cock into his pelvis. What a beautiful thing he had created! Pink and soft, perfect fit for Brad, he thought. As the tube expanded within his body, Chuck marveled at how strong his new inner lining would hold everything. <br />
<br />
With his new womanhood still bleeding yet well stuffed with medical supplies, he walked over to the bathroom mirror and stared into the glass. Still sore and stinging, Chuck examined the shape of his future. Yes, perfect.  He couldn’t wait to show Brad. This would be his dicks new form, there was nothing better. <br />
<br />
Only wearing a shit, Chuck stumbled out into the hallway. He was waning now from blood loss and drunkenness. The throbbing pain from the mangled remains of his manhood and his excitement to show off his work to Brad the only things keeping him awake. That was it, he collapsed on the floor, he had to sleep, to dream about being with Brad again. <br />
<br />
“What the fuck???!!” Brad yelled as he stepped out into the hallway.</p>
