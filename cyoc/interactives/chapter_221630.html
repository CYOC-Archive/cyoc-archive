<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You both lie together after the end of your rut, heavy panting booming in your lupine ears.  You feel your tie throbbing between the other&#39;s sex, still feeling your seed oozing and expelling into your bitch.  You are a little stunned at how much is coming out of you, that small ting of old worry that you could knock up your mate with more than enough pups by this point.<br />
<br />
No.  This is normal.  Wolves and canines bare this much seed.  You must to ensure success in your copulation.  In fact; there is something else you should be doing to better ensure, isn&#39;t there?<br />
<br />
You look around yourself and your shewolf in a wild daze, your thoughts getting harder to grasp as you feel more influenced by your primal instincts than your own wants.  So much of your personality seems to be slipping, threatening to vanish.  This must be happening to your mate as well.  But what you are loosing doesn&#39;t quite matter much at this point.  What matters is making sure you impregnate your bitch.  What matters is keeping all your essence inside.<br />
<br />
Your furry limbs moving on its own accord; you shift and lift your legs about turning around, facing away from your shewolf as you stand butt to butt; tail to tail.  The twisting pulls at your plump knotted loins, but you feel that you are in a better position now; a proper one.  This feels right.<br />
<br />
Being a wolf feels right.  Mating with your shewolf...giving her pups...starting your pack...hunting in the wild...mating...pack...hunt...<br />
<br />
You start to convulse and shake, your feral gaze staring entranced as your heavy pants turn into aggressive growls and whines.  Your furry body is suddenly flooded with a familiar heat that burns under your pelt, your bones aching as you start to feel them snap and crack like before.  But why?  You already have become a wolf, haven&#39;t you?  What more could be changing?<br />
<br />
No...not done.  Not all wolf.  Must be all wolf.  Be wolf.  Wolf.  Wo~oooolf.  Wo~ooo~wooo~oooolf...<br />
<br />
Sharp yelps climb both yours and your shewolf&#39;s throat, snapping your fangs spilling snarls against the brief pangs of pain.  You struggle to steal your sight back towards your mate, watching as she herself trembles and contorts to the same transforming influences of her changing body.  Her humanoid features that make her beastly figure start to fade; breasts flatten becoming just another pair of animal teats closer to her abdomen, handpaws wider and puffier while thumbs fully retract back into what were her wrists, her torso fully animal, and her legs and calves adjusting to match her feral frame.  The same adjusts shift and swell throughout your being as the last visage of your old human self is washed away.<br />
<br />
The two large paired wolves pant, beady glowing eyes lost within some form of trance until the hot sensation that morphed their beings ebbs and they can think clearly again.  Well...think clearly enough about their situation.  You turn again to see your lovely mate, your shewolf remaining flat on the floor recovering from the bout of heat that swept you both.  You pad over to her side pulling each other from the tie, nuzzling and licking her neck happy how she returns your affections.<br />
<br />
After some time passes; your tie softened and loose to pry apart, the two wolves start to explore and sniff about the room as if for the first time, neither one of you having any memory or inkling of why you are trapped in this wide yet stuffy enclosure.  Your shewolf calls you to where she stands, next to the cracked glass of the sliding door.  She seems to believe this is the way out as she lunges against the glass with all her might spreading the cracks.  You feel this might be dangerous but your urgency to be free is as strong as hers, aiding by matching the thrust of each other&#39;s leaps and bashes.  It thankfully takes less time and pain than foreseen as working in tandem quickly shatters the glass.<br />
<br />
Only a few scrapes are felt after that, shaking off the small shards littered upon your fur.  The cool aromatic smell of fresh air riles the both, tails wagging as you both hurry into the backyard and plant your paws upon the soft grassy earth for the first time, immediately feeling enraptured in the bliss of being nothing more than a wild wolf.  Your mate shares this excitement as she brushes past against you, her wagging tail fanning your snout leaving behind the musk of your past deed and lingering pheromones.<br />
<br />
Her heat has not left.  Her body gestures that she is ready to rut again.  Her beaming feral eyes looking back at you fuels that possibly.  Though this time; you will need to put a bit of work into claiming your bitch once more, the shewolf quickly darting from your anxious stride provoking carnal lust as she waves her furry rump and flags her wagging tail, giving you a eyeful of her swollen lupine sex.<br />
<br />
You relish the challenge as you chase after your mate, feral wolves barking and howling happily as they rush deep into the woodland, fulfilling their instincts as wolves of the wild.<br />
<br />

After some time has passed:<br />
<br />
News reports draw near the end of their cycle about the case of the most recent missing people in the last month.  Among the stories relate to a young woman who had disappeared from her own home in the middle of the night.  Police did find odd evidence of a potential break-in from wild animals due to find torn clothes and furniture from claw and bite marks along with what forensics claim to be wolf fur, saliva, and (reluctant to reveal to the public) spunk from mating.  Although; they are rather confused and terrified as some results claim such saliva and spunk has a small match to the missing woman in question.  But that couldn&#39;t be possible; right?  There must have been some tampering or cross-contamination with the evidence.<br />
<br />
However; this would potentially explain the second person they matched during their examination...you!  Your DNA appears in the evidence as well, though again cross-contaminated with wolf DNA.  It does; however, lead officials to check up on you for questioning...only to discover that the police of your hometown have already conducted a missing person&#39;s report on you too.  Your apartment was searched and ransacked further after discovering your DNA at the other scene, though again there such comes up empty...save for your computer history.  For all your safety and VPNing; you had left your computer on the night of the incident leading the investigators to discovering you little Animal TF fetish and fascinations.  However; they do not find any history on the shady website that started this whole affair.<br />
<br />
But...none of that really concerns you anymore.  You and the shewolf YOU created from that website wake up every morning under the rising dawn, nestled comfortably in your chosen den deep in the woodlands.  You both greet and nuzzle lovely as you step out into the morning stretching and yawning before gaining the zeal for a good run and morning hunt for breakfast.  You hear the tiny yelps and barks of your pups following behind huddling around their mother, a few around you of course, wishing to follow their parents and learn how to run and hunt like a proper wolf.<br />
<br />
This is your life.  This is THE life.  There isn&#39;t anything else you can possibly care or worry about anymore than protecting your pups and continue to grow your pack, and help teach your pups how to be wolves to start their own one day.  All there is now is the thrill and rapture of the hunt, the exploration and expanding of your territory, and the love of your mate and your pups.  And judging by the alluring perfume of your shewolf&#39;s returning heat, you would be expanding your pack much sooner than you realize.  Breakfast first; howling together before you all sprint off into the wild and live like the wolves you are now.<br />
<br />
Be Wolf.  Just Wolf.  Wolf.  WOLF.  WOLF!!!<br />
<br />
AWWWWRRROOOOoooooo!!!<br />
