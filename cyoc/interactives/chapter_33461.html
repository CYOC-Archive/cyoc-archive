<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once you reformed inside your room Alice looked around wide eyed and said &quot;Wow, I didn't think we could mist while the sun was up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as we aren't exposed to any daylight we can&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've heard that the council members and their families had really nice rooms but no one knew were they were&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now you know and I think you should keep it a secret&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Alice sits down on your bed and starts crying again. &quot;Danny always wanted to find out were these rooms were&quot; she bawled.<br />
<br />
You go over and sit down beside her. She throws her arms around you and cries into your shoulder. You put your arms around her and just hold her for awhile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just can't believe that he's gone&quot; Alice sobbed into your shoulder. &quot;I keep expecting to see him tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You may see what looks like Danny tonight but it won't be him&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know but that doesn't stop me feeling and hoping that he'll come in like nothing happened&quot; Alice said. &quot;I feel like it's my fault that he's dead. If I had asked more questions he would still be alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't know that&quot; you say. &quot;It's not your fault. Whoever is impersonating him had everyone believing they were Danny for three months.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you're right&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
Just then your phone starts ringing. &quot;Hello&quot; you say when you pick up the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello&quot; a voice that you know says at the other end, &quot;I was told I could reach my son at this number. Is he there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's sort of here&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; your mother asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's kind of hard to believe but I am your son&quot; you say, &quot;or I was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't play games with me young lady&quot; your mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not playing games with you Mom&quot; you say. &quot;I've been transformed into a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's impossible&quot; your mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It happened&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright if you want to play games I'll ask you a question only my son would know&quot; your mother said. &quot;What was the secret that my son told me when I remarried?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's easy&quot; you say, &quot;I told you that I thought I should have been born a girl. This is after you told me that I was adopted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he tell you that?&quot; your mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He didn't need to tell me because I am your son&quot; you say. &quot;I can tell you that Tonya used to dress me as a girl for quite awhile until you caught us one day. That's when I began thinking I should have been born a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe this&quot; your mother said. &quot;How did this happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah changed me&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;How could Sarah change you?&quot; your mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep an open mind about this one but Sarah is a vampire&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah can't be a vampire&quot; your mother said, &quot;she's able to walk around in the sunlight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are different types of vampires&quot; you say. &quot;The type of vampire that we are can go about in sunlight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What a minute&quot; your mother said, &quot;you said 'the type of vampire that we are'. What did you mean by that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Sarah turned me into a vampire&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you're a vampire now as well as a girl?&quot; your mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's right&quot; you say. You hear someone in the background.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I'll ask&quot; your mother said. &quot;Your sister and niece are here and would like to see you. Will you come over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't right now&quot; you say. &quot;I'll be out and about tonight so maybe I'll be able to stop by.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We do want to see you&quot; your mother said. &quot;What time do you think you could stop by?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; you say, &quot;it depends on when Sarah is going to take me hunting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to be hunting?&quot; your mother asks with a weary tone to her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would guess we will be hunting people&quot; you say. &quot;Before you say anything we don't kill people. We have a special enzyme that we secrete so the victim doesn't die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your step-father has told me that there have been some strange killings lately&quot; your mother said. &quot;The victims were found with puncture wounds on the neck. I don't think you're being told the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I believe Sarah and I'm convinced she's telling me the truth&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; your mother says, &quot;I'm just worried about you is all. Your step-father has been talking to some guy who claims to be a vampire hunter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's his name?&quot; you ask though you have an idea who it is already.<br />
<br />
&quot;He calls himself Alucard&quot; your mother said. &quot;He gives me the creeps.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do me a favor and don't tell Alucard that I'm a vampire&quot; you say. &quot;From what I heard yesterday he wants to eliminate all vampires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong with that?&quot; your mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a vampire now Mom&quot; you say, &quot;that means Alucard wants to kill me too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Surely if your type of vampire doesn't kill anyone he'll leave you alone&quot; your mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't count on that&quot; you say. &quot;One of our clan members was apparently staked by him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry to hear that&quot; your mother said.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's alright now&quot; you say. &quot;The only way we can die is to starve which takes three months.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What does staking you do then?&quot; your mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It puts us in a death like state&quot; you say. &quot;Other than that it doesn't do anything to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I need to go now&quot; your mother said. &quot;Before I do though I need to know something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I call you now?&quot; your mother asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah gave me the name Violet&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Violet&quot; your mother says, &quot;I hope that we'll see you tonight. Bye&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bye Mom&quot; you say and hang up.<br />
<br />
Alice looks at you and says &quot;You're lucky that your family cares about you. When I was turned my family didn't even try to find out what happened to me. When they did find out they wanted even less to do with me then they did before. I was glad that I had a new family that cared about me. Then last year Danny and I started seeing each other. I was a guy before I was turned and it took me a few days to get use to going out with a guy. I was so confused as to what I was<br />
feeling for Danny. I loved him but my mind rebelled at that even though I was use to being a girl by that time. Now Danny is dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice started crying again and you let her cry on your shoulder. You really feel sorry for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure that the one that killed Danny will be dealt with&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Slowly Alice stopped crying and said &quot;Thanks for letting me cry on your shoulder Violet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's no problem&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Just then the phone buzzed and you press the intercom button. &quot;Yes&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Brian&quot; Brian said. &quot;May I come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on in Brian&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Brian reforms in your room carrying some objects. &quot;Are you ready to learn to turn into objects?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; Brian said, &quot;let's get started. To transform you first need to acquire what you want to transform into. To do this you need to touch it and concentrate on it. After that you concentrate on transforming your body into what you've acquired. It's pretty much like misting except you have to acquire something before you can transform into it. Give it a try.&quot;<br />
<br />
You see that Brian brought a one piece swimsuit, an orange, a fork, a pen, a necklace, a ring, and a watch. Which one do you pick for your first transformation?</p>
