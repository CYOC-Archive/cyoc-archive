<i>(Bracketed italic text indicates internal thoughts)</i><br/>
<br/>
<i>Non-bracketed italic text indicates mental influences & suggestions.</i></div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The distance that Sam had put between the two of them had given Rick a momentary respite before their &#39;game&#39; ramped back up. It was during this brief window that Rick&#39;s mind wandered, the latex squeaks that came from his body rubbing against itself giving him the question that would guide his attention out of the brain fog placed on him:<br />
<br />
<i>(...was my body always this squeaky?)</i><br />
<br />
The feeling of euphoria that Rick had felt before was replaced with worry as he continued down this line of questioning: It didn&#39;t help that his erect precum-covered shaft made it hard to focus, its throbs occasionally throwing him off focus as it sent pulses of pleasure up his spine. <br />
<br />
<i>He needed to find Sam so that they could sort this out together.</i><br />
<br />
As he made the same left turn into the path that Sam went down, his eyes caught the swaying motion of a building&#39;s swing doors, with his fellow pitch black vixen nowhere in sight. <i>(He must&#39;ve gone in there)</i>, Rick pondered as he went down the same path, seeing nothing else that confirmed otherwise.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t question the fact that his eyesight had significantly improved, nor that he could see the sways of the dual swing doors before the lights came on, the continuously-dimming evening sky offering little light for any average person to view anything that far away without any extra sources of light.<br />
<br />
Entering the building, it became apparent to Rick that it was a communal shower building, with the various signs saying so making it painfully obvious. Due to the incoming rush of air from the outside, the subtle swings from each of the 4 sets of swing doors made it hard to tell whether Sam had gone into the male wing or the female wing. Extra time would&#39;ve been bought for Sam if Rick had gone into the male wing first, and he almost did so out of familiarity with male bathrooms.<br />
<br />
…until he picked up the scent of latex coming from the female wing of the building.<br />
<br />
The smell was faint, but the enhanced senses that came with being a latex fox made it noticeable to Rick. <i>(That has to be Sam)</i> he thought to himself, not wishing to ponder the alternative for much longer.<br />
<br />
Pushing on the swing doors in front of him, Rick called out to Sam in his newly-feminine voice as he entered the female wing of the building.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam? Are you there? I know because I can smell you for some reason…&quot; <br />
<br />
The faint scent of the other pitch black latex fox was growing stronger, though still only perceptible thanks to his heightened senses. As he followed the scent, Rick tried to look down onto the floor, noticing that his chest was now home to his new, perfectly-spherical latex D-cups, partially blocking his view of the floor beneath him: Despite their apparent size, he didn&#39;t feel any weight from them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, this doesn&#39;t feel right: Was my chest always this big & round?&quot; <br />
<br />
A light moan escaped from his lips as he cupped & rubbed his left breast with his left paw-hand, the slight squeaking sound coming from the friction between the two, as he lightly shivered from the pleasure felt. A flood of embarrassment came over Rick immediately thereafter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmph… And were they always this sensitive? Why does this all feel so good, yet so wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick stopped in front of a locker where the scent trail became muddled: It was difficult to tell where Sam had gone next. Aside from the drops of translucent black latex precum around the area, the only other thing of note was an opened envelope that was left on the floor. Rick held the envelope in his right hand, confused as to what was in it & the locker that it resided in to cause the trail to go cold. <br />
<br />
<br />
It was at that moment of confusion that Sam turned Rick around to face hir, before pinning him to the floor with hir body, with Rick&#39;s arms pinned at their wrists by Sam&#39;s own pair of arms.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sam! What&#39;s gotten into you!?&quot; The bewildered latex vulpine blurted out, confusion continuing to accumulate after the fact.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m winning our game, Sis~&quot; was all that the other twin said, before lunging in to kiss hir duplicate on the lips.<br />
<br />
The confusion turned to shock, with a myriad of questions forming in Rick&#39;s head as he tried to shift himself out of the kiss: <i>(How do I get out of this? What&#39;s that slippery feeling around my junk? Why&#39;s he kissing me? ...)</i><br />
<br />
<i>(... What does he want me to do to him? Why do his lips feel……nice? How can I make mine feel like that?)</i>, the questions shifted & slowed down as the lip gloss did its job, slowly chipping away at his insecurities while his lips increasingly became ever more sensitive. Rick&#39;s struggles died down quickly after that.<br />
<br />
The kiss lasted for a good few seconds before Sam broke it off, before showing the stick of lip gloss that shi held in hir right hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re both going to put this on, give each other the best kiss ever, and then we&#39;ll play with each other until the other one can&#39;t hold it in: First one to cum loses~&quot; Sam said in a sultry voice, putting on another layer of the lip gloss on hir lips. Shi pursed hir lips before puckering them on top of Rick, the full & even application of another coat of lip gloss shown to him, before Sam proceeded to place the lip gloss in Rick&#39;s right hand, both hands having been freed during Sam&#39;s second application of the lip gloss to hir lips.<br />
<br />
Despite the increasing pleasures that he felt, and the combination of both of their sexual auras fuelling the fire even more, a deep part of Rick&#39;s mind wanted to push Sam off of him & flee, to try and find his family so that they can help him calm Sam down.<br />
<br />
<i>Or… he could beat Sam at his own game and calm him down now. They can find everyone else later.~</i><br />
<br />
With the lip gloss in his right paw-hand, Rick <i>chose to put on the lip gloss</i>, mimicking Sam&#39;s previous actions as he thoroughly applied a thick layer of lip gloss onto his lips, before he pursed and subsequently puckered his own lips to give them the same even coating. The second application furthered the lip gloss&#39; effects on Rick, as he felt his lips becoming as full & plump as Sam&#39;s. The brain fog that Rick had momentarily kept back was now back on top of his rubbery mind, with any previous thoughts about escaping quickly dissolving away.<br />
<br />
The near-identical latex vixens stared into each other&#39;s eyes for what felt like hours, with each other lost in the momentary lull. Sam came in to seal the deal and kiss Rick a second time, deep moans escaping from both of their lips as the pleasure pulsed through their whole bodies. Fluids started leaking out from Rick&#39;s other orifices, as black latex milk trickled out from <b>hir</b> breasts, with a translucent black latex fluid leaking from hir pussy. In their drunken lusts, both of them started to frot with each other, their throbbing vulpine shafts rubbing against one another in a bid to get the other to climax first, their lips never breaking apart as they humped against one another.<br />
<br />
The grinds & frots against each other&#39;s well-lubricated shafts would prove to be ultimately fruitless however, as despite the minutes of increasingly exasperating attempts to make the other give up, neither wanted to give the other victory, their sanities barely hanging on by a thread as they tried to simultaneously keep their own loads in whilst coaxing each other&#39;s out. With the ceramic floor beneath them, they lied down on each other&#39;s side: Rick was the one that broke their kiss first, subsequently flipping hirself to meet face-to-dick with Sam&#39;s hard, slick junk. <br />
<br />
Sam was momentarily befuddled by the broken kiss, before shi felt the lips of hir fellow latex vixen wrap around hir erect shaft as Rick slowly sucked off Sam&#39;s dick. The lapse in pleasure that shi was replaced with a flood of it, prompting hir to moan loudly in response. Not wanting to be outdone, Sam wrapped hir tongue around hir counterpart&#39;s own leaking prick, before beginning to bob up and down the shaft, hir lips never leaving hir fellow vixen&#39;s prick for even a femtosecond: Deep guttural moans could be heard coming from Rick in response, muffled by the shaft that was in hir maw.<br />
<br />
The escalations only continued upwards from here on out: As Rick threw Sam&#39;s thong away and used one of hir paw-hands to start fingering Sam&#39;s female bits, Sam did the same & threw away Rick&#39;s thong before plunging two fingers into Rick&#39;s labia. Rick responded to it by using hir other hand to fondle Sam&#39;s plump balls, slowly dragging hir fingers across them as shi inserted hir other hand&#39;s fingers deeper into Sam&#39;s pussy: Sam did the same back to Rick, caressing them as sensually as shi could.<br />
<br />
All the while, their combined sexual auras had shifted into full throttle: Any thoughts that weren&#39;t about the pleasures of being a latex vixen, or the desire to spread this pleasure with anyone they meet, were quickly shoved into each other&#39;s balls, with the same applying for any memories that weren&#39;t about being a sexy latex herm fox. Deep-rooted desires of sex & pleasure were being instilled into them, with their former lives now resting entirely within their scrotums.<br />
<br />
It would only be a few more moments from then, as their resistance to each other&#39;s need to climax was thoroughly annihilated by their own auras.<br />
<br />
Their balls tensed simultaneously as they both came into each other&#39;s maw, the thick ropes of black latex cum spewing from their pricks quickly overflowing their mouths, despite their voluminous gulps of each other&#39;s seed. Streams of black latex milk flowed from their D-cups, as black-tinted streams of translucent latex fluids spewed forth from their pussies. Any thoughts & memories about being human were wiped from their minds, with only the implanted memories of their pack remaining in their place. In their drunken haze of lust, both of them didn&#39;t notice the inscriptions on their heart-shaped pendants were being warped, with their new names now taking the place of the former names. <br />
<br />
Their climaxes lasted for several mind-breaking minutes before their outputs even began to slow down, their gulps tapering off as they finished gushing their loads into each other&#39;s latex maws before dislodging themselves from each other&#39;s pricks soon thereafter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guess it&#39;s… <i>*pants*</i> … a tie, Sis~&quot; <i><b>Cece</b></i> said with a drawn pant & a wavering pause. A smile crept onto hir face as shi got up from the floor, extending a hand to help hir sister get up.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>*pants*</i> … Someday, one of us will break the draw~&quot; <i><b>Cici</b></i> responded in kind, accepting hir sister&#39;s offer and getting up from the floor. Looking around their immediate area, their sexual fluids had already pooled together into a latex sphere, with their stretched undergarments dissolved into the black orb.<br />
<br />
It would be some time before they exited the building, the stick of lip gloss in Cici&#39;s left paw-hand & three latex spheres in the rest of their arms. The two pitch black latex foxes kissed each other once more as they basked in the light breezes of the night, their lips still glossy & plump even after 2 more rounds of passionate sex that also ended in simultaneous climaxes for both additional rounds. <br />
<br />
They both couldn&#39;t wait to show what they found to their pack.</p>
