<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ricky Martinez was only passably Hispanic. <br />
<br />
His parents had moved to America  two generations ago, so the only heritage he really had was dark black hair and a complexion that made him look well-tanned. And while his well-formed cheek bones and strong chin ensured he was considered one of the most handsome men in high school, Ken’s recent adjustments to himself meant that Ricky was now only the second most handsome person.  Not that Ricky had any memories left of being first – the Chronivac had seen to that.<br />
<br />
So when Jess, the prettiest senior in high school, had called him up and told him she’d broken up with Ken, he’d been ecstatic. He had already taken Ken’s place on the varsity football team, and now he was taking his girl. Ricky had never really considered himself a jealous person, but he fucking hated Ken. The guy was obnoxious and perverse, with this strange possessiveness and entitlement that rubbed Ricky the wrong way. <br />
<br />
When Ken had lost his spot on the Varsity team, he’d acted like he’d deserved to be there. That he should be the star quarterback just because he was hot and athletic. That wasn’t how it worked. Ken had just gotten handsome over the summer, had clearly started working out, which was, like, good for him, you know? But he hadn’t put in the work to become the star quarterback like Ricky had.<br />
<br />
And Jess, well…<br />
<br />
She was just fucking hot. A real spitfire with a pleasant attitude and a flirtatious personality. Everyone wanted to bang her, she was literally perfect. And she was kinda geeky and had her own Tok Tik and streamed on Twatch, which meant even geeks simped for her.<br />
<br />
Ricky wasn’t a simp, but he did have a perverse need to take something of Ken’s away from him.<br />
<br />
“First day of the rest of your life,” Ricky thought to himself as he walked up Jess’s house.  This was it.  He was going to fuck this broad, and in a few years, maybe even marry her.  He knocked on the door, and stepped back as Mary-Anne, Jess’s mom, answered.<br />
<br />
“Oh!” Mary Anne’s brown eyes opened wide in delight, “Ricky! What are you doing here?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, hey Ma’am.” Ricky said, “Uh, Jess wanted me to come study with her?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, did she?” Mary Anne frowned. “Well, okay. We’re having dinner in an hour if you’d care to join us?”<br />
<br />
“I’d love to,” Ricky said, giving her his best smile. Already invited to dinner? Score~<br />
<br />
He stepped into the foyer and kicked off his shoes. Her parents didn’t like people tracking dirt into their house. Ricky wasn’t sure how he knew that… oh, right, he’d come here in the fifth grade to work on the science fair project together.<br />
<br />
“Jess!” Her mom called up the stairs, “Your friend Ricky is here!”<br />
<br />
“Out in a minute, mom!” Ricky heard Jess shout. <br />
<br />
He stared up the stairs.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, she must be in the bathroom. I heard the shower a couple of minutes ago,” Mary Anne said, patting Ricky’s arm reassuringly.<br />
<br />
“It’s alright, ma’am.” Ricky replied.<br />
<br />
He settled next to the door, watching TV. Ten minutes later, he heard the door open and Jess walked down the stairs.<br />
<br />
Ricky smiled, “Hey Jess!”<br />
<br />
“Hey Ricky,” Jess batted her eyelashes and flicked her long blonde hair out of her eyes. “Oh, I forgot to braid my hair.”<br />
<br />
“That’s okay,” RIcky glanced around nervously, “So, uh, you said you wanted to study?”<br />
<br />
 “Yeah” Jess winked, ”I need a study buddy, come on up!”<br />
<br />
Ricky grinned back and followed her up the stairs.<br />
<br />
“Alright,” Jess said as she walked down the hall past her bedroom, “Let’s study in my spare bedroom.”<br />
<br />
“Not yours?” Rick’s voice came from the hall.<br />
<br />
“Oh, it’s dirty. I don’t want you to see that.” Jess giggled playfully.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” Ricky smiled.<br />
<br />
The spare room was more study than bedroom, with a large desk flanked by bookcases.  It almost looked like Jess’s dad used it as a home office.  The rest of the room was covered in blue carpet and green wallpaper. Tacky, but also very Feng Shui, Ricky thought. <br />
<br />
Jess took a seat on top of the desk, moving a laptop out of the way. Ken moved around, looking at the various things lining the shelves - mostly old books - while Jess pulled out her phone and texted someone.<br />
<br />
“So… what’s up?” Ricky asked, leaning against a shelf and trying to act casual.<br />
<br />
All he had to do was play his cards right and he was sure to score. Why else would she call him over? Ricky let a smile cross his face. Girls loved it when he smiled.<br />
<br />
Jess looked up from her phone.<br />
<br />
“I broke up with Ken,” Jess replied, almost matter-of-factly.<br />
<br />
Ricky frowned. “You don’t seem to upset over it.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, well, you know. I only date the best.” Jess said.<br />
<br />
“And I’m the best?”<br />
<br />
“You’re the quarterback, aren’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Is that all that matters?” Ricky asked.<br />
<br />
“No, but I think some corrections need to be made.” Jess said seriously. “I’ve got a reputation to maintain.”<br />
<br />
“So this isn’t because you like me, but because of your reputation?” Ricky’s frown deepened. “Do you even like me?”<br />
<br />
“Do you like me?” Jess asked, flipping her hair, “or are you just here for my pussy?”<br />
<br />
Ricky swallowed. “Well…”<br />
<br />
“Don’t feel bad, Ricky.” Jess smiled, “I know what guys like. I have a Twatch account. This isn’t about love or even sex. This is about power couples.”<br />
<br />
“Wow, that’s cold, Jess.”<br />
<br />
“The world is cold,” Jess replied. “I just live in it.”<br />
<br />
Ricky considered leaving, but she was really hot. And what she was saying made sense. If they wanted to stay popular, they had to make compromises. Honestly, he had come over for a taste of that pussy. But the way she was talking…<br />
<br />
“There’s more, isn’t there?” Ricky stated.<br />
<br />
Jess looked down to her feet, dropping her voice to a more somber tone, “he gets angry and…”<br />
<br />
“Does he hurt you?” Ricky rushed over to her, checking her for bruises.<br />
<br />
“He-” Jess started to say.<br />
<br />
There was a beep from Jess’s phone. <br />
<br />
She glanced at it, smiled, then looked back up at Ricky.<br />
<br />
“It’s okay, Jess,” Ricky said, rubbing his nose, which felt cool and strangely wet, “I won’t let anyone hurt you.”<br />
<br />
“Ricky,” Jess breathed, running her hands over his muscular form.<br />
<br />
Ricky leaned in and smelled her hair, that lovely perfume she wore and… he sniffed deeper, his cock stiffening in his pants. It was a low smell, slightly musky yet also floral.  He found himself snuffling her, head dipping past her heaving breasts, barely contained in the tight shirt she was wearing. Down, down he went, past her midriff, until…<br />
<br />
His nose pressed against the zipper flap of her short jeans. Ricky’s heart was beating a mile a minute. His whole body felt oddly hot. Jess spread her legs more, leaning back on the desk.<br />
<br />
“So,” Jess said.<br />
<br />
Ricky glanced up at her. <br />
<br />
She fluttered her long lashes at him. “What do you say to warming me up?”<br />
<br />
Ricky huffed more of her lovely scent, nosing deeper into her crotch. Jess giggled, her hand petting the top of Ricky’s head, then slowly unbuttoned and unzipped her shorts. She slid them down her legs before kicking them away. Ricky’s nose twitched.<br />
<br />
Jess wasn’t wearing panties.<br />
<br />
Her shaved pubic mound was inches away from his face. Ricky could see her tight netherlips, curling and glistening wetly on the edges of her folds. He could smell her need. He let his tongue droop from his mouth and panted, breath hot. Ricky didn’t notice his tongue lengthen past his chin, flecks of saliva dripping from it onto the floor.<br />
<br />
He needed her, Ricky realized.<br />
<br />
His clothes were itchy, making him squirm uncomfortably and the room began to feel hot and stuffy, like someone had really cranked up the heat. But his nose kept sniffing and he could smell her feminine perfume wafting from her slit. All he wanted to do was…<br />
<br />
Jess gently pressed his face into her cunt.<br />
<br />
Ricky’s tongue lapped at her pussy, savoring her flavors. <br />
<br />
As he did, he scratched himself, not noticing his clothes unravel beneath fingernails that were hardening and sharpening into black claws. She moaned as he snuffled and licked, tongue slipping through her folds and gently squeezed as Jess’s insides clenched.<br />
<br />
He was so hot and itchy but she tasted and smelled so good! Fur began to blossom all over his body, while his hands began to shrink down and grow thick, stiff pads. Ricky nosed himself deeper, his head feeling weird, like it was stretching and contracting at the same time. Jess gasped, scratching his head, scritching his ears as they seemed to pull up to the top of his head and fold.<br />
<br />
Ricky’s jaw ached as it creaked forward, his tongue lapping deeper into Jess’s passage. She wheezed as his cold nose went deeper inside of her, nudging her clit. <br />
<br />
“Mmph! Ricky!” Jess gasped, her thighs squeezing his head involuntarily.<br />
<br />
Ricky let out a strangely inhuman whine as she shoved him deeper into her feminine crevice. His back kinda hurt, and when he sat down on the floor, it popped in a strangely satisfying way. Muscles started moving in his rump that shouldn’t have been there, accompanied by a rhythmic thump as he felt something hit the floor.<br />
<br />
He tried to reach behind him and check what it was, but his arms wouldn’t bend that way. Even his fingers barely wriggled. Before he could question how oddly stiff his joints were feeling, Jess’s thigh flexed, forcing him ever deeper. His tongue lapped her insides lovingly, enjoying her juices.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Ah!” Jess’s face was screwed up in ecstacy. She stuffed a hand into her mouth to muffle her increasingly louder moans. “R-ricky! Oh!”<br />
<br />
Ricky felt his ears twitch, then swivel forward at the sound of his name. His nostrils flared as the smell of Jess’s need increased and he huffed her welling musk happily, the thumping sound behind him increasing in tempo. He could taste her as the muscles in her cunt slid against his tongue. She was getting slicker, and not just from his slobber. Ricky slurped, lapping up more and more of her sweet, floral cum, the fur on his growing muzzle matted with it.<br />
<br />
“Ricky, I-” Jess gasped as the dog nosed and licked her insides, tongue furling and brushing her clit, “Oh! Oh god!”<br />
<br />
Jess’s thighs gripped Ricky’s increasingly canine head, her hand clenching a fistful of the dense hair on the top of his head, hair that was growing shorter, more even with the rest of the fur around it. Her pussy spasmed and clenched and fluids squirted from Jess’s insides, coating the dog’s face with it.<br />
<br />
She shook for a few moments before going limp. <br />
<br />
Ricky slid back to the floor, sitting on his haunches, his tongue licking around his snout. He noticed everything around him was colored all wrong. It was like he was watching a blurry black and white film with a smattering of blues and yellows. The dog shook his head, the motion translating to the rest of his body, fur waving to and fro, and then he sat back down, panting happily.<br />
<br />
There was something wrong, the world was supposed to have more color too it.  He looked at Jess’s straw-colored hair – he remembered it being so much more vivid.  But the more he tried to search his memory for the old color, the less memories he found that he had, and Jess’s hair was that same dull color in every one of them. <br />
<br />
And it wasn’t just his memories of Jess that were changing. He tried thinking back to the color of the football…<br />
<br />
The what? He remembered a game that he used to play, but no matter how much he tried to think about it, nothing came to mind.  It was like having a word on the tip of his tongue.  He knew what he wanted to remember, but he couldn’t remember it. <br />
<br />
Ricky looked around the room, trying to remember where he even was, only to find that everything around him seemed to be in a state of flux.  The desk rose up next to him and a small food bowl popped into existence in the corner. <br />
<br />
Ricky let out a soft whine. Everything was changing.  He vaguely remembered being someone, but with each second that person, and their memories, seemed to grow more distant. The world around him grew less and less familiar, and his mind grew more and more confused.<br />
<br />
Soft cracks and pops came from his body as he shrank, his proportion altering and shifting. He got smaller and smaller, and then suddenly he was in the dark. Ricky was trapped in some kind of small room with holes in the walls that let a little bit of light and air in.<br />
<br />
The floor vibrated as someone big and heavy walked into the room.<br />
<br />
“Hey babe,” Jess said.<br />
<br />
“Hey Jess,” Ken’s voice was clear enough, even muffled by the cardboard box Ricky was trapped in.<br />
<br />
Ricky cocked his head, his little heart racing. Ken?! He whined softly. <br />
<br />
The sounds of Ken’s voice caused forgotten memories to come rushing back to the surface. Ken was here, but Jess was HIS girl now! Who the hell did Ken think he was?<br />
<br />
“So did you do it?” Jess asked.<br />
<br />
“You don’t remember?”<br />
<br />
“Remember what?”<br />
<br />
Ken laughed, “Nothing babe, nevermind. I got you something.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, you did?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, look over there on the floor.”<br />
<br />
Footsteps approached Ricky’s hiding spot.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the top of the box lifted, and Jess’s beautiful face pered inside. As soon as she saw Ricky, she squealed in delight.<br />
<br />
“Oh, he’ so cute!” Jess held a hand to her mouth, then kissed Ken on the cheek. “Thanks babe!”<br />
<br />
“Anything for my sweetheart,” Ken winked.<br />
<br />
Ken bent down to pick the puppy up. Ricky cringed away from his hand, whimpering. His rival just laughed and his hands encircled the little dog. Ricky’s tail shot between his legs, covering his genitals and belly as he whined and yipped in fear.<br />
<br />
“You’re scaring him!” Jess said, “Let me hold him.”<br />
<br />
Ken glanced at the terrified pup and shrugged before handing it over to Jess. Ricky calmed instantly. She pet his head and whispered soothing baby words into Ricky’s ears. Everything was so confusing. <br />
<br />
Puppies didn’t have much brainpower. And the more Jess pet him, the more those resurfaced memories faded back into oblivion. Ricky made on last attempt to remember himself, to remember Ken, to remember Jess.  But his puppy brain simply couldn’t process the information that he was trying to pump through it.<br />
<br />
It was all so tiring that even yesterday was becoming a fading blur of nonsense that was blurring away into the void. What even was school? Anytime he managed to drudge up an old memory, he found that is simply made no sense and his brain automatically discarded it.<br />
<br />
Ricky fell asleep, cradled in Jess’s arms as she coo’d at him.</p>
