<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ohh yeah...I gues that Jason HAS been niiiiiiiiiiiiice- oh yeah, that's good babe....I wiiiish, oh....that Jason's dick was UUGH, as big as mine&quot; moaned Ty, as he was getting the most incredible head job from two of his female class mates.  Jason gasped as he pulled his dick out of the girl that he was fucking.  His dick was just 7&quot; long, a respectable size, but it started to grow and lengthen, growing to 12&quot; long, thicker than a beer can, and his nuts swelled up to the size of melons.  He also became consumed with lust, because of all the testosterone and cum that his nuts were now producing.<br />
<br />
Ty grinned at his &quot;apprentice&quot; and turned his attention back to the two girls.  One was a blonde, and the other was a brunette.  He stood up from his chair, and leaned the brunette over a desk.  He placed his dick at the entrence of her pussy.  He turned to the blonde and said &quot;What are you waiting for, get to work on my nuts!&quot; and turned back to the brunette, as he felt his pants getting pulled down, and her hand shot up his boxers to fondle and play with his nuts.  Ty started thrusting into the brunette with wild abandon, pounding away at her with little concern.  As he thrusted away, he could feel the blonde struggling to keep working on his huge balls.  Ty felt his balls pulled out of his boxers, and the blonde began to lick his nuts all over.  <br />
<br />
This new feeling sent Ty into a world of new pleasure, as he felt his nuts being licked and sucked.  Ty resumed his fucking of the Brunette until he felt his nuts not being sucked on anymore.  The blonde appeared infront of him, and began to make out with him.  Ty was very aroused, even though he could taste the sweat of his balls in her mouth.  As Ty was drawing close to orgasm, he felt hands grope his nuts.  He was too caught up pleasing the two women to care who was fondling his nuts, he didn't care because it felt good.  Suddenly the hands left his balls, went to the rim of his boxers, and his boxers were torn off of him.  Ty broke off his kiss to see who was doing that, and was shocked to see that it was Jason.  <br />
<br />
Jason had blown his load into countless people in the class, and he had just finished with someone when he saw Ty.  He was so filled with lust that he didn't care what he screwed.  Ty didn't even get to make a move before Jason aimed his huge cock at the enterence of Ty's ass, and thrust in.  Ty's world of pleasure was shattered as the huge organ travelled deep into his body.  Ty let loose a scream, and was about to stop him with a wish when he suddenly couldn't.  Ty tried to wish him to stop, but he just COULDN'T make that wish.  Then he realized that his wish earlier was that whoever someone wanted to fuck, HAD to fuck them back.  Ty groaned in pain as he felt Jason humping away, but Jason's thrusting was making Ty resume his thrusting into the brunette.  Ty was in a world of pleasure and pain.  &quot;Uugh, I wish Jason could fit in me!&quot; moaned Ty, and then he felt something.  His gigantic cock and nuts detatched from his body, and hit the ground with a huge, wet, sick THUD, and in their place a vagina grew.  Jason pulled out of Ty's ass, and then thrust into Ty's pussy, both pleasing Ty, and hurting him terribly again as Ty looked down in horror as he saw his huge equipment laying on the floor, someone else grabbed it, and and attached it to their body.  Before Ty could see who had stolen his dick and balls, Jason whirled Ty around, and shoved his huge cock down Ty's throat.</p>
