<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p><i>AN: I copy/pasted a chapter I had already written into this story with a couple words changed and one or two sentences deleted. I hope you enjoy reading it.</i></p>
<p>Rick, or more precisely Alison, listened to the story with a sad heart. He/she knew that the witches had been crazy but he/she didn't think they would put children at risk. Then again Kurse had sent children to capture the Alpha Female of the Big Bad Wolf Pack. He/she shook his/her head wondering if any of the children had been killed.</p>
<p>"Did they save the children?" one of the wolf pups sitting with a mutated wolf asked.</p>
<p>Before the wolf pup who was telling the story could answer a wolf pup wearing a dress that reminded Rick/Alison of Alice from <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> and <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> looked his/her way and said, "It seems we have another in our world."</p>
<p>The others looked around and Rick/Alison recognized Eliza as she said, "Hello child. What's your name and how did you get here?"</p>
<p>Rick/Alison looked up and said, "Well you do know me Eliza though I look different now than how you have seen me. You know me as Rick but my name is really Alison. As to how I entered the mirrorverse I used a little magic."</p>
<p>"You can't be Rick," Eliza said shaking her head. "Rick is a grown man and you are a little girl."</p>
<p>Rick/Alison looked at the wolf pup who had been telling the story and said, "Sorry for interrupting your story. I was in Glendale a few weeks ago and was cursed."</p>
<p>"How were you cursed?" the mutant wolf asked.</p>
<p>"And why did you come here?" Eliza asked.</p>
<p>"Fortunately it's a short story so if you'll indulge me I'll tell it," Rick/Alison said. Looking at the wolf pup who had been telling the story he/she said,"Though my story isn't as interesting as the one you've been telling. It's Marie right?"</p>
<p>Marie nodded and said, "You know I thought I had made sure these interruptions had been taken care of."</p>
<p>"So that's the magic I sensed you using," Eliza said nodding. "Why would you alter people's perceptions like this?"</p>
<p>"Because I don't want people to worry and possibly use the curse to transform someone to come look for us," Marie said. "I'd never be able to finish the story if we keep getting interrupted."</p>
<p>"I see," Eliza said sighing. "You'd best cast that on Rick or Alison so no one looks for him, I mean her."</p>
<p>Marie nodded and made a few hand gestures and after introductions Rick/Alison told his/her story.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>A few moments ago back on the yacht Rick was walking away from Eliza and Marie's cabin with Maylene and Dennis. He knew he had heard Eliza scream and didn't believe that Marie had taken Eliza on a tour of the mirrorverse. However new memories were starting to force themselves into his mind of Eliza being a glass woman able to enter the mirrorverse herself and she was indestructible like Marie. Neither of the two memories would explain why she had screamed. The only plausible explanation was that Eliza had been turned to glass. He had to wonder if it was payment for his trying to ask himself the curse. If it was he had to apologize to her before her memories started to shift. He turned to Maylene and said, "Maylene, I need to do something. You and Dennis go back to your cabin."
<p>Maylene smiled at him and asked, "Does it have something to do with our wedding?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps," Rick said smiling back at Maylene. He hoped that she didn't see that he was lying.</p>
<p>"Alright," Maylene said and kissed him. "If you see Eliza and Marie tell them that I want to ask them something."</p>
<p>"I will," Rick said and then watched Maylene and Dennis walk down the corridor. As he turned around and headed back to Eliza and Marie's cabin he felt new memories assert themselves again. He, Maylene, and Dennis had gone there so Maylene could ask Eliza to be her Maid of Honor and Marie to be a flower girl.</p>
<p>Rick entered Eliza and Marie's cabin looking around with a sigh. He closed and locked the door then went to the mirror. Looking into it he said, "Sorry Mommy. I know you told me not to use the Infinite Chaos without a familiar but I think I need to this time." He remembered the last time he had seen his mother.</p>
<p>It few weeks before the cruise and a woman and little girl had just arrived in Glendale. The woman looked around and said, "This place is steeped in magic. If there's anyplace that you'll find a familiar it should be here. Now remember Alison that until you find your familiar you shouldn't use the Infinite Chaos."</p>
<p>"I remember Mommy," Alison said looking up at her mother.</p>
<p>They walked through the bus station and collected their bags. Alison's mother had brought her daughter to this city in part to find a familiar for her and to continue her training as a witch. They would probably end up moving here as soon as they could get at least an apartment.</p>
<p>While Alison's mother was on the phone to get a cab a man came up and said, "Hey little girl I have a question for you. Transform or Dare?"</p>
<p>Alison's mother had started to turn around to the but when he had asked the question she turned back to getting the cab. As for Alison she looked at the man and asked, "What?"</p>
<p>The man didn't say anything for a minute then said, "Well you get both since you didn't pick one or the other within a minute. Now let's see for your transform you will become a thirty-six year old man. When reality alters you will always remember the previous reality as well as the new reality. None of your family or friends will remember you as you are now." The man smiled which sent a chill down Alison's spine. "Now for your dare," the man said still smiling. "I dare you to leave Glendale and never come back and to forget that you were ever a little girl until you have sex as a female." He laughed and said, "Good luck having sex as a female when you're male."</p>
<p>Alison's dress, shoes, socks, and panties disappeared leaving her naked. She covered up her genitals as they started rearranging. Her clit grew out into a tiny dick and the lips sagged forming a ball sack. Her ovaries moved into her ball sack and change into balls. Her slit closed up and her new genitals moved forward a bit. Her brown hair shortened going from the middle of her back to a short boy's cut. Her earring holes grew shut and her transformation into a boy was complete. Her transformation didn't stop however as she started to age. Around thirteen she began to grow some hair on her legs and crotch. This hair kept growing thicker as she aged and appeared around her nipples. This too grew thicker and that hair and more hair appeared between her chest and crotch. Her shoulders broadened as she aged and eventually a little stubble appeared on her face. She had now stopped aging and briefs, socks, shoes, pants, and a tee shirt appeared on her new body.</p>
<p>The man walked away as Alison's mother hung up the phone and turned right into Alison. "I'm sorry," she said looking up into what had been her daughter's face.</p>
<p>"That's alright," Alison said smiling down at what was her mother.</p>
<p>"I'm Melissa," Alison's mother said.</p>
<p>"I'm Rick," Alison said.</p>
<p>"Do you live here?" Melissa asked.</p>
<p>"No I was just visiting," Rick said. "My bus is leaving in a few minutes so I need to be going."</p>
<p>"Alright it was nice to meet you Rick," Melissa said.</p>
<p>"It was nice meeting you too Melissa," Rick said with a smile. "Maybe we'll meet each other again."</p>
<p>"Maybe," Melissa said.</p>
<p>Rick shed a few tears as he remembered that time. His mother, friends, and childhood had been stolen from him by that man. He had tried to deny that the memories were real thinking they had to be a side effect of Kurse twisting their very souls. But now he knows that they're real which is why he wanted to be a little girl now. He placed his hands on the mirror and closed his eyes drawing on the Infinite Chaos to shift his soul into the mirrorverse.</p>
<p>Rick felt himself move forward and opened his eyes. He knew he was in the mirrorverse now and he looked around. It looked nice and he knew he wouldn't mind spending some time here exploring. He looked down at himself and saw that he was wearing a white dress that looked like it could have come from the nineteenth century. He reached behind himself and felt longer hair. Smiling he said, "Well at least I can be a girl in here. I should ask Marie to help me change my physical body back so I can have my childhood back." He looked down and frowned then said, "But even if we do manage to change me back Mommy won't remember me so I'll have no family." He would have stayed there for a long time but he remembered what he came for. He needed to find Eliza before the Infinite Order decided to keep him within the mirrorverse forever. He reached out his senses and found Eliza's magic trail. Following it he took three steps and found himself looking at a group of Lupman and one human.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>"What's the Infinite Order?" Maddex asked?</p>
<p>"It's what balances the Infinite Chaos," Rick/Alison said with a sigh.</p>
<p>"Did the witches know about the Infinite Order?" Alice asked.</p>
<p>"They didn't know about it," Marie said shaking her head.</p>
<p>"How does the Infinite Order balance things?" Maddex asked thinking a bit. "If you had a daughter then were changed into a little girl would your daughter's existence be pushed forward in time?"</p>
<p>"Well that would make sense," Rick/Alison said nodding. Turning to Marie she said, "I take it you already told them something like that?"</p>
<p>Marie nodded and said, "I did. If you're going to stay and listen to the story I should give you a brief version of what I told everyone else so far."</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to interrupt your story," Rick/Alison said.</p>
<p>"I've gotten used to it," Marie said sighing. She then told Rick/Alison the brief highlights of what she has told so far. After she said, "Now maybe I can get this story finished without any more interruptions."</p></p>
