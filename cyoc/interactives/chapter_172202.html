<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kenny and Kelly both lowered themselves into the crystal clear pool which would transform themselves into merpeople. Both of them had stripped off their cloths going in totally in the nude. According to Liz and Amanda that would give them freedom to decide what type of merperson they would be. They didn’t full understand that. Amanda said she had controlled some things, mostly the color of her tail thanks to her swimsuit which she wore when she transformed but wasn’t sure if it would be harder in the nude. Either way both Kenny and Kelly where risk takers as they got into the pool and began to soak. <br />
Like before they each had their heads above water with the water stopping around their chest line, aside from their backs touching the side<br />
“Oh…this feels so good.” Said Kelly as she let the water soak into every little part of her body, beside her Kenny let out a low moan as well as the water felt so good. As they enjoyed the soak their bodies began to change, all the hair minus their eyebrows and the hair on top of their heads disappeared, even the hair on Kenny’s arms, legs and chest totally disappeared. Every scar disappeared as well; old injuries healed as well. Kenny had a bad shoulder from farm work when he was a kid and within the hour that old injury was totally healed. <br />
The two of them where enjoying the soak before Kelly brought her hand down to her boyfriend’s manhood and began to give him a hand job as she leaned in toward his ear. <br />
“One last round before we become sea creatures?” inquired Kelly<br />
“Do you have to ask?” joked Kenny as he pulled her into a kiss and on top of him as she began to straddle him and ride him, even with her on top of him somehow the magic of the pool didn’t force him down to touch the bottom of the pool. Both of them began to moan in pleasure as they just climbed higher and higher beyond the point where they would normally climaxed. It was amazing and when they both reached their climaxed it was mind blowing and Kelly rested on Kenny’s chest. As she did both of them started to sink until Kenny’s back touched the bottom of the pool and both of them where now underwater. <br />
During their climaxed a small amount of blood entered the water as new sets of gills opened up around their rib cage. Kenny had dark red and black scales around his gills while Kelly had a bright yellow and a marron color scales around her girls. Both of them where underwater and breathing fine.<br />
“I am going to miss this.” Said Kenny breathlessly as one of his hands rested on the small of her back while the other rested on the back of her head. He was still within her and both basked in the afterglow of what was possibly the best sex they had ever had. Already membranes where forming between each of their fingers making them webbed, dark red for Kenny and yellow for Kelly as the transformation entered the final stages.<br />
“Why would you miss this?” inquired Kelly confused. <br />
“Well it will be hard for you to ride me like that or the other way when we have tails and no legs.” Explained Kenny with a grin as Kelly grinned back. <br />
“Well I think we can think of other positions to try.” Stated Kelly as she playfully bite her boyfriend’s lip. Both of them where basking in the afterglow as scales began to form on their lower bodies. Their feet extended as well, a foot or so longer for Kelly and about 18 inches for Kenny. They both looked down and watched as dark red and black scales began to form around Kenny’s legs, there was no clear pattern to the mixture of red and black only with more red near his waist and black at the end of the tail. In addition, two small pelvic fins about where his calf muscles. His feet also turned vertically when forming his tail to be more like a shark meaning he would have to swing his tail side to side like a shark instead of up and down like a classic merperson, but both of them had seen merpeople like that when they came here.<br />
“I was just thinking how cool it would be to be like a shark.” Admitted Kenny as Kelly smiled and watched her own change. Her scales where a bright yellow and maroon which went really well with her chocolate skin tone, however unlike Kenny whom scales looked almost random her tail was mostly yellow with maroon tiger strips. She was so focused on that that it she didn’t notice at first that material was forming around her chest only when she felt her breasts lift up did she turned her attention to her still human torso. A strapless maroon corset had magically appeared on her, it had open sides for her gills but it besides that it looked identical to one of her favorites pieces of lingerie.  <br />
 “Wow this things makes cloths too.” Said Kelly as she looked at the top and smiled, a smile which grew even more as Kenny kissed her neck.<br />
“And I can’t wait to take that off of you.” Answered Kenny as he bite at the shoe strings which ran up the front of the corset, they were hardened sea weed but he didn’t care. Kelly was into it as she was ready to find a way to ride her new merman but before anything more could happen a voice yelled out.<br />
“You two are done now…time to get out we have others waiting!” yelled Amanda’s voice from nearby pool. Both of them lifted their heads out of the water only to find out who was going to be next.</p>
