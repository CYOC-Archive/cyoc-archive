<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Another!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gabriel Fletch was an amalgam of both Alan Page and Liam Barnes. His memories were forged based on his personality traits gained from both of his donors, creating a faux bank of knowledge that explained the skills he now had. But his will was, in essence, and using the term that Keith had described as playing a video game and having Vincenzo Fontana as his character, equal parts the jock and the nerd.<br />
<br />
It was as if Alan and Liam sat on a couch and passed the controller to each other whenever a situation was best suited to be handled by a counterpart. Both parts of his will were mutually in synchronization, in complete harmony. <br />
<br />
Liam had his fun already, acting like a total douchebag jock in the initial stages of his conceiving since he was dominant and confident. But once the high had passed and Gabe began thinking, the controller was passed over to Alan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if I want to stay as me for a while longer, I need to convince Keith that Liam isn&#39;t removing Alan from the equation.&quot; He sits up, seeing the mess on the mirror and his chest. It would be something Liam does, showing his masculinity by being covered in his virile cum. Gabe sighs as he stands up to clean the mess, using the towel on the floor to wipe things clean. The water bottle on the desk provided enough water to clear the sticky seed, and soon he was done with the cleaning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, first steps are done, but I still have cum musk sticking to me.&quot; Gabe leans down to take a whiff of his body, smelling the body odor residue from Liam wafting into his nose. He gave an approving groan as he feels his erection stiffen again, loving the manly smell and the drying cum. &quot;Fuck, bro. Shame I have to take a bath and prove I&#39;m still Alan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking the time he has waiting for Keith to finish, Gabe walks over to the mirror to fully assess himself. His memories provided much of the physical descriptors, but it doesn&#39;t hurt to gawk and lust over his body. It was something he did a lot anyway to build confidence in his body.<br />
<br />
Gabe flexes to firm up his muscles, give himself a good lookover, and mentally affirming how strong he is now. Liam had been strong, being a football quarterback. The additional increases when Alan merged into him made him thicker and stronger than the quarterback had been, now having a good 65 lbs on Liam. Safe to say that Gabe was proud of his body, meaning that both Alan and Liam were proud of it too.<br />
<br />
The black hair on his head had blonde tips, dyed in and styled into a pomade keeping his hair neat. Liam had blonde hair while Alan had black. Going down, his eyes were the deep hazel of Alan&#39;s, a few points into convincing Keith at least. His face was squared with a strong jawline thanks to Liam, with a sharp nose. His neck was thick with muscle, connected to wide and bulging shoulders. His biceps, triceps, and arm muscles were thick and strong as the result of countless hours in the gym, genetics, and supplements. His pecs were solid and thick, making him look manlier as it connected to 6 abdominal muscles popping out like cobblestones.<br />
<br />
Gabe never skips leg-day, evidenced with his thick thigh muscles as it went further down into powerful legs and wide, strong feet. Physically, he was a bona fide massive jock. <br />
<br />
Keith, or Vinnie walks out of the bathroom to see Gabe flexing and admiring himself in the mirror, the latter noticing him. &quot;Ah, Keith my bro! I want to clean up too because having sticky cum on my chest really doesn&#39;t feel nice... I&#39;m not convincing you that Alan&#39;s in here am I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, buddy. Honestly,  I get why I don&#39;t want to split you back apart, compagno.&quot; Keith&#39;s muscular body glistens with some water as he walks to the bag Keith brought along for a hotel stay. Extracting some clothes, Vinnie doesn&#39;t take any time before firing at them with the keys, transforming them into proper clothes for him to sleep in. &quot;But I am going to if I don&#39;t see Alan in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck man, I&#39;m still Alan in here.&quot; Vinnie glares, culling out the anger in Gabe. &quot;Sorry, I just need to get Alan&#39;s mindset again. I&#39;ll take a bath now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabriel doesn&#39;t waste time as he walks into the bathroom, water running as he starts to shower himself. His body went through the usual motions, making sure to scrub with soap where he knew would be dirty. <br />
<br />
One more problem of being such a big jock, showers take more time to properly clean up every crevice on his sculpted body. <br />
<br />
Another problem of being a horny jock, masturbating in the shower was something of a habit now. Gabe was now pent up from the hot water and lusting over his new body. After completing his shower, Gabe grabbed his erect rod again and started stroking with soap. Alpha male growls rumbled in his throat as both Alan and Liam strokes in tandem. Aiming at the toilet, he cums quickly and emptying his balls of his seed. It was harsh when your balls create twice as much semen from the merge.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
Gabe finishes his showering and walks out with a towel, walking over to Alan&#39;s bag. He takes out some clothing, but it was a few sizes too small.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keith, can I use the keys to make my sleep clothes?&quot; Gabe addresses his best friend without any jock lingo, all of it spent splattering the toilet with his cum. It allowed him to think clearer when his balls weren&#39;t aching so much. <br />
<br />
His best friend stares at him with a critical eye, then tosses the keys to Gabe. Looks like Keith trusts Alan to make some changes here. Gabe aimed at the clothing he had on the bed, pressing the car keys. <br />
<br />
The clothes pixelized and reformed into a sleeveless jersey with the name Gabe and the number 69. How mature. The briefs he had transformed into a boxer while his small underwear transformed into a comfortable jockstrap. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, looks like I&#39;m wearing jock stuff for the night.&quot; Gabe takes his chance for fun by flashing Keith, letting his towel drop, and giving him a good view of his package. It was short-lived as Gabe picked up the jockstrap and slid it on like second nature. Soon, he was fully clothed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I want to convince you that I&#39;m still Alan and Liam. I have their memories in here,&quot; Gabe knocked his head for emphasis. &quot;And just like you said with Vinnie being like a video-game character Keith is immersed in, the same can be said for Alan and Liam with Gabriel. They&#39;re just sharing the controllers, equally.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I notice that I act more like Liam when I indulge in things he knew, while, like right now, I&#39;m more like Alan because you&#39;re my friend.&quot; Gabe walks over to Vinnie, handing him the car keys. &quot;Look, outwardly I may look completely like a jock with almost no trace of Alan, I get it. I was scared shitless when I thought I deleted you, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It took a bit of time for me to acclimate, compagno. But I am alone in here, you are not.&quot; Keith looks down and sighs. &quot;I was worried because you are two persons creating one, not unlike me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, bro! You don&#39;t have to worry anymore. Gabriel Fletch is just Liam Barnes and Alan Page merged into one. They&#39;re not dead,&quot; Gabriel flexed and kissed his biceps, grinning. &quot;They just made someone super healthy and confident.&quot;<br />
<br />
Liam&#39;s hedonistic edge was tempered out by Alan&#39;s personality, making him less obsessed with getting sex. And with him being bi, he could go for men, and Vinnie was just his type.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, can you trust me and let me stay for a while longer? You still have to register for university tomorrow, and I want to get some tail in this body too.&quot; Gabe grinned, thinking about the fun he was going to get while still prioritizing Keith&#39;s education.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or, if you want, you can change me into one of your thugs. I find you hot, Vinnie. Think about it, I can be a rough thug just like you!&quot; Gabe grinned from ear to ear, baiting Keith nicely.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you say, bro?&quot;</p>
