<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tad sat with Connor feeling rather glad that things seemed to be resolving well for his childhood friend. The report that Connor had been questioning or unsure of his sexuality had been a great surprise and something that Tad had never expected. There&#39;d never been any sign of this kind of thing before recently and perhaps he&#39;d let himself be distracted by things earlier. But it still came as much as a surprise to him as the fact that Tad being a werewolf was probably a surprise to Connor and his family. Thus, Connor coming to grips with who he was and also becoming a werewildcat was something that Tad took a great deal of relief in. It was something that showed some measure of healing and acceptance of things that was a good thing. Tad couldn&#39;t be sure if Connor would stay with Ryan forever or if their relationship would be as open as mother&#39;s relationship had been with his father, given that Connor, like Tad&#39;s mother, was bisexual, but a lot of that was more a question for the future and it would be best to let things progress one day at a time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope he respects things regardless of the decision that I make in relation to how things have gone,&quot; Connor answered, &quot;as wouldn&#39;t that be the sign of a stronger relationship?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tad managed with a chuckle, &quot;and that would also give you the specific freedom on the kind of relationship you&#39;re looking for. Though... regardless of which way you decide... TALK with Ryan on what you want and what you&#39;ve decided on doing first. See what his thoughts are. That&#39;d ultimately help with a lot of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor nodded. He had no arguments with Tad there, and in many ways, he was glad to have his old friend being them for him in Moon Lake. It was a long way away from what had always been his home and had its surprises that came with it. The natives being largely were-beasts of some kind, and that Tad had been one all his life was a big surprise. But his family was forward thinking, and Tad had always been a good friend to him growing up in Virginia. In this, even if Tad was more interested the female werewolf he&#39;d met here, Amy Howler, and he would have Ryan Chang, the werewildcat that turned him, it would ultimately be like old times in a new place and now with the questions he&#39;d had for years being answered. It all felt like a good thing for Connor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Connor agreed, &quot;but... before I have to get ready for this pride meeting planning later that I&#39;m scheduled for with Ryan and his dad... maybe there could be something you could do to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To help?&quot; Tad asked, &quot;I&#39;d think that Ryan probably taught you how to transform on your own... I don&#39;t think you&#39;d need me for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor only replied with a smile, &quot;it&#39;s not in relation to transforming... Ryan did help with that. It is... an interesting sensation though... after the first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is,&quot; Tad replied happily with things feeling like old times as he talked with Connor.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s more in finding out some more things about Ryan,&quot; Connor commented, &quot;more on the things he likes and any habits that you might know of. You know... stuffy you&#39;ve probably learned about Amy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of what I&#39;ve learned about Amy came directly from her,&quot; Tad pointed out while rolling his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... but you&#39;ve also been here longer than my family has and has time for that,&quot; Connor commented, &quot;so... I&#39;m trying to catch up, and if I&#39;m to be a good boyfriend... it&#39;d help to know some things about the guy I&#39;m dating. What he likes, dislikes, things to avoid in conversation, important dates, like birthdays and so on. It&#39;d be pretty bad if I were to miss Ryan&#39;s birthday, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps... but if you don&#39;t know when his birthday is, that would be understandable,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;and I&#39;m not sure how much I know about Ryan would really help in that regard. As I&#39;ve been getting used to Moon Lake a bit too... and even as a born werewolf, that can be something. And a lot of what has been there has been more in relation to meeting pack members and getting in good standing with Amy and her family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But there&#39;d have to be some things you&#39;ve learned?&quot; Connor asked as he looked from Tad to one clock then to the windows and then finally back to Tad, &quot;even just from hanging out from time to time... right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing that you haven&#39;t learned already,&quot; Tad admitted, &quot;I don&#39;t think Ryan&#39;s mom is part of my pack, as I didn&#39;t see her when I was welcomed into it and his dad isn&#39;t part of the pride that my mom joined when we moved to Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor gave Tad a playful shove that barely budged him, but the small smile was enough to tell Tad that the effort was largely for gest. He took it with little difficulty and maybe swayed a little if only to give Connor the appearance of moving with the &quot;blow,&quot; but not much more than that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, you&#39;re supposed to be my eyes and ears!&quot; Connor teased playfully, &quot;what have you been up to, watching Amy get dressed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Among other things,&quot; Tad answered with a laugh, &quot;but again... I&#39;ve had a week or so to get used to Moon Lake and learn some things. Your family has only just moved here in the past few days... run into all the other weird things going on related to this reveal that the city is presently discussing. It&#39;d be perfectly understandable to not know everything about everyone... even with Ryan if he ends up being the one that you marry in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Connor managed, &quot;I just... I just don&#39;t want to blow it when I&#39;m only getting started. Ruin things, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... it can be rough moving into new places,&quot; Tad nodded, &quot;something I did a fair bit when the Marines moved my dad from post to post, or when he went on active deployment and the Marines wouldn&#39;t let my mom and I stay on the base so that new trainees or others could be moved onto it. But you stay polite and friendly, and you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; Connor managed.</p>
