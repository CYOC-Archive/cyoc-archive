<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a double slam of doors, Derrick and Kathy exited the beat-up, blue and green pick-up. Frazzled, Derrick leaned on the hood of the truck and continued the conversation they’d had been having in the cab by stating, “What do you say, if we cannot find them anything here, we get your sister and my brother a series of gift cards?”<br />
<br />
	As exhausted as her fiancé, Kathy thought about what he had said for a moment. It had always been difficult shopping for her sister. But since Linda had married Robert, Derrick’s younger brother, it seemed to have become even more so. Looking at the store, not sure how many she and Derrick had visited in the past in fifteen days or so, Kathy sighed and glanced over and her fiancé and replied, “That’s probably what we’ll have to do,” and with a nod toward the building, she asked, “You think they’ll have any luck here?”<br />
<br />
	“I don’t know,” Derrick said and with a slight smile, he knocked on the bonnet and said, “Here’s to hoping,” before he moved around the front of the vehicle and drew Kathy in to a hug.<br />
<br />
	The two snuggled close to one another, they started across the slick, snow covered parking lot. Dodging autos and a couple shoppers, Derrick inquired, “You said your sister was always difficult to shop for?” as they entered the building, stopped long enough to see there were no carts available, and continued on.<br />
<br />
	“Yeah,” Kathy told him before she inquired, “Was your brother always hard to find a gift for?”<br />
<br />
	“He’s always been a pain when it comes to presents,” Derrick groused as they headed down an aisle. “And don’t get me wrong. Whatever anyone gets him, he will accept. It’s just, it’s hard to know if he likes it or not. He never expressed any joy or disappointment when he got stuff. Nor did he ever really say what he wanted when we were growing up. It stressed our parents out, especially as his taste were alway so eclectic.”<br />
<br />
	“Linda’s the same way,” Kathy offered. “I always hope she like’s what I get her. And so do our mom and dad. But, it’s like she keeps everything bottled up,” and with a nod at the some items on a shelf they were passing, she asked, “How about those? Robert’s ranch has taken off. Maybe he could use the harnesses to hitch a couple of the horses to a sleigh and in winter he could offer rides to some of the local children. Or even to newlyweds. It could be romantic, if done right. And I’m sure Linda would come up with ideas on how to make it work.”<br />
<br />
	With a nod, Derrick said, “That’s an idea,” and stepping closer, he began to examine the  leads and harnesses and whatnot on the shelf, not sure what he was looking at, but trying to give an air he knew what he was doing.<br />
<br />
	Next to him, Kathy also stepped up to the shelf. Able to tell her fiancé had no idea what it was he was looking at, or for, she kept it to herself, as she was just as clueless. Squatting down, she peered at some of the larger harnesses and thought they might work best. Seeing some of them had bells, whilst others had medallion-like decorations, she reached for one, grasped it, and yelped when she got a static electric shock off it.<br />
<br />
	Something slid away from the harness she’d grabbed. And as Derrick enquired, “You all right?” the thing settled on a smaller harness.<br />
<br />
	A flap of her hand and Kathy nodded in response. And as her fiancé leaned down to pick up a harness, she commented, “It’s so dry in here, I got a shock when I touched one of the medallions decorating the harness.”<br />
<br />
	Derrick nodded at this. Not paying attention, he reached for a harness, grabbed the one the thing had settled on, and about to ask if it would work for Robert and Linda’s ranch, he never got the chance as he felt a sharp tingle go through his fingers and up into his hand. Shaking his hand, he grimaced and said to Kathy, “You’re right,” and standing, he exhaled and suggested, “Let’s try a different aisle,” as he dropped the thing back on the shelf.<br />
<br />
	Something fell off it, but neither paid attention to whatever it was. As Derrick started to walk away, Kathy unzipped her coat and began to fan herself with it. Her body temperature began to spike and she called out, “I’ll catch up with you in a minute. I’m just going to step outside for a moment.”<br />
<br />
	Derrick, who hadn’t heard her over the other noises in the store, walked an aisle over and stopped. Finding himself in an aisle that nothing but feed for various barnyard animals, he started to leave, but stopped. Mouth starting salivating, he looked at the various bags and finding he was hungry for whatever was inside, he took a step toward the nearest shelf. Hand lifted up and reached out as of its own volition, he stopped himself. Realising that he was close to tearing open the bag, he ran a hand over his face and backed away in a hurry. Thinking, “What the hell?!” he looked about to see if anyone had seen what he’d been about to do.<br />
<br />
	Seeing his fiancé wasn’t with him, he headed back to the previous aisle. Not finding her, he called out, “Kathy?” in as loud as voice as he could, and rubbing a hand over his face again, finding it was slick with sweat, he wondered where she’d gone.<br />
<br />
	Kathy, still hot and finding her clothes felt way too tight, stumbled outside. After she’d taken a couple deep breathes of the cold December air, she flapped her coat, adjust the waist of her jeans, and still too warm, she took a couple steps toward the truck. Figuring she’d wait there for Derrick, she instead changed her mind and without giving it a second thought, turned and followed the front of the store until it ended. Heading toward the back of the store, she found a large field.<br />
<br />
	With a quick motion, she shucked off her wool coat. Dropped on the ground, she was disappointed that it didn’t relieve her in any way. A glance about and she saw that she was alone. Kicking off her shoes and socks, she pulled up on her sweater and shirt and tossed on top of her foot and outerwear. Disturbed when she saw brown and white fur had started to grow over her torso, she was distracted from it when she noticed her bra was baggy and didn’t fit over her tits like it had been when she put it on in the morning.<br />
<br />
	Fingers fumbled for a few seconds with the shoulders straps, then the clasps in back. When she was finally able to get the thing off, she was surprised to see that not only had her C cup shrunk, but that she was near flat chested. The bra falling to the ground, Kathy was outright frightened by what she saw as the fur spread further over her torso. Whimpering, “What is happening to me,” and as she started to gain height and weight, she reached down, shifted the waistline on her pants in attempt to relieve how tight they were and when it didn’t help, she began to undo the buttons.<br />
<br />
	Inside the store, Derrick couldn’t tell which was weirder. At some point, his feet had split his shoes and the things had fallen away in tatters. Added to this was the oddity that nobody around him seemed to notice he was now barefoot. He feet making a weird noise as he headed for the front, he wanted to find Kathy and head home. Outside the store, he stopped when he found that not only did the cold winter day not seem to bother his bare feet, but also that when he breathed deeply, he could smell something he had no words to describe.<br />
<br />
	The scent rich, almost tangy, filled his nostrils, andDerrick uttered a grunt. A warmth that had nothing to do with how much he had on overcame him, starting betwixt his legs and he found himself drawn to it as badly as he’d been to the scent of the bags of feed. Weight jumping from a hundred and eighty-nine up to two hundred, he absently adjusted his tight pants. Oblivious that his dick and balls had started to pull up into his body, he made another grunt sound and started to headed in the direction he was sure the scent was coming from.<br />
<br />
	With a loud rip, Kathy’s pants and underwear split at the seams as her heavier, larger body could no longer be confined within them. Near naked, Kathy stared down not at the fur that covered more of her body, but rather the cervine penis that extended out a sheath and the testicles below them. Not being an expert on cocks, as the only ones she’d ever seen was a human’s prick, she could only stare and watch the fur as it covered her ponderous ball sack and penile sheath. With a snort, she jerked her head up, tore her eyes away from the genitals she could only describe as wrong and she peered in the direction of what she could only describe as the most irresistible scent she thought she’d ever smelled.<br />
<br />
	His steps became clumsy for a moment as he headed around the back of the store, but he still managed to keep on. Feet morphing into hooves, he grunted, a noise that was sounding more animalistic the more he made it, he gave a shake of his head, which was growing heavy as antlers started to bud and push outward. And when his clothes tore away from his body, Derrick slowed, but didn’t stop. Nude, he continued toward the scent that drew him onward, and a quick glance downward, he took in the white and brown pelt had started to cover his body, yet found he was more concerned by the fact that his cock and nuts had vanished, replaced by flat skin. Able to tell his privates were now between his legs, he wasn’t sure which he found more alarming; that he was a girl, or that the aroma that filled his nostrils not only seemed to draw him toward it, but seemed to make him randier than he’d even been in his entire life.<br />
<br />
	A sound caused him to look up, and for a moment, he couldn’t tell what he saw before him.<br />
<br />
	Covered in a fur that matched his, Derrick couldn’t tell if it was human, or animal. Realising that it was somehow Kathy, he grunted as his fiancé started to come to him. Suddenly seeing the erect member she sported, he knew he should be alarmed that she had become a dude. Instead, he found it only seemed to make him turned on even more.<br />
<br />
	Hands starting to turn into hooves, Derrick moved closer. As he did, Kathy, whose hands had started to become hooves and her arms front legs, found he couldn’t tell what she was looking at. Staring at the twenty inch antlers that sprouted from the woman’s head, for she could tell at least that the thing was female, she studied the fur that was rapidly covering the woman’s body. With a start, just as the two reached other, Kathy kenned it was Derrick. And when he rubbed his cheek against her chest, it came as an equal shock when she realised that she was larger of the two.<br />
<br />
	With a series of noises, Derrick tried to grasp Kathy’s erect prick, but found with his hooves he couldn’t. Understanding what her fiancé wanted, knowing she needed it as much as he did, she pulled him closer and rubbed herself again Derrick. A grunt escaped the transformed man and for a moment, his old self reasserted itself. Wanting to tell her that it wasn’t right what had happened to them, what was happening to them, as well as what they wanted to do, he never got a chance as, with a series of animal snorts and grunts, Kathy spun him around and began to rub against him.<br />
<br />
	Grunts and snorts escaped the two and Derrick found himself getting moist. A muzzle starting to push outward on her face, Kathy found she didn’t care. Instead, she forced Derrick to bend over and present himself better. Complying with what she wanted, a part of him screamed in terror not only at the erect member that was brushing against his sensitive female genitals, but also that he wanted it in him, in addition to what happened the moment she bent him over.<br />
<br />
	Arms ceased to be so, and with a crack, as they became front legs, his body shifted to that of a quadruped the moment his front hooves touched the ground. Body continuing to change, Derrick stretched his neck forward as far as it could go as a muzzle started to form. And as his female privates shifted to being suited for the animal he was rapidly becoming, his weight settled at 245, he stopped growing at forty-three inches at the shoulders with a length of five foot ten inches.<br />
<br />
	From behind, Kathy was unaware of what had just happened to her fiancé. Her need to sate herself causing her to loose herself more, she fell atop Derrick with a grunt as her weight jumped up to 389. Her privates shifting to better accommodate her so that she could get at her the man’s morphed genitals and Seeing the head of an animal before her, she watched as the beast stretched her neck and tossed her head. Suddenly aware of who she was, who was below her, and what she was about to do, Kathy tried to stop. But then, as she shifted in place in attempt to pull away, her posture shifted to that of a four-legged beast, her feet became hooves, her dick rubbed one final time against Derrick’s moist folds, and before she could stop herself, she began to thrust inward.<br />
<br />
	Height shifted to being fifty-five inches at the shoulder as she began to rut. Unable to stop herself, she started to loose herself again. And as she heard the same sounds from the animal beneath her, Kathy’s body lengthened to seven foot six.<br />
<br />
	Their changes coming faster, it was all over by the time they both were satisfied with what they’d done. With a grunt, Kathy blew her load, and shortly afterward, Derrick shuddered and climaxed. As this happened, their human minds slipped away, leaving behind those of two reindeer, who, finished, eventually separated. With a series of grunts, the two sniffed at each other for a minute before they wandered in opposite directions. Shaking her antlered head, the female began to paw at the hard ground in search of something to eat, whilst the male, his needs met, uttered a series of snorts and meandered away, his interest in the female lost.<br />
<br />
	Unbeknownst to either, the thing that had stripped them of their humanity, as well as flipped their sex and gender, from them, slipped further down amongst the reindeer harnesses. Before it reached the bottom of the pile and the shelf, it had disappeared.</p>
