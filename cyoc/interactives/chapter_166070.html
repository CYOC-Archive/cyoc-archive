<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The night dragged on. It wasn&#39;t exactly cold, but the wind did bring with it an unpleasant chill. Alec sat a little closer to the haystack lookout he&#39;d made.<br />
<br />
He missed his watch and smartphone. He had no idea how much time had passed and just sitting here wasn&#39;t exactly exciting him.<br />
<br />
He went over his plans again in his head. He&#39;d already reviewed them so many times he&#39;d even started to consider testing his power on a cow. But he wanted to try his powers near someone else, preferably an expert should things go wrong.<br />
<br />
He got up and stretched his muscles. The herd was still together in the center of the large pasture.<br />
He sat back down again.<br />
<br />
He looked at the moon again, but this time something was off. He narrowed his eyes. Two tiny dark spots had appeared. He kept looking, excruciatingly slowly the spots got bigger.<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for him to discern large wings.<br />
Were they large birds? <br />
<br />
The large birds silently circled the area. This was it!<br />
Slowly and silently they descended and landed on a fence.<br />
He snuck through the grass a little closer.<br />
He was only half right, they were birds but also women.<br />
The bottom half was clearly that of a bird, but from the middle was the body of a woman, except instead of arms they had large wings. They didn&#39;t appear to be wearing clothes. They were roughly the same size. <br />
&quot;Harpies.&quot; He hissed to himself.<br />
<br />
The herd stirred. <br />
&quot;Hèhè, looks like we&#39;ve got another easy meal here.&quot; Her voice was smooth, seductive even.<br />
&quot;Seems like a twofer to me? Which do you want?&quot; The other replied, her voice sounded like a song.<br />
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know the fat one would be nice.&quot; One motioned with her head.<br />
&quot;And what about the other?&quot;<br />
&quot;I think that one may be nice to fertilize my eggs.&quot;<br />
A chill ran down Alec&#39;s spine. What the hell did that mean. Were there bulls among the cows?<br />
Just then he noticed the harpies were staring at his position. How the hell could they see him?<br />
&quot;A bit scrawny though.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, if you don&#39;t want him...&quot; The seductive voiced one spread her wings.<br />
&quot;Fuck.&quot; Alec said.<br />
The harpy let herself fall forward, her long wings spread wide as she glided through the air towards him.<br />
Alec got up and ran towards the barn. &quot;Fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t look back, he just ran as fast as he could.<br />
&quot;Oooh, I love a good hunt. But why not come with me? I&#39;ll make it worth your while.&quot; Her honey sweet voice followed behind him.&quot;Boys like to play with girls don&#39;t they?&quot; <br />
Was there some magic at work here, he felt a tug in the back of his head. Like his body wanted to turn around.<br />
He vaulted the fence and rounded the corner.<br />
He shot through the narrow opening in the barn doors he&#39;d made earlier.<br />
<br />
He ran toward the rear wall, where the sharper tools were mounted. But a large shadow perched on one of the overhead beams. She must&#39;ve flown in via an open window. &quot;Oh, I guess you just wanted some privacy? You naughty boy.&quot; He couldn&#39;t see her face, but it felt like she winked at him.<br />
His hand went to the rusty knife in his pocket as he stared up at the harpy above him. Being closer now than outside he was able to see more detail, she was big. At least chest height to himself. He noticed her large naked breasts hanging out between her wings.<br />
&quot;Like what you see boy? Shall I come and join you?&quot; She wiggled her feathery hips.<br />
&quot;I...I&#39;m fine thanks.&quot; Alec said, he felt lame.<br />
&quot;He finally speaks!&quot; she crowed. A cow in the barn mooed in response. &quot;And such a nubile voice. I could just eat...you...UP.&quot;<br />
At the last syllabil she dropped forward her large talons outstretched towards him.<br />
<br />
Alec pulled out his knife and threw it at the descending harpy. It hit her wing, but bounced off uselessy.<br />
&quot;I love foreplay!&quot;<br />
Her weight slammed into his torso, he felt her talons dig into his flesh. Her large breasts dangled above his head as he fell backwards.<br />
Alec panicked, one last option. It came from deep within. &quot;Possession!&quot;<br />
Light emanated from Alec and bounced into the Harpy. <br />
<br />
One moment he was staring at the harpy and the next he was staring at a familiar face. They fell backward and he ended up perched on top of his own body.<br />
Despite the darkness he could see clearly, almost like it was day. No wonder they spotted him so easily. His body felt alien. He looked at his hands only to see large wings.  He looked down at his body and gasped at the large naked tits that were hanging from his chest, topped by large perky nipples.<br />
His body looked to be asleep and as he looked he felt his nether regions burn. The harpies body felt like it wanting to rip his pants off and have her way with him. <br />
He gasped as he noticed the talons in his shoulder. Carefully he pulled them out and waddled back from his motionless form.<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t be dead.&quot; he whispered, his voice had the weird seductive sound the harpy had, despite his intentions.</p>
