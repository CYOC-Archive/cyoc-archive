<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly-- but perhaps not unexpectedly, Mary began to feel a warm sensation growing from her loins. Looking <br />
down, she blushed as Draconic horniness quickly flooded her mind and body. Her body demanded to be filled-- <br />
stuffed, and her mind complied. Looking up, her lust-filled eyes again saw the two transformed dragons. Are <br />
these the same dragons? Was this Mom and Robert? She asked herself this, because these beasts that once <br />
terrified her, now filled her with lust and made her crotch burn.<br />
Sauntering over, she teasingly pushed the two navy blue dragons out of the doorway, into the dining room. She <br />
spotted the bare hickory-wood table-- obviously designed for an extended family to eat around during the <br />
holidays. She tossed the chairs of the table into a corner, shattering a few to clear up space. Her lady-bits <br />
were already dripping , and she could barely take it standing. Thrusting herself over the short of the table, <br />
she exposed her pussy and stared at the two grinning dragons.<br />
&quot;Satisfy me.&quot; She cooed.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Melissa himself was horny. Not too hard to imagine, as he was merely a female human less than half an hour <br />
ago. As she became he, the testosterone called to her-- demanded of her, to fuck. Still strongly influenced by <br />
this, he watched with hands groping his foot-long member as the red goddess of a dragon pushed him out of the <br />
doorway, into the dining room. She began throwing the mahogany chairs into a corner, a dear set to Melissa. <br />
Yet, he didn't get angry, but hornier as each toss of a chair displayed Mary's beautiful feminine form. By the <br />
time she was finished, he was oozing pre-cum. Then-- quite suddenly, but expectedly, she jumped onto the <br />
Hickory, revealed herself, and demanded to be satisfied. His lust intensified.<br />
Unfortunately for him, his former husband was on the ball and already began assuming the position to enter <br />
Mary from behind. Mary motioned for Melissa to come to the other side of the table where her head was. Also <br />
sauntering over, he was confused at what she wanted. No sooner had he gotten in range of her hands however, <br />
had she already slowly pumping his newfound dragon dick. The entire sensation still new to him, Melissa melted <br />
as his world began to flush with pleasure. Mary worked smoothly and diligently. He would've came right there <br />
had Robert not attacked her pussy.<br />
She yelped as Robert slammed into her the first time, and let go of Melissa's dick. Suddenly unsatisfied, he <br />
looked to see what he could do to stimulate himself more. Then he remembered how three ways usually go, and <br />
what that meant for him. He shocked Mary by grabbing her by the horns and jamming his twelve-inch monster down <br />
her throat. She struggled as Melissa began pumping her head along his shaft. Not to be outplayed, she grabbed <br />
his sides and deep-throated until she found the rhythm between him and his used-to lover. Pumping faster than <br />
he was, he was not only flushed in the pleasure, but buried in it. Mary's tongue skillfully massaged his <br />
shaft, sending waves of sharp pleasure to his entire being. The bursts sent him ever closer to the edge.<br />
Soon however, he began feeling the pressure build up in his groin. His eyes closed; the intensity of the <br />
pleasure was too much. He couldn't last any longer. He gripped Mary's horns tight as forced her head down. At <br />
first a small torrent burst from his large scaly balls, but it soon grew. His cum grew thicker as he <br />
ejaculated faster into Mary's mouth, swallowing swiftly while still probing with her tongue. He groaned as <br />
more semen shot out harder and harder. The world became deep sensual twangs of pleasure as he pumped liters <br />
into Mary's ever awaiting mouth. Hours seemingly passed, with Robert still pumping away at Mary's pussy. In a <br />
final firework, Melissa pulled his monstrous cock out of Mary's mouth and shot a multitudes of thick, ropy cum <br />
onto her face and back. It struck with loud slaps, barely missing Robert, still pounding away with reckless <br />
abandon.<br />
<br />
Melissa, gasping for breath and his senses, looked down upon what he had done. Mary's entire head and back <br />
were decorated with thick, white cum strings draping across her spikes and horns. Mary herself had cum oozing <br />
out of her maw, and eyes forced shut from the cum drippings. She however, did not miss a beat and began <br />
focusing on the celebration happening with her groin. Melissa stepped back and watched Robert adamantly <br />
continue to pump his Fourteen inch missile in and out of Mary, going to the hilt each time. &quot;He could always <br />
go for hours...&quot; Melissa commented.<br />
He felt like he could too if he tried. As a matter of fact, he was ready for another go. But he could see Mary <br />
would be down for the count after after Robert was finished. Her eyes still shut, she was moaning as if she <br />
was already giving birth at his movements. He watched as Robert's maw hung open, as it always had during sex, <br />
he recalled.<br />
Then, with a toothy smile, a sharp, evil lust-powered idea developed in Melissa's head. He ran back to the <br />
kitchen to grab a female dragon candy. He planned to turn his spouse into another female dragon, just for him <br />
so he could fuck her senseless. Unfortunately, in procuring Mary's red dragon candy, Robert may have <br />
accidentally safeguarded his masculinity by spilling the jar of black, red, and blue dragon candies onto the <br />
counter. The different candies piled together on the counter in a clumsy mess. Suddenly, loud gruffs and <br />
noises came from the dining room, signifying Robert's intended release. Panicking, Melissa grabbed one without <br />
looking and rushed back to the other two and their furious lovemaking.<br />
Robert's maw was as wide as ever as he was getting dangerously close to stuffing Mary with his seed. Taking <br />
aim, Melissa launched the candy through the air. It hit with deadly accuracy. He swallowed the candy whole  <br />
without even noticing. Melissa had no idea which candy he'd thrown, but it was too late as Robert clamped his <br />
jaw shut in orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, which candy did I toss?&quot; Melissa grimaced, fearing his plan might not work.</p>
