<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Sorry for my prolonged absence from this board. While working in the retail industry is tough during this virus crisis, it&#39;s nothing compared to what anyone in the medical profession is currently experiencing. My best to everyone in that field and I hope everybody stays safe!—tmw.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Werelioness Sheila Wiggleston led the newest werelion of Moon Lake-Richard Van Direstag-and his still human (for now?) wife Rose back to her house, conversing as they traveled.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a naturally born were, which means although I didn&#39;t experience my first transformation until after my 14th birthday during puberty, I was destined to be a lioness from the moment I took my first breath,&quot; Sheila began, &quot;so we know how important it is for regular humans to have a choice in the matter as to what species they want to be if they decide to join were society.&quot;<br />
&quot;Richard&#39;s transformation was an accident*,&quot; Rose reminded her, &quot;but he certainly seems to be enjoying it since,&quot; she added, noticing how her husband kept staring at the lioness with his new manhood at least half erect during the whole journey.<br />
What Rose missed was Richard&#39;s occasional glances at her with the same reaction.<br />
&quot;It IS a lot to take in,&quot; he conceded. &quot;I&#39;ve got all these new thoughts and instincts running through my head right now that I&#39;m trying to come to terms with, but it was only the Mandatory Were Law I objected to,&quot; Richard replied. &quot;I do see the error of my ways now,&quot; he added in his much deeper were voice.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Sheila said with a sly smile. &quot;While naturally born weres do have a longer period to acclimate to their existence as a were, the first transformation is pretty much an unique experience for anyone to deal with. Although your transformation wasn&#39;t planned, you make a great werelion,&quot; she said, briefly caressing the closest of his furry cheeks with her paw.<br />
Richard knew he was blushing underneath his new identity, and was unaware of how Rose continued to stare at him and Sheila.<br />
Yet Richard couldn&#39;t deny the feelings he had building within him.<br />
Not only wanting to take the werelioness again and claim her as his, but Rose as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Law was meant to protect Moon Lake and its citizens, for only those most trusted souls outside of local residents know our secrets,&quot; Sheila reminded them. &quot;Someday, I hope we don&#39;t have to hide anymore, because I love being who nature intended me to be and wish I could be out and about as you see me now 24/7 all year round. But until we can trust the rest of the world not to see us as &#39;mindless, feral animals&#39; that need to be hunted down and made extinct...&quot;(*2)<br />
&quot;We only came to Washington, let alone Moon Lake, to open a new sporting goods store in Seattle. Home real estate costs were less expensive here than closer to our new business,&quot; explained Richard.<br />
&quot;And our oldest son is going to be attending Moon Lake College,&quot; added Rose.<br />
&quot;Oh? Maybe I&#39;ll see him around,&quot; replied Sheila.<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; wondered Rose.<br />
&quot;I teach Computer Science classes there when I&#39;m not working for Stovall Systems.&quot;<br />
&quot;How old are you?&quot; wondered Rose.<br />
&quot;As far as were society is concerned, I&#39;m the proverbial spring chicken. As far as the calendar is concerned, I&#39;m pushing 60,&quot; answered their new acquaintance.<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t look it,&quot; Richard said, eyeing her again.<br />
&quot;Thank you, kind sir,&quot; Sheila said with a smile. &quot;Barring anything unforeseen, weres can live up to at least 4 centuries and while not invulnerable, we&#39;re pretty much immune to a lot of common ailments like colds, flu, and even a lot of sexually transmitted diseases except for HIV and AIDS itself if you&#39;re stupid enough to share a tainted needle with an ill drug user.&quot;<br />
&quot;WOW!&quot; said Richard and Rose, almost simultaneously.<br />
&quot;Considering sex seems to be a were&#39;s favorite past time...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know the feeling,&quot; growled Richard, feeling his new penis wanting to be active again.<br />
With either woman. Preferably both.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here we are. My house,&quot; said Sheila, leading them through the backyard to a modest 1 story structure with the standard 3 bedroom-2 bath floor plan.<br />
As they approached the rear entrance, Rose started looking around.<br />
&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Sheila asked.<br />
&quot;Just trying to get my bearings.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh. Well, while we did cut through the woods, we&#39;re only about a block away from your place, in the opposite direction from the Tachibana Estate.&quot;<br />
&quot;Tachibana?&quot; asked Richard.<br />
&quot;One of the most important and influential families in Moon Lake. They live in the Oriental style house near yours. Make yourselves at home,&quot; Sheila added, opening the rear door after collecting the key from under the mat.<br />
Richard and Rose Van Direstag sat at opposite ends of a round kitchen table, as Sheila rummaged for a moment in the fridge. Then she paused and got something from a nearby cabinet before taking the empty chair between her guests at the table.<br />
<br />
Wiggleston set down three unopened plastic water bottles, one for each of them, and then placed a pill bottle in front of Rose.<br />
&quot;You might want to take a look at this,&quot; she advised.<br />
Rose picked it up and read the label. It seemed like standard prescription information, but she didn&#39;t know what the medication was. &quot;WLBC?&quot;<br />
&quot;Werelioness Birth Control,&quot; explained Sheila. &quot;Were&#39;s are VERY fertile, and as you have seen for yourself, sex is the most common and pleasant way for a normal human to become furry.&quot;<br />
Thoughts of her children becoming weres, for as far as Rose knew they were all virgins, crossed her mind with motherly concern as Sheila continued.<br />
&quot;While we only give birth like anyone else, just one or two children at most in any pregnancy; without these, weres would have out populated the world ages ago. There is no rule that says you have to become a werelioness and I hate to be blunt about this, but now that Richard is a were, if the two of  you ever want to do the horizontal mambo together again...&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean...&quot; realized Rose.<br />
&quot;Yep. Welcome to Were Society, unless you prejoin as something else before the next time you two copulate,&quot; said Sheila. &quot;And unless you&#39;re already on whatever pill you need, roughly nine months later...&quot;<br />
&quot;I only led Richard out into the woods tonight because he was being stubborn about trying to leave Moon Lake and not wanting to discover more about weres. Richard and I hadn&#39;t thought that far ahead, let alone about ever having more children. Especially considering we already have three and I&#39;m—&quot;<br />
&quot;That last part is from a regular human&#39;s perspective,&quot; Sheila pointed out. &quot;Were women can still have children up until sometime in their late 200s easily, although most doctors advise waiting at least a year or so between pregnancies.&quot;<br />
&quot;But I, that is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be flustered,&quot; Sheila said, reaching out and taking Rose&#39;s hand in her paw. &quot;I know this is all new to both of you. Richard being a werelion now, he&#39;s naturally going to want... more. I sense he&#39;s not only a werelion, but also an Alpha. Do you know what that means?&quot;<br />
&quot;I think so. In some areas, Richard&#39;s always been a Type A personality.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not surprised. Look at the way he keeps staring at us,&quot; Sheila said, which caught both Van Direstags by surprise.<br />
&quot;I thought it was just you,&quot; confessed Rose.<br />
&quot;Nope. I may wind up being part of his pride, his harem if you will, if I&#39;m lucky. As long as he registers his new existence and group with Leon Talbot, the local Werelion King, he can have his own private group with as many women that are willing to be with and theoretically &#39;belong&#39;,&quot; Sheila said, intentionally making air quotes around that last word, &quot;to him as long as Richard&#39;s not stupid enough to either challenge the King for his crown or attempt to take someone who&#39;s already been claimed as a member of another pride.&quot;<br />
&quot;I may have had my head up my ass over all of this before now, but I&#39;m not THAT stupid,&quot; Richard was quick to say.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a wise Alpha,&quot; Sheila agreed. &quot;I&#39;m still available, if you&#39;re interested,&quot; she told him with a sexy smile, &quot;but as his wife, you&#39;re his Beta,&quot; she informed Rose.<br />
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; asked the confused woman.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re Number 1 in his heart. Now and forever. No matter how many other women, lionesses and otherwise, he ever has sex with, Richard will always come home to and truly love only you. Others may ask for the chance, but you&#39;re the only one that shall ever be allowed to bear him any more cubs.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; said Rose, wondering what the hell she and Richard were getting into.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have always loved you Rose. From at least our first date, if not the moment I ever first saw you,&quot; her husband began. &quot;Part of my fears of weres were these dreams I had since we moved here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? What dreams?&quot; asked Rose, as Sheila&#39;s eyes lit up at the revelation.<br />
&quot;I kept dreaming I became a were. A lion specifically and not only claimed you, but any other willing female as mine. At least sexually.&quot;<br />
&quot;Richard, I—&quot;<br />
&quot;We weres call them Prophecy Dreams. Glimpses of the future when we&#39;re facing a tough decision and don&#39;t know what to do,&quot; explained Sheila. &quot;But I&#39;ve never heard of a normal human having one before joining were society.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I did, and I felt ashamed of potentially betraying Rose, our love and our marriage, let alone the family we&#39;ve created together. I love her so much, the thought of ever hurting her eats me up inside, which is why I originally wanted to get the hell out of here while we still could,&quot; confessed Richard.<br />
&quot;Richard...&quot; was all Rose could say, staring at the new version of her husband.<br />
There was no denying the musky, manly scent coming from his handsome, furry form.<br />
And the new... equipment he had between his legs...<br />
&quot;I still love you Rose,&quot; swore her husband, &quot;but I won&#39;t lie to you. As much as I want to literally make you my furry mate now and forever, a part of me wants to take Sheila and—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rose. Look at me and concentrate for a moment,&quot; requested Sheila, intentionally interrupting Richard before he could finish that sentence.<br />
Mrs. Van Direstag turned and did so.<br />
&quot;Regardless of what species you decide to become if you do join, it takes at least a day to go through the proper channels and acquire your first month&#39;s supply of whatever birth control pill you&#39;ll need. Even then, the very first pill takes at least an hour to kick in and become fully effective. Do you understand what I&#39;m saying?&quot; Sheila asked, to which Rose could only nod affirmatively.<br />
&quot;Now then,&quot; Sheila said. &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind sharing Richard with me, because I&#39;ve got to have him again before we part company for the night and the way his leg keeps rubbing against mine, the feeling&#39;s mutual. But we can share him. And we could enjoy each other too.&quot;<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Rose said, breaking out of her stupor after staring into Sheila&#39;s eyes for so long.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m bi. I swing both ways. Can&#39;t decide which is better, a good hard cock or a talented tongue on my pussy. I definitely love the taste of both honey AND cream,&quot; Sheila said with a smile, looking at both Richard and Rose, before turning to look at her again.<br />
&quot;If you decide to do this, it must be of your own free will, because weres have a VERY STRICT code against inducting someone into were society against their will.&quot;<br />
&quot;But you said the first pill takes at least an hour to become effective,&quot; Rose reminded her.<br />
&quot;True,&quot; concurred Sheila, &quot;and while they&#39;re species specific, I honestly don&#39;t know if each individual prescription is personalized too, so there is still somewhat of a possible risk that you might become pregnant after all if you do agree to what I&#39;m about to suggest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neither woman saw that the werelion&#39;s face changed from sorrow and worry to an expression of joy and anticipation as Sheila said, &quot;What I am willing to do, if you want me to, is for you to take one of my werelioness birth control pills now and I&#39;ll be honored to make you a lioness while we&#39;re waiting for you to be able to safely take Richard&#39;s hard leonine cock. If you&#39;d rather be something else, that&#39;s okay. It just means you&#39;ll have to wait longer before...&quot;<br />
And Sheila left that thought unfinished, as thoughts of the anxious werelion sitting nearby crossed both their minds.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Rose, looking at both weres sitting across from her, individually and together. &quot;This is a lot to take in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted, and there is still a slight chance you might become pregnant in the process if we don&#39;t time this properly or the prescriptions really are personalized too, but the odds are far better against that with a pill than without one.&quot;<br />
&quot;The pills are THAT potent?&quot; asked Rose.<br />
&quot;Yes. My mom&#39;s had me on them since I was old enough to do so. No children yet until <i> I</i> decide I want to become a mother,&quot; replied Sheila.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said the human woman, looking at the lioness again. &quot;I&#39;ve... dabbled a little in college, but I never went all the way with another woman,&quot; confessed Rose, feeling her cheeks burn in embarrassment. &quot;Once I met Richard...&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand. The decision is totally yours,&quot; said Sheila, before kissing Rose&#39;s cheek.<br />
&quot;Just remember this. Regardless of what, if any were, you ever decide to become, just because Richard is now a horny werelion with an itch to scratch doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t have and enjoy an open marriage and be on the prowl for willing partners too.&quot;<br />
Then the werelioness stood up and stretched in all her feline glory.<br />
&quot;But either way, like I said, I&#39;ve just got to have your husband again before we part company tonight. This doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t love you and your marriage is at risk but whatever happens, I hope we can still become friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Sheila Wiggleston turned and approached Richard.<br />
The werelion was already standing, his cock hard and ready in anticipation of what was about to happen between them.<br />
As the lions embraced and started kissing, Rose saw one of Sheila&#39;s paws drift down to start caressing Richard&#39;s new manhood even as he put one furry arm around Sheila&#39;s waist as the other started playing with one of the werelioness&#39; breasts.<br />
Richard briefly looked over Sheila&#39;s shoulder at his wife. He smiled and mouthed the words &quot;I love and want you so much.&quot;<br />
Then he blew her a kiss before going back to nuzzling Sheila&#39;s furry neck.<br />
All Rose Van Direstag could do was gaze at the werelioness birth control bottle on the table before her when not watching the two weres sexually enjoy each other, their tails swishing happily in unison with each other, and contemplate her future.<br />
