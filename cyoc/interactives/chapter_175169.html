<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the dust began to settle, June was left slouched in the corner of her giant kitchen in a combination of shock and contemplation. She kept eyeing the clock on the wall. This morning, it had been nothing special. Now it seemed to be several stories above her head. The shrunken woman realized that it had been an hour or more since Ty had left her like this. She gulped. She was furious, she was sickened, she was aroused, she was humiliated, she was scared, she was remorseful. She was... she was doll sized. She gulped and finally got to her feet, pacing nervously across a warehouse sized kitchen. She kept passing her piled housecoat and decided to crawl into it, wrapping the giant garment around her like a blanket and sitting there for a time.<br />
<br />
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What was she going to do? What was Ty going to do to her? What had he meant when he said she was going to pay. What did he still have in store for her? She looked over herself in horror. If he could make her a tiny human being, what else could he do to her? She recalled the initial feelings of twisting pain and agony. Her flesh starting to compact. Her guts. Her bones. Her brain. She shuddered at the possibilities and started sobbing again.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t deserve this! Yes... she did. She began to cry harder, so alone, so small, so completely and utterly helpless. She deserved this. He should have just snuffed her out into nothingness.<br />
<br />
She sat there for a while wallowing in all of her life&#39;s indiscretions and then blinked several times. She heard footsteps on the front porch. With a gasp, she shot up and flew out of her housecoat, grabbing the flannel and tugging it along the kitchen floor. Fuck! She had to hide! The middle aged woman found she was far from completely weak and could easily wrangle her clothes against the basement door. It looked like they were laundry. Perfect. She gasped as she heard the key twist in the front lock and her eyes bolted around the room desperately. Everything was so high up.<br />
<br />
The couch! She flew across the kitchen on her tiny legs, with great long strides, and fell onto the carpet to hide behind the couch in the gap it sat away from the wall. Panting, she winced as she heard giant heavy boots clatter at the entrance. The distinctive sound of the rusty old mailbox creaking open and then dropping with a metalic thud could be heard outside. Her heart started beating again as she heard the boots thud down the front step and then vanish into the late morning.<br />
<br />
June chuckled, ashamed of her own terror, and then broke into a fit of laughter as she sat behind the giant couch. Sure, why not? She was a terrified and naked twelve inch tall woman. Might as well get used to it, she&#39;d probably be like this for a while. She sighed heavily, growing more secure, and let her thoughts run out of control as she emerged and stood from behind the couch. Reality had finally sunk in and June began to comprehend her new scale. Everything in the living room was familiar but new. She looked around in fascination. Her chair in the corner, now so huge that she&#39;d have to climb it just to reach the seat. The TV stand now loomed like a building over her. The top seemed to be fifty feet away. She walked out into the middle of the living room and felt herself break into a hot blush. This was actually really cool. Everything was so different, everything was so huge in comparison to her now. She might be the smallest living woman in the world. That brought her a flush of arousal. She liked being little. She had always dreamed of being shorter, more compact, being able to look up and men instead of down at them from her six foot four. Well, she had gotten her wish!<br />
<br />
The errant thought of giant Ty&#39;s finger touching her pussy lips made her grow wet again. She gulped and she realized she had been utterly turned on by being mistreated and dominated like the little bitch she was. Her cheeks burned rosy red and her nipples went hard. Yes... she liked it. A lot. She hoped he&#39;d get back and punish her again. She walked into the kitchen with a smirk and giggled slightly, a high pitched squeak. She loved the lack of control. The lack of responsibility. Being controlled and not being the one in control. Ty had well and truly knocked her down several pegs and feet at once. She was just a little helpless toy.<br />
<br />
June began to climb the stairs to the upstairs hall. It reminded her of the rock climbing she had done when she was younger. When she and Mark were without children and able to travel. The rug on the steps brushed her tits several times and made her a little more flustered. As she got to the top of the staircase she found herself panting a little and out of breath. Fuck she was out of shape. The little woman rested at the top of the stairs and tried to figure it all out. Ty had... well, she looked herself over, the how didn&#39;t matter. He could. She stared in fascination at her tiny hands and held them out to compare them to the power socket beside her. God, she was so teensy! She hugged herself in lust and began to massage her own body sensually, eyes closed, relishing the sheer weirdness of it all. Her complete and total helplessness. Things would be different after this. She and Ty would become mutually attached to each other. All those years she had thought him stupid and useless, it turned out his pervy little mind was more in line with hers than she had ever guessed. She chuckled again, grew more aroused. She began to massage her tits, recalling the feeling of his giant fingers pinching their squishy flesh together. Yes... she wanted more. She wanted to be shrunk and controlled at his will. A bug, a mouse, a doll, a midget, even just a few inches shorter. She felt the dampness. She let her mind wander to repressed sexual fantasies of being a small woman dommed by a big man. In this case, the man was a boy. Her step son. She blushed harder.<br />
<br />
No, let it simmer, she decided. She wanted so badly to get off right then and there, but she controlled her urge and took several deep slow breaths. Wait. This might not turn out to be enjoyable anyway. She knew damn well she hated and abused Ty for four years. She felt shame. She felt fear. She began to wonder if he was out planning his revenge, or doing things to other people. She suddenly came back to reality and felt a pang of stomach churning terror again. What... what if he was going to seriously hurt her? Not just rough domineering fun but genuine violence. She was... she was completely helpless. She felt sickly vulnerable again and all of her arousal faded.<br />
<br />

<br />
Ty stepped down the street with new and wonderful freedom. He held his favorite flavor of ice-e, a bag of new stuff in his hand, paid for with June&#39;s money. He turned back down his street and approached the house. A devious smile began to form across his lips as he began to think about what he would do with his step mom when he got in. His heart fluttered with joy as he approached the house. He unlocked the door and opened it, quickly tossing down his bag and looking around for the little doll woman.<br />
<br />
June gasped from the bottom of the stairs, eyes widening, as Ty kicked off his shoes and approached her. He loomed over the tiny woman and stood over her, grinning. June looked up in renewed awe and blinked several times.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What are you... you... going to do to me?&quot; She squeaked, clutching herself nervously and backing away.<br />
<br />
Ty simply knelt down wordlessly and went to pick her up. She didn&#39;t resist this time, clutching the top of his hand as he raised her into the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now...&quot; he said softly, yet ominously, &quot;Now we pick up where we left off.&quot;<br />
<br />
June visibly gulped, began to tremble again, and simply stared back and waited for her fate.</p>
