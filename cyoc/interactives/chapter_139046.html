<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dancing and posing felt so natural to Nick that he forgot a while all his worries. When Judd came near to the audience, he followed him just like a professional would. The spotlights focused on them, the men throwing bills between laughs and cheers, Nick was almost hypnotized when he heard a voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonderful show!&quot; A man said through a microphone. &quot;Our chippendale and hairy hunk are doing a great performance but there is left to invite here, who do you want to join them?&quot;<br />
<br />
People began to shout. &quot;A jock! A daddy bear! A twink!&quot; And after that last one, people began to cheer and repeat it. &quot;A twink! A twink! A bottom with a huge ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, people have chosen!&quot; The guy on the mic said. &quot;NEXT!&quot;<br />
<br />
When Nick heard that last word, he remembered where he was and what had happened. He suddenly stopped dancing and looked around terrified. People laughing at him, an almost naked guy next to him twerking or something and he was flexing his arms. He looked behind and saw another man coming in to the stage, he looked like Riley just a little taller and, apparently, barely older. He hadn&#39;t changed too much, unlike him or Judd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, man! A twink?! Really?!&quot; Riley yelled when he looked at himself. &quot;I was expecting something bigger like a jock or a bodybuilder, I looked the same!&quot; He looked at Nick who was watching at him bewildered. &quot;Nick? Look at you! I&#39;m older than you but now you&#39;re the bigger one? Not fair!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Riley, what&#39;s going on?&quot; Nick asked him. &quot;I don&#39;t feel like myself but for a moment I thought this was so normal and now that you&#39;re here... I&#39;m terrified.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just keep dancing. I&#39;ll explain you later.&quot; Riley told him and Nick obeyed, when he turned back to the audience, Riley said. &quot;At least my buns are bigger than your.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick blushed and kept dancing along the rhythm. After a moment, he realized that Judd had left the stage and he was alone with Riley. He wondered where he was when a voice called from the audience.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want a private show!&quot; A huge imposing man shouted to the mic man. &quot;I&#39;ll pay whatever it costs!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, privates show are in our back rooms.&quot; The mic guy said. &quot;Who do you want to join you there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Him, the one in white!&quot; The man pointed to Nick who was shocked of having been chosen.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on! Riley!&quot; He looked at Riley but his friend seemed more disappointed of not being chosen than worried for him. The big man took him by his arm and pulled him through the audience. He felt the hands of dozens of men on his body as he walked through there, it was a weird experience to him because he was scared and aroused at the same time.<br />
<br />
When the big man and he arrived to their private room, the man fell on a sofa and grinned at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, it&#39;s just you and me, banana boy&quot; He told Nick who was frozen in there. &quot;Let&#39;s talk for a moment, you know, get to know each other a little better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I&#39;m Nick. I&#39;m 11 years old...&quot; That last sentence sounded so weird to him coming from his manly voice. &quot;I-I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening. It&#39;s my first time here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so you&#39;re fresh meat.&quot; The man wickedly grinned. Nick didn&#39;t get it but blushed even so. &quot;I like it. Your shyness contrasts delightfully with that body of yours.&quot; Nick blushed even more. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you I&#39;ve paid a lot of money for you, so your body is mine for the next hour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;M-my body?&quot; Nick sheepishly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, how cute! You&#39;re so naive!&quot; The man smiled. &quot;Yes, your body. I can turn you whatever I want just by saying it. Fir example, if I want you to have a bigger weiner...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick kneeled and moaned as he felt his manhood growing bigger inside his thong. &quot;It&#39;s too big!&quot; He moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m the one who will say when it&#39;s too big.&quot; The man said. &quot;In fact, I want it bigger aaand a bigger dick head. I want to see your mushroom through the fabric!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick moaned on the floor as his dick grew even more. His mushroom tip got more prominent as its silhouette was clearly visible now. He was aroused that he shot his load in no time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I didn&#39;t tell you to cum yet!&quot; The man yelled. &quot;Anyway, you still had boy balls... It&#39;s a good opportunity to watch them grow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaah!!&quot; Nick yelled in pain when his balls began to pump like water balloons, the fabric was stretchy but the constriction was so painful for a guy who had never felt balls pain in his life. However, for some reason the feeling was so stimulating that Nick shot another load inside his thong, except that this time it was a huge amount of cum, some even coming out from the fabric.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve made a mess down there, banana boy.&quot; The man smirked. &quot;But I didn&#39;t pay just to see.&quot; He began to take off his clothes. &quot;While I undress, grow your butt. I liked how big your twink friend looked back there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still kneeled and in ecstasy, Nick felt how his ass was pumping. His heels were sinking inside them as fresh dough. Nick can&#39;t stop moaning meanwhile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, I&#39;m ready.&quot; The man said showing proudly his prominent hairy gut. &quot;It&#39;s time to test the merchandise.&quot; He came closer to Nick but the boy was so terrified that he tried to get away. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m not gay... And you look a little disgusting.&quot; Nick babbled as he tried to stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Disgusting, huh?&quot; The man seemed offended. &quot;Why? It&#39;s because of my feet? Yours are bigger.&quot; That wasn&#39;t true at first but Nick&#39;s feet grew to clown proportions after that. &quot;It&#39;s because of my hair? You&#39;re hairier than me!&quot; Nick&#39;s body hair thickened, his beard grew longer and his pubes sprouted through his thighs. He had his arms down but his armpit hair was still visible. &quot;Or it&#39;s because of my size? We&#39;re both big boys&quot; Nick felt his muscles pumping everywhere, his sturdy tree trunk lengs elongating as well as his arms and torso. His back and shoulders hulked out with each breath he made. His feet looking like blocks and his neck melting with his chest, now he was as big and sturdy as the man in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I look like you.&quot; Nick realized his voice had turned terrifying deeper as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Except for one thing.&quot; The man said as he got close to Nick, face to face, and kissed him intensely. &quot;Now you&#39;re gay like me, even if your mind didn&#39;t want it. Remember, your body is mine.&quot; He grabbed Nick&#39;s bulge and Nick felt he was getting turned on by that. &quot;Now, give me some plaesure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick can&#39;t control his own body and began to intensely kiss the man. Their hulk bodies were in contact continuously. Their hands touching each other prominent back, their fat toes dancing as if they have a mind their own. Nick felt it wasn&#39;t right, but he can&#39;t do anything about it. His dick was fully hard and the man was rock hard as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feel it.&quot; The man whispered to him and,  although he didn&#39;t want it, he began to rub the man&#39;s cock. He realized that his pubes had tangled with his. He was disgusted in his mind but in his body, his dick was throbbing in excitement. &quot;It&#39;s a shame I can&#39;t grow myself.&quot; The man said as he began to stroke Nick&#39;s manhood through the fabric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, turn me back!&quot; Nick groaned before he began another deep long kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok.&quot; The man grinned, but distorting Nick&#39;s request, he turned around, bent over and said. &quot;Fuck me!&quot; Nick wasn&#39;t just terrified, he was so disgusted of seeing that man hairy butt hole that he resisted the command. &quot;Come on! Fuck me like a stallion in heat!&quot;<br />
<br />
The man wasn&#39;t talking literally, but Nick&#39;s body was responding to the command. He felt a huge rush of arousal that he literally didn&#39;t waste time to insert his cock on the man. What they both didn&#39;t know it&#39;s that the rules prohibited Nick to take his thong off, so he inserted it as well as weird lycra condom. His huge body began to grow even more as he got horse proportions, his ass bulged monstrously and a long black horse tail popped out from the stretched to the limit fabric. His hands abd feet quickly turned into hooves and his neck reappeared and elongated as his face changed into a muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, STOOP-eighh!!&quot; Were Nick&#39;s last words before he lost his capability to talk. His mane grew along with brown fur along his body. His weight was three times bigger now that he pushed the man to the floor in a four legs position. He neighed in pain when he felt his weiner growing to abnormally huge size, stretching that unlimited stretchable banana hammock even further. His balls were painfully growing as well and the man former moans turned into painful yells for help. Nick&#39;s horsehood was growing inside his anus and they both were scared of where this was going to.</p>
