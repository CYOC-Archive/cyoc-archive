<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was stunned, he'd made his brother become underdeveloped. He'd been willing it to happen, and it did. &quot;Could that mean I have the power to control reality?&quot; he wondered.<br />
<br />
He got to his feet and looked around his room; it wasn't very neat. As a test of his new powers he willed his room to be clean. In the blink of an eye everything was back in its perfect place; his clothes neatly folded in his drawer and his bed perfectly made. Ty grinned at this sight and thought of something else he could try.<br />
<br />
&quot;So if I can do anything, then I wonder if I can...&quot; he said and willed himself to teleport to Dustin's room. As soon as he thought it he found himself abruptly standing in the middle of his brother's room after that he willed himself to return to his room and saw that once again things had happened as he wanted. Then he willed his t-shirt to come off, and in an instant it was lying on the floor, leaving him shirtless. He did the same with his plaid shorts and stood there in his boxers. &quot;So I can manipulate objects, let's see if I can change them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Focusing on his boxers he willed them to become tight boxer-briefs, which they promptly did. He followed up by willing them to become briefs, but have the change occur slightly more slowly. He found it amusing when he saw them receding up his legs until there was nothing left, leaving him in a pair of white briefs. Then he turned them back into dark blue boxers, once again watching them expand, lengthen, loosen and finally take form.<br />
<br />
With that done he decided on trying one last experiment. He willed a simple full-length mirror to appear in front of him, to appear out of thin air, and it did. That truly meant he had power over all reality if he could create matter. &quot;Oh yeah! I really can do anything,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;So first thing's first; I'll better myself, then others.&quot;<br />
<br />
So as Ty gazed into the mirror at his thin frame he began to add muscle to it. His pecs pushed out from his chest and grew until they were perfectly toned and at just the right size; big and solid, but not bulky. His arms followed, growing noticeable biceps whose definition still showed a little when his arms were relaxed, and when he flexed they balled up into great balls of muscle, but once again were as large as they could be without being bulky, being about seventeen inches around. Other muscles followed suite, giving him strong, toned quads and calves with impeccable definition, solid lats and back muscles that gave his back a perfect v-shape, and finally the fat on his stomach vanished and left a perfectly defined six-pack showing on his stomach, that still showed when relaxed. Finally he increased his height, shooting up from 5'4'' to 5'8. Now staring back at him from the mirror was no longer a teenage boy with a thin, underdeveloped body, but a teenage boy with a strong, muscular, athletic build and charmingly handsome face that was both boyishly cute and mannishly handsome.<br />
<br />
He followed this action by tanning his skin a bit until it was a reasonable shade, looking like he spent significant time in the sun. Ty also removed any acne on his face and made his skin perfect. Before willing his clothes back on he grinned mischievously and had his endowment grow until it was large enough to be respectable, but not so large as to be unwieldy and embarrassing. Then he willed his clothes back one, changing his shorts into basketball shorts, and his shoes into hightops. And with that he'd made all the physical changes to himself that he wanted.<br />
<br />
Next Ty worked on some mental changes. He increased his knowledge and skill level of sports until he was pro at virtually any sport on Earth, from soccer to basketball to judo to kung-fu. He could feel all the knowledge suddenly pour in and felt like he could get multiple slam dunks in a row and perform skateboard tricks that would be the envy of everyone at the skatepark. In addition to this he also increased his knowledge and intellect in all subjects at school, from science to English, and proved it worked by easily reciting a passage from Shakespeare to himself. Now not only was he incredibly athletic, but he was also a genius.<br />
<br />
Finally there was his room. Ty didn't really feel the need to change too much, but he did slightly increase its size and upgraded the electronic devices to be the best on the market. He quickly logged onto his sleek new computer and checked Facebook to see his friends list had almost doubled. It seemed he'd managed to alter the past as well, which was good because that was his intention, and was now quite popular at school, being both a star athlete and an honour student. &quot;Good, now that that's all done, I think I'll go out and see what else I can do for the world. I think I'll go to...&quot;</p>
