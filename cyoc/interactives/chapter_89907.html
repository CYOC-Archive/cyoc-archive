<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marty looked at Stan for a moment, knowing that he was right and that scared him. Looking out at the store, seeing everyone appear to stand still made him even weary of being in there in the first place. Everything in there was dangerous and the power one could have because of any of those items was enough to change the very fabric of the world. Marty knew that even though he was apparently chosen to be in the store, he really didn&#39;t want the responsibility that came with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly Stan... things here are a bit too much and I can&#39;t decide on any single item, so I will have to leave and let the powers that be choose something for me.&quot; Marty said, his voice shaking and cracking a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand young man, but be certain of your choice! I told you... the store will choose something for you and you might not like what it is. Then again... it could be the most perfect thing for you and you could end up loving what you become. I do believe that you making the choice would make you happier, but if you are set on leaving... then you may do so. This is the only time we will see one another because this place won&#39;t be available to you again once you leave. This is your one choice to become something of fantasy... since I have a feeling you do love werewolves and transformations into them. Am I wrong?&quot; Stan said while smiling and having a &#39;knowing&#39; tone to his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... you aren&#39;t wrong. I do love werewolves and transformations, but I also don&#39;t think that it is a good idea for me to become one...&quot; Stan explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... and why is this your feelings?&quot; Stan rebutted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... to be honest... I have written several stories about becoming a werewolf and in them, I tend to go toward the dark side and end up slaughtering people indiscriminately.&quot; Marty said, his voice wavering in tone, obviously afraid of something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... then that is why you are here. You are to balance out life. You will be an instrument of death and as a werewolf... you&#39;d be safe from anyone ever pinning it on you. You would also be able to do as you please... something I know you want desperately as those who come here and become a were of any sort chooses.&quot; Stan said smiling to reassure Marty.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean there are people who came here and became weres?&quot; Marty said, his interest piqued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... plenty of times. Though... they have all either been killed mistakenly by hunters or fled into isolation. One thing is... if someone comes here and becomes a were... they get tagged so we can keep tabs on them and I am sad to say... there are no living weres now. The last one was killed mistakenly by a hunter a few years ago on the island you know as Great Britain. He was the only person to choose a wolf and he was killed while he was in full wolf form. He could have been anthro or any other form, but I guess he wanted to run free for a while. Honestly, I can see why you are choosing to leave rather than become a were, but it still is your only chance to choose.&quot; Stan explained and tried to get Marty to see what he was talking about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I know Stan and I do thank you for your effort in this, but again... I&#39;ll take my chances with the powers that be because I do believe that what I need to be, they will make me and I will play my role after becoming what I am meant to.&quot; Marty said as he walked toward the entrance, looking backward and waiving goodbye as he stepped across the threshold.<br />
<br />
As Marty walked toward the threshold, he felt the same pressure of resistance, trying to keep him inside the store until he made his choice. However, instead of relenting like before, Marty pressed onward and felt a sort of heat building inside of him. Marty didn&#39;t stop, he continued to press forward and as he broke through the resistance Marty felt a searing heat course through his body as he yelped from the pain as his friends looked at him curiously.<br />
<br />
Eric looked at Marty with a furled brow and asked, &quot;... and what is your problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... um... nothing. I just got a really bad charlie horse in my leg... that&#39;s all.&quot; Marty said plainly as his expressionless face changed quickly as he grinned sinisterly.<br />
<br />
As they started to walk onward, going to shop and hang out in the mall, Marty grinned as he realized that the store definitely changed him. Before the trip, Marty remembered how he was thinking about what to buy for others, considering Eric&#39;s birthday was right around the corner. However, now he thought only about his self... not to mention as he listened to them all bicker amongst each other like prattling children, he could feel his anger build and the heat that he felt passing through the threshold returned in force... growing stronger by the second, which only furthered his sinister thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I know how I didn&#39;t want to act on those murderous fictional stories in the past, but now... I just wish I could turn into the monstrous werewolf and rip out all of their fucking throats with my bare hands and claws, bathing in their blood!&quot; Marty thought to himself, feeling beastial suddenly, not realizing that his thoughts of becoming the werewolf were fueling his transformation right then and there.<br />
<br />
His ears grew slightly pointed; his bicuspids grew slightly longer and definitely sharper; and his fingernails darkened slightly as they grew out slightly longer and curling. Marty grinned feeling even more sinister as he changed just that small amount and he was definitely eager to see what the Powers That Be chose to bestow upon him.</p>
