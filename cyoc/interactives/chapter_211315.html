<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You turned you&#39;re back on Roy. One of his eyebrows is raised. He&#39;s bordering between the thin line that separates apathy and annoyance. In Edward&#39;s body, Roy is at a daunting height over you. You know he&#39;s only annoyed, but the angle seemed to make him madder than he normally is. You don&#39;t know why, but you&#39;re liking that look on him. &quot;What if I get to have that look, instead?&quot; you thought. <br />
<br />
An idea came to mind. On the zipper, there is this inconspicuous knob. You know this because that&#39;s what the zipper told you. As ridiculous as it may sound, that is what really happened. The zipper whispered in your mind about the ways you can use it. When the knob is pressed, the zipper elongates and pinches off when it grows twice the length. You caught the zipper when it fell out of your back. As you did, you saw how a slider magically appeared out of the teeth. This second zipper is nearly an exact replica of the one attached to your back. Except this one cannot be duplicated and expires after a day when it isn&#39;t attached to a host. <br />
<br />
When Roy saw the zipper on your hand, he immediately caught the gist of what you are about to do. He wasted no words and tried to grab it out of your hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you&#39;re thinking, and no! My body is off limits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please...&quot; You begged. &quot;Just for a little while. I promise I won&#39;t damage your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you. That little while can last for days. Remember when you borrowed my Legend of Selda cartridge.&quot; You&#39;re smaller and weaker, and he pinned you to the ground easily. &quot;You said you&#39;d only borrow it for a few days. You still haven&#39;t returned it! What if you lost my body?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh- what? Your body is more important than that cartridge. I won&#39;t lose your body,&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, you wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
With your arms pinned, and your entire body flat on the ground, you looked for ways to remove yourself from this bind. You realized that you could still move both of your legs. With one fast raise of your leg, you kicked Roy to the nuts. It&#39;s a critical nutcracking hit. He whelped in pain and wept his guts out beside you. In a momentary display of weakness, you jumped on his back and wrapped the zipper around his neck, like a noose. Once both ends of the zipper connected, all of Roy&#39;s weight disappeared. You came crashing on the ground with Roy&#39;s suit emptied out due to your weight. There were no screams or complaints. The room stood silent except for your rhythmic breathing.<br />
<br />
Once you gained your composure, you picked up Roy from the floor. You removed its clothes, leaving nothing but Roy&#39;s pale white skin. The suit is a bit drenched with sweat, probably because of your prior scuffle. It kind of stinks with body odor. And the odor strangely made you hard. You&#39;ve known some people have kinks regarding odor, but you&#39;re pretty sure it isn&#39;t one of yours. Maybe it is Edward&#39;s. As much as you&#39;d like to peer deeper into this carnal desire, you have more pressing matters at hand. <br />
<br />
You pulled the zipper wrapped around Roy&#39;s neck. His head disconnected from the body, but there&#39;s a magnetic knob on the zipper that would allow you to attach the two in the right spot. This leaves you with Roy&#39;s empty head, and his empty body. Seeing that you&#39;re quite fond of Roy&#39;s face before, you chose to wear the head first. You pulled the skin of the head over your face. There was momentary darkness as you&#39;ve experienced before. When you blinked back to life, you felt this additional weight over your shoulders. You assumed that it was the weight of Roy&#39;s head, and you assumed correctly when you reached the mirror. Your head is way too big for the body. It&#39;s comical, to say the least. You&#39;re a bubble head, like the ones your uncle likes to collect.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; You said in Roy&#39;s usual begrudging tone. The way you said those words sold your acting. &quot;Edward, dress up right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
You snickered to yourself. What a day this was. Just this morning you were picking artifacts from a magic shop. And now? You&#39;re wearing your best friend&#39;s face, while you have his younger brother&#39;s body. You look like Frankenstein&#39;s monster. Aside from the zipper teeth that separate the head from the body, there is also a drastic change in skin tone between Edward&#39;s body and Roy&#39;s head. Roy is a lot paler since he hates to go outside unless necessary. <br />
<br />
Funny as it may be, you don&#39;t want to stay in this form for too long since it&#39;s putting a strain on your shoulders. You picked Roy&#39;s body and wore it like a jumpsuit. There was no darkness this time. You could see in real-time as the suit puffs up so it would become a tight fit on you. Bones were made, muscles fastened, and now you stand as twice as a taller as before. Maybe even taller than your original body. Roy stared back at you with a smile on the reflection, which you immediately molded into his usual scowl. It&#39;s still strange seeing your reflection as someone else. You&#39;ve spent about 19 years of your life getting used to your face, and now you&#39;re seeing the face of another follow your every whim. <br />
<br />
You spun around and observed your new body. Roy is your typical white suburban boy. He goes from job to job, leaving him with no time to improve his body in a gym. He&#39;s tall with no muscle definition. Unless you could call the slight pudge in his stomach a definition. His skin is pale with freckled mottled on his chest and back. His hair is black and kept short since he claims it saves him time because he doesn&#39;t need to comb anymore. As for his package between the legs, it&#39;s about average size. It&#39;s whiter than your original dick, and the balls have a prominent pink shade to them. You marbled it with your fingers and felt tickles on your spine. Roy must be masturbating every day with this dick. What does he think about when he does his release? Too bad you can&#39;t find out. The zipper might let you have the body, but the mind remains shut. <br />
<br />
The only problem with how you look right now is the conspicuous zipper that runs a lap around your neck. Lucky for you, there&#39;s another knob that lets you peel it off, and attach it to the ridges of your spine. You don&#39;t want to leave it unattached since it will expire to dust in an hour. If that happens, you&#39;d be stuck as Roy forever. </p>
