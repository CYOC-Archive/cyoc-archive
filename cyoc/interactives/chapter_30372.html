<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alisa was busy watering the flowers that grew wild in her backyard. She had been planning to go to the beach today, but her flake boyfriend called at the last minute citing a nasty hangover as the reason he &quot;just couldn't do it today.&quot; Well, it would be a while before she would &quot;do it&quot; with him again. Even now, she was wearing her bikini-style bathing suit. She figured she could get some sun here as well as she could at the beach. <br />
<br />
The slamming of a door to her left caused her to jump, her inward train of thought derailed, and look over. Someone was sauntering out of her neighbors' house, someone, she was certain, she'd never seen before. His body assured her that he was a man. He was tall, but that effect was tempered by the rest of him. He was thickly muscled and had a large taut belly. He was also quite covered with hair. Alisa could see all this because he was only wearing a tight pair of shorts that perfectly revealed...she blushed at the thought. Yes, he was definitely a man. But his eyes; they told her that he was also quite young, younger than he appeared, even though he carried himself so strongly and confidently...<br />
<br />
It was while she was contemplating this that she realized he was striding toward her. She was about to say something, but her voice died in her throat, barely admitting what could be called a squeak.<br />
<br />
Josh stood in front of his neighbor, beefy arms folded over his prodigious gut with a slight smile playing across his lips. Her eyes were alight, but her mouth was partially open, and the hose she had been using to water her plants hung limply by her side, still producing water. She seemed to have forgotten how to talk. Josh, on the other hand, was at war within himself. He was still only twelve years old, no matter how he looked, but whatever this spell had done to him, he seemed to be losing himself. He was trying to stop what he knew was coming, but he couldn't. And the part that was trying, was continuously slipping into the part that was doing. His new urges could not, and would not, be denied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, there,&quot; he said in his smooth, deep voice. This seemed to snap Alisa out of whatever it was that was holding her. Her heart was pounding now, her throat was dry. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, hi,&quot; she breathed. She could smell something now. It had been faint when this guy had first come up to her, but it was getting stronger and stronger. Whether it was that, or something else, Alisa was feeling like she never had before. And it was because, she knew, of this man...<br />
<br />
Ric and Mr. Mendes were watching from inside the house. They couldn't hear anything, but it was clear that the spell's effects were true. Ric was grinning broadly, clearly pleased with what was happening. Mr. Mendes, however, was still shocked by all he had seen in the last few minutes. While Ric was watching out the window, Mr. Mendes picked up the apparent spell book to look it over.<br />
<br />
He reread what he had heard Ric read aloud. But he also read something at the bottom of the page. &quot;Useful for raising armies quickly. Women should be watched and nourished during the day-long gestation. Newborns will reach fighting age in one week.&quot; And then, added in the bottom corner, more recently it seemed, &quot;Dangerous! If left un-checked, the subject of this spell can only be stopped by death. Standard reversal methods work best before first impregnation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mendes felt the pit of his stomach drop out just as he heard Ric say, &quot;Way to go, Joshy-boy!&quot; Mendes looked out the window to see Alisa, his neighbor, and what was once a twelve-year-old boy locked in a sensuous display of affection. His mind raced. He needed to reverse the spell quickly, before it was too late!</p>
