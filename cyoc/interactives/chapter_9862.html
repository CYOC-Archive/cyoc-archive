<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris was not willing to be a gorilla and spend four years peeling Bananas. He'd seen enough, with a jerk of his arm he broke Beth Anne's hold. A quick look told of his fear as she broke into a smile.<br />
<br />
Turning to run the tunnel on Chris said not a word but put on foot in front of another. Faster and faster he walked away from Beth Anne who just stood there with a nasty smile.<br />
<br />
As Chris broke into a run he witnessed many scenes she might have pushed him into. After the Jungle scene he saw a Satyr's orgy with one Satyress beckoning him to join. He ran on as a auction was in the next window, slowing he almost paused but ran on.<br />
<br />
The pleasent scene of a barnyard and children playing with their dog alured him, but it's peace was not really true. Again he moved on and the scene of a quite lake made him stop for a breath of it's fresh air.<br />
<br />
Chris looked at the peaceful scene but to step in was to be in the water. Turning again he jogged on not seeing or even hearing Beth Anne at all.<br />
<br />
The next window showed a bedroom looking very much as if his own. The paint, the floor all was as if he'd just let it. Yet the computer was left on and he strained to see what was scrolling over the screen. &quot;If Wishers Were Horses&quot; it said, a strange and wonderous statement!<br />
<br />
&quot;No, No!&quot; said Chris that can't be my room and he ran on down the tunnel. A fresh breeze met his face once again and stopping he looked out this window. One dark deep green forest lay out as far as the eye could see. Sounds of birds mixed with cries of animals as Chris stood and looked about. A peaceful scene he thought till from a tree's branch jumped a black cat. It dived down pouncing on a young deer. The scene was of the laws which worked in a jungle, forest, or even back home.<br />
<br />
On he went again as a window offered the view of a Artic scene with polar bears, seals, and all looking at Chris.<br />
<br />
Quickly he ran on, as the next window offered a wide scene of the central African plains. The thousands of loose and wandering animals again made him slow but he wanted freedom and not any place like these!<br />
<br />
The stench of manure both strong and saltery hit his nose as he peered out the opening at a Hog breeding farm. Pens upon pens with small quansit huts for cover from the Summer's sun. A pool each of mired mud to wallow and the company of sows with boars and more with more Hogs just everywhere. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn this place!&quot; Chris grumbled was there never a way out.<br />
<br />
The next window presented itself as he saw men climbing from a beached boat. As they walked up the beach a lady mounted on a white horse approached. Chris listened to he soft voice and kind offer of food, wine, and refined comfort. The group followed her inland talking, planning of their meal and ultimate pleasures. As he watched the scene changed to one as if standing on the marble porch of this Queen's castle. Maids scrambled about making ready for those coming to diner. It was then one of the Maids came close to the window asking Chris to join the party.<br />
<br />
Scared from the sudden notice of his watching he turned and ran again deeper into the tunnel.<br />
<br />
The sounds of a man screaming in pain echoed the tunnel as Chris stopped to again peer into a scene. A South seas island, one forted up house and several buildings all painted white. The fort was surrounded by creatures half man half animal, they sauntered about growling, squealing, and barking as if angered. <br />
<br />
Screaming continued as the scene changed to one inside the fort. A pretty young woman walked about seemingly also nervous by the man's screaming. She stopped and looked directly at Chris, &quot;Please help me escape less I or you be next!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris was about to offer her a hand when the scene changed showing the security guard helping a dark figure off the exam table and into a steel barred cell. A tall lanky man stood in a wite Lab coat and black dress pants. He held a seringe and was filling it as he looked directly at Chris. &quot;Come and lay down on the exam table! Come I've prepared something here which will give you the strength of a Buffalo!' said the obvious Doctor. Then the other man chimed in and with a sad look offered his wisdom. &quot;Sure come in, lay down, and learn to live as a Buffalo cause that's just what you'll be Fool!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris bolted down the tunnel and felt the cold wind which chilled him once again. The window opened to a rocky scene of mountains and crags of rock. Suddenly from out of sight came a small herd of Mountain goats, nannies all and they stopped to look back at Chris. One large black goat jumped from rock to crag standing just a few feet from Chris. &quot;Come, please we all are in need of one sound male like you!&quot; said the nanny goat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope!&quot; was Chris's reply as he pressed on wondering if this place ever had an end.<br />
<br />
A look back made him smile a little as the tunnel seemed to curve. A wonderful thought touched Chris as this might be built in a circle and he'd come out where he went inside.<br />
<br />
Scenes and more scenes offered other places but he knew this would exit into the Main street once again. At last the sounds of tinkling metal as he looked out into the Main street of Pleasure Island. It was dark and hours after the last lucky person hand exited the Park. <br />
<br />
Before him was the main street and to one side was a large wooden wagon. A man was hitching up a large draft horse to one side the yoke, then walking off scene it gave Chris his chance to get by without anyone's notice. A quick look behind saw not Beth Anne or anybody.<br />
<br />
Chris stepped past the scene's window gateway and stood looking about. The damp cool air brought a welcomed chill to his skin. The big horse looked at him a nickered softly. Then from behind him came the worker. Chris turned to look at him just as the man spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to get going, Beth Anne is hitched and so will you be there Chris!&quot; told the man.<br />
<br />
Chris took in such a huge breath at being discovered he then started toward the street. A sharp pain in his mouth stopped him far short, he turned as the man flopped a harness over his broad hairy back. Turning his head this way and that he saw a big mistake, he was a draft horse hitched to a wagon and was now a part of the Pleasure Island Scene.</p>
