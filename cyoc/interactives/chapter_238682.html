<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Any afterglow to be had was short lived with a knock on the door, getting both men to freeze up. &quot;Master Wright? Master Wright, breakfast has been ready and will be getting cold soon,&quot; Philip spoke through the door.<br />
<br />
Miles scrunched his face before rubbing it. &quot;Philip works a half day on Sundays, just...&quot; But James was already up and wrapping a towel around his waist. Or trying to at least, being too big for that sort of thing. Miles watched him fumble with his beefy legs and smiled at the show before shaking his head and getting up to give him his robe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a minute!&quot; Miles shouted out before getting a look from James. Processing for a second he tensed up, James interjected. &quot;Robe got misplaced,&quot; he added before tying it tight and reaching the door, Miles retreating to the closet. James stepped out, trying to squeeze through the door instead of opening it fully, also not adjusted to how fruitless doing so was for someone his size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I.... uh....&quot; James fumbled with the door, Philip looking him up and down. &quot;I&#39;ve just... had a long morning...&quot; he tried, standing up straight as if he was trying to explain himself. &quot;Master Wright....&quot; Philip started, studying the man. &quot;Is....&quot;<br />
<br />
James waited, raising a brow before Philip shook his head and raised his hand. &quot;Your breakfast. It&#39;s on the table. Extra protein as requested, and I added some almonds to help with your bulking,&quot; he said, about to turn and head off. &quot;Uhm... thank you, but.... Philip? What were you about to ask?&quot; James pushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just... I wasn&#39;t sure if there was anyo...anything else you needed me to take care of,&quot; he explained, getting James to think for a bit. Where Philip was of the habit of escorting Miles&#39;s hookups to the front, James took a bit of a different approach. &quot;Oh, no, I... well actually, could you help me make something for Mi.... James? I... can&#39;t remember what... we have,&quot; he said. Seemed like a good cover for not knowing where anything was.<br />
<br />
Philip stared for a bit and squinted at the man, looking him up and down, squinting harder. &quot;Y... yes, I... we can probably scrape something together for Master.... uhm....&quot; Philip trailed off. &quot;O&#39;Deorain,&quot; James filled in. &quot;Yes, of course. There should be enough for another plate if he doesn&#39;t have any dietary restrictions,&quot; Philip stated, still studying James up and down.<br />
<br />
James just smiled and patted him. &quot;Great! But you don&#39;t need to do anything else, just fill me in on what we&#39;ve got,&quot; he said, making his way down the hall past Philip. &quot;Master Wright?&quot; Philip asked. &quot;Philip you don&#39;t have to be so formal you know,&quot; James said, still walking. &quot;Yes of course Ma.... Miles. Why are you taking the long way to the kitchen?&quot;<br />
<br />
James halted, turning around and walking back. &quot;Y... yeah. Of course. Lead the way,&quot; he said as conversationally as possible, his face going red. Philip was still giving him a hard up and down. &quot;Miles. This young man, he hasn&#39;t.... you&#39;re not getting into any old habits, are you...?&quot; Philip asked. James wasn&#39;t sure how to answer that one, nor was he picking up on what those old habits were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Philip, it hasn&#39;t been that long since I&#39;ve had a boyfriend,&quot; James teased and gave Philip a pat on the back, trying to walk in another direction down the hall to push the topic away from Miles&#39;s past. Whatever dark secrets Miles had he&#39;d rather get it from the source than anyone else. Philip just stood there for a bit, blinking and wide eyed before nodding and following his employer.<br />
<br />
XXX<br />
<br />
Back in the walk in closet, Miles was taking a short tour to visit the safe James had been referring to. Took a bit of trial and error given the amount of racks of black dress pants there apparently were as well as Miles grimacing over the thousands he had to have spent on high end fashion that was now gathering dust before coming across the one safe he had in this closet.<br />
<br />
Miles patted it and knocked on it a few times, confident this was the one before leaning into it and trying to give it a push. The safe didn&#39;t budge, and may well have weighed even more than he did now. &quot;Bet James could push it around,&quot; Miles said offhandedly to nobody, smiling a bit at the visual of his boyfriend hoisting it over his shoulder and showing off for him with a flexed bicep before heaving the safe into the oce-<br />
<br />
Miles shook his head and shut his eyes. They were still feeling this out and needed to figure this all out. As pressing as reality was though his inner bottom had no qualms about fantasizing this situation going permanent and being that big muscle daddy&#39;s babe for the rest of their days.<br />
<br />
It took a deep breath and some affirmations to calm down before Miles swallowed and focused, coming to a mirror to give himself another look. That young smooth face that could use some more sun, the ginger curls and wiry limbs, green eyes like emeralds to contrast the sharp cold sapphires the real James had now over in his old body.<br />
<br />
Miles took the time looking himself up and down and stood up straight to both admire himself and get a gauge on what he had to work with. They still hadn&#39;t covered how long they&#39;d be staying this way but until that wasn&#39;t an indefinite period, this was his body. They&#39;d need to go shopping later since all his old clothes would look like blankets on how much mass he had to work with.<br />
<br />
&quot;For now...&quot; Miles said to nobody, the back of his head running numbers on what sort of macros James probably needed to get a bulk going. Even if he kept up the bottoming he could stand to pack on a bit, get some abs and pecs of his own. Give it a decade and get this little Irish fairy to the size of some brutal hot blooded muscleheaded highlander. James would go wild for that, no question.<br />
<br />
Giving his rear a slap while picturing how much better it&#39;d be suckin&#39; up that huge meat James was stuck with if it had some more of its own muscle, Miles smiled while going through the different racks and drawers. While dress clothing and suits were out of the question he had to have some workout clothes with a less fixed fit or....<br />
<br />
Miles was finally able to find a drawer full of elastic tights and compression shirts. Perfect for when he was looking to show off all that beef given its tight cling. Miles started working himself into a neutral pair and slipped into it pretty smoothly, turning about and looking himself in the mirror. He felt himself heat up at how much perk this put on his butt, his hardon obvious through the elastic, unable to stop from smiling.<br />
<br />
It had been ages since Miles had been out dancing but damn if he didn&#39;t wanna go out on James&#39; arm in this. Show up in one of his newest cars, nice dress shirt over a loose tank with his man in a beefy leather jacket hiding some mesh and jeans with an athletic fit, getting every man in a mile radius jealous of this perfect gay couple.<br />
<br />
Miles couldn&#39;t help but moan a bit, still sore from having ridden James not even an hour ago with the heat of his man&#39;s load still heavy in him. There was still so much to be working out but all he could think about was how much fun he was going to be having going forward.<br />
<br />
Eventually having to pull himself away from the fantasizing but unable to get rid of his smile, Miles stepped out of the closet and into the hall, having some fresh clothes. Instead of following to the kitchen though he instead made his way to the bathroom, going through the drawers until finding some hair gel and a metal styling comb.<br />
<br />
Shaking some drops and greasing his hands, Miles ran his fingers through his curls and scratched his scalp a few times before taking the comb and reigning it in, massaging those curls back a few times until getting a good smooth flow out of them.<br />
<br />
Giving himself another look in the mirror, Miles smiled and brought one curl back at the front for a bit of flare and mischief. Whatever boyish innocence James had built up for himself when this had been his body, Miles was the subby twink in there now. Even if he was still coming in to his need to be filled and pleased, he was still his own person. He had his own wants and needs and a big beefcake of a man to suck on and plough him like a field every night.<br />
<br />
Miles swallowed and shut his eyes to let his thoughts play out. They&#39;d keep coming and he was conscious of them more and more the longer this went. He couldn&#39;t keep lying to himself about it just being a role, they were needs he&#39;d never known of until he&#39;d been put in this rather unique situation. James was a muscled up beast and ticking so many boxes he never knew he had and just the thought of being held by that man&#39;s pythons was getting his knees weak and his boyish face beaming.<br />
<br />
Opening his eyes to make eye contact with his reflection, Miles squinted looking himself up and down. Miles the luckiest twink in the world. Miles the personal cum dumpster for James the CEO. Miles.... was still who he was. Just as James was still just a kid in spite of them trading at least a hundred pounds and a few million in finances.<br />
<br />
More things to figure out for later but.... things were still okay. Miles felt more relaxed the more he reflected and soaked in his cute little face, brushing his hands across it. Little bit of stubble like he would have had at this age. What he hadn&#39;t had at that age was a gorgeous tanned horned up bull to fuck him senseless a few times a day.<br />
<br />
That got a smirk out of Miles, thinking of James that way. He was the kind of stud now Miles would have jerked off to as a teen deep in the closet but he still had a bit of work to do before he could really strut. Not unlike the bulk Miles was already scheming for his new body, James would have his own growing to get through. He could do it though. James was like him. A hard worker and an honest man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph. Honest? You?&quot; something said in the back of his head, getting Miles to drop his bashful smile and look down, grumbling. Fine, hard working. James was honest and deserving. The better man was now the bigger man.<br />
<br />
Miles actually started to sulk a bit, his hand coming up to hold his other arm while his lips tightened. He&#39;d been on such a high for how much he was coming into with himself and how different his life was going to be with James and it.... couldn&#39;t be that picturesque.<br />
<br />
Being CEO for a few work days was one thing but taking it on fully... taking on everything Miles had been handling fully.... Miles the luckiest twink and bottom boi for his 10 of a CEO boyfriend grit his teeth and took a big breath, trying to process it all. He was getting a sweet n&#39; tight little frame of cloud nine pleasure from head to toe and a gorgeous powerful beefcake to take care of him and that beefcake got...<br />
<br />
Taking another deep breath and straightening up his posture, Miles looked himself in the eye again before grunting and nodding. They weren&#39;t switching back, at least not any time soon. Looking at just the short term, both of them were too hooked on the current arrangement to believably go back to who they&#39;d been.<br />
<br />
But hopping into this wasn&#39;t going to be nice and neat. Just as he&#39;d come into so many needs that James was filling, James was going to need him. For sex, for information, for stability, and so on. They would have to be a team just as much as they were going to be a couple.<br />
<br />
XXX<br />
<br />
&quot;That should cover everything,&quot; Philip finished off, James nodding. He&#39;d tried to wait but it was kicking in how much his body needed, having forked down all three plates Philip had made for him while being walked through the kitchen. &quot;Great, he uh... doesn&#39;t eat a ton, so I think I&#39;ll be able to take care of him. IT,&quot; James said, flinching a bit before looking to the side. Saying him was fine, why had he backpedaled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma.... sir,&quot; Philip started, getting James to blink. Sir was still a bit weird, but he didn&#39;t want to push Philip. &quot;If you&#39;d like it wouldn&#39;t be too much to prepare another omellette. You keep a surplus of eggs in stock after all,&quot; he said. &quot;No, no, I&#39;ll take care of it. You&#39;ve already stayed past your window, I couldn&#39;t do that to your time off,&quot; James insisted, patting Philip on the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate it sir but... it&#39;s just.... it&#39;s been awhile since you&#39;ve been serious with anyone so....&quot; Philip was trying to find the words while James got ready with the skillet, being plenty capable with food preparation now that he knew where everything was. &quot;This man, Master O&#39;Deorain... you said he was how old?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;22,&quot; James listed off, actually being confronted with the age difference for a second. 15 years. He was 37 now. Physically at least. But on the other side of that he was a 22 year old dating a 37 year old. He&#39;d never realized how much of a cradle robber Miles was being. That.... he was now being.<br />
<br />
James had to look up and think for a bit on this, slowing down before shrugging. Miles kept such a healthy body he probably had more of a life span to work with anyhow, so it was hardly anything to be concerned about. Biggest concern would be the different references and jokes they&#39;d both be making to each other. Couldn&#39;t be that many differences between zoomer and millennial culture, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;And you said he&#39;s interning for you?&quot; Philip asked, interrupting the different trains of thought James had been juggling. &quot;He has been but with how it&#39;s been going he&#39;ll probably be switching to a full time position,&quot; James said, doing well at listing off what had been his career plan from the third person, dropping a bit of shredded cheese and turkey slices into the pan. &quot;Probably more secure in that after he&#39;s gotten into the chief executive officer&#39;s pants...&quot; Philip said a bit low, getting James to stop and look back at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... he... it&#39;s not like that,&quot; James was able to say, a bit caught off guard. It hurt, sure, particularly out of knowing he was the one being talked about, but it was also the notion their dynamic had been that in any way. &quot;I mean. It&#39;s been about two months and those first few days definitely had that somewhere but h... I was using him... too....&quot; James tried to rationalize, clearly struggling.<br />
<br />
Philip though was looking at him more and continuing to study him. He wasn&#39;t wrong to be suspicious but he could also tell a number of differences in Miles. The heartless serial player his employer had been for years wasn&#39;t this actual person in front of him, trying to get his thoughts out while he made an omellete for his partner. What was more, he&#39;d never seen Miles this defensive of whom he&#39;d brought home, or for that matter treat his staff like actual people.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir,&quot; he finally said, stepping up and putting a hand on the man&#39;s broad back. &quot;Tell me. There&#39;s nothing amiss or to be worried over with this man? It&#39;s more than you actually committing to anyone, you seem... different,&quot; he finally said. James was facing away from him to focus on the omellete, and kept doing that to hide the panic on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;He.... he works hard. And tells the truth. He&#39;s going through so much to help his mom and brother and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll meet them someday but he&#39;s also just been easy to work with and talk with,&quot; James tried. &quot;And the more we&#39;ve talked I can tell how much he&#39;s started learning about himself. How much I&#39;m learning about myself. And it&#39;s just.... nice. And it&#39;s different,&quot; he said. It wasn&#39;t some grand speech about the power of love, but all he&#39;d been able to find when cornered like this were his genuine thoughts on Miles.<br />
<br />
And there was the matter of switching bodies and getting intoxicated on being a sculpted muscle monster that only got amplified by his thirsty twink of a boyfriend being a third of his size with several times his libido pushing his buttons every time he walked in the room and flashed that perfect peach at him and the bottomless well of spunk that was his equipment. Without any good way to bring this up though, James just added some extra pepper to the omellete and shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t rushed into anything, it&#39;s been two months. And we&#39;ll keep taking it slow,&quot; he said, flipping the omellete. Philip seemed satisfied with this, but he still stepped forward to push the big man into a hug. James was very caught off guard by this but still hugged back and made sure to not squeeze, unsure how old Philip was. Or for that matter just how much strength he had now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy for you. And him. And I do trust you. I don&#39;t want to speak out of line, being your employee, but-&quot; Philip was going off, leaving the hug. &quot;Philip, it&#39;s okay. I appreciate it. And I know you care about me, I care about you too,&quot; James said back. He wasn&#39;t sure if that was necessarily accurate of how the dynamic had gone between Philip and Miles but it was how it was going to be going forward. At least while he was in the driver&#39;s seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Miles. I&#39;d refrained from saying so while you were in this phase of sorts but I have cared for you like my own nonetheless,&quot; Philip said, patting his boss&#39;s big hefty shoulder. &quot;It should come to pass that I properly screen anyone taking up said responsibility,&quot; he said, bringing his hand back and dusting his jacket off. &quot;Thanks &#39;dad&#39;,&quot; James teased, patting Philip back who tensed and raised his shoulders. Philip instead just scowled but still nodded and dusted himself off, pivoting away.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s all then I&#39;ll leave you two be,&quot; he stated, smiling a small amount and exiting the kitchen. James hoped he hadn&#39;t said anything out of line, making sure to learn more about how things were between the two of them. And also potentially a priority to get Philip a Father&#39;s Day gift the next time it rolled around, depending on what sort of role he&#39;d actually played in Miles&#39;s life up to this point.<br />
<br />
That was all for later of course. The omellete was nearly done, and having the kitchen to himself, James had spotted an apron hanging in the pantry. Making his way in that direction while ditching his bathrobe, James was looking to cook up a good amount for Miles, what with how much he&#39;d put him through in the first few hours of their relationship.</p>
