<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few moments of eternity passed with Zoe and Casey in each other&#39;s arms, embraced and close in a way neither of them could even remotely have thought possible: as passionate lovers, as inhuman demons...and as themselves still, with souls uncorrupted. As their newly-infused succubs sides gradually stepped down from the highs of their mutual pleasuring as they gently removed their demonic tails from the other&#39;s pussy, their heavy breathing gradually slowed down as well, allowing Casey her first chance to look around and take in just what kind of situation she had agreed to jump into for the sake of her friend. At first look, of course, it was bewildering: she was face-to-face with a crimson-skinned humanoid with two horns coming out of her head, sharp cheeks and jaws that somehow didn&#39;t completely hide the fact that it was the face of her friend (and now her lover?) she was looking at -- it was probably the eyes, which while sharper than the rounded orbs she had before still retained Zoe&#39;s blue hue. Casey could feel the arms holding her around the back, both inhumanly strong and inhumanly soft, a reflection of the seemingly contradictory situation they had found themselves in. The strange circular marking placed above Zoe&#39;s expanded cleavage glowed faintly, the image mirrored as Casey&#39;s eyes lowered to see her own doing the same on both counts with her now-blue skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Casey?&quot; Zoe&#39;s voice brought her attention back up, the subtle echoing reverb in it underlining the inhuman power that lay within even as the tone was soft and comforting. &quot;Are you OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...Zoe, that...&quot; Casey trailed off, herself caught a little off-guard at hearing her own voice mimic that subtle echoing of demonic power. That was just enough to quiet the part of her that wanted to remain in her...patron&#39;s embrace forever, as curiosity about the full extent of her new form took hold. She let go of Zoe and stepped back to get some space to look around, Zoe letting going and giving it as soon as she realized as well. Casey&#39;s legs, while having also gained mass and tone compared to her human form, were more slender than Zoe&#39;s; her own arms were similar. The claws on the tips of her fingers and toes were also a tad smaller than Zoe&#39;s, though in a straight-up fight they&#39;d still be formidable. It wasn&#39;t all bad, though -- her new breasts were bigger than Zoe&#39;s, something which Casey confirmed by cupping one of them with a hand and letting out a low moan as she (maybe) inadvertently teased her new physical form. (For her part, even Zoe couldn&#39;t help but feel her own mix of jealousy at Casey&#39;s new assets as well, as desire to check them out for herself, though she held back for now.)<br />
<br />
Casey turned around for a moment to try to get a glimpse of the other two things she gained. She was soon able to figure out how to control her new demon tail to curl it around to her front (after accidentally brushing it along her now-very-sensitive-pussy and riding another wave of need), getting a good look at it up close for the first time as she held the tip in her hands, feeling how hard the bone-like structure inside was, how moist it was still from having penetrated Zoe before, the faint smell of her inner juices lingering on it -- Casey was, if she was honest, rather embarrassed at both how forward she had been during the whole thing as well as how she low-key still wanted to do it again so soon -- man, Zoe wasn&#39;t kidding when she said this was unlike anything she had experienced before.<br />
<br />
Try as she might, her new succubus body didn&#39;t have much more neck-turning ability than a normal human, so all Casey could see over her shoulder of her new wings were glimpses of their edges -- luckily, the back of her front door had a mirror hanging on it, which let Casey look back at the missing parts. Even her new wings -- leathery, bony, demonic, scary in most circumstances -- held a strangely alluring property to them. And her face...like Zoe, Casey&#39;s had become sharper, more alluring, yet was still recognizably her own. Still-human brown eyes looked back, at once both out-of-place and stubbornly holding on in the demonic sea change Casey had jumped into for her friend&#39;s sake. &quot;My God...&quot; <br />
<br />
Casey&#39;s eyes widened in shock at her own words, glancing back at Zoe who just seemed to have a bemused look on her face. &quot;I&#39;ll be honest -- I still don&#39;t really know how all this works, Casey. But I mean it when I say thank you...for helping me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank me? No, thank you, Zoe! I...that was the most wonderful thing I&#39;ve ever had! I mean, yeah, the whole transforming into a demon thing is freaky, but it was sooo good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re not human anymore, Casey! You&#39;re a demon now. A succubus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and even though I&#39;m feeling all this power, these new feelings, I still feel like myself. I&#39;m still me, like you&#39;re still you.&quot; Casey placed a hand over the Seal on her chest, her other sensually yet gingerly running along her new body to take it all in again. &quot;Feels like it&#39;s feeding me this power, but in a steady way, you know? Like I can control it. Do this on my terms.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoe let a genuine smile form on her lips, out of gratitude for Casey&#39;s words, out of relief that as best she could tell her friend was still here, out of satisfaction that they had yet proven that spirit wrong again, out of eagerness that she had someone to share this great yet dangerous secret with. The smile faded away to concern as she eyed Casey&#39;s hand come to rest on her toned abdomen, circling around it a little bit. &quot;Casey? Something up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Zoe, I wanted to ask. When we first, um, kissed, I saw a ton of images in my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lots of sex, right?&quot; Casey nodded. &quot;Yeah, it did that to me, too. I think that&#39;s part of what they do to corrupt you. Make you think of nothing else.&quot; Even now, the images would pop up in Zoe&#39;s head now and then, trying to distract her. &quot;Is it still happening to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm. Not as much as before, but yeah. A lot of images of...big bellies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Big bellies? Like...fat? Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with that,&quot; Zoe added quickly. Far be it for Zoe to shame anyone for what they like, especially given everything that&#39;s happened now -- it was just not something Zoe and Casey ever really talked so frankly about before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not really that, more...growing. And feeling it grow.&quot; Casey placed her hand firmly on her stomach. &quot;I want get pregnant, Zoe. I want to have a baby.&quot; Her eyes immediately widened for a moment upon hearing her own words, before her hands dropped to her sides. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, that was...that was out of nowhere. It must have sounded weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoe took a moment to absorb all that in. &quot;Weird? Casey, we&#39;ve grown horns, tails, wings, big boobs, and the sex drive of nymphomaniacs, and yet we&#39;ve somehow not lost ourselves to demons trying to corrupt our souls and become ravenous monsters.&quot; Zoe stepped forward and embraced Casey, ignoring the sensual feelings of their naked bodies touching in favor of comforting the mind and soul within them; her wings stretched around her back to join in the hug while her tail did the same to hold Casey&#39;s (away from their previous resting places). &quot;We&#39;re already weird. But we still got our souls, and we still got each other. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re along with this crazy-ass ride with me, Casey.&quot; So glad...<br />
<br />
Eventually the pair broke the tight embrace, though their arms were still around each other. It just felt nice. &quot;As for the pregnancy thing...well, I know you&#39;ve talked about starting a family before. I don&#39;t know how any of this works, but I made a promise to share this gift of fulfilling the deepest desires of others, even while swearing never to do it irresponsibly. You were here for me when I needed you talking about this whole crazy thing. I owe you so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re my friend, Zoe,&quot; Casey replied. &quot;And after all we just went through, I&#39;d say we&#39;re...more than that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Friends with benefits?&quot;<br />
<br />
Casey glanced down at their very different bodies. &quot;These are some kind of benefits!&quot; They both let out a small laugh before Casey resumed. &quot;No, but, I mean...you and me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As lovers? Two souls joined in common bond, to help each other on this new mysterious path we forge?&quot;<br />
<br />
Casey blinked. &quot;Yeah. When did you get so poetic?&quot;<br />
<br />
Zoe shrugged. &quot;I dunno.&quot; She leaned in towards Casey. &quot;But I know where to start on my promises.&quot; <br />
<br />
As their lips met, emotional pleasure poured in on the new couple along with the physical. Zoe could feel a new energy within her bubbling, their mutual leap of faith starting to coalesce towards the next step in achieving Casey&#39;s desire.</p>
