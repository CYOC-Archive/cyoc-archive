<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason stepped into Colleen's room and looked around. Her mother had explained that she wasn't feeling well and that he could leave her books and homework from school on her bed. Heading up to her room, Jason hoped that she was not contagious, but when he reached her room he found it to be empty.<br />
<br />
Curious, he called out, &quot;Colleen?&quot; To which there was no answer and shrugging, he dumped the books and homework on her bed.<br />
<br />
Turning, he was about to leave when he noticed the computer and the program pulled up. Jason was never one to snoop and he cared for Colleen like a sister...something that confused him because he thought he should be in love with her, seeing as she was female and he was male.<br />
<br />
Sitting down at the computer, his confusion of what he should feel toward Colleen forgotten for the moment, he looked at the program and then began to scroll.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, Colleen's mom called, &quot;Jason? Is everything all right up there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blushing, forgetting that nobody could see him, Jason hastily stood and replied, &quot;Yeah. I'm just getting something Colleen left me. It's on her computer. I shan't be more than a couple of minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
A confirming word from Colleen's mother as Jason reached over and selected one of the blank discs. Inserting it into the drive, he copied the program and then slipped it into his pocket. Turning, he exited the room and headed downstairs. In the living room, Colleen's mother asked, &quot;Everything all right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason nodded and explained, &quot;I'll be back tomorrow if there is any new homework and Colleen is still not feeling better.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod from Colleen's mother and Jason excused himself out the front door. Outside, he began to walk slowly home. As he did, he let his mind wander. At the top of his list was the way he felt.<br />
<br />
At eleven years old, and on the cusp of puberty, Jason was confused. Mostly it had to do with the way he felt around girls. Most boys his age were already thinking of dates and things they wanted to do with girls. Jason didn't feel this way. He felt comfortable around girls, like he was one of them...but this train of thought only confused him.<br />
<br />
His other problem was that sometimes he felt like asking a boy out, which he clearly saw as wrong. The only way he could feel comfortable and push these weird feelings away was to sometimes dress in his sister's clothes.<br />
<br />
One year older than him, Jason found that Vicky's clothes fit him nicely and would often wear her nightgowns to bed or wear her underwear. Dwelling on this, his thoughts turned to the tight, yellow, low-cut bikini briefs he was wearing at the moment and wondered if Vicky knew that he liked to wear her clothes.<br />
<br />
Looking up, he realised that his thoughts had taken him all the way home. Entering, he listened and feeling and hearing the silence of the house, he kicked off his shoes and headed for his room.<br />
<br />
There he booted up his computer and inserted the copy of the Chronivac Version 4.0. An installation box appeared and after that the program pulled up the main menu. Before he could get started, a window popped up, telling him that internet link-up has been found and the current program he is using is experiencing technical difficulties. Below that a second pop-up appeared and asked if he wanted to e-mail the company.<br />
<br />
Thinking about it for a minute, Jason clicked on the box marked no and began to search the program. To him, the program was amazing, but he wondered if it could actually do what it claimed to do.<br />
<br />
Thinking, &quot;I might small,&quot; Jason clicked on Body Modifications and began to browse.<br />
<br />
Curious, and wondering about whether it would improve the way he felt, Jason clicked on the option to alter the genitals. Scrolling through, he began to make changes, noting briefly that the program had pulled up his bio.<br />
<br />
Clicking and scrolling, he changed it so that instead of a penis and testicles, he had instead the exterior equipment of a girl...Clitoris, clitoris hood, urethra, Vagina opening that led to the cervix, and covering all this was the lips majour and minour. Next he changed that only he was aware of the changes and everyone still thought that he had the equipment of a normal, healthy male. After that he altered it so that his privates were somewhere between being on the cusp of puberty and experience puberty and that no hair had, or would, grow.<br />
<br />
He skipped the option to have a uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries, figuring he might progress that far one of these days and skipping the permanentcy option, he clicked save as he set the changes to be immediate, but slow.<br />
<br />
Almost instantaneously he felt a pulling sensation from his groin and standing with some difficulty, he exited his room and headed for Vicky's. As he walked down the hall, he undid his pants and shucking them off, he staggered into his sister's room. Standing in front of her mirror, he rolled the yellow panties down and watched as his penis and testicles began to shrink.<br />
<br />
Slowly they shrank and then folded up into his body as the area between his legs began to puff outward. Unable to see what was happening because he had an oversized Labia Majoura...something Jason hoped was normal...he touched the mons pubis, which sent a thrilling electrical tingling sensation throughout his body.<br />
<br />
Overjoyed that it had worked, he was just about to reach down and attempt to touch the rest of his new formed genitals when a voice behind him asked, &quot;Just what do you think you are doing wearing my underwear and why do you have your penis and testicles tucked back?&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning, Jason found himself looking at his sister Vicky, who had a hostile look on her face and was tapping her foot, waiting for Jason to answer.</p>
