<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The white light hit him square in the chest. Stephen didn&#39;t feel anything different so he walked around the house for the rest of the day thinking the chrovonic needed to rest. Stephen was outside his house when he collapsed into a simple puddle. Stephen grew worried he had just fallen onto the ground without warning he had fallen. He tried to sit up but then remembered about his earlier transformation. He felt the hot sun beating down on him. The H2O atoms that now was Stephen where evaporating along with Stephen himself. He started to float upwards into the sky. Stephen was above his house, above the trees, above his neighborhood, he could see the entire city now. He floated up and up and up. Stephen moved his atoms closer to a cloud he saw. Stephen got himself fussed with the other atoms to form a bigger cloud. The winds where pushing Stephen away from his city and moving him across his state. He started to get heavier, and heavier, and the wind seemed to push harder and harder on his cloud. The Stephen cloud grew bigger and bigger while also getting darker. Stephen looked down and saw the great blue ocean. Soon Stephen was extremely tired with floating he just wanted to collapse down. And that exactly what he did.<br />
<br />
Stephen&#39;s cloud transformed into thousands of tiny decouples and fell down into the ocean. Once all of Stephen&#39;s atoms where in the water they floated around splashing and crashing in the storm&#39;s waves. Soon Stephen shoved through the other water atoms down away from the surface. Stephen saw millions of fish and other sea life. Stephen started to explore the murky ocean depths. <br />
He saw bones, ships, treasure, whales, squids, volcanoes, and even a live submarine. But at one point Stephen got picked up by and underground current and was sucked away along the depths. <br />
Stephen hit his head on a rock and fell tired as he begain to go to sleep. <br />
Stephen woke up with a pulling sensation. He barley had time to open his eyes when a giant killer whale swallowed him. Stephen was shoved down the throat and thrown into the stomach. Stephen felt himself being digested along with some fish and seal. Stephen started to become mixed in with the food. Which ment he was becoming flesh. Stephen was shoved and pushed and shoved right into a wall of muscle. Stephen felt him self being jolted and urged to from time to time but Didn&#39;t have control anymore. At one point he was shoved in and out of something vigorously till it all stopped suddenly. But sense Stephen couldn&#39;t see it was unknown where he was in the Whale. <br />
On day after being part of a whale Stephen felt pain. Not in his section of the body but somewhere in the body. The whale was being hurt some how. Stephen felt the blood being pulled somewhere else. The whale was dieing. <br />
<br />
The whale wa being pulled out of the water for some reason. Stephen later found out that a fishing boat had harpooned the whale and the whale was being brought up on the ship. Stephen felt his personal part of the whale being cut off and placed in cold storage away from the rest of the body. Stephen felt cold and alone till there was a light many days latter. Stephen was put in a cold box and brought to land some where. He couldn&#39;t understand the language but it sounded Asian. Stephen was very confused and was Hooked on a wire for all to see. Stephen still couldn&#39;t see anything though he was getting worried. Stephen was finally taken down and put in another cold place a truck he guessed. Stephen was brought out and put on what felt like a large plate. For some reason after he thawed out he could see again. He was long and cylindrical on a table surrounded from what looked like japenese people all holding food utensils. Stephen moved his sight and looked at the rest of his body. He was black and white and in the shape of a pole. Then Stephen realized.<br />
<br />
Stephen had been transformed into the Killer whale&#39;s dick. The boat was a Japenese whaling boat. Stephen new that the Japs had a thing for killing whales and dolphins. He was chopped off from the rest of the whale and sold at a market on land. From the looking of the Tabel and the surrounding people he guessed he was worth a lot. The people where gonna eat Stephen. <br />
It most have been some weird Asian culture thing. Stephen tried to talk to them but all that came out was a droplet of sea water from his hole. And Stephen was a hue penis he was nearly eight feet long and was about to be eaten by about thirty people. <br />
The eating didn&#39;t take long. Stephen was devoured by then in under twenty minutes. Sense Stephen was eaten in such a vast quantity by all the people he was now sucked into thirty people.<br />
 Stephen after being digested in all the people moved his essence to each one of there brains. When he reached the Brain he could control all thirty people.</p>
