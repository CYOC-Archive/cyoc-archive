<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The set-up seemed perfect. Ty was reaching into his jacket, made the two pocket-dicks<br />
invisible for everyone in the room except for himself and took them out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, boys,&quot; he whispered, &quot;ready to go!&quot; He blinked with his eyes - another method<br />
to mark the start of his wish, because snipping might have been a bit too obvious in<br />
a place like this - and from now on he could order those pocket-dicks directly via<br />
mind-controle. (Which again raises the question, whether those dicks actually had a<br />
mind to controle?)<br />
<br />
Ty sent the two pocket-dicks over to that girl sitting right in front of him. He watched <br />
them run over to the table, jumping onto her rucksack, from there to the next chair <br />
and then up onto the table. No one could see them, except for Ty, who kept them invisible. <br />
&quot;Hmmm ... I wonder&quot; ... Ty couldn&#39;t make up his mind as to how he should proceed <br />
from here. He could just make those dicks visible to either all people around or to <br />
that student-girl only. He might make them ejaculate all over her or onto her study-<br />
book or into her coffee, but for some reason he did not really feel like it. <br />
<br />
Unlike Dustin or the other people who had been pestering him all the time, had treated <br />
him badly or badmouthed him, unlike those who he had always felt the urge of taking <br />
out his revenge on them one way or the other, he had no such feelings towards this <br />
girl. She did not do anything to him. Unlike those cheerleaders back at school she did <br />
not walk the streets showing off her beauty in vain or treated people around her <br />
badly. As far as Ty was concerned this girl did not do anything wrong. He would not <br />
find joy in messing with her. <br />
<br />
Still, she was intently reading, taking up notes from time to time or underlining something. <br />
She was obviously very dedicated to her studies, but still being able to see two dicks sitting <br />
right next to her text-book, bowing their heads as if they were trying to read what was <br />
written or check her notes was in itself fun to look at. <br />
<br />
While she was reading she was absentmindedly chewing on her pen whilst reading and <br />
that was, when Ty had a marvellous idea. He did not want to mess with her, but there <br />
was something he had to do. Thats when he summoned those two pocket-dicks back to <br />
his place, put them back into his jacket and made it so the pen that girl was chewing on <br />
was directly connected to that man who was opposing her, reading a newspaper. <br />
<br />
The girl wouldn&#39;t notice, there wouldn&#39;t be a difference as for the texture or look of her pen, <br />
it would still just be her ordinary pen, but whatever she did to it, would be led directly to <br />
that man&#39;s penis. If she was sucking on the end of her pen, the man would feel as if his <br />
dick was sucked in, if she was licking her pen, he would feel as if someone was licking his <br />
penis and last but not least: if she was gnawing on her pen ... well ... <br />
<br />
Ty was happy about this idea, blinked his eyes and from now on whatever that girl did <br />
to her pen would be felt by the penis of the newspaper reader. At the moment, however, <br />
the pen was next to her book, so there was nothing to be seen of the effect. Ty just had <br />
to wait patiently. But then ... right! The girl picked up her pen again, marked something <br />
in her book, read on and was tapping the pen onto the taple. The man at the left hand <br />
side jumped at this. He was having the most confused expression on his face that Ty had <br />
ever seen. But when the girl put down her pen again, he picked up his newspaper again, <br />
and started to read again, but now and then he was peeping around with a distracted <br />
look. He was obviously trying to figure out what was going on. <br />
<br />
It did not take long for the girl to pick up her pen again and ... <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything else for you?&quot; the waitress asked. Ty had not even realyzed that she <br />
had been coming aup at his table. &quot;Ahem, yeah ... could you get me another cappuccino <br />
please?&quot; Ty replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;You should stop checking out that girl over there!&quot; the waitres said. &quot;She has to prepare <br />
for an exam she is going to have tomorrow. She really needs the time to learn.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Im sorry, I didn&#39;t know it was so obvious!&quot; Ty said. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t keep her from <br />
studying. After that the waitress left and took up another order by the student. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bah, ...!&quot; Ty thought, &quot;That was annoying ... maybe Im gonna mess with her next?&quot; <br />
<br />
The Student was still reading and absentmindedly sucking on her pen, and as expected <br />
the man on the other side of the room was unable to concentrate on his readings as <br />
she was doing it. He held his paper with cramping hands and he was moving as if <br />
he was in desperate need of a loo. His face was all red, his eyes were hectically turning <br />
hither and tither and it was plain for everyone to see, that something was happening <br />
to him that he could not understand. <br />
<br />
When the girl took her pen out of her mouth again and put it back onto the table, the <br />
man stood up hurriedly and made his way to the lavaratory. &quot;This is brilliant!&quot; Ty <br />
thought. &quot;Why messing with people myself if it is far more entertaining to let others <br />
do the job without them even being aware of?&quot; <br />
<br />
That was when the waitress returned. She served a cup of hot coffe to the student <br />
and brought Ty the cappuccino he had ordered. Ty took some sugar and stirred <br />
his cappuccino, the girl had once again picked up her pen and was sucking and <br />
gnawing on it in deep concentration. &quot;The guy on the loo must have the time of <br />
his life right now!&quot; Ty thought bemused, when the girl added some sugar to her <br />
coffee, but instead of using a spoon, put her pen into the hot coffee to stirr. <br />
<br />
There was a painful scream coming from the back of the café and all the customers, <br />
the waitress and the barrista turned their heads into the direction it was coming <br />
from. The waitress took some steps into that direction, but the barrista kept her <br />
and went to check for himself. Ty came to again, blinked and everything was back <br />
to normal again, well, not everything, but he had made an end to the direct connection <br />
of the student&#39;s pen and the newspaper-man&#39;s penis. He did not expect anything like <br />
that to happen. <br />
<br />
The barista returned and whispered something to the waitress. &quot;What? He did?... He did <br />
not ... but how?&quot; ... Ty could easily imagine the conversation that had taken place. Just <br />
how would that poor man have explained that he got a burn on his penis? Ty thought <br />
about this for a while. &quot;Well, I guesst thats that kind of stories ER people are telling <br />
each other. `Guess what kind of emergency I got last night! You woldn&#39;t believe it!´&quot;</p>
