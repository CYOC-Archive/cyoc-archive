<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amy thought it over carefully. If she did become male again now she would be killing her child. She looked up and asked &quot;What if I remain this size?&quot;<br />
<br />
Raven shook her head sadly and said &quot;The child will die when you go into labor. It's just too small to survive the contractions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy thought for a second longer an said &quot;I felt really bad when I had thought I had wiped out the life even if it was digital. I don't want to feel that way again. I'll come with you to your village and have the baby. After I want to become a male human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's up to you of course&quot; Raven said tapping the screens a few more times then stood up. &quot;If you'll follow me we'll be able to catch the next portal to my village.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Amy followed her she asked &quot;Couldn't you create a portal yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can only create a portal when I'm doing my Moderator duties&quot; Raven said. &quot;Otherwise I'm only a level fifteen fairy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how do you change if you're only level fifteen?&quot; Amy asked as they reached an alcove in the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see soon enough&quot; Raven said as she took off her sash and put it in a pouch. A few seconds later a portal opened and she stepped through it. Amy stepped through too and found herself in a forest she didn't know. &quot;Welcome to Faemist Forest. Faedale is just through those bushes.&quot; She points to some bushes a twenty feet away. &quot;It's pretty well hidden and there are enchantments protecting it too.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment a male fairy with green crystalline butterfly wings zoomed up to them and pointed a staff at them. &quot;Identify yourselves&quot; he said in a commanding tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be like that Mint&quot; Raven said. &quot;You know perfectly well who I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True Raven&quot; Mint said nodding to her. &quot;But I don't know her.&quot; He jabbed his head toward Amy.<br />
<br />
Amy was about to say something when Raven put a hand on her shoulder and said &quot;This is Tristy. She's a level five fairy and her previous village was in a mid level area.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mint's jaw dropped in shock. It took him a moment to recover and asked &quot;Why would any low level fairy have their village in a mid level area?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She got stuck with this character from the first hack&quot; Raven explained. &quot;The previous owner was trying to boost her level without doing a lot of work. She was using Fertility Treatment, Accelerated Lifespan, Soul Pass, and Sensual Touch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long did the original owner leave her on auto?&quot; Mint asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Four months&quot; Amy said.<br />
<br />
Mint whistled and said &quot;That's a long time to leave it on auto.&quot; He laughed and it sounded like a high childish laugh. &quot;That would have worked if the experience gained didn't diminish each time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Soul Pass was intended for those who had a limited lifespan&quot; Raven said seeing the quizzical look on Amy's face. &quot;It allows one to pass on experience to their offspring, from mother to child. Usually one sets it up to pass onto only daughters. Of course we fae don't need it since we don't die. We even stop aging when we become thirty-six.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why did you bring Tristy here?&quot; Mint asked relaxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;She needs a different village to call home&quot; Raven said. &quot;Go get Snowrose please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; Mint nods and flits back into the bushes.<br />
<br />
As they were waiting for Mint to come back Raven whispered &quot;Fae form.&quot; The gem on her necklace glowed and she rapidly shrunk. As she did she became younger and her skin became a dark gray her lips turning blue. Her dress changed to blue and separated into two pieces of a sheer fabric which was a light blue. The bottom became a short skirt. The top was shaped like a butterfly with straps going around back. There was nothing on her shoulders. It was evident that she had nothing on under the clothes. As she had shrunk her belly expanded out and light blue wings that looked like they were made out of ice grew out of her back. The last thing to change was her hair changed to black rolling from the roots and stopping shy of the tips leaving them blond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you do that anytime you want?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as I'm wearing this necklace&quot; Raven said holding her necklace up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look to be fifteen now&quot; Amy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well of course&quot; Raven said giggling. &quot;Our bodies age half as much as humans. So even though I'm thirty my fae body is fifteen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So if I look like I'm eleven I'm really twenty-two?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly!&quot; Raven said smiling. &quot;You're twenty-two which is the age we become able to reproduce.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, if we age half as fast as humans does that mean we're pregnant twice as long?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no&quot; Raven said waving it off. &quot;We're pregnant for nine months and nurse our babies for a week before the limited Accelerated Lifespan kicks in and ages them to ten years old. That's when a player can play them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mint reappeared with a female fae that looked like she was eighteen. Her skin was pure white. Her long curly hair was res as was the irises of her eyes. Her wings were red dragonfly wings. She was wearing the same clothes as Raven though her's was red. She was carrying a staff that looked like a rose. This had to be Snowrose. &quot;So my daughter&quot; she said. &quot;Why did you send for me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yala Mom&quot; Raven said. &quot;Tristy here needs to be made fairy size again. She's pregnant and sh's due about the same time as I am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A couple of days then&quot; Snowrose said nodding. &quot;Well I'd normally ask you to follow me to the sacred grove but with you so close there's no time as it takes two days to reach. I'll have to do it here. At least all I need to do is change your size.&quot; She pointed her staff at Amy and said &quot;Fae as tall as humans are naught but lies. Return you now to fairy size.&quot;<br />
<br />
What looked like yellow pollen floated out of the staff and swirled around Amy. After a few seconds she started to shrink slowly at first then faster. Her clothes shrank with her. Her belly started to expand outward once she had shrunk so far. Once she had finished shrinking her clothes changed to a sheer black dress. Unfortunately there wasn't anything on underneath and she shuddered at the though of what she would be feeling. A breeze blew through the forest but she didn't take as much notice of it as she thought she would. &quot;What?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sensual Touch doesn't work when you're close to giving birth&quot; Raven said. &quot;Now come and I'll show you what will hopefully be your new home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raven flew up to the spot that Mint and Snowrose had come out of and Amy followed. Both fae had trouble flying due to being close to giving birth. Flitting through the branches they came to the village. The village looked like it had been grown out of the bushes it was nestled in. Looking overhead Amy could see the branches formed a canopy over the village. Sunlight filtered in through the canopy. This village looked to be an idyllic place to live.<br />
<br />
Over the next two days Raven showed Amy around the village. A fae wearing a Moderator sash came every two hours while she was awake to renew the button. Unfortunately they couldn't get her out of the game yet. The day after she came to the village it started to snow and it brought cold air with it. This pleased Raven to no end. When she asked why this was Raven said that her family were seasonal fae and what their gifts were depended on what season they were born in. Raven and her mother were winter fae and now winter had just started. This meant that Raven's baby would be a winter fae. Raven pointed out fae that were uncomfortable staying indoors where it was as warm as summer. Raven said that they were summer fae and the winter was hard on them just like the summer was hard on winter fae.<br />
<br />
They were collecting berries from the bushes on the second day. Raven was pointing out which berries were good to eat and which were poisonous. To Amy the berries looked the same so she didn't see how Raven could tell which were which. Suddenly a sharp cramp shot through Amy's stomach and she dropped her basket to clutch her stomach. Raven sat her basket down and asked &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My stomach just cramped up&quot; Amy replied as the cramp eased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's get you to the healing hut then&quot; Raven said as she gently started to lead Amy to the hut in the center of the village.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was just a cramp&quot; Amy said the cramp gone now.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't jut a cramp&quot; Raven said sternly. &quot;It's time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean?&quot; Amy asked feeling a little thrill run through her.<br />
<br />
Raven nodded and said &quot;You're baby is ready to come into the world.&quot; She put her hand on her own stomach but kept leading Amy to the healing hut.<br />
<br />
They both had couple more contractions each one a bit stronger than the last before they got to the hut. Once inside they were directed to lay down on the beds and their midwives were sent for. A few hours later the contractions had grown stronger and closer together. It was time for the delivery. Holly was Amy's midwife and when she told her to push she did. It was painful pushing especially when the head began to crown. Amy screamed as she continued to push. Soon she heard the cries of her baby and a wave of joy washed through her. Holly gave the girl to a nurse that wrapped her up and was about to hand her over when Amy felt another contraction and pushed. Soon another head was crowning. Soon another girl had come out of Amy. Another nurse wrapped her other daughter up and she was holding both her daughters. &quot;What are you going to name them?&quot; Holly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Lilly and Daisy&quot; Amy said exhausted but happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get some rest&quot; Holly said having the nurses take Lilly and Daisy.<br />
<br />
Amy looked over to Raven to see her own child being take by a nurse. &quot;I named my daughters Lilly and Daisy. What did you name your child?&quot; A warm feeling had spread through her when she said her daughters.<br />
<br />
Raven smiled and said &quot;I named my daughter Frostina.&quot; After a few moments where she just seemed to bask in the fact she had a daughter she said &quot;You need to make a decision. I would recommend you nurse once before before deciding though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy smiled and started drifting off. As she did she thought over her options. She could remain as she was and be a mother to her daughters. She could become a male fae and become Raven's mate. Or she could become a human male like she had wanted in the beginning.</p>
