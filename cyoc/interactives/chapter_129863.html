<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob and Christopher were very confused by the announcement. Why did the school want them all to go to the auditorium? And was that Principal Leonard on the PA? Why did he sound so... faggy? They exchanged glances with many other similarly confused students they recognized as friends as they all filled into the auditorium, unaware of the changes they were all about to receive.<br />
<br />
While the two were walking in, Zachary and Johnathon caught up with them so they could sit together. The four of them were the closest of friends as they all grew up together. Being from the same neighborhood, going to the same church and adopting the same conservative values of their parents, the foursome had every reason to stick together and soon, they&#39;d be inseparable in more ways than one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gosh, I hope this doesn&#39;t take long,&quot; Zachary began, careful with his words while running a hand through this raven hair. He was raised properly, so he refused to take God&#39;s name in vain. &quot;I had a paper to finish before I could get back to the passage I wanted to finish reading before the end of class.&quot; In his spare time, he enjoyed reading passages from the Bible and was considering even becoming a preacher after senior year. He certainly didn&#39;t have time for this nonsense.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just hope this isn&#39;t about accepting some faggy shit again. I don&#39;t want to hear about how this school has decided to accept Satan,&quot; Christopher responded. He hated that stuff, almost as much as he hated any nickname of his own. It was a perversion of his God given name, he believed, and his all-American blonde hair and blue eyes look wouldn&#39;t allow for such perversions.<br />
<br />
Jacob and Johnathan added in their own vocal agreements. The two boys were often mistaken for brothers at times. Their Chestnut hair and hazel eyes brilliantly complemented their rugged good looks and nice pelts of hair. If they hadn&#39;t taken their chastity pledge with the other boys in their church group, they might&#39;ve had a lot of luck with the ladies. Instead, they kept to themselves. Romance could wait until after they gain jobs in well respected fields, they believed.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the teachers in the room were quite frustrated. Specifically, Mr. Jason Sackerton, the PE teacher. His football team has just finished practice and he was about to have a class where he&#39;d rigorously strength train his students when the announcement came on. He believed that gym class should be a place where students pack some muscles onto themselves as it was important to keep in shape, and, as a result, much of the senior class was pretty well built by now. This assembly was a complete waste of time in his opinion, and he wasn&#39;t even informed of it! The blonde haired muscleman wanted this to end quickly, so he believed there was no reason to waste time sitting down.<br />
<br />
The students finally started settling down, not noticing their female counterparts were nonexistent, thanks to Sean&#39;s commands. He stayed in the back eagerly awaiting the upcoming changes.<br />
<br />
Principal Leo began by sexily strutting onto the stage with Luke locked to him by the elbow. As he made his way to the mic, the class emanated a mixture of disgust and shock. The four Christain boys were stunned. Wasn&#39;t that Luke on stage? When he get so faggy? They always remembered him being a good, religious boy and had often hung out with him. What happened?<br />
<br />
&quot;Helloooooo, boys!&quot; Leo confidently began. A couple hours ago he&#39;d have been terrified to speak in front of an audience in such a effeminate manner. Now, he was aroused by it. &quot;I bet you&#39;re all wondering why I brought you here today. Well, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll put your questions to rest. I&#39;ve found a totes new way to live my life, and I totally want all of you to join me!&quot; He explained to the audience in a sing-song voice, almost as if he was a game show host of the sluttiest game show on the planet.<br />
<br />
Luke proceeded to walk up to the front of the stage, turn around, bend over and expose his creamy bubble butt to the entire auditorium. They could all clearly see his &quot;Slutty Cum Dump&quot; tattoo on the small of his back and he loved it. This left an audible gasp in the room, much to Luke&#39;s amusement. He slapped his naked cheeks a couple of times and giggled to show just how slutty he was. If one looked closely, they could even see the end of an almost impossibly thick dildo poking out of his boypussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re gonna make you all just like this!&quot; The slutty principal announced with glee. &quot;And you&#39;ll all love it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How dafuq are you gonna do that?&quot; yelled a brutish man from the crowd. The voice belonged to Samuel, a hulking beast who practically spent all his time at the gym. He acquired from it massive muscles to compensate for his lackluster, straight, red hair and basic brown eyes. At 6&#39;4&quot;, he spent so much time at the gym that he was very pale, but it paid off. Last month, he got a coach that agreed to sign him on to help him win weightlifting competitions. To him, it was his dream job and he was psyched for it. The thought being this skinny bundle of sticks horrified and sickened him. &quot;You can&#39;t make me do that!&quot; He confirmed.<br />
<br />
Both Leo and Sean smiled simultaneously, this was gonna be fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you come up here then and prove it to us?&quot; Leo challenged. Samuel couldn&#39;t back down from a challenge, so he got up and started walking his way over. That was mistake #1.<br />
<br />
Sean couldn&#39;t see this turning out better. He programmed the changes to come out faster the closer in proximity you were to an infected twink. As Samuel walked up the steps, it was pretty clear all his hair was thinning out beneath his nose and what remained on his head was brightening in response. By the time he had gotten on stage, he&#39;d lost all hair below the nose and his hair was now a striking, reddish, strawberry blonde.<br />
<br />
Not that he was aware of it though. Other people could definitely see it based on their fearful looks but he wouldn&#39;t notice a thing until it was too late.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t make me into one of your fags,&quot; He proclaimed. That was mistake #2. Sean still wanted to keep his original command in there to get back at the gay bashers who stepped on him all his life. As a result, Samuel&#39;s changes sped up and went further than they would have. His hair, now styled and wavy, had streaks of purple to complement his new speedo, now proudly displayed as his only piece of clothing. Purple was his favorite color now, and he was very much losing muscle mass to a deep, sun-kissed tan. Not that he cared too much about the muscle loss; he started losing interest for the gym. Too much dedication for something not worth it, in his opinion. Swimming toned his glutes so much better and only in the swimming pool did guys wear such little clothing. Wait, didn&#39;t he mean girls? He guessed he meant both-- he loved showing off and seeing others do the same.<br />
<br />
Samuel, now preferring Sam, slowly started to grin on stage, much to the horror of the audience. Yeah, he loved showing off, it got him so hard, which was good since his 6&quot; dick length, which would be big by these twink standards, was the only thing he could use to compensate for his actual height, which had gone down to 5&#39;4&quot;, an entire foot, since he got out of his seat. His thoughts started turning slutty, as the last of his heterosexuality was used to make a tattoo on his growing bubble butt. It was a milk carton that was pouring directly into his boyhole. The coach he found loved it, and said if his skills in the pool hadn&#39;t convinced him to take Sammy on as his protege, then it was this sweet ass that kept on giving. He was a slutty, swimmer twink now, and if he stopped fucking someone every 5 minutes, he might have an actual chance at the Olympics. It was a shame though that he couldn&#39;t keep his ass off someone&#39;s dick; he&#39;d never progress very far as a result. Again, his coach didn&#39;t complain. He had plenty of money on the side to be Sammy&#39;s daddy and give him a shot, however pointless it may be.<br />
<br />
The newly minted redheaded twink would&#39;ve been fine if he hadn&#39;t what he did next. His eyes dropped to Luke&#39;s still exposed ass and a naughty thought came to him. He walked to him, removed the fingers Luke was pumping in and out of his ass as he watched Sammy&#39;s transformation, and shoved his face into Luke&#39;s boypussy. Tastes fruity, Sammy thought with a giggle. Although he&#39;d definitely have to take care of Sammy now, the coach would have to wait before he got his boy full time. He had to pass highschool first, and there was no way he was doing that with his now diminished intelligence. Each lick made the fog in Sammy&#39;s head thicker and thicker, as it did the same to Sammy&#39;s bubble butt and made him an even twinkier version of himself. And that was mistake #3.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the slut stopped rimming Luke, much to his disappointment. He giggled a lot, babbling incoherently about being such a slut and loving cum as he licked the mysterious liquid off his face and started producing his own, cementing himself as an infected twink.<br />
<br />
Leo simply smiled, looked at the audience and said two simple words: &quot;Who&#39;s next?&quot;</p>
