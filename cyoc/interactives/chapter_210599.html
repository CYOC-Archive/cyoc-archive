<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a while of giving it some thought, Jeff decides to not use the Chronivac-App during the class, he does not want to cause any panic if something should go wrong, instead he decides to wait until lunch break and search for a “guinea pig” to test the App on then.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in a other class room, a 18-year-old girl named “Sayaka Sato”, is boiling with anger. The reason why is, her “second in command”, or who the other students refer to as “Sayaka&#39;s Pet”, has not shown up to pick Sayaka up for school, like she normally does. “Cornelia Roberts”, or “Corny” which only Sayaka calls her, is much shorter than Sayaka, at least to heads. Cornelia always follows Sayaka around, repeats what Sayaka says and does what ever Sayaka tells her to do. After waiting for at least ten minutes for her “friend”, Sayaka received a text message from Cornelia, saying, “sorry Saya, I can&#39;t come today. I have a bad cold, the doctor says I&#39;ll be out for at least two weeks.”<br />
<br />
After reading the message, Sayaka felt anger raise up in her, “how dare she,” she had shouted, stomping her foot, “I have not given her permission to fall sick! Who&#39;ll is supposed to carry my bags? We had planned to go shopping after school, she knows darn well that it&#39;s her job to carry my stuff including my shopping!”<br />
<br />
Sayaka is a tall girl with long hair, which she died in pink, her eyes are blue, she has at least a CC-cup size, but her body is pretty athletic, which is due to her commitment on the cheerleader team of the school. The girl&#39;s family is also extremely wealthy, Sayaka gets everything she wants, that is why she sees herself better than everyone else and that is also the reason she expects to be “respected”. Sayaka and Cornelia regularly bully weaker students, and students who don&#39;t have so much money like them, and they hang around with other rich kids and teenagers.<br />
<br />
Her “friend” Cornelia is a girl with long orange hair, which she always styles in pig tails, her body is far more slimmer, when staring straight she stares directly at Sayaka&#39;s breasts. Cornelia has green eyes, her breasts are a medium B-cup, she has a perfect formed hourglass figure. The girl is, like Sayaka, wealthy and is also on the cheerleader team, the reason why “Corny” is doing anything Sayaka says and follows her around is because she wants to be just like Sayaka. Cornelia would never admit it, but she is actually terrified of her “friend”, instead of dumping Sayaka and search for “better” friends, the little girl uses her time to please Sayaka. Due to her height and body frame, Cornelia looks more like a 14-year-old girl, but she is 18, just like Sayaka.<br />
<br />
Right now, Sayaka&#39;s attention is more on the clock over the class room door, than on the teacher&#39;s lecture. &#39;Grrrr... I am, like, fucking exploding,&#39; the girl thinks to herself, &#39;Corny will be sorry for letting me down. I can&#39;t wait to get out of here and find some loser who I can pour all my anger on to!&#39;<br />
<br />
The minutes tick by, Jeff and Sayaka both let out a groan, &#39;the time really is dragging today,&#39; they both think. Finally, the bell rings, signaling the lunch break, Sayaka and Jeff both don&#39;t waste any time as they jump up from their seats and hurry out of the class room, unaware that they are walking towards each other.<br />
<br />
The halls are still pretty empty, since the students are starting to just exit the class rooms, so when Sayaka turns a corner she bumps into Jeff, literally sending the younger boy tumbling to the ground with an “ouch!”<br />
<br />
Sayaka stares down at the 16-year-old, her eyes burning with anger, “WATCH WHERE YOU ARE GOING, LOOSER!”<br />
<br />
Jeff scowls as he picks himself up, “why don&#39;t YOU watch where YOU are going, bitch,” he replies, which turns out to be a huge mistake.<br />
<br />
The boy&#39;s eyes widen in shock, realizing what he had just said and WHO he said it to, before he is able to turn and run, Sayaka already has him by the collar, “what did you just say,” she asks with a growl in her voice. Sayaka is far stronger than Jeff, who has not really got any muscles, he is a simple weak boy and stands no chance against the girl and Jeff knows this.<br />
<br />
The other students notice the situation, but instead of helping Jeff, they simply just keep on walking, not wanting any part of Sayaka&#39;s anger spilled on them. Jeff feels fear creeping up inside of him, he had never seen Sayaka THIS angry before, “Sa-Sayaka... I... I&#39;m so-sorry,” he stammers.<br />
<br />
Sayaka smirks, “sorry,” she asks, “oh... I doubt that you feel sorry. But don&#39;t worry: I will MAKE you feel sorry! YOU are coming with ME,” without letting go of Jeff, the girl starts to drag the poor boy along the hallway towards the exit of the school.<br />
<br />
Jeff struggles, trying to break free of Sayaka&#39;s grip, but the girl is simply to strong, “pl-please Sayaka,” the boy begs, “pl-please I... didn&#39;t mean to... s-say that... I sw-swear!”<br />
<br />
The girl does not reply, soon they reach the back of the building and the girl walks down a few steps until stopping in front of a heavy metal door. Without a word, and still one hand on Jeff&#39;s collar, she takes out a key and opens the door, then she throws Jeff into the darkness, before entering herself, closing the door behind her and locking it.<br />
<br />
After being thrown into the room, Jeff stumbles and falls to his hands and knees, he has no idea where he is nor what the girl has in mind. Jeff slowly gets up to his feet, then he hears the click of a light switch and is suddenly blinded. After his eyes have adjusted themselves to the light, Jeff recognizes the room he is in: he is in the Janitor&#39;s supply room. The teen then hears footsteps behind him, he turns to find Sayaka grinning at him.<br />
<br />
“Try and scream all you want,” the girl says, “NO ONE will hear you!”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, he knows that there is no point in trying, the room is on the far back of the building, and there is only the one door which is made off thick metal, and there are no windows. The boy tries to think how to get out of this mess, he then remembers the App on his phone: maybe he could manage to scan Sayaka and make her let him go? &#39;It is risky,&#39; Jeff thinks to himself, &#39;but it is my only hope to survive and not be killed.&#39;<br />
<br />
“You know, looser,” Sayaka says, “first Corny falls sick, because of that I had to walk all the way to school by myself... The worst part was, that I had to carry my bag... then to make matters worse, the person I have to bump into is YOU,” the girl scowls. “So now, YOU have to face the consequences... hey, what are you doing with your phone!”<br />
<br />
Jeff jumps, while Sayaka was talking, he had taken out his phone and had the App open, ready to scan Sayaka, “n-nothing...,” he says.<br />
<br />
Sayaka knows that the boy is laying, “hand over that phone,” the girl orders.<br />
<br />
“Um... no,” Jeff says, “my phone, you have your own.”<br />
<br />
Sayaka growls, “wrong answer, Jeffy-boy,” she says, and in one big stride the girl is in his face and with a quick swipe ends up snatching Jeff&#39;s phone from the boy.<br />
<br />
“HEY,” Jeff shouts, “GIVE THAT BACK!”<br />
<br />
“HA,” Sayaka says, “I don&#39;t think so,” she looks down at the phone, while keeping Jeff in her sight. “Trying to send a text to your loser squad,” she asks, “pah, they Couldn&#39;t help you anyway. I never seen this App before... what is this crap? Mind Control? Transformations? What nerd-fuck is this?”<br />
<br />
Jeff stays silent, hoping Sayaka doesn&#39;t figure it out.<br />
<br />
Sayaka looks up, “oh, playing the “mute”, are we,” she asks, she then grins, “well, let&#39;s see if this bullshit actually works.”<br />
<br />
Jeff watches in horror as Sayaka presses down on his phone, aiming it at him. Suddenly the boy feels a strange tingling in his head, &#39;wh-what has she done to me?&#39;<br />
<br />
“Now, I will ask you again,” the girl says, “what nerd-fuck App is this? And you&#39;d better answer truthfully!”<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes widen as he feels the command take effect, and before he knows it he is already answering Sayaka&#39;s question. “It is a program, which is able to transform people into anything, it also has a mind control function, which you have just used successfully on me,” his heart drops when he finishes.<br />
<br />
Sayaka raises an eyebrow, “bullshit,” she says, “you are just saying that to fuck with me!” The girl thinks for a while, “hm... how could you CONVINCE me that this shit actually is what you claim it to be,” she asks, looking at Jeff. Then a wicked smile appears on her face, “I know ONE thing you wouldn&#39;t do out of free will,” she says, the look in her eyes causes Jeff to gulp and feel fear raise once again, “if you really have to do what I say... then STRIP off ALL your clothes!”<br />
<br />
Jeff is horrified when he feels his body move on it&#39;s own, his hands starting to undo his tie, throwing it to the floor, his hands then move to his shirt and starts to unbutton it. “Pl-please Saya-Sayaka...,” he says in a pleading voice, tears in his eyes, “pl-please st-stop this...!”<br />
<br />
Sayaka raises an eyebrow, “you really are unable to stop undressing yourself,” she asks, Jeff nods, one arm already out of his shirt. The girl watches as the shirt soon falls to the ground and Jeff&#39;s hands move to the boy&#39;s pants, &#39;okay... the loser would never strip in front of a girl on command,&#39; she thinks to herself. Sayaka looks at the sobbing boy, his body slightly bent forward as he attempts to remove his pants, the girl looks at the app, suddenly a grin forms on her lips, “okay, stop stripping and put your clothes back on,” she says. Her eyes widen when Jeff does as told without hesitation.<br />
<br />
Soon, Jeff is fully dressed again, “tha...,” he starts.<br />
<br />
“SILENCE,” Sayaka shouts, Jeff immediately falls silent, he opens and moves his mouth, but no sound comes out. The boy looks at the girl in pure horror, Sayaka on the other hand is smirking, “I have something better in mind, this should teach you a lesson for angering me! But before I punish you, tell me TRUTHFULLY: did you plan to use it on me, before I snatched your phone away from you? If so, WHAT was it you had planed? You wanted to transform me into a frog, right!?”<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no... Sayaka,&quot; the boy says, &quot;I... I just w-wanted to make you let me go! That is all... I never planed to transform you into anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... okay,&quot; Sayaka says, &quot;since you have to tell the truth, I believe you. Now, what would should I do to you? What would be the best and most hilarious punishment for you for angering me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pl-Please...,&quot; Jeff starts.<br />
<br />
Sayaka shoots him a angry stare, &quot;who permitted you to talk,&quot; she asks, &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear any words comming out of your mouth, UNLESS I allow it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s eyes widen, tears form once again, as he finds his ability to speak being stripped from him, the girl smirking evily at him.</p>
