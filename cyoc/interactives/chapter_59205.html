<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff followed the instructions on the Made Of section and wondered about his choices.  There are so many types of food he can turn to but didn’t know where to begin.  But then, something occurred to him.  Known fact, Jeff liked chocolate.  He enjoys it ever since he was a little kid.  And not just one chocolate, he enjoys all types of chocolate.  Hershey’s chocolate bars, Kisses, Snickers, M&amp;M’s, Three Musketeers, Butterfingers, just about anything.  He has the tendency to have it for a snack, a late night meal, or a bit of a supplement for his ice creams and milks.<br />
<br />
One time, he wished his body was made out of chocolate and now with this Chronivac in his possession, his wish would come true.  But the problem is what would happen if any of his family members, his friends, or anyone else tends to eat him? The instructions did say that if a part of him gets eaten, it wouldn’t be recovered when the change is over.  Pondering about this, he came to the conclusion and said, “You know what, screw this.  I want to become chocolate myself, I’m going to do it.  If anyone eats me, at least that’s an awesome way to die.”  So he went to his computer and started putting down the information he needed.<br />
<br />
First he typed what type of food he wants to be, which is chocolate.  Then he picked the time duration.  Thinking this should be a quick change, he put down five minutes.  Next and typed how long the transformation will last.  Given this would be a while, he decided a full week just to see how long he would last at a chocolate human.  After that, he spotted a drop down screen that wants him to change the reality around him.  Thinking this out, maybe if would be a good idea to let people think he was actually a human being made completely out of chocolate and wouldn’t be freaked out about it.  So he clicked on the drop down menu and selected yes.  As he was going to start the transformation, he notice a type in section with a title saying if there’s anything else you want to be added.  Wondering about that, he thinks he got something he can put.  Going to his keyboard, he started to type away on the addition he needs.<br />
<br />
‘For my change, I don’t need to wear clothes in my new form.  Yet I don’t want to be naked either.  With my body made of chocolate, I can shape my body to what I need to wear.  Anything from suits to casual, pajamas to swimsuits, boxers to briefs.  I can have that ability so that way I don’t have to use pieces of cloth to make me warm that it would melt my body.  Another thing I want to change is the fact that I can’t stay in a normal room.  If my body is made out of chocolate, then my room needs to be a cooling fridge, that way I won’t melt.  It will have the usual necessities I needed except for the bed witch will be replaced by a stone slab and a closet since I will change my clothes with my body.’<br />
<br />
After finishing what he needs to add, he moved his mouse to the transform button and took a deep breath.  By clicking it, a window appeared and it showed the timer that that states 5:00.  When the seconds started to countdown, his body started to tingle.  He knew that his transformation is starting.<br />
<br />
But as the process began, the changes weren’t starting all over his body.  Instead it was starting in his groin.  He looked down and noticed a bump slowly sticking out in his pants.  He quickly unzipped the zipper and pulled down both his pants and boxers down to get a quick relive.  After he did that, he noticed his penis growing, extending, and becoming erect without him doing that.  He wondered if this is part of his change from human to chocolate.<br />
<br />
As he was thinking about that, he started to feel a little hot and aroused.  Within moments, his body was on complete automatic.  He got up, took off all of his clothes, and approached his bed with no control what so ever.  Once he got on the bed, he placed his hand on his dick and rubbed it up and down.  He was self-pleasuring himself for no reason and couldn’t stop it.  He continued to stroke harder and harder until he started to explode in an orgasm.  He then started to cum out of his dick but he didn’t see and seaman coming out of it.  Instead, he saw chocolate coming out of there, like real hot milk chocolate.  He was quite surprised at this and touched it with his fingertips to see if it’s real.  Feeling the melty substance, he begins to realize this was actually real chocolate.  The program was actually turning him into what he likes to eat.<br />
<br />
As he was looking at his hands, Jim noticed the chocolate spreading down his fingers and on his palm.  He then looks down the same thing on his penis as it spread down its shaft while the top kept on exploding like a volcano erupting.  From what he can understand is that the chocolate liquid is going the spread all over his body until it covered him completely.  Even if he wants to stop it, he couldn’t.  He was too horny to cease and his body wouldn’t let him.  Like the Chronivac wants him to do it.  So he continues his masturbation skills while the chocolate spreads.<br />
<br />
While he was stroking his little friend, the chocolate goo went down his shaft and was spreading around his waist area.  At the same time, his hand was completely covered in the same substance and was going down his arm.  Ask once the chocolate covered both his dick and hand, it started to harden and acted like a shell over them.  Yet for some strange reason, he could still move them like a second skin.<br />
<br />
The chocolate continued to spread as hit waist was completely covered from his dick all the way around his butt.  Normally, the chocolate liquid would’ve destroyed the bed sheets he was on.  But it didn’t stain them at all.  It was like the changes were on his body and it’s not staining them one bit.  It was strange for Jim.  But he let that slide as he continued with his changes.<br />
<br />
The chocolate that was on his hand continued to down its arm and up to his elbow.  During that time, the chocolate started to spread up his stomach and back and down his knees.  He was experiencing every moment like it.  The chocolate went down his lower arm and onto his shoulder, slowly creeping up his neck.  He could feel his throat tingling as the brown water was on his skin.  Chocolate spread on his stomach and back and was now up to his chest.  His knees were completely covered in chocolate and it was now on his knees, hardening along the way.  The more the chocolate spread and more Jim was enjoying it.<br />
<br />
The moment it reached his neck, the chocolate was at the bottom of his face and into his mouth.  His teeth and tongue was covered in the same substance.  The moment it was down the inside of his throat, Jim could feel the taste.  But just as it entered his throat, it spread even deeper.  The chocolate spread into his stomach, lungs, liver, muscles, bones, and even his heart.  None of which didn’t kill him.  They were all still functioning like normal.  Jim could feel the brown liquid spreading in his body and was enjoying every second of it.<br />
<br />
Jim’s body was almost covered in chocolate inside and out.  Only twenty five percent of his body was still bare and not covered in brown candy.  But that would soon change.  Chocolate was on his chest and was covering his nipples.  The cocoa one his shoulder went down in his upper chest.  The moment both chocolate’s spread on the top and bottom parts of the chest the two connected forming into one.  The chocolate was now on his lower part of his legs and were getting closer to his feet.  His face was halfway covered as the chocolate went up to his nose and into his nostrils.  Not only is he feeling and tasting the chocolate, he was now smelling chocolate.  <br />
<br />
Almost three minutes in, his body was almost covered.  His entire chest now had chocolate all over him as it went up to his other shoulder and arm.  This same substance was on his feet and was sealed by the toes hardening instantly.  Even his face covered up completely with his eyes seeing chocolate, A.K.A. they were covered in chocolate.  His ears were filled to the brink with chocolate and his brain was covered with chocolate completely.  Even his hair became cocoa as well, as each strand was filled completely.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, his body is covered in a hundred percent chocolate and his disk stopped ejaculating brown cocoa.  Once he finished masturbating himself, he looked down to examine his body.  Everything from head to toe saw made of chocolate and there wasn’t any flesh anywhere.  In the light, his skin gives off a nice shiny sheen.  After a bit of a look over, Jim was amazed at what he was seeing and experiencing.  He almost looked like a chocolate guy from those Hershey’s commercial, or an Axe Chocolate Spray.<br />
<br />
He started to wonder what else has changed.  He got off his bed and observed every bit of it.  Or he thought he was on his bed.  For during the change, he could feel the bed went from being soft to hard in seconds.  Looking back, he noticed his bed has become a stone slab he can lay on.  He also felt a little cold around him.  He looked around and saw his room has become a freezer.  He still has the usual stuff around him, like his computer, T.V., gaming consoles, school work, just about everything.  But two things were missing.  His bed was one, and his closet was another.  His closet doors along with all of his clothes were long gone along with the clothes he discarded when the transformation started.  With all his clothes gone, he wondered if he could shift his body to any type of clothes he wants.  So he closed his eyes and focused on something normal.  Seconds later, his body tingled and another change took place.<br />
<br />
First his feet as his toes merged together and the shape expanded adding texture to the mix.  They were now a pair of chocolate Nike’s Air sneakers with socks rising up to the mid legs.  Jeff’s penis started to melt into his nether regions and became smooth while his hips and thighs bulk up and shaped into chocolate jean shorts.  His upper body grew a bit and reshaped to form a plain brown T-Shirt.  And chocolate grew out of his left wrist.  When the change was complete, Jeff opened his eyes and took a look at himself in the mirror.  Looking at himself, he was amazed to see he can change his clothes to whatever he pleases.<br />
<br />
After looking at his new body, Jeff and extremely happy.  Never in a million would someone get a wish to turn into human chocolate and now he got it with the help of the Chronivac.  Since he has a week, he thought he could do something fun before he gets eaten by anyone or the change is finished.  “Now let’s see…” he said pondering his options, “What shall I do?”</p>
