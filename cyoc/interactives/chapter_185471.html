<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anna was many thing but not so spiteful a female that she could hate a man, or her brother for her own mistake, she casting a wish for Ken and her; as may cause her to change half or all the way to being a doe goat animal. As Circe had added her disgusted thoughts to the situation, Anna thought about what might lie ahead in her future, as she smiled at how she pictured herself when in part as a sexy mixture of young woman and doe goat.<br />
<br />
As Anna led then her donkey brother to his stall in the barn; She felt her foolish wish begin its degrading of her to become as just another farm animal. Her blouse and jeans began to feel warm, or hot as enough to burst into flames. She walked Ken into the barn and slapped his furry butt to move him inside his barn stall.<br />
<br />
Panting like a overheated dog in summer, Anna watched as her properly clothed self, her clothing dissolved to a gray ash, and the ash clung then to her perspiring skin. As then the ash soaked into her skin, it caused a change of her skin to become animal like tough hide. As had her clothing disintegrated, so did her cowboy boots bake to a blackening paste that clung to her shins, feet, and toes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Circe,&quot; Anna groaned, but received not a reply or any answer. <br />
<br />
What all had stuck to her bodily, as about her lower legs and feet, her then toughened skin turned animal hide took to sprouting everywhere below her neckline grew a downy gray to black fuzziness. Anna felt of her sleek as slim bodily self and began to admire her body when it would be as furry. &quot;Foolishly worded wish might be a mistake, but as it begins, it feels so nice; I could well enjoy becoming a doe goat yet!&quot;<br />
<br />
Down deep, Circe felt disgust and some level of fear of embarrassment. She set moaning her situation and had a real worry about what the Fates might do to her for all of those she transformed, and caused their fated future to need be changed to match their animal existence. Circe had seen her big chance at gaining a womanly body by use of young Anna. When with time that Anna became a woman of twenty-two, Circe expected by then she would own the full control of her young protégée. <br />
<br />
Then if foolishly drawn into a curse, just as she had regressed her ancient attained age, was young again; her body though smaller, had strength, being quite fit, and would mark her as a beautiful woman. However, the blending of one curse was beginning to change of arms to become legs, as would human legs be then as hind legs.<br />
<br />
What Anna saw, Circe did as well, both knew their body was starting to resemble, the coarse features doe goat. Fear and a proper sense of panic ensued Circe, she looking across the barn at the Donkey who was Anna&#39;s brother. As pleading bleats echoed the barn; from nine doe goats scenting the smell of a new doe goat somewhere there about in the barn.<br />
<br />
Anna heard the bleating and she for the first time even felt sympathetic pains from her changing, being slowly transforming, becoming a rather large doe nanny goat. &quot;I&#39;d wish more for a kind husband than what I now expect to want for and feel of a brute male goat; as he would be despicable, a herd-sire?&quot; Anna said as se stood staring at Ken and from what Circe had made mention of before, her lurid remarks said as to direct their mutual attentions to a stud donkey masturbating due to his horrible fate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Anna, we are doomed for several years or maybe permanently in your lifespan to remaining a doe goat!&quot; Circe again nagged at the mentality of Anna who was acting meek when speaking about her changed to doe life. Anna felt her skin as changing, fur sprouting, even the gaining of added internal organs. She thought about the losing of her perky, womanly breasts as turned into a crude goat-udder, with elongated, as fat teats. <br />
<br />
She walked around inside the barn, noting as how her body was undeniable becoming partially that of an animal. Anna took to thinking of how she would need as acting a modest mannered approach to her father for him investing, buying for her needs a Billy goat. A nervousness but exited girl could not imagine the pleading words she would need say; was annoyed buy squeaky bleated cries of nine doe goats.<br />
<br />
After the ring had led Circe to Anna and the girl had attained knowledge about the Goddess, this situation made her worry if she were when a doe goat possibly sold by her dad, as a doe goat to another goat farm. Her concerns about the Goddess included a wonderment if she, Anna would as ignorant a doe goat prefer to remain a female goat?<br />
<br />
Circe tended to ignore the bleating goats as she had of oinking swine, no difference be they sow or Boar, they were as to her just beasts. The Goddess reacted more than kind as to deciding about Anna changing of form to being a doe goat. &quot;If your one boyfriend might wish to remain close to you, I am sure if asked nicely, he could join our fate, becoming as well a Goat, then a herd sire buck-male goat!&quot; <br />
<br />
Circe so offered the worrying Anna, as if she accepted the suggestion; as he might willingly grasp at the prospect of becoming a wholly immoral buck goat. &quot;He is a man, and men always wish they had bigger balls, and a longer penis. I could enhance his genitals the moment you make him  the offer; but know this, I have no plan to return him back to again being as human, boyfriend of no, he stays a goat!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why doom him, if he accepts and becomes a devote follower of you the Goddess Circe?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Test him now, before your changing form ceases the ability to speak,&quot; Circe avidly suggested of Anna, as she walked to the barn phone and called her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey its me, yeah just fine, as I have a rather lurid to erotic offer, or aa suggestion if you are at all interested,&quot; said Anna, as adding more words to the offer as tantalizing of his concerns. &quot;My beliefs and desires have changed. If you would prefer to do with me as having asked, we can forget all about me ever needing to be your wife!&quot;<br />
<br />
Circe was prepared to adjust the young fellow, and Anna said then to disturb her boyfriend, &quot;By the powers gifted to me by my gold ring, to delight us both, I gift to you the male genitals similar a Kiko breed, Billy goat!&quot;<br />
<br />
The reply heard from the phone began then thrilled bleating cries of a young male feeling and being enhanced sexually, he being frantic. &quot;What the, Anna I love your new ability, I have a goat&#39;s sheath, penis, and my scrotum is as big as two Avocados. Hey, hey my new cock is becoming aroused as it is so much longer...!<br />
<br />
Oh, ah hold the phone, I feel a drastic urge to urinate!&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna knew that Circe would feel glad, but this scheme tended to frustrate, as did the thought of how soon her boyfriend would want to pop inside her furred and wiggling rump.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello hello, oh I am sorry for making you wait, as what you did to me is more a new predicament. My parents are leaving town for four days and three nights, so could you come here tonight, and we would have full privacy. My dearest, but your religion was never mine! <br />
<br />
I hope that when you end up needing to live your life, you become contented, maybe happy. Ah, ha, I have heard that buck goats are always horny, they wanting to mate, and you dear, you were one horny girlfriend to do this to me.<br />
<br />
Once a night was never enough for a Knight, do you want sex for all night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anna, step away from this young fellow, as without any concern for his parents, and tonight he&#39;s alone..., and as he grows more horny, I shall grow him horns, fur, a tail, four legs, bodily until we have our big Billy...!&quot;</p>
