<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The room lit up green, Tim&#39;s penis would have released a burst of urine if it could have but now it was impossible.<br />
<br />
The light dissipated, Tim tried to look around him but now it was impossible, he could only see the ceiling and a certain part of the room, he wondered, what had happened to him? His whole body felt rigid and strangely lighter, He tried to move his hands to feel his body but he couldn&#39;t, just like his feet and legs, his testicles felt oppressed in a certain way, as did his penis, for some reason he felt a slight tingling in his anus and...<br />
<br />
—<br />
&quot;Yes! My first rec room item!&quot; Mr. Wheeler&#39;s eyes were spinning. He ran over to the newly transformed hanger and stared at it with his mouth open. &quot;Wow! “I have no fucking idea what this is!”<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t be silly, this is clearly a…” The agent paused for a moment as he consulted his notes. “...a dart board!”<br />
<br />
“A dart board! Wow! I have a dart board!” Mr. Wheeler ran to the pink dart board and rubbed his eyes, not believing his luck.<br />
The agent looked at his work. Unfortunately, there were still some visible traces of the old hanger on the board, such as strands of black mold all over it, but it shouldn&#39;t affect its usability.<br />
<br />
“And how do you have fun with a terrestrial dart board?” asked Mr. Wheeler, still spinning with joy.<br />
“(As with any other board),” the agent responded. “(You put it on your penis and twist it until you break it. If I were the one controlling the rest of my body, I would spin you on my penis so you would keep your barking hole quiet for once).”<br />
&quot;Hey! “You were asking *me*!” the Agent reprimanded. “A pool table is very easy to use. Do you see the central points?”<br />
The agent lifted the board by its handle to place it on the wall hanging by his office.<br />
Mr. Wheeler looked at the three large dots on the board. “Yes, one in the big part and others in the two lower ones”<br />
<br />
The Agent took some white pins. “The main objective of the game is to stick the pins into the points or targets.”<br />
“Oh, I see,” said the shorter alien. “But wait, wouldn&#39;t that be too easy? You just have to put the pins in the points, like this, right?” The shorter alien took a pin from the Agent and placed it on one of the points.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
What the hell had happened to him?! The trench coated alien had just picked him up by his penis, holding on to it like it was nothing! Worse yet, he could still feel the alien gripping him tightly! How was that possible?! His penis had not only become flat, but it was also hard! It had enlarged, it had flattened to the point that his semen had no way of coming out, and finally he had a hole that went through his glans as if it were nothing. And the aliens handled it like they owned it! Tim tried to scream, but his mouth was closed and he couldn&#39;t move it, much less make any sound through it!<br />
<br />
The short, chubby alien grabbed one of what looked like pins and placed it right above his abdomen... No... Right above his belly button!<br />
<br />
Mr. Enderson was correctly guessing what was about to happen, but he couldn&#39;t accept it.<br />
<br />
The round alien released and buried the pin right inside her open navel. Tim could feel the pin slightly penetrating his skin.<br />
<br />
The alien in the trench coat approached Tim cautiously and pulled out the pin.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that would be too simple. You can&#39;t just pick them up and put them down with your hands. You&#39;re supposed to throw them.&quot; The agent explained.<br />
&quot;Ooooh!&quot;<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Then Mr. Enderson put his claws on Tim&#39;s separated sperm. He took a position as a professional dart thrower and… Oh SHIT! It was then that Tim realized his destiny. It was a dart board! With his navel, year, and testicles acting as the targets, his penis the sword where it hangs, and the rest of his body was painted with makeshift circles and numbers and the aliens were about to make a match with him, he was aiming for one of his lower points, the two closest together: his testicles.<br />
<br />
(“Nooooooo”)<br />
<br />
The dart was thrown, time seemed to stop for a moment for Tim, but it was a matter of blinking before he began to mentally scream in pain, the dart had hit the center of one of his testicles, it went exactly in the right one and he . Totally nail it <br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome! I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have a lot of fun in this recreation room. I can&#39;t wait to redecorate all the other rooms! Earth culture is so fascinating! Thanks for your help, agent!”<br />
—No problem, I&#39;m just doing my job here. —The agent noted the hard work he had done. The room now looked like a proper Earthling recreation room thanks to the pool table, dartboard, and mini-golf course. He was about to leave when he decided to take another shot, he stood up as before and threw three more darts at the same time, all three embedded in Tim&#39;s other testicle making him scream internally.</p>
