<br />
Well.  The interview went better than he feared, Patten mused as he left the room following said interview.  Granted, they had called in George to provide some news segments as well, but, on the whole, he had handled himself pretty well.  True, Hireman would try to take parts of it and twist them, chiefly, his outright declaration of hatred for Hireman.  That, would be an issue, but at least people would be able to understand the reason why.  It wouldn't be an easy one to work through, but it could be done.  Especially when he considered every other attack that George, Molly and Tabitha had been forced to endure from Hireman.  Still, George and Barnes would be in the school for the rest of the day, and for as long as the camera crews remained as well, so he'd have plenty of time to discuss it with him later on.  As for Molly, he doubted ANYONE would take offense to her statements, herself being a direct target of Hireman's attacks.  So - in his own, honest opinion - she would be in the clear.  However, right now, he had to get back to his class, which happened to be the next door on the left.  He entered it to return to the second year class that he teached, took over from the aide - Stephen Peck - and resumed his teaching.  A class that was quiet for the most part, following his instructions clearly, doing their work.  Still, he did worry sometimes.  What would happen if Hireman had his way.  Though to that, he did what he could, to help Tabitha come out on top.  Another thing he mused when he could - which was not now - about was just what Clemens was doing right now.....<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Clemens Patten was busy at work, at the main Florida Zoo, specifically in the reptile house.  Finally able to use his legs properly following the mob attack some months ago, and using them for all they were worth.  Still being below 130Kg, he could use them for a good time, so long as he remembered his balance.  That long tail of his could be a problem at times, but he'd learned to handle it properly.  The van he used to travel around having had the driver's seat modified to accomodate his tail.  It was a sight for some, when in it, people saw a snake with arms driving a Transit, though the people working here had become used to it.  And it was a lot easier than trying to put it in front of himself.  Safer too.  His other main ride was his treasured Harley-Davidson, which he'd use for simple rides, or, when the weather was good, head into work on it.  Back to now, he was checking the temperature settings for the enclosures.  Too low, and they'd become lethargic and begin to go into a hibernative mode.  Too high, and they'd quickly overheat.  The main problem with being cold-blooded.  They needed their environment to help regulate their body temperatures.  One thing he was glad he still had, was that even though it was only 17 degrees in the room, his body temperature held at a healthy 36 degrees.  Not bad, he thought to himself.  He took the time to check the timers to be sure that the lights, heaters and coolers would work at the proper times, to properly mimic the outside world for them.  <br />
<br />
This formed the bulk of this particular day's work, that and the paperwork.  Lots and lots of paperwork.  Which needed to be done before the week was over.  So better to get it out of the way now, while he had the time.  setting himself down on a backless stool, by his main office desk where he'd returned too, he set to work.  Some were easy enough, a general record of the going ons around the area, attendance records, the simple things.  Others were more difficult, a setting out of the financal requirements and budget for the half year period up to April.  That would take him a while, but he managed to get through the worst of it by the day's end.  All in all, work had been nice and quiet for him.  Though he did like some excitement, he did prefer to take it a little easy every now and then.  Carefully closing his position, he checked to be sure the room would be secure for the rest of the night, then made his way to his van.  Heading there, he passed some of the staff who worked the late shifts here.  Some still gave him odd glances, but most were simply used to it by now, sometimes, both would apply to them.  Reaching his van, the door was unlocked and he carefully slid his tail through the gap made in the backrest before sitting down in the drivers seat.  The Diesel Engine fired up, surprisingy smooth compared to even five years ago, before backing out slowly, and heading for his home.  <br />
<br />
It took him about 20 minutes to reach the apartment complex where he lived.  Parking his van in the car park opposite, he exited and locked it before making his way across the structure to where he lived.  A task made easier thanks to the lifts that worked rather well, and that the nearest one was one the same floor as himself.  It took Clemens another five minutes to reach his apartment, which was about 2/3 of the way up.  Once inside, the very first thing he did was to greet it's other occupant.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Heya!  Misss me much?&quot;  He called out as his girlfriend came out of the kitchen to wrap him in a hug.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Clemens.&quot;  She replied, as they made the closest thing to a kiss they could, not easy when he had a snakes head, and, even though the tongue was like a human's in that it sat in the mouth and not under the inside of the mouth, it was still long and thin, with a forked end.  &quot;So how was work today?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ssurprisingly dull and boring.  But that'ss why the exiting days are so good.&quot;  Clemens chuckled away, releasing her so he could remove his coat and shirt, no tie since he didn't need one, and having one wasn't the safest move in his work.  Setting the coat by the pegs by the doorway and heading into their bedroom to put the shirt by a chair they kept in the room.  The wardrobe mirror showed him his build.  Slim, not too much in the way of muscle, and virtually no fat.  Total like of some mammeries like nipples, though it appeared that a few of the scales were raised to mimic them.  He considered something for a moment, before calling out...<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny.  I'm gonna get mysself more comfortable, okay?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot;  She called back, having returned to the kitchen.  <br />
<br />
And with that, the belt came off - right after the shoes and socks - allowing Clemens to unbutton his trousers front and back, which allowed them to drop down and hit the floor.  Stepping out of them, he picked them up and put them with the rest of his attire, before heading to the kitchen himself, and pulling Jenny into his now-nude frame, and making another near-kiss.  While it would be frowned upon anywhere else.  This was their own home, and so perfectly legal.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sso, what's dinner tonight?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;The usual.  Just a little spicier.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Nicce.&quot;  While he still couldn't handle anything other than meat and dairy products, some artificial flavourings could be managed easily enough, though it was hit-and-miss to find out which ones, and to mark them down accordingly.  The upshot being that the list of what he could handle had gone up a good deal.  And if he had read the reports right, some funding was being made somewhere to develop something that would aide in the digestion of what his system couldn't take, so that fruits and the like could go back on his menu.  Well, he'd know later, but for now...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, while we wait, what's your day been like?&quot;  He asked Jenny, who worked part-time at the IRS offices in the area.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Much like always.  People trying to get out of their taxes, applications for rebates and cuts, chasing up late and non-payers.  That sort of thing.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, bussy but dull then.&quot;  Not really a question.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much.  But the money's through, the payments made.  We'll be ready for next week.&quot;  Referring to that convention they had booked time for.  They both had the time off for it, and everything had been sorted.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet!&quot;  He felt his snout pull back slightly, the closest to a smile he could manage.  &quot;One thing's for sure.  We'll be the sstarring attractions!&quot;  He couldn't help but laugh at that one.  &quot;Got your part ready?&quot;  Referring to the costumes they had planned for it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Got yours?&quot;  Jenny countered.  <br />
<br />
&quot;One minute.&quot;  He made for the bedroom where the wardrobe was, and pulled out a special piece.  Made of a high-quality silk, and red and black, with certain snake symbols on it.  He slipped it on, the silk feeling wonderful against his scales.  Pulling it against his front, he reached for a custom belt, which he used to hold it closed around him.  Finally, the large hood went up to rest against the top of his head.  58 seconds later, he was back in the kitchen, and embracing Jenny again.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmmm.&quot;  She murmured.  &quot;Now this is something else.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot;  Clemens had deepened his voice as best he could, to try and imitate James Earl Jones' voice.  <br />
<br />
&quot;So?  What do you plan on doing now?&quot;  She asked him in a teasing voice.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What elsse?  Crush my enemies.  See them driven before me.  And hear the lamentationss of their women.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;That's Arnold.&quot;  She retorted.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah...&quot;  Was his only response, before they laughed at that part he did, and held onto each other for a couple of minutes longer until dinner was ready.  And after that, they'd catch the news on ABC, where a certain surprise would await them.</p>
