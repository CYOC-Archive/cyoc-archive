<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s Chronivac program popped up an indicator saying normal functions were unavailable in the pocket reality and the only edits while active where to the rules package itself. Jeff scowled at the unexpected limitation but reasoned that if he knew how he wanted to modify things directly, he would have. At least he had set himself up with the advantage he did.<br />
<br />
It was Friday, the school week had finished and as the garage door activated he was surprised at how long he had actually spent starring at the computer. Jeff went downstairs to greet his mom (Jane), noting it was a little later than usual for her to arrive home. &quot;Hey Mom, How was your day?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine honey, I had to stop at the store.&quot; She dropped a grocery bag on the counter along with her purse and keys. &quot;If I get started with dinner, would you finish getting the groceries inside and put away?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Jeff offered heading to the car. Jeff was a little disappointed that his first verbal agreement was so mundane, and it was odd that his mom worded it that way in the first place. &#39;Could you grab the groceries.&#39; would be the usual phrase. It stands to reason, Jeff concluded, that even if people weren&#39;t aware of the rule, using it would be a more effective way of getting things done and society would tend to incorporate it given the results...   <br />
<br />
Jeff grabbed bag after bag lugging it into the house. Gallons of milk, cases of pop, a handle of vodka and whiskey which went into the garage fridge for dad&#39;s game night, followed by two cases of beer. Jeff went inside once the vehicle was empty, still feeling strongly compelled to ensure all groceries are in their proper place.<br />
<br />
Moments later Jeff heard his dad (Mike) pull into the driveway and just after that, &quot;Hey champ, how was your day?&quot; Mike asked as he put his briefcase down.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was good. Mom just got home and asked me to put away the groceries,&quot; Jeff replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, gotcha. Listen, it&#39;s guys&#39; night with the boys from work tonight. We&#39;re going to hang out in the garage, like we do, smoke some cigars and play some cards.&quot; Mike smiled, &quot;You know how it is, you got somewhere to be? A friend&#39;s house you can hang at?&quot; He asked obviously hopeful the answer was yes.<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head, &quot;I&#39;m staying in tonight, no big plans.&quot; A mischievous thought wriggled its way into Jeff&#39;s brain. This was the perfect opportunity to test out the Chronivac program and see what the package could do!<br />
<br />
The family had a quick but hearty dinner, Mom made an early exit to get ready for her girls night leaving Jeff and Mike to finish eating and clean up. Mike&#39;s guests began to arrive around 7 and Jeff is left alone as guests congregate in the garage only entering the house to use the bathroom.<br />
<br />
With mom out for the evening, Jeff killed some time while planning exactly what his move is. He felt like a mastermind hatching a diabolical plan. He decided to wait and confront his dad around 9pm, challenging him to a game of rock paper scissors to take his place at guy&#39;s night. His hope was that after a few beers his dad would at least go through with the action and even if he lost his dad might still let him hang out now that he&#39;s no longer 13.<br />
<br />
As is customary with the group, upon someone&#39;s arrival a shot is taken to get the night started and then its usually beer or a mixed drink. Celebrations like a birthday, anniversary, or a rare hand like a royal flush being played spark another shot or two all around. <br />
<br />
The time came and Jeff made his way down to the garage. Jeff entered trying to acclimate to the stench of beer and smoke as he walked up to his dad. Grabbing his attention Jeff made his move. &quot;I&#39;ll play you a game of Rock Paper Scissors for your place at guy&#39;s night.&quot; Jeff held his hands out in classic starting position.<br />
<br />
It took Mike a few seconds to process what Jeff said and he stared at Jeff&#39;s hands letting out a soft chuckle. Mike had been drinking for two hours and was easygoing if not already drunk. &quot;Alright alright, take a seat, you should at least start learning a few hands...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Jeff asked, anticipating a game but getting instruction instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;You win. I give up, you&#39;re old enou...&quot; a wave washed through them and the pair shook their heads. Mike finished, &quot;I&#39;ll leave you to it.&quot; standing up and left the garage without gathering his beer or his cigarettes and lighter. He even left the cigar he had just started and set in the ash tray.<br />
<br />
Jeff wasn&#39;t sure if his dad was making a mean joke to underscore that Jeff really had no place at the table but while Jeff was questioning this, he instinctively sat in his father&#39;s vacated seat gathered the cards, shuffled, and dealt not realizing until several hands later that he shouldn&#39;t even know how to play...<br />
<br />
More than that, Jeff was more mindful of the crowd around him than before and even felt familiar with them catching on to some of the groups tells as if he knew them well. Jeff also occasionally checked up on everyone, grabbed them a beer and took their empty to the garbage. It wasn&#39;t until he started feeling funny that he realized he had been drinking beer since he sat down and had smoked the lit cigar his father left. Once that was done he went after his dad&#39;s pack of cigarettes, and nobody noticed it was our of place but him.<br />
<br />
The next morning Jeff was hung over, unaccustomed to alcohol and nicotine and he felt awful. Thankfully it was Saturday mid-morning. He enjoyed the experience but he was honestly glad it was over. Trying to recount it was foggy, and trying to discuss it with his parents got the illogical response of, &quot;Of course you can&#39;t drink or smoke until you&#39;re 21, unless its guy&#39;s night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was told to clean up the garage after &quot;his&quot; party, which his father normally did. Slowly it clicked. He had been so focused on the agreement that he took his dad&#39;s place at the gathering rather than asking his dad to give him &quot;a&quot; place at the party. That&#39;s why things got so weird, Jeff became the host and acted as Mike would have. The stale beer, cigarette and cigar butts disgusted him but he learned his lesson, he will need to be much more careful about how he words things from now on. On one of the tables was a glass fishbowl full of 10&#39;s and a 20 or two to cover the hosting expenses. Jeff pocketed it without thinking and didn&#39;t notice the wad of cash his formerly empty wallet held after he took his father&#39;s seat.<br />
<br />
The next week Jeff got back to his normal activities. He only had a few fleeting thoughts wanting to smoke or drink but did a decent job of putting everything about last Friday squarely in future Jeff&#39;s ballfield... &#39;That was an adult thing for adult Jeff to deal with, it was fun but is over.&#39; and that worked great. <br />
<br />
Until the following Friday evening at 7pm. The doorbell rang, Jeff felt compelled to answer, Alex was there, &quot;Hey, the garage was closed, we better open it for the gang.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me grab my dad.&quot; was what Jeff intended to say, instead it came out, &quot;I completely spaced and forgot to set up. Help me get ready and we can get that party starting shot sooner!&quot; It was then that Jeff realized he didn&#39;t limit his access to game night to last Friday! This was why he turned down his friends offer to go to the movies tonight earlier in the week! Jeff internally cringed realizing tonight will be an extra two hours of drinking.<br />
<br />
Mike stepped inside from smoking and grabbed Jeff as he was headed to the garage with Alex. &quot;Hey Jeff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was hopeful, surely his dad would stop this, or take over, or something! &quot;I uh, found these.&quot; he held out his cigarettes and lighter and was looking ashamed to have had them in his possession for any period of time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Jeff said surprised. Mike looked like he was about to get in trouble. &quot;Um, anything else dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike thought for a second, &quot;Yeah, hold on.&quot; Mike walked to another part of the house, Jeff didn&#39;t even realize he pulled out a cigarette and popped it in his mouth, pocketing the pack and holding onto the lighter for when he gets outside. A moment later Mike returned with 2 unopened packs of cigarettes. &quot;I found these too.&quot; he offered sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I have an idea, how about you take my place at game night!&quot; Jeff offered excitedly realizing he could fix everything now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Jeff, I don&#39;t know how to play, and gambling really isn&#39;t my thing, and I just work with those guys, I don&#39;t really &#39;know&#39; them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you!&quot; Jeff caught himself, obviously it&#39;s part of what Jeff took when he took his dad&#39;s place. &quot;I can teach you? I know you&#39;ll do well and the guys&#39;ll like you?&quot; Jeff was sounding desperate as Mike just shook his head no. Jeff didn&#39;t expect that response or know how to make him agree so he accepted defeat and grabbed the extra packs. &quot;Thanks.&quot; was all he could say so he headed to the garage with a heavy sigh. <br />
<br />
Until Jeff figures out how to fix this, on Friday nights from 7 till he goes to bed, he is the smoker, drinker, and gambler, and Mike at least thinks he has the rights of a 16 year old. Jeff stepped into the garage hitting the opener and lighting his cigarette.</p>
