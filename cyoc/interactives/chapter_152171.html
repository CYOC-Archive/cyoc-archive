<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tommy rode his new bike to his fathers address. <br />
While he changed Lucas and Chad he had made sure they would still be able to use some of their senses, making them even more sensible in the process. They could still see through the unblinking headlight, still hear through the handle bars and feel everything they touch. That made it rather painful for them being ridden, Chad more so than Lucas by kicking his balls, but the driving itself felt to them like running on their raw, nude skin from their feet and for Chad also his hands. They were linked to each other, but at the moment that link was blocked by Lucas shrunken plastic state.<br />
Reaching his destination Tommy first scanned the house with his laptop, finding that his father and his new wife were inside alone. Tommy decided to ring the bell and see how they would react. A couple of seconds later he heard someone nearing the door, but not opening it. Seconds later whoever was behind the door turned around and vanished back into the house. <br />
Tommy saw on his laptop that it was the wife that had checked the door and without even asking him what he want had returned to his fathers side. A bit angry, Tommy used the chronivac to make himself able to hear what the said inside just as the wife returned to his father. <br />
&quot;Who was it?&quot; his father asked his wife.<br />
&quot;Just a teen that smiled foolishly. I didn´t open the door, you know that kids and specifically teens are only trouble.&quot; she answered sounding really stuck up.<br />
&quot;You are right, children are always trouble. You know that was the reason I left my old wife, I didn´t want to have anything to do with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now Tommy was fuming outside. So his father had left his mother because of him. He let them freeze from the neck down before opening the front door with the chronivac, stepping inside and headed for the room where the frozen pair was sitting confused to their immobility. When they saw him, both their reactions where angry screaming, so Tommy started the changes he planned beforehand, starting with the wife.<br />
<br />
She suddenly fell silent, feeling pain inside her body. Her insides from the neck down were all vanishing save for her stomach with expanded to fill the void area completely. Her arms merged with her sides while her legs fused with each other. Her fused feet grew larger and rounder, and while her body between the feet and her head started to shrink down while changing into porcelain her head started to grow. But while expanding her head also changed form. While her mouth grew outwards all from her nose upwards her face pushed in, leaving her without said nose. Her lips parted, opening her changing mouth wide. While her teeth vanished and her lower lip changed into porcelain, her tongue got a hole in the middle, expanding until it covered most of the tongue. The tongue itself had grown to the point it was the same size as her mouth, now a toilet seat above her bowl, with was now her opened up stomach. Her upper lip expanded into the toilets new lid. The rest of her head had turned rectangular and hollowed out, turning into a water tank. Lastly her left eye and right ear vanished of the tank while the left ear expanded into a tube to refill the tank, her right eye opened wide before changing into the button to release the water. What was once the new wife of his father had been reduced into a porcelain toilet including a water tank also made of porcelain.<br />
<br />
His father looked shocked at his wife. He still hadn´t recognized his son, having not seen him in years. &quot;You know, you both brought that on yourself for the bad talking about mother and me, father.&quot;<br />
&quot;You are no son of mine. Change my wife back immediately, you bastard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy just started the changes for his father instead. Like with his wife his whole body hollowed out, save for his stomach with started to grow to fill the void. His legs fused with each other and his arms shorten into small grips. Then his whole body grew more cylindrical, save for the grips and his toes, which fused into a short pedal. His head, facing the ceiling, sunk into his body while all his features beside his mouth and nose vanished from his face. His mouth then opened wide before expanding to the edges of his face, pushing his nose to one edge. Then the nose itself expanded from the edge to cover the whole open mouth, turning into the new lid. Inside his stomach had filled everything before it turned into a plastic trash-bag. His father had become a simple pedal bin. <br />
Finally Tommy could smile down at them both. He had increased their senses of smell, taste and touch for their changed bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will smell and taste everything inside you. You both have the ability to dissolve whats inside you slowly. If someone flushes you all that&#39;s inside the bowl is absorbed into your porcelain skin, leaving you to taste and smell it for some time. And the trash-bag will be self-cleaning too, so it did never needed to be replaced. Also you can feel when someone pushes your eye to flush or your toes to open your lid. You will live forever in misery and alone, you don´t deserve to be mentally linked. Now then I will put you to your new homes.&quot; Soon the wife replaced the toilet inside his home bathroom, the drain attached but blocked so the punishment would work, not that anybody will notice the blocked drain. His father replaced the bin in the kitchen, but then Tommy decided to increase both of their punishments further by linking the wife to all the toilets in his school, letting their drains being blocked too while his father was linked to all bins in the house and the school, some of them without a lid. Nobody would think about the vanishing trash in the end. It was an addition to their punishment that they would be around the children in school for eternity. <br />
With them both away Tommy returned to his bike to drive home. There he restored Rick and his bike to their normal size before he finally unfroze his brother again. That evening they played together happily.</p>
