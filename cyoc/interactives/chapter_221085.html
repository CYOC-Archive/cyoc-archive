<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, my dad is like... um, a smart businessman, who is Asian and in his 40s?&quot; <br />
<br />
Luke looked annoyed at Dave, with him not giving a very good description of his dad! And said in his broken English, &quot;What that? You don’t tell, what,  looks like!&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave was surprised how Luke&#39;s broken English is getting worse and said, &quot;Well, he is not going to be too hard to see, he will be the only Asian man in the neighbourhood!&quot; <br />
<br />
Luke was about to carry on the argument but then he remembered something, he was meant to go on his second date with Sophie in like one hour! And he needed to think of something and decided to tell Dave, <br />
<br />
 &quot;Dave, me, Sophie, date, one hour?&quot; Luke was really hating his broken English now; he just hoped Dave understood. <br />
<br />
And luckily Dave smiled and said, &quot;Wait, are you trying to say that you and Sophie have a second date and it is in one hour?&quot; <br />
<br />
Luke nodded, not even wanting to hear what comes out of his now 35-year-old mouth that could not speak proper English. <br />
<br />
Dave then said, &quot;And I&#39;m going to guess you want my help?&quot; <br />
<br />
And once again Luke nodded his head. <br />
<br />
Dave knew that Luke was probably finding it hard to think of any ideas of how to save his relationship with Sophie, by not standing her up, but Dave had a good idea. <br />
<br />
 He knows that Luke won&#39;t like it, but it is the only one he could think of, so he picked up the Medallion and Luke&#39;s T-shirt and touched them together. He felt his body starting to change straight away, feeling his clothes getting tight. With Luke being nearly a head taller than him, he quickly stripped completely, feeling his new dick getting squashed in his now too small underwear, and saw how his skin was going paler and how he was getting more muscles, finding it fascinating how he was changing races going from Asian to white American! <br />
<br />
Once it was done, Dave could not help but smile, looking down at his bigger body, bigger muscles, and bigger dick. He knew he could easily fool Sophie that he is Luke now, and his plan is going to work.  <br />
<br />
He went over to where Luke left all of his clothes and started to get changed, hearing the really Luke say in a shocked man&#39;s voice, &quot;Why, you, me? I need, body, not you?&quot; Dave just kept on getting Luke&#39;s clothes on, not used to Luke&#39;s much longer, blond hair falling in front of his eyes and having to put it back to the side, every 5 seconds. and he said, &quot;Chill big guy, you said you did not want to stand up Sophie, so I am going to go in your place?&quot; Dave said this with his smile growing bigger, hearing his now deeper voice, now having Luke&#39;s voice. <br />
<br />
But Luke did not like the idea. He felt weird seeing his old body now standing in his shorts and socks and shoes, not wearing a shirt yet. His old body looked so small and skinny right now that he is nearly twice as tall as it and more than 10 times heavier than it. Looking down at the amazingly fat stomach and man bobs, and He said, &quot;No, you, bad, talking girls, and what about me?&quot; <br />
<br />
Dave felt a little offended hearing Luke say he is bad at talking to girls, well, he guessed he was not wrong, never having dated a girl yet, with both of them being 13 years old, and this being only the second date he had planned on going on ever.  <br />
<br />
But Dave is happily that he is going to go on it now and said, &quot;Well Luke, for one, I am as experienced with girls as much as you, so don’t tell me that I&#39;m bad with girls. And two, I will text Dad and tell him a Sumo man is here to stay for the night, with some of them doing so with us having a temple where they can pray and a ring where they can practice, and Dad is normally fine with it. So all you&#39;ve got to do is pretend that your name is Yamazaki Ryuji, and you will be able to talk in Japanese with him. So... it should be fine with him, you might even have fun? while I&#39;m out as you, and hopefully. I will be back later to see how you are getting on, but I will need to sneak in with being stuck in your body now... so see you in a couple of hours, and I will tell you how the date went, then&quot; <br />
<br />
And with that, he picked up Luke&#39;s phone and wallet, which was on the table, and walked out, seeing a shocked look on the Sumo man face that Luke is now stuck as. And once he got out the front door, he saw his dad looking at his phone, probably looking at the message he just sent him. He looked up and smiled and said, &quot;Hey Luke,&quot; and kept on walking when threw his front door, and shutting it, only seeing his son&#39;s best friend leaving, and not his son. <br />
<br />
Dave knows his dad is still not perfect with American customs and can come off as rude sometimes, with not even trying to talk to him as Luke,  <br />
<br />
but that does not matter right now. Dave was looking at the messages Luke and Sophie have sent each other, on Lukes&#39;s phone and he knew now he needs to meet her at the cinema in 10 minutes. But he would love to see how Luke acts with his dad, and he knows a lot of places where he can easily watch them both, without being seen. </p>
<hr/><h3>
But wasn&#39;t the whole point in him becoming Luke was to help Luke with Sophie?</h3>
