<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I still can't believe you didn't call me,&quot; Dave commented, &quot;even if only to say that you were running a brief mission to Illinois.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed and shook my head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you that I had more permanent job application stuff going on when you made the offer,&quot; I told him, &quot;and remember we had only JUST met then. Our present friendship didn't start until later, when I'd returned to Columbia Falls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And a wonderful friendship it is,&quot; Dave said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have said anything that has hinted that it wasn't?&quot; I teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Dave chuckled.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The drive back east was a quiet one and I spent most of my time listening to radio on the way back as I had no one riding with me for company. The radio proved to be a decent distraction, but it still seemed to be a longer drive &quot;home&quot; the the drive to Columbia Falls had been. I was pretty sure the reason for that was simple, Molly wasn't there to talk to.<br />
<br />
My mind dwelt on her as I drove &quot;home&quot;. Was she okay? Did Mr. Beauregard give her anymore grief? Was her Uncle feeding her? Was she able to control herself and not let her instincts see the children as a snack? These and other questions continually ran through my head as I drove, but I didn't have any ready answers for these questions. I could only hope that Molly was okay.<br />
<br />
I arrived home in the late afternoon three days after I'd left Columbia Falls. Dad was still at work from what I could tell, but my mother was home. I assumed that meant that I was expected. And I was, although I wouldn't know &quot;how&quot; I was expected until I went in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; I called as I went in through the garage entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;George, is that you?&quot; I heard an overjoyed voice call out.<br />
<br />
I'd barely shut the door behind me when my mother arrived in the entryway.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is good to have you HOME, George,&quot; my mother spoke.<br />
<br />
I sighed. Given her emphasis on the word &quot;home&quot;, I was fairly certain that she did not want me to return to Columbia Falls.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm only here for a short while,&quot; I told her, &quot;there is a lot of things I need to do once I get back.&quot;<br />
<br />
My mother gave a very depressed sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you and Molly have to move so far away?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Molly needs the space,&quot; I sighed, feeling like I was repeating this line, &quot;being around a lot of people that judge her like she is a mundane animal... it'll drive her crazy, mom, you have to know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; my mother responded in a depressed tone, &quot;believe me, I know... it's just that you're my only son, and I'm too old to be having any more...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly would NEVER harm me, mom,&quot; I cut her off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't mean anything like that,&quot; she replied, and then paused, &quot;I suppose it's an empty nest syndrome. It seems like yesterday you were a baby... and now you're going off to where I won't see you often... if at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can aways visit, mom,&quot; I told her, &quot;though, it'll take awhile for Molly and I to get a house or an apartment to rent.&quot;<br />
<br />
My other didn't answer right away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope the two of you are always happy together,&quot; she finally said after a moment.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mother really needs to let that stuff go,&quot; Dave commented, &quot;she should have been over all of that by then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she was over it,&quot; I told him, &quot;but when you love someone, it's tough to see them go.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
What I had brought with me was quickly unpacked in my old room, which hadn't been changed, and I spent the rest of the afternoon focusing on the application process for the Columbia Falls Police. Dad had successfully gotten my transcripts, and they were next to the computer my parents owned. After checking my transcripts, I set to work on getting a resume ready to take back with the transcripts. I had just finished them when my father returned from his day at work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there, George, good to see you,&quot; he said politely as I pulled the completed resume from the printer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks dad,&quot; I responded, &quot;and thanks getting the transcripts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome,&quot; he answered, &quot;how long do you expect to be around?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I may stay through tomorrow to recharge and let Molly's parents know that we'll be staying out in Columbia Falls,&quot; I answered, &quot;but no longer then that. Molly and I still have to look for a permanent place to stay and to make sure that we have some cash flow coming in.&quot;<br />
<br />
My dad nodded, &quot;I couldn't get a hold of them, George, they may not be in... and Molly might even call them from her Uncle's...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Given how they've treated her, I'd doubt that, dad,&quot; I sighed, &quot;they've treated her the way a zookeeper would treat a tiger IN the zoo, and she's resented that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, why would you tell them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because they're her parents and they deserve to know about their daughter's plans in life,&quot; I sighed again, &quot;and because part of me hopes that they will see past Molly's fur and recognize her as their daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly is incredibly lucky to have you as a boyfriend,&quot; my father told me, &quot;I'm sure you'll make a fine husband when you work up the courage to ask her to marry you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, dad,&quot; I smiled.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next afternoon I walked up the street to where Molly's parents lived. I was well after the end of the work-day, but wasn't close to diner time yet. I rung the doorbell and waited patiently for someone to answer it. After a few moments, Molly's mother came to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good afternoon, is there something I can do for you?&quot; she spoke in a very formal voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at the moment,&quot; I answered slowly, &quot;I' mostly here to relay some information concerning Molly, Mrs. Rhoer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has she attacked someone?&quot; Mrs. Rhoer asked.<br />
<br />
That threw me for a loop was that that was the first question she asked regarding her own flesh and blood. It was all unbelievable.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Mrs. Rhoer, there have been no problems of that nature, and Molly is in excellent health,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Mrs. Rhoer responded in an almost indifferent tone, &quot;so what news do you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the school in Columbia Falls hired her as a teacher's assistant,&quot; I told her, &quot;and their police department is willing to help me go through the training to join them, so we're intending to stay out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She will be staying with her Uncle?&quot; Mrs. Rhoer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Until we can find a place for the both of us,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I suppose you're here for her belongings?&quot; Mrs. Rhoer asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe the cloths that will fit her now, that she didn't take with her,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;but that's about all for now. Once we have a place of our own, we'll probably send for what else remains.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait here,&quot; Mrs. Rhoer instructed and disappeared into the house.<br />
<br />
I waited patiently on the doorstep of the Rhoer home until Mrs. Rhoer returned with an armful of silk dresses, which were about all that Molly could wear without over heating or having her fur agitated by the fabric. They were dumped into my arms with little if any ceremony. It sickened me that a parent could be so indifferent.<br />
<br />
&quot;These are all of them,&quot; Mrs. Rhoer spoke, &quot;have a good day.&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave a frustrated groan as the door was shut in my face, but at least I knew I'd accomplished what I had to in coming back. I still had to turn in the application materials and find a permanent home for Molly and I, and I would need to return to Columbia Falls to do that.</p>
