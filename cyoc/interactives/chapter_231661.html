<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Logan, an nerdy, awkward teenaged boy still going through his growth spurt, is in his room late one Friday night reading the latest book of his favorite sci-fi novel series when he hears his single father, Seth, return home. His dad didn&#39;t normally come home this late, but he told Logan before leaving for work that morning that he would be attending a going-away celebration for one of his co-worker friends and not to wait up for him.<br />
He looks out the window and watches one of his dad&#39;s co-workers drive up to the house, get out of the car, help a visibly drunk Seth climb out of the passenger seat, and then struggle to support his staggering dad to the front door. After fumbling with his keys, Seth manages to unlock the front door and stumble inside, upon which his co-worker leaves him there to get back in his car and go home.<br />
Logan listens as his father&#39;s heavy footsteps make their way up the stairs, past Logan&#39;s door, and into his bedroom, then a loud creak as his dad flops onto his bed. After a long silence, Logan begins to hear loud snores.<br />
Logan gets up and enters his father&#39;s room to find him sprawled out on the bed, half-undressed before passing out. Logan, with his thin and lanky build, struggles to finish undressing Seth&#39;s slumbering muscular, hairy frame down to his underwear so he could throw a bedsheet over him and let him sleep the alcohol off. After ten minutes and a good amount of sweating effort, Logan stops to catch his breath and look at the little progress he&#39;s making stripping the clothes of his his dad&#39;s huge body, and and he starts to seriously entertain a though that&#39;s been in the back of his head for a while.<br />
When Logan was a few years younger, when Seth decided he was old enough to understand their ability to detach their heads. In the comforting familiarity of Logan&#39;s bedroom, Seth carefully explaining what he was about to do so Logan wouldn&#39;t panic, then demonstrated their gift by gently manipulating Logan&#39;s neck until his head popped off his shoulders. Logan was fascinated to discover he could still control his body, and Seth had him walk his headless body around the room to get a feel for controlling his body remotely. After re-attaching Logan&#39;s head, he had him detach his head on his own. Taking Logan&#39;s head and placing it on the dresser facing them, Seth had Logan sit his headless body side-by-side with him on Logan&#39;s bed. Seth then detached his own head and then instructed Logan to do the same. Seth then carefully maneuvered his head over Logan&#39;s body and then lowered it until it fused with his son&#39;s body. Logan was surprised to feel all sensation from his headless body vanish and see his dad&#39;s large body go limp and fall back on the mattress, with his father in full control of his young body. After restoring themselves back to normal, Seth told the younger Logan that while their abilities were fantastic, they had the temptation for abuse, and made him promise not to take over another person&#39;s body without permission.<br />
But now in this moment, Logan rationalizes that he should get his dad in bed proper and not in this condition. Although his dad can&#39;t give his permission, the circumstances justify an exception. So Logan detaches his dad&#39;s slumbering head and gently places it on a pillow, the reaches up to his neck and detaches his. Just as Seth showed him before, Logan carefully positions his head between Seth&#39;s vacant shoulders, and then moves it closer until it fuses with his dad&#39;s body. Logan sees his body go limp, and can feel it fall on top of his dad&#39;s body, which is under his full control. With his dad&#39;s strength he easily rolls his body to the side, and then repositions it for later. Logan then stands his dad&#39;s body up to finish removing its clothes.<br />
Stripped down to only a pair of boxers, Logan catches sight of himself in the mirror. Standing in front of it and taking in the full view, he stretches and flexes his dad&#39;s muscles, discovering how strong it is. As he has his dad&#39;s body rub itself all over with its hands, he starts feeling light-headed - the alcohol in Seth&#39;s body is starting to have an effect on Logan.<br />
Realizing that he might soon become as incapacitated as his dad&#39;s sleeping head, Logan leaves his dad&#39;s bedroom and starts walking to the front door to make sure it was closed and locked. As he descends the stairs, his dad&#39;s cock swings and rubs against the loose fabric of the boxers, and by the time Logan reaches the front door, his dad&#39;s body is past semi-erect with a prominent tent. After make sure the door was locked, Logan can&#39;t help himself and released his dad&#39;s cock through the boxer fly and wraps his dad&#39;s hand around its girth. He slowly strokes his dad&#39;s cock back and forth in the large hand, and drops of pre-cum started to lubricate the palm.<br />
Caught between what he needs to and the pleasure he is experiencing from his dad&#39;s body, Logan makes his way back to his dad&#39;s bedroom. By now his dad&#39;s cock is at incredible full erection, and his dad&#39;s sexual urges cloud Logan&#39;s mind. As his dad&#39;s hand fondles the slick cockhead and foreskin, the other strokes the hairy chest and causes a sensitive nipple it become erect. Logan&#39;s eyes then fall on his own young body, and under the influence of alcohol and arousal he starts to rationalize something further - how could he not consent to himself?</p>
