<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason scratched at his stubble, which was a day short of becoming a beard.  As he did so, he got a good look at the new hair covering his arms.  He&#39;d never thought he would ever be a hairy guy.  But here he was, one drink later, a decent covering all over his body.  He glanced at the half-full pint glass, and the half-full bottle sitting next to it.  More was tempting, but he saw just how potent this stuff was.  A little went a long way, and Tina warned him about going too far.<br />
<br />
Jason looked back up at the bartender, still waiting for his answer.  &quot;Uh, thanks, Tina, but I think I&#39;ll hold off on the Fuzz Muster for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
She grinned.  &quot;Sure thing.  This newbie&#39;s got brains.  Some newbies get a little... greedy when they come here for the first time.  I usually cut them off before they&#39;ve had too much, but I&#39;ve seen a few... interesting cases.&quot;  She reached for what was left of his drink.<br />
<br />
Jason held up a hairy hand to stop her.  &quot;No, no.  Leave it, if you could.  Just in case I change my mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
She raised an eyebrow and removed her hand.  &quot;Alright, have it your way.  So, if we&#39;re putting the Fuzz Muster to the side for now, do you see anything else you&#39;d like to try?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason looked down at his reflection, admiring his new, hairy features.  He then frowned.  All this new hair didn&#39;t look quite right on him.  Usually hirsute men were a little thicker than the average man.  They had a substantial body matching their substantial hair.  Jason was still skinny, his twiggy arms resting on the table looking odd with their out-of-place covering of hair.  If this hair were to look proper on him, he&#39;d need more substance.  He glanced back up at the labels.  A couple different ones caught his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tina, what are Belly Buster and Muscle Toner?&quot;<br />
<br />
She grinned.  &quot;Oh, come on, newbie.  You should know by now that I&#39;m not that kind of gal.  If you want to see what they do, you have to try them, first.  Hey, if you want, I can mix them together for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason considered her offer, but denied it with a shake of his head.  &quot;Thanks, but no.  I&#39;d like to try them alone, first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina nodded, appreciating his decision.  &quot;Works for me.  Which one do you want to try, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm, let&#39;s try the Belly Buster.  It&#39;s not dangerous, is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughed as she whipped out a bottle of Belly Buster, expertly pouring it into a new glass with a flourish.  &quot;Newbie, anything&#39;s capable of being dangerous.  It all depends on how you use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason tilted his head toward her, his mouth set in a frown.  &quot;Do you ever give a straight answer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina set the full pint glass and the mostly empty bottle in front of him and put her hands on her hips in a defiant stance.  &quot;Not if I can help it.  Enjoy, newbie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason was about to raise the glass to his lips when a strong pat on his shoulder made him jerk in surprise, spilling some of the liquid on the counter.  Tina frowned and immediately began to sop it up with her bar rag.  Jason turned to see a young man, about his age, with a short beard and deep, black hair.  The man grinned at him and gave Jason&#39;s shoulder another pat.  &quot;Don&#39;t mind Tina.  She just likes to give the new guys a hard time.  Sorry for staring earlier.&quot;  The man turned to Tina.  &quot;Just letting you know I&#39;m leaving, Tina.  Don&#39;t leave the poor guy in too bad of a state.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina rolled her eyes, finishing cleaning the counter of the Belly Buster elixir.  &quot;Yeah, yeah.  Don&#39;t get in any trouble, Frank.  I won&#39;t cover for you, again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason studied the man carefully.  He did bare a passing resemblance to the old man from before, but this guy looked like he could be his grandson!<br />
<br />
Frank laughed.  &quot;Don&#39;t you worry about that.&quot;  He gave Jason&#39;s shoulder one final pat.  &quot;Take care, son.&quot;  Frank chuckled to himself before turning around and leaving through the front doors.<br />
<br />
Jason turned quizzically back toward Tina.  &quot;So, what was that all about, anyw-&quot;  But Tina was gone.  He could spot her at the far end of the counter serving more strange elixirs.  Jason tried to recall what the people looked like when he first entered the bar, but he hadn&#39;t been paying any attention to them.  He was curious what changes they had chosen to undergo.  He watched as one man put a bright pink liquid in a martini glass to his lips.  As he drunk it, his facial features seemed to refine, becoming more delicate as his lips pouted out and his hair grew out some.  Was he becoming a woman?  The man brought his glass down and shot Jason a glance, who quickly looked away.<br />
<br />
Speaking of changes...  Jason looked down at the skinny, hairy hand holding the yet-to-be drunk Belly Buster.  He took a breath and took a swig, tossing the mouthful of beverage around his mouth before swallowing it.  It had a strong, savory flavor, like he was eating a steak.  The liquid sat heavy in his stomach, but it wasn&#39;t uncomfortable, just filling, as though he&#39;d eaten a full meal.  He took another drink, repeating the process.  As he drank, he could feel a pressure building in his stomach, like he&#39;d inhaled too much air.  He looked down and could see a subtle roundness pressing out on his previously loose graphic tee.  He looked into the mirrored counter.  Under the thick stubble, he could see his cheeks didn&#39;t look as gaunt as they had before.  Nor did his arms look as twiggy.  They had flesh to them, looking more like an average man&#39;s build, as opposed to a skinny one.  He took a couple more deep drinks, closely monitoring his body for changes.  His stomach seemed to swell out more, going form a subtle roundness to a definite beginner&#39;s gut.  His love handles began to fill out, giving his body more width.  He felt his sleeves fill up as mass was added to his arms.  Now it was hard to believe they&#39;d ever been twiggy.  He watched his face as his cheeks filled out, giving his face a rounder shape.  The flesh under his chin drooped, the sagging skin considering becoming an additional chin should more weight be acquired.  Jason also felt his pants begin to become uncomfortably tight.  Not only was his growing belly pressing on his waistband, but his enlarged behind was beginning to feel compressed in its denim confines.  His widening thighs were really beginning to feel constrained, as well.<br />
<br />
Tina made another pass down the bar, grinning as she passed by Jason.  &quot;Not bad.  How&#39;re things going?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason winced.  &quot;A little tight.  Down there.  If you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina glanced down at his round stomach.  &quot;I can imagine.  Well, don&#39;t be shy.  You can take them off if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason&#39;s eyebrows popped up in surprise.  &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina chuckled.  &quot;Well, when you have drinks that can drastically alter the human form, you have to cut a little leeway when it comes to your customers.  Go on.  You wouldn&#39;t be the only one.  Unless you&#39;d like to completely shred those pants of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason glanced around.  Indeed, he did spot a few customers in varying stages of undress, though not too many.  One man was sitting in a booth in a corner in nothing but his underwear, drinking something from a shot glass.  With each toss of a glass his muscles seemed to dramatically swell in size.  There was one man in a chair at a nearby table with his shoes and socks off, slowly sipping a bright yellow drink with a crazy straw.  He was staring intently at his toes as he did so.  With each sip of the straw this feet seemed to subtly increase in size.<br />
<br />
Tina tapped the bar with her fingernail, regaining Jason&#39;s attention.  &quot;And, if you find you like the way you look, but your clothes no longer fit you, we have some loaners in the back.  As a side note, if you have any clothes you don&#39;t want anymore feel free to bring them by.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason nodded and, after a moment’s hesitation, undid the button and zipper of his pants.  He sighed as some of the pressure was released.<br />
<br />
Tina cleared her throat.  &quot;One last thing.  Just a hygiene policy.  If you are planning to undress, I will ask you to leave the bar counter.  I don&#39;t really want half naked people this close to the drinks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason nodded sheepishly, his cheeks flushing.  &quot;Right.&quot;  He picked up his glass of belly buster and hopped off the bar stool.  He staggered slightly as he adjusted to his new weight.  He felt very heavy.  He must&#39;ve gained well over 50 pounds by this point.  And it all seemed to be fat, with perhaps just enough muscle to keep him from getting bogged down by his new weight.  He made his way uncomfortably over to a nearby booth, setting his glass on its mirrored surface.  After some struggle, he managed to pull off his jeans, revealing, much to his embarrassment, his now-too-tight boxers and wider thighs which were covered in hair all the way down to his ankles.  He marveled for a moment at the hair coverage before slipping into the booth before he could be gawked at any more.  Now that he was out of his restraints, he took another few drinks of the Belly Buster.<br />
<br />
His stomach continued to expand, becoming large and round.  His chest began to develop a pair of drooping moobs.  They weren&#39;t anything too series, but they were certainly there.  His thighs widened another degree and he could hear the seams of his boxer straining.  He really hoped he wouldn&#39;t end up flashing his goodies for the whole bar to see.  The flesh under his chin finally gave in, becoming a second chin.  Though, it wasn&#39;t immediately visible given all the stubble.  Jason looked his hands over, staring at the soft, plump, hairy digits that used to be long and thin.  His belly had long since outgrown his shirt, forcing it up and over its curved surface, exposing the entirety of its round, hairy form.  His stomach drooped over his waistline, hanging down over the lip of his tiny boxers.  <br />
<br />
He stared at his round face in the mirrored surface of the booth table.  He played with his soft, round cheeks and drooping second chin, amazed at his own transformation.  He experimentally tried squishing his round cheeks, making several faces at himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason jerked in surprised, his body jiggling with the movement.  He quickly glanced up at the interloper, once again embarrassed.<br />
<br />
Tina chuckled at him.  &quot;Relax, newbie.  It&#39;s only me.  I brought you something.&quot;  She dropped a large pair of sweatpants in his lap.  &quot;Just though you might like these before things get a little too tight for you.&quot;  She frowned at his exposed stomach.  &quot;You want I should get you a new shirt, too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason struggled to pull the tiny graphic tee off his larger, rounder, form.  He must have gained a hundred pounds by this point, if not more.  He winced as several of the tee&#39;s seams popped, but he eventually got it off in more or less one piece.  &quot;No, it&#39;s fine.  I think I&#39;ll be good shirtless for now.&quot;  He looked down at his round, hairy torso.  Though he&#39;d felt it before, he was still surprised at just how hairy he&#39;d gotten.  The extra hair now looked like it fit him at his new girth.  He was now a man of appropriate substance.<br />
<br />
Tina shrugged.  &quot;Suit yourself.  I&#39;ll bring your Fuzz Muster over, too.  When you decide on what you want next, just give me a holler.  I&#39;ll be right over.&quot;  She turned on a heel and made her way back to her station.<br />
<br />
Jason glanced around, realizing he hadn&#39;t seen any other servers.  There was no wait staff or other bartenders of any kind.  Did Tina just run this place by herself?  He glanced around his booth and saw a drinks menu lying nearby.  He pulled it out and looked over the impressively long list of strange drinks.</p>
