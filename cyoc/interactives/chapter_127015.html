<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After grabbing himself an egg cell from the hospital. He drove back home while laughing to himself.<br />
<br />
When he got home, he made sure to lock the doors and ran to his room. He placed the little plastic canister on the floor. He removed all his clothes and sat in front of it.<br />
<br />
He was excited to meet his son. He was smiling from ear to ear. He started to jack off, slowly but full of pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;U-Ahh yes!&quot; He began moaning to himself. His deep voice was taking over the whole room.<br />
<br />
Soon, when he feel like he&#39;s about to cum, he opened the canister with his one hand and blasted the cum into it. He closed the canister and cleaned his dick first.<br />
<br />
While carrying the canister, he walked to the Chronivac and ran up the scanner. The chronivac showed an empty stats.<br />
<br />
Subject: -- Castellanos<br />
Age: fertilized (3 minutes and counting)<br />
Height:--<br />
Weight: --<br />
Ethnicity: 25% Greek/25% American/50% Korean<br />
Sexuality: --<br />
Relationships: Jeff Castellanos (Father)/Chloe Kim (Mother)<br />
<br />
He was shocked to see his son&#39;s Ethnicity and who owns that egg cell. A mixture of Greek, American and Korean. What will his son look like.<br />
<br />
He then started to fill it up. Changing it into<br />
<br />
Subject: Mark Castellanos<br />
Age: 16<br />
Height: 6&#39;5&quot;<br />
Weight: 170 lb<br />
Ethnicity: 25% Greek/25% American/50%Korean<br />
Sexuality: Heterosexual<br />
Body type: Muscular<br />
Body Hair Index (0-10): 5<br />
Penis Length (Erect): 9 in.<br />
Circumcised: Yes<br />
Relationship Status: None<br />
Relationships: Jeff Castellanos (Father)<br />
<br />
Since he doesnt want the owner of the egg cell to get involved. He removed her from the list but let his son get the Korean traits, since hes curious of what he will look like.<br />
<br />
As soon as Jeff was satisfied with the changes. He clicked enter and windows popped out.<br />
<br />
ALTER WORLD TO FIT?<br />
<br />
Beneath it were two boxes. <br />
CHANGE NON-USER MEMORIES?<br />
ALTER WORLD COMPLETELY TO FIT?.<br />
<br />
He then clicked yes to both and the rotating hourglass appeared on the screen again.<br />
<br />
Soon, he noticed the red tiny dot in the canister. Realizing that it was an embryo, he ran to his bed, lied down and he poured it above his abs.<br />
<br />
The embryo started to grow quickly. From its stage, it became a fetus, and then into a child.<br />
<br />
He stood up and carried the child as it began to cry. Jeff took a look at the mirror and saw that his body hair looked a lot thicker than lately.<br />
<br />
The baby grew a year and stopped crying. Jeff had a good look at him. Mark, the baby, got the greek skin tone but a little paler. He kissed Mark on the forehead and he giggled.<br />
<br />
Again, Mark grew another year but faster. He grew in height and from top to toetips, he got as long as Jeff&#39;s torso. Baby fat started to melt a little and he became a little thinner. Jeff let him go and placed him on the floor as he became a five year old. Jeff noticed that Mark looked a lot asian than greek, except that he got his skin tone. His eyes are shaped like thin almonds. He grew deep brown hairs on his head.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt something in him that changed as well. He took a look at the mirror and saw that he grew in age as well. He was now 31. 26 plus 5 years. He grew a lot muscular and hairs on his dick was gone, guessing that he shaved. His hands and face looked a lot more mature as well and his voice is a little deeper. With all these changes, he&#39;s still growing. In fact, few gray hairs started to appear in his head. It might be due to all the years of stress. In his new age, 38, he is still young to have white hairs.<br />
<br />
38. That makes Mark 7 years older. He was about to check on Mark when someone called his name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad! God please cover yourself with towel!&quot; Jeff&#39;s heart jumped. He got startled by Mark&#39;s voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Jeff said and pulled himself a boxer short from hus drawer and wore it.<br />
<br />
When he&#39;s done. He took a glance in the mirror and saw himself a lot older again. 20% of white hairs appeared in his head. His face looked a little wrinkled but the muscular body kept hard. He saw Mark in the mirror. He checked him out while looking through the mirror.<br />
<br />
The chronivac beeped and notified that the transformation was done. Mark is now a 16 year old teen with a muscular body. Hard pecs on his chest and 6 pack abs. His biceps were big too. He looks a lot Asian by his face except his nose that looks like it&#39;s from Jeff and except his skin which was tanned. Semi faux hawk hair style is on top of his head. He didnt really got a good look on his dick because Mark was already wearing his shorts that time.<br />
<br />
Jeff had a head ache. It was all the new memories flodding in. They were going to the mall today for shopping, thats why they&#39;re changing clothes.<br />
<br />
Jeff noticed his hair wet. He probably took a bath lately.</p>
<hr/><h3>
What will Jeff do next?</h3>
