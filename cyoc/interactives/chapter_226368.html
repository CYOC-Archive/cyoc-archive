<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fourteen year old Billy McMillon made his way down to JoAnne&#39;s office.  On the way there, he saw what appeared to be a new teacher and had punched him in the shoulder.  Craig Bennet felt the sting of the punch, but didn&#39;t say anything except, &quot;Hope your day gets better!&quot;.  The coach knew that now wasn&#39;t the time to discipline him and thus let Billy go on his way.  Billy forced his way into JoAnne&#39;s office, sat down in her seat, and rested his feet on her desk knocking over the nesting cups onto the floor.  JoAnne, for her part, didn&#39;t show her anger and instead calmly walked to the door, shut it, and collected the nesting cups off of the floor, neatly stacked them back together and placed them back on her desk.  &quot;What do you want, BITCH!!!&quot;, spat Billy.  &quot;Billy, we really need to discuss your behavior.  It&#39;s extremely toxic to this school and you&#39;re a serious threat to everyone in this school, including yourself.&quot;, JoAnne said calmly.  Just as JoAnne was about to pull out Billy&#39;s records, Billy&#39;s nineteen year old sister, Morgan, entered the room.  The goth girl did get into mischief every now and again, but generally she was a good student.  She intentionally decided to fail twelfth grade last year so that she could keep up with her brother and try to keep him out of trouble.  Sometimes, she&#39;d skip school to help out with various non-profit functions like collecting food for the food pantry.  She&#39;d always get caught by the truancy officer, but he&#39;d just let her continue doing what ever good deed she was doing and radio in that she&#39;d been located and was safe.  And so, Morgan continued to have her bad-girl goth image while secretly doing good for the community.  Billy was both embarrassed and speechless knowing his sister busted in on his discipline session.  &quot;Morgan.  What are you doing here?&quot;, asked JoAnne.  &quot;I find what you&#39;re doing here to be quite........ interesting, Mrs JoAnne.  I just watched you turn our coach into a little girl and a younger student into our new coach.  And now I see you&#39;re going to do something to our resident brat!  You see, JoAnne, In case you haven&#39;t noticed, I&#39;m not too eager to give up my high school career  because I&#39;m constantly trying to keep your little guest out of trouble.  I&#39;m here because I want to help you...... provided you help me as well.  I want in on this little punishment, JoAnne!  I&#39;d like to keep an eye on my little brother while getting the most I can from this school.&quot; said Morgan.  JoAnne&#39;s heart sank.  Unfortunately, Morgan knew her little secret.  But, at the same time, Morgan did ask for what&#39;s coming and she could be a good help to her little brother.  JoAnne looked up at Morgan a little saddened by this turn of events and asked, &quot;Are you sure you want this?&quot;  Morgan, being all cocky, replied, &quot;Yup!&quot;, with a grin.  JoAnne then began to pull both students&#39; records on her laptop and change them:<br />
<br />
Millie McMillon<br />
Age: 4<br />
Class: Special Education<br />
<br />
Special Needs:<br />
Millie wears diapers at this time and is unable to be potty trained.  Millie wears a bib at all times because she constantly drools.  Millie uses a special needs stroller because she is unable to walk and because it helps prevent her from injuring other students.  For staff convenience, her special needs stroller has a detachable activity and feeding tray.<br />
<br />
Individualized Education Plan:<br />
1:  Millie will be introduced to solid foods.  She will learn to use her tongue to push food from the front of her mouth to the back without spitting food out or choking.  She should only be fed Stage One baby food using a silicone feeding spoon.  At this time she should also be introduced to a silicone special needs spoon with a mouth shield since she also uses a pacifier.  This is to prepare her for learning how to hold a spoon later on when she starts to feed herself.<br />
2.  Millie will be introduced to self soothing behaviors such as sucking on a pacifier or hugging a stuffed animal to self-regulate emotions since she has a tendency to hit her head or other people.  She will at all times wear her special needs helmet and safety mittens to prevent injury to herself and others<br />
3. Millie will be slowly introduced to other students in the class and her sister for side-by-side play in order to promote healthy social skills.<br />
<br />
Morgan McMillon<br />
Age: 7<br />
Class: Special Education<br />
<br />
Special Needs:<br />
Morgan has attachment issues with her younger sister and will become worried and anxious if separated.  Morgan will unnecessarily tattle tale on her little sister for minor things<br />
<br />
Individualized Education Plan:<br />
1.  Morgan will work on Pre-K level math<br />
2. Morgan will work on Pre-K level letter recognition<br />
3. Morgan will explore simple science lessons such as finding bugs in nature and water play. Millie, her sister, should be included when possible<br />
4. Morgan will work on her gross motor skills.  She will play simple games like throwing a large ball over her head or bowling.  Her sister, Milly, should be included when possible.<br />
5. Morgan will work on building social skills using play.  Some examples of play are using a sand box, playing house, and using Duplo blocks to build things with her peers.  Millie, her sister, should be included when possible.<br />
6. Morgan continues to struggle with potty training and should continue to be encouraged to use a special needs potty every hour.  The teacher will need to assist in undressing and dressing Morgan and clean Morgan with a wet wipe when finished urinating or having a bowel movement.  Teacher will track when Morgan uses the special needs potty and also when Morgan wets or messes her disposable training pants.  Morgan will be encouraged to pull up or pull down her disposable training pants, but assistance may be required if she struggles with this task.<br />
<br />
After re-typing both students&#39; profiles and &quot;updating&quot; their IEPs, JoAnne merely printed them out and handed each student their copy.  Although it was a double edged sword, Morgan was finally happy that her little brother got his justice.  The idea of her telling the special education teacher every time her little brother took a shit in his pants made her laugh.  It was too rich......until she realized that she, too, would run the risk of filling the seat of her panties with mushy poo if she wasn&#39;t too careful.  It didn&#39;t matter to her, though.  She&#39;d get more time in school like she&#39;d asked for while also looking after her brother, soon sister.  She&#39;d just have to take the bad with the good.    Meanwhile, Billy was pissed.  His seat had already started to turn into a special needs stroller with tray in place and had trapped him in.  He was fighting and lashing out and screaming and cursing, but no amount of thrashing and cursing would help him out of his soon-to-be-stroller that was just more and more trapping him into it.  Both teens felt their underwear bunch up.  Morgan rudely lifted up her skirt and noticed that she was wearing Pinky Pie and Rainbow dash on her training pants.  She had secretly liked the show and was happy that JoAnne did her a solid.....at least on that front.  Morgan then lowered her skirt and watched as her short black dress became a short pink Rainbow Dash dress that didn&#39;t quite reach the bottom tip of her training pants.  She imagined that she&#39;d be the cutest girl in Special Ed.  Morgan then turned her head over to her brother to see that his clothes changed into a soft blue and teal special needs onesie that accentuated the bulge of his diaper.  Morgan noticed the zippers running up his back and through his crotch.  The onesie also literally stretched all the way down to his feet replacing his shoes with grippy soles.  He was struggling against the harness of his stroller and banging his knees into the padded knee abductor.  And no matter how hard he tried, he couldn&#39;t get his feet out of the foot cups that were securely holding his feet to the foot deck of his stroller.  Next, the physical regression started to kick in.  Breasts shrank to nothing, cheeks got puffier, hair got finer, teeth became baby teeth, and height got shorter.  However, the stroller and the kids&#39; clothes shrank with them.  At this time, JoAnne grabbed the pink special needs helmet off her desk and said, &quot;You need this!&quot;  Billy was still thrashing about trying to resist his doom as his hair grew slightly longer and grew pig tails.  But, he was no match for JoAnne as his muscle mass had diminished to that of a little girl&#39;s.  In very little time, JoAnne had secured the helmet on Billy and yanked his pig tails through the holes in the helmet provided for them and buckled his chin strap.  Billy never paid attention to when his penis shrank into a vagina because he was struggling to keep JoAnne from putting mittens on his hands and securing them.  Once Billy made the transition from male to female, the last change occurred unnoticed to either child.  Seven-year-old Morgan slowly lost her poise to the jittery and carefree movements of a two-year-old.  Meanwhile, Millie traded all of the spit of a fourteen year old bully for the adorable spit that was forming bubbles between his lips.  Fortunately, the bib she now wore was catching the drool.  Millie was still hitting herself in the head with her padded fists, but she did little damage because of her hard special helmet.  JoAnne knew that she needed to redirect Millie and so grabbed the colorful nesting cups off her desk and started to show Millie how to play with them.  Millie had happily accepted two of the cups and started bashing them together which for JoAnne, was better than having Millie bashing her head with her fists.  Morgan started jumping up and down and then pressed her hands against her crotch, &quot;Nee da potty!&quot;, she said.  And so, JoAnne knew what she needed to do next, she called the special education assistant to come and collect her new charges so that the older one could make it to the potty chair before she peed herself.</p>
