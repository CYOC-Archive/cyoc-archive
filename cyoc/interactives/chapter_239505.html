<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Teri’s powers opened a world of possibilities. Perhaps most interestingly was the fact that, unlike her wife’s parasitizing power, her attached body parts didn’t seem to propagate across bodies. The Mary who had attached two of Teri’s breasts was the only seven-breasted Mary in the house. To keep things from getting too far out of hand at the moment, you decided to not bring in any more bodies other than the one you had in the kitchen at the moment. <br />
<br />
Seeing the predatory look in not just your eyes, but in the eyes of everyone else as well, Teri let out a whimper.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry dear, I’ve learned to love being so intimate with so many people and I’m sure you will as well.” Mona’s original body ran her hands along the ten cocks she now had, teasing both herself and her wife simultaneously. “But before I throw you to the wolves, let me have your head.”<br />
<br />
Teri reluctantly pulled her head off and handed it to Mona, who promptly stuck it onto the end of her left crotches centre cock. As soon as Teri’s head regrew Mona held out a set of hands expectantly. The next head went on the centre cock of her right crotch.<br />
<br />
“There we go, now were both joined together on both of our bodies!” Mona used her lowest pair of hands to stroke her new Teri-cocks to climax, her wife’s dick-mounted heads sputtering cum as the newly regrown head on Teri’s main body mewled in pleasure. “Alright everyone! Form an orderly line, one body per spot!”<br />
<br />
At Mona’s prompting almost everyone rushed to get in line. The only ones not lining up was Julie—who was clearly not eager to have her mother’s parts attached to her body—alongside a few drones from both Susie and your daughters to keep her company. Luckily, your body was the first in line, meaning you got first pick of any additions. Since Teri was nearly half as tall as you it felt a little weird to be looming over her like this, looking at her like a prime cut of meat. She blushed and covered herself as you leered, clearly embarrassed about how her wife was hawking her parts away.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, she loves this.” reassured one of the heads next to you. “You can’t be willing to let your succubus wife infect you with her very body and not be just as kinky yourself.” Teri shivered as a head Mona’s original body spoke next. You manage to catch the shortstack’s tongue licking her lips. ““““““Besides, since It’s just as much my body as it is hers now, so I’m well within my rights to give any part of it away!”””””” The final, joyous addition came from all of the mouths on Teri’s hands.<br />
<br />
“Well then, if any part is mine to take, then how about a few of those mouthy hands of yours?” Teri blushes a bit deeper as she rips off her lower two sets of hands and passes them to you.<br />
<br />
“Where are you gonna put me? We’ve already got more arms then we know what to to with.”<br />
<br />
“You also have more than enough mouths Mona, so I’m gonna make sure we go neutral on this one.” You stick the first arm right over the mouth of head that spoke, the furthest right one. You quickly stuck the other three arms over the rest of the outer heads on this body.<br />
<br />
“Oh! This is interesting.” Mona flexes the four arms around, before bringing each pair of face-arms together to kiss. “Alright, next body!” Mona’s original body shoos that body away to experiment while the next in line, one of Erika’s torsos, approached.<br />
<br />
“I’ll take three of Mona’s heads and three cocks.”<br />
<br />
““““Hey, are we not enough succubus for you!?”””” The four Mona-cocks attached to the torso yelled with mock anger as Erika received her parts.<br />
<br />
“Nope, despite it not even being a day since you merged with me I couldn&#39;t imagine life without you Mona. That’s why I want even more of you as a part of me!” Erika put the three heads on her shoulders, two on either side of her two and one between them. The three cocks then went right where the mouths would have been. The now five-headed Torso turned her heads to suck on the outer Mona heads face-cocks while her two upper hands stroked the middle heads. <br />
<br />
“I couldn&#39;t imagine not being you cocks either Erika!” One of the four Mona-cocks spoke as the others were groping and fucking each other with their cock-tails. All forty three of this torso’s cocks came at once, bathing Teri in cum. Interestingly, the new torso that split off retained the additions, so Erika now had two five-headed torsos.<br />
<br />
As Erika slithered off to enjoy her spoils one of the Mary’s that Sarah had taken over stepped forwards.<br />
<br />
“Give me some of Teri’s heads, I want to experiment a little bit.” <br />
<br />
When the kitsune-scylla had one head in each of her eight arms she brushed her tails against them. The ears on each head moved up and became fox-ears while their face morphed into the one you and Sarah both shared.<br />
<br />
“Nice! That worked!” Sarah cheered as she attached two of the heads to the ends of tentacles and felt them attach just like Teri’s could. Teri was a mix of aroused and horrified at feeling eight of her heads converted like that, a fact Mona took issue with.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps a little warning before you do that miss!” jabbed the Succubus as she gripped Sarah with her real body. She pulled the foxy woman in close and wrapped her up in cock-tails. Mona fucked Sarah’s mouths and nipple-pussys as she rubbed all ten of her cocks against the Sarah’s body. When the two of them came an inky blackness flowed into Sarah as her body was invaded by Mona.<br />
<br />
All six of her remaining tentacles bulged and writhed as their tips grew into two of Mona’s upper bodies each. These bodies had all of Mona’s features, including the five cocks—one of which had Teri’s head on it—in each crotch. This transformation cascaded across every one of Sarah’s scylla bodies, each of them now equipped with twelve succubus torsos.<br />
<br />
“Holy hells! Just how many bodies does this girl have!?” Teri now suddenly had twelve more perspectives for each of the almost five-hundred bodies Mona had infected. The moment didn’t last long however as Sarah used her tails to convert Mona’s torsos into her own—nine tails growing from all twelve behinds. Each of Sarah’s scylla bodies now had two normal tentacles (other than the one body with extra heads on its two tentacles) on them this one having and six with a pair of bodies with three-heads, four normal cocks, one head tipped cock, six-arms, six breasts, three pussies, nine cock-tails, one spaded tail, and nine fox tails, as well as wings and horns.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Alright geez.” “I’ll make sure to ask before converting anyone going forwards.” “Just got so used to it today that I didn’t think before acting.” Sarah slipped off with her six remaining attachable heads, almost surly planning some sort of mischief with them.<br />
<br />
Next to step up to Teri was one of Susie’s drones, holding a basket in her hands.<br />
<br />
“The Queen requests fifteen cocks and eighteen breasts.”<br />
<br />
It takes a bit, but soon the basket in the drones arm are filled to the brim with Teri’s parts. It carried them over towards where Julie was waiting. The succubus now had ten sets of legs, the first eight of which were still birthing a trickle of drones periodically as she lay on the floor. Some of these newly birthed drones ran over and began pulling the breasts and cocks out of the basket before returning to their queen’s girlfriend.<br />
<br />
“Hey! I didn’t get in line for a reason!” The drones ignored Julie’s protests as they stuck her mother’s body parts all over her lower torsos. When they were done Julie’s ten crotches now had cocks in a 1-2-1 pattern going all the way back to her rearmost legs. These cocks were complimented with a pair of breasts just behind each set of legs other than her final pair, in the perfect spot for them to titfuck the cocks as she walked.<br />
<br />
“Oh goddess!” Julie moaned as she stood, her cocks slapping against her tits and she steadied herself. “Why did you do this? I’m covered in my mother’s cocks and tits now!”<br />
<br />
“The Queen desires to be taken by you as well.” explains one of Susie’s drones.<br />
<br />
“Yeah we thought it would be hot for you to have cocks as well!” adds the Charlie head-cock on one of your daughter’s three-headed drones, clearly not bothering with the ‘queen’ act that Susie’s are putting on.<br />
<br />
“If you wanna be fucked so bad then get over here!” Julie, still clearly angry, grabs one of Susie’s drones and forces it onto her frontal cock. The rest of the drones eagerly crawl underneath the succubus-taur’s body, lining themselves up so that she can fuck them by thrusting her hips. As she pounds the bug-girls she extends another section, the new lower torso retaining both the breasts as well as continuing the pattern of cocks by only having one in her new rearmost crotch.<br />
<br />
As all this has been happening, the body with the face-arms was masturbating. Mona discovered how goof it felt to suck on your cock with her hand-mouths and the two of you soon came alongside a few of your other bodies spread throughout the house. Just like with Erika, your ten new clones all retained the face-arms. This could get a little confusing over time, but the idea of having different ‘models’ of your body was tempting. You wonder if you should delve further down this path, or go do something else while everyone gets there pick of Teri’s bits.</p>
