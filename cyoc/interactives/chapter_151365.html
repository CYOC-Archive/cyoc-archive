<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pain beyond what he thought was possible ripped through his body. Unaware of anything beyond stepping through the door, let alone where in the manor they were, Sei dropped the instant he no longer felt himself moving, unable to stand any longer. His joints seizing as he curled into a fetal position, he felt like someone was taking a knife, edgy and dull, and digging furrows throughout his body. At the same time, it seemed like the same person was taking a ice-cold piece of glass and ripping that up through his skin, all while what felt like thousands of ants moved over him.<br />
<br />
As his skin rippled and he felt a sort of compressed sensation begin to push on his feet and the top of his head, Sei was dimly aware that something was wrong with his dick and nuts. But, unable to focus beyond the burning feeling, he was unaware as his male genitalia finished reforming itself into the exterior female genitals and the interior female reproductive system. Wishing he would either pass out or die or both, Sei tried to scream, but as he went from five foot nine down to four foot two, all he managed was to painfully expel a load of spit out through his nose. Dropping in weight from a hundred and thirty seven to about fifty nine pounds,  his overall appearance began to look less and less like that of a sixteen year old guy and more and more of a nine year old girl.<br />
<br />
Next to him, face scrunched up in worry, Jonathan fidgeted nervously with his hat as he squatted next to his friend. Dimly, he could see that something was happening, but what, he wasn&#39;t sure. Wanting to find a light, he found he was too scared to move away and thinking about trying to shake his friend and ask once again what was wrong, he didn&#39;t when he thought how it hadn&#39;t worked the last time. Reaching out, unsure what to do, Jonathan held his hand a couple inches over Sei, tempted to touch his shoulder in a comforting manner, but instead he stood and shucked off the heavy wool coat he was wearing.<br />
<br />
About to drop it on the floor, like he normally would, he instead looked about for a coat hook. Unable to see anything in the dim to nearly dark changing room, he huffed in agitation, stomped his foot petulantly and began to pat the walls. Accidentally finding a button, he pushed it, curious to know what would happen and immediately squeezed his eyes shut when a bright light flooded the room. Waiting a couple seconds, he tentatively opened his eyes a smidge, waited, then began to open them the rest of the way as he grew used to what he now could see was more of a soft, yellow light that emanated from a old-fashioned incandescent light bulb screwed into a fixture mounted to the wall to his right. Looking at Sei, seeing that his friend was still tightly curled up, and now shaking slightly, Jonathan furled his young brow, looked quickly about, located a coat hook and hanging his hat and coat up, he sat back down next to his friend. Trying to come up with an idea of what he could do to help, he nervously adjust himself so that he was sitting comfortably.<br />
<br />
In front of him, Sei was lost in a mixture of pain. Wanting only to pass out, but unable to, he was vaguely aware that whatever he&#39;d been injected with had run its course and was now burning its way out of his system. Scared  by what it might have done to him, he tried to focus on that that the sensation of what felt like a fish hook pulling his balls and cock up into his body had diminished, whilst the feeling of something spreading inside his groin and abdomen area had vanished, but found it difficult. Thinking that the sensation like a bunch of insects walking all over him had all but left, he wondered why, then painfully breathed a wad of spit out through his nose.<br />
<br />
Gradually, the discomfort began to lesson as the transformation his body was undergoing finished and the last of the concoction he&#39;d been given flushed itself from his system through his pores in microscopic amounts. When he felt his joints unlocking and he was finally able to relax, Sei continued to lie curled up in a fetal position, afraid that if he did move he would be forced to confront what had been done to him. Not ready for that, he instead wished that his friends were with him instead of a strange girl that somehow knew his name, then wished that they hadn&#39;t come to the manor. Thinking, &quot;This was all a mistake. We should have gone somewhere else, like Ryan&#39;s place, or Erick&#39;s house. Hell, even my place, and putting up with Sarah would have been better than here,&quot; and starting to despair, Sei found himself overwhelmed with a plethora of different emotions and wanting to cry.<br />
<br />
This, the need to cry, he knew he hadn&#39;t felt like doing since he had been really, really young. Thinking about a desire that, to him, seemed so girly, he wondered if it had anything to do with what had been done to him. Unsure, starting to ask himself why whatever had been done to him had been done and what he had done to deserve being injected with something and dressed in girl&#39;s clothes, Sei found himself spiraling downward deeper into a pit of blackness. Starting to cry, ashamed that he was doing so, he thought, &quot;It&#39;s not fair. I didn&#39;t do anything to be dressed like this or be stuck with whatever I had been given.&quot;<br />
<br />
Next to him, Jonathan, the instant he heard his friend start to cry, found himself in more shock than he was already in. It was already a jolt to find himself turned into a five-year-old girl, but it was even more alarming to realise that what he was seeing that was happening to Sei was that it appeared his friend was turning into a girl somehow. And then it was even more alarming when he heard his friend start to cry like a hurt little kid or a girl who was terribly upset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like how Sarah sometimes gets,&quot; he thought as he again reached out and was tempted to put a comforting hand on his friend&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Unsure if the way he felt was because he had been regressed back to childhood or if it was because he had been turned into a girl, Jonathan kept his hand a couple inches above his friend. Thinking, trying to recall how he had acted when he had been a five-year-old boy, but drawing a blank, he eventually gave into the sensation of wanting offer solace. Placing his hand gently on his friend&#39;s arm, Jonathan wondered if maybe he should say anything.<br />
<br />
Minutes slowly slipped by and Jonathan found he was still uncertain on what to say. Staring at his friend, unable to not see that Sei had transformed, as his friend&#39;s skin was more like Sarah&#39;s caramel hue and his hair was longer, past the shoulders, and more black than dark brown, Jonathan wondered if everyone who came to Spelstorm Manor was altered in some way. Thinking about his own transformation, he wondered how much he should tell, as there was parts he himself found hard to believe, such as that he had been stuck as a statue for around seven or eight years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which no one in their right mind would believe it if I told them,&quot; he muttered as he withdrew his hand and let it rest in his lap.<br />
<br />
Stuck on this one titbit of information, he suddenly found the idea of explaining to Sei all that had happened to him daunting and gazing at his friend, he also found it confusing, as when they were running through the garden, he would swear that Sei had looked almost exactly like the sixteen year old guy Jonathan had last seen him as when they first came to the manor. Head starting to hurt as he considered that, somehow, no time had passed for his friend, Jonathan sighed and once again whispered, &quot;No one in their right mind would believe it,&quot; then, as an after thought, mumbled, &quot;I myself find it hard to believe,&quot; before shifting about until he was lying down next to his friend, staring at the back of the robe Sei was wearing.<br />
<br />
Gently, as he lay next to his friend, Jonathan once again reached out and softly put a comforting hand on his friend&#39;s shoulder. As he did this, he thought for a moment, then whispered, &quot;Sei. I do not know if you want to hear this or if you&#39;ll believe this, but it&#39;s me, Jonathan. This place. It does stuff to people. It did it to me. It did it to you. Only, I do not understand it fully myself, but for me, it was years ago, whilst for you, I think it was shortly after we all came to the manor. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s confusing. But, please, trust me, when I say, it&#39;s me, Jonathan.&quot;<br />
<br />
In front of him, Sei, lost in his own despair, thought he heard a little girl talking to him somewhere close by. Her words not making a lot of sense, as she was claiming that she was Jonathan and that she had transformed years ago, Sei found himself thinking about what had been done to him. No longer doubting that he had been transformed, as he could feel it in the way the clothes he was wearing now sat loosely, comfortably, on him, how soft his skin felt when his hands brushed against any exposed parts, and the way the girl&#39;s panties he had on clearly pressed into what was unmistakably his private parts between his legs, he found it frightening and discouraging when he considered the possibility he was stuck the way he was. Hating what had been done to him, confused as to why, he thought back over all that had happened, decided he could lay here and feel sorry for himself or doing something about, then figured the first thing to do was to make himself stop crying, something he at first found difficult to do.<br />
<br />
When he had finally managed that, he struggled for a moment to regain some semblance of composure before slowly opening his eyes. The soft light that pierced his vision hurting his eyes at first, he blinked and waited for his sight to adjust before pushing himself up into a semi-sitting position. Hearing movement behind him, he glanced over his shoulder and seeing the little girl that at one time been a statue, he still found himself having trouble believing that she was who she claimed to be. Staring at her as she stared back, Sei found he didn&#39;t know what he should say, if anything, as he took in how she was dressed and found himself thinking her clothes were pretty. After a moment, he cleared his throat and fumbling for a couple seconds, he finally asked what he felt were the two most logic questions as he inquired, &quot;If you are Jonathan, can you prove it? And do you know how we can return to our former selves?&quot;</p>
