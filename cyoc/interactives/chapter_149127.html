<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kaiden wondered how he had ended up here. Standing in front of the Delta Iota Beta frat house at 29, one year away from completeing his masters in Business and Marketing.<br />
<br />
Rubbing the back of his neck he prepared to walk across the lawn and knock on the door, hesitant but without any other options. A series of chaotic events leading him to what he felt was his last resort. The strangest series of events that Kaiden didn&#39;t think he could have conceived of in his wildest imagination.<br />
<br />
Some idiot had been perving on people at a downtown park, so another idiot started shooting fireworks at the drone causing it to burst alight, and lose control. The out of control drone had gone flying off, small flaming pieces of it falling down into unsuspoecting peoples yard and onto their houses, before exploding and landing in the 3 foot high grass of an abandoned wooden house.<br />
<br />
In 15 minutes, an entire suburb was up in flames, and bad wind conditions meant that about 5% of the city&#39;s housing had been destroyed. For Kaiden, this meant his landlord had to kick him out to move into his apartment, and the avaialble accomodation was suddenly MUCH more expensive.<br />
<br />
As a part time sales manager, Kaiden couldn&#39;t afford the high rates, even looking at moving into a 5 bedroom house with 8 other people. <br />
His last resort had been talking to the university, and finding out he still qualified to join a fraternity, meaning affordable accomodation, if he could find one that would take him.<br />
<br />
Looking back over his shoulder at the frat house across the road he had just left. The Sigma Tau Alpha house, Kaiden begrudgingly knocked on the door, his mind replaying the last 24 hours, with every horrid detail crystal clear.<br />
<br />
The house leader Kyle had met with him, going over the house rules, what it meant to be an “Stud Alpha” and their expectations of him being involved in fraternity social gatherings and fundraisers. Then over lunch and drinks, which had turned into a night of partying and poker, the team had pressured Kaiden into joining one of their drinking games, waterfall, which after every once was very drunk, devolved into strip poker.<br />
<br />
Kaiden, while not exceptionally athletic, was able to keep a visible amount of definition in his chest and arms, and his stomach just barely showed the outline of a 6 pack, so he didn&#39;t feel too uncomfortable playing along, until he finally lost his underwear.<br />
<br />
Over the course of the game, it became very clear the “Stud Alpha&#39;s” were alll well endowed. However on losing his own underwear, and having to reveal his own average 6 inches, Kaiden had been ridiculed, and physically carried naked onto the front lawn, where he was uncermoniously dumped as the other frat guys threw his belonging at him from the windows. <br />
<br />
The final words he had to endure from Kyle, before a tear filled walk of shame back to his overpriced motel. “Your definitely not Alpha material, BOY. Ain&#39;t no Alpha who ain&#39;t packing AT LEAST 8 inches of hard fuck meat in their pants. You r&#39;e better off joining the little dicked Beta&#39;s across the road.”<br />
Kyles&#39; word stung horribly, the entire house laughing at him, but the final kicker had been Kyle crushing his glasses under his sneaker on the concrete as he sneered down at Kaiden. Laughing as Kaiden struggled to get dressed and find his way down the road without them.<br />
<br />
Kaiden had barely slept that night, feeling beyond humiliated. <br />
He was defeated. <br />
<br />
But the next morning, here he was, standing in front of the Beta&#39;s house. Checking the university accomodation website, the Alphas and Beta&#39;s were the only frat that had space to take new members. <br />
At least he had his backup glasses, modified yellow tinted blue-light blocking glasses that Kaiden used for his long stretches on the computer. They looked slightly silly but without them the world was a shifting blur, and he couldn&#39;t afford to replace them just yet.<br />
<br />
The door opened.<br />
<br />
Aman in his late 20&#39;s, with dark hair, a well trimmed short beard and the same defeated look in his eyes stood before Kaiden. It took barely a glance for the other man to assess him.<br />
“You been through the Alpha&#39;s hazing, mate?” <br />
Kaiden nodded, wide eyed and caught off guard by his Australian accent, rare to hear at an American university.<br />
<br />
“Come on in and grab a seat. You want a coffee?”<br />
Kaiden noded again as he was led to the lounge. Looking around, he noted the house was significantly cleaner and quieter then the Alpha&#39;s place. No overflowing ash trays, empty pizza boxes or beer cans, no home made bongs cluttering the place. <br />
The curtains are even open letting the place light up like a house.<br />
The first man returns bring two mugs with him, followed by a two other men.<br />
“one sugar alright?” He asks as he hands Kaiden the mug.<br />
<br />
The smaller framed guy with dirty blonde hair poking out of his cap shuts the curtains behind you and flicks on the light. You guess he would be around 18 or 19 years old.<br />
The third man, tall with large broad shoulder, dark brown red hair merging into a longer matching beard regards Kaiden silently as he sips his coffee. He looks like he&#39;s about 22.<br />
Its a long few minutes before anyone speaks.<br />
<br />
Its the blonde one.<br />
“He was the one from last night. I saw Kyle crush his glasses.”<br />
The red head nods silently, still staring at Kaiden, causing him to squirm slightly, feeling uncomfortable and fragile under such scrutiny.<br />
“Yeah, but what brings you to us today?” The dark haired one asks. His eyes probing yours Kaiden&#39;s for an answer.<br />
“Well I-.” Kaiden hesitates slightly before taking another sip of his coffee.<br />
“I need a place to stay while I finish my masters and the unioversity said I still qualified to join a frat, and only the Alphas and Betas have space to take new pledges, so I th-”<br />
“Are you here because of the website or because of what the Alpha&#39;s said last night.”<br />
The Red headed guy speaks up, his voice deep, forceful but quiet.<br />
“Um, well I-”<br />
“What did they say last night when the threw you on out on the street?” <br />
The Aussie asked in a gentler tone.<br />
Kaiden paused, sighing and staring down into his coffee before answering.<br />
<br />
“That I wasn&#39;t Alpha material, and that I was better off joing the- the Beta&#39;s across the road.”<br />
“No. Thats now exactly what they said. What. Did. They. Say?” The red head insists, despite strong glares from the other two.<br />
<br />
“They said, they said.” Kaiden fought back tears, his eyes stinging as they watered. He wanted to forget, but instead they were opening up a VERY fresh wound. “They said I was better off joining the little dicked Beta&#39;s across the road.”<br />
The red head sighed as he leaned back into his chair. <br />
“Sorry bud. Finish your coffee, hopefully you&#39;ll feel a bit better in a minute.<br />
<br />
As Kaiden silently, sipped the coffee, he noticed the red head heading off to the kitchen, reappearing with two fresh mugs, which he and the blonde one downed quickly.<br />
A few minutes later he knew why.<br />
<br />
Kaiden&#39;s 6” cock was suddenly painfully erect in his pants. Looking at the other three men uncomfortably, not sure what was about to happen. The dark haired one nods to the other two, the three men standing up as Kaiden&#39;s legs muscles tensed, preparing to bolt for the door if they tried anything. He couldn&#39;t take anymore humiliation.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the three men did something Kaiden wasn&#39;t expecting. They dropped their pants, revealing their hard cocks. Kaiden&#39;s eyes boggled as he took in the sight, the blond one and the dark haired one were only 3 inches when fully hard, the red head nearly making it to 4”.  They stood there staring at him, as he gently placed his coffee mug down.<br />
<br />
“Your turn, buddy?” The Aussie spoke again, as Kaiden realised what the coffee was for. Slowly he stood, shaking on his legs as he unbuckled his pants, letting his completely average 6 inch dick free from his pants, to the surprised gasps of the other three men.<br />
<br />
Kaiden squeezed his eyes shut. It was almost too much. Being thrown out of one fraternity for being too small, and now wondering if he was too big for this one.<br />
Hearing a sigh, he opened his eyes to see the Aussie pulling up his pants, followed by the others.<br />
“You definitely will have the biggest dick in this frat house. If we chose to let you stay.”<br />
“Please, I really need this. I can&#39;t afford anywhere else and I don&#39;t want to drop out with only a year to go. I&#39;ll do anything.” Kaiden rambled as the Aussie stared at him before slowly reaching out his hand.<br />
“Alright, but if you stay here, everyone at the university is just gonna assume you got a really small dick like the rest of us. The Alphas are gonna give you grief all the time, and nobody will want to come back to your place. Dating will be impossible for the next year, maybe longer if the reputation follows you. Knowing all that. Are you sure you want to join the Delta Iota Beta house?”<br />
<br />
It took Kaiden a short moment to consider everything before grabbing and shaking the outstretched hand, shaking it vigourously.<br />
“Well, as the house leader I formally welcome you to the fraternity. I&#39;m Jace, short for Jason, this little blondey here is Ryan, and this gruff bastard next to me is Paul.”<br />
Paul laughed loudly at that as he shook Kaiden&#39;s hand. <br />
“Ah, don&#39;t let the tough guy act fool ya, I just don&#39;t like other frats pledges coming here and giving us grief. Happens more often then you would think.”<br />
<br />
“Sweet man, lets get you settled, your room is on the third floor, right next to the best bathroom in the house. When are ya moving in?” Ryan asked as he led Kaiden upstairs. <br />
“Well, hopefully today if that works.” <br />
Kaiden&#39;s reply causing Ryan to spark a huge grin.</p>
