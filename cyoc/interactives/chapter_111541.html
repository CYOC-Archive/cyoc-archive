<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once again I had found myself curled into a ball and stuffed inside Jay’s sports bag. The dark insides of the bag shuffled along with me as Jay headed to class.<br />
<br />
I would’ve preferred that the geeky kid skipped class in order to search for a safe place to change me back, but I can understand the poor nerd choosing his grades over one of his classmates’ well-being. I wouldn’t have skipped Gym either.<br />
<br />
I couldn’t hear that well from inside Jay’s bag, but I picked up Mr. Morrison’s voice talking to his students. He was a teacher with greying hair, extremely thick glasses, you know, some old geezer. I think he teached Art although I wasn’t sure. I don’t go to such classes for pussies anyway but of course Jay did.<br />
<br />
I awaited inside Jay’s sports bag. It was boring and the drying stain of cum on my buttcheek itched a little bit but at least with the darkness I thought I could catch some shut-eye.<br />
<br />
No such luck, because not long after Jay opened the bag and I was blinded by the daylight.<br />
<br />
“Clay,” he said. “Umm...I left home with so much hurry I forgot the modeling clay for the sculpting class I have today...” The kid blushed with embarrassment. “...You don’t mind if I sculpt you, right?...I knew you’d accept.”<br />
<br />
Well, I have to admit I was greatly impressed by how well Jay had modeled me yesterday in his room. It’d be really embarrassing for him to model with what he knew was living and sentient clay in public but if he’s willing to sacrifice himself like that I couldn’t say no. Actually, I couldn’t have said no even if I wanted. I just hoped he wouldn’t use a chisel!<br />
<br />
Before taking me out of the bag, Jay squished and rubbed my surface with great force until all my facial and body features were inside me. When he took me out, I looked like just a big fleshy clay ball. Such mastery!<br />
<br />
When he put my spherical form on the table I realized I could see through my own flesh. It was very strange, on one hand it felt like my face was pressed against my own buttcocks but on the other I felt like the entire naked ball was me. I was just that, a pink sphere sitting bare on the table ready to be molded and sculpted.<br />
<br />
I looked at the other students’ pieces of clay. They were all grey and square. I really stood out among them and for some weird reason that made me feel like a very special and handsome piece of clay.<br />
<br />
I turned my 360-degree field of vision towards Mr. Morrison. I wondered what they were going to model, maybe I was about to become some Ancient Greek athlete...?<br />
<br />
“Considering this is your first time modeling with sculpting clay...” the old geezer began to say. Heh, Jay had plenty of experience with me. Surely I was gonna make him ace this test. “...We’ll start with something basic.” The old man placed on the blackboard a sheet of paper with an inanimate object drawn on it. “Like a flower vase. It doesn’t have to be exactly like this one of course. Let your creativity flow!”<br />
<br />
Uh? A flower vase? Isn’t that TOO basic of a form? I’d rather become something more elaborate...and manly.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless the other students were struggling with the modeling. “This is too complex...Mr. Morrison should have gone easier on us...”<br />
<br />
Jay studied the simple drawing of the flower pot and looked at me with fierce intensity. He must be elaborating an equation for the perfect flower vase. Damn, he’s intense when he wants to.<br />
<br />
First Jay took me from below and made my bottom flat, so I would be able to be placed on a table easily without rolling down like a soccer ball.<br />
<br />
My buttocks had never looked this flat. Thank goodness my anus wasn’t visible...I think.<br />
<br />
Now it was the tricky part. Jay put his hand inside me from the top of my fleshy form. I could feel his fingers going through all of my rolled-up vital organs. I wasn’t sure if Jay knew what it was, but just then he grabbed my most vital organ of all: my sausage.<br />
<br />
He pulled. Oh god, he pulled from it. I could felt my cock building up an erection and then my organ was exposed for everyone to see.<br />
<br />
My raging boner was protruding from the top of my spherical form. I already had been naked but feeling the cold breeze from the open windows on my exposed genitals made my pink body blush red.<br />
<br />
Of course, nobody in the classroom could tell I had my boner pointing straight to the ceiling. To them, I was just a ball with a flat bottom and a cylindrical, permanently erected tube on top.<br />
<br />
Jay took hold of my pecker once again and squashed the tip. My pee hole opened up when he did so, and thanks to my moldability it remained wide open like that.<br />
<br />
“Mr. Morrison, I’m done.” Said Jay proudly.<br />
<br />
“Let me see.” The teacher came closer to my embarrassing new form and wiped off the steam off from his thick glasses. I was sure he must be nearly blind. “Yes, you got the basic form right. In fact, it’s quite well-done. But isn’t the hole too small?” He said placing his finger on the tip of my dick. Oh shit, please, no, not this old fag touching my dick...!<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s supposed to only hold one flower, just like in the drawing.” Jay answered.<br />
<br />
“Ah, yes, I know that, but let me make a little test...”<br />
<br />
What happened next was so fucking humiliating that I’d die if anyone on my team learned that I was this freaking flower vase. The old fag took a red flower out of from his front-pocket, and then he...He...He sounded my peehole with it. Yeah, he pierced its long stem right inside my urethra. It was so fucking painful!<br />
<br />
“Ah, yes,” my sexual assailant said. “It can hold the flower just right.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Morrison and Jay both looked at me proudly. A perfect flower case with a red flower placed inside it. The old teacher thought I’d make quite the magnificent picture, so he took out a camera and did just that.<br />
<br />
“It’s certainly the best of the bunch,” said Mr. Morrison while looking with disgust at the disfigured grey vases the other students had made. “I’d be quite honored if you decided to expose it on the school’s art contest. It looks so avant-garde with those realistic sweat drops coming out from it when I placed the flower. It really feels alive.”<br />
<br />
“Err...Actually...” Jay stammered.<br />
<br />
“Ah, so you’d prefer to sell it yourself, don’t you? I won’t judge.”<br />
<br />
The bell rang and everyone got ready to leave for their next class. The old teacher said: “Remember to leave your pieces of... ‘art’ resting on those shelves. You’ll be able to retrieve them when the clay dries up.”</p>
