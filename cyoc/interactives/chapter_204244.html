<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walking in the hallway towards the cafeteria, you told Dominic that you will stop by the bathroom and that he does not have to wait for you. After Dominic waved good-bye for the time being, you headed for the nearest bathroom. You thought that this would be the best place to be while you continue to probe into this new situation. At least no one should bother your comatose body while you were away. When you entered the nearest bathroom, you were relieved to find it completely vacant, as most students were heading for lunch. Heading for the furthest stall, you locked the door, hung your backpack, and sat on the lowered toilet seat cover.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, this should be fine. Now how do I start this...?&quot;<br />
<br />
You first try to focus on choosing your target host. Before, you remembered that you let your mind wander as you most likely chose your target subconsciously. You also realized that you were in different hosts on each of your previous attempts, making you wonder about if you can possess previous hosts.<br />
<br />
You let your mind wander, similar to the last two instances. Inevitably, you began to revisit the conversation between Coach Lucas and Elizabeth. You pondered if Coach Lucas would serve as a good model for your adult life. He was strong and caring, and it&#39;s no wonder many people in the school liked him from the start. Then Again......<br />
<br />
Focusing on your dad, you reminded yourself on dad&#39;s bulky features, as well as his hairy arms and long member. You had always seen your dad as a role model, despite numerous differences between you two. Your dad worked as a software engineer, your dream career, and even though he worked long hours, he still saved quality time for you and your mom. Apparently, he had also shown his capability as an adult responsible for his family, such as his handiness around the house or planning financial backups (although your mom also helped with the latter since she was more familiar in business and finances). As your mom would say to you from time to time, those were your dad&#39;s signature qualities of being an adult. However, you were legally an adult just by turning 18, so does replicating those same actions make you an adult? Some would take years to complete, and you had hoped that your maturing body alone would put you into this higher status. You guess that this power could allow you to experience non-physical qualities sooner. As embarrassed as you were, you had to admit that you had been focusing too much on the sensual qualities, and that you should try adopting more responsibilities, even being someone other than your dad, as long as time permits.<br />
<br />
Pondering this much, you were surprised you did not feel the same haziness you were expecting or that you should be in dad&#39;s office or something. You quickly assumed that perhaps distance was a limitation, as your dad worked far away from the school. (Now that you thought about it, that might also be a reason why you stayed in your dad&#39;s body for only several minutes.) Disappointed that your top choice was gone, you shifted your focus to your other two previous hosts. Coach Lucas would be the most appealing choice after your dad, sharing the same hulky appearance while having the same tender demeanor. You don&#39;t know much else about Coach Lucas, but owning those qualities should be a good indicator, right?<br />
<br />
Before you can try to even attempt to find a way back to Coach Lucas, you hear a loud set of voices enter the bathroom. As you wait for the group to leave you begin to see small wisps of smoke seep into your stall. Yep. Looks like these boys were skipping lunch to smoke. Although you hadn&#39;t been the most attentive student today, you definitely weren&#39;t a bad student and being caught by an administrator with these smokers in the bathroom was something you definitely didn&#39;t want to deal with. Annoyed at having to leave before you could attempt again, you flush the toilet and leave the bathroom without washing your hands. While it was a bit disgusting, the smokers were all huddled near the sinks and you didn&#39;t want to deal with these delinquents who were all bigger than you unsurprisingly.<br />
<br />
Washing your hands in another bathroom, you make your way to the cafeteria where Dom is waiting for you at a booth with your other friend, Jake. Sitting next to Dom, you begin Eating a few tater tots off his tray. You decide against getting lunch due to your excessive interest in your &#39;power&#39; and that eating would probably just make you nauseous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro. You okay? You&#39;ve been out of it all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look up at Dom to see a worried expression on his face. While you didn&#39;t want to lie to him, you couldn&#39;t exactly tell him the truth. Or not just yet anyway. You did trust Dom, your best friend since third grade, but now just wasn&#39;t the time. Especially since Jake was here. You met Jake back in Freshman year in Gym Class and became friends with him rather quickly. Although he was a good friend, Jake just didn&#39;t have the same trust factor Dom had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you should just go home Mark,&quot; Jake says eyeing you across the table before taking a big bite out of his sandwich.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah. I&#39;m just a bit tired. Besides there&#39;s only three weeks left of school, I don&#39;t want to miss any classes before graduation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dom takes a swig of water before speaking. &quot;Hey, my Dad has to take me to the dentist today. You can catch a ride with me home during study hall.&quot;<br />
<br />
You accept his offer, after all any excuse to get home earlier and not deal with the annoying underclassmen on the bus would be foolish to refuse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you guys just drive to school?&quot; Jake asks us, his sandwich completely gone with only a heapful of crumbs on the tray.<br />
<br />
&quot;My family can&#39;t afford another car and Mark didn&#39;t want me to ride alone. Besides Mark and I live super far from school, imagine how much gas would be?&quot; Dom said his tray now empty as well.<br />
<br />
The three of you continue chatting about the Senior Takeover next week as you continue thinking to yourself about your experience. Eventually the day does come to a close, even if it takes forever for you. You and Dom skip Study Hall and head out where Dom&#39;s Dad awaits in his truck. Similar to his son, Tom Seward was a tall black male with a well-built physique. However, that&#39;s where the comparisons ended, Tom wore thick black glasses and had a completely bald head contrasting his trimmed beard. Although you had to admit he still had that alluring mature adult vibe along with being pretty handsome. Mr. Seward takes you to your house while you make some light conversation on your school day.<br />
<br />
Eventually you pull up to the outside of your house. &quot;Thank for the ride Mr. Seward,&quot; you tell him as you climb out of the backseat.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem Mark. Tell your folks I said hello,&quot; Mr. Seward says before he waves goodbye with Dom.<br />
<br />
Your parents both work late into the night, so you don&#39;t expect anyone home for a while. Making yourself dinner, you shower, and do the small amount of homework you have before you focus on your &#39;power&#39;. Laying on your bed you close your eyes as you begin to go through the days events. Starting with you Dad and making your way to Coach Lucas, you&#39;re lost in thought as you hear the door downstairs open before your Dad announces his usual &quot;Mark. I&#39;m home! Hope you&#39;ve finished your homework.&quot; in his deep voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gosh how embarrassing,&quot; you think, &quot;Just like this morning your Dad keeps treating you like a kid by always lecturing you and expecting you not to have any autonomy in taking care of your responsibilities. How am I supposed to get used to being treated like an adult when you won&#39;t? You kinda wish he was more like Mr. Seward, relaxed and trustful. Drifting off you slowly begin to wander.</p>
