<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as they exited the room with the tanks, the steel door slid shut behind them.  Lee looked at Charlie and smiled.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess he really wants us gone!&quot; said Lee.<br />
<br />
&quot;That old man really creeped me out. If you hadn't been such a decent guy...&quot;  said Charlie.<br />
<br />
The steel door at the end of the basement hallway slammed shut.  There was a moment of darkness in which the men heard loud clunking noises and the corridor shook around them.<br />
<br />
The lights stayed out but the door behind them opened again.  There was a pale light coming from the door.  It became brighter and brighter.<br />
<br />
Charlie was really scared.  &quot;I'm sorry! Okay?  I'm sorry!&quot;  he shouted.<br />
<br />
Lee shook his head.  &quot;I think this was planned already.  He was just looking for an excuse to keep us here. I think we must have upset his experiment results.  I guess he thought we'd keep going down that path.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm ashamed to admit that I probably would have... &quot; said Charlie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well you didn't.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Only because you stopped me.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a sudden screeching sound behind them and the giant steel wall that was formerly the exit moved down the corridor,  crowding them towards the tank room again.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, whatever happens, let's just stick together this time, okay?&quot;  said Lee.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely,&quot; said Charlie, terrified at what might await them.<br />
<br />
When they stepped into the now brightly lit room the steel door slammed behind them.  <br />
<br />
They looked around, and everything looked the same, except now there were three fish tanks, blue, purple, and orange in the red and the green tanks.  There were two penalty black fish tanks in the red tank, offsetting blue and purple on scales in the red tank, and an orange fish tank on scales in the green tank.  tubes flowed from the tanks in a tangled mess that was hard to follow and there were three dials on the wall and the same two black buttons on the ceiling.  <br />
<br />
Lee and Charlie gasped.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You think you are friends now?&quot;  said the voice of old man Morris.  &quot;Charlie, didn't you notice that Lee is twice your size?  He did to you what you were going to do to him, but he tricked you into thinking you were lucky for it.  If he'd really been your friend, he would have shared the liquid until you were both the same size.  <br />
<br />
Charlie said, &quot;Hey, that's right!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lee flushed with embarrassment and humiliation.  He'd not even realized that he'd done to Charlie exactly what Charlie wanted to do to him. He was no better than Charlie, and now Charlie knew it.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not playing your game again!&quot; Lee shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you are...!  or you're never leaving.&quot; said the voice from the ceiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;But how does this one work?&quot; asked Charlie.<br />
<br />
&quot;The blue, purple and orange tanks each control one aspect of your physicality.  Blue is for height, Purple is for muscle... and orange... well, you figure it out!- and Lee.... !  Charlie has to set the dials on the wall on this round. It's his decision.  But know that you will go seven rounds just like the first test.  So pick well, Charlie!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; said Charlie.  &quot;This is too complicated!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll help you figure it out,&quot; said Lee. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like I'd believe anything you would say!&quot; said Charlie.<br />
<br />
Lee looked down at his massive muscles, his pendulous cock, his towering height so far above the floor... and realized that he might lose all of that... and more. <br />
<br />
Lee ran at the glass as hard as he could. This time, he bounced off like it was made of rubber.  He tried once more.  Charlie smirked.  &quot;I guess you're not going to muscle your way out of this one!&quot; said Charlie.  He was already steadying the tubes and the tanks and the dials.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said Charlie.  &quot;We know 33% would have kept us the same size last time... but wait, the penalty tank... seven rounds...hmmm...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; said Lee.  &quot;If you put the dials in the middle... at first it would be even for the purple muscle tank, and then the penalty tank would... hmm...&quot;  Even he was becoming confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's see, the Orange...umm... cock tank... if you set it to 1/3 it would be even on the first round  but over seven rounds you'd lose a lot!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the purple muscle tank... it's the  same.  The blue height tank looks reversed... you have the black penalty tank in the red tank.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what is the answer?&quot; Charlie puzzled.  &quot;If I give you anything you'll end up bigger but if I don't give you something I'll be too big to live a normal life!  25% was way too much on seven rounds. 5%... what would that do?&quot; On the last round you'd get... what?  35% of what I got?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lee groaned.  Charlie was not smart enough to realize that the effects multiplied across the rounds... so he'd end up with way too much with that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hard to say, Charlie.  I don't think we can trust Professor Morris. I think he's mad at us.  Anything we do could backfire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I'm mad at you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry.  I'm a little bit sorry.  I could have been a bit more generous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit more?  You're 6'5&quot; and 320 lbs of muscle!  Your cock is 11 and 1/4 &quot; and as you keep remarking you are twice the man I am!  I'm 6'1&quot; tall and 230 lbs!  As you keep telling me.  Over and over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you used to tell me!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, maybe I deserved that but if you had shared equally... ummm... you could have made us both 6'3&quot; tall and 275 lbs or so-  with 10&quot; or longer cocks!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and maybe you'd still try to push me around if that were the case.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot;<br />
<br />
And Charlie, mad as he was, set the dials and pushed the button.  He glared at me.  &quot;We'll never get out of here if you don't push the button!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Reluctantly, I pushed my button.  Then Charlie stepped aside as the contraption started to hum.    <br />
<br />
Phase 1<br />
<br />
&quot;Begin Phase one&quot; intoned the machine voice.    I heard a gurgling sound and then I saw amber liquid running down the tube and splitting off into three separate tubes, each one for one of the colored fish tanks.  Then each passed through a second valve, splitting the fluids from Charlie's fish tanks to the black penalty tanks.  The fluid tubes were a tangle.  Charlie started to groan as the fluid entered the red tank enclosure.  I watched as the orange tank began to fill up more quickly than the purple or blue tanks.  But the black penalty tanks were all different values too!  Something was wrong.  Just then the Professor's voice rang over the speaker. &quot;I've decided to enter a random factor... each time the amount of fluid entering the tube is different, and each time the ratio changes randomly- so only your first setting applies for the first time.  It will be interesting to see how you respond to random changes!<br />
<br />
Charlie began to grow.  He sprouted taller, growing a few inches.  His muscles expanded, swelling with new power, volume and mass.  But the most radical change was due to the fluid spilling into his orange tank.  His junk sprang erect, a full 9 inches with big balls swinging in his scrotum, but in just moments it was 10&quot; long, and then even approaching 11&quot; in length, and then past that and swelling to 12&quot;.   His balls swelled up past mango sized and he groaned and massaged them in his quickly expanding scrotum.  Charlie gasped in amazement.  He looked at Lee and laughed.<br />
<br />
Just then the pumps started up, and the fluid began to drain from Charlie's orange, blue, and purple tanks into Lee's.  What Lee realized watching was that a lot of fluid had pumped into the black tank offsetting his orange tank, even more than Charlie had been given, and the same for the purple tank.   The blue tank that controlled height was a more reasonable looking tradeoff. <br />
<br />
Lee groaned as the fluid pumped steadily into his fish tanks.   His cock and balls swelled prodigiously,  and his muscles likewise swelled with even more power.  Soon Lee was sporting a 13&quot; cock and Charlie was down again past nine inches... until he was left with barely an 8&quot; cock.  At the same time Charlie's muscles deflated and his height shrank an inch as Lee sprouted upwards that same inch.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is going crazy, Charlie!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;You ended up with more than me again!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Morris is screwing with us!'<br />
<br />
&quot;Screw you, Lee!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lee stepped up to Charlie menacingly.  &quot;What did you say, little man?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Charlie gulped, staring straight across at Lee, but with much less muscle mass, or cock.  That shouldn't matter in a display of power, but Charlie was intimidated. After all, he'd intimidated Lee many times with his formerly hung cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said, screw you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lee shoved his arm, flexed bicep under Charlie's nose.  &quot;Want the rephrase that, friend?&quot;  Lee shoved Charlie, who flew across the room. <br />
<br />
Just then the tanks emptied into the lower catch basins. <br />
<br />
&quot;Phase one complete.  Beginning Phase two!&quot;<br />
<br />
Phase 2<br />
<br />
Charlie was angry now.  <br />
<br />
He didn't know what was going to happen this round, but he knew that he was going to get whatever it was first, no matter what was taken away, he might have an advantage over Lee for a minute or two.<br />
<br />
The pumps started and amber liquid flowed down into the valves and then into the secondary valves and then into Charlie's tanks.  The purple tank had barely a dribble coming into it, but the orange tank once again was filling quickly.  The blue tank filled up more slowly but faster than the purple tank.  Charlie clenched his fists in frustration.  His body was growing in height, but just a little bit in muscle.  His junk was rapidly expanding, bigger than even previously, and then it was over 12&quot; in length with a proportional circumference.  The weight of his massive erection pulled his penis lower than before so it stuck out almost at right angles to his body.  <br />
<br />
He was taller than Lee, now, Lee was 6'6&quot; tall but Charlie was 6'8&quot; tall, although the stretch slimmed his muscle size somewhat even with the modest addition to his muscle mass.   He stared down at Lee.  &quot;Just you wait, Lee.  The worm will turn! You'll see!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe I ever felt sorry for you Charlie.  You'll always be a jerk.  I should have kept all my size and just left you here!&quot;<br />
<br />
This time, the pump started humming and because of the sizable amount of fluid in the orange penalty tank, Lee's member surge forward in growth.  Not too much more fluid had been added this time to the penalty tank but still Lee's cock grew to monster sized, over 14 1/2&quot;.  At the same time his muscle swelled again, adding another 35 lbs or so of stolen muscle from Charlie.  Charlie was now still muscled, more now like an over-muscled volleyball player than a bodybuilder at this point.    Charlie's cock shrank down again, but this time stayed just at 9&quot; again.  Charlie was at least happier with that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't wait to get some muscle!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why wait, Charlie?&quot; and Lee tackled Charlie and pressed him down to the cement floor of the lab.  <br />
<br />
Charlie gasped under the weight of Lee's body, now about 360 lbs compared to his 250 lbs or so.   He was also uncomfortably aware of Lee's monster cock laying ponderously across his own erect cock and up his pecs. <br />
<br />
There was the sound of the fluid dumping in the red and green holding tanks, and then, &quot;Phase two complete.  Beginning Phase three&quot;<br />
<br />
Phase 3<br />
<br />
Charlie began to struggle as the pumps activated. He couldn't see what was going on, as Lee could, but Lee gasped.  Fluid was gushing into the purple and blue tanks at a ferocious rate.  Only a trickle entered the orange fish tank.  <br />
<br />
Charlie felt new power and muscle size surging into his limbs, and his bones crackled with new growth as he shot up in height.  Or he would have shot upward, if Lee hadn't been pinning him down.  <br />
<br />
After just a minute of struggling Charlie felt so much new muscle power he was able to throw Lee off of him.  He staggered to his feet. He was 6'10&quot; tall, but he was now over 370 lbs of muscle!  <br />
<br />
The men faced each other, gasping and sweaty.  Charlie couldn't ignore Lee's giant member waving in front of him.  &quot;I guess that's not all that makes a man, is it?&quot; <br />
<br />
And then the pumps switched and Lee groaned as 35 lbs of Charlie's muscle began to transfer to his body, and he crept taller another full inch, until he was 6'7&quot; tall.  Most distracting was again the volume of size inflating his genitals.  Because he was so monster huge now, as Charlie lost about 3 inches in length and proportional diameter,  Lee's monster cock swell almost to 15&quot; long and another 1/2 &quot; in width.  Now Lee was truly hung thick as a soda can.  His testicles were wicked huge and stretched his scrotum to the limit.   <br />
<br />
Charlie was now more muscled than before, but with only 6 1/2&quot; in length on his penis.  It looked ridiculous on his super tall body.  Angered, he charged Lee.  Lee answered with a roar, and the two punched and grappled with each other, drawing blood for the first time as Lee received a cut over his eyebrow, and Charlie abraded his knees on the cement floor.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Splash!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Phase 3 complete.  Beginning Phase 4&quot;<br />
<br />
Phase 4<br />
<br />
&quot;Red and green tank assignments reversed.&quot;  Charlie and Lee were stunned enough to look. Sure enough, their fluid levels in the tanks reversed to match their sizes.  But the black penalty tanks remained the same, and didn't change fluid.  <br />
<br />
Quantities of fluid began splashing into the tanks and Lee began to grow first this time.  Again, there was a large volume flooding the orange fish tank.</p>
