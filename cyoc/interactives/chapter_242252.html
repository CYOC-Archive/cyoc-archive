<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miles sighed, the jeep pulling into a state park on the edge of the Connecticut/Rhode Island border. With Caleb still hurt and Connor recuperating from his encounter with the Amberhills, the Hispanic hunter now found himself in unfamiliar territory. Acting as head of the Moreland clan.<br />
<br />
This position was temporary and essentially a field promotion. In regards to the church, Connor or Caleb would be dealing with them. Miles though was needed to investigate activities that neither Moreland brother could in their current health.<br />
<br />
A community of Dogmen was rumored to be in this area. Dogmen, like werewolves, operated in packs, usually avoiding human contact. When they did though, those interactions were never pleasant and often needed hunter intervention. That&#39;s where Miles came in after a Dogman attacked a family that was camping in this state park.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how bad was the attack?&quot; Charlotte asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing too serious,&quot; Miles replied. &quot;The father had some cuts and bruises. The wife and kids were frightened, ranting to authorities about a bear or even a werewolf as the kids insisted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Authorities chalked it up to the former, thinking the family may have stumbled into a black bears territory. The church though was aware of the Dogmens community, asking Miles to investigate. However, considering that Connor, Caleb, and Spark were unavailable, Miles had to resort to.....other options.<br />
<br />
Turning to Chase and Aaron, he watched the young hunters exit the other jeep, their girlfriends Andromeda and Nyx in tow. Miles frowned, glancing at the two dhamphir princesses before watching Aaron&#39;s sister Haley and her boyfriend Ikuro exit his jeep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two dhamphirs, a pair of kintaros, and a kitsune,&quot; he sighed. &quot;Never thought I&#39;d see this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you have a problem with dhamphirs and a kitsune Miles,&quot; Charlotte grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not,&quot; Miles exclaimed. &quot;But this isn&#39;t date night. I mean look at them. The girls are hanging all over Aaron and Chase. Do you think they&#39;ve ever been in the wilderness? And then we got Haley.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Haley?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you two are close Charlotte,&quot; Miles said. &quot;But the girl&#39;s got the attention span of a golden retriever. I&#39;m expecting her to get distracted by a squirrel or something while we&#39;re out there. I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re not dating anyone, I already feel like I&#39;m chaperoning a college mixer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First off they&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Charlotte stated firmly. &quot;Second off, I&#39;ve been dating someone myself thank you very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Who?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice guy named Clay,&quot; Charlotte replied. &quot;You&#39;d like him. He races. Might even end up with sponsorship this year and compete on the circuit.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Charlotte sighed dreamily, Miles could only groaned in annoyance. The last thing he wanted if he had to deal with a group of angry Dogmen, was a bunch of love sick twenty somethings more focused on their significant others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me estoy poniendo demagiado viego para esto,&quot; Miles sighed.<br />
<br />
Taking a breath, Miles now rechecked his their inventory before calling the group to him. &quot;Okay listen up,&quot; he called, his eyes narrowing. &quot;Got a report about a community of Dogmen attacking humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would they do that?&quot; Andromeda asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t Dogmen usually docile unless threatened?&quot; Nyx added.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was getting to that,&quot; Miles answered tersly. &quot;Or did you want to do this briefing your highness?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude not cool,&quot; Chase said angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, no need to snap at them Miles,&quot; Aaron added. &quot;They didn&#39;t do anything wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, but you two certainly screwed the pooch,&quot; Miles growled. &quot;Thinking with the wrong head and leaving us in the mess we&#39;re in!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase and Aaron looked struck, Miles venomous comments cutting the young hunters emotionally. Seeing this, Miles sighed. He was letting his own insecurities get in the way of the job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; he said sadly. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have said that. It&#39;s just....I&#39;ve never been in charge of anything before. Now Caleb and Connor are trusting me to uphold the family name. I&#39;m taking my frustrations out on you for no reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miles now turned to Andromeda and Nyx, the looks on dhamphir princesses faces telling Miles he had screwed up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry you two,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ve held onto a lot of anger for years based on what happened to my best friend. It&#39;s not your fault. Hell, you two probably helped these two grow into better people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I thank you Miles,&quot; Andromeda said softly. &quot;Things have certainly changed in a small period of time. I understand how some may hold a grudge, but I appreciate you willing to give us a chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Miles grinned. &quot;Now as Andromeda and Nyx pointed out, Dogmen are usually passive unless threatened. That&#39;s why this mission isn&#39;t a hunt, it&#39;s an intel gathering.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group nodded, all eyes focused on Miles as he paced nervously. &quot;Charlotte is taking Connor&#39;s spot for this mission,&quot; he said. &quot;Acting as our coordinator.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How come Charlotte is acting as coordinator,&quot; Chase protested. &quot;I can do the job just as good as she can and besides, I&#39;m older than her by twenty minutes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Charlotte doesn&#39;t screw around on jobs Chase,&quot; Miles said. &quot;Not for nothing but you got a tendency to act first, not think first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry brother looks I get to boss you around on this job,&quot; Charlotte smirked.<br />
<br />
As the twins now began to argue, Miles could only pinch his nose in annoyance. So far being in charge was proving to be a giant pain in the ass. He felt out of his element, he was the one to crack a joke and keep morale up when Caleb was too harsh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we focus please?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The group stopped arguing, noting the stress on the Hispanic man&#39;s face. &quot;Look I&#39;m not Caleb,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m not Connor either. If they were here I&#39;m sure they&#39;d have some inspirational or authoritative speech ready to get everyone working as one. I&#39;m not that guy. I&#39;m the guy who cracks a joke and eases the tension when the rest of you feel Caleb is being unfair. Right now though, this is all we got. I need ALL of you to help me out on this. We need to find out what&#39;s going on and we need to be careful okay. I...I can&#39;t have anyone else getting hurt, especially if it&#39;s on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand Miles Desoto,&quot; Ikuro said softly. &quot;You have been thrust into a position you think yourself unworthy of. I can identify with that far better than you might think. We will follow your lead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Ikuro,&quot; Miles said, offering the steel grey kitsune a small smile. &quot;Anyway like I was saying, the Dogmen are about two miles into the forest. We tread carefully and we keep a look out for territorial markers. We run into trouble, we back off. That clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
The group nodded, the arguing finally stopping much to Miles relief. Asking if anyone now had a question, Miles raised an eyebrow as Haley raised her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Haley?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you thought about wearing the hat,&quot; Haley asked, the jade tigress tail swishing back and forth. &quot;I mean if you&#39;re the boss now shouldn&#39;t you be wearing the cowboy hat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Made de Dios,&quot; Miles sighed.<br />
<br />
After a less than stellar start, in Miles&#39;s opinion, he was pleasantly surprised to find the young group under his care fall in line. With Aaron, Chase, Charlotte, and even Haley it was expected. The quartet were seasoned pros at this point, knowing that in the field, it was all business. What surprised him though were Andromeda, Nyx, and Ikuro.<br />
<br />
The dhamphir sisters were trained well, nearly surpassing Miles&#39;s own skill. The pair now brought up the rear with Aaron and Chase, quietly making their way through the woods as they checked for territorial markers.<br />
<br />
Ikuro though was a pleasant surprise. The militaristic kitsune moved in a manner that made Miles think of Special Forces. Quietly the three tailed kitsune led with Charlotte, the two scouts silent as the grave, moving as one. Occasionally the pair would pause, taking a moment to listen before motioning the group to continue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you Ikuro was good,&quot; Haley whispered, a broad smile on the jade kintaro&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah you&#39;re right stop rubbing it in,&quot; Miles replied. &quot;He&#39;s good, but can you sense it? Something feels off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Haley paused, the tigress lifting her head as she strained to listen. &quot;It&#39;s quiet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Way too quiet,&quot; Miles replied, his grip tightening on his sawed off shotgun. Turning back, he motioned for Chase and Aaron to close the distance and be ready. The kintaro and hunter nodded, Chase taking the moment to put his brass knuckles on.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you thinking Miles?&quot; Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know,&quot; Miles replied, scanning the thick forest. &quot;According to the map, we&#39;re about a mile from the Dogmen camp. We should have seen some sort of markers by now. There&#39;s nothing, like something scrubbed the area clean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure we&#39;re going the right way?&quot; Nyx asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Charlotte and I have the map memorized,&quot; Miles replied. &quot;This is the path. I recognize the stream.&quot; Miles pointed to the small stream gently flowing through the forest, remembering it served as a water source for the Dogmen. Usually by this point, he would notice a marker. A sign that they were in Dogmen territory. The markers were subtle, hunters and Dogmen usually being the only ones that would recognize them. In this case though, the forest lay in a eerily, pristine condition.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I have an idea,&quot; Chase said, drawing Miles&#39;s attention. &quot;Andromeda is great when it comes to understanding wildlife. Maybe we ask them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Asking wildlife,&quot; Miles asked. &quot;Chase what are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase smirked, winking at Miles as he motioned to Andromeda. &quot;Go on Andromeda. Do your thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miles still confused, watched as Andromeda now sang a few, low, melodic notes. The Hispanic man, furiously gazing at Chase. &quot;Are you fucking kidding me,&quot; he hissed. &quot;What kind of fairy tale shit are you trying to pull Chase?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whenever Andromeda sings the animals listen and come to her,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe we can get some information from them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miles wanted to argue, to say that was the most ridiculous thing he ever heard. Instead, he paused as a single doe emerged from the under brush, staring at the group. &quot;Holy shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andromeda smiled, motioning for the deer to come closer. Instead the deer turned and sprinted in the opposite direction. Andromeda now stood, her pale face growing even paler. &quot;She&#39;s scared,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Scared of something over there.&quot; Andromeda now pointed in the direction that the group was traveling. The direction that the Dogmen resided in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are the wildlife frightened of these Dogmen?&quot; Ikuro asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Charlotte replied, her brow furrowing as she flipped the safety of her rifle. &quot;No wildlife usually don&#39;t have issues with Dogmen. Something else got them spooked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miles nodded, agreeing with Charlotte&#39;s assessment as he stared at the group. &quot;Chase, Aaron,&quot; he said. &quot;Stay close to your girlfriends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know we can take care of ourselves,&quot; Nyx replied defiantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Miles replied. &quot;But whatever is out here is more serious than I thought and I&#39;m not trying to piss off the Tepes family. You two ever fired a gun?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nyx and Andromeda shook their heads no, Miles now approaching and handing the pair handguns before flicking of the safety. &quot;Line up the sights and pull the trigger,&quot; he said. &quot;But only as a last resort. Things go bad. Turn and run.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nyx and Andromeda nodded, gripping the pistols tightly as the group crept forward once more. They were close now, he could feel it. The silence of the woods all consuming and suffocating. No birds, no insects, no animal sounds period. Something was very wrong and the group was growing closer to the source.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like an eternity, the group noticed the woods begin to clear. There was an opening up ahead, indicating a clearing. Miles now moved forward, standing next to Ikuro as the kitsune slowly unsheathed his katana. As they breached the woods they paused, Andromeda gasping in disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Que carajo,&quot; Miles whispered.<br />
<br />
Laid out before the group was what remained of the community of Dogmen. Close to 80 bodies sat rotting on the forest, their bodies butchered like cattle. Blood soaked the forest floors, massive heads mounted on pikes. Taking a step forward, Miles caught a glimpse of a single, seven foot tall Dogman. The creature long dead, nailed to a cross with a single word carved into its chest:<br />
<br />
Seraphim</p>
