<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Say&quot;, Jake asked the clerk, his voice trembling, but only slightly. &quot;Is there a way to become like you two? I can't see another pink tie on the aisle, but...&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;, the clerk incredulously exclaimed. &quot;Are you deaf? I told you becoming one of the shopkeepers is permanent, remember?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jake nodded. &quot;I know. But I also know I can't let my bro here. I would never forgive myself for that&quot;, and he smiled at Derek, waiting for his reaction.<br />
<br />
The brand new clerk's eyes glistened with tears, and he hold the skater in a tight, tender embrace. &quot;I'm sorry, Jake... I let my body take control and didn't thought about your feelings at all... And yet you still want to be with me...&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jake could feel the rock-hard dick of his friend pressing against his crotch, and that was what really convinced him he was doing the right thing. &quot;Bros for life, remember?&quot;, he whispered before his tongue slithered through Derek's hot lips, working his magic. Derek's new scent was equally as intoxicating as the one from the Etnies: it was deep, musky and refreshing, the smell of a man in the prime of his life. &quot;Oh, God, I can't wait to give a good sniff to his feet&quot;, Jake thought, a little dazed. The transformative effect of the skater shoes had still to be in Derek's body, at least partly; and if shoes had made them equal once...<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, take your shoes off&quot;, Jake ordered, in a hurried tone of voice. &quot;I want... no, I HAVE to wear them&quot;, and while talking, he quickly discarded the smelly Etnies, leaving them on the shop's floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh? Oh, sure thing, bro!&quot;, and in a couple of seconds, the elegant pair of black shoes was handed to him, and he eagerly slid them over his feet. They still were a size 12, like the Etnies, and fitted him like a glove. Jake could already feel the power radiating from them, filling his body in preparation for the change. He could also feel Derek's lips brushing against the back of his neck, and his warm breath on his skin. &quot;You didn't have to do this for me, dude... We literally met half an hour ago!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jake looked down: his shorts have already started to become pin-striped. He could probably stop the changes by discarding the shoes, at least as long as he didn't get the pink tie, but decided against it: he wanted to go through the whole change now. &quot;I know... But the bond we share is something I don't have with anyone else in this world. I... I want to be with you. Forever&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you so much, Jake...&quot;, Derek muttered, before moaning wildly: the arousal was too much for him, and his dick has just loaded a creamy portion of cum in his boxers.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the store clerk was looking at the two of them with a satisfied grin on his face. He had unzipped his pants, and was now stroking his erect shaft, the other hand tenderly caressing his necktie; he honestly couldn't remember the last time he had been so happy: not only a customer had been transformed in a hot, sexy clerk by the shop's will, but another handsome young man was going through the same changes in front of his very eyes, and what's more he was doing that of his own free will! Shirt, vest and jacket came into existence around the now former skater's massive chest, hugging his powerful, masculine body comfortably, and this sent the clerk over the edge: he sprayed Jake, who was in front of him, with his powerful spunk, that landed directly onto his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, shit, dude, what the...&quot;, Jake started, before noticing something strange: the cum wasn't white, but rather hot pink! The fluid wriggled like a liquid snake, before encircling Jake's neck, becoming bigger and finally solidifying in a silky tie.<br />
<br />
The changes were almost over, now: the only thing left untouched was Jake's face, and just a couple of seconds later his chin became squarer and his jaw line more chiseled, turning him into the epitome of masculinity. He also got a sexy tan, his bronzed skin complimenting perfectly his chilling eyes and light blonde hair and beard. &quot;You were right, dude!&quot;, he exclaimed, smiling at Derek. &quot;Wearing a suit is freaking awesome!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Derek smiled back. &quot;Told ya&quot;. He then stared at his lover, his brow furrowed. &quot;You know, bro, you look different from me and...&quot;, and looked at the clerk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Connor&quot;, the other man replied. &quot;And yes, Jake, you certainly stand out. Come with me, I'll show you&quot;, and led him to the mirror in the Change Room.<br />
<br />
As Derek and Connor said, there were some differences: they were subtle, but undoubtedly there. Apart from the tanned skin, he was slightly taller and more massive than the other two. His suit was still pin-striped, but it was of a rich navy blue, with a pale blue shirt; and shining around his thick wrist, there was a platinum watch. &quot;I guess the shop appreciates the fact that you voluntarily applied for a job&quot;, Connor explained with a foxy grin. &quot;It looks like you're the one who's in charge, now&quot;.<br />
<br />
And indeed, Jake could feel a pleasurable sensation building inside his chest: he felt more self-confident and powerful than he ever felt before. &quot;You can bet your ass I'm the boss&quot;, he said, before tossing Connor on the nearest sofa with a little effort and then lunging at him, forcefully inserting his tongue in the clerk's mouth. Less than a second later, though, Connor was way too eager to kiss back. &quot;So, what are you going to do now?&quot;, the smaller clerk then asked his new boss. &quot;Want me to explain you and Derek how the shop works, or you want to have some fun with one of us while the other takes care of the customers?&quot;.</p>
