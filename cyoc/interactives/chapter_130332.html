<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric stared with his jaw open at the Lisa sitting across the table.  She smiled sweetly as her head distorted, growing wider.  Her smile stretched, pulled both left and right simultaneously.  She rested 6 of her 8 upper torso arms neatly on the table in front of her.  Her 8 upper torso breasts shook as her entire body spasmed briefly at the stretching sensation.  Her 6 additional legs and 8 armed/8breasted 3 lower torsos sticking horizontally out behind her shifted slightly to the side, briefly letting Eric see her full body and the rows upon rows of cleavage hanging down from her lower torsos.<br />
<br />
Next to Eric, Lisa&#39;s 2nd body was undergoing a similar change - her head stretched to the side.  She stared in wonder and amazement at her body across the table, glad to be able to see what was happening.  Up in Eric&#39;s room, her 3rd body shut down Eric&#39;s computer and went into Eric&#39;s bathroom in order to watch herself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
The changes happened fairly quickly, but they felt like it took forever.  Only about 15 seconds after she started to stretch, her heads had stretched to nearly double their starting width.  Her nose split, quickly becoming 2 separate noses that both shifted towards opposite edges of her stretching face.  Her lips split vertically and skin grew between them.  Her tongue split and the two tongues shifted to either side of her extra wide mouth.  For a few seconds she was able to touch her tongue with her other tongue.  Then a layer of flesh grew between the two tongues, segmenting them into separate mouths.<br />
<br />
A new eye opened in the center of her face, between the two noses.  It blinked.  Then stretched rapidly to the sides, quickly turning into 2 eyes.  All 4 eyes blinked at the same time.  Then the left pair of eyes blinked, then the right pair of eyes blinked.<br />
<br />
The changing quickly spread to her neck, which stretched to the side rapidly, as though it was catching up with her head.  In just 5 seconds, her neck stretched and split into 2 separate necks.  The necks shifted towards her shoulders, moving apart from each other.  They each connected to her head directly beneath one of her faces, now fully formed.  Additionally hair rapidly grew in, filling out her thinned hair with identical beautiful locks.<br />
<br />
Her head stopped stretching.  Now she had a single head with 2 complete faces side by side.  A crease appeared in the skin between the faces and rapidly vertically bisected the two halves of her stretched head.  The halves shifted apart and the crease expanded.  Flesh receded and rearranged as her double-wide head finished splitting into 2 normal sized heads.  A pair of inner ears grew in directly next to each other, on separate heads.  The heads shifted along her shoulders for a few more seconds, stopping once they had 3 inches of space between them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eric spoke, &quot;Holy shit...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa didn&#39;t move.  Her eyes seemed dull, unfocused.  Eric looked at the Lisa standing next to him.  She also now had 2 heads, but both sets of eyes were unfocused and didn&#39;t react when he waved his hand in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh...  Lisa.  Lisa!  Lisa talk to me!  Can you hear me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
He grabbed hold of her shoulder and shook her.  To his surprise and dismay, the Lisa standing next to him swayed back and forth, then started to tip to one side.  He grabbed two of her arms and tried to hold her up from falling, but was only pulled down with her.<br />
<br />
Her upper torso hit the floor first.  Eric looked over at her rear body in time to see it fall down gradually - each lower torso pulling another pair of legs down, and each pair of legs pulling another lower torso down.  Several thuds later, that Lisa was on her side on the floor.  Her arms were splayed everywhere, both beneath and above her body.<br />
<br />
Eric panicked, &quot;Oh, fuck.  This isn&#39;t supposed to be able to happen!  Did she do something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned and ran upstairs to his bedroom.  Emerging from the door to his bathroom was the rear 2 torsos of another Lisa body.  Like the ones downstairs, they didn&#39;t move.  He turned to his computer and started it up.  The operating system loading screen greeted him and informed that it had updates to install.<br />
<br />
Eric groaned, this was the worst time possible.  He slammed his fist against the desk in frustration and rage.  Sullenly, he collapsed into his computer chair and stared at the spinning circle.  Time passed slower than ever.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric?&quot; &quot;Eric?&quot;  Lisa&#39;s voice echoed from the bathroom.  Eric was out of the chair instantly and ran over to Lisa&#39;s rear torsos where she stuck out of the bathroom.  He carefully laid his hand on Lisa&#39;s posterior, &quot;Lisa, can you hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!  Why the hell am I on the kitchen floor?&quot; &quot;Yes!  Why the hell am I on the kitchen floor?&quot;  Lisa&#39;s voice again echoed from the bathroom.  Not a normal echo, where it&#39;s the exact same sound overlayed.  This was different, as though 2 people spoke at the same time in a similar but not identical fashion.  Eric was pretty sure he knew why.<br />
<br />
&quot;When your heads split you stopped moving.  I thought you had gone braindead.  I tried to wake you up but it didn&#39;t work and uh... well you fell over.&quot;<br />
<br />
The annoyance in her echoed voices clearly told Eric she was upset, &quot;Well instead of groping my ass, can you help?&quot; &quot;Well instead of groping my ass, can you help?&quot;<br />
<br />
He rushed downstairs to find the two Lisas downstairs were again moving.  4 pairs of eyes looked at him as he entered the room.  The Lisa who had been sitting at the table had moved behind the Lisa on the floor and was propping up her torso to make standing up easier.  &quot;A little help?&quot; asked one of fallen Lisa&#39;s heads.  &quot;I uh... I don&#39;t have enough space here to really stretch out and stand up how I normally would.&quot; her other head explained.<br />
<br />
With the help of both her other body and Eric&#39;s strength, they were quickly able to pull her fallen body up to her feet.  She rewarded Eric with a kiss on both cheeks (simultaneously, of course) then took a step back and looked her bodies over.  Eric gaped at his changed girlfriend.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do you think?&quot; Lisa asked Eric.  He swallowed a couple of times as he tried to come up with a diplomatic answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, fine.  I guess if you don&#39;t like this version of me, that&#39;s your choice.  But I like me.&quot;  Lisa grinned 4 grins and turned 2 of her heads inward.  Her lips touched and she leaned forward into a self kiss.  Her other body smiled and moaned slightly, then turned to Eric and explained,  &quot;Oh that feels good.  I mean, I know what it feels like to kiss myself.  I did that last night.  But this, with both heads on 1 body.  Oh, this is very different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without breaking off her kisses, Lisa reached up and started to grope her many large supple breasts.  From where Eric stood, he could see a multitude of arms hanging from her lower torsos groping breasts there too.  She squished her breasts together, pinched her nipples, pulled them, and massaged them all at the same time.  Moans of ecstasy echoed from the other Lisa in the kitchen, and faintly from upstairs.<br />
<br />
A couple of hands reached for her genitalia - her paired penis and vagina in each crotch.  The arms stopped moving just before reaching her genitals, paused for a few seconds, then instead hung loosely down.  Her many other arms slowed their ministrations and hung down.  Lastly, Lisa broke off her kiss.  She sensually licked both pairs of lips and winked to herself.  Both heads turned to Eric.  Once again, his jaw was hanging open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, I knew you would love this form.  Every little thing I do sets you off.  Ohh, it feels good to be so damn sexy!&quot;  The grins on Lisa&#39;s faces spoke volumes alone on how she felt.<br />
<br />
Lisa standing next to Eric nudged him slightly with one elbow and he broke out of his trance.  &quot;Uh sorry.  That was... I&#39;ve never seen anything like that before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa nodded her heads.  &quot;Of course not!  I&#39;m pretty darn unique now.&quot; The Lisa standing next to Eric continued, &quot;Well, I guess unique might not be the right word, considering there&#39;s more than one of me.  But still!&quot; She shifted to speaking with yet another head, &quot;So, now that you&#39;re cognizant again... What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Eric gulped one more time then spoke, &quot;I... I respect the choice you made.  You look amazing and you really seem to like it.  But I&#39;m... uh... sad that you ignored my concerns.  How are you going to live your life now?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Lisa who Eric was talking to held up 1 hand with a finger up, and both of Lisa&#39;s heads shook, creating an odd effect where it looked more like she was rocking out to music than non-verbally scolding him.  &quot;My two heads aren&#39;t the only change I made.  I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;</p>
