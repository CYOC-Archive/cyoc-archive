<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric was quick get to his homework and begin working on it after finishing up the dishes with Nate. He didn&#39;t have too much to do, but it was still homework and weremer or not, engaged to the most beautiful mermaid or not, Eric wasn&#39;t going to let his grades slip. He quickly set about getting to work on his homework and being as diligent as possible. He continued working on his homework and managed to get it done with plenty of time. With that done, Eric&#39;s thoughts rapidly turned to Julie and their future plans, like practicing their dancing. As he thought of that, another thing came to mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d best leave a note for Nate,&quot; Eric thought as he looked up to door, &quot;Nate may have a date tomorrow... but surely he could be there to help for a little while before he goes and if not, mom can help...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Eric was quick to get a piece of paper and write out a short note to Eric to ask for his help and instruction after school to help him and Julie with regard to their dance practices before he left for his date. He and Julie could then practice until his dad came home or until Julie had to go. Once he had the note written, he got up and walked into the hallway. As he walked by his parent&#39;s bedroom he could manage to hear a series of mewling and yipping moans rising through the door. The door and walls might not be soundproof, but they did muffle the sound and even Eric&#39;s weremer ears could hear as his parents enjoyed each other&#39;s company.  He felt glad that they were getting along so well and simply went about his mission to leave the note on Nate&#39;s bed and then quickly returned to his bedroom so he could get in contact with the one person he wished was there with him right now.<br />
<br />
He was quick to get his computer turned on and connected to Skype. It took him a little while to get a full connection, which had him anxiously waiting to see if he would. There was an internet connection, but his eagerness to see Julie again made him forget as to whether or not an internet connection was truly needed to Skype. Thankfully, his Skype&#39;s connection went through  and he found that Julie was actually trying to call him that way. He answered it and the screen soon came up to reveal Julie sitting in front of her computer. She had apparently just gotten out of the shower as she was wrapped in a large fuzzy white towel while another white towel was wrapped up like a turban around her hair. Eric couldn&#39;t help but smile as he saw her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello... my Jewel,&quot; Eric said to her, his blue eyes twinkling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where were you? I&#39;ve been trying to get you for the past ten minutes!&quot; Julie said quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry...&quot; Eric answered quickly, &quot;I had to help my brother with the dishes before getting to my homework.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Julie responded, &quot;is he okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems to be,&quot; Eric answered, &quot;he&#39;s out with Alex right now and that makes him happy...&quot; He paused a faint cry of &quot;yes&quot; was heard in the house indicating that his parents were moving along well, &quot;Though I did leave him a note for our dance practice tomorrow. It&#39;ll have to be quick, because I think he has a date tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... so long as we get some practice, I think we&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Julie gave a smile, &quot;and for us to be together...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; Eric smiled.<br />
<br />
The two sat quietly looking and smiling to each other for a few moments. Eric basked in just being able to see his true love. To see her breathe gently in and out. To see her blue eyes blink almost in time with his own. It felt like being in heaven just to have that experience and that was worth it. Eventually he had to tell Julie that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so glad to have met you,&quot; Eric stated, &quot;You&#39;ve made me happy. You&#39;ve been friendly and helped me get used to all the were related stuff that makes up Moon Lake. You let me join you and be with you. I love you so much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you are my one true love,&quot; Julie smiled, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have won your heart if I didn&#39;t do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but I&#39;m glad you did, and love you even more for it,&quot; Eric answered, &quot;It makes me feel complete and makes me feel more a part of something that I ever had before. I&#39;ve played baseball in the past... but I never really connected with my teammates in anything close to what you and I have... and many of the other kids also got irritated with the fact that I also enjoyed science and books. So then I didn&#39;t really fit in anywhere else because I wasn&#39;t all one thing... But you, my Jewel... you complete me. You make me feel a part of Moon Lake. I am deeply honored to have you in my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I love being in your life,&quot; Julie answered with a warm smile, &quot;and I look forward to every day I can spend with you... regardless of what it is we&#39;re doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric nodded and looked to Julie&#39;s image on the screen. A part of him wanted to kiss the spot where Julie was on that screen as he felt his heart beat harder as he looked to her. They just sat quietly as the clock on his computer turned to ten PM. After a few more moments he found his voice again.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s getting late,&quot; Eric said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Julie replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish we could speed up time... to after college... to when we have our own place,&quot; Eric commented, &quot;and I could just hold you in my arms and tell you how much I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Julie agreed with a sigh, &quot;but I suppose if we did that we&#39;d miss out on all the fun that we&#39;d likely have between now and then. Think of all the dances... going to the official pod meeting next summer. We&#39;d miss out on that if we just went to fast forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric gave a small chuckle, &quot;Your right... It&#39;s an odd feeling, I suppose. I don&#39;t want to miss out on that... but I want to be able to hold onto you and say good night to you intimately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Intimately?&quot; Julie raised an eyebrow and gave a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t start anything that you know we can&#39;t finish,&quot; Eric warned.<br />
<br />
Julie&#39;s only answer was a giggle, but she did eventually nod in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose this is where we say good night, then,&quot; Julie commented after a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Eric nodded, &quot;good night, my Jewel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night, my love,&quot; Julie answered.<br />
<br />
With that the two signed off and in their respective homes began to get ready for bed.</p>
