<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie looked at the seventy year old woman in front of her. Mary was a matronly looking woman with wrinkles covering her face and shoulder length grey hair. The woman wore a conservatively cut peach sundress with matching hat and sandals that covered most of her weathered feet. The years had taken there toll on Mary whose large d cup breasts sagged considerably. Her clear blue eyes did glitter with exuberance, which made Katie think Mary was going to be an energetic child. Katie now smiled at Mary. &quot;Okay Mary I&#39;ll make you eight years old but I want you to keep your mind. I&#39;m also going to make it so Claudia, Mika and Samantha know your getting younger so they can watch.&quot; Katie made her wish and now watched as Mary&#39;s regression began.<br />
<br />
Mary shuddered as she felt a tingle spread through her body. If she hadn&#39;t been expecting something she would of never felt anything. &quot;How you feel Mary,&quot; Claudia asked. Mary shrugged and looked at her friend. &quot;Okay so far,&quot; she answered. &quot;Do I look any younger?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia closely examined her friend adjusting her glasses to try and get a better look. &quot;Noting so far,&quot; she answered. &quot;Then again my eyes aren&#39;t what they used to be plus at our age I&#39;m sure any signs would be minimal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary nodded and looked out towards the water. She tried to focus her mind to see if she could feel herself getting younger. Mary could feel a slight tingle resonating throughout her body but it was almost inperseptible. As Mary was about to give up hope that Katie was telling the truth Mika began to yell. &quot;Mary your hair!&quot; She exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it,&quot; Mary asked with concern. Mika stared wide eyed at her friend. &quot;Your...your hair....it&#39;s turning red again.&quot; She stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; Mary exclaimed. &quot;Quick give me a mirror.&quot; Mika and Claudia quickly began digging through their purses finally producing a small compact mirror. Mary took the mirror and began to examine her reflection in the small mirror. The changes to her subtle but she could see changes. Her face seemed less wrinkled and fresher than before. As Mary looked at her hair she was astounded by what she saw. Mary&#39;s auburn hair was beginning to return replacing the grey strand by strand. If Mary now estimated her age to be closer to fifty than seventy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Mary whispered. &quot;She was telling the truth.&quot; Katie smiled at Mary as she re-entered her forties. &quot;I told you I could make you young again.&quot;  She said.<br />
<br />
Mary looked in the small mirror again as she entered her mid forties. Most of the grey had been replaced by flowing auburn locks that seemed o be growing. Mary&#39;s hair now descended to the middle of her back and was fuller than before. She now adjusted her sunhat to let her hair flow freely down her back. &quot;This is incredible,&quot; she said as she became forty. &quot;I can&#39;t believe this Katie. I mean I wanted it to be true but...I never thought....I never believed...&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie laughed softly as Mary re-entered her thirties. &quot;It&#39;s okay Mary,&quot; she said. &quot;I can see why you could have a hard time believing it. I didn&#39;t believe it when i first found the ring either. I hope though you like what you see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary nodded enthusiastically as she left her thirties and became 29. Her d cup breasts had lost the sag of old age becoming full and perky. Mary&#39;s skin was smooth and flawless revealing a beautiful, mature woman with a curvy frame and firm rear. Mary&#39;s face glowed with exuberance and energy with only a couple of lines around her eyes. Those too quickly faded as Mary left her late twenties becoming 25.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is incredible,&quot; Claudia stammered as she stared at her young friend. &quot;Mary how do you fell?&quot;<br />
<br />
24 year do Mary turned to her friend with a broad smile. &quot;This is incredible Claudia,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I feel so alive and full of energy. I mean just look at me I&#39;m so young I have my whole life ahead of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um Mary,&quot; Samantha said. &quot;You do realize your still getting younger right. You asked Katie to make you eight years old&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary froze as she realized Samantha was right. She had wished to be a child again not realizing the power of the ring. Quickly grabbing the mirror Mary saw a college coed staring back at her. As she ran her hands over her body she realized she was beginning to lose the curves of her twenties as she inched closer to teendom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um Katie,&quot; a now 20 year old Mary asked. &quot;Am I really going to become eight again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah Mary,&quot; Katie answered. &quot;That is what you wanted right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yes,&quot; the 19 year old answered. &quot;But I didn&#39;t think you could really do it. I&#39;m guessing that there&#39;s no way to stop this huh,&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie shook her head. &quot;Sorry Mary once the wish is made I can&#39;t stop it,&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary gulped and looked at the mirror. A girl no older than 18 now stared back at her. Mary&#39;s face was smooth an innocent with wide energetic blue eyes. As Mary ran her hands over her body she found herself to be a trim teen with a flat stomach, toned arms and legs, and a firm rear. The curves of her twenties had been wiped away. Grabbing her breasts Mary found she had decreased to a c cup but were much firmer and perkier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god Mary I think your getting shorter,&quot; Mika exclaimed. 16 year old Mary stood up and examined herself closely. She had lost a couple of inches in height as her curves continued to melt away. Mary discarded her beach sandals and wiggled her toes in the sand. Her feet were smooth and soft unlike the rough and weathered ones she was used to. Mary&#39;s peach sundress was loose on her teenage frame especially on her waist and chest. Finally it was beginning to slide down her legs as it rested mid shin instead of knee length.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay this feels so weird,&quot; 15 year old Mary exclaimed. &quot;I&#39;m like totally a teenager right now,&quot; Claudia placed her hand on her friends shoulder and smiled. &quot;It&#39;s okay Mary,&quot; she said now looking down at her shorter friend. &quot;Your still you...even if you are now shorter than me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary looked at Claudia and smiled. &quot;Thanks for that Claud,&quot; she said incredulously. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Claudia chuckled. &quot;It&#39;s just you were always so much taller than me it&#39;s weird looking down on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The 14 year old girl smiled and shrugged as she adjusted her loosening sundress. Mary examined her body finding she had delicate teenage features with b cup breasts and flared hips. She was also continuing to shrink as the sundress rested just above her ankles. Mary continued to examine her body as she became 13. Her curves continued to melt away leaving her a skinny teen with red hair and a smattering of freckles on her nose. Mary shrank again she left her teens becoming 12. Her breasts were reduced to a couple of small mounds the size of softballs while her hips were barely flared and appeared boyish.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay Mary,&quot; Mika asked. The  12 year old looked up at her a smiled. &quot;Yeah I feel good,&quot; Mary said in a childish voice as she slipped to 11. &quot;It&#39;s weird watching yourself going through puberty in reverse. I mean look at me my boobs are almost gone I really look and feel like a kid again. The women stared in awe as Mary became 10 leaving all signs of puberty behind. The 10 year old seemed a little more comfortable now that she had left puberty behind and no longer seemed as concerned with her undeveloping body. Mary looked herself over marveling at how large he sundress was on her. Mary also had to continually push her overly large sunhat up over her eyes as it continued to slide. <br />
<br />
Mary continued to shrink as she became 9. The sundress, which had covered her except for her toes, now covered her feet completely forcing the young girl to hike up her dress to see her feet. Mary&#39;s freckles also continued to expand as they now covered her nose and cheeks. Finally Mary became 8 leaving her an adorable freckle faced child with an innocent face, wide eyes, and long red hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel,&quot; the women asked their diminutive friend. Eight year old Mary lifted her sunhat and smiled broadly at her elderly friends. &quot;That was incredible,&quot; she beamed. &quot;I&#39;m so young and full of energy you have to try this.&quot; Mary turned towards Katie with an appreciative look on her face. &quot;Thank you Katie,&quot; she said looking up at the older girl. &quot;I couldn&#39;t be happier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie smiled down at the young girl with a smile. &quot;Your welcome Mary I hope you enjoy yourself.&quot; The tiny child smiled and nodded her head.<br />
<br />
Katie turned to the awestruck women in front of her and grinned. &quot;So,&quot; she asked. &quot;Who wants to go next?&quot;</p>
