<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ralph and I lead the new Donkey along on side streets as we walk slowly to her new home. I've been a bull myself and been reverted back, almost back to my original human shape, but these walks do something to me.<br />
<br />
I walk the volunteer, humm that's a laugh, most don't do this out of choice! I'll call the victim, as we walk the victim it breaks my hard heart to see the flow of tears running down hairy cheeks. Snuffles and snorts as the victim's nostrils get congested as both fear and a deep sadness wells up.<br />
<br />
My change was quick and done when sedated. The average number of victims change in public, watching others till they can't help but notice their changes too. Then gut wrenching sorrow as they see humanity slipping away, and with it all they treasured leaving their grasp. Part of me wants to stop and cup her chin in my hands and tell her that she will be well treated. Oh so many comforting things I'd like to say but my Superior would hear of it from Ralph or somebody and I'd be chasing cows again very soon.<br />
<br />
Her head comes more to attention as she sniffs the breeze and seems to know we are close to Jeb Flycatcher's Stable. I would think it odd if one were a patron of this Park to see four or five security guards at a time walking lone donkeys, mules, or on occasion a real sized horse to the stables ahead. One would look and wonder where are the animals came from or what poorly run Park this is to have so many animals escape the pens.<br />
<br />
&quot;Afternoon Jeb this little girl was named Jenny by her drivers license, I think we could leave her with that name, don't you?&quot; I asked the wrinkled, crotchity, old man.<br />
<br />
A simple smile and he took her leed. She paused to glance back a look to me that made me wonder if she was saying thanks for the kindness, or curse you for what I am to live like, I just don't know?<br />
<br />
To the corral she is put and stands looking at Ralph and I as we collect our bounty. As I walk away the loud screaming bray echo's the buildings of Western Town. Ralph and I turn to see and their standing by the corral rail is Jenny, a new donkey male has mounted her and she knows her part in this hell hole of a Park. I turn around and continue to walk till I notice Ralph is still standing, watching the poor girl get raped by her first of many to come.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Ralph there's work to be done and more bounties to be caught!&quot; I yelled as the wolfman turns to the work he so loves.<br />
&quot;We must report to Madame' Illusia's theater rear entrance, she has <br />
a buck goat ready for delivery!&quot; Ralph gave his normal growling grunt and we walked on in silence.<br />
<br />
The Theater the old woman had was at the end of Fantasy Lane. A person would be most lucky if their morals lasted to get this far down a street filled with fantasies' both desirable and wildly immoral. The Madame' might be either and worked her devilish ways as the spirit moved her evil wit. We stop outside the theater and watch as her nephew Steven rounds up the curious and those too drunk to care into the front of his Auntie's front.<br />
<br />
I motion to Ralph that we walk the alley to the rear door less the patrons going in the front door catch a glimse of a less than happy customer leaving for a life of beastial exisitance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Afternoon oh great Madame' Illusia!&quot; as I greet her witha low bow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you wonderful young man, if I was sixty years younger I'd...&quot; she returns my blarny. Ralph being Ralph pipes up, &quot;Yea, sixty years younger and she still be older than my Grandmother!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Madame looks sternly at Ralph as she doesn't accept criticism all to well. I motion for Ralph to stand in place and walk with the Madame to her backstage corral. &quot;Holy Cow! He's huge, must weigh in at close to 400 pounds.&quot; I exclaim as the big black goat prances about before me.<br />
<br />
The Madame' smiles, &quot;He was a railroad man, well muscled and full of drink. I had a urge and soon he found himself as a degraded intelligence buck goat. Oh he remember's things but the instincts have taken hold and there's nothing he can do, he's a goat! Oh and come back tomorrow and his friend promised me money to change him back. I fed him some Hog Flux and he's on his way to be a fine Berkshire boar. Come around tomorrow about four and he will be in the pen ready for shipment. Oh and I'll give you a cut of his earnest money too.&quot; she said almost in a whisper, and then laughed.<br />
<br />
The buck in his corral seemed to get on edge when she laughed. I leaned over to her and whispered, &quot;see ralph there, i'll give you back my share for a little favor. He's a pain in the butt to me, i'd be very pleased if you could make him one of your prized breeders. I'd send him to market and the park would't know till he didn't show up fro rollcall the next morning. He would by then be on his way to the P.I.A.P. hotdog plant, deal?&quot; i asked in a whisper.<br />
<br />
The Madame' was never one to turn down a profit and casting a gaze at Ralph standing his ground like a mutt told to stay, she gave me a nod of the head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ralph, hey big boy come here to Madame' I want someone with true muscles to get something for me.&quot; she called out.<br />
<br />
Ralph smiled at me like he was her favorite over me and walked close to the evil old lady. The last I saw of them they turned a corner into a hall leading to her private quarters. I looked at the big buck male goat and wondered how he might act as we walked him to the departing pens. A short trip to the mainland and he'd be in his new home before clockout time. As I peered into his yellow eyes the dumb look of one lost in beastial and brainless life blinked back at me.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a blood crudling scream from the rear quarters turned me around. I ran across the backstage and turned down the long hall. A door opened at the far end and out came Madame' with Ralph.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, Jay he's drugged and will be docile for the afternoon and evening. Be sure, the Flux was rough on him sice he was a canine before. His change to hog will happen before midnight, I made him a sow so nobody might figure out who he was before.&quot; said the Madame' being proud of her evil ways.<br />
<br />
I put a lasso over the black goat and Ralph holding the end of the rope we began our long walk to the departure pens. The big buck was to my surprise very easy going and the walk went very well indeed. I had to think that since the man was drunk when he changed his mind accepted it as part of the many hangovers of the past. The beast pranced along like he was going to a vacation. Well it might work out that way since he was to be used, or put to work as a breeder. <br />
<br />
Breeders, I'd been to the P.I.A.P. farm and seen the hundreds of horny females stand tail high, head low, and in dire need of a good...<br />
Oh yea, but then those few male goats going from the trough for food and hormones, then trotting back to breeding. Back and forth the males go till without sleep they fold over, some dead, some out cold. I remember mounting cows, but never did I mount more than six times a day, the bucks mount a hundred times per day, and some even more, what a life!&quot;<br />
<br />
Our bounty recieved, Ralph and I turn to leave but then Ralph begins to scratch. &quot;What's wrong Ralph?&quot; I ask sounding concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what she did! A fucking sow, you sold me to that nasty ole' bitch, and she injected me with Hog Flux. I know, I know, I read it in the injection needle as she poked me in the Kidney. Well we will leave on the boat soon and when I report to the Chief we'll see who's a sow and who's a security guard!&quot; he told em off.<br />
<br />
Lyle Buckingham was standing near by and being a good friend in the security division he stepped up. &quot;Trouble fella's?&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave a look to Lyle and he semed to understand since he had worked with Ralph a number of times before. &quot;Come out of the Sun Ralph and tell me the problem, if it's too big I'll call the Chief.&quot; Ralph starred at Lyle for a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup, the Chief is here visiting today and checking for cracks in security, come in out of the heat.&quot; offered Lyle.  As Ralph stepped inside he looked at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Changling, Madame' Illusia did it, he knows but is on his way by midnight!&quot; I quickly inform Lyle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Know's what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A sow!&quot; I reply as Lyle makes a big smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ill keep him here till the hooves show up then have him caged till the morning shipment, right?&quot; Lyle asked having all well in hand.<br />
<br />
I shook his hand on it and was glad to see that grunting jerk on his way to getting what he loved to watch.<br />
<br />
A warm Sunday afternoon and my thoughts turned to a calm ferry ride back to the park. I was on the upper deck looking out as the ferry left the dock. The grunting sounds of some patron turned my head. The sighting of a fat man slowly sitting into a deck chair drew the attention first.<br />
<br />
I walked over and sat next to him as he wiggled about trying to fit down onto the chair. &quot;Afternoon, hot isn't it!&quot; I said to break the ice.<br />
<br />
He looked up at me in fear and I felt the fear in my heart as well. &quot;Trouble, are you having some trouble, can I help, I'm not a tough like most of our guards!&quot; I tried to comfort the man.<br />
<br />
He wiggled some more and kept an eye on me without a word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please is there any way I could help, sir?&quot; I asked again. Then as he strained for comfort the telltail sign of animal poked up. He had a sheath, it poked up under his shirt making a real tent. I watched him try not to set too low and figured he had some sort of tail as well. It wasn't till a shoe slipped off and a sock came into view with the tips of cloven hoove peeking out through a tare.<br />
<br />
&quot;You going to visit Madame' Illusia today?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
The man's eyes went wide and the fear plus sweat poured from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I..I.. must go there and pay for the release of my friend!&quot; he said almost blubbering with grief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Railroad man?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES, yes, a railroad man he was!&quot; the short man replied.<br />
<br />
I looked down, I knew what was in store for him as his friend had just been delivered to the corrals. I didn't know what to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've seen him?&quot; he asked quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and your too late! The Madame' had him sent to the Farm and is waiting for someone to come back to her. She plans to make the money man a Berkshire boar for life and keep the money he brings.&quot; I replied as not feeling to happy about our meeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I'm stuck! I'll be a boar hog whether she gets the money or not!&quot; he said with a moan. &quot;Hey how do you know so much about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
What was I to say?</p>
