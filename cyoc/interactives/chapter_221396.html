<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty and Eileen watched as Ty’s mother or rather now little sister, cried on the floor her knees in her shirt just as a child would cry.<br />
<br />
“Maybe you should turn her back, she seems pretty miserable and she doesn’t have the courtesy of sexual pleasure like I did” Eileen laughed quietly as she whispered. TY thought about this and her really felt this was the better option “no I can’t just turn her back not until she’s learned a lesson” he said with slight annoyance at all he’s been through. Eileen nodded and motioned for them to go downstairs into the living room.<br />
<br />
“Well now that your stepmom is a child and your little sister what are you going to do about your living situation” she said referring to the lack of parental figures in the home. “Oh crap I completely forgot about that” he said and thought for a sec, “I got it!” He said in excitement “Dustin!” He said with a snap. Eileen looked at her boyfriend and laughed “Dustin? Your older brother who is as dumb as he is big” she said “how is he going to help in this equation?” Eileen asked as Ty still grinned.<br />
“It’s simple when he gets back from football practice I’ll make him into our parent, of course I can make him capable of taking care of two kids and he wouldn’t be so mean to me especially with my new power” Ty smiled<br />
<br />
Later that night a car pulled up to the front of the house “he’s here!” Eileen had yelled from downstairs alerting Ty while also alerting June who was still crying softly. Ty ran past her room but stopped at the top step before heading down “June” he said to the girl crying. June looked up to him with red eyes from all the crying “Ty I’m not a child…you shouldn’t call me by my first name” she sad softly almost defeated. Ty smiled some “June you can’t live in this fantasy forever… once you except that you’ve never been an adult then you’ll finally start to grow up” he smiled as if he was actually talking to his little sister for real instead of his mother. June looked down but took her knees out of her shirt, she nodded “okay” she said as if she finally accepted her fate as Ty’s little 13 year old sister “thanks Ty”. <br />
<br />
Ty went downstairs “ok when he gets in I need you to distract him anyway you can, I’m not sure it’ll work if he knows what’s going on” Ty said to Eileen who nodded “by any means?” She asked. Ty nodded “just get him to focus on you and nothing else” they both were in agreement. <br />
<br />
Dustin walked in “Mom I’m home, coach said I was a pro on the field today” he laughed “I’m hungry” he said grumbly. Hard to believe Dustin was related to June but he was indeed her son or use to be, he was a 17 year old senior and a pro football athlete, if it wasn’t for Ty passing all these classes for him he would’ve flunked out. “Mom where are you?” He said setting the keys on the counter. Eileen had been in the kitchen “who are you?” Dustin asked as he saw the young 15 year old cooking “you one of Ty’s little friends” he scoffed “that freak couldn’t get Mackey as a friend how could he get a pretty girl like you” Dustin spat, Eileen laughed “oh he’s more impressive in other ways, and I’m not his friend, I’m his girlfriend Eileen” she smiles and places the hot pan on the counter “you just be hungry big boy” she giggled. Dustin looked at the food and began to eat “this is amazing” he keeps eating “this is better than my moms food” he kept chewing. Eileen smiled “I’m glad you enjoy the meal, I made it just for you” she says and notices his body mass disappearing. “Sooo Dustin… do you work out” she says smirking as he scarfs down the food, “yeah I do like the guns” he says finishing the meal “yes I do… you’re so strong way stronger than my boyfriend” she smiles rubbing her hands on his back as his body starts to shrink and change but Dustin was too distracted by the back rub to notice. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile with Ty <br />
<br />
“Perfect that food she made him should have eased his nerves he’s almost relaxed enough to do mental changes” he smiles “keep it going Eileen, hell sleep with him if you need to I just need 5 more minutes” Ty says watching Dustin’s lower body shrink and feminize his shoes falling off of his now dainty feminine feet. “I bet you get all the girls, a big strong man like yourself” she purrs in his ear causing him to shiver at the words “yeah I have slept with all the cheerleaders” he smiles his ass growing to a very round and plump size. Dustin takes notice but Eileen pulls his face to hers and kisses him “Jesus Eileen is definitely getting into her roll” Ty mentioned as he watches Dustin’s body start to shrink to 5’5 his hair growing to his lower back. Eileen pulled back from the kiss seeing Dustin’s face change completely from a ugly young man to a very beautiful woman “oh” she said but stopped herself “oh I loved the kiss” she says and takes notice of the pair of breast growing from Dustin’s chest “yeah I can be really good to you” Dustin says but stops when he hears his voice change into a sexy slightly seductive tone “what’s happening” he says coughing noticing his hands, arms and chest “what’s going on!” He says and moans as his hard cock shrink into his body slurping itself up and opening a new way of life for children. “ Diana… are you ok?” Eileen says working Dustin’s new name in to help with the mental changes. Dustin now Diana stares at her body “no who is…I’m-“ she says and grabs her throat “that’s me…” he moans “I’m-“ he is stopped by Eileen “Diana… are you ok you look confused” she says “come you shouldn’t be sitting” she says helping her up. Diana is now 36 and still aging her bodies new changes too drastic for the clothing she once wore. “I don’t understand…wasn’t I a boy” she says her memories getting foggy since she’s always been a girl, a mother to her only daughter June and her adopted son Ty… right? <br />
<br />
“Almost done Eileen just one more thing” Ty says walking out to the kitchen “hey mom” he says to Diana formerly Dustin a now 43 year old woman “how was work? I love the new look” he says laughing slightly as the woman before him is in men clothing that’s far too baggy for her figure practically falling off. “Ty…you’re my…” Ty interrupted “son” he says and Diana nods “yes my son…” all of Dustin was gone and all that was left was Tys new step mother Diana. June comes downstairs “what’s going” she says and notices her mother “mom” she covers her eyes “put some clothes on” she blushes it seems June has accepted her role. <br />
<br />
“Sorry sweetie I don’t know what I was thinking” she covers herself</p>
