<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There were many young couples celebrating Valentine&#39;s Day. Most of them were couples who first bonded when the Animalian Virus broke down the species barrier. Despite the rather unusual circumstances of their bonding, their love was quite as strong as any normal couples. A good example could be seen with the double-dosed members of Animalia Ambassadoria.<br />
<br />
==============<br />
<br />
Probably the best example of the bunch was the first human to be converted into an Animalian. Abigail Brown sometimes barely felt like the 14 year old she chronologically was. She has had the body of a young woman for several months now. A very curvy and muscular woman at that. Who would have thought a simple ride in the woods on her family&#39;s stallion would change both their lives in so many ways. Well, it wasn&#39;t really just their lives. Abby was the first human to be converted so it showed just what the Animalian Virus was capable of. Her relationship with Samson was one of the founding blocks of Animalia and it never would have happened if Abby hadn&#39;t taken Samson for a ride that day. So she thought it would be fun to &#39;act out&#39; the circumstances of her conversion.<br />
<br />
Of course, the situation wouldn&#39;t be completely identical. For starters, they were keeping inside Abby&#39;s room instead of being in the woods. The whole thing was more like a roleplay that happened to include some similarities to her conversion. Abby didn&#39;t know they made costumes for just such occasions until she visited the Intimacy Boutique. She had entered the store mostly out of curiosity and soon felt her face under her fur growing redder as she looked at the various pieces of lingerie on display. She nearly chickened out until she met Miss Vivian. While Abby was technically underaged, she was still double-dosed and her relationship with Samson was well-known. Somehow, Miss Vivian was able to worm out a few details of how Abby first met the uplifted Samson and before Abby knew it, she was given to sets of &#39;costumes&#39; for her and Samson to play out a sexy bit of roleplay.<br />
<br />
Right now, Abby was in the bathroom, adjusting her outfit. The whole lingerie ensemble was cleverly designed to resemble a cowgirl&#39;s outfit (not the literal kind of course). The stockings and garters resembled a cowgirl&#39;s chaps, but they didn&#39;t do much but cover the outside of her legs. Her panties were very visible and she didn&#39;t need to take off her &#39;chaps&#39; to pull them down. Her brassier was part of a set that included a very small cowboy&#39;s vest and a bolo tie. A second bolo tie kept the cups together. Of course, she also had a pair of gloves that went up to her elbows. The stetson on her head wasn&#39;t anything special, but it completed the western look. Abby was pretty certain this was the kind of outfit worn by strippers and was glad her parents were out right now. Even if they were both younger, healthier Animalians, the sight of their daughter wearing this outfit would probably give them double heart attacks.<br />
<br />
Once Abby was ready, she sauntered out of the bathroom and towards her room. &quot;Now where is that ornery old horse?&quot; she asked, adopting a Texan outfit for this roleplay, &quot;Ah can&#39;t believe that stubborn stud tossed me off my back and ran off on me. Ah think his tracks lead this way.&quot; With that, she walked into her room. Samson was waiting for her on the bed, wearing nothing but a saddle strapped to his back and a halter on his head. His costume wasn&#39;t very extensive, which made it a lot cheaper. &quot;You been a very naught horse, Samson,&quot; Abby mocked scolded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, ma&#39;am,&quot; said Samson, also faking a Texan accent, &quot;But a dang horsefly bit me where it sure hurts.&quot; He rubbed his sheath, encouraging his dick to slide out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you poor baby,&quot; said Abby with &#39;concern&#39;. She leaned down and felt up his shaft, causing Samson to stifle a groan. &quot;Oh, here&#39;s where the varmint bit ya,&quot; she said before kissing where the &#39;booboo&#39; was, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, stud. Ah&#39;ll make ya feel all better.&quot; With that, Abby pulled the bolo tie on her chest and allowed her breasts to bounce free. She grasped her breasts and wrapped them around Samson&#39;s dick. There was still some left sticking out and she wrapped her mouth around that.<br />
<br />
Samson groaned as Abby gave him an amazing titjob. It was better than the one that Clara had originally given him, which led to his accidental ejaculating on Abby and her subsequent conversion. Who&#39;d have though the little girl who had rode on his back would become the one mate he would never want to part with? He grunted as Abby&#39;s motions became faster. As much as he&#39;d like to finish, Abby would want to save the rest for later. Samson reached down and put a hand on the back of her head. &quot;Ah&#39;m feelin&#39; much better, ma&#39;am,&#39;&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Abby smiled before releasing her grip, allowing Samson&#39;s dick to slide out of her mouth. &quot;In that case, it&#39;s time to start ridin&#39; again,&quot; she said. She loosened her panties and allowed them to slide down her legs. With that, she crawled onto the bed, climbing on top of Samson&#39;s lap. She positioned his dick until he was pressing against her properly. &quot;Time ta hit the dusty trail,&quot; she said before lowering herself on him. Samson gave a low moan as he felt Abby&#39;s inside wrap around his length. She barely got to the base before she lifted herself up and went back down. Abby was soon riding Samson hard, almost as hard as she were really riding him like she used to. She gave moans herself as her movements became more frantic, which of course made her big breasts bounce. Samson had no trouble suckling from them, his halter not including a bit. Before long, the two of them let out a neigh as Samson gushed inside of Abby.<br />
<br />
The two horses panted and snorted as they calmed down. Abby stroked Samson&#39;s mane and said in her normal accent, &quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s Day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s Day,&quot; replied Samson before the two of them started kissing.<br />
<br />
==============<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Sarah and Malice were getting ready for their dates. Double-dating was very common for them ever since Malice claimed Simon. The two couples have been to many places, including the Steakhouse, the movies, and several of the new sights of Animalia. The Steakhouse was their pick for dinner tonight. Good thing they had reserved in advanced because the place would be packed today.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, anywhere in particular you want to go after dinner?&quot; asked Sarah as she brushed her hair.<br />
<br />
Malice gave Sarah an envious look. She wished she could have tresses like hers. Well, maybe her pups will someday. &quot;So long as we end up back in the bedroom, I don&#39;t really care,&quot; said Malice as she put some lipstick on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary Alice, we&#39;re not gonna have sex in the same room,&quot; said Sarah flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Malice, &quot;We&#39;re gonna live in a duplex someday. We might as well get used to having matings together now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah sighed. Malice could be so shameless at times. &quot;Malice, we really can&#39;t be sharing EVERYTHING,&quot; she said. &quot;Next you&#39;ll be suggesting we swap boyfriends.&quot;<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, Malice growled at that. &quot;Simon is mine,&quot; she growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I just joking,&quot; said Sarah, &quot;Besides, it wouldn&#39;t be permanent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malice tilted her head and asked, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, when couples are doing swaps, that just means they&#39;re switching partners for a round of sex. That doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re permanently trading mates,&quot; said Sarah.<br />
<br />
Malice thought it over and said, &quot;I still don&#39;t think so. I&#39;m happy with Simon, you&#39;re happy with Travis, why change that?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a little amusing to Sarah that the one bit of depravity that Malice wouldn&#39;t accept is partner swaps. She wondered if Travis would feel the same way. The idea didn&#39;t have much appeal to her either, but considering how things flowed, once could never be certain.<br />
<br />
Just then, Sarah&#39;s phone gave a buzz, indicating a newly-arrived text. Sarah looked at her phone and said, &quot;Oh, Malice, this is great news.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Did our boys find a place for us to go after dinner?&quot; asked Malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better than that,&quot; said Sarah, &quot;You remember Beth, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beth...Beth...wasn&#39;t she the Doberman that was trying to claim Simon because she was...uh...&quot; started Malice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lesbian,&quot; said Sarah. Uplifted Animalians were all heterosexual. The concept of being sexually attracted to someone of the same sex didn&#39;t make much sense to them. They didn&#39;t hate it, but having a mate that you couldn&#39;t produce children together with didn&#39;t seem to have much reason to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she and Eliza told their story anonymously to those reporters a week ago to see if how people would react to their relationship if they took it to the next level,&quot; said Sarah, &quot;Their story has gotten plenty of comments by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess, a lot of negative ones,&quot; growled Malice. For all the positive comments their webcasts have gotten, there were always some people who were saying hurtful things for different reasons. There were internet trolls such as the notorious &#39;Ih8Ulibs&#39; and people who thought Animalians were shameless beasts that didn&#39;t deserve sympathy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes,&quot; said Sarah, &quot;There are always people who have nothing good to say, gaybashers and stuff. But that&#39;s thankfully a minority in this case. Apparently there are still enough open-minded people who are telling Beth and Eliza to follow their dream and live their life. Just because homosexuality isn&#39;t popular doesn&#39;t mean that everyone&#39;s against it. And even the president&#39;s actions aren&#39;t swaying too many people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about their age difference?&quot; asked Malice, &quot;Won&#39;t people complain about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d think so, but not very many,&quot; said Sarah, &quot;Since a double dose would fix that, they don&#39;t have much of a leg to stand on. Maybe society hasn&#39;t developed that particular niche for hatred. Anyways, since the comments have been mostly in their favor, Beth just told me she and Eliza are going to get their second dose tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s good for them,&quot; said Malice. She didn&#39;t understand Beth&#39;s viewpoint very well, but that doesn&#39;t mean she was going to stand against it. &quot;You tell her that if anyone tries to mess with her afterwards, they&#39;ll have to deal with me,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If Beth becomes as big as I think she&#39;ll be, I don&#39;t think ANYONE will try to mess with her,&quot; said Sarah, &quot;But we better head on. The guys will be waiting.&quot; With that, the husky sisters started heading for the front door. Tonight was going to be a nice evening with their mates.</p>
