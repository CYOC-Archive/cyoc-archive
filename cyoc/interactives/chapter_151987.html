<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>There really needs to be a &#39;Hermaphrodite&#39; tag.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wolves, lions, and hyenas have more in common than people think. Not only are they all apex predators, but they are very social animals who live in close-knit groups. Of course, these groups can be very territorial and will want to drive out any competitors. However, uplifted Animalians can curb their territorial instincts and coexist more harmoniously.<br />
<br />
However, there was still a bit of competitiveness between certain species. Particularly between the hyena clan and lion pride who were part of Project Hermaphroditus. They never got vicious, but they did have a strong tendency to try to one-up each other. But now there was a wolf pack in their bisexual territory. More than that, they had five adult members. And since the hyena clan had six adult members, the lions have been wanting to expand their pride. That&#39;s why they were particularly thrilled to hear news from Horizon Labs.<br />
<br />
At first glance, Everix seemed to just be an ordinary male lion. But closer examination revealed she was actually a lioness with a surprisingly thick mane. The result of a hormonal imbalance, she also exhibited other male behavior such as a deeper roar and attempting to lie with other lionesses. The other lionesses weren&#39;t so receptive to Everix&#39;s advances. That was one of the reasons her zoo was donating her, so she wouldn&#39;t be such an &#39;odd lion out&#39;.<br />
<br />
The other herm lions were very eager to welcome a new member into their pride. In fact, they all went to Horizon Labs to greet her. &quot;Now just a minute,&quot; said Dr. Banjo, &quot;We don&#39;t need everyone in there at once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we wanna meet our new sister,&quot; said Petra, &quot;Well, sister/brother. We need to think up new terms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter what you call yourselves,&quot; said Dr. Banjo, &quot;But you don&#39;t need to all be here. Everix only needs a sample from one of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she can have some of my milk,&quot; said Lysine, &quot;I have more than enough to spare.&quot; While Animalian women are known for constantly producing milk, Lysine was making more in preparation for hir cubs growing inside hir. It was rather ironic actually. Diana and shi had been working hard to knock up Diana. But when they switched roles to keep things exciting, Diana got a lucky shot and managed to seed hir. Lysine had wanted to be the father for their first cubs, but shi was actually looking forward to being a mother now. At least hir pregnancy will be shorter than the herm mares.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, fine, but as I said, you don&#39;t all need to be here,&quot; said Banjo, &quot;You&#39;ll be crowding her as she adapts to her new form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, lions have to stick together,&quot; said Cameron, &quot;And I think shi&#39;ll adapt better than you think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Banjo sighed. He was so glad that he was an orangutan and not one of those hyper-competitive predators. &quot;Well, as soon as you&#39;ve donated your milk, we can begin with the uplifting,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Despite Banjo&#39;s attempts to keeping the lions from crowding Everix, there were still some involved in her uplifting. At least he had been able to reduce it to just Petra and Cameron and not all of them. Everix seemed interested as the two herm lions walked in. This was a good sign as lions tended to be belligerent to strange lions. When the bowl of milk was put down in front of her, Everix just sniffed it before she started lapping it up.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take too long for the changes to start. Everix moaned as she hunched over slightly. Her shoulders were expanding under her mane as her front legs started to become arms. Cameron could remember what it was like when shi uplifted. Of course, the big difference here was that Cameron was regrowing the mane shi had lost when she had been neutered. But Everix already had her mane, which seemed to be retaining its thickness during her transformation.<br />
<br />
Soon, Everix was able to sit up more as her torso began to flatten out. This gave Petra and Cameron a good view of when Everix&#39;s new breasts came in. Rather quickly, Everix put one of her new hands up to one breast and started squeezing it. But then the most significant change occurred. While her vagina had moved forward as her hindquarters restructured, her clit moved even further than that as it started growing bigger. It gained more size and girth as small nubs started to appear over it. But Everix wasn&#39;t officially a herm until a pair of testicles dropped into a new ballsack between hir vagina and hir new penis.<br />
<br />
Everix didn&#39;t take long to adapt to this new change. Bringing hir other hand down, shi started pumping hir new dick. &quot;Mmm...fffuck...&quot; groaned Everix with hir new voice, &quot;That feels rrreally good...&quot; Hir body was packing on more muscle as hir already considerable testosterone levels climbed even higher. But hir feminine side wasn&#39;t over looked as hir breasts were plenty big and hir hourglass figure still shown through. If Everix had any confusion about hir new body, shi wasn&#39;t showing it. In fact, shi was getting hirself as if shi had been doing it her whole life. &quot;Almost...got it...&quot; moaned Everix before letting out a small roar as shi came, hir new dick shooting out a load for the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was it like that for you?&quot; asked Petra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I think I was quieter,&quot; said Cameron.<br />
<br />
Everix sighed and said, &quot;That was great.&quot; Shi tried to stand up, but hir two new legs took getting used to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let us help you up,&quot; said Petra, extending a hand, Cameron doing the same.<br />
<br />
Everix graped both and pulled hirself up. &quot;Thanks,&quot; shi said, &quot;You two are like me, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but there aren&#39;t a lot people like us,&quot; said Petra, &quot;There are lion Animalians, but so far there are only five hermaphrodite lions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Animalians?&quot; asked Everix.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humanoid animals, like us,&quot; said Cameron, &quot;Some of them are uplifted from ordinary animals, others use to be human. We&#39;ve built up a society that you can join.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But only five of us herm lions?&quot; asked Everix, &quot;Sounds like we should have more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, not that I&#39;m not against it, but you don&#39;t seem perturbed about becoming both male and female,&quot; said Cameron.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, I&#39;ve felt like this my whole life. Well, not quite like this, but I always felt that I should be a lion than a lioness. And now I&#39;ve got the best of both worlds,&quot; said Everix, &quot;What&#39;s there to be upset about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know how you feel,&quot; said Petra, &quot;Though I&#39;m surprised there are transsexual animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s more of a hormone thing,&quot; said Cameron.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn&#39;t really matter now, does it?&quot; asked Everix.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess not,&quot; said Petra, &quot;Ok, let&#39;s get you cleaned up and something to wear. Then you can meet the other two lions in our little pride.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everix liked the sound of that. If the other lions were as sexy as these two, or how shi was hirself, shi could really learn to like it here.</p>
