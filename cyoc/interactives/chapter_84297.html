<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danna and Mikkie just stepped out of the plan, all giddy and excited about this. Danna was going to introduce her new line of kat clothing while Mikkie had volunteered to be the model, along with the two kats who came from Sydney and changed due to Flake and Alexis fun. The four were happy as they went through customs, though they did have trouble for the Russian customs weren&#39;t use to kats coming into the airport, they mostly used other means. Though the four found their bagage and the limo they were to take to the hotel. Danna was so excited that she was getting this oppertunity.<br />
<br />
It was late at night when they finally arived, after the sight seeing. They hadn&#39;t recieved any news on what was going on back hom so Mikkie had decided to call Sally. &quot;What&#39;s going on Sally?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not too much, it&#39;s just Luna, Snowy, Charlie, Raul, Maria, Luna and Lia are in New Orleans for another outbreak, no big change there, Outbreaks seem popular lately.&quot; Shi joked. &quot;But Maurice had siamese twins, Alpha and Centauri, named for the north star which fits perfectly. What they didn&#39;t notice was right at their backside, just above the tail is a star, but I&#39;ll let them figure that one out. Flake and Alexis went to Paris to conduct an investigation, Midnight and Talia went to Fee City to find more clues, while leaving Sammy and Gloria who.... Ah speak of the devils, they just walked in, they captured Li Sang, and there they go again, possibly to check on their eggs. A mother&#39;s job is never done.&quot; Shi giggled. &quot;As for the rest of us, I&#39;ve recently adopted a coyokat. And you two are going to love hir, shi&#39;s a sweet heart already. And that leaves Jess and Nikole, they are resting due to their pregnancies. I think they may come earlier, even though they are having one kit. Nikole suspects that it&#39;s shorter than Charlie&#39;s so she says it&#39;s possible shi and Jess both have triplets but I told them, when they want out, time means nothing, they&#39;ll get out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s true, I just can&#39;t wait until me and Danna have our first kits.&quot; Mikkie said. &quot;Well, we&#39;re doing well, and you were smart to tell us to take the other kits, they&#39;re pretty smart and fast learners.&quot; Shi giggled. &quot;Ryles is a great influence on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of Ryles, shi&#39;s got hirself a rattlekat for a mate, it&#39;s... my aunt. They are a wonderful pair, and Snowy&#39;s sister has moved in to help out, and perhaps to reunite with her daughter.&quot; Sally said then looked. &quot;Hey, Mikkie, I got to go, I think something&#39;s wrong with Jess and Nikole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, keep us updated.&quot; Mikkie smiled as hir and Sally hung up.<br />
<br />
Danna looked over from reading her fasion book. &quot;What is it, love?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh nothing big, just we&#39;re going to do this then I want to go home, all this travel is bugging my feet.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
Danna nodded. &quot;After our fashion show I think we could use a few years leasure time.&quot; Shi giggled and walked over to hug hir mate. &quot;Between the outbreaks and the this fashion show, we have been doing loads, haven&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikkie nodded. &quot;Yes we have. I mean we are going to overload if we&#39;re not too careful, but for now, we don&#39;t have our show until tomarrow night, don&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danna smiled. &quot;Nope. And Angel and Demon both are asleep already so why not we do the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two lovers lied down on the floor and curled up around each other and went to sleep.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Come late in the afternoon, Danna, Mikkie, Angel and Demon were ready to show their stuff. Mikkie had put on a blue dress with roses growing out of it, fortunately shi had the torns cut out or shi&#39;d be not only itchy, but hurting, Angel had decided to wear something with lillies on it, and Demon wore one shi hirself came up with, it was a cactus like, the thorns not there, just colored on. Danna loved it as shi wore her original design. &quot;You three ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mikkie smiled. &quot;Nervous but we&#39;ll cope.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, here we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, Tonight we have a special night for you. The debut of Danna Micheals and hir... is that right Tony? Ok, just checking... Forgive me folks, just checking what I thought was a typo, let me start again. &quot;The debute of Danna Micheals and hir clothing line made specifically for kats, now these kats are what came about in various outbreaks but have no fear these kats aren&#39;t sex crazed nor are they violent. But they sure are gorgeous.&quot; Danna smiled as shi walked up to the curtain. Shi was shaking like a leaf when shi saw big name fashion designers and poparazi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Danna, what&#39;s wrong love?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t do this, Mikkie, I simply can&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Danna, hun, I&#39;m here, just act like they&#39;re not. You did a practice fashion show back home, you can do this, love.&quot; Mikkie kissed Danna. &quot;Just go out there and be you. If they can&#39;t accept it, that&#39;s tough shit. It&#39;s your design, and it&#39;s the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danna nodded then thought. &quot;Okay.&quot; Danna smiled.<br />
<br />
Shi walked out there. &quot;Folks, we have Miss Micheals with hir first ever design, a vine vest. Purely made strait out of vines, shi used a new chemical to keep them from rotting and for kats like hirself, shi made it where it isn&#39;t irritation to the skin. And look at how shi moves. Shi certainly knows what shi has. And I must admit, this kat looks great.&quot; Danna smiled as they took pictures, even though she was a few weeks pregnant, shi didn&#39;t care that hir belly hung slightly low, but was happy. Shi started to walk back as Angel started in. &quot;And this is Angel, one of Miss Micheals&#39; models. Shi&#39;s wearing something... well, it&#39;s got lilly pedals all in it. And the fragrance from them is amazing.&quot; Angel swayed hir tail in a teasing way running it on a guys nose before walking back. &quot;Wow, an angel that&#39;s a tease.&quot; Demon was walking in once Angel passed, Demon looked around. &quot;And to go from Angel, we got Demon, shi&#39;s wearing what looks to be an outfit made from cacti plants. And I never thought cacti would be used as comfortable clothing, though it says here that the thorns have all been removed and the plants were sewn together masterfully, and it&#39;s vissible.&quot; <br />
<br />
Demon smiled walking back as Mikkie started out then shi saw something fly, Mikkie dove on Demon as a voice called. &quot;You like Kats, enjoy being one.&quot; Just then the item exploded into a gas, filling the room. <br />
<br />
Mikkie got up and grabbed demon and looked. &quot;Listen, don&#39;t breath the gas.&quot; She yelled. &quot;Get out and don&#39;t breath.&quot;<br />
<br />
Most the people paniced but those that didn&#39;t attempted to get out but got stuck. Just then the horror came to life before Mikkie&#39;s eyes. Danna was now going into tears as her debut was now ruined. Mikkie turned and walked back, grabbing Danna, Demon and Angel in toe. &quot;Look Danna, we got to bar all the exterior doors. Okay, then we got to get the athorities on the phone and get some vaccines here now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danna nodded. &quot;Right. But my show. It&#39;s ruined.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hun, I&#39;m sorry for that, I truely am. But we got to contain this before it gets out.&quot; Mikkie took Danna to an alley and started to bar the doors, on the otherside shi told security to do so but the security didn&#39;t listen, so they pushed them out of the way and barred the door. Mikkie the called the Russian police to get them to quarentine this area, then called Flakes phone which went to voicemail. &quot;Flake, Alexis, I know you two are busy, but you two are the closest, I and Danna need your help, get some vaccines and get to Moscow fast. We baracaded an outbreak in the fashion studio but the doors and windows can&#39;t hold... Danna get that door.&quot; Shi yelled. &quot;Look, we can try to hold them in but we need help now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shi hung up and went to help hir mate. &quot;Fucking asswhole.&quot; Shi rubbed hir head.</p>
