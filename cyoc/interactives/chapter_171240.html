<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He was so horny after the change that he started frequenting bars and coffee shops. He picked up a black hair woman, whose hair was real by her eyebrows. Named Stacey she was a 22 year old dental assistant. She had rack much like Megan&#39;s. Thinking of her got him hard, he went over to her and slowly engaged her in conversation. He gave his name as Ben Underwood.<br />
<br />
She was surprised by the way he had engaged her, working through the crowd of younger men who drooled over her. She had on a white silk kimono dress and heels. Stacey had loosened her dress showing the twin torpedoes of flesh that were her breasts. At least a D cup he didn&#39;t look at her breasts, that impressed her. He actually gave a shit about her as a person.<br />
<br />
After breaking up with her boyfriend she was horny and she gave him a card.<br />
<br />
&quot;Meet me in the men&#39;s toilet in five.&quot;<br />
<br />
The hastily scrawled message was sealed with a lipstick kiss above and below.<br />
<br />
He entered the toilet to find Stacey sitting on the counter. Her hair was down, she was wearing white stockings, a white lace bridal bustier (as Julia he had learnt it was called that because virgin brides wore first night with their husband) with matching panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready Mr Underwood?&quot; <br />
<br />
He had convinced her that he was a politician. <br />
<br />
&quot;More than you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t strength granted by his recent changes but an improvement with his confidence. He ripped her bustier off like it was made of wet tissue paper. Her panties were slipped off and smacked into the wall as he exposed his cocked and entered her as if he were wielding a knife with the lust of a man finally given something long denied to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;AH!&quot; she squealed.<br />
<br />
Chris kept his pace the same, fast and brutal like he was committing a murder than fucking a woman.  <br />
<br />
Stacey&#39;s tits bounced, jiggled and wobbled under the onslaught, one boob smacked her in the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;AH-UH-OH!&quot; she squealed even louder <br />
<br />
He was banging her so hard that she was sliding along the counter. But he grabbed her, all that could be seen over her were her stocking legs wrapped around his back and her hand scratching into business shirt. He sprayed inside her so hard she thought she was going to explode at first. People bragged about a gallon of cum but with this guy he must have had a backlog as if he had <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, fuck yes.&quot; she crooned.<br />
<br />
Her head thrown back she rode the rolla coaster that her orgasm. Finally after about a minute he started to spurt and splutter. It seemed like five hours but from start to finish it was five minutes. <br />
<br />
She started to pick up her clothes, her bustier was shredded and her panties were missing. They were in his pocket, they would join Belle&#39;s purple panties. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well Mr Underwood, that was an example of how to treat a girl. I won&#39;t be able to sit down for a week. Probably got me pregnant as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
He had a bad taste in his mouth, this girl couldn&#39;t be copied. She wasn&#39;t Megan who was one hundred percent natural. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your butt is oversized to look like Kim Kardashian, your breasts are silicone and silicone parts were made for toys and your lips looked like a swarm of bees had stung them. If you are pregnant then consider yourself lucky to have my DNA in your belly.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked as if he had slapped her. <br />
<br />
The Extractor, still done up as Ellen had used a bug that broadcast  and tracked Stacey&#39;s dress, Ellen couldn&#39;t hear all of it but enough. She was pissed off, something genetic, hormonal or egotistical had turned Chris dark. Out of the thirty one &#39;transitions&#39; the Extractor had done three men had gone off the rails like Chris had. It was like sending someone into handle blood, you didn&#39;t know their limits until you exposed them. Chris was loosing his head. <br />
<br />
Treatment A was embarrassment, if that didn&#39;t work then it was Treatment B death. She had had to do that in the early days to one client who was using his alternate form to seduce lesbians and then using his trigger to turn into his balding male self to rape women who weren&#39;t usually worried about protection. <br />
<br />
Chris was at a restaurant for work commitment when it was starting to get late. A stunning redhead came in and she seemed oddly familiar, how she stared at him. Her eyes were like autumn fire, the same color as her fiery red mane of hair. Something passed between them, something telepathic or some command. He knew he had to run to the bathroom, something was going to happen and he didn&#39;t want to be in public when it hit. He angled for the employee&#39;s bathroom. He ran past a balding waiter who thought the man (Chris) either had to go to the toilet or was about to die. The latter wasn&#39;t far from the truth.<br />
<br />
He leaned over the toilet in his grey suit with a black tie waiting for IT to happen. It didn&#39;t take long, with a suction like noise his penis and balls were gone. He unzipped his fly his jocks were flat against his smooth crotch. With every breath he took he felt his breasts swelling like water balloons pushing into the fabric of her shirt as the rest of her body became womanly she fell to the floor as her hand grew thinner and longer. <br />
<br />
Her hair was growing rapidly, overgrown one second to shoulder length and finally to that of a woman. Julia&#39;s rack pushed her men&#39;s business shirt out over her pants, which would lose if not for her widened hips. The waitress came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, ah Ms are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, the name Ms X, I wanted to try on Chris&#39; clothing. Don&#39;t you think I look sexy even in this? Huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
She grabbed his hands and ran them over her ass and onto her breasts that he squeezed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Long time for you as well? How about I give you what your wife never would if you keep this little episode secret and anything evidence?&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded mutely as she gave him a hand job through his pants. A limp jerk and he was staining his pants. <br />
<br />
She left the hall and ran into the red head wearing red open toed heels and an orange wrap front maxi dress that showed her legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Megan&quot; Julia sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;A person has a natural gait about them, whether they are in their body or their own. You figured it out good, your activities are threatening my business. You operate on a warning system this is an orange card, amber, yellow whatever. I give one warning, then it&#39;s the red card: you die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did nothing that was against the law and you lied about the capacity of alternative bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got &#39;Belle&#39; pregnant, most likely the girl Stacey. Your DNA will be that of your male self or worst case not fully formed. A hybrid of your DNA and Julia&#39;s, this resulted in a deformed fetus that forced me to kill the man seducing lesbian women. This (she indicate with her champagne glass) is to allow you to carry out travel that normally would not be allowed. Fuck it up and next step is death.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julia fell to the ground grovelling for mercy, she reached for her mentor and maker. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please I just lost myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ellen backed up, keeping her distance from the broken woman she helped to genetically engineer. Her right foot got tangled in one of Julia&#39;s hands. Only experience stopped her from falling over.<br />
<br />
With a swirl of her dress she left Julia on the floor. <br />
<br />
Julia got her hands on the tracker and tried to see if she could return the favor. As she got to her apartment she ran into her neighbor Amy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi&quot; she said hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi&quot; Julia repeated looking desperate in her man&#39;s shirt and tie, with ill fitting pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a key, Chris must trust you. I didn&#39;t know he has a girlfriend and why are you wearing his clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am from out of town and some hoods set fire to my clothes. I rang Chris and I have to make do, I am ah, how you say, exotic dancer so i am comfortable in my skin but this is not acceptable on the street.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Amy, would you like to go shopping tomorrow, we can pick up some essentials in the morning and I&#39;ll pay. I owe Chris and this is part of the debt repaid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will sleep on this.&quot;<br />
<br />
She just pulled on a silk kimono made of a blue fabric and Japanese cherry blossoms as her breasts rose and feel she slept on the floor in mix of vomit and vodka. Not usually a heavy drinker she had brought a bottle of vodka and a bottle of orange juice. Simple to make a screwdriver, she wanted blasted on the sauce. She drank three screwdrivers and then just vodka she collapsed into a mix of vomit and vodka. <br />
<br />
The next morning she was back to normal Chris. The kimono was tight around his male body, he saw his reflection in the coffee pot seeing stubble he laughed like a madman. His phone also showed where the Extractor had put her heels from last night. Contrary to Chris&#39; belief he was a DC local.  <br />
<br />
Chris wanted to see what secrets the Extractor was yet to reveal to Chris. He would become the Extractor and he would dominate the business that bitch setup. He would have full control over his body and extend the range and power of splicing their DNA with women.</p>
