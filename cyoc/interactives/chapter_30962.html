<p>“Lisa…er, what the hell are you doing?”  She stroked Solange’s shoulder reassuringly.  “Don’t worry Solange, I’m just…let us say…increasing our options.”</p>

<p>“Merde,” she spat.  Solange would be perfectly happy to increase the loup-garou legions, but she’d prefer to keep it voluntary.  “Lisa, isn’t the rationale you gave Blackhorn the same one where you ordered Brenda and Sharon to gift Rachel and Katie?”</p>

<p>“That’s still an option I have with ALL our children Solange, so don’t push it,” she replied evenly.  Yes, I was stressed out when we thought Wendy had been killed, but with the actions of Ramer, with Sharon almost getting killed, I’m thinking we can’t depend on the government for security.  We NEED to increase our numbers!”</p>

<p>Debra chimed in.  “I agree, babe, we do need more like us…but honestly Lisa, is this the best way to do it?  Say one person in a family of four finds out our secret…”</p>

<p>Lisa interrupted.  “I know where you are going with this, Deb.  If we do nothing, we MAY just have one person knowing our secret but if we gift the whole family, all four of them know.  My reasoning is that he will tell his family anyway and there is nothing to stop them from passing on the knowledge.  That being the case, we’ll just gift all four of them and save us the stress and trouble.”</p>

<p>Solange swallowed hard, knowing that she didn’t want to anger her Alpha, but she had to clarify things.  “Gift them?  Lisa, you know they will consider it a curse!”</p>

<p>Lisa nodded.  “They’ll accept it in time, in time they will thank us for it.”</p>

<p>Debra rushed to clear the tension.  “OK, well for now it’s a moot point…nobody we know knows about the gift that isn’t supposed to know, you know?”</p>

<hr>

<p>“Dita, are you SURE you want to do this?”</p>

<p>“I told you Heather, we need to let my mother know these things.”</p>

<p>“Deet, c’mon babe it’s just Terry!  He promised that he’d keep his mouth shut.”   Dita rolled her eyes at the girl’s naiveté.  “Heather, you and I and Rachel all know that once Terry gets a few pints in him he’ll be telling everyone in Dublin.”</p>

<p>Rachel spoke out, “and they will assume he’s another Yank nutter who’s read too many stories ‘bout the little people.  And then he will go back to Indiana where the drinking age is a respectable twenty-one”</p>

<p>All three cracked up at the last sentence.  “Guys I gotta tell Mom,” concluded Dita with a tone of finality.  She picked up the receiver and dialed...”</p>

<hr>

<p>Debra was kneading Lisa’s back seductively, smelling the aroma of her well-conditioned fiery locks, the one feature Dita hadn’t inherited from her mother.</p>

<p>“Yeah, John looks exactly like Sam Elliot.  And Anaya looks like Angelina Jolie…well…at least from a few years ago.”</p>

<p>Solange squeezed Debra slowly, her hands caressing her breasts.  “Lindsey Lohan could play Rachel.”</p>

<p>Lisa rolled over sniggering.  “God, that kid had issues…no no babe…Brenda, honey I mean LINDSEY has issues…not your kid!”   She proclaimed this to the ceiling.</p>

<p>Solange and Debra joined her on either side and Lisa embraced them both.  Debra ran her hand lovingly over her friend’s body, gently tracing five lines starting in her brilliant red hair, down her ivory face and neck, teasing her firm breast and pink nipples, running down her pale torso unmarred except for a pink spot a couple of inches under each breast, down into the forest fire just under her navel and continuing to the moist center.</p>

<p>Lisa moaned.  The phone rang.  Damn it.</p>

<p>Lisa groaned, but Solange was kind enough to hand her the cell phone.</p>

<p>“Hello?”</p>

<p>“Mom, hi it’s me.”  Lisa grinned.  “It’s our girls,” she whispered to her friends.  “Hi, baby, how are you?”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s hesitation.  “Well, I’m okay…were all okay.”</p>

<p>“And where are you?”</p>
<p>“We’re in Wexford, we went to the crystal factory…and tomorrow we’re gonna let Rachel kick our tails on the golf course.”</p>

<p>Lisa laughed at this.  “Well after the seventh, you won’t have to worry about your long game.”</p>

<p>“Mom, did you know that Terry Cramer was going to Ireland with his band the same time we did?</p> 

<p>Lisa’s forehead wrinkled.  Terry Cramer lived just down the street with his father and little sister Tina.  Sean Cramer was a divorced electrician.”</p>

<p>“No, Deet, I had no idea.  Did you run into each other?”</p>

<p>Dita sighed.  “Mom, we’d been talking…well slightly arguing would be more accurate.  Heather is really scared about the whole thing you know.  I am too, kinda.  Anyway while we were ‘discussing’ this, Terry had been further up front, practicing his drumming.  Apparently he’d knocked off a ventilation cover…and the 330’s ventilation system amplified it enough so he could hear…”</p>

<p>Lisa stood up, her mind racing.  “Do you know what he knows?”</p>

<p>“Mom, the jackass tried to play Sherlock Holmes and followed us to Galway.  There, Inspector Clouseau compounded his boo-boo by sleeping with the barmaid who just happened to be possessed by a demon who tore up his arm pretty badly.  The upshot is that he knows all about us.”</p>

<p>Lisa closed her eyes, shaking her head.  “All right honey, thank you for telling me this.  Did Terry tell you when he was going back?”</p>

<p>“I think he said a month, but don’t remember exactly.”</p>

<p>“Okay, well again thanks for letting me know.”</p>

<p>“So Mom, are you going to join us in Ireland for you know what?”</p>

<p>Lisa hesitated.  Yeah…they WERE going to do that.  “I’m afraid not honey, we have a number of things to get done.  Have you decided where you’ll go?”</p>

<p>“West Ireland for sure, not so for sure on the exact location.”</p>
<p>“Well for God’s sake be careful, its pretty cliffy out there.”
“Okay Mom…love you!”</p>

<p>Lisa turned to her friends with a sigh as she clicked the phone shut.</p>

<p>“Terry Cramer knows about us.”</p>

<p>October 4th, 2006  Washington D.C</p>

<p>George looked over the papers again.  Looked like a good bill, it would give some relief to Rwanda, assuming the government didn’t skim off most of it.  Of course that was a dangerous assumption, all too often “American Aid” wound up in the pockets of thugs and warlords.</p>

<p>“Mister President, a Mister John Blackhorn on the line for you.”</p>

<p>George forgot about the bill, it could wait.</p>

<p>“Yeah, Johnny buddy, what’s happening?”</p>

<p>“Afternoon, Mister President.  Busy day as usual I take it?”</p>

<p>“As usual.  But I’m taking Laura and Jenna out to dinner tonight…fundraiser or course.  Not like it’ll do any good, you and I know we’re getting our asses kicked in about a month.  Anyway, what for can I do ya?”</p>

<p>Blackhorn chuckled.  “You know, it’s nothing too serious.  I just met with three members of our Evansville coven, the ones that dealt with that Ramer idiot.  Lisa Singer has a daughter who will feel the effects on the seventh.  The thing is George, Dita is one real sharp kid, and she’s hoping to enter the Air Force Academy this coming summer.”</p>

<p>“No kidding?  Does she know what she wants to do if she’s commissioned?”</p>
<p>“She’s a pilot sir.  With the reflexes she will have, it’d be a shame not to give her an F-15, she could probably pop anything that came near her.”</p>

<p>George smiled at this.  The time he spent in the cockpit of an F-102 was golden.  Yet still… “Johnny, you and I both know that I can’t help her get the appointment, she will have to get in on her own merits.  But yeah…yeah we can make sure that she can be away from the fun three nights out of every month.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Cork, Ireland   October 6, 2006</p>

<p>Typically the weather in Ireland during the fall and spring tends to rainfall, lots of it.  That was one of the reasons that Dita had held off on doing this.</p>

<p>“Good morning to you.  And how can I help you?”</p>

<p>“We were hoping to borrow a 172 and an instructor for a couple of hours…I just have fourteen myself, and we were hoping to take a look around from the air.”</p>

<p>“Why certainly.  American student pilots are you?”</p>

<p>“Just myself, said Dita.  Heather and Rachel are along for the ride.”</p>

<p>Although Dita had done this both to get a few extra hours of flight time in and to give Heather’s spirits a lift, the truth was that the worry she felt now was unbearable.  As the plane lifted off the runway, guided easily by Dita’s delicate touch, Heather’s stomach churned uncomfortably from the adrenaline of painful anticipation.</p>

<p>Would this be her last day as a human being?</p>

<p>As the sun hit the broad windows of the Cessna, Heather saw her reflection in the mirror.  She smiled weakly at the sight, God really did make me a beautiful girl, she thought thankfully, her smile forming cute dimples on both cheeks, each slightly freckled.  Her hair was thick and almost black, curly and long, flowing down the middle of her back, her bangs covering her forehead and her luxuriant eyebrows.</p>

<p>And tomorrow evening, it might be the face of a monster.</p>

<p>And the night after that.</p>

<p>And the night after that.</p>

<p>Kevin, the instructor, was impressed by Dita’s expert handling of the aircraft, her movements smooth and efficient, and her eyes rapidly alternating between checking the instrument panel, checking for air traffic, and simply enjoying the emerald tapestry beneath her.</p>

<p>Every minute that passes, thought Heather, another minute closer to that reckoning.  What would happen?  Her mind wandered over the events of the past few weeks, finding the DVD, confronting her mother, sobbing, Wendy being shot, the flight across the ocean, Terry, the hospital, golf with Rachel and now floating on a cushion of air piloted by her first and greatest friend.</p>

<p>Dita contacted the tower for a full stop landing.  Though normally there would be a series of touch and goes, this time they were pretty much up for fun, not training.  Dita entered the pattern behind a Beechcraft Bonanza, lowering the flaps slightly when the airspeed indicator hit the white line.</p>

<p>“Cessna Alpha Yankee Bravo, cleared to land runway 25.”</p>
<p>“Cleared to land 25, Alpha Yankee Bravo, thanks,” replied Dita crisply</p>

<p>The little aircraft descended, Dita maintaining the centerline and approach speed.  Just as the Cessna crossed the numbers, Dita gradually pulled the yoke back, reducing speed.  It settled gently on the runway.</p>

<p>“Nicely done, Dita,” complimented Kevin.</p>

<p>Dita raised the flaps as they turned onto the taxiway to general aviation.</p>

<p>“Miss Singer, that is some of the best flying I’ve seen in a while.  I’d say one more flight with your regular instructor and you’ll be ready to solo.”</p>
<hr>


<p>Cork, Ireland.  Ten in the evening October 6, 2006</p>

<p>They were watching television.  Or rather the TV was on, but nobody was paying much attention to it.</p>

<p>Rachel had given up the ghost, zonked out on the other bed, purring quietly.</p>

<p>Dita and Heather snuggled together with Dita gently scratching Heather’s back.</p>

<p>“That feels so good Dita,” Heather murmured.  “I like doing it.  Babe, how’re you feeling?” Heather whimpered.
“Dita, I’m scared.  I’m so scared!  I dunno what will happen tomorrow night.”  Dita held her tightly savoring the smaller girl’s warmth.</p>
<p>“Heather, don’t worry.  I know.  Tomorrow night…you are going to change.  Shhh…easy babe…easy.” Dita felt Heather’s body shudder with sobs.  Sheesh, get a grip girl, thought Dita.  “Tomorrow at this time you will be a werewolf.  And you’ll be just fine.”</p>
<p>“No,” moaned Heather plaintively.  “Hold me.” </p>

<p>Dita held Heather, loving and concerned for her friend.</p>

<p>“Let me take this off,” she whispered.  Dita stood up, unbuttoning her nightgown and letting it fall to the floor.  Heather turned to face her with teary eyes, gasping.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i> I’ll hold you.”</p>

<p>Heather’s mind reeled as Dita crawled back into bed fully naked and turned to face her.  She’d seen Dita topless before, showing off her breasts, about a c-cup she thought, but never completely nude.</p>

<p>Heather went all tingly in her secret place as Dita pressed her body against her.  Dita kissed her gently, her tongue teasing, probing.</p>

<p>“Dita…er, what the hell are you doing?”   

<p>“Touch me Heather,” Dita guided Heather’s hand to her vagina.  Heather gasped as she felt the moist warmth and the few wispy hairs.  She gently inserted her finger, teasing, caring…</p>

<p>“Oh God chica, that’s good!”  Dita groaned as her body trembled.  What am I doing, thought Heather</p>

<p>“Take your clothes off, Heather,” Dita reached over and began pulling her T-shirt up.  Heather resisted at first, and then reluctantly submitted under Dita’s quizzical gaze.  Dita swallowed hard at Heather’s heavy breasts that somehow fit comfortably on her small frame.  Dita reached over in a hug to undo Heather’s bra…and felt dense stubble under her arms.</p>

<p>“Not shaving so much anymore?”</p>

<p>Heather gave a wan smile.  “It’s just been growing back faster.”</p>

<p>The two girls caressed each others breasts, their hearts pounding.  Dita pulled down her friends shorts.  She gasped at the sight. </p> 

<p>“Oh…Heather…all that hair!”  She plunged her hand into the black mass, probing to Heather's vagina.</p>

<p>Later, the two fell into a deep sleep in each other’s arms.</p></p>
