<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You remembered plenty of stories about your half-brother Puck. One of the most infamous ones was how he once changed a man’s head to that of a donkey, and had another fairy named Titania fall hopelessly in love with him.  It was one of your favorites; there was something so appealing about tricking people into behaving differently than they normally do, all while changing their bodies into something else.<br />
<br />
You thought maybe you could take it even further than that. Looking at the family at the table, you made your decision. With a flick of the wand, you cast your fairy magic on the unsuspecting family, and the changes began. <br />
<br />
First, the family’s clothes all vanished, leaving them completely naked at the dinner table. For a quick few seconds, the family members looked at themselves and each other with shocked expressions, but you quickly cast another spell to make them find this pretty normal. <br />
<br />
As the family continued their dinner like nothing significant has happened, the family member’s ears lengthened, and shifted to the top of their heads. Behind each of their rears, their tailbones stretched painlessly against the skin above their rears, and they quickly lengthened into skin-toned tails that immediately began growing same-colored hair as their heads. Patches of brown-grey fur began appearing around their skin, and crept over their bodies like moss.<br />
<br />
While this went on, each member of the family went through their own unique changes. The husband, Daniel, lost much of his well-built musculature as his body became more slender, and his head and facial features shifted into something more effeminate. As Daniel’s brown hair lengthened down to his shoulders, his bottom swelled into a perkier shape as his fully formed tail waved about, and his chest pushed out into two impressively sized female breasts; larger than even his wife’s. Under the table, Daniel’s maleness shrank in size, and morphed into a dark colored female vagina. The former husband, now thinking of herself as Daniella, gave out a woman-like moan at the feeling of her old privates being sucked up her body, but she continued to eat like nothing was wrong. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, her wife Mary was going through something different. As her ears lengthened to those of a donkey, Mary found herself getting closer and closer to the table as her height rapidly shrank. Her breasts shrank until she was left with an utterly flat chest, and her hair shrank into a more boyish cut. Between her legs, the wife’s clitoris swelled and push out of her slit, swelling into the spotted head of a male donkey penis. Her vagina stretched with her new extending rod, and became its new sheath while a set of donkey testicles grew underneath. Eventually Mary, now Mark, settled into the form of a 13 year old donkey boy, and he casually picked up his cup of water with his teenage hands as his new hormones pushed his equine penis into an erection.<br />
<br />
Across the table, the youngest daughter Tiffany was going through similar changes as her former mother. While the 14 year old was casually scooping up food with a fork, her other hand was feeling around her own new donkey cock and balls, which seemed to be growing larger than even Mark’s. Also unlike Mark, Tiffany was growing larger and taller, and Tiffany unconsciously scooted his chair backwards to make room for her growing body. Her budding breasts (not too significant to begin with) receded into her chest into soft male pecs, while her hair shortened just like her former mother’s, except looking more like a donkey’s Mohawk-like mane. <br />
It was at this point that on each family member’s hands, their five fingers began merging together into three, black-nailed appendages. Their new hands looked like a mix between a hand and a donkey fore-hoof. Finding it a bit harder to hold his fork, Timothy, the new father of the family, put his fork down and resorted to bending his head down to his plate. He let out a few some deep sounding grunts as he munched on a pile of mashed potatoes.<br />
<br />
The rest of the family began doing the same. Sitting next to Timothy, who had finished growing to an adult height similar to his now-wife Daniella, 17 year old Kelly put down her spoon and started casually licking up some peas right from her plate. This proved a little harder to do as Kelly’s body was shrinking down furthest than even her mother-turned-brother, forcing Kelly to stand up from her chair as she shrank all the way down to the height of an 8 year old child. Her legs and feet, along with those of her family, had morphed into the shape of donkey hind legs, but it was still somehow easy to stand upright. <br />
Thing did get a little easier for Kelly, as the lower part of her face started pushing out into a small donkey’s snout. Around the table, the rest of Kelly’s family was growing snouts as well, complete with black-tipped noses, longer donkey tongues, and a whisker like fuzz around their darkened lips. Though Kelly’s new vagina did take on a blacker color, they still remained very much female, albeit in a more fitting size for a little donkey girl. <br />
<br />
The grey fur had completely spread all over the family’s bodies, leaving the entire family as anthropomorphic donkeys. The family finished up their dinner in their new bodies and personalities, with their donkey tails waving about behind their seats. Grinning, you lean back in midair, and take a nice moment to watch this new family dynamic play out.</p>
