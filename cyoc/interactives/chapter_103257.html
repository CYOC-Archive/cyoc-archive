<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Guy woke up alone in Cray&#39;s apartment. His body sore from a long night of eating and having sex with Cray, was now resting atop of what was left of Cray&#39;s bed. The massive bulk of fat accumulated because of Cray&#39;s actions was heavy to carry, his breathing was heavy and he just wanted to stay still because everything felt like too much of an effort. Feeling his limbs cramping, he moved them every now and then. It was hard for him to believe that in such a small amount of time his body had become so large. Soft, pudgy limbs, he wanted to see himself in the mirror, but the idea of getting up was tiring by itself. He laid on the floor, starring at the ceiling. <br />
He wondered why Cray left all of a sudden, while feeling beads of sweat covering his naked, fat and pale body. Ever more so he felt hotter, heaving. He tried fanning himself, and rolling to the sides. Seeing if he could make himself more comfortable. He felt the remains of Cray&#39;s bed cracking under his weight, as he succeeded in being face down, but realised that it wasn&#39;t the best position to be in for his current body. Taking his time he rolled back up and decided to try to hoist himself up again, since he wanted to at least stand for a moment.<br />
<br />
He noticed that one of the bed posts was still standing firmly, for some reason, and decided to use it as leverage. Successfully getting up. He was now sweatier than before, which he accredited to the effort it took to get up. <br />
<br />
Waddling over to a full length mirror he saw the damage that Cray had done. Obviously, looking like a different person. He tried to lift his apron like belly to see his dick, which was a task all in itself, only to realise he had yet another flab to lift. The effort started to make him sweat more, but he persisted. The felt his dick getting harder though and noticed the head peeking out a bit. &quot;There he is!&quot; he said aloud, and immediately realising that it was once a 10 inch thick rod which he had to manoeuvre made him sad. He let go, of it, breathing hard and deep, sweating more and more. Puddles of sweat forming at his feet, as his naked body felt hot. He started to feel strangely aroused, noticing something strange in front of him.<br />
<br />
As his heart raced, and his dick hardened he noticed that his massive apron like belly started to shrink. His blubbery thighs and tits as well. Moaning, he rubbed the sides of his still massive belly, which was very sweaty as more and more sweat dropped on the floor. As more sweat accumulated on the floor, more of his flab started to disappear. He started feeling really thirsty so he went to the bathroom to get himself some water. Waddling over wasn&#39;t as difficult as his thighs didn&#39;t rub as hard. He had trouble reaching the bathroom sink so he grabbed his gut and laid it on top of it to reach the glass and faucet. Filling glass after glass of water he chugged and chugged, making his belly more and more firm... However, he kept sweating. His bloated belly looking firmer, he noticed how he probably had lost about 30 lbs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit... No it can&#39;t be&quot; Cray had mentioned that there wasn&#39;t any turning back when he made him this way. Yet at the same time, his heart racing, and his hormones jumping, he realised he was losing the fat he had easily gained.<br />
<br />
Stepping back, his bloated belly was no longer flopped atop the sink. Instead it now stood above it. He felt his fast racing faster as more and more sweat ran down every part of his body. He was now able to see the pubic fat covering less of his dick, and his dick getting harder and harder. He arched his back and grabbed the bathroom counter. He felt really hard has his dick started to grow little by little: 2.5, 3, 3.5, then faster, 4, 5, 6, feeling the head poking at the flab that hung as he was leaning. Moaning he felt it growing more: 7, 8, 9, 10 inches of blood engorged penis. He wanted to reach it, but was busy grabbing onto the counter, so he started to thrust his pelvis to see if the fat would rub it so he could release.  More and more sweat dropped on the floor, he was blushing and squinted. He looked up and noticed that he looked less fat than before. Easily less that 700 pounds for sure. He heaved and attempted to grab his penis again, he was almost reaching when he felt his whole body becoming increasing sore. <br />
<br />
The soreness was familiar, just like he had worked out his whole body just then and there, as he stood up he noticed how his flabby arms started looking fuller, and his chest didn&#39;t sag as much. He quickly waddled over to the full size mirror for a better look, but he struggled as he felt his legs feeling extra sore. As he reached the mirror he noticed his build becoming more and more muscular, and soon he started to drip pre-cum. Arms getting thicker, more muscular, pecs getting square and thick. Lats, traps and shoulders popping out more. The added bulk had made him look like a powerlifter, finally. His thighs were monstrous, and thick, and little by little the separation of his quads was visible, which made him extra hard. The sheer mass was impressive as he turned side ways and noticed how his ass was getting rounder and his calves and hams were more and more developed. He turned in front of the mirror again and did a lat spread, feeling his sore muscles growing more and more. He probably was around 400 lbs of chunky muscle. He smiled as he felt his rock hard dick throbbing, point upwards more as half the pubic fat had disappeared allowing his cock to bend upward a bit.  <br />
<br />
The soreness stopped as the sweating continued. Now Guy was able to reach his cock. His belly was less immense, but impressive still. His heart kept beating faster as he moaned. The pleasure intensified he started to panic, he didn&#39;t want to cum in front of the mirror so he rushed back into the bathroom. His body could move easier now because of the muscle he recovered, as his balls were pushed up by his massive quads he realised how good it felt to have the muscularity he had again. He quickly tried to get in the shower, but had to pause as more fat shed itself off as sweat he began to feel his dick throbbing harder. &quot;FUCK!&quot; he thought as he was at the very edge. Quickly opening the door he entered the shower. His body felt so hot, as he saw the glass doors starting to fog. He quickly ran the cold water on himself and didn&#39;t feel anything, he leaned his massive back agains the wall, and started rubbing one off. As he stroked he felt his belly getting smaller, and smaller, as his arms struggled less to get around it. The heads of the triceps began to be more visible and on his meaty forearms veins started to pop up as he stroked his thick 10 inch cock. Closer and closer to cumming, the head became red as his double chin started to recede. Rolls of fat soon disappearing, Guy&#39;s conditioning improved. As he stroked the contraction of his pecs was becoming evident as the ointment started to wear off, giving him a more off season physique. He wanted to edge some more as more steam accumulated due to the cold water hitting his warm body. The rolls of fat were almost gone as he was able to see his throbbing cock more. No more pubic padding was left and the outline of his abs became visible, luv handles started to fade, he was getting closer to his former shape.<br />
<br />
Loud moans came out of him, he bit his lips... The edging was almost over as his muscles were now visible clearly, his abs contracted, his pecs flexed as felt he was over the edge. Thick cum shot out to his chin, once, twice, three times, he kept stroking as he felt his nuts were still full and a second, more powerful orgasm came about. His wad thicker, shot to his face, landing on his top lip as the water rinsed it away. His abs went into full contraction as the third and final orgasm came, this time his dick shot up only to his thick pecs, as he sighed in relief. <br />
<br />
Water started to feel cold now, his body started to cool off. He decided to wash up then and there. Remembering about the prior night, while he soaped up he then was terrified at the idea of meeting Cray in the apartment again. He rushed out of the shower. Looking at his image in the mirror in relief. He wasn&#39;t as big as his powerlifter iteration but his muscularity was what it used to be and he was happy about it. <br />
<br />
He quickly went through Crays drawer picking up some things to wear as he dressed up all wet from the shower, he noticed his shoes and gymbag and immediately picked up his stuff and took off, taking the stairs to avoid running into Cray in the elevator. He didn&#39;t want to take any chances. <br />
<br />
Leaving unnoticed, he reached his apartment as fast as he could. As he was unpacking he saw missed calls and texts from Clark. Soon thereafter he reached out to him.</p>
