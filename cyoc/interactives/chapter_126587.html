<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sean pouted as he walked back home. He glared back at Mitch&#39;s house. He was supposed to have gotten paid today, not tomorrow! That&#39;s so not fair! And the way Mitch&#39;s friend just yanked Reginald inside the house was so awful! Those bullies need to be taken down a peg.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish they could get yanked around like that,&quot; Sean muttered bitterly as he walked inside his house. &quot;Maybe then they&#39;ll learn how to be nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––<br />
&quot;I bet your dog would be able to make excellent puppies, Mitch,&quot; Kevin said, still not looking away from Reginald. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind having some.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Having some of Reg&#39;s puppies?&quot; Mitch asked, surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like some, too,&quot; Tom announced. &quot;I bet their fur would be so nice and radiant like his.&quot; Mitch felt something inside him. He agreed with the mentality, of wanting Reg&#39;s puppies. But Mitch could feel that there was something more to that notion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;d like Reg&#39;s puppies, too,&quot; Drew replied. He started breathing heavily. &quot;I want as many as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, Kevin whirled around to look at Drew pointedly, and said, &quot;Only if you plan on splitting the money you make off of them.&quot; Confusion crossed his face. It was like that idea seemed wrong somehow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to sell them,&quot; Drew stated. He began sensuously rubbing his chest with one hand. &quot;I want his puppies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s my dog,&quot; Mitch said. He stood up defiantly. &quot;I want his puppies.&quot; The feeling now overwhelmed Mitch, and he couldn&#39;t deny it any longer. He yanked his pants down, revealing his tail. The pheromones he had been secreting now really caught Reginald&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...have a tail, Mitch?&quot; Kevin asked. Tom and Drew had not moved their eyes off of Reginald, but their hands moved to their stiff erections. Even Kevin began massaging his crotch. Mitch didn&#39;t answer. He turned around, knelt on the ground, and lifted his tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reg, come!&quot; Mitch yelled. Reginald didn&#39;t need any additional goading. His instincts had kicked in and went to Mitch rather quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Tom moaned as Reginald began to climb up Mitch&#39;s backside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Reg,&quot; Mitch moaned. He felt Reginald&#39;s dick slide inside him. He felt like he was in heaven. &quot;Give me your puppies, Reg. Make me your bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man!&quot; Drew groaned on the couch. He was unbuttoning his belt. Kevin noticed that movement. Drew began jacking off his cock as Reginald began mating with Mitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; Kevin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to be Reg&#39;s bitch,&quot; Drew complained. &quot;I wanted him to fuck me so badly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, fuck yeah!&quot; Mitch yelped, as if on cue.<br />
<br />
Kevin stared at Drew&#39;s dick and growled, &quot;Take your pants off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Drew asked, confused. His hand didn&#39;t leave his dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to be a bitch? I&#39;ll make you into a bitch.&quot; Kevin stood up and practically tore his clothes off. His dick was pulsing with arousal. &quot;You&#39;re going to be my bitch.&quot; With that, he practically pounced onto Drew. As soon as Drew&#39;s ass was exposed, Kevin slammed his dick inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, fuck!&quot; Drew yelped.<br />
<br />
&quot;No talking, bitch!&quot; Kevin growled as he pounded away. He stuffed one of his socks in Drew&#39;s open mouth. He glanced back at a stripping and jacking Tom. &quot;Get over here, bitch!&quot; Kevin barked. &quot;Lap away at this bitch&#39;s bone!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woof!&quot; Tom fake-barked. He crawled over on all fours towards Drew&#39;s dick and began licking it.<br />
<br />
Mitch meanwhile had his tongue out of his mouth. He was panting and whimpering. The changes in his body seemed to spread as Reg continued. He felt his face begin to push out into a muzzle. His tongue was getting larger and longer as he panted. His ears were moving to the top of his head. At the same time, Reginald had been licking Mitch&#39;s back. For some reason, he felt Reginald&#39;s dick begin to swell even further and could reach deeper inside his pussy. The pleasure intensified while he failed to notice the increase in weight on his back. At the same time, he failed to notice that Reginald was not so much as licking his back as he was kissing his back. A part of Mitch seemed to notice when fingers interlapped with his. He glanced back. Through the lusty haze he was in, he found an anthropomorphic Collie on top of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reginald?&quot; Mitch whimpered. He felt the cock in his pussy thrust even deeper and threw his head back in pleasure.<br />
<br />
A deep, masculine voice rumbled in his ear, &quot;Call me, Alpha.&quot; Alpha&#39;s snout began kissing the side of Mitch&#39;s distended face. Alpha&#39;s snout shortened while Mitch&#39;s lengthened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, bitch,&quot; Kevin barked. &quot;Take it, bitch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woof! Arooo!&quot; Tom bellowed. Drew could only whimper as he tried to howl as well.<br />
<br />
Kevin looked over to Reginald and Mitch. In place of Mitch was a whimpering anthropomorphic dog getting royally fucked by a handsome, sturdy, muscular man. Kevin came as he stared at the two, only grunting as he did so. He unceremoniously pulled out of Drew. He grabbed Drew and yanked him over to Tom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finish each other off!&quot; he ordered. &quot;I have more important things to focus on.&quot; He walked the short distance to the large hunk. The hunk stopped fucking the anthro dog that was Mitch and stared at Kevin. &quot;You can make use of yourself in a better way with me than with this bitch.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man chuckled and pulled out of Mitch, who whimpered. He stood up to his full height, a good five inches taller than Kevin. His chest was thick and had a pelt of light brown hair faintly covering his pecs. The man&#39;s crisp and angular face was similarly covered in the same color hair. That hair was rapidly thinning out. He was beefy and thick. His dick was massive and throbbing. Kevin liked the looks of it. He knew where that thing belonged. The man looked like a 30-something-year-old pro powerlifter. The amount of muscle and fat on the man made Kevin&#39;s dick rise back up, ready for another round already.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look like those other two bitches,&quot; the man&#39;s rich baritone voice chuckled. If Kevin&#39;s dick could get any harder, it did just then. &quot;I don&#39;t think you could handle me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin didn&#39;t say anything. Instead, he responded by pushing the man to the ground. He didn&#39;t know where the strength came from but somehow managed to do it. &quot;We&#39;ll see about that.&quot; He unceremoniously sat his ass straight onto the man&#39;s dick. He slowly eased it in, enjoying the sensation before starting to bounce on it. He closed his eyes and enjoyed the sensations. Unbeknownst to him, his body was rapidly swelling with muscle. His once tight and trim jock frame now ballooned with powerful muscles. His gut pushed out in front of him forming a nice firm belly for his rapidly expanding and thickening pecs to rest on. His thighs and calves bulges and swelled. A beard began to grow on his face, similar in color to the man whose dick he was riding. He felt something push out just above his ass. His sense of smell seemed to explode. The scents coming off of the man drove Kevin insane. He reached down and grabbed the man&#39;s head with both of his now meaty and burly hands. Their lips met, and their tongues wrestled. The man&#39;s scent reached all the way into Kevin&#39;s brain. The man was his Alpha. And Kevin was Beta. The pleasure intensified, and Beta lost track of everything around him except for Alpha beneath him. Finally, Alpha grunted and broke their kiss. He began to howl as Beta felt the cum rushing into his ass. Beta orgasmed again and howled. The heat in the entire room intensified as Mitch, Drew, and Tom all orgasmed together, also howling with their Alpha.</p>
