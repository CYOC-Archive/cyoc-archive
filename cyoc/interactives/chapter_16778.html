<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Already that very evening as Marvin sat in a comfortable room in the upastairs of the main house, he had laid out on the bed several books and folders given him by the Professor. Reading them all over for the second time Marvin was feeling pretty good that this was a job, and his future all rolled up in one package.<br />
<br />
He was ready too for bed and standing in the bathroom took the five pills required by the Professor for maintaining his health while working around Hogs. It was earlier that afternoon the Professor had injected Marvin with other drugs. He was told these like the pills would help him ward off diseases common to hogs. <br />
<br />
A gulp and down they went as marvin, a happy and proud young man snuggled down for a good night's sleep.<br />
<br />
The morning began early as Marv stood shaving his face in the bathroom. He was soon down to a big breakfast and introduced to several others who were working on differing projects. As he ate he did notice the eyes of the others there were watching him in a sly sort of manner.<br />
<br />
This did not slow him down as he went directly out to Barn Nine and there met the Hog driving manager, named Pete. Soon he was doing what he'd learned that one long hot stinking summer as he squirted down the messy hog pens.<br />
<br />
Lunch did not come too soon and with it came a small package of pills again. they reminded him of those he took the night before and doing as asked he took these too.<br />
<br />
A long farming day of hard back breaking work had him tired and ready for to get into bed quite early. Asleep at eight O'clock he was soundly out as the Professor crept into the room.<br />
<br />
One large syringe filled with his blue extract was injected into the sleeping youth's neck. A chuckle, and he backed out of the room knowing that come morning Marvin was in for a surprise.<br />
<br />
Marv slept past his alarm and awoke around nine in the morning. He bolted from bed and went to shower and ready himself for work. It was as he peered into his reflection in the bathroom mirror that he saw the beginnings of his true station of employment.<br />
<br />
There peering back at him was his face now seemingly more rounded with puffy cheaks, and squinting eyes. His whiskers which were normally light and not of much growth, were instead quite long and very scratchy to the feel. even as he shaved that morning his facial skin felt tougher to the touch. It was his ears that bothered him the most as they seemed to be larger than what he remembered.<br />
<br />
The morning breakfast had again a number of those there making quick eye contact and then looked away as if not wishing to be friendly.<br />
<br />
His second day on the farm was soon being part of a boar and sow mating ritual. He knew of some of their oddities in mating but ended up spending the entire day watching hogs mate.<br />
<br />
Tired out and very sweaty Marv retired again ealry and this time went even without his supper.<br />
<br />
Sleeping and dreaming of his day in the sun, Marv was again quite out as the Professor snuck in for Marvin's last injection.<br />
<br />
Six O'clock in the morning had Marvin on the phone and calling the Professor. a worried young man had seen his face in the morning mirror and was shocked to say the least. He accounted what he saw to the listening Professor. He was talking a blue streak when mixed with his wording of what he saw came a snorting sound.<br />
<br />
A well mannered young man, Marvin excused his bad manners and the snorting sound while he continued to explain his facial contortions.<br />
<br />
It was when he looked into the mirror that those eye slits peered through a puffy face at a turned up snout. His entire nose was twisted upward making it look very much like one piggy's big snout.<br />
<br />
Worse yet was the feel of his face and skin now coated thickly with long coarse bristles as he knew grew on hogs. Marvin was almost crying to explain his physical changes and when he got to the lower extremities and what happened there his voice changed.<br />
<br />
Straining to tell of his much larger testicles and the shape of his manhood, Marvin's voice cracked and he began to snort and squeal like a hog.<br />
<br />
Terror, embarressment, Marvin tried time and time agian to speak his words correctly but with every try came those hoggish sounds.<br />
<br />
The Professor just listened and made no move to help poor Marvin till the young man now in the trials of change began to squeal out of real panic. Pursing his body for what was happening it popped out, a true piggy tail made Marv begin to rave wildly.<br />
<br />
An hour later sees marvin in the Professor's labratory his puffy self seated on the exam table. He has tears running down over thick cheeks, his eyes blurry from tears. A nervous hand fondles his changing maleness as the other hand feels a bristly face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marvin you need to know that what your experiencing is not all that bad. In fact it is rather what I expected for you. As you came here I injected you with my experimental D.N.A. Reformation serum. This along with the hormones you ingested have begun your physical swing from human to the bodily form of a boar hog. I planned this from the first and for you your employment here will be to increase the gene catalog by making a higher and more advanced breeding to our hog population. I might let you know that as a Bershire hog and boar you will be our prime stud. In doing what is expected as a boar you will be granted special perks and housed away from the real hogs when not mating. I know your next question even before you ask it, will you remain as a hog? Yes, the process condenses your cell structure making you a super boar in bone and body density. Moreover your sexual ability and the drive to mate will be decidedly higher than a common boar hog. what might be of interest is that you expected life span should remain simular to being human. One being so enhanced should expect with retained good health to live three score and ten years as a verile male boar Hog!&quot; announced the thrilled Professor as Marvin could only sit and listen.</p>
