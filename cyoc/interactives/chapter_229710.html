<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You ultimately decided not to change her... well, at least for now. The Food she was preparing actually had a higher priority right now. All those changes from the flashlight and all your boners made you hungry and even a bit exhausted. You decided to head upstairs and take a shower.<br />
<br />
As you opened the door to the bathroom, you noticed steam coming out of the room. You saw a vague figure through all the steam. It was your younger brother, Ben. He was now 16 and getting into the cocky phase of puberty, trying to annoy you or even mock you for little imperfections.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t you lock the door like any other normal human being? How long have you even been showering for? This steam is insane.&quot; You asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;None of your business. Now get out!&quot;<br />
<br />
You were annoyed beyond belief, but ultimately decided it was no use and handled the situation like a clever big brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, but make it quick. Other people want to shower too, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
As you begun to turn around to leave the bathroom, you suddenly heard a loud noise from below you. It sounded like an anvil has just fallen from the ceiling, but you guessed that it had to be your mother in some way. Maybe she knocked seomthing over? Wouldn&#39;t be a surprise with the size of her muscles.<br />
<br />
You decide to check in with her and head back downstairs. Not that anything in the kitchen could hurt her, but you were more worried about the entire kitchen being destroyed. In your rush downstairs, you never noticed that the flashlight was gone. You were too shocked by the loud noise to notice that you moved a bit too much, leading to the loosely pocketed flashlight to fall out of your pocket. As it impacted with the floor, it activated itself on the last setting which was an intense blue and not too wide... but unfortunately wide enough for your little brother to be completely engulfed by it across the bathroom.<br />
<br />
So as he was continuing to rub some shampoo all over his quite average body, he started to change all over. His arms began to show signs of athleticism, as well as his legs. While he was giving his belly a good rub, it quickly changed from soft to a hard washboard of abs. His height of 5&#39;10&quot; also increased steadily, already having grown to 6&#39;2&quot;. His flaccid dick almost looked like it could rival a hard one.<br />
<br />
By now you were only arriving downstairs and looked all over the kitchen. It appeared that she accidentally put down the knife too hard and chipped a large chunk of the granite counter. While you were asking your mom if everything was alright, which it was, your brother continued to enjoy his life changing shower.<br />
<br />
Over the course of just a minute, Ben has grown from an average teen to a musclebound man as big as his mother. But still, he was not done showering yet. He just loved the hot water too much on his chiseled body.<br />
<br />
So as more and more unreasonable power flowed into your unreasonable cocky brother, you sat down at the dinner table after your mom suggested it. You complained that your brother still wasn&#39;t done with showering, to which you guessed your mother might do something against. But since reality got changed and your brother was already that much bigger than your mom, she didn&#39;t say a word since she knew that it was useless anyway.<br />
<br />
Finally done showering, your brother exited the bathroom, stepping over the flashlight since his pecs obscured his vision downwards.<br />
<br />
You hear, and feel, little earthquakes coming from above. You didn&#39;t know why since your mother was in the kitchen and currently not walking, but then it hit you. You searched all over your pants for the flashlight while the noise only got louder and louder. You couldn&#39;t find it in your hysteric search. Then the noise stopped.<br />
<br />
You looked up to see your once little brother, massively changed. He was even taller than your mom at 10 feet tall with a dick that could made your mom&#39;s look pathetic. His arms and legs were colossally bloated with super dense muscles. You couldn&#39;t imagine just how much power he had now. His angry 10-pack looked like it could swallow your arm whole if it wanted to and his pecs looked like giant cannonballs of pure strength.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong, pipsqueak.&quot; He said in a devastatingly low voice that immediately send shivers down your spine. If your brother was any bit close to his old personality, you knew you were fucked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Answer me, or else...&quot; Ben flexed his humongous biceps and you watched on as it skyrocketed high above his head, now looking even denser and harder than before, which you thought would be impossible.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I, uhm... no, I was just wondering why you were naked&quot; You managed to stammer out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, you know perfectly well that I can barely hide all this bulk. I reserve my clothes for outside.&quot; He smirked overly confident. Not that you would disagree, with his body he had all the reason to be super cocky and confident.</p>
