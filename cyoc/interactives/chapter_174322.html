<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad woke up.  The morning sun shone through is window. He scratched his nuts. That was odd. He usually was rock hard when he woke up. He was more surprised he wasn&#39;t hard after touching himself. He shrugged. He could not remember what happened last night. Too much beer? Maybe something stronger? He threw back his covers and headed to the bathroom. He was thirsty and had to pee. He squatted in front of his toilet to take a drink, but stopped himself.  What was he thinking? Must be a hangover, but he didn&#39;t have a headache? Rick claimed that certain hard liquors didn&#39;t give you headaches. Was it Everclear or Schnaaps? Chad couldn&#39;t remember.  He drained his bladder, and flushed the toilet. Then he went to the sink, took a drink lapping the water from the tap instead of using his glass.  Then he rubbed his face ready to shave, but there was no stubble to shave. He hefted his balls, they felt lighter than usual.  He must have seen some action last night. Why couldn&#39;t he remember his secret admirer? He checked his cock for dried spegnum. None.  Maybe he showered and shaved when got home? He sniffed his armpit. Nope, he needed a shower.  It was weird, his shower was bone dry. It usually was damp from its last use the day before. He shrugged got in the shower.  It took him a minute to figure out how it worked.  He had just used it yesterday and every day for the last six years. He shook his head. He felt like it was ages since he last showered. He felt a leather collar on his neck. That was new.<br />
<br />
He figured out how to turn off the shower after accidentally freezing and roasting himself. He got out, and shook himself scattering water everywhere. Then he toweled off, and went back into his room. Maybe there were photos or text messages to remind him what happened.<br />
<br />
Chad immediately noticed the phone said it was Monday not Saturday. He lost the weekend? Then he saw the date.  He lost six weeks?<br />
<br />
The phone rang.  ID said Karl.  Since when was Karl in his address book? Maybe the nerd was tutoring him again? He had tutored Chad a couple years ago, but Chad had never stored his name on his phone.<br />
<br />
Chad answered,  &quot;Hello, uh, Karl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit, Chad,&quot; said the voice over the phone.<br />
<br />
Chad blinked he was seated on the floor with his arms between his legs, and both his hands and feet planted firmly on the floor.  The phone was on the floot next to his right hand. He wanted to pick it up, but he had to stay in position. He noticed Karl&#39;s laughing face on the screen of his phone. It was a video call, so Karl could see him squatting like this! <br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy, Chad.  Brad really trained you well. Of course, you don&#39;t remember any of that training do you, Chad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad wracked his brain. Brad was his older brother who trained dogs. Brad trained him? It didn&#39;t make sense. He couldn&#39;t protest. He couldn&#39;t speak.  He had to sit unless told otherwise. He was a good boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy, Chad. You may pick up the phone and get dressed. Today is a big day. Baseball training starts today,&quot; Karl said. He added as Chad picked up the phone, &quot;You can wear your jeans, athletic socks and sneakers, but be sure to wear tight clingy spandex shirt and underwear. I like it when you wear spandex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad wanted to say something about that being an inappropriate request, but instead answered, &quot;yes, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karl laughed again, and said, &quot;Good boy, Chad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad felt that he had done right,  and was happy as he dressed to Karl&#39;s specifications. He went downstairs,  and ate breakfast with his parents, brother Dylan, and little brother Eddie. He was uncharacteristically silent throughout the meal.<br />
<br />
His mother asked if he was okay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, guess, I&#39;m just distracted thinking about baseball. It starts today at school.&quot;<br />
Chad didn&#39;t want to admit he had a hole in his memory for the last six weeks.<br />
<br />
He brushed his teeth, grabbed his jacket, backpack and gym bag and went to his car. He stared at the dash. He said, &quot;Go car!&quot; It didn&#39;t.  He examined the controls and pushed the starter button. The car roared to life. Now what? he wondered.<br />
<br />
Just then Karl pulled up in a G class Mercedes SUV. He parked behind Chad, and got out.  He opened Chad&#39;s car door. He said,  &quot;I guess I forgot to tell you that I was driving you today. How did you start your car?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The start button,&quot; Chad answered, &quot;It&#39;s marked &quot;Start&quot;, &quot; he added. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, push it again to turn it off. Get your stuff, and get in my car. Maybe I&#39;ll let you drive me later this week?&quot; Karl said noncommitally. He hadn&#39;t counted on Chad figuring out how to start a car after Karl had blocked all memories on how to drive a car. <br />
<br />
Chad sniffed Karl.  He smelled really good.<br />
So Chad gathered his things after shutting off the car.  He climbed into the front passenger seat, and looked confused. Karl ended up reaching across to buckle Chad&#39;s shoulder belt. He&#39;d fix that memory later. He started his Benz and drove away.</p>
