<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shelby sat in silence. She stood in her room and listened to what was happening on the other side. She could hear the other two bimbos carrying on downstairs and giggling away whatever they were talking about. But she listened in on the noises just outside her door. She carefully walked to the door and peered through the large keyhole much like in an old cartoon.<br />
<br />
There just on the side of the hall stood the back of who she assumed was Lynn. She didn’t look much different, but she was also looking at Lynn’s backside. But one thing was for sure, her hair was much longer and a bright blue color! She seemed to be talking on the phone with someone. Shelby couldn’t understand a word considering she was speaking in Japanese. Was it her parents she was speaking with? A friend? Relatives? <br />
<br />
Shelby tried to listen in and picked up words she did know in Japanese. Thanks to the wonder that is anime, she knew a couple of words. One of which was “otosan” which translates to “father”. So maybe she was talking to her dad?<br />
<br />
As Shelby continued to look through the keyhole, Shelby’s stomach dropped! Lynn turned around and she saw the largest breasts she had seen! Sure Harmony and Aimee were big downstairs, but Lynn was by far the biggest! However, something seemed odd about her chest. Sure, they were big, but they were also unnatural looking. Not to the point they looked like bolt on tits, but they had a perkiness to them that said they had implants in them!<br />
<br />
Even though Shelby was one to not like implants, she had to admit, they didn’t look too bad on Lynn. They made her look like an anime girl! Small petite little girl with massive boobs that defied gravity!<br />
<br />
“Lynn got a boob job?” Shelby said almost a bit too loudly. So much so that Lynn looked at Shelby’s door, said a few words to whomever she was talking to and hung up. Staring through the keyhole, she saw those boobs, followed by Lynn walk up to her door and knocked on it.<br />
<br />
This in turn made Shelby fall on her butt. She paused thinking on what to do or say! Clearly Lynn wanted to talk to Shelby, but should she act natural? Should she act like this new Lynn is the Lynn she already knows? It was so confusing!! She took in a few breaths and got up and slowly opened the door.<br />
<br />
“Herro!” Lynn said as Shelby immediately noticed her accent was far thicker, almost offensively thick. Now that Shelby got a good look at the girl, she would notice that it looked like Lynn had a bit of work done and not just in her boobs. Her lips had certainly looked filled in, but thankfully not in that “bee stung” fashion. She also looked a bit thinner in her thighs and tummy, clearly indicating she had lipo done. But looking her up and down, she couldn’t help but gawk at the fact she had work done, but it all looked oddly natural! Maybe the way they do things over in Japan are way more different than here in America.<br />
<br />
“W-who was that you were talking to?” Shelby asked a little nervously.<br />
<br />
“My sugar daddy!” She said almost a little too confidently. “He rive in Tokyo! Big name in big business!”<br />
<br />
It almost hard to understand what Lynn was saying through that thick accent! Thankfully she got the major idea of what she was saying. Shelby pieced it together! Ms. Sunderland changed how Lynn was always the quiet goodie girl into a girl that demanded attention from her sugar daddy! It almost made Shelby want to faint. <br />
<br />
“I…I see.” Shelby added. “S-so, did you need anything?”<br />
<br />
Lynn only shook her head causing her breasts to wobble back and forth. Not so much jiggle, which was odd to look at! Really thinking about it, was Lynn even wearing a bra?! “Sherby ristening to Rynn’s conversation with otosan? Jearous?” She said with a wink. Shelby wanted to quickly say no, that she wasn’t, but she stood there silent. Lynn practically pushed Shelby out of way and laid down on Shelby’s bed. <br />
<br />
This naturally begged the question of how this happened!<br />
<br />
<br />
``````````````````````````````<br />
LAST NIGHT<br />
``````````````````````````````<br />
<br />
<br />
Lynn made it back to her room around the same time everyone was. However, she wasn’t exactly the most hungry. She hardly ever was, but she managed to eat a little something that Harmony cooked up and went upstairs. <br />
<br />
Crashing on her bed, she opened up her laptop and began to watch some late night anime, nothing too spectacular, but a little something to keep her entertained. Large robots kicking the crap out of big monsters, while large busty women bounced around in skimpy outfits, the normal stuff when it came to anime. She found herself dozing off a little when she realized she never took a shower that day. She might as well knock it out considering she hated morning showers. Besides, she looked at the clock and only saw that it was a little after ten. <br />
<br />
She got up from the bed and walked over to her small bathroom and began to run the water. She loved the fact that each room for each girl had their own shower. That way, they would all have their own privacy. Only drawback was the fact that they could only take a max shower of fifteen minutes to save the hot water. <br />
<br />
After taking her clothes off she stepped into the shower and felt the hot water rush all over her. It felt relaxing and Lynn only wish she could be in there forever! She felt the water rush all over her petite body as she began to lather herself up.<br />
<br />
As the soap spread over her body, she did notice that the water was feeling particularly warm. Dare she admit it was getting hot! She quickly turned the cold water on to help cool it off a bit and it did help, at least a little bit. She soon began to feel the heat again with a combination of light-headedness and an odd aching feeling in her body. Was she getting sick or something? <br />
<br />
She chose to ignore it and tried to finish up her shower. The more soaked and lathered up her hair, the more it began to change. It soon began to grow longer and starting form the root, change into a blue color! Crazy enough, the color almost looked natural on her! Lynn didn’t notice these changes since her eyes were closed in fear of getting soap in her eyes. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, her body would soon begin to shift as her stomach and thighs got a bit smaller and thinner. Slowly but surely, Lynn would lose nearly ten pound of fat just from her tummy and thighs. Lynn soon brought the soap to her now skinnier tummy and felt it. She paused for a moment and felt her stomach again. She had a little bit of pudge form before, but now it was gone. Her stomach was much flatter than it was! She quickly washed her hair and got the soap out of her face.<br />
<br />
“What the hell!?” She said feeling her thinner stomach. “How did this happen!?” She said in a slight panic. She wanted to get out of the shower and examine what had just happened when suddenly, she felt a sharp pain in her chest. It nearly made her double over in the shower. What was more was that she was finally taking notice of her growing and color changing hair! This in turn caused her to panic more!<br />
<br />
As much as she wanted to get out of the shower and get help, something in her brain told her to stay and enjoy what was happening! But the pain in her chest subsided and eventually turned into a slight pressure. Looking down in pleasure and in of course in panic, she saw her breasts were beginning to swell!<br />
<br />
“Oh my god!” She said clutching her chest tightly as if to try and prevent them from swelling out further! Lynn normally had a bit of a chest, nothing anyone would consider larger or even so much as big. She was average with maybe about a C cup at most. But looking down at them, she could easily determine that they were reaching DD cups in no time flat!<br />
<br />
“My boobs!” She said in a panic. Her breath quickened making her anxiety rise through the roof! She turned around in the shower to see if anything else was swelling or changing. That is when she noticed her hair. She had hair that reached passed her shoulders, but now it was easily tickling the tops of her butt cheeks! But the length was one thing, but it was the color that shocked her! She took a large clump of her wet hair and with her own eyes saw the color change from its normal dark brown to a bright almost neon blue! <br />
<br />
Lynn attention was then drawn back to her swelling chest! She was so distracted by her hair that she failed to see her boobs swell to a hefty G cup! She was now Shelby’s size! She couldn’t help but notice the weight that her chest now had! Was this something that Shelby walked around with on a daily basis? The poor girl! Was something Lynn thought of. That wasn’t all however. The swelling went past G cups and went into H cup! She was getting bigger than Shelby! <br />
<br />
A part of her was feeling an almost confidence in herself just from the fact that she had lovely breasts! The bigger they got, the better she felt! Even more so, she began to feel a bit horny! Her hands instinctively went up to her swelling breasts and began to play with them! Feeling the softness and the jiggle, it only turned her on even more. She much so that one hand was on her breasts and the other traveled down and began to play with herself! <br />
<br />
In her lustful bliss, she also failed to notice the fact that her own lips were puffing up and feeling a bit tighter than usual. But she was once again hit with a bit of light-headedness as soon memories began to flood into her head. <br />
<br />
While living in Japan with her parents, she soon began to develop at an early age, which caused the girls at school to make fun of her. Once she graduated she pursued to fulfill a career in the adult industry. One of her idols was Hitomi Tanaka, the famous Japanese porn star with O cup breasts! <br />
<br />
Lynn was reaching her orgasm as her old memories were being replaced! She recalled moving to America to help get herself into the industry. Of course that is where she did meet the famous porn star that Aimee had become, hence why she was there as well. However, on an outing, Lynn met a rather wealthy businessman who lived back in Japan and told her that he would be her sugar daddy in exchange for her to come back to Japan every month for his sugar. The man even paid for her breast implants, lip injection and lipo that she got. Whether or not she was going to have more word done was all up to her!<br />
<br />
Lynn then erupted in a massive orgasm that shook her entire body! She opened her eyes and looked down to see her large silicon breasts staring right back at her as she giggled and bounced them up and down. <br />
<br />
“Ooooh, me rove you rong time.” She said with her thick accent before turning off the water and drying herself off. <br />
<br />
<br />
```````````````````````````<br />
PRESENT<br />
```````````````````````````<br />
Of course Shelby was in awe. The quiet Lynn now a sugar daddy loving, soon-to-be porn star like Aimee was! <br />
<br />
“This isn’t right. You didn’t use to be like this!” Shelby said stepping up to Lynn on the bed. She just rolled over and looked at her confused.<br />
<br />
“Rynn arways rike this.” She said giving her huge boob a poke.<br />
<br />
Shelby only shook her head. “No! You weren’t! Lynn, you use to be smarter, MUCH smarter! Harmony wasn’t always this busty bimbo housewife and neither was Aimee! Ms. Sunderland did something to use and we’re all changing one by one!”<br />
<br />
Shelby even took a moment to think maybe she was crazy? Shifting reality was so hard to keep up with. Was she crazy? Was she the only one noticing? Or is she the one who just can’t accept the simple fact all her roommates were bimbos?! <br />
<br />
But she knew one thing; she needed to see Ms. Sunderland!</p>
