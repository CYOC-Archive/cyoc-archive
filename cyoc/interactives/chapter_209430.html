<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright,&quot; Ethan thought. &quot;Lets see what happens.&quot; Loeering himself to the floor, Ethan now tookba breath before beginning his workout.<br />
<br />
One..two...<br />
<br />
An odd feeling crept over him. Ethan couldn&#39;t quite explain it, it felt like mild electric shock or having a limb fall asleep. He had heard of arms, legs, hands, falling asleep but could your while body?<br />
<br />
Three...four...five...six...<br />
<br />
The feeling persisted. Ethan was confused, push-ups usually didn&#39;t bother him but it felt like he was growing a little more tired than usual. The tiredness wasn&#39;t extreme but he felt something. It was almost as if he had been exercising for hours, which was odd since he hadn&#39;t even broken a sweat. <br />
<br />
Seven...eight...nine..ten..<br />
<br />
Ethan finished, slowly getting to his feet with a groan. He paused, usually whenever he finished exercising he felt energized, ready to do something else. Thinking back he recalled a conversation with his mother when he was still living at home. She referred to it as youthful energy. At 21 you could abuse your body all night and wake up the next day like nothing ever happened. Ethan chuckled at the thought, remembering his mothers warning. &quot;Just wait and see how you feel in 10 or 20 years when you groan just tying your shoes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now as he stood, Ethan let out an unfamiliar groan. His body felt stiff and sore. Grunting he reached a hand to his lower back, since when had he developed back issues. Glancing down at his body, he now gasped at what he saw.<br />
<br />
Ethan chest was harrier, much harrier than usual. Stroking a hand along his chest he could feel the coarseness of his chest hair. It was thick, curly, covering much larger pecs than he was accustomed too. &quot;What the hell,&quot; he whispered.<br />
<br />
Quickly Ethan now sprinted for the full length mirror. At least his body still had speed. As he came to a stop, he gawked at the image before him.<br />
<br />
Ethan wasn&#39;t a young man of 21 now, he looked at least a decade older. Studying his appearance he marveled at what he beheld. The man&#39;s muscles had become thicker. Ethan gazing at a larger chest and shoulders. At 31 he appeared chiseled, no longer as svelte as he used to be. Glancing at his arms he was astonished to see they looked bulkier as well. Flexing he could see they had accumulated more mass while maintaining their form. &quot;Holy shit,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Look at that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan now touched his face, shocked by his appearance. It was still him, he recognized his own face, it was just older, more angular. Running his hand over his cheeks, Ethan was astounded by the stubble that had formed. Usually he only needed to shave every other day, now looking at a days worth of growth in the morning told him he would definitely have to change that to everyday. A chuckle now escaped his lips as he happily observed his older body. He liked what he saw so far.<br />
<br />
As his eyes now traveled downwards, he began to see downside of getting older. The once impressive six pack he had sported had faded. The man&#39;s stomach was still washboard flat, but the muscles on his abdomen were less defined. Couple that with a light patch of body hair on his stomach caused Ethan to frown slightly. Running his hands along his hips, he could tell they seemed a bit wider. The man&#39;s rear and thighs weren&#39;t as narrow as they were before. <br />
<br />
As he inspected his legs and groin, Ethan spirits began to brighten. Still sporting an impressive package with a well maintained patch of public hair. Ethan smirked, seeing the small amount of hair on his stomach trailing down to his groin. &quot;Whats that they call it,&quot; he smirked. &quot;A happy trail?&quot;<br />
<br />
Glancing at his legs he could see they toi appeared to have bulked up in his transformation. Ethan thighs and calfs appeared more muscular, his leg hair now more profound. As he studied the entire picture, Ethan couldn&#39;t help but enjoy what he saw.<br />
<br />
Instead of a svelte, swimmer like body, Ethan now possessed a bulkier, more muscled one. The man&#39;s proportions were impressive, Ethan thinking to himself he looked like one of those MMA fighters. &quot;I probably put on 20 lbs of muscle at least,&quot; he whispered. &quot;Is this what I&#39;m going to look like at 31 years old?&quot;<br />
<br />
Walking back to his laptop, Ethan glanced at the picture of himself. Sure enough the image was him, only 10 years older. Taking a seat Ethan now began to rub his chin. The possibilities were endless with this thing. The only question was what kind of experimentation should he conduct.</p>
