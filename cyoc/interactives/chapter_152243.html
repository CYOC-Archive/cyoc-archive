<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Break was over, and it was a few more hours before it was time to even get off of work. When Shane stepped outside, relieved by the next shift, night had fallen. A couple others were leaving with him at the same time, all headed to their cares in the parking lot except for Luke who was heading towards the bus stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want a ride?&quot; Shane called after Luke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love one if it&#39;s not a hassle.&quot; Luke did not look eager to go stand on the side of the road, waiting for the bus. &quot;Car broke down, and I&#39;m still saving up to get it fixed.&quot; He said as he fell in beside Shane as they both walked towards his truck. Luke ran his hand through the shaggy brown curls on his head. &quot;And the sooner I can get a shower to clean the smell of burger grease off the better.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No worries.&quot; Shane responded as he looked at Luke sideways, this was his chance to get him alone. &quot;Just let me text my parents, tell them I might be a bit late.&quot; He pulled out his phone, but instead of texting he pulled up Luke&#39;s info:<br />
<br />
Name: Luke Peters<br />
Age: 20<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian<br />
Height: 6&#39;<br />
Weight 175lbs<br />
Build: Average - Active<br />
Hairiness: Light<br />
Status: Single<br />
Sexual Preference: Heterosexual<br />
Penis size: 5&quot; soft, 7.5&quot; erect<br />
Occupation: College Student (Journalism major), Fast Food Supervisor<br />
<br />
The orientation had actually kind of surprised Shane. He could have sworn Luke was gay, or at least bi. Or maybe it was just wishful thinking on his part, and Luke hadn&#39;t been flirting with the Deputy, only being his friendly self. The hairiness was another thing, Luke must have it just right to peek free of that polo shirt. But Shane was only in there to check one thing, and now that he did, he changed it, and clicked the button to proceed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You still live with your parents?&quot; Luke asked curiously, as he waited for Shane to unlock the door.<br />
<br />
Shane tucked his phone away, unlocked his car, and they both hopped in. &quot;Well, yeah, at least until I graduate in a month.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke gave him a funny look. &quot;Wait? You&#39;re still in high school? Damn. I thought you were at the college like me. Fuck, you even look older than me. How old are you, anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane laughed, mostly because it was a question he was used to. &quot;Eighteen.&quot; He looked over at Luke as he started the car. Strangely, confirming he was at least that old seemed to put Luke at ease. &quot;Men in my family get hairy early. You should see my little brother. He&#39;s fourteen and hairier that most of the guys in my class.&quot; Well, maybe not if he kept going on with the Chronivac the way he was, he thought.<br />
<br />
He was watching Luke&#39;s reaction, trying to guess what was going on in his head. The change he made wasn&#39;t a physical one so it was hard to tell, so as he followed Luke&#39;s directions to the apartment he kept talking. &quot;What do you think of James?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane quickly got his answer in regards to the change. &quot;James? Oh.. you mean Deputy Hotpants?&quot; Shane laughed at Luke&#39;s nickname for the guy, even as Luke tried to casually adjust himself in his pants. &quot;Nice guy. Kind of cute..&quot; Luke paused then corrected himself. &quot;Very cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know you were into guys.&quot; Shane tried to put a bit of surprise into his tone. He knew by the end of this trip Luke would only be into guys. After all, that&#39;s what the app in his pocket was doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not something I feel the need to bring up at work. If you didn&#39;t know why&#39;d you ask? What do you think of him?&quot; Luke at least sounded amused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to know, I thought you might have been flirting with him.&quot; Shane said trying to sound innocent. &quot;Me? I want to pin him to the ground, tear off his shirt, and run my fingers all through his fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke looked a little shocked at first, then broke into laughter. &quot;Shit, dude, you don&#39;t hold back, do you?&quot; Shane shook his head, but noticed a very obvious tent in the front of Luke&#39;s pants, hopefully from thinking about his comment on Deputy Hotpants. &quot;Here we are.&quot; He pointed at one of the buildings along the road and Shane pulled in, coming to a stop in front of the doors. Luke was hesitating getting out of the car, obviously thinking about something &quot;Wanna come up? My roommate is at his girlfriend&#39;s for the weekend and I&#39;ve got cold beers and an extra controller. I mean, it&#39;s Friday night. Unless you got plans?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane smiled, &quot;Sure, I&#39;ll just need to tell my parents not to wait up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke pointed to some of the parking spaces. &quot;Next to the blue one, that&#39;s my roommate Rick&#39;s spot you can use it. Right.. the parents thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as it&#39;s not a school night, they let me act like an adult. I just gotta let them know so they don&#39;t worry.&quot; Shane slipped his phone out of his pocket as Luke got out of the car. He checked the app seeing Luke was indeed now only interested in guys, specifically muscular, hairy guys. Finding the fetish options under sexual preferences was going to make things even more interesting. There were tons, but certain ones were near the top. He had made sure Deputy Hotpants was a complete bottom, and now it was helping him with Luke. He had noticed a couple others under Luke&#39;s profile, but he figured everyone had a few. Shane flipped over to his texts and sent a quick one off to his parents. They would worry, after all.<br />
<br />
Following Luke up to his apartment, Shane found what he thought he would. Small, a little bit on the messy side, but not trashed. It looked like a place housing two college guys. He noticed a pair of plaid boxers draped over the back of a chair, and when he pointed at it Luke just kinda shrugged. &quot;Rick&#39;s. I&#39;m boxer-briefs.&quot; Still he plucked them off the back of the chair and flung them through one of the doors down the hall before vanishing into the kitchen. &quot;Fighters or shooters?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane was confused for a moment, before he remembered he had been invited up on the pretense of video games. &quot;Fighters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke came back out with two bottles of beer, Shane arched his brow but took it and twisted off the cap. &quot;Rick&#39;s twenty-two, I give him cash, he keeps me stocked.&quot; He grinned as he plopped down on the couch, booting up his game system. They played a couple warm up matches as they both waited for the beers to loosen their nerves a little, Shane skipping the chair in favor of sharing the couch with Luke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, let&#39;s make this interesting.&quot; Shane said, an idea occurring to him. Luke motioned for him to go on as he took a sip of beer. &quot;Little wager each match. Loser loses a piece of clothing.&quot; It sounded better in his head and corny coming out of his mouth. But it had been his plan to get Luke naked before altering him any, and it was the best he could come up with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Luke sounded amused by the idea, and Shane lost the first two matches on purpose. He tried not to make it look like he did. First he had pulled off his work polo, leaving him in his undershirt, which seemed an acceptable choice. But after the second match he peeled off his undershirt and tossed that aside much to Luke&#39;s surprise. &quot;You know you have two shoes and two socks on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane was trying to get a rise out of Luke and knew his own muscular, hairy chest would be driving him a little bit insane. &quot;I usually sit around the house shirtless, the shoes will have to come off before the pants.&quot; He idly rubbed at one of his pectorals, letting his fingers run through his chest hair a little. Luke tried to look like he wasn&#39;t looking, and not very well.<br />
<br />
Then Shane got serious. He wasn&#39;t a big video game player, he had some of course, but he also had his old memories as Chris, which had way more knowledge of video games. Enough that after a spree of matches Luke had lost his work polo and both his shoes and both his socks. He has left his undershirt on, not being as bold as Shane. Shane on the other hand lost only his shoes. Another match went to Shane and Luke sighed, standing up. &quot;I need another beer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Clothing first!&quot; Shane called out, teasingly. Luke grinned and took hold of his undershirt, pulling it off over his head and dropping it on the pile. It was the first good look Shane ever had at shirtless Luke and it gave him some ideas to work with. He obviously got to the gym once in a while if not regularly. He wasn&#39;t thin, or fat, but he didn&#39;t have much in the way of definition beyond his chest and biceps. He also was not hairy at all, he had a light triangle of curly brown fuzz at the top of his chest which would give an illusion of hairiness through an unbuttoned polo, and a thin treasure trail down his stomach starting at his navel and disappearing beneath his waist band. He caught Shane looking and spread his arms a little as if to show off before he disappeared into the kitchen. It was enough for Shane to go to his next couple of changes, he quickly pulled out his phone and made a couple more adjustments:<br />
<br />
Name: Luke Peters<br />
Age: 20<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian<br />
Height: 6&#39;<br />
Weight 190lbs<br />
Build: Fit<br />
Hairiness: Light<br />
Status: Single<br />
Sexual Preference: Homosexual<br />
Penis size: 5&quot; soft, 7.5&quot; erect<br />
Occupation: College Student (Journalism major), Fast Food Supervisor, Amateur Fitness Model<br />
<br />
Shane hoped it wouldn&#39;t alter his general size, too much. He figured changing the build to Fit would move some of Luke&#39;s.. well he wasn&#39;t fat but he wasn&#39;t pure muscle either, but he hoped it would shift the little pudge he had to muscle, and another fifteen in muscle, and being an aspiring fitness model meaning he&#39;d change for definition and sculpting over anything else. Or so Shane figured. He started the change just as Luke appeared with two more beers, offering the second to Shane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trying to get me drunk?&quot; Shane joked.<br />
<br />
Luke just looked him up and down, eyes lingering on his chest for a little. &quot;I bet it&#39;d take two twelve packs and half a bottle of rum to get you drunk.&quot; He took his seat back on the couch. &quot;We never decided what the winner of our strip tournament gets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To see the other guy naked.&quot; Shane answered simply as he started in on his second beer of the evening, eyes lingering on Luke, looking for changes. Luke&#39;s pecs certainly seemed more obvious, and his stomach wasn&#39;t as flat anymore, a ridge forming down the middle and another. When he brought his arm up for a sip of beer, Luke&#39;s bicep popped just a little bit more, and Shane could see the shape of his delts. The changes were slow and subtle, like watching one of those update videos where a person trying to get in shape posts a picture of themselves every month.<br />
<br />
Shane was right though, Luke wasn&#39;t getting all that much bigger. Even that extra fifteen pounds didn&#39;t seem to add too much, he was just getting shredded. He might need a bigger shirt size if he didn&#39;t mind it a bit tight across his chest, but Shane hoped he wouldn&#39;t. Lukes pecs were turning into a thing of beauty. From a just defined chest to a pair of plump, slightly rounded muscles tipped with dark pink nipples. He could see that wonderful little horseshoe shape in Luke&#39;s triceps, and as his six pack tightened up he had to resist the urge to run his fingers along that perfect tapered V of a belt around his hips. Jeans sadly still his his legs, except for the way his ass now filled out the back a bit more than before.<br />
<br />
It was interesting seeing his own bare torso next to Luke&#39;s. Shane had good definition, but he trained for bulk and power, Luke&#39;s body was sculpted to show off the muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naked? That&#39;s it.&quot; Luke joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;d be happy with it, and if you win, trust me, that final reveal can be worth it.&quot; Shane smirked as he picked his controller back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a cocky shit, lucky thing I think you&#39;re good looking. A little short, but it&#39;s growing on me.&quot; Luke took the teasing dig as they resumed their matches.<br />
<br />
Shane snorted, he was used to short jokes. Honestly, when he had first changed from Chris it bothered him. But spending the day as Shane, he found it just didn&#39;t matter. In fact, he liked it. Even short he was usually the strongest guy in the room, and he could have used the Chronivac to fix it at any time, he just didn&#39;t feel like it. &quot;Friends at school call me Gor, it&#39;s short for Gorilla.&quot; Shane said as he lost a match, distracted from watching Luke&#39;s new muscles. He reached down and slid off a sock.<br />
<br />
&quot;It fits.&quot; Luke lost the next match, relieving him of his belt, followed by another loss that saw the jeans hit the floor. Luke was left sitting on the couch in a pair of thigh hugging black boxer briefs that did nothing to hide the fact he was sporting an erection, nor did they conceal the damp spot around where the head of his rigid shaft was covered.<br />
<br />
Seemingly unwilling to lose his last piece of clothing, he came back for two more rounds, costing Shane another sock and his belt. But Shane won at last, forcing those underwear to come off and join the pile of discarded clothing, with the victor sitting there in his pants and underwear. He took in his well-earned eyeful though. Luke&#39;s cock stood out at full mast, a trimmed bush of brown hair around the base being the only place where his body hair might be called thick. Jokingly, he struck a few bodybuilder poses for Shane before dropping back down on the couch. &quot;Congratulations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You certainly don&#39;t seem to mind losing.&quot; Shane said as he traded his controller for his beer. Finding it empty, he motioned to the kitchen, silently offering to fetch the next round and Luke nodded. Shane pulled out his phone in the kitchen and got the third set of changes going:<br />
<br />
Name: Luke Peters<br />
Age: 20<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Ethnicity: Caucasian<br />
Height: 6&#39;<br />
Weight 190lbs<br />
Build: Fit<br />
Hairiness: Somewhat heavy, trimmed<br />
Status: Single<br />
Sexual Preference: Homosexual<br />
Penis size: 6&quot; soft, 8.5&quot; erect<br />
Occupation: College Student (Journalism major), Fast Food Supervisor, Amateur Fitness Model<br />
<br />
Shane tucked his phone back in his pocket and returned with the beers.<br />
<br />
Luke took his with a smile. &quot;I&#39;ve started doing some fitness model work. Pays good when you can find it. But my last shoot I had to sit there for three hours with nothing but a towel to cover my junk while this chick would occasionally squirt me with a water bottle so I looked fashionably sweaty while a guy took my picture over and over, and moved me into different poses. I&#39;m getting used to being stared at.&quot; He idly scratched at his chest where that little patch of hair he had in the middle of his chest was working its way outwards. Little dark hairs peeking out around his nipples, and on his limbs.<br />
<br />
Shane took his seat on the sofa next to Luke where he could get a look up close. From here he swore he could see each little hair slipping from its follicle.  &quot;Well, you got the body for it, I don&#39;t know if I could do it myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Luke asked, sounding genuinely perplexed. &quot;You got a great body for it, and they usually look for other builds once in a while.&quot; He turned to face Shane propping one arm up on the back of the couch. That sparse patch of hair under that arm was spreading out, but was still a bit on the short side. Trimmed down. Rough scruff was spreading across Luke&#39;s face, actually accenting his dimples as he grinned at Shane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you usually have to shave yourself down for those shoots.&quot; Shane took a chance and reached out to put his hand on Luke&#39;s chest. It felt like stubble growing in, though he could feel the hairs spreading out below his fingers. By now, Luke&#39;s treasure trail met the growing spread of hair on his chest in an unbroken patch. <br />
<br />
By comparison the hair growing in on Luke&#39;s thighs was light and wispy, thickening towards his knees and crotch. &quot;It&#39;s not so bad, especially when you can get them to do it for you. But actually, it can help. Sometimes they want a smooth guy, sometimes they want a guy with a hairy chest. Helps when you can shave and trim yourself to what they need. All depends on what they want you for.&quot; Luke ran his hand over his chest,  along the inch long, slightly curled hairs that now completely covered his pectorals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually.&quot; Luke continued, hand drifting down his stomach, along the hairs which had spread right up to the edges of his six pack. &quot;The weeks after a shoot where I have to shave down are my favorite.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; Shane let his free hand rest on Luke&#39;s thigh, and Luke seemed fine to let that happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;At first the feeling of being smooth again is weird, not having that layer of hair in the way of your skin. Makes cuddling up with a hairy guy kind of fun. Then you get to feel it all growing back in again, first the bristly feeling of the stubble, then when it starts to get long enough to be soft again. And watching day by day as you go from shaved to furry, it&#39;s kind of a..&quot; Luke laughed. &quot;Well, I think it&#39;s fucking hot watching a smooth guy get hairy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see that.&quot; Shane nodded, and he did. Because he had been doing just that to people all day, ever since he watched it happen to himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;One more match?&quot; Luke reached out to pick up the controlled and wiggle it at Shane.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no clothing left. What&#39;s the stakes?&quot; Shane reached over to pick up the controller, though he suddenly worried at the smile on Luke&#39;s face. &quot;Loser shaves his chest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shane actually felt a flutter of worry. He liked the hair on his chest, and sure he would trim it, but he can&#39;t remember ever having shaved it. &quot;And the winner?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gets to do what they want with the loser in bed.&quot; He reaches down and takes his cock in hand, it was a bit larger and thicker than when he first stripped. Shane just couldn&#39;t help that he liked guys with hefty packages.<br />
<br />
&quot;That could turn out real bad for the loser.&quot; Shane said, though he still settled in with his controlled. If anything his competitiveness wouldn&#39;t let him turn down the bet, and the hair would grow back if he did lose. Besides, he was pretty sure he&#39;d enjoy doing anything in bed with Luke at this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Or real good, all how you look at it.&quot; The match started and shockingly, Shane got his ass completely handed to him. Quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two of three?&quot; Shane asked to a nod from Luke. Who once again solidly trounced him. &quot;Did you just play me this whole time?&quot; Luke just shrugged and got up. He grabbed Shane&#39;s arm and hauled him to his feet, motioning him towards one of the doors. Shane walked over to the queen size bed that took up the middle of the room and flopped onto it, arms spread out. It smelled like Luke in here. He found himself not caring that he lost the bet.<br />
<br />
Luke took a couple of moments to follow, but he came in carrying a towel, a can of shaving cream, and a straight razor. Not one of those cheap razors, but the long, sharp, fancy type you&#39;d see a barber have. What followed were some of the most weirdly erotic minutes Shane could remember having. Luke lathered up his entire chest and stomach and with long careful strokes of the razor began to shave him clean, wiping him off with the towel after every few strokes. He was careful about it, gentle, and experienced. He took special care around Shane&#39;s nipples, bending over to give each one a quick little lick once they were clean. The shaving continued down his stomach, though he styled Shane&#39;s fury abs into a neat, clean treasure trail that required him to unbutton Shane&#39;s pants and tug his underwear down a couple inches to finish off.<br />
<br />
Setting aside his shaving equipment, Luke ran his hands along Shane&#39;s clean chest. And although Chris&#39; chest was baby smooth yesterday, with Shane&#39;s memories at the fore, this felt odd. Especially when Luke pressed his own trimmed chest against his, mouths meeting for a long kiss, tongues dancing together. The feeling of another guy&#39;s fur sliding along his smooth, sensitive chest was electric. It was something he hasn&#39;t experienced in any of his memories, and he could see what Luke loved it.<br />
<br />
The kiss eventually broke, but only so Luke could tug off Shane&#39;s pants and underwear. &quot;Holy... crap.&quot; Right, that. Shane propped himself up to grin at the look on Luke&#39;s face at seeing his very hard, very large member flop free. Luke reached for his lube and began to cover Shane&#39;s shaft with a liberal amount, then pushing his fingers between his own cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, we can do other things, ease you int..&quot; Shane cut off as he felt the head of his cock slipping into Luke&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna walk funny tomorrow, but I&#39;m doing this.&quot; It was a long few minutes as Luke lowered himself onto Shane&#39;s shaft, taking it in inch by slow inch. Luke was wincing, but Shane was gripping onto Luke&#39;s thighs by this point. Not many guys were willing to try to take his shaft, most of his memories were of just fooling around, a lot of frotting and hand jobs. This was a special treat for him, it was turning out even better than his fantasy earlier that morning.<br />
<br />
Luke managed to take most of him, the slowly started sliding along Shane&#39;s shaft, a few inches out and back in. Shane was soon helping by thrusting his hips in time with Luke&#39;s motions. He took Luke&#39;s hard cock in his hand, stroking him in time to the ass fucking. Moment by moment the sped up, Luke as clenching tightly around Shane&#39;s shaft, then the ripple and hard squeezing of Luke&#39;s orgasm from the monster shaft that was abusing his g-spot. Hot cum splattered against Shane&#39;s chest, but Shane was soon lost in his own orgasm, pumping shot after shot of cum deep inside of Luke.<br />
<br />
Pulling himself free, Luke fell to the bed panting, though took the time to use his finger to taste some of his own cum from Shane&#39;s chest, having him suck some off his finger as well. Luke curled up next to Shane, resting his head on his chest. &quot;Fuck, we need to do this again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The hanging out, the shaving, or the fucking?&quot; Shane found himself asking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any of the above.&quot;  They both let their post orgasm bliss fog their minds and carry them off as the dazed out in a tangle of hairy, sweaty limbs.</p>
