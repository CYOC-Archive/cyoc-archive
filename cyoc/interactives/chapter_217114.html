<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the world returned to focus, the first thing that Bill noticed is that everything looked...darker. Did...Had the magic of the Stone misfired in such a way that he&#39;d passed out? He hoped to...Whatever was out there that he hadn&#39;t ended up shrunken as well!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, my head...&quot; He muttered, rubbing a palm against hair that suddenly felt MUCH shorter than it had moments ago. Bill&#39;s eyes went rise and he rose, on wobbly legs that felt larger than they should have been, and stumbled over to a small house-shaped wall decoration that had four tiny, dirty mirrors built into it to resemble windows. He towered over it and had to hunch over to see his reflection, realizing that whatever the Stone had done to him, he was now taller. Bill hadn&#39;t been a short guy before, but he was at least almost a a foot taller than he&#39;d been previously. But despite his height, Bill was more concerned with what he looked like.<br />
<br />
And there, staring back at him, was a gnarled, bullish looking face on top of muscled trunk of a body. It was still Bill&#39;s face but now it just looked...harder. Meaner. Bill brought a finger that felt like a caber log to his face and stared at how it was covered in scars, raised knuckles fingers that looked slightly crooked, as if they&#39;d been broken and re-set by a less than stellar surgeon. That was when Bill felt the taste of ash in his mouth, and he involuntarily coughed and was alarmed at the shortness in his lungs as he sucked in air.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell, have I been smoking?&quot; Bill rumbled, which surprised him further. His voice was SO much deeper than what he was used to. His entire body had been changed! But before Bill could find a larger mirror and inspect himself further (the change having momentarily shoved the plight of Tammy, Gloria and Willow out of his mind), he realized something else.<br />
<br />
This...This wasn&#39;t his house! And not like, the house of his new parents, but a entirely unknown location! The first thing he noticed is that it was small. Very small. No longer was he in the middle of a sizable suburban kitchen, but instead he was in the kitchen area of a much large room, standing in front of a old counter top that had seen better days some decades ago. The walls were cheap paneling, the ceiling a water-stained stucco, and cheap plywood cabinets (many of them plain particle board) and a tiny table that had two thread-bare chairs scattered next to it. On the other side of the flimsy looking bar (that was piled high with trash, envelopes that had a lot of &#39;Past Due&#39; stamped onto them) was a living area that was dominated by a long, haggard looking couch that was sitting on brown, filthy carpet in front of a old bulky TV. There was a small narrow hallway that ran out of the living space, and at the far end was a half-open door that led to what was obviously a bedroom. And there was trash everywhere. The entire house...Or rather trailer, Bill surmised, was filled with trash.<br />
<br />
Beer cans and bottles were the most prevalent of the garbage, but spent cigarette cartons were given them a run for their money. Dirty laundry, food wrappers, assorted papers were scattered across the floor and across most of the free space. There was so much mess that Bill didn&#39;t even realize that there was a small coffee table that sagged in front of the couch. And the reason it was so dark was not because he&#39;d passed out, but heavy curtains hung over the windows.<br />
<br />
&quot;What...Where...&quot; Bill began, but then his attention was divided once more as several quiet squeaks rose up from the filthy sink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! Tammy!&quot; Bill gasped as the realization that his best friend turned girlfriend, his daughter turned sister and Gloria had been shrunk. But where...Where was Rob? Did Bill...Did the Stone make Bill absorb him, or something? That would make sense for how BIG Bill now was, at least. The towering geek took a thundering step over to a filthy looking sink that was piled high with cans, bottles, dirty glasses and plates and looked down.<br />
<br />
There, standing on top of a grease-stained plate that hadn&#39;t been washed in days, was a terrified looking Gloria, tiny tears streaming down her face as she cradled an arm that was covered in blood andvbent the wrong way, while a struggling Tammy was huffing and puffing as she struggled to pull a tiny woman with fiery red hair and MASSIVE tits that Bill didn&#39;t recognize out of the gaping drain. Wait, were they smaller now?<br />
<br />
But...Where was Willow? Bill cast a look over at the surprisingly empty table for a moment, a dreadful thought that his once-little-girl had somehow been left at the old Strasserman residence...Or had been erased entirely. And where the hell was Rob!? But the titanic teen couldn&#39;t deal with that right now, because the red-headed girl was screaming bloody murder and slipping from Tammy&#39;s grasp, who herself was dangerously close to toppling in and sending both tiny women tumbling into the oblivion of the sewer system.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hang on!&quot; Bill rumbled, forgetting to soften his voice, causing a collective scream from the inch-tall women and Gloria falling over into still-extant glob of grease. Bill reached down to grab the Tammy and the other girl (Willow, maybe she was further changed by the new wish?) but slowed himself as he remembered how big he was now. With as full force as he was going both his girlfriend and his...well he hoped it was his daughter might have ended up matching the stains on the inside of the sink. Instead he stopped, took a breath and very gently positioned his hand beneath the flailing, largely barren legs of the red-headed woman, and scooped her up right as Tammy&#39;s grip failed. The even tinier blonde let out of a squeak as she toppled forward onto the redhead, and Bill quickly cupped his other hand over the two lest they roll out of the carriage of flesh, and quickly but gently brought them over to the counter where he did his best to dump the squirming less-than-Barbie sized girls out onto the aged linoleum. Bill looked over at Gloria, who despite what was clearly a broken arm and now slimy with grease, was jumping up and down on the tiny plate.<br />
<br />
Bill gave the pint-sized diva a shrug. She wasn&#39;t in mortal danger (mostly), so she could wait a moment.<br />
<br />
There was a tiny, shrill collective &#39;oof&#39; from both Tammy and the redhead as they tumbled onto the counter-top. And then the redhead was on her feet, a very feminine face scrunched in fury as she spun around, tiny fists balled up as she punched the air and swatted at the mane of hair that was attached to her skull before gravity won, and she toppled to the countertop once more.<br />
<br />
Tammy, meanwhile, was on her knees, hand cupped around her mouth as she yelled up at Bill, who could only hear the sound of her voice, but he couldn&#39;t make out the words she was clearly saying. But that was when movement caught Bill&#39;s eye, and her turned to see a skinny, barely dressed figure dragging herself down the hallway with a loud groan. She moved into what little light there was, and Bill&#39;s face drained of color.<br />
<br />
Option 1: It was...Willow! Or someone who looked like her, at least. Wait...Why were the pictures on the wall showing Bill and Willow together in various bars? Was that a courtroom? Wait...There was a ring on her finger...And Bill&#39;s! Oh, what had the Stone done now!?<br />
<br />
Option 2: It was...Kimberly!? But hadn&#39;t she been erased from existence? What was going on!?</p>
