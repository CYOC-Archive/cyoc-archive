<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen&#39;s newfound confidence that her life was now perfect filled her with pride, so when one day she was out on a walk and saw him, she couldn&#39;t help but talk to him. She walked over to Kyle, who not only stared at her wide eyed at the sight of these legs once sleek now rippleing with muscle, but backed away a little, remembering the last time he talked to her, she kicked him hard enough it sent him flying ten feet into the hall of the high school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Kyle! It&#39;s been a while hasn&#39;t it?&quot; Jen chirped as she knelt down before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y.. yeah it has, you look... amazing.&quot; Kyle said, seeing one of his fantasies played out right in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh and I feel it too. I should really thank you, you&#39;re little curse actually changed my life for the better!&quot; Jen said, she was lying, the difficulty of getting herself cleaned being an ordeal in and of itself, she always dreaded her cleaning time, it took nearly three hours to do. The curse for it&#39;s part was keeping tally, it would unload all at once after this converastion.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I feel amazing! I&#39;m more normal than I&#39;ve ever been!&quot; Jen again lied, she spent many nights staring at her lower half, cursing it, wishing it would go back to normal. &quot;I bet Latoia would be jealous if she saw these legs now.&quot; Again a lie, Latoia wouldn&#39;t even recognize her legs as hers. &quot;Anyway, I just wanted to say hi and let you know I love what you did to me, be seeing you.&quot; Jen lied one last time, she got up and started walking away when she felt an oddly familiar twitch. She shrugged it off until she noticed her view lurching upward and realized what was happening. <br />
<br />
Kyle for his part was not only frozen in place, but horribly turned on, now in front of him were the already massive legs of a black amazon getting even bigger. He couldn&#39;t help but watch as a horrified Jen scream in panic as her legs lurched, trembled and swelled. Audible groaning noises came from her expanding lower half, pavement began to crack under the increasing weight and finally the growth subsided, her legs now a staggering thrity two feet tall. Jen looked down at what she had done to herself crying, she had just gotten used to being sixteen feet tall, now this, but to her horror, the twitching returned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God no.... no no no NO NOAAAAAAAAA!&quot; Jen screamed as the growth accelerated no longer taking it&#39;s time but hurtling her quickly with her second growth spurt, her legs and feet being spread outward, smashing cars and knocking over telephone poles. Kyle ran, he knew this was going to get even worse, and he had to get out of here now. Jen cryied hysterically as the growth continued on for what felt like forever. When it finally stopped she looked down and screamed, her view even higher than before, she now was perched atop a mountain of flesh, sixty four feet tall, the wind kissed her flesh, making just how massive she was now horrible appearent. <br />
<br />
Jen stood in the middle of town, her massive legs obsucring her view of what was around her, sobbing, knowing there would be no going back from this, how could she have been so stupid. Her thoughts were interruped by another twitch, and a low rumble as her legs started to grow again. Jen screamed pleading with them to stop, but the curse did it&#39;s work. She felt the earth under her feet give way, as if she were kicking sand, building collapsed as her expanding legs pressed against them, the new height caused Jen to loose balance and fall backwards, her decent feeling like and eternity she finally felt and heard her still expanding ass hit the earth like a bomb, sending shockwave all around and leveling everything within two block of where she landed. <br />
<br />
Jen panicked and horrified looked all around her at the expanding mountain of flesh connected to her, as it finally stopped growing, all she could see was her hips, a now massive fourty eight feet in diameter, she looked up and saw the legs, and only her legs, distant hills maybe, but all she could see where the legs, now a massive one hundred and twenty eight feet long. Jen was in shock, she couldn&#39;t cry anymore, everything she had was gone, all she could do now as suffer the consequences. &quot;This is what I am now, a giant pair of legs.&quot; And it was with this thought that the final twitch and growth began, Jen screamed again, not in horror but in fury, what had she done to deserve this. Her flesh betrayed her, as it grew larger and larger, she watched in both shock and astonishment as the already huge legs grew even more massive, she heard her feet grinding the earth as they plowed against it getting further and further way, until finally the final growth stopped, leaving her with legs Two hundred and Fifty Six Feet Long, and hips One hundred and Ninety Two Feet in diameter.<br />
<br />
And Jen started crying again, her burden expanded to sizes that mocked her exsitence, she didn&#39;t own them, they were her host, and she was along for the ride. As far as the eye could see, was nothing but the legs of a giantess, her feet like distant mountains, she felt every breeze across her mountanous flesh, trapped by the legs she once envied Jen knew now that there was only one thing she could do, grow. All they wanted to do was get even bigger, she moved her right leg, and felt overwhelmed by the enormity of it. She needed to find a way to fix this, but how, no one would talk to a moster like her now.<br />
<br />
Legs 256 feet <br />
Hips 192 feet</p>
