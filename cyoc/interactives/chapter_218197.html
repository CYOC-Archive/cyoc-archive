<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Many hours later, the bell rings. Whereas it’s time for the students to get out, the bell tells Sean that it’s time for him to reward his chemistry teacher. <br />
<br />
“Have a great afternoon, everyone,” Mr. Jackson orates, “and I’ll see you tomorrow!”<br />
<br />
Thus, Sean stands up out of his seat, grabs his backpack, laptop, and lunch, and rushes his way out of the classroom. Teenagers flood the hallways, much to Sean’s dismay, but he eventually finds Mrs. Thompson’s classroom number. After making sure the coast is clear, Sean enters Mrs. Thompson’s class. The waiting proved to be worth it for Sean as he finds Mrs. Thompson getting ready to leave.<br />
<br />
“Hello, Sean,” Mrs. Thompson charmingly greets, “what brings you in my classroom right now?”<br />
<br />
“I want to reward you for giving me these powers,” he answers.<br />
<br />
“Really?” Mrs. Thompson asks.<br />
<br />
“Of course! I mean, who would not want to say, ‘thanks’ after getting something this awesome?”<br />
<br />
“Oh please,” Mrs. Thompson blushes, “that’s too nice.”<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s better to overdo it than to underdo it, right?”<br />
<br />
“In most cases like this, yes, but let me go get something first.”<br />
<br />
Mrs. Thompson goes to her storage room while letting her long brunette hair go down as she searches. A minute passes once the chemistry teacher finds a rectangular black piece of paper. She then leaves her storage room, completely covers her classroom door window with the paper, and locks the door. She lets her d-cup tits bounce as she goes to the windows and closes them. <br />
<br />
“Oh,” Sean comments, “good thinking.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Mrs. Thompson says, her blue eyes gazing at Sean. “We don’t want anyone to find out our secret, do we?”<br />
<br />
“Nope, so are you ready?” Sean asks.<br />
<br />
“Ready as I’ll ever be!” Mrs. Thompson answers.<br />
<br />
“Great! Now, Talia Thompson, I wish that you would become a handsome DILF teacher who’s bound to get popular with the female students.”<br />
<br />
It is right there that marked the beginning of Talia’s changes. Before long, she begins to feel a strong tingling sensation in her reproductive system.<br />
<br />
“Right off the bat, huh?” Sean comments.<br />
<br />
“Looks like it,” Talia replies.<br />
<br />
Talia strips off her yellow skirt and light green panties to confirm what’s happening. Then she finds it: her swelling clitoris. Talia grins at what she sees as bumps begin to develop around her labia. Sperm replaces her egg cells, and her ovaries move downward as her new testicles finish forming. Both her fallopian tubes and uterus vanish, while her womb rearranges itself to become Talia’s prostate. During this entire part, her clit has grown to around four inches, and it’s not going to stop there. Once her vagina closes up with her cervix, her clitoris doubles in size while letting foreskin cover her soon-to-be cock. Only a second later, her pubic hair thickens up significantly, and a tip forms on her new penis when it becomes a nine incher, officially making him reproductively male.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit!” Sean yells. “That’s almost as impressive as mine, and I’m just a student here!”<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” Talia Thompson replies, “but we already know that my changes are just beginning.”<br />
<br />
Talia’s torso is next. When he feels a cramping sensation, it forces him to take off his white tank top. Sean and Talia watch as the latter’s womanly curves get destroyed by testosterone. Eventually, they get to the point where Talia’s tummy converts into a washboard stomach and matches his now narrow hips. Talia looks down and notices that his body hair is creating a swirly line to connect his pubic hair to his belly button. His spine grows up in height until Talia stands well over six feet tall, and during that time, his skin hardens until it loses all of its softness. Meanwhile, his perky breasts quickly shrink down along with his darkening nipples to accommodate his awesome new form, and they form into large pectoral muscles one minute later. Once again, thick hair sprouts out, this time coming from his chest and distributing around it. <br />
<br />
Not long after that, Talia’s shoulders widen as his biceps gain much more muscle, making his arms more masculine than feminine. The same phrase can be commented on his legs because they lost their shapely form as they toned while gaining more muscle in them. Alongside that, Talia’s bum has lost its soft flesh as it became tighter and firmer in response to the muscle replacing its fat. His arm and leg hair become much more prominent than ever as they spread out around them. Once the transformation gets to both Talia’s hands and feet, he feels them becoming bigger and more meaty to appropriately suit his increasingly small nails on both of them. This forces Talia to take off the remnants of his clothes, including his white chacos, and leave him naked.<br />
<br />
Talia’s neck shifts almost immediately after his hands completely finish changing. His neck thickens out and makes room for a lump to form. That lump soon turns out to be Talia’s Adam’s apple, while he moans to respond to this as his soprano swiftly drops to a powerful baritone. Talia feels his face contorting as his transformation gets closer to its climax. First, stubble grows around Talia’s lips as the latter thins and becomes less pouty in the process. Second, his jaw sharpens as it becomes rounded to be straight. His cheekbones raise up slightly as Talia’s forehead and chin get more prominent in addition to that. Third, his eyelashes decrease in size, his eyebrows doing the exact opposite. Meanwhile, Talia’s eyes themselves sink deep into his skull as they become more ovular during that time. Last but not least, Talia’s hair recedes back to his scalp until he is left with a comb-over and an undercut to go with it.<br />
<br />
Talia goes to the closest mirror and looks at himself. What he sees is exactly what Sean commanded it to be: a sexy dilf in his thirdies who’s bound to get popular with the girls.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god,” Talia comments in amazement. “I already can’t wait for my students’ reaction to this, especially the girls.”<br />
<br />
“Well, Mrs. Thompson,” Sean asks, “or should I call you Tad Thompson? I’m guessing you cherish your new form as much as I enjoy mine.”<br />
<br />
“That’s correct, young man,” Tad answers. “However, I wouldn’t really tell anyone about how I became this, especially to Ty since he had his powers before I made you take it from him.”<br />
<br />
“Smart thinking. Worst case scenario: Ty gets ideas on how to get his powers back or something like that.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but what should we do next?”</p>
<hr/><h3>
What should Sean and Tad do next?</h3>
