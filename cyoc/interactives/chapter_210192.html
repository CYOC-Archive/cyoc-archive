<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks Krentol for the help!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy stopped talking. A foul smell, like a dirty barnyard crossed with the noxious odors of a swamp, wafted into his nose. He coughed, trying to wave the pungent scent away, but instead, the smell seemed to intensify. Had someone farted? He looked up at the Judge just in time to see his nose flatten and grow into a pig’s snout.<br />
<br />
“Is everything okay, Mr…SNORT!” The judge blinked as his ears began to grow and flop onto his face. “Wha-REEeeee! SNORT!”<br />
<br />
The Judge’s face began to soften as it filled with fat, his clothes disappearing, showing off a pink, bloating body. Troy gasped. It was happening again! The entire courtroom was filled with squeaks and squeals and chitters and bleats and moos, as though everyone was turning into rancid barnyard animals.<br />
<br />
He looked around and confirmed it. A man struggling to conceal his heavy bull balls, a woman mooing in horror as a big bag of udders grew from her stomach. The changes were going relatively slowly-relatively as in about thirty seconds-and appeared to be striking each person one at a time. Everyone, that is, except for the Arabic man next to the skunk.<br />
<br />
Troy couldn’t stop watching the scene, blinking slowing as he saw everyone transforming. Then he stopped blinking altogether as his eyelids slowly pulled back, replaced by a clear lens-scale. New, reptilian eyes gazed out at what Troy knew was the likely culprit - The only man who hadn’t changed.<br />
<br />
The Arabic man was staring at Troy coldly. Only now did Troy notice the golden bands on his wrists and the strange purple eyes the man had. A genie! He was under attack by Myth, he realized. This wasn’t impossible, Troy thought.  He could beat him, all he had to do-<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the taste of rotting wood and stagnant water filled Troy’s mouth. He tried to say something, but all that came out of his throat was a rancid burp that smelt of carrion as a small lump of partially digested meat began pressing out against Troy’s increasingly tubular stomach that was extending up into the middle of his chest. The foul aftertaste and increasing feeling of fullness was disturbingly satisfying, so much so that he began to drool. Troy raised his hands to wipe his mouth but… <br />
<br />
He no longer had arms, just simple fleshy protrusions extending from his shoulders. <br />
<br />
The skin between his armpits and elbows had formed into a thick webbing that pulled his arms tight to his sides. To make matters worse, his bones and muscles were fading, the flap of skin growing tighter against his chest. With all his strength, Troy tried to point at the genie, but the taut skin restricted his elbow and the webbing between his fingers was pulling them together. As he watched, his finger bones crushed themselves together and then slowly vanished, leaving him with a fleshy flipper that was rapidly retracted. The skin grew tighter and tighter and then Troy no longer had arms, not even a hint of shoulders as his skin continued to tighten, constricting him.<br />
<br />
Troy tried to get up and run, but putting any weight on his legs was a mistake. He fell back into his seat and stared in horror at his lower body. His clothes had vanished at some point when he was staring at his loss of arms, so he could see everything that was happening to him.<br />
<br />
His legs were rubbing tightly together, the muscles and bones creaking as skin folds pressed them together. Troy’s feet no longer existed, just a tapering end of a tail. Dirty brown and green-patterned scales began to cover his lower body, spreading up his torso with each tight constriction of his skin. He wheezed and gasped as a slit formed around the base of his cock and balls, squeezing them, his testicles nauseatingly retracting into his body. Troy’s cock grew stiff and impossibly tense, swelling wider and thicker. His member slowly strained, skin becoming smooth and glistening, then the tip of his cock pulled itself apart. Troy’s breath came out in a jerking rush as his shafts fully pulled apart into a hemipenes, the sensation foreign.<br />
<br />
Troy felt tickles as his hair fell down onto his increasing scaly and tube-like form. Small cracks and pops went off as his face grew and pressed out into reptilian angle and ridges. His neck creaking as it stretched forwards, Troy woozily flicking his tongue, the smells of the room suddenly assaulting him.  His jaws creaked and popped painlessly as more dull brown and green scales covered his widening face and flattening skull.<br />
<br />
More vertebrae popping into existence in his back and his lengthening body flopped out of his chair into his own coils. The world around him was shrinking with each constricting pulse of his skin as it squeezed him into a proper shape for a python. More tingles and pops went off in his brain as his skull deformed.<br />
<br />
His thoughts began to slow, tongue flicking and tasting the air. He needed to stop this, needed to get at least himself out of this predicament. Even if that meant prison.<br />
<br />
“Ssssshhhsssss!” Troy hissed angrily. He tried again. “Sssssshhhhhhhssss!”<br />
<br />
Troy’s tongue flickered in his vision and he could taste the air in the room. It was a foul smelling mixture of swamp, manure, skunk spray, musk and mud-all mixed in with other things that his simplifying python brain understood as food. It was over, he knew it, and as his brain began to shrink away into nothing more than a large nerve cluster, the python heard the genie one last time.<br />
<br />
“Granted!” The Genie boomed, then vanished from the chaotic, stinking courtroom.<br />
<br />
The python tried to speak again, but only belched more foul rot from its gullet. Its scaly skin shivered and then contracted for one last time, squeezing the snake even smaller. Troy’s thoughts were squeezed from his mind as the dome of his skull flattened. The large, half-digested rabbit in his stomach bulged around the smelly snake’s middle. It felt full and lethargic, and quietly slithered into a safe, dark corner of the witness stand to fully digest its meal.</p>
