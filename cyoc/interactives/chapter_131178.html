<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny Smith, the sexy blonde 16 year old girl who had just a little ago become a little boy, sat on her bed pondering her plan to get Kyle Perkins to remove the curse he had put on her. All she had to do was go to Kyle&#39;s place, or simply bump into him anywhere else, looking like an unassuming, innocent boy so that Kyle wouldn&#39;t be on his guard. Then she would ask him transform or dare, and force him to remove the curse off her forever. It was simple but bound to work, Jen thought... <br />
Jenny suddenly noticed the window. Was it getting dark already? She checked the time...it was past 8 pm! &quot;Hmm, damn it, it&#39;s probably better of I go looking for Kyle tomorrow in the daytime... it would be a little suspicious for a young schoolboy to be wandering around town alone in the evening... yeah, I&#39;ll do this tomorrow, it&#39;s better!&quot; She reasoned. In actuality, Jen was maybe also a teeny bit afraid to confront Perkins, disguised or not... &quot;Well, I&#39;d better take these dumb boy clothes off then&quot; she thinks, &quot;No use staying as this little brat any longer than I need to!&quot; <br />
Jennifer undoes her tie and she begins to feel that slightly painful tingly sensation creeping in. When she opens the top button of the crisp white shirt, she starts to already feel her breasts growing back and pressing against the tightening fabric! She continues to unbutton until the boobs finally pop out of the open shirt as if freed from bondage. Jen tossed the discarded shirt down and as she was growing taller and her hair lenghtened mid back and turned more and more blonde, she felt the male package shrivel away into nothingness inside her briefs! She felt mostly relieved and glad to have her vagina back, although very interestingly, a small small part of Jenny felt a sort of dread at the loss of her very recently acquired manhood... Weird! Jen shrugs off the alien thought, must be some lingering piece of the little boy&#39;s mind which didn&#39;t fully die out yet. Jen definitely didn&#39;t like being a stupid male and the feeling of having a penis! She&#39;s a straight young woman, through and through!... <br />
...Once fully naked, Jennifer was completely returned to normal and she decided it was best to stay nude, considering the nature of the curse, this way only could she avoid any alterations. She was folding the boy&#39;s uniform for tomorrow morning, when she noticed the uniform&#39;s blue blazer was still on the bed, untouched. She goes to it and picks it up, looking at it for a second. &quot;Hmm, this is the only piece of the outfit that I didn&#39;t put on earlier... Oh well, you&#39;ll have to wait till tomorrow mister!&quot; <br />
Jen layed the jacket over the shirt, on the clothes hanger on her wardrobe&#39;s door, thinking of flirt chatting with her boyfriend next, but...her eyes lingered on that jacket a bit longer... It was a pretty prim and elegant looking three button blazer...formal looking but also kind of cute on top of the short trousers! Jenny giggled. She notices the embroidered Maplefield private School for Boys Insignia on the left side of the blazer&#39;s chest. Jen remembers her father went to this prestigious school, and sometimes she overheard him say to his friends that if only he had a son instead of a daughter he would have surely sent him to Maplefield and continue the family tradition... Of course, since it&#39;s an all boy school, Jenny couldn&#39;t be admitted. She ended up doing public school instead, which she quite frankly prefferred actually. Not some boring haughty stuffy old place! <br />
She gently touches the Insignia with her finger, feeling its bass relief of fine embroidery... It sure looked and felt, well, prestigious. Not just the Insignia though, the whole uniform. The idea itself of imposed formalwear, even. Jen always disliked stuffy, formal things, but now she realizes that really it&#39;s more because of her dad and his obnoxious conservative ways! ...as she continues to gently caress that fabric, Jennifer closed her eyes and fantasized for a second. She pictured the classy, old fashioned and stern halls of a place like Maplefield School, and the dashing, sophisticated young men there... so not like the guys that she&#39;s ever known or dated... She bites her lip, feeling slightly flushed between her nude thighs, and she caresses the jackets sleeves up and down while picturing those classy guys in her mind... The charming and gentlemanly seniors, suave and impeccably dressed... the cute younger freshmen, with their short trousers and untucked shirts, a little awkward but looking at the older boys in admiration, aspiring to become like them... Jen smiled as she imagined being the girlfriend of one such guy, and sneaking in through his dorm window at night to be with him secretly... &quot;Since no girls are allowed in the Boys only School...&quot; She whispers to herself. She fingers her clit and smiles as an even better fantasy pops into her mind... No girls in the school? Well that&#39;s a good idea, no girls needed in this love story! Jen imagines a young freshman with his short trousers and blue blazer, being courted by a handsome, older student, the beginning of a friendship and romance relationship... the older boy would be his mentor and lover... Jenny stops fingering herself for a moment and stares intently at the uniform on the hanger. Without thinking she quickly grabs the clothes, her breath a bit heavy, and she ogles it with desire in her eyes. &quot;Fuck am I doing?&quot; She speaks. Long pause. &quot;Ok screw it, I want to put this on...&quot; Jenny gives in and starts getting dressed... &quot;Only because I want to see how it all looks together, with the blazer too, I mean! Absolutely no other reason. And only for a minute. Then off with this silly...but kinda elegant, uh, crap...!&quot; <br />
Horny and with her cheeks flushed red, Jenny hastily dressed herself, welcoming the slight pain as the changes begin. When she buttoned up the white Oxford shirt she muttered to herself &quot;Come on boobs, take a hike!&quot; and when they shrunk and flattened a victorious &quot;Hah!&quot; escaped her lips! She grinned as she shrunk shorter, her skintone and eyes darkened and her hair went from long, blonde and straight to pitch black, curly and very short. By the time she finished buttoning her collar and cuffs her beautiful face had once again fully changed into the cute, youthful and a bit puckish face of the boy she had changed into earlier. Eagerly Jenny takes the black tie and just as she slides it under her raised shirt collar, she feels her clit and labia starting to swell! She concentrated on tying her necktie right and with each slide and pinch she felt her cock push out, she felt her ovaries drop, turning into testicles and filling the new scrotum, she knew her womb also became a prostate and as she finished her nice Windsor knot and folded her collar back down, Jennifer Smith&#39;s new face was plastered with satisfaction. Satisfied for how elegant she looked, of course, but more importantly satisfied, euphoric of the fact that her transformation was completed, happy and satisfied that she was no longer a 16 year old girl, but a cute 13 year old boy instead! Satisfied that she had a penis now! (Jenny might also be satisfied and she&#39;d appreciate it if I stopped refering to her in female pronouns and started calling her a &quot;he&quot; already :P ...which I shall!) <br />
The new boy smiled in anticipation as he pulls on his shorts and briefs to check on his new dick. His smile widens when he sees the semi erect male member. &quot;Yeah! My dick is awesome!&quot; He says out loud in his new masculine voice. Then he eagerly picks up the uniform blazer and puts it on, completing his outfit finally. He goes in front of the tall mirror to admire himself. He loved it!  He straightened his jacket and adjusted his tie snugly against the collar, he put his glasses on and went close to the mirror. He gave his reflection a loving, horny kiss on the mouth. His raging erection was tenting his trousers now. &quot;I&#39;m so cute and handsome... Hey, if I think about it, my dad technically has a son now, hahaha! Yeah, pity this isn&#39;t for real though... If I actually was this little boy my dad would&#39;ve been so proud, I would&#39;ve actually went to private school and had a totally different life... Hell, if I would&#39;ve been born a boy Jenny wouldn&#39;t even exist, I sure wouldn&#39;t be called Jenny!... I know, I&#39;ll rename myself, just for fun! Hmm... Ok, so... I&#39;m not Jenny, she is gone, I&#39;ll be Richard now! Yeah, I like it!&quot; <br />
Suddenly, there is s knock on the front door!! Panicking, the &quot;boy&quot; rushes downstairs to see who the hell it could be... He takes a peek and it was none other than Kyle Perkins!... What was he doing here? What does he want?...</p>
