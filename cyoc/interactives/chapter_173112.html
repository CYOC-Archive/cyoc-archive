<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kenny and Kelly lifted their heads out of the transformational pool, their hair fell limp and heavy as it was soaked with water now. Kelly had to pull her hair out of her eyes in order to see Rose and Nate standing on the beach waiting for them to get out of the pool. That was a little bit of a surprise for Kenny and Kelly, Rose was in medical school with dreams of becoming a doctor while Nate was studying computer design and while Rose may be able to do medicine underwater now there was no way Nate could work on computers under the water. <br />
“You two are becoming merpeople?” inquired Kenny amazed.<br />
“A chance to explore the ocean and see a whole magical new world who could turn that down.” Said Nate with a grin. <br />
Beside him Rose was trying to hold herself back, none of her friends…well maybe Taylor did because of how long they have been friends knew that Rose loved mermaids. She had loved mermaids since she was a little girl and she had almost bought mermaid tail swimsuits multiple times. She even had a few…adult toys which she had, and she and Nate had rolled played with in their apartment before. She could not turn down this chance to live out her dream and Nate loved her too much not to join her. <br />
“Well let’s get out of the pool and let you two in.” said Kenny as he and Kelly pulled themselves out of the pool and began to drag themselves across the sand. <br />
“See you in the water!” yelled Kelly as she and Kenny entered the water. <br />
“Thank you for coming with me.” Said Rose as she turned around and pulled Nate down to her level and gave him a deep kiss. She pulled away and stepped into the pool, she stood there for a moment extending her hand to Nate which he took and he followed her in. <br />
They lied down and when they did their bodies lifted off the ground as they began to float. Both of them let out a low moan as the water began its work. In the water Nate twisted and pulled off his swimtrunks and threw out of the pool, while Rose had kept on her bikini. <br />
“Going Random?” inquired Rose. <br />
“Yes, I don’t really want an all-black tail.” explained Nate as Rose nodded her head in understanding.<br />
They both enjoyed the relaxing feel of the water as the magic did it’s work, a scar on Nate’s chest disappeared along with some other scars. An old ankle injury from high school healed as well not that he would have an ankle for long either. Similar stuff was happening to Rose as every mark left her body, leaving only a few freckles which remained because of her strong Irish heritage. Other minor changes happened all the hair as well minus Nate’s crazy mess of blonde hair, Rose’s shoulder length red hair and their eyebrows fell off their bodies and discovered in the water. <br />
“This feels so nice.” Said Rose as her neck elongated a bit, she noticed that on Kelly and Amanda as well as her body became its perfect self, her eyes grew a little larger as she looked toward Nate. <br />
“Thank you for doing this again.” said Rose as Nate smiled and rolled to his side, his back never touching the bottom. <br />
“Well…how could I live without you and besides you as a sexy mermaid I can’t wait to see that.” Stated Nate as he moved one of his hands behind her neck and pulled her into a gentle kiss. As they shared a tender kiss on the surface, their bodies began to lower as with a slight wince of pain their gills opened. When they did their heads dropped below the surface, their hair now heavier acted as if they where on land. <br />
Nate removed his lips from Rose’s and instead began to kiss down her neck. Rose arched her neck giving him more room causing her to moan his name as he moved on top of her straddling her a bit as he kissed down her body between her breasts and down her stomach toward her womanhood. Before he even reached her womanhood, her red bikini had changed, her red bikini bottom was now red scales. To his credit or maybe it was the magic for he too had scales now, but he didn’t miss a beat as he began to pleasure her with his tongue. <br />
Rose moaned in pleasure as she began to rub her breasts with one of her hands while the other gripped the soft sand of the pool. She didn’t even notice that while she was lost in her pleasure and the love of the man, soon to be merman doing it that her breasts which was an A cup grew a bit to either a large A or a small B cup. She did it to herself, she was always self-concise about her small breasts and now she had a larger set. She reached a peak she never thought possible and began to head back down as Nate moved back up to beside her. <br />
“I love you so much…” moaned Rose as Nate gave her a playful grin as she nuzzled into his neck and chest. <br />
“My pleasure.” Said Nate as he raised an eyebrow at his girlfriend’s now larger chest, as he watched the red bikini began to change, the straps over her shoulders moved to become a single strap which rapped around her neck and covered the entire top of her chest minus her shoulders. It was skintight, mostly red but with some pink and white highlights around the edges. It reminded him of one of her favorite tops back in their apartments and it likely had an open back.<br />
Both of them looked down at their feet, Rose wasn’t surprised to see her legs where quickly one single tail which was mostly red, her favorite color but with some pinks mixed in with some white around her waist and the gills. The thing that caused her to raise an eyebrow was that Nate’s tail was a mix of different shades of orange with some black mixed in. They watched as they finished transforming and became fully merfolk.<br />
“Well…I guess we have to get out of here and make room for whomever is next.” Said Nate as both of them lifted their heads out of the water to see.</p>
