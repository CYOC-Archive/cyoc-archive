<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You took a deep breath, and sighed gently getting a feel for your enlarged breasts, and ass for yourself. Touching them made you feel tingly, and it comforted you in a way despite your vagina being fully exposed. Just then a couple guys walked into the bar casually all dressed up in street clothes, and stared at your body almost immediately upon entering. &quot;Hey guys this is Sasha she&#39;s our new waitress here, and she&#39;s available for pleasure. Keep in mind she still is new so be gentle at first.&quot; Charles said <br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s nice to see a change around here for once, especially since it&#39;s this.&quot; One man spoke up, and walked up to you. The man was taller, and broader than you, and he almost mad you whimper.&quot;So, Sasha was it? I hope you don&#39;t take offense to me saying your body is hot.&quot; The man said, and put his hand on your shoulder. <br />
<br />
You suddenly remembered your job,&quot; Don&#39;t be, I&#39;m much more than a waitress you know.&quot; You said moving the man&#39;s hand to your breast,&quot;Besides why stop at my shoulders, when my girls are right here? Go ahead don&#39;t be too shy now the first time is always free with me.&quot; You said, and you saw the man nod as he gently squeezed your breast a few times then sat down, shocked by your reaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what about you? You wouldn&#39;t be interested in little ole me right?&quot; You circled the second man brushing your tail over his chest. &quot;Well it is your first night, so why don&#39;t I give you a warm welcome from me to you. You seem like a foxy gal who&#39;s up for anything.&quot; The second man said grabbing your arm, and pulling you in for a hug. You felt the man&#39;s hand on your ass, and felt it get gripped slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you guys are a milk churner, and an ass man doesn&#39;t really matter though in the end. If you need me just holler, and I&#39;ll be right with you gentlemen.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh uh miss Sasha just a quick question, why is your uh feminine area out front showing?&quot; The second man asked, and the first man hit the other,&quot;Hey respect the woman&#39;s privacy, and freedom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh honey it&#39;s fine, if I was shy about showing it then why aren&#39;t I covering it. As I said said I&#39;m more than just a waitress, you may toy with my body however you please, but don&#39;t get too rough with me or else I&#39;ll have to claw that little face of yours.&quot; You said showing the men your claws.<br />
<br />
Those men were the first of many to ask that question, and a few others like,&quot;Can I get a lap dance? or, Mind if I get a bit kinky?&quot; There were also guys who were nice, and polite to you and you were polite back. Throughout the night you were played with multiple times, guys with your boobs, guys with your ass, there were even a few guys who tickled your pussy, and the area around it. As you and Charles began closing up you asked,&quot;You think I was getting a little too into it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not for being new, hell I was surprised you already had guys playing with your vagina back there. In the end you were nice to have here, and a few guys commented that you were a stripper with limits, and feelings. But those feelings felt pleasant, and not sorrowful towards them, like you aren&#39;t supporting a family, but in search of one almost. The other comments were on your body, and a few wanted to get with you privately if you catch my drift.&quot; Charles said <br />
<br />
&quot;Well if they do you know what to do. I have to admit a lot of those guys seemed nice, but your bar does have it&#39;s bunch of perverts who got a bit too far. I just told them that they better tone it down, and held out a claw. But I have to admit it seems odd being the only waitress here, not that you would need anyone else.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, thanks to the lab guys I really don&#39;t pay you, but you always come back, or get experimented on if you refuse to. That is if your not taking time off for personal reasons, you know I may put in a request just so you don&#39;t get lonely here.&quot; Charles said <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you a pimp now? I mean it wouldn&#39;t be bad, I&#39;d like a new face but I can&#39;t stop thinking about my body. I actually think I want to embrace myself fully actually, just an off topic question, but do you know about any breeding programs involving the scientists? I mean I can&#39;t be the only test subject right?&quot; You asked partially blushing.<br />
<br />
Charles looked at you and smiled,&quot;Well I heard a few rumors about a program like that, ask around and see what you can dig up. On the meantime I&#39;ll see about doing something for you in the future, anyways the elevator is probably on it&#39;s way topside, see ya Sash.&quot; Charles said <br />
<br />
As the elevator reached you a scientist stepped out,&quot;I hope she didn&#39;t give you much trouble Charles.&quot; The scientist said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shut it Jon the only reason she was probably cross with you is because you were agitating her over her transformation. I keep telling you sciency types that if you were to ever do something like this find people who have nothing to live for, and do it to them. Help them into their transformation, and don&#39;t give them restrictions to reveal themselves, but at the same time give them an initiative not to. Anyways Sasha here was probably as helpful as she possibly could, and she&#39;s still adapting to her body too, so what the hell. I thought you would give me a person who was completely adapted beforehand.&quot; Charles said pissed<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey we were out of options, and your order was due to arrive soon so we improvised.&quot; Jon said <br />
<br />
&quot;You seem a lot less threatening than you once were,&quot; you said chuckling,&quot;this is priceless.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut it you furry, stay out of this.&quot; Jon said <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, she was legitimately helpful with business here, don&#39;t use that against her.&quot; Charles said <br />
<br />
Jon sighed,&quot;Sorry it&#39;s just an outburst I have those from time to time. As for you miss Sasha we should report back to your room, you seem more willing now considering what Charles said is true.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, it&#39;s quite alright JON you can just call me Sasha if you let me call you by your name, heh. But all jokes aside let&#39;s go, and I actually have a few questions for you Jon.&quot; You said as you followed Jon into the elevator.<br />
