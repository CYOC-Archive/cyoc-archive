<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I need a moment. Where is the bathroom?&quot; Sarah asked. She didn&#39;t notice Adam&#39;s hand slapping against the red button while mocking her, so she took the opportunity to check herself out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right around the corner.&quot; Robin said, pointing her finger in the general direction of the room. Sarah quickly entered the room and locked the door behind her, not wanting to get caught groping herself. If only she knew what would happen outside in that exact moment. Adam felt weird for a moment, as if an electric pulse rushed through his entire body. But as fast as the feeling came, it was gone. Actually, he couldn&#39;t even remember that ever happening at all a few moments after.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Sarah pulled down her top, showing off far more cleavage just before diving in with her hands. They were definitely real but strangely firm at the same time and... full? It was hard for her to pinpoint it since she never had any boobs to begin with. She turned sideways to take a good look at her much improved butt. It looked like she spent hours at the gym a week just to tone it some more while not losing any of the fatty goodness. It felt soft and hard both at once, a new feeling for Sarah to discover.<br />
<br />
After a good five minutes of nonstop groping, she flushed the toilet and headed back to her friends. She saw everyone except one: Adam. But in his place was a tall, muscular man with his back towards her, standing only a few feet away from the red button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, who is that?&quot; Sarah said out loud. Paul laughed as he couldn&#39;t believe her bad sense of humor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, good joke, Sarah!&quot; He said sarcastically. Sarah was wondering why he was so calm about it, but as soon as the hunk turned around she understood what he meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adam?&quot; Sarah said in shock. She was always pretty tall for a woman, standing at 5&#39;7&quot;. Originally, Adam was a few inches taller than her, at 6&#39;1&quot;, but now he was towering above her at 6&#39;8&quot;, more than two metres tall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that&#39;s me. What&#39;s with you today? Were you up all night or what?&quot; Adam said with sincerity. He obviously didn&#39;t realize what has happened to him.<br />
<br />
Not only was he very tall now, but equally gifted with muscles as well. He was easily as big as any bodybuilder, if not a tad bigger. His arms had to be about 20 inches around. His shoulder were wide and strong while his pecs stood proud on his chest. His ripped 6-pack looked carved from stone and his legs were broad and defined.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way! So that button is magical after all!&quot; She exclaimed with excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not this. I thought we had that already. The &#39;magical boobie button&#39;, again?&quot; Adam was more annoyed than anything by now.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m being serious here! I wasn&#39;t this curvy half an hour ago, and you were never this tall or muscular to begin with. The button must fulfill wishes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously? A wish fulfilling button in a random house from a random guy?&quot; Adam shook his head at first, but thought of it for a second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, how else could I have these?&quot; Sarah tried to reason, shoving up her generous breasts. Meanwhile Robin was fire red. She thought that Sarah used the button as yet another excuse to steal Adam from her with her sexy body.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re saying, if I were to press this button again, my wish would come true?&quot; Adam asked rhetorically as he reached for the button. It was at that moment that Sarah knew she should&#39;ve kept her mouth shut instead of talking stories about magic devices.<br />
<br />
Another short, but more powerful shock went through Adam&#39;s body. He looked surprised at first, but quickly was back to normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;See? Everything is as it has always been!&quot; Adam stated as he began to grow right in front of Sarah&#39;s eyes. Everyone else seemed to be oblivious to the changes and looked at Sarah, wondering why her face was changing from a look of joy to puppy eyes with the rest of her face reflecting fear. They figured it had to be Adam, but Sarah should be used to him by now.<br />
<br />
Adam was always very tall. Well, very, very tall. Exceptionally tall. He utterly dwarfed anyone he ever saw at his monumental 10&#39;2&quot;. While he was incredibly tall to begin with, his natural muscle mass was straight up astonishing. He sported biceps the size of pumpkins... well, if he had been about six feet tall. These ones were scaled up to his height. His traps and shoulder muscles partly engulfed his head while his back was chiseled to perfection. His bloated, steel-hard pecs blocked his sight of anyone directly in front of him. He couldn&#39;t even see his shredded 8-pack which had deep crevices and dozens of obliques around them. One of his legs alone was bigger than most people they knew and held miraculous amounts of strength.<br />
<br />
Sarah got out of her daydream and looked ahead. The first thing she saw was Adam&#39;s huge crotch. Even at his size it was far too large. And he&#39;s already this big while being soft! He had a literal baseball bat hidden under his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I, uhm, y-you-&quot; Sarah stuttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; Adams deep and masculine voice boomed through the entire room, making her and especially Robin wet in an instant.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-Nothing. Looking good today!&quot; Sarah decided not to talk too much about it, partly because of fear and partly because of her stiff nipples underneath the top.</p>
