<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Let’s do it now.” stated Rachel, she was actually fighting back the urge to jump on her hellish soon to be wife and part of her remembered her talk with her father this afternoon. <br />
<br />
“Alright.” said Lilith as the Queen of Hell stood up, her horns brushing the ceiling of the apartment before she turned and waved toward a nearby wall. A burst of flame opened up but it didn’t catch anything one fire but instead it extended outwards into another room.<br />
<br />
“Come on Rachel.” said Maisy as she took Rachel by the hand and gave her a loving squeeze before together, they stepped through the portal.<br />
<br />
Instantly the smell of a strange incest hit Rachel, she couldn’t place it but it reminded her of a twisted version of some of the stuff her father had burned around the church to call upon God. The room was made of black marble with red inlays or was that actually moving lava she couldn’t tell. The portal closed and she could spot a door behind them, much taller than herself. It towered over Maisy who had to be around 7 feet tall now at least, while before them was another door equally as tall and flanked by two stone statues of hooded figures, one holding a sword the other a set of scales.<br />
<br />
“Where are we?” inquired Rachel.<br />
<br />
“The main shrine within the palace at the heart of the 9th circle of hell, the seat of my father.” explained Maisy as Lilith opened a door on the far side of the room. <br />
<br />
“Wow….” Said Rachel as before her was a massive and she meant massive gothic style chamber, massive stone pillars of black and red marble polished to a perfect shine, impossible stain glass windows showing not images form the bible but instead multiple different demons and hellish figures filled the room with a reddish light. <br />
<br />
“My Queen….my Princess.” Said a hooded figure who looked humanoid aside from the fact that he had the lower body of what looked to be a scorpion. “How can this humble servant serve you?”<br />
<br />
“My daughter has chosen a mate, we need the high priest to prepare the ceremony of transformation.” Explained Lilith as the Priest nodded his head. <br />
<br />
“At once, your grace.” Stated the figure as he moved off on all six of his legs. <br />
<br />
It took only a few minutes, but Rachel was too busy studying every inch of just this small part of this building. She had always loved architecture and this was both horrific yet impossible beautiful at the same time.<br />
<br />
“My Queen.” Said an older figure, he had a bat like face with batlike wings coming off his back while his feet were impossible sharp talons. “I understand your daughter has chosen a mate, and you want to go through the process of transformation.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Lilith as she turned her gaze toward Rachel and Maisy.<br />
<br />
 Maisy gave a small wave while Rachel looked at the Priest in a mixture of excitement, confusion and a little bit of fear.<br />
<br />
“Very well, follow me.” Said the Priest as the three of them followed the Priest toward a side door which led to a set of stairs which descended downwards. There was no sign of wall torches, instead the black stone had lines of glowing red which gave off more then enough light for the demons to see and was just enough for Rachel to see.<br />
<br />
Finally they exited the circling steps and stepped into what looked to be a cave of some kind. The walls were rough stone but every could o feet where stone pillars of red and black stone. Here flaming torches gave light. The floor was of the same rough stone, however dominating the room was a massive pool which had to be about the length of a Olympic size swimming pool. Multiple statues stood around it, some with outstretch swords others holding blackish serving pitchers and others seemed to be leaning over. All of them had blackish water flowing out of them and into the pool.<br />
<br />
“Stand here.” Ordered the Priest as Rachel and Maisy stood at the foot of the pool, while the Priest and Lilith headed to the other end of the pool. As they did more priest and priestess began to appear around the statues and began to chant while some placed torches into the water which caught fire like it was oil. <br />
<br />
“We are ready.” Stated the Priest as his voice boomed from the other end of the hall. “Come to me human, leave your humanity behind and enter the waters, shed your human flesh and become a demon, come into darkness.”<br />
<br />
“So I enter the water?” inquired Rachel<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed the Priest “Come into darkness.”<br />
<br />
 “I love you, so much.” Said Maisy with true love in her voice as she gave Rachel’s human lips one last kiss before pulling away.  “I’ll see you on the other side.”<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Said Rachel as she took a deep breath and stepped into the flaming liquid, the fire should have been warm it should have burned her but it felt warm. <br />
<br />
It was strange as she stepped into the liquid, the fire didn’t burn away her flesh or hair, but it did burn away everything else. She was about to cover herself when the pool got deep enough to cover her breasts as she kept walking. For a moment she thought she would have to swim the rest of the way but both of her feet wouldn’t leave the bottom of the pool so she kept walking. She took one last breath before submerging.<br />
<br />
The water was pitch black and she couldn’t see anything in front of her, but it felt so good that she wasn’t afraid. <br />
<br />
What she didn’t know was that her human soul was being transformed and changed, her lungs should have been burning but instead she felt as peace as she kept walking. <br />
<br />
She didn’t know how deep the pool was, but she could now see shadows cast from the burning fire above. There were more statues down here, all much taller than her and with horrify imaginary but with each step the statues seamed less horrifying, more welcoming and slightly shorter as well. She felt bones pop and felt flesh rip as her human body was changed as well as her human soul.<br />
<br />
Maisy stood beside her mother, her heart racing like it had never had before. She hadn’t felt these nerves in her entire life, outside of possibly when she told Rachel about who she really was.<br />
<br />
Finally, the surface of the pool nearest to them began to ripple as Rachel began to come out of the water.<br />
<br />
The first thing that came up was her hair. Rachel had been a natural blonde and that hadn’t change, in fact somehow she had become even more blonde. Her long hair, something Maisy had loved about her remained but growing out her forehead was pair of ram horns which shot up before curving down to about her ear line. The horns where a shade of neon blue which stood out against her blonde hair and her now pure white skin. <br />
<br />
Rachel’s face still had a lot of the same traits they had as a human but more graceful and elegant, her eyes which had been blue where now an impossible neon blue. Her lips were also neon blue, her neck was longer and more elegant. As she came out of the water, Maisy noticed a neon blue line of scales which wrapped around the top of Rachel’s shoulder blades before going down to a sharp V point between her now much larger and fuller breasts. Rachel as a human had larger breasts than Maisy in her human form, now she had larger breasts as a demon as she did as a human. Her nipples were neon blue as well. As she came out of the water she began to take on a more demon-like appearance.<br />
<br />
There was a rush of movement as a pair of wings, wings which reminded Maisy of what humans would call pterodactyl but with neon blue scales and bright white flesh stretched out wide from Rachel’s shoulders.<br />
<br />
Her arms were slightly too long, her nails which where also blue where also too sharp, sharp enough to be able to cut someone throat. At her elbows and her knees where blue scale patches which came to sharp point which would be also capable of punching through metal almost as if she was wearing spiked knee and elbow pads.<br />
<br />
What Maisy couldn’t see is that the scales which started around Rachel’s shoulders ran down her spin in folding scales which could be called up to be razor sharp spike before passing between her new set of wings before going down to her new tail which was long and narrow with a single large spike at the end. <br />
<br />
Rachel stepped out of the pool on scale covered feet which had one toe much higher with a single large claw like a Velociraptor.<br />
<br />
“So how do I look?” inquired Rachel, she had also grown in height to be almost equal to Maisy if one didn’t count the antlers growing from her head.<br />
<br />
“Amazing, like always.” answered Maisy as she placed her hand on the small of Rachel’s back and pulled her into a deep kiss.</p>
