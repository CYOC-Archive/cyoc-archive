<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Remi, age fifteen, sat up suddenly, confused and only partially unaware that he was in his room. Looking about, he suddenly remembers that he had been dreaming something, but focusing on the dream, he felt it rapidly drift away.<br />
<br />
Still looking about, he eventually looked down, remembering that the previous evening he had fallen asleep in his shorts, but unable to remember as to why he had done so.<br />
<br />
Shifting, he attempted to get out of bed and instead collided with the wall his bed was pushed up against and blinking a couple of times, he rolled over to the other side and standing up, he stretched and looked toward the curtained window, which he could already see sunlight poking through the folds.<br />
<br />
Looking back down at the shirt he's wearing, Remi asked himself, &quot;Why didn't I put on my pyjamas?&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to come up with an answer, his mind drawing a blank, he yawned again and moved across his room, stepping over a couple piles of clothes, some books and a folder full of compact disks.<br />
<br />
Opening the door to his room, Remi stepped out into the semi-dark hallway and paused. Listening, he heard only the silence of the house and confused, he ducked back into his room and looking at the clock, he saw that the time read 10:13. Shrugging, figuring his parents must be already up and have already gone to work, he leaves his room and heads toward the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Inside, he undoes the zipper and button on his shorts and without giving it a second thought, he sat down on the toilet seat and started to pee.<br />
<br />
It was only after he had reached for a bit more toilet paper that Remi suddenly realised that something was amiss and without missing a beat, he started to finish wiping himself as he looked down, a look of confusion blossoming on his face as he tried to comprehend what he saw before him.<br />
<br />
Closing his eyes, he told himself, &quot;I am not seeing this,&quot; but upon opening his eyes, Remi realised that what he was seeing was in fact real.<br />
<br />
Standing slowly, he allowed his shorts to slide off and after a moment, he reached down and grasped the hem of his shirt he lifted it off. Completely nude, Remi looked down and once again told himself, &quot;I am not seeing this,&quot; as he forced his legs closed and then open when he thought it made him look even more like a girl.<br />
<br />
Turing to the mirror over the sink, he peered in and when he could not quite make out the area in front and between his legs, Remi climbed up onto the sink and turning about, he bent over, spread his legs and peered at what was clearly a young female's vulva.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
As Remi was in the bathroom, coming to terms with the fact that he had a little girl's vulva...and desperately trying to figure out how such a transformation could happen...his sister Terri, age sixteen, was waking up, much in the same fashion Remi had as she threw her comforter off of her and peered blankly around the room.<br />
<br />
After a bit, she asked herself, &quot;What had I been dreaming?&quot; as she attempted to climb out of bed, and promptly made the same mistake Remi had.<br />
<br />
Stumbling out of bed in the right direction, she stretched and the moved toward her closet. Opening the door, she stripped off her tank-top and then her boxers, dropping both into the hamper and turning, she started making her way toward her dresser.<br />
<br />
Passing the full-body mirror, Terri stopped, looked down and then dashed back. Looking into the reflective depths, taking in her nude body, she muttered, &quot;How is that possible,&quot; as she reached downward.<br />
<br />
Gently touching the penis and testicles, Terri thought back on what she had learned in health class and after a moment, she realised that her male privates where suitable only for a little boy, &quot;Someone who hasn't yet entered puberty,&quot; she thought as she turned away from the mirror, torn between wonderment and disgust that she even had such genitals.<br />
<br />
Walking to her dresser, she thought about the reflection and after a bit she came to the conclusion that nothing else about her body had changed, just her privates.<br />
<br />
Opening the top drawer, she looked in and then after a moment, shut it. Opening it again, she thought, &quot;What the hell,&quot; as she closed the drawer yet again and then started going through, first her other dresser drawers and then, after a moment, the bins she kept under the dresser.<br />
<br />
Sitting down on her bed, hating the fact that she could not close her legs and that sitting like the way she was made her look like a boy, Terri wondered how every piece of her underwear could disappear.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Back in his room, Remi was wondering the same thing as he searched his dresser and then the various pile of clothes on the floor.<br />
<br />
After several futile moments, he sat down on his bed and then after a bit, once again removed his shorts and shirt. Looking down, his legs closed tightly, not wanting to look at the area betwixt his legs, thinking that he looked rather feminine sitting like that, Remi eventually stood and thought, &quot;Rather go without,&quot; and moving over to his dresser, he started to take a fresh pair of shorts and a shirt from within.<br />
-----<br />
<br />
As Remi and Terri both adjusted to their new body parts and tried to figure out what had happened to cause such a transformation, out in the backyard, Terri and Remi's best friends slowly came around.<br />
<br />
Blinking, Anna stretched and then stood, smelling deeply the mid-morning air. Next to her Alec stirred, but did not rise.<br />
<br />
After a bit more stretching, Anna moved across the yard and without giving it a single thought, she lifter her leg, let her penis slide forth from its shaft and then a stream of urine shot forth and sprayed a nearby bush.<br />
<br />
Content, Anna sniffed around the yard, noted the bitch that had been sleeping next to her and when she came upon an amulet, she picked it up by her teeth and taking it across the yard, she proceeded to bury it in what her mind said was her favourite spot to bury stuff...including bones, plants and several toys.<br />
<br />
As Alec rose, he moved across the yard, sniffed the area where Anna had urinated and then after a moment, he squatted down and promptly followed suit.<br />
<br />
It was only afterward, as he started to move across the yard, that something in his mind snapped and suddenly Alec realised that somehow he had gone from being Remi's best friend to being a bitch. Suddenly scared, the fifteen year old boy turned dog tucked her tail between her legs and whimpered.<br />
<br />
As the other dog, a bull terrier, came across the yard, Alec whimpered out, &quot;Anna? Is that you?&quot; but only received a friendly bark from the male.<br />
<br />
Scared, wondering what had happened, sure the other dog was Anna, Alec sat down and without giving it much thought, she began to clean herself, giving much attention to the area between her legs. As she did so, truly unaware of what she was doing, Alec tried to remember if anything had taken place that could lead to such a thing.<br />
<br />
After a moment, she suddenly remembered the amulet, but was unsure of what had happened to it. Whimpering some more, she stood and began to pace back and forth, wondering how she could get out of the nightmare she had awoken to.</p>
