<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lutfiyah was making breakfast for the three of them. Laila has the next two weeks off for a vacation. Laila had said that she had a surprise for their vacation last night. She didn't even so much as hint at where they were going. But knowing her Lutfiyah knew that she would enjoy it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning my delicate flower,&quot; Laila said as she came up behind Lutfiyah and kissed her neck.<br />
<br />
Lutfiyah giggled and said, &quot;Good morning my sweet. Do you mind telling me where we're going for our vacation?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now it's a surprise,&quot; Laila said. &quot;I can promise that you'll simply love it though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With you planning it I'm sure I will,&quot; Lutfiyah said smiling coyly. &quot;Though as long as I'm with you that's all I need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just as all I need is you,&quot; Laila said. &quot;I want to ask you something before Jana wakes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Lutfiyah asked her curiosity peaked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be pregnant,&quot; Laila said. &quot;Do you think it's time for us to have another daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lutfiyah turned around and gave a passionate kiss to Laila. Breaking it she said, &quot;Oh you'll just love being pregnant. To feel a life growing inside of you is the best gift of being a woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we'll go to a clinic while we're on vacation,&quot; Laila said. &quot;I want to become pregnant as soon as possible and I'm sure my womb is ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you want to tell Jana or should I?&quot; Lutfiyah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll both tell her,&quot; Laila said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go get her up then,&quot; Lutfiyah said smiling. &quot;Breakfast is almost ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
As they were eating breakfast Lutfiyah said, &quot;Momma Laila and I have something to tell you Jana.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jana asked with the wide eyes of a child.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm going to be getting fat because I'll be with child soon,&quot; Laila said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That means you're going to have a little sister,&quot; Lutfiyah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you get fat?&quot; Jana asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's because for about nine months a new baby grows inside a special place in their mommy's tummy,&quot; Laila said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was I in there?&quot; Jana asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you were in my tummy,&quot; Lutfiyah said with a smile. &quot;And it was one of the best times of my life. One I never thought I'd have before the change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cuz you were a man before?&quot; Jana asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Luftiyah said. &quot;You see before the change men didn't have the special place in their tummy that's needed for a baby to grow in. It's really sad that all those men who lived and died before the change never had the chance to experience the joys of having a life grow inside of you.&quot; She stopped and looked sad at the thought of not being able to feel a life grow inside of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;True but many now know the joys,&quot; Laila said. &quot;And I'll soon know those joys as well. We need to finish breakfast and pack or we'll miss our flight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Flight?&quot; Lutfiyah asked. &quot;Just where are we going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a surprise,&quot; Laila said mentally kicking herself for letting that slip. Still Lutfiyah wouldn't be able to guess where they were going.<br />
<br />
Later they had arrived at their hotel and were in their room. &quot;So what are we doing here?&quot; Luftiyah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a surprise,&quot; Laila said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well as long as we can see the Ivory Palace up close I'll be happy,&quot; Luftiyah said looking out the window at the Ivory Palace in the distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we can arrange that,&quot; Laila said with a smile. She had to turn around before her smile could give anything away. She picked up the phone and made an appointment at the local clinic. They were in luck and there was an opening in a half hour where they could get in.<br />
<br />
A half hour later Luftiyah and Laila were sitting in one of the fertility rooms in hospital gowns. Since the change the hospital gowns had been given a make-over. They were now a soft feminine pink and they were either silk or satin. Two doctors came in and one said, &quot;Good afternoon. I'm Dr. Plunkett and this is Dr. Moss.&quot; Dr. Plunkett had long platinum blond hair with blue eyes while Dr. Moss had short brown hair and green eyes. &quot;Now we need to see if you have a mature egg then we can begin the process of fertilizing it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mamma Laila has eggs,&quot; Jana said with a look of confusion on her face. &quot;Like a chicken egg?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's like that but your mommy's eggs are really really small,&quot; Dr. Plunkett explained as Dr. Moss had Laila put her feet in the stir-ups and inserted a metal tube into her. &quot;They're so small that you can't see them without the aid of a special instrument called a microscope. Come here and I'll show you what Dr. Moss is doing.&quot; Jana went over with Dr. Plunkett and she continued, &quot;Your mommy's legs are up like this to make it easier for that tube to enter her body. At the end is a special tube that will open and stretch a small opening in what's called the cervix. Now you can see on the monitor that the probe is going into the womb.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's a womb?&quot; Jana asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's the special place where babies grow,&quot; Dr. Plunkett said. &quot;Now it's entering a tube that's called the fallopian tube. This tube usually brings an egg from where they're stored to the womb. And we're here at the place where the eggs are stored. It's called an ovary. Dr. Moss is looking in there to see if she can find signs of a mature egg or in other words one that's ready to leave the ovary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have one,&quot; Dr. Moss said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Jana found this fascinating and asked, &quot;How do the eggs get in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're their from birth,&quot; Dr. Plunkett said with a smile. &quot;Now we need to get another egg from your Mommy Lutfiyah. You can continue to watch Dr. Moss or you can watch me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to watch Dr. Moss,&quot; Jana said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; Dr. Plunkett said. &quot;Just don't bother her since it's a delicate procedure she's doing. If she doesn't do it right it will be another month before you mommy can try again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I'll be good,&quot; Jana said as she watched the screen Dr. Moss was looking at.<br />
<br />
As for Lutfiyah she had her legs in the stir-ups and waited with anticipation. They world may be full of lesbian women but that didn't mean that the women didn't like being filled. As a result dildos had become very much in demand practically overnight. Laila and her had a few of them themselves. As Dr. Plunkett inserted the tube Lutfiyah bucked her hips. After that she stayed still as Dr. Plunkett guided the probe to one of her ovaries. Fortunately the process of getting pregnant required only one to have a mature egg. She felt Dr. Plunkett withdraw the tube which meant that she had an egg. &quot;You can get dressed now,&quot; Dr. Plunkett said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a healthy egg here,&quot; Dr. Moss said as she took the tube out of Laila. &quot;You can go ahead and get dressed too. Would you like to see the fertilization process?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a learning experience for Jana so yes,&quot; Laila said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to save the extra genetic material?&quot; Dr. Plunkett asked labeling a small bottle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Laila already saved her's when we got pregnant with Jana and we may want more daughters so yes,&quot; Lutfiyah said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright we'll send the extra to your regular clinic then,&quot; Dr. Plunkett said. &quot;You'll have to wait a few minutes while Dr. Moss takes your eggs to the fertilization lab. Once there you'll be able to watch the process on the screen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Plunkett turned a screen on while Lutfiyah and Laila got dressed. Soon they saw Dr. Moss enter the fertilization lab. Lutfiyah was holding Jana and said, &quot;Pay attention now. This is how you were conceived.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see Dr. Moss is putting each egg into different Petri dishes,&quot; Dr. Plunkett said. &quot;Now she's putting them under the microscope and you can see the difference between the two. The mature egg is bigger than the other. The chemical she's adding to the Petri dish with the immature egg causes it to divide like any other cell. However instead of the chromosomes duplicating they just separate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's chro... chromo...&quot; Jana began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chromosomes are what contain our DNA,&quot; Dr. Plunkett said. &quot;DNA is what determines how we look and grow. Now watch.&quot; The egg divided on the screen. What looked like an egg yolk containing what looked like little worms broke and half of the worms went to one side and the other half went to the other side. Then the middle of the egg looked like it was being pinched. It was pinched in half and each half moved away from each other and the yolk reformed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Dr. Moss will take one portion of the divided egg to save,&quot; Dr. Plunkett said as a tube came into view and sucked up one half of the egg. In a few seconds another chemical was added and Dr. Plunkett explained, &quot;The chemical Dr. Moss is adding now neutralizes the first so the chromosomes from the halved immature egg can be inserted into the mature egg. And now Dr. Moss is extracting the chromosomes to insert into the mature egg.&quot; A tube penetrated the halved egg and sucked the worms out leaving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Dr. Moss will inject the chromosomes into the mature egg,&quot; Dr. Plunkett continued. &quot;This will cause half of the chromosomes in the mature egg to be expelled and the egg will start dividing and growing soon after.&quot; A tube appeared on the screen and pierced the egg. The worms that were taken out of the other one were inserted into the egg. Those worms went to pairs of worms and bumped one of the pair away. The worms that had been bumped left the egg looking lonely.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happens to those worms?&quot; Jana asked.<br />
<br />
Dr. Plunkett giggled and said, &quot;Those worms will die because their not protected by the egg.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor worms,&quot; Jana said sadly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's part of the natural cycle,&quot; Dr. Plunkett said. &quot;Now the egg will start dividing soon and in seven days we'll be able to take the resulting cells and put them in your mommy's womb. Once that's done your sister will grow inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you doctor,&quot; Laila said getting up. &quot;We'll be back in seven days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here's the time we'll be able to see you,&quot; Dr. Plunkett said handing Laila a slip of paper. &quot;Don't be late or we may not be able to get you in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll be on time,&quot; Laila said smiling. &quot;See you in a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take care,&quot; Dr. Plunkett said as they left.<br />
<br />
&quot;So where are we going now?&quot; Lutfiyah asked once they were outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see,&quot; Laila said as they got into a cab. &quot;Go to this address please and keep it quiet. It's a surprise for my wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; the woman said taking the slip of paper Laila handed her.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later they were standing outside of the Ivory Palace. &quot;Oh this is such a nice surprise,&quot; Lutfiyah said embracing Laila.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't the surprise,&quot; Laila said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn't?&quot; Lutfiyah asked confused. &quot;Then what is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see,&quot; Laila said with a mischievous smile and went to talk with a woman.<br />
<br />
Soon they were being led inside the Ivory Palace of the Goddess.</p>
