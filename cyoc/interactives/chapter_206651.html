<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">	Like the outside, the inside looked something plucked out of the old-timey movies, except this one is in color. The smell of varnish clung to every corner of the small space inside. Steve made himself comfortable in the black leathered seat. Upon sitting, he was met with an analog machine asking him for his choices. There weren&#39;t many options other than the gender, or how old he wanted to be. He chose male, of course. He liked being male. Choosing otherwise feels kind of weird for him. Although, it might present an interesting choice in the future. Going out of one&#39;s comfort zone could teach him a new experience or two. Nevertheless, he chose male and chose an age younger than he is. He&#39;s already having problems at age 30. What more if he chose someone older? <br />
<br />
	Steve finished his choices and pressed the golden button at the lower right of the machine. The whole booth whirred. The lights flashed on and off. He thought something must have gone wrong, or the machine is finally doing its final rasp of living. He opened the curtains leading outside but found that - THERE IS NO OUTSIDE. There is only the void and the winds without a source. He was about to step outside but he clung quickly to a golden railing, which he used to push himself back into the booth.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Wh- what the fuck!&quot; Steven screamed. His voice echoed everywhere.<br />
<br />
	The machine stopped its whirly gig and settled down to old vaudeville music. The lights went out and were replaced by one lone light that projected a black-and-white silent film on the screen in front of Steve. Although the medium is old, the picture it depicted looked somewhat modern. It started with a sperm - at least, that&#39;s what Steve thought it was. It&#39;s been years since he last saw high school biology, and he&#39;s glad he still remembers it. From sperm, comes fertilization. And from fertilization comes forth an organism with one X-chromosome and one Y-chromosome. He checked the other chromosomes in the karyotype and found them in the right number of 23 pairs. The cells divided and divided, but the video flashed immediately a few years later.<br />
<br />
	A boy with brown hair stands in the middle of his birthday party. Everyone is greeting him with a happy birthday, but the people around him had their eyes fixated on him. He&#39;s a handsome boy, Steve remarked. He has perfect skin, with smooth combed hair. He&#39;d be a lady-killer once he took on a decade with a topping of a few more years.<br />
<br />
	The video fast-forwarded once more. The subject from before is now in high school, and by the looks of it, in the latter parts of it. It&#39;s not a school Steve recognized, but the place is huge. It&#39;s also probably not somewhere in the USA because the students are wearing uniforms instead of the usual casual attire. The boy from before has grown into a dashing young man with a crowd following on his way towards the campus. Steve would like to see where this story leads, but the movie descended to a black-noir screen with jittering words that say, &quot;Nu-life. The choice is yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
	A mysterious force dragged Steve out of the booth and into the void beyond. He screamed at the top of his lungs as fell into uncertain doom. The wind lashed at his face, and on his clothes that disassembled into fabrics and strings. All that was left was his sorry state of a naked body, screaming as a strange light covered everything and everyone in the world around him.<br />
<br />
	Steve gasped for breath as he opened his eyes. There was a sense of confusion and this throbbing pain in his temples. While disoriented, he has some semblance of grounded thought forming in his mind. He&#39;s in a bathroom, a prestigious one at that. It doesn&#39;t smell like piss and shit like the one he remembered from his high school. This one has carpeted floors and the smell of lavender hanging in the air. He&#39;s in a wall-mounted toilet, and on his hand is one of the smoothest dick his eyes had ever laid on. It&#39;s way beyond average and the tip remains uncircumcised. It&#39;s cute, in a way, if you discount the sheer girth of it. Steve flicked the dick away and was about to apologize to its owner, when he realized, the base was coming from him. This dick was his. Sensing something wrong, he immediately ran for his reflection.<br />
<br />
	It was the boy he realized earlier. Steven Flanders. Steven doesn&#39;t know why he has the same name as the guy, nor how the hell he knows his surname, but he just did. His name is Steven Flanders. An achieving 17-year-old teenager studying in the most prestigious university in the country. He touched his face, and so did the reflection. He felt his smooth fingers grazing against his equally smooth face. Everything else on his face is nothing but perfection, one could only meet in a television show or an anime. No guy can be this handsome, can they? And yet, here it is. The most handsome guy he&#39;s ever seen. And it&#39;s him!<br />
<br />
	The door to the bathroom opened. A man twice as tall, and several-fold bulkier went inside. He stopped in his tracks and looked at Steven. His eyes strayed from Steven&#39;s face, then down to the dick still dangling and forgotten between Steven&#39;s legs. Steven was in a rush that he forgot to tuck it inside.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Pr- president, your dick,&quot; The grunt pointed. Steven blushed and immediately tucked it inside. The grunt did so as well. Steven couldn&#39;t have expected to see such a large man look so embarrassed and vulnerable. The grunt excused himself and took a piss at the farthest stall of the bathroom. <br />
<br />
	&#120331;&#120362;&#120357; &#120373;&#120361;&#120354;&#120373; &#120360;&#120374;&#120378; &#120363;&#120374;&#120372;&#120373; &#120356;&#120354;&#120365;&#120365; &#120361;&#120362;&#120366; &#120369;&#120371;&#120358;&#120372;&#120362;&#120357;&#120358;&#120367;&#120373;? Memories of concern flooded his mind. That&#39;s right. This is his third year as the student-body president of this prestigious university. At least for the high school branch. People look up to him, not only for his unnaturally perfect looks but also for the prestige of his position. He has the looks and the power. But for the wealth, however, that&#39;s where he&#39;s lacking. &#120347;&#120361;&#120362;&#120372; &#120366;&#120362;&#120360;&#120361;&#120373; &#120355;&#120358; &#120373;&#120361;&#120358; &#120373;&#120376;&#120362;&#120372;&#120373; &#120341;&#120374;-&#120365;&#120362;&#120359;&#120358; &#120376;&#120362;&#120365;&#120365; &#120360;&#120362;&#120375;&#120358; &#120361;&#120362;&#120366;, Steven thought. <br />
<br />
	Steven left for the bathroom, and into the hallway where several students tried to steal a glance at him. Some girls blushed, and most whispered amongst themselves with Steven hearing his name in between words. Where did Steven go now?</p>
