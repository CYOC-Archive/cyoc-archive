<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, back in Claire&#39;s hometown, Jesse was enduring a typical day at high school. On a warm mid-September morning, he sported a football t-shirt, khaki shorts, and Nike sneakers similar to many other guys. He was dozing off in his pre-calculus class, struggling to stay awake when Claire altered reality. Little did he know, his mischievous cousin decided to alter the rulebook further, ensuring his memories of his previous life would remain intact unlike everyone else. She could only imagine the panic Jesse would feel once he realized how drastically everything had changed. It was a shame she wouldn&#39;t be around to witness it firsthand.<br />
<br />
Jesse&#39;s head bobbed up and down, his eyes half-shut as he struggled to stay awake during the dull lecture. Amid blinks, his hair started falling in front of his face. As he brushed back the long, blonde strands, he jolted awake, realizing he didn&#39;t have long hair. A chill ran through him as he noticed his entire outfit had changed. Instead of his usual baggy khaki shorts that reached his knees, he now wore tight jean shorts that barely extended halfway down his thighs. His black football t-shirt was replaced by a light pink, form-fitting one. Even his blue Nike sneakers had been swapped for white Birkenstocks.<br />
<br />
As he shook in confusion, he examined his fingertips, noticing the bright pink nail polish. He ran his hands over his smooth, hairless arms, puzzled about where his hair had disappeared to, and did the same to his legs. He noticed two breasts on his chest, and before doing anything else, he glanced around the room to see how everyone else was reacting.<br />
<br />
He was even more shocked when he realized that everyone around him had changed. The boy sitting next to him, who had been a nerdy dork Jesse never spoke to, now had long hair and was dressed in jean shorts, a striped t-shirt, and blue flip-flops. Around the room, it seemed like everyone had swapped appearances. Girls now had short hair and wore baggy clothes, while boys sported longer hair and more revealing outfits. As he scanned the room, trying to make sense of it all, a voice called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Faber. Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse turned to the front of the room, where his teacher was staring at him. However, this wasn&#39;t the teacher he remembered. It was an unfamiliar man, at least he thought it was a man based on their slacks and dress shirt, but Jesse wasn&#39;t sure anymore. They were looking straight at him, making it clear they were speaking to him. Yet, Jesse was puzzled by the way they addressed him as Miss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
By now, everyone in the class was staring at him. Yet, no one appeared as confused or puzzled as he was. Everyone acted completely normal as if nothing unusual was happening. Feeling a panic attack coming on from all the attention, he muttered to be excused, &quot;Um, can I use the restroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse&#39;s eyes widened as he realized his voice was now a much higher pitch. The teacher sighed but reluctantly agreed. &quot;Fine, but make it quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jesse rose from his desk and left the classroom. He hurried anxiously down the hallway towards the bathroom, struggling to balance with his new breasts. He felt relieved upon reaching the restroom without encountering anyone else. As he entered, he froze, confused by the absence of urinals, and wondered if he had entered the wrong room. He stepped back into the hallway to confirm which restroom he was in. To his surprise, it was indeed the right one. The sign read &quot;Men,&quot; but the silhouette above the word depicted a person wearing a dress, similar to the triangular silhouette often used for women. Curious, he walked over to the other side and noticed the silhouette above &quot;Women&quot; depicted an ordinary person without a dress.<br />
<br />
Jesse stepped into the men&#39;s restroom and was stunned by his reflection in the mirror. He looked like a girl: slim, with a frail body, long blonde hair, large round breasts, and a pretty, made-up face. He tugged at his hair, convinced it was a wig or extensions, but the more he pulled, the more it hurt. He then grabbed his breasts, doubting their authenticity. As he lifted his shirt and peeked beneath the bra, he realized the breasts were firmly attached to his body.<br />
<br />
Though he felt he still had his male anatomy, he wanted to double-check since everything in the last five minutes had been bizarre. He stretched out his shorts and underwear, and while he was relieved to see he still had his manhood, he was shocked to find he was wearing a thong. His balls and shaft were housed within the pouch of the g-string, and the thin elastic band stretched around his waist, with another slender band stretching downward, wedged between his butt, connecting to the pouch in front.<br />
<br />
Jesse was bewildered and desperately wanted to understand what was happening. Unfortunately, he had left his phone in class, so he couldn&#39;t call his parents or anyone else for help. He turned on the sink and splashed water on his face, hoping to snap out of this strange dream. Instead, it only made him more awake, deepening his confusion about what was real. Resigning himself to the lack of answers, he decided to go back to class.<br />
<br />
He slipped back into the classroom and quietly took his seat, unnoticed by his classmates who were absorbed in the ongoing lecture. The teacher&#39;s voice droned on about math, but Jesse&#39;s mind was elsewhere, tangled in thoughts about his predicament and searching for a way out. Feeling uncomfortable, he instinctively crossed one knee over the other, unconsciously adopting a posture often associated with girls. Lost in his musings and unable to find any answers, the sudden sound of the bell finally jolted him back to reality.</p>
