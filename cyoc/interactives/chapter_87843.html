<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That thought gave Casper an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Ashley?&quot; he asked, &quot;want to go test out the abilities of the ring some more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; she replied, &quot;What did you have in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Mr. and Mrs. Blonski are this old couple who live on my street.  They were always kind to me, and I thought I might be able to return the favor with this ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, sounds good!&quot; came her response.<br />
<br />
Casper and Ashley got up from the bleachers, leaving the rubber bulls and foxes to their practice, the latex bear coach calling drills and his shiny bear cub son shouting encouragement.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way, Ashley, are you hungry at all?  I mean, we went out to dinner, but you didn&#39;t eat anything, but I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve eaten anything this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned to him, &quot;Oh, no, I haven&#39;t.  I haven&#39;t really been hungry at all since yesterday...maybe we Synthetics don&#39;t need to eat all that much, or maybe only in certain cases.  I&#39;ll let you know if I start getting peckish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; he said as they continued on their way.<br />
<br />
They made their way over to Casper&#39;s street, and they saw an older couple leaving their house for a walk around the block.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s them,&quot; Casper pointed them out to Ashley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, so what are you going to make them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not entirely certain,&quot; he replied, &quot;I really wonder what the limits of the ring are.  Let&#39;s see...&quot; he said, raising his hand bearing the ring towards the older couple.<br />
<br />
They moved gingerly, as older people often do, and Casper remembered hearing Mr. Blonski grumbling about his arthritis in the past.  Casper&#39;s face took on a look of concentration, as he was about to attempt something that he had never done before with the ring, and he wanted to see just how fine his control of the magical artifact was.<br />
He focused on Mr. Blonski first, and as he did, his posture began to change.  As he shuffled along with his wife of many years, he began to straighten, no longer crouching as his skeleton began to fail him, but starting to walk upright, proud and tall.  His orthotic shoes and socks vanished, replaced by naked feet that quickly began to change shape, merging and molding into a pair of hooves.  Casper already knew that he could do metallic colors, so he made Mr. Blonski&#39;s hooves chrome.  The changes progressed upwards, his feet and legs gaining black stripes, and Ashley commented, &quot;Ohh, a zebra!&quot; Casper continued to concentrate, but managed to reply &quot;Not just any Zebra, watch.&quot;  As the pair of elderly pair continued their walk, oblivious to the changes to Mr. Blonski, his feet and legs continued to change, pants replaced by shiny rubber, black stripes creeping their way up his legs, interspersed with bright red.  His pants disappeared as his manhood was swallowed up not by a bulge, but by smooth rubber, his rear sealing up as well, the tell-tale barcode appearing multicolored on his butt, and a tail sprouted from just above the cleft.  His hips widened, the lines of his body softening from masculine to more feminine.  The latex rose higher, still wrapping him in black stripes, but the negative spaces shifted from red, to orange, to yellow as it climbed up his frame.  He began to shrink in size a bit, more closely matching his wife&#39;s stature, the lines of age and wear disappearing from his body.  His chest changed, being surrounded by the shiny material, ballooning out into two breasts, though devoid of nipples, as his, now more accurately her shoulders softened and narrowed.  Her colors shifted further, now fading to green and blue, as the change neared her head, pushing out into a violet equine muzzle, pointed ears moving to the top of her head, and a stiff mane sprouted from her shiny head, matching the black and graduated colors of her body.  Arms became slimmer, matching the color shifts of the rest of her body, ending in four-fingered hands, the fingers a bit thicker than a normal humans.  With a pop, the nozzle appeared in her navel, and mold lines formed around her body, as she let out a soft whinny marking the transformation complete.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Blonski changed along with her former husband, similarly straightening in posture, though where her husband had hooves, her feet changed to resemble paws of a feline, themselves changing to a deep purple color.  Her clothing vanished similarly, but a bulge formed at her crotch, signaling that she was technically no longer a she, but a he.  Metallic gold spots began to appear along her legs, and along her newly formed tail that stretched out behind her, lazily drifting back and forth.  Her breasts lost their nipples as well, as well as receding into her chest, shoulders widening as they too were wrapped in shiny, stretchy latex.  She, now a he, began to increase in size, approaching the height of someone fitting his new sex.  His face stretched out into a feline muzzle, ears changing shape and moving to the top of his head, metallic gold tear-lines appearing on his muzzle, complementing the spots of the newly formed cheetah.  Another pop, and navel-nozzle, metallic gold bar-code, and molding lines appeared on him as well.<br />
<br />
The two newly made rubber creatures stopped in their tracks, turning to each other as new memories flooded their changed minds.  They hugged, the purple and gold cheetah bending his head to lovingly kiss the muzzle of his rainbow colored zebra wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, wow!&quot; gasped Ashley, rapt as she watched the transformation of the elderly couple into young, inflated anthro animals.  &quot;I remember going to classes with Mr. Blonski now...I mean, Mrs. Blonski, the cheetah.  The two of them met during a drama club rehearsal.  Mrs. Blonksi, I mean Mr, the zebra, was always a free spirit, and loved the theatre.  Man, I&#39;m going to have to get used to this, memories changing but being aware of the change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Casper let out his breath, which he did not realize he was holding, and wiped at his forehead, a slight sheen of sweat having formed there from his intense concentration.  The ring had grown warm again on his finger, probably due to the complexity of what he just did with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what next?&quot; he asked.</p>
