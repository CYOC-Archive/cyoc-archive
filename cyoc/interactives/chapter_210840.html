<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I know this isn&#39;t a particularly fun chapter, but I felt like taking a moment to explore a few ideas, and maybe set up an endgame for this pretty doomed timeline.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe write up a happy little love story for Arion and Jay that takes place far away from any of this misery. Who knows! I&#39;m honestly amazed that I even wrote this much, or at all. Thanks rawr for continuing the last chapter!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pa happily counted the stacks of cash that had been haphazardly thrown at him by what had clearly been a satisfied customer. He looked around this shithole of a house, beer cans littered around the place and cum stains just about everywhere. God what a dump, he thought. Once he got rid of everybody, he’d be able to sell this place and do whatever the fuck he wanted. But for now he had another buyer on the way, and merchandise to prepare.<br />
<br />
He looked over to Finn and Daddy, having one final fuck session before the little lamb boi was sold off to his own prince charming. At this point, the lamb was up off the obese ram’s cock and straddling Daddy’s muzzle. Athletic legs wrapped around the ram’s head as the lamb grabbed hold of the real man’s horns in order to maintain his balance. The big ram Daddy apparently decided to give his boi one last blowjob while the lamb still had much of a cock to speak of, though at this point it was clear he was suckling on what was little more than a nub. Still, the big guy gave a little more than his usual effort, pacing himself while giving his boi a good time, and Finn was bleating happily all the while. The little lamb’s ass was now a head-engulfing pair of bouncy orbs, covered in pristine soft white wool. There was somehow not even a speck of dust to dirty the hide of the twink, and not a speck of a mind in his head either. The little lamb was a dumb little trophy, perfect to please both his new daddy and his current Daddy. Pa looked at them with a smile, as a *PING* was heard from upstairs...<br />
<br />
And thought about how much he fucking hated them. God, why didn’t he take the offer from that freak who wanted to turn the fucking brat into lamb chops? He would have gotten so much more for the little shit. Hell, he could’ve killed two goats with one bullet and probably could’ve thrown in his fat fuck daddy in for a bigger payday. Maybe it’s not too late, he could probably call the sick fuck and get him to rush over before that pansy-ass puma gets here and-<br />
<br />
“FUCK!” Pa slapped himself in the face. The Chronivac was messing with him again. Or, more accurately, “Todd” was. He ignored the concerned look on the faces of his husband and son and rushed upstairs. Not enough of him changed yet, and if he moved fast he could still undo it. Some of it, anyway. <br />
<br />
With every step Pa was cursing himself for thinking like that, even if he knew it wasn’t really him. Pa loved his husband, truly. No matter what he... knew had happened, he still loved Daddy Dave. Hell, even knowing what he did to him, Pa still loved Finn too. The kiddo was his son, in one way or another “real” or not, and he’d loved him like that for over twenty-one years. Pa just wanted the best life for him, he justified to himself. But “Todd” hated everyone, and demanded revenge. And maybe something worse than that. The panda rounded the corner to Jeff’s room, thankful that he still had enough athleticism to not be gassed from the exertion, and sat his oversized ass in the chair, seeing another progress bar nearing completion.<br />
<br />
“Shit shit shit,” Pa fumbled with the keyboard and mouse a bit, having lost a good deal of his technical savvy a while ago. He still knew how to work this damn contraption, it just a took a while longer. When he managed to cancel the current change at 98%, he let out a breath of relief before noticing the sounds in the room. Buck and Chuck were having their morning makeout session, the twin mutts loudly slobbering all over each other. Laid out on the mattress flat on the floor, they had eyes only for each other right now, hands caressing ears and chins. One put his hand gently on the other’s belly as he was pulled in. The other continued to control the kiss, hand sliding down to his brother’s ass, squeezing the tight posterior. Their dicks already poking each other and drooling precum, it seemed like those dogs could start fucking at any moment.<br />
<br />
Pa looked at them with disgust, before shaking his head. That was “Todd” again, and he needed to calm down. He also needed those two to leave him alone so he could get to work.<br />
<br />
“BOYS,” Pa called out, knowing if he didn’t give a forceful enough command that those two wouldn’t hear him. One of the two pitbulls’ ears perked up in alert, before turning to him.<br />
<br />
“Hey Papa Panda, did our princess get his happily ever after?” One of them asked, a lazy grin on his face.<br />
<br />
“The hell if I know,” Pa snorted back, “But I got paid for the sissy kitty if that’s what you’re asking. Now get the fuck outta here, I’ve gotta work.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm,” The other pitbull stired from his lust-filled stupor. “It sounds like it’s time for you to pay us for a job well done then.”<br />
<br />
These fucking shits, Pa thought to himself. Sure, in the reality that was created, these two had been working for months to prime and train Finn and Jeff into being perfect submissive sissies for their new sugar daddies. But they hadn’t really done any work, that was all done by the Chronivac. And now that these two fuckheads thought they were owed any of his money made Pa’s blood boil.<br />
<br />
“Get the fuck out! You fucking shitheads’ll get paid when I tell ya, now FUCK OFF!” Pa bellowed, practically shaking the whole house. One good thing about being a bear is that when you yell, everyone in the building gets the message.<br />
<br />
The two of them grumbled as they collected themselves. “We don’t have to take this shit from that fat fuck, y’know?” Pa heard one of the twins say. The quiet staredown that Pa and one of them had from the doorway made it clear that the mutt intended for him to hear it. The panda was far from intimidated by some puffed up mutts, especially since he had the Chronivac to take care of them if he wanted. He knew damn well to make almost everyone in the house too dumb to use it for a reason. The only reason Pops could still use it is because his profile was constantly updating when he was working on things last night.<br />
<br />
“Get,” Pa commanded, clearly a final command before the twins slogged off. Pa thought he might have to get rid of them sooner than later, those two were more trouble than they were worth. Jeff really was a fucking moron to drag those two into this little pleasuredome from hell. He could turn the twins into something inanimate to get rid of them quickly. Maybe merge them into a double-sided dildo if they wanted to fuck everything up so badly. It’s not like anything of value would be lost, and they’d be stuck together like they always wanted. The panda made sure to wait for the two of them to go down every last step before turning back to the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
“Shit!” He blurted out, as another progress bar was going, this one already at 94%. Normally he wouldn’t care, but with his current headspace any additional change might push him over the edge. He worked as fast as his fat clumsy paws could go, managing to stop that one at 99%. “Alright asshole, we’re rolling some of this shit back,” he said to no one in particular. He brought up his profile to confirm what he already knew, noting the corrupted text that covered large swathes of it. He looked over the recent change log, highlighted a portion of them, careful not to mess up any of the changes to &quot;Jay&quot;, and hit undo. Pa watched the progress bar fill up, and once it completed, he instantly felt a wave of relief. That lingering sense of anger and hatred had dissipated, for the moment. A few miscellaneous other changes were undone as well to cover a sizable portion of the changes to Pa. Downstairs, Daddy was probably being surprised by his little lamb regrowing a few inches of cock in his throat, but Pa doubted that he’d mind much. So he relaxed, feeling like he was almost back to being the jolly old bear that had helped make this house a home, once upon a time.<br />
<br />
The big panda contemplated things for a moment. No, that wasn’t true either. He wasn’t anything like this as of a few days ago, let alone decades. He knew better, but those memories still felt real in a part of his brain. The part that was far from the demon that haunted him now, screaming in rage at having been robbed of its identity, its body, its humanity. Pa looked over his profile again, and saw it was now mostly intact, aside from a few sparse fragments of corruption remaining. Seeing that reminded him of “Todd,” and out of morbid curiosity he opened the “Previous versions” log, bringing up the original Todd profile, or what was left of it.<br />
<br />
Unlike everything else in the chronivac, all the text was red, as if to say immediately that something was wrong. Very little of it left was readable. Todd. Human. 18 years old. Everything else had largely been obfuscated by artifacting as most of the other words and information became illegible. A corruption in the code, rendering Todd a ghost, a fragment of a person stuck in a machine of unrivaled power, living lifetimes of a tortured existence in minutes. Pa thought that if Todd was still in there, in him, that he must be a being a pure hatred and anger by now, feverishly fighting to damn anyone who had the audacity to still be breathing and living. Which is why Pa couldn’t give Todd what he wanted anymore.<br />
<br />
When he first learned what Jeff had done, what Finn had done, to him and everyone, Pa was angry. He could feel that rage of Todd’s deep inside, but he’d been trying to temper it, to placate it. Offering vengeance as the compromise between justice and murder. Changing Finn’s and Jeff’s profiles, preparing to sell them off as dumb and fun fuck-hungry twinks. He wanted to get payback, but not to be cruel, so he found some buyers of what could be considered passable moral quality, in an attempt to strike a balance between punishing the bastards who twisted everyone in their sphere into perverted playthings and supporting the sons he had many wonderful memories raising and enjoying the company of. <br />
<br />
But it was clear things were getting worse, that Todd was demanding blood, not just Jeff’s and Finn’s, but everyone’s blood. Images of cracking skulls with a hammer and slitting throats were peppering his mundane thoughts, driving him towards madness. And in its current bugged state the Chronivac seemed to mindlessly help Todd toward that goal, as it randomly was updating Pa’s profile using the corrupted “Todd” profile as a baseline to model off of. So every time the more of “Todd” got into Pa, the angrier he got, the more callous and hateful of Jeff and Finn, of this house, of the world. He was getting worse, and he couldn’t keep fixing himself forever. So everyone had to go, to get as far away from him as they could before he was turned into a total psychopathic bastard.<br />
<br />
Finn was about ready to be shipped off, that was pretty much a done deal. The twins would be easy enough to just tell to fuck off, he had no real connection to them as far as he could tell from the logs he could read. He could maybe get Pops to just abandon everyone and live with Chris, it probably wouldn’t take much. Maybe Pa could make it so Pops could get pregnant, so he could have as many litters as the hog could ever want. It’d be a stretch for reality, but at this point we weren&#39;t playing with fire so much as playing with the ashes of a burned down house. After all that, he could sit down with Dave, tell him a comfortable story, and hope he had enough time to say goodbye before things got too bad.<br />
<br />
Pa nodded to himself at the computer, and went to work looking over everyone’s profiles. Immediately, there was a problem with the twins. Chuck’s profile was fine, but Buck seemed to have a bit of that corruption. To confirm his fears, Pa checked Buck’s “Previous Versions” log, and sure enough found another red file as an original version. Thinking on it, that probably was Buck giving him lip earlier. Cursing his luck initially, he realized quickly that Chuck and Buck had what was supposed identical profiles. So he’d be able to recreate Buck’s profile by simply copying and pasting Chuck’s over onto it. That would have to do; It was going to be bad eventually, but that should buy Pa’s plan enough time to reach its conclusion. After checking Mike’s, or Pops’s profile, Pa went to finish up by looking over Chris’s. And his heart sank.<br />
<br />
The corruption on Chris’s profile made it unsalvageable. Nothing was legible, readable, usable. It was a mess of random letters, numbers, and symbols that to even the most insane interpretation could not be recognized as a person. Whatever Chris was at this point, it was terrifying. Pa could try to rebuild the profile, but he didn’t even really know Chris that well. He had no idea where to begin. All he could think of was the fear that if Chris was anything like how he was feeling, there was a full on monster roaming around now. If he let Pops go back to Chris, he might as well be signing his death certificate. But he couldn’t let Pops come home either, not after everything. Not with what was to come.<br />
<br />
Paralyzed by fear, Pa sunk his face into his hands, and sobbed.</p>
