<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Gray wolf transformation, 1-year duration. Minimum mind alteration, living in the wild, capable of breeding. Are those your transformation details?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
The scientist smiled. &quot;Great. Did you know that this species were really common just a few years ago?&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Steven in suprise. He knew that gray wolves weren&#39;t that endangered, but... wow.<br />
&quot;Yeah, a real shocker. A severe disease hit and killed most of their species, all around the world.&quot;<br />
The scientist shaked his head. &quot;But we are not here to talk about the past! We are here to celebrate the future! Come on, follow me to the lab, and we shall begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Five minutes later, Steven was standing in the lab. The scientinst returned with a syrange, and Steven looked at it in amazment. This is it? That&#39;s the amount they need to completely change him for a whole year?<br />
&quot;I can see that you&#39;re not very impressed of our syrange. it&#39;s Fine, most people react just like you. Please, get yourself in the cage&quot;-the scientist pointed on a metal-barred area of the room-&quot;And we&#39;ll start. Oh, I forgot to mention, how rude! I&#39;m Dan, and I&#39;ll guide you during the transformation and for a week long period of training for living in the wild after that.&quot;<br />
Steven shaked his hand, and entered the cage. Dan closed it behind him. &quot;Sorry for the inconvinience, but we can never know how you would react for the first few minutes after you&#39;re done changing. Some patients went kinda wild, so here we are,&quot; he sighed. &quot;Now, just remove your clothing, and we&#39;ll be good to go.&quot;<br />
Steven did as he was told, blushing as Dan looked at him naked. The scientist said in a calming voice, &quot;Steven, you have nothing to be ashamed of. I am a proffesional, and I really don&#39;t care how you look naked. I&#39;ve done this lots of times with many pattients, and please, don&#39;t act shy and try to hide anything, all it would do is make it harder for me to monitor your changes.&quot;<br />
Steven&#39;s face went completely red as he removed his hands, revealing his privates. Dan didn&#39;t react at all, just picked up the syrange and held it above Steven&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Are you sure about this?&quot; he asked, looking in his eyes. &quot;From the moment I&#39;ll inject you, there is no coming back for a whole year.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; responded Steven. Dan smiled. &quot;Great.&quot;<br />
Steven shivered a bit as the serum was injected into him. Dan sat down near the cage, holding a notebook. &quot;Your transformation will start in about two minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan went to the back of the room, and carried a full-body mirror, placing it in front of the cage. &quot;Now you&#39;ll be able to see your transformation.&quot;<br />
Exactly two minutes later, Steven felt a tingling sesation just above his anus. Dan noticed his discomfort. &quot;Seems like the changes are starting. As you may guess, the first change is one of the most extreme ones, but I think you&#39;re gonna like it. Yes, I&#39;m talking about your new limb. The growth your see just above your anus? This is the start of a tail.&quot;<br />
Steven watched in amazment as the growth lenghened and sprouted grey and brown fur. Suddenly, he felt a wave of sensetion swirling in his mind, and he realised he could feel his new tail. He focused, and managed to move it from side to side. &quot;Wow! This is sick!&quot; he shouted, swishing his tail. <br />
&quot;I had hoped that you&#39;d react like that.&quot; said Dan. The tail finished forming, and black fur grew at its edge.<br />
&quot;Now, for the second part of your transformation-those will be your other limbs. The legs should change first.&quot;<br />
Steven looked down, and saw his thumbs shrinking, disappearing into his feet. His nails grew bigger and darked, turning into claws. Gray and white fur started growing, and the rest of his fingers swelled, changing his feet into wolf&#39;s paws.<br />
&quot;And now, your hands.&quot; said Dan. Steven watched as his hands went through the same changes, turning into paws. <br />
&quot;As you know, wolves don&#39;t have hands-they on;y have legs. Your new paws should be identical to the ones on your legs, and, as you&#39;ll see in a moment...&quot; he said, and threw a pen at Steven. He tried to catch, but it slipped through his changed hands. &quot;...you won&#39;t be able to do stuuf as catching, climbing, or anything similar with your paws.&quot;<br />
Steven raised his paws up and slashed the air. &quot;Well, at least I can do some damage with those things!&quot;<br />
Dan chuckeled. &quot;Well, you sure can. I must say, you&#39;re probably the most accepting and eager patient I&#39;ve ever had around here. It&#39;s a pleasure to work with you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks, Dan,&quot; said Steven. He looked back at his hands, and saw them sprouting fur and thinning. He flinched in suprise as his elbows snapped and twisted, changing their position. He tried to move his hands, but it seemed way harded. He looked at Dan in question. <br />
&quot;Well, as I said earlier, wolves don&#39;t use their hands for the same purpuses we use them, so your elbows adjusted to that-now your hands are no longer hands, but front legs.&quot;<br />
The same changes happend to his legs. They thinned and sprouted fur, and his knees changed, making him unsteady. &quot;Whoa, I&#39;m losing my balance here!&quot; he said in panic. <br />
&quot;Don&#39;t panic! Think about it. Wolves walk on all fours-it&#39;s obvious that you&#39;ll feel unbalanced on two.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I forgot that,&quot; mumbleled Steven. <br />
&quot;Now to the most &#39;serious&#39; change. Your hips and shoulders should start changing, and you should change your posture into a canine one-from walking on two, to being qadropod-that means walking on all fours,&quot; explained Dan.<br />
Steven&#39;s hips did changed, and he fell down with a suprised &quot;Yelp!&quot; He managed to stop his fall with his hands, but as he tried to get up, he figured he just can&#39;t. His new posture felt weird and alien, but after half a minute he felt much better. &quot;Actually, I feel much more balanced like that... even more than walking on two,&quot; he admitted. Dan nodded, and Steven realised how tall he looked now.<br />
&quot;Now, back and belly.&quot;<br />
His back cracked and shifted, finally entering canine posture. His back and belly sprouted fur, and Steven stroked his belly with his rear legs, feeling the lush fur with his paws. He looked down behind him, and saw two rows of little nipples forming on his body, and white fur covering them almost completely.<br />
&quot;Umm, why-&quot; he started asking, but then he felt a wave of hit crossing his privates. He looked down, and to his terror, he saw his penis shrinking, and his balls getting soaked into his belly. &quot;Wha-what&#39;s going on?&quot; he asked Dan in fear. <br />
Dan looked at him in confusion. &quot;Your privates are changing, if you haven&#39;t noticed.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I know, but... why is my dick shrinking?&quot; he asked, blushing hard.<br />
&quot;Well, you haven&#39;t specified your desired sex, so we&#39;ve decided to make you female-we are in a shortage of females here.&quot; Explained Dan. Steven looked at him in shock. &quot;I thought it means that I&#39;ll keep my current gender!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh. Well, I&#39;m sorry for that, I really am, but there is nothing I can do to change this now. Who knows? Maybe you&#39;d like being a female wolf even more than being a human male.&quot;<br />
Steven sighed, but what could he do? He sighed again, embracing the changes. He penis and balls were completely gone, and he could feel his new sex beginning to form. In a short time, the heat wave has passed, and his new vulva has finished changing.<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t so bad, was it?&quot; asked Dan, trying to calm Steven down. Steven only snorted in response.<br />
&quot;I get it, really. I&#39;m sorry... but we&#39;ve got to continue. Your head should start changing now.&quot;<br />
He could feel the tingling crossing his ears, and when he looked at the mirror, he saw two wolf ears perking above his head. &quot;Your sense of hearing should be much better now,&quot; said Dan in a way louder voice. &#39;No, not he doesn&#39;t speak louder-I just hear better!&#39; thought Steven, his tail wagging in excitment. &quot;Ittt&#39;s so cccool.&quot; he said, forming words becoming harder. He could feel his teeth sharpening and growing, and he looked at the mirror and opened his mouth, showing his new teeth.<br />
&quot;Myyy theef arf soo grrr arrgh arf!&quot; said Steven, his words turning into canine barks as his tongue and throat changed. His mouth and nose pushed forward, forming a snout, and his eyes changed, completeing his transformation.<br />
He could feel a wave of heat crossing his head. &quot;Those are the instincts,&quot; said Dan. &quot;And now, your transformation is complete. I hope you&#39;re still in there... Steven, can you still understand me?&quot;<br />
Steven tried to respond, but only a howl escaped his mouth. &quot;Steven, if you can understand me, raise your right front leg up!&quot;<br />
Steven raised his hand-umm, leg, and Dan sighed in relief. &quot;Great. I&#39;m going to open the cage now. Don&#39;t try to run away.&quot;<br />
&#39;Who you think I am?&#39; thought Steven, offended, but again, ony a whine came from his mouth.<br />
Dan opened the cage, and told Steven to follow him. He tried to walk. It felt really strange, walking on all fours, but his new instincts quickly kicked in, and his walking became steady and much easier. &quot;I see that your instincts finally kickied in. That&#39;s great. Now, here&#39;s the plan: In the following week I&#39;m going to train you to leaving in the wild. This include hunting, meeting other wolves, and everything else.&quot;<br />
Steven barked in agreement. Dan smiled. &quot;Also, &#39;Steven&#39; really isn&#39;t a proper name for a female wolf. You&#39;ll be called Rieka, &#39;the wolves&#39; queen&#39;. How&#39;d you like it?&quot;<br />
Rieka barked happily. It was a good name, that fit her new role well. <br />
&quot;Alright! let&#39;s head to your enclosure, and start your training.&quot;</p>
