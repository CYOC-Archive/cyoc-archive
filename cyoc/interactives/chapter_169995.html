<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr Jenkins continued to run as the serum instantly got to work. <br />
<br />
The doctor felt off-balance as his body seemed to be losing its bulk and shape. An unusual tingling feeling settled over him as thousands of tiny pin-sized growths started pushing out of his skin. Moreover, running was quickly becoming difficult as his arms and legs began to diminish in size.<br />
<br />
Dr Jenkins ignored the guests that stared at him as he made his way deeper into the forest surrounding the Aviary. He looked back to see that there were now several security guards and bird keepers hot on his tail.<br />
<br />
Jenkins tore at his shirt as he started to panic, hoping that the changes would accelerate if his body was unencumbered by his restrictive clothes.<br />
<br />
This tactic seemed to work, although it quickly made running even more awkward.<br />
<br />
The doctor had shrunk to about three-quarters of his original height, while his chest and appendages had become increasingly avian. In addition, a layer of short spine-like feathers had grown out to cover most of his body. The feathers on his underside were mostly white, while the rest of his body adopted a jet black colouration. However, these feathers didn’t feel soft and light like he had expected them to, rather they formed a warm, smooth blanket that smothered his warped body.<br />
<br />
Jenkins was then forced to stop as an intense pain shot into his lower back. He then began to feel queasy as a lump of flesh started to push out behind him. The new growth bulged larger, forcing him to spread his legs awkwardly as the fleshy mass adopted a triangular shape. This then became covered with the same spiny feathers that covered the rest of his body, leaving him with a fully-formed tail.<br />
<br />
As the pain in his tail dissipated, Jenkins looked down at his changed body and quickly worked out that something was very wrong.<br />
<br />
His legs had dwindled to almost nothing, essentially leaving him with two dark scaly feet that poked out under him. His arms too had also changed shape so that they were now short and streamlined as they hung uselessly at his sides. Added to this, the doctor’s body was now a compact streamlined shape, although it looked different to that of most birds he knew. In fact he knew only one type of bird that looked like he did; and that revelation terrified him.<br />
<br />
However, Dr Jenkins wasn’t able to reflect on this for more than a few seconds before he felt another jolt of pain just above his tail. He gazed down to see a small dart sticking out of him. He then looked behind him to see a zookeeper aiming a gun at him. <br />
<br />
Jenkins started to feel woozy as the woman and several others ran over to him. His vision then started to turn dark as he passed out…<br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
The doctor woke up groggily a few hours later as the tranquilliser finally wore off. He slowly opened his eyes to see that he was looking up at a clear blue sky. His body felt tired and numb, while his mind was slow to start working. He shut his eyes again and tried to remember what had happened. He vaguely recalled swallowing an unknown serum and beginning his change. <br />
<br />
That was it: he had been turning into a bird, and now that there was clear sky above him he would be able to make his escape!<br />
<br />
Jenkins awkwardly got to his feet, failing to notice, or care, where he now was. Instead he flapped his new wings and pushed off with his feet as he took off into the air…<br />
<br />
Or at least that was what he was hoping would happen. Instead all he managed was a silly little jump as his wings slapped loudly against his sides. He looked at his wings in confusion, only to discover that they were in fact flippers!<br />
<br />
The rest of the doctor’s memory flooded back to him as he suddenly remembered what he suspected he had now transformed into. He looked down in horror as he proved himself correct.<br />
<br />
Aside from his flippers, Jenkins now sported a smooth, streamlined body; better suited to water than the air. He was shielded from the elements by a layer of short, backwards-facing feathers that were designed to make him more aerodynamic in the water. Meanwhile his tail and webbed feet now made him an effective swimmer. And lastly he noticed his black and pink coloured beak which would help him snap up tasty fish. <br />
<br />
There was no doubt as to what Dr Jenkins had become: he was now a Humboldt penguin!<br />
<br />
Jenkins looked around in a panic as the implications of this settled in. He was standing near the large pool of the penguin enclosure. Twenty or thirty penguins were in there with him, seemingly in the middle of being fed as they crowded around one of the zookeepers. He cursed his luck. Of all the birds, why did he have to pick one that couldn’t fly!?<br />
<br />
Jenkins continued to look around in panic until he heard the keeper make an announcement. “And that’s the end of this afternoon’s feeding session ladies and gentlemen.” The doctor looked up to see at least a hundred people crowded around the spacious penguin enclosure. “I think our wonderful penguins deserve a round of applause, don’t you?” The audience all clapped happily as the penguins started to waddle cutely away, some of whom then dived into the cool water of the pool.<br />
<br />
“Well that’s the end of this show folks, but if you stick around for five or ten minutes we’ve got one last display lined up for you. You don’t want to miss it, it’s going to be a good one!”<br />
<br />
Some of the crowd then dispersed, although most were clearly eager to see the mysterious final show that the zookeeper had described.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jenkins continued to panic, desperately hoping that the special display didn’t involve him…</p>
