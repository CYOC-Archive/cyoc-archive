<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Woah what hawwwwpened&quot; brayed Zach, his voice light and feminine. He gently rubbed his dark pink mane with three fingered, hoof capped hand. &quot;I feel, weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning, he saw the others. Before him stood a well-endowed Donkey man and an equally stacked Donkey woman<br />
<br />
&quot;What the Hawwwell?!&quot; He brayed, quickly stopping himself as he realized his words were slipping into unintended Donkey noises. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude&quot; Michael moaned as he looked down at his chest. His DD breasts were perfectly taught against the pink of his one-piece, held in the air almost against their own gravity. Gently, he cupped one his breasts. He squirmed slightly as the he felt its supple give, and ample weight.  Without thought, he brought the second hand to his chest. His breasts were almost perfect, an exact approximation of what he&#39;d sometimes pictured late at night when he was alone in his bed and had time to dwell on such often confusing, yet exciting things. His excitement grew, and quickly began to concentrate in his crotch. Gently, he released his breasts and stroked his Blue hands down the sides of his one-peice. The curves, they were toned yet didn&#39;t skimp on just the perfect amount of fat. He rested them on his hips.<br />
<br />
Between his legs, he felt a sudden and alien twitch. A pleasurable contraction of...something that seemed to fill him with an inexplicable need. <br />
<br />
Looking down, he saw the curves only continued between his legs as the suit exposed only the slightest hint of the lips that lay below. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a  hawwww girl!&quot; He cried, throwing his hands up and raising his tail in alarm as the realization suddenly crashed down on him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck man&quot; Zach replied as he studied his shapely, arms &quot;Fuck why&#39;d I have to be a donkey, a girl AND pink.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I had to bet&quot; Came the smooth baritone of Jeremy&#39;s new voice &quot;You&#39;re not a girl, you&#39;re definitely a woman.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zach turned to his friend. Where he expected a short middle schooler he found a towering, muscle bound God of a donkey man. Zach blushed as a strange flutter filled his chest. <i> That&#39;s JEREMEY? </i> he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude &#39;girls&#39; definitely don&#39;t have these&quot; Said Jeremey, a forwardness uncharacteristic of the shy, timid boy. Zach started as he felt a strong, hoofy hand cup one of his breasts. Jeremy had stepped forward, only inches from him now. Zach found his muzzle centimeters from Jeremy&#39;s powerful chest. Between his pecs, there was a mat of thicker, black hair - a donkey approximation of chest hair - that seemed to give off a musk that seemed to speak to Zach&#39;s increasingly feminine mind. Blushing, Zach looked up at Jeremy&#39;s face. There he found a powerful jaw and striking features, features that were undoubtably asinine yet in his new form, translated as handsome. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhhhh&quot; Zach started, against the thickness of his feminine thighs he could feel the Donkey man&#39;s giant package gently brushing.<br />
<br />
The hoof then left his skin as Jeremy&#39;s broke the masculine illusion, sticking his tonge out and blinking one eye. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha, Dude you&#39;re a chick!&quot; he called, a child-like tone entering his words as he stepped back &quot;You have boobs!.&quot; The man bent over in laughter, the occasional braw punctuating his chuckles. Still a child at heart, he was unable to contain himself at the sight of his friends. <br />
<br />
Embarrassed Zach, shied from his friend, arms lifting to cover his heavy chest. Childlike or not, Jeremy&#39;s taunts and laughter were uncharacteristic of the boy. Just an hour ago, he was nervous about even taking a sip of beer. Now he was openly taunting their body. There was something bolder about him, still childlike yet increasingly crude.<br />
<br />
&quot;And If I had to guess, I&#39;d say Michael even LIKES it!&quot; Jeremy continued. <br />
<br />
Michael joined Zach in confusion, Jeremy was never one to taunt. Uncharacteristic or not, the words still stung his shattered masculine pride. At 13, he was the oldest of the bunch by 2 years in the case of Jeremy and 3 in the case of Zach, yet he was a late bloomer and still looked and felt around 10. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, stop it! What&#39;s gotten into you?!&quot; Michael cried back, a heat flushing his face &quot;...It just all feels so new, so weird. I-I don&#39;t want to be a woman! Ick!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeremy grinned at Michael, the jockish nature growing in him took pride at tearing down Michael&#39;s masculinity. The boy had always tried to be the jock of the group, somewhat making up for the fact that at 13, puberty had yet to strike. Something about this body made Jeremy feel bold, as if he could say all the things, he was too shy to say before. He pushed his taunts further. <br />
<br />
&quot;The way you were feeling yourself? Yea right. I bet you&#39;ve wanted to play with some breasts for years. Now you have your own pair!&quot; =<br />
<br />
While younger than Michael, Jeremy was well aware than teens and some pre-teens loved boobs. He couldn&#39;t quite say why, but he knew it was something a 13-year-old like Michael, in his estimation, would like. As he thought about it, staring at Micahel&#39;s well framed chest, he was starting to feel the appeal. Warmth started to fill him.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is not funny!&quot; Zach interjected, anger filling his voice as a single tear fell down his fur. Jeremy&#39;s words clearly hurt the boy turned donkey woman. <br />
<br />
Jeremy&#39;s laughing cut immediately. The sight of the tear seemed to renew his old self, remiding him why he&#39;d never had the courage to taunt anyone before. It was hurtful, mean....<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry...&quot; Jeremy said, his body language melted from the confident jockish swagger he&#39;d slipped into, to the sheepish timidity of 11-year-old Jeremy the human boy. &quot;I-I got a bit carried away. These muscles just feel so good, and that beer. I think it&#39;s making me say things I wouldn&#39;t otherwise.&quot; <br />
<br />
His hoofed hand nervously rubbed the back of his mane as his hind hoof timidly dug into the sand. The contrast between the hulking donkey jock and his timid, childlike manner would have been funny to the others had their changes not been the primary concern. <br />
<br />
Whipping the tear from the pink of his face, Zach briefly closed his eyes and collected himself. Breathing in deeply, his breasts heaved out - something Jeremy couldn&#39;t help but notice. The breath was calming, centering. The sudden burst of tears and anger faded.  Zach wasn&#39;t normally the emotional type, but something about this body just brought out his feelings. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s ok Jer, thhawwt beer. It made me think things I wouldn&#39;t otherwise, dude&quot; He paused hearing his unexpected bray. &quot;It&#39;s STILL making me feel funny. I-I swear I don&#39;t normally cry. I&#39;m not....&quot; His voice quieted, the weight of the word hitting him &quot;...a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea man, Zach is right&quot; Michael chimed in, &quot;I feel so weird, that beer...it did something to our heads.&quot; His hands once again rested on his ample hips, Jeremy noticed one of them gently passing back and forth over the gradually curvature. <br />
<br />
 &quot;How did we not notice this? And why--&quot; Zach added, blushing slightly &quot;Why when I was changing did it feel so, amazing? It was as if the drink was making me want to give in....&quot;<br />
<br />
Rubbing the back of his head Michael couldn&#39;t help but agree &quot;Yea Jeremey, this is serious. I feel...weird. This body&quot; He looked at his blue furred arms &quot;It&#39;s so wrong. &quot; <br />
<br />
Jeremy couldn&#39;t help but feel bad, but for some reason the bad feeling seemed to be dying down. As a human boy, if he&#39;d hurt his friend&#39;s he&#39;d have been thinking about it for hours. He was naturally sensitive. Now, with the buzz of the alcohol was still playing through his mind, the part of him that wanted to taunt, the part of him that found the humor in his friends changed forms was surging once more. He grinned slightly.  His friends always tried so hard to be manly. At the same time, he couldn&#39;t help but find his eyes studying his friend&#39;s graceful new forms. He had never yet felt any interest in women before, yet now, in his new body....there was just something about them. Something that made him feel gooood. Below, he started to feel an odd pressure developing between his legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mike&quot; Zach turned to his friend &quot;Do you feel a weird, er...desire...in the back of your mind? Like, I feel a part of me. A <i>growing</i> part of me...&quot; He looked down at the pink of his fur, some of it beginning to stand on end. &quot;...enjoying this. This body, it&#39;s so strong. I&#39;m-an adult, I&#39;ve never been this well developed. Even if I&#39;m a girl. It&#39;s so...weirdly goood&quot;<br />
<br />
At 10, Zach was still quite young. The strength of his feminine body was a far cry from the weakness of his pre-teen form. His donkey self, it seemed, kept herself in good shape. Not quite a weightlifter by any means, she was clearly someone who frequented yoga. Zach idly began to test the flexibility of his hips, finding his range of motion well beyond anything he&#39;d felt as a boy. <br />
<br />
&quot;...and I&#39;m so flexible&quot; he muttered, a note of pride slipping into his words. Gracefully, he swan dived, fingers reaching passed his toes and head easily bending between his legs. Behind him, his perky ass swiftly popped into the air, tail curled slightly above it. His cheeks tightened in practiced strength, filling his one piece to its fullest. <br />
<br />
From behind, he hardly realized his show was attracting attention. An astonished Jeremey locked eyes with Zach&#39;s  ass. Lips smacking in sudden hunger.</p>
