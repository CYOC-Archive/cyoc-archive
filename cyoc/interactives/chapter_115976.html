<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Did you get that,” Douglas speaking through the phone; “can you do all that before I get home?”<br />
“I’ll try Uncle Yogi,” Darrell answering; “but I can’t get Aunty Joan to move.”<br />
“I’ll take care of that,” Douglas getting up; “you just wrap a cool towel on Joan’s head and try to get her to drink some water.”<br />
<br />
Douglas putting down the phone as he hangs up; he notices that Leon is still there in his office.<br />
“You could have left when Daisuke left,” Douglas not thrilled that the were-lion overheard the conversation.<br />
“I wanted to make sure we were good with each other,” Leon answering; “what with last night.”<br />
“Last night,” Douglas looking perplexed before remember kicking the man’s ass and tossing him through a wall; “oh that. I needed to knock some sense into you,” Douglas shaking his head; “make you look at the big picture versus your narrow field.”<br />
“So are you going to kick my ass again,” Leon eyeing the sheriff wearily.<br />
“If I had the time,” Douglas smiling wryly; “I’d do it in full view of your were-lion pride. But right now I need to get home and deal with an emergency.”<br />
“Go,” Leon nodding; “we’ll talk later I guess. I’m sure Tachibana will want to talk to both of us.”<br />
“That is a conversation,” Douglas pursing his lips; “I’m not looking forward to having.”<br />
“Me neither,” Leon following Douglas out of his office; “and I’m on the council.”<br />
<br />
Leon paused as he watched Douglas leave the building; taking a moment to think, Leon turns around and heads to the cells where Frederick Parker was currently being housed along with some of the men that surrendered after their attempted jailbreak failed; a jailbreak to get Daniel Parker out. Only problem was, Daniel Parker was transferred out of Moon Lake late last night after Sheriff Cooper was given a tip off of the Parker’s planning a bust out.<br />
<br />
“You should have left town,” Leon looking at the mobster now in jail facing many charges of attempted murder.<br />
“What’s it to you,” Frederick looking up; noticing it was Leon Talbot staring him down. “Come here to gloat?”<br />
“I came here,” Leon looking around to make sure no deputy was in eyeshot; “to give you a warning.”<br />
“And what would that be,” Frederick scoffing; “I’m a man with vast resources. Capable of making sure those who cross me suffer; regardless who they are or where they are.”<br />
“What good are those resources,” Leon smiles; “if someone has been taking them away from you. This may be a small town,” Leon staring at the fallen mobster intently; “but everyone in town knows that Benton Knight is not one to cross. I’m not a big fan of the man,” Leon breathing deeply before growling; “but I can assure you, after what you men tried to do last Saturday evening; you won’t have a plug nickel to use to hire a lawyer. Benton will make sure of that.”<br />
“He is but a man,” Frederick answering; “a man with weaknesses; His precious car, his company,” Frederick smiling in return; “his wife and daughter.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t think for one second that Benton won’t defend himself,” Leon growling; opening up the cell door and quickly lunging for the mobster. Growling as he effortless lifts up the mobster by the throat; slowly chocking the man. “Just like I won’t,” Leon throwing the man to the wall; “if you try and make good on your veiled threats.”<br />
<br />
Frederick gasped as he rubbed his throat; stunned that the man could be so strong and capable tossing about like a rog doll.<br />
“I could of done more than making your men wander around naked the Cascadia woods,” Leon staring at the man; “think on that as you take stock of your current situation.”<br />
Frederick just stared as he watched Leon slamming the cell door shut; the telltale click of the lock engaging. Slowly getting up as Leon leaves the cell; vowing to get even with the man regardless of his current predicament.<br />
“I don’t care who you are or how influential you may be,” Frederick mumbling to himself as he sits on the cell bed; “you and this town will rue the day you fucked with me.”<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
Unaware that Leon Talbot made an unannounced visit to Frederick Parker, Douglas barreled on the streets of Moon Lake on his home. Despite his cruiser getting blown up from an RPG during the failed sieged of his police station; Douglas still had his blue ’84 Mercury Marquis; with the diver side door a darker shade of blue than the rest of the vehicle and the cruise control inoperable due to discontinued parts, the four door sedan was mechanically sound. Its original fabric interior stained with many dropped cups of coffees and various ketchup stains; the vehicle was clearly well used.<br />
<br />
Pulling into the driveway and quickly running inside the house; Douglas sighs as he looks at Darrell trying to get Joan to drink water.<br />
“It’s all right Darrell,” Douglas picking up Joan; “I’ll put her into bed and be out to look after you in a moment.”<br />
“Will Aunty Joan be all right,” Darrell asking.<br />
“She will be,” Douglas answering as he places Joan on the bed; her fur hot to the touch as she moans for her mate. “But I must ask you not to interrupt as I tend to her. You will most likely hear lots of loud noises in a short while.”<br />
“What do you mean,” Darrell asking; “What is happening to Aunty Joan?”<br />
“How do I explain this,” Douglas sighing as he guides Darrell out to the kitchen; “Aunty Joan has a desire that needs fulfilling. All woman have it,” Douglas shaking his head; “the longer it goes… dam it, it would be easier to explain if you were older.”<br />
“Is it because she can be furry,” Darrell asking.<br />
“Yes,” Douglas answering; “and when you are old enough to get your tail, you’ll understand what I’m trying to tell you while not telling you. Now let’s get you some food and settled in for the day.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Regina sighed as she sat alone in the kitchen. After getting a phone call from Peter wanting help in getting home from the hospital, despite still being in his fursona and still recovering from a gunshot wound; Regina was half tempted to run over there and hug her son. Glad that he was alright; yet a call from Leon saying he would be home soon stopped her from defuring and getting dressed. In her were-lioness fursona, Regina quietly growled as she flexed her claws; the urge to lunge and attack her husband as he ran out after rutting her last night after getting a phone call from his brother.<br />
<br />
So when the front door open, Regina was halfway to the door from the kitchen when her daughter arrived along with Nate Anderson. Letting her claws retract as she greats her daughter with a silent hug and a polite nod to Nate, Regina lets the two walk to the kitchen.<br />
“I thought you both were spending the day at Nate’s place,” Regina speaking.<br />
“Next door neighbors were complaining,” Jean answering; “elderly normals in bad health apparently.”<br />
“Ah,” Regina nodding; “so what are your plans today then?”<br />
“To continue what we started last night,” Nate chiming in.<br />
“Only here,” Jean purring affectionately; “is dad home?”<br />
“Leon is on his way,” Regina answering; the rage and anger in her drained away as Jean and her mate were present. “And lucky for him,” Regina looking serious; “I would be taking a few swipes at his muzzle with may paw if you two didn’t arrive.”<br />
<br />
“What did dad do,” Jean stunned that Regina would dare to attack her father.<br />
“Leave me alone last night after we rutted,” Regina explaining the phone call that Leon received last night; prompting him to rush out the door and head to the police station.<br />
Jean listened as Nate quietly observed the two were-lioness talk. Listening as Regina told Jean all about Peter and him rutting his doctor despite his serious wound.<br />
“Pete nailed a rabbit,” Jean giggling; “did he eat her out?”<br />
“That is in poor taste,” Regina not amused with her daughter’s humor; “for that I should make you go and pick up your brother from the hospital. He wants to come home today.”<br />
“He’s nuts,” Jean looking bemused; “we are still under a were-alert.”<br />
<br />
“A were-alert that will soon get lifted,” Everyone turning their heads to see Leon at the kitchen entry way; his silent arrival unexpected to everyone. “Frederick Parker was arrested after trying to shoot his way into the police station.”</p>
