<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two Mini-vans pulled up outside a large log home located just outside the small town of Conifer, Montana. The home was quite large, with six separate bedrooms, a large living, dining and kitchen area and was surrounded by a dense pine forest. The contestants would be living in this house for the next six weeks. <br />
<br />
The six contestants got out of the van and began to look around their surroundings. The oldest, Henry, was 37. He was a ruggedly handsome man, dressed in a flannel shirt, jeans and work boots. The second oldest was Jamie, at age 30 who had shoulder length blond hair, was thin, but had a tough exterior. She wore a simple sweatshirt and blue jeans. The third oldest was Nate, who was 27 years old. He had a fairly muscular body, wore a t-shirt and jeans under a hooded fleece jacket. After Nate, it was Kelly, who was 25. She wore a pink parka, a stylish top and high heeled boots, and felt very much out place in her surroundings. Also at the same age as Kelly was Aaron, decked out in tan jeans, a denim shirt and wore wire rim glasses, he also seemed out of place in the environment, but less so than Kelly. Last, but not least was Sara, at age 21, also wore a simple parka over a white t-shirt and jeans, but also wore hiking boots, and was clearly prepared for whatever came their way. <br />
<br />
The front door of the home opened with a creak and all six participants turned and watched as their host, Jennifer Carver, walked out, dressed in a stylish top and leather skirt. Each of the contestants recognized her from the casting sessions, having met her and the other producer, James Romulus. Following her were two cameramen, who moved around her and one shot her as the other focused on the group of contestants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good afternoon,&quot; she said. &quot;And welcome to Dark Village, a new horror themed &quot;reality&quot; show. Designed to give people the ultimate &quot;What-If&quot; scenario. The woods and town are populated by many werewolves. Survive the next six weeks, and you win 3 million dollars. The thing is though, you have to remain human for those six weeks. If you get turned into a werewolf, you lose the money. But hey, you get to be a werewolf, which as far as consolation gifts go, is pretty awesome, I'd say,&quot; said Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Nate seemed visibly excited at the prospect. The others seemed a bit baffled by what exactly the game would entail. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, please come into the house,&quot; said Jennifer, and the other six, along with the two cameramen followed her in. <br />
<br />
All six cast members were blown away by the house. The main floor was large and open, with a living room accentuated by a large wood burning fireplace. Over on the right side was the dining area and kitchen. The kitchen had granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances including a gas range and a large side by side refrigerator and freezer. Upstairs were the six bedrooms, each with a wood carved name tag on the door. The door by the stairs to the second floor was marked confessional, where the cast members could go and record their own thoughts and feelings, like on most other reality shows. It was a small, but sound-proofed room so others couldn't overhear them. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll let you all get settled in. The fun starts tonight, ladies and gentlemen...the wolves will be on the prowl,&quot; she said with a smile, and then exited, leaving the cast alone with the cameramen. <br />
<br />
As the cast ascended the stairs to their rooms, they started talking to one another again.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is an amazing house,&quot; said Kelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, very cool,&quot; replied Henry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder how they'll do the werewolves...if it's animatronics, or make-up...&quot; said Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope it's animatronics, or at least good makeup. Not some cheap Halloween kit make-up,&quot; replied Aaron. <br />
   <br />
&quot;Definately,&quot; replied Nate.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, outside, Jennifer met up with James Romulus. They embraced each other and kissed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe it's finally started honey,&quot; she whispered. &quot;They are going to be in for the shock of their lives.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think we should turn someone tonight. So we can document how they feel going through the transformation, how it changes them,&quot; said James.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that's a marvelous idea. And you're just the man to do it.&quot; replied Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;But the question is, who?&quot; asked James.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like that Nate kid. He got visibly excited when I mentioned turning into a werewolf. I don't think he's here for the money. I think he actually wants to be a werewolf, which would be a nice change. Someone who would actually like being one of us, instead of the usual cursed business.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking Aaron myself,&quot; replied James. &quot;He seems so weak, so nerdy. The wolf would help him overcome that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, lets just leave it to whoever comes out first, I guess,&quot; replied Jennifer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; replied James, his voice sounding deeper, more gutteral. Jennifer looked up at James, watched as his deep black fur slowly grew in around his face and down his neck, his ears growing to points and shifting up his head. Just the thought of turning someone got him so excited, he started to transform. The transformation continued as James grew and swelled, his face pushing out into a snout, baring large fangs, and his clothes tore away, revealing a hulking, black werewolf.<br />
<br />
As night fell on the cool, fall night in Conifer, a chorus of howls rang out in the night.</p>
