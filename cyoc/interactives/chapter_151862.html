<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff put the chronivac away without touching any of the options. Matter of fact, he was so terrified of using it again, that he put it up in the attic; out of sight, out of mind. <br />
<br />
He would go to school for the next few weeks with his mind drifting towards that chronivac machine now and then. But it was getting to be a long enough of a time, that it started to feel like it was just a dream. A dream he was beginning to forget about the details of little by little. <br />
<br />
He was also fantasizing about how shitty it would be to have nothing but those hard, useless hooves instead of his fingers. He would silently masturbate himself into a towel most nights with the horrifying thought of being a donkey, or having his hands replaced with hooves.<br />
<br />
Such a terrible fantasy would ironically make him horny! Then one day, growing bored of the same old fantasy of being a donkey for a short while, he started pretending he would be stuck as one helplessly permanantly. Nobody aware of who he was. Worse, nobody aware he even existed! Just him in his own mind!<br />
<br />
Growing bored of this scenario over time, he thought about that machine he put away in the attic. One Friday afternoon after school, his parent would again be away for the weekend on a business trip. They always trusted their young son. Jeff was always a good, responsible kid. He knew how to cook, clean, and shop for himself. So they trusted him enough to leave him by himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is my chance!&quot; Jeff thought to himself. <br />
<br />
Running up to the attic after his parents left, heart racing, he brought it back down to his bedroom. He booted it up again, and went through the options. <br />
<br />
After much deliberation he chose an interesting concept:<br />
<br />
He would give himself front donkey legs and hooves for 24 hours. The change would take 1 minute. The thought of how hard everything would be to do with long donkey legs and hooves made him really horny. He really wanted to relieve himself, but resisted. <br />
<br />
His penis hard and stiff as a flag pole, he pressed enter once he was satisfied. <br />
<br />
The changes took place instantly, starting at his shoulders! His arms raised in front of him automatically as his shoulders stiffened. Gray fur sprouted on his shoulders under the shirt he was wearing and worked it&#39;s way down his upper arm, lengthening at the same time. Lighter, almost white, fur growing on the underside of his arms.<br />
<br />
Once it reached his elbows, they cracked, forcing his arms to be extended further out in front of him. <br />
<br />
Fascinated, he went to quickly grab his towel. It was really awkward with longer arms that were quickly turning into forelegs. <br />
<br />
He managed to grip the towel in his right hand, as his forearms began expanding and growing fur. <br />
<br />
With 20 second left, he flung the towel on his bed. His penis throbbing for attention. He went to start stripping as he lay on his bed on his belly and use his left arm to pump his begin undoing his belt. But alas, his LEG didn&#39;t have that great a range of motion. His wrists were now turning into ankles, as his hands elongated. With 5 seconds left, his fingers turned into hooves. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy Christ!&quot; Jeff said. &quot;This is fucking wierd! I got the legs and hooves of a donkey! For the next 24 hours! Wtf do I do now!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing next to his bed, forelegs and hooves sticking out, he needed to relieve himself, and do it now! But he can&#39;t grab take his clothes off with these useless limbs.<br />
<br />
He threw himself on his belly across the side of his bed, his waist half off and his dick smashed against the edge of the bed inside his pants with front legs sticking out. Standing back up, he threw himself across the bed. From this position, he was able to bend his elbows, or rather his front knees, downward, resting his hooves on his wooden floorboards with two loud &quot;clops!&quot;<br />
<br />
That set him off. Horny as ever, he very quickly came. <br />
<br />
&quot;Great! I left that directly inside my pants, rather than my towel! Ugh!&quot;<br />
<br />
He decided to test how much of a struggle having hooves instead of hands really could be. He wanted to grab his sheets, and in his mind, he had his fingers still. He could still &quot;feel&quot; them. But hooves don&#39;t have fingers. They are hard and immobile. <br />
<br />
He tried pinching the sheets between his two hooves. But it was stupidly awkward. His forelegs were really long, his hooves really large and thick.<br />
<br />
Sighing, he decided to sit down and look at them closely to see what he has. It was difficult to turn the bottoms of his hooves around so he can see them directly. He stood up to check himself out in his closet mirror. But the closet was closed and he had a normal round doorknob. <br />
<br />
He tried gripping the doorknob between his two hard hooves like he tried doing with his sheets. All he managed to do, was clang hard surfaces against a hard surface. There was go grip at all. <br />
<br />
Sighing again, he quickly sees how frustrating it can get to have legs and hooves instead of arms and hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m stuck like this until tommorrow at 5:00! Great!&quot;<br />
<br />
He sat down, pondering how he should spend his time with the curiosity of what the bottoms of his gigantic hooves looked like nagging at him. Looking over at the time left on the chronivac, only 23 minutes have elapsed. In total!<br />
<br />
Then he felt his stomach rumble.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just great! I didn&#39;t think about at least eating supper before I trapped myself like this!&quot; <br />
<br />
Figuring he should see what he could do, he stood up, legs hanging outward, hooves drooping downward. He went to his bedroom door and was presented with the exact same challenge. Hard, round, smooth, chrome doorknob, specially made for human hands. Not for donkey feet. <br />
<br />
Double challenge: he had to turn it just enough, and swing it inward towards him. This time, he has no large equine mouth to work with, or large powerful body. <br />
<br />
He went to try to rub his head against the knob, but his long legs kept getting in the way. Eventually, he figures out he could use his legs as....well....LEGS! He bent over to try to put his hooves firmly on the ground like they&#39;re meant to do. But his front legs were really long, and he was short. He had to bend them at the knees to get his hooves under him, one leg at a time. He managed to &quot;stand&quot; up on them, but his human feet had to leave the ground. <br />
<br />
He discovered his now-donkey shoulders were easily strong enough to hold him in that wierd position. Unfortunately, his abs weren&#39;t strong enough to hold his human legs in the air very long. He had enough time to rub his head against the knob three or four times before he fell over. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; he said, exhausted. <br />
<br />
He lay on the floor for a few seconds catching his breath and to think. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, shit! Maybe I can use my back fee- my feet,&quot; he caught himself, &quot;to turn the knob.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a scary thought, how readily he came to think of his feet as his &quot;back feet.&quot; Last time, when he was a full donkey, he kept having to remind himself he had back feet and front feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nevermind,&quot; he thought. &quot;I gotta get this door open.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so, he went to get back up. With really long front legs with hooves, he couldn&#39;t just naturally push himself up from the ground. Fortunately, he was young and lithe. With a little extra effort than it normally would otherwise be, he managed to awkwardly get back up on his feet. He turn around with his back to the door, and did the same thing he did when he was facing the door. He sorta &quot;hopped&quot; up on his front legs, and extended his rear legs outward. He managed to grab the door knob between his two feet, and went to turn it. He managed to do that, and started pulling the door towards him. But then, he lost his balance and slammed the door back closed again as he fell on the floor a second time. <br />
<br />
Stunned, he couldn&#39;t believe it! This was HARD! &quot;DANG IT! If only I have my arms and hands back! I&#39;m stuck with these stupid things! Ugh!&quot; <br />
<br />
Getting back up, he tried again. This time, he tried a bit of acrobatics. Long story short, it took a lot of time and effort to use his human feet clad in big, shiny, black boot-like shoes.<br />
<br />
Sitting on his normal knees, he lifted his clumsy front legs off the ground and awkwardly stood up. He then wandered over to his parents&#39; bedroom. Again, the style of the door handles makes it easy for him to swing it open. He wanders into their bathroom to take a look at himself with legs and hooves. <br />
<br />
Wandering over to the vanity sink/mirror, he looks at his donkey legs sticking out of his shirt. He sees the underside of his hooves, and yup. They look entirely indistinguishable from a normal donkey hooves. He could wear horseshoes, if someone were to hammer a pair onto them.<br />
<br />
Not totally satisfied, he wanted to look at his goofy self in the little mirrored alcove. He had a bit of trouble opening the doors, but eventually manages. There he is! Full boy with legs and hooves sticking out. <br />
<br />
He wanted to see what his shoulders looked like, and where his human body ended and his donkey arms began. But, he&#39;s wearing a shirt! He can&#39;t just grab the bottom of the shirt and yank it off. Not with hooves for hands. And he can&#39;t bend his legs inward far enough to reach it, as they are entirely too long and too large. Well, he wouldn&#39;t be able to change himself. That&#39;s for sure! He even thought about trying to use the toilet. But alas, trying to get his jeans down with his belt on tightly, would be next to impossible. And his briefs underneath, even harder yet. <br />
<br />
The idea excited him. So he tried to get undressed. Purposely struggling with it. The entire purpose was to see how difficult life would be with these legs and hooves. He purposely imagined his fingers instead of his hooves, which made him go hard. He desperately wanted to open his hands to just take his pants down and relieve himself. But he can&#39;t! His hooves are stuck in a hard, immobile shape, and the size of those hooves was three times the size of his human hands. They&#39;re very large! <br />
<br />
He could&#39;t take it any more, and decided at least lie flat on his belly in order to hump against the bathroom floor. He didn&#39;t care what mess he made in his pants. The chronivac fixed everything last time anyways. <br />
<br />
Lying with his human legs straight out, abdomen against at the floor, and propped up on his front knees, he imagined his non-existent hands and how trapped they felt as hooves. <br />
<br />
He started grunting with each effort to get him closer to orgasm. Then he tried pretending he could talk. Of course he could if he wanted too. But instead, he was purposely trying to immitate a donkey. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hhee hhaaww hhhee HHHAAWWW&quot; he said out loud, thinking, what if he can&#39;t talk ever again? Thinking how scary it would be for real. <br />
<br />
He came rather quickly and felt the wetness inside his tight briefs under his jeans. He stood up, out of breath and looked down. He could see a slight wet spot in his jeans by his crotch. It immediately started cooling, and it was wet. It felt gross, but he has no way of undressing himself then redressing.<br />
<br />
He could start the shower. Maybe. But then, he would have to contend with completely wet clothes for the next 22 hours.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s also a habit of his to take a big long leak after jerking off....<br />
<br />
&quot;....uh oh....&quot; He said, continuing to stare at his pants. <br />
<br />
Deciding to ignore it for the time being, he wandered downstairs to watch TV. But again, televisions are not designed for donkeys to mess with. They have no need for such things. But he was still mostly human. He could try and at least use the remote.... Which was on the top shelf on the entertainment center.<br />
<br />
Sighing, he went to swipe at it with his hooves to knock it down. All he managed to do was knock it further back. He tried sticking his right foreleg in there, bit his hoof was entirely too large for that not-so-small shelf! No matter how he tried, he kept clapping his hard, shiny hoof on both the shelf, and the top of that space. He tried wiggling his leg into it, but his hoof could never find purchase. <br />
<br />
Giving up, he wandered into the kitchen. He could eat cereal, but he couldn&#39;t use a spoon. He could maybe knock a box of cereal onto the floor and smash the box open and eat it off the floor with his mouth like the animal he partially is. In the end, he decided not to consume anything, for fear of making him have to go to the bathroom more than he already had to. <br />
<br />
He wandered over to the couch to lie down and take a nap. <br />
<br />
Two hours later, he begins waking up. He tries wiping his eyes, but sees the gray furred legs and black shiny hooves of a donkey still attached to him instead of his normal human arms and hands. Bleary-eyed, he tried blinking the bleariness away. He felt he needed to go take a piss. <br />
<br />
Sighing, he wandered back up to his parents&#39; bathroom to see what could be done. He needed to pee. Not real badly, but badly enough to actually go. He tried bending his front legs down to gain a purchase on the tops of his pants. But his legs were entirely too long and too restricted on his small 13 year old body. He couldn&#39;t even lift the bottom of his shirt!<br />
<br />
Sighing, he tried flicking off his shoes. But he&#39;s still wearing his big black shiny, almost boot-like shoes tied to his feet. He must untie the shoes and loosen the shoe strings in order to get them off his feet. He can&#39;t just slip his feet out of them!<br />
<br />
Trapped inside his own clothing, with his fingers similarly feeling trapped as hooves, he was getting horny for the third time in the past 4 hours. This time, it was a gross combination of having to urinate and having to cum.<br />
<br />
His head beginning to buzz, he got back down on his pelvis to rub on more out on the floor. His feet trapped inside his shoes, an itch beginning to develop on the top of his right foot, and his hands trapped as hooves, he got himself off quickly again. <br />
<br />
But that left the problem that he was really feeling like he needed to urinate. He sat up and decided to try and scootch his butt across the floor to see if he could drag his jeans off. No dice! The belt was just simply too tight! <br />
<br />
Getting desperate, he began to bit his lips. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t go to the bathroom! I&#39;m stuck! I can&#39;t even scratch my foot! Hell, I can&#39;t scratch anything! What do I do&quot;?<br />
<br />
That thought left him with a nagging feeling of itchiness. <br />
<br />
Looking at his useless front legs in the mirror to search for an idea, the only one that would come to mind was the unspeakable. He may just have to piss his pants! Nothing he could do about his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the chronivac cleaned up all the mess last time the timer was up. Surely it&#39;ll do the same now. But then again, I have to sit around all day, smelling like piss.....Unless......&quot;<br />
<br />
He quickly went to the tub. He could climb in and turn on the water. But that would leave his with soaking wet clothes for the next 20 hours that he would be trapped in. But then again, he wouldn&#39;t smell like his own piss for 20 hours.<br />
<br />
Getting desperate, he began to cross and uncross his legs. He had to go, and couldn&#39;t waste any more time! <br />
<br />
He stood there, and tried to just pee. But something in his mind kept him from doing so. It didn&#39;t....FEEL right to just piss fully clothed!  <br />
<br />
Using his forelegs and hooves, he tried reaching inwards to his his own body again, desperate for his arms back! But again, he was prevented from really doing so due to the length of those legs protruding out of his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;God damn it! Gotta piss, gotta piss, gotta piss!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, oh, oh!!&quot; he started saying and moaning. He dove into the tub, and quickly sat down. He tried grabbing the water knobs, but alas, he has hooves. All he managed to do was clang then off the wall. They were so long, he couldn&#39;t even lower them enough to the handles without clanging then off the wall!<br />
<br />
Groaning very loudly, he used his back legs. He brought his feet up to the hot knob, but they were trapped inside his black boot-like shoes. He took a couple of attempts to turn it on. He did finally managed to so. It would have been easier without the shoes. The water came out as a trickle. <br />
<br />
Now, to use the drain stopper. It was one of those ones on a chain at the bottom of the tub floor, underneath the spigot. He tried using his feet to maneuver it into place. But with his big shoes on, he couldn&#39;t manage. And he was getting more and more desperate by the minute to piss! <br />
<br />
He tried sitting upright, but his front legs got in the way and banged against the wall in front of him again! Which pushed him back down. <br />
<br />
He lay there on his back in the tub moaning, and he began to tremble. He couldn&#39;t remember when he had to pee soooo damn badly! His front legs and hooves utterly useless, and his desire to have his hands and arms was just as desperate! He was just so limited! His arms and hands felt about as &quot;trapped&quot; as you&#39;d feel in a coffin 6 feet underground! <br />
<br />
His frustration reaching a crescendo, he began banging his right front hoof against the wall. Over and over, and harder and harder. Closing his eyes, his bladder FINALLY let loose! Which made his kick his right human leg like a dog getting it&#39;s belly rubbed. It was such a tremendous relief, that he was squinting and left out a really long &quot;AHHHHHHHhhhhhhhh!!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
His business done, he took a look. His pants were soaked through with urine! And already, it was starting to feel cold and wet! <br />
<br />
Well, his shoes were already wet from the running water. His pants were soaked with piss. He decided to stand up, and approach the tub plug from a different matter. He had to lean over to his left and hang his front legs over the side of the tub and used that leverage to stand up. He then kneeled down on his knees and leaned way back to make room for his long-ass right front leg. With all his might, he bent it downward at the knee, to catch the hoof down low on the wall facing him. He still could get the right angle, so he had to stand up, moved back a bit more, leaned down, and used his right legs to maneuver the plus into position. He was now able to bring his right leg down onto the bottom of the tub so he could play hockey with the plug, using his hoof as the stick. Unfortunately, he stepped on one side of the round plug, and flipped it upside down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaaaggghhhhhh!!!!! He said loudly out of pure frustration. Now he had to try and flip it back around, in addition to getting it in its hole. But the he looked at the spigot, then down at the front of his pants. For a brief moment, he thought of just running the front of his pants under the water. But quickly realized his long ass legs would get in the way of getting close to the spigot like that! In the meantime, he was working up a hunger.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t just his hooves that were a problem. It was the length of his legs as well! <br />
<br />
He never could get his pants clean from the urine. He couldn&#39;t feed himself over the next 20 hours. He certainly could not play video games to pass the time. Using the TV was a major obstacle. He couldn&#39;t even read a book! No way to turn the pages! <br />
<br />
In the end, he had to just sit there endlessly on the couch to pass the time. Sleep eventually took him far away, and he woke up the next day, Saturday, at noon. Then he had to spend the next three hours in utter boredom, smelling of urine, and periodically trying to figure out how best to scratch himself.</p>
