<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake stood there, chained, legs spread wide, taking long pulls on the cigar.  His thoughts were not on what was happening to him, but on how good the cigar tasted, now natural it felt to be smoking it, how good the leather the Bear wore smelled and how good the Bear himself smelled.  He was musky, manly, just what Jake wanted to smell like.  Jake’s cock was fully erect and the Bear grinned wickedly.<br />
<br />
“Ready for the next step in the process, I think.” He said in his rumbling voice.<br />
<br />
The leather clad biker Bear stood before him and took the cigar from his mouth and told Jake to do the same.  Jake obeyed without hesitation.  The Bear then leaned forward, positioned his right hand which held the 'gar behind Jake’s head cupping the back of the skull in his hairy, meaty, paw of a hand.  He looked Jake square in the eye and said, “Open your mouth, I KNOW you want what’s coming next.”<br />
<br />
Jake again wordlessly obeyed, opening wide.<br />
<br />
The Bear, spat in Jakes mouth and instantly, before he could react clamped his mouth over Jake’s.    He invaded the young man's mouth, penetrating it with his tongue.  Jake’s tongue writhed against the Bear’s trying at first to force it out of his mouth, but then relenting, inviting the invader in.  The Bear growled deep in his chest kissing his captive passionately, pulling Jake’s head against his own with his right hand and Jake’s body against his with his left.  Finally, when they separated, with a string of spittle linking their lips, the biker Bear leaned forward and licked Jakes lips and mustache and with the right hand that held the cigar, rubbed Jakes beard stubble with his fingers.  Jake was too dazed to even realize he now had a five day growth of beard on his face, all he knew is he liked the Bear rubbing his paw over his stubbly face, it was sensual, it felt good and it made his balls tingle and his cock leak precum.<br />
<br />
The burly biker growled, “Good!  Ya ain’t no pansy boy anymore.  You’re becomin’ a real man. Growin' up quick an' damn fine!”  He said and moved Jake’s right hand to his mouth, urging him to take his cigar back to the side of his mouth and continue smoking it.  Jake complied without hesitation.  <br />
<br />
The biker Bear nodded, “Yeah, you’re gonna help me make more real men, just like us soon enough.”  The Bear stuffed his own cigar in his bearded mouth, puffing on it as he ran his hairy, meaty hands down jakes torso, feeling the sparse body hair that he knew would thicken into a full pelt like his own soon.  He felt Jake's  developing muscles, he knew would grow in strength and bulk but that was later in the process.  He rubbed the belly that would distend to a half keg real Bear’s belly.  Thought about the tatts he would get put on this unmarked body.  He reached down and cupped Jake’s growing balls in his warm paw and gave them a gentle squeeze.  Jake moaned in his deepening voice.  &quot;Ya like that, dontcha?&quot;  The Bear smiled and jacked Jake a few strokes.  It was more stimulation than the young man could take, he growled, his head rolled back, he sucked deeply on the cigar and blew out thick clouds of bluish smoke.  Jake's body tensed in pure pleasure and he shot his load into the Bear’s paw.  The Bear raised it to his lips and took a lap, tasting Jake’s changed cum.<br />
<br />
“Mmmmm, yer startin’ ta taste like a real man too.  Here, let me show ya.”<br />
<br />
He walked behind Jake, the crotch of his pants still open and his long, thick Bear-cock standing straight out, pointing at Jake’s rear entrance.  He moved up behind Jake, poking at his exposed hole with his cock.  From behind he removed Jake's cigar and raised his sticky paw to Jake’s face.  He began rubbing Jake’s seed into the growing fur around his mouth and Jake’s tongue darted out to lap up what it could before it was all rubbed into his new black beard.<br />
<br />
Then the Bear began pushing at Jake’s hole, smearing precum around it as he put the cigar back in his new creation’s mouth.  Once again Jake puffed the cigar back to hot glowing life.  The Bear moved his strong, muscular, hairy tattooed arms around the front of Jake’s body.  His hairy paws reached Jake's pelvis and he pulled him to him.  Jake writhed and wiggled on the end of the Bear's cock, he wanted the Bear inside of him, he wanted to be just like the Bear, he wanted to have this man’s essence in him, he wanted this Bear’s strength and masculinity shot into his body.  Jake cried out in pain as the head of the Bear’s thick cock began invading him.<br />
<br />
The Bear growled harshly and loudly around his stogie, “Take it like a real man!  Real men don’t cry when they’re fucked.”<br />
<br />
With that he forced his cock into Jake, forcing the virgin hole open.  Jake grunted deeply in reply, he chomped down on his cigar and drew on it hard, but he didn’t cry out.  Jake’s body was covered in sweat that was beginning to take on the Bear’s musky scent.  He realized was beginning to smell manly like the Bear.<br />
<br />
“That’s it bro, you're taking it like a real man now!  Clamp down on my beast and milk me with those ass muscles.”  The biker said as his paws ran over the mat of damp fur now covering the upper portion of Jakes torso on down to Jake’s growing cock and balls.  “You like this don’t ya bro?”<br />
<br />
Jake growled around his cigar in his now fully developed bass, “Oh fuck yeah bro, nothin’ better than gettin’ it from a real man like you.”  Jake's head was swimming in an equal mix of intense pain and pleasure, but the pleasure was beginning to overbalance the pain in his ass.<br />
<br />
The Bear began thrusting in and out of Jake and Jake pushed back with loud passionate growls as his pleasure from being fucked grew.  Clouds of smoke were pouring out of the two men engaged in full on cigar Bear-sex.  It didn’t take long for the horny Bear to empty his thick seed into the changing vessel of new manhood.  Shot after shot of thick Bear cream filled the young man.  Jake trembled all over and bellowed out, cursing as he shot his first load as a real man into the waiting paws of his new lover.  The Bear smeared the seed all over Jake’s belly and chest, bathing his torso in it, raising a paw to Jake for tasting.  Jake removed his cigar and one again tasted his own cum, it was different in taste now than it was just awhile ago.<br />
<br />
They stood panting for awhile, finally the Bear spat out the nub of his cigar on the filthy bathroom floor, Jake’s 'gar being in a similar state, did the same.<br />
<br />
The Bear kissed the back of Jake’s hairy neck, ran his lips over the thick hair that had just grown on his back minutes ago.  He nuzzled his new older lover, sniffing him, licking the sweat from him here and there as he rubbed the cum until dry on Jake’s hairier chest and belly.  Finally, he pulled his cock out of the ass he knew would be his from now on.<br />
<br />
“That was fuckin’ hot!”  The Bear said.  “Now, on to the final steps in yer change.  You ain’t no pussy, pansy boy no more, but ya still need some bulk an’ height on ya if yer gonna be the intimidatin’ sunofabitch ya used to be.”<br />
<br />
Jake caught that last part, his head cleared by the temporary clarity gained by the release of his load and lust.<br />
<br />
“Used to be?”  Jake rumbled.<br />
<br />
“Yeah bro!  I’m makin’ you into my bro.”  the Bear said,  &quot;Yer body needed to be ready to hold his essence.  Ya needed to be at this stage before that could happen.”<br />
<br />
“What…?”  Jake was trying to make sense now not only of his changes, which he was beginning to just now take note of and what the Bear was saying at the same time.<br />
<br />
“See, his body died when he wiped out, flyin’ off a freeway overpass up north of here.  Today’s is the seventh year, to the day, after his death but this,”  the Bear removed from his leather vest pocket and dangled a gold Bear’s head medallion in front of Jake’s face.  The sapphire eyes of the golden bear glowed softly blue and pulsed like a heartbeat,  “This is where his spirit went.  It was on 'im when died.  His name was Jake too, that makes the connection stronger.”<br />
<br />
The Bear placed the medallion over Jake’s head and suddenly, a flash of the accident seven years ago played through Jake’s mind as if he was living it.  He was terrified.<br />
<br />
“It’ll take some time, but eventually you’ll become my bro.  Your memories and personalities will merge with his.  You’ll start rememberin’ all sorts of shit we did together and a year or so from now, I’ll have my Bear back… and then, you and me, we’ll go out and make more men like us, real men, just like before!  A whole motorcycle club full of ‘em.  But first, like I said, we gotta get yer body taller an’ bigger.”<br />
<br />
Jake didn’t hear much after the medallion was put around his neck, he was trying to fight the images, information, thoughts and memories that were insinuating themselves into his young, struggling mind.  It didn’t matter, Bear would fill him in later when he was feeling more like his old self.</p>
