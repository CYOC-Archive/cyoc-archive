<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brian&#39;s dreams were full of hot clown girls at a pool party. They were racing along the pools edge in small bikinis having a water gun fight, their white or pink skin exposed and contrasting with the bright colors of their swim suits. Brian walked out on the deck and watched a white face girl slowly emerge from the water smoothing out her long pink hair, water dripping off her red nose. Brian&#39;s attention was caught by her white body fight to free itself from the confines of the suit. She walks over to him her large feet leading the way. She hugs him and he can feel himself getting wet from the hug but he doesn&#39;t mind as he runs his hand over her smooth pale skin. She leans her head forward and kisses him and he feels a rush through him and closes his eyes. She breaks the kiss and steps back, He opens his eyes and finds a red smudge at the bottom of his vision. Raising his hand he finds his nose now a red ball and his hand chalk white. Looking down at his body he finds it changed also red nipples standing out on his white chest. Looking up he sees the clown slowly start to undo her top....<br />
&quot;BEEP, BEEP......&quot; Brian jolts awake and shuts off his alarm getting out of bed he curses as he realizes his boxers are wet. Stripping them off, he throws them at the bottom of the dirty clothes and stands in front of his mirror. Looking at his six pack he admires his muscles and his light skin, is it paler than last night? He wasn&#39;t sure. Running his fingers over his lips he still can feel the clown&#39;s kiss upon them. He had never seemed interested in clowns before but now he was pulling up pictures of them and dreaming of them. They were silly and fun to watch and looked good. The clown from yesterday….. Brian snaps out of his daze and gets ready for school.<br />
<br />
Patricia woke up and got dressed, putting on her pink and purple panties and making sure nobody could tell she was wearing them through her jeans. Her heart raced at the thought of seeing Brian at school wondering if he would blow her off again. She couldn&#39;t wait till after school and slip into something prettier. He walked into the kitchen, greeted his mother and grabs a box of cereal. <br />
&quot;You look different today.&quot; His mom commented staring at her. Patricia panics and dropped her spoon splashing milk over the counter.<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know you look good.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks, mom&quot; Patricia quickly finished her breakfast and grabbed her bag.<br />
&quot;Have a good day at school Patricia.... I mean Patrick. Why did I call you Patricia?&quot; Patricia had nearly tripped and fell flat on her face but caught herself shrugged and got out of the house as fast as possible. Patricia&#39;s mom stood there washing out her bowl trying to put her finger on what was different. He looked....prettier. Shaking her head she got ready for work.<br />
Patricia ran to school only stopping to check her reflection in a window making sure she was still a normal boy not a pretty clown girl like she was supposed to be. Satisfied she looked like she was normal she ran into school and made her way to first period. Patricia&#39;s heart skipped a beat as Brian entered in all his muscular glory, he looked a little paler and distracted but still hot as ever and sat down in the back row. Patricia snuck a peak at him behind her and found him staring at her. She quickly looked away and tried to pay attention to the teacher going on about x = y something. She felt his eyes on her all class, finally she couldn&#39;t stand it and took another look and sure enough he was looking at her. The bell rang and Patricia got up and walked out, Brian caught up with her.<br />
&quot;Hey Brian, like what you see?&quot; Patricia spat at him, Brian looked a little uncomfortable<br />
&quot;Yea, sorry about that yesterday Patrick. You are good looking, I mean good with it, I mean ........ your cool and all. And I like you hanging around.&quot; Brian looked lost and Patricia couldn&#39;t every stay mad at him. Putting a hand on his shoulder &quot;Hey, it&#39;s ok I am good with it too. Maybe I will see you after school.&quot; And winked at him.<br />
&quot;Yea&quot; Brian smiled and Patrick walked off to his next class. Mary walked up to Brian.<br />
&quot;What are you talking to that loser for?&quot; Brian looked around and saw Mary<br />
&quot;Oh, hey Mary.&quot; And Brian walked away leaving a stunned looking Mary. Brian wondered to himself what he ever saw in Mary as his eyes found Patrick walking down the hall and the image of the clown from yesterday floated in his head.<br />
<br />
Patricia raced home after school and throwing his clothes off he got the box down and nose in hand. He put the glittering lilac ball on his nose and breathed a sigh of relief as the tingles started to flow. His skin flashed white, hair flowed out curly and yellow and much to her delight her chest and butt swelled out to a girly figure. She laughed as a dress and tights formed around her. When the change finished she checked her blue eye shadow and glittering long lashes, licking her pink lips she knew Brian could not resist her. <br />
<br />
Brian dropped his stuff in the garage as his heart pounded. Would she show up again today? She filled his mind, her sweet smell and her pink lips, the feel of them on his lips and her warmth against his body. He grabbed his soccer ball and went into the backyard and tried to practice like he always does. Needless to say but he sucked; he missed every goal he tried to make. He kept checking around for her presence every time he heard something. And then a sweet smell reached him and he felt her warm presence behind him. His heart beating out of his chest he turned and there she was. Looking silly in her orange dress, her yellow hair blowing softly in the wind. Everything in his life disappeared, nothing mattered but her. He ran to her and grabbed her in a big hug before leaning in for a kiss.<br />
&quot;I thought about you all day. You left so fast I didn&#39;t even get your name.&quot; Another kiss, his hands moving down her back.<br />
&quot;Patricia. I have thought about you for a long time. You were watching me today and I couldn&#39;t stop thinking of you.&quot; More kissing his hands finding her butt but the statement finally sunk in to Brian.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; He had to go on kissing her.  <br />
&quot;You said I looked good. I realized that I want to be with you and so I changed.&quot; Patricia felt a tug in her crotch before a sucking sensation started to tug harder and she felt her boyhood disappear inside her and she was everything she wanted to be.<br />
&quot;Patrick?&quot; He asked as he kissed her again<br />
&quot;Do you want to be with me?&quot;</p>
