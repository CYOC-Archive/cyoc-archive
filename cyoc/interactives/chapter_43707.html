<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris tried not to look at the rack of children's books as he walked through the supermarket.  Normally that wouldn't be difficult, he was in his early twenties and had no interest in picture books ... usually.  The problem was that now there was a new Little Mermaid book out.<br />
<br />
Chris had wanted to be Ariel since he was a little boy, though if he had been the one in the story there would have been a very different ending.  Give up on being a mermaid for some guy?  Insanity.  For one thing Chris wasn't attracted to men, for another ... it was just plain crazy.  In what way could living on land possibly be better than being a mermaid?<br />
<br />
So he desperately wanted to pick up the book, look at Ariel, and imagine that he was the little mermaid.  This had the added bonus that it was a prequel, so she'd still be a mermaid at the end.  What he definitely didn't want was for anyone to see him showing an interest in a picture book for little girls.<br />
<br />
Somehow he found himself back by that rack of books several times, but he never gave the book more than a glance.  Someone might notice.<br />
<br />
When he went to the checkout line he was confronted with The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning on DVD.  He considered just grabbing it.  Who would care?  The cashier wouldn't judge, might not even notice what DVD it was.  If anyone asked he could say it was for a cousin, but he didn't do it.  Just got his groceries and went to his car.<br />
<br />
Then he noticed something.  Sunlight was reflecting off of something shiny outside of the parking lot, just above the high tide line.  It was probably litter.  Something that fell out of the parking lot, or washed in from the ocean.  Chris decided that it was time someone did something about litter, locked his car, and climbed down to the shiny thing.<br />
<br />
When he got to it he found it was a medallion.  As soon as he picked it up something told him to go into the sea.  He got pretty deep when suddenly he felt as if he'd been hit in the nuts.  He collapsed into the water, but the feeling soon passed.  Then he was presented with a new problem, his pants didn't fit right for some reason.  He wasn't sure if they'd shrunk or what, Chris just knew it didn't feel good.  He struggled to get them off, and as soon as he did felt his legs change.  This too was painful.  Without thinking he gasped.<br />
<br />
When the water flooded his lungs Chris felt no pain, not even discomfort.  It was as if that was what he was meant to breathe.  The pain in his legs passed and he reached down to feel what had become of them.  What he found was a tail.  He looked at it wide-eyed but was soon distracted by a new feeling.  Thankfully this one was not painful.  It was a simple warmth in his chest.  He pulled off his shirt to get a closer look and saw two breasts quickly developing.  He cupped one in each hand, they felt nice.  When they finished the warmth spread throughout Chris' entire upper body.<br />
<br />
Chris found himself, or rather herself, floating just below the surface thinking about how great things were.  Feeling her face had revealed feminine features, the parts of her body she could see indicated she was now a copy of Ariel from The Little Mermaid, all the way from the tip of her tail to the red hair floating in front of her face.  All she was missing was the seashell bra, but that probably wouldn't be comfortable anyway.<br />
<br />
Chris swam away looking forward to a life of adventure and hoping she wasn't the only lesbian mermaid.<br />
<br />
The medallion was forgotten, but it had disappeared anyway.  There were more people in need to changing.</p>
