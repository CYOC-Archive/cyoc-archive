<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat later went back outside to check on the sleeping donkified Dan. Her former brother. As she went outside, her parents came home. It has since stopped raining. <br />
<br />
She greeted her parents, and excitedly told her mother how she so easily passed her first test. Then she presented Dan. <br />
<br />
Dan started to wake up, confused and disoriented. Her mother said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Kat! I&#39;m so proud of you! But, ssshh...he&#39;s waking up! Mr Kaufman, the farmer, will be here first thing tomorrow morning to collect his new property. Until then, we do not want him causing any sort of trouble. I&#39;ll show you how to cast a minor mind-altering spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
She taught Kat how to make a human mind go back to sleep for a set number of hours. Dan would be waking up, just as they would be transferring their Amish customer&#39;s new property over to him. He would break him in right away, with the use of a large draft horse. But that&#39;s for another time. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Kat&#39;s energy was used up. Her mother told her to go study her human mind-altering book, as Kat expressed interest in that particular area. <br />
<br />
Going up to her bedroom, she began to read. She came across a spell that would render a human mind completely incapable of understanding what other people are saying, while leaving their own language center and intelligence intact inside their own minds. This was meant to cause some humiliation at inopportune times. It was mostly just a fun little spell. But Kat had a great idea:<br />
<br />
She&#39;d use it on Dan! And make it permanent! Hahaha, he would be stuck in his own brain, shoved inside the skull of a disgusting old donkey! All communication completely lost to him! Neither would he ever understand another person&#39;s speech, nor would his physical donkey body be able to speak. He would never be able to demonstrate any sort of intelligence to prove to a &quot;do-gooder&quot; that Dan was actually a human-turned-donkey. <br />
<br />
Better yet, she wanted to make sure he knew it too. So she held off on casting that particular spell, until she&#39;s had a little talk with her dear brother. No. Not her brother. It&#39;s embarrassing to even think that a smelly old donkey would be related to her.<br />
<br />
The next morning comes around, and Kat tells her mother her plan before the customer would arrive. This particular Amish man owned a truck with a horse trailer, but someone else was driving it. The Amish don&#39;t drive vehicles. Only horse-drawn carriages.<br />
<br />
Kat told her mother her plan, and her mom was even more proud of her daughter! Kat is very creative, on top of demonstrating early power. But mind-altering spells are not easy. Matter of fact, altering a powerful human mind is one of the most difficult things to do. So her mom would be assisting her. Watching over her. Just in case.<br />
<br />
Half an hour before the agreed-upon time, Kat finds Dan still in the backyard. He hadn&#39;t even escaped. While the idea did cross his mind, he was in denial that they would just sell him like ordinary livestock! Besides, he reasoned, Kat and his mom know who he is, and they have the power to change him back to his old self. They&#39;re his only chance at escape from this nasty, humiliating position. Surely, the mother he loved his entire life, and who took very good care of him, could not possibly be this cruel? He wondered why she would allow this even temporarily.<br />
<br />
Kat approaches Dan and grabs his attention. Knowing full well that Dan is still in there, still inside that skull of that donkey&#39;s she gave him, she talked to him like she would on any other ordinary day. <br />
<br />
&quot;So. I have a surprise for you,&quot; Kat said to him. He started to get his hopes up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to practice mind-altering techniques, starting with you. MY mom will be assisting me, in order to correct any mistakes I may make.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, the spell I shall be performing, will alter your understanding of language. You&#39;ll still keep your own ability to think jn English, like you do right now. You&#39;ll also keep your full intelligence, all of your memory and education and so forth. But I will make it so you will be unable to understand what humans, like me and Mom, are saying whenever you&#39;re around them. You will not understand a lick of spoken English, or any other language, like any other ordinary donkey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said, you&#39;ll continue to be able to think in English in your own mind. You just will never hear actual English words when they&#39;re spoken out loud by a human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, you&#39;ll lose your ability to read and write. Donkey don&#39;t really need those anyway. You&#39;ll be working a field day after day. No need for you to know how to read and write in silly human words.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The idea is to prevent you from ever demonstrating any sort of intellect to any human. Particularly not to any other witch or warlock. We don&#39;t want a do-gooder with powers ever figuring out your not actually a donkey in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, this spell is to prevent you from being able to communicate with a person in any sort of meaningful way. Which means, you will never know to respond to any sort of spoken or written command. You cannot respond properly, if you cannot understand what&#39;s being said or written.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;For instance:<br />
<br />
If someone asked you what 2+2 equals, you will not understand what they said. Therefore, you will not be able to respond to such a question. They might as well be asking you that question in Swahili as far as you&#39;d ever be concerned. Therefore, all anyone will ever know you to be, is just a dumb, non-sentient donkey! Matter of fact, most donkeys will be able to learn what a few words and phrases mean, and respond appropriately, demonstrating at least some sentient intelligence. Heck, most animals can understand some words and phrases. But you? You&#39;ll be left without a shred of understanding! A natural-born donkey will understand our human speech than you will when spoken outloud! Haha!<br />
<br />
And also, it you will inevitably lose track of the days and weeks as they pass. Even if a human near you says what date it is, for all you know, they could be talking about dinner. I&#39;m not going to inform you who you&#39;re new owner is, nor where he lives. You&#39;ll be left totally in the dark about ordinary details.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shocked, Dan started getting mad. He went to rear up on his hind legs to strike his sister down. But as he did so, his front legs fell back to the ground and stuck there! <br />
<br />
He tried lifting each of his four limbs, one by one. But it was as if he was nailed directly to the ground!<br />
<br />
Kat&#39;s mom threw out an immobilizing protection spell at Dan. Which prevented a person from acting violently.<br />
<br />
&quot;EEERRGGHH HHHAAWW EEERRGGHH hhaaww eeerrggghh hhhhaaaaaaaaaaawwwwww!!!!!&quot; Dan screeched, unable to lift any of his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, shut up!&quot; Said Kat.<br />
<br />
Then she started chanting. Words that didn&#39;t make much sense. And only becoming less and less sensible as she chanted. She then ended by pointing at him. Once the spell was complete, he heard his mom....his former mother....say something to her. But he couldn&#39;t make out the words! He almost could, but they made no sense!<br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrgghh Hhhaaww&quot; Dan said, shaking his head.<br />
<br />
Then they both made a wierd noise together. Laughter! They were laughing at him! <br />
<br />
His mom turned towards him and said something. But what? Dan just stood there looking at her with his dull, blank, dark donkey eyes, in his expressionless face. He tried speaking, but instead said &quot;EEERRGGHH hhaaww!!&quot;<br />
<br />
In reality, Kat&#39;s mom was testing the spell. She asked Dan to keep quiet. Not to make a noise, and to shake his head up and down . Instead, all she heard was a &quot;EEERRGGHH hhaaww,&quot; and almost coincidentally, Dan did shake his head. But it was mostly from side-to-side and not up-and-down.<br />
<br />
They both laughed, and the mom congratulated her daughter. Then in mock derision, she said to Dan:<br />
<br />
&quot;If you can understand what I&#39;m saying, I&#39;ll go ahead and release your left leg from my limb-freeze spell. I want you tap your left hoof three times without making any noises, and I&#39;ll turn you back into your human self.&quot;<br />
<br />
A blank stare, followed by &quot;eeerrggghh hhhaawww!!&quot; Which confirmed to the two witches that the spell worked! He truly could no longer understand human speech! And of course, humans could not understand his unintelligent braying. He would be truly isolated. Stuck inside his own mind; inside his very limited, humiliating, lowly body. The only thing he&#39;ll understand in his future, is domination by a large black alpha male draft horse, and another irritable alpha male donkey. <br />
<br />
Matter of fact, both animals he will be stabled with, will have some limited understanding of certain spoken human commands. And they are natural-born animals! Dan will forever be completely and totally unable to understand a lick of spoken language. All he can ever do, is think internally to himself. And voicing any of his thoughts outloud, will only have him say:<br />
<br />
&quot; EEERRGGHH HHHAAWW!!&quot;</p>
