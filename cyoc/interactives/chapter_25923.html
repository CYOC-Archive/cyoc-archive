<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ten in the Evening, September 23, 2006, Freelancer Motel.<br />
<br />
Vix pulls her black mustang into the motel she previously stayed at. She took her laptop and replaced the batteries in her cell phone. Her visit with Agent Wendy Patel went exactly as she suspected; it was meant to confront Wendy of the consequences of her actions and to determine if she was going to be a threat to the investigation. Vix wanted to kill Wendy for being a lycanthrope, but she couldn’t do it. First off, it would have aroused too much suspicion on already complicated matters. Wendy’s family was on the way, the pack she was with knew she had survived, and there was already a rogue agent out there. Second, Vix felt some kinship with Wendy. She had previously read Wendy’s profile and saw that she attended the same ROTC academy as Vix, though at a different time. Vix knew how difficult the training was, having to rely on other students for support herself gave Vix a sense of sisterhood with all those that attended. She couldn’t bear herself betraying that bond by killing another in cold blood.<br />
<br />
Sighing, Vix checked her voice mail as she made her way to her room. Skipping all the messages Blackhorn had sent her, she found a message from Sergeant Thompson. She started the playback. “Hello? Oh, (throat clear) Thompson from command post reporting that we’ve completed the search on all the sectors.” Vix gave a slight smile figuring already what the result was. “We couldn’t find him,” Bingo, her smile widened, “and we had a report that a car was stolen on Virginia Road.”<br />
<br />
Vix’s smile faded, and narrowed her eyes, “I knew I should have ran that hitchhiker over!” she thought. “Now their chasing some bum while Dan is already on the loose.” She was about hit the delete button until she heard the next part of Thompson’s message.<br />
<br />
“The driver of the stolen vehicle gave us the description, its Dan Ramer.”<br />
<br />
She suddenly stopped walking, nearly dropping the cell phone. Her eyes were wide in disbelief, soon replaced by a mark of irritation. <br />
<br />
“It happened an hour ago. We suspect he might be heading somewhere to lay low for awhile so we’re going door to door. I’ll keep you in the loop if we find anything. Thompson out.”<br />
<br />
Checking the time stamp on the message, she realized that the message was 4 hours old<br />
She immediately stomped to her room. Placing her laptop not too lightly on a table and taking off her heels, she threw herself on the bed. “How could he be so stupid?” She repeated to herself. Then it dawned on her, “How could I be so arrogant?” Never had she knowingly outsmarted herself. Her thoughts turned to all the possibilities that would have ended this hunt sooner. She slowly started drifting off asleep…<br />
<br />
She then realizes that a hot bath would calm her nerves. It’s been a long day and she needs a break. Looking over to make sure the blinds are down, she starts to undress. Her navy-blue blouse being snug on her, she starts ceremoniously unbuttoning herself, feeling the release of pressure off her chest; she lets out a deep sigh. Sitting upright, she loosens her pants. Slowly, she turns herself bed side, leaving her blouse on the bed sheets. Standing up, her pants gracefully glide down her smooth shapely legs, revealing her perfectly tanned skin. Stretching out, her body shudders with invigorating energy. Her hands swiftly move behind her neck, unbuckling a silver necklace of an angelic cross, a small keepsake that had help in her in a time of need. Placing it carefully on an adjacent table, she made her way to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
She pauses briefly, admiring herself in the mirror. Soon, her D cup bra is left fluttering down; both breasts perk with anticipation of a soothing treat. Kneeling next to the tub, she turns on the water letting it fill to her hearts content. Finally she disposes of her black panties showing a clean shaved underbrush. Patiently, she waits, occasionally caressing herself to keep her warm with enticement. Her eyes glimmer as the steam pours upward. Stopping the flow, she steps in. The warmth was intoxicating. She slides down into the water, letting it cascade across body. Her tension melts from the sensation, finally able to relax.<br />
<br />
She lay there for what seems like hours, the warmth never fading…<br />
<br />
*thump, thump, thump.*<br />
<br />
Vix instantly came out of her trance. Quickly, she sits up grabbing on a towel draped nearby, searching around in alarm.<br />
<br />
*Thump, Thump, Thump.*<br />
<br />
She made her way out of the tub, rapping the towel around her. Quietly, she opens the bathroom door, looking over the dark bedroom, a menacing shadow emerging through the blinds.<br />
<br />
*THUMP, THUMP, THUMP.*<br />
<br />
Vix reaches for a drawer and pulls out a revolver. Cautiously, she loads in several .44 magnum rounds.<br />
<br />
*CRACK, CRASH!*<br />
<br />
Splinters erupt inward. Vix ducking behind the bed could only see a large burly figure with a light source right behind it.<br />
<br />
“FREEZE!” Vix shrieks, aiming her load revolver. She couldn’t see who it is, but she has a good enough view to hit her mark.<br />
<br />
The large figure hesitates briefly, but then gave a low growl that sounds like a chuckle of sorts. It then lunges across the bed at Vix.<br />
<br />
*BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM *click*<br />
<br />
The force of the bullets impact pushes the figure back outside the door. Vix was breathing heavily, having empty a revolver on her quarry. She starts to calm herself and stands up. Looking outside, she sees the radiance of a full moon that blinded her from identifying her assailant. Taking a closer look, she recognizes that it is a werewolf.<br />
<br />
“Groan…” It starts to get gather its bearings and rise.<br />
<br />
With grim determination, Vix races back to the drawer and pulls out more rounds. “No…” she murmurs in horror, “The rounds… they’re NOT SILVER!” She frantically scatters the bullets trying to find at least one. It isn’t until hearing the growls of the lycanthrope that snaps her back to her predicament. She watches as it raise itself on all four, her hands shaking, desperately trying to reload the revolver. Her gaze transfix into its golden yellow eyes. Her heart drops, right when the wolf pounces. It clears the bed and hits Vix in the chest, launching her backwards into the bathroom. Vix smashes onto the floor with the wolf on top of her, pinning her down under the weight of the massive beast. She opens her eyes only to be once again meeting that of her attacker’s. It moves against her, brushing itself under her, closing its jaw around her neck. “No…” Vix whines, realizing what is happening. Wasting no time, it buries itself in her, grunting, panting, taking her as one of its own. She cries out in agony as warm fluids fill her. Thick lush black fur blossoms through her body, spreading from where both made contact. The fur expands to her hands and feet as they become deadly claws. Her fangs start growing; her face elongating to accommodate her change, her black, tear filled eyes turning a predatory golden-yellow. She feels her spine stretch, forming into a long elegant tail. Slowly, her gurgle cries shifts into an echoing howl.<br />
<br />
With resounding strength, she pushes the male out of her way. Bounding up in one swift motion, she leaps out of room. Once outside, she stands up on two legs. Illuminated by moonlight, she exposes herself in all her glory. <br />
<br />
Her mind fills with fear of what she now is. Hatred, anger, and sorrow bombarded her thoughts as she tries desperately to keep herself in order. Looking upward, Vix peers into the full moon. Suddenly, everything is replaced by calm, peace, and tranquility. “Something is wrong,” she told herself. Her eyes narrow at the moon. “The moon isn’t supposed to be full!” Looking down at herself, she raises her left arm in front, her palm facing at her. Hoping it is what she thinks it is, she sticks her right middle and index claw out. Closing her eyes, she taps her wrist two times uttering one word, “Awake!”<br />
<br />
Vix startled into conciseness. She was drenched in sweat and her breathing was labored. Looking around, she was in her motel room. The door was still intact and she was still wearing her clothes. She immediately opened a drawer to find a small book and pen inside. Opening it, she quickly started writing:<br />
<br />
September 23. Entry 469<br />
I had another nightmare, this time while I was on duty. It started the same way as before, but something was different about this one. I wasn’t turned into a blood thirsty werewolf. I had control of myself and was able to wake up using the taps. But during that brief time as a werewolf, I felt something that I’ve never felt before in my nightmares. Peace…</p>
