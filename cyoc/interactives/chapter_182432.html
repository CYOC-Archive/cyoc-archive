<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Liam had taken his sweater back three days ago much to Madeline’s dread. It was her favourite of his hoodie’s. It was so comfy and warm, plus it smelled like him to boot. She’d missed it since the moment he had demanded it back and she couldn’t pout her way back into ownership of it. Liam was just sick of her taking his clothes, but why would she stop? She was his girlfriend. It was her right to wear all his hoodies.<br />
<br />
Thankfully Liam had been doing laundry and that left a perfect opportunity for Madeline to take it back.<br />
<br />
She slipped into the laundry room the second his dryer beeped and dug into the clothes inside. It didn’t take long for her favourite hoodie to come back to her. A soft blue one with the university sports logo on the front and Liam’s last name on the back. That would be her last name one day. She couldn’t wait to one day be Mrs. Madeline Park.<br />
<br />
“Oh I’ve missed you,” she sighed, pulling the warm hoodie over her head and adjusting it. It was far too large for her body but that only made it more comfy and warm. Liam always hated when she wore hoodies, claiming he didn’t like her beautiful figure hidden behind frumpy and loose fabric. He’d always been the type of guy to demand she show a little skin, but it wasn’t her fault it was always so cold.<br />
<br />
She snuggled up in his hoodie, even fresh from the wash it reminded her of his manly scent. She inhaled deeply and rubbed her face in the fabric before sighing and walking off to class, now incredibly comfortable.<br />
<br />
She had History first thing in the morning and sat there listening to her professor drone on and on about ancient Inca farming techniques. Thing were normal until the girl behind her tapped her shoulder and said in an annoyed tone. “Can you move over a bit, I can’t see past your head.”<br />
<br />
This was odd, Madeline was not a tall woman, she didn’t even cross five foot five. She’d never blocked anyone’s view in her life so she couldn’t really do anything but move aside and get back to failing to listen to the speech her professor was giving. Her new seat must have been smaller than her last one, because she barely fit in it, her legs felt like they were being squished, the aisle must have been smaller there because her knees were pressing into the chair in front of her. Even the guy sitting one chair before her wasn’t bugging her. She could see over his head.<br />
<br />
When she left that class with all the other students she was so engrossed in her phone that she didn’t notice she was suddenly standing at the immense height of six foot two and towering over her classmates.<br />
<br />
The chairs were tiny in her Physics lecture too, and she kept moving about trying to find a comfortable spot. Her head gained a chill during this time so she threw the hood of the hoodie over it, failing to notice her dark hair receding into her scalp until it was a short. She kept scratching her face, failing to notice a beard was growing from her chin, her jawline buffed up too alongside her cheekbones falling lower. She had the face of a hot guy by the time Physics ended and the rest of her body was starting to follow suit.<br />
<br />
During lunch she found Liam’s hoodie to feel rather tight for some reason. It pressed against her breasts and pulled them backwards. She didn’t notice that she not had a wide and manly frame, the dark skin in her chest growing hairy while her breasts slowly receded and became manly pecs. She kept coughing and every cough made her voice sounded deeper and sexier. She was now looking like a man from the waist up and that changed further in English class.<br />
<br />
She felt really uncomfortable in the chairs. Her ass had turned into that of an athletic male and she wasn’t used to the shape. Her hips get less flared out and she kept having to adjust her pants for some reason, her crotch feeing uncomfortable. Her shoes felt too tight, her bra was strained. In all honesty the only part of her clothing that fit was her hoodie and even that was a little tight.<br />
<br />
You could see a bulge growing in her, or rather his, pants. Several girls in English class paid more attention to “Mitchell’s” big cock pressed against his pants than the discussion of Dracula they were having. Even when his clothing began to change and size to match him the girls could still see the vague outline of Mitchell Booker’s big black cock. They all wanted to date him, he was this smart and handsome guy on the teams who surprisingly wasn’t dating. How did a cock, I mean a man, that nice go without a girlfriend? It was a mystery and Madeline found all her classmates staring at her and found some of them weirdly attractive.<br />
<br />
She wasn’t into girls, she only had eyes for Liam Park, and yet a bunch of the girls in her class were suddenly looking nicer than normals. Pretty blondes, delicate and curvy Asian girls, and tan girls with gorgeous South American accents. Why was she suddenly staring aimlessly at Carrie Beck’s perky chest? Why did she like the look of Francis Lout’s ass pressed into that chair? Why did Zilka Wright’s flirty looks make her chest fill with butterflies.<br />
<br />
She didn’t know what was going on until she shambled down the hallway after English had ended. She bumped into Liam there and found she was taller than him. She looked down for the first time that day and found her breasts were nonexistent, her body frame was huge, and she had a big dick in her pants that put even Liam’s to shame.<br />
<br />
“Hey bro,” Liam greeted with no flirtation or love in his eyes. “Think you wound up with my hoodie after the last game.”<br />
<br />
“Wha?” Madeline asked before turning and exposing the word Park on the back of her ill fitting hoodie. He was so warm and overheated in the thing so taking it off wasn’t that bad. He handed it to Liam sheepishly and found rather quickly that Liam wasn’t his boyfriend anymore. Liam was just his bro.<br />
<br />
This was wrong, he still loved Liam, he wanted to be Mrs. Madeline Park. But that wasn’t possible anymore. He was now Mitchell Booker and judging by the stirring feeling in his pants he was attracted to girls just like Liam was. He wasn’t Madeline anymore, in fact Liam was single and flirted with a girl right in front of him in that hallway.<br />
<br />
“Hey Mitchell,” Kiara Bookley called out while pausing next to him all sweetly. “I was wondering if you wanted to maybe study together.”<br />
<br />
He looked at the redhead next to him, such a beautiful girl with such a nice round ass and knew in that moment that he wasn’t even attracted to Liam anymore. He wanted to ram his new dick into his girl’s rear end and play with her breasts and she wanted him to do all those things.<br />
<br />
“Sure,” he sighed in defeat. “Let’s go study...”</p>
