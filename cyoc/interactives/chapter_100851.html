<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After parking the car at the curb, the Lawson family got out and started walking to the two-story house in front of them, when Nate Anderson stepped out and greeted them on the front porch.<br />
After the brief introductions, Nate said, &quot;Everyone else is inside, although my younger brother Eric is upstairs trying to finish his homework at the moment.&quot;<br />
&quot;Speaking of homework, can I talk to you about that math assignment?&quot; asked Spencer, hoping Nate would take the hint.<br />
&quot;Sure. Just a sec,&quot; said Nate, holding the door open for her parents. Her father actually smiled at the thought of Spencer wanting to discuss homework as he entered the Anderson house.<br />
Once the front door was closed, Nate led Spencer off the porch and asked, &quot;Are you okay? Ben told me what happened.&quot;<br />
Not sure how to feel about that, she simply said, &quot;I&#39;m under house arrest for the weekend, except for this. When did you talk to Ben though?&quot;<br />
&quot;Besides Ben, his moms, and his boyfriend being part of our dinner party, the Twists are our friends and next door neighbors,&quot; explained Nate.<br />
&quot;Oh. Speaking of parties, who&#39;s the werepanthress?&quot; asked Spencer, eyeing him carefully.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; quickly replied Nate.<br />
&quot;Oh. One of <i>those,</i>&quot; said Spencer, realizing what was going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Nate, curious, but cautious.<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve only been in Moon Lake what? A couple of months? And a were a little less than that?&quot;<br />
&quot;We arrived in early June, and everyone but Eric was a were by the 4th of July weekend.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see. Well, considering I have more experience on the subject of weres, let me clue you in,&quot; said Spencer, looking around again to make sure they wouldn&#39;t be overheard. &quot;Some werepanthresses are not only territorial, but possessive as well.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Nate, now a bit concerned.<br />
&quot;When they see someone new they&#39;re interested in, it&#39;s an instant attraction. And things may go great for a while. But in time the newness wears off so, even if you follow and obey whatever guidelines she established, unless you start connecting with each other on more than just a sexual level, as soon as the next <i>new</i> thing comes along...&quot;<br />
&quot;I was afraid of that,&quot; admitted Nate. &quot;I&#39;m hoping things change though, because even though my folks want to meet the mysterious new girlfriend in my life, I do have permission to leave after dinner and spend the weekend with her, provided she stays on her were-birth control pills.&quot;<br />
&quot;You mean right now, they know absolutely nothing about her?&quot; asked Spencer in disbelief.<br />
&quot;Only that it&#39;s a she, we&#39;re sexually active, and I&#39;m interested in her. The way she talks some times though, if she knew my folks were even aware of that much...&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, if it don&#39;t work out for you...&quot;<br />
And then Spencer kissed Nate. A long, deep, passionate kiss (especially for her, allowing Spencer a chance to release some of the pent up sexual energy that had been building inside) that ended with both of them barely able to keep from changing into their were forms, ripping each other&#39;s clothes off, and mating right in the front yard.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
The Lawsons met the Twists and Andersons, then sat down among the living room chairs and sofa to exchange pleasantries while dinner finished warming up.<br />
Being sister werecats, Maggie already knew Samantha and Frances from her previous time living in Moon Lake, but was not only interested in renewing her friendship with them, but getting to know the werevixen Martha Anderson <i>much</i> better.<br />
Evan Lawson couldn&#39;t help observing the ladies eyeing each other, and privately wondered how much of an active participant William Anderson was in his wife&#39;s... extracurricular affairs. He had no way of knowing William had discovered and encouraged Martha to embrace her bi-side while they were in college, let alone the fact that becoming werefoxes together had strengthened the already existing bonds between them to the point where Martha would always stray for fresh pussy, but her life/mate husband was the only man in her life, sexually or otherwise.<br />
The werewolf within him couldn&#39;t help smelling all the pheromones that the ladies were (subconsciously?) releasing, and wondered what might actually be for dessert tonight.<br />
However, being straight, all the males were definitely off the menu, as far as he was concerned; but Evan couldn&#39;t help wondering if the lesbian couple ever went bi and had a <i>real</i> man every once in a while, not knowing how far Samantha and Frances actually went during the weekly Anderson/Twist orgies.<br />
<br />
Sitting next to her husband, the ever horny bi-werecat couldn&#39;t help sizing up the company before her either, but Maggie Lawson had slightly different thoughts.<br />
She would definitely make sure to have some private time with any, or ALL, of the other ladies at their earliest convenience.<br />
Whether or not Maggie could have William on the side once in a while, or had to make it a threesome with Martha remained to be seen, but she knew either way her husband wouldn&#39;t mind as long as she always came home to him at the end of the night.<br />
Nate Anderson would be a bit of a challenge, but one Maggie Lawson looked forward to if the opportunity presented itself, since she hadn&#39;t had a teenager since she was that age herself. Besides, in Moon Lake, a sexually active were past their first transformation was legal no matter what age as long as all parties were willing participants, and what sexually active were wasn&#39;t willing for sex if the opportunity arose?<br />
It was Ben and Alex that Maggie considered the REAL challenge. She wondered if it was possible to seduce either or both to some bi-action, for she realized that besides being experienced with their werewolf penises, the couple would both be virgins as far as women were concerned.<br />
<br />
However, if Maggie and Evan Lawson ever got the chance to privately compare notes, both would agree that Eric Anderson would be off limits until he became a were of his own free will; not knowing that their daughter Spencer had other thoughts on that subject.<br />
Along with Eric&#39;s girlfriend Julie Stovall.<br />
<br />
UPSTAIRS...<br />
Julie had walked home with Eric so they could both start their history projects. Although neither actually had a class together this semester, both had the same history teacher, and decided they could at least compare notes and strategies on how to approach the assignment.<br />
But what Eric didn&#39;t know was that as the afternoon progressed, Julie started edging the extra chair that had to be brought into Eric&#39;s bedroom closer to him.<br />
Soon their shoulders were touching, as Julie&#39;s perfume (actually, HER pheromones!) began teasing Eric&#39;s nostrils.<br />
When Julie &quot;accidentally&quot; dropped her pen, Eric offered her another one from the wooden cup on his desk, but Julie refused, saying it would just take her a moment to retrieve it.<br />
Yet the fact that his girlfriend was now squatting between his legs and opening the zipper of his pants was not lost on Eric.</p>
