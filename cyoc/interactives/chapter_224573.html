<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Sir, we receive signals that two new metahumans have appeared, they&#39;re a few miles from here.&quot; A man sitting in front of a big screen said. The room was dark but several other screens could be seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent. Send the delta team to capture them.&quot; A manly rough voice replied. It seemed it belongs to middle age man who use to smoke a lot. The words sound firm and direct, which reflect a cold personality.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back at Ryan and Jeremy&#39;s house, they had spent the next few days trying their powers in different ways. Touching some random people at the malls, animals at the local zoo and even their classmates at school.<br />
<br />
They&#39;re having a lot of fun with their new abilities and the entertaining situation they can create with them. They had a family friendly behavior all the time, so they avoid to do anything sexual or unappropriated with the bodies they borrowed.<br />
<br />
In a Sunday morning, while Ryan was still sleeping, Jeremy woke up and went to the toilet to piss. He was still half asleep, so he almost acted by instinct. He walked barefoot through his room, crossed the hallway and closed the bathroom door after going in.<br />
<br />
When he was in front of the toilet he did what he always did and then he noticed... He doesn&#39;t have a dick! He immediately screamed in panic but suddenly stopped after realizing what was going on.<br />
<br />
He looked at his reflection in the mirror and saw his mother looking back at him. He was his mother right now, he was so tired last night that he fell asleep as his mother, and now he was in the bathroom as his mother wearing a plain rock band t-shirt and boxers.<br />
<br />
He still needed to pee but he refused to do it while he was still in his mother&#39;s body. He doesn&#39;t want to pee like a woman, even less like the one who gave birth to him. He knew he has to act quickly as long as he can contain himself.<br />
<br />
He quickly left the bathroom and notice that his father was on the other way. &quot;Honey, good morning. I thought you went to the grocery store. Why are you wearing those clothes? Doesn&#39;t they belong to the boys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeremy who had to think fast to don&#39;t get any suspicion, pretended he was his mother. &quot;Oh, darling. I forgot to take a bag. And, about my clothes... ehm... I mistakenly put them on thinking they&#39;re mine. Oh, darling, I don&#39;t know why, but I felt very dizzy this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you should go to see a doctor later. Anyway, I got a call from my brother. He and his family came for a few days. Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;d be at a hotel, but I&#39;m going for them at the airport. I was going to ask the boys if one of them wants to go with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds fine. Let me wake up the boys and ask them who wants to go with you.&quot; Jeremy said as he tried to open the door to his own bedroom where just Ryan was sleeping there. Unfortunately, his father seems he has the same idea and they ended up touching their hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I felt a little shock in the hand.&quot; Jeremy&#39;s dad said. &quot;Maybe they&#39;re the sparks of love. Do you want to do it? We have a few minutes.&quot; Jeremy clearly understood his father&#39;s suggestions and he felt completely disgusted at the mere idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no.&quot; Jeremy stuttered, he can feel he was changing again. His feminine voice getting deeper as it turns into his father&#39;s. &quot;There&#39;s traffic, you should leave immediately or you won&#39;t get on time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess, you&#39;re right.&quot; Jeremy&#39;s dad said while he went downstairs. &quot;I think I&#39;ll go alone. If my brother is bringing his stepson we won&#39;t fit in the car.&quot; He left at the precise moment before Jeremy&#39;s transformation finished. He was a exact copy of his dad now.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was very close.&quot; Jeremy said in his father&#39;s deep bass voice. He felt his clothes were now too small for him and he wanted to change back to himself as soon as possible, but before he could make a step he felt he can&#39;t hold it anymore.<br />
<br />
A few drops of pee were coming out and he needed to run to the bathroom. He doesn&#39;t want to pee while he has his father&#39;s body, but at least it was better than doing it as his mother. He closed the bathroom door and stood in front of the toilet for a second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here goes nothing.&quot; He told himself while he put his hand inside his now tight boxer and held his dick. It felt big, hairy and veiny... totally foreign to his own. He was mildly disgusted and ashamed, this wasn&#39;t right he told himself several times while he kept his eyes closed.<br />
<br />
The noisy stream of yellow fluid started to hit the porcelain while Jeremy tried to don&#39;t think about his current situation. He was so focused on that, that he didn&#39;t notice that someone was hitting on the door.<br />
<br />
He barely noticed it when the door was abruptly open up and several men dressed in military clothes from head to toe came in and surrounded him. He was completely shocked that he didn&#39;t notice he was still peeing and he&#39;s making a mess around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Target number two founded. Take him to the base.&quot; One of the military men said a second before another one took out a dart gun and shoot it at Jeremy&#39;s exposed thigh. Jeremy immediately got unconscious and fell to the ground with no idea of what was going on.</p>
