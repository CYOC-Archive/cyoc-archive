<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While their daughter Karen was adjusting to her new life as a weretigress, her parents had enjoyed a late dinner back in Tara Strange&#39;s cabin, never noticing that <i>somebody*</i> had eaten some of the defrosting hamburger meat raw.<br />
They had caught a brief glimpse of THREE weretigers walking away from the cabin later that evening and assumed one of them was their daughter, but had not gotten to fully see the new Karen.*2<br />
Now, back in the master bedroom as Karen was out exploring her fursona, her parents were doing more investigating of their own.<br />
&quot;Other than the fact that weretigers can be highly overprotective of their family and what they consider their <i>territory</i>, I don&#39;t see anything amiss with that possibility, should we decide to become weres too,&quot; announced Nichole Charleston from the bathroom as she was getting ready for bed.<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s something to consider,&quot; agreed her husband Moe from outside the door, who had already brushed his teeth for the night.<br />
&quot;How do you think Karen is doing?&quot; Nichole asked, staring at herself in the bathroom mirror over the basin.<br />
While still beautiful by anyone&#39;s standards, she could see the wear and tear, let alone the stress of recent months running and hiding from the Gambonis, in the new—but still minute—lines around her eyes.<br />
<i>This guide book says weres can live up to 4 centuries, barring anything unforeseen like a major illness, and still retain their improved looks for most of their existence,</i> thought Nichole, referring to the red covered book she had sitting on the counter near her. <i>I&#39;ve never considered myself vain, but to be young and beautiful for so long...</i> as she turned this way and that to stare at her reflection.<br />
<i>I&#39;ve seen the pictures of female weres in this book. They&#39;re all beautiful, in a primal, animalistic way. Which I guess is natural, under the circumstances. But how do they look when they&#39;re not furry? Are they like everyone else I&#39;ve seen around Moon Lake, better now than they were before? Even if Moe and I can agree on which were to be, do we dare?</i><br />
Once she finished in the bathroom, with no answers to her internal questions, Nichole Charleston walked out into the master bedroom and was totally surprised to see her husband as naked as the day he was born, staring at himself in Tara Strange&#39;s full length mirror.<br />
&quot;Not that I ain&#39;t happy to see you,&quot; said Nichole, as she felt her nipples harden under her nightgown, &quot;but what are you doing?&quot; she asked, while sitting the guide book down on the nightstand near her side of the bed.<br />
&quot;Thinking,&quot; replied Moe, turning to face her.<br />
&quot;About?&quot; wondered his wife, while turning down the covers.<br />
&quot;You know. How&#39;s Karen now? Do we become weres too? Which were if we do? What happens after we change? All those questions,&quot; Moe answered, while approaching her naked.<br />
&quot;And the answers were in the mirror?&quot; asked Nichole.<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Moe, wrapping his arms around her. &quot;But it did get me to thinking about how much I love you, and how endowed all those male weres seem to be in those guide book photos, let alone how greater the were sex drive is,&quot; as he kissed her while pulling Nichole against his body.<br />
&quot;Got you excited, didn&#39;t it?&quot; realized Nichole, feeling her husband&#39;s hardening penis press against her thigh.<br />
&quot;Guilty as charged, my love,&quot; pleaded Moe, even as he gently removed the nightgown off her shoulders and started kissing Nichole&#39;s now exposed bare skin.<br />
&quot;I thought we were going to stay up and wait for Karen,&quot; said Nichole, even as she felt her body ache for more attention.<br />
&quot;True,&quot; confirmed Moe. &quot;We left a note downstairs asking Karen to come see us when she got back, but nobody said what we&#39;d be doing until she returned,&quot; he pointed out, even as he was removing the nightgown from his wife&#39;s body.<br />
&quot;When did you become so insatiable?&quot; asked Nichole, not that she was actually complaining, considering the growing moisture between her legs.<br />
&quot;The exact moment? I don&#39;t rightly know,&quot; admitted Moe. &quot;But we both agree that there&#39;s just something about this town, with or without weres, that makes you feel more... energetic and interested in spending more time together.&quot;<br />
&quot;And just how would you like to spend the time waiting for Karen, Mister Charleston?&quot; asked Nichole with a smile on her face, even as she reached between them and started stroking the hard male organ Moe was proudly sporting.<br />
&quot;Guess,&quot; was Moe&#39;s only answer, before he spun them around, pushing his wife onto the bed back first.<br />
Nichole was pleasantly surprised when Moe stood beside the bed, lifted her legs to rest her feet upon his shoulders, and plunged his cock deep into her moist woman&#39;s nest.<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; screamed Nichole, already feeling her body shudder in pleasure.<br />
But one has to stop and wonder how she would react if Nichole knew that even as he was fucking his wife, Moe was mentally picturing the two of them as various furry weres rutting the night away...<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; said the officer to Vito Gamboni in the Seattle field office of the FBI, &quot;you and Marcus get one phone call each. Use them wisely.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll make mine now. Save yours for later,&quot; Vito advised Marcus, who simply nodded in agreement.<br />
He had not said a word since their arrest in Moon Lake.<br />
All the law enforcement officials thought he was just seriously exercising his right to remain silent, but Marcus was actually mad as hell that their plan to finally acquire &quot;his&quot; Karen Charleston had failed, and what he would do to correct the situation when the opportunity presented itself.<br />
Vito looked around the room carefully as he dialed a New York based number from memory. He had no doubt that somehow the authorities would be monitoring who was called and what was said on both ends, which is why a moment like this had been well prepared for in advance.<br />
The phone rang, and rang, and then finally was answered by a machine.<br />
&quot;You have reached the law offices of Vincent Lombardo,&quot; said an automated, female style voice. &quot;Unfortunately we are closed for the evening. Please leave a brief message as to the nature of your situation and Attorney Lombardo will return your call as soon as humanly possible.&quot;<br />
Then, after the beep, Vito said, &quot;This is Vito Gamboni. Marcus Gamboni and I have been arrested by Federal authorities and are currently in custody in Seattle, Washington State on multiple charges. We would appreciate legal assistance as soon as possible. Thank you.&quot;<br />
Then he hung up and asked, &quot;Since it was just a recording, do I get a makeup call?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to get back to you on that one,&quot; said the officer, before escorting the Gambonis to their respective cells.<br />
<br />
But that call had done more than any Federal official was aware of, for less than a half hour later, a trusted aide was addressing the head of the Gamboni Crime Family in person.<br />
&quot;Vito called the screening service we set up. He and Marcus have been arrested by the Feds in Washington. What are your orders sir?&quot;<br />
The boss of the entire operation, as well as the father of the Gambonis in question, thought about that long and hard before answering.<br />
&quot;Every courtesy is to be extended to Vito. Make sure he is comfortable, and if at all possible, have him out on bail as soon as it can be safely arranged. Whether we can do so by legal or... other means, as soon as he is free, Vito deserves some well earned rest and relaxation someplace without any extradition arrangements.&quot;<br />
&quot;And what about Marcus, sir?&quot; the aide asked.<br />
&quot;Have someone keep a discrete eye on him. I seriously doubt he&#39;d intentionally break Omerta*3, but it&#39;s Marcus&#39; stupidity that got everyone into this mess, so it&#39;s about time he learned a lesson or two before I get him out of it,&quot; the boss replied.<br />
&quot;Very good, sir. But what about those behind this... mess that Marcus entangled us with?&quot; the aide asked.<br />
The head of the Gamboni Organization didn&#39;t hesitate to answer that question.<br />
&quot;It was a fool&#39;s errand that caused all of this, which is appropriate considering my son is a fool. As far as I&#39;m concerned, no one is to do or say anything in relation to the Charlestons ever again without my personal approval. ESPECIALLY that girl Karen Marcus is so crazy about that caused all of this,&quot; fumed the boss, before ordering everyone out of his private office so he could be alone.<br />
