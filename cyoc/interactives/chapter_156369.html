<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff woke up the next morning with a deep groan. He felt awful! He was hungover and had a headache. He wasn&#39;t used to drinking like this! As Jeff opened his eyes, be noticed a throbbing sensation in his groin. He looked down his hairy torso and saw that he had some pretty stiff morning wood, and it was tenting his boxers. His boxers were tented very far out, and some of his thick tangle of pubes stuck out from the top. That was another part of Jeff that had grew, he thought with a smirk. Within a month, he had gained about 4 inches in length. His cock now was about 8 inches long and quite nice and thick, too. Likewise his balls had grown fat and hairy as well. He was proud of his new adult equipment. <br />
<br />
<br />
The problem was, looking down at his ridiculous tent, his dick was as hard as a steel pipe and he felt incredibly horny. Since he had started growing and aging, he had started becoming really horny all the time! He figured, it was just from all the hormones or testosterone in his body now. He thought about sex all the time! Even now, he could feel a heavy load in his balls, begging to come out.<br />
<br />
<br />
It took quite some effort, but he finally willed his erection down. He looked around the room and saw that it was a total mess. He would have to help clean up. Getting up, he pulled on his pants and put on his white wife beater, from his Wolverine costume. The white wife beater showcased the thick patch of hair on his chest, and it exposed his very hairy armpits as well. He was even getting sprouts on his shoulders and biceps. There was no way he could keep this up and pretend he was still high school aged! However, looking at his hairy veiny foraearms, his thick biceps, and tufts of chest hair, he did look quite a bit like the superhero. <br />
<br />
<br />
Fuck, his head was pounding. Why did he drink so much last night? He wandered out of his room into the kitchen in search of a glass of water. Having quenched his thirst with a couple glugs from the sink, he walked up the stairs in search of his friend Bryan.<br />
<br />
<br />
He found his friend sleeping soundly on his bed. &quot;Hey, Bryan, wake up&quot;, Jeff said as he tapped his friends shoulder. Bryan groaned and slowly opened his eyes. &quot;Jeff? Is that you? Fuck my head is pounding...&quot;, Bryan lazily said as he opened his eyes. &quot;Yeah, Bry, mine too. Uggh why did we get so drunk last night. Oh well, wake up you lug, we have to clean your house, it&#39;s a mess&quot;, Jeff said. Jeff sat down on the side of the bed while his friend slowly woke up. <br />
<br />
<br />
Bryan way up and looked at his friend. &quot;Still wearing that costume, eh wolverine?&quot;, Bryan said with a smirk. Jeff chuckled; &quot;well, I don&#39;t have much else to wear!&quot;. &quot;It&#39;s okay, I like it. You actually look a lot like him, dude. All your body hair and muscles&quot;. Bryan trailed off. Jeff could see he was very obvious staring at the thick thatch of chest hair sprouting up from the top of his wife beater. &quot;Man, Jeff, how did you grow up so fast! Like a couple months ago you were just like me! Puberty hit you like a truck, I guess!&quot;. Jeff blushed, a bit embarrassed to be talking about his body hair and stuff. &quot;Yeah, I guess I did. Big growth spurt I guess&quot;. Bryan looked at him skeptically.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jeff decided to change the subject; &quot;alright dude, let&#39;s get going and clean your apartment. I want to go home in a bit&quot;. Bryan hopped out of bed next to Jeff and scrunched up his nose. &quot;Sounds good to me man, because, sorry to tell you this Jeff, but you stink! The sooner we finish, the sooner you can shower!&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Jeff lifted up his arm, showing off his huge brown pit bush and sniffed. Oh man, Bryan was right, he did kind of stink! &quot;Yeeesh, your right dude, sorry. Well I guess Wolverine wouldn&#39;t smell like roses in real life!&quot;, Jeff said with a chuckle. Bryan laughed and playfully punched Jeff in his beefy arm.<br />
<br />
<br />
The two boys spent the next hour cleaning up empty cups and cans, wiping up spilled drinks, and making sure everything was clean for when Bryan&#39;s mom and dad came home. When all the work was done, Jeff went up stairs and grabbed his bag. &quot;Alright man, I&#39;m out! Thanks for hosting the party! See you at school tomorrow!&quot;, Jeff said as he walked out of the house and went home. <br />
<br />
<br />
As soon as Jeff had left, Bryan stood in the doorway thinking about his friend. Something was up. His friend, who looked like a prepubescent boy a few months ago, now looked like a 20+ year old man! Beefy, covered in body hair and muscles! There was no way it was just puberty, something fishy was up. Plus, Bryan had seen the massive bulge in Jeff&#39;s jeans (how could he have not!). There was definitely something very strange happening, and Bryan was going to get to the bottom of it!</p>
