<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Things were a little busier at Mieni Atoll than Nate and Shuixing expected when they arrived for their honeymoon. Of course, that was mostly because of the TEC going on. There were plenty of water sports going on here as well as the bodybuilding competition. But the two water buffalo were assured they&#39;d be able to get some alone time, particularly at Lover&#39;s Lagoon.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do you think of our honeymoon suite?&quot; asked Shuixing as she walked into the room she and her new husband would be staying in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m wondering where exactly in our marriage vows I became your personal beast of burden,&quot; said Nate as he carried the luggage in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please, that&#39;s only a feather&#39;s weight to you,&quot; said Shuixing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yes, I just imagined doing a more romantic entrance into our honeymoon suite,&quot; said Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean carrying me in, bridal style?&quot; asked Shuixing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;But then I&#39;d whack my head against the doorframe,&quot; said Shuixing.<br />
<br />
Nate glanced back at the door. This hotel may have been designed for Animlians, but the door probably couldn&#39;t easily accommodate the both of them going through at the same time. &quot;I see your point,&quot; said Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you can carry me to Lover&#39;s Lagoon,&quot; said Shuixing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bit of a long way to carry you, isn&#39;t it?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
<br />
Shuixing rolled her eyes and said, &quot;Your jokes need work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better get used to them,&quot; said Nate, putting down their bags, &quot;I&#39;m your husband now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you certainly are,&quot; said Shuixing before wrapping her arms around Nate and giving him a big kiss. Nate soon responded in kind. Before long, Shuixing felt something poking at her waist. She pulled back and asked in a sultry tone, &quot;So, what do you think about us having a little dress rehearsal before going to Lover&#39;s Lagoon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean an undress rehearsal?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
<br />
Shuixing groaned at that. &quot;Ok, that was almost bad enough to kill the mood,&quot; she said flatly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; said Nate, &quot;I get it from my dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shuixing pushed Nate onto the bed. Fortunately, the bed was reinforced for larger Animalians, otherwise it would have broke underneath him. Shuixing climbed onto the bed before she stared unfastening his pants. &quot;How about we save the talking for later?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say,&quot; said Nate, working at her shorts.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
After some initial lovemaking, Nate and Shuixing decided to walk around the island a little. Just because they were on their honeymoon didn&#39;t mean they&#39;d have to spend all their time in the bedroom. Besides, the beaches were just too beautiful to ignore, even if they were a little crowded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure about this shirt?&quot; asked Nate, who was wearing a Hawaiian shirt along with swim trunks, &quot;It makes me look like a tourist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate, you <i>are</i> a tourist,&quot; said Shuixing, who was wearing a bikini that matched Nate&#39;s shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least I&#39;m not snapping pictures of everything,&quot; said Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are taking pictures of our honeymoon, right?&quot; asked Shuixing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only the important parts,&quot; said Nate.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the two of them came to Muscle Beach, where the bodybuilding competition was being held. Shuixing had to admit the males in the competition were pretty big and muscular. Like many new wives, she thought that her husband would win the contest if he were in it. Though in Shuixing&#39;s case, she was actually a bit justified here. After all, Nate did become a water buffalo, which is certainly larger than most domesticated cattle. His farmer lifestyle had kept him in pretty good shape even before his conversion. And his training for the Year of the Ox competition did make him bulk up even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nate, did you ever want to compete like this?&quot; asked Shuixing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, I&#39;m not feeling that compelled,&quot; said Nate, &quot;I don&#39;t have anything against bodybuilders, but I just don&#39;t really care about these kind of competitions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...what if it were the female division?&quot; asked Shuixing.<br />
<br />
Nate opened his mouth before pausing. He was married now and there were certain things that can be said to a girlfriend that couldn&#39;t be said to a wife. &quot;Perhaps if you were in it,&quot; said Nate, cautiously, &quot;But then, I think you might have too unfair an advantage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Smartly said,&quot; said Shuixing with approval.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
It turns out that the honeymoon suite actually comes with more than just a reservation at Lover&#39;s Lagoon. There was also a hot tub that was reserved for the newlyweds. It seemed a bit of an odd choice considering there was already the lagoon and the ocean to swim in. On the other hand, it was nice to relax in something that wasn&#39;t saltwater, especially when it&#39;s kept warm and there were water jets to massage your skin. Also, not everyone is a particularly strong swimmer, so some couples would prefer to swim in a place where it wouldn&#39;t be too deep for them.<br />
<br />
Nate and Shuixing actually found it a wonderful spot to relax after a day of walking on the beach. And there was a wall around the hot tub to ensure the couple&#39;s privacy. &quot;This is nice,&quot; said Shuixing, &quot;Though I like the Jacuzzi back home more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, we haven&#39;t spent much time in either the Jacuzzi or pool yet,&quot; said Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, we can definitely fix that when we go back home,&quot; said Shuixing, &quot;Which makes me think of something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; asked Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I know we&#39;ve been doing all kinds of sex since your conversion,&quot; said Shuixing as she untied her top, &quot;But we haven&#39;t had water sex yet.&quot; She tossed her top aside, allowing her large breasts to bounce out.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you representing Water among the Five Elements,&quot; said Nate, his trunks getting a little tighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;At least it&#39;s easier to have sex in my element,&quot; said Shuixing, &quot;I don&#39;t know how fire or metal sex would work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate thought for a moment before suggesting, &quot;Candlelit and in the back seat of a car?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, maybe,&quot; said Shuixing as she untied her bottoms, &quot;But I think we ought to practice a little here so we&#39;ll know what to do without drowning at Lover&#39;s Lagoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I think that&#39;s quite reasonable,&quot; said Nate as he untied his trunks.<br />
<br />
Shuixing tossed her bottoms aside and moved over to her husband naked. She pulled down his trunks, allowing his bullhood out. Nate moaned as he felt the water jets stimulate his sensitive flesh before his wife wrapped her hands around it. The head of his cock soon breached the surface of the water and she gave it a long lick. Nate was very well-endowed, befitting a bull. He wasn&#39;t sitting in a deep part of the hot tub so it wasn&#39;t hard for his cock to go above the water.<br />
<br />
Once Shuixing was sure it was at full mast, she raised herself out of the water, allowing it to drip off her ass. She positioned herself on top of Nate before sinking down. The two moaned as they began thrusting. The water gave them a weightlessness which made it less of an effort to move. The hot tub&#39;s jets was also very stimulating for them. Admittedly, as they got more passionate, quite a bit of water splashed out of the tub. Perhaps a little quicker than either of them was expecting, they hit their climax.<br />
<br />
As soon as they caught their breath, Nate asked, &quot;Well? What did you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We might want to slow it down a bit,&quot; said Shuixing, &quot;We ought to savor it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...I can think of one way,&quot; said Nate. He cupped one of Shuixing&#39;s breasts before he sucked on her nipple. Shuixing let out a happy moo at that. Part of her hoped she would get pregnant soon so that Nate would have many calves. But she was content to wait for now. And she couldn&#39;t wait until they did this again in Lover&#39;s Lagoon.</p>
