<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy stood naked in the bathroom in front of the mirror admiring his amazingly sculped body. The jockstrap staining to contain his massive cock. He reached down to rub is sensitive 13 inch member on the outside of the strap. &quot;So this is what it&#39;s like to have a body like Jesse&#39;s&quot; as he flexed his left bicep.  Standing at 6&#39;4&quot; and 220lbs. with size 13 feet Andy was making himself horny just by think of how big he had become, how much bigger he was going to become. With one hand he ripped off the jockstrap and began pumping his massive cock. Imagining himself outgrowing his brother and towering over him. Dominating over him. Andy moaned has he was about to climax. Tilting his head back he came over the mirror. Stream after stream, Andy was in euphoric bliss. As he finished sputtering Andy decided to take a shower.<br />
<br />
He started thinking of ways to get Jesse to insult him again. He wanted to get bigger, he needed to get bigger than Jesse. All of the plotting made Andy honey again that we quickly rubbed one out while in the shower. It was just as potent as the last one. With all this new testosterone pumping though his body the turn around was much quicker than it had ever been for him.<br />
<br />
As he got out the shower and toweled off. He went right into Jesse&#39;s room to grab some more clothes. He picked out a pair of white Calvin Cline briefs. He put on some black tight jeans with rips in the knees, a tight white t-shirt and a pair of Jesse&#39;s favorite convers sneakers and a studded belt to tie it all together. The shoes fit him perfectly while the clothes were a little snug it accentuated his body. He looked like a hot punk skater. Andy loved the way he looked with his bulging muscles. He couldn&#39;t wait to see how Jesse would react to him wearing his clothes.<br />
<br />
He ran down stairs to see Jesse making something in the kitchen. He swaggered in gabbing Jesse&#39;s attention. Jesse stared in aw as Andy came in. Andy said &quot;Watcha makin?&quot;. Jesse timidly said none of your business. Andy just smiled and said &quot;It smells good.&quot; Jesse had prepared a protein heavy chicken dinner. As Jesse was finishing the plating Andy walked right up to him smiled and gently garbed the plate of food from Jesse&#39;s hand and said Thanks and walked right to the table and started eating his dinner. Jesse just stood there puzzled. He didn&#39;t know wat to do. He know if he lashed out at him, he would grow bigger than him. Jesse just kept his cool and said you&#39;re welcome. Andy was surprised that Jesse didn&#39;t yell at him. He thought to himself &quot;This might be a challenge, I think Jesse is wising up.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Andy finished his dinner he got up to put his dish in the sink. Andy turns around and says &quot;Like my new fit? It looks so much better on me than it did you&quot;. Jesse just glared at Andy. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll go over to Karen and see what she thinks of my new clothes and bod&quot; Andy starts walking out when Jesse stands up and says &quot;You better Not&quot;. Stopping in the doorway Andy turns around and says &quot;Or what?&quot; Jesse replies &quot;Or I&#39;ll kick your ass&quot;. &quot;Oh is that a threat?&quot; Andy says sarcastically. Jesse&#39;s face starts to turn red. Andy is anticipating was is about to happen next.<br />
<br />
With a grin on his face Andy says &quot;Karen is gonna need a real man to take care of her and I not looking at one right now. But don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll take real good care of her for you. Jesse finally explodes. She would never get with a freakish twerp like you! You&#39;re an annoying little shit who is always ruining everything in my life. You are the bane of my existence, you have brought nothing but misery to my life since the day you were born. It&#39;s you fault mom and dad got divorced and there isn&#39;t a day that goes by that I don&#39;t wish that you were born. No Fuck off and stay away from Karen.<br />
<br />
As Jesse finished his rant Andy could feel the immense power starting to flow through his body. His skeletal structure started to transform. With a few cracking sounds his spine began to elongate, the top of his head inching closer to the top of the 7ft door frame. His arms and legs soon followed lengthening, pushing his height even further growing to a massive 6&#39;9&quot;. The hem of this pants rose above his ankles. Andy&#39;s feet were filling the confines of Jesse&#39;s favorite shoes. As the shoes started stretching and molding to Andy&#39;s enlarging feet, popping sounds could be heard as his enormous feet burst through each shoe. Big manly toes crept their way out of the tips of the shoes growing to a manly size 18. Jesse stood and watched in fear, looking back up at Andy&#39;s torso he saw his shirt shrinking on Andy&#39;s growing body. The bottom of the tight shirt slid up Andy&#39;s defined abs revealing an additional two giving Andy a ripped 8 pack. Andy&#39;s shoulder width widened even more almost touching both sides of the door frame. Andy&#39;s growing frame was starting to test the limits of the shirt. Rips and tears were starting to be heard as Andy&#39;s body began to pulsate larger. With each pulse a new tear, his muscles plumped larger and larger. Andy started laughing maniacally looking at his hands pulse larger. &quot;I could palm a basketball with these mitts&quot; He lifted his right arm and flexed his bicep. The peak ripped the sleeve as it grew to a whopping 18&quot;. Jesse&#39;s pants were practically painted on Andy&#39;s thighs and calves. More tears could be heard, as Jesse&#39;s belt snapped off of Andy&#39;s widening waist. His shirt finally gave way as it ripped down the middle revealing two meaty pecks cover in a thick layer of hair. It traveled down his torso covering his abs, but even with all the hair you could clearly see Andy&#39;s deep cut well defined abs. Andy&#39;s beard grew thicker but in a way that made it look well groomed and trimmed. His facial features were becoming more defined and masculine. His jaw cracked and widened giving him a chiseled jaw line that any Hollywood actor would kill for. His lips plumped up giving him the most kissable lips Jesse had even see. His eyes even changed color from a dark hazel to a deep ocean blue. Andy had truly transformed into a man, and a gorges one at that. As the pulsating came to an end Andy stood there with shredded clothes exposing nearly his whole godly body. By some miracle the Calvin Kline under ware held up. Though just barely. And as both Jesse and Andy thought it was over, one last surge of growth lurched from his already enormous cock. Popping threads were sounding off as his cock inched longer and thicker.  Andy moaned as this cock became more erect with each passing second. Snap! It all came flopping out. All 15 inches of it aimed right at Jesse. Jesse know in his mind what was about to happen next. But it was too late for him to react. A wave of come splooged all over Jesse. Andy was in a state of euphoria, he didn&#39;t realize what was happening in that moment.</p>
