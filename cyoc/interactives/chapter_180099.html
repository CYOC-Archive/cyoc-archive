<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Sure thing, man. I&#39;m down for an afterparty.&quot; Danny was sure now that he thought about it that he could control himself. He was a straight man when it got down to it. And besides, maybe he could observe some more changes going on with Jackson, Terry, Gabe and maybe some others. Even as Danny watched he could tell Jackson&#39;s angst over the fact he was only just a little behind Danny in abdominal development was resulting in Jackson&#39;s abs tightening even as he watched.<br />
<br />
It was somewhat fascinating watching it. Like seeing someone&#39;s workouts coming in and showing results in real time. Jackson grunted suddenly and scratched at his core, barely noticing anything was amiss. Before long, Jackson grinned and walked off. Deciding to try and show off for the ladies here. Danny started to wonder how long it&#39;d be for Jackson to still be interested in the affections of the fairer sex.<br />
<br />
With Jackson walking off, Gabe started to follow him.<br />
<br />
Jackson noticed before long the fact he had an admirer in Gabe, and questioned him, &quot;Dude, are you like, into me or something? Because you seem to be following me around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Gabe shook his head, &quot;I&#39;m not exactly into you. I mean, I&#39;m straight...&quot; *right?* &quot;...But at the same time I can&#39;t help but admire like, how built and strong you are. You&#39;re buff as fuck, man. And I kinda want to uhh, see more of that. And like, get inspiration for the gym.&quot; Said as if Gabe would put on any more muscle than he had now. Jackson for his part seemed to accept the answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if you are into me,&quot; Jackson started with a smirk, &quot;I can&#39;t really blame you.&quot; He flexed his biceps and sucked in his stomach, flexing hard, &quot;Look at all of this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Gabe said intently, &quot;I&#39;m looking, I&#39;m looking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackson looked left and right, and seemed to contemplate before leaning in to whisper, &quot;Like I said, I&#39;m straight...but if you uh, want to like, fool around or something, I&#39;m down to experiment.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gabe&#39;s eyes widened at that, and he gulped, &quot;J-Just...two straight guys...experimenting and seeing what feels good...right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it.&quot; Jackson said in the same whisper as before. Gabe couldn&#39;t help but feel it was heady and induced a certain feeling in him.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Jin, I wanna talk with you about something.&quot; Jin was somewhat surprised to see a quite different looking Terry, tight, toned and somewhat oddly pretty in his face and body, leading him now away from the more packed parts of the party. Terry seemed different in mannerisms as well as in body. It also seemed he had very little hair on his body. It lent him a certain odd look that Jin had on the tip of his tongue but couldn&#39;t quite name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? What&#39;s up, Terry?&quot; Jin was still not used to the fact that Terry was behaving this friendly. And...oh. Terry was moving from leading him away to touching his bicep. That felt odd. Jin tilted his head, &quot;...Are you alright, Terry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh yeah, I&#39;m fine. Never been better. Look at how tight, toned and good looking I am!&quot; Terry flexed, showing more his tone than any kind of size. Now they were far enough away from the other partygoers it seemed Terry was liberated somewhat from some sort of worry. As if he was contemplating being seen doing something.<br />
<br />
&quot;So,&quot; Terry stopped his showboating and looked Jin over, &quot;You&#39;re familiar with the concept of catharsis, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Jin started, &quot;The idea that doing something related to strong or repressed emotions or urges will allow a reprieve.&quot; Jin didn&#39;t mention that the idea had been on the out and out in the psychological context.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ve been having these thoughts lately. Pretty intrusive thoughts. And I was hoping you might be up to help me out here.&quot; Terry said as he moved in closer to Jin, leading them to sit down on a nearby bench.<br />
<br />
&quot;What sorts of thoughts would these be?&quot; Jin was getting flush. This was far more intimate than he had anticipated it might be. He gulped. Something about this was making him tingle a bit. Jin could almost feel a sense of attraction. Deep down he had always been at least a little bi-curious, never enough to seek out some sort of encounter, but aware enough of it. He had never before felt bold enough to move forward with these desires. Now however, as muscular as he was, and with Terry behaving this way, it was bringing up things Jin had never really acted on...<br />
<br />
&quot;Gay thoughts. Like, you know, hot dude like me, you could understand why gay guys would go for me.&quot; Terry grinned and gestured at himself, &quot;But I&#39;m like, straight, you know. So having these gay thoughts...I gotta work em out. Deal with them before they build up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you...I am guessing you want to work out these thoughts with me.&quot; Jin licked his lips, finding them parched. He gulped. How had this become a thing?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man, you&#39;re hot, I&#39;m hot...let&#39;s just...be hot together for a hot minute.&quot; Terry leaned in and started kissing Jin on the lips, the growing Asian stud realizing what was going on and moaning. He leaned into it even as it happened. They were secluded enough out here. They could have some time to themselves. He had never done anything like this before. Never even viewed any porn. So Jin was not exactly in the know.<br />
<br />
Terry&#39;s slim hand reached up Jin&#39;s body, feeling his tight abs and toned pectorals. Terry started moving over on top of Jin, sitting in his lap. He kept on kissing him, tweaking his nipples, and cupping his groin - all the way until Jin was moaning with arousal and pumping his hips against Terry&#39;s oddly skilled hand.<br />
<br />
Terry was somewhat weirded out by how good this felt. He was supposed to be doing this just to get this out of his system. But it felt soooo good. &quot;Don&#39;t be cumming too soon, Jin. Let&#39;s...let&#39;s try fucking. Shorts off and...and lemme lube my dick up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite being bigger than Terry, Jin was too aroused to really question it. He moaned, &quot;Just...lemme have a turn after then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, sure thing,&quot; Terry said with a cocky smirk, &quot;I fuck your ass first, you fuck mine after. Sounds good. We both get to work off our needs.&quot; Before long, Terry got Jin&#39;s shorts off and threw them to the side of the bench. He pulled down his own and started to rub his own pre-cum over his cock from head to base. He gasped at how fucking sensitive he was, and hoped that he wasn&#39;t gonna be a quick shot in the sack.<br />
<br />
Jin presented his rear for Terry, gripping the side of the bench and readying himself, relaxing. Fuck he&#39;d never done anything like this before...</p>
