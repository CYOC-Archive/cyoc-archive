<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After walking to the busstop, it was another 5 minutes of waiting to do for Helen. Next to her were a few other people, whose mind she could easily change with the still active command of the Chronivac. She left it aside though, besides, the bus had arrived.<br />
<br />
Stepping into the bus, the bus driver kept her waiting for a minute, looking at her card, noticing how it was completely blank, except for the logo of the company that funded public transport. The bus driver was curious, &quot;Excuse me, miss? Would you please explain why that card of yours hasn&#39;t got your data shown on it?&quot; Helen&#39;s eyes widened for a bit, as she stood still at the entrance on the bus. Then she tried something. &quot;I&#39;m sorry sir, but I believe you&#39;re mistaken. &#39;Look, my card has everything on it&#39;.&quot; Helen showed her card to the bus driver again, still amazed at how all of her new data had appeared on the card out of nowhere. The bus driver took a glance again, and Helen saw his face turn from unfaithful to surprised. &quot;It&#39;s just that I&#39;ve just gotten this card yesterday, if you wondered why someone new entered your bus.&quot; Helen continued. The bus driver looked somewhat ashamed. His mindset had changed because of the program, and now he thought that Helen was actually new on the bus, even with a card that said she already owned it for a few months. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, please take a seat.&quot; <br />
<br />
In the back a few guys grinned, talking about the bus driver&#39;s &#39;stupidity&#39;. Because they listened to Helen&#39;s conversation with the man, their mindset had apparently also changed. Helen recognized the three guys. They were her friends, sadly enough the three didn&#39;t recognize her back. Ah well, a little help from the program wouldn&#39;t hurt one bit. They were her friends after all, perhaps they would still act the same if she was a girl. All she had to do was approach them, thus she did just that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi guys!&quot; Helen began. One of the guys, Roger, looked up. First he was looking at her with a questioning glance, but after a second her message was processed in his brain, and all of a sudden he replied. &quot;Good morning Helen! How&#39;s it going?&quot; Roger asked her so casually it was almost as if he had known her in her body since their youth. She also immediately got called Helen by Roger, something the Chronivac apparently had also ensured. The other two boys, Dave and Alan, followed the two&#39;s conversation. &quot;I&#39;m alright, yesterday was quite a shock for me,&quot; Helen continued, wondering if Roger realized what she was talking about. &quot;it was a life-changer.&quot; Roger looked at her interrogatively, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Alan and Dave also looked at each other, shrugging. <br />
<br />
Helen started blushing. &quot;Never mind, forget it.&quot; &quot;Okay then,&quot; Dave answered, &quot;So what were we talking about?&quot;. Alan mixed himself in the conversation, &quot;What an idiot that bus driver was, right guys? How did he forget about Helen of a sudden?&quot; Roger and Dave laughed, as well as Helen herself. And so, their conversation continued.<br />
<br />
After fifteen more minutes driving, the bus arrived at Helen&#39;s stop: city center. The university was not very far away from here, but Helen was still very early. After all, it was still 2 hours before the first lecture started. Now she had the time to stroll around the center of town, to see if she could find any shops, perhaps for some better women&#39;s clothes. She could still just change herself back to a man again with the program, but she didn&#39;t think that kept her from being a woman, as it was a whole adventure like this.<br />
<br />
The streets were silent, as it was still quite dark, and almost everyone was still asleep. Sometimes Helen came across a bunch of other students, who were already heading to the university. Some people however, were going other ways. Helen was walking through the indoor shopping mall, coming across some public toilets, in a small corner. Remembering from earlier, barely anyone used it. Her &#39;bra&#39; was not fitting well, so she headed there to adjust it. She almost made the mistake to run into the men&#39;s bathroom.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, Helen didn&#39;t make that cliché mistake, and walked into one of the stalls with seated toilets in them, as only they were in a women&#39;s public bathroom. Taking off her polo shirt, Helen looked at her t-shirt, and adjusted it so it felt good again, in a proper way. Just for some more hygiene, she washed her hands, when two more girls of her age attempted to storm into the bathroom. With a lot of giggling, they looked at her, and seconds later they were gone again, but not entirely. &quot;Just wait until she&#39;s gone.&quot; One of the women said to the other, followed with a lot more of giggling. Helen grinned mischievously. The girl that came storming in that split-second looked very attractive at first sight for her still male mind. In that way she hadn&#39;t changed one bit. It was time to form a relationship.</p>
