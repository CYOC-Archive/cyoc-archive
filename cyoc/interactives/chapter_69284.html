<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;A real &quot;living doll&quot;, as it were.&quot; Cory thought. As soon as thought passed through Cory's mind, an option titled &quot;Doll&quot; appeared on his computer's screen.<br />
<br />
Cory stopped for a moment. He basically knew what it would be like to be a man or a woman. He was already halfway between the two. One would be just more of one thing than the other. Ever curious, Cory's mouse cursor hovered over the doll option. He doubted the machine's ability to change him into anything other than what he already was, but he decided to play along with the fantasy. What harm could there be in it?<br />
<br />
Cory closed his eyes and gave the doll option a tentative click, and was releived when nothing happened. When he opened his eyes, however, another screen had presented itself. It asked only one thing:<br />
<br />
TIME LIMIT _____<br />
<br />
Cory laughed nervously. How long would he want to be a doll, anyway? Convinced it was all phoney, he flippantly entered &quot;30 minutes&quot; and slapped the enter key.<br />
<br />
Immediately, a blue pulse emanated from the &quot;speaker hole&quot; on the front of the Chronivac. Cory felt his whole body tingle, fearing the consequences of his actions. Would he really be transformed into a human shaped, immobile piece of plastic?<br />
<br />
The light faded, but the tingle remained. Cory's vision blurred momentarily before resolving itself. Suddenly his legs began to itch. Wearing shorts, Cory was easily able to scratch his leg, but paused when he felt it's texture.<br />
<br />
Cory's skin had become super-smooth, smoother than it had ever been in the past. Scared and feeling lightheaded, Cory rushed to cancel the process, but the computer would no longer respond to his commands. It was locked entirely for the duration of his transformation. Turning it off would be too risky. Cory had no choice but to watch himself change.<br />
<br />
Cory bolted up from his chair and opened his closet for access to his full length mirror. The skin on his legs and arms lose all trace of what little hair had been there in the first place. Smooth and rapidly becoming shiny, Cory concluded that his skin was beginning to look rather plastic.<br />
<br />
The changes reached Cory's hands and his fingernails melted, leaving him with plastic rounded digits. His nerves, though dulled, were not gone completely. Cory knocked on his opposite arm with a fist, and heard a hollow knocking sound. His arm felt unnaturally hard. His elbows retained their joints, but they were now hinges. His stiffening shoulders each contained a doll's ball joint.<br />
<br />
Terrified, Cory watched his clothes begin to change. His T-shirt and shorts faded to blue and joined together to form a dress. His chest remained flat. As the dress's cut lowered and opened, he could see that it too had  become hard plastic. Struggling a bit, Cory was able to lift the front of the dress to see a blank plastic crotch. His rear end had also closed up and stiffened.<br />
<br />
Cory whimpered, &quot;I look like a Barbie doll!&quot; Cory's white socks grew to cover his plastic legs, becoming a pair of girl's white stockings. Cory rubbed his legs together a bit, feeling the odd sensation of being completely covered before his legs stiffened. Cory was forced into a sitting position; his legs sticking straight out in front of him to form an awkward V.<br />
<br />
The tights inched themselves over his now hinge-jointed knees and plasticine butt. Cory gazed at the bottoms of his stocking-clad feet in the mirror, and was able to wiggle his toes only a little before they also petrified. The bright, immaculate stockings were skin tight, and his heels and ankles were prominently visible.<br />
<br />
The pores on Cory's pale face sealed themselves shut. To his disappointment, his hair did not change length. Cory reached up to feel it. It had become a real struggle to move his arms. It felt too smooth and looked too shiny, like fake doll hair. He could see tiny holes in his scalp where his hair had become rooted.<br />
<br />
A seam then appeared on his neck, difficult to see. Struggling against his increasingly paralyzed condition, Cory turned his head to the left, and just kept turning it until it had gone 360 degrees. He watched his eyelids widen and he screamed as his eyes took on a glossy sheen. Cory could no longer blink. His eyelashes grew out a bit. His eyebrows became fixed. His scream died out as his vocal chords melted and his mouth sealed itself in a pert, feminine smile. Cory clenched his fists at this, but was forced to unfolding his fingers as they opened and locked into an open hand position.<br />
<br />
Cory gazed at his new form in the mirror. Although he looked like a girl, dressed in white tights and a pretty blue dress, his body had not changed much. He resembled a boy dressed up like a girl. Combined with a lack of reproductive organs, this did little to sort out his feelings of androgyny. He had been transformed completely into a living doll.<br />
<br />
Almost as a final insult, a blue bow appeared in his hair, and shiny black Maryjane shoes materialized to cover his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is going to be a long 30 minutes.&quot;</p>
