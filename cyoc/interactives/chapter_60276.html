<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lord Ponius sat at his desk in his huge office on the 4th floor of the Pleasure Island Administration Building. His office and quarters occupied the entire floor. He sat at his desk drafting orders to have the parents of one Kyle Perkins moved from the President’s Suite at the Boardwalk Hotel where they were currently being held to the basement of the Pleasure Island Clinic. It was more suited to the detention of humans than  the main holding cells. Besides, testing, modification, and specialized interrogation would be much easier to perform there.<br />
<br />
The corrupted humans being held in the main holding cell were destined for full beast transformations to ensure that they would not be able to cause problems later. They would be quickly sold and hopefully worked to death. In fact their final corruption was scheduled for tomorrow afternoon unless they came up with some incredible information that so far they didn’t appear to have.<br />
<br />
Three of the humans showed some possible promise as demons, their transformations being much further along, but some things were just not worth the risk. They would be made into beasts just like the others, their demonic potential forever destroyed.<br />
<br />
The torture team was currently on break as the humans were all unconscious. They had been working their tails off for many hours. The hinny demons were specially bred for and totally dedicated to this kind of work. Their mixed ancestry of mule and horse rendered them sterile, and gave them very bad attitudes. Unlike most lust demons, their lust was sated by pain, not sexual pleasure. Ponuis himself selected the sadistic human candidates allowed to join the team. They were the best on this world and he would proudly allow comparisons with any torture teams in the abyss.<br />
<br />
Then the lights went out.  A small explosion rocked the building followed by a startled cry of equine pain from the floor below. The emergency generators kicked on for 3 seconds and promptly failed. The lights were on long enough to show a thin plume of smoke curling up the stairs.<br />
<br />
“Emergency Stations! Condition Red!”, shouted Ponius to all staff in hearing distance. He charged down the specially designed steep and narrow stairs. While a human would have issues navigating these stairs, they were purposely designed for sure-footed equine hooves. <br />
<br />
Ponius burst into the smoke filled command center full of coughing demons. “Break those windows! Ventilate this smoke!”, Ponius barked. The sound of shattering glass was proof his orders were being followed. Ponius himself broke several nearby windows with the small hooves on his fingers. That was when he found Traveler.<br />
<br />
Traveler was slumped in front of the magical monitors. Somehow they had exploded, showering him with a mixture of molten glass, copper, sparks, and gods only knew what else. His mane was charred. His muzzle was burned, as were his arms and hands. The wounds were glowing indicating that there was possibly more than just physical injuries involved.<br />
<br />
“Sirrrr”, Traveler neighed.<br />
<br />
“Quiet Traveler, you have serious burns.” For the first time any of the witnesses could remember, Ponius was showing compassion for someone. “You! I don’t care if you have to gallop to the clinic, get the doctor here! Now!” The designated demon galloped off without a word.<br />
<br />
“Major spikes, all over Glendale.” Traveler coughed. “Something blasted us….Blew the monitors….Jail.” Traveler passed out as Ponius comprehended the situation, for a brief moment his eyes rolled in true equine fear.<br />
<br />
<br />
All the neon tubes in the main jail blew at once, including the ones in the main holding cell occupied by Kyle’s friends. A glowing apparition appeared in the center of the room and regarded the chained prisoners. It was the spirit of Greyon, the ultimate demonic bestial warrior. <br />
<br />
Greyon was centroid with a body that appeared across between a dragon and a horse. His body was covered in thick metallic scales. His hooves flashed copper. Silver horns and spikes grew from his head and back, all the way down his serpentine tail. His upper torso was striped like a tiger, but appeared built like a great bull. His hands were huge and paw-like tipped with vicious claws that exuded various types of venom. His head was that of a lion with a mane full of copper spikes. Greyon roared his presence showing huge hollow fangs dripping with deadly toxin.<br />
<br />
Greyon extended a magical force field that cut off the holding cell from the rest of the world. It was so powerful it shorted the island’s entire electric grid and blew out the vaunted Pleasure Island monitors. It also cut the room off from the flow of time outside, allowing events within to proceed in the blink of an eye.<br />
<br />
Greyon smiled, “Who among you claims kinship with me?”<br />
<br />
“We do”, Matt and Don answered immediately. “I do”, Paul answered a few seconds later after Matt screamed in his head.<br />
<br />
Greyon laughed, “Two cum encrusted lust demons and a very tainted human with a cord on his cock, all in chains surrounded by more cum encrusted humans. I’ve not seen anything this amusing in centuries. Tell me why I should honor your request to be my kin? You are nothing but debauched children of equine sex. Humans who would be stallions.”<br />
<br />
“Lord Greyon, I demand that you honor our summons and grant our demands. We want vengeance against our captors. This is not some bondage club, we are prisoners being tortured and held against our will. I invoke the sacred demon right of revenge as our justification.”<br />
<br />
Lord Greyon grinned, “I am impressed young one. Whoever taught you did an excellent job. That is the correct response. I recognize the three of you as my kin.”<br />
<br />
The centroid demon lord clapped his hands which produced a large clap of thunder in the chamber. Instantly Matt, Don, and Paul cried out as they were encased in cocoons of flame. Their bodies writhed as they screamed in pain, their flesh being destroyed and reformed. Their mass increased greatly, the screams getting deeper and more bestial. Bestial bellows replaced equine whinnies and shirks. Matt roared like a lion. Don emitted a loud howl and Paul bellowed like a bull. The flames winked out revealing three dragon scaled centaurs. Their horns scraped the ceiling of the chamber. Matt had the upper body of a humanoid lion with huge fangs and sharp claws. Don had the upper body of a large humanoid wolf with piercing golden eyes. Paul’s upper body was that of a huge minotaur. All thee demons ripped their chains from the ceiling effortlessly, the shackles still affixed to their wrists. All had large bull horns topping their heads.<br />
<br />
“Thank you father”, growled Matt. The other two brothers nodded assent respectfully.<br />
<br />
Greyon smiled at his adopted offspring. “You will wear those chains always as a mark of your former bondage. They are weapons now.” The chains glowed blue with magical energy. ”You join a strong and powerful clan. Make me proud. Wreak havoc on your enemies. Leave them in ruins. Create your soldiers and begin your attack.<br />
<br />
The three brothers smiled as they reached out with their corruption already coating the horse cocked humans. Flames erupted around them as they too were transformed into lesser warrior beasts. All were centaurs of various types. All wore their chains after breaking them.<br />
<br />
Greyon smiled one last time at his new children. “I take my leave now. Vengeance is yours to obtain.” <br />
<br />
When Greyon left the magical force field disappeared with him. Time flowed normally in the chamber once more. The shouts of hinny demons could be heard outside in the darkened hall.<br />
<br />
Matt smiled at his assembled troops and brothers showing his leonine fangs. He growled only one word. “Attack!”</p>
