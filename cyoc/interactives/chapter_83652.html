<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan panicked as he watched his pup uncontrollably moan and touch himself as he gradually swelled. Dan&#39;s lips were dry as he<br />
was both unsure of what to do and strangely aroused. He almost didn&#39;t notice as a big hand grabbed him and yanked him back, <br />
just barely saving him from receiving a powerful uppercut to the jaw from a reddened, meaty cock head. Barry came into view <br />
as he held onto Dan, observing his pup.&quot; Well, it looks like you&#39;ve got yourself a wild one&quot; Barry said, smiling down at Dan.<br />
Dan looked back up to him confused. &quot; Wild one?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Barry left Dan at a safe distance from the slowly swelling Jack and went to a bare place in the wall with a big red button. <br />
Barry slammed his big fist into the button and ,suddenly, red lights were flashing all across the room. &quot; When a pup becomes<br />
latched onto their master, they have a habit of retaining too much &quot;devotion&quot; betwen their legs&quot; Barry joked. &quot; They are <br />
pretty rare but, if left unchecked, they could be gigantic bears that are trapped in their own cages of devotion that are<br />
too strong for them to come out of. It&#39;s all a part of growing up when you&#39;re a red head.&quot; he said as he moved his hand to <br />
a smaller button below the bigger red button and pressed it. The windows and doors to the shop dropped steel fences that<br />
blocked all from the outside world. Then, the table fell through what looked like a suprise hatch in the ground and a vanished<br />
into the trap door. In its place, a larger table with chains and cuffs that looked like they were supposed to restrain <br />
Christmas hams arrived. &quot; This is why the guv&#39; pays me the big bucks&quot; he said as he pulled out what looked like something you&#39;d<br />
use to restrain a large dog by the neck.<br />
<br />
As all of this was happening, Jack had been slowly growing larger, his body stretching in all directions. Barry actually <br />
looked worried as it seemed Jack was a special case. &quot; Wow. I&#39;ve never seen one grow so fast so soon. He&#39;s already broken<br />
into Stage 2. There might not be a lot of time for me to put ink on this big guy.&quot; Barry seemed to bulk himself up as if<br />
to stand bravely before a larger foe. Like a panther, he jumped up and swung the Redhead Catcher, getting it to fit around<br />
Jack&#39;s slowly growing neck. &quot; Got ya!&quot; Barry cheered as he landed, pulling Jack down with him. He quickly jerked the catcher<br />
and pulled Jack in the direction of the table. Jack, still absorbed in his devotion, was completely submissive as he was<br />
thrown onto the table. &quot; Hurry and help me latch him before he gets to Stage 3!&quot; Barry called as he lifted one of Jack&#39;s <br />
heavy arms and slipped it into a cuff. Dan slowly went over to Jack as Barry ducked under the table to fasten the redhead<br />
behemoth&#39;s cock. He reached for an arm and he felt his pup quiver with his touch. &quot;Ma....ma....master&quot; he cried in a deep,<br />
rumbling, yet pathetic voice. Dan closed his eyes as tried to avoid looking at his pup and slipped an arm into a cuff. <br />
<br />
Barry had already fastened the other four and quickly tied a chain to the restrained Jack&#39;s collar. He didn&#39;t waste any time as<br />
he drew his untensils and set them some distance away from Jack. Jack was still swelling and was starting to grow into his<br />
cuffs as the strong rubber began to adjust to the increased size. Jack&#39;s balls had already begun to grow past his knees and<br />
were now slowly tipping off the table. Their size continued to rival his growing, plump glutes; each one like a watermelon <br />
that shook and quivered with its owner. &quot; Stand back, sir&quot; Barry asked politely as he turned on some of the tools, each <br />
giving its own sound to the musical of whurring sirens and squelling metal. The table was having trouble containing Jack as<br />
he continued to grow heavier, both arms surpassing 44 inches. Barry ignored all distractions as he leaned in and pressed the<br />
tool into the captive red head&#39;s lower back. Instinctively, the loudest roar Dan had ever heard came from Jack&#39;s large, bearded<br />
maw. It was only when Dan saw veins bulging on different parts of Jack&#39;s big, nearly naked body that I caught on to his subtle<br />
changes. As Jack&#39;s arms broke 46 inches, hair had begun to grow from beneath him. His chest, his gut, his crotch; there was <br />
no where for the hair to hide. Even with all the growing muscle on his pale skinned body, Jack&#39;s red hair was shining through<br />
like an orange beacon to his heritage. Dan&#39;s cock shivered as his pup slowly became a large, beastial monster. The pup I&#39;d<br />
put a collar on was unrecognizeable as he seemed to be sinking deeper and deeper into some primal stage as he grew. &quot; He&#39;s <br />
moving past Stage 3 to Stage 4!&quot; Barry called past the noise to Dan. He couldn&#39;t dare to imagine what Stage 4 was as he heard<br />
another squel from the table. <br />
<br />
The iron table was putting up a good fight against the monster redhead it was confining/ His previous 10 foot size was much <br />
more manageable but, as he slowly broke the 17 footer mark, he was becoming harder and harder for government paid, reinforced<br />
steel table to handle. It was like watching a giant white and red beast outgrow his chains. Dan had never been so turned on <br />
in his life. &quot; Almost done!&quot; Barry called again as he set one tool down and drew another buzzing object. Jack was still growing<br />
into a bigger and bigger handful as Barry worked, his devotion for his master too much for anyone or anything to contain. The<br />
restraints were tearing quickly against the power of such size. Dan watched amazed as he could see the veins swelling beneath <br />
Jack&#39;s skin. As his power grew, the confinement tools only weakened. <br />
<br />
Jack&#39;s collar was choking Jack&#39;s thickening neck as his arms ballooned past 50 inches. Dan could see on Jack&#39;s face that he <br />
was becoming more and more focused on serving him. Dan jumped as he felt some warm and very wet soaking his feet. He gasped<br />
as he saw a puddle of cum spreading from beneath the table. Clearly, Jack was producing a mass delivery of sweet, redhead <br />
cum. It was so warm to the touch and glistened in the light of the red sirens. &quot; I just need one more minute! If he gets too<br />
big, you wont be able to fit him in any building ever again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan began to drool as he imagined Jack in a daydream, so big he&#39;d have to lift roofs for him to be with his Master. That much<br />
power under his finger made Dan&#39;s cock grow half an inch bigger, ripping his briefs. Dan woke from his dream as he heard the <br />
buzzing halt and his young, redhead pup made a final, powerful roar that seemed to shake Dan&#39;s heart before he laid on the<br />
table, panting. The table was a wreck as its legs were bent from so much weight on it. The floors were blanketed in a <br />
four inch pool of thick cum that seemed to warm the room. Of course, Dan&#39;s much larger redhead produced his own level of heat<br />
as he lay on the defeated table. Jack&#39;s arms had long outgrown the confines and were stretched off one side of the bed. His<br />
legs followed suit as their thick, beefy muscles stretched off the table, Jack&#39;s feet hanging in the air. Jack&#39;s collar was<br />
officially ruined as his neck laid over the end. The thick muscles in his neck were covered in the tattered material that<br />
was left but there was no way the collar could be replaced. Every muscle was big and relaxed on Jack&#39;s body yet still exuding<br />
an intense power that Dan could see. He could also see that Jack&#39;s ass, which had once been two melons, were now two bean <br />
bags that, by the looks of it, were filled with cement. They seemed almost as if they were protecting the space between them,<br />
their mass pressing firmly together. Dan&#39;s admiring of his pup&#39;s muscles was halted when he saw the big, furry body move. He<br />
looked at Jack&#39;s face and saw tears rolling down the sides. &quot; I&#39;ve destroyed Master&#39;s collar&quot; came a powerful voice that made<br />
Dan quiver. Jack was so massive and powerful yet, even at such an enlarged size, he still cared about his master. Dan built<br />
back up his sense of domination over Jack and walked up to his perch, laying a hand on his large forearm. &quot; It&#39;s ok, pup,<br />
we&#39;ll get you a new one&quot; he said like the loving master he was. <br />
<br />
Barry was laid flat in his chair as he looked over Jack&#39;s new mark. &quot; Well, that was quite the handful&quot; he said as he looked<br />
down at his ruined shoes and pants. &quot; My master&#39;ll be proud of how I stood up against such a powerful pup of Dan&#39;s&quot; he said<br />
with a smile on his face. At this sentence, the muscles my hand was on became super dense as Jack began to muscle himself <br />
up to his feet. <br />
<br />
Dan had to stand back as Jack began to tower over him and Barry like a massive pillar. He was up to 25 feet tall and had the width<br />
of a trailer. A wet spot formed on Dan&#39;s jockstrap as the man-pup above him looked down over his massive pecs to see his little<br />
Master staring up at him. &quot; I will do everything in my power to make you happy, Master. EVERYTHING&quot; he roared as he flexed two<br />
giant biceps that must have had the power to bend any metal. A massive dong big enough to terrify an elephant and two herculean<br />
balls bigger than wrecking balls bounced between the redhead&#39;s thick, powerful legs. What was in store for Dan and his big pup?!</p>
