<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amielle lazily did a backstroke in the pool, enjoying the nice sunny weather.  Toni had given up on swimming (it turned out she was not a strong swimmer), and was instead sitting on the pool steps, half-submerged in the water, watching her.<br />
<br />
Amielle felt a little guilty, like any Angel, she excelled at whatever task she was called upon to perform- which meant she could easily outswim a dolphin.  And she found she enjoyed the water immensely.<br />
<br />
But that left Toni alone, so she swam over to her lover and sat next to her, putting an arm around the smaller girl.  “Hey, beautiful.”<br />
<br />
Toni smiled shyly.  “Hey yourself.  Bored of swimming already?”<br />
<br />
“No”, Ami admitted.  “But I&#39;d rather spend time with you.”  She kissed the other girl.<br />
<br />
“Aw.”  Toni blushed, then leaned on Ami&#39;s shoulder.  “I love you so much.”<br />
<br />
“I love you right back.”  Ami smiled.  “So I guess I shook things up, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Oh with the baby?  Too bad.  This is our baby, and I&#39;m going to love the stuffing out of them.”<br />
<br />
“Her.”  Amielle said.<br />
<br />
“You can tell already?”<br />
<br />
Ami touched her lover&#39;s nose.  “Angel!”<br />
<br />
“Oh you cheater.”  Toni sighed.  “I wish I could do half the things you can do.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I can&#39;t bring a woman to a screaming orgasm with my tail.  So there&#39;s that.”<br />
<br />
“Maybe not, but you can do some amazing things to me with a feather.”  Toni replied.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, I wonder if Gemory would let me use a feather on Danielle!  I really need to pay her back.”<br />
<br />
“For swallowing you?”  Toni raised an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“Uh, no, that wasn&#39;t really her fault though.  No the part before that.  She&#39;s almost as good with her tongue as you are!”<br />
<br />
“Oh is that so?  I&#39;ll take that as a challenge!”<br />
<br />
Ami laughed.  “You would, my love.  But you shouldn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a competition.  Danielle is fun to fool around with, but you are the one who stole my heart.”<br />
<br />
Toni blushed.  “Aw.”<br />
<br />
Ami kissed her again, and for a time, that&#39;s all they did.<br />
<br />
“Say, Ami.  Do you think there&#39;s a way I could get you pregnant?”<br />
<br />
Ami thought about that.  “Well you can&#39;t do it the way I did.  But I suppose if you get your shapeshifting unlocked, you could do it the regular way.”<br />
<br />
Toni nodded.  “I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d want my baby...but I&#39;d like having the option.”<br />
<br />
“Oh love, it would be wonderful to have a life inside me, a life that you helped create.  I would never turn that down.”<br />
<br />
Toni smiled at her.  “Ok.  That&#39;s good.”<br />
<br />
“You forgot to ask Danielle to change your breasts back.”  Ami noted, as Toni&#39;s breasts were still swollen.<br />
<br />
“Ah, yeah, I planned on it, since it&#39;s a little uncomfortable now that I&#39;m lactating.”  Toni admitted.<br />
<br />
“Then why didn&#39;t you?”<br />
<br />
“I thought maybe you might want to try my milk?”  Toni blushed.<br />
<br />
“Oh.  Oh!  Well yes, don&#39;t mind if I do!”  Ami beamed.  She shrank to a smaller size, and Toni picked up her.  Soon she was no bigger than an infant, and Toni put her to her breast.<br />
<br />
Ami gently placed her mouth on a swollen nipple and began to suckle- she was instantly rewarded with a delicious warm liquid.  It was hard to describe the taste, even to her senses; but it was unmistakably Toni-flavored.  She lay there, peacefully in Toni&#39;s arms, hearing Toni make soft noises of pleasure.<br />
<br />
Then Toni&#39;s grip on her tightened, and Ami felt the temperature around them rise drastically.  She tried to break free, but found herself strangely weak!  Toni was crying out now, though not from pain, precisely.<br />
<br />
The nearby water began to steam and then boil.  Again Ami tried to break free, but she was held tightly.  She began to feel emotions that were not her own...<br />
<br />
Pain!  Pleasure!  Pain!  Pleasure!  Fear!<br />
<br />
Toni&#39;s emotions!  But why was she so weak...with a stunned realization, she came to the only logical conclusion- Toni was feeding from her!<br />
<br />
There was only one thing to do, she began drinking Toni&#39;s milk, trying to replenish her power as she sent out a mental call for help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gemory had sensed something was wrong, and bust out onto the deck.  Mist was already there, staring helplessly.  <br />
<br />
The pool&#39;s water was roiling as Toni screamed, holding a tiny form to her bosom- a form with red hair!<br />
<br />
Toni was in her full Succubus form now, her skin tinged read.  Her wings literally turned to ash, and large lumps were forming on her back.<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s happening to her?!”  Danielle sounded worried.<br />
<br />
“Stay back, my love.  Toni is evolving!  Mist, we need to get Amielle away from her, she&#39;s trying to absorb her!”<br />
<br />
<br />
Amielle felt Toni&#39;s thoughts and feelings more strongly now.  The line between them was fading.  She felt very light and weak.  If this continued, she would become a part of Toni, and lose her sense of self.<br />
<br />
She and her love would be one.  And the baby...the baby would be inside her.  The more she thought about it, the more she found she wanted this.  Why fight it?<br />
<br />
&#39;NO!&#39;, a mental voice flared in her mind.  Was that...Gemory?<br />
<br />
&#39;TONI WOULD NOT WANT THAT!  IT WOULD DESTROY HER!&#39;<br />
<br />
Yes.  That was true.  She&#39;d blame herself.  &#39;I can&#39;t...I can&#39;t get free...&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I WILL HELP YOU.&#39;<br />
<br />
Help?  From a Fallen?<br />
<br />
But then she felt something touch her halo.  Which should be impossible!  But Gemory had grabbed it.  The holy light burned her flesh, but something was happening- she was receiving more power than she&#39;d ever gained before.  She could hear the sounds of the Angels singing and worshipping God in the Temple...<br />
<br />
She broke free, and hovered in the air, looking at her lover.<br />
<br />
Black-feathered wings were bursting through Toni&#39;s skin painfully.  Her tail had become longer and thicker, and was lashing around wildly.  And her belly was swollen...oh no, the baby!<br />
<br />
“Danielle!  I need your power!”  Gemory yelled.  “Come to me, take my hand, I can protect you!”<br />
<br />
Without a moment&#39;s hesitation, Danielle ran forward, her clothing smoldering and her hair burning; the scent of it hung in the air.  But at Gemory&#39;s touch, she was protected, even as her clothes burst into flames.<br />
<br />
“The baby is trying to grow up while inside Toni!  I need you to keep her small and young!”  Gemory yelled.<br />
<br />
Amielle descended and clung to Danielle&#39;s back, trying to give her power.<br />
<br />
Mist was swearing in Old Norse, as she pulled Toni out of the pool and into her arms.<br />
<br />
Danielle released her power.  Toni&#39;s belly was terribly distended and she was in pain as the baby tried to grow up without being born!<br />
<br />
And Danielle focused on turning back the clock.<br />
<br />
Time seemed to stand still, and then, a blast of air pressure hit the area like an explosion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Danielle came too slowly.  “Oofta”, she said.  Her voice sounded strange.  She slowly sat up.  She was naked and it was dark outside, save for the back porch lights.<br />
<br />
“Oh good honey, you&#39;re ok.”  A young girl&#39;s voice.  She turned to look, and saw what had to be a child-version of Gemory.<br />
<br />
“Gem, what?”<br />
<br />
“Overload.  You lost control of your power, and it made us all younger.”  Gemory shrugged.<br />
<br />
Danielle looked down, and it was true.  Her chest was flat again, but this time because she looked like a girl of ten!  “Oh shit.”<br />
<br />
“Good news, it should wear off.  Bad news, we all got affected.”<br />
<br />
“The baby?”  Danielle asked, afraid.<br />
<br />
“Fine, fine.  Somewhere during all that, Toni gave birth.  She and Ami are with Mist now.”<br />
<br />
Danielle frowned.  “So why am I laying around naked outside still?  You could have brought me in.”<br />
<br />
“Watch.”  Gemory reached out to touch Danielle.  A spark of static elecricity jumped and hit Gemory, who jumped back a little.  “You absorbed a little too much juice from Ami, so I had to wait for you to wake up to tell you how to get rid of it.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.  I&#39;m sorry.”  She then noticed Gemory was holding her other hand out of sight.  “What&#39;s wrong with your hand?”<br />
<br />
“Ah.”  Sheepishly, she showed it to Danielle.  It was horribly burned!<br />
<br />
“Oh my Go..” she stopped.  “Sorry.  But I thought you couldn&#39;t be burned?!”<br />
<br />
“Not normally.  Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll heal.”<br />
<br />
“When you say not to worry, you know what I do?”<br />
<br />
Gemory sighed.  “Oofta.  Ok, but seriously, it&#39;s going to be ok.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Gemory then explained what Danielle needed to do, then put a towel around her as they went inside.<br />
<br />
They found everyone in Toni and Ami&#39;s bedroom.  Mist looked like a girl of 14, Ami was a cute little cherub of about nine, and Toni was maybe six or seven, doing her best to cradle a baby.<br />
<br />
The little girl was beautiful, with short red hair the same color as Amielle&#39;s.  She looked a few months old, and was drinking from a bottle.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow.  Sorry guys.”  Danielle said.<br />
<br />
“Oh Danielle!  Don&#39;t be sorry!  You saved the day!”  Toni cried, tears in her eyes.  “Come here, meet your step-granddaughter!”<br />
<br />
Danielle sat on the bed and gently touched the little girl&#39;s hair.  “So what&#39;s her name?”<br />
<br />
“We decided on Damia.  Da for Danielle, Mi for Mist, and A for Angel...Gemory didn&#39;t want to be involved.”  Kid Ami giggled.<br />
<br />
“I thought it was D for Devil, Ami, and A for Angel?”  Toni said.<br />
<br />
“Was it?  I&#39;m a little loopy.  Whatever Gemory did to my halo has me as high as a kite!  Whee!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, right, let me fix that.”  Gemory reached for empty air atop Amielle&#39;s head, but Mist grabbed her hand.  <br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t you dare!  I saw how you got burned the last time!  Tell me what to do.”<br />
<br />
Gemory grumbled something about &#39;trade secrets&#39;, and then said something in a beautiful, musical language.  <br />
<br />
&#39;That must be the Angel language&#39;, Danielle thought.  Gemory and Toni did wince a little bit, but apparently it didn&#39;t really harm them. <br />
<br />
Mist seemed surprised.  “Really?  How interesting.”  She then reached out and touched empty space above Amielle&#39;s head.  Dani glimpsed a glowing object, and then it was gone.<br />
<br />
Amielle fell onto the bed.  “Oh now I feel sleepy...”.  She then passed out, snoring, and Toni cuddled against her.<br />
<br />
“I didn&#39;t think Angels needed to sleep.”  Danielle pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Normally, we don&#39;t, but she&#39;s been through the ringer lately.”  Mist clarified.<br />
<br />
“We should probably call Rafe.  She&#39;ll probably be horrified, then tease me about being a little kid.”  Gemory grumped.<br />
<br />
“But you&#39;re so adorable!  We should keep you this way!”  Danielle smiled.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m a Duke of Hell, I shouldn&#39;t be adorable!”  Gemory snapped.  Then, in a softer voice, “but if you think I&#39;m adorable, I guess it&#39;s ok for now.”<br />
<br />
“Come on, let&#39;s give them some rest.”  Danielle pulled Gemory out of the room.<br />
<br />
Once there, she sat down with the pint-sized Demon on the couch.  “Did I see that right?  Toni has angel wings now?”<br />
<br />
“Black wings, but yes.  And four of them!  I can&#39;t imagine why, even I only had two wings.”  Gemory pouted.<br />
<br />
“And a super long tail.  I saw she had it wrapped around her waist.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, well, that&#39;s not as strange.  I&#39;m surprised it didn&#39;t sprout feathers too.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, like an Archaeopteryx?”  Danielle asked.<br />
<br />
“Something like that.”  Gemory put her arms around Danielle and sighed.  “I put you in danger.  I&#39;m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“You were worried about Toni.  She&#39;s your kid now, and Damia is your grandkid.”<br />
<br />
“Yours too.”  Gemory pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but you&#39;ve known her for years.  I&#39;m just the new girl.”<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re -my- new girl.  There&#39;s a difference.”<br />
<br />
“So what do we do now?”<br />
<br />
Gemory sighed.  “Cuddle.  I&#39;m too tired for sex, and you probably have the sex drive of a ten year-old.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s because I am a ten year-old!”  Danielle giggled.<br />
<br />
So that&#39;s what they did.</p>
