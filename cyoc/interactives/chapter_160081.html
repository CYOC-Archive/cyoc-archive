<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark enjoyed just sitting there while Aidan as his underwear sucked on him and tickled his ass when he licked him. The massage he got from both Geoff and Daniel on his feet was really relaxing, and he was tempt to fall asleep there on the computer chair. That was when the doorbell rung loudly.<br />
„Have you invited someone yourself, Aidan? Or is it someone looking fort he rest of you?“ Mark said, turning tot he laptop to scan his guests. It were three young men around the age of him and the others, Jeremy, Xavier and Mitch. Deciding quickly he added the „Mark rules“ command to the three of them before he got up to open the door.<br />
„Hi, you must be Jeremy, Xavier and Mitch, friends with Aidan and Geoff, right?“ Mark asked once he opened the door.<br />
„Yes, that&#39;s us. I´m Jeremy. Geoff send us a note he was over at Aidans with the others if he doesn´t open his door, so we came over. Are they here? And who are you by the way?“ Jeremy answered while Mitch nodded as greeting. Xavier remained silent.<br />
„Oh, I´m sorry I didn´t introduce myself. I´m Mark, a friend of Aidan. They are all over in the living room, I was just nearest tot he door to answer it.“ Mark explained, an evil grin at the end oft he sentence. He let them in, all three heading for the other room while Mark closed the door. There he had his missing pieces.<br />
„You said the others are here Mark, so where are they?“ Mitch said in an annoyed tone from the other room.<br />
Mark followed after them, quickly dropping at the computer chair again, saying: „They are with me, don´t worry. Now freeze and be silent.“<br />
Just as Jeremy wanted to ask what Mark meant he was suddenly unable to move or talk, the same applied for Mitch and Xavier next to him. They all looked confused to Mark, who was reading something on the laptop.<br />
„So Jeremy and Xavier are in the same courses as Aidan, interested in arts, while Mitch has interest in engineering. And look at that, both Jeremy and Xavier love each other, but were to shy to say it out loud. Okay, so I know who will be what.“ Mark thought grinning. He then turned back tot he others, quickly stripping of his old jeans and shirt. The he explained what had happened so far tot he others and what would now also be their fate.<br />
Meanwhile all oft he already changed humans had screamed mentally for the three to run away, but it was in vain. Geoff cursed that he had send them that note, as he was now guilty of dooming them as well.<br />
When Mark was finished explaining, Jeremy didn´t know if he should laugh fort hat crazy story or be afraid i fit could be real. Mitch looked horrified, even i fit all sounded crazy. Xavier really laughed, even if in silence, for how crazy that man was.<br />
Mark got over tot he kitchen, getting a glass of water before returning to his soon to be clothes. After sipping a bit oft he water he started with the same simple command as the others had gotten: „Now strip naked, as you won´t need your clothes anymore.“<br />
They wanted to refuse, but their bodies worked on their own, stripping naked in only a couple of seconds. That was also the moment Jeremy noticed the already discarded clothes on the floor, and he started to panic. What if that were the clothes of his friends and Mark really changed them?<br />
Mark grinned evilly at them before he started with Jeremy and Xavier: „So, Jeremy, Xavier, you are also interested in arts like Aidan, therefore it´s fitting you two will be close to him. You also love each other, even if you both didn´t say it to one another, so I will grant you closeness to each other as well. Jeremy, you will come here to my right leg while Xavier will move to my left one. You will then hug each other around my underwear and each of you will kiss my ass check on your side. You will both wrap your legs around mine and place your cocks by my knees.“<br />
Both men wanted to protest loudly, but couldn´t while they did as Mark commanded them to do. At least the underwear was clean, they both thought before remembering it was Aidan, also under this madman&#39;s curse, and they kissed him, not knowing it was Aidan&#39;s ass above Mark&#39;s.<br />
Aidan screamed at them as they wrapped around him and kissed his ass, but it didn´t stop them.<br />
Mark smiled down at them and continued: &quot;So, now that you are in position, let´s start the changes. As you can guess you will become my new jeans together, therefore you two will merge together. Each of you will be one side of the jeans, as your body will wrap around the leg you hug with your legs and become a blue jeans leg. Your genitals will be a pad on my knees and you will feel them there. Your mouth will be the opening of my back pockets, so it will face outwards. Your hair will look like a brown belt to the jeans, to which your hands in the front will become the buckle. Your eyes will be on the pockets as some decoration, both on the front and the back ones.&quot;<br />
Neither Jeremy nor Xavier could do anything as their hug tightened due their arms merging. Slowly their body thinned out while encasing the whole of Mark&#39;s leg down to the socks. They moaned when their cocks were flattened into a pad on Mark&#39;s knees, tightly squeezed by the rest of their bodies. While their heads flattened their mouths and eyes wandered around, and soon they could see both back and front of their side, as the printed on eyes graced the newly formed pockets. Their intertwined hands above Mark&#39;s cock turned into a big belt buckle on top of their hardened and merged hair. Jeremy&#39;s blond hair had darkened while Xavier&#39;s black hair had lightens, so both were now the same brown color. A minute later where before had been two human men was now only a blue jeans in place.<br />
Mark turned towards the laptop, editing their profiles a bit before deleting his command.<br />

<br />

<br />
Satisfied, Mark turned to a horrified Mitch, grinning evilly at him.<br />
&quot;Now its your turn Mitch. You will come over and hug me, putting your hands on my shoulders after they cross around my back. Then you pull your legs up to wrap them around my stomach and back as well. And you can kiss my chest right above my heart.&quot;<br />
It was a strong pull that took Mitch by surprise as he nearly jumped at Mark to hug him tightly. He smashed his lips right over Mark&#39;s heart as his arms and legs intertwined behind Mark&#39;s back, locking him in place.<br />
Mark laughed at him now. &quot;There is someone eager to join his friends. Okay, now your body will become a thin white shirt, with your mouth can be a front pocket to, facing outwards. Your hands will grow longer down my arms to turn into sleeves, while your feet will turn into a short shirts tail. Your hair will turn into the shirts collar, while your eyes can be two buttons on the front, with your nose as the holes on the other side. Finally your cock will be on my stomach near my belly button, but completely flat.&quot;<br />
Mitch was unable to protest the comment of being eager as his whole body flattened against Mark&#39;s skin. His fingers twitched down Mark&#39;s arms, slowly encasing them as his arms and legs merged into the back of his now shirt body. His mouth opened into a pocket over Mark&#39;s heart while his eyes were pulled forward, shrinking into small buttons, which quickly moved through his nose, the new holes to close the shirt. With his hair growing around Mark&#39;s neck and turning into a white collar. Where a minute ago had been Mitch was now only a mostly simple white shirt.<br />
Mark pulled up his profile, quickly adding his wished extras before deleting his command and saving the changes.<br />

		Formfitting to owner, changing form at owners will<br />
		Feeling former cock and balls in front of wearers stomach<br />
		Feeling pleasure when pressed outwards<br />
		Able to eat content of pocket when commanded to by wearer<br />
<br />
Again Mark was satisfied with everything. As he had now a full set of former humans as clothes he used the chronivac to let the world forget that the eight had ever existed, that he owned their stuff which would be shrunken down and transported to his room at home. As an act of kindness he made them able to hear each other, as well as being able to access their minds if he wanted to. After saving he packed the laptop, the only thing remaining with him in the now empty flat, that had belonged to Aidan. Then he left it, making his way home in his new, comfortable clothes.</p>
