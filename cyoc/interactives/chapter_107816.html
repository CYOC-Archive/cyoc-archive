<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen sat through Math barely paying attention, which was normal, but the gravity of her current problem was becoming increasingly terrifying.<br />
<br />
Jen loved sex. Ever since she had lost her flower at age 14, she had loved to fuck. Every position, every kink, any way she could take it she could. She loved cock, her pussy ached for it all the time, and all the hots boys in school wanted her tight snatch.<br />
<br />
The idea of having to deal with something this personal and humiliating, while at the same time denying her sexual cravings, was almost too much to bear. She wanted to scream! Instead she focused on math, boring equations, stupid formulas, and pointless numbers.<br />
<br />
She tried to ignore the yearning in her loins and felt dread as she realized her clothes still felt a little loose on her. She was still shrunken. How long was the &#39;a while&#39; that Kyle said her growth back would take? Worse still, if just pressing her hot button was enough to dwindle her so quickly, there would be nothing left of her when she actually tried to fuck!<br />
<br />
But there was only one way to be sure.<br />
<br />
She shot a text to Kevin, one of the stupid football kids with a hot bod. Quickie? He responded with the predictable reply.<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
During lunch, Kevin met Jen in the old janitor&#39;s closet in the gym that nobody used anymore. Not many words needed to be said, because they were both there for only one thing.<br />
<br />
Kevin placed his lips to Jen&#39;s and began tenderly kissing her while at the same time his hands grabbed her ass. This made her tingle a little, but not as much as when she had been in the bathroom, which was something of a relief. It seemed the stronger the tingling became, the faster she was shrinking down. Maybe touching herself made it go faster, she realized, and began to relax enough to get into it as Kevin&#39;s muscular hands pulled down her skirt and his hand slipped between her legs and began to fondle her sweet pussy.<br />
<br />
Jen bucked into his hand, grinning, realizing the shrinkage was not picking up speed, and while she noticed a perceptible difference in her height versus when they had started screwing around, it was barely anything if you didn&#39;t know what was going on. She&#39;d be able to cover this easily.<br />
<br />
Hot and horny, Jen dropped her panties and started unbuttoning her fuck toy&#39;s pants. When the 8 inch cock slapped up against his shirt, Jen licked her lips and went down on her knees. She took it into her mouth, fingering herself, and felt her beau lean back into some old dusty shelves, his hand instinctively pushing down on her head.<br />
<br />
Jen had sucked a lot of cock. She was a pro. The tingling picked up a little, and in alarm she noticed it was forcing her mouth open slowly as she bobbed, until with a yelp Kevin pulled her up, grinning. She had struck his shaft with her front teeth. In alarm, she realized playing with herself must have sped it up. Like in the bathroom. Dammit, she cursed herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Careful baby, I know you like to eat dick, but not like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
They resumed kissing, and Jen&#39;s eyes widened as she realized she was now a couple inches shorter. As Kevin entered her, aided by slick pussy lube, Jen winced. He felt so much bigger than normal, and his width was already a fair size to begin with. It took her a few minutes to get used to it as he thrusted gently, during which she felt the tingling pick up again. This posed a problem, she already felt her clothes sagging from her couple of lost inches, but she had gone too far now. She had to get Kevin off and make him go away or there would be hell to pay.<br />
<br />
As her lover began to thrust into her with muffled grunts, Jen began to sweat profusely. With each passing second she could feel him stretching her open wider and wider, well beyond her normal limitations and approaching pain. She realized her head only came up to his shoulders now, her clothes and her bra were sagging down over a much smaller girl. She quickly put his hands on her ass and hoisted her legs around his waist.<br />
<br />
Kevin lifted her up... far more easily than usual, but he was too into it to care, face twisting into coital pleasure as Jen&#39;s tighter and tighter pussy gripped him. She felt the tingling reach a new high, and was just about to scream when he jizzed in her, hard. Kevin popping accelerated her process, and with a slick slurp she literally slid off of him as she dwindled madly, becoming lighter and smaller in a quick and intense shrinking spurt. She tried not to let it feel as good as it did, but it felt amazing. She felt it coming as Kevin blew the last of his load all over her top, and she bit her lip as orgasm took her, the tingling reaching a fever pitch as Jen crumpled to the floor of the closet and shrank... and came... and shrank... until a child sized teenager in clothes far too big for her laid trembling beneath the shocked Kevin.<br />
<br />
The jock stared down at the still shrinking Jen in terror, but kneeled down gently to put a hand on her back. &quot;Jen! Baby! W-What&#39;s... what&#39;s happening to you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Urrrrgh!&quot; Jen grunted, arching her back. &quot;Fuck! Your jizz! I&#39;ve gotta... I&#39;ve gotta clean it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Breaking into tears, Jen wailed helplessly and stared up at her now giant fuck toy, approaching less than 3 feet tall and clinging to her cum soaked top and bra. &quot;Kevin!&quot; She whimpered. &quot;Get me to the shower! Please! Help me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;O-Okay!&quot; Kevin said nervously, quickly scooping up the shrinking woman and her clothes and opening the closet door to see if the coast was clear.</p>
