<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle decided that he wanted to be &quot;aware&quot; or whatever it meant. He felt that it probably meant aware of certain background sceneries or something? It sounded weird for an old camera but whatever it was for, it was probably better to be aware rather than unaware. Kyle turned the camera towards his face, gave it an awkward smile, and took the picture.<br />
<br />
He was blinded. More so than any camera flash had ever blinded him. He gave it a few seconds blinking around until his vision finally came back. He decided he would not be doing that again. As he regained his sight he began looking around the room to make sure he was fine when something fell in front of him. He grabbed it and realized it was hair.<br />
<br />
It was his color blond but wavy and was long enough to go around his head. He tugged on it in confusion and it hurt? &quot;But, thats impossible my hair isn&#39;t tha-&quot; Kyle began to say but stopped himself. His voice. It wasn&#39;t his voice that he spoke with. It sounded like a girl Alex&#39;s age. He looked around in a panic, and also realized he was shorter than before.<br />
<br />
Looking down only fueled the flames, as he could no longer see his toes. Two, perky breasts were now blocking the way. The white shirt he was wearing was now frillier somehow and had a design that showed off, the breasts. Kyle ran into the next room, which was difficult as hair bounced in his face and his new members started jiggling. Once in the main floor bathroom, he looked in the mirror to see a girl no older than 16. She was wearing a frilly white v-neck and hello kitty pink pajama pants. Her hair was wavy and was voluptuous too. She had c cup breasts, not in a bra, and a butt that was larger than Alex&#39;s. Her hips were out and her waist was shrunken. Her dick was completely gone. Kyle&#39;s mouth just hung open. &quot;I&#39;m- I- I&#39;m a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
A knock at the door snapped her out of it as someone called. <br />
&quot;Hey Kylie? Kylie you in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle realized it was his daughter Alex. Though Kyle&#39;s hopes were dashed after she realized what Alex had called her. Kyle, or &quot;Kylie&quot;, decided to play it cool.<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah Alex. It&#39;s me. Kylie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex replied with a slightly confused tone.<br />
&quot;Lol. Okay weirdo. I&#39;m going to bed. Meet you up in our room k?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;K. See you there.&quot; Kylie responded, trying desperately not to panic while mimicking his daughter&#39;s speech pattern. Alex walked away and Kylie exited the bathroom and started pacing in the living room. She whispered as she walked. &quot;I&#39;m a girl. I am a teenaged girl. My daughter thinks I&#39;m a girl. What the hell. What the actual hell.&quot; She said in a quiet panic. <br />
<br />
Kylie looked up at the mantle&#39;s mirror, gazing at the pretty girl she now was, when her eyes drifted to the family photos. Kyle&#39;s wedding picture was gone. Mary was still there in her beauty, but standing beside her was his buddy Tyler. &quot;What?!&quot; She whisper screamed. &quot;Tyler didn&#39;t  marry Mary. I did. What the hell.&quot; She kept looking and saw the next one was of Mary holding newborn Alex, but next to her was his ginger haired buddy Tyler.<br />
<br />
The next was completely new. Tyler was holding an infant Alex, while Mary was holding a baby that Kyle didn&#39;t recognize. Then, in the background of the photo, was the St. Augustine&#39;s ORPHANAGE. Kyle or Kylie figured out what that was. It was him, or her, being adopted by Mary and her apparent husband. The only other photo Kyle could bare to look at was one of &quot;her&quot; and Alex&#39;s 5th birthday party. &quot;She&quot; looked a bit like Dylan, but with wavy blond hair, a cuter face, and a puffy purple dress. The kid next to Kyle looked like Alex but with more freckles and curlier, redder hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex, a-and Dylan aren&#39;t my biological kids anymore.&quot; Kyle realized. &quot;Tyler married Mary, had Alex, adopted me, and then had Dylan. No. This can&#39;t be real. Am I having a mental breakdown? Has it always been this way? Think Kylie-er KYLE. Think Kyle.&quot; <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when it clicked. Kyle looked over and saw that damned camera. The second he opened his eyes after that picture his entire world changed. It had to be the case. Kyle picked up the photo he took and instead of his award smirk was &quot;Kylie&quot; making a kissy face. Kyle knew it had to be the case. He just had to take another picture and then change himself back. Right as he was about to grab the camera another hand passed his and grabbed the device. Kyle jumped and turned around.<br />
<br />
Tyler was standing there with overgrown curly hair and a 5 o&#39;clock shadow. Kyle almost snapped at him for the photos he saw but he knew if Alex was any indication he&#39;d just think he was crazy. He had to play it cool. &quot;Um, hi uh, dad. What&#39;s up?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie, it is 12 o&#39;clock at night, and you&#39;re here stomping around and waking everyone up. It&#39;s time to sleep.&quot; Tyler said with his serious voice. Kyle knew that tone and he wasn&#39;t going to be convincing him of anything. He also still had the camera, so if he smashed it in a fit of rage, then Kyle would be Kylie forever.<br />
<br />
Kyle quietly filed in line and walked upstairs, He walked into Alex&#39;s room where Tyler shut the door. Kyle wasn&#39;t changing back tonight. He&#39;d have to try tomorrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sis what are you doing?!&quot; Alex said in a quiet but judgmental tone. &quot;Do you want daddy to cancel the party all together? We gotta play on his good side if we want this to happen.&quot; Kyle was trying to listen but Alex&#39;s hair was distracting him. There was so much and it was so curly he almost couldn&#39;t see her face. The Kyle realized he was upset. Probably because his life changed but also possibly to his new hormones kicking in. With that Kylie started to tear up.<br />
<br />
Alex immediately changed tunes. &quot;Hey hey hey Kylie. It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not mad, it&#39;s okay. What&#39;s up? Is it Brandon? Is he being a dick to you again?&quot; Kyle didn&#39;t even want to know who Brandon was. All of this was too much. He just wanted to here his sister talk to her. Daughter. He mean daughter. This was getting weird. &quot;No Alex, it&#39;s just, a lot has been happening.&quot; She semi-lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s okay. You can rest tomorrow, I&#39;ll suck up to daddy. You just relax and then have fun a the party K? It&#39;ll be fun even if the boys have to sneak in through the basement window.&quot; Alex said in a reassuring tone. Kyle was a little annoyed that Alex was sneaking people in through the window but her tone helped Kyle re focus.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right. Thanks uh, sis.&quot; Kyle said with a warm smile. They hugged goodnight and climbed into bed. Alex cradled in her nightie as Kyle laid in the foreign pink bed. He just had to make it to tomorrow. He&#39;d find an opportunity to quickly grab the camera, sneak off somewhere and figure out what to do. Kyle somehow managed to fall asleep.</p>
