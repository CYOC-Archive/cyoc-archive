<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Are you sure baby there isn’t something you want to tell me?”<br />
<br />
Jasper had a puzzled look on his face as he just stood there.<br />
<br />
“Oh baby.  Mommy thinks her little guy might need his pants changed.”<br />
<br />
“No I don’t.”<br />
<br />
“Could you take a look at your shoes little guy?”<br />
<br />
Jasper looked down and realized there was a stream of urine flowing down his left pant leg and making a puddle as it spilled over his shoe.  Jasper started to cry.  Standing out in the open soaking his pants like a toddler he could not contain himself.  He was a man not a baby.  He reached out just wanting to be held by his mommy.<br />
<br />
“Baby you are a wet mess.  Let’s take you inside and get you changed.”  Molly marched Jasper into the Rec Center and found the room they set up as a Daycare.  They could see inside.  There were 4 changing station 6 cribs and a play area for small children sets up in the room.    <br />
<br />
There was a line in front of them.  Molly began to undress he wet and messy kid as they waited their turn.<br />
<br />
It was almost their turn when the woman behind them leaned in and commented “Poor little guy.  How old are you young man?”<br />
<br />
Jasper cringed.  Partially dressed, and now with only his soaked training pants as cover he cowered behind Molly.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, he’s just a bit shy.  He wasn’t ready for you know, but we just had to try.  Maybe we’ll try again when he’s 3.”<br />
<br />
Just then the teen behind the admission desk trying to move things alone cleared her throat.  “Next”<br />
<br />
Jasper balled up his fist and hit Molly in the thigh when he heard that comment.  Molly was pissed but held off on a response.<br />
<br />
Finally it was their turn.  <br />
<br />
“You can either leave him here and we can take care of him which is really wht this is for or there are bathrooms down the all.” The probably 14 or 15 year old girl explained.<br />
<br />
Molly thought for a moment, then placed the diaper bag in the counter.  Turning and kneeling down to face Jasper. <br />
<br />
“Why did you tell her I was 2.”  Jasper immediately commented. <br />
<br />
I didn’t, I told her you weren’t 3.  What did you want me to say that my 4 year old wet his pants?”  Molly pause for a moment then continued. “Why does it matter, this is only playtime.  For now, how about you get a little time here to get cleaned up so I can get a little break?”<br />
<br />
“You told her I was a baby.”<br />
<br />
“Again, would you prefer I told her my 4 year old wasn’t potty trained?”<br />
<br />
“But I am.”<br />
<br />
“You are, you were standing in front of her with you pants totally soaked.”<br />
<br />
Jasper didn’t have much to say.  Maybe Molly was right.  Better to play a baby than a 4 year old who wasn’t potty trained.  <br />
<br />
Jasper never responded to Molly’s question about giving her a break and his staying her, so she just decided to do it.<br />
<br />
Lost in his own thoughts, he didn’t hear the exchange that followed.<br />
<br />
“I’ll only be another hour maybe 2.”  Molly said and wrapped things up by passing her contact info testing her texting info and exchanging photos.<br />
<br />
Jasper in his wet trainers was handed over the counter hardly noticing the world around him.  His mind was still stuck on his own plight, unable to let go of being outed as a baby.<br />
<br />
Still Jasper was humiliated.  Not taking much notice of being naked and laid out on a changing table, after his mommy just told everyone he was only 2.  He felt like a baby.  It was all he could do to hold it together.  He took a deep breath and tried to center himself. His inside voice was reminding himself.  Remember Jasper, this is just playtime. Just go with it.  You are just a little guy lying down and having mommy clean you up.  It doesn’t bother me that a strap is being pulled across my chest to hold me in place.<br />
<br />
“There we go all safe and snug.” Some you voice said to him. <br />
<br />
Jasper realized that the table was warm and cozy.  Hey this isn’t so bad.  Jasper kept his eyes and just sunk into the moment.<br />
<br />
“Here baby look what I found” that same you voice said.<br />
<br />
His prize hippo was placed into his hands. Without opening his eyes he held it and put it to his mouth.  He felt the warmth of a wash cloth all over his hands and body.  He was being cleaned.<br />
<br />
“There we go baby that’s not so bad is it.  Nice and warm and clean.”<br />
<br />
Jasper settled into sucking on his hippo.<br />
<br />
The rhythm changed.  His bottom lifted by the ankles.  It was familiar, like diapering a baby.  She was diapering a baby.  Like he was the baby. Like this was diaper change his diaper change.  His mind wander as it was all happening.<br />
<br />
Then there was a cloth under him and wait mommy is diapering me.  Jasper was confused.  He thought he was potty trained.<br />
<br />
Jasper, sorry for only the diaper, but I didn’t have any other pants for you.  All I have is this cloth diaper and these plastic pants.   <br />
<br />
Jasper looked tired.  Clad only in a diaper and plastic pants, he no longer looked like he could pass for a 4 year old.  He kept his mouth shut and continued to mouth and suck on his hippo for comfort.<br />
<br />
Molly was tired as well.  She thought to just go home and take a nap, but felt she should stay close, at least at the fair grounds.  She wanted to rest before leaving.<br />
<br />
Molly’s breast continued to ache, especially as she brushed against them.  Molly walked back to where she and Jasper had sat earlier.  Realizing she hadn’t taken her next dose, she pulled out the little bag and took her little bean.   <br />
<br />
Brushing her hand against her breast, she felt wetness on her blouse.  Chuckle a bit at the thought that maybe she was starting to lactate.  With that she closed her eyes.</p>
