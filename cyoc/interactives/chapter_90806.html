<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the middle of his workday, Clemens did have a few things on his mind.  The wedding that was approaching, though they were at least running slightly ahead (having sent the invites out just before they left for work) so there was breathing space there.  Other things he had less control over, however, were grating him at the back of his head, from the Stag night that had been arranged, even though he told himself he’d just have to deal with it when the night came.  But one other item was to do with himself in another way.  <br />
<br />
He knew as fact that many species of reptiles grew continuously throughout their lives (in fact some could have their age worked out through simple measurements), of which snakes were one such group.  This did make him wonder about himself, what it could, or would mean for himself, given that he was partially a snake himself now.  <br />
<br />
The times he did check, he couldn’t really make out if any real growth had occurred, which would mean either a lack of it, or so little it was escaping notice.  In any case, he had a way to find out.  <br />
<br />
“Jassson?  A word pleassse.”  He asked him once he found Jacob.  <br />
<br />
“The party?”  He queried, expecting that that would be the reason for Clemens’ wanting to talk.  <br />
<br />
“No, sssomething elssse.”  Clemens’ steeled himself before he pressed on.  “I need your help to…measure….me.”  <br />
<br />
“Come again?”  <br />
<br />
“Sssince I took the ssserum, I’ve sshhed twiccce.  Onccce sshhortly after, and again about sssixxx monthsss back.  Jussst need to sssee if there’sss been any growth in me sssinccce.”  Clemens’ stopped at this point, realising it had taken more out of him than he thought it would.  <br />
<br />
“O-kay.  I think I can help with that.  So what do you need measuring?”  <br />
<br />
“The lot.”  Clemens’ replied simply.  <br />
<br />
“Okay, I’ll need a minute then.”  Jacob fished around for what he’d need, measuring tape pen and paper.  <br />
<br />
The next few minutes were spent with Jacob checking the length and width of Clemens, stopping to note down the various measurements he’d taken.  Sometimes checking again to make sure he had an accurate number put down.  <br />
<br />
“Okay, we’re done.”  He stated once he noted the last number down.  “But if I may ask, why worry about it now?”  <br />
<br />
“Jussst sssomething that came to mind, need to take care of it ssso it doesssn’t eat away.”  Clemens’ answered his question honestly.  “Could you keep thisss quiet though?  At leassst for now.”  <br />
<br />
“I’ll try, but if it’s what you’re worried about people will need to know sooner or later.”  Jacob supplied a warning.  “It will make the news if it’s true.”  <br />
<br />
“I know that.  But I’d rather be the firssst one to ssspeak about it.”  He gave his reason for wanting to keep it on the QT.  <br />
<br />
“Well even if it is happening, I haven’t noticed to it must be small.”  Jacob concluded with something he thought could help.  <br />
<br />
“About what I wasss thinking.”  Clemens agreed as he left for his own office.  <br />
<br />
Back there, he brought up the details the Zoo had on him, a requirement for Health and Safety reasons.  Shortly after he’d taken the Animatrix Serum, he’d had every part of him measured, so now all he needed to do was check what had been measured today against the information they had on file.  It didn’t take long, and with Jacob’s large lettering he had an easy time comparing the numbers.  <br />
<br />
It looked to be about a half-centimetre for his tail, and between his neck and spine, about the same.  Very little, and within the margin for error.  And the welcome news of his arms and legs being the same as his previous measurements.  <br />
<br />
“Not too bad then.”  Clemens sighed to himself.  True, he could still be growing, but if he was the rate was so small that it would take a long time for any substantial difference to make itself known.  And with that issue being resolved, the weight on his shoulders lessened considerably as he returned to his work.  <br />
<br />
[+]<br />
<br />
“Jenny!  That’sss me home!”  Clemens called out once he was in their apartment.  <br />
<br />
“In the kitchen!”  He heard her reply as he opened his shirt.  <br />
<br />
“Chicken tonight?”  He asked as he tasted it in the air.  <br />
<br />
“I felt like it.”  Neither could suppress their laughter once they’d worked out just what they’d ended up saying.  <br />
<br />
“Ssso how did today go?”  Clemens’ wondered about how her day had gone, given how the last few had been for her.  <br />
<br />
“Another prank pulled, but no dead animals this time at least.”  Jenny answered, liking the feel of his scales against her exposed back.  <br />
<br />
“That’sss, a ssstart.  What did they do thisss time.”  <br />
<br />
“A fake invite, Animalia they called it.  I left on the table.”  <br />
<br />
“What tipped you off?”  <br />
<br />
“A few things.  Such as the D.C. Address not existing, Gen-U-Tech’s schedule only going to this December when the supposed event is almost a year off, and then there’s the fact that it called for you and me specifically.”  Jenny ran off the reasons she had for suspecting foul play.  <br />
<br />
“Well, I’ll do some checks of my own if you want, sssee into a few thingsss.”  Clemens offered.  <br />
<br />
“I’d appreciate that, dinner will be a while anyway.”  <br />
<br />
In their bedroom, Clemens got the rest of his clothes off as the computer powered up.  Seated, he looked at the information in the invite, and started checking it against anything he could think of.  <br />
<br />
Jenny was right in that the D.C. Address given was non-existent, and when he tried to locate the Las Vegas address, that too, was nowhere to be found.  Not only that they’d even spelt “Patten” wrong, an ‘O’ where the ‘E’ was meant to be.  A thorough check of his e-mails turned up empty on this supposed event as well.  Not only was he convinced now that this was a fake, but a very poorly made one at that.  <br />
<br />
“Okay that’s dinner ready.”  He heard Jenny call to him.  <br />
<br />
He had the lion’s share of the chicken, with Jenny making up for her lesser amount with a good quantity of vegetables, as they tucked in with just their skin and scales to cover them.  Which reminded Clemens about his measurements he’d had taken earlier, certainly it was quite possible that he was growing, but if that were the case, it was a very slow one.  And something he wouldn’t have to worry about too much for the next few years at least.</p>
