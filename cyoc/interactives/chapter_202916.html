<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The twins and Lauren walked into the store, the twins felt self conscious as they felt like everyone was watching them, it was kinda of true as many of the customers were looking at them and some teenagers were joking with their friends about how bizarre they looked.<br />
<br />
The twins were looking at the ground to avoid eye contact with anyone.<br />
<br />
Max had a pinkish blush across his face “dude everyone is staring at us” he said when he turned to Ricky.<br />
<br />
Ricky had his first clenched “it’s annoying because if I was a guy I would be kicking their ass, at least it ain’t anyone we know” <br />
<br />
“Excuse me, we might be needing your assistance” said Lauren to a female employee at the store.<br />
<br />
The employee smiled at Lauren “of course I’ll be happy to help” she said in a cheerful tone.<br />
<br />
Ricky’s heart dropped, he recognised her voice, it was the voice of a 16 year old black girl he has a crush, recently he’s befriended the girl but he hasn’t confused his feelings to her,<br />
<br />
He looked up to confirm his fears, it was definitely her, the name badge gave it away, Rose Johnson.<br />
<br />
Ricky’s pinkish blush darkened to a red colour, he had never seen Rose in such tight clothes, she usually dressed modest so her figure was a mystery to Ricky, however her tight work polo shirt and jeans showed off her impressive curves as well as her small waist.<br />
<br />
“So you see my nieces have come over to visit me for the week however they lost their luggage and the clothes they were wearing shrunk in the wash” said Lauren.<br />
<br />
Rose looked concerned “oh no, that sucks”<br />
<br />
Lauren nodded “thankfully these girls are tomboys so wearing their cousins clothes wasn’t a issue for them” <br />
<br />
“We got a wide range of clothes for any type of person” said Rose.<br />
<br />
“That’s great but the twins told me that they wanted to be feminine for their auntie, isn’t that right girls” said Lauren.<br />
<br />
The boys shyly nodded.<br />
<br />
“Sorry we couldn’t hear you” said Lauren in a passive aggressive tone.<br />
<br />
“Absolutely” said Ricky in a dry and weak voice.<br />
<br />
“Anything for my Auntie Lauren” said Max before flashing a smile, he wanted to keep his mom happy to avoid any issues.<br />
<br />
“Good thinking, Max” thought Ricky.<br />
<br />
“Aw there cute” said Rose.<br />
<br />
Ricky felt a pain in his heart, he wanted his crush to call him handsome or sexy not “cute”. <br />
<br />
“Ain’t they just, oh and we need to get their measurements, they’re growing  girls after all” said Lauren causing the twins to wince,<br />
<br />
“Kill me” thought Max.<br />
<br />
Rose giggled “no problem, I can take them to the back of the store to get measured if you want to look around”<br />
<br />
Ricky felt his heart drop, “no way I can let her see me naked like this” he thought.<br />
<br />
The twins reluctantly followed Rose to the back of the store to get their measurements, Ricky’s nightmare became real after him and Rose went into a changing room to get measured while Max went with a middle age female employee to a separate changing room.<br />
<br />
Ricky felt shy and insecure, emotions which rarely affected the cocky soccer player.<br />
<br />
“Okay sweetie, if you can take off all your clothes expect your panties so we can get started” said Rose.<br />
<br />
“This can’t be happening” thought Ricky.<br />
<br />
He used his sweaty hands to take off his clothes until he was left just in his boxers.<br />
<br />
“This is the worst” he thought as he awkwardly stood half naked with his crush.<br />
<br />
“Boxers” said Rose.<br />
<br />
Ricky heart sunk “oh no she thinks I’m a loser” he thought.<br />
<br />
“They’re so comfy, I wear a pair to bed” she said before smiling.<br />
<br />
Ricky felt relived, he started to feel slightly more comfortable as Rose’s sweet and warm personality felt comforting.<br />
<br />
Rose pulled out some tape measures “you ready for me to measure you”<br />
<br />
Ricky nodded.<br />
<br />
While Rose was measuring his body Ricky just simply looked at his breasts, they were slender and pale, and a good reason for him to not make eye contact with Rose.<br />
<br />
He looked at his face and another wave of anxiety washed over him, his face looked practically identical to his male face expect for a smaller nose and chin, he hopped Rose won’t make the connection.<br />
<br />
“Raise your arms honey” said Rose, Ricky done as he was told.<br />
<br />
Rose wrapped the tape around his breasts and Ricky’s deep red blushed darkened.<br />
<br />
“Is this your first time getting measured “ asked Rose in her usual warm tone.<br />
<br />
Rose got closer to Ricky to tighten the tape measure, he felt her breasts squish against his back.<br />
<br />
“She’s so close to me” thought Ricky as he felt his nipples harden, the tape measure would rub and brush against his erect nipples causing a ticklish sensation through his boobs.<br />
<br />
Ricky just simply nodded at Rose’s question, everything going on was too overwhelming for him to talk.<br />
<br />
“Aw don’t be embarrassed by it, I remember being your age when I got my first bra” said Rose.<br />
<br />
The wholesome moment with Rose made Ricky’s situation worse as all the boy could think about was Rose standing naked with her breasts getting measured.<br />
<br />
He felt his body warm up a little and slight itchy sensation under his belly, “I need to relax, she’s going to notice” he thought.<br />
<br />
“Ah don’t worry girl, being a pre teen doesn’t last forever” said Rose.<br />
<br />
Ricky was shocked that Rose had mistaken him for a pre teen, but he could understand why, his body was so underdeveloped, the only somewhat mature part of his new body was his small breasts.<br />
<br />
“Hey I never caught your name” said Rose.<br />
<br />
Ricky felt his heart rate jump “Urm it’s Ria”<br />
<br />
Rose smiled “pretty name”<br />
<br />
A few minutes passed and Rose was finally done measuring Ricky’s bust.<br />
<br />
“We’re all done now sweetie” said Rose, Ricky was relieved it was over.<br />
<br />
Rose than looked at Ricky’s chest and saw his hardened nipples “Aw you should’ve told me it was cold, let me turn the ac off”<br />
<br />
Rose was mortified that Rose saw his erect nipples, thankfully though she left to talk to Lauren.<br />
<br />
“Thank god that’s over” thought Ricky.<br />
<br />
Max than walked into his changing room only wearing his boxers and oversized tee shirt.<br />
<br />
Max had a blush on his face “that was the worst”<br />
<br />
The twins discussed their experience with getting measured, they talked about how embarrassing it was to get half naked in front of a girl, Ricky left out the part where he felt turned on.<br />
<br />
Lauren than entered the changing room with two outfits in her hands.</p>
