<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sonya is a girl in her 20s she just finished the university of archeology so she could explore around ancient locations in history, she&#39;s a tall girl with light brown hair and beautiful celestine blue eyes.<br />
<br />
Sonya always had a fascination for ancient Egypt, she was interested in many things, their funeral rites and even their deities but there was one deity she always showed interests in, it was Apophis, the snake deity that embodied chaos, probably the main reason why Sonya always had a fascination for this deity was the fact that she once had a pet cobra.<br />
<br />
She decided to travel to Egypt to inspect places forbidden by deities and pharohs,  she never thought that these places could bring bad luck or such things, she used a desert motorcycle to go around the heavy sands of Egypt.<br />
<br />
After hours of driving in her motorcycle, she reached the first location she decided to inspect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alrighty! First location, let&#39;s go!&quot; She chirped, feeling excited to finally go to her first archeologycal exploration, she slowly grabbed her torch and entered what it looked like a temple, as she entered she saw old drawings on the walls, depicting great events in ancient Egypt and this time the main character was Apophis!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm... I guess i just found one of the temples of Apophis.&quot; she said, she kept inspecting every wall and eventually she saw what it looked like a stairway, she decided to take it only to be greeted with another line of walls revealing other great events, how Apophis was fighting the sun god Ra and also showing his down fall.<br />
<br />
Sonya decided to keep looking around and saw what it looked like an ancient symbol of Apophis! She slowly went towards it to inspect it closer but as she went near it, the floor started cracking, &quot;Oh no.&quot; she said, eventually the floor got destroyed and Sonya fell down.<br />
<br />
&quot;AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!&quot; Screamed Sonya, as she was quickly falling, eventually she landed on the sand under the so called &quot;Temple of Apophis.&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh...&quot; said Sonya, she slowly got up and checked if she was okay, &quot;No broken bones? Check. Blood loss? Check. Bad luck? Check.&quot; She said, but as she looked around she saw that it looked like an unexplored part of the temple. Ofcourse, some renegade archeologists decided to explore this place but she saw that there was absolutly no way to find such a place, she looked around and saw infront of her what it looked like an ancient painting of the god of chaos himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wooow....&quot; She said, and right under the painting she saw what it looked like a red sphere, she couldn&#39;t understand what it was made of, she wanted to touch it but she thought of the consequences. Will it shatter? Will it trigger some form of alarm and collapse the entire temple? The possibilities flooded her mind and then she decided to touch it, as she touched it, a powerful light started resonating from the sphere, blinding Sonya, &quot;WHAT THE F*CK?!&quot; she shouted, right after that, she fainted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh... My head....&quot; She said, slowly coming back to her senses, she looked around and remembered what happend to her, she looked around for the sphere and realized it disappeared and felt a burning sensation coming from her arm, she looked and saw a huge scratch around it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really should return to that Egyptian hotel...&quot; She said, she saw an exit and took it.<br />
<br />
After minutes of walking and walking, Sonya barelly got outside, she saw that it was night time, she searched for her motorcycle but felt extremly tired, she decided to lay down for a second to catch her breath, she looked up at the stars lighting up the deserts and eventually saw the moon, it was full, shining in it&#39;s grace, Sonya couldn&#39;t switch her view to anything else, she felt blocked.<br />
<br />
Eventually that sensation faded away as she felt a powerful stomach ache, instantly making her rise up to her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;AGH! My stomach... It hurts.. IT HURTS SO BAD!&quot; She screamed, she covered her stomach but after a few seconds the pain faded, &quot;It... Stopped?&quot; she asked, only to feel the same pain coming from her fingers, she looked and saw that her nails were slowly turning into a pair of sharp claws, &quot;What?!&quot; she shouted, she kept looking and saw black scales slowly covering her hands, she felt her digits crack and saw that her index and middle fingers fused together, only leaving 4 digits on each hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is... happening?!&quot; She shouted, she felt scales slowly covering her entire arms, then she felt them bulk up, she saw her arm muscles growing and growing, she looked like an expert body builder.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I need to find some help right now.&quot; She said, she quickly started running towards her motorcycle, &quot;UGH!&quot; she exclaimed as she tripped and fell on the sands, she looked behind her and saw that her shoes were completly destroyed, she rolled on her back and saw that her socks,shorts and panties were completly destroyed, she looked at her feet and felt them fuse together and growing into a long,meaty snake tail that slowly got covered with the same black scales, eventually Sonya realized what was happening to her, she was becoming Apophis! A weird rush of horror and excitment filled her.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Wait... Apophis is a god, what will happen to m- OOOOOHHHH!!!&quot; She moaned, as she felt a wave of heat coming from her genital area, she looked down and saw that her clitoris pushed forward, &quot;Uuuuuhhhh~&quot; she moaned again, and saw 2 serpentie dicks pushing out, each one having 20 inches!<br />
<br />
She looked at both of them, she felt aroused and flushed, she needed to please herself, she slowly stroked one of them with her hand, only to hear a moan escaping her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;So.... Ssssensssitive....&quot; She gasped, feeling the changes accelerating, she looked at her chest she felt her muscles growing, she watched her breasts deflating, becoming a pair of scaly pecs, she looked down at her chest and saw she had an eight pack! She watched as her stomach and chest were covered in white scales.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yessssss..... MORE!!!!&quot; She shouted, she started stroking her other member, she started pleasing herself more and more, she felt her teeth changing into a pair of sharp fangs, her eyes changed into a pair or red glowing orbs and she sticked her tongue out revealing that it was forked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiiiisssss~&quot; Sonya felt her head slowly being covered by scales, she felt it push into the snout of a cobra, she saw that her nose melted in her snout, she felt her ears melt into her head and she opened her eyes revealing that they turned changed into a pair of blood red snake eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not...Enough...&quot; said Sonya, she kept pleasing herself more and more, she felt her tail push further out, she felt her body grow in size, she was almost becoming as tall as a boulder she saw near her, she felt all of her body growing, including her new members which grew from 20 inches to 30!<br />
<br />
&quot;Yessssss.... I&#39;m sssssso.... Clossssse....&quot; Said Sonya, she closed her eyes in anticipation, she pleased herself untill she reached the peak of climax.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssssssssss~!!!&quot; The new Sonya hissed, he opened his eyes wide and threw his head back, shooting forth his corruptive seed on the sand, slowly blackening it.<br />
<br />
Sonya now looked at himself, he has now become Apophis, he started flexing, he saw that he has become about 8 feet tall! He savoured his new form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect...&quot; Said Sonya, he looked at one the temple he just visited and turned him into this magnificent being, he decided to go inside it, he started slithering towards it and once he entered it, he coiled himself near one of the walls and slowly went asleep.<br />
<br />
Then.....</p>
