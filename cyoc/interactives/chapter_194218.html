<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lilith roamed the night sky looking for the perfect candidate to begin her new army of hell. She had seen many easy targets but they wouldn&#39;t have been very good to gain power or fun. A single kiss would have been enough to corrupt those souls but she would leave those for her soon to be underlings. As she was flying over a park she finally saw a soul worth corrupting and stealing.<br />
<br />
The man sat alone on a bench looking over the lake not noticing the succubus landing behind him. Lilith quickly changed into her human disguise, as much as she hated too. She wasn&#39;t strong enough to start corrupting people out in broad daylight so she needed to remain conspicuous until then. Looking into the man&#39;s soul, it was mostly pure but was weakening and ripe for corruption due to something emotional that just occurred. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is this seat taken?&quot; Lilith asked nonchalantly. The man was surprised at first to hear someone else this late at night but also once he saw who asked, his jaw nearly hit the floor. Standing before him was someone you only saw in modeling shoots or magazines. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, No...No one is sitting there&quot; The man looked back down at the water as the woman strutted over into the park bench, purposely iving a view of her ass to the man. &quot;So uh...What are doing out wandering this late at night?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith looked over at the man with a slight smirk to her face. &quot;I could be asking the same thing. Why is such a handsome man sitting out here all alone. And its rude to ask a woman questions before giving your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH! uh sorry, the name is Matthew. And I&#39;ve had...a pretty rough night. so I figured I&#39;d just sit out here thinking about what I should do next.&quot; Matthew nervously got out trying his hardest to not glance at the woman&#39;s Cleavage.<br />
<br />
&quot;aawww. My name is Lilith. As for your earlier question, I figured I could...use some fresh air.&quot; Lilith quickly thought of some minor excuse to be out and about. Matthew was clearly flushed about something and all she had to do was coax it out of him. &quot;What happened? Seems to have gotten you all down and depressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my girlfriend...well, now my ex. She dumped me tonight for my best friend. Just told me that I wasn&#39;t good lookin enough. That asshat and that...ugh sorry for getting heated.&quot; Matthew tried to calm himself down but before he could, Lilith put a hand over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it sounds like you could let off some &quot;steam&quot;. How about we head back to your place?&quot; Lilith had him hook, line, and sinker. It was a formality at this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, I think its just best if I try and talk it out or see if I can&#39;t repa-&quot; Matthew was cut off by Lilith pulling him into a kiss which he at first tried to pull off from the shock only to fall into the passion.<br />
<br />
Lilith pulled off with a seductive grin and whispered lightly. &quot;Fuck &#39;em. They&#39;ve clearly wronged you. What you need is to clear your head with someone who can show you real love&quot; The second sentence nearly made Lilith vomit but it was the best way to fully convince him. Matthew got up and grabbed Lilith&#39;s hand as they began to walk back to his room for a night of fun.<br />
<br />
The door was barely open before the two where grabbing each other trying to gain control, feeling up every inch of their bodies until they reached the bed, Lilith was the one on top controlling the situation. She began to rip off Matthew&#39;s jacket while he returned the favor, not noticing the moment he threw her clothing on the ground it would disappear in a minor fire.<br />
<br />
After about 5 minutes both of the lovers were completely naked with Lilith preparing for the main event. &quot;Get ready for an experience you&#39;ll never forget.&quot; Quickly, she impaled herself on Matthews rather large member to prevent any second thoughts he may have had. Looking down, she saw his soul quickly being corrupted with lust and malice for the two who wrong him. She smiled wickedly and moaned out in pleasure as she began to fuck the humanity out of him.<br />
<br />
Her Large EE breasts bounced up and down at a rapid pace as she began to think of ways to speed up the process. &quot;You having any regrets? Happy you decided to *moan* fuck this beauty over that slut?&quot; Matthew couldn&#39;t even answer from the please he was feeling, her vagina felt completely different from any other he had done. It felt like it was sucking him like a blowjob, massaging like a normal fuck, and pulling like a handjob, it felt completely surreal. Instead, Matthew just shaked his head up and down.<br />
<br />
Lilith increased her pace trying to draw out his orgasm. &quot;Come on! Let me hear it! You hate that bitch now! She&#39;d be jealous of you right now, getting to fuck the brains out of a beauty like me. You deserve so much better! So let me hear it! Scream it out!&quot; <br />
<br />
Matthew couldn&#39;t hold it back any longer. &quot;FUCK YEAH! SCREW HER! I WANT THIS! I DESERVE THIS! I&#39;m...og god I&#39;m so close!&quot; Lilith saw his soul become completely corrupt just before it happened. &quot;Good...&quot; Lilith then clamped down on his dick hard, forcing his cum out into her succubus pussy.<br />
<br />
The moment Matthew came Lilith went down to kiss him but was sucking hard and eventually started to pull up. As she pulled up, an airy substance began to follow, Matthews soul. &quot;What...what was that...&quot; Matthew began to violently cough as Lilith got off of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that? Just your soul, but that doesn&#39;t matter anymore. What matters...&quot; Lilith changed back into her succubus form as Matthew began to convulse, &quot;...is that you are about to be the first of many demons under my command&quot; Matthews eyes shot open at what he was seeing and hearing but it was too late. A wave of pleasure suddenly took over as his dick got erect again. Unable to stop him he rushed a hand down to it and began to stroke. &quot;Uh oh, looks like someone needs to be &#39;released.&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew didn&#39;t even hear the demoness&#39;s words. He could only focus on his dick and the anger he felt towards his former girlfriend. His muscles were tightening and expanding as they began to get larger and stronger. His whole body began to get larger and his skin began to turn a deep crimson red. He head began to throb as it began to grow horns, not nearly as large as Lilith but still noticeable. &quot;You&#39;re coming along nicely. Well, your soul was a delicious first meal. But you&#39;ll be craving something to fill it for the rest of eternity. Maybe...turning that bitch that dumped you could be fulfilling...Malice. I need to get going, I think you&#39;ll know what to do when you&#39;re done changing. Come see me when you&#39;ve taken care of her and that new boy toy she has.&quot; Lilith walked out the door as the transforming man continued to masturbate.<br />
<br />
Malice was finally getting close. His release from those human shackles was almost complete. He was stronger, larger, and so much more powerful. He didn&#39;t care he no longer had a soul. His new mistress, The soon to be Queen of demons, Lilith was all he needed. His new tail was swinging wildly as he got closer...and closer...until he finally couldn&#39;t hold it. Black shots began to come out of his demonic cock, perfect for corrupting whoever he wanted. His wings finally broke out from his back signifying his complete change into an incubus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Queen Lilith, I won&#39;t disappoint you. That bitch, Jenny, needs to be taught a lesson.&quot; The incubus didn&#39;t even bother using the door, shooting out from the roof going out into the night to show Jenny the error of her ways.</p>
