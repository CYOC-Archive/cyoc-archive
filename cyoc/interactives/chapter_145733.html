<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate walks towards the shore, humming absentmindedly as he thinks of what thrills await. A loyal, older, and stronger crew than he could imagine. Each ready to take his dick in a moments notice. Nate becomes erect at just the thought, his dick now tenting his pants as he sees his ship. There&#39;s a loud ruckus onboard, and Nate feels it&#39;s his duty to fix it. &quot;Alright ye blaggards! Captain&#39;s back on board!&quot;<br />
<br />
There&#39;s silence, then a cheer! The pirates look over to the shore and see their captain, in his full glory. They quickly rush Nate on board, pirates feeling him up, relieved to have their captain back. Nate laughs... then feels something tugging at him. He holds his head, as his thoughts turn to his old body, fat, grey, Nate can&#39;t help but feel some sort of connection with it. In the back of his mind, he hears a familiar voice, the true captain. &quot;So lad, yer going to go back and pleasure me, aye?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate brushes aside the crew, walking desperately to the captains quarters. There he sees it, his body, heavy with fat and muscle, full of grey hairs and a stout dick. Nate shakes his head, &quot;No, yar, ye tricked me!&quot;. &quot;Course I did lad, yer a swabbie, not a captain!&quot; Nate loses control of himself, his hands now roaming the fat body, squeezing the barrel of a chest and feeling the hidden muscle. Nate instinctually closes his eyes as he feels pleasure. It feels so good, Nate begins to love the feeling of his stomach being at the attention of the captain, the feeling of a powerful male taking control and doing with him as he pleases.<br />
<br />
Nates eyes open, his eyes now set on his captain. His rugged hands exploring Nate, giving him feelings he didn&#39;t even know existed. Nate gives a deep chuckle, his flab swaying as he kneels before the captains treasure. Licking his lips, he sees the erect shaft, and in a single moment it is thrust into his mouth. The captain cheers as he sees Nate&#39;s surrender &quot;Yar, ye be a good lad. How about ye get a promotion, aye?&quot; Nates head nods, his focus still on pleasuring the captain, his hands now cupping and feeling the captains filled balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then lad, ye be getting yer prize!&quot;. The captain waves his hand, and Nate begins to feel strange. He wants to look at the captain, to never lose sight of him. To see nothing but his chizzled abs, covered in the dense hair that any man would love. To smell his stink, the BO pooling from his hairy underarms. And to worship his cock, the tool that started this rugged crew. But his eyes are drawn to his tingling chest, he stares down to see his flab begin to leave, muscles shifting as a six pack forms. &quot;&#39;ave at him mateys!&quot; Nate hears, as the crew surround him. Hands now exploring his new abs, the nipples sensitive to the crews merciless gropes. Nate moans, but keeps his captain entertained. His mouth still opened as he feels the captains pubes tickle his nose, his dick deep in Nates throat. <br />
<br />
Nate feels a tightening at his rear, as his bubble butt hardens and firms. He feels the crew eagerly feeling his new ass, chuckling as one dick is pressed against it, then another, then another. Three large dicks waiting at his entrance, and each thrusted in simultaneously. Nate squeals from the pain, but his duty to the captain and crew come first. Standing stoic, Nate is unphased as crewmates begin to sniff and feel the back of his feet. The legs muscular and covered in hair, he feels licks and kisses around his hairy knees. Their assault begins to suddenly climb, grabbing at his hairy balls and uncircumcised glory. Nate immediately cums at the feeling of his fellow crew groping his needy member, but he feels more cum fill instantly as they begin to play with his dick. Beards tickling it, hands groping it, lips kissing it, Nate is in bliss as his member grows and grows, reaching 9 inches long.<br />
<br />
Finally, a new scent hits Nates nose. Rugged, muscular, his new scent as a member of the crew. It sits at harmony with the other members stink, only being overpowered by the captains own rank smell. Nate lets go of the captains balls and raises his arms, crewmates pressing their noses into his pits and taking in his stink. With a grin, Nates bright orange beard grows, parts of it turning grey as he ages to fit the rest of his mates.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hes parts of tha crew, captain!&quot; You hear a pirate mutter, his words spaced between frantic pants as he presses against your shaft. &quot;Ar, is he then? Let&#39;s see ye all give him a warm welcome!&quot; In a moment, you feel your mates cum. First your back is painted in it as those appreciating your muscled and hairy back reach their limit. Then your chest as those playing with your abs reach their limit. Your feet are covered in the similar substance as those treating your dick and balls reach their limit, and your ass is painted white as the three pirates from earlier bury their treasure within you. Finally, Nate reaches his limit, his dick shoots its load into the mouth of one of the crew, and the captain quickly follows.  Filling Nates mouth and stomach with white treasure.<br />
<br />
The pirates step away, and Nate stands to admire his new form. The pudgy old man gone, all that remains is a middle aged man who could pass as a weightlifter. He flexes, and looks at the captain, his brain dimly reminding him that this man is his everything.</p>
