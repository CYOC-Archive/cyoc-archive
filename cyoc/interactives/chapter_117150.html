<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen soon realized that she had only one option &quot;I have to confront Miranda and your going to help me Kyle&quot;. &quot;What why&quot; he said in protest not wanting to be dragged into this more than he already has. &quot;Because whether you like it or not your apart of this now&quot; Jen replied. &quot;I suppose your right&quot; he said &quot;follow me Miranda lives in an abandoned warehouse not far from here&quot;. <br />
<br />
Kyle began to head towards the warehouse Jen following close behind completely forgetting her shoes and going bear foot. Wen they finally reached their destination it was already getting dark. Kyle then turned back to Jen and said &quot;before we continue there&#39;s something you need to know&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know how there isn&#39;t really any resent stories about the curse right&quot; Kyle asked. &quot;Yeah it&#39;s one of the mane reasons why people think the curse is bull shit&quot; She replied. &quot;Well it turns out that the curse was lifted twelve years ago&quot; he declared. &quot;In fact a few days ago I found a book in my moms attic which had information about demons and even the curse&quot; he added. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a weird thing to find in an attic&quot; Jen replied. &quot;I know right, and I still have no idea why my mom had something like that&quot; Kyle said. &quot;Anyway after you humiliated me I decided to get revenge on you by using the curse&quot; he said. &quot;But the ritual needed a female participant so I found the one person I knew would want to get revenge on you&quot;. &quot;wen it was all over I had the power of the curse but Miranda became possessed by the one who originally created it the demon Azilith&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god this is getting out of hand now a demon is involved in all this&quot; Jen said feeling over whelmed by what Kyle gust revealed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Jen this is all my fault I should never have restored the curse&quot; Kyle said. &quot;No it&#39;s my fault if I never picked on you none of this would have happened, but now we need to end this before any one else gets hurt&quot; she declared before they entered the warehouse. <br />
<br />
Soon after entering the building they herd a voice &quot;long time no see Jennifer, seeing as how Kyle is here I&#39;m guessing the spineless bastard is helping you now&quot;. Miranda then walked out of the shadows wearing nothing but a tattered black robe. Miranda was a tall young woman, with messy black hair, brown eyes, and pale skin. But what stood out the most was the fact that her body was covered in scars. Jen knew all to well that these scars were given to her by her father. <br />
<br />
&quot;Miranda trans...&quot; Was all Jen could get out before Miranda&#39;s eye began to glow red and she stretched out her hand somehow preventing her from saying anything else. &quot;Hehehe did you really think that would work&quot; Miranda said as she slowly walked up to Jen. &quot;You know Jennifer it turns out that me and Azilith have something in common&quot; she stated &quot;we both have a score to settle with your family&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean&quot; Jen said feeling her voice return. Suddenly Miranda began to change her eye turned red with black sclera, her skin turned a slight reddish color. Her nails then lengthened into claws as her ears became long and pointed. <br />
<br />
Suddenly she grabbed Jen by the throat and said &quot;your mother was the one who banished me to Hell&quot;. The voice Jen herd wasn&#39;t Miranda&#39;s, she assumed that this must be Azilith talking. But could what she said be true could her mom really have been the one who lifted the curse? <br />
<br />
&quot;And for twenty years I plotted my revenge&quot; Azilith continued &quot;but for now I think I&#39;m gonna have some fun with you two&quot;. &quot;first things first it&#39;s time I punish dear Kyle for betraying me&quot; She said with a evil grin. She then gently placed her hand on the back of Jen&#39;s neck before looking back at Kyle with glowing red eyes and said &quot;Kyle transform or dare&quot;. <br />
<br />
To Jen&#39;s horror she found that she was repeating her word for word. Before Kyle could give an answer Azilith preformed the same trick she used on Jen earlier. Preventing him from saying anything until the minute was up. &quot;Sorry Kyle but I couldn&#39;t let you choose your punishment now could I&quot; she said in a mocking tone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now how to punish you, oh I know&quot; she said looking at Jen. &quot;Since you to have been getting a long so well&quot; she began Jen once again repeating everything she said. &quot;first for your transformation you&#39;ll become a female version of your inner most demon&quot; she said. Tears began to stream down Jen&#39;s face as she was forced to repeat her. &quot;And for your dare you will bind yourself to Jennifer and become her servant from this point forward&quot; Azilith said. <br />
<br />
Jen found herself once again repeating what she said but to her surprise instead of saying &quot;Jennifer&quot; and &quot;her&quot; she said &quot;me&quot; and &quot;my&quot;. Satisfied by what she had done Azilith through Jen over to Kyle and took a seat on a nearby crate and prepared to watch the show. <br />
<br />
Soon Kyle began to feel the transformation wash over him as what little masculinity he had faded away. His hips grew wider and gained feminine curves throughout his body. He then felt his face change becoming rounder and more feminine as his hair lengthened reaching down to his elbows. <br />
<br />
Feeling his clothes getting titer he quickly stripped naked revealing a pair of growing breasts which swelled up to a D cup in size. Then Kyle felt the part he was dreading the most as his testicles began reseeding into his body. Jen couldn&#39;t help but feel a little aroused from watching Kyle taking the final steps into womanhood. Kyle was ashamed to admit that it felt good as his dick shrank leaving a fully formed vagina. <br />
<br />
Suddenly Kyle felt her transformation into a demon begin, to her surprise she actually grew taller. Her skin turned gray as mussels began to form making her stronger while still looking normal and not overly jacked. Her brown hair turned black while her eye turned yellow with slit pupils. Two large black horns emerged from the sides of her head before pointing straight up. Her ears grew longer and became pointed while her cain teeth grew into sharp fangs. <br />
<br />
Black markings began to spread across her upper body decorating her breasts and pussy in particular. Suddenly a massive tail grew completely covering her butt as her areoles and pussy turn black. The nails on her hands became sharp claws as black fur grew on the back of her hands and up to her elbows. <br />
<br />
A sharp bone like spike emerges from the tip of her tail while it became covered in black fur. The fur then spread up her back in a thin strip along her spine but leaving the underside of her tail as bear skin. And finally four spider like legs which were covered in black fur and had bone like spikes at the tips. Grew from the sides of her tail while her two existing legs changed to match the rest. <br />
<br />
While at first she thought the transformation was complete but a strange sensation in her clit said otherwise. Suddenly her clit swelled up becoming a large 12 inch dick with a pointed tip and three rib like structures gust below the head. After watching Kyle&#39;s transformation Jen could no longer control her lust as she striped naked and started masturbating. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god this is making me feel so horny&quot; Mirada said back in control and fingering her moist sex as well. Now compelled by the dare Kyle began to walk over to Jen, stumbling a little as she still wasn&#39;t quite used to her new legs. Following her new demonic instincts she uses a claw to cut herself and began to draw a strange symbol on Jen&#39;s stomach with her black blood. &quot;I hereby bind my soul to you and submit to your will and to do everything you desire of me&quot; she said. As if by instinct Jen spread her legs giving the young demon access to her moist pussy somehow knowing that they needed to consummate their bond through sex. &quot;Jen before we continue please call me Kira&quot; she asked before inserting her hard cock deep into Jen&#39;s wet cunt eliciting a soft moan from her. Kira began to fuck her hard and fast as they both began to approach their climax. &quot;ohhhh yes fuck me mmmm oh oh I&#39;m gonna CUUUM AHHHHHH&quot; Jen screamed as Kira released her black cum deep in to her womb completing their bond. As soon as Kira slid her dick out of Jen&#39;s pussy Jen began to feel strange. Almost as if there was some kind of energy building up inside her.</p>
