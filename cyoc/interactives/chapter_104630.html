<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your first thought is that you&#39;re dreaming, or you hallucinated the entire encounter with the green woman, or anything other than the immediate insane truth. But this isn&#39;t a dream, you know better. It feels too real.<br />
<br />
You have the power to travel through time at your fingertips.<br />
<br />
So, as people who are granted fantastical magical gifts tend to do, you start to wonder about doing something drastic. Maybe you should go back far into the past? See what things were like back then? But what&#39;s all the more tempting is seeing what a distant humanity looks like far, far into the future. You can see it now. Hover cars. Space elevators. Teleporters. Robots... They&#39;ve probably removed the need for a work force entirely, with all the automation that&#39;s going on around you.<br />
<br />
The future is probably a utopia, and damnit, now you have no choice but to see how things turned out.<br />
<br />
You close your eyes, think about a future a thousand years into the future, and<br />
*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br />
<br />
-you&#39;re suddenly-<br />
<br />
...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\~~~~~~...<br />
<br />
-not sure-<br />
<br />
...~~~~~~~~~\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br />
<br />
-if it&#39;s-<br />

<br />

<br />
...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\~...<br />
<br />
-idea.<br />
<br />
...~~~~\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*<br />
<br />
Your brain feels like it&#39;s been mashed in with a sledgehammer, your ability to think suddenly reduced to nil. Your eyes refuse to work for a moment, and you can&#39;t help but wonder if you&#39;ve gone blind. You take in deep breaths of air hungrily, your body apparently exhausted, but still getting pounded.<br />
<br />
Wait.<br />
<br />
Your ability to form a coherent thought slowly returns to you, but the deep pulsing sensation that you previously identified as pain was slowly morphing into something else. You&#39;re not blind, either, your eyes are simply ill adjusted to the darkened room you find yourself in. You try to make sense of it all, when you finally decipher the feelings you were engulfed in as you let out a shriek of joy.<br />
<br />
It was pleasure.<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t help but scream as you (apparently) climax, the feelings running through your body unlike anything you&#39;ve ever felt before. Another voice, indecipherable amongst your own sounds of ecstasy, does the same. Your body, having reached its limit, slumps down onto what you can tell are bedsheets.<br />
<br />
For a few moments, there&#39;s no sound, just pure silence as you try to recover from the ordeal. You try to think about what just happened. You went way, way into the future, and entered one of your descendants just as they finished...being fucked? Before the implications of this sink in, your attention is caught by movement on the bed. You turn to face your &#39;lover&#39;, and are shocked at what you see.<br />
<br />
The &quot;woman&quot; that you just had sex with was decidedly not human, or maybe she is, and humans have just turned out radically different. In many ways she was human, in general body shape, in curves, but in other ways she differed. For example, bright red skin? 4 arms? 4 breasts that, had just 2 of them been on a normal human woman, they would&#39;ve been utterly massive, but they worked for her because she was a staggering 10 feet tall. And they still looked big on her.<br />
<br />
You wonder if your eyes are playing tricks on you, though, when you see the giant cock hanging between her legs. But with a slowly dawning feeling of horror, you realize that it&#39;s no illusion. You just got pounded by a human...? Alien? Some kind of woman with a giant dick.<br />
<br />
And then you begin to have another realization, one even more startling than the fact that you just got pounded by alien dick. You&#39;re surprised you didn&#39;t notice it at first. Your long, blonde hair kept falling in front of your face, your shriek had sounded decidedly feminine. And, damn, you were definitely not getting fucked in the ass.<br />
<br />
Adjusting your body slightly, you use a petite hand to grab one of your huge boobs and find your worst fears confirmed.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re a woman.<br />
<br />
You had no time to do much about this revelation, however, as she suddenly gets out of bed and pulls some sort of smartphone-like device off of the bedside table. You watch as she taps the screen and, in a flash of light, she is suddenly dressed in form fitting clothes.<br />
<br />
The future is incredible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this was fun.&quot; she suddenly begins, and you&#39;re struck by how deep her voice is when you&#39;re suddenly hoisted out of bed by her strong, massive arms. She holds you, bridal style, as she opens up the bedroom door and walks out with you in her arms. &quot;But next time I actually expect my money. You can&#39;t pay off your rent with sexual favors forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh god. You can feel your face heating up as the realization of what has happened sinks in. Apparently you needed to pay your rent with sex just to get by.<br />
<br />
The future sucks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry...&quot; you mutter, and aren&#39;t completely surprised to find you have a womans voice; but you&#39;re not NOT surprised either. You look up at the red amazonian pitifully and she just laughs. &quot;What for? You and I have a great thing going. You &#39;help me out&#39; from time to time, and I don&#39;t put your sexy little ass on the streets.&quot; She gives you a wide, toothy grin, and you realize that her teeth are razor sharp. &quot;Just have some credits for me next week, okay? Hell, I&#39;ll even meet you halfway. If you give me half as many credits as your rent costs, I&#39;ll let you pay off the other half with another round.&quot;<br />
<br />
You have nothing to say about this.<br />
<br />
You haven&#39;t been paying attention to much as she carried you throughout the house, but just now you realize that she&#39;s reached the front door, which looked like something you&#39;d see in a movie. A big, metal panel that presumably would slide into the floor to let you out. Using 1 of her 4 arms, she hits a button on the keypad, and the door opens, leading out to a completely normal hallway in what looks to be a regular apartment complex.<br />
<br />
You don&#39;t expect her to dump you on the ground however.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow, what was that for?&quot; you groan, pushing yourself off the polished tile floor. &quot;See you in a week.&quot; is all she says, and suddenly the door shuts behind you. You shakily get to your feet, only to realize you&#39;re still naked. &quot;H-Hey!&quot; you yell, pounding on her door. &quot;Open up!&quot;<br />
<br />
For a full minute, nothing happens, and you feel a wave of terror flow through you as you hear footsteps from somewhere down a hall. You can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s getting closer or not, but you feel exposed. Thankfully, the buxom giant opens the door again, looking less than pleased to see you still here. &quot;What do you need?&quot;<br />
<br />
You&#39;re not sure. &quot;My things?&quot; you say meekly. Wordlessly, she shuts the door again, and when you were just about to wonder if she wasn&#39;t coming back the door opens again. She&#39;s holding a handheld device, like the one she&#39;d used to get dressed, in her lower right arm. &quot;Take it.&quot; she says sternly, and you wordlessly comply, barely pulling it through the door frame before it once again snaps shut, this time nearly cutting your hand off.<br />
<br />
Wasting no time, you try to turn the device on, only to find that it has no buttons to speak of. How the hell did this work? You touch the screen, and you&#39;re surprised to see the screen turns on. So it&#39;s touchscreen based. That&#39;s a minor victory atleast.<br />
<br />
Part of you wants to fool around with the strange phone of the future, but your first order of business is not being naked. Luckily, the screen it appears to already be on is apparently the &quot;wardrobe&quot; screen, with &quot;naked&quot; being the current option. You scroll through the other options in your wardrobe, pairs of clothes designed to appear on your body with the press of a button, and you don&#39;t like what you see.<br />
<br />
Everything is incredibly slutty.<br />
<br />
You settle on a jogging outfit, which is apparently the least sexualized piece of clothing you own, and tap it. There&#39;s a flash of white light, and you can see the outfit appearing bit-by-bit, your outfit nothing more than a wire frame before the &quot;textures&quot; load in, and you&#39;re clothed. You&#39;re relived to not be naked, but you realize that it&#39;s incredibly form fitting...your boobs (You still are in shock about that.) stick out like a sore thumb, and you can feel your leggings riding up your shapely ass.<br />
<br />
You need to get home, you think, but as you take a look around, you find yourself at a loss. You&#39;re in some sort of apartment complex, that&#39;s a given, but which one was yours?<br />
<br />
Suddenly, your phone lights up. You&#39;ve recieved a text message?<br />
&quot;ANONYMOUS-<br />
   The year is 3201<br />
   Your name is SARAH<br />
   You have NO JOB<br />
   Apartment Number is 2016&quot;.<br />
That&#39;s...convenient. But wait, what? Who is texting you your own information? Is it you from the future, or the pat? Or someone who knows you&#39;re a timetraveler who would be lost and confused at this very moment? <br />
<br />
You put the thought out of your head as you wander off in a random direction. This was apparently an apartment complex, but it was set up more like a hotel...a rather plain one at that. You expected the future to be full of flashy lights and technological feats, but you supposed that many old buildings were simply repurposed for the needs of tomorrow.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
It took half an hour, and you got a few catcalls (and some namecalling...apparently you had made a name for yourself around here), but you finally find your apartment door. You put a hand on the keypad, and are surprised to see it scan all 5 of your fingerprints before opening the door. You stumble inside, hit the pad behind you, closing the door and turning on the lights.<br />
<br />
You find yourself face to face with a beautiful woman in a jogging outfit or, more accurately, a mirror.<br />
<br />
You are a drop dead gorgeous woman, with breasts like that out of a poor photoshop job and an ass to match. Your lips were suitably plump, and your hair was silky smooth, draped around your shoulders. You were fit, at least, so the jogging outfit might not just be for show.<br />
<br />
What caught your eye the most, however, were your eyes. They were green.<br />
<br />
Just like your real eyes.<br />
<br />
You stumble past the mirror, into the main space, and fall onto the couch, your gut full of uncertainty. Your room looked much like it would&#39;ve in a shitty motel back in your time, with the exception of a few futuristic devices lying around that you didn&#39;t have it in you to mess with right now. Your window had the drapes and blinds closed, but bright light poured in anyway.<br />
<br />
You considered taking a look outside to see what the future was really like, but you were too spent to bother. The shittiness of your descendants living situation was overwhelming.<br />
<br />
You were Sarah, you had no job, and you have to fuck the landlord to make ends meet.<br />
<br />
The future is the worst.</p>
