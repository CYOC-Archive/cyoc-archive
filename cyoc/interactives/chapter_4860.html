<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Dare,&quot; Jennifer said.  The tone of her voice was one of expecting nothing out of the ordinary.  She didn't possibly think that Trish would say something weird.<br />
<br />
But the look on Trish's face told her plans.  It was a look the other three had never seen before.  It was lust.  Trish was turned on by this clearing, for whatever reason.  That was why she came here with Greg so often.  Her nipples had remained erect from the time the cool autumn air had touched them.  She was overcome with the strongest desire to be pleasured.  Plus, Jennifer had really gotten her angry when they were on the practice field.  This would be some small payback.  And she did always wonder what girl on girl sex would be like.  Why not with someone so beautiful, so ample, and so at her mercy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dare, huh?&quot; Trish repeated.  &quot;Well then Jenn, I dare you to come over here and fuck me as any two lesbians would.&quot;  Liz and Jamie were stunned.  But not quite as much as Jennifer was.  She found herself walking up to Trish.  She found her body irresistible.  Yet still there was a part of her that was horrified for what she was about to do.  Still, she had no choice.  She gave in to the curse, but also to her own temptation.<br />
<br />
Jennifer placed her hands on Trish's smooth face.  She knelt in and planted a firm, wet kiss on Trish's full, red lips.  Her hands ran over Trish's bare back, creeping their way slowly down to her firm ass.  Jennifer squeezed them in her hands and Trish let out a sound of approval.  Liz and Jamie were still standing in shock, watching this happen.  Two of their closest friends were about to make love to each other!  They found though that they could not turn away.  They were also strangely allured by the sight taking place in front of them.  Their own temptations danced through their minds.<br />
<br />
Jennifer then took Trish in her arms and laid her down upon the grass.  This was exactly how Trish wanted it.  She wanted to be fucked by Jennifer, and that is what Jennifer was going to do.  Jennifer laid her buxom figure down upon that of Trish.  Her massive breasts touched against Trish's smaller, but still very large mammaries.  The sensation of their nipples rubbing together brought forth moans of delight from both girls.  Jennifer looked longingly into at Trish's tits and knew she must have them.  She slid down Trish's body until her head reached Trish's tits.  Her tongue began to explore the areolas of both breasts, making the nipples even more erect than they could have ever become.  Jennifer now began to suck on them, hoping to see if there was any milk contained within them.  Trish was in heaven.  Greg never seemed too interested in pleasing her in this way.  Now she was getting all the attention she'd ever wanted.<br />
<br />
As Jennifer continued to suck on Trish's breasts, Liz and Jamie found themselves becoming more and more turned on.  Liz tried to resist it all she could.  After all, she was committed to her boyfriend.  Jamie had no such committments to think about.  She was standing slightly behind Liz, but not found herself beginning to creep closer, as she debated in her mind whether to act upon her inhibitions or resist them as much as she could.<br />
<br />
Jennifer finally finished sucking.  The moans coming out of Trish's mouth had become too much for her.  She could tell that Trish was ready to be climaxed.  She now slid further down Trish's body, where she had been slowly spreading her legs.  They were now in the position of begging to be pushed fully apart so that her pussy could be touched.  Jennifer was happy to oblige.  She took her fingers and searched for the opening.  Trish reached down with her own hand, grabbed Jennifer's hand, and guided them to where they needed to go.  Together they found the opening of Trish's womanhood.  Jennifer teased at first slowly inserting them, only to take the out again quickly.  The moans that Trish was producing were unmistakable.  They begged to be silenced, they demanded satisfaction.  Jennifer began to go deeper.  Trish's moans grew louder.<br />
<br />
By this time Jamie had gotten so close to Liz that Liz could literally feel Jamie breathing down her neck.  She lost control and quickly spun around to face her friend.  &quot;You won't tell Dylan, will you?&quot; she asked.  Jamie giggled and answered, &quot;Now why would I do something silly like that?&quot;  Liz smiled and took a hold of her friend's ass, bending her down to the ground much the same way Jennifer had done to Trish.  She pounced on Jamie's body, hoping to fill her friend's desires quickly enough so that hers might be filled as well.  <br />
<br />
Trish lifted her head slightly off the ground and saw what her two friends were doing.  She managed to laugh out loud through her moans, as she realized the addictive powers of this clearing and of her dare.  She wasn't satisfied just yet though.  She lifted Jennifer up from her exploring and begged, &quot;Tongue.  Use your tongue.  Pllleassse.&quot;  Since Jennifer was still under the power of the dare, please wasn't necessary.  She buried her head in Trish's crotch and inserted her tongue into Trish's already wet pussy.  It took only a matter of seconds of her exploring for Trish to come with the greatest orgasm she had ever experienced.  Jennifer, tired from all her work, collapsed on the ground next to her friend.  Trish wanted to return the favor, even though her dare gave her no reason too, but she was just too exhausted.  Some other time, she thought.<br />
<br />
This gave time for Liz and Jamie to finish their own escapades.  It took only a matter of minutes for each to explode with orgasms of their own.  They too were both exhausted beyond belief.<br />
<br />
Finally, after what seemed like hours, but was only actually 30 minutes, all four friends were ready to continue with the problem of the curse.  They sat up in a small circle.  &quot;OK,&quot; Trish said, still panting for air, &quot;Who's next?&quot;  &quot;I'll go,&quot; said Jamie.  She turned to Jennifer and said, &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;</p>
