<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam stood there in the moonlight looking at the three wolves.  He scratched at his heavy stubble and fiddled with his jet-black moustache as he considered the wolves.  They were beautiful, they moved with power and grace and he had such an urge to mount the female.  His erection was growing as he tried to chase the image of pushing his throbbing cock into her out of his mind.  He was sweating profusely, he didn’t know why.  Perhaps it was that he was so sexually excited.  Sam was emitting pheromones of his own, soaking his clothing in his own scent.<br />
<br />
The two males and the female’s noses twitched as they sniffed the air.  The female began to move toward Sam and sniffed at him, the males also moved toward him and sniffed.<br />
<br />
The russet male said, “You’re… you’re an alpha.  Why did we not sense this before?” he said, turning to the other male.<br />
<br />
Sam knew ‘alpha’ meant leader, but these two must be mistaken; he wasn’t a leader.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps it is the confusion of all the other scents on this one.  He is covered in so many scents, it is difficult to tell which was his, he smells of at least three or four others of his kind.”  The white wolf said.<br />
<br />
“May we touch you?”  The female said to Sam.<br />
<br />
Sam was in no frame of mind to refuse, but he wanted to know what they had planned.  “How are you going to touch me?”  Sam asked.<br />
<br />
“We want to touch your… your… I think you call it a u-ni-form.  The fur you can shed and wear again.  We’d like to take in its scents, we learn much by scent.”  The female said.<br />
<br />
Sam’s erection throbbed painfully at the thought of those paws on his person.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… sure.”  Sam said hesitantly.<br />
<br />
With permission, the wolves began sniffing all over his body.  The males inspected his uniform.  Sam had no idea that they were imprinting themselves on him.  They were rubbing their paws and noses all over him because they were familiarizing themselves with his scent, drinking in the fresh odor of his sweat.  They had accepted Sam as their alpha and now they were marking him with their scent so that others would know how many stood with him.  The russet wolf rubbed his inner thigh against Sam’s outer leg, but Sam was far too distracted to notice.  The russet wolf sniffed Sam’s ass and goosed him slightly.  The female was concentrating on Sam’s loins and rubbed her face against his groin.  It was all Sam’s cock could take; Sam shot two thick loads in his boxers.  At this, the female began to whimper.<br />
<br />
“Please, mate with me.”  She said, looking up into Sam’s eyes.  Sam looked into her golden eyes and something inside of his mind screamed, “No!” even though his loins urged him to do as the excited organs wished.<br />
<br />
Sam, without thinking about it said, “Stop.”  It was in a deeper, stronger voice than he thought possible and one he hadn’t intended to use.<br />
<br />
The three ceased immediately.<br />
<br />
“Have we broken the rules?  Have we displeased you?”  The white wolf said in a sort of a submissive whine.  The wolf’s head was bowed, his eyes did not look into Sam’s and his tail was tucked between his legs.<br />
<br />
Sam noticed the posture was the same for the other two; they were submitting and something in Sam liked that.  It made his cock jump.  Power was an aphrodisiac, after all.<br />
<br />
“No, you have not displeased me and you haven’t broken the rules.”  Sam said this in a voice that sounded… authoritative he thought.  He reminded himself of his own father when Sam was a boy.  His dad would have enough of Sam’s nonsense and tell him to stop in the same firm, unwavering way and Sam would do just as these wolves had; he would submit to his father’s will and do exactly as he was told.<br />
<br />
“I… I just need some time to think.  I want you to go back over there, in the clearing where I found you.  I’m going to scout around a bit, but I will be back shortly.  If I come back with others, remain silent.  Do not speak.  They might be frightened of you, so remain submissive.”  Sam gave the order naturally.<br />
<br />
“We shall do as you say and await your return; we respect the rules.”  The russet wolf said, still not looking Sam in the eye.  The three turned and moved back into the dense woods.<br />
<br />
Sam was oozing pre come now, the thrill of leadership was making him horny.<br />
<br />
Sam didn’t exactly know what he was going to do, but what he had just said sounded good.  It would hide the wolves while he thought about what to do with them.  He didn’t want to tag them; he didn’t want to turn them over to the lab.  He didn’t want anyone to discover them.  He wanted to protect them, to get them out of here, to see that they would survive.  <br />
<br />
Sam didn’t realize what was happening to him.  He didn’t realize that he’d just taken on the responsibility of leading the wolves.  He didn’t realize that he was mentally becoming their alpha male and if he had allowed the encounter to continue, he would have become their alpha male in body as well.<br />
<br />
The wet spot in Sam’s boxers was clinging coldly to his cock and yet he remained as hard as when he was with the wolves.  Sam sniffed at the sleeve of his uniform, he smelled like he’d been roughhousing with his mastiff Barney.  He became slightly, blissfully dizzy as he breathed in the scent.  He needed to find a couple of the others and tell them that his section was clear; they wouldn’t search his area for animorphs again until dawn if he did.<br />
<br />
Sam’s radio check was coming up in a minute.<br />
<br />
He checked in, reported that he found nothing.  He offered that the animals had either moved out of his area or were in hiding.  He was then ordered to return to base camp for assignment to another section and he signed off.<br />
<br />
It was the first time he’d ever told a lie to a superior, which meant that usually he was an inept liar.  This time was different, it came off natural, just like the truth.  He didn’t like lying, but if lying could protect those wolves, he’d lie again.<br />
<br />
On the way back to camp, about a mile and a half from where the wolves were, he met up with Jim Hicks and Rich Weston.  Jim and Rich were closer friends to Sam than the rest of the team, they were buddies; they were friends outside of work.  They always had a the big bowl game parties together and they hung out at “Hawg’s Wallow” a biker bar where the three of them went to shoot pool.<br />
<br />
Rich was big, curly headed; blond and blue eyed with a bushy blond beard.  Jim was short, stout, stocky and clean-shaven with ash brown hair and hazel eyes.<br />
<br />
The three of them stopped, reported back to camp that they were taking a fifteen-minute break and sat and discussed the hunt.<br />
<br />
“I saw a squirrel-man and chased after him.  I shot at him, but I didn’t get him.”  Jim said and drew on his cigarette.  “Base camp confirmed that the tracer was stationary, which meant that I hit a tree.  I chased him a good ways and lost him.  He moved like lightning and even in the moonlight, with these night vision glasses, I couldn’t find him.  I think this is gonna be a Hell of a lot harder than the big boys at the lab anticipated.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I actually dotted a weasel like creature.  I think it was a weasel or a fisher or something like that.  I dunno, that group of mammals look a lot alike, especially in the dark.”  Rich said and lit up a cigarette himself, he offered Sam one but Sam declined.  Sam was trying to quit.  “Oh, sorry, I forgot.”  Rich said a bit sheepishly.<br />
 <br />
“So, what happened out there with you?”  Rich said to Sam.  “You smell like that miniature horse you keep.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, Barney is gonna be jealous if he suspects you’ve been seeing other dogs on the side.”  Jim said teasingly.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I guess someone’s pet golden Labrador got loose or something.  He had tags that read ‘Charlie’ with a phone number.  He was all over me, I guess he was lost.  I petted him, he heard something and he took off into the woods, barking after whatever it was. ” Sam lied.  <br />
<br />
“It’s never been easy for me to lie before now, what the Hell is happening to me?”  Sam thought.<br />
<br />
“Sam!  You were supposed to tag him.”  Rich said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, shit!  You’re right.  There’s gonna be Hell to pay if I don’t find that damned dog and dart him.”  Sam said with mock concern that came off just right.  <br />
<br />
“Damn!  They’re eatin’ this up!”  Sam thought as he saw the concern cross Richs’ face.<br />
<br />
“It’s OK, here in a minute we’ll radio back to base that we’ve just encountered some animorphs and are in pursuit.  We’ll help you find the dog, OK?”  Jim said as he snuffed out the cigarette on a rock.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, we’re your friends, can’t let you get chewed out because you’re a dog lover and it slipped your mind.  I mean, you’re so used to dogs that you probably don’t even think of them as animals.  It would have been like darting Barney.  Don’t worry: between the three of us, we’ll get him.”  Rich said and smiled.  <br />
<br />
Rich put his cigarette out and called back to base camp with the report that he, Sam and Jim had just spotted something moving through the trees and were going to pursue it.<br />
<br />
With that, they were off, Sam leading them back to the place where he’d left the wolves.  Sam was up wind of the other two and they made jokes about not having to use the night vision gear because they could follow Sam with their noses.  Sam also didn’t see his buddies adjusting their shorts because of the uncomfortable erections they were both beginning to sport.  Both of them were starting to get turned on and tried to keep their minds on something else other than sex, which was pretty damn hard considering that they were both horny fuckers even without the benefit of the pheromones they were breathing in from Sam’s uniform.<br />
<br />
By the time they reached the outskirts of the clearing where Sam had left the wolves, Jim and Rich were just about ready to come in their pants.<br />
<br />
Jim was the first to catch site of the white wolf, pacing back and forth.  He raised his dart gun and Sam motioned him not to.  The three of them were very close to each other and Jim and Rich had, had a huge dose of the wolf pheromones from Sam’s uniform.  The other two had begun to obey Sam as if he were in command instead of being an equal.<br />
<br />
“Wait.”  Sam whispered.  “What if there are more?”<br />
<br />
Unconsciously, Rich was rubbing his crotch.  The big man was inexplicably horny and needed release.  He caught himself doing it and stopped.  Neither of the other two had seen him, so it saved him the embarrassment.<br />
<br />
None of the three of them were thinking very clearly by now.  Sam could smell the female.  His crotch ached and he was oozing out what felt like pints of pre-cum.  His entire crotch was wet.<br />
<br />
They saw the other two wolves come out of the woods and into the clearing.  The russet followed the grey female.<br />
<br />
“Oh, God!”  Rich whispered in awe.  “They look just like werewolves!  They’re so… beautiful.”<br />
<br />
Jim’s mouth hung open.  “They’re incredible!  Look how they move, they’re so graceful.”  He whispered.<br />
<br />
Sam had hoped his buddies would feel this way toward what he was beginning to unconsciously regard as his ‘family’.<br />
<br />
“Why don’t we to and talk to them, perhaps we can get them to follow us back to camp?”  Sam said and he was sincere, at least in part.  The other part of him felt that Jim and Rich, having expressed some admiration for the wolves, would maybe see that these animorphs should be left alone.  Sam was sure if Rich and Jim met them; his buddies would feel as he did about them and would want to protect them.<br />
<br />
“Follow me and don’t raise your weapons.”  Sam said.<br />
<br />
Rich and Jim, their thoughts somewhat foggy, followed Sam in an almost dreamlike state.  It was so unreal, these ‘were-wolves’ didn’t snarl or attack like in the movies.<br />
<br />
The three men walked into the clearing.  Sam approached the female, laid hid dart gun down and gently began to pet her about the face and shoulders.  Before he knew it, Sam was fondling the female’s breasts.  <br />
<br />
Jim and Rich, observing this, dimly thought that it was wrong that they needed to stop it, but each hesitated, they didn’t remember why they had to stop it.  They hesitated just long enough so that the thought vanished in their minds and their attention was drawn to the other wolves.  Both of the men could see the attraction; the wolf animorphs were beautiful, agile, powerful and so… so… sexy.  <br />
<br />
The two males approached Jim and Rich respectively, and Jim called out to Sam asking, “What should we do?”<br />
<br />
Sam answered dreamily, as he began to explore the female’s vagina with his fingers, “They seem friendly enough, lay the guns down and pet them like you would a Barney.”  <br />
<br />
Sam raised his hands to his face and rubbed the female’s secretions with its heady scent into his thick black moustache and stubble.  He wanted to bury his nose and mouth in her moist opening and soak his moustache in her juices.  He visualized the thick liquids matting his black moustache, as he’d done with many women before, and he noticed he was salivating in excess.  Sam wanted to mate and the scent of the she-wolf’s sex was driving him wild.  Having it rubbed on his face made him wild.  He was burning with desire and his tongue cleaned her juices out of his moustache.  She tasted so good!  He licked his fingers clean.  He would call her Jessica.  Yes, Jessica, he liked the sound of that name.  Jessica Huggevik… He laughed to himself; wolves didn’t need last names, their scent told everyone with a nose who they were and who their pack mates were.  Sam was beginning to understand the language of scent.<br />
<br />
He kneeled before the grey furred beauty and began licking her moist opening.  He found that she had developed a vaginal opening much like that of a human female, though there were subtle differences.  He pushed his tongue into the hole and the female moaned in pleasure.  Sam was very skilled in oral sex.  He’d always been quite able to satisfy his women with his mouth and his moustache and then with his cock.  He buried his face in her opening and soaked his moustache in her tasty nectar, tickling her with his moustache as he did so.<br />
<br />
The wolf moaned and whimpered softly.  She looked down into his blue eyes and said in husk whisper, “No wolf has ever done that as well as you have.”<br />
<br />
Sam grinned as he pulled away from her, “Wolves don’t study female anatomy or experiment to learn how to give oral pleasure, humans do!”  <br />
<br />
The wolf moaned in a most human way and said, “What a wonderful mate I have found, you are so confident and attentive.”  She shivered as Sam ran his tongue up in her vagina.  “I knew you were the one when I caught your scent.  You are strong, young and healthy; you will be a good sire for our young.”  <br />
<br />
“Yes, that is so right.”  Sam thought, “I’ll be a father and a mate.  I’ll protect my pack against anything… anything” Sam was then completely preoccupied with giving his mate the best oral sex he had ever performed.  The she wolf leaned into his mouth and ground her pelvis into Sam’s face.  Sam’s arms hugged her crotch to his face and he began to stimulate the base of her tail, massaging it, kneading it.  Then he withdrew some so that he could to rub her clitoris with his thick thumbs and lick at her labia.  His face was wet with her juices and he licked as much as he could out of his moustache and off his chin.  His moistened fingers began to search for a ‘G spot’, he was hoping that as a hybrid, Jessica would have one.  Sam found that she did indeed have a ‘G spot’, though it was a litter further inside of her than it would be with a human.<br />
<br />
Jim and Rich were now both petting the males, they were breathing in the pheromones and their groins were soaked in their seminal fluids.  Neither of the men had ever considered sex with another man, let alone a wolf-man, but the thought was beginning to creep into their foggy minds as they stroked the soft fur and the thought wasn’t being rejected.<br />
<br />
Rich looked down at the huge stiff wolf cock the white wolf was sporting as he petted the wolf’s head, face and patted his chest.  The wolf’s hands were exploring Richs’ belly and he was panting slightly.  He seemed to truly enjoy touching Rich and Rich touching him.  As Rich moved closer to the cock, rubbing the wolf-man’s belly, the wolf softly whined.  <br />
<br />
“Good fella, you’re a big boy aren’t cha?” Rich said soothingly as he looked at the oozing wolf cock.  He didn’t know what to say, so he spoke in the same way he would speak to a dog; soothingly and calmly.  His own cock was reacting to what he was seeing. The wolf reached out with his long tongue and licked Richs’ bushy moustache, nose and lips.  Rich kissed the wolf on the muzzle and the wolf responded by opening his mouth.  Rich took the opportunity and deep kissed the wolf.  It was so strange, he knew he should be repulsed and horrified by what was happening, this was bestiality, homosexuality, but it just seemed like what he wanted more than anything in the world at this moment.<br />
<br />
Without thinking about it, he took the wolf’s cock into his hands.  He began to pump the cock and the wolf moved his body against Richs’.  Rich looked down again, he wanted to suck that huge cock.  Somewhere in the back of his mind the warning sounded again, but Rich ignored it; Rich dropped to his knees and began nuzzling the wolf’s balls and cock, rubbing the furry groin into his curly blond beard; filling his beard with the wolf’s scent.<br />
<br />
The scent was incredible; the burly ex-marine pushed his nose into the wolf’s groin and began deeply breathing in the rich canine scent, almost hyperventilating as he did so.  His head was spinning with the excess oxygen and the smell of the beast.  He gently began to nibble at the wolf’s balls and the wolf whimpered his need.  Rich slowly moved up the huge shaft caressing it with his thick moustache as he moved toward the bulbous head, his tongue darted out and tested the wolf’s pre-come when he reached his goal; in that moment, Rich committed himself.  No voice screaming in the back of his head that he was ‘being a fag’ or that ‘fucking an animal was wrong’ would distract him anymore.  He gagged only slightly as he began to take the cock down his huge throat to pleasure the whimpering wolf.<br />
<br />
While Rich was beginning to explore the white wolf, succumbing to its scent, Jim had begun to explore the russet.  Jim too noticed that this wolf had an erect penis and Jim was fascinated by it.  The russet wolf licked Jim’s face and soon, Jim’s arms were wrapped around the stout, muscular russet and he was French kissing the wolf, just as Rich was doing at this moment.  The screaming voice of reason was a far distant cry as he tongue-wrestled with the wolf.  Jim was rubbing the animal’s organ against his own stiff member and the wolf whimpered into his mouth at Jim’s dry humping.  Jim knew they both needed release and soon.  Jim began to take off his clothing.  Time seemed to stand still, though he knew that minutes were flying by.  It was like one of those dreams where you’re caught in something and no matter how hard you struggle, you can’t get away.  Time moves quickly, but it seems slow to you.  A glance over at Sam and Jim saw that he was already naked from the waste down; he’d even gotten out of his boots and was working on his jacket as the female reached around and rubbed his hairy ass.<br />
<br />
Another glance, at his huge buddy Rich, showed him to be almost completely naked, the wolf was helping Rich rip his t-shirt off and Rich was just now being mounted by the huge white wolf man.<br />
<br />
The voice in Jim’s mind screamed, ‘No’ but his balls and ass cried out, “Yes!”<br />
<br />
Jim wanted to be mounted, just like Rich, he stooped to remove his boots.  When they were off, he began to tear off the rest of his clothes as fast as he could. <br />
<br />
As Jim was removing the last of his clothes, he heard Rich cry out.  The white wolf had just penetrated Rich.  Jim got down onto his hands and knees in the doggy position, watching the white wolf forcing his huge cock into Richs’ ass.  There was a strangled grunt as the wolf sunk himself all the way to the hilt into Rich.  Richs’ breathing was ragged and Jim could see the wolf sink his fangs into Richs’ hairy shoulder in the moonlight.  The wolf rubbed Richs’ hairy back as he began to hump the big man, but the muzzle remained clamped into Richs’ shoulder.  Blood dribbled down Richs’ hairy left shoulder and arm.  Rich had cried out in pain as the wolf bit into him, but Jim could tell that Rich seemed to welcome the bite.  Jim had simultaneously heard the splash of Richs’ come on the ground as the big man had cried out.  Jim also saw Rich spurting out thick loads as he moaned in a mixture of pain and pleasure.  It became clear to Jim, now as he witnessed Rich having sex, why his buddy had periodically talked about leather and chains when the subject of sex came up.  Rich had desired such rough sex, but had never done anything about it.  He guessed that Rich was finally able to fulfill his secret desire with a new mate.<br />
<br />
Inside of Richs’ ass, the white wolf’s knot began to expand and Rich began to feel something the size of a tennis ball growing in his guts.  The pain was so exquisite and gave him such pleasure.  The knot rubbed against Richs’ prostate gland and he shivered in sheer pleasure.  <br />
<br />
Rich had achieved a state of ‘Zen’.  His body was being bombarded by so many sensations that his mind became free to think.  Rich knew he would become a wolf and his heart rejoiced.  Rich knew also that Sam was his leader now, because Sam smelled like an alpha and Sam was beginning to act like an alpha.  That was fine with Rich, Sam was a good friend.  Sam had lead him to this place and showed him the bliss of sex with these beautiful creatures.  Surely, Sam had known and Sam wanted to include his friends in such a wonderful transformation.  Sam was a natural leader and deserved Richs’ respect and obedience.  Rich felt the warmth in his guts spreading and it gave him pleasant shivers up and down his spine that ran across the surface of his hairy skin; the skin that would soon be engulfed in a wolf’s pelt.<br />
<br />
The russet was prodding Jim’s ass and Jim obediently spread his legs to give his mate easier access at a slight growl from the wolf.  The voice that had been screaming warnings in Jim’s head was muffled and almost mute now.  Soon Jim felt the cock-head push into him and he groaned as the wolf’s knot was pushed past his sphincter muscles.  <br />
<br />
“This is it,” Jim thought, his balls felt like they were going to explode, “I’m his mate now.”  At that thought, the thought of being mated to this incredible animal, Jim felt a deep longing and desire fulfilled.  Divorced at least three times because he simply couldn’t make a relationship work, Jim would now be happy, bound tightly in the mating bonds to his furry lover.  Alpha wolves mated for life and the betas were like a harem for the pair.<br />
<br />
The wolf clamped his jaws around Jim’s neck and Jim began to feel the russet’s knot expand.  The engorged knot rubbed against his prostate and Jim went into orgasm just as his bearded buddy had when the wolf had bitten into his shoulder.  <br />
<br />
Jim was dimly aware of Sam fucking the female.  He heard her whimpering moans of orgasm and Sam’s thrusting grunts as his leader came closer to climax.  Wait, no, Sam wasn’t his leader.  Jim was confused for a moment, then he was sure.  He’d been right the first time, Sam was his leader and he’d follow him without question.<br />
<br />
Jim looked over at Rich in the moonlight.  It seemed Rich was enjoying being fucked as much as he was.  Rich looked over at Jim, their eyes met.  Both men realized the glazed look in the other’s eyes was primal pleasure.  <br />
<br />
Rich grinned toothlessly at Jim from ear to ear, “Looks like we’ve found what we were sent to look for, eh buddy?”<br />
<br />
Jim grinned back, just as toothless, and grunted out the words as his russet mate pounded his ass, “Oh…Hell… yeah.” Jim responded between thrusts.  Jim wondered what it would be like to be fucked by Rich when Rich became a wolf-man.  He was beginning to find his buddy of ten years more and more attractive.  They had shared so much over the years, now they could share their furry bodies with each other.<br />
<br />
Soon, the three men began to itch as new fur sprouted from their mostly naked skin.  Thin, hairless tails began to sprout from the bases of their spines and as they elongated, fur began to cover the naked tails.  They itched and scratched and moaned as the tingling in their balls made them more desperate for sex.  Their partners helped them ease the itching by scratching the places they couldn’t reach and helped them ease their sexual needs as well.<br />
<br />
Within a half an hour, three new male wolf-men were lying with their mates on the moist soil of the forest floor; still in the throes of passion.<br />
<br />
Rich was the largest wolf-man probably yet created.  He was at least eight feet tall and incredibly brawny, even for an animorph wolf.  Muscles rippled under his golden fur, he was truly beautiful.  His golden fur gleamed in the moonlight as he mounted and roughly fucked his smaller silver furred lover.  He bit into the white wolf’s shoulder with new gleaming white fangs.<br />
<br />
Jim was now a grey wolf the same colors as the female and he was moaning happily because he was getting the blowjob of his life from his russet mate.<br />
<br />
Sam’s thick, bushy moustache had disappeared, as Richs’ beard and moustache had for him, into the fur of his new muzzle.  Sam was a midnight black wolf and he was still busily breeding with his grey mate.  Sam would have puppies with his mate, but he was introducing Jessica to the concept of sex for pleasure itself.  Sam was the alpha male and he would gently assert his authority over Rich and Jim after he had finished mating with Jessica.  He would make Rich and Jim both submit to him and order them to position themselves for fucking.  It had to be done, his new wolfish mind reasoned, but it didn’t have to be cruel or unpleasant.  <br />
<br />
The white and russet wolves had already accepted him, but he would probably fuck them too.  A leader must assert his authority and remind his subordinates of that authority from time to time.  He would be passionate with all of them and let them know that he would always take care of them.  Soon, it would be time to consolidate his power and lead his pack away from this place.  <br />
<br />
Sam Huggevik, the wolf-man, knew there was danger waiting for them all now, he could smell it in the uniforms they had shed.  Sam would take what was useful from those uniforms and bury the rest.  He’d smash the radios before he did so, just so that triangulation would be impossible.  Teams would be searching for them; he had to get away, he had to get them all away from here.  He was their leader and they looked to him for direction.  Sam felt both fear and a sense of fulfillment with that thought; after all, he’d never been a leader, both feelings were to be expected from a new leader.</p>
