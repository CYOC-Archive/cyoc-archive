<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul woke with a start as something heavy slammed onto his chest.  He lifted his head to see what it was, and <br />
found himself staring into the gaping hole a melon-sized cockhead resting on his pecs.  &quot;Holy shit,&quot; he <br />
whispered, tentatively moving an arm towards the unfamiliar beast, &quot;did that wish come true?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; said a gruff voice, and for the first time Paul looked past the giant cock to see the midget straddling <br />
his chest it was attached to.  Paul shrieked in surprise and started squirming backwards.  &quot;Calm down, I'm not <br />
going to hurt you.&quot;  Paul cautiously pushed himself into a sitting position, his back against the wall, his <br />
legs splayed out on either side of the midget's giant cock.<br />
<br />
He took a moment to survey the bedroom intruder.  He was between three and four feet tall, more of it in his <br />
torso than his legs.  Totally nude, as was Paul.  Covered in dark body hair, and his face looked like a cross <br />
between a mule and a pile of mule shit.  His most striking feature, of course, was the nearly-two-foot-long <br />
thick-as-a-coffee-can penis, whose head was now poised somewhat intimidatingly in front of Paul's modest <br />
genitals.  The midget was erect.  So, for some reason, was Paul.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now as I was saying,&quot; said the midget, &quot;No, your wish has not yet come true.  But that's what I'm here to <br />
talk about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come now, do you really have to ask?&quot;  Paul really did have to ask.  &quot;Mortals these days... I'm the god <br />
Priapus.&quot;  Paul had a vague recollection of that.  Something about an erection lasting more than two hours?  <br />
In any case, Priapus' godly qualities were apparent now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now as I was saying... hey, pretty boy, I'm up here!&quot; Paul hadn't realized that he'd been staring at the <br />
monster in his lap.  He looked up.  &quot;That's better.  Now then, you wished to, quote, have the kind of cock Liz <br />
wanted end-quote, correct?&quot;  Paul nodded, still trying to wrap his head around any of what was going on.  If <br />
this really was a Greek god, why the hell was he in Paul's bedroom?  &quot;Well, I'm here to explain to you why <br />
that's the wrong wish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, why just Liz?  What if things don't work out between you two?  You wouldn't want to be stuck <br />
with the perfect cock for a woman you're not with, would you?&quot;  Paul frowned, and shook his head.  &quot;Right, so <br />
what you really want is for your cock to always be what your current partner wants, whoever they may be, got <br />
it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I guess that makes sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, that was the main thing I wanted to correct.  The rest is relatively small matters.  One of which is <br />
proportion.  Observe.  This...&quot; he hefted his two softball-sized testicles, which quickly shrank down to the <br />
size of cherries in his hand, looking rather like Paul's own balls. &quot;... looks silly.  If you show up with a <br />
perfect cock and those teeny balls you'll be laughed out of the boudoir.&quot;  He dropped his small balls, which <br />
swelled back up to their former voluminous size as they fell.  &quot;You'll want the wish to affect your balls <br />
too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.  Actually,&quot; Paul was starting to mentally catch up, &quot;while we're at it why not my whole body?&quot;  Paul <br />
looked down at his belly, which wasn't fat, but was no six-pack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, not my area.  I work strictly below the sash and above the knees.  Now then, one more thing.  What <br />
would happen if Liz pulled down your pants to discover a cock like this?&quot;  Priapus thrust his cock forward, <br />
and at first Paul thought he was just indicating it, but then Priapus's cock rubbed against Paul's much <br />
smaller member, and in a blink it wasn't so much smaller any more.  Its head was now bobbing around just below <br />
his pecs.  Paul stared at it awestruck, and slowly began moving his parted lips towards it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cronus damnit, I've got to learn to stop being so dramatic.  She'd freak out, that's what!&quot;  Paul stopped <br />
with his tongue mere inches from his glistening slit, struck by the emotion of the other's voice and, now that <br />
Paul thought about it, the truth of his words.  &quot;She'd insist you see a doctor right away, and then the doctor <br />
would probably sell you off to pharmaceutical company as a lab rat, to see what makes your magic cock tick.&quot;  <br />
Paul slumped back, swayed by the terrible scenario just laid out.  &quot;But don't worry, I can help with that too, <br />
as long as you see why it's important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then, I think that's all straightened out, and I have places to be, so if you will please repeat after <br />
me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish my *genitalia* were always my *current partner's* fantasy, but that no one but me would think that <br />
abnormal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul repeated the wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I almost forgot,&quot; the god replied, &quot;I may be a god of fertility in part, but I'm more a god of sex, and I <br />
know the former can impede upon the latter.  So everyone I work with I always ensure that they won't get <br />
anyone pregnant unless they intend to.  And as long as you aren't using a condom for that, I'll also make your <br />
junk perpetually hale and healthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, than-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to thank me boy, just doing my job.  Alright then, you're all set.  Have fun!&quot;  With that, reached <br />
down and pinched Paul's foot.<br />
<br />
Paul woke with a start.  He was lying down again, and alone.  He reached down to his crotch to see if he still <br />
had the huge cock he'd dreamed of, but felt just his same old familiar Paulie.  Worse, it was covered slimy-<br />
sticky.  That bizarre dream with the midget had been a wet dream.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I just got laid&quot; Paul thought.  He shook his head and let out a little sigh, confused at what strange <br />
things his mind was up to.</p>
