<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob was so caught up in the fun that he and Rick were having that he barely even noticed being cleaned by James, though he did squeak in surprise and blush a bit when the man gently scrubbed his tiny stub of a penis. Rick, not fazed by any aspect of his own head to toe scrubbing, engaged Jacob in a dinosaur battle through the whole thing, one that was abruptly cut short when James dumped a bucket of water on each baby&#39;s head. Jacob and Rick sputtered and giggled, giggles that turned into sighs and coos when James started to tenderly rub lavender-scented baby shampoo into the soft hair plastered to their adorable little heads. The plug was plucked from the drain right after their scalps were rinsed, drawing whines and protests from the toddlers that James merely chuckled over.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, c&#39;mon,&quot; he grinned as he plucked their tiny, naked, dripping-wet bodies from the tub and set them on the bathmat. &quot;Gotta leave some time for a movie before beddy bye, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
This proved to be effective enough reasoning to silence the toddlers, though the argument was assisted by how wonderful it felt to be wrapped up in the big warm dinosaur towel James pulled out to make sure both boys were nice and dry. James, finally comfortable in his nudity, merely pushed his thumb between his lips and sucked in utter contentment, an act that was copied by Rick as they were both gently laid on their backs. The two babies suck suck sucked away as James got them into their beautifully thick and soft nighttime diapers, Jacob and Rick beaming at each other around their thumbs at the thought that they got to experience something so lovely together. Then they were back on their feet - Jacob needing a moment to re-balance himself thanks to the utter thickness of his new Pampers - and helped into matching onesie jammies, simple baby blue garments featuring crotch snaps and the softest fabric Jacob had ever touched. It was a little thing, but the toddler loved how he could look behind him and see his diaper poofing out from the seat of his jammies. Everybody could tell how much of a baby he was. <br />
<br />
James had just led his waddling, thumbsucking little boys into the living room when a knock came at the door. He frowned down at the toddlers, who frowned back and watched with curiosity and concern as James let go of their hands to answer it. Standing on the porch were two boys of about seven, one wearing a two-piece set of Iron Man pajamas while the other sported Captain America. The chocolate eyes and copper skin of the former made him look like a miniature version of James, while the latter possessed a head of long sandy hair and a pair of round cheeks dominated by freckles. Standing behind them was the woman Jacob recognized as his ex-wife, Mary, who gave James a pained smile while keeping a hand on each boy&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi James,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m really sorry about this, but...Marco and Paul were going to have a sleepover at my house tonight, but I just got a call from my sister saying that my mom&#39;s in the hospital after a nasty fall. They think she&#39;ll be okay, but I really want to be there for her. I hate to ask - I know it&#39;s my weekend - but would you mind watching them just for tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, er...&quot; James was at a loss for a moment but seemed to gather himself when he saw Marco and Paul&#39;s hopeful little smiles. He grinned and ruffled their hair. &quot;Of course. Give your mother my best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob wasn&#39;t sure what to make of all this until he saw the mortified look on Rick&#39;s face, following his baby boyfriend&#39;s eyes to see that Marco and Paul were smirking in their direction. Jacob gulped and sucked his thumb with a little more fervor as Mary departed, as James led the two grade-schoolers into the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boys, you remember Paul, right?&quot; He said as he gave the sandy-haired boy a squeeze on the shoulder. &quot;He&#39;s my son&#39;s best friend, and he&#39;ll be spending the night here with Marco. Doesn&#39;t that sound like fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
Neither Rick nor Jacob could manage more than a nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I like to hear. You guys play in here for a minute while I go set up the bedroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he left - leaving the toddlers alone with their new companions, whose seven-year-old statures dwarfed their own. James hadn&#39;t been out of earshot for a second when Marco and Paul suddenly stepped up to them, crossing their arms as the same diabolical smirks crept across their lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, wook at da widdle babies sucking dere fumbies,&quot; Marco teased. &quot;What&#39;s the matter, huh? You scared?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet they need a change,&quot; Paul snickered. &quot;I bet they&#39;re pooping their pants right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Am not!&quot; Rick squealed as he plucked his thumb from his lips and stamped his tiny bare foot. The tiny show of defiance only made the boys laugh harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what <i>I</i> heard,&quot; Marco simpered. &quot;I heard that they <i>like</i> making big messes in their diapers. They pee and poop in their pants and then play with their weenies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, they&#39;re just trying to be grown-ups again.&quot; Paul chuckled as he turned his attention to Jacob, who shivered under the boy&#39;s cruel eyes. &quot;Isn&#39;t that right, Jakey? Do you play with your weenie &#39;cause you wanna be a grown-up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob&#39;s heart pounded as he found himself in the center of another fantasy come to life. Not every regressive daydream, after all, had been sunshine and lollipops - sometimes nothing made him more excited than the thought of being turned into a baby and then being teased mercilessly for his sudden helplessness, for falling from the independence of manhood to diaper-dependent, thumbsucking toddlerhood. The humiliation was made all the more delicious by the fact that it was being carried out by a pair of smart-assed seven-year-olds, Jacob blushing to his roots and squirming in conflicted ecstasy as his suddenly-stiff dinky nestled itself deep into the front of his diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s too scared to even answer,&quot; Marco snorted. &quot;What a <i>baby.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
With that he shoved Jacob while Paul did the same to Rick, both babies immediately losing what little balance they had and falling right on their thickly-padded bottoms. Shocked by the suddenness of the attack, Jacob felt tears sting at the corner of his eyes and looked over to see that Rick had been similarly brought to the verge of bawling. Jacob had no time to comfort his boyfriend, though, as his attention was immediately monopolized by the realization that Marco and Paul were heading for James&#39; bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon,&quot; Marco said. &quot;Sometimes my dad brings home some cool stuff from work.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Chronivac! There was no telling what hell would be unleashed if these two brats got their hands on it. Mustering every bit of his physical and emotional resolve, Jacob swallowed his tears and struggled to his feet, feeling as though he were fighting his pudgy legs and his super-thick diaper every step of the way. When he finally stood it was to see that the worst had happened - that the boys had pulled out the device and were looking it over with rabid curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Jacob squealed as he toddled towards them. &quot;Don&#39; toth dat!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marco and Paul scoffed at the baby and went right back to playing with the Chronivac. Though Jacob waddled as fast as his legs and clothing would allow, he couldn&#39;t make it to the boys before they could inadvertently set a change into motion - and the horrified toddler could do nothing but look on as...</p>
