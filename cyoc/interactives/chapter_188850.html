<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the WSA didn&#39;t have the big competitive games that were promised, due to the coronavirus, there were still Animalians who participated to set records. Since the pandemic prevented full participation, the main focus of this year was comparing human capabilities with Animalians&#39;. As a rough rule of thumb, Animalians were superior to the average human in every physical way. This was mainly due to the health-restoring and strength-boosting effects of the virus. Even the smaller Animalians were a lot more capable than they looked.<br />
<br />
A prime example was Rocket the Mangrove Killifish. Shi had a tiny fish before shi was uplifted, being only an inch long. Shi was relatively short for an Animalian, but shi appropriate curves for a herm. Short as shi was, there was one aspect of hir being a killifish that had significantly carried over from hir uplifting. The killifish is an amphibious fish, capable of breathing air and climbing up trees like a mudskipper. But what really made it noticeable was its ability to leap several times its body length. That had translated towards very powerful legs and an affinity for gymnastics.<br />
<br />
The last IAC had been relatively small in anticipation for a bigger event that would coincide with the Olympics. The pandemic delayed and changed the plans. Even so, Rocket sat a pretty high bar for gymnastics, especially considering shi was an uplifted fish. Many had watched hir make fantastic leaps that even top-tier Olympians wouldn&#39;t be able to match. There was a lot of cheering, but one particular person was a lot more rowdy than the others.<br />
<br />
A fish Animalian was in the front row seats and had been hooting and hollering for Rocket as if shi was playing in a football game or some other sport that was rowdier than gymnastics. People noticed how she had a remarkable resemblance to Rocket with her silver scales, golden on her arms and back. The main difference was her short black hair. It was very obvious that this fish was female, considering she was wearing a sports bra that wasn&#39;t meant to so much contain her breasts but enhance her cleavage. Obviously, people weren&#39;t looking at &#39;her&#39; crotch, which had a noticeable tent in it.<br />
<br />
Those who would know hir before hir conversion would be very surprised that this energetic herm fish was Lee. Lee had been more of a laid-back person when she was human. Her asexuality dulled her passion, though it didn&#39;t make her heartless. Her mellow personality and androgynous features made her easier to overlook. Not so hir new Animalian self. Part of hir behavior could be explained as making up for lost time. Though a more probable explanation was that shi was being effected by a variation of RHS. Lee may not have gotten younger, but hir libido was being roused for the first time, turning indifferent asexuality into very passionate bisexuality. And while Rocket was glad to have a bond-mate of hir own, even shi had noticed Lee&#39;s shift in personality had been a dramatic one. It had been obvious ever since hir conversion.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Lee wasn&#39;t quite as keen about her conversion being sexual in nature. She just couldn&#39;t overcome her lack of physical attraction to Rocket. It wasn&#39;t that Rocket was ugly to her, but shi just didn&#39;t interest Lee. Of course, that was why she wanted to convert in the first place. Befitting Rocket&#39;s aquatic nature, Lee wanted her conversion to be in water. Beacon and Allura were quite generous and let the two of them sue their house&#39;s pool. Honestly, Beacon and Allura had been considering selling the house and moving to Mieni Atoll full-time. It seemed like a more appropriate place to raise their spawn.<br />
<br />
When Lee was in her one-piece swimsuit, it really revealed how curveless she was. If it wasn&#39;t for the slight curve of her chest and the lack of bulge between her legs, she could have passed for an adolescent boy. Rocket&#39;s bikini made the contrast between their body types all the more obvious.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, are you ready for a drink?&quot; asked Rocket as shi reached up to undo hir top.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you bring a glass?&quot; asked Lee.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, you could just drink it directly,&quot; said Rocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t try to force it yet,&quot; said Lee, &quot;I want to open up, but I can&#39;t make myself do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rocket sighed and said, &quot;Well, that&#39;s a minor roadbump.&quot; Shi picked up a glass by the poolside before turning around. Lee heard the killifish made a small moaning sound. Then shi turned back around, the bottom of the glass now covered with fresh milk. &quot;Just a small dose will get things started,&quot; shi said.<br />
<br />
Lee took the glass and hesitated for a moment. Thinking of where this milk came from nauseated her a bit. But she wanted to move past that revulsion. She quickly downed the drink and found another reason to be revolted. &quot;Why is your milk salty?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My kind are capable of living in brackish water,&quot; said Rocket, &quot;What else should it taste like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But can&#39;t you also live in freshwater?&quot; asked Lee, who was starting to feel rather warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re very adaptable, as you&#39;re about to find out,&quot; said Rocket.<br />
<br />
Lee felt herself get even warmer. There was a sudden stinging sensation in her neck. She grasped at her neck and found slits opening in her skin. She panicked a bit as she thought she falling apart. But Rocket took her hands in hirs and said, &quot;Don&#39;t freak out. Those are your new gills.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I...breathe?&quot; asked Lee, not noticing her hands were growing golden scales and webbing between her fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just take it slow,&quot; said Rocket as shi lowered hirself beneath the water&#39;s surface. Lee slowly did the same. She felt a strange comfort as her gills took in water for the first time. She felt a tinge of panic as her mouth and nose went underwater, but she soon felt no need to hold her breath. Her vision was blurred underwater before it cleared up, allowing her to see Rocket smiling at her. Rocket then surfaced and Lee followed hir. Her head had emerged differently from the water. Her nose and ears had shrank to near-nonexistence. Her lips and eyes had grown quite larger. The silver scales that were now on Lee&#39;s face completed her fishy look.<br />
<br />
But then Lee started feeling even warmer. She felt an unusual urge to rub her chest. Her nipples seemed more receptive to her touch now. And she was becoming aware that there was more mass beneath them. &quot;I&#39;m feeling...funny...&quot; she moaned. Her boyish hips were also widening out. Her one-piece was put under more tension when her ass started expanding and mass started filling in above it. &quot;I need to...get this...&quot; grunted Lee as she pulled at her one-piece. She didn&#39;t have to deal with it for long. Her swimsuit was meant for her slender, flat figure and couldn&#39;t cope her burgeoning curves. With a loud rip, the front of her swimsuit split open, allowing her now B-cup breasts to bounce out. Lee massaged her nipples, which were now covered with golden scales.<br />
<br />
An intense sensation between her legs drove her to tear away the bottom of her swimsuit. It was rather easy considering how it was already too small for her hips and ass. Her new tail also helped tear apart what remained of her swimsuit. Now fully free, Lee plunged her fingers between her lower lips. She let out a loud moan as her sense of touch exploded. Why had she never indulged herself before? But even this wasn&#39;t enough. She gave Rocket a lustful look and said, &quot;Fuck me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pardon?&quot; asked Rocket, not expecting such a reversal of opinion.<br />
<br />
Lee swam over to Rocket easily with her new tail. &quot;I said fuck me,&quot; she said before pulling down Rocket&#39;s shorts. The killifish&#39;s penis extended out to its full 10-inch length, already aroused by Lee&#39;s transformation. Lee didn&#39;t waste time before impaling herself on it. There was a bit of pain at first, but soon both of them were moaning with pleasure. In mad passion, Lee gave Rocket a sensuous kiss on the lips before taking off her top and sucking at hir nipples.<br />
<br />
Lee&#39;s transformation progressed as they moved together. Her body was now covered in silver scales asides from gold on her hands, back, and nipples. Her tail grew out to its full length as her feet extended into flippers. Lee&#39;s curves grew to match Rocket&#39;s, her breasts filling out to D-cups. Rocket put hir hands on Lee&#39;s shoulders as shi got closer to hir climax. Shi vaguely noticed that Lee&#39;s shoulders were also becoming wider. Then the last part of Lee&#39;s transformation kicked in. What had been her clitoris surged in size, becoming a more definitive shape, identical to the rod that was currently thrusting into hir vagina. Then both killifish let out a loud moan as Rocket pumped hir sperm into hir mate.<br />
<br />
Rocket blinked as shi came down off hir high. Shi barely recognized the Lee looking at hir now. It wasn&#39;t just because of hir killifish Animalian body or hir curvy hermaphrodite figure. It was the wild, hungry look in Lee&#39;s eyes and the lustful grin on hir lips that made hir almost unrecognizable. Practically the only thing remaining of the old Lee was hir short black hair. &quot;Well, I hope you enjoyed that,&quot; said Rocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I did, but we&#39;re not finished yet,&quot; said Lee. With surprising speed, shi pulled hirself off Rocket&#39;s dick before plunging hir new member into Rocket&#39;s pussy. &quot;Now it&#39;s your turn.&quot;</p>
