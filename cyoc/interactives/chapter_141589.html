<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stephen had fallen asleep on the couch. He had spent himself both mentally and physically transforming and using the people at the party for his own gains. <br />
<br />
He woke up to hear a metallic clattering. Looking over, he saw Tom greedily and hungrily lapping at his balls with his oversized tongue, the tag on his dog collar tapping against the oversized piercing on his hard dick. <br />
<br />
Tom was still mentally retching at his actions but his face showed utter contentment and his hard dick leaked from his ministrations.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Dammit Meat, take that shit somewhere else!&quot; Stephen said, his head aching from the party. <br />
<br />
Tom &quot;Ripe Meat&quot; Stout gave a short yelp and ambled upstairs away from the guy who had done such horrible shit to him, his dog tail buttplug bobbing the whole way up. <br />
<br />
A couple of clicks on his laptop and Stephen felt refreshed and invigorated. He was wearing some nice shorts and a fresh t-shirt.<br />
<br />
Now electronically freed from any hangover induced problems. He was hungry.  Walking into the kitchen, he saw D-Rod digging in to a pan of freshly made scrambled eggs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Want some food? Professor Scott made breakfast before he bailed. He said he had to run back to the office and input some grades.&quot; D-Rod said politely. <br />
<br />
Stephen nodded and then walked over to the fridge as D-Rod doled out some of the eggs. <br />
<br />
As Stephen, reached in for the milk, D-Rod said, &quot;That milk&#39;s bad. I wouldn&#39;t drink it if I were you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem.&quot; Stephen said, tossing the half-full jug in the trash and sitting down in front of his computer. <br />
<br />
D-Rod went back to eating his eggs as he heard Stephen typing something. <br />
<br />
Then, with a jolt, he felt his stomach get tight. He pushed away from the table and stood up as he felt something expand in the front of his loosely fitting athletic shorts. <br />
<br />
Disregarding any modesty, and because since last night, he had had nothing to hide down there, D-Rod shucked off the shorts and watched in a panic as a distended fleshly lump pulsated out from  below his gut and what had been a flat lump where his cock had once been.  <br />
<br />
The lump rapidly expanded and began to form four elongated lumps.  He watched, unable to move or even speak as the lumps took on a familiar shape. They looked just like the cock he used to have. <br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t believe it. Just below his belly button, he now had an udder that was bigger than a basketball. It was covered in the light dusting of hair that his stomach normally had.  Where a cows tests would normally be, he had four half hard cocks, each as long as his original five inches before he had been &quot;derodded&quot; last night.  <br />
<br />
He felt a similar prickle of feeling in his chest and he pulled off his shirt to reveal two shorter cock-shaped nipples where his normal nipples had been.  <br />
<br />
He felt the distended sack slosh and tighten. <br />
<br />
&quot;I almost forgot to milk today! If I don&#39;t do it now, I&#39;ll leak for the rest of the morning.&quot; D-Rod said. Knowing in his mind that he had never milked himself before and never could have been milked before this morning. <br />
<br />
He got up and when to the pantry and pulled out a large four nozzled machine connected to a tube that went snaked back to the pantry.  He sat down and attached the four tubes to his cock udder and flipped a switch. The nozzles on the machine began to make a rhythmic sucking noise as a little engine in the pantry hummed to life.  <br />
<br />
D-Rod fell back against the chair. His face a flushed look of ecstasy and embarrassment.  <br />
The sensation he was feeling now was better than anything he had ever felt, maybe excluding his night with Professor Scott.<br />
<br />
D-Rod reached up with his hands and began playing with the two cocklets on his chest.  Stephen watched as the slightest white dribbles began to seep from the tips of those little dicks.  <br />
<br />
After about ten minutes of Stephen idly pushing eggs in his plate and D-Rod in a state of mind blowing orgasm, the machine completed its cycle.  D-Rod sat back panting, and, wiping the six inch rivulets of liquid from his chest, he got up and put back his device.  <br />
<br />
With some sloshing and maneuvering, D-Rod came out with a pitcher of milk. He happily poured Stephen a glass. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, ever since I can remember, this bad boy has cranked out nothing but 2% milk,&quot; D-Rod said a little boastfully still knowing in his mind that he had never done a thing like that in his life. &quot;I didn&#39;t even know people bought milk at the grocery store until I was in high school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really? How interesting.&quot; Stephen said with an air of false curiousity. &quot;So all your teats produce milk?&quot; <br />
<br />
D-Rod blushed. &quot;Well, not the top two. Given their shape, I bet you can guess what else they produce.&quot; He gave a sly grin. &quot;Though I may beg to differ, not everyone else think me what they make is quite as refreshing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Though he had said all of those things, he knew that before this morning, none of it was true.  D-Rod was terrified. He remembered having a normal set of male genitalia and then having nothing and now looking like a six cock-teated barnyard nightmare. <br />
<br />
Then, he heard tapping on that near-stranger&#39;s computer and all was right in the world. This was his life.  He was definitely different than most of the guys he knew but people liked him. They had called him Dairy-Rods for years and eventually shortened it to the D-Rod everybody on campus knew him by. <br />
<br />
He ambled upstairs to get dressed. Briefly yelled at Ripe Meat for rolling in the cumstained bedding of his room and came back downstairs in a pair of overalls with a whole cut out of the navel and crotch to let his dick udder breathe. He came downstairs and playing with one of the cocks on his chest, he told Stephen he was going to go and see if the Professor was done grading. <br />
<br />
Stephen finished his meal and left. It was a Friday and because he had scheduled his classes well, he was free to go and do what he wanted to.</p>
