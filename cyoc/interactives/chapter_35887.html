<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of course, she couldn't go to school totally naked. Jenny realized she needed to figure out some way of getting dressed that wouldn't totally restrict her from seeing or speaking. Rummaging through her drawers she found a slender string bikini. She normally wouldn't be caught dead wearing something like this to school, but under the circumstances it seemed to be adequate. She also noticed, as she was going through her underwear drawer, that all of her bras had completely disappeared. Was it really possible that everyone else would think she had always been this way?
<br>
<br>
She decided against socks and her usual shoes, considering that her feet were now the closest things she had to hands. Instead, she went in her closet and found a pair of flip-flops. They were easy to take off, in case she needed to use her feet. She realized, wearing a bikini and sandals, that she probably looked more like she was going to the beach than to school.
<br>
<br>
Taking her backpack was absolutely out of the question. At this point, going to her usual classes was the last thing on her mind. Jenny just wanted to go to school, find Erika, get her friend to change her back to normal, and go home. Instead of her backpack, Jenny decided to take just her purse (with her cell phone back in it), which she managed to hold by balancing the strap on the new top of her waist so that the purse hung between her legs. At last she was ready.
<br>
<br>
Normally she would have driven to school, and it would have taken her only 10 minutes. She rapidly realized that it was impossible to drive in her current state. She would have to walk to school, which would take her half an hour at least. She crept along the sidewalk, hiding behind bushes and trees, hoping that no one would see her.
<br>
<br>
By the time she finally made it to school, first period was already halfway finished. Erika had to be in class, and there was no way Jenny was going to be able to pull her out of it. She was going to have to wait. Jenny sneaked inside the building, looking to be sure the halls were empty. When she saw that the coast was clear, she ran to the nearest girls' restroom and hid in a stall. There she waited for another 30 minutes, until finally she heard the bells in the hall ring for the next period. This was her chance. She had five minutes to get Erika's attention.
<br>
<br>
Jenny pulled her cell phone out of her purse and dialed Erika again. This time she had to put it on speakerphone, because there was no way to get her new "mouth" close enough to the phone. The phone rang, and rang... and at last, Erika picked up.
<br>
<br>
"Hello?"
<br>
<br>
"Erika! Thank God I finally got you! It's Jenny!"
<br>
<br>
"Oh... hey, Jenny. Like, where are you? You weren't in class this morning..."
<br>
<br>
"I'm in the downstairs bathroom. I <i>really</i> need to talk to you in person, right <i>now</i>. It's an emergency."
<br>
<br>
"What? Are you alright?"
<br>
<br>
"You'll see for yourself! Just, please, get down here right away!"
<br>
<br>
"Alright, I'm on my way."
<br>
<br>
And then Erika hung up. Yes, thought Jenny. She'd gotten through. Erika was on her way down, and she was going to fix this. Jenny thought about what she was going to do with the curse once she was back to normal. Oh, Kyle Perkins was going to <i>pay</i> for this.
<br>
<br>
Within a few minutes, Jenny could hear Erika walk into the restroom. "Jenny? Are you in here?" Jenny called out, "In here, in the stall. Quick, get in here before someone sees you." Erika hesitated slightly, then finally reluctantly obliged her.
<br>
<br>
"Okay, Jenny," said Erika, slightly annoyed. "Like, what's this emergency?"
<br>
<br>
"Erika, look at me!"
<br>
<br>
"Yeah... so?"
<br>
<br>
Jenny was shocked by Erika's nonchalant response. "You don't notice anything different about me? Nothing at all?"
<br>
<br>
"Other than you being, like, dressed to go to the beach?"
<br>
<br>
"Erika!" cried Jenny. "The entire top half of my body is gone! I'm a pair of legs now! For Christ's sake, I'm talking out of my vagina!"
<br>
<br>
"I don't get it," said Erika, puzzled. "Like, how is that any different than yesterday? I mean, yeah, I've always kinda thought it was strange, but you've <i>always</i> been like this."
<br>
<br>
It was true. Kyle really had made it so that nobody remembered how Jenny was supposed to look. Jenny was quick to correct her friend. "No, Erika, I haven't. Listen to me. This morning I got a phone call from this creep named Kyle Perkins..."
<br>
<br>
"Kyle Perkins?" interrupted Erika. "Who?"
<br>
<br>
"That freshman we pantsed."
<br>
<br>
"Oh yeah... I remember him now. Go on. What'd he say?"
<br>
<br>
"He... challenged me to Transform or Dare. I said 'transform', not really thinking the curse was real, and he turned me into this. Part of the curse was that nobody would remember that I'm supposed to have a normal body. I need your help."
<br>
<br>
"What do you need <i>me</i> to do?" asked Erika.
<br>
<br>
"I'm going to ask you to Transform or Dare. I need you to pick 'dare'. That way I can dare you to ask me next, and I can say 'transform', and you can turn me back to normal. Okay?"
<br>
<br>
"Yeah... okay..."
<br>
<br>
"Erika... Transform or Dare?"</p>
