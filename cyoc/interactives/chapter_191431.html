<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scott&#39;s worksite was usually pretty concealed, well, aside from Jeff&#39;s own section - so he usually didn&#39;t fear for anything if he wanted to fool around. More than once, the blond curly haired office jock would have a date over in his cubicle area. Having the boss&#39; ear meant having one of the larger and more secluded area in the building...and it just so happened that more than a few times, his female coworkers would get bored. Office work was often drudgework, and so they came by his place for a little...R&R.<br />
<br />
It was pretty amazing what a good and hard fuck could do for someone. Despite how much work went into it, most often they walked out feeling better than they had going in. Not that Scott blamed them. For all his reputation, he was a remarkably attentive lover. You don&#39;t get the stud reputation by simply using people for sex and then tossing them aside when you&#39;re done. He barely considered Jeff a factor in his privacy - not before, and not now - even with how Jeff had recently buffed up.<br />
<br />
Scott was...well, Scott. He took his privilege and status for granted after having utilized it for so long.<br />
<br />
So when he went ahead and drank the Muscle Tech-X, eager to see exactly what sort of &quot;pre-workout&quot; would give Jeff that kind of a boost, he wasn&#39;t expecting the kind of kick this stuff had. Even as Scott reclined in his chair, he almost reflexively fell out of it when it hit him. &quot;Mmfuck...&quot; He gulped, trying to not make too much noise. But as he did, he looked down and saw something that made him tilt his head. His stomach, pressed up against the shirt he was wearing, was starting to shift. To sculpt right there in front of his eyes, the fat deposits he had induced on himself via constant office parties and drinking therein was...was disappearing...!<br />
<br />
Scott&#39;s eyes went wild and his mouth tugged at a grin.<br />
<br />
He remembered when he was younger - a more handsome example of jock masculinity. Oh the thrumming, powerful sort of build he had. Back then, he was---he was...! Could it be? Scott watched with eager eyes as he saw his biceps and triceps seem to start pulsating, quivering under his office shirt. He lifted his arms, alternating view, each time, and every single time he switched arms, he saw his biceps pump a little bit bigger. &quot;Ohh fuck me...&quot; Scott murmured.<br />
<br />
The office jock felt his shoulders starting to grow even as his biceps started tearing his shirt - fighting for more room, knowing his triceps were not far behind. &quot;No...this is a nice shirt...!&quot; Scott only just barely got the shirt off in time, though he still heard his sleeves tear a little bit. He had some larger vests and jackets stored here in case of a rainy day - he was something of a nut for preparedness - though he held off on that, deciding to wait and watch to see how big he got.<br />
<br />
As much as he was shocked and somewhat dismayed by his body outgrowing his office clothes, Scott was just as quickly becoming overjoyed. &quot;Ahahah...ohh wow...&quot; He watched his shoulders bulge and surge with musculature, first the lateral head seeming biggest, then the front, then the rear, before all three evened out. He gasped as he felt his back starting to widen right there in his seat. It was the feeling of his lats and delts hitting the sides of his chair even though he didn&#39;t move that got him <i>hard</i>.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm...wow...fuck...&quot; Scott groaned, trying not to alert anyone walking by. Thankfully it seemed today he didn&#39;t have any...dates. Not a usual thing for him to be thankful for, but he wanted to make sure they didn&#39;t see him like this. It&#39;d cause some panic! Scott gulped when he felt his groin shift, his cock if anything growing larger and more sensitive even as his pecs likewise started pushing out more. Growing more sizable and pronounced. Usually Scott would say his biceps were his best muscle, but by now his pecs had replaced them in that regard...though there was something slightly odd about how exactly pronounced they were. Scott never <i>got</i> pecs like that before. Not even when he trained them 3 days a week back in high school...!<br />
<br />
&quot;My pecs...ooh...oh! My ass!&quot; Scott wiggled in his seat as he felt his butt growing out, likewise becoming more sensitive in an odd way. Pressing against the rear of his pants...ohh fuck he was getting so hard. Scott realized if it kept going like this, he might well make a mess in his work pants, and he couldn&#39;t quite so easily replace work pants! The closest thing he had was in his locker and...fuck! Feeling his quads sculpt right there in front of his eyes almost made him cum then and there.<br />
<br />
Scott swooned as he watched his legs begin to swell, the size and shape of his thighs and quads almost too big. Like they, plus his ass, were changing how his body usually looked. Almost looking pronounced. Scott grit his teeth and fought back another almost cum in his pants as he felt his calves pump up in his pants and almost tear his lower leg sleeves. Feeling his feet start to press against his shoes, growing larger themselves, it was an unexpectedly erotic deal.<br />
<br />
For now, Scott just sat there in his cubicle, breathing in and out, trying to fight off any orgasmic sensation. He knew if he made a mess as he was now, he would have to spend a long, long time cleaning it up. Just think un-sexy thoughts, Scott told himself. He tried, but his attention always got dragged back to his newly buffed out body. Fuck how many pounds did he gai---no! Just thinking about how much muscle he gained made his dick pulse in his pants and almost press upward. He didn&#39;t know if his pants could handle that!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Scott, looking like you handled that pretty well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott almost jumped when he heard that, turning around and muttering apologies under his breath, not even knowing if he&#39;d keep his job by the end of the day...until he saw Jeff standing by his cubicle entrance. A knowing smile on his face. The office jock found himself feeling just so desperately horny...and realized that that one drink probably did all of this to him. Made him this big muscle man. Got him feeling healthy and strong as he was once - and if anything, even more than that. &quot;J-Jeff! Holy fuck man, you scared the daylights outta me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thankfully, Jeff&#39;s presence was abating the horniness. Well, just as long as his insurgent arousal didn&#39;t pull up any distinctly queer possibilities for relieving his issues. Jeff stated, &quot;Sorry about that. Just saying. People tend to handle their Muscle Tech-X differently. Seems you really took to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>What, then, Scott thought with a slight smile, <i>Would another dose do to me...?</i> &quot;Dude...that felt amazing,&quot; Scott said with a smile, &quot;Could I...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m trying to let more of the guys here have their chance at it...&quot; Jeff said with a teasing reluctance. He had no intention to actually keep it away from Scott. He just wanted to see what the jock was willing to say or do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cmon man, don&#39;t dangle it right in front of me!&quot; Scott groaned, rubbing his forehead and thinking of what another dose could do for him. He could really take the lead in that gym workout he agreed to with Jeff. He could become even more desirable to the women around here!<br />
<br />
Jeff...</p>
