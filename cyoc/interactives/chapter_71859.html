<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad Marshall couldn't believe his predicament. He was in an underclassman's gym bag.  He was nearly naked, <br />
and he was rolled up like a towel.  He was initially grateful that he had been rolled feet first, so that his <br />
face looked outward. But soon he was zipped up into the darkness of the bag with his own smelly uniform.  He <br />
wished he had washed it after the last practice or at least the one before that. He heard the rest of his team <br />
come out to practice.  He wanted to warn them, but he couldn't. So the Varsity Team had lost a few lousy <br />
games, they couldn't do this to him and his teammates, he thought.  A couple hours passed, and he overheard <br />
the Junior Varsity guys chatting.  He was picked up and carried to the locker room. He recognized some of the <br />
voices of the JV players, but he didn't hear any of the Varsity guys. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Mike, what are you doing with Chandler?&quot; Jay asked.<br />
<br />
Chandler?  He was on the Varsity Team, and he was Chad's wingman when they went bar trolling for women. He <br />
thought back to what Rod had said about Chad being jock off material. Oh, know he was in a gay guy's gym bag.  <br />
The bag zipper opened, and Jay's dirty practice gear was shoved on top of him.  Dirty socks and jockstrap <br />
first. He could no longer see, but he could hear better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chandler is now my towel, Jay. And I am going to relax with him in the sauna. Care to join us? You can use <br />
Monroe as your towel,&quot; Mike said.<br />
<br />
The bag shifted, and the clothing on top of Chad shifted. He could see with one eye through the space between <br />
the jockstrap and one of the socks. A flattened, totally-naked Alan Monroe being handed to naked Jay. Poor <br />
A.M., thought Chad.  At least he hadn't been folded and then shaken out. A.M. fluttered like a flag for almost <br />
a minute before Jay stopped shaking him and wrapped him around his waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you wrapped his face inward,&quot; Mike chastised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh,&quot; Jay sputtered, he hadn't really been paying attention.<br />
<br />
Rod interjected, &quot;Mike, it's obvious.  Jay wants A. M. to have the best seat in the sauna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, I get it!&quot; Mike laughed, &quot;You'll be sitting on his face. Here let me adjust Chandler. I had burritos <br />
for lunch, I'm going to give his nose a workout.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch it, Mike, I'm going be in the sauna with you. Save your dutch oven farts for when you are alone with <br />
Chandler, okay?&quot; Jay said with a chuckle.<br />
<br />
Oh, Chandler, no. Chad was helpless to stop these young thugs from doing whatever they wanted to him and his <br />
buddies. <br />
<br />
In felt like hours until Jay returned.  He opened his bag to retrieve his mp3 player.  He moved his clothing <br />
and looked a Chad's permanently startled face. He grinned, and carefully cover Chad back up with the jockstrap <br />
and socks and jersey before zipping the bag shut. <br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad they're not that absorbent,&quot; Jay lamented as he wrung out A.M. before turning the flattened Senior in <br />
to Rod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well they serve as reminders to future Varsity teams the penalty for failure.  They'll each be branded <br />
PROPERTY OF THE VARSITY TEAM, and spend the rest of their existence as towel boys,&quot; laughed Rod. <br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad that not all of them showed up.  I'd love to be able to wipe my ass with that smart ass quarterback <br />
Chad Marshall,&quot; Mike said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don't be so hard on Chad,&quot; Rod said, &quot;He's not that smart! But I wouldn't expect him or those other <br />
missing Varsity players to turn up.  They probably heard what was in store for them, and took off never to be <br />
seen again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay was silent. He didn't want to let slip that he had the trophy boy in his gym bag, and Rod had three other <br />
Varsity players neatly folded in the back of his locker.  He waved goodbye and took off with his gym bag <br />
swinging from his arm as he ran. <br />
<br />
Chad was disgusted.  He heard Jay shouting for the bus to wait. The only time Chad was on a bus was when it <br />
was a chartered one. Jay was taking public transit. He heard and felt the gym bag hit the grimy floor of the <br />
bus. At least he imagined it was grimy.  The truth would have disappointed him. The floor was in fact <br />
relatively clean. He then felt two things push in on the bag.  He correctly surmised that the bag was between <br />
his new owner's feet. Owner?  Why had he thought of Jay that way. Why was he getting excited to be owned by <br />
one guy instead of property of the team?  What was wrong with him?  He should be trying to think of a way out, <br />
not how to make the best of his situation! Still Jay was lean, young and muscular, and if he was to be Jay's <br />
poster boy, well he wouldn't really mind watching the guy worshiping Chad's body as he jacked off.  Would he?  <br />
Should he?  Chad wasn't sure anymore about anything. <br />
<br />
The bus ride was a nightmare for Chad.  Just when got inured to the smell of Jay's sock, the jolting ride was <br />
shift the clothing and he'd have a face full of his own dirty jockstrap. Then a few minutes later as the bus <br />
jolted to another stop, it would be replaced by Jay's jockstrap, then one of Chad's socks, then one of Jay's.  <br />
Other smelly articles of clothing shifted too.  Chad realized that he was now on the far side of the gym bag, <br />
he could feel the outline of Jay's shoe through the thin vinyl material. <br />
<br />
At last the interminable ride ended. Jay was swinging his bag even more vigorously ran home. Chad was filled <br />
with hope, dread and uncertainty.  Jay banged the bag against the wall and his legs as he ran upstairs.  For a  <br />
brief moment Chad felt weightless, but that ended with a thud as the bag came to a rest. Chad and the clothing <br />
had tumbled as the bag flew through the air.  It had ended with Chad experiencing a new unpleasant scent.  The <br />
skid mark area of some dirty briefs.  He desperately hoped that they were his own briefs, but he doubted that <br />
Jay knew the combination to Chad's locker.  Of course, Rod could have cut the lock off, he hoped uncertainly. <br />
<br />
Chad lay there for hours in the darkness and stench. Finally, he felt footsteps, and then he heard them as <br />
they approached. But there was no movement or sound of the zipper. It was at this point that horrified Chad <br />
remembered he was still wearing his jockstrap and socks.  That meant most of what he smelled belonged to Jay.  <br />
<br />
Jay kept walking by him or somebody, but Chad assumed it was Jay.  Who else would be in Jay's room? Chad was <br />
certain that was where he was.  After all he was going to end up plastered to Jay's wall, wasn't he?  Better <br />
than being a towel wrapped around Jay's waist wasn't it?  At last the zipper was pulled open, fresh air rushed <br />
in. The light dazzled Chad's eyes. Jay's hand squeezed his Chad's shoulder, ribs, right side,right <br />
buttocks,hip, right arm, right thigh, right calf, and right foot.  It was weird being rolled up around one's <br />
own self.  The tight grip freaked him out more than the fact Jay was naked. Jay sat on his bed with his legs <br />
up stretched out on the turned back sheets, and set rolled up Chad in his naked lap.  Chad could only think <br />
how big Jay's cock had grown.  He knew the size was an illusion. It was just his perspective had changed. He <br />
was looking up at Jay's boner.  He hadn't see Jay erect before, and he had never looked up at boner soaring <br />
over his head from a position level with the cock's balls. The smell was much better than he expected. With <br />
all the running around Jay had done after showering, Chad had expected his balls to smell this good. Must be <br />
really good deodorant soap, he thought.  Then his mind turned to the more likely explanation.  He had gotten <br />
used to the overwhelming scent of Jay trapped in his dirty clothes while he was sealed up in the gym bag.  Now <br />
he was getting the natural smell in an open room, it was smelling almost pleasant.<br />
<br />
In spite of his boner, Jay ignored both Chad and his boner.  He picked up his iPhone and keyed a speed dial <br />
number. Chad could hear Rod's voice on the other end of the line.  It was thin and distorted by the distance <br />
between Jay's crotch and ear, but he could still make out the words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Jay-man, how's it hanging?  You got your poster boy mounted yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet, Rod, he's still rolled up.  I wanted to check with you about how to stick him to the wall. Most of <br />
posters are stapled-&quot;<br />
<br />
Stapled! Chad screamed in silence, I'd rather be wrapped around your ass!<br />
<br />
&quot;Staples?  I'd recommend tape or the gooey green stick'em putty if you're going to use him as a poster. Of <br />
course, you could press him between two sheets of glass, and frame him?&quot; Rod suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds cool. I make do that eventually, if I don't decide to actually use him as a cum rag. Mike's <br />
suggestion was pretty hot, ya know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, Chad's all yours now, Jay. Do with him what you like,&quot; Rod said.<br />
<br />
Jay was silent for a moment. Then he asked the question he had been harboring all day, &quot;Rod why did you give <br />
Chad to me instead of making him team property?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, two reasons really- no wait three,&quot; Rod answered. You could hear his smile over the phone. He <br />
continued, &quot;First, you're my buddy, and you were crushing on Chad.  Whether it was hero worship or just the <br />
hots, I don't know or care, but you were definitely man-crushing on him. Second, I needed you to keep quiet <br />
about my own trophy boys, and what better way than having you a co-conspirator in keeping the missing players <br />
for ourselves. Third, well, I had almost forgotten about this, but you remember at the beginning of the <br />
season, coach had all the JV players go to the pool after practice?  Well, I was a bit delayed using the <br />
toilet. As I entered the locker room, I heard a snuffling sound.  Well, the locker room was empty except for <br />
Chad. He was standing there in just his tight football shorts and nothing else. He was standing in the middle <br />
of the room and he was sniffing.&quot;<br />
<br />
No! Shrieked Chad's mind, No!  Rod was spying on me?  I was sure I was alone. I only did it that one time. I <br />
don't know why.  I didn't even know whose they were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he sniffed, and sniffed, and then like Toucan Sam he followed his nose. He followed it to a dirty <br />
jockstrap hanging on a locker door. Then he looked around, and he picked up the ripe piece of cotton and <br />
spandex, and he put it up to his face, and he sniffed it. And even though he was wearing a cup, I could tell <br />
he was popping a boner from the way his bulge shifted and his body trembled for a few moments. Then he looked <br />
around guiltily, and hung the jockstrap back up, and ran off to finish changing at his own locker.  I had to <br />
know whose pheromones got our star QB becoming a switch hitter. So I checked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was sniffing my jockstrap?&quot; Jay asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What d'ya think?&quot; was Rod's sly reply.  It didn't matter whether Chad was sniffing Jay's jockstrap or not - <br />
it mattered that he was sniffing a jockstrap other than his own. A coach had interrupted him, so Rod had never <br />
checked to see who owned the jockstrap. It might have been Jay's.  He honestly didn't know.<br />
<br />
Jay's jockstrap? Chad was perplexed. Maybe this was his destiny like Rod had implied. He was meant to be owned <br />
by Jay. How had that kid managed to tackle him?  He wasn't that good, Chad was sure. Next year's Varsity team <br />
would probably end up flattened too, if Jay was their best defense man. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, it's late, Jay, and I got stuff to do,&quot; Rod said, &quot;Don't I boys? Just talking to my trophy boys. Have <br />
fun with your poster boy, goodnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
CLICK.<br />
<br />
Jay set his phone down, and inadvertently managed to press Chad between Jay's manhood and his thighs. He then <br />
carefully unrolled Chad on his bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad your clothes didn't flatten too, Chad, if they had I could leave you up all the time, and just peel <br />
your clothes off like Colorforms. I suppose I could make some cut-out clothing for you? But for now, I'll just <br />
put you on my ceiling with duct tape.  Then I can take you down in the morning, and roll you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
He did just that. He taped Chad's wrists to the ceiling, he pulled the jockstrap off, and creased Chad's waist <br />
into the corner of the ceiling and wall. Then he duct taped the flattened QB's legs to the wall.  Chad's socks <br />
felt weird on his flattened feet as the rest of his skin was pressed up against the smooth painted surfaces of <br />
the wall and ceiling. Jay reached up and peeled Chad's flattened cock away from his body. It was bent and <br />
folded a bit from Chad being crushed flat when Jay tackled him.  It was still as flat as Chad was but it stuck <br />
out at an angle because of Chad's position. The air from the furnace vent made it flutter like a streamer.  <br />
Jay laughed.  Then he noticed his fingers had something wet and sticky on them.  He laughed again and waggled <br />
his finger at Chad.<br />
<br />
He hopped on his bed and started jacking off while he stared up at Chad and smiled. <br />
<br />
Yeah, well, yeah, you just do that, thought Chad enviously.  His arms were flat immobile and taped to the <br />
ceiling.  He couldn't jack off now.  But the wind from the furnace vent was making his flat cock flutter madly <br />
in the air, and it felt like he was getting hard.<br />
<br />
Jay fell asleep with a white puddle on his abs and the lights on.<br />
<br />
Chad couldn't sleep.  He'd start to doze off when the furnace stopped blowing, but then it would start again. <br />
There was no way he could sleep with his cock flapping up and down in the air.</p>
