<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I looked at Erica.  &quot;Are you ready?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; she said.  &quot;I'm not really sure yet.  Please come back to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was at this point that I realized the others who had not changed yet were still strangers to me.  I didn't know any of their names.  There was the chauffeur, the gardener, the third maid, and another woman whom I guessed to be a kind of personal assistant or secretary.  The gardener was also a male, like the chauffeur.<br />
<br />
I walked over to the third maid.  She was young, appeared to be in her 20's.  She had a nice face.  She was pretty, though she probably wouldn't be described as the prettiest girl in the room on a regular basis.  She had black hair.  I couldn't really get a sense of her body in the unflattering maid uniform.  She wasn't overweight, and she definitely wasn't skeletal either.  Something told me that she had a nice, curvy figure but for some reason thought it unattractive.  Damned fashion magazines, I thought to myself.  &quot;I'm sorry, I still don't know your name.  What is it?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Christy,&quot; she said quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long have you worked here?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
She answered, &quot;Just a few months.  I needed a job after...things happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's OK, you don't need to tell me,&quot; I reassured.  I sensed that whatever &quot;things&quot; happened, it was not something pleasant.  &quot;Are you OK with what I'm doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled slightly.  &quot;I'm glad you say you're not going to sell the mansion or let those people take it over,&quot; she admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;But this?&quot; I asked as I gestured toward the people who had already changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems...unnatural,&quot; she said.  &quot;I mean, it is, but...well, everyone seems to like their changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you don't have something in mind for yourself?&quot; I asked.  She fidgeted in her seat and didn't answer.  &quot;Christy, I think you're afraid of something.  Not me, but something in general.&quot;  She still didn't answer and looked away from me.  &quot;I'm sorry, I'm not trying to embarrass you or make you tell me your history.  I do think that you should have a lot more confidence in yourself.  You're very pretty, no matter what someone else might have told you.  There's nothing wrong with you that I can see.  So please tell me, what would you like to be?  What's your favorite animal?  I can do that, if that's what you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at me again.  Her eyes were slightly red, as if tears were forming.  &quot;I've always liked bunny rabbits,&quot; she said.  &quot;I suppose that's what you can make me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What color?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
She chuckled.  &quot;Well, white of course.  They're the prettiest,&quot; she responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, you've got it,&quot; I said.  &quot;I wish that Christy will become a hybrid human/white rabbit.&quot;  It was at this point I broke my promise to them, as in my mind I added, &quot;I wish that Christy would be more confident in herself and that her hybrid form will retain a nice, curvy, hourglass figure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once the wish was complete, Christy's expression changed to one of slight discomfort.  &quot;Ow,&quot; she said and she stood up.  She turned her head as best she could to see her backside.  A sharp ripping sound was heard and a fluffy white tail emerged from just above her ass.  She turned back to look at me and as soon as she did, her two front teeth elongated and protruded from her mouth.  Her nose began to turn pink in color.<br />
<br />
Christy felt up to her ears, and with good reason.  Their change started as they grew longer and pointed as rabbit's ears.  They poked out from her hair and shifted position as they slowly moved to the top of her head.  Christy looked somewhat confused as she felt hair growing on her ears and they changed position.  The white hair, fur really, that now covered her ears grew on her face.  Her jaw extended slightly outward as it also assumed the shape of a rabbit.  Otherwise her face remained unchanged.<br />
<br />
Christy's feet burst through her shoes as, like with Jennings and Alice, they grew in size and covered in fur.  Small claws grew out from her toenails as her feet expanded.  The changes quickly spread up to her legs and her stockings ripped apart to reveal that her legs had grown larger and more muscular and also had white fur growing over them.<br />
<br />
Her hips grew wider and her uniform began to rip around them.  I could see her breasts swell against the uniform and they too caused the uniform itself to rip.  Christy tore the rest of her uniform off her body, just as Ms. Pierce, rather Theresa, had just done.  The white fur had almost completely overtaken her body and there was very little skin that remained visible.  With her uniform off, I was able to confirm that my thoughts were right and Christy did have a nice body.  Or at least I assumed she did from what I felt the changes didn't hide.<br />
<br />
As the fur covered her hands and arms, Christy looked herself up and down.  She realized she still had her bra and panties on.  It didn't appear she would for much longer as her breasts still grew larger and her hips still expanded.  She didn't give her body the chance to rip through them and instead ripped them off herself.  Since a rabbit was far different from a gorilla, I was curious to look at her breasts.  The fur covered them completely except for her nipples, which remained visible.  I found it interesting that if allowed for some small token of modesty where the new bodies of Alice and Theresa did not.<br />
<br />
The changes finished and they worked beautifully.  The second part of my wish was on evident display as she had large breasts and curvy hips, but with a smaller waistline.  Her body was larger overall, especially her legs.  Except for the small snout and the position of her ears, she had the same face.  Minus the fur, of course.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I wonder if I can hop,&quot; she said.  Her voice had a slight whistle to it.  She opened her eyes wide at the sound of her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can probably change that,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I think it's kind of cool,&quot; she said.  The &quot;S&quot; sound in particular had an extra whistle to it.  She tested out her body by attempting to hop.  She found that she could, but not in great difference as opposed to normally.  Her legs made it easier, but since she was in a hybrid form, her ass didn't touch the ground, so to speak, and so it wasn't exactly like a rabbit.  She looked quite striking in pristine white fur, I thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who's next?&quot; I asked.</p>
