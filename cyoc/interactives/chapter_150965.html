<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eduardo noticed the first option, &quot;LatinX&quot;. He stared in confusion. He knew it was a gender equality movement that the LGBT community had sponsored a couple times at his and Diego&#39;s bar but apart from that, he knew it was about Latinos and Latinas. He smirked, &quot;Que hace?&quot;. <br />
<br />
Still unaware of what the Chrinovac was, nor remembering everything that got him here, he pressed Enter. The menu opened with the same warning as before. He passed it carelessly, moving to age. He thought, I like my age: 23. Sex was greyed out. He looked at it as though it shouldn&#39;t have been but moved on to the reality setting. He peed to change reality, still believing this to be one of Diego&#39;s games he got from his Jefe. He then selected Transform. <br />
<br />
He shrugged, thinking, &quot;this is lame&quot; and walked two steps before he felt a sharp pain in his stomach. He screamed as he fell to his knees in pain, clutching his stomach. As his fingers navigated his once hard six pack, they felt a softness, a bloated feeling. Eduardo paused in horror as he felt a multitude of sensations hit him instantaneously. He felt his chest tighten and moved his hands. He felt scars where he had previously had his top surgery. Memories replayed in his head of being Elana, never fully secure in her own skin, wishing to be a man someday. Elana had met Diego when he was a Marine. Diego was Bi sexual and supported Elana&#39;s transition to Eduardo. Eduardo then moved his hands to his hips which we widening by the second, pain shooting though his, or her, body. She was a he! That was the point of the surgery, right, thought Eduardo. He was lost in confusion when he felt something strange below his waist happen. He crawled to the mirror and to his surprise, his penis had retracted almost fully into his body, his testicles had disappeared. Soon, all that remained was a clit. Eduardo had his mastectomy and completed his top surgery, even went through the pain of changing her legal name to Eduardo. Yet he still had a vagina. His fingers wandered in curiosity, feeling the now fleshy gash that lay before him. <br />
<br />
Pleasure hit him like a drug, the pain subsided and more memories poured in. He remembered Diego loved her and wanted to raise a family, even if she wanted to become a he. He remember a reordered version of the sex they had the night prior but it felt like months ago....<br />
<br />
Just then a warm sensation overcame him as his belly grew outward. The cum from last night leaked out more, triggering a realization. Diego&#39;s sperm had created a baby inside Eduardo.  He had to go to the bathroom terribly and waddled there. In the bathroom light, he could possibly see his features. His cheeks were rounded, eyes closer in, hair cut short to accommodate a wig while he and Diego went through the pregnancy. &quot;Dios Mio- I&#39;m pregnant!!,&quot; Eduardo exclaimed in shock. His voice was significantly more feminine as he remembered the doctor had told her to stop the testosterone therapy during the pregnancy. His facial hair receded. New self-doubt, different worries filled his head. Was he &quot;passing&quot;? Was he safe to go out carrying a child, looking like a half man? He cried, realizing the estrogen and baby had made him emotional at the drop of a hat. Diego knocked on the door, &quot;Everything okay baby?&quot; Eduardo opened the door to his handsome boyfriend, the father of his child. &quot;Yes honey, the baby was kicking&quot;. He smiled feeling Eduardo&#39;s round belly, kissing it. &quot;I can&#39;t wait for little Juan&quot;, he said teary-eyed. &quot;Neither can I baby&quot;Eduardo said, clutching his stomach one more. &quot;Oh my God, I think my water broke!&quot; <br />
<br />
Diego quickly moved Eduardo to the tub and filled the basin slightly. Afterward he ran to grab Maria. Diego&#39;s mom had been carrying for the two sense it was determined Eduardo was with child. She appeared, ready to assist in delivery. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay Hun?&quot; she said excitedly. Eduardo nodded. Memories of prenatal training filled his head and he opened his legs. He pushed, breathed, pushed, breathed. After what felt like hours, a crown emerged from his vagina, then a body after painful shrieks, and finally the legs. Maria rushed to cut the cord and wrapped the wailing child in swaddling. Eduardo sat in relief. <br />
<br />
The room paused and went black. Eduardo woke up in his bed, being held by Diego, his hand over his previously enlarged stomach but now tight and firm. New memories entered. It had been months, 6 to be exact. Eduardo&#39;s eyes wandered to the nightstand which had his testosterone supplements sitting next to the lamp. His stubble rubbed against the pillow as he slowly woke up and walked to the crib. There lay his baby boy, sleeping soundly. He then moved his hand to his crotch, feeling a clit again. He was still transitioning but was a passing male alongside his fiance. He smiled as he looked over to his desk which had on it a 8 inch strap-on and what looked like a laptop. He walked over in curiosity. &quot;Chrinovac&quot; he mouthed. &quot;Hmm&quot; he touched the  keys  and it lit up....</p>
