<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, hopefully the change will start soon,&quot; Steve said out loud. &quot;I really don&#39;t want to have to throw this note away and go back to real life after I got my hopes up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve felt a funny feeling in his pants. It felt like things were rearranging on his groin. He grimaced and ran to the bathroom. Maybe it was his imagination. He couldn&#39;t tell if the device was working. He still looked human enough, and he only felt different so far in this one place that he couldn&#39;t see yet. But he had to know. He loosened his belt, pulled town his jeans, wiggled out of his boxers, and stared in surprise at exactly a scene he was only half-expecting to find.<br />
<br />
His dick was bigger, and it wasn&#39;t a normal dick. For a human, anyway. He saw chocolate-brown fur all over his scrotum a second, more vertical bulge that seemed to be partially fused with his belly. Steve hadn&#39;t expected the transformation to start down there. But then, he&#39;d already given up on making any human babies, so it might as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder...&quot; he voiced incompletely, reaching down to play with his new doggy parts, hoping they&#39;d be as usable as his old parts.<br />
<br />
The brown-furred penis felt odd to the touch, but not bad. Not as sensitive as he was used to, but still pleasurable. He was surprised that the thing was already hard. Did he get an erection without realizing it? Do dogs ever go soft? Steve was getting even more curious about his new equipment when he was surprised to feel something start to push upward within him, and then he saw something pick poking out of what he&#39;d assumed to be his new penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; he said in recognition. He remembered seeing pink at the top of some dog dicks before, but only sometimes, and he&#39;d never paid it any mind. That must be what a dog&#39;s erection looked like! He wondered if he could keep it going. He toyed with the furry part some more, and more of the pink protrusion appeared. The brown furry part must be more like just a container for his new penis, which maybe just stays hard all the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would Angela say if she could see me now?&quot; he thought with a grin. They had stellar sex when she was alive, and she always called him an animal in the bedroom. Now the penis she could pleasure as though it were her own was no longer his. He really WAS an animal down there, from now on!<br />
<br />
The rock-hard penis that was already sizeable was now was sticking up higher and higher out of its sheath, vivid red and glistening with some kind of fluid. Curiosity guiding him, he reached up from his sheath and gave his moist penis a more direct touch. Pleasure surged back from it into Steven&#39;s body, almost making him cry out from the sensation. It stuck itself out even further, and Steve suddenly noticed a swollen mass starting to bulge out from the inside of his sheath. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, what&#39;s this?&quot; he asked to one, tugging down on the sheath a bit, and then the swollen bit popped out. &quot;What the heck?!&quot; He didn&#39;t have a glans anymore, but he did have ... whatever this round thing was. &quot;Dogs are freaking weird down there,&quot; he mused, but that didn&#39;t stop him from experimenting further. This was his first taste of his new labrador life, and he was going to savor it. He gently wrapped his hands around his bulge and groaned, rolling his eyes back in his head. The amount of sensation there dwarfed anything his old human dick was capable of. He grappled with his knot with both hands, binging himself on the sheer stimulation, teaching himself just how rough he could be with it and still feel good. He&#39;d barely even started, though, when he felt himself get pushed over the edge. He watched his spunk erupt over and over from his pointy shaft, stunned by the euphoria he was experiencing. He even found time to marvel at the size, shape and color of his fully extended phallus without coming down off of his high even a little. His orgasm had already lasted longer than it had with Angela or any human woman, and it felt far more intense than it had from any previous hand job. It kept on spurting for minutes on end, to the point that it even started scaring him a little, making him wonder how long he was going to be stuck in here cumming and whether he should try to get it to stop. Eventually, though, his torrent faded to a trickle, his contractions started to slow down, and his peak of pleasure started easing him back down the mountain.<br />
<br />
&quot;[Pant, pant, pant, pant] Whoa [pant, pant] dogs [pant] really have it [pant] figured out in the sex department,&quot; he managed to say to himself between breaths. He admired his new length and girth even as his bulbous knot softened and his shaft started sinking slowly down into his sheath. He finally calmed down and caught his breath enough to clean up while his erection kept going down. (How long is it going to take?!--he thought) At last, he stood up from a clean floor, and looked down in time to see the last centimeter of pink shaft get swallowed up by its furry container, safely tucked away where he could bring it out again sometime for another go. He grinned and it--and at the fur which had started spreading up his belly! It was past his navel now, almost to his chest. He looked down at his jeans again.<br />
<br />
[Well, it&#39;s not like I need clothes anymore,] he thought. [They were made for hiding something I no longer have.] He smiled at his sheath again, opened the door, and stepped out naked, waiting for whatever else the Chronivac had in store.</p>
