<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Misty looked from the levers then to Eric. He was still pounding on the enclosed shower. The mist continued to spray him lightly. The liquid was meant to polish his skin and make the wax stick easier to his body. Speaking of body, Misty found herself transfixed with Eric's body. <br />
<br />
He had a slim built from his time on the school's wrestling team. He had a washboard six pack and thick pecs. His arms were lean and his legs were like trunks. His brown bangs clung to his forehead. Misty was glad it was short. That relieved her the time of cutting it. His face still had a little of his boyish charm but it a bit of a square look. <br />
<br />
He looked handsome and Misty wouldn't change that. She pulled down the final lever and watched as the shower hose started to leak white liquid wax. <br />
<br />
Eric was so content breaking out that he didn't see the nozzle unleash a wave of hot liquid wax. The stream came down on his broad shoulders. He jumped and yelled at the feeling of the heat. It was like a hot shower. However, instead of feeling the water slide down his back, the wax clung to his shoulder, only sliding down to make room for more wax. <br />
<br />
He turned and tried to stop the shower, but found no handles at all. Wax poured into his chest and arm. He gritted his teeth, trying not to scream from the hot contact. He groaned in pain. He felt the wax land on his sensitive member and let out a painful scream, slipping to the floor. Wax fell onto his head, pouring down on him. <br />
<br />
Misty watched as Eric was covered in wax. She was amused at the fact that the boy would not stay down. She had seen him slip twice now. She could hear him scream and groan and moan as the wax continued to rain. A steamy cloud formed in the encloser and it bit of the steam leaked from the crack. It lingered in the air and Misty smelled it joyfully. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmm, Vanilla.&quot; she giggled. <br />
<br />
Inside, Eric felt like he should had stayed down. The thick wax had build up around his legs, locking him in a standing position. He was breathing hard. HE was getting hard. In two different ways. He felt embarrassed that in his final moments, he was getting as hard as the wax. The wax fell on him, getting thicker, harder, heavier. His chest heaved, his breathing sped. He yelled to be released, but closed his mouth as wax landed on his tongue. He felt tears slid down his waxy cheeks.<br />
<br />
Misty waited twenty minutes before pulling the lever up and stopping the hottest shower in Eric's life. Even though it had only been twenty minutes, it felt like ages for poor young Eric. He was breathing heavily through his nostrils. It was amazing his eyes didn't get waxed shut. He could just faintly move, his body covered too thickly in wax. <br />
<br />
The sprayers above him unleashed a thick and wet blast of an odd liquid that clung to the waxy body. He let out a whimper. The door opened and Misty looked at the chunky waxed Eric. She pulled him out and paced his immobilized body onto a rolling cart and rolled him away. Pulling out a knife and spoon, Misty began working on Eric. She worked expertly, carving off excess wax and molding his muscles. <br />
<br />
In ten minutes Eric was carved in wax. He held a pained expression on his face. One arm reached out, as if trying to grab something. His other arm was half curved, showing off a thick bicep. His abs was molded thick and his pecs were more defined. His thick legs were bent and his ass chicks were chiseled firm and tight. Misty was added a few inches to Eric's thick member. His face was more defined and last the boyish figures, making Eric look a little bit mature. His held was molded to make it seem as if he had no hair. His eyes stared out, occasionally starting back and forth.<br />
<br />
If it weren't for the white vanilla scented wax, Eric would look completely normal. A tear formed in his eye. HE felt Misty's hands move up and down his body as she smoothed him over. It sent a tinkling sensation through his entire body. Misty was right. It was alive. He could not move, could not breath, could not talk, and could not cry. But he could feel, he could hear, he could sense every touch. He was trapped in his body. In a wax body. HE was trapped alive. Arwin was right when he said he'd wish he was dead. <br />
<br />
Misty rolled Eric into a room. &quot;I had just finished with this one before I came for you. Now only three more. I'm sure those two older friends of yours would be nice, strapping statues. But that little one, well I do need another orphan for my Annie tribute.&quot; she said as she place Eric in front of a plasterized Ryan. Ryan looked like it was reaching out, screaming in pain. Ironically, Misty placed him in a way that made it look like ERic was reaching for his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll see you later.&quot; she said in a sing song voice. Eric was left there, staring into the lifeless eyes of his friend. HE cried.</p>
