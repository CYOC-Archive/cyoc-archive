<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Everyone ready?&quot; Adrian cautiously asked. The others nodded and he threw the die, 3. Either way he went he was going to land on truth or dare. He decided to travel north on the board. &quot;Alright. Truth or dare... Upon a success choose one of the following; an extra pound of muscle, five pounds of fat, 10% size added to your penis, an inch in height, or 5% bigger balls. Upon failure challengers are allowed to choose one of the following to take; 3 pounds of muscle, a quarter inch of your penis, a half inch in height or give you 3 pounds of fat.&quot; Adrian stared at the card for a second. &quot;Do I have different options?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul was first to jump in. &quot;Don&#39;t know. Don&#39;t care. Dare: Do 20 burpees.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; Adrian nearly roared. <br />
<br />
The rest of the group looked at him in a state of disbelief and anger. Paul simply shrugged it off. &quot;Look, if I can lose 3 pounds of fat. I&#39;m going to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got to be shitting me...&quot; Adrian gave a hundred yard stare into the distance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Them&#39;s the rules,&quot; Paul said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but I didn&#39;t realize you&#39;d be so cutthroat,&quot; Isaac muttered. &quot;We&#39;ve barely even started...&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul scoffed out a laugh. &quot;And I intend to win.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I can&#39;t do that,&quot; Adrian stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you forfeit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;SWEET!&quot; Paul cheered. The guy barely had any fat to lose as is, but watching his muscles somehow become even more defined was hard to believe. Paul&#39;s skin almost looked to start sealing itself against the hard muscles underneath his skin.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the opposite was happening for Adrian as his shirt grew even more tight against his burly frame. It was hard to notice at first when no one was looking, but now it was obvious that his sleeves were starting to pull against his shoulder and the bottom of his shirt rose just a bit higher up. He squirmed in his seat. Then looked to Brad.<br />
<br />
However, Isaac was the first to speak up. &quot;Dare: I dare you to slap Paul in the face.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a bit more glee than he should have, Adrian rounded up his open palm and swung it against Pual&#39;s face. That shut the other guy up without much effort. Tension rose in the game as Adrian announced, &quot;an inch in height.&quot; Slowly every one of his limbs grew just a bit longer. But the shirt he was wearing definitely was riding up his round belly now. From 6&#39;5&quot; to 6&#39;6&quot;, it was a bit of a difference.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell man!?&quot; Paul shouted, slamming his fist on the table. &quot;What the hell was that for?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were reveling in his pain too much! We&#39;re in this together! But the moment we turn against each other the worse everything&#39;s going to be for everyone!&quot; Isaac shouted back.<br />
<br />
The table went silent. Brad was the first to speak up. &quot;Truth: were you mad that Paul gave you three pounds of fat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Err... Yes?&quot; Adrian lied as a loud buzzer filled the silence. He cringed at the sound. But more because everyone was looking at him. &quot;Fine. No. I don&#39;t really care. 277 isn&#39;t that different than 280 alright? I mean I fluctuate between 275 and 285 almost every day. I just didn&#39;t like him laughing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, if I gave you 3 pounds of fat...&quot; Brad eased the question in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go on...&quot; Adrian answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking sweet,&quot; Brad smiled as he added, &quot;Three pounds of fat to Adrian.&quot; He looked at his body and flexed his arms watching his skin tighten against them.  It was the opposite for Adrian again as he gained another three pounds of fat.<br />
<br />
Paul reached for the die and rolled a 4. &quot;How about another physical challenge,&quot; he said. Picking up the card, he read it. &quot;Become a hero. 100 pushups, 100 sit ups, 100 squats without a break. Upon each exercise success gain 5 pounds of muscle. Upon each failure lose an inch in height.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t there supposed to be a 10km run too?&quot; Isaac asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t push it,&quot; Paul warned. However, as he stood in the space where Adrian had moved the couch, he paused. It almost looked like his legs were shaking. Though, doing the 200 squats earlier seemed to still be making his leg workouts a bit weary. &quot;Alright,&quot; Paul breathed as he dropped down to a push up position and started pumping them out. They were surprisingly fast. Each one he lowered all the way to the ground and right back up counting it out loud. His triceps started to bulge as blood was pumping into them. He didn&#39;t slow in the slightest.<br />
<br />
Once he chanted, &quot;100,&quot; he flipped over onto his back, removing his sweat stained shirt and went on to doing sit ups. Even if high reps of sit ups weren&#39;t as good as maintaining a good diet or consistent lower rep ranges, he still pumped them out just like the pushups. Maybe a bit slower as now two parts of his body demanded the oxygen enriched blood. He fought through the pain, groaning after each rep. Though, the abs he cherished so much really did start to show off in the dim light of the room. Or maybe it was the soft glow of his glistening gently sprinkled on his body.<br />
<br />
He chanted another, &quot;100,&quot; and tried to stand up. &quot;Shit...&quot; he cursed as his body needed a bit of a break. However, a ticking sound filled the room. &quot;Shit. Shit. Shit,&quot; Paul cursed over and over again as he tried to pump out the squats. They weren&#39;t nearly as well done as the pushups or sit ups, but he continued to force them out. However, his legs locked up and his body fell over onto the couch when he hit 34. &quot;Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.&quot;<br />
<br />
At 6&#39;2&quot; and 195ish pounds, he always did look stunning. However, watching that extra ten pounds of muscle pour onto his body all at once made him really look like a god. His shoulders broadened significantly and his chest grew out in front of him. Even his shorts tightened against his ass as thick cheeks filled the much looser fabric. However, maybe it was also because he was shrinking down to 6&#39;1&quot;. <br />
<br />
Paul climbed onto the couch and did his best to rest. &quot;Damn it...&quot; he stared at the sky as though he&#39;d failed, despite doing far better than the average person. &quot;You guys can keep playing. Fuck...&quot; his breaths were heavy and uncontrolled as he nearly pumped out 300 reps of different exercises in under 10 minutes. <br />
<br />
It was now Brad&#39;s turn, and he rolled a 1. The only way he could go was forward, and he landed on the &#39;ears&#39; space. He picked up the die again, rolling another &#39;1.&#39; &quot;Act it out...&quot; he picked up the card. &quot;Film a video for one of your paying customers in front of the group. Upon success gain $1000 upon failure lose a very valued customer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad felt his phone vibrate. He had a text message. &#39;Hey man. I know you&#39;re on vacation, but could you get some kind of chocolatey thing and pretend that you bumped into me, then step on it and beg for my forgiveness while eating it off the floor completely naked?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was the request?&quot; Isaac tried to look at the message, but Brad pulled it away as fast as he could. &quot;What? We&#39;ve all got to see it anyways...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...&quot; Brad took a bit to clear his throat. &quot;It&#39;s probably better if I just do it...&quot; He started pulling off his shirt. &quot;Please don&#39;t judge me...&quot; Then dropped his shorts and underwear. Despite being completely naked, he stood up like he was still completely clothed. &quot;Follow me... And don&#39;t say anything till I&#39;m done. Okay? Just grab a beer and pretend to drink it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have to?&quot; Paul groaned.<br />
<br />
Adrian took the initiative and picked Paul up, tossing him over his shoulder and then setting him down on a chair in the kitchen. The group watched as Brad raised his phone high up into the air and tilted down at him. He opened one of Adrian&#39;s mini chocolate cakes and a beer. Brad took a deep breath and hit record.<br />
<br />
It was surprising watching the jock&#39;s face twist from such a neutral stance to a huge smile. He hit record. None of the guys expected to hear the dumb jock voice as he started speaking. &quot;Hey Claire! So sorry you couldn&#39;t make it tonight. Me and the boys are having plenty of fun. No girls though so you don&#39;t have to worry. But we&#39;re--&quot; He paused and pretended to knock into someone and spill the beer. &quot;Oh shit. Sorry Henry. I didn&#39;t see you there. Oh. You&#39;re cake? I&#39;m sorry man. There&#39;s-- Right. That one&#39;s yours.&quot; <br />
<br />
Brad dropped the cake down onto the floor, filmed it and then put his foot down into it. The chocolate frosting and cream center smooshed between his toes. His large muscular foot continued to work the food into the floor. &quot;Wait! Henry! Please!&quot; Brad went down onto all fours and positioned the camera to where it could see his entire body. His butt was high in the air as his face pressed against the floor. He looked at the flattened cake and then back at the camera. &quot;Please Henry. It was an accident.&quot; he begged again but fell silent. &quot;Oh. Right we can&#39;t waste food now, can we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Slowly he rolled his tongue over the floor and at the cake off of it. He made sure to only use his tongue and licked it clean. Once almost all of it was up, he grabbed the camera and turned it off. Then sent the video to Henry. He cringed as other three guys stared at him in disbelief. Brad reached behind his ears to rub the side of his face only to find that they weren&#39;t there anymore. A pain ran through his skull as his ears climbed to the top of his head. They turned into points and then grew tall up into proper wolf ears. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit man...&quot; Brad groaned as he rubbed his new ears. Brown, white and gray fur covered the newly shaped appendage and some of it drifted over into his real hair as well. &quot;That shit hurts!&quot; the large triangle shaped ears flickered as new sounds started to fill them. He felt like his hearing had improved. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you really just eat that off the floor!?&quot; Paul was the first to speak up.<br />
<br />
&quot;No more questions,&quot; Brad said as he went back to the dining room table. He pulled up his shorts and put on his shirt again. &quot;It&#39;s Isaac&#39;s turn!&quot; he called. Frustration was running through him as he saw that he completely lost all service again as soon as the &#39;thank you&#39; was sent.<br />
<br />
Isaac sprinted back to the table, but Paul raised his arms up to be carried by Adrian again. The big lug did so and softly placed Paul back into his seat. Isaac picked up the die and rolled it. &quot;Another four!?&quot; It meant he could go south and land on feet or north and land on upper body fur. However, since the other guys were all grouped together, he didn&#39;t exactly want to know what a challenge was. Or at least not be the first to participate in one. He chose feet and rolled the die again, 3. &quot;Truth or Dare...&quot; He drew a card and was surprised that it said something a bit different. &quot;Choose one player to play truth or dare with. Upon success, gain the feet attribute. You are allowed to play this game with the other two players however are not required to. Upon success, gain one of the following of your choice; 3 pounds of muscle, 6 pounds of fat, 2 inches in height, 10% bigger dick, 5% bigger balls. Upon failure the other player is allowed to give or take anything they desire about you. Dares are required to be possible or else you automatically win.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac looked at the other guys. &quot;Adrian,&quot; he spoke. &quot;Truth or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;&#39;Me?!&quot; Adrian said stupidly as he looked at the other guys. &quot;Why me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause he helped you out earlier and is calling for the favor back,&quot; Paul said.<br />
<br />
Isaac didn&#39;t answer. He just looked at Adrian for the word. &quot;Dare,&quot; Adrian said. &quot;Play the game with both Paul and Brad too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what?!&quot; Isaac stared in disbelief. &quot;I gave you an easy one!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You also stole my jocks,&quot; Adrian glared back.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re on that still!?&quot; Isaac slammed his fist on the table. Paul had the biggest grin on his face while Brad smiled a bit more reserved. &quot;WELL?!&quot; Isaac shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?&quot; Brad asked. &quot;Truth, don&#39;t just say, &#39;I don&#39;t know,&#39; how many and what type of items did you steal from us, best of your knowledge.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aww... Fuck man... I don&#39;t-- Let&#39;s see. You,&quot; pointing at Brad. He started counting on his fingers for each item. &quot;4 jocks, 3 pairs of socks, a pair of shoes, one jersey and a couple of pairs of underwear. Paul: 1 jock, 1 pair of socks, 4 pairs of shoes, and one undershirt. Adrian: 3 jocks, 3 socks, 4 jerseys, 6 undershirts specifically after workouts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That many...?!&quot; Adrian stared astounded. &quot;Why all my undershirts?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Big, meaty, sweaty, man. Found a little dude who just kept asking for different colors,&quot; Isaac shrugged. There was an arrogance as he spoke, almost like he was bragging about it.<br />
<br />
Paul picked up on it. &quot;Truth. How many were for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac felt himself stammer. &quot;For me?&quot; Paul nodded seeing the sweat drip down his forehead. &quot;From the group?&quot; Paul nodded again. &quot;Uhh...  A jock from each of you.&quot; The group gasped, followed by angry looks. &quot;It&#39;s not to smell! Just to uhh... Nevermind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you &#39;never mind.&#39; Spill,&quot; Paul pointed despite being weak from his workouts. <br />
<br />
&quot;I just like wearing them. You guys are all bigger than me and it&#39;s kind of fun putting them on...&quot; Issaac admitted. He let out a painful groan as his face shot upwards. Loud cracking could be heard as the bones in Isaac&#39;s feet started to change. Every part of his foot started to grow larger, easily overfilling the human made shoe that he was wearing. He could feel his nails shifting. Instead of being flat they started to grow upwards, sharpening into claws until they were able to cut through the fabric of the shoe. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my--! Fuck!&quot; Isaac cried out as the shoes started to tear apart as his feet kept getting wider. He could feel his foot elongating. The bone in the center pulling further back as the front of his foot grew wider. Strange callouses formed on the bottom of his foot and each of his toes. They were rough but strangely sensitive to the temperature of the floor and its texture. He slowly leaned back as he felt the transformation slow. &quot;Fuck man...&quot; he stared at his lion feet. Soft tawny colored covered up to his ankles. However, his ankles were no longer on the floor. Instead, they were raised up into the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; he stood up feeling his weight naturally to the front of his feet. His paw pads easily carried his weight but were twice the size his foot had been. The remnants of his shoes hung around his ankles as the knots in his laces hadn&#39;t come undone. He took a few steps. It was completely natural, but almost like he was wearing heavy work boots. &quot;Crazy...&quot; he continued to move almost like he was trying on new shoes. Even stranger was when Brad stood up, they were almost eye to eye. What had been a good 3 inches in height difference was now less than one. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is crazy,&quot; Brad said. He tried to push Isaac.<br />
<br />
Isaac&#39;s body reacted like normal, however his massive claws dug into the wood floor to help stabilize his body. &quot;What the hell man!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wanted to see,&quot; Brad laughed. &quot;You still have two more by the way...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right!&quot; Isaac went back to the card. &quot;2 inches in height and 3 pounds of muscle.&quot; He stretched to the sky, feeling his new height of 6&#39;5&quot; and then feeling the muscle build on his body. Even though he was a bit taller, he also looked far skinnier with the added height.</p>
