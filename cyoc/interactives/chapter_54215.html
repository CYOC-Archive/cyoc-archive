<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The bell suddenly rang out clearly through the room, and the two of us 
let go of each other in surprise. He gave a little chuckle as he 
turned to me, and I did the same as I looked back up to him. "I guess 
we lost track of time, didn't we?"
<BR><BR>
"Er... Yeah. I guess we've been a bit distracted, haven't we? 
<BR><BR>
"A bit." I chuckled as I picked up his shirt before tossing it at him, 
it landing over his head. "You'd better get that on before you end up 
'distracting' everybody in school." It took him a moment to get it, 
but he gave a quiet laugh as well, his voice deep and rumbling as he 
did. 
<BR><BR>
"I don't know if that's enough to help." I smiled as I watched him 
pull the shirt on, it tight around his arms as he struggled to pull 
them through the sleeves. His clothes had grown somewhat with him, but 
his body seemed to cling to the fabric as he pulled it along, and with 
the way lines in his clothing seemed to appear as he pulled it down 
his chest and over his abs, he may has well have been shirtless, for 
all the good that it did hiding his body. Everybody already gave him a 
few glances whenever he was around, but now, there was no way he'd 
avoid getting stares from anybody that could see him. 
<BR><BR>
I shook my head a little, trying not to stare any more than I already 
was. "Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time later, too. I need to 
take care of something first, but I'll see you in class soon enough." 
We both looked at each other for a moment, and I hesitated before 
leaning in and giving him a quick kiss to his cheek. I could see him 
blush for just a moment before he suddenly pushed his head forwards, 
returning the favor before he started to head out. 
<BR><BR>
"I'll see you soon, then! Don't take too long!"
<BR><BR>
I had decided to give enough time for him to head out, and would wait 
until I was sure nobody was around. It only took a minute before I had 
heard his footsteps fade. I shook my head a little bit, knowing they 
were a lot heavier than when he had come in. At least it would be easy 
enough to keep track of him now, but that didn't mean that there 
weren't any new problems. 
<BR><BR>
I pulled the eight ball from my pocket, looking at the window and 
speaking clearly to it."Nino! We need to talk!" 
<BR><BR>
"About what?"
<BR><BR>
I turned around, seeing her standing behind me, a smile on her face as 
she looked at me. 
<BR><BR>
"About Rasler! I didn't wish for that! I said I <i>would</i> wish for 
him to be happy, not that I actually wish for it!"
<BR><BR>
She tilted her head a little as she looked at me. "I see. I may have 
misunderstood your words. However, as a rule, I try to grant wishes 
whenever I can see the intent for it, even without the specific words. 
And, as far as I could tell, you certainly intended for your friend to 
be happy."
<BR><BR>
Okay, at least I hadn't tried to get him maimed or something by 
accident this time. It was a bit of an improvement, but even so, it 
wasn't exactly the best wish. With the way things were...
<BR><BR>
"Fine, then. What, exactly, did you do to him?"
<BR><BR>
"Why, I did precisely what you asked me for, master. Or, more 
accurately, what he asked for. Part of that was to be stronger. Of 
course, I wouldn't want him to simply see himself growing that way. 
Life would be much too tricky if everybody saw it, so I made sure to 
put in the usual memory tricks. He'll be the only one to vaguely 
remember being his normal size. However, he wished to be stronger..." 
I heard her giggle, and the sound of it just continued to aggravate 
me. "Such a delightfully vague wish! There were plenty of things I 
could've done. Turned him into an animal, made him too thick to 
move... But then I wouldn't get to watch you two go at it!"
<BR><BR>
"Go at it? What's that supposed to..." I paused for a moment before I 
could feel redness starting to appear into my cheeks, already able to 
guess what was coming."
<BR><BR>
"Master, you had wished for him to be happy and to get what he wants. 
He said that he to be stronger, but that was just one thing. Wasn't it 
clear enough that he wanted you? That he liked being that size, but it 
was since you liked it too? After that, I just <i>had</i> to get you 
two together properly!"
<BR><BR>
I stammered as I heard her say it. "You... You made me attracted to-"
<BR><BR>
Nino only giggled mischievously as she shook her head. "Oh, I didn't 
need to do any magic for that. Once you made him start talking, I 
didn't need to do anything else! If I wanted to, I probably could've 
given you a prod in the right direction, but it was so much more 
amusing to watch you two mumbling to each other to get it out in the 
open!"
<BR><BR>
"Great. I make one wish to hear the truth, and then I make him spill 
everything. Just how could-"
<BR><BR>
"No, no, no!" Nino just kept on laughing as she looked at me. "You 
wished that he would tell you the truth if you wanted it. How much did 
you want him to keep talking after you heard him start?" I tried to 
respond, but my mouth had to close as I looked at the floor. After he 
had started to talk, I certainly didn't <i>want</i> him to keep on 
admitting something like that. I had wanted him to give some excuse, 
so he wouldn't make life horrible for himself. 
<BR><BR>
"You mean, he could've stopped anytime? Then, why wouldn't he?"
<BR><BR>
"Boys like you really are clueless, aren't they? I've seen it far too 
many times. Always so ignorant when someone confesses to them…" Her 
laugh was really getting annoying by now, but I did my best to bear it 
as she shook her head before turning back to me. "Once you made him 
start talking, he didn't have any reason to stop anymore. There's 
nothing keeping from saying the truth if he wants to, and once he had 
said that you guys were more than friends, he didn't want to stop. You 
simply gave him the nudge that he needed to admit everything. Just 
because you were too nervous to admit there was something between you 
two doesn't mean he was."
<BR><BR>
"Well, of course I didn't want to say that! This kind of thing could 
ruin him! People don't all think this kind of thing is okay, and I'm 
not going to mess up his life again! I mean, he could get kicked off 
of every team he's on, and everybody could think that he's-" 
<BR><BR>
"You realize, of course, how easily you could wish for people to be 
accepting? For him to stay on his teams without trouble? For it to 
seem normal?" I paused as I heard her speak, turning to look at my 
feet as I heard her speak about it so obviously. "You really are 
clueless about it, aren't you... Him being accepted was probably never 
a problem. You just tried to find an excuse for why you'd be able to 
get away from it, didn't you?" She giggled again. By now, I didn't 
know how in the world any sound could be as annoying as her chuckling, 
and I had to clench my palms to try to restrain myself. She was taking 
way too much pleasure in pointing out what an awkward guy I was. "Oh, 
don't worry... You wished for him to be happy, and while he didn't 
talk about it, I'm sure he has acceptance in his mind, too. I make 
sure to be very thorough with wishes... I get to have more fun with 
them that way! In fact, this one still has so much potential..." 
<BR><BR>
"What? You're still-"
<BR><BR>
"You can see for yourself. Should you get to your class, too?" I 
blinked, but the moment my eyes were open, she was gone again. I 
wanted to shout at her, but I was interrupted when I saw others 
starting to enter the locker room. I quickly passed by them, eager to 
avoid any awkward questions about why I was there, heading back to my 
classroom, and back to where Rasler was again.</p>
