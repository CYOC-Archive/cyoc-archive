<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One of the t-shirts catches your eye.  It&#39;s a black t-shirt with a graphic of a human spine and ribcage, meant to look as though one could see the wearer&#39;s skeleton.  You&#39;ve seen similar t-shirts before, especially around Halloween.  <i> Maybe it makes a person see-through, </i> you think to youself with a incredulous snort.  You can&#39;t believe you are indulging in this sort of fantasy, but then again, you did change gender completely not ten minutes ago.  Maybe you shouldn&#39;t be so easygoing about this.<br />
<br />
Still, you want to find out what more of the t-shirts do, and this seems like a good place to start.  After all, at least the pattern on this t-shirt gives you some clue as to what it might do.  Considering many of the other t-shirts are just plain colors with no patterns or graphics at all, trying something like this might be the least-risky option of the lot.  You eye the t-shirt warily, but then pick it up and pull it over your head.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
For a moment, you are not aware of any changes.  However, after an instant, you begin to notice subtle things.  You no longer feel the slight breeze from the air-conditioner vent.  In fact, you don&#39;t feel anything, hot or cold.  You also see a bit of black along the edges of your peripheral vision, and realize that you are wearing a hood.  Looking down, you find you are dressed in a completely black robe.  You are a bit disappointed, since it seems like the only thing that changed was your clothes.  You walk over to the bathroom mirror to get a look a yourself, and raise a hand to pull back the hood of your robe as you do so. <br />
<br />
Staring back at you is a bleach-white grinning skull.  You raise your hand to your face, and see that it too is made up of nothing but bones.  You are not certain how the bones are held together, or even how you can see, since where normally would reside eyeballs are nothing but black voids.  &quot;Whoa,&quot; you say inadverently, and are surprised not only by the movement of the skull&#39;s lower jaw, but by the breathy voice that exits.  You still cannot believe what you see, so you reach down and lift up the bottom of the robe, revealing two skeletal legs and feet.  You lift a leg, and can even stick a bony finger between the two bones of your lower leg.  Standing normally again, you pull the hood back up over your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I look just like the Grim Reaper,&quot; you say out loud in the eerie voice you still don&#39;t know how you are producing.  You hold up your arm in a pose, and close your hand as though you were holding something.  &quot;All I would need is a....&quot;<br />
<br />
Before you can finish your sentence, your bony hand closes about something that was definitely not there before.  You know it appeared out of nowhere, but it is most assuredly in your grasp now:  a tall, curved, wickedly-sharp scythe.  You are so startled, you open your hand without thinking, then wince at the loud clatter you know is coming when the scythe hits the floor.  However, no sound meets your ears...well, skull.  Instead, the scythe is gone as if it never existed.  You wonder what happened for a moment, then raise your hand experimentally.  You move your hand into position as though you were clutching a scythe, and begin to close it.  As though it were always there, the scythe appears in your hand again.  After a few more tries, you find you can summon and rid yourself of the scythe quite easily.  It is amusing, but you&#39;re not sure of its practicality.  After all, it&#39;s not like you&#39;re going to cut someone with it.  You make the scythe disappear one more time, then turn to more pressing matters.<br />
<br />
You are not certain how to remove the t-shirt, since there is only a robe where the t-shirt once was.  You reach down and pull the entire robe over your skull, but find that all that changes is now you can see your entire skeleton.  You begin to panic a bit, but you put the robe back on.  After all, you were wearing a t-shirt, not a long robe.  How would you remove a t-shirt that&#39;s no longer there?  You reach down to the waist of the robe and run your bony fingers along it, looking for a hole, a crease, anything.  Amazingly, your fingers slip under a lip of fabric that you cannot see, and you quickly yank it upwards.  You are left staring in the mirror at your normal, human self, clutching the t-shirt in one hand.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The next day, you go to college as yourself...without the blue t-shirt.  Your classes are different today, so you don&#39;t have to worry about the people you met yesterday, and you are not sure if you want to go through college as a guy.  After class, you head to the nearby bank to open an account.  Everything seems normal, without the craziness you experienced yesterday.  You settle down in the office to wait while one of the bank employees retrieves the necessary paperwork from the back room.  Just as you nearly nod off in boredom, you hear a shout.<br />
<br />
&quot;EVERYBODY DOWN ON THE GROUND!  IF YOU MOVE, I WILL SHOOT YOU!&quot; a voice booms out.  Since the lobby is not completely visible from where you are sitting, you slide down under the desk and sidle over to the door.  You peek around the edge to see a man in a ski-mask and sunglasses waiving about a gun.  You cannot believe this is happening, but you are grateful you don&#39;t seem to have been noticed.  You see the man turn back to the teller, and you reach in your bag for your cell phone to call the police.  The robber appears nervous, and shouts at the teller to hurry up.  While you dig for your phone, your hand brushes against something soft.  It is the skeleton t-shirt, which you brought with you on a whim.  You do not pay it any mind, however, more concerned with alerting the authorities.<br />
<br />
At that moment, you catch movement out of the corner of your eye.  A toddler escapes his mother&#39;s grasp and goes running across the lobby, reaching for a toy which ended up on the other side of the room in all the confusion.  The mother, heedless of the danger, goes after the child, which catches the robber&#39;s attention.  You see him begin to turn, almost as though it were happening in slow-motion.  The thought flashes through your mind that you have no weapon with which to stop the robber, but almost as quickly, you realize that you do.  Without considering the consequences, you jam the skeleton t-shirt over your head.<br />
<br />
Moving faster than humanly possible, you find yourself behind the robber, your huge scythe clutched in your skeletal hands.  Not hesitating for an instant, you bring down the scythe with all your might.  It passes through the body of the robber from his right shoulder to his left hip like a warm knife through butter, with no resistance, even against bone.  You cringe inwardly for the gruesome scene you know is coming as the body falls apart, and avert your skull&#39;s gaze.<br />
<br />
However, you hear nothing.  No gunshot, no spurt of blood, no screams.  As you look back up, the robber falls to his knees silently and then collapses on the cold tile floor.  It doesn&#39;t appear as though he was cut, and even his clothes are still intact.  However, he is motionless, and somehow, you know that he is dead.  You look up at the mother and child which you saved as they clutch each other, wondering how you are going to explain what happened.  They, on the other hand, appear oblivious to your existence.  Only once you hear the bank alarm go off and see the security guard go rushing by you to knock the gun out of the dead robber&#39;s hand do you realize that no one can see you.  Although shocked by the events that have unfolded, you make your way back to the office, remove the t-shirt, stuff it in your bag, and exit the bank with the other victims.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;...amazing footage we have here of a local bank robbery that nearly went horribly wrong.  As you can see, the gun-wielding robber turns, noticing the mother running after the child, but as he raises his gun to shoot her, he drops to the ground.  When police arrive, they find the robber dead, and thankfully, no one injured.  If this isn&#39;t a miracle, Bob, I don&#39;t know what is.  Now back to you at the station...&quot;<br />
<br />
You rewind and watch the news footage again, frame by frame.  However, there is no robed figure in black in any of the shots.  Since you were in the office and out of camera range, no one noticed your disappearance and reappearance.  You eye the skeleton t-shirt, which you tossed on the couch when you returned.  This was definitely more than the mere sex-change the blue t-shirt provided.  The t-shirt had allowed you to kill with impunity, as you were certain it was your scythe that had stopped the robber.  You wonder what you should do with such an awesome power.  You pick up the t-shirt, and after some consideration, decide to...</p>
