<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty hadn&#39;t wanted Dustin to freak in school so Dustin&#39;s perception of the extent of the changes was limited for now. Once Dustin exceeds 18, he&#39;ll be a teachers assistant and act as such, Once he becomes 24 he&#39;ll be a P.E. teacher and an assistant coach with degrees and teaching experience. 28 and then he&#39;ll just be Coach. Dustin will continue aging and growing more muscular to maintain a status of being in the top 10% of boys/men his age for total muscle mass compensating for total weight and height. To help Ty keep track of the changes, Dustin will have a Starbucks coffee thermos when he turns into a TA, which will then become a generic red plastic thermos after becoming a PE teacher, and then settle into a fancy metal thermos when he becomes full coach.<br />
<br />
Dustin&#39;s first transformation was enormous but he barely noticed it. Ty estimated that he was somewhere slightly above average to begin with, to 90% meaning out of the surrounding 10,000 17 year old males, only 1k  were stronger and more muscular than him. His second transformation was less striking because he had already been in the top 10% so although he changed, it wasn&#39;t drastic. <br />
<br />
Ty had set a number of triggers for Dustin to change and by the time lunch began Dustin was carrying a Starbucks mug and looking like an Olympian. During lunch Dustin triggered another change and Ty watched as his Thermos turned bright red. Dustin&#39;s lunch seemed to be cut short as he finished his meal rapidly and headed to the gym drinking greedily from his revamped coffee thermos. Ty snickered and made it so the coffee would never get too cold for Dustin&#39;s liking, nor will it ever be less than 3/4th full.<br />
<br />
As Ty climbed onto the bus at the end of the school day, he tapped into both his old and new memories and knew Coach Dustin had football practice, as Ty had intended. The top three topics relating to Coach Dustin were whether or not he did drugs to get that huge, how much coffee he actually consumed, and how old he actually was. Ty chuckled to himself while &quot;remembering&quot; this, Dustin was definitely using but Ty never considered himself a drug before, and Dustin&#39;s coffee thermos was never more than arms length from him and nobody ever saw him refill it. Ty made a few more wishes mostly concerning his familiarity with driving and recognition of &quot;his&quot; vehicle when practice is over.<br />
<br />
Reaching home Ty began working on homework and waited for his plan to come together. He toiled over it in the back of his mind and made the last of his setup wishes. On Dustin&#39;s way home after practice he slowly realized more and more what had happened to him throughout the day. Despite his overwhelming urge to run away Dustin was unable to bring himself to drive in a random direction and instead rapidly went through all stages of grief, seeing both realities simultaneously, like Ty, like Ty intended. <br />
<br />
Coming to terms with his hulking body, his massive appetite, his career, being an authority figure and in some cases an unattainable sex object over his former fiends, and his obvious gray hair... within 45 minutes he was headed back home and was having a hard time trying to not psychoanalyze his former self from the perspective of his new self, which was also what Ty wanted.<br />
<br />
As Dustin pulled in the driveway on autopilot, lost in thought, Mark who was talking to June in the kitchen yelped as his pants fell down followed by &quot;Oh my God, What the Fucks ha...&quot; and a few seconds later a 16 year old Mark said, &quot;Okay, dinner in 30, thanks Mom&quot; and walked into the living room to join Ty at the TV.<br />
<br />
Dustin entered through the front door and was greeted by Mark&#39;s cry of &quot;Hey Dad!&quot; to which he instinctively responded &quot;Hello son!&quot; freezing immediately in panic. Ty added, &quot;Welcome home Dad.&quot; Again he replied, &quot;Thank you Tyler.&quot; and Ty grinned to the TV knowing what happened next.<br />
<br />
&quot;Missed you Huunnn!&quot; came June&#39;s call from the kitchen. Dustin was immediately entranced and found himself gazing upon a goddess in human form.  &quot;Oh babe, I missed you too! So much!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop! God! You guys are so gross!&quot; Mark screeched a minute later from the doorway of the kitchen watching his parents passionately make out and rapidly moving towards having sex on the countertop.<br />
<br />
Dustin was throbbing and June was willing but now was not the time... &quot;Soon&quot; she whispered desperately making Dustin feel new old things.<br />
<br />
All Dustin could do in response was grunt and stumble out of the kitchen with a gulp while nearly shaking with lust. Disoriented he meandered to the living room and stared toward the TV just trying to process through the overwhelming lust he felt for his own mom and figure that whole debacle out.<br />
<br />
Mark was still in the kitchen helping to set the table,  June was making sure dinner dinner was okay. Ty turned to Dustin and came clean, &quot;So, you&#39;re muscular, attractive, rule the high school, are passionate with your wife, have a secure job, and a solid loving home, you must be overjoyed to have achieved everything you wanted from when you were a 16 year old kid!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!?&quot; was all Dustin could say. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you always made a big deal about how strong you were, how you were taller than me, and how you were respected at school so when I realized I could alter reality, I decided it was petty to seek revenge. So instead I decided I&#39;d forgive you and help you achieve what you felt was so important.&quot; Ty said with a smile hiding the insidious roots. &quot;Also, you always admired your father and sought his approval, <br />
so now you ARE the father... only with a better sex life and more fulfilling job.&quot; Ty grinned earnestly from ear to ear knowing this will cause immediate torture...<br />
<br />
&quot;You... did this... caused this???&quot; Dustin asked in shock and confusion.<br />
<br />
Ty smiled and nodded his head. &quot;Yes Dustin. Honestly, it hurt me that you made me feel inferior for not being as muscular and tall as you or others, but I realized that you were attacking your own sense of inferiority. So now you ARE the biggest, the students who call you coach love you, and you are respected among the faculty. I&#39;m so glad that you&#39;re finally happy Dustin.&quot; Ty went in for a hug and Dustin was profoundly aware of his erection which Ty seemed completely unaware...<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, so Ty I&#39;m really attracted to June...&quot; Dustin started trying to point out that she was still his mom to half his brain.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know! Isn&#39;t it great? Most guys set their type in high school and are forever attracted to 20 year olds as their &#39;ideal&#39;... but not you!! I made sure June will always be more attractive than anyone else to you. Even her twin would be imperfect compared to her! It&#39;s just like you mentioned over the phone a few nights ago to your friends, &#39;passionately fuck her brains out!&#39; you said... Well, now however she looks, she will always be he definition of beauty to you and you&#39;ll be able to.&quot; Ty smiled as Dustin tried to stop the horror from creeping onto his face...<br />
<br />
&quot;She isn&#39;t who I... I haven&#39;t had a chance to.. I don&#39;t just want one... I&#39;ve never been with...&quot; Dustin tripped over his own words looking more desperate with each failed attempt and realizing how important this conversation was. The complex and contradicting feelings about his mom/wife surely didn&#39;t help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I get it, you&#39;re nervous about your big performance later tonight... well it&#39;ll come to you naturally but I understand wanting to feel like you know what you&#39;re doing. I&#39;ve got you buddy.&quot; Ty smiled knowing how this wish he planned will be interpreted and closed his eyes. &quot;I wish... that Dustin would remember in detail... a rich history of at least 100 relationships of varying length and intensity that resulted in at least... 2, but possibly more consensual sexual interactions... as well as a complete history encompassing his relationship with June in this reality and an additional 10 one night stands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin&#39;s face showed relief until June was mentioned and it quickly became worried then horrified and as the wish ended Dustin&#39;s face went blank and his eyes rolled toward the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Ty didn&#39;t specify relationships with females, nor did he limit Dustin to one relationship at a time or even with one person per sexual experience.<br />
<br />
Dustin was blasted with memories of orgies, flings, booty calls, short lived passionate relationships, slow burn relationships, and a number of longer relationships that at the time he thought might be &quot;the one.&quot; Dustin had always been completely straight and moderately homophobic but now had countless memories of gay relationships some of which were serious. He remembers losing friends once they found him in a gay relationship, and being in public was with a male partner was begging to be judged. Dustin was experiencing being on the receiving side of homophobia and was not prepared. On top of this confusion, almost every inch of the house was a place he remembered having sex with June. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dinner!&quot; June called.</p>
