<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This is such bullshit!&quot; I yelled at the top of my lungs. &quot;They can&#39;t just fucking do this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I think they can. It&#39;s called martial law,&quot; Jacob countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what? The president can just say it&#39;s a thing now and suddenly democracy is out the window?&quot; I asked, incredulous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there&#39;s a little more red tape around it, but yeah, pretty much,&quot; the blonde man answered. He readjusted his glasses once more. &quot;It&#39;s really only meant for cases when all the government&#39;s moving parts would make the spread of a disease worse. And if the news is being serious, it might be.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked away from Jacob and back at the television screen where the reporter kept going with a strong but slightly fearful voice. He was trying to keep his voice but everyone could hear it quiver from time to time. I couldn&#39;t blame him. This virus sounded scary as fuck! Apparently some mad man wanted to &#39;make the world a better place&#39; or some load of crap like that, and released a virus meant to &#39;change the way we live life for the hotter&#39;. No one was sure what that meant, but based off of the findings in his apartment, it was clear the virus was related to sex in some way. Multiple modes of transmission, rare if any immunities, etcetera, etcetera. The result was that we&#39;re now living in a dictatorship and they&#39;ve separated us from our girlfriends. My thoughts kept shifting to Lisa. We weren&#39;t able to see each other through all the commotion leading up to our lockdown. A police officer just came into our classroom and ordered us to go to this dorm. When our professor tried to stop him, the officer actually pulled a gun on him! Meanwhile, Lisa still hasn&#39;t even texted me. Each passing minute has been making me more and more worried. What if they pulled a gun on her? What if it wasn&#39;t just a threat? I couldn&#39;t help but fear the worst.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still though, they won&#39;t even tell us where the girls are. Lisa could be in danger and wouldn&#39;t even know it!&quot; I cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude cheer up. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s fine. We just gotta stay positive!&quot; Chase replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up fag. I&#39;m not gonna listen to your pep talk bullshit today,&quot; I stated. Fuck, it was like the guy couldn&#39;t help it. Just cause Chase was student council president at the University, he always tried to give himself that &#39;positive leader&#39; vibe. Sure, it worked on some girls, but it sure as hell wasn&#39;t gonna work on me. That, plus his slicked back brown hair and ignorant smile. I would&#39;ve punched him in the face had the guy not been so buff.<br />
<br />
Chase just brushed me off as Taylor put a hand on my shoulder. &quot;Relax dude, it&#39;ll be fine. They&#39;re probably just separating the guys and girls for a little so that they can find cure. Plus, it definitely didn&#39;t look like anyone was infected from that initial meeting we had. We just gotta wait it out. And I&#39;m sure Lisa will contact you. She&#39;s probably just busy at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at Taylor, my best friend, gave me a stern but reassuring stare. Honestly, he felt more like a leader than Chase most of the time, but the redhead wouldn&#39;t go for a leadership role. Said it didn&#39;t suit him, or some crap. I couldn&#39;t believe him on that, but his words still calmed me down a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;So chill. You too Daniel. Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t notice that worried look on your face. We&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Taylor assured.<br />
<br />
I looked over at Daniel, who was quietly sitting on Taylor&#39;s new bed. He was the quietest and shyest of our group, but his face showed more than enough about what he was feeling, even with the black bang that slightly covered his eye. Sometimes we honestly felt bad for the guy. He had a hard life, and sometimes I forget how easily distrubed he gets.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess your right. Sorry,&quot; I conceded. No point in worrying them anymore than they probably already were.<br />
<br />
Apparently, my remark was a good sign, because the moment I said the familiar tune of my phone went off. It was Lisa! I quickly grabbed my phone and jumped out of the room. Answering it as quick as I could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa! Are you okay? Are they hurting you? Are you in a dorm too? Where are you?&quot; I spewed out the moment I closed the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, I&#39;m fine. Relax,&quot; Lisa replied with a giggle. It filled my heart hearing her voice. &quot;They put us in Stevenson Hall and we just got finished moving in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shit, Stevenson? That was the best dorm on campus. And here I was worried. &quot;Shit, that&#39;s nice. We&#39;re not in anywhere close as good, but everyone&#39;s fine I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, I&#39;m glad. I can&#39;t wait to see you again,&quot; she stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too, but I doubt that&#39;s gonna be any time soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess that just means I&#39;ll be even more ready for you the next time we meet,&quot; she said sexily, causing my pants to tighten. Our sex life had just started, but it was incredible. I couldn&#39;t imagine being any more compatible.<br />
<br />
I smirked and though she couldn&#39;t see it, I could tell she knew. I couldn&#39;t wait to see her again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Where the hell did you get that?!&quot; A man yelled from across the hall. I turned to see a police officer walking towards me, in full SWAT gear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get what? My phone?&quot; I asked stupidly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re supposed to be confiscating all phones. Someone should&#39;ve gotten that by now.&quot; The man said, grabbing the phone from my hand. I was going to defend myself, but his other hand was already placed firmly on his gun. This wasn&#39;t the first phone he had to take from a millennial.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, I promise I&#39;ll talk to you later,&quot; I replied. I wasn&#39;t sure if she heard, but it was the thought that counted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, kid. Just doing my job,&quot; the man stated as he began walking away. I flipped him off in response.<br />
<br />
This day couldn&#39;t get any worse, I thought to myself. Just as I began walking back, I was nearly pushed over by Daniel rushing past me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yo Daniel! What the hell? Watch it!&quot; I hollered.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sorry,&quot; he mumbled. Was he cupping his crotch?<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t have time to check as the black haired man practically ran into the bathroom. Fuck, this place was gonna be weird.</p>
