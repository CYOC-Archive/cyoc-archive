<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Laying in bed with Luna, even in human form, felt wonderful, and in some ways the feeling of the sheets over smooth human skin felt better than it had over fur, though that made sense. The only hair you could really feel was the long brown hair that still hung back, and you brushed it back with one arm as you looked over to Luna. You thought your hair reached a bit below your shoulders but you weren&#39;t fully sure. You were more focused on the question you&#39;d asked and learning a bit more on what you were now. After all, until the previous evening, you&#39;d always been a normal male human. You were now in the body of a mature human woman and could take on MILF-wolf form. It thus made sense to be curious. Particularly when the high school classes didn&#39;t reveal everything about normal werewolves or MILF-wolves, as only the basics were needed for personal safety and protocols related to avoiding unwanted transformations. That situation was obviously different now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... from what I&#39;ve learned from mom and &quot;dad,&quot; the full moon is the primary transformation trigger, as is the case for all werewolves, MILF-wolves included,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;but there can be other triggers. Usually related to thinking about our full MILF-wolf forms and the desire to be in that form. Now that it&#39;s active for me and you joined... that applies.&quot;<br />
<br />
You made a small smile, though you also saw Luna raise a hand with her pointer finger pointing upward. You took that as a warning.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that doesn&#39;t mean you can and should transform again,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;for one thing... while it doesn&#39;t hurt, it DOES consume energy, which is partially why werewolves are the hunters that they are. If they didn&#39;t get some source of meat over the course of the three nights of the full moon... or after transforming outside the full moon, they&#39;d starve to death and waste away. Not to mention that there are public nudity laws that apply in public areas during the day. People tend to look the other way at night... but not during the day. I just got my mate, the father of our children, and I won&#39;t lose her to public indecency. Understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
You carefully slid out of bed and stood up, feeling the weight of your breasts fall and rest on your chest as you did so. You could feel your feet on the floor, and that sense could provide you with enough information to know that your feet were bigger than what you would expect for a woman of yours and Luna&#39;s height. You glanced over to her and noted that both of you were about the same height. There might be some difference, but not enough for you to notice without official measurements. As you walked around the bed, you noted some of the more different things that were about you as your first day as a woman began. Your breasts bounced a bit as you walked, not much as you weren&#39;t running, but it was enough that you could note the weight of the round orbs on your chest. They didn&#39;t sag all that much, but you guessed that MILF-wolves, like all werewolves, tended to be surprisingly healthy. As you made it around the bed though, you were greeted by Luna looking at you sternly, which made you realize you&#39;d been too caught up in your new body to respond to her statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Understood?&quot; Luna repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; you responded. You had heard what she&#39;d said and in a way you agreed, you&#39;d just let your mind wander a bit. &quot;Sorry... I kinda let my mind wander and I&#39;m adjusting to being a woman now... and it&#39;s all different and...&quot;<br />
<br />
Your voice fell off a bit at the end as you looked to Luna. She took your answer honestly, but she also caught on to how your voice fell off at the end. This brought raised eyebrows and a slightly open mouth, as if to voice some nervousness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nicki?!&quot; Luna said slowly, &quot;are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I... um...&quot; you said slowly, &quot;it&#39;s just that well you&#39;ve matured nicely...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well of course I did,&quot; Luna answered playfully swatted at your left shoulder, &quot;you should remember this from the high school classes. A MILF-wolf, in human and wolven form will always look to be in their thirties or forties. So, after my eighteenth birthday, my clock was officially running to when I&#39;d have my first transformation, something that is often triggered with age, regardless of what phase the moon is in. Once that happened, I would physically age until I look like I&#39;m in my thirties, despite only being eighteen. I&#39;m not going to alternate between looking eighteen and thirty. You look the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
You chucked nervously and scratched at the back of your head for a moment, &quot;no... I understand that. It&#39;s well... you&#39;ve always looked a bit like your mom, and until now like a younger version with blonde hair. Now it&#39;s like you are a blonde haired version of your mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You make that sound as though you&#39;re into my mom,&quot; Luna rolled her eyes, &quot;and know this, my dad will fight you if you are into my mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;m into you,&quot; you answered, &quot;you&#39;ve been a great many things that I love and can relate to. But I will admit that I&#39;ve liked your mom and... &quot;dad.&quot; They&#39;ve been polite to me when I visited in the past... and have appeared to be okay with me getting you pregnant to become a MILF-wolf. It&#39;s just that... well... forgive me if this sounds bad, but it shows where you got your good looks from.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna managed a small laugh and gave you a warm hug. You returned it eagerly, feeling your breasts compress against hers. Your nipples didn&#39;t touch hers, but they were sensitive enough to feel the warmth from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which means our daughter will get her good looks from us, you know that right?&quot; Luna asked you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; you nodded, &quot;and hopefully we&#39;ll set a good example as parents and she&#39;ll turn out as good as you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You wanted to hide some of your nervousness at the issue, but had a bit of difficulty in doing so. That only got Luna to hug you tighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t sell yourself short,&quot; Luna said to you, &quot;there are some things where I might be teasing you a bit... but you&#39;re still a good person and one that emotionally I&#39;ve been close to. It&#39;s why I love you. It&#39;s why I wanted you to be the father of my child and to become my mate as a MILF-wolf. You&#39;re a wonderful person... as Nick and as Nicki. It&#39;s the person I love, and that person was always there growing up. The sexy woman you&#39;ve become... that&#39;s icing to what was already wonderful.&quot;<br />
<br />
You leaned forward and kissed Luna as a way to say thank you. She returned it, and the two of you shared a bit of a make-out session there standing next to the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; you said weakly, &quot;though... I can&#39;t help but notice...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That I&#39;m being more flirtatious with you now?&quot; Luna smiled back, &quot;that comes with being with a MILF-wolf, regardless of form. I found you sexy as a man, and if you weren&#39;t transgender, I would have suggested finding a regular werewolf and then we could still be together as man and wife. But because you were transgender, I knew you wouldn&#39;t feel right as a male werewolf... thus why I waited until I transformed so that I could be the one to put you in the right gender.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know...&quot; you managed, &quot;but if you were straight before... why would you be so into me as a female?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Part of it is that emotional bond,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;like what my mom has with Roxie. Mom is still largely straight... but she&#39;s loved Roxie for longer than she&#39;s been a MILF-wolf. Thus when Rook became Roxie, that emotional bond was so strong that mom was more than willing to adapt and cope with it. She also commented that at times, she&#39;ll also be horny enough that the gender of the partner really wouldn&#39;t matter. And with the fact that the MILF-wolf strain turns males into females, there is some element of being a MILF-wolf that can be considered &quot;bi-sexual.&quot; Thus my flirtations with you now. To show that I&#39;m STILL into you, regardless of your gender.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; you managed as Luna continued to hold you in a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in time that bi-sexual part of you will come out as a MILF-wolf too,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;a part of you will want to become a mother. And while I can&#39;t do that physically, we can talk on what you want physically and emotionally and go from there. But that will all come later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now, I think we&#39;d need clothes and clothes that fit,&quot; you commented as the two of you pulled apart, &quot;I mean I might be able to squeeze into some of shirts and the socks might not be too bad. But my pants were not cut for a woman with my waist and hip measurements... and right now I don&#39;t even know what any of my measurements are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your pants would also have to contend with your well muscled butt,&quot; Luna answered, &quot;which felt very nice while we were hugging... though it&#39;s bigger than mine... and well... I&#39;d share my panties with you... but my build at eighteen was more for the frame I had growing up. Once I reached this stage and took on this form, my hips and breasts got bigger too. So my bras and panties won&#39;t fit either of us. Which means both of us will need new clothes... And mom and &quot;dad&quot; can help with getting our measurements. Though there are other things that will be needed to start the day...&quot;</p>
