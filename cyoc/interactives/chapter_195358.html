<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gabriel woke up in a large white room. He felt groggy getting up. Once he was up he quickly realized he was naked. Gabriel then heard a feminine voice behind him groaning. He turned around to see a naked women slowly getting up like he had just down. He quickly turned around, leaving his back to her. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------POV CHANGE----------------------------------------------------------<br />
Meanwhile in another room a group of scientists were watching on large screens as the test subjects got up. One of them pulled up the two subjects info on another screen. It showed: <br />
<br />
Test subjects one: Gabriel and Amber.  <br />
Gabriel: Male, 26, unemployed, kidnapped after attending an anime expo.<br />
Amber: Female, 21, College student, working part-time as a waitress, kidnapped after attending an anime expo.<br />
<br />
As the scientists reviewed all the info they have on their subjects they saw as the subjects freaked out at their situation. They saw Amber blaming Gabriel and Gabriel doing his best to remain calm and defending himself from her verbal attacks. Amber eventually calmed downed. The scientists decided it was time to explain to the test subjects what was going on.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------POV CHANGE TO Gabriel--------------------------------<br />
<br />
Gabriel sighed as he seemed to have gotten through to Amber. He was in the same position as her, so there was no way he he was in control. They then heard the sound of static before a voice came out from some sort of speaker system they couldn&#39;t see. Gabriel and Amber heard a Female voice say<br />
&quot;Congratulation. The two of you have been chosen by your government to help us breed alien parasites for weaponization. Failure to cooperate will lead to summary execution.&quot; <br />
Gabriel could only drop his jaw, aghast at what he has just been told. He could only guess that Amber was doing the same as he had his back to her. After a while of silence Amber spoke up.<br />
&quot;What do we have to do then, if we what to live?&quot; <br />
The mystery speaker then replied &quot;do not resist as the parasites attach themselves to you, interact with each other like you are a loving couple, and it should be obvious, we expect you to have lots have sex once the parasites have attached themselves to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabriel blushed a bit at what the speaker said. He took a deep breath as he knew that feeling embarrass was pointless in this situation. It took a few minutes before Amber once again took the initiative. Amber got up and said that Gabriel should do the same. Gabriel took her advice and did the same. It was another few minutes before a small gap in the floor formed and a container containing Green Slugs popped out.<br />
<br />
Gabriel the saw the lid open and the container get flipped to spill out the alien slugs. Gabriel heard Amber walk up to be beside him, he didn&#39;t turn to look at her still doing his best to give her some level of privacy from him. They waited for the slugs to make their way to them. It took a while but Gabriel then felt the slugs start to crawl up his legs.<br />
<br />
He felt Five crawl into his slightly erect cock, Five went into each of his nipples, Four went into his ass, and two went into his mouth.<br />
Gabriel squirmed as they went into him, while he was squirming he saw the ones that entered Amber.<br />
Five went into Amber&#39;s cunt, Four into her ass, and Five into each of her breasts. <br />
After squirming for a bit both him and Amber manage to relax and not feel like they just had green alien slugs enter them. <br />
<br />
They heard the speakers crackle to life to give them an update on what they should do now. &quot;It is late now and we have no doubt the both of you must be tired, as such there is a bed in the corner for you to sleep on and we will wake you for your breakfast.&quot; <br />
The speaker then cut out.<br />
<br />
Gabriel looked at Amber, who simply looked back at him. No words need to pass their lips as they both knew they were in Hell essentially. They made their way to the &quot;bed&quot; which was just a large mattress on the floor and a large blanket. Gabriel offered the bed to Amber who took it without hesitation. Gabriel then went to lie down on the floor of their large cell. <br />
<br />
<br />
------------------------------night passes--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
When Gabriel wakes up, he sees that their is now a bathtub, a toilet, and a sink with mirror in the cell. He makes his way to it and does his morning routine. As he is doing it, he notices their are toothbrushes and toothpaste for them to use. As he brushes his teeth he notices his face now looks like a girls face and that his tongue as been taken over by one of the slugs that entered his mouth. As he thinks of the other one he feels it in his stomach. He freaks out, waking up Amber.<br />
<br />
Amber helps him to calm down, but they both know this won&#39;t be the only changes that will now happen. They once again hear the speakers turn on.<br />
&quot;The parasites are most likely turning the subjects bodies to be perfect breeding grounds for them. From what we observed last night the changes might finish by the end of today, but this is only hypothesis at this point. Oh shit we are broadcasting turn off the speakers!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabriel looks at Amber and once again they don&#39;t need to say anything as they now know that their bodies are going to change.<br />
