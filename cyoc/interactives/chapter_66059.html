<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It happened that Kendra's dad was a professional animator, who made his living as part of a team, drawing characters for kid's shows on <br />
Saturday mornings, at least, that's what he USUALLY drew them for. <br />
<br />
Once, when Kendra was 5, she asked her dad were her mom was, since she'd never met her, or even knew what she looked like.<br />
<br />
He told Kendra that one day, while he was drawing for a certain movie, he got very lonely, so he drew, inked, and colored the perfect woman <br />
for himself. To this day, he STILL had no idea how or WHY it happened, but as soon as he finished drawing his masterpiece, kissed it, and put it <br />
back down on the table, she (his drawing) came to life, jumping out of the paper, growing to proper size, and gave him a big, wet, toony kiss <br />
right on the lips, as if to thank him for drawing her!<br />
<br />
One thing led to another, and before long, they were married, and that toon woman got pregnant, and gave birth to a perfectly normal baby <br />
girl, which was Kendra.<br />
<br />
The mom stayed with them for a while, nursing her baby, but due to &quot;that pesky age law&quot; as Kendra's dad called it (for while her mom was <br />
physically 28 with an over-perfect body, she was still only 1 year and 9 months old from the time she'd been drawn), and because toons don't <br />
age or die (unless the plot calls for it), she was forced by the California State Government to divorce her husband and creator, leaving with a <br />
broken heart to live in the Toon World.<br />
<br />
Before she left, she asked him to promise to take good care of her daughter since she wouldn't be able to, and he did.<br />
<br />
So she left in her animated red ferrari, with tears streaming down her face from those big, yet sensitive toon eyes, and drove into the sunset - <br />
LITERALLY, and no one in the human world had seen or heard from her since - not even in movies or TV.<br />
<br />
At the time, Kendra believed her dad since she was only 5, and prone to believe anything at that age, but when she got older, Kendra had <br />
convinced herself that her dad had made the whole thing up - just so he wouldn't look like the &quot;bad guy&quot; for dumping her mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;If my mom really WAS a toon like you said,&quot; she'd rationalized with him once &quot;then wouldn't that make me half-toon?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her dad said he'd always wondered that about her too, and they dropped the subject for a while.<br />
<br />
Then, on the 18th birthday, it happened: as she took in a deep breath to blow out the candles on her cake, she blew up like a balloon!<br />
<br />
She looked scared, so her dad told her to blow, and she blew out the candles, but also blew them off - along with the frosting, the cake, and <br />
the entire table!<br />
<br />
Her father dodged just before the table crashed into the wall, and when he looked at her, all he saw was her clothes in a pile on her chair.<br />
<br />
He thought he'd lost her, but when he heard a tiny voice call out for help from under her shirt, he reached in, and pulled out a tiny little toon <br />
mouse, covered in thick, pink fur (so nothing could be seen), but with the hairstyle, and body shape (though it now was an exaggerated super-<br />
model body) of his daughter - in fact it WAS her!<br />
<br />
She was very scared, and asked what they were going to do, so putting an air-pump into her mouth, he blew her up until she popped!<br />
<br />
He then threw the her clothes into the pink dust cloud made by the explosion, and when it cleared, there Kendra stood - back to normal, with <br />
all her clothes on, but still a bit shaken from the ordeal.<br />
<br />
At first, they shrugged it off as a freak thing that would never happen again, but the next day, as she ate her breakfast, she turned into a toon <br />
pig in a polka-dot dress! She reached into her backpack, grabbed out of it a giant mallet, and smacked herself flat with it. When her dad <br />
removed the mallet, she sprang back up, and was normal - as if it never happened, and the mallet vanished.<br />
<br />
The next day, when she passed gas, a huge skunk tail exploded out the back off her pants, just as she was about to leave for school!<br />
<br />
Her dad helped her push it back in, only to have her nose grow into a pink elephant trunk!<br />
<br />
After they pushed THAT back in, her ears popped into long, pink rabbit ears!<br />
<br />
Then after THOSE were pushed back in, her feet stretched into kangaroo feet!<br />
<br />
In the end, her dad had to call in sick for her, and so she missed school that day.<br />
<br />
She tickled her feet back to normal, but her laughter turned her into a toon hyena that couldn't stop laughing, so her dad poured a buck of cold <br />
water over her, and she returned to normal.<br />
<br />
Now she was REALLY scared, and was starting to believe her mom was a toon after all!<br />
<br />
So that night, her mom came to her though a hole that appeared in the floor of her bedroom.<br />
<br />
Somehow, Kendra knew it was her, and when she asked her how she knew to come, she lovingly said &quot;Because I'm your mother, and I just knew <br />
because I did - toons don't operate on the same logic as people, but toons don't need logic - they just need to make people laugh and <br />
entertain them - that's why we we're made, dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You left me!&quot; Kendra shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't your dad explain why?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Kendra replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you know I had no choice.&quot; she lamented &quot;I did't WANT to leave you - those stiff-shirts in the C.A. government MADE me leave! Don't you <br />
understand that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Kendra replied, a bit calmer &quot;but what I DON'T get is why I keep 'tooning-out' all the time!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because your toon half is only NOW starting to make itself known.&quot; she replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't I stop it?&quot; Kendra pleaded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you can,&quot; her mom said &quot;but only if you remember to smile and be happy - otherwise your toon side will keep coming out, because toons <br />
aren't meant to be down and sad - they're meant to be happy and silly!&quot; and she fluttered her long eyelashes at her daughter while smiling <br />
gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;So as long as I start the day in a good mood, I'll be fine?&quot; Kendra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear,&quot; her mom answered, shifting her oversize hips &quot;and remember - since you're half toon, you can use your toon abilities any time you <br />
want! However, since you're half human you won't live forever. Sure if something happens like getting shot, crushed, sliced, if you fall, or if <br />
anything else like that happens that would kill a normal person, you'll survive and never look like a mess that isn't &quot;G-rated&quot;, but you'll still die <br />
of old age. In fact, the only way to stop yourself from aging, and dying THAT way, is to embrace the toon within. If you do, you'll shed off your <br />
human self, and be a full toon like me - in fact, since I'm your mom, you'll look just LIKE me, but obviously younger so no one will get <br />
confused&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will my breasts be THAT big and my hips THAT wide?&quot; Kendra asked, looking at her mom's unreal figure (not quite Jessica Rabbit, but almost)!<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if you WANT them to be, dear.&quot; She said, giggling a bit at it &quot;I'd think about it though, since there's a catch to IT too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It WOULD be hard to find clothes that fit!&quot; Kendra said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not THAT, silly!&quot; her mom said, giggling before becoming as sober as she could (which has never easy for her) &quot;If you choose to be a toon, <br />
you'll be immortal and ageless, but all the friends and family you know who aren't full toons will all die someday, leaving you all alone, and I <br />
don't want that - not for my little ray of sunshine!&quot; She wiped a tear from her left eye, which made a loud splash on the floor, and continued <br />
&quot;To make matters worse, you'd have to leave to live in the world of toons, because toons aren't allowed to live here, and real people can't live <br />
there - it's one of the biggies that keeps the two in balance!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then how can you be here if that's true?&quot; Kendra asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because as soon as I realized what was happening with you,&quot; her mom explained &quot;I popped in to visit those government meanies that made me <br />
leave in the first place, explained myself, and after going through tons of red tape,&quot; she said, peeling some literal red tape off the back of her <br />
dress &quot;we reached an agreement: I'm allowed to visit you once each day for 1 hour, and likewise, your allowed to visit ME each day for an hour, <br />
but these two hours must not be closer than 12 hours, for example if I visit you at 6 A.M., you won't be allowed to visit me until 6 P.M. or any <br />
time afterward on the same day. Do you understand everything now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Kendra said &quot;It's a lot to take in all at once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of that,&quot; her mom said, looking at a watch on her left wrist, which clearly wasn't there before &quot;my hour for today is up, so I have to <br />
go now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, mom.&quot; Kendra said, crying. The 2 hugged eachother, with Kendra's face in her mom's oversized breasts, and as she patted her daughter <br />
gently on the head. &quot;I know,&quot; she said to Kendra &quot;I wish it wasn't this way either, but I promise I'll keep coming back to visit every day until you <br />
die, or go toon all the way, and if you choose that, you're always welcome to come live with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, the animated woman walked back down the hole in the floor she came out of, stopping only once to turn, blow a kiss to her <br />
daughter that landed with an audible &quot;smooch&quot; sound on her right cheek, remind Kendra to always start the day in a good mood so she <br />
wouldn't &quot;toon-out&quot; again, and kept walking down, with the hole closing behind her.<br />
<br />
This brings us to the present morning. Kendra had been fine sine then, with no more random toon transformations because she always <br />
remembered to start the day in a good mood. <br />
<br />
This morning however, she'd forgotten to do so, due to being humiliated by Kelly and all the other popular girls at a party last night!<br />
<br />
So when she was in her algebra II class, and when she stabbed her right hand with her compass by mistake, and when she saw her wounded <br />
hand start to swell to toonish proportions, it hit her - she'd forgotten to start the day off right, and now she was paying for it!<br />
<br />
She raised her still-normal-size hand, asked to use the restroom, got permission, and since the hall was empty, ran at a toonish speed towards <br />
the girl's bathroom.<br />
<br />
When she got there, the dust from her run settled, and looking in the mirror, she was now a toon fox girl, with pink fur, a white underbelly, <br />
blue eyes with lashes 2 inches long, oversize breasts and hips, purple hair with a big, green bow on top, and a backless, green, sparkling dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least I look good this time,&quot; she said in a seductive voice &quot;but now what? I can't let anyone see me like this!&quot; And what disturbed her the <br />
most, was that even when she'd said this, her voice STILL sounded seductive!<br />
<br />
As she stood there, thinking of what to do, and if she should show herself to a cute guy or not, suddenly.....</p>
