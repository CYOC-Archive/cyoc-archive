<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad opened all the doors and window from his room. He stood naked on the bare floor of his now otherwise empty room.  He looked into the giant empty locker which was visible beyond the door that formerly led to his closet. Then he looked into the giant metal drum of the washing machine that was where his bathroom was supposed to be. Next he glared out the window at the contents of some giant&#39;s gym bag instead of the big oak tree that normally was visible through that window.  Finally, there was the hallway door opened to reveal a huge stack of cloth in a dark room. It most definitely wasn&#39;t his house or hallway beyond the door.<br />
<br />
It reminded him of some twisted &quot;Let&#39;s Make A Deal!&quot; Game. Door Number 1, Door Number 2, or Door Number 3 - or how about the window instead?<br />
<br />
Chad paced the room repeatedly. He would stop before each choice. He couldn&#39;t fathom what would happen to him if he chose any of the doors. But he was pretty sure that he would be pretty screwed. He atared into the locker. He thought about what was in his own locker. There were athletic apparel, shoes, toiletries, a towel...he didn&#39;t want to be any of those things. He wondered who the locker belonged to?  He figured with all the doors open, he might get to see who opened the locker.  He stared. Then he moved on to the next door.<br />
<br />
The empty metal room-sized washing machine drum with a plastic door was not at all encouraging.  He guessed it was in a laundromat or apartment building laundry room. Then he remembered the towel boy coming out of a laundry room at the school. Was that the school washing machine where the towel boy washed the locker room towels? He also washed some of the team uniforms too.  If Chad tried to enter his bathroom, would he be transformed into a random locker room towel or some other jock&#39;s uniform? He licked his lips, and moved over to the window.<br />
<br />
Chad leaned out the window to look down into the gym bag.  He gripped the window sill for dear life. He didn&#39;t want to become something that you might find in a gym bag. But unlike the empty locker and washer drum, there was stuff in the gym bag. <br />
<br />
As he cranked his neck, Chad could make out in the dark bag from the light coming from behind him a couple massive shoes.  There was some crumbled canvas? Maybe shorts or a t-shirt?  Maybe a towel? What was missing? That missing item, Chad was sure, was what he would become if he went all the way through the window. No jockstrap? No socks? Or maybe they were in the shoes or covered by the big canvas cloth?  If it was Bruno&#39;s bag,  Chad knew there should be a dildo. He shuddered as he pulled his head back into his vacant room. No way did he want to be Rick&#39;s jockstrap or Bruno&#39;s dildo. But if it was Rod&#39;s gym bag? Chad had a weird feeling of emptiness that might be filled if he became Rod&#39;s socks or undies. What was he thinking? It almost certainly wasn&#39;t Rod&#39;s bag.<br />
<br />
Door Number 3: Chad stared at the folded stack of cloth that blocked his way.  It was stacked taller than he was. He would have to climb the stack of cloth to get passed the stack blocking his way.  He concluded if he made it to the top of the stack, he would become another folded piece of cloth. He studied it as best he could. He concluded it was someone&#39;s underwear drawer. He sure as hell didn&#39;t want to be some guy&#39;s underwear. Maybe a girl&#39;s undies he thought wistfully.  If it was a girl&#39;s lingerie drawer, some of the underwear should be pink or floral. There was a red pair, but most were white or dark colored. Probably, a guy&#39;s underwear drawer Chad concluded in disgust. <br />
<br />
Chad didn&#39;t like any of his options. He sat down with his arms and legs crossed on the cold, hard floor. Someone was playing a game with him. Well, he wasn&#39;t going to play their game.  He curled up in the fetal position on his bedroom floor waiting for someone to come looking for him. He yawned and fell asleep after about an hour.<br />
<br />
Chad woke lying on his back. He heard voices. Male voices standing over him talking. A heavy boot kicked him. He didn&#39;t want to get up.<br />
<br />
&quot;He sleeps like a log. Now he is one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, dead to the world. So you really going do a hatchet job on him?&quot;<br />
<br />
A gloved hand grabbed Chad&#39;s dick and pulled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too heavy to carry by myself. So if you don&#39;t help, I&#39;ll have to use the ax to chop him up.&quot;<br />
<br />
It felt like he was sporting his morning wood, but he was unable to grab it. Someone grabbed it, and tugged hard. Chad&#39;s cock should have exploded cum all over the gloved hand, but it didn&#39;t.  He was paralyzed. He was unable to move. He stared up at the sky. He was no longer in his room. He no longer saw his ceiling. He couldn&#39;t move to see who were talking, and who had kicked him. He could see an ax blade glinting in the morning sun hanging off a wood handle hovering over him. He couldn&#39;t see who was holding the handle. <br />
<br />
&quot;That tree log really is Chad?&quot; a voice asked doubtfully. <br />
<br />
Chad wasn&#39;t sure if it was one of the two voices he heard earlier or if it was a third voice. He felt pretty groggy. He couldn&#39;t think clearly. It was kinda like his head was made of wood. Duh! He was a log now wasn&#39;t he. How big a log? Too big for one person to carry...why would anyone turn him into a log. What would you do with a log?<br />
<br />
Oh oh. Bonfire! Wood for the fireplace? Furniture? Sauna planks? A canoe? Yikes, not a canoe! He remembered reading a book as a youngster where a native American father and son made a canoe out of a log. They chopped out the center a bit. Then they burned it. It took days but the log was transformed into a wooden canoe.  As a kid he had been fascinated with the log&#39;s transformation.  Now as a log, Chad was horrified by the pain and indignities to which the log had been subjected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what are planning to do with him anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You told me all the things you could do. But you cannot do all those things to one log. So you have to choose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you care? He didn&#39;t choose your gym bag. He didn&#39;t choose any of the doors. He tried to stump us. But not choosing was still a choice and now he&#39;s no longer a lumbering jock. He is lumber.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, ha! Now I care because he&#39;s heavy and you want me to carry him all thr way back to the cabin with you. So I want to know what you really plan to do, and what if any benefit there is to me in helping you. I mean if you just mean to carve your name or initials in Woody here, then change him back, what&#39;s the point?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, ha, ha! Oh, you don&#39;t think I went through all this just for a simple prank? Still it would quite a photo op to carve up blockhead, then change him back into a man. Would they look like scars, tattoos or birthmarks on his body? And changing him back temporarily would mean neither of us would have to carry him. He could walk back to the cabin. Then he would become a log again, and I can get on with my plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You still haven&#39;t told your plan!&quot; whined one of the voices. &quot;Besides if you change him back won&#39;t he try to escape?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah. It is a log. Dead to the world. Unconscious. See?&quot; The boot connected hard with Chad&#39;s side. <br />
<br />
&quot;So he wakes up naked in the woods with you and me and he just goes with us to the cabin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We found him naked in the woods, so naturally he will go with us to the cabin to get some clothing. But to be in the safe side I better carve a tethering spell into him. Then even if he suspects and tries to run before we get back to the cabin, he won&#39;t be able to run.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad was terrified, frustrated and furious. He couldn&#39;t move, he couldn&#39;t cum, he couldn&#39;t see who had done this to him. He was useless. Now if they would just change him back. He would clobber them.  The witch man or warlock who did this too him would end up dead or unconscious. If Chad was tethered, he would just carry the guy back to the cabin. Then he&#39;d figure out how to break whatever spell they had cast on him.</p>
