<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke was a shy boy which was odd because Luke had a great body. He worked out often building his muscles in the privacy of his apartment but he didn&#39;t go to the gym because he didn&#39;t want the guys gawking at him. He wore baggy clothes in an attempt to hide his body but this attempt failed. Nearly everyone knew that Luke was stacked and nearly everyone wanted him.<br />
<br />
Daniel Reid wanted Luke. Daniel Reid taught human anatomy and physiology and Luke majored in kinesiology (the study of the mechanics of body movement, i.e. how muscles work). Luke had already taken Daniel&#39;s class and was now working as a teacher&#39;s aide.<br />
<br />
The sheer number of dicked boys had grown so much that the homans had their hands full sending out subliminal messages to brainwash everyone but this brainwashing also caused people to be more open with their sexuality. The homans did not brainwash anyone into becoming a dick but they did increase everyone&#39;s interest in dicking. This caused Daniel to see an opportunity.<br />
<br />
He called Luke into his office and said, &quot;Luke, I need you to be the dick for the upcoming class on reproduction.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke said, &quot;Why, you&#39;ve got Tom and Jim already.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel said, &quot;They are used more for the sex ed classes. I need a dick that is more for anatomy.&quot; Although he&#39;d never seen it for himself, Daniel had heard the rumors about how big Luke was.<br />
<br />
Luke said, &quot;But you want me to let other people touch my genitals. I&#39;m scared.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel had invited Bruce to the meeting too and Bruce spoke up, &quot;You need to stop being so scared. Real men wouldn&#39;t be as timid as you are. You need to man up. This would be great for your development.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bruce still hadn&#39;t grown any hair since Liam had plucked him clean. Instead of making him look younger, being hairless made Bruce look rougher, almost like what a drill sergeant would look like if that drill sergeant was a cock. Luke imagined Bruce saying, &quot;On your feet, maggot. Wipe that grin off your face and salute your superior officer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bruce, on the other hand, was experiencing flashbacks to his time with Liam. Sometimes, Bruce was filled with anger and wanted to punish Liam further but sometimes, Bruce fantasized about getting taken by Liam again. But he shook that thought out of himself. He was a teacher and he was hear to teach Luke to be a better dick, er, man.<br />
<br />
Daniel said, &quot;It&#39;s only temporary and we will stay professional. It&#39;s an anatomy class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke mumbled, &quot;Alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke was given a day to make necessary arrangements. That was more time than he needed since he lived alone and didn&#39;t have much of a life outside his studies. That left him a lot of time to think about running away but where would he run to. He didn&#39;t want to be turned into a dick but he couldn&#39;t say no. He tried to psych himself up, to prepare to tell Daniel no.<br />
<br />
But as soon as he met with Daniel and Bruce again, Hugo was already there and Daniel hemmed and hawed trying to work up the willpower to say no, Hugo activated his dicking device.<br />
<br />
Daniel pulled Luke out of his clothes and whistled. Luke was the biggest Daniel had ever seen, even bigger than Bruce or Jackson. Luke was proportioned correctly, not a beast, but he was huge. He was the perfect model for the class. They meant to keep Jackson in the case since it was partly a punishment for drug dealing but Luke could be handled freely.<br />
<br />
Daniel did not fantasize about using Luke for sexual pleasure and he did not fantasize about having Luke as a cock. Daniel thought it was a shame that Luke had to lose so much muscle by becoming his own cock but Daniel was pleased that he could still see the handsome, young, athletic but shy kinesiologist inside Luke&#39;s cock.<br />
<br />
Luke spent a brief time sharing a drawer with Jim and Tom getting to know each other. No one would mistake Luke for the other two since they were average and he was huge. Jim and Tom were also always horny and kept rubbing themselves against Luke. Luke kept asking them to stop but by the time Daniel took Luke to class, Luke was fully flexed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now let&#39;s begin with the testicles. We are fortunate that our model has such big testicles. It will be easier to feel the different parts of the testicle.<br />
<br />
Luke silently grimaced as he felt his balls being rolled around and handled by student after student. Then he got handed to Lewis, a friend of Luke&#39;s. Well Luke was so much of a loner that he didn&#39;t have any real friends but Lewis was the closest thing he had to a friend.<br />
<br />
Lewis said, &quot;I see you finally came out of your shell and you did it in a big way. I told you you&#39;d easily become popular if you just let yourself go. How about we go to a party later? Everyone will want to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke said, &quot;No, Lewis, it&#39;s just for class. I&#39;m not ready to come out to a party full of people yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
But Lewis wasn&#39;t listening. He aside, &quot;Professor Reid, Luke&#39;s hair is interfering with the examination. I can&#39;t really feel the structures with all that hair in the way. Can we shave him?&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel said, &quot;That&#39;s a great idea.&quot; and before Luke could say anything, the whole class pitched in to take Luke&#39;s hair away from him.<br />
<br />
The class continued to examine every part of Luke&#39;s genitals, even jacking him off to get a semen sample for study. When class was over Lewis patted Luke on the head saying, &quot;Catch you later buddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Being patted on the head after having recently ejaculated was overstimulating. Luke felt blissful and dizzy.<br />
<br />
After all the students left, Daniel picked up Luke and said, &quot;There&#39;s an hour before the next class. Do you want to go to lunch with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke just moaned.<br />
<br />
Daniel said, &quot;I&#39;ll take that as a yes.&quot;</p>
