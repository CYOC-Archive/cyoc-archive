<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Victor Hughes lived in a two-story brownstone not far from the mall.  <br />
<br />
It wasn't easy, making ends meet.  Hard to keep a job when you're a convicted murdered <br />
and sex offender.  He was older now, and even though he'd dodged a lot of his jail time <br />
with a plea bargain and good behavior, his health had never been the same after that <br />
damned rent-a-cop shot him.<br />
<br />
Fucker.  He coughed.<br />
<br />
Victor was still tall, but his powerful muscles had withered, making him look like a <br />
skeleton.  His clothes hung on his body, and his hair had already turned a dirty grey color.  <br />
His eyes seemed dull, but there was still a spark of malevolence there.<br />
<br />
He smiled, thinking about the girl he'd left chained to the wall in the basement.  She'd <br />
been a lucky catch, the brat was probably no more than 7.  It'd been three days now, she <br />
wouldn't resist him at all.<br />
<br />
But first, he had to get in the mood, so he decided to finish watching the Thai porn he'd <br />
gotten the other day.  Amazing, what you can get away with in other countries, he thought <br />
as he settled back with a beer on the couch.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Jenny had left Kyle (he still wasn't ready to think of him...herself as &quot;Kylie&quot;) in front of <br />
Victor's house.  She had a bad feeling about the place.  <br />
<br />
If you'd asked Kyle a week ago whether or not he believed in Evil, he'd had probably <br />
shrugged.  But then again, he hadn't believed in magic curses then either.<br />
<br />
Brad had the curse now, which left him and Jenny without much in the way of weapons to <br />
use against this psycho.  Oh sure, she was super strong now, and she had that gun, but...<br />
<br />
&quot;Stupid Kyle, you could have made her as strong as Superman, and you settled for four <br />
times normal human strength.  And that bit about her staying a kid...&quot;  He smacked his <br />
forehead.<br />
<br />
Sure she was cute this way, but what kind of life could she have?  Not that he was in much <br />
better shape, his own parents wouldn't believe this girl was their son.<br />
<br />
She sighed and gripped the dagger tightly.  She didn't have Jenny's insane strength, so the <br />
short sword was probably out in case she did get attacked.<br />
<br />
She wondered how Jenny was doing.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Jenny crept around back quietly.  Her small body was perfect for stealth, and she couldn't <br />
believe how light she felt, now that she could lift 6 times her own body weight.  It was <br />
strangely exciting, the benefits of her new power.<br />
<br />
Stay focused, Jenny girl.  She easily vaulted over the back fence and found herself in <br />
Victor's backyard. It hadn't been mowed in months, at the very least.  As she crept <br />
towards the back door, she stepped on something.<br />
<br />
Looking down, she saw a plastic doll.  Barbie, wearing one of her many designer dresses.<br />
<br />
No way Vincent left that here, which meant...<br />
<br />
She felt her blood run cold as her eyes narrowed to slits.<br />
<br />
How many Jennifer Smiths had this man made?  <br />
<br />
She decided to break into the basement first.  Crouching down by one of the windows, she <br />
reached into a pocket of her new trenchcoat and got out a pair of thick gloves.<br />
<br />
Putting them on, she pressed on the frame firmly, pushing until the glass cracked.  She <br />
poked out a large shard of glass, which didn't even make a noise as it fell inside the <br />
basement.<br />
<br />
Then she pulled out the other shards carefully, the gloves protecting her hands.<br />
<br />
Once she could reach inside, she unlocked the window and opened the now mostly-empty <br />
frame.<br />
<br />
With a tiny flashlight, she scanned the basement.  Her heart caught in her throat as she <br />
saw the slender figure of a girl laying on an old rug, handcuffed to the wall.<br />
<br />
Quietly, she slid into the basement, dropping down in a crouch.  Kyle's stupid curse had <br />
made her a child, but she'd retained the athletic skills her other self had developed to <br />
become captain of the cheerleading squad.<br />
<br />
Who would have thought that skill set would ever come in handy?<br />
<br />
She crept up to the girl and gently shook her awake.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Mary woke up suddendly.  Was he back?  The dark man?  Was he going to hurt her again?<br />
<br />
She didn't want to go with him, but he'd seemed so nice at first, and then he'd stuck her in <br />
the arm with something...a needle, and she'd felt so tired.<br />
<br />
When she'd woken up next, she was down here, and the man had told her all kinds of <br />
horrible things.  Mary was scared, and it was so cold in the basement.<br />
<br />
But it wasn't the man, but a girl, only a few years older than herself.<br />
<br />
The older girl smiled.  &quot;Are you ok?  I'm here to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary couldn't believe it, and she literally threw herself at the girl, crying.<br />
<br />
Jenny held the smaller girl close, stroking her hair and telling her everything was going to <br />
be ok.  Only her eyes revealed her true emotions.  <br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Kyle had to duck behind some bushes when she saw a car drive by.  Cops.  This was not <br />
good.  Of course the cops would know all about Victor, and that meant they'd be nearby if <br />
things got out of hand.  <br />
<br />
Not much she could do about it now.  Jenny was trusting her...actually trusting her!<br />
<br />
Kyle put a finger to her lips, remembering the kiss.  She kept thinking she was going to <br />
wake up from this crazy dream, and be back in her old life.<br />
<br />
Socially outcast.  Jennifer treating him like dirt.<br />
<br />
Was being a girl really so bad, all things considered?<br />
<br />
That's when the lights in the house went out.  Whatever was going to happen, was going <br />
to happen now.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Victor was drunk, and he knew it.  He almost broke his neck coming down the stairs.  A <br />
little voice in the back of his mind told him he should sleep it off.  The kid wasn't going <br />
anywhere.  But he'd denied himself too long.<br />
<br />
He turned on the basement light, which flickered.  Damn bulb, he needed to change it.  <br />
Later.  He staggered towards the girl, who flinched as he came near.<br />
<br />
Good, she was awake.<br />
<br />
If he hadn't have been so drunk, he'd have wondered how the girl had changed outfits, or <br />
how her hair had gone from brown to blonde.<br />
<br />
He may have even wondered why she was bigger than he remembered.<br />
<br />
And he certainly would have noticed she wasn't cuffed to the wall.<br />
<br />
He crouched down to her level, stroking her hair.  &quot;Don't be afraid...it'll be nice, you'll like <br />
it.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's when the girl turned and he found himself staring into ice blue eyes.  And <br />
something hard and cold pressed against his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Vic, did you miss me?&quot;  Jenny Smith smiled cruelly.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Kyle watched in amazement as a small girl of 7 walked out from behind the house.  She <br />
was moving slowly, and wearing Jenny's trenchcoat.<br />
<br />
She moved to intercept the girl. &quot;Hey, are you ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary froze, not sure if this older girl was friend or foe.  &quot;Are you...Kylie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Grr.  I still don't like that name.  &quot;Yes, that's right, I'm Jenny's friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary broke down and told Kyle everything, including Jenny's instructions.<br />
<br />
She didn't like it, but she wasn't going to let Jenny down now.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Jenny had Victor bound, hand and foot on the old carpet.  He'd been completely taken by <br />
surprise by her strength, and his face was ashen.  He hadn't said a word since she <br />
introduced herself.<br />
<br />
She stood over him, slowly stripping off her clothing.  Her other self had done a little <br />
striptease for Brad, and she was doing the same for Vic.  She didn't have the body to make <br />
it look really good, but right now, she was just his type.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the matter, Vic, not enjoying the show?&quot;  She leered at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...you can't be her.  She's all grown up now.&quot;  Victor finally found his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you've been checking up on me?  What a bad boy, I thought I stopped being your type <br />
years ago...but then again, you did rape Mom, didn't you?  Bastard.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stood over him, dressed only in her pink panties and aimed the gun at his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've been a bad person, Vic.  I get it, you get turned on by us cute little girls.  I don't <br />
judge you for that.  In your case, it's a little creepy, but whatever.  But you, you had to act <br />
on it.  You raped and killed women of all ages.  You killed my mother, you son of a bitch, <br />
and you made my life hell.&quot;<br />
<br />
She paused.  &quot;The sad part is, killing you is a waste.  You're already dead.  You're just a <br />
vampire, a zombie, the walking dead.  But I can't leave you alive, because of who you are.  <br />
You'll just do it again, like with that girl you had down here.  Again and again until you die <br />
or someone takes you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad had the curse.  She knew it.  She didn't have the power, but maybe...<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll give you a chance though.  Better than you deserve.  If you know how, you better pray.&quot;<br />
<br />
She grinned, making sure to stroke her leg suggestively.  &quot;Here it is, Vic.  Transform or <br />
Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh...what?  Are you crazy, you little bitch?&quot;  Vic couldn't believe it.  He remembered the <br />
stories from when he went to school.  But it was just some dumb urban legend!<br />
<br />
Jenny thumbed back the barrel and took aim.  &quot;Choose!  Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vic swallowed hard, and made his choice.<br />
<br />
What do you think he said?</p>
