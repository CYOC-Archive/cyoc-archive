<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lightbulb Lab was the most popular game developer in the world. They always had the newest innovations, most creative plots, and the best graphics one could dream of or hope for. It was getting to the point that were it would’ve been hard to distinguish their games from reality, were it not for the fantasy twists of the games.<br />
<br />
Lyle Hop was a young gay man in his twenties who loved video games among other things. He was engaged to another young gay man in his twenties, whose older brother, Greg, was a straight man who was already married.<br />
<br />
One day, when Lyle’s boyfriend and Greg’s wife were at work, the gay man and straight man were hanging out playing video games. Everything would change when they heard a knock on the door.<br />
<br />
Lyle got up, saving Greg the trouble, and discovered a package on Greg’s porch which had a return address from Lightbulb Lab. Lyle brought the package to Greg and the two began to open it together.<br />
<br />
The package contained a short letter and the new virtual reality game system that had yet to hit the market!<br />
<br />
The letter read, “Mr. Greggory Lowel, you have been selected to be a free beta tester for our newest system, Hexaglobe. This system  includes one downloaded game with missions, as well as free style mode which allows for nearly endless experiences and avatar customization. Please enjoy, and use your Lightbulb Lab online login to give us feedback.”<br />
<br />
The two men excited plugged the system into the wall and took out the “controllers” which were actually to brainwave helmets. There was no need for a tv plug in, because the entire experience was direct to the player’s consciousness.<br />
<br />
Seeing how it was Greg’s house, he put on his helmet first and collapsed into his chair. Lyle waited patiently for a few minutes, expecting Greg to regain consciousness and tell him he could join. He decided not to wait anymore because Greg might be logged in for hours.<br />
<br />
As soon as Lyle put on the helmet he collapsed into his spot on the couch. When he could see again, his was in a white room with nothing besides himself except for a young blonde woman in a nightie.<br />
<br />
Lyle’s avatar was a copy of his self image, and therefor a copy of his real world self. He was skinny, not quite six feet tall, with blonde hair and blue eyes. He wasn’t a hairy man at all, and his face was smooth shaven. This was all reflected in one of the sides of the white room, which acted as a mirror.<br />
<br />
A voice seemed to come from all sides and robotically told Lyle that he was able to customize his avatar, and that any command or questions could be addressed to “computer”. <br />
<br />
The young blonde finally seemed to notice Lyle’s presence. She had been groping herself nonstop this whole time. “Hey Lyle,” she addressed him, “you’ll never believe it, this “computer” person lets you customize yourself however you want! This is a supermodel whose image I pulled from google.”<br />
<br />
“Greg?!” Asked Lyle.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, what gave it away?” Asked Greg ironically, still groping every part of his new body while staring in the mirror. “Well I gotta go, you’re kinda killing my mood, no offense. Computer, take me to a hotel with only hot women!” <br />
<br />
The system complied and instantly Lyle was in the room alone while Greg was probably off screwing himself. <br />
<br />
“Computer, can I make my avatar into anyone?” Asked Lyle.<br />
<br />
“Question detected. I can turn you into a copy of anyone in my database, or with a reference picture or video I can make estimations about what that body would look like and shape your digital body accordingly.” Answered the computer diligently.<br />
<br />
“Computer, can anyone see me in this room?” Asked Lyle.<br />
<br />
Computer: “No. There are no other players in this room.”<br />
<br />
“Computer, pull up previously uploaded avatars,” commanded Lyle.<br />
<br />
The image of his current avatar and Greg’s original avatar appeared before him for selection. Tentatively, Lyle clicked Greg’s avatar.<br />
<br />
In an instant, Lyle’s reflection was that of Greg’s body. Greg was six feet tall, hairy, muscular, and a bit fat. He had brown eyes, a shaved head, and five o’clock shadow.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit, it actually worked!” Remarked Lyle. He pulled down his pants and saw Greg’s flaccid two inch penis and low hanging balls.  Lyle was plenty attracted to his boyfriend, but he was always a little sexually curious about his boyfriend’s brother Greg. Just looking at his new naked avatar, the two inch penis became erect and grew to 4.5 inches hard.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the computer announced, “Update in five minutes. All consciousnesses will be re-uploaded to their corresponding bodies at that time.”<br />
<br />
“Fuck,” said Lyle who wanted to explore his temporary body more. “Wait, did it say re-uploaded? So our whole consciousness is actually in the Hexaprobe?” This gave Lyle a moment of  demonic inspiration and he said, “Computer, log me out in thirty seconds.”<br />
<br />
During the thirty seconds before logging out, Lyle thought the words, “I am Greggory Lowel,” on repeat. The timer finished and re-uploaded Lyle, to body he had convinced the system belonged to him!<br />
<br />
He took the helmet off of his shaved head. Lyle’s original body was still unconscious. Greg must be trying to masturbate with every moment he still had before the update.<br />
<br />
Lyle looked in the living room standing mirror at his new reflection, “I can’t believe this worked! Now then, Greg’s body, where did we leave off in the virtual world?”<br />
<br />
Lyle stripped down nude and once again got an erection in Greg’s body. He groped his new body with as much gusto as Greg had been groping that supermodel body. Suddenly, his old body stirred from the couch.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on,” asked Greg in Lyle’s body. He got up and went to the same mirror that Lyle was masturbating in, “we switched bodies?!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah we did,” said Lyle sensually as he groped Greg’s former pecs, which were hairy and muscly but also fat.<br />
<br />
“Well stop touching my body!” Said Greg.<br />
<br />
“No way! I’m just having some fun like you were in that supermodel’s body. And I didn’t even make it out of the waiting room before that stupid update was about to hit,” said Lyle who was more bold in this bigger body.<br />
<br />
“No, put back on this helmet and switch back with me,” said Gregg, plopping a helmet on his former head. It didn’t activate.<br />
<br />
“Chill, the update is still happening and there’s no way to log in while that’s going on. I’m gonna bust a nut, I’m not giving up the opportunity to see what an orgasm is like in another man’s body, even if it is my boyfriend’s brother. We can switch later when that update is done,” said Lyle.<br />
<br />
Gregg resigned himself to sitting on the couch but he couldn’t bring himself to look away from Lyle, and what Lyle was doing to his former body.<br />
<br />
Lyle got down on the ground and faced his new asshole to the mirror. He starting fingering the formerly straight ass while jerking the new little cock. His former cock was a bit bigger, being six inches erect, but this one didn’t belong to him, which made it much kinkier.<br />
<br />
Lyle moaned, finger-fucking his new hole. His head was lifted so that he could see the “fuck me” expression on his new face. Fifteen minutes later Lyle came so much out of the little cock, curtesy of those big balls no doubt. Gregg was pissed and powerless. Lyle was satisfied beyond belief.</p>
