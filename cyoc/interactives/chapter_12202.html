<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It's not fair to us, Mark&quot; explained Tony.  &quot;That's why I don't want you to set the times and sizes for random&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm not asking you to babysit me.  I'll take care of myself.&quot;<br />
&quot;But what if you can't?&quot;<br />
&quot;I'll be fine.  I'm not just some little kid.&quot; said Mark finishing the argument with a hard stare at his older brother.  Then he turned to Jeff, sitting at the desk in Tony's room with his hands at the keyboard, and nodded.  Jeff executed a few keystrokes then hit &quot;enter&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mark immediately felt a wave of electricity pass through him.  For a moment, nothing happened.  Mark grinned in anticipation.  He'd intentionally left his clothes on, wanting to feel them suddenly become as large as a circus tent around him or just draping ridiculously.  But that wasn't how things went.  Mark started to feel a bit heavy, then noticed his eye level was approaching his 16 year old brother's.  And his pants were suddenly painfully constricting.  <br />
&quot;Ow&quot; he yelped as his growing round rear burst the rear of them and his enlarging thighs and calves shredded the legs of them.  He was busting out his shirt as well when Tony and his friends realized the potential problem.<br />
&quot;Get him out of here!&quot; shouted Tony &quot;Quick!&quot;<br />
Mark's head was nearly at the false ceiling when Eric, Jeff and Jack started pushing him toward the door.  Mark was crowding the furniture, knocking over a chair and slamming Tony's dresser to the corner of the room.  Mark crouched to get out the door and had to crawl in the hallway to get to the top of the stairs.  By the time he got to the stairs, Mark's shoulders were too wide to fit the width of the stairway.  Tony coaxed him onto his side and Mark slid down the stairs that way.  Tony frantically opened the front and Mark just slid his shoulders through the door frame but kept growing to the point that he almost couldn't squeeze his muscular buns through the opening.  At last, out in the yard, Mark scrambled to his feet and ran to the back yard.  He was as tall as the peak of the two story house's roof.  And still growing.  Luckily, the St. Martin house was surrounded on three sides by thick woods, because when Mark St. Martin finally stopped growing a minute later, he had to crouch a bit to hide behind the house.  <br />
&quot;Give me some flannel and an ax and I can be Mark Bunyan&quot; he laughed.<br />
&quot;This better not last too long.  What are we gonna do with you?&quot; Tony wondered aloud looking at his giant, naked brother.  But Mark grasped the back of his older brother's shirt lifting him 30 feet off the ground.  <br />
&quot;The question isn't what the 6 foot tall guy will do with the 46 foot tall guy but what will the 46 foot tall guy do with the 6 foot tall guy&quot;<br />
&quot;Well?&quot;<br />
&quot;I dont' know.  I hadn't thought about this possibility&quot; Mark admitted.  But he saw a better possibility for some fun than Tony.  That was Eric.  The defensive tackle on the football team had often kidded Mark about his size.  He still did.  Mark put Tony down and grabbed Eric.  He tossed Eric up in the air 60 feet high and caught him amid Eric's shouted protests.  He hung Eric, by his collar, on a high tree branch and mimed treating him like a speedbag.  <br />
&quot;No, don't!&quot; Eric winced, his eyes closed.<br />
&quot;I could mop the place up with you&quot; Mark laughed &quot;Mr. Big Shot football player&quot;.  Mark laughed some more and then picked Eric off the tree and sat him down on the peak of the roof of the house.<br />
&quot;No, wait&quot; Mark said suddenly and he gathered all four 16 year olds against his chest like a series of dolls.  &quot;I've got a better idea&quot;. He chuckled and ran into the woods.  Nearly as tall as the tallest trees, he zoomed along at a fantastic pace until a half mile had been covered in well under a minute and he stood before a small isolated pond.  Jack was leftmost against his chest, the easiest to grasp with his gigantic right hand.<br />
&quot;With or without clothes little carrot top?&quot; said Mark to him.  <br />
&quot;Without!  Please.&quot; requested Jack and Mark put Jack down letting him strip.  He lowered his palm to the ground next to Jack and Jack stepped onto this new human elevator.  Mark stepped into the pond and then raised his arm as high as he could over his head, providing Jack a diving platform more than 50 feet high.  Jack gulped and jumped, covering his balls with both hands and going feet first.  With a mild pop, he hit the water.  A few seconds later, he was at the surface chirping happily, asking for a second chance.  They all had their chances.  They jumped off Mark's raised hands or the less intimidating heights of his shoulders or head over and over.  Mark swam a bit himself, but could make the other side of the pond in just a few strokes so he pretty much confined himself to serving as the diving tower.  <br />
<br />
Tony had just jumped off his brother's shoulders into the pond and surfaced when he heard Jeff, Jack and Eric shouting.  Mark was gone.  <br />
&quot;He had this funny, worried look on his face for a second&quot; said Jack &quot;And then, presto, no Mark&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, he must have just shrunk out of sight&quot; Tony reasoned as they swam over to where Mark had been standing.  They looked and looked but couldn't find him causing a panic among them.  What if Mark was microscopically small and this pond was the size of an ocean for him?  What if he drowned because he couldn't swim the proportionately huge distance to shore?  Tony and his friends alternated between frantically churning the waters looking for his now definitely little brother and trying to be absolutely still to scan the surface for him.<br />
<br />
Mark had had only a moment between being more than 40 feet tall and being a quarter inch tall.  He shrank almost instantaneously to his new dimension and felt as though he hung in the air, suspended at his former center of gravity, for just a second before dropping what seemed like a tremendous distance to the water below.  He was unprepared for the impact and felt like he'd been kicked in the balls.  He was just starting to feel okay again when the naked bodies of his brother and friends, now the size of aircraft carriers to him, started causing tsunami sized waves in the sea about him.  Jack went right past him once and he hitched a ride on Jack's red hair for a moment, each strand like giant slick rope, but Jack turned his head and flung him away in the process.  Luckily for Mark, the momentum, like being cut loose from an amusement park swing ride, threw him toward the shore.  But even just 10 feet from the gravel at the edge of the pond seemed like a mile to Mark.  The sky was starting to darken now and Mark grew frustrated that his brother and his friends kept missing him.  After several minutes, they swam into the area where he was floating.  Mark shouted for help at the top of his lungs.  Jack's bare ass was just a foot away, but neither Jack nor any of the others seemed to be able to hear him.  &quot;I was a better giant than you idiots are!&quot; he shouted in exasperation, but quickly realized the difference in scales.  He was about 7 times their height.  They were all now about 300 times his height.  Jack jumped and dove into the water intending to look below the surface and accidentally gave Mark a kick in the process knocking him woozy.  Mark was buffeted about by the movements of Tony and his friends and heard Tony suggesting to Jeff that they light a fire on the shore where Mark would need to swim in case Mark couldn't see it in the dark.  Mark, himself was right between them, snapping out of his haze.  When he realized it, he shouted.  But the two colossuses of Rhodes over him, Tony and Jeff, didn't hear a thing.  Jeff moved to go to shore and created a current that pushed Mark toward Tony, who was almost waist deep in water.  Mark swam with all his might at the same time, to ride the current.  Tony seemed about to move as well.  This might be the last chance.  Mark pulled and kicked and churned underwater, swimming as well as he ever had.  There were only a few ways to hitch a ride on smooth skinned Tony and Mark reached one of them.  Just as Tony's huge hips started to turn, Mark grabbed on with both hands to the end of Tony's foreskin.  It was like finding an extra flap on a parade ballon about to lift off the ground, but it worked.  As Tony turned and started to walk, the current running across the monstrous organ threatened to pull Mark off his brother.  But Mark managed to get first one then both legs inside the area protected by Tony's foreskin.  There, between Tony's foreskin and ICBM sized glans, the current was minimal.  Mark rode his big brother as Tony stepped out of the water and onto shore.  He almost lost his grip as his brother's giant bobbing priapus dropped to hanging vertically in the air and a swimming pool's worth of water poured over Mark on its way out of his brother's foreskin.  <br />
&quot;Alright, enough of this&quot; said Mark and he squeezed and twisted the edge of his brother's foreskin then bit it as well, as hard as he could.  <br />
&quot;Ow!  What the . .?&quot;<br />
An excited Tony plucked his tiny brother off his penis and held him in the palm of his hand.  Tony's friend's gathered round and joked happily with now lilliputian Mark.  Tony put him atop his head while he and the others dressed and then brought him back to the house.  Back at the house, Tony's parents and sister had gotten home.  Jeff quickly packed up the chronivac and left with Jack and Eric.  <br />
<br />
When Tony sat down to dinner with his family, he said that Mark was over at a friend's.  Their mother sniffed contemptuously &quot;Just as well.  He eats too much&quot;<br />
&quot;Not anymore&quot; laughed Mark into Tony's ear from where he crouched in Tony's earlobe.  Tony brought his finger from his plate up to his ear a couple times in the course of the meal, giving a huge splash of milk and a roast sized sliver of chicken to his tiny little brother.  After dinner Tony brought Mark up to his room.  Mark hoped for a quick increase in height, but hours passed and Tony, who had stayed in, after calling his new girlfriend Claire to cancel plans, finally turned the light out and went to sleep.  Mark slept on a folded up t-shirt on the nightstand beside Tony's bed.<br />
<br />
Sometime in the middle of the night, Mark was jostled awake.  He rose quickly, thinking that maybe he was starting to grow.  But it was just Tony's arm slapping down on the edge of the nightstand as he rolled over.  &quot;What the heck&quot; Mark decided and got up and hiked across his brother's body for an hour.  He walked across Tony's arm to the pillow and then stood on Tony's face, like standing on one of the faces at Mt. Rushmore.  He gave a friendly pat to Tony's full, pink lips then ran and jumped off onto his neck.  Tony stirred but didn't move. Mark walked leisurely across a muscular rectangle of pectoral muscle and stopped at Tony's nipple.  He licked it and squeezed it and rubbed it as though it was a giant female nipple.  But there wasn't the slightest change in his brother's huge penis.  Mark slid down to Tony's sternum and then made his way across Tony's tight abs to his perfect, flush with the surface navel.  It was lucky he was at Tony's navel, because Tony moaned the name &quot;Claire&quot; softly and then turned over onto his right side, leaving Mark dangling precariously from his navel.  Then, just as abruptly, Tony rolled back onto his back with a soft moan.  Mark was thrown clear of Tony's navel almost down to his brother's locomotive sized penis.  He got up from all fours just as he started to hear the a muffled sound of rushing water.  That's what it sounded like to him, but all of a sudden, the immense priapus before him started to swell and push forward with a slight scraping sound across Tony's lower abdomen.  Mark jogged back a few steps to stay beyond it but was surprised at how quickly Tony's penis expanded, stretching just short of his navel in just a few seconds.  Mark was first smacked in the back by the rocketing forward glans and then pinned ignominiously under his brother's penis, trapped on his belly against Tony's belly but with Tony's darkening glans pressing against the back of his head almost painfully.  Mark tried to crawl forward to where the shape of the glans would bring it away from Tony's body and ease the pressure on him, but while he was doing so, Tony's penis was only becoming more erect so that Mark stayed under the exact same part of it.  Mark heard his brother moan the name &quot;Claire&quot; a few more times and came to realize that his brother was having a wet dream about her.  For a period of a couple minutes, Mark struggled with all his might to free himself as his brother moaned softly and his giant penis got larger and harder.  Finally, Mark made some headway pulling himself forward.  The glans pressing against his back had become shiny purple and the slicker surface caused less friction allowing Mark to pull forward.  He got all the way out from under his older brother's penis and was running just above Tony's navel when he heard another rushing sound. <br />
&quot;No!&quot; shouted Mark looking over his shoulder.  In the next instant, though, his worst fear came true.  His tiny, quarter inch high body was engulfed in a huge ball of Tony's ejaculate that came rocketing at him from behind, knocking Mark off his feet and sending him cartwheeling in what seemed like a 10 foot diameter ball of his brother's seed across Tony's abs.  Mark held his breath trying not to swallow Tony's semen.  Almost immediately, Tony sat upright, gasping.<br />
&quot;What the . . oh jeez, not this again!&quot;<br />
Mark worried that he'd be thrown off Tony's abs to the bed below, a soft bed, but what looked like 40 feet below.  But he stuck to Tony's abs with his semen.  At last Tony noticed his brother somehow in the middle of a glob of his wet dream ejaculate.  He picked his brother out and cleaned him off in the bathroom.  He admonished Mark for not just staying put.  Mark complained that a 16 year old with a girlfriend ought to be getting some so that he didn't have wet dreams.  Tony shot back that a 16 year old doesn't expect his 13 year old brother to be walking around on him next to his penis.<br />
<br />
To Mark's chagrin, he remained a quarter inch tall all Saturday.  Tony carried him with him to the mall and over to Jeff's house.  Tony didn't say anything to Jeff or the others about Mark getting caught in his wet dream but Mark admitted it to them with a laugh.  It took a little fast talking for Tony to explain Mark's continued absence when they got home, but their parents didn't explore the matter very far.  <br />
<br />
In the middle of the night, Mark was jostled awake again, but this time he *was* growing.  When he awakened, his body was as long as Tony's clock radio.  He grew some more and jumped down to the floor in just a minute, he thought he'd returned to full size.  <br />
<br />
But when he stood next to an awakened Tony, he found he wasn't just a few inches shorter, 5'8&quot; to Tony's 6'1&quot;.  He was more like 5'2&quot; tall, tantalizingly but humiliatingly close.  What's more, instead of being a couple inches taller than Cindy, he was a couple shorter.  This wouldn't have been such a big deal most Sundays, but this particular Sunday, Mrs. St. Martin was feeling religious and dragged the family to church.  Mark's dress clothes had been getting too tight for him but were now ridiculously loose.  He tried to just stick close to Tony, but occasionally Cindy happened to be standing next to him. She couldn't help but notice his overhanging sleeves and his need to hold up his billowing pants.  She ended up sitting next to him in church and frequently rubbed the now accessible top of his head.  &quot;You seem awful shrimpy today Marky&quot;<br />
&quot;So do you&quot; said Tony and he reached across Mark and rubbed her hair hard as he could so that she complained to their mother and forgot about Mark.  But as they left the church, she tripped Mark from behind.  Both his shoes came off and his pants and boxers dropped to his knees.  Mark effectively mooned the entire congregation as everyone had turned to see what the commotion was.  Mr. St. Martin was upset, but Mrs. St. Martin was apoplectic.  At Mark, of course.  She yelled at him the whole way home, telling him what a horrible thing he'd done and how she probably couldn't ever show her face in there again.  When they got home, she pulled her strangely diminutive son along behind her into the master bedroom and grabbed her largest hairbrush.<br />
&quot;No!&quot; thought Mark to himself.  &quot;She hasn't done that since I was little&quot;  Mark tried to pull away but found that in his diminished state his mother was actually stronger than him.  She made him stand beside where she sat on the edge of the bed.<br />
&quot;Come on, Mom!&quot; Mark pleaded.  &quot;I'm thirteen years old&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, you're a bad little 13 year old boy and you're going to have to pay for it&quot;<br />
&quot;But Cindy tripped me!  I-I&quot;<br />
&quot;Enough!&quot;  With that, she pushed at his shoulders and he went over her knees.  As soon as he didn't have a hand holding up his pants, his dress pants and shorts went to the floor.  Mrs. St. Martin brushed aside his overly long dress shirt revealing her son's tight round little rear.  She attacked it with the hair brush.  Swat!  Swat!  Swat!  Over and over she smacked Mark across his bare little buns till he found tears escaping his eyes despite his best efforts.  She finally released him with a bark of &quot;Let that be a lesson to you&quot; and Mark ran up to Tony's room, his rear crimson and aching.  <br />
<br />
He might not have run into Tony's room, but it seemed to him that the stairs were awfully hard to climb, for a 5'2&quot; tall boy.  By the time he got Tony's door closed, he was at least a half foot shorter than that.  A few seconds later, his head barely stuck out over the pile of his clothes as he was 1 foot tall.  Even at a different size, his round little ass was still bright red.  His face became almost as red as he fumed along with Tony about the way their parents treated them compared to Cindy.  But that was Mark's last change before 8 pm.  He stayed in Tony's room and listened to the radio and read through the afternoon and early evening.  Just before 8, Jeff arrived with his laptop and the emitter and just after 8, Mark was his normal height again. <br />
<br />
He recounted all his adventures to the others and listened to their admonitions to be more careful but they could tell from his slight smile that they weren't getting anywhere.</p>
