<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer&#39;s mind felt as if it was being pushed and pulled. Try as she might to hold on to the things that she held dearest, one by one they fizzled away into the vortex that had formed. <br />
<br />
*Who am I again?* the question echoed time and time again in her head. It was the only solid land she could cling to while everything else was ripped away. Even her form became obscured, she burrowed into her identity as her only means of survival.<br />
<br />
Jennifer&#39;s eyes shot open, panting intensely from the nightmare. Her eyes were staring at the ceiling but...everything felt off. Her vision wasn&#39;t quite right, though she couldn&#39;t quite figure out why. Her nose appeared weird. She reached up and touched it with her hands, and was struck by her slender finger tips. <br />
<br />
*Have my hands always been so supple?* she thought to herself. Nothing added up. She sat up, and felt a massive weight drag her forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Urgh!&quot; she grunted, the weights pulling on her chest causing her to struggle. She looked down to see what was so heavy. Her vision was met with two large, white orbs of flesh attached to her chest, which mostly obscured her vision. Even more curious than her slender arms or her odd nose, were these large weights causing her to struggle getting up. She decided to inspect her right one with both hands. She lifted it up, and began rolling it in her vision. Her unfamiliarity caused a disconnection between her hand, and what she was doing gave her an unnoticed warmth at the base of her stomach. As she examined the front of it, she noticed that there was a pink button that felt a little hard. She pressed it, and felt a tingle down her spine. But it didn&#39;t help her sit up any. She decided to cradle both orbs in each hand, and successfully sat up.<br />
<br />
*What&#39;s going on?* she thought, gradually getting used to the increased weight. She looked around. Sure enough, it was her room. But what was everything in it? She figured the object she was on must be for laying on, or else why would she have woken up on it? It also felt very comfortable, like she wouldn&#39;t mind laying in it for a whole day of bliss...<br />
<br />
But she had other matters to attend to. She shifted herself, and pivoted her...legs? over the side of the bed. She couldn&#39;t see much beyond the orbs, but like everything else, her knees didn&#39;t quite feel like hers. She steadied herself, and got off the bed, balancing on both legs. As she navigated around the room, breasts in each hand, she noticed a large reflective surface and walked in front of it.<br />
<br />
The person in front of her was someone else. Jennifer didn&#39;t know who, or even what her original form was, but Jennifer was quite sure that this was not her body. She tilted her head to make sure that this surface was a mirror and not a picture of someone else. It was a mirror.<br />
<br />
Beyond the unfamiliar person staring back at her, she still couldn&#39;t figure out the purpose of the round, shapely bags on her chest. She removed her hands and let them drop back into place, threatening to make her fall face-first onto the floor. She continued examining the reflection staring back at her, running her hands over the parts as she did so.<br />
<br />
The chest orbs created small pockets underneath, which tickled her as her fingers traced over the creases. Below, her rib cage smoothly transitioned to a midsection resembling the middle of an hourglass. As thin as her midsection was, it ballooned out as her hands reached her hips.<br />
<br />
*Even more fat bubbles. But why?* she failed to understand the cushioning that they could provide.<br />
<br />
Across from her hips, she spied an odd fold where her legs came to meet. She tried looking past her chest for a different angle, but her vision was blocked. She parted the seas, and saw the tip of the crease, but still couldn&#39;t quite tell what she was looking at.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked around, and spied something that looked like it was meant to sit on. She sat on it, leaned back and almost fell. Regaining balance, she carefully leaned back, posing openly in front of the mirror. This way, her breasts were naturally pulled to the sides, and she could see what she was examining. She wiped a little sweat away from her brow, she was starting to get quite warm.<br />
<br />
As she began examining it in the mirror, she noticed it was slightly fuzzy, and that it didn&#39;t seem to be stuck shut. As she widened her legs, a slightly pinker color peeked into the reflection. Jennifer carefully used her fingertips to pull it apart, and noticed that it was damp. She curiously took her index finger of her right hand, and poked the top rim of it. It became much damper, Jennifer&#39;s heart began beating in her chest. Whatever it was, examining this slit was making Jennifer feel amazing!</p>
