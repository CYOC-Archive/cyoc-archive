<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The second Evie heard her sister and Kate leave for their party, she snuck into Emily&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
Evie had been dying for a smoke all day, but was all out. She&#39;d had her last one at school earlier, and this was the first chance she&#39;d had to steal some more in a few days.<br />
<br />
She looked in the usual stash, excited to see that her sister had just stocked up, then took a pack for herself.<br />
<br />
Evie hadn&#39;t told her family yet that she smoked. She already had been for the last year, it was difficult not to start with how often she was around her Mum and Sister doing it. Neither of them had called her out on it yet, so she assumed they were just blaming each other for packs going missing, or just straight up not keeping track of how many they were going through.<br />
<br />
She crept back to her own room, shutting the door quietly behind her, then stepped over to the window and pushed it wide open. She wasn&#39;t concerned about anyone walking in on her, nobody in the house ever barged into the others rooms without knocking.<br />
<br />
She sat down on the windowsill and lit up, the first hit already elevating her mood. She power smoked it in a couple of minutes, then used it to light up a second, flicking the butt in the general direction of the plant pot her family used as an ashtray.<br />
&#39;Emily was right, we really don&#39;t have any self control...&#39; she thought, halfway through her second smoke. She finished it off and threw it in the same direction, then got up and collapsed onto her bed. She was already bored.<br />
<br />
She found most of her evenings went the same. Evie didn&#39;t have a super close group of friends to hang out with, or guys that were interested in her. She&#39;d always been a bit of an introvert. It wasn&#39;t just her though, her twin brother Aaron was just the same. He was probably the one person she was closest too.<br />
<br />
She stood up again and looked at herself in the mirror, not really understanding why guys showed no interest in her. Needless to say she was still a virgin, which she tried to keep to herself at school. She had a slim, toned figure, and while her arse may not have been as great as her sisters, she was already bigger than her in breast size. She had darker hair than Emily though, closer to black than dark brown, and had to wear glasses over her cute face.<br />
<br />
She sighed and fell back onto the bed, pulled out her phone and started the usual dull scrolling through social media. Half an hour passed and she&#39;d moved onto a crappy but addictive mobile game, when she felt a tingle through her whole body. It wasn&#39;t unpleasant.<br />
<br />
She went downstairs and started watching TV in the lounge, eagerly waiting for Mum to go to bed so she could sneak into the garden and smoke out there. She didn&#39;t know why, but she was craving one even more than earlier.<br />
<br />
It got to 10pm and Evie was confident Mum would be out like a light now, so she snuck out to the garden and lit up.<br />
<br />
&#39;Is it...slighter lighter out here now?&#39; she thought. She couldn&#39;t usually see this clearly at this time of night. She finished her first smoke, and chained into a second again. She was a little concerned about how much she was craving it right now, but it made her feel better so she caved to it.<br />
<br />
She was halfway through it when her stomach grumbled something fierce. She was suddenly starving, and desperate for something to drink. Evie took a few final, quick drags on her smoke, and threw it into the pot as she stepped back into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
She threw the fridge door open, desperate for something to satiate her hunger or thirst. Her eyes settled on a bottle of milk, and she found herself immediately opening it and drinking it from the bottle.<br />
<br />
&#39;Holy shit this tastes great, why have I not been drinking all the time since Primary School?!&#39;. She drank half the bottle in one go, and felt much better. There wasn&#39;t anything in the fridge she fancied though, so she moved onto the cupboards.<br />
<br />
Without even thinking, she snatched a tin of tuna from the shelf, pulled the lid off and scooped it into her mouth with her hands.<br />
<br />
&#39;I thought I hated fish but this is way better than I ever thought it tasted&#39; she realised. A pleasant warm feeling built up in Evie&#39;s head, some of it moving to her ears, and some to her chest. It urged her on for more food.<br />
<br />
She opened all of the remaining cans and started to eat from them all, one by one. Evie could feel her breasts...growing slightly? And she felt like she was going deaf as her ears retracted into her head.<br />
<br />
It was only temporary though, as a warm feeling at the top of her skull was accompanied by hearing that felt way more sensitive than before.<br />
She moved onto the final can, unable to control herself. <br />
&#39;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening but I can&#39;t stop, my body feels incredible, I think I might even--&#39; she was cut off as her whole body trembled, throwing her head back and moaning into the air.<br />
<br />
Black fur sprouted from her new ears on top of her head, pushing her whole body into an orgasmic state. She collapsed to the floor, one hand frantically rubbing her crotch through her pajamas, the other slid up her top to feel her tits.<br />
<br />
&#39;Theyre a little bigger...but they&#39;re definitely firmer. Perkier&#39;.<br />
<br />
She brought herself to another climax before settling down, catching her breath.<br />
<br />
&#39;What. The. Fuck. Was. That&#39; she thought. Her hands touched her new ears. They were soft and fluffy. It was actually quite nice.<br />
<br />
Evie got to her feet and finished off the last of the tuna, licking the tins cleans, then stuffed them into the trash, hiding them at the bottom.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh man I need another smoke after that&#39;s she decided, and stepped outside.</p>
