<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tommy began to pant, uncomfortable heat filling his body. He felt his bones shifting and snapping -- he wanted to scream, but it was hard enough just to draw breath. A sudden convulsion threw him onto his hands and knees, long hair falling down in front of his eyes.<br />
<br />
<i>Wait... my hair isn&#39;t this long! Or this red...?</i> He stared past the sweaty locks into the rotating mirrors. In fact... was it just his hair? Or was it the hellish illumination that made his whole body look red -- &quot;Argh!&quot;<br />
<br />
He arched his back as another wave of pain hit him. His feet and hands seized up, toes and fingers curling, nails reforming into tough little claws that scratched the floor. Fire ran up his spine as his tailbone unfused and grow more vertebrae. He managed to crane his head around and see it wriggling up from the waistline of his jeans before pain flared in his jaws. His head fell, and he gasped, saliva collecting and dripping from sharpening teeth, pops ringing in his ears as his face pushed out, scents growing stronger.<br />
<br />
Then for a few moments his hearing was drowned out by the roar of blood as his ears migrated up his head, making him miss the sound of his shoes giving way to his expanding feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... please...!&quot; He choked as nausea swept through him, his insides literally twisting around as new organs began to form. He felt pressure on his loins, an uncomfortable pinching in his balls, then they were vacuumed up through an opening passage, the sensation of them travelling up into him blending into the general agony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-&quot; He threw his head back, spine snapping into a new posture as it arched further, inhuman scream finally released from his throat. A hot flash swept over his frame as his narrow chest swelled. He shivered as the pain began to alternate with pulses of pleasure. His dick, now a little nub sunk into his crotch, was stiff and screaming for attention. As were his growing nipples, pressing into his shirt as tissue began building up behind them.<br />
<br />
Finally Tommy could not take it any longer. His limbs gave out, letting him sink down, his new boobs smashed against the platform. Strangled whimpers leaked out past the fangs in his narrow muzzle. Pointed ears twitched at the strange, high-pitched sounds he was making.<br />
<br />
Slowly the chills receded. The pain faded to a dull ache and uncomfortable tightness of clothing around expanded hips and chest. But the discomfort was being overwhelmed by the feeling of erect nipples pressed to the floor. An alien feeling; frightening in its promise. Even worse was the sensation of emptiness in his groin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-wh-what... am I?&quot; With some effort, Tommy pushed himself up onto his haunches. He moaned lewdly as fabric drew taunt over his nipples -- and then several buttons pinged away, relieving the strain somewhat as his shirt burst open in an explosion of white fur.<br />
<br />
The red light now gone, replaced by the mundane illumination of the tent&#39;s lamps, he lifted his hands. Black fur, brown pads, long, delicate fingers... they looked like a cross between a woman and a dog. Then he brought them inward, lowering his head further to look at his chest.<br />
<br />
He gulped as he gingerly cupped the large, white-furred mounds that now covered his pectorals. <i>What a view...</i> He tried to joke with himself, swallowing again as he felt the touch of his pads and his claws against his underboob. <i>So... heavy... I guess I&#39;m... a girl now...?</i><br />
<br />
His self-inspection was interrupted as the mirror was opened. &quot;Excellent.&quot; Tommy looked up. A strange flush swept through him at the sight of Master Az. A desire... to be seen. For the ringmaster&#39;s approval? To make <i>him</i> desire... her?<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand up and let us have a look at you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tommy hastened to obey, even as he questioned the strange feeling of... <i>loyalty</i> that he felt for the man who had just put him through an agonising transformation.<br />
<br />
<i>Transformation...</i><br />
<br />
&quot;What... what did you do to me?&quot; he asked, his voice more subdued than he would have liked, the feminine tone curious rather than accusing. He just couldn&#39;t... bring himself to oppose the ringmaster.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take your clothes off, and have a look.&quot; The man smiled, and gestured at the now stationary mirrors.<br />
<br />
Tommy blushed. He clutched his shirt to his chest, suppressing another moan at the pressure on his bosom. But, he could not refuse a direct order, could he? And part of him <i>wanted</i> to show off. With increasing speed he undid the surviving buttons, then shrugged the light cotton shirt off, letting it fall as his breasts jostled sexily.<br />
<br />
Then he bent and tried to remove his jeans, catching his breath as his tail was pinched. The ripping of seams around his inflated butt did not free it, and he began to struggle desperately with the zipper, everything else forgotten in an effort to relieve the pain. Finally with a growl he tore them apart with his sharp claws. He kicked off the tattered denim remains as he straightened, ripping off his boxers and tossing them aside. Then he turned to look in a mirror.<br />
<br />
<i>Not a dog,</i> he realised as he cupped his boobs again, shifting his hips and stretching his tail in blessed freedom. <i>A fox!</i> A very foxy fox, from pointed ears to large paw-feet, from golden eyes to fluffy white-tipped brush. Tall, elegant, and voluptuous, seductive curves hiding firm muscle. Long, dark red hair; bright red fur offset by a white front; natural black gloves and stockings hugging her long legs. The sight gave him a strange sense of pride, and a predatory hunger for... something. He really wasn&#39;t sure if the ache in his stomach was for food, or for admiration, or for...<br />
<br />
<i>Something.</i><br />
<br />
A breathy &quot;Oh&quot; was the only comment he could make.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn around,&quot; ordered the ringmaster.<br />
<br />
Tommy turned in a slow, full circle. He still felt embarrassed to be showing off his naked body for the man&#39;s inspection. But it felt so <i>right!</i> Facing the ringmaster again, he whimpered softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?&quot; she repeated. &quot;Why do I feel so...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aroused?&quot; Az&#39;s mouth quirked. &quot;Well, I think it&#39;s only natural for a stripper to enjoy showing off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What!?&quot; Tommy exclaimed sharply. His eyes went wide, and he began to hyperventilate again. &quot;You... you didn&#39;t... say anything about... about being a stripper!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t recall limiting myself to the options I read,&quot; replied the ringmaster. He chuckled. &quot;The circus introduced poledancing to this country. And, since I&#39;ve been wanting to expand my appeal with the adult crowd, I thought I&#39;d take up that tradition. With a bit of exotic flair, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But -- but --&quot; Tommy spluttered. &quot;I don&#39;t <i>want</i> to be a -- a foxy stripper!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at this point, your only other option is the freakshow,&quot; said Az coyly. &quot;Never let it be said that the great Az doesn&#39;t give his employees a choice! So, would you rather shimmy around a pole partially clothed, or loll around a straw pallet completely naked?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>What kind of choice is that!?</i> Tommy stared at him in horror. But he really didn&#39;t <i>have</i> many other choices. A fox-woman could hardly go back to normal society. His ears dipped as he realised that, even without the strange compulsion to obey Az, he had no realistic chance to escape the carnival.</p>
<hr/><h3>
So what does Tommy choose?</h3>
