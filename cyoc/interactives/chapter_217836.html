<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wish that you&#39;d know what Tom has been through!&quot; Bill roared, and in a blinding gold-green instant, the entire world seemed to invert. Bill felt himself falling, growing weaker, lighter before suddenly he landed with a muted FWOOMPH on something very soft as reality appeared to re-assert itself. The first thing that swirled into Bill&#39;s vision was the familiar pink paint of his bedroom, the Trevor Timberlee posters on the wall, the cute plushies that he no longer needed for anything other than cute decoration, the pristine cheerleader uniform hanging from the back of the closet door. The large bed that he now laid upon. Pulling himself upright, Bill rubbed his eyes and for a moment, felt something important slip from his thoughts. But what?<br />
<br />
Blinking through the momentary blurriness, everything seemed normal, but Brianna could tell that something had changed, something BIG. She opened her small hand and stared at the gemstone, wincing slightly as she realized how tightly she had been squeezing the stone. Her blue eyes went wide as she saw the deep crack that cut through once side of the stone, almost all the way to the gold core, which itself seemed to lack the luster that it had only moments ago before Brianna had made her wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what did I wish for?&quot; The sixteen year old whispered to herself as she gently rolled the stone around in her palm, realizing that it looked much larger now than she remembered it being. She curled her fingers around the artifact and saw that she could just barely cover it. But that was to be expected, though; Brianna was small and rather petite (though her breasts certainly kept her from being a stick), making her the perfect size for the complex launching routines the cheerleading squad performed. Even though she felt insecure about it, next to some of the taller girls...But as much as everything felt right, felt normal, the unknowingly changed teen just had a feeling that something was wrong. She furrowed her brow as she sat on the edge of her bed and tried to remember what she had wished for.<br />
<br />
Fragments, flashes of what had been before surfaced, but they were still vague and blurry. They almost felt like a vivid dream, thirty minutes after waking up, where other stimulus began to push it away. But these remained, which for Brianna, meant they were real. She remembered finding the rock on the front porch, being older, a boy, three girls? She knew that at least one of them was her high school idol, Tamara Vanapolous, but the others were too vague to make out. She remembered being angry at someone and making a wish, but then what? A pout formed on Brianna&#39;s pretty face as she struggled to remember the details.<br />
<br />
But her pondering was cut short as her cellphone lit up on the nightstand next to the bed, it&#39;s ringtone blaring out a digitized version of her pop idol crush, Trevor Timberlee, latest hot single. A well ingrained habit pushed Brianna into autopilot as she leaned over and grabbed the purple (a color she was starting to prefer over pink) encased phone, her face lighting up as she saw who was calling. She immediately pushed the thoughts from her mind and swiped to answer. She still felt something was off, but this was SOOOO much more important right now.<br />
<br />
Wasn&#39;t it? Brianna Strasserman shook off the distracting thoughts as best she could and focused on the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey Tamara! I was just thinking of calling you!&quot; Brianna said, trying not to gush too much. Tamara was her cheerleading idol, her mentor in all things girly and popular at school. Brianna was convinced that the Senior was grooming her after Tamara graduated next month. They spent so much time together, it was impossible that it couldn&#39;t be it, right? Sure, the Bolstrum girl was next in line for cheer captain but she was so moody all the time! And smoke and hung out with Big Jon when she thought no one was looking. Those little tidbits of gossip were Brianna&#39;s secret ammo against the current Junior upperclassman. Another useful strategy Tamara had taught her; always be willing to use information to get the things she wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Bri!&quot; Tamara&#39;s voice said, floating through the speaker of the younger girl&#39;s phone, &quot;I&#39;m coming around the block! Get your butt downstairs, I want to get to school before it rains!&quot; Tamara&#39;s voice sounded joyful, happy, but Brianna knew that the Vanapolous girl expected her every order to be followed to the letter. To disobey was...problematic. There was a reason she was known as Terrible Tammy by those unfortunate enough to earn her wrath.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be waiting! We&#39;re still having practice after school, right?&quot; Brianna&#39;s eyes flickered towards her uniform, one of her most prized possessions, still hanging from the closet door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course! Hurry up, I can see your house!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay! See you soon!&quot; Brianna said, ending the phone call, jumping up and racing across her room to grab her uniform, as well as her backpack that was hanging from her makeup station chair. She paused for just a moment, staring down at the stone in her hand and feeling the intense need to know more about what happened, but she couldn&#39;t let her friend/mentor/boss down and school was no doubt going to be busy. She could figure it out when she got home tonight. Brianna set the gemstone on top of her makeup station and hustled out the door as quick as her legs could carry her.<br />
<br />
&#39;Thank god whatever I wished didn&#39;t make me naked, I&#39;d never have enough time!&#39; She said to herself as she barreled out of her bedroom and bounced down the stairs, her breasts bouncing a little painfully beneath the cute top she wore. As she reached the bottom of the stairs she squealed in horror as a figure came out of the living room entrance and Brianna had to put her gymnastics to use to dodge the larger, lanky form of her big sister, Willow. A flash of white and pink glided by the dark blues and blacks at the bottom of the Strasserman household.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will! Watch out!&quot; Brianna fumed as she found her footing on the other side of the larger girl. Willow was always like that, getting in the way. And the younger Strasserman wrinkled her nose and took a few steps back from her big sister, &quot;You better not let mom and dad smell you, you know how they feel about pot in the house!&quot;<br />
<br />
Willow snorted and rolled her eyes, &quot;Good morning to you too, Short Fry&quot;, grinning as Brianna bristled under the insult but then frowning. Why couldn&#39;t she remember the last few minutes?<br />
<br />
&quot;DON&#39;T CALL ME THAT!&quot; Brianna screamed before stomping out the door right as Tamara&#39;s red convertible pulled up across the quiet suburban street. Willow watched her younger sister with a mixture of confusion and concern as she crossed the street, and tried to not acknowledge the strange feeling that appeared when she saw Tamara&#39;s glorious golden maned head and perfect white teeth behind the expertly applied lipstick, even as the convertible quickly pulled away down the street towards the high school that Willow had dropped out of years ago to pursue...something. Was it music? Art? Willow knew it was something but the fog in her head blotted it out for the moment. Willow simply shrugged it off and walked up the stairs and into her room, where she recalled being only a moment ago...But that was impossible, right?<br />
<br />
Willow&#39;s room was a bit of a mess. Her bed was in a state of perpetual unmadeness, album covers and brooding art posters of everything from dark fantasy to iconistic art design covering the light blue walls. Black out curtain hung limply across the closed blinds of the windows, providing just enough light that Willow didn&#39;t have to turn on a light, which Willow...preferred? She couldn&#39;t remember as she closed the bedroom door. The clothes from previous days lay strewn in piles here and there across the floor, and she quickly pulled her current clothes off and dumped them in their own pile as she crossed the floor to her bed, flopping down on it in her black bra and panties as she reached for her own phone, charging on her own nightstand. Taking one last look at the piles of clothing and making a mental note to do a load of laundry later, Willow turned her attention to her phone. There were the usual texts, her other drop out friends wanting to get together again tonight, pictures of what looked to be a hella great party, the usual.<br />
<br />
But then there was the stand alone that drew her attention. It wasn&#39;t much, but they never were.<br />
<br />
Sent From Gene, 7:32am: Hey. You up?<br />
<br />
It was Gene Ackerton, one of Willow&#39;s more recent, but quickly growing in importance, friends. He was a good kid, younger than her. He was starting to run in her circle of friends, having been chased out of his own by Tamara Vanapolous, who was his on again, off again girlfriend. He was interested in her, but Willow had made it clear that she just didn&#39;t swing that way, but Gene had taken it well. Instead she just found herself becoming a rock for someone that was clearly not in a good place, being there to talk, and to give him a ride to school, which was probably what he was texting her about.<br />
<br />
Sent From Willow, 7:41am: Lol, haven&#39;t been to sleep yet :P<br />
<br />
Willow leaned back and waited for his response. It&#39;d been almost ten minutes, chances are the poor guy had already taken off walking. Oh well, maybe she could toss her clothes back on and run out. In the silence as she waited though, now that she was the only one in the house as everyone else had gone out to start the day, the worrying feeling that something was wrong began to creep back into Willow&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
&#39;Maybe it&#39;s just the weed&#39; She thought to herself as her phone beeped.<br />
<br />
Sent From Gene, 7:43am: Heh. Well if you&#39;re feeling like it, I could use a ride? I&#39;m about halfway there and it looks like it&#39;s about to rain...<br />
<br />
Willow sighed. She couldn&#39;t say no to the kid, even if she was entirely weirded out right now. Maybe even because she was.<br />
<br />
Sent From Willow, 7:44am: No problem!</p>
