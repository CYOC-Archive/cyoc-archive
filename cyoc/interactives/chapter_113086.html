<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well..shit,” I said. I was still trying to process what had happened, truthfully, even though I knew it didn&#39;t exactly matter any longer. That magic ring had made the impossible possible, and so it had continued after my death, which itself had been reversed.<br />
<br />
Jenny smirked slightly. “That wasn&#39;t exactly the reaction I expected,” she said as she sat down on the edge of the bed. “I figured there&#39;d be screaming, possibly threats.”<br />
<br />
“There&#39;s really no reason for all of that,” I replied. “And..like you said, I deserved what I got. I mean, don&#39;t get me wrong, I wish it hadn&#39;t gone down like that, but things got out of control, and I paid a price.”<br />
<br />
She smiled now, and I could tell it was genuine. “I&#39;m glad you see it that way. And for what it&#39;s worth, I think you&#39;ll like the world the way it is now.”<br />
<br />
“So you&#39;re in control of the ring now, I presume?” I phrased it as a question, but it was far more of a statement.<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded. “Yes, though Cathy and I generally discuss most wishes before I make them, though sometimes I slip and accidentally make one absentmindedly. It&#39;s funny, most people don&#39;t realize how often they make a wish conversationally, or what their world would be like if they had the power to make them a reality. Of course, most people aren&#39;t like the three of us.”<br />
<br />
“You can say that again,” I replied. “So, how different is the world now?”<br />
<br />
“We&#39;re at peace. The entire world. Not necessarily due to an innate human desire for pacifism, but out of practicality. When we reverted back the next day and realized what this ring could do, we set to work immediately after getting the ring off of your finger.  The first wish we made was that all nuclear weapons and missiles would be rendered inert, as would any bombs or other weapons of mass destruction and that each country would privately receive an alert to the fact. We went further, wishing that it was impossible to create a functional weapon of mass destruction ever again, that something would always go wrong. It&#39;s never been publicly acknowledged, though there&#39;s plenty of websites that will tell you that &#39;according to sources&#39; the weapons are utterly useless. Sure, there&#39;s still technically skirmishes here and there, but it&#39;s set modern warfare back by 100 years or so, and nobody is willing to push into a war, since they don&#39;t necessarily know if the other country is really without their weapons or not.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s actually pretty slick,” I said, “And a really good idea.”<br />
<br />
Jenny smiled. “Thanks; part of it was practicality though. We didn&#39;t want any country to have the option of bombing cities when werewolves started springing up en masse.”<br />
<br />
“So you two stayed werewolves, huh?” I felt a familiar thrill run through myself. Despite having been killed by a pair of shewolves, it was still a turn on.<br />
<br />
Jenny smiled wickedly at me. “Oh yes..and we hardly wanted to keep something that amazing to ourselves. And so we waited until the full moon, so..about..” she paused as she thought back, “about a week after we&#39;d gotten the ring. And then we wished that any woman who had lesbian sex after moonrise would turn into a werewolf just like we did. We knew that it would only take a single night to jump start the population of werewolves on the planet.”<br />
“Holy crap,” I said, trying to avoid thinking too much about how turned on I was getting. “But..was there much bloodshed?”<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded. “Yeah, there was. Of course, that&#39;s also when we learned that wording mattered. &#39;Turn into werewolves just like we did&#39; meant that they would be rather hungry and aggressive, so a lot of collateral damage happened. It also meant that any female werewolf, even one that had only been bitten..was now bisexual. So we modified the wish the next day. Werewolves prioritized infecting others for the next two days, rather than killing, and we made our cum infectious too.”<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t hide my erection. Jenny smiled and gave me a sultry look. “So..I see you approve?”<br />
<br />
“Heh,” I let out a slightly embarrassed chuckle. “Uhh..yeah. So how many werewolves are there now?”<br />
<br />
Jenny paused, considering the question and obviously running numbers in her head. “Well, getting a total count is impossible, until we literally have a 100% infection rate globally. As of right now, we&#39;re probably around 30% of the total population of the Earth, so..2 billion?”<br />
<br />
“Holy shit,” I gasped. “Two BILLION werewolves?”<br />
<br />
“Give or take,” Jenny told me. “It&#39;s an exponential growth, though now we&#39;re seeing a bit of a plateau, which is fine.  We have territory, and across the world, we&#39;re gaining numbers. Without the ability to wipe out large numbers of us in an instant, it&#39;s inevitable.”<br />
<br />
“But you could just wish that everyone was a werewolf, and it would eliminate the issue entirely,” I said.<br />
<br />
“We could,” Jenny acknowledged, “But that wouldn&#39;t be quite as much fun as personally infecting someone, and it would rob a certain amount of free will to do so,” she said, giving me a pointed stare as she said &#39;free will&#39;. “It&#39;s also interesting to watch how everything evolves. There&#39;s tons of websites that cater to werewolves now. Clothing that stretches as you change, specialized furniture and accessories, and resorts and vacation homes. There&#39;s even a push to get a lycanthrope pride week at Disney World, along with a werewolf cruise in the Caribbean, though neither of those has become a reality...YET.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s..interesting,” I said, trying to find the right word. “Is there much pushback in the US against werewolves?”<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded. “Mostly from the religious right and politicians, but the werewolf rights movement is gaining steam here, so we&#39;re largely protected. Still, every full moon there&#39;s at least a few incidents with police, though not where we&#39;re at.”<br />
<br />
“Where ARE we, exactly? I know it&#39;s not the apartment.”<br />
<br />
Jenny laughed. “No, we&#39;re in Las Vegas. Cathy and I run this place – it&#39;s The Den, currently the most popular casino-hotel on the Strip. And yes, we DID wish this for ourselves. Selfish? Sure, but we figured we&#39;d earned it. We&#39;re the alpha bitches of this city, and we made a deal with the mayor. Werewolves don&#39;t hunt in Vegas or the outskirts, and the police let us be. So as it sits, this is the safest place for a werewolf, and has become a destination of sorts for the people who want to get turned.”<br />
<br />
“Wow,” I said with a smile, “So nobody cares about what you are?”<br />
“They care,” Jenny corrected, “But there&#39;s very little they can do about it. The US learned quickly how dangerous angry werewolves can be, and once some of our more...vocal wolves got onto social media, we seized the moral high ground and pushed to be viewed as a protected class, particularly given how many of our population aren&#39;t straight. It worked. The humans in Vegas aren&#39;t thrilled about the fact that we can turn anyone with impunity, as long as they want it, but they don&#39;t want the conflict that stopping us will bring. And of course, now that bombs aren&#39;t working, it makes it impossible to hit us and stop it quickly.”<br />
<br />
“So, becoming a werewolf is trendy, huh?” I grinned, deliberately making a slight dig with my wording.<br />
 <br />
Jenny licked her lips and grinned. “Well..we made a couple more wishes..to make things more..conducive to infecting people. Now we don&#39;t need the moon to change...ever. It&#39;s inevitable, but just like your wish on us, all it takes is for a werewolf to play with themselves, and they can change if they want it. They can stay human too, but if they want to shift, they can make it happen. So now if someone walks in at ten  AM, we can turn them.  We also wished for orgasms to be more powerful when shifting, so all werewolves across the world are pretty much guaranteed to shift every time they fuck or masturbate. And..yeah, we also wished that literally any woman who walked into The Den will want to become a werewolf before she leaves.”</p>
