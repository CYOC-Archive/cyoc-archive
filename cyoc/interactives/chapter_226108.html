<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(authors note: it happened again. somehow my name got in the title menu.)<br />
<br />
order: Sally 1st, Caitlin 2nd, Rachael 3rd, Olivia 4th, amber 5th.<br />
<br />
current changes/spaces:<br />
<br />
Sally: 9-inch penis and a hairy sack. increased body hair. has a large manly chest. has a handsome male face. 16<br />
<br />
Caitlin/Chris: can shift to a male werewolf at will or full moon. the werewolf will be playing until the game is over. now in a policeman&#39;s uniform. 17<br />
<br />
Rachael: amazon build. perfect healthy body. breasts increased to H-cups. has a perfect tan. 17<br />
<br />
Olivia: orange-brown stallion legs. has a giant chicken butt that lays boulder-sized eggs. now has a 3 and a half foot bull/human cock. breasts will now produce milk. now has an automatic milking machine has a Ram&#39;s torso and is now 8 feet tall.. 21<br />
<br />
Amber: long tongue with silver drool. has a black and grey reptilian muzzle. has a voice that everyone agrees with. and has a long snake tail. reptilian eyes with mystic eyesight. 15<br />
<br />
dropping the dice on the table she saw it land on a 1. &quot;oh come on. Great now I&#39;m gonna change and I barely moved&quot; Sally said as she rolled her eyes. She then watched her piece move forward one space forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, that roll was such a pain in the butt. sorry again as that&#39;s not all that will be cut.&quot;<br />
<br />
suddenly Sally noticed strands of her hair falling. &quot;what! no no no!&quot; was all she could say as she ran to the mirror next to the front door. she watched as follicles were cut by unseen scissors. She was soon left with a short messy haircut that fit with the man she was slowly becoming. it felt like this game was dragging it out from the moment they started.<br />
<br />
&quot;um... hey could be worse. you could be as hairy as me&quot; Chris said gesturing to his furry body. &quot;yeah well at least you&#39;re one animal&quot; Olivia complained before they were both silenced. &quot;guys remember the game can hear us. Don&#39;t jinx yourselves&quot; Amber said. her voice once again spoke in a way that the others obeyed. picking up the dice where Sally had dropped it Chris rolled. getting a 4 he picked up his card.<br />
<br />
&quot;to complement the outfit you now dawn. Here are some brains to match your brawn&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly Chris dropped the card and gripped his head. Caitlin was already smart at an IQ of 108. however, Chris felt his brain expand in intelligence and knowledge. his IQ was now that of 328. knowledge of every police procedure and tactic now laid within his head.<br />
<br />
he removed his hands from his head and looked around. with the vast knowledge he now possessed he wondered about the game. it broke every law he now knew. &quot;you okay Chris?&quot; Olivia said concerned as well as Amber and Sally. while they were asking Racheal grabbed the dice.<br />
<br />
&quot;yes, I am. My intelligence is now far superior than before. most of it seems to be in police work&quot; he said before the others heard the dice connect with the table. they saw the Rachael&#39;s piece move forward 5 spaces. she grabbed the card the instant it left its slot.<br />
<br />
&quot;it&#39;s time for some class. you now have a big ass&quot;<br />
<br />
she squealed in excitement as her rear expanded. She now had a butt that fit the size of her breasts. &quot;okay I think it&#39;s showing favoritism&quot; Olivia said. &quot;guys I think this game is influenced by us. the more negative we think and feel the worse our changes.<br />
<br />
Caitlin was negative and now I&#39;m here. I&#39;m not saying we will get changes we don&#39;t like but maybe if we&#39;re positive about it we can get through this.&quot; Chris said. Amber thought about this. She had been neutral and gotten changes she neither liked nor hated. sally and Olivia were both upset with what had happened.<br />
<br />
Chris and Rachael had been positive and gotten positive changes. &quot;whatever. let&#39;s just get this over with&quot; Olivia said as she rolled her dice. landing on a three she saw her piece move. she then snatched the card from its slot.<br />
<br />
&quot;a couple more rounds and you&#39;ll be free. till then you&#39;ll have as many arms as a bee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;what! Are you kidding me?&quot; Olivia said as her arms began to split apart. her new lower arms now rested halfway between her original and her hips. the split ow left her with two fingers on each hand. each one was identical in length and size. her thumbs lengthened but not as much as the others.<br />
<br />
the bones inside became liquid as they oozed out of the pores of her arm. ironically this made her feel like honey was covering her arms. her new exoskeleton finished covering her arms and hands. she eyed the black appendages before a familiar feeling came over her. her hybrid bull cock exited its sheath and the milking machine went to work.<br />
<br />
As it did another boulder-sized egg popped out of her chicken rear. &quot;well that will be more helpful&quot; Chris grinned nervously. &quot;it was bad enough that animals were included. now I have bee arms.&quot; she cried out as she put her upper hands to her face. the lower pair was now crossed.<br />
<br />
&quot;hey if it helps the game kinda gave you some dexterity. bees don&#39;t have fingers so...&quot; Chris said before Olivia&#39;s annoyed expression stopped him mid-sentence. &quot;look guys we need to keep our heads. just because we don&#39;t like our changes doesn&#39;t mean we should get upset with each other.&quot; Amber said. for once Olivia interjected.<br />
<br />
&quot;speak for yourself. it&#39;s Sally&#39;s fault she was the one who bought the game!&quot; Olivia said as she pointed her upper right arm to her friend. &quot;hey do you think I want to be a freaky man creature.&quot; Sally said. &quot;ENOUGH!&quot; Amber cried as she took her dice. &quot;if we continue to fight we will not get out&quot; She then rolled her dice and got a 6. Trying to be positive she picked her card from the slot.<br />
<br />
&quot;to keep your positive mindset from starting to wane. here is a silver mane.&quot;<br />
<br />
like the game said her hair began to change. any color in her hair was leeched out leaving silver in its wake. this time it was Amber who took a look at the mirror. instead of being cut, her hair seemed to be growing. she then noticed how it wasn&#39;t as movable as it had been.<br />
<br />
checking her back in the mirror she saw why. the silver mane was running down her back. it was actually shorter but didn&#39;t appear that way due to how much there was. Amber would never admit it but this pleased her. going back to the table she saw her piece now further along.<br />
<br />
&quot;see you two. I didn&#39;t think negatively so I got something I can live with&quot; she said sitting down. Olivia had reached her breaking point. she screamed and rushed towards the game fists first. just then she froze. not to say that she stopped.<br />
<br />
she was literally frozen in time. the spit that had left her mouth as she had run toward it was suspended in mid-air. &quot;what just happened?&quot; Chris said. a card that popped out of the slot. they were confused as Sally had yet to pick up the dice. &quot;I think the game gave it to us,&quot; Chris said. picking up the card she gulped at what it said.<br />
<br />
&quot;do not mourn. this is something I forgot to warn. if your friend was to react. then the changes would remain a fact. so the roll next will be choice. to deal with the angered voice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess that means the next roll I do chooses her punishment,&quot; Sally said. &quot;I&#39;m afraid so,&quot; Amber said waving her hand in front of the girl&#39;s eyes. &quot;if what it said was true well... we would be stuck like this forever. think about it. no winner no wish&quot; Chris said. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind this body,&quot; Rachael said only to get the others to stare at her. turning the card over listed the punishments.<br />
<br />
1. becoming feral<br />
2. personality shift<br />
3. another change<br />
4. become a pet<br />
5. become a man completely<br />
6. no change<br />
<br />
&quot;From what it looks like 6 is her best option,&quot; Sally said as Chris moved Olivia back. taking the dice she tossed them. they all saw it land on...</p>
