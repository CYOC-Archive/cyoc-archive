<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>"Okay," Jennifer said, relieved that she was finally going to finish this drawn-out 
phone call. "Transform or Dare?"
<P>But those last words were drowned out on Claire's end by the ringing of her doorbell. 
Sound traveled easily through her old house, so it was plainly audible even from the 
basement.
<P>"I'm sorry, Jenn. Hold on one more second," Claire apologized. She put the receiver 
down and trotted back upstairs.
<P>She knew the curse would allow everyone else to behave like nothing was unusual, but 
she still hesitated to open the door. Peering through the spyhole, she saw a short balding 
man and an average-looking thirty-something holding a briefcase. They were both 
dressed in business suits.
<P>She took a deep breath and opened the door. Neither of the men appeared shocked or 
frightened at all. In fact, smiles broke out on the short man's face when he saw her.
<P>"Ah, Claire," he said. "I was beginning to think you weren't home this evening. So nice 
to see you again."
<P>"It's always a pleasure, Mr... Mr..." As Claire stumbled on the name, the right one 
somehow popped into her head. "Mr. Cottington." Claire began to magically recognize the 
man as the owner of the nearby city's textile factory, where her spider silk was sold. The 
larger man was an agent of the company, fulfilling several duties including security of 
cargo transport and monetary exchange.
<P>"Oh, the pleasure is all ours," the man replied. "We're just here for the weekly pick-up. 
I trust it's all in the garage?"
<P>"Um...that's right!" Claire played along. "Take what you want."
<P>"You know we will," he smiled. "Now, if we may have a fresh sample for quality 
comparison before we inspect the barrels in the garage?" The man extended his hand, 
which held a foot-long zip-lock bag.
<P>"Er...right. Just wait here one second," Claire took the bag and closed the door. Maybe 
they would think it was rude, but for now she was definitely uncomfortable with shooting 
silk out of her butt in front of people. Okay, so it wasn't technically her butt, it was close 
enough. She tried to reach behind her and place the bag under her spinner, but her 
abdomen was so long she just couldn't reach. So, she simply shot out a few yards of silver 
onto the tile floor, scooped them up and stuffed them into the bag.
<P>"Here you go," she smiled after giving the sample to Mr. Cottington. "Hope it's up to 
par."
<P>The man held the bag up to the porch light and grinned. "It certainly looks it. That 
silver shine is unmistakable."
<P>"I'm just glad it's worth your trouble."
<P>"AND our money, of course!" the man chuckled. "After all, when you're selling silk 
clothing that's made out of pure silver, you can afford to pay the help all they deserve. 
Would you mind opening the garage door for us, dear?"
<P>"Yeah, sure," Claire said, a bit distracted. She was in awe as she walked through the 
house to get inside the garage. The stuff she was spinning was actually <I>silver</I>? 
This new twist, combined with everything else that had happened in the last hour, was 
sending her head swimming.
<P>When she turned the light on in the garage, she saw a dozen barrels stacked along the 
wall. She was sure they were all full to the brim of her silver silk. <I>I have to spin this 
much a week?</I> she thought. On the other hand, it probably translated to quite a lot of 
money. She found the garage door opener and pressed it.
<P>As they entered the garage, the bald man said "Thank you, Claire. We'll tally the 
weight of this shipment and leave the check in your mailbox. And I'll throw in a little extra 
so you can buy yourself a new shirt," he winked.
<P>Claire's brown cheeks blushed red. She had torn holes when her second pair of arms 
had grown in. She wondered if her dresser's wardrobe had changed to suit her new 
physical dimensions.
<P>"Have a good night," he concluded.
<P>"You too, Mr. Cottington," Claire smiled as she stepped back inside and closed the 
door. She scrambled back down to the basement to tell Jennifer the fantastic news.
<P>"Jennifer! You won't believe this, but the silk I'm spinning is pure silver!"
<P>"I guess it would have to be to be worth something serious," Jennifer responded rather 
flatly. Just by hearing the tone of her voice, Claire was reminded of the transformation she 
had made earlier.
<P>"Uh-oh," she said. "I forgot about..."
<P>"Yeah," Jennifer said. "Well, that'll be cleared up soon enough, won't it?" Jennifer had 
taken the time to remove her clothes, which had long since become unbearable to wear 
under all of her wool...not to mention unnecessary, since almost all of her body was 
completely shrouded in black tangles. Her seventeen-inch locks were so long, their 
weight was starting to pull the curl out of them. She had to constantly brush the thick hair 
out of her face, and her ears and horns were just barely poking out from atop the sea of 
shining ebony strands.
<P>"You might not have heard me, but I said 'Transform or Dare' to you before you went 
off," she informed Claire. "So that means you're going to get both now."
<P>"Okay," Claire said. "Well, I don't want to change back anymore, that's for sure. I could 
really get used to this. Living in the basement seems kind of cool."
<P>"So, what do you want me to do with your transformation?" Jennifer demanded. "Stop 
beating around the bush and give me a real answer."</p>
