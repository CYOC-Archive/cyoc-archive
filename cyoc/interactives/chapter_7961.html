<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James looked up and down his new punks, and he liked what he saw. The two ex-bible students were still a little dazed from their transformation, after all it's not everyday you transform from a straight laced Christian into an outlandish gay punk. James pounced on this opportunity, literally as he sank his tongue down Charlie's throat, welcoming him into James' fold. <br />
<br />
As he was giving Charlie his first long passionate kiss, James ran his hand up to Charlie's head and through his Mohawk and a slight tingle passed through James, from the excitement of finally getting his mitts on some punk-boys to play with, and it felt good.<br />
<br />
While James embraced Charlie, Andy slowly came round to his new way of life. At first he was shocked to see his best friend tongue-locked with another man, but then gradually he shock became due to the fact that his best mate was entwined with a sk8r. This phased him slightly, but then he figured if it was good enough for his mate, it was good enough for him too, and so he moved up behind James and started to kiss the sk8r's neck as he rubbed his leather trousers against James' baggy shorts.<br />
<br />
It was then the punk felt a bulge in one of James pockets, and it wasn't the manly one Andy was expecting, but a hard boxlike one. Slipping his hand into his maker’s pocket he pulled out the palmtop James used for his transformations. James never even noticed as he was far too busy inspecting Charlie's package with his tongue to be concerned about such things, and in his rush to experience the punks he had created he had created he had forgot to lock the maker to stop anyone else using it.<br />
<br />
The first James new about his mistake was, after Andy had started to play with James details, when he suddenly started to feel a little odd. James was far too busy with his new project to pay any attention to these feelings or the slight tingle of pain coming from his left eyebrow, right ear and his nipples. If he had been bothered he may have noticed, as Andy did, that James was now sporting some new jewelery in the form of a pair of nipple rings, a bar through one ear and a small skull and cross bones in one eyebrow. Andy smiled at the initial modifications, and was even more pleased that James had just accepted them as he had programmed. <br />
<br />
James now looked like a skate punk, with his new piercings and his baggy clothes, but all that was about to change thanks to Andy. The transformation carried on from the bottom and worked upwards. James sneakers suddenly gave way to black leather, and momentarily he looked like he was wearing a pair of school shoes, however this did not last long as the shoes then proceeded up James legs, until they stopped, now being a pair of knee high leather boots with metal straps running all the way down the front. A faint ripping sound was heard as the knees of James' shorts ripped as they extended down his legs covering the tops of the boots. Then the khaki material started to take on a blue colour as it turned into the denim of James' new ripped jeans.<br />
<br />
Next James' top began to change. First the baggy t-shirt started to lose it's loose material and it's colour, until James was clad in a tight black muscle shirt, which really showed off his well defined pecs and 6 pack.. It then started to loose it's substance becoming gradually more see through, as the material changed into a mesh, allowing Andy to see the metal of James' nipple piercings glinting in the midday sun.<br />
<br />
James now very nearly looked like the complete package, all that was left to transform was James hair, as the sk8r style didn't really go with his new look. As Andy looked on, James head rapidly lost all of it hair. Then spikes burst from his scalp in two parallel lines running down either side of his head and standing proudly at 4 inches. The row above his left eye then turned blood red, while those above his right were sky blue.<br />
<br />
It was only now the transformation was complete that Charlie let James out of their passionate embrace, and James was able to notice his new look. At first he couldn't understand how it had happened, or just how hot he looked with his tight clothes and piercings. But it sank in and his only regret was that he hadn't become a punk sooner.<br />
<br />
As he took his palmtop back off Andy and slipped it into the pocket of his leather jacket, which his old skateboard had morphed into, James offered to take the two punks home and show them just how thankful his was for his new lifestyle.<br />
<br />
As they headed back to his place, James knew he was gonna have a lot of fun with his new punk boys, and couldn't wait to use the maker to expand his new gang.</p>
