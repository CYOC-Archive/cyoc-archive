<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When I arrived at work I found I was to be on the front desk again, greeting customers and answering the phone. For the morning Karen would be working with me. When not busy I was to order new brochures from Mazda head office that I had identified we lacked on Monday. <br />
After morning tea there was a lot of excitement when a car carrier pulled up out the front. On it were the new 2018 models that we would be launching at the upcoming motor show. A red MX-5 was particularly impressive.<br />
Once the new cars were unloaded, Gerard the head salesman wanted to get photos of them lined up in front of the dealership. We watched as the sales team positioned the new vehicles and moved the older models elsewhere. When he was satisfied Gerard produced a camera with a very large lense and started taking shots.<br />
Eventually he approached us and asked if either Karen or myself could take pictures of him and the rest of the sales team in front of the cars. I fancied myself as a bit of a photographer so volunteered. <br />
I had them stand next to each of the models and got shots from various angles with the dealership name in the background. Gerard came and had a look when I indicated that I thought I had captured everything he wanted. He gave a grunts of approval as he worked his way through the digital images. I felt very pleased with myself.<br />
I thought we were done but when I went to walk back inside Gerard asked could he get some shots of Karen and myself with the vehicles. We assented and posed as directed besides each of the models. <br />
As Gerard was shooting us beside the last car, the MX-5, Karen said to me “Come on Sarah, let’s have some fun” She draped herself over the bonnet and blew kisses at the camera. Not wanting to appear to be a wet fish, I tried to adopt what I thought might be sexy poses and pouts of my own. Karen undid the top buttons on her shirt to show a bit of cleavage whilst Gerard clicked away encouraging us. Our behavior quickly drew a raucous crowd with various suggestions for poses coming our way. It was only when I recognized Mitch’s voice make a particularly lewd comment that I decided we had done enough. <br />
I dragged a giggling Karen back into the showroom. To be greeted by Marlene who said “Ok girls, you’ve had your fun. Time to get back to work” I noticed she had a smile on her face.<br />
Over lunch, for me sandwiches from the local takeaway, I told Karen and Marlene about moving into Rod’s. It turned out that Marlene only lived a couple of blocks away. She was planning to take a taxi to and from the cocktail dinner on Friday and suggested we could share a ride. I replied that I thought that would be a good idea.<br />
The rest of the day went very quickly without incident. As we knocked off for the day Karen reminded me about the netball game tonight and told me to meet her in the locker room at the indoor stadium at 7.15. <br />
……….<br />
As I drove home I thought about my conversation with Rod this morning. Did I really want to go through with it? Have sex with him? I still had reservations but the idea was very appealing. I felt very moist down below.<br />
Rod’s and my own &#39;Zach’ car were at the house when I pulled up. I entered to be greeted enthusiastically by Biddy. Sarah and Rod were in the lounge, each with a beer. <br />
Sarah, whom I had swapped bodies with, said he couldn’t stay long. He just wanted to know whether my period was easing so we could arrange a time to swap back. Amanda’s parents had invited ‘Zach’ for dinner Thursday night at 7. He would need to pick up Amanda from her flat at ~ 6.45 to arrive there on time. <br />
I said “Give me a moment” put my bag down in the spare bedroom and went to the toilet. The pad was only spotted with blood. I had changed pads at about 3 so this spotting had occurred in the last 2 ½ hours. I changed again then reported what I had seen both now and earlier in the day to Sarah.<br />
He said “My experience is that once the flow stops I have about 36 hours of spotting. We might be lucky and be able to swap back tomorrow morning. I’ll come around in the morning and we can give it a try. If not we can try again after work tomorrow”<br />
“Ok, make it 7.30am so we’ll have time to complete the change”<br />
“Righto… I had better go, I’m taking Amanda to the Chick flick festival at the cinema. I’m to pick her up at 6”<br />
As Sarah left I reminded Rod that I had a Netball game and needed to be there by 7.15. He said he would take Biddy for a quick walk then make a light dinner for us both.<br />
I went to my room and identified the sports briefs, sports bra and socks and runners I needed for netball. If Sarah had a tracksuit then it must have been amongst the clothes remaining at the McKenzie’s. I thought about another shower but decided I would need one after the game anyway, so just applied deodorant. I put the clothes on, completing the outfit with shorts and a tee-shirt.<br />
Rod and Biddy came back while I was exiting the room and while Rod was preparing dinner I thought to look up the rules of netball on his computer. Although netball had been very popular amongst the girls at school, I had limited experience with the game. I did not have any sisters and neither Amanda nor any of my previous girlfriends were netballers. I was getting my head around the zones and which players could be in each zone when I heard the microwave ping. Rod announced dinner was ready.<br />
Dinner consisted of a meat pie and a beer. The sort of meal I often made for myself. In my current female body I found this was more than I could handle. Neither of us mentioned this morning’s conversation as we ate.<br />
When the clocked ticked to 7, I said. ”Time to go, see you later”<br />
“Good Luck” was Rod’s reply as I headed out the door.<br />
…………<br />
I parked at the stadium and made my way to the women’s change room. I knew the stadium as it was the same venue Rod and I played basketball at. I had often dreamed of entering the girls change room imagining it an exotic place where girls scrubbed each other’s backs in the shower, but once inside it seemed identical to the men’s. It was empty as I entered so I sat down on a bench to wait for Karen. <br />
It wasn’t long before I could hear Karen chatting with someone enter the room. She said to her friend “Here she is. Kate, do you remember Sarah, she filled in once last year”<br />
“Hi Sarah” said Kate. She seemed very tall and towered over Karen. I was currently in a body that was only 5 foot 6. By my estimate Kate was at least 6 foot tall.<br />
“Nice to meet you again Kate” I replied.<br />
Karen ruffled through her bag and produced a green pleated skirt and a yellow singlet top, identical to what she was already wearing and handed them to me. I took the hint and started removing my shirt and shorts to don the netball uniform. Kate had already taken out her own gear and was getting changed as well.<br />
Other groups of girls wandered in but they must have been in opposition teams as none of them approached us and they wore different  uniforms. I recognized Millie, one of the office girls from the transport depot where, as Zach, I used to work. However she did not recognize me, so I pretended not to know her either. I chuckled inside, but tried not to stare, as I caught a glimpse of a silky pink bra as she changed.<br />
Once I was in uniform Karen suggested it was time to warm up and meet the rest of the team. I followed her down to the most distant court where I could see four other girls in the same uniform as I wore, passing a ball around. I recognized two of them as girls from school, Jenny had been in the same year as me and was one of the more sporty girls. Also there was her older sister Bianca, who had been in the year above me, the same class as Jenna. I could not recall whether she and Jenna had been friends.<br />
I was introduced to everyone by Karen. The all seemed friendly. We joined in the warm-up. Karen must have been the captain as she was the one who lead the warm-up drills. I think I acquitted myself well, as Jenny said “Good to see that you have learnt to catch”<br />
After 5 minutes Karen produced &#39;bibs&#39; from a bag and passed them around. I was given a bib with the letters ‘WD’ written on it. I had been forewarned that I would be playing as Wing Defence, so had learnt that I was not allowed in the forward third of the court or in the defensive goal circle. <br />
Karen told be my job was to stop the opposition WA (Wing Attack) getting the ball and to intercept opposition passes if I had the opportunity. Karen herself was playing C (Centre) whilst Bianca and Jenny were Goal Defence and Goal Keeper respectfully. They were the girls who would be playing near me. The rest of the team consisted of Kate who was goal shooter and twins Mary and Rose who wore GA and WA bibs.<br />
It was time to start. I followed the opposition girl with the WA bib. I thought I was in a good defensive position standing between the GA and where the center toss would take place. Fortunately Bianca saw where I was and whispered “Into the third” in time for me to get to the other side of the line before the umpire blew a whistle to start the game. <br />
In a flash my opponent had received and passed on the ball to their shooter and they had a goal on the board. As the ball was getting brought back to the middle Bianca said “Copy my positioning”. We had the next center pass and it ended with Kate scoring a goal for our team. <br />
Next center pass was the oppositions, I copied Bianca’s defensive position and although the WA still received the ball, I forced her to send a high pass, which Bianca was able to intercept. She sent the ball via Karen down to the other end where Kate scored again. Bianca came over and gave me a high 5 and said “That’s the way girl, let’s get some more of those” <br />
In no time at all it was quarter time, we led 11 – 6, I had made 2 intercepts myself and like to think I contributed to 4 more taken by Bianca and Jenny. We huddled together and Karen singled me out to say well done. I had not fumbled once. I felt very pleased with myself.<br />
We ended up winning 46 - 19 and all the team had big smiles on their faces. They asked had I been playing elsewhere as they had remembered me as being rather clumsy when I had filled in last year. I modestly said I had been working on my fitness. I could hardly say that I was an A grade basketballer could I?<br />
Karen said to wear the uniform home if I liked, just to wash it and bring it to work before the game next week. She suggested that if they were short of players again she would call on me. For the real Sarah’s sake I was non-committal.<br />
…………<br />
As I drove back to Rod’s I was feeling very good about myself.  I wondered how the rest of the day might turn out.</p>
