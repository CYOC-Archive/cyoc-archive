<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ted was a split personality when the farmer left to go get him a doe goat to satisfy his intense feelings of animalistic lust. To one side of his mind he remained a logical thinking rational, moral person, while the other new conscious bestial side wished to ignore concepts like morality, religion, even all the wealth of what he was schooled in for the many years of studies, all it wanted of him to do as be was a dumb brute buck.<br />
<br />
He had to admit his senses were heightened by the curse changing him to be a goat. He could smell the varied scents there in that crate, smells of each person changed, as from where they puked, urinated, or crapped. His hearing was quite acute, as in the distance he could hear the doe goat rebelling as the farmer man drug her back to where she remembered was a place of dreaded horror, the crate.  <br />
<br />
Ted would if he could again speak intelligible English, as tell that being covered in a dense pelt of fur made his scared self feel warm and the being a goat as if inviting. He had never paid much attention to what a male goat ad for balls, but his were weighty and large, they reminded him of fur covered potatoes. He wondered if his testicles were fully matured, or would they get bigger with constant use and aging?<br />
<br />
He felt very satisfied with how the curse caused his penis to grow longer, although it lost some girth and his circumcision was gone, replaced by a cock what narrowed to a pointed cone shape. Although from his several times masturbating the new cock, it seemed that size mattered little, as the skin on it was highly sensitive and fairly easy to arouse to an orgasm. <br />
<br />
Ted still had a pained forehead where the two goat horns sprouted, grew, and became as weapons for defending his right to breed.<br />
<br />
While having to wait for the farmer to return with his first doe betrothal, Ted rose to stand on four legs and discover the feelings from standing on cloven hoofs. Being a goat was quite different but not as terrible as he first expected. The longer a time he was a goat the more it tended to offer him many delightful ways of comfort. As from what the farmer man said of Ted and his blue eyes being decidedly retained for him by the curse, he saw things in colors but different with rectangle shaped pupils.<br />
<br />
&quot;BAA...,&quot; Ted bleated, his being able to only speak in such a monotone fashion caused his active mind to struggle with ways to shape words, only to fail from lips and his muzzle shaped mouth. Frustrated, Ted tried and continued to bleat, holding his lips and tongue in varied positions, holding a hope me might fashion a way to learn to talk with some affluence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baa, baa..., baa, baa, baa,&quot; said a shrill voice of a very horny doe goat, she standing suddenly there in the doorway to the magical cursed crate.<br />
<br />
&quot;BAA?&quot; bleated Ted, his bleat a question posing tone as asking the obvious questions of who are you, and what are you here for???<br />
<br />
Sheryl, she being the blonde niece to the farmer man came there some many months previous and with following her uncle everywhere she went, being a pest to him, he suggested she needed to crawl through the crate to get him something. She did as asked of her, wishing to be helpful to her Uncle, she entered the crate and came out the far side some hour later, bleating a ranting only her Uncle knew was a female suddenly set free from any concerns of living a moral lifestyle.<br />
<br />
To suggest that Sheryl from becoming a doe goat held to being moral would make a person watching her daily fun as laugh and laugh until they fainted.<br />
<br />
Sheryl ran after Ted, as her Uncle sat outside the crate and laughed. She chased Ted around inside the crate, finally cornering the new buck, before she turned tail and backed her flat butt snug up to his soft muzzle nose. Ted knew his fate, he was fully rational and maybe that was what the curse wanted, for him to know fear by needing to live his life being a herd-sire buck goat.<br />
<br />
Sheryl was always a pushy female, she having cornered many boyfriends and got them to tickle her fancy. She did about the same to Ted to try a breakdown his ideals of being moral and being a male goat, somewhat of an oxymoron a situation.<br />
<br />
Stalwart as he had lived morally for his short lifetime, Ted tried not to feel aroused, but his goat sensory was working against him. When he would not jump on the back of Sheryl, she began backing up her rump under Ted, lifting his bulkier self into the position to where if aroused and with an erection, his pointy cock might then penetrate her winking brown colored...<br />
<br />
Suddenly from the darker corner of the crate, the farmer Uncle heard Ted scream &quot;BAA, Noh..., BAA..., BAA..., BAA, HUH, HUH, HUH...!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations there my new buck, you made the grade and can exit the crate along with niece Sheryl. Sheryl dear you did well, I am proud of you as much as might be your parents if they were to learn the hard way of where you vanished to, and live a life of gusto.&quot; A proud farmer and Uncle said to his niece and her accomplished big buck.</p>
