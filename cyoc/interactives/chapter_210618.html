<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The rain didn&#39;t show any signs of stopping. Adrian, Paul, Brad and Isaac couldn&#39;t believe the bad luck they were having. After renting a rather large cabin for the entire weekend, they only found out it was supposed to rain nearly nonstop when they got there. To make it even worse the satellite dish wasn&#39;t working either, so no TV. Nor was the internet the owners had promised. Now they were rained in for the entire weekend with nothing to keep them entertained as the road had flooded making it impossible for them to pass.<br />
<br />
&quot;It could be worse,&quot; Isaac offered. The other three threw an angry glare at him. &quot;What? The cabin could be flooded too. Or we could have done what Brad suggested and not bought food before we came up here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Brad&#39;s glare only deepened while the other two went back to minding their own business. Adrian was busy looking through a book while Paul laid on his back, staring blankly up at the ceiling. Meanwhile, Brad was still desperately trying to get a signal. <br />
<br />
&quot;How about a board game?&quot; Isaac offered, trying to ease the tension he&#39;d accidentally created. The other three gave him another huff as he headed over to the shelf. He looked around, however his eyes just kept going to a bright yellow box with bubbly letters shaped like different animal tails on it reading, &#39;Furry Fun.&#39; Every time he&#39;d look at a different game, his eyes would trail back to this one. &quot;How about this one?&quot; he finally gave into the urge and showed the other guys.<br />
<br />
Brad&#39;s eyes raised from his phone but remained angry slits. &quot;You&#39;ve got to be shitting me,&quot; he growled. He was a jock through and through, proud of his muscular body and not willing to try something that he didn&#39;t deem immediately cool. Even without the internet, he was happily taking selfies of his thick, toned arms and making sure to pretend as though the cabin was better than it actually was.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Isaac asked, adjusting his glasses. He&#39;d always been a bit dorkier than the rest of the guys. Even if he was big enough to be on the football team, he was still only a kicker. He looked almost thin compared to the other men around him. But at the same time, a kicker didn&#39;t need to be big or bulky. He just needed to be able to kick. And plus, when he played soccer in the spring, he&#39;d still need to be fast. <br />
<br />
Paul belted out a laugh. &quot;Look at the box again and ask yourself the question again.&quot; He was built to a similar size as Brad, if not a bit bigger. He loved the gym and showing off to the girls more than actually playing. Not that coach didn&#39;t notice either, as Paul tended to be second string anyways. Being so focused on how he looked, he oftentimes found himself a bit slower or not properly eating to really show off the six pack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Adrian added. The group looked at him. Shock and confusion melded together at the largest of them. Adrian was a big burly man who was a prefect defensive tackle. His naturally tall and broad build made it near impossible for anyone to get past him. And his thick meaty thighs helped plant him in the ground making sure he&#39;d never fall over. &quot;What?&quot; he glared back. &quot;What else are we going to do.&quot; He didn&#39;t want to admit that something inside him was telling him that they should play. It was this weird urge that was slowly surfacing the longer he looked at the box. Part of him wondered if the other guys had it and were just acting their usual tough self, or if it was just him and he was bored out of his mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Two to play?&quot; Isaac tossed up two fingers and looked at the other two jocks. &quot;Games are more fun with more people...&quot; He raised his voice as though it were some kind of incentive for them to join.<br />
<br />
Brad let out a huff. &quot;Fine. Let&#39;s at least see it.&quot; With the affirmative answer Isaac rushed over to the table, clearing the center piece off the table and opening the box. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Paul stared a bit in disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;What else are we going to do?&quot; Brad asked. &quot;I&#39;m tired of trying to get a signal. Maybe this&#39;ll make the time go by faster.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine...&quot; Paul relented and sat down.<br />
<br />
Isaac was busy pulling out the board and all its pieces. There were several decks of cards, a die, and a coin. The square board had a square in the center of it that said, &#39;Furry Fun!&#39; and then several paths leading outward toward a large circle with a path of squares around it. It almost looked like a Trivial Pursuit board but these didn&#39;t look like knowledge categories. And the larger squares where you would be able to get your pie piece were instead something more like animal parts. Ears, eyes, nose, tail, one had paws for hands and one had paws for feet, and then fur were in each of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Weird...&quot; Adrian was starting to regret his decision a bit as he looked at the board. He tried to distract himself by picking up one of the &#39;Truth or Dare&#39; cards. However, when he turned it over, it was completely blank. He did a few more only to find the same thing. &quot;What the hell?&quot; He went over to the &#39;Act it Out&#39; cards. It was exactly the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop that,&quot; Isaac slapped the cards out of his hand and restacked the deck. Then put his nose back into the instructions. &quot;We&#39;re supposed to go in blind.&quot; Adrian gave a huff and sat silently while Isaac browsed the rules. &quot;Alright. First pick a color.&quot; Isaac grabbed the yellow one, Adrian went for brown, Paul went for white, and Brad picked the black piece. &quot;Okay, now put them on the Furry Fun! square and then we&#39;re supposed to take turns rolling and then what we land on determines which card we&#39;re supposed to read. &#39;Act it Out,&#39; the player must do what is on the card or face a penalty, &#39;Show What You Know&#39; the player must truthfully answer the question on the card or face a penalty, &#39;Physical Challange&#39; and &#39;Truth or Dare&#39; are just as they sound. With Truth or Dare you have to do one from each of the players. But this &#39;Two Truths and a Lie&#39; one is kind of creepy. It says, &#39;The player who lands on this space must tell two truths and one lie. The other players must guess which one is false. However, if all players are wrong, the player who landed on the space receives a punishment. Make sure you&#39;re lie sounds believable otherwise it might become the truth. What the hell does that mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who cares,&quot; Brad dismissed. &quot;Let&#39;s just play already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. Fine,&quot; Isaac continued skimming the rules. &quot;Let me get to how to play... A player must win before the game is finished. Players may go either direction on the outer circle but when two players land on the same space the two much face off each other on the square and receive a special reward for the winner. Players must finish the game by collecting all the pieces on the board. When landing on one of the larger squares roll the die to see which card to pick up. 1. Act it Out, 2. Physical Challenge, 3. Truth or Dare, 4. Show What You Know, 5. Two Truths and a Lie, 6. Players Choice. Oh! And one more thing, apparently you have to flip a coin whenever you hit a crossroads, heads continue on the outer circle, tails head towards the &#39;Furry Fun!&#39; square in the center.&quot; He held up the coin with a fox tail on one side and a fox face on the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything else?&quot; Paul demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently we&#39;re just supposed to say our favorite animal at the same time and then the first player gets to roll,&quot; Isaac shrugged. &quot;Ready? 1.2.3. Lion.&quot;<br />
&quot;Bear,&quot; Adrian said.<br />
&quot;Rabbit,&quot; Paul said.<br />
&quot;Wolf,&quot; Brad said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then Adrian goes first because his animal comes first in alphabetical order,&quot; Isaac said. He passed the die to Adrian.</p>
