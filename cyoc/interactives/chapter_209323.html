<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The velociraptor that was once Jeff was in a panic, thrashing around his former room, trying to figure out how to get out of it.  This lead to him trashing everything in his room, including the computer that had the Chronivac on.  When he destroyed the computer, an error on the program was made before the system shut down and did something.  What that something was is the most bizarre.<br />
<br />
The raptor was slowly pacing around the room, wondering how to get out of it completely.  But as it was trying to figure it out, something strange was happening around him.  For one the wallpaper around the walls and peeling off and deteriorating away as the walls behind it crack and crumble to reveal the inner workings.  The bed, which was torn off by Jeff’s constant thrashing, was tearing itself up with cotton and springs popping off and the wooden frame rotting.  The glass on the small window started to shatter as pieces begin falling to the floor.  All random objects around the room begin to rot, deteriorate, or unravel.  Even the lighting fixtures on the ceiling and lamp were short-circuiting before the bulbs burned out and exploded in pieces, leaving the place in darkness.  The dinosaur could see the room breaking apart, wondering what was going on in his small and primitive mind, unaware that the Chronivac is doing something to it.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the floor started to get weak as the carpet broke apart as the plywood underneath it begins to break down.  With the raptor’s weight, the floor started to give way, taking him and the deteriorating things with it.  After a short drop, the former Jeff landed in the family room where everyone wishes to get together and hang out.  But getting up, the velociraptor could see that it is going the way of the room.<br />
<br />
The wallpaper was peeling and chipping as more inner workings were being revealed, as they too were breaking apart.  The big screen TV that was held to the wall dropped and cracked as the screen burst and frame breaking down.  The cable box and game consoles joined as well as they too were breaking up with the inner workings sparking and catching fire.  The sofa and lazy boy chairs were tearing apart as more springs and fluff seeping out.  The lamps and ceiling light were blown out left that place in complete darkness.  In fact, the only light would be the window as the glass shattered and the drapes unravel.  Even the portraits of family on the walls begin to drop off as the glass shattered, wood rotting and pictures crumbling.  The raptor look to the dissolving room and feared the worse.  If he doesn’t get out of this death trap in time, he would get crushed to death.  In a panic, he ran with his power legs out of the deteriorating living room, just in time for the rest of the ceiling to gave way, dropping what’s left of Jeff’s bed in the process, which is nothing more then a rotting frame and rusting metal mattress with little cusioners.<br />
<br />
The raptor went into a small hallway with a set of steps leading to the upstairs as that was breaking apart and the walls next to it begin to crumble and the pictures on the walls dropped down to the floor.  In front of him is a door that looks like it rotting away with the wood.  The metal hinges soon rust and break apart, causing the door to tilt and fall to the ground.  That led to Jeff seeing the outside right in front of him.  Seeing that, he ran to the door in order to get out.  But before he could do, part of the ceiling collapsed and blocks the way out completely.  Knowing his way out is blocked; he needs to find an alternate route to escape.  Suddenly, he heard a dog coming from close by.  No doubt, it was the family dog that is barking in a panic.  Using his hearing, it sounds like it’s coming from the left side.  Turning his head to the doorway, he ran through it and entered the kitchen and dinning room area.  By the time he entered, both room were affected by the strange deterioration.<br />
<br />
With the wallpaper peeling and the inner walls cracking in the dinning room, the kitchen has tiles that were popping off and breaking apart.  All the stainless steel kitchen appliances were started to rust and break down.  Even the hinges of the fridge burst and the doors plummet as the food inside it started to expire quickly and went all moldy and imperishable.  So much so that fungus and flowers grew out of the mold and covered both the fridge and freezer entirely.  The stove soon started to malfunction and burst out in flames, catching the rotting cabinets on fire.  That lead to the fire alarms blaring before the batteries died out completely and the devices broke apart.  The lighting fixture over the kitchen table burned out as the chain attached to it got rusted out and snapped, letting it tall the to table.  The table itself, which was already rotting away, broke apart easily as the plates and silverware scattered and shattered.  Even the chairs began to give way as the legs snapped from the rotted wood and crumbled away.  The velociraptor looked up and could see the ceiling cracking, as it would be a matter of time before this area gets caved in.  Trying to hear the dog, he could tell that it was coming from close by.  Looking ahead, he could see that there were some glass sliders leading to the backyard.  All that glass has already shattered as it open air blew through.  Seeing that as a way out, he ran as fast as his legs can as the room behind him caved in and the ceiling broke apart, showing what looked like both the master bedroom and bathroom.  Even the toilet and sink got dropped down as water started to pout out of the rusting pipes.  Getting through the open air, he entered the patio area where there plants that were growing wild and the ceiling onning was about to collapse with the stands about to snap.  Thankfully, he got out of there in time for the small roof to collapse and nearly crushed him.<br />
<br />
By the time he got out, he took a breather and was glad that he got out of there.  He could hear barking near him and looked up to see he’s in the backyard.  But like the inside, something strange in infecting the outside.  The playground equipment next to the pool started to break apart and was in pieces.  The pool itself was starting to get all dark and murky as the filtration system stopped working and the surface as fading and getting jagged.  There was a tree that was placed in the corner with a tire swing on the branch, but the rope snapped and the tire deflated.  The tree itself was growing, becoming more feral and looking to be something that was far from extinct as the birds and squirrels were running and flying away from it.<br />
<br />
Turning back around, Jeff could see his house getting dismantled as the outside tiles were breaking down and the bricks were deteriorating, causing the house to fall in on itself.  The roof tiles were sliding as the roof itself collapsed inwards.  Glass from the windows shattered more and the inside of the house caved in further.  Thankfully, no one was in there as the family was out doing their own thing.  But that didn’t matter, as they have no home to go to anymore.<br />
<br />
As he was looking to his destroyed home, the velociraptor could hear the sound of the dog barking, but it was in pain.  Cranking his head, he could see his dog, which was a golden Labrador, tied in and leash next to the doghouse that was breaking apart with the wood rotting.  But looking on, he also noticed that something strange is happening to it.  All the fur on his body was shedding completely, leaving him completely naked.  Then his body started to grow and taking shaped with his bones cracking and adjusting.  His front paws shifted as three of his digits extended and one shrunk to nothingness, as the claws grew sharp and curved.  As the same time, his back paws shifted, as three of the claws grew sharp as one of them gained an extremely curvy claw and clicked the ground in pain.  The tail of the tail grew long and meaty as it flumped to the ground and moved around with sheer agony.  The dogs’ head soon took a drastic change as skull shifted aggressively.  His floppy ears shrank into his skull, leaving nothing but tiny holes.  The dog’s muzzle extended further as the wet nose has gotten dryer and the black color faded to match his bare skin.  He opened his mother as he panted and groaned.  His doggy groans soon devolved into reptilian grunts.  While his moth his opened, his long tongue shrank upwards until it fits perfectly in his mouth.  His canine teeth grew longer and sharper as new teeth grew out of his extending gums.  His dog like eyes blinked a little before the membranes shifted and his pupil went from a circle to a diamond slit with the border around it went all yellow.  The dog’s skin started to dry up and grew all scaly with a pattern yellow belly and a brown color along the rest of his shifting body.  The only thing left canine like is the dog’s seethe as it soon at attention.  But that too was changing into a reptilian one as it too exploded in climax and a paunch appeared and to let it and the extending balls shriveling up inside to merge with the skin.  As his posture finished shifting, Jeff’s dog turned into the exact copy as a raptor Jeff has become.  The different is that this raptor has dark brown scaly skin while Jeff’s is more beige green.<br />
<br />
The brown raptor grunted as collar detached from his grown neck and dropped to the floor, breaking apart in the process.  Recovering, he turned his head and saw the beige green raptor starring right at him.  Both of them looked at each other as the backyard and house deteriorate around them while prehistoric plant life and grass grew out.  Jeff looked to his former dog and didn’t know how to react.  He wanted to thank him from escaping his crumpling home, but he no longer has the vocabulary to do so.  So on instinct, he nudged the velociraptor’s side as a means of thanking him.  The brown raptor responded with a nudge on the beige green one’s side as well and immediately formed a bond between the two.  The two soon started to play around as the rolled each other to the ground and swipe their claws, chomping their jaws and grunting in glee.  But as they were playing, the world around them was being altered.<br />
<br />
The house Jeff was once in collapses on itself as brick and morter gave way.  What’s left of the rubble has moss growing out as weeds started to stick out.  Those said weeds grew into plants and trees that were to be extinct covered what remained of Jeff’s house, like it wasn’t there.  The pool grew and extended as algae made the clear water dark and murky as the remains of the playground dropped in, disappearing into the water.  The two raptors stopped playing and instinctively jumped into what is now a backyard size swamp, swimming in it without a care in the world.  The tree itself grew more feral and tropical, joining the other trees and plants that grew where the house once stood.  The wooden fence around the now huge swamp started to rot away and broke apart, with some dropping to the floor, absorbing into the growing wild grass.  It is where the houses around the spot Jeff’s house was stood with some people going about their daily lives, completely dubious of a prehistoric forest with two raptors swimming in a dirty swamp.  But that’s when something strange was happening.<br />
<br />
The houses around the growing forest soon started to break down slowly as windows were cracking and breaking and bricks cracking and aging.  The houses soon begin to crumble and collapse inside with the roofs collapsing inwards.  And if anyone was in any of those houses, they would either escape or crushed to death.  The street in front of Jeff’s former house was also affected as the concrete and asphalt gained multiple cracks and seeps of grass and weeds grew in, slowly growing into tropical and pre-extinct plants and trees.  The cars parked or being driven were also affected as engines stalled and burst into flames, tires deflating, body work rusting, windows shattering, and interiors breaking apart.  Moss and Mildew grew on the surface of the rusty body work and torn interior before exotic plants and flowers burst in and outside the car, covering them up and burying them completely, with a huge Venus Fly trap growing out of the sunroof of one and slowly opening and closing it’s jaws.  But the scenery wasn’t the only things that was changing.<br />
<br />
All around the growing prehistoric jungle, the people who were outside or escaped their toppling houses start to change, becoming random dinosaurs of various shapes and sizes, carnivores and herbivores alike, ripping out of their deteriorating clothes and loosing all forms of humanity that they have.  Yet they aren’t panicking as they were acting like none of this was happening, only then that their minds go the way of human thought, intellect, and memories and replace with the instinctive nature of the dinos they have become.  But not just the humans, as all over mammals were changing as well.<br />
<br />
The ones were the birds of various types as the flew away from the growing jungle.  They change when their bodies grew and expand double, if not triple, they size.  Feathers molting as their skin get cold and scaly, thin membranes grew on their wings and they flapped in longer strides.  And their skulls shifted with their beaks growing longer and the back of their heads grew into a long pointy ends.  All the birds, no matter what species they are, have become flocks of pterodactyls as the few around the growing new lands, sometimes, leaving it and flying in the skies.  Those that were on the ground, like dogs, cats, squirrels and rodents, grew and shifted to become smaller or average size dinos, like Jeff’s once dog, now Velociraptor mate.  Even the littlest of animals went from scampering and hopping as they changed shape into smaller raptors, or compsognathus, little dinos that feed on those that are injured, big and small.<br />
<br />
In moments, a circle of houses, cars, streets, and people around Jeff’s former homes became and extension of  a jungle like forest dating back to the Jurassic period.  But it didn’t stop there as the circle grew, taking out more human life and replacing it with prehistoric life without a rhyme or reason as to why.  But there is a reason.  See when Jeff the Raptor destroyed the computer, and error was made before it was entirely turned off.  That error has become a Prehistoric Wave.  This wave that started in one spot, spreads all around the world until the planet is filled with a Jurassic environment.  Buildings and anything man made will deteriorate and topple, replacing it with plants and tress that were once extinct.  Geographical landscapes will shift when continents either break apart of join together, terrains alter, and mountains become active volcanoes.  And humans and mammals of all sizes, they were be turn into random dinosaurs physically and mentally without anyone being aware of it, wiping out all warm blooded creatures and replacing them with cold blooded creatures.  Judging by the growth and speed of the wave, it would take no more then a few months and half a year.  So now the wave continues to spread further and further, affecting the world and the people around it.  Who would be the victim(s) that will affected by this prehistoric wave?</p>
