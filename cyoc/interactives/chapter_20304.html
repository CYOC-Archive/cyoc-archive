<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff woke up disorientated. He looked around confused by his strange surroundings, but he realised as he pushed his sisters long hair out of his eyes where he was. He sat up pulled the big t-shirt he was using as a nighty down and looked at the clock on the bed side cabinet. It was just passed 12pm and he had slept all morning. <br />
<br />
He pushed the bed covers off him and walked into the bathroom, his makeup had smudged off his face, and he decided to have a shower now than wait till he got home. <br />
<br />
he locked the bathroom door and pulled the t-shirt rick had lent him off, he stood int he shower. Hed had a restless night, his dreams haunted abotu beign pregnant, and beign stuck with his sisters body, but then the otherhalf of his sleep had been full of ricks hands feelign him and undressing him. He shuddered at the thoguht of having a guys dick inside of him, and thoguht to himself thta last night was the beer they drank messign with his head.<br />
<br />
He stepped out of the shower and dired himself, or at least tried to, once again his long hair seemed to be takign forever. He wrapped a towell around his chest, and padded into the bedroom and picked up his clothes. <br />
<br />
During the evebning these were perfect clothes, but inthe light of the morning, or in this case the afternoon, he realised how slutty he was goign to look beign dropped off at his house wearign a short dress like this. At least he still had the jumper rick had let him wear to cover up his cleavage<br />
<br />
He got changed quickly, and carrie dhis heels in one hand, and the t-shirt he used as a nighty in the other. He managed to find his way downstairs and followed the noise of the television set, he was hoping to walk in on rick, but as he entered the door he was greeted by ricks whole family, staring up at him was rick, his mom and dad and ricks sister. <br />
<br />
Jeff inwardly groaned but smiled as they all welcomed him and beckoned himt o sit down. &quot;Well well sleepign beauty finally wakes up&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;shut up dad&quot; rick was going red, and jeff remembered to cross his legs and pull his dress down as he smiled goign bright red himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I dont usually sleep so much...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem my dear, woudl you liek some breakfast?&quot; Rick's mom had stood up and was headign to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks, I really need to get back home if that sok with you rick, I have to meet my sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your sister? I thoguht you only had a brother?&quot; Rick looked puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry yeah, my brother, i just... its early.&quot; He faked a laugh, and the rest of them laugfhed too. <br />
<br />
&quot;It isnt early, its late int he day, and you cant leave the house lookign liek that lucy, what will the neighbours say. Jen, go upstairs with lucy why rick get sready to take lucy home and find her some clothes&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen who was smiling at him got up and dragged him out of his chair. &quot;Leave your purse and heels here lucy, no one will take it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick was smilign as he walked itnot he kitchen following his mother, and Jeff padded back upstairs, and got a face full of jen's ass as they walked. Ricks sister was hot, and if not mistaken same age as he was. Well, his real body was. Mesmerised by her as she spoke to him, he found him secretly tryign to check her out when she wasnt looking. Eventually they came to her room at the end of the, and entered into a girly room, with a similair look to his siters room.<br />
<br />
She seemed to look through her wardrobe for a while and eventually she handed him soem clothing &quot;... is that ok lucy&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;huh what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The skirt lucy, I said your a little taller than me, so You will have to wear one of my skirts. wow my brother really has got you daydreamign hasnt he&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry, im... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem lusy, you can use my bathroom to get changed in.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then realised he was staring at her, and that he was about to put on one of her skirts. He looked down at the bundle of clothes in his hands and brought himself back to reality. He followed to where she was indicating and sheepishly walked into the bathroom and locked the door. He placed the bundle of clothes ont he floor and sat down ont he edge of the bath.<br />
<br />
Wow he thougght, she is stunning. He looked down at himself and pulled the jumper off. His sisters large boobs looked back at him as he looekd down again. This isnt good, im a girl in another girls bathroom, and i think she is stunning. I need to get change dget home and get to beig a guy again.<br />
<br />
He stood up and stepped out of his dress. He lifted up the skirt and stepped into it, it was a little tight ove rhis hips and bum as he pulle dit up, and it was shorter than he woudl have liked it to be, but at least it wasn't a slutty dress. <br />
<br />
The top was weird. He pulled it over his head, and it fit tightly across his buxom. I covered his chest thoguh, and it had a zip across from his right shoulder which could be opened to show cleavage. it stopped short of his belly button, and the whole outfit showed a lot of skin. He checked himself out in the mirror, fixing his boobs and skirt and realised he looke dgood, depressingly so. He stepped out of the bathroom and lucy was stood with a hair dryer and beckoned him to sit down. This was goign to be a long afternoon.</p>
