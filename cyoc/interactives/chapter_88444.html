<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You jerk awake in bed, bleary eyed and confued. What a weird ream! However, when you throw back the covers, you discover that the prenant female body is very real. There is pounding on the door and you look at the clock. 10:30! You were supposed to meet your buddy Dan this morning for coffee over two hours ago.<br />
<br />
You hear him shouting. &quot;Hey! You OK? Open the door!&quot;<br />
<br />
How are you going to explain this? You wrap wourself up in one fo the bed sheets and stumble to the door, having trouble walking with your huge belly. &quot;I&#39;m coming! Sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
When you open the door, Dan blinks and stares at you. He then begins talking in his usual mile-a-minute manner, &quot;What the Hell? You sure slept in late! Did you forget about the game? I tried calling you, but your cellphone wouldn&#39;t go through, and I have been banging on the door for almost an hour now--I was worried and about to call the police! What&#39;s with the sheet, you sick or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Holding the sheet tighter around your swollen female body, you sigh and shake your head, and finally are able to say &quot;Dan, I had something... really weird happen last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of weird?&quot; he asks as he comes in and you shut the door behind him. <br />
<br />
You lean back against the closed door for support and warn him, &quot;This is gonna come as a shock.&quot; You then drop the sheet and let him see your five months pregnant female body. He stumbles back, mouth open. As he does so, you feel your stomach churn, and the room begins to feel rather warm, and you close our eyes from the discomfort, the embarrassment, and the fear you feel in being in this state.<br />
<br />
You hear him exclaim, &quot;Holy shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod and open your eyes, though you still can&#39;t quite meet his as you say, &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t know how it happened, but I was in this costume shop...&quot; You stop, feeling very strange once again. Your gut churns, and you feel warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell kind of costume...&quot; Dan takes a a step closer, no doubt curious. &quot;I mean, you look like a pregnant woman!&quot; His voice cracks oddly, and you do a double take when you look up. Instead of being 28, with his strong wide shoulders filling out his t-shirt Dan looks like he is a teenager! His once tight shirt and pants hang loosely on him, as though he were wearing his older brother&#39;s clothes. Dan doesn&#39;t seem to notice the change, but it is obvious to you. You feel your gut churn again, and more heat.<br />
<br />
Dan shrinks down at least two years, now maybe 15 at the most. You had forgotten how much of a beanpole Dan had been at that age. His jeans fall to his ankles and his shirt almost but not quite covers his drooping underwear. Still he doesn&#39;t seem to notice anything wrong as he says, &quot;Oh that is so weird! We seen pictures of pregnant women in school, but it different up close!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;School?! We&#39;ve both been out of school for ten years!&quot; you exclaim--though you can see that that isn&#39;t necessarily true for Dan anymore. Dan has an odd look to him as he comes increasingly closer to you. His eyes are locked onto your slightly larger belly as though he were fascinated by the very idea of it and very little else mattered. You gasp as the odd pulling in your belly gets stronger--expanding even bigger--and see Dan dwindle to a 12 year-old. He has completely left puberty behind as the underwear falls off his shrinking frame to the floor and his small feet step out of his shoes and socks. As he walks his increasingly larger shirt is pulled up high enough to flash you a passing glimpse of Dan&#39;s shrinking penis and balls as they settled into a certain hairless prepubescent state.<br />
<br />
He blinks, staring up at you in awe. &quot;Uh, is it OK for me to be seeing you naked? I mean, I never saw a lady naked before!&quot; He keeps coming closer, reaching out to touch your swollen belly. As his fingers press lightly against your skin, he shrinks again, this time becoming 8 years old. His shirt becomes more of a dress, reaching down past his knees as he undergoes a shrinking spurt. His features shrink and condense, gaining a little roundness from what had previously been stretched out. Immediately you feel an overwhelming desire to protect and nurture him--Dan, no Danny. Your Danny.<br />
<br />
He asks, &quot;Is there really a baby in there?&quot; Danny looks up at you with bright, curious eyes, just as if he were really a little kid. A much younger kid. He shrinks to a 5 years old, baby fat overtaking him, his neck hole exposing a shoulder as the rest of the shirt begins to drag on the ground as your belly swells out even more to look a full nine months pregnant you guess. Then he sits suddenly as he drops another year, and another... forever becoming runder, cuter, weaker, as your love for Danny grows.<br />
<br />
Your knees go weak and you sit suddenly next to your toddler Danny. This opens up your legs before him and suddenly he crawls to you and looks up, grinning and laughing happily. But it is the smile of an infant now, with whispy hair and skin that looks so soft. He crawls out of his shirt and then touches your slick wet vagina. The moment he does a wave of pain and pleasure simultaneously courses through your body. Suddenly you feel something start to slither its way out of your body, and you look down to see a fleshy chord--the umbilical chord--snake its way out of your vagina and connect itself to the infant Danny. As soon as it does he shrinks for one more time down to tiny size of a hairless, red, newborn--hardly able to breathe for himself, let alone move. It&#39;s then that you begin to feel your umbilical chord pull taught as it begins to pull Danny into your slick, swollen vagina. There is at once so much pain and yet so much pleasure in the experience you feel like you&#39;re likely to pass out. You know that childbirth is supposed to make you feel like you&#39;re being ripped apart, but this sensation feels as though you are being put back together. You shudder and gasp as a final sucking sensation draws your former best friend--now your son--into your womb.<br />
<br />
You then lay there panting for a few moments, exhausted from the experience. The churning sensations in your stomach though do not end as you notice your nine month belly slowly begin to shrink--at first the process scares you, as you panic thinking your child might soon shrink away into non-existence. But when it settles back at the five month size you had been when you woke up this morning to Danny&#39;s knocking, you stop panicking as you feel your gut settle. Then with some difficulty you stand and walk over to your floor length mirror. You take a good look at your slightly protruding belly and marvel. Unlike when you had woken up this morning and just felt your belly as large but empty, there&#39;s a certain feeling that overwhelms you now as you rub and admire your pregnant stomach and swollen breasts. You really are pregnant now - with Danny.</p>
