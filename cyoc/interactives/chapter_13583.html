<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason turned the corner and then pedaled at top speed to make it up the hill, before stopping before a familiar house, located on Orange Avenue. The garage door was open, and a blond teenager was tinkering with the night light on his bicycle.<br />
<br />
“I wish for the light to attach itself to the bar which runs between the two handle bars…” the familiar, teen wished out loud. Instantly, the light began to obey some form of magic, which came from Ty. It fastened itself to the bar, without Ty even touching it! Ty just looked on and smiled, enjoying the fact that he could use his power to fix things without ever touching them with his hands.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Ty! Check out my new bike…” Jason shouted, as he swung his right leg over the seat of the bike. He then walked the bike up the driveway into the garage, which had the door rolled up all the way.<br />
<br />
“Hey, your bike looks sweet! When did you get it?” Ty asked his friend from school.<br />
<br />
“I gathered all the money from my birthday, and I went to the sporting goods store, where I bought it just last week. What do you think?” Jason chuckled, as he looked at the bike with great pride.<br />
<br />
“It looks awesome! We should go ride more often! You owe me a ride on your bike! Don’t forget!” Ty warned him.<br />
<br />
“No problem, Ty…” Jason chuckled. “Is Dustin home yet? I need to see if he wants to take me to his gym tonight…”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, he’s inside talking to Peter…”<br />
<br />
Jason ran towards the door, which he opened in a hurry, before he ran in the house. Just as he ran in, he almost bumped into Peter, who was about to walk out.<br />
<br />
Ty noticed that something fell out of his back pocket of his shorts, and he walked over to pick it up. It appeared to be some sort of game card.<br />
<br />
 “Hey, Jason! Take it easy, dude! You almost knocked me over…” Peter shouted at the teen.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Jason…” Ty said, as he examined the card in his hand. “You dropped your…”<br />
<br />
“Forget it… He’s already in the house!” Peter chuckled, as he walked over to Ty. “Whatcha got?”<br />
<br />
“It’s some sort of game card for Yu-Gi-Oh!” Ty replied, as he turned the card over, before turning it back so he could show his cousin the drawing of the colorful figure, which was on the face of the card.<br />
<br />
“ChaosRider Gustaph?” Peter said out loud, as he read the name on top of the card. The card had a color drawing of a figure who was sitting on a very cool-looking motorcycle. <br />
<br />
The motorcycle looked like it was the fastest thing on the road, and the figure also looked impressive. Gustaph was a big, muscular character who wore several chains across his chest, a hood over his head, and a large sword in his right hand. He had red straps across his arms and legs, and he closely resembled some sort of warrior or fighter.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, the side door to the kitchen, which led to the garage, opened wide, and Jason came running through the door.<br />
<br />
“Hey guys…” Jason said to Ty and Peter, as he walked up to them. <br />
<br />
“Hey, this fell out of your pocket…” Ty pointed out to him.<br />
<br />
“That’s one of my favorite cards! I love that card! That Gustaph is one cool-looking dude, holding the big sword, while riding on his awesome motorcycle! What do you think of it?” Jason wondered, as he looked on at the two teenage transformation wizards.<br />
<br />
Peter and Ty just looked at each other for a few seconds, before looking back at the card, and then glancing at the new bicycle, which was standing in the garage before them.<br />
<br />
“Uh, oh… I know that look…” Jason said out loud. “I know about the two of you… Both you guys have the ability to change things…”<br />
<br />
“You got that right!” Peter replied. “I want you to go stand next to your bike, Jason!”<br />
<br />
“Hey! What… What’s going on here?” Jason stuttered, as his body immediately began to obey Peter’s power.<br />
<br />
“We’re just curious to see what Gustaph would look like in real life, Jason!” Ty chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, and since you like these cards so much, I guess you’ll be a good candidate to be transformed into Gustaph!” Peter added on to Ty’s comments.<br />
<br />
“Hey… Whoa! No fair! Both of you have powers… Arghh… I can’t resist!” Jason gasped, as he felt power from Ty and Peter taking over his body, forcing him to stand next to his bike, but not allowing him to move his legs or walk anywhere else.<br />
<br />
“Let me look at the card, Peter!” Ty said to his cousin, who was holding the card of ChaosRider Gustaph in his right hand. “I’ll change his bike, if you change Jason into Gustaph!”<br />
<br />
“Hey… What? What are you doing to me?” Jason wondered, as he felt a tingling sensation spread through his entire body. “What’s going on?”<br />
<br />
Jason looked over at his bike, and realized that it was changing as well! He gasped when he saw the bike suddenly growing taller and longer, and the tires were inflating!<br />
<br />
“What are you two doing?” he shouted at Ty and Peter.<br />
<br />
“Be quiet, Jason!” Ty ordered. “Just relax and enjoy the transformation. And don’t worry, you’ll love it!”<br />
<br />
Peter’s power started to allow Jason’s body to grow several inches taller in just three seconds! Jason grew from 6 foot and 1 inch to 6 foot and 9 inches tall!<br />
<br />
Next, Jason’s muscles began to grow at an amazing rate! His calves inflated to the size of softballs, while his quads turned into tree trunks which were covered with slabs of rock solid muscle and veins. Then his abdominals popped out of his flat stomach, forming a tiled surface which resembled a cobblestone road! His pectorals, delts, and his lats were the next muscles to grow, inflating his chest and widening his shoulders so he now began to resemble a young bodybuilder! And finally, his arms grew thicker, as his triceps and biceps inflated into hard, round balls of muscle that felt like steel.<br />
<br />
Jason’s feet widened by an inch or two, while sharp claws formed at the bottom of his toes. His clothing suddenly disappeared, and he felt red, leather straps and a red pair of shorts replacing the t-shirt and the jeans that he was wearing previously. <br />
<br />
Red, leather straps appeared around his legs, just above the ankles up to his knees. Straps also appeared around his biceps and his wrists, while a round, metal ring appeared out of nowhere, floating right over his pectorals in the center.<br />
<br />
As his skin turned dark green, more leather straps appeared which ran from under his arms to the ring over his pectorals, as well as over his shoulders and around his neck.<br />
<br />
The metal circle was now held in place by six straps, and shoulder pads started forming over his shoulders. They each had five sharp points of spikes that were fastened to the shoulder pads, as a red and green colored mask was forming over his head. A spear appeared in his right hand, with a long blade which resembled a sword, which appeared at the end of the spear. Another yellow blade formed at the opposite end of the spear as well, while yellow, sharp horned had formed over the mask, which covered Jason’s head.<br />
<br />
Jason was absolutely astonished when he looked down at himself, while Peter just grinned at his handiwork. Peter wished for a large mirror to appear on the garage wall, and he pointed at the mirror so Jason could see his reflection in it.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ty worked on the bike, transforming it into the large, gold-plated motorcycle, just as the one that was illustrated on the game card. <br />
<br />
The engine, muffler, and seat were enlarged and turned to gold, as well as the handle bars and the fender. The fender and front light of the motorcycle turned into a red likeness of a snake, with bright, yellow eyes as its lights. Incredible stylish red and gold colored handlebars appeared as well, making the bike look fast, dangerous, and mysterious. The bike now matched the mysterious rider, and the sight of the road warrior machine would be one which demanded awe and respect from anyone who would cross paths with Gustaph the ChaosRider!<br />
<br />
“Oh my God! You guys turned me into Gustaph!” Jason exclaimed, with his mouth dropping wide open, as he first saw his reflection, and then noticed the transformation of his mountain bicycle into the meanest motorcycle ever seen on the street!<br />
<br />
“Take your new motorcycle for a spin, Gustaph!” Peter chuckled, as Gustaph carefully mounted the motorcycle and grabbed hold of both handlebars. He pressed a button with his finger, allowing the motorcycle to come to life with a loud roar! He then pushed the parking stand back, gently pressing the accelerator on the handlebar, which allowed the motor bike to move forward. <br />
<br />
Gustaph then placed his feet on the small feet rests on the sides of the motorcycle, as he dashed off on the street. He quickly rode to the end of the street, when he turned left and then drove around the block. The motorcycle was so loud, that Ty and Peter could easily hear where he was riding. They noticed right away that he was making another turn, allowing him to come around and turn back into the street where Ty’s house was located.<br />
<br />
“That was awesome!” Gustaph cheered, as he pulled into Ty’s driveway, where Peter and Ty were standing. “You guys need to join me, so we can go ride around town!”<br />
<br />
“I want to look like you, but in different colors!” Ty shouted. Immediately Ty started to grow taller and more muscular as well. But his skin turned black, instead of dark green. And he had blue straps of leather around his wrists, biceps, and legs, rather than the red ones that Gustaph had. He also grew the claws, the shoulder pads, the sharp points on the pads, and the straps around his neck. A ring was also held in place by six blue straps, while a blue mask covered his head, with yellow horns sticking out on top.<br />
<br />
Ty then directed his power at his bicycle, and he transformed it to be identical to Gustaph’s motorcycle, but his motorcycle was blue instead of red, like the one Gustaph had. <br />
<br />
“Come on, Peter! What are you waiting for?” Ty said to his cousin, who was still pondering what he wanted himself to look like.<br />
<br />
“I wanna look different from you guys, although I definitely want to transform my old bicycle. Hmm… I need an idea for a costume…” Peter said to himself, as he though it over. He then walked over to an old bookcase and pulled a copy of the Spider-Man comic book, which Ty had saved. <br />
<br />
“I wanna look like this guy, but without the face with the weird teeth!” he said, while pointing at a drawing of the Venom character.<br />
<br />
Peter started to grow from 6 foot 3 inches to 6 foot 9 inches tall, just like Gustaph! Then his skin turned dark blue, while light blue colored veins covered his arms and legs and basically the rest of his body!<br />
<br />
He had an illustration of a white spider on his muscular chest, and his head was now also covered by a hood, and a mask covered his face.<br />
<br />
Next, Peter turned to his old bike and allowed it to transform into a motorcycle that was identical to the one that Ty was riding, but his was yellow instead of red. Both Ty and Peter also had spears and swords, and the trio was now able to ride through the streets of town together!<br />
<br />
“Lead the way, Gustaph!” Ty shouted at the big, masked man. “You’re our leader!”<br />
<br />
Gustaph lead the way on his red motorcycle, with Ty his blue motorcycle, and Peter on his yellow one. Gustaph was dressed in green with red straps, Ty in black with blue straps, and Peter was all blue, dressed like Venom, but without the mouth and the teeth that Venom has.<br />
<br />
The threesome drove around town, with Gustaph (Jason) in front, followed by Ty and with Peter in the back. They toured the town, going through the neighborhoods, before they were right down the street from a small convenience store.<br />
<br />
“Guys! Let’s stop over there for a drink! I’m getting thirsty!” Gustaph shouted at Ty and Peter.<br />
<br />
Just as the trio pulled up and parked their motorcycles near the entrance of the store, two masked men came running out the store. One of them actually had a plastic bag in his hand!<br />
<br />
“CALL THE POLICE! I’ve just been robbed by those two guys over there!” the clerk in the store shouted at Gustaph and Ty.<br />
<br />
“Go after them!” Peter said to them. “I’ll stay with the clerk!”<br />
<br />
Ty and Gustaph immediately mounted their motorcycles, and chased after the two masked men.<br />
<br />
Ty and Gustaph caught up to the two robbers in no time at all, since their motorcycles were much faster than theirs!<br />
<br />
When Gustaph quickly pulled over besides one of the masked robbers, he reached out with his sword, and poked the point of his razor sharp blade into the front tire of the robber’s motorcycle, causing it to burst! Immediately, the robber’s bike had a flat, which slowed him down considerably. He then ran the motorcycle off the road and into a row of bushes, before he leaped off and started to run.<br />
<br />
But Gustaph came right after him, and he immediately caught up to him! Gustaph grabbed the robber from behind, grabbing hold of his belt that was around his waist. He then hurled the robber to the ground with incredible force. When the robber tried to get up and run away, Gustaph then pointed his sharp sword at his neck.<br />
<br />
“Walk back to the store, nice and slow! If you try anything, then I will throw this thing at you… And it will hurt!” Gustaph warned the robber.<br />
<br />
They quickly walked back to the store.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Ty was chasing the robber with the plastic bag. When Ty pulled right besides the robber, he shouted something to him.<br />
<br />
“FREEZE!” Ty shouted, instantly stopping the robber and freezing his motorcycle. Ty then calmly climbed from his own motorcycle, and turned off the other motorcycle.<br />
<br />
“Now, give me the bag…” Ty ordered the man, while he gently took the plastic bag out of the robber’s hand.<br />
<br />
“Ahhh… What have we got in here?” Ty wondered, looking in the bag. “We got some money! Unfortunately, it’s NOT yours!” <br />
<br />
Ty mounted his motorcycle, riding back to the store, while the robber was still sitting motionless on his bike. Then Ty wished for them to be in front of the store which had just been robbed. Within a second, Ty and the second robber appeared, just as Gustaph was arriving with his captive.<br />
<br />
“Good job, Gustaph! We caught both of them!” Ty chuckled, as he walked back in the store.<br />
<br />
Peter was talking to a police officer, when Ty walked in. <br />
<br />
“Here is the stolen cash!” Ty said, as he handed the clerk the bag with the stolen money.<br />
<br />
“Thank you so much!” the clerk said to Gustaph, Ty and Peter. “Who are you guys?”<br />
<br />
“We’re the ChaosRiders!” Gustaph responded, as he held his sword up high.<br />
<br />
Ty then unfroze the robber, who was hopelessly confused. He had no idea how he got back to the store. But the police took the two men in custody and took them out to the police car, so they could give them a ride to the police station.<br />
<br />
After the police left with the two robbers, Gustaph, Ty and Peter were sitting on their motorcycles, which were parked side by side in the parking lot.<br />
<br />
“Guys! That was awesome! We need to do this more often!” Gustaph suggested to the two teens. “I love doing these kinds of things. We can help out those in need, and we can chase the bad guys on or motorcycles!”<br />
<br />
“We can do this next week! Let’s go home, so we can change!” Ty suggested to the other two friends.<br />
<br />
The threesome then rode back to Ty’s house, where Peter and Ty changed Gustaph into Jason, and they changed themselves back into their normal clothes.<br />
<br />
“Look at these swords! They’re awesome!” Ty chuckled, as he looked at his sword.<br />
<br />
“So what do we call ourselves?” Peter asked Jason.<br />
<br />
“We’ll be the ChaosRiders!” Jason responded. “Gustaph and the ChaosRiders!”<br />
<br />
Ty, Peter and Jason each grabbed their sword, and raised them up high over their heads, allowing the tips of the swords to touch in one place.<br />
<br />
“We’re the ChaosRiders! Whoohoo!!” the three of them shouted at the same time. And that is how the team was born, in Ty’s garage.<br />
