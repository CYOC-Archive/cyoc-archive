<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ah, fuck, deeper!” RK moaned, purple eyes squeezed shut, the lithe and fluffy skunkmorph rolling his hips, ass planted on Troy&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Troy shoved his snout deep in RK’s fluffy asscheeks, gripping them and spreading them apart as far as he could. He buried his tongue in the skunk’s luscious ass, licking madly, tasting his savory insides. His other hand was in a fist around the skunk’s slender pink cock, pumping it, paw slicked with lube.<br />
<br />
RK put more weight on Troy’s face, writhing in pleasure. Troy wriggled free and shoved the big striped tail out of the way, gasping for air, huffing the skunk’s musk happily. God, RK made such a hot skunk! He switched paws, slicking up that smooth dick of RK’s properly and resumed pumping it again.<br />
<br />
“Harder!” RK wriggled.<br />
<br />
Troy thrust his tongue through the mephit&#39;s loosened ring and slapped his prostate, drilling it with his tongue. He sucked and milked the scent glands, enjoying the acrid taste on his tongue. RK moaned happily, his cock drooling warm precum that flowed over Troy’s fist.<br />
<br />
He’d need to use a lot of mouthwash after this. Or just use the Book and remove any scents from his mouth and the room. That was the only reason RK had agreed to this. Or so he claimed.<br />
<br />
“D-deeper!” RK ordered.<br />
<br />
Troy obliged, spreading that juicy ass apart and sticking his nose in the ring. His tongue laps came harder and faster, pumping the twink skunk’s dick faster. RK’s anus spasmed, trying to activate scent glands that Troy had sucked dry.<br />
<br />
“Ah-I’m gonna-” RK gasped.<br />
<br />
Troy smacked that prostate hard with his tongue, fist a blur.<br />
<br />
The skunk’s ass shuddered and tensed as he came, hips bucking and weight fully falling on Troy’s head. Ropes of jizz erupted from RK&#39;s cock and splattered across Troy’s belly and trickled through his fur, staining the bed with RK’s juices. Finally, the mephit sagged and went still.<br />
<br />
Troy lifted the skunk off his muzzle, taking a big breath of musky air. His tongue lapped around his face, savoring the flavor. He held the skunk close to him and wrapped an arm around him. <br />
<br />
RK began to snuggle back and then stopped and abruptly tried to squirm out of Troy&#39;s hug.<br />
<br />
“What the hell are you doing?” RK snapped.<br />
<br />
“Cuddling, duh.” Troy snuggled closer, enjoying the mephit’s soft fur, licking his ear.<br />
<br />
RK shoved him off and stood up. “Fag.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup.&quot; Troy rolled his eyes and gestured at his thick throbbing bone. “Not going to help a bro out?”<br />
<br />
“Just jerk yourself off, dumbass.” RK huffed. “Turn me back.”<br />
<br />
Troy sighed and pointed. “Half.”<br />
<br />
RK’s fluffy figure became less so as his fur receded. His long tail retracted, legs snapping back to human configuration. Eventually, the rather twinkish form of RK stood at the end of Troy’s bed. He gathered his clothes and went to the door. <br />
<br />
He paused and turned. <br />
<br />
“Tell anyone about this and I’ll kill you.” RK glared and went to the bathroom to freshen up.<br />
<br />
Troy shrugged and went back to sleep.<br />
<br />
The sound of construction equipment woke Troy up an hour later. He sighed, rolled out of bed, belly wobbling. He yawned, scratched his ass, and lit a doobie. Rusty didn’t like it when he smoked in the house, but Troy could just use the Book. That’s how he cleaned now.<br />
<br />
And that’s just what Troy did, lazily removing all the smells in the room, cleaning the stains from the bed. He stared at himself in the mirror, eyes glazed and red, and cleaned up his fur and all the smells in his mouth, cleaning his teeth at the same time. Man, he was so glad he went to college in this reality. Now he knew chemistry and shit.<br />
<br />
Troy giggled and went outside to ogle the construction workers. They’d been at it all day and he could smell their sun-baked sweat and musk from his lawnchair. He took a deep breath and sighed happily. He couldn’t believe he’d won.<br />
<br />
Sure, he’d cost the city a million dollars in damages when all was said and done, but really, who could put a cost on all the lives he’d saved?<br />
<br />
Apparently the city could, because he’d basically had to use the Book these last few days to pay people off to keep quiet about what they’d seen. Clint had watched the whole thing go down, start to finish. Including the Book.<br />
<br />
That cost him a million in funny money-to-USD to pay him off. Troy was pretty sure printing money himself was illegal but he could warp reality so they’d just have to find a way to live with it. Fuckers wasted his tax dollars anyways.<br />
<br />
Clint had also demanded he leave. That was the other stipulation. When Troy asked him if he was sure he wasn’t actually a slug, Clint had snorted and rolled his eyes, calling Troy’s bluff. If it had been anyone else…<br />
<br />
Troy shook his head. He’d promised RK he wouldn’t do that. And then RK demanded to be turned into a skunk and had sat on his face. Troy just assumed that was his version of shaking hands.<br />
<br />
He enjoyed the wind on his fur and considered working out today. He’d promised he’d cut back on the weed and start dieting, but it was just like, the time wasn’t right. Not yet. He’d won his first battle. He deserved a vacation.<br />
<br />
Troy rubbed his furry chinstrap beard and wondered where he should go. He was basically a walking money printer now, he could go anywhere he wanted. He thought about  the strange dream he had last night. He pulled out his phone and started typing in some phrases.<br />
<br />
A man named Sebastian Cervantes popped up. He was a relatively handsome Latino man, rich, up-and-coming, now owner of a production and music studio. He was also a rapper and R&B artist. He even had a charity to revitalize his old neighborhood.<br />
<br />
Troy smiled. He knew exactly what he needed to do! The next few hours were busy. He used the Book, took massive rips from his bong, and made a few calls. He even made some trips to the Post office.<br />
<br />
By the time he was done, Rusty had come home. Troy cooked him dinner and they fucked on the couch and then RK had knocked on their door. Troy cleaned up with a few words from his Book and let him in.<br />
<br />
“What?” Rusty demanded.<br />
<br />
“Just here to apologise for my behaviour earlier.” RK said. “I’m not here to intrude, just working out an attack plan for the rest of the Books.”<br />
<br />
“Do you know what my day has been like?” Rusty demanded. “I’ve had to cover this whole business up! We had to scrape a dead elephant off the road from a Perrari that doesn’t have a VIN number and they ALL have those. Every one that rolls off the production line is marked. Then I had to explain how a crazed Rottweiler wielding a bull fuckdoll was not responsible for the destruction of the Presidential Suite at the Filton. And then I had to explain that the fuckdoll had gone missing.”<br />
<br />
“I know, I know.” RK held up a hand.<br />
<br />
“No, you don’t! Do you know how many people I had to fix? People who didn’t even remember themselves by the time we found them so we COULDN’T fix them? Not to mention that most of them preferred to be sex dolls, so congratulations Troy, we’re now in charge of a best-selling line of fuck toys.” Rusty snarled.<br />
<br />
“Righteous!” Troy giggled happily.<br />
<br />
“Those people are dead! Their families-”<br />
<br />
“Bro, chill. Reality shifted. They never had families.” Troy shrugged. “And from what I remember as a robot, they’re having a great time.”<br />
<br />
“It’s wrong, Troy.” Rusty snarled. &quot;Or are you so fucking stoned you don&#39;t get that?&quot;<br />
<br />
“It is what it is.” Troy snapped, standing and facing Rusty. “We weren’t the one who did that to them. HE did! You saved who you could, but it’s, like, you know, like a disaster and all you can do is dig the few survivors out of the rubble.”<br />
<br />
Rusty huffed and retrieved a beer from the fridge. He popped the lid and drained it. Then he got another one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Sam&#39;s body?&quot; RK asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Missing.&quot; Rusty chugged his beer and licked his chops. &quot;Found some weird reptilian tracks nearby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He turned into a lizard?&quot; Troy blinked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Myth.&quot; RK spat. &quot;Fucking Myth took him.&quot;<br />
<br />
They were silent for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought he was in California.&quot; Rusty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He can make minions.&quot; RK said. &quot;They&#39;re scouring the world for Books.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They found us, then.&quot; Rusty said sourly.<br />
<br />
RK nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever happened to Tex?&quot; Troy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He, uh, wanted you to help him out.&quot; Rusty avoided Troy&#39;s gaze. &quot;He...he wants to be a fuck bot. Fucking weirdo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See? We can help one person, at least.&quot; Troy stood and rubbed Rusty&#39;s furry back.<br />
<br />
“I don’t even know who Hank used to be.” Rusty put his head in his hands.<br />
<br />
“Hank appeared in this world the same day the Sheriff died in Texas.” RK supplied. “But it’s been a few days and reality has shifted. He’s gone.”<br />
<br />
Rusty threw his beer against the wall. “I couldn’t even save Troy! What the fuck good am I?”<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Rusty, you&#39;re why I won!&quot; Troy said. &quot;I literally would have died if you hadn&#39;t-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I lost myself!&quot; Rusty shouted, tears streaming down his furry face. &quot;Again! Fuck, I&#39;m so useless!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rusty stormed out of the house. Troy listened and heard his car started up and Rusty drove away. Troy stared out the window at their empty parking space, shaken. Their first fight. Or tantrum. <br />
<br />
Troy looked back at RK. They stared at eachother for a few uncomfortable seconds.<br />
<br />
“Stop looking at me like that, dumbass.” RK avoided his gaze.<br />
<br />
“Like what?” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
“Just…just stop.” RK stood and paced.<br />
<br />
“Is this about the skunk thing? I mean, we can go with wolverine if you feel better about it.” Troy smacked his lips. “Heard they’re pretty tasty too.”<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe you talked me into it.” RK shook his head. <br />
<br />
“But you were the one-”<br />
<br />
“Shut up.” RK sat down. “We need to talk about the next step. Arcane-”<br />
<br />
“I’m going to Hollywoo.” Troy said.<br />
<br />
RK stared at him. “What?”<br />
<br />
“I wanna become a movie star. So, like, listen, last night, I had a dream. I was an actor on set and I was supposed to walk into a room to talk to, like my little brother or my son-I dunno which, it was all kinda hazy so I just rolled with it, you know? Anyways, he had the music on too loud and I was supposed to go turn off the radio. But I kept mistiming it-the audio shuts off on its own so I’m supposed to be next to it when it happens.”<br />
<br />
“Troy.” RK pinched the bridge of his nose. “I don’t know what you’ve been smoking-”<br />
<br />
“Mauie Wauie and Pineapple Express.” Troy supplied.<br />
<br />
“Don’t interrupt!” RK snarled. “That is stupid.”<br />
<br />
“But all your plans are about going after Time or Arcane. I wanna take out Myth.” Troy shrugged.<br />
<br />
“You won’t make it to Myth because Time will stop you first.” RK said.<br />
<br />
“So…” Troy said slowly.<br />
<br />
“We wait for Arcane to take out Time.”<br />
<br />
“Nah man, that’s pussy shit.” Troy said. “Let’s-”<br />
<br />
“Time can take you out of the game by forcing a future on you.” RK replied.  “Or loop time so he always wins.”<br />
<br />
“So why isn’t he moving?” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
“I…” RK frowned. “I’m not sure.”<br />
<br />
“What if he’s looping the game itself, so you can’t see his future, bro.” Troy asked. “Like an Infinite Regressor.”<br />
<br />
“Do you have any idea how much energy it costs to maintain a loop on one person, let alone a whole world?”<br />
<br />
“What if he just looped you?” Troy asked. “And hopped into a timeline he wins? I mean, as far as I can see, your Book is unstoppable if you have Time. But Time doesn’t need to have your Book, he just needs to trap you once in one future and he wins.”<br />
<br />
RK stared at Troy, awestruck. “Are you stoned right now?”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded, “Fucking duh, man.”<br />
<br />
RK glanced out the window. &quot;He gonna be gone long?&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy checked his phone. &quot;He&#39;s going back to the station. Probably all night.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Skunk me!” RK demanded, adjusting the tent in his pants. &quot;Hurry up you stupid fucking stoner. My ass isn&#39;t going to eat itself.&quot; <br />
<br />
Troy grinned, doggy tongue lolling, and pointed. “Half.”</p>
