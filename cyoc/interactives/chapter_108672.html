<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After dealing with both his older brother Benton and his business editor, Lance Knight wanted nothing more than to take a break, but as Editor-In-Chief of <i>The Moon Lake Gazette</i>, let alone the head of Knight Media, knew that wasn&#39;t possible; despite the tempting thoughts of finding Lila Carpenter and the two of them playing hooky from the world until it was time for him to go to the werepanthers&#39; meeting that night.<br />
Instead, Lance requested Ella Alyn into his office.<br />
&quot;Close the door,&quot; he said, as the <i>Gazette&#39;s</i> star Town Hall and local were reporter entered.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up chief?&quot; asked Ella, as Lance motioned for her to have a seat.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the latest on the Julie Stovall situation?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;She has her arraignment hearing tomorrow. Do you know the back story on the matter?&quot; she asked.<br />
&quot;Not completely,&quot; he admitted.<br />
Then Ella began recounting the facts. &quot;Apparently Stovall had an interest in a fellow Freshman named Eric Anderson. There&#39;s scuttlebutt that interest may have been more wanting to collect another notch on her bedpost, especially since he was still a normal and a virgin at the time, instead of actual love, but I haven&#39;t been able to confirm that yet since all the parties involved are minors.&quot;<br />
&quot;Go on,&quot; said Lance.<br />
&quot;Eric caught Julie cheating on him somehow, and publicly broke it off with her, which caused Julie to get into trouble with her parents as well for breaking curfew or something, which eventually led to the guy she was cheating on Eric with to break up with her too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ouch,&quot; was Lance&#39;s only reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned was accurate in this case from what I hear, for Julie still wanted to turn Anderson into a were-merman, but he had already started dating a girl named Spencer Lawson.&quot;<br />
&quot;S-p-e-n-c-e-r or with 2 S&#39;s, like the Robert B. Parker character?&quot;<br />
&quot;C. From what I hear, her father is a decorated Navy SEAL and named her after a brother who was lost in military action. Anyway, Anderson and Lawson started dating in earnest, despite some family problems that came along*. But regardless how strongly the couple are supposed to feel about one another, she couldn&#39;t induct Eric into were society because she&#39;s a hybrid. Her father is a full werewolf while her mother is a werecat/werepanthress mix, so there was no guarantee what would have happened to Anderson if they...&quot;<br />
&quot;I get the idea, and with Julie Stovall circling like a shark waiting to strike, enter my niece Frieda,&quot; realized Lance.<br />
&quot;Yes. She formally inducted Eric, turning him into a full blooded werepanther in the process, while somehow the three of them have formed an... unique friendship, which has seriously grown since your niece is supposedly bi,&quot; said Ella.<br />
&quot;She is, and the three of them are madly in love with each other,&quot; confirmed Lance, &quot;but how does this lead to Stovall getting in trouble with the law.&quot;<br />
&quot;Again, I can&#39;t completely confirm this yet because everyone involved is a minor, but apparently Julie was tired of taking the &#39;subtle&#39; approach to turn Eric and was going to attempt a full frontal assault, although there are rumors that she already attempted that once but failed.**&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Lance in disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;A simple bite or scratch is just as effective as outright sex, although not as enjoyable. Remember?&quot; pointed out the reporter. &quot;Anyway, Julie was allegedly going to arrange an <i>accident</i> in the cafeteria during Freshman lunch, but freaked when she discovered that not only were Anderson and your niece sitting together, but that he already had a werepanther scent and tried to attack both of them on the spot!&quot;<br />
&quot;Frieda never said a word to me about any of this. Where was this Spencer Lawson at the time?&quot; asked Lance.<br />
&quot;Everyone involved but her are Freshmen. She&#39;s a Sophomore.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh. Go on.&quot;<br />
&quot;Julie was quickly restrained and hauled to the Principal&#39;s office until the Sheriff arrived to formally arrest her. Then, when he and a deputy were taking her away, Stovall is supposed to have made a death threat against Anderson to his parents&#39; faces!***,&quot; revealed Ella.<br />
&quot;Thus getting her into more hot water than she already was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly. Because of the alleged death threat, there&#39;s speculation that Jack Johnson, the prosecuting attorney, might move to have Stovall tried as an adult instead of a minor.&quot;<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t there some conflict of interest because he ran against Martin Stovall for Mayor in the last election?&quot; asked Lance.<br />
&quot;If there is, Brett Smithson, Stovall&#39;s defense lawyer, hasn&#39;t raised it yet,&quot; replied Ella. &quot;But Johnson lost after your brother pulled his support upon finding out Johnson is gay.&quot;<br />
&quot;Benton Knight, the gift that just keeps on giving,&quot; Lance said sarcastically.<br />
Then he thought about everything his reporter told him before speaking again. &quot;The reason I initially called you in is because there&#39;s a new possibility in the matter. I have it on good authority from a parent of one of the parties involved that Stovall has been sending out fake e-mails to the others as part of some phishing scam. If the allegation is accurate, whether to use any information as either an attempt at blackmail or to discredit the witness&#39; testimony is the unanswered question.&quot;<br />
&quot;Which is why your brother was here,&quot; assumed Ella, to which Lance only nodded his head.<br />
&quot;The Sheriff has been informed and will probably investigate soon. I want you to stay on top of the story, or stories as the case may be.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay chief. I was scheduled to start covering the court proceedings tomorrow anyway, but thanks for the heads up. And since your niece is involved, fair but neutral is the watchword,&quot; confirmed Ella.<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
&quot;By the way, I was wondering about something,&quot; said the reporter, &quot;Is it true about you and Lila Carpenter?&quot; she asked, to which Lance looked at her.<br />
Then Lance simply smiled. &quot;Can&#39;t keep any secrets around you, can I?&quot;<br />
&quot;Part of what makes me a good reporter, but congratulations. From what I hear, she&#39;s a good catch.&quot;<br />
&quot;Truthfully? I&#39;m the lucky one. Considering my family...&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. But everyone deserves their chance at happiness, and I hope you&#39;ve finally found yours,&quot; said Ella, sincerely.<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Lance, before they parted company.<br />
