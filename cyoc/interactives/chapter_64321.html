Option Title: Drink The Bottle Becoming A Werewolf

<br>There was a huge desire for Chad to do what he wanted to with Johnny, especially in his werewolf form, but Chad also had another 
thought. There was nothing saying that he couldn’t drink from the bottle and then have his way with Johnny. As Chad stood there, he smiled 
while looking between Johnny, the bottle and the coke can thick cock that bobbed there with each beat of his heart. A part of Chad always 
wondered what it would be like to be with another man, but he never did anything with one because he never felt a desire to do so… that was 
until now. The thing was, right now, Johnny was in his werewolf form, which was appealing, but Chad wanted to see the new human side of 
him. Chad remembered the average Johnny who didn’t have any body hair or muscles to speak of. This new Johnny, though, he was probably 
as big as their defensive lineman Mark, considering the huge muscles on his body at that moment. Now that kid had always been a bull of a 
guy, with huge, balloon like pectorals; his very thick torso and back, along with his basketballs for arms; where all of his front side had a thick, 
but trimmed coating of chestnut brown hair that accentuated his muscles. The thought of Mark made Chad’s cock jump and twitch slightly. It 
was strange to Chad, he had never thought about Mark in that way before, but now… Chad kind of wanted to get with Mark and Johnny! </br>

<br> “So Chad… what are you going to do?” Johnny asked with a sly grin on his face. </br>

<br> “Well… I want to do a couple of things. I want that cock of yours, but I am going to drink the werewolf bottle first…” Chad replied while 
trailing off. </br>

<br> “Ok, but it seems like there is something that you forgot to say or hesitated to.” Johnny said plainly. </br>

<br> “Yeah… well… I wanted to be sure that we could go back and forth from being in the form you are in now and human.” Chad said 
scratching the back of his head and continued. “I mean, being the beast that you are right now is cool and all, but I want to be able to live a 
normal life too, albeit being a werewolf is far from normal!” </br>

<br> “Yeah, I know… this is cool, but I have been wondering about being able to turn back like a real werewolf. This may be permanent, but I 
can surely try and see… especially if that means I can have a pack mate like you with me.” Johnny said with a bit of excitement in his voice and 
a sly wink. </br>

<br>Johnny had wanted to see if he could transform back ever since he drank the bottle. It said that it would make him a werewolf, not a 
permanent anthropomorphic wolf like he was currently. Thinking about how cool it would be to be able to transform back and forth at will was 
actually quite exciting, which had his fluffy tail wagging back and forth. Thinking about his human side, Johnny started to feel different and 
tingly all over. Johnny and Chad watched with rapt fascination as the fur started to draw back into his body, while his body shrank slightly with 
his hands and feet going back to being human. His teeth receded to a more human appearance, while his bicuspids were sharper than most 
peoples. His head and eyes returned to normal while his ears went back to their normal half ovalish shape, except for the point at the tip of his 
ears that was only noticeable if you really looked hard. When Johnny was done transforming to his smaller, human self, Chad almost drooled 
over himself. Instead of the average Johnny he knew, this new Johnny looked a lot like Mark did and Johnny’s body hair was slightly thicker 
than most guys on the arms, legs, chest, and abdomen. </br>

<br> “Fuck dude, that was super cool and you are fucking hot! I normally wouldn’t say that about any other guy until recently, but now… I just 
want you and Mark all to myself! Hell… I would love to have Mark here with us now!” Chad said almost rambling. </br>

<br> “Really, you like Mark like that? I mean, yeah… he is a fucking hot guy I always admired, but I didn’t think you even thought about him 
like that!” Johnny said, surprised that Chad was at least slightly gay now. </br>

<br> “Yeah… I guess my true feelings are coming out now. I never thought I was gay, but I guess something about seeing you like you were 
brought that out in me. To be honest, it feels kind of good!” Chad said cheerily. </br>

<br>Johnny chuckled while he wondered what Chad thought about him. “So Chad… what do you think of the new, human, me?” He finished 
with a sly grin. </br>

<br> “Man Johnny, you are just as impressive of a male specimen as Mark! In fact, your flaccid cock is just about as thick as Mark’s is. I 
remember seeing him in the shower just being flaccid, not chubby or anything and he was slightly thicker than you are right now!” Chad said 
while his face reddened slightly from realizing how much he had noticed Mark. </br>

<br> “Wow… that is pretty thick… I mean because I am sporting a chubby right now! I am not totally flaccid at the moment.” Johnny said 
plainly, looking down as he watched his cock continue to deflate slowly. </br>

<br> “Well… that’s ok, the rest of you is impressive, not to mention you are the first real werewolf I have ever heard about or seen for that 
matter! So, that has to count for something right?” Chad said with a sly grin, trying to comfort Johnny. </br>

<br> “It’s ok bud, you don’t have to try and make me feel better! Now… are you going to drink that bottle or not?” Johnny asked sounding 
slightly annoyed. </br>

<br> “Yeah, I am.” Chad said as he pulled the cork from the opening of the werewolf bottle. </br>

<br>Just as Chad was about to place the bottle to his lips and chug the contents in one gulp, Johnny grabbed the bottle from him to stop Chad 
from doing it at that moment. “Dude! What the hell? I thought you wanted me to drink this?” Chad exclaimed while he put the cork back into 
the bottle and sat it on the nearby table. </br>

<br> “Yeah, I do, but I want to see you naked first. That way we can have a before and after picture of at least what happens to our human 
forms first. People wouldn’t really believe us about the part where we turn into a real werewolf and as it is, people will doubt the changes to 
our normal bodies!” Johnny explained. </br>

<br> “Yeah… I guess you are right, I mean I wouldn’t have believed it about you if I didn’t see you the other day in the locker room at the gym 
in your underwear, being a scrawny thing just starting to build his physique!” Chad said, trying not to be too harsh or come across as an ass. 
</br>

<br> “Well… you know how it is when you start something new… hell, I am sure you were there at one point too!” Johnny said as Chad was 
taking off his shirt to reveal his modest musculature and trimmed chest hairs. </br>

<br>Johnny tried not to drool over Chad as he was undressing, but he had always had a crush on him since as far back as he could remember. 
Chad’s muscles were average, built, but also flat and more defined than bulky. His chest and abdomen were completely covered in his dark 
trimmed hairs, which got Johnny’s motor revving slightly because he had always thought that it was a hot look for men! As Chad took off his 
pants, standing there in his boxers, Johnny couldn’t help looking at the newly exposed skin. Chad’s thighs were pretty thick and muscular, 
covered in a light dusting of hair that got thicker below the knees and stopped right at his ankles. As Chad finished undressing, he remained in 
his boxers while having a sheepish look on his face. </br>

<br> “What’s up bud? I thought you wanted this?” Johnny said with a bit of confusion in his voice. </br>

<br> “Well… yeah I do, but I don’t need to be completely naked for a before and after body shot… do I?” Chad said, with a little bit of concern 
and apprehension in his voice. </br>

<br> “Well… no I suppose you don’t, but don’t you want guys to see a before and after of your meat too, because I know some guys would be 
sold on the body stuff alone, but I’m sure you know that there are guys who don’t care about improving their bodies while wanting a bigger 
cock.” Johnny said, trying to get Chad to loosen up a bit more, even though he was pretty loose as it was. </br>

<br> “Yeah, I know that, but I just want to share that with you… and Mark if the opportunity came. Most guys would be sold if their bodies 
went from seeing you as the little twerp you were before to looking like this in almost an instant.” Chad said, not able to look Johnny in the 
face as he admitted to wanting things to be special between them. </br>

<br>Johnny walked over to Chad, placing his meaty hand on his bare shoulder and gave him a mini massage, showing to Chad that what he 
said really mattered to Johnny. Wanting to get this part over with, Johnny stepped back and grabbed his cell phone out of his jean shorts that 
were nearby. Picking them up, Johnny chuckled to himself since he knew that the now too small clothes were not going to fit him and he would 
eventually have to figure something out when it was time to go home. With Chad… there was a possibility that his clothes may still fit him 
because he was slightly built already and Chad wore extra baggy clothes for the look and the comfort factor in it. Johnny positioned himself to 
take Chad’s before picture, trying to frame Chad in camera’s sight the best that he could. </br>

<br> “Alright Chad, smile for the camera!” Johnny said just as Chad grinned and he snapped the “before” photo. </br>

<br>After the photo was taken, Johnny and Chad walked toward each other so that Chad could see the photo. As he looked at it, then looked 
at Johnny, Chad just grinned because he knew that was definitely the “old” him and things would be different for both of them after he drank 
that bottle. </br>

<br> “Man… I can’t wait to see what happens to me after I drink this bottle! I mean, I am more built compared to you before. Now you look like 
you worked out hard every day for your entire life! I am getting a bit hard thinking about it!” He said as they both looked down to see Chad’s 
average sized cock sticking out of the boxer hole, checking out what was going on in the world at the moment. </br>

<br>Johnny and Chad both chuckled and then Johnny said with a sly grin, “Well… if you are ready to drink that bottle, you might as well take 
off those shorts of yours too. I mean, if you don’t, things might become very uncomfortable… not to mention, you will rip through it shortly 
after, so they are not going to do you much good either way at the moment. </br>

<br>Chad simply nodded, dropping his shorts to the ground beneath his feet and smiled, enjoying that he was naked around another guy with 
sexual implications to possibly follow. Chad grabbed the bottle off of the table, checking it to make sure that he still had the werewolf bottle 
and uncorked it. Before putting the bottle to his lips, he looked at Johnny with a questioning expression, which Johnny simply responded to 
with a nod, which Chad took to mean, “go ahead and drink it”. </br>

<br>Once again, he placed the bottle to his lips, placing his lips completely around the opening to form a seal so not to lose a single drop and 
tilted his head back, taking the entire contents as a single shot. Chad held his head back with the bottle still in his mouth to ensure that he got 
every single drop in there and when he was reasonably sure that not a drop was left, Chad removed the bottle from his mouth, placing the 
cork back and set it down on the table. As soon as he did, they both noticed that the bottle took on Chad’s appearance with a more manly look 
and filled itself back up. </br>

<br> “Man… that is so weird and kind of creepy! I mean, it’s cool that you can never run out of the stuff, but when it takes on the last person’s 
appearance, it is somewhat over the top in the creepiness factor.” Chad said, standing close to Johnny while waiting for his changes to take 
effect. </br>

<br> “Yeah… I know, I thought the same thing after I drank the stuff! I think what it is, is that the magic is showing who drank the bottle last 
to show the type of guy drank it. To be honest, it’s a shot in the dark since I just happened to come across this stuff not too long before you 
got here. I mean, I: found the stuff; drank it; went through my two transformations; I was impressed by it and wondered who else would like to 
go through what I did. Immediately, you came to mind because I had heard in school through the grapevine that you secretly liked werewolves. 
Since it was through the grapevine, I couldn’t be sure, but I thought I should take the chance.” Johnny said, lying about his true intentions 
because he wasn’t sure how Chad would act. Not to mention, Johnny knew that if things kept going as well as they had been, he would get 
what he wanted in the first place. </br>

<br> “I guess that is as good as an explanation as any. I have to say though, I never thought that my secret would get out! I have always 
enjoyed a werewolf movie, especially the transformations and stuff. I always fantasized about becoming one and now here I am, about to 
experience my own!” Chad said with giddiness in his voice. </br>

<br>Johnny grinned hearing that, so it was true… he really did like werewolves even though that was a complete shot in the dark. It may or 
may not have been because of the pheromones he was giving off, but it didn’t matter to Johnny. Soon, he would have another werewolf with 
him and they could move on to infecting the rest of the football team. Johnny already knew who the next person would be to become like them 
and he would let Chad have all the fun in that one! </br>

<br> “So Chad… how are you feeling? Anything tingling, itching, burning or aching?” Johnny asked, knowing that he should be feeling 
something momentarily. From his recent experience, he knew that all of those things came at the person when the change is initially 
happening. </br>

<br> “No, nothing yet.” Chad said as he absentmindedly scratched at his face. </br>

<br>Johnny chuckled watching him do that while his face went from baby-butt smooth to having a very noticeable shadow starting to come in, 
as if his face were just being dusted with fuzz, but not quite long enough for a shadow. As Johnny kept watching, Chad’s cock started coming 
to attention, filling with blood along with his other muscles that were starting to increase in size, becoming thicker, fuller, supple and very 
round. Johnny tried not to drool, but it was hard not to as he stood there watching the already hot quarterback get hotter with his new, 
blossoming, beer barreled chest! His body hair had already gotten thicker where he had it before drinking the bottle. The hair on his arms, the 
front of his torso, and legs grew thicker, but not much longer, giving him a full pelt of man hair. Johnny also noticed that hairs sprouted from 
his knuckles and the top of his hand. </br>

<br>As Johnny stood there and watched, Chad started moaning, feeling the changes sweep over his body, while his cock continued to get 
harder and harder, enlarging beyond his normal size while his balls also increased in size from cashews to the size of golf balls, which meant 
they were going to be way more virulent and potentx. His muscles, engorged themselves even more and became something like with the 
incredible Hulk. His arms went from being seventeen inches around to thirty inches around; his chest went from being an average forty-six 
inches to a staggering sixty inches, of all muscle while his back muscles thickened, making him bigger too; his abs remained flat, but not 
chiseled or defined… his abdomen just got thick along with the rest of him; his thighs went from average tree trunks to the trunks of a 
hundred year old redwood; and his calves thickened to the size of a basketball from being the size of a baby watermelon. Johnny smiled as 
Chad was definitely sizing up to be one hell of a werewolf! </br>

<br>Johnny knew that the transformation was probably close to continuing and knew that he needed to get a shot of him quickly. Johnny 
quickly brought the camera up and when Chad realized what he was doing, Chad quickly covered his exposed genitals. In the digital camera 
image, Johnny saw that he caught Chad’s surprised expression and smiled. Chad wanted to pummel Johnny for that, but he figured Johnny 
didn’t mean any harm by it, rather he simply needed the new him before the really new him made itself known.</br>

<br>While Johnny continued to think about him being a werewolf, Chad’s changes continued, but now changing him into the beast instead of 
the beast like human he already became. The hair that just got thicker, increased in thickness, becoming fur instead of hair. His fingers and 
hands increased in thickness, while soft pads of flesh developed under his hands and fingers while thick, sharp claws grew from the ends of his 
fingers. His muscles seemed to increase in size, but ever-so-slightly, about an inch at the most with his feet doing the same. His ears 
lengthened and grew pointed while his teeth lengthened into fangs, breaking the seam of his lips so that the tips just stuck out. As the changes 
continued, his moans grew deeper, while he started panting as his face pushed out to a muzzle; his teeth rearranged themselves in his mouth, 
while his nose flattened and grew dark along with his tongue flattening and widening a bit. As the transformation was nearing its end, a sharp 
pain hit him quickly, making his eyes open wide and revealed that the whites had turned to an amber color while his irises turned a forest 
green. Quickly, Johnny saw what had caused his pain, Chad’s tail grew out rapidly from that point with fur sprouting as it grew to reach the 
middle of his massive back. As everything stopped and Chad was able to stand, he felt his now baseball sized testicles sway heavy with virulent 
seed in them, while noticing how massive his cock had become, not to mention that a free flowing stream of pre was flowing from the tip of his 
Foster beer can sized cock to the tiled floor beneath them both. </br>

<br>As the two stood there, Chad chuckled when he saw Johnny drooling over the new, more impressive Chad. He had to admit that he was 
massive, being even bigger than Johnny was in his werewolf form. Immediately, his mind moved to how Mark would be and Chad could feel his 
balls churning. He felt a huge need and desire to get off, but he also found himself needing to service Johnny more. Chad definitely wanted 
Johnny to suck him off because he didn’t think he could wait for Mark, since there was no telling where he was now. Chad, being extremely 
horny and very curious cupped his paw under his cock for a moment as it bobbed on its own with every beat of his heart. It only took a few 
seconds before his whole paw had a nice pool of pre in it, which he immediately brought to his paw and took a quick taste. Quickly, the taste 
went to a full on pouring into the muzzle and licking his paw clean. </br>

<br> “Hehe, it looks like you like the taste, don’t you Chad?” Johnny said slyly, happy to see all of the changes that had become manifest in 
him as of late. </br>

<br> “Yeah, I guess I do.” He said in his new, deeper and more guttural voice. “Never thought I would even consider tasting the stuff, but 
now… I don’t think I can get enough and I know I definitely want more.” Chad finished speaking while he lapped up what his new sense of 
taste and smell could detect. </br> 

<br> “Well… right now, you have a choice to make. Option number one is that we can fuck around, we both get off, and you will have a fill of 
that fluid you want in you so desperately now. Option two is that we find out where Mark is and you can have your way with him. So… which 
option is it going to be?” Johnny asked, extremely curious to see what Chad would ultimately choose.</br></p>
