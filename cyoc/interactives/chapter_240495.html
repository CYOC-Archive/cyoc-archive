<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So who&#39;s coming with your sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently her new boyfriend,&quot; Aaron shrugged, glancing at Chase. &quot;Since the war ended in the kitsune realm, my grandparents have been hosting a bunch of dignitaries. Two of them are around our age, at least by kitsune standards. I guess Kari and Haley befriended them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase nodded, the pair now gazing into the backyard of the Morelands home. For the Harris and Moreland families things had been busy. Aaron&#39;s siblings acting as ambassadors to other kitsune clans, while Aaron and Chase assisted Connor as he took temporary control of the Morelands demon hunting responsibilities. Finally having some free time, the siblings decided to get together. Meaning the two friends, along with their girlfriends, having an opportunity to meet Haley&#39;s new boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what clan are these two kitsune from,&quot; Nyx asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Shimizu Clan apparently,&quot; Aaron stated. &quot;I guess with Hinata gone they&#39;ve taken control. All Haley told me was that the vixen in charge was named Odayakana and that her boyfriend was named Ikuro. I guess he&#39;s her bodyguard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We probably should have dressed more formally,&quot; Andromeda worried. &quot;I mean if we&#39;re meeting a dignitary from the kitsune realm, dad would want us to make a good impression.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You worry too much Andromeda,&quot; Chase smiled, giving his girlfriend an encouraging side hug. &quot;This isn&#39;t that kind of meeting. We&#39;re all just getting together to have a good time and maybe grab a drink. Besides, you look great.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andromeda giggled, the dhamphir smoothing out her sweater as her cheeks blushed. Chase may not understand regal formality but he certainly knew how to put her at ease. As a portal now began to open within the backyard, Chase, Aaron, Andromeda, Nyx, and Charlotte stepped outside.<br />
<br />
Slowly the group watched as three kitsune and the Amazonian kintaro exited. Aaron noting the two tailed vixen along with a young looking three tail with steel grey fur. Judging by the kitsune&#39;s body language, he appeared to be Haley&#39;s latest boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haley,&quot; Charlotte said excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Charlotte HI,&quot; Haley cheered, racing towards Chases twin and hugging her tightly. Aaron always found the pairs friendship amusing. Charlotte, always the competitive athlete, found herself trying to out do the tigress in various athletic endeavors. It resulted in the pair becoming fast friends in high school, a friendship that continued to this day. Now the pair seemed to be in a competitive struggle to see who could give the biggest bear hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to see you Charlotte,&quot; Haley smiled. &quot;You staying out of trouble?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We both know it&#39;s our brothers that are the troublemakers in the family,&quot; Charlotte smirked, drawing a laugh from Haley. &quot;I wanna introduce you to my boyfriend,&quot; Haley said quickly, pulling Ikuro forward. &quot;This is Ikuro.&quot;<br />
<br />
The steel grey kitsune now stepped forward, bowing respectfully despite his bewilderment. &quot;It is a honor to meet you,&quot; he stated. &quot;Haley had mentioned her family was associated with the legendary Moreland family. Even in the north, we are aware of your honorable reputation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlotte grinned, tipping her hat as Kari stepped forward. &quot;Good to see you all again,&quot; she said. &quot;Missed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Missed you too Kari,&quot; Aaron said. &quot;You want to introduce your friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Lady Odayakana of the Shimizu Clan,&quot; Kari said, Aaron watching as the vixen bowed before the Morelands and Aaron. &quot;Thank you for inviting us,&quot; Odayakana stated. The vixen paused as she glanced at the Tepes sisters, her eyes going wide in surprise. &quot;Princess Andromeda? Princess Nyx?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady Odayakana it is a pleasure to meet you,&quot; Andromeda said quickly, curtsying before the vixen. &quot;On behalf of the Tepes family we welcome you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron now watched as both Andromeda and Odayakana now awkwardly bowed before one another. It appeared neither was exactly prepared for the introduction, instead falling back into old etiquette lessons. For Aaron, the entire display seemed somewhat awkward.<br />
<br />
As Andromeda and Odayakana exchanged formalities, Ikuro took a moment to study Aaron carefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re human?&quot; he asked in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kintaro,&quot; Aaron replied. &quot;Same as Haley. Only difference is, when I transform I look like a kitsune where as Haley looks like a tiger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of transforming,&quot; Charlotte interrupted. &quot;You four may want to change. As it stands right now, you probably will freak people out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari and Haley nodded, quickly reverting to human form. For Ikuro, the process was an eye opening experience. Quickly, Haley shrank in front of him, her features shifting into human form, the girl&#39;s jade fur vanishing as she shrank by over a foot. Now instead of an Amazonian tigress that stood several inches taller than him, now stood a petite Asian girl with multi colored hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Haley asked, casting her gaze up at the obviously confused kitsune.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...you are much....smaller than I expected.&quot; Ikuro replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, you don&#39;t like it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Ikuro said quickly. &quot;No it&#39;s just surprising. Your human form is rather...cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Haley blushed, playfully punching Ikuro in the arm before squeezing him in a tight hug. &quot;Thanks hun, but you might want to change too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ikuro and Odayakana nodded, the kitsune now concentrating as they assumed human form. Unlike Haley, neither grew shorter. For Odayakana, the vixen&#39;s orange fur receded, her tails vanishing, as her face began to shift. Long peach colored hair now sprouted from her head, cascading past her shoulders. Both Aaron and Chase gaping at the beautiful Japanese 19 year old standing before them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Nyx and Andromeda frowned, noticing their boyfriends gawking at the attractive college age girl. Elbowing the pair in the sides, Aaron and Chase apologized, their cheeks blushing in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
As for Ikuro, Haley watched with interest as the kitsune began to change. Quickly his three tails vanished, his steel grey fur receding as his face took on human proportions. As the changes completed, Haley beheld a Japanese man of about 20 with grey streaks in his hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew you would look cute,&quot; Haley squealed, squeezing the young man in a tight hug. &quot;Don&#39;t you think we make a cute couple?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am unsure if I should be flattered or frightened by that statement.&quot; Ikuro replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably both,&quot; Chase shrugged. &quot;So who&#39;s driving?&quot;<br />
<br />
Realizing that Ikuro and Odayakana needed outfits more fitting to the human world, the group decided to let them borrow some clothes. Andromeda was only to happy to let Odayakana borrow an outfit, a fitted sweater and jeans. Ikur&#333; though decided on a buttoned up shirt and khaki pants. Aaron thinking the kitsune looked like a college student going on a job interview. Regardless, the group now made their way towards Aaron and Chase&#39;s favorite bar.<br />
<br />
Entering the bar, Aaron offered the bartender a small wave. &quot;Hey guys,&quot; the middle aged woman called. &quot;Got a bigger group than normal. You want the usual?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hoping for something special for these two,&quot; Aaron called back. &quot;Anything special on tap?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Local brewery sent us some seasonal stock that we&#39;re running a promotion on,&quot; she called back. &quot;I&#39;ll send a few pitchers over and let the cook know to whip up a fresh batch of appetizers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron and Chase nodded, the group making their way towards a large table near the back. Settling in Ikuro and Odayakana now scanned the bar, curious about the place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you come here often Mr. Moreland?&quot; Odayakana asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the time,&quot; Chase replied. &quot;And you can just call me Chase. No reason to be so formal, we&#39;re all just chilling and having a few beers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andromeda frowned, throwing her hand over Chase&#39;s mouth. &quot;I apologize for my boyfriend Lady Odayakana,&quot; she said, offering a nervous smile. &quot;We can go somewhere else, somewhere more formal, perhaps a fancy restaurant or..a...um ballroom. I think there&#39;s a 5 star restaurant in New York. Maybe we take a road trip! We would be remiss if we didn&#39;t insist on paying.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase frowned, trying to protest as Andromeda covered his mouth. He didn&#39;t have that kind of money. The dhamphir, though, was determined to make a good impression offering a nervous laugh. Afterall, as the princess of the Tepes family it was her duty to make a good impression to a royal dignitary or potential ally.<br />
<br />
&quot;No that will be quite alright,&quot; Odayakana replied. &quot;This....place. It reminds me of the taverns in the north. Simple, warm, and common. Regrettably I have not spent much time within them lately. I thank you for bringing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah that&#39;s my brother,&quot; Charlotte smirked. &quot;He knows how to show a girl a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group laughed now at Chase&#39;s expense, causing the young man to grumble under his breath. &quot;Speaking of good times, Haley you want to share how you and Ikuro met?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I found him practicing kata alone at the military base,&quot; Haley said happily, squeezing Ikuro tightly. &quot;I thought kata was a kitsune spell to summon cats but it&#39;s actually a meditative practice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously summoning cats,&quot; Aaron groaned. &quot;C&#39;mon Haley I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve explained kata to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you didn&#39;t,&quot; Haley countered. &quot;I would have remembered you saying that. Although, then again you do some weird things. Nyx, did you know my brother collects Yu-Gi-Oh cards? He even has a huge poster in his bedroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron&#39;s face turned crimson, Nyx stifling a laugh as Ikuro cast them a curious look. &quot;What is Yu-Gi-Oh?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A card game,&quot; Haley stated. &quot;It&#39;s a game kids play. My brother had a huge crush on one of character named Tea when he was in high school. In fact, he still plays with our little brother Mason in his spare time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess I know what to get you for your birthday.&quot; Nyx giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not helping,&quot; Aaron grumbled, his cheeks burning in embarrassment. Trying to compose himself, the embarrassed young man now turned his gaze to Ikuro. &quot;Do change the subject Haley, I want to know about the guy that&#39;s dating my twin sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s your twin?&quot; Ikuro asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Aaron said. &quot;And despite her tendency to blurt out embarrassing details of my life, I want to make sure you&#39;re not some creep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am unsure what this creep is,&quot; Ikuro replied, rubbing his chin in confusion. &quot;However, Haley is quite...sunny. I appreciate her bright, unfiltered outlook on life. Lady Odayakana has told me that I am far too serious in my duties and should &#39;lighten up&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like you two have alot in common Aaron.&quot; Charlotte smirked.<br />
<br />
As the group talked and laughed, Aaron began to gain an underlying of both Odayakana and Ikuro. Odayakana was a charming vixen, reminding Aaron of his old babysitter Nat MacGregor. Odayakana was kind, friendly, and easy to talk with despite maintaining a serious air about her. It made perfect sense that she and Kari had become fast friends.<br />
<br />
Ikuro though was far different. Charlotte was right, he was very similar to Aaron. The kitsune was serious, quiet, perhaps a bit awkward in social settings. He didn&#39;t quite understand slang, Aaron summing that up to spending his entire life in the northern kitsune regions. Still, Aaron could see he treated his sister respectfully, asking her if she needed anything, laughing at her jokes (even if he didn&#39;t quite understand them) and most importantly making Haley happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;So wait, let me see if I understand this correctly,&quot; Ikuro said having just heard Haley explain her and siblings. &quot;Your eldest sister, Kari, she was....adopted into your family?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but adopted or not, she&#39;s still our sister, although sometimes she can act like such a mother sometimes.&quot; Haley explained. &quot;Like when she says &#39;Haley, don&#39;t drive so fast&#39;, &#39;Haley, you shouldn&#39;t drink so much before bed&#39;, &#39;Haley, Mason&#39;s too young to watch that movie&#39;, &#39;Haley, this ride will make us all sick&#39;.&quot; Haley explained slightly mocking her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, I remember that. The four of us all got on that new roller coaster ride and we told our moms we could handle it....but we really shouldn&#39;t have eaten before we went on that ride. We all came off of that ride and headed straight to the restrooms.&quot; Aaron recalled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s why I said something Haley,&quot; Kari replied. &quot;I&#39;m your big sister. If I don&#39;t say anything you would have crippled your self or blown up the house by now. Besides, I&#39;m not getting chewed out by our moms because of your bad ideas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but my other question was, if Kari was adopted into your family, then how were you two and your young brother conceived if you only have two mothers?&quot; Ikuro asked as Haley and Aaron looked at each other then back at Ikuro.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic.&quot; Aaron and Haley both answered together.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suspect there&#39;s a more complicated answer, but I won&#39;t ask any further.&quot; Ikuro replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good call. So Andromeda, Nyx, you two are familiar with Lady Odayakana?&quot; Aaron now asked changing the subject.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, our parents made sure we met as many dignitaries from different realms when we were growing up to be all formal and etiquette. I never really cared much for doing it, but Andromeda certainly did.&quot; Nyx explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I did Nyxie Pixie, mom also got us some of the best looking dresses from the different realms we visited.&quot; Andromeda recalled.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were nice....but I don&#39;t think any of them really ever suited me.&quot; Nyx shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet you look great in all of them.&quot; Aaron complimented as Nyx blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;This does remind me of our karaoke night the four of us had. That was fun, although I&#39;m not sure if either of you would be interested in that.&quot; Chase mentioned unsure how Odayakana and Ikuro would respond to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ve had enough beer to go sing,&quot; Charlotte grinned, placing her cup down. &quot;But first I need to use the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go with you,&quot; Kari said, rising to her feet. Within seconds, the other girls stood, making their way to the bathroom and leaving Aaron, Chase, and Ikuro alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can anyone tell me why girls always go to the bathroom in groups?&quot; Chase asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ikuro asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just a funny coincidence,&quot; Aaron chuckled. &quot;Whenever girls go out, they travel in packs to the bathroom. Same as how if they live in the same house, they start to have the same cycle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought it was for safety,&quot; Ikuro stated, Aaron and Chase stifling a laugh as they began to talk more.<br />
<br />
After a few moments, the trio noticed the girls emerge from the bathroom. Immediately though, they began to tense. Two drunks were now speaking with Odayakana, obviously making the vixen uncomfortable. As the girls tried to get to her, the men became aggressive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; Chase sighed. &quot;Caleb is going to kill me for getting in another fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Aaron and Chase looked to get involved, Ikuro beat them to it, quickly marching towards the two men. &quot;Excuse me sir,&quot; he said, gripping one of the drunks by the shoulder. &quot;I am going to have to ask that you let Lady Odayakana pass.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Beat it geek,&quot; the drunk slurred, eyeballing the straight laced Ikuro. &quot;What are ya? Late for the chess club or something? Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m talking to the lady?&quot;<br />
<br />
Faster than either man could act, Ikuro delivered a nerve hold, causing the first man to collapse to the ground before turning to the other. Three quick strikes caused the second man to fall, both men now unconscious as he turned to Odayakana. &quot;Are you okay my Lady?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Ikuro,&quot; Odayakana replied. &quot;However I do not believe employing stone touch was necessary.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry my lady,&quot; Ikuro bowed. &quot;My duty is to ensure your safety as well as our friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my boyfriend,&quot; Haley exclaimed happily, the petite girl leaping into Ikur&#333;&#39;s arms and planting a kiss on his face as Aaron and Chase gawked at one another. Ikuro and Haley maybe mismatched but at least he could take care of her.</p>
