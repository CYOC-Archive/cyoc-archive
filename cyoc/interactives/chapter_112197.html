<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the help of Lance Knight and Martin Stovall; Samantha’s short notice press conference was about to begin. Sighing as she finished signing her name to a form and handing it over to the clerk, she stepped out to the waiting throng of press, camera men, those that are supporting her campaign and several council members who took a moment out of their time to attend the impromptu event. As Samantha Twist approached the podium stuffed with microphones wired to the many different news networks, Samantha takes a moment to remember how she got to the position she is in.<br />
<br />
After the former Mayor Martin Stovall stepped down; announcing it for personal reasons to be with his family after the drama stemming from her daughter’s troubles. The whole town knew he did it because his political career was over. Despite all the good he did for the town; Julie Stovall’s statue 1A convictions and the events that led up to her inevitable incarceration, was a dark cloud he could not blow away. Samantha knew that was part of the reason; the other reasons were, Martin assuming the role of the wer-mer rep for the council and to work on repairing his marriage with Melissa Stovall who is nine months pregnant and expecting twins. Both Martin and Melissa are eagerly waiting for the birth of their new children.<br />
<br />
It was just after the end of January, when Martin announced his resignation as mayor. Naming Samantha Twist as the mayor pro-tem; Samantha found the announcement rather anti-climactic. She knew the moment was coming; being brief by Martin what to expect from some of the shadier council members and what she should focus on town wise. Samantha wasted no time after taking over the next day by rocking the boat as it were. Arnold Steward Stevenson was the first to feel her claws on his backside as he was arrested for influence peddling. She then found evidence of another council member accepting bribes for voting for or against on some matters pertaining to project funding. He was soon removed from office and tossed into jail. Afterwards, the rest of the council knew Samantha was not some kitten that could be pushed around; she meant business.<br />
<br />
Staring at the gathering crowd, Samantha noticed her life partner was absent from the proceeding. She knew Frances was a therapist and had patients to see; Samantha sighed as the corner stone of her moral support was missing. Knowing it would be impossible to hold off the proceedings for the sake of her putting in an appearance, Samantha began to speak.<br />
<br />
“Before we begin, I would like to thank you all for being here on such short notice. I appreciate those who took the time out of there busy schedules to listen to me talk. So I’ll make this short, so we can all get back to business.” Samantha pauses as there was a low chuckle. Smiling she continues to speak.<br />
<br />
“As we all know the deadline to file for running for mayor is this coming Tuesday. Rumors are circling as to whether I will run to be elected as mayor. We all know I was asked to fill in for the completion of our previous mayor’s term; Martin Stovall who is here in attendance. Thanks for showing up and giving me the kick in the ass to make this press conference.” Another chuckle could be heard only louder as Martin acknowledges with a simple smile and nod.<br />
“I am officially announcing my candidacy for mayor for the next election,” Samantha announcing loudly; not giving the throng a chance to quiet down. “Just a few minutes ago I filled out the necessary forms needed to run. If you have any questions, I ask that you direct them to Martin Stovall. I am naming him as my campaign manager.”<br />
<br />
Quickly leaving the podium just as the press start firing off questions, leaving Martin to deal with the hungry throng desperate for a sound bite or more information than given; Samantha breathes hard. Feeling like she was having a panic attack as she hid herself in a nearby empty office. Reaching for her cell phone; Samantha tries to call Frances. Getting her voice mail; Samantha sends a text message, hoping she is not seeing a patient.<br />
‘I just announced my plan to run for mayor. I could use a hug, I’m feeling worn out just from the press conference. Please meet soon.’<br />
<br />
Hitting send; Samantha’s phone rings. Seeing it is Lance Knight on the caller I.D, she answers it.<br />
“Lance,” Samantha speaking; “I just announced my plan to run for mayor.”<br />
“I know,” Lance answering; “my reporter at city hall just told me. Look I know Martin told you you’d have my support in your campaign, but you must know,” Lance pausing; “as the owner and operator of a media empire, I must remain impartial and nonpartisan, especially when it comes to elections. The gazette or any part of Knight Media cannot be seen supporting one party over the other.”<br />
“So does this mean,” Samantha sounding deflated; “that you won’t be helping to fund the war chest as it is often referred by most politicians.”<br />
“That is correct,” Lance answering; “but that doesn’t mean Tachibana and other members of the council won’t help. I’m also meeting my brother later this evening for diner along with my wife Lila Knight. Samantha,” Lance pausing; “I know you don’t like my brother much. What with what he tried to do to Frances after finding out she and you were…”<br />
“That we are a lesbian couple,” Samantha sounding terse; “I haven’t forgotten the drama he unleashed trying to get Frances’s medical license revoked.”<br />
“What I’m trying to get at,” Lance being tact; “is your future opponent is Jack Crawford’s wife. I don’t need to tell you that Benton has no love for that man. If you want,” Lance sighing; “and I can’t believe I’m saying this; I can talk to my brother in supporting you.”<br />
“When you mean support,” Samantha hemming and hawing; “your referring financial correct?”<br />
“Yes,” Lance answering; “but knowing my brother, he might want to get involved with the campaign himself. Especially after I tell him who Kenya’s campaign manager is.”<br />
“I take it your brother has no love with Arnold then,” Samantha speaking.<br />
“It all has to do with the were-donkey’s construction company getting caught doing shoddy work on his estate renovation,” Lance answering; “my brother would relish the chance at giving that jackass another mule kick where it hurts.”<br />
“Oh how ironic,” Samantha chuckling; “I’d like to be a fly on the wall just to see that. But on a more serious note,” Samantha continuing; “I think it would be best that Benton and I discuss this in person. If he is interested in helping, then we need to meet up. Were-cat to were-panther.”<br />
“Like I said,” Lance responding; “I’ll talk to him tonight. Oh and good luck with your campaign Samantha, know that you at least have my vote.”<br />
<br />
Hanging up the phone Samantha sees she missed a text during her talk with Lance Knight. Reading it makes her heart grow heavy.<br />
‘Sorry for missing your big moment. Father showed up after I was seeing a patient all distraught and needing comfort. The news is not good my love. Mother’s cancer has returned. We are at Grrrrrrr having a Carter family gathering. You’ll never believe this, but our son Ben is serving us a trio of sliders for lunch. We’ll talk when we meet up at home okay?’<br />
<br />
“This is going to be one hell of a conversation when we get home,” Samantha putting her phone down and sitting in the empty chair. “It looks like we could both use a hug,” Samantha speaking to no one in particular; but specifically referring to her life partner Frances, who is currently dealing with her own ongoing family issues.</p>
