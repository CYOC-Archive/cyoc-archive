<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After careful planning, Gaia realized it would be better to play it safe. If she revealed herself in a more populated area, it would risk the humans resisting and would make transforming them into her subjects difficult. It would be better to find one or two nature loving humans to transform and bless them with the power to transform other humans into Satyrs and fauns. And the hikers were the perfect candidates.<br />
<br />
Gaia began to quietly follow them until she could see the hikers in question and was excited after what she saw. The hikers appear to be a young couple in their college years, about 23-25 give or take. The male was wearing a dark red hikers vest with beige camping pants, had blonde hair and a wonderful pair or red eyes that clearly had an outgoing look to them. The female’s hair was a nice slick hazel color that went down to her shoulders and while her green eyes were not as beautiful as Gaia’s they still had a friendly look. The only thing the couple lacked was figure. Both appeared to be on the cubby side, but Gaia didn’t care, she was so excited to finally transform the couple that she decided she wanted to do it in style. <br />
<br />
Quietly, the faun goddess used her magic to alter the trail the humans were taking so they’d arrive at the destination she planned for them. “Jules sweetie”, the women exclaimed, “I think we took a wrong turn, this doesn’t seem like the usual route we take.” “You’re probably right Abby, but we find something we’ve never seen before in these woods”, the man replied. They held hands and continued onward until they reached the place the goddess had picked out  for them. Upon arrival, both Jules and Abby stared in awe at what appeared to be a secluded grove surrounded by tree and covered with bright green grass, the sun was even shining down at a small lake with nice clear water thanks a waterfall. And this was the perfect time for Gaia to begin her fun.<br />
<br />
Quickly, the Faun goddess pulled out one the flowers in her hair and crushed it in her hand changing it into a sparkling pink powder and blew it towards the two humans with so much excitement that liquid began to drip from her deer pussy. The powder seemed to have disappeared by the time it reached Jules and Abby, but its power was already in full swing. Both of them began to feel hot inside and their thoughts about the place being a perfect place to rest, became thoughts of a perfect place to fuck. After quickly looking at each other and realizing they were both thinking the same, Jules and Abby quickly broke into a deep passionate kiss and got to work taking off each other’s clothes and were soon lying down on the soft green grass. <br />
<br />
With excitement, Gaia took off her leaf skirt and top, exposing her well rounded human breasts and her wet dripping deer pussy and began to slowly approach the humans. “You mortals seem to be having a good time, may I join you?” The goddess asked. Both Jules and Abby were in shock to see what appeared to be a naked deer girl standing above them, but the powder was so strong that their need for pleasure outweighed their instinct to run and both of them nodded in agreement to let the faun join in. <br />
<br />
Gaia did not waste time, she politely lowed Jules onto the floor and lowered her deer pussy down to his head in which the human male began to tongue and eat out happily, immediately hardening his cock. The goddess then instructed Abby to lower her pussy on top of Jules cock which to Abby’s surprise, slid into her much easier than the last time they had sex. With both women now facing each other, Gaia gently caressed Abby’s breast with her left hand, as for the other, the goddess guided the humans head to the fauns’ right nipple and Abby began to suckle with abandon drinking a nice serving of faun milk.<br />
<br />
As all three began to enjoy the experience, the humans began to change. First, Jules belly felt began to disappear and was soon replaced with a solid set of six pack abs. Abby’s body shape also changed, the chubbiness she had dissolved and her breasts had expanded, obviously not as large  as the G cups Gaia had, but they would make any male and lesbian look at her with lust in their eyes. Abby’s thighs and hips were next immediately thickening and becoming the hiker legs she’s always dreamed of having. The coloring in her hair thickened, becoming curly and grew down to her lower back.<br />
<br />
As their minds were focused on pleasuring each other and the goddess before them, Jules legs, hips and ass began to grow thick white goat fur while Abbys’ started to sprout light brown deer fur. Both of their feet reshaped and hardened into hooves of their respective species and the tails grew right above their asses. Their heads were next Abbys’ head grew a cute pair of deer horns while Jules started sporting goat horns that curled forward like a rams. Their ears had reshaped and became those of their species and freckles that matched the color of their hair appeared around their faces.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, their minds were flooded with Gaias’ whispers as they kept on mating. “Will you serve your goddess? Will you be the Satyrs and Fauns that restore earth to its former glory?” Both Abby and Jules began moaning, “yes, YES!!!” They kept repeating to Gaia, and at that very moment, all three of them climaxed! Jules’ face was soaked in Gaia’s cunt juice as a volcano of his new Satyr cum filled Abby’s new faun pussy. Both Gaia and Abby’s breasts were also at their limit and squirted each other with faun milk. When they finally pulled out, Jules saw that not only has his penis become goat like, but it also increased in length to about 3 feet and his testicles were now tennis ball sized. Abby blushed when she realized she was able to fit the whole thing in her new faun cunt.<br />
<br />
After taking a moment of rest and admire their new bodies, Gaia guided her new subjects to the lake to wash the cum and milk off. “Thank you for joining my herd, Abigail and Julius. I have blessed you both with the same transforming powers that I used to recruit you. Together we shall transform all humans and restore nature to how it was thousands of years ago.” She hugged her new children and then all three begin to discuss their next plan of attack.</p>
