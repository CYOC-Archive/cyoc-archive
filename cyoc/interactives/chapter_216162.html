<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff entered his room and checked to see what havoc the Chronivac had wreaked upon it, only to find that it looked… the same?<br />
<br />
Well, of course, there was the futuristic walls and floors, and his window opened sideways with automatic blinds. And it was immaculately clean, which was very much unlike before.. <br />
<br />
But most important was the Chronivac. To his great relief, his computer was still running with the Chronivac displayed on his monitor. Of course, now the monitor was built into the wall, but it could at least be used.<br />
<br />
Jeff paused and checked under his bed.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, the frame had no supports, it was one king-bed sized piece of aluminum sticking from the wall. He had a couple of things tucked away under the gap. And the bed’s sheets were tucked in hospital corners. <br />
<br />
All in all, not a terrible change. His photos were different, now that he saw them on his desk. His dad was a big shark, though he was out of focus, for some reason. It was the strangest thing. Why were all of his pictures so blurry?<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, he opened his closet to check if he had swimsuits. After all, if he was in California, taking a swim sounded like an excellent idea. He flicked on the light and stared in shock.<br />
<br />
All that was hanging up were wetsuits and re-breathers on the shelves. They were almost identical to his dad’s, if a bit smaller, though not by much. <br />
<br />
He pulled one out and stared at it, wondering why he had one of these when he wasn’t a shark.<br />
<br />
As Jeff stared at his new wardrobe, his bed began to slowly shift into a tank like the one in his father’s room. <br />
<br />
Jeff idly scratched his stomach, not noticing the texture shift under his fingernails from soft skin to rough shark hide. As he scratched, his nails sharpened and grew longer. The webbing between his fingers crept up his digits.<br />
<br />
He heard his father cheer downstairs and turned to toss a wetsuit on his bed, only to find a tank filled with softly swirling seawater.<br />
<br />
“What the hell?” Jeff stared, then glanced at his computer.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac was still open, and to his horror, a progress bar was still filling. <br />
<br />
[Finalizing changes]<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck...&quot; Jeff started to panic. <br />
<br />
Unlike his dad, he wasn&#39;t a very athletic guy. The two barely shared any interests at all. That was rapidly changing as his muscles started to swell. <br />
<br />
Biceps appeared where none had been before. He could feel the tightness of his shirt, pressing against his shoulders and his chest. But that quickly changed as the sleeves seemed to disappear and only two thin straps remained. <br />
<br />
He looked down to see his chest starting to block some of his vision. No longer a completely flat slab, instead there were two hard muscles pushing out in front of him.<br />
<br />
He could feel a lump growing from his spine, pressing against the back of his shorts.<br />
<br />
“No, no, no…!” Jeff panicked, feeling his body bulking up.  He tried to find a stop or cancel button, but the there was nothing. He even tried hitting the power, but nothing worked – the Chronivac just sat there displaying the same message:<br />
<br />
[Finalizing Changes]<br />
<br />
He had to do something, the Chronivac might not just change his body, it might also change his hid mind.  Which meant that he had to find someone to help him. There was, of course, only one person he could trust: Finn. <br />
<br />
They were best friends. Jeff knew Finn would transform him back. All he had to do was convince Finn that this was real and have him change Jeff back when the Chronivac was finished. <br />
<br />
Which got to Jeff’s next problem – as far as he could tell, his new computer was just a monitor and keyboard combo that were built into the wall. Neither of those was portable anymore, and he couldn’t see the Chronivac box anywhere.<br />
<br />
Jeff just sat there, his fear growing at the same rate as his spine, when a memory popped into his head.  Looking to the side of the keyboard, Jeff saw a small red button.  Whatever memory the Chronivac was adding wasn’t quite finished yet, but he had a strong feeling that he should push that button.<br />
<br />
Pressing a webbed finger into it, the wall monitor turned black and a small laptop ejected from a previously hidden slot in the wall – that must be the Chronivac!  <br />
<br />
Jeff quickly stuffed the Chronivac into his backpack, snatched his keys from his desk and raced downstairs. He almost fell on his ass when he tried running on the wet floors, and the sound of water clumsily splashing as he ran caused his dad to turn and watch as he skidded into the living room.<br />
<br />
“Bee in your bonnet, kiddo?” Mike asked.<br />
<br />
“I gotta-Gah!” Jeff gasped as his human teeth fell to the floor, sharp triangular teeth pushing themselves into place. “Gotta go see Finn!”<br />
<br />
Mike turned off the TV, “Hey, let’s go there together.”<br />
<br />
Jeff paused. “Sure, whatever, let’s go!”<br />
<br />
Mike chuckled and walked outside, not bothering to wear a shirt.<br />
<br />
The setting sun outside was so bright that Jeff had to hold a hand to eyes that were growing black and glassy, like a real shark’s. It was hot, too, and his bare feet sizzling on the superheated concrete. Jeff wilted under that hot glare.<br />
<br />
He hissed and danced off the concrete and onto the much cooler grass. <br />
<br />
“You okay, son?” Mike chuckled, slapping Jeff on the back and the sensitive nub of a dorsal fin growing there.<br />
<br />
“Ah! Dad!” Jeff gasped, wincing and rubbing the tender protrusion. “Come on, the car!”<br />
<br />
They lived in a cul-de-sac, palm trees swaying in the middle of the roundabout. Seagulls cried overhead and he grew aware of the noise of cars and boats out in the harbor. The sky was turning purple and pink as the sun began to sink beneath the waves.<br />
<br />
Their car looked wrong, though Jeff couldn’t quite put his claw on what. Perhaps it was longer? Definitely taller, made for anthros. Wait, hold on, anthros didn’t exist. So why was he thinking it was normal. Oh god. <br />
<br />
While before he’d hoped the Chronivac would limit the mental changes to just his immediate surroundings, from his new outlook on the car, it was apparent that his memories were changing more than that.  Which only confirmed the contingency that he had been planning against – he needed to get to Finn’s house before his memories altered and he forgot his human self.<br />
<br />
The two men got into the car and Jeff saw that the driver’s seat had a gap where the lower lumbar support would usually go, obviously designed to allow a thick shark tail to fit through.  That wasn’t a surprise, given that his dad was a shark.  <br />
<br />
What was a surprise was the passenger side seat, which had an identical gap.  With his spine slowly growing longer, Jeff might not need that gap right now, but he would soon.<br />
<br />
“Shotgun!” Mike called out, stepping over to the passenger door and then  swinging himself sideways so his tail fit snugly between the seat cushions.<br />
<br />
Jeff started up the car and began driving. <br />
<br />
The itch of skin transitioning to rough hid continued to spread over his body as he drove. All the while, muscle was building on top of muscle. His pecs bounced and his biceps flexed with every turn of the wheel. The worst part was that it all felt good, if a little sore, like he’d just had the best workout of his life. <br />
<br />
The nub in the back of his shorts pushed further out of him, his spine popping pleasantly as it did, like he was having a good stretch. It wormed underneath the hole in the seat. Jeff struggled to maintain control of the wheel, almost running a red light.<br />
<br />
“Jeff, hey, slow down!” Mike chuckled. “I know you’re excited to watch the game with Finn, but it won’t help us if we crash!”<br />
<br />
“Sorry da-Aaahhd!” Jeff grunted as his balls churned and his height shot up.<br />
<br />
He was suddenly scrunched in a chair too high and far forward. Thankfully they came to a red light, and Jeff pulled the seat back and lowered it. He sighed, stretching his longer, more muscular legs while noticing the feeling of new webbing that reduced the mobility of his clawed toes.<br />
<br />
Was it progressing faster?<br />
<br />
“Light’s green.” Mike pointed out.<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his head and kept driving, the Naval base flashing by. <br />
<br />
Finn and his mom were on the other side of the island in a house on the beach. Definitely not like their house, just a normal residence for an officer and her kid. It was a traditional two-story green and brown bungalow with African Tulip Trees out front, the bright orange flowers swaying in the sea breeze.<br />
<br />
He pulled into the driveway and parked under the shade of the trees just in time.<br />
<br />
His head began to shift, skull cracking and popping. Like ears popping in an airplane, it was uncomfortable, though not painful. He checked his reflection out in the rear-view mirror just in time to watch his ears shrivel away and the hair receded back into the rough gray-blue hide that covered the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
“You look great, pal, just like me,” Mike joked, rubbing his ‘son’s’ neck.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, dad,” Jeff said, trying to keep his voice even, though it was deeper and croaky.<br />
<br />
Jeff opened the door and tried to get out, only to feel a tugging sensation from far behind him.  As his brain tried to map the new sensation, it felt like his tailbone was being stretched… <br />
<br />
“Hey, your tail is stuck!” Mike called, adjusting Jeff’s seat.<br />
<br />
The tail came free, sending Jeff to the asphalt. He caught himself with his webbed and clawed hands, not even feeling the scuff of the ground. Jeff got to his feet and brushed himself off, then noticed that his father staring at him, concern on his face.<br />
<br />
Jeff blushed.<br />
<br />
“Man, what’s gotten into you today?” Mike asked. “You’re acting weird.”<br />
<br />
“Just out of-” Jeff coughed, his voice getting raspier by the minute, “-out of sorts today.”<br />
<br />
“As long as you’re okay, bud.” Mike replied, getting out of his side of the vehicle.<br />
<br />
Jeff paused, staring at the car.<br />
<br />
It was bigger, almost like a Hummer, but longer, the seats made to fit anthros like his father.  <br />
<br />
And himself. <br />
<br />
As Mike stepped around the car, Jeff noticed his father was now wearing a wetsuit. The huge sharkman actually looked happy, adjusting himself as he made his way up to Finn’s door.<br />
<br />
Jeff followed after, trying to get used to the tail weighing him down. He ended up looking a bit hunched in the shoulders. It was uncomfortable at first, but a spine-tingling pop later and the discomfort went away.<br />
<br />
He was having trouble breathing, the air rattling dryly in his lungs as he walked to the door and stood behind his father.<br />
<br />
Mike rang the doorbell and waited.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, a pretty middle-aged blonde woman opened the door.<br />
<br />
Delilah was a pretty woman with a few wrinkles here and there. More than a few kids at Jeff’s school had called her a MILF, and now that Jeff was really looking at her, he realized that she was stacked. His father was definitely liking what he saw, judging from the tent in his wetsuit. <br />
<br />
“Hey there, Delilah.” Mike smiled, revealing razor-sharp teeth.<br />
<br />
Mike leaned an elbow into the door, then leaned over and whispered, “You know, I could be a thousand miles away and you’d still look pretty.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, hi Mike!” Delilah smiled back, blushing, “What are you doing here?”<br />
<br />
“Just dropping off Jeff. He wanted to hang out with Finn, and I thought I might as well say hello.” Mike’s tail wagged from side to side.<br />
<br />
Delilah looked at Jeff, “Absolutely! Come on in! Did you know the Cowboys were playing today?”<br />
<br />
“Of course.” Mike replied.<br />
<br />
“Want to watch the game with me?” Delilah asked.<br />
<br />
“I’d love to,” Mike said.<br />
<br />
The two sharks lumbered into the living room of the bungalow. <br />
<br />
As Jeff walked in, he noticed how dry his clawed feet were on the carpet. That all changed a few moments later as his clothes connected together and shifted into a proper wetsuit. As the gap between the rubber and his skin filled with moisture, Jeff felt invigorated again.<br />
<br />
“Finn!” Delilah called up the stairs, “Jeff’s on his way up!”<br />
<br />
“Okay mom!” Finn called down from his room.<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded at Delilah and rushed up the stairs. <br />
<br />
He had only a glimpse of his father and Finn’s mom getting comfortable on the couch together. That was kinda weird, but Jeff was happy that his father wasn’t lonely anymore. He double checked his memories and, yeah, Mike being lonely seemed fairly consistent. At least this new reality had that silver lining.<br />
<br />
Jeff made it to Finn’s door as he realized that it also meant that if Mike and Delilah hit it off, his best friend would be his stepbrother, which would be kinda awkward.<br />
<br />
Finn was sitting at his computer, playing some RPG. <br />
<br />
He looked over as Jeff walked in. Prior to Jeff’s transformation, Finn had been the bigger of the two. Whereas Jeff had been something of a skinny nerd, Finn was athletic with gray eyes and blonde hair like his mom. <br />
<br />
Jeff waved at him, wheezing as he sat on the bed, the air burning his lungs.<br />
<br />
“How&#39;s it going?” Finn asked.<br />
<br />
“It’s goo-” Jeff choked as three flaps opened below his neck. <br />
<br />
For a second, he couldn’t breathe. Then two heavy rebreathers hooked themselves up to his new gills and seawater flooded his mouth and throat. Relief rushed like a wave through Jeff’s body as the oxygenated water eddied through his gills. <br />
<br />
“I’m good,” Jeff said in a deep, burbley tone that was eerily reminiscent of his father’s voice. “I need to talk to you about something.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah? What?” Finn asked.<br />
<br />
Jeff leaned over and opened his backpack, pulling out the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
“Is that, like, a new console or something?” Finn cocked a brow.<br />
<br />
“Chronivac. It can change reality.” Jeff said.<br />
<br />
“Pfft! Okay, bro.” Finn rolled his eyes. <br />
<br />
“No, it really changes people. I’m not supposed to be an anthro shark. Fifteen minutes ago, I was human.”<br />
<br />
“You’ve literally never been human, Jeff.” Finn said flatly, as though he thought Jeff might be playing a joke on him. <br />
<br />
“God created the world yesterday. Created reality wholesale. Prove me wrong.” Jeff replied.<br />
<br />
“I can’t. How could I possibly-” Finn blinked. “Wait… are you being serious?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Jeff handed him the Chronivac. “Plug it in and I’ll show you.”<br />
<br />
Finn sighed but did what Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“This shit better not put a virus on my computer.” Finn said, reading the instructions on the device.<br />
<br />
“It won’t.” Jeff assured him.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac whirred as it turned on. <br />
<br />
“Alright. What do you want to change?” Finn asked.<br />
<br />
“What would prove that it is real?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“... Okay, assuming what you’re saying is true, what did you do to become a shark?” Finn asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I see,” Jeff got up and wandered over to the computer, “May I?”<br />
<br />
Finn pushed himself away from the desk, “Go ahead. If this is a prank, you’re an asshole.”<br />
<br />
Jeff knelt in front of the desk and started fiddling with the controls. He had transformed his father last time. Maybe if he changed Finn’s mom, his friend would realize Jeff wasn’t full of shit.<br />
<br />
“Any anthro forms you’d like?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“Orca.” Finn rolled his eyes. “You can’t change reality with a computer, Jeff.”<br />
<br />
Jeff chuckled, his own form a blatant contradiction to that statement. Yet, of course, Finn had no recollection of that. He inputted Orca as the target species and changed Finn’s mom to his dad and hit enter. There, Finn would surely notice now!<br />
<br />
The Chronivac hummed to life. <br />
<br />
“It’s making sounds.” Finn backed away from the machine.<br />
<br />
“Let’s go to the stairs and watch your mom.” Jeff smiled.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, I hate when you smile, bro.” Finn shuddered.<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Jeff pulled his lips over his teeth. “Come on.”<br />
<br />
The two young men left the room as the Chronivac processed the request.<br />
<br />
They crept down the hall and descended a couple of steps down the stairs. Not enough to really be seen, back in the shadows. Jeff’s eyes were focused on his father and Finn’s mom.<br />
<br />
The massive shark man had his arm slung around her shoulder, pulling her close to his chest. She was rubbing his thigh provocatively.  As they watched, the two began to kiss.<br />
<br />
“What’d you do?” Finn asked.<br />
<br />
“Nothing.” Jeff blushed, “Uh, guess your mom and my dad have, uh, a thing now.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure how I feel about that.” Finn frowned. “Were we friends in your other life?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but your mom was working a dead-end job at a grocery store.” Jeff whispered back, then pointed at Finn’s mom. “Look!”<br />
<br />
As they watched, the woman on the couch started to grow, her muscles swelling. Three minutes was pretty long for a transformation, but Jeff had wanted it to be fast enough that it would be over before either of them got bored and slow enough that Finn could watch in exquisite detail.<br />
<br />
“Oh my God!” Finn quietly gasped as his mother’s hair fell out, revealing a rubbery black-and-white scalp. He pointed at the back of the woman’s bulking shoulders where a hole was opening up. “Is that a blowhole?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded.<br />
<br />
“I decided to make her a part of dad’s unit,” Jeff whispered back. “I made sure she had extra lung capacity for undersea stuff. The side effect of having highly oxygenated blood is, of course...”<br />
<br />
Muscles. <br />
<br />
The new orca was becoming a towering mass of bulging muscles. As the orca woman shifted in her seat, her long tail extending from her backside, the second part of her transformation began. Her breast, now huge and balloon-like, receded back into her shelf-like pecs. Features grew more blunt, the vaguely feminine curves fading into masculine lines.<br />
<br />
Delilah moaned deeply, spread her legs, and the front of her pants suddenly bulged lewdly as her pussy inverted into a huge cock and balls.<br />
<br />
Then the Cowboys scored a touchdown and the two men stood and roared happily.<br />
<br />
“Wait, you turned my mom into a man?” Finn whispered fiercely.<br />
<br />
Jeff smirked and shrugged, “You needed convincing. Believe me now?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Finn said softly, staring at the two men as a case of beer appeared at their feet.<br />
<br />
“Come, on,” Jeff murmured, “before they figure out we’re here.”<br />
<br />
The two young men walked back up the stairs as the rest of the house began to warp.</p>
