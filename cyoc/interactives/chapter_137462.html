<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Kat and Kel returning to their own timeline, Kellie and Katie were now left with Ann and Jackie. As Kellie gazed at the girl she wondered how this could of happened.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” she sighed, wiping her eyes. “I need to know what exactly is going on.”<br />
<br />
“Ann was approached by someone who said they were Merlin,” Jackie whispered. “He said...that he would make Jackie his daughter. It..it was the only way we could be together. We didn’t know it was a trick. He said that in another timeline Merlin had another daughter, a 16 year old girl who was taken from her timeline. It..it just seemed like the answer to all our problems.”<br />
<br />
Kellie thought this over as she sighed heavily. Morgan Le Fay had used her situation to take advantage of Ann and her friend. What mystified her was Ann being attracted to another girl. “Ann’s not gay though,” she frowned.<br />
<br />
The sullen looking blond now looked Kellie in the eye as she squeezed Jackie’s hand. “This is different,” she said sternly. “Jackie and I....we..we realized we deeply care for one another. We love each other so what does it matter to you if I’m gay or not. I LOVE JACKIE.”<br />
<br />
“You know that accent is kinda annoying,” Kellie frowned. “And who do you think your talking too Ann. Remember I’m the one that taught you how to drive...Ugh looks like I’m going to have to do that again.”<br />
<br />
“Who the hell are you anyway?” Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed as she extended her hand to Jackie and Ann. “I’m Kellie Pendragon,” she grumbled. “I’m the girl Morgan was talking about. Before that though I was Ann’s sister Kellie O’Toole.”<br />
<br />
“What!!!!” <br />
<br />
Kellie sighed as she explained to Ann and Jackie everything that had transpired with her. Jackie and Ann listened intently as Kellie told them how she had accidentally wished herself out of her timeline. Since then she had acquired the Ring of Age, regained her lost memories, and traveled through realities with Merlin. The two 14 year olds listened intently as she told her tale, still trying to wrap their minds around the fact that this girl claimed to be Ann’s long deceased sister.<br />
<br />
“That’s impossible,” Ann stated. “Kellie died in childbirth. Theirs no way you could be her.”<br />
<br />
“Well I am Ann,” she sighed. “Look closely at my face. Remember what I looked like at 16 the first time. Also explain how I know things about you only a sister would know. Like how your first car was a Mazda or that you seriously thought about going to art school before mom and dad talked you into going to college for business.”<br />
<br />
Jackie paused, no one aside from her sisters knew that information not even Jackie. As she gazed at Kellies face she slowly began to see that this girl was the spitting image of her sister. “Kellie,” She stammered. “Your..your Kellie, not Katie’s fiancé but actually my sister aren’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah been trying to tell you that,” Kellie sighed.<br />
<br />
Ann sat silent for a moment before leaping into her sisters arms, crying fresh tears once more. “Kellie,” she whimpered. “It really is You isn’t it. Oh god, how? How is this even freaking possible?”<br />
<br />
“I ask myself that question everyday,” Kellie said softly as she ran her fingers through her sisters hair. Holding the girl at arms length she now smiled sadly at her. “Look,” she said. “I don’t know how this happened. I don’t know what to make of any of this Ann and I’ve lived with this....curse for the past 16 years. I do know that I am your sister, I promise. This isn’t a trick. No matter what happens from here on out I’ll look out for you.”<br />
<br />
Ann nodded sadly as she looked at Kellie before turning towards Jackie. “So what’s going to happen with me and Jackie,” she asked. Kellie shrugged as she gazed back at Merlin. “Well for now you two will stay here,” she said. “I guess that means going back to high school. Merlin will take care of it though, he’ll even give you two your own rooms, separate of course.”<br />
<br />
“Do you think he can get us back in our own timeline?” Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
Kellie turned to the young brunette seeing the fear in her eyes. Kellie wasn’t sure if that was possible. Getting kicked out of the timeline was a pretty severe action, it would take a lot of work from Merlin and Kat to accomplish. Seeing how frightened the two teens were and didn’t want to crush them.<br />
<br />
“I think are chances are high,” Kellie said. “I have a lot of faith in Katie and Merlin. I’ll help anyway I can as well. Hopefully we can get you back soon.”<br />
<br />
“If you can why wouldn’t you return as well,” Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
Kellie winced, she knew she was removed permanently from the timeline. She had erased others where it appeared Ann only erased herself. The difference was that Kellie had hurt others instead of just herself, that action was cosmically unforgivable. Even if she wanted too she could never return at least permanently. Sighing she now looked at Ann and Jackie.<br />
<br />
“I can’t,” she sighed. “You see, we may be in a similar situation Ann but I harmed people with my actions. It makes a big difference magically. I can probably visit but I can’t stay.”<br />
<br />
Ann and Jackie nervously looked at each other before sadly turning back to Kellie. “Hey,” Kellie said warmly. “I’m okay with that alright. I have a good life here I’m not angry. Don’t worry about yourselves we can fix this together Okay? Your situation is different from mine. I’ll get you two back and I’ll fix everything.<br />
<br />
Ann and Jackie nodded as they now hugged Kellie. Kellie tried her best to comfort the two as she worried, hopefully she could break the spell and save her sister and her friend.</p>
