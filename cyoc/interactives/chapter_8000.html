<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The good Professor Fuller was doing just fine till halfway into the Winter semester he was paid a call bt Professor Armon Schneller of the University.<br />
<br />
As the two men of higer learning sat down in Myron's study the conversation began on a very clinical level. &quot;I'm concerned about those student who took the Brazilian trip with the late Professor Simmons. I have done much study with those who continued to remain at the University. There were others I'm told who decided for whatever reason to leave the University and find a new form of interest elsewhere.&quot; said Schneller as Myron choked on his own spit.<br />
<br />
A while later as Myron was more composed the coversation worked it's way to ask Myron questions about those students who he had as aides. &quot;Please may we talk of Scott Murry, Jean Madox, and a Frank...somebody?&quot; asked Schneller.<br />
<br />
Myron replied, &quot;what would you like to know about these people?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These three, and for that matter all of them seem to be going through a withdrawal syndrome of self denial. I ask them questions about their trip to Brazil and halfway along the story seems to twindle down to they can't or don't want to remember.&quot; pondered Schneller.<br />
<br />
As the afternoon wore on Myron was getting rather itchy about all the deep questions he had to answer. At last Schneller being either satisfied or bored decided to take leave.<br />
<br />
Schneller wasn't down the driveway before Myron called the Winter's Farm and made a date with Miss Winters for the coming Friday afternoon.<br />
<br />
A bright sunny Winter day was that Friday and starting out early Myron bid his wife a good bye and headed South. An hour and a half later he was seeing new looking signs announcing the Winter's Farm and Petting Zoo. As he at last saw the drive going up to the white farmhouse he noticed a few cars sitting by the side to the driveway. Odd, he thought but some of the cars were almost overgrown with weeds. While other's stood with windows open and snow blowing inside the car.<br />
<br />
As he sighted the house he saw Miss Winter standing next to AJ. her friend and Satyr she'd talked about.  As Myron parked next to two other abandoned looking cars he was quickly met by Miss Winter.<br />
<br />
A very slender formed woman she had a nice face but the infection of her Satyr lover's pleasures were showing up as shaggy goat hair growing wildly from her pretty head. A friendly greeting from both and Myron was ushered into the warm dwelling.<br />
<br />
Inside he was set down into a big warm chair near a roaring fire. A cup of tea and a brisket were placed for his pleasure. Then it got down to case studies all around.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see then those goats shipped here in the Brazillian crate are happy and contented to remain as goats on a permanant basis! I wonder though of the cars which line the driveway coming to the house? asked Myron.<br />
<br />
AJ. and Miss Winter looked at each other and then with a smile they suggested Myron take a short walk outside.  AJ. quickly trotted off in a different direction as Myron walked with the young lady toward the pasture's fence and gate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come All Come!&quot; yelled Miss Winter toward the pasture.<br />
<br />
Like a white toronado coming in the snow a herd of fair size rushed to greet her becon call. Myron stood looking over the fence in awe. &quot;Are all these, ah were all these, before...?&quot; he mumbled.<br />
<br />
Miss Winter smiled, &quot;Yes the first were Scott, Jean, Ammos, Melody, Lyle, and Jean. Then as people stopped in to pet and feed the goats I learned of so many who for one reason or another felt lost in a crowd. They had lost their identity and with it their selfrespect. It was AJ. who first fixed a special Tunnel of Sensual Delights for those who had the courage. Simply, he took the cursed goat crate and puting it up on it's narrow side he nailed it into the small barn door. Then as a dare he bid one and then others who wanted to be free of life's problem to walk into the barn through the door and crate. WELL, as you can see all those who did lost all human worries and now live in peace and harmony with nature as part of our herd.&quot; she explained.<br />
<br />
AJ pointed to the barn door in question and Myron walked over to see the contraption he'd built. Like a trap it still was much the filthy mire soaked goat crate it was many months ago when first he'd seen it.<br />
<br />
Holding his hands to the door sash he peered inside but had no desire to walk in and find his peace with nature. It was AJ. who with his large cloven hoof gave a slight push to Myron's thigh.<br />
<br />
A strong shove and Miss Winter exclaimed, &quot;Oh no darling, he has a wife and children at home and must provide for them! Oh, unless you'd like to visit as Grandpa Malowne did with his three foster children from the Salonon County reform school. He saw what happened to a young girl one afternoon and since then brought us more than two dozen from the school to be wards on our farm.  The State pays us room and board for them as they learn the value of hard work and farm living. Lucky for us not one of those Social Workers ever checks up on those sent here. Lucky I say, cause we couldn't let them go back and tell about our neat profit making scheme, so they would join our herd as well. I'm sure AJ. had only good intentions for trying to push you inside the crate. if you were of the opinion to go your hands would not have gripped the door sash so tightly and thus you would make a fine Buck.<br />
<br />
Myron gave a nasty stare to AJ for the heavy shove. It was as if fate was playing all it's card when Myron turned to walk back to the farm house his footing slipped and falling backwards he started to slide down the small incline toward the open doorway to the cursed crate. <br />
<br />
A scream of terror slipped out his mouth as he tried to roll on one side and miss the entry of the doorway. AJ and Miss Winter stood atop the small hill and watched without a care as to if or if he did not enter the crate.<br />
<br />
Sliding and rolling Myron strained not to go head first or legs first into the crate less he look in some or all ways as AJ. Wham, he hit the doorway with his shoulders and knees. As Myron hit his knees bent and shoulder's rolled forward enough to allow his narrow behind to slip past the door sash.<br />
<br />
A scream from what felt like an electric charge hitting Myron's butt sent him rolling in the snow. A burning pain ached in his butt and a searing pain up his spine made Myron crawl to his knees and take a deep breath.<br />
 <br />
&quot;That was too close!&quot; said Myron as he looked up at both AJ and Miss Winter.<br />
<br />
Slowly he got to his feet and with greater care walked up to the farm house to finish his tea. Once inside he sat down but his rump was filled with aches and pains. AJ smiled to Miss Winter who was the first to ask Myron to come with her and see a rather intimate and personal enjoyment she'd come to enjoy.<br />
<br />
AJ stayed in the dinning room as Myron led by his cold hand went with Miss Winter upstairs. &quot;I want you to see this as I'm sure you will find an appreciation for it's beauty!' said Miss Winter as the two climed the stairs.<br />
<br />
The top of the stairs reached the entire second floor was one large play room complete with a kingsize bed. Myron stood looking around as Miss Winter danced about taking first this and then that piece of clothing off till she walked slowly up to Myron, stock naked.<br />
<br />
Myron stood looking at her and knew she had only the most sexual of desires at that moment. Her shaggy goat's wool ran off her head and down her spine to a fully covered hind quarters looking much like a goat rump. A cute tail sprouted from her behind and a fuzzy crotch which a man could get lost in was dripping juices on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I.. Mean Miss Winter!&quot; stuttered Myron as she began to remove his shirt and then trousers. <br />
<br />
A short struggle to remain decsent was short lived when as jocky short were ripped down the reason for the burning feeling came into plain sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh NO!&quot; said Myron at the sight of wool covered thighs, wool cover butt, a short but growing tail, his buttock spread wide as if he'd been born a buck goat. As Miss Winter stroked her fuzzy palms over Myron's abdomine he watched as his human penis burrowed up along his groin and made a sheath just like the many bucks he'd seen a short while ago.<br />
<br />
All Myron could do was stand there when the young lady knelt down and began to lick and then suck his then very goat like sheath. Shaking from sexual pangs he'd never felt with Misses Fuller Myron let things take their course.<br />
<br />
Minutes passed as so many things happened and new things came into his view. As he was on top of his pleasured patner he felt a red hot burning on his butt.  A slow turn to see and not stop his thrusting he saw AJ's big Satyr cock probing his now hairy butt. In a quick and harsh thrust AJ's cockhead entered Myron's asshole.<br />
<br />
In, in he went as now Myron moaned as was Miss Winter below him. Now torn between his love below and his rape from behind he slowly sank into the depths sexual hell. Hours passed as then when Myron thought he could not cum again he did and with a surge unequalled thus far. <br />
<br />
AJ stood to one side clapping and making funny half goat bleats mixed with half human words. Miss Winter groaned a friendly moan and as Myron pulled his red, long, goat cock from her juicy wet dripping pussy she helped him lay back on her bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was an orgy to remember!&quot; said Miss Winter as she licked Myron's semen from her lips.<br />
<br />
Myron laid on her bed he took a casual look out the window to see a fresh coating of morning snow on his car. &quot;Hey it's morning again! he exclaimed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is and a fine Monday morning it is too!&quot; said AJ.<br />
<br />
&quot;Monday!&quot; screamed Myron as he scrambled to the side of the big bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quite the orgy!' again said Miss Winter as her fingers cupped the dripping semen and juices from her strained but thrilled pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can't be true, it can't be true!' said Myron as he staggered toward her hot tub in the corner of the large upper room. Slipping down into the hot water Myron felt a calm like nothing he'd felt before. Then with one hand he started to scratch his crotch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God! I'm part goat!&quot; he said as AJ laughed.<br />
<br />
Standing up in the hot tub he looked down at wool covered thighs and legs. A round butt now with more angle as his asshole was out in the air since the fully grown tail had spread out his cheeks. Two huge and healthy testicles hung in a furry sack almost to his knees. The thick wool covered sheat ran to just south of his navel. It was at this point the thick wool thinned quickly and faded to normal human skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Myron come anytime and let me and AJ pleasure you as much and as long as you desire. Oh, and if at anytime you wish to step through the crate's doorway feel free to join the herd.&quot; offered Miss Winter as Myron collected his clothes.</p>
