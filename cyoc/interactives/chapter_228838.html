<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taylor fruitlessly searches the internet until his eyes feel too heavy to continue.<br />
<br />
He awakes to the sound of a garbage truck outside. <br />
<br />
His eyes spring open. “Please tell me this has all been a dream!” He thinks as his hand darts into your pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck.&quot; His penis is still MIA.<br />
<br />
As Taylor enters the kitchen he was assaulted by the smell of fresh pancakes made with coconut oil. The delicious odor catches him off guard, as does the sudden appearance of the person cooking breakfast. his sister Julie, sets down the frying pan she is holding and turns in his direction. “Finally you are up, Taylor,” she berates him as she turns around. She freezes in surprise when she catches sight of him.<br />
<br />
“Fuck. This was one moment you were dreading.” Taylor thought to himself, he had hoped he would be able to return to normal before his sister noticed his change. he was unsure how Julie would react. It had been hard enough explaining himself to his friends, let alone his nutty and potentially violent sister. Taylor and Julie had always been somewhat distant. he had very different personalities and interests. Julie had been spending so much time with her boyfriend lately that Taylor had not even seen her in almost a month.<br />
<br />
Julie appears to be perplexed as she looks Taylor over. She blinks her eyes several times before she finally speaks. “Do I know you?” she asks Taylor.<br />
<br />
“Uh….”<br />
<br />
“Yes, you do. It’s me, Taylor. It sounds absolutely-fucking-ridiculous to say aloud but something happened to me and I got turned into a girl.”<br />
<br />
Julie’s mouth had fallen open. “Accidently?” she manages just a single word question.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean!? Of course it was an accident! I didn’t want this to happen! It wasn’t intentional if that is what you are getting at!”<br />
<br />
Julie starts to giggle. She starts slowly at first until her mouth grows into steady peals of laughter. “Haha hahahaHAHAHA! Oh wow Taylor, that is hilarious.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not funny!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, it is!” she teases.<br />
<br />
“So how did this “accidently” happen?” Julie asks him. Taylor can clearly hear the air quotes. Julie always knew how to get under his skin.<br />
<br />
Taylor sighs. “I don’t know,” he replied. He slowly begin to retell the events of the past days, minus a few naughty omissions.<br />
<br />
“Well I see you helped yourself to my clothes,” she observes. “I am not mad or anything. I think you turned out super cute. Us Roux ladies are all rather gorgeous.”<br />
<br />
“Gee, thanks.”<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t pout! This is actually awesome news. You and I could really spend some quality time together!” Julie’s face brightens as a thought occurs to her. “We could go shopping! Play a little dress up, maybe? Oh! There are some many things I could show you.” Julie approaches Taylor and suddenly reaches out, grabbing a lock of his dark reddish-brown hair. “Oh my god. You have to let me braid this. You have no idea how much I always wanted a sister!”<br />
<br />
“I appreciate the offer, sis. But what about Ryan? You’ve been so busy lately…”<br />
<br />
“Exactly. I have spent enough time with Ryan lately. Too much time! He is great but getting a bit clingy. Oh don’t worry, you know family always comes first with me!”<br />
<br />
“Come with me,” Julie says, with enough sternness her suggestion borders on a demand.<br />
<br />
Taylor follows his sister to the bathroom. “You look ratty and boyish,” she appraises Taylor under the bright lights.<br />
<br />
“Uh huh...maybe because I am a fucking boy?” <br />
<br />
Julie gives you a disparaging look. She pulls down a folding chair and sets it in front of the mirror, before pushing Taylor down on it. Julie starts to roughly brush his hair.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe how long your hair got! By the way, did you steal underwear from me too?” she asks Taylor, as she works out a tangle.<br />
<br />
“Of course not.”<br />
<br />
“Well you’re going to need a bra or a chiropractor: pick one. We Roux ladies are fairly well endowed. At least compared to the men.” <br />
<br />
“Ughhh! Leave me alone!” The apparent fact his family is known for small dicks and big breasts makes Taylor cringe.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he feels his sister’s hands on the crotch of his jeans.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck!? Julie!?”<br />
<br />
“Nope, those boyshorts are gone,” his sister orders as she tugs at his pants.<br />
<br />
“I will wear what I want,” Taylor evenly replied. His sister’s domineering nature is beginning to get on his nerves.<br />
<br />
“Not if you want to be comfortable and sexy.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t care about being sexy!”<br />
<br />
“Didn’t you care about your appearance before? What were all those lame workout attempts for then?”<br />
<br />
“I just wanted to look good and be healthy,” Taylor answered.<br />
<br />
“Well there you go,” his sister concludes. “This is just going to help you look good - and believe me when you look good, you feel good.”<br />
<br />
Julie dusts him with random pads and brushes and Taylor stoically endure.<br />
That is, until his sister holds up a mascara stick.<br />
<br />
“No,” Taylor says preemptively.<br />
<br />
“Yes,” she “corrects” him, overwriting his reply with a stern look and a grimace.<br />
<br />
Taylor had a brief staring contest but he find that he was the first to look away. He tried and stay absolutely still as the strange object works its way around his eyes.<br />
<br />
Next, his sister holds up a stick of ruby-red lipstick.<br />
<br />
“You have got to be kidding me!”<br />
<br />
“Taylor! We have already come this far. Just let me finish. It will be worth it, trust me,” she assures him. Her words don’t make him feel any better.<br />
<br />
His sister steps away, revealing his reflection. Taylor blinks in momentary confusion at the mirror. His lips are red and glistening. His cheeks have an extra brushing of colour, his eyes pop and stand out so much he ends up staring directly at Himself in disbelief.<br />
<br />
Julie laughs at his expression. “I know right? You look super hot!”<br />
<br />
It was undeniably true, he looked exactly like the kind of woman he would have once died to sleep with. The appraisal makes him deeply uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Taylor slumps down, feeling defeated.  “This isn’t at all what you wanted. Yet, what was the point of fighting against the walking hurricane that was your sister, Julie?” He thought to himself.<br />
<br />
“Don’t mope, you’re gorgeous!” his sister chides him.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to be gorgeous!”<br />
<br />
Julie laughs. “Hands up, over your head please.”<br />
<br />
Apparently Taylor had become used to her commands, or at least lost his will to fight. He raised his arms up. Suddenly his sister pulls his shirt off in one fluid motion, leaving his huge appearing breasts to bounce free.<br />
<br />
“What the hell?” Taylor screeches as his sister gleefully cups his tender breasts.<br />
<br />
“Wow! As good as mine, maybe even better,” Julie comments as she fondles his boobs.<br />
<br />
The moment goes on way too long for Taylor to not be weirded out. Finally his sister releases him and produces a bra.<br />
<br />
She drapes it around Taylor backwards. “So you put it on like this. It is easier to do the clasps in the front than reaching behind your back. Then just spin it around and pull the cups up … and voila!”<br />
<br />
Taylor’s eyes return to the mirror. A beautiful woman wearing a bra, ample cleavage on display, peers back at him. If he were alone he would probably be a bit turned on.<br />
<br />
Taylor feels slightly constricted but well supported. He stands up and jumps. He does feel a bit more comfortable. As long as this thing isn’t too tight… <br />
<br />
“Ah, fuck I am wearing a bra…” he says in disbelief. “Fuck. Fuck. Fuck! Why!?”<br />
<br />
“And it looks great on you.”<br />
<br />
“Ughhh….” he groaned at the compliment.<br />
<br />
“Now how about some underwear?” Julie suggests.<br />
<br />
“No! Just...please leave me some. I will try it on later...this is all a bit overwhelming for me.”<br />
<br />
“Sure, no problem,” his sister agrees. “I got some new and gently used things in my room. I will give you some booty shorts but mostly it will be panties I am afraid. You had better get used to it I think.”<br />
<br />
&quot;I will never get used to this.&quot;<br />
<br />
“See, not so bad?” Julie says once you have a pair of panties held in hand.<br />
<br />
“Thanks for the “help,” sis,” Taylor replies  sarcastically.<br />
<br />
“Anytime, sis,” she teases him back.<br />
<br />
When his sister finally leaves Taylor alone, he drift off to his own devices, searching the internet in vain for a cure.</p>
