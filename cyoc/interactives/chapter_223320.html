<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul opened the office door. Alex had his back to the door but turned around as he heard the door open. “Hi there Miss. I’m so sorry about before. I’m Alex”<br />
<br />
“Ah Hi….. You weren’t to know I was using the office to change” Although Paul knew his disguise was flawless he was still scared that Alex would recognise him. “Umm I’m Chelsea”<br />
<br />
Alex couldn’t hide the fact that he was checking Paul out. Paul giggled inwardly. Wouldn’t Alex have a shock if he knew who Chelsea really was.<br />
<br />
“I was just waiting for my Mom. She’s a nurse and is examining Mrs Jones. Evidently she had some sort of medical incident”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I was here”<br />
<br />
“Were you the girl who supervised the class?” Paul supposed Alex would have listened in on the conversations<br />
<br />
“Ah yeah…..” <br />
<br />
“It’s alright my little sister Katie was telling me what had happened. She’s that noisy girl over there”<br />
<br />
Paul glanced across to where Mr Dawson was laying on a gym mat being examined by Mrs Scully. Katie appeared to be observing proceedings. “Ah yes. I met Katie”<br />
<br />
“Do you happen to know my friend Paul? He’s Mrs Jones’s son. He usually comes here after school”<br />
<br />
“Ah… Yes I met Paul. He was here briefly but left. Evidently he had something important to do”<br />
<br />
“He left his school bag here”<br />
<br />
“Probably getting his Mom to take it home” Paul couldn’t think of another reason. “How is Mrs Jones” Paul walked across, keen to end the conversation with Alex who was never lost for words. He couldn’t but feel conscious of the feel of the skirt brushing against his legs. He also guessed that Alex was checking out his bum<br />
<br />
The apparent Mr Dawson (really Paul’s Mom) was also standing near where the apparent Mrs Jones (really Mr Dawson) was being examined. He looked at Paul and smiled. “That dress looks fantastic on you Chelsea” <br />
<br />
Paul tried very hard not to blush. His mother made introductions “Chelsea, this is Mrs Scully, Katie’s Mom and also a nurse. Angela this is my niece Chelsea, who is visiting. I noticed you have already met Alex” <br />
<br />
Paul took note that Chelsea was apparently Mr Scully’s niece. He supposed that was a good cover story to explain ‘Chelsea’s’ presence.<br />
‘And what is the verdict? Is Mrs Jones about to die?” Paul asked<br />
<br />
“She seems perfectly healthy to me. I don’t understand how her hair could have turned grey then back again. I suspect it was some sort of optical illusion” Angela replied. “But I recommend she should go to the hospital and get properly checked out”<br />
<br />
“I’m sure that won’t be necessary” Mr Dawson replied as she began to get up<br />
<br />
“Well perhaps I might stay the evening with you as I don’t think you should be alone”<br />
<br />
“No. No need!” The woman looked with pleading eyes at Mary.<br />
<br />
“Uhum!” grumbled Mary with her deep male voice. “I think it’s time we revealed what has happened Mary”<br />
<br />
Mr Dawson nodded his pretty head for her to continue. <br />
<br />
“We’ve been keeping it secret but I and Mary have become romantically involved. I think it would be appropriate if I stayed with her tonight”<br />
<br />
Angela looked shocked “I…. I never guessed…. You told me you didn’t want to get back on the dating merry go round” she said accusingly looking at the apparent Mary.<br />
<br />
“Sometimes things just happen….” Mr Dawson replied. He looked shocked as well. I don’t think Mr Dawson had been expecting that revelation. As far as Paul knew it was not true. He could not remember his mother dating since his father had walked out on them years ago.<br />
<br />
“Well it’s about time. I’m pleased for you” Angela conceded<br />
<br />
“I’ll take Mary back to my house tonight and take care of her” Paul’s mother continued<br />
<br />
“What about Paul?” asked Alex who had been listening in. “Where is he? I’ve scored tickets to stadium tonight. Deep Sabbath are appearing. I have a ticket for him”<br />
<br />
Paul was shocked. Deep Sabbath were his favourite band. He and Alex were disciples of the group. They were only in the state for one night and tickets had been sold out almost immediately. Despite Paul taking a morning off school when the tickets went on sale he had missed out. “How did you get tickets?” he asked. Shocked once more by the feminine voice he now had.<br />
<br />
“I won them in a radio competition. Two tickets. One is earmarked for Paul”<br />
<br />
Paul’s Mom in her Mr Dawson guise cut in. “Oh dear, Paul will be devasted. He got a call to come immediately and visit his grandfather on his father’s side. It’s the first contact we have had from them for years. He can’t not show up. He’s probably at the airport now waiting to get on a plane”<br />
<br />
“Have you really got tickets?” Paul once more asked. His voice sounded like whine<br />
<br />
“Chelsea’s a huge Deep Sabbath fan as well” the apparent Mr Dawson explained. “She actually arranged to visit me this week in the hope she could score tickets to that concert. Alas she was unsuccessful” <br />
<br />
“I’ll pay you for a ticket” Paul cut in. He desperately wanted to go.<br />
<br />
Alex looked a bit surprised. Most Deep Sabbath fans were teenage boys. The few girls that were fans were usually hardcore goths. Chelsea did not look like a goth. “Um.. Really? You don’t look the part” Alex sounded skeptical<br />
<br />
“You think I’m not a fan? Ask me to sing a line from any song” <br />
<br />
“Ok then… How about All night long” <br />
<br />
Paul smiled the began to sing the song from the beginning. He stopped after two lines. Instead of the copy of the Jimmy Cobain voice he had attempted to emulate, a high pitched, operatic sound came out of his mouth. He sounded nothing like Jimmy Cobain.<br />
<br />
His apparent uncle stepped in to explain. “Probably not what you were expecting to hear Alex. Chelsea is an aspiring soprano, but I think she proved she knows the lyrics. She is a big fan”<br />
<br />
“With a big voice” chipped in Mrs Scully. “That was wonderful”<br />
<br />
“That was ear splitting” commented Alex. “But good. I’ve never heard Deep Sabbath sung that way”<br />
<br />
Paul took amoment to compose his thoughts. He had not expected to sing like that “Then will you sell me a ticket? Paul isn’t here and you wouldn’t want it to go to waste”<br />
<br />
Alex looked at his mother then the apparent Mrs Jones. He was clearly contemplating what to do “Is it ethical to sell a ticket I won?” <br />
<br />
“I’ll pay full price. I know the tickets are $120” Paul blurted out. &quot;But I don&#39;t have that sort of money with me&quot;<br />
<br />
“They are not just ordinary tickets. They are for the front section and come with a back stage pass” Alex stated emphatically<br />
<br />
“Oh!” said Paul. That would set him back $350. He didn’t have that sort of money on hand. His face must have shown his disappointment.<br />
<br />
“But Alex will sell one to you for $120” chipped in Mrs Scully. “He was going to give it to Paul for nothing so $120 is a nice little profit for him”<br />
<br />
“I was about to say that” added Alex “$120, let’s shake on it” Paul accepted Alex’s outstretched hand. They shook. Alex’s hand gripped for longer than was necessary.<br />
<br />
Paul felt pretty good momentarily but then it dawned on him that he had just committed to going to the concert as a girl. “Err. Don’t take this the wrong way but let me make it clear this isn’t a date or anything. We are just going to the concert together” <br />
<br />
“Sure thing Chelsea. It’s not a date” but Alex had a sleazy smug look on his face.<br />
<br />
“I’ve volunteered to drop off and pick up” said Mrs Scully. &quot;Alex tells me the concert starts at 7.30. Where should I pick you up from?”<br />
<br />
“Um……” Paul didn’t know what to say. He looked at his mother and Mr Dawson.<br />
<br />
“Well I’ll need to go to Mary’s house tonight to pick up some clothes. You could pick Chelsea up from there” answered the apparent Gary Dawson.<br />
<br />
“Well make it 6.45 then”</p>
