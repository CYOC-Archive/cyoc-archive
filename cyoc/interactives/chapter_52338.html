<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After they left Kyle, the two girls arranged to spend the night together at Naomi's house.  Naomi's parents were conveniently going out for the weekend so they would have the privacy they needed.  They also agreed to tell no one else about the curse.<br />
<br />
Naomi arrived home quickly to find that her parents had left early leaving money for a pizza and a note wishing her a nice weekend.  Naomi checked her cell-phone which was set to ring when her three hours were up.  There was plenty of time remaining so she moved about the house closing blinds and drapes and locking the doors.  Then she jumped in the shower to wash off the make-up from the play rehearsal.<br />
<br />
As the steamy water flowed over her soapy skin, Naomi dreamed lazily about how her life had changed.  She could not get the image of herself as a shiny, black, rubbery woman out of her head.  That image in the mirror of the girls bathroom was the most beautiful thing she had seen in her life.  Naomi looked at her own body and found it lacking.  That was why there was so much emphasis put on fancy under-ware and fashion, she thought.  The human body is just so plain.  She wondered if she could ever get to walk around in public as a sexy, latex woman, turning all the guys' heads and making the women jealous.  Sadly she had to admit that her latex body would probably have to remain a secret for now.<br />
<br />
Her phone began to ring letting her know that it was time.  Naomi waited expectantly for the magic once again assert itself over her plain reality.  She looked at her body to watch the change, but none came.  She looked to her navel to see if it would be like is was before.  But there was not liquid rubber oozing from her anywhere.  Puzzled, Naomi stepped from the shower stall and dried off, wrapping the towel around her as a make shift dress.<br />
<br />
Her phone was correct; three hours had elapsed since she had found the curse.  Where was the change?  She wondered if Jen had made a mistake in her wording.  Maybe the curse really was not real and she had been dreaming.  But she could not deny that Jennifer had seen her and then there was Kyle who had acted like it was true.  Why had she not changed back?<br />
<br />
Naomi was about to phone up Jen and ask her when there came familiar noises downstairs.  A stab of panic rose in Naomi as she feared the worst: a stalker, or her parents had entered the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naomi?  Hello?&quot; a voice called out.  Naomi recognized it as that of her older sister, Cathy.  What was she doing home when she should have still been away at university?  Naomi hustled out of the bathroom and down the stairs to find Cathy in the front hall amongst bags of dirty clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; the pretty, older version of Naomi said.  &quot;Mom, said they were going away and that you would be home all alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you decided to come watch over me?&quot;  Naomi asked a little hurt that her family still thought of her as a child in need of watching over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.  I needed to get a good meal and clean clothes.  Besides it will be fun to spend time with my best sister.&quot;  Cathy said making herself once again a part of the home.  &quot;And now that the shower is free I think I will hop in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Naomi shifted and adjusted the towel.  She had nearly forgotten that she had rushed down to confront the intruder without getting dressed.  It was at that moment that Naomi saw the first signs of black rubber spreading over her fingers.  Panicked, Naomi hid her hands behind her back hoping that her sister would not see.  Naomi could feel the liquid running up her arms and also up her legs.  It would only be a few moments before Cathy noticed.  Cathy was too busy arranging her bags and discarding her shoes to look at her nearly naked sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great.  I'm going to go get dressed, sis.&quot;  Naomi said evenly.  She started to move backward from the hall.  Once out of sight, Naomi planned to run to her room and hide under the sheets to call Jen.  If Cathy were home it would be impossible to keep her from finding out about the curse.  As she took a step back her rubbery feet squeaked on the hard tile of the hall.<br />
<br />
Cathy looked up at the unusual noise, straight at Naomi's feet which were black and shiny and molded into perfect toe-less forms.  Naomi could feel the rubber flow over her shoulders and down her back.  It flowed over her bottom and up her neck.  Time seemed to slow as Cathy's gaze followed the black rubber up Naomi's legs.  In that same instant, Naomi turned and flew up the stairs making for her room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Cathy was heard to call after the fleeing Naomi.<br />
<br />
Naomi closed the door behind her and tumbled onto the bed naked.  Somewhere down the hall she had lost the towel in her haste.  As she lay there the magic liquid was closing over her breasts and inching over her chin.  Naomi felt her hair disappearing as the liquid touched it moving over her scalp.  Naomi's heart was pounding in her chest loudly.<br />
<br />
Suddenly her door swung open; Cathy behind it.  &quot;When did you buy those shiny leggings?&quot; she said.  The words died as they left her mouth.<br />
<br />
Naomi watched her sister as the liquid closed over her body and flowed over her face once more leaving her a liquidy, shimmery, rubber girl.  Naomi naked and splayed over her bed was on full view for her sister; whose mouth was hanging open.<br />
<br />
There was no scream from Cathy as Naomi pulled the covers over herself.  Cathy simply slumped into the desk chair staring blankly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can explain if you will let me,&quot; Naomi said hoping for the best.</p>
