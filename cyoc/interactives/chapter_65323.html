<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A group of college kids came to Toon Town on a trip.<br />
<br />
Four of them had an interest in animation.<br />
<br />
There was Drake, a popular guy, but nice too.<br />
<br />
There was Jack, Drake's best friend - always new how to make others laugh.<br />
<br />
There was Helen, a nice looking girl, but really mean and bossy.<br />
<br />
Last, there was Rene, a shy but smart girl who wore glasses. <br />
<br />
Drake wanted to be a professional animator, while Jack wanted to write jokes to go with Drake's animation.<br />
<br />
Helen wanted to be a professional animator too, but unlike Drake, she was only in it for the money. Rene was pretty much her toadie - always <br />
doing her homework for her, and even helping her carry her things. Secretly, Rene loved Drake, and wanted the same thing he wanted. She <br />
wanted so many times to tell him how she felt, but she was too shy. She also wanted to tell off Helen, to stand up to her and tell her how mean <br />
she was being, but Rene was just too nice, and much too scared of Helen - the last time she tried to do so, Helen smashed her glasses, and <br />
almost smashed her face! Since then, Rene never had the guts to confront Helen, and simply did what the witch wanted without questioning <br />
her.<br />
<br />
Drake secretly had feelings for Rene, but was afraid of what confessing his love for a girl like her would do to his image. He and Jack want to <br />
get a bite to eat for lunch, while Helen and Rene went to hear a discussion on how to be successful in the animation business.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Rene,&quot; Helen said &quot;those artists are going to be telling us the secrets to getting rich off of making cartoons to entertain mindless kids, <br />
and jobless beatnicks who have nothing better to do with their lives. Once I know those secrets, I'll be on my way to the top. I want you to take <br />
notes - write down everything and anything you hear, understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Helen,&quot; Rene said meekly &quot;but what will YOU be doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you suggesting that I break a nail or risk getting a hand-cramp writing it myself?&quot; Helen asked, annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So then it's fine if I break a nail or get a hand cramp?&quot; That's what Rene WANTED to say, but since she didn't want to pay for another pair of <br />
glasses, she instead said &quot;No Helen, I just wanted to know what you'd be doing. That's all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Helen &quot;if you must know, I'm finally going to ask this cute boy I've had my eye on for a while out on a date with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Rene &quot;Who's the poor - er - I mean lucky guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Helen glared at her briefly &quot;I'll ignore that plea for your lenses to be cracked and tell you. I'm asking Drake out!&quot;<br />
<br />
At this, Rene's heart froze &quot;You can't have him! He's mine! I saw him first!&quot; is what Rene wanted to say, but instead said &quot;That's nice - I didn't <br />
know you loved him.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't.&quot; Helen said with an evil smile &quot;I know he's on his way to the top too - once we both become successful, I'll marry him, then dump out <br />
on the streets! Don't worry I'll make up a good excuse, but for now, my pet, we've wasted enough time. Have your pencil and notepad ready.<br />
I'll come back in an hour when it's over, and if you mess this up, you'll be paying for much more than just a new pair of frames! Have fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she left Rene to write for her while she went to find Drake.<br />
<br />
The discussion started. After the first 5 minuets, the lead in Rene's pencil broke. She tried shaping it, but fond it was broken all the way <br />
through! Desperate, she reached into her bag to grab another, but was accidently bumped into, all her pencils spilled out, rolled down the <br />
floor, and were crushed by someone stepping on them by mistake. Rene was scared - really scared, so she ran out and looked for a safe place <br />
to hide where Helen wouldn't find her. She ran past all sorts of toons, politely excusing herself each time. She looked behind to see if Helen <br />
was there and bumped into someone. <br />
<br />
It was a toon duck woman. &quot;I'm so sorry!&quot; Rene said. &quot;It's ok.&quot; the toon duck woman said smiling &quot;I'm used to to it. I once got flattened by a <br />
steamroller, so this is nothing! Oh, but were are my manners? Hi, I'm Lylac, and before you say anything, no, I'm not related to any of the more <br />
famous toon ducks! Sorry, but I can't stand being in anyone else's shadow. Now what's your name?&quot; &quot;It's Rene,&quot; she said &quot;and I can relate to <br />
that. I know a certain person's shadow whom I'd like to get out from under!&quot; Rene then burst into tears. &quot;Wanna talk about it?&quot; Lylac asked.<br />
&quot;Not really.&quot; Rene said, wiping her tears and cleaning her glasses. &quot;Talking about it will make you feel better.&quot; Lylac gently suggested. &quot;Alright.&quot; <br />
Rene said. &quot;Come with me,&quot; Lylac said, taking Rene's hand in her feather-covered one &quot;and we'll talk about it at my place.&quot;<br />
<br />
When they got there, Rene saw it was a typical toon house, and the two went inside. After Rene had spent time explaining herself, Lylac felt <br />
very sorry for her. &quot;You poor thing.&quot; she said &quot;That Helen sounds like a real pig - no, wait I take that back, because the way you described her, <br />
any comparison between her and a pig, is strictly an insult to the pig!&quot; &quot;Heh,heh. Thanks,&quot; Rene said, smiling &quot;I needed that, but what am I <br />
going to do about her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold still.&quot; Lylac said. &quot;What for?&quot; Rene asked. Lylac then pulled a giant wooden mallet out of nowhere, and raised it over Rene's head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eep! What are doing?&quot; Rene screamed. &quot;It's for your own good, sister! Don't worry - I won't feel a thing!&quot; and before Rene could even move an <br />
inch, she was smashed into the floor with the mallet.<br />
<br />
It left a big hole in the floor, and Rene crawled out of it, but she was now a toon fox, with purple fur, pink fur where white fur should've been, <br />
long, red hair, sparkling blue eyes with long lashes, breasts too big and hips too wide for a human girl, but for a toon fox girl, just right. She <br />
now wore a sleeveless yellow top, and a red mini-skirt, with a hole for her big, bushy tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to me?&quot; Rene asked, noticing her new, seductive voice &quot;Brought out the real you.&quot; Lylac said smiling &quot;The 'you' that you've <br />
always been too afraid to show Helen, or anyone. Do you like it?&quot; Rene felt her muzzle, and her tail, and grinned happily showing some cute <br />
fangs &quot;I love it! Thanks Lylac! Thank you soooo much, but I look and sound so different that no one will recognize me now! Could I at least have <br />
some glasses, please? I don't need them, but I don't want to lose myself completely!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then take these.&quot; Lylac said smiling. She took out a pair of glasses with red frames, and pink lenses. Rene tried them on. &quot;Well?&quot; asked Lylac.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like them.&quot; Rene said. &quot;Now take this too.&quot; Lylac said as she gave Rene a huge water gun. &quot;What's this for?&quot; Rene asked. &quot;Aim that at Helen,&quot; <br />
Lylac said &quot;and the same thing that happened to you will happen to her - she'll become a furry toon, and like you, be exposed for what she <br />
really is - like you, she won't be able to hide it anymore!&quot; At hearing this, Rene grinned slyly. &quot;Thanks, sister!&quot; she said &quot;Hee-hee-hee! This is <br />
gonna be fun! Never fear, Drake, I'll save you from her, my love!&quot; With that, she stuffed her new weapon in an invisible pocket, and proudly <br />
marched out the door. &quot;Happy hunting!&quot; Lylac called out to her, as she waved good-bye with one of her hand-wings &quot;Let me know how it goes, <br />
ok?&quot; <br />
<br />
Rene, now a beautiful toon fox girl, walked with new confidence. &quot;Alright, Helen.&quot; she said to herself, smiling impishly &quot;You wanted to know <br />
about animation? You're about to get a crash-corse - whether you like it or not! Eee-hee-hee-hee!&quot;<br />
<br />
