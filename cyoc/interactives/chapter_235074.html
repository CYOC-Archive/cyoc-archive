<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She could barely reach the peddles but atleast she wanted some A/C. Struggling around her squished body to reach the keys. <br />
What was happening to her? An allergic reaction? <br />
She had seen the news headline but, she definitely knew she wasn&#39;t this big a moment ago. <br />
She didn&#39;t want to go back to the hospital though. <br />
Straining as she pressed her squishy breasts against her steering wheel, luckily not firm enough to set off the horn with her... honkers. <br />
<br />
Adjusting and trying to sit up and get the key in but her body was blocking her arm. <br />
Finally pushing and pushing til she got to the area and felt the key around for the hole. Jamming it in as the A/C started. <br />
She was still in park though. At the hospital. Luckily no one had told her she couldn&#39;t be here...<br />
The radio had automatically come on but was cut short by her phone bluetooth connection ringing. It was Drew her boyfriend. <br />
She pressed answer. Biting her lip. Maybe he could help somehow.<br />
&quot;Hey Pam&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey Drew-Boo. I&#39;m just leaving the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even though Pam couldn&#39;t quite remember what had brought her here she assumed he would know. <br />
&quot;The hospital are you ok?&quot;<br />
Guess he didn&#39;t. <br />
&quot;Yeah. Just some pregnancy stuff.&quot;<br />
&quot;Pregnancy stuff? You&#39;re pregnant??!&quot; <br />
This surprised Pam. <br />
&quot;Um yeah Drew. I&#39;m pregnant. You&#39;d&#39;ve had to have known I was pregnant this whole time.&quot;<br />
There was a pause as the lie became true. <br />
&quot;Oh of course I know you&#39;re pregnant. Wait just leaving the hospital? You said you&#39;d be home by now.&quot;<br />
Crap. <br />
&quot;Oh I mean... I&#39;m pulling in the driveway. Pregnancy brain y&#39;know...&quot;<br />
Pam blinked and suddenly her surroundings were different as well. She was sitting in their shared driveway of their rental house, car still on, exactly the same position. Was she experiencing blackouts...? But... she wiggled her feet trying to reach the pedals again, pressing her large buoyant belly against the wheel, nipples sore as ever. She couldn&#39;t have driven here. She couldn&#39;t even drive?<br />
<br />
This was so weird. <br />
She opened the door sticking a leg out, straining. She had been afraid of this... she wiggled, unable to reach the pavement. Pulling her belly but it was caught against, under, all around the wheel, her breasts wiggled free, but it hurt to put too much pressure on the belly. <br />
She was still on the line with her boyfriend. <br />
&quot;Hey Drew can you come help me out? I think I&#39;m stuck. I&#39;m too short or too fat or something.&quot;<br />
Cue an unnoticed two inch shrink on her legs, and an extra layer of fat to her thighs. She didn&#39;t necessarily notice it with the current situation. <br />
&quot;Hang on I&#39;ll be right out.&quot; <br />
The call ended. <br />
Drew her boyfriend exited the house and seemed astonished at his wiggling girlfriend struggling to get out of her car. <br />
&quot;Babe! What happened! I knew you were pregnant but-&quot;<br />
The lie was fighting his memory, it hadn&#39;t been specific on HOW pregnant she was. <br />
&quot;You had- Nngg- to have- nng known how pregnant I was Drew. You&#39;ve been living with me&quot; Pam said exasperated, &quot;Now please help me out!&quot; <br />
&quot;Ok Ok! Geez.&quot; Her boyfriend came to wiggle her thigh out, then by some careful turning slowly squeezed his girlfriend and her dectuplets out. She immediately collapsed to her legs. Way heavier than she had been when she got in. <br />
&quot;Woah babe are you ok?&quot; Drew asked trying to help her up.<br />
Pam was annoyed &quot;Yeah I&#39;m strong.&quot;<br />
Toned muscles appeared helping her get to her feet. But she was still heavy. Pregnancy hormones were making tears bite at her eyes. <br />
What WAS happening to her? Something. SOMETHING. Was off. She didn&#39;t remember having this many. She wouldn&#39;t have signed up for this many right?<br />
She was like a beach ball. Her belly reached up to her chest. Her breasts flopped over. She wasn&#39;t sure if her milk had come in yet, but it kind of felt like it? They were hot and sore. <br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just... get inside ok?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok... &quot; Drew said concerned, aiding her in getting in. Despite her &#39;strength&#39; she still needed help with a sturdy stance to slowly make it to the door. She was nearly immobile. <br />
Holding onto the door she was reminded of that old woman and she shook off Drew&#39;s arm a little annoyed.<br />
&quot;I can do this myself.&quot; she huffed at him. <br />
And with that the load lightened. She had the adequate strength to make it inside and onto the couch. Even if she practically broke the couch as she sat down. It sagged and squeaked. <br />
Drew ignored her snaps as she&#39;d been a hormonal mess since the pregnancy. He knew she was due any day now. Infact she was overdue. Her due date was over a week ago. Especially with this many babies it was concerning. <br />
He sat down next to her looking around for the remote. While Pam teared up a little overwhelmed. Trying to piece together the clues. Her clothes weren&#39;t fitting right wasn&#39;t that a sign?<br />
She opened up a bag of chips they had left on the couch while Drew flipped through the channels eventually landing on the news. <br />
It took him a moment to realize she was crying. Uh oh.<br />
Usually it was some sort of vanity issue, or hormones, or how much she had been eating or well- she was pregnant it was really a roll of the dice. <br />
Finally she started to openly cry and express why she was so upset.</p>
