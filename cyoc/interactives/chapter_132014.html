<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Soon after Moe left to go to the police station, Nichole started her day by taking her shower and getting dressed.  She noticed that Karen was still asleep, so Nichole kept quiet as she made her way out of the house.  She also noticed the note that Moe left and hoped Karen would listen to her father.<br />
<br />
The high school wasn&#39;t far away from their house, so it didn&#39;t take long for her to walk to the high school.  However, the walk did give her time to think about the situation that her family was in.  A son of a mobster gangster took eyes on Karen, and as a result, made life difficult for her entire family.  Moe was running a successful pizzeria, but when Karen gave no for an answer, the entire mob family came down on Moe&#39;s business.  This forced the entire family to move out and since then, they&#39;ve been living on their savings.  They moved from town to town seeking refuge, but each time, the mob family found them.  When an old family friend invited them to live in Moon Lake, the Charlestons jumped at the chance.  At first, it seemed to be perfect.  Secluded.  Private.  And just about everything else needed to start a new life.  But soon after the truth of the town hit them.  This was a town was a town full of weres!  And their old family friends are now weredogs.  To make matters even worse, the town wanted one of them to give up their humanity.  This was simply unacceptable to Nichole, but she knew that the family couldn&#39;t move anymore.  Their savings was just about gone, and they were all tired of running.  Nichole took a quick glance at the morning sun as she continued to walk.  Moe seemed open to the idea if nothing else to protect the family.  But if he changed, Nichole would have to as well, else they would never be intimate again.  Karen, though, seemed most open to the idea, and maybe even wanted this.  This idea disturbed Nichole even more.  Would Karen be really that willing to give up her own self?  Did Nichole go wrong in teaching her daughter?  These thoughts swam through her head as she approached the school.<br />
<br />
It was still early morning, and Nichole could see students still going to the school and in the hallways.  She noted that classes probably haven&#39;t started yet.  It was then that she noted just how...&quot;healthy&quot; the student body looked.  The girls seemed rather stacked for teenage girls, yet none of them looked overweight.  Rather, they all looked like they had the perfect figures, and just about all of them could pass for being models.  The boys, on the other hand, certainly had muscle on their bodies.  None of them were too lanky or skinny, but none of them were overweight either.  Rather, they all had a variety of muscles on them, and they all looked like they worked out at the gym.  A few of the boys noticed Nichole staring at them, and they just simply smiled and waved.  Nichole quickly turned away blushing.  &#39;What&#39;s wrong with me?&#39; she thought to herself.  &#39;I&#39;m old enough to be these boys&#39; mother, and I&#39;m happily married!  So why do I feel attracted to them...&#39;<br />
<br />
Fortunately for Nichole, she didn&#39;t have long to walk before she made it to the principal&#39;s office.  Going through the door gave Nichole an opportunity to clear her earlier thoughts as she approached the secretary.  &quot;Can I help you?&quot; the secretary asked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Um..yes,&quot; Nichole started, &quot;We just moved into town, and I need to enroll my daughter into the school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; the secretary said as she pulled out a few forms.  &quot;Fill these out, and we can get started.&quot;  Nichole looked at the forms for a moment and grabbed a nearby pen to write on the forms.  While Nichole was filling out the forms, the secretary started to ask a few questions.  &quot;So, how long have you been in town?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A couple of days,&quot; Nichole answered as she continued filling out the forms.<br />
<br />
&quot;And has Samantha visited you guys yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole paused as she looked up to the secretary, &quot;Yes...&quot; she answered slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; the secretary said as she jotted a few notes on a pad.  &quot;Is your daughter still normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Nichole asked as she looked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the secretary said, &quot;What I mean is that if your daughter is the family were or if she&#39;s still normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole paused to think for a bit before answering, &quot;Normal for now.  We...uh...haven&#39;t really discussed what we wanted to do concerning the town law.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; the secretary said as she made a few more notes.  She then noticed the expression on Nichole&#39;s face.  &quot;Listen,&quot; the secretary said as she put a hand on Nichole&#39;s.  &quot;We see new people come in here all the time, and they always come with certain...concerns.  While the vast majority of our students are weres, we do have what we called &#39;normal&#39; students here.  We understand the risks that they take coming here, and we take their safety quite seriously.  We even have strict rules here at the school.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of rules?&quot; Nichole asked, her full attention on the secretary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no changing at the school, except in cases of emergency or during certain functions.  We have a strict policy of no shows of affection at the school.  We have very little in way of sports, and for physical activities, we generally separate the normals from the weres.  The town itself have laws against the forced transformation of normals, except in very specific circumstances.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole listened, and looked a bit more relieved.  &quot;So...my daughter will be safe?&quot;<br />
<br />
The secretary nodded and said, &quot;Let me put it to you this way.  We haven&#39;t had an incident since I&#39;ve been working here, and I&#39;ve been working here a long time.&quot;   The secretary made a few more notes before asking, &quot;And how old is your daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sixteen, but we&#39;ve been moving quite a bit so she&#39;s a bit behind in her schoolwork.  With the number of credits she has, she might be considered a sophomore rather than a junior.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry.  This happens on occasions, and we do have programs to help students catch up if they&#39;ve fallen behind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear that,&quot; Nichole said as she finished filling out the paperwork.  She handed the paperwork to the secretary.<br />
<br />
The secretary took a moment to look through the paperwork and said, &quot;It looks like everything&#39;s in order.  It&#39;ll take us a couple of days to process all of this as well get the transcripts from the previous schools.  Come back then and we&#39;ll have a schedule for her to get started.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you so much,&quot; Nichole replied as she gathered her things.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my pleasure,&quot; the secretary replied as Nichole walked out the door.<br />
<br />
Nichole walked out of the door and back into the school hallway.  She noticed all of the students were starting to file into classrooms, and she figured that classes must be starting.  She watched as a group of teenage boys walked past her, and all she could do was stare while biting her lip.  The boys either didn&#39;t notice, or they didn&#39;t care as they quickly walked into a nearby classroom.  Nichole could feel her face flush as her heart beat in her chest.<br />
<br />
&#39;No, Nichole,&#39; she silently chided to herself, &#39;You&#39;re a happily married mother and those are just teenage boys.  You&#39;ve got no right to be attracted to them.  Ugh, I need to see Moe when he gets back...&#39;  She quickly made her way out of the school and back out to the street back home.  Once she was in the fresh air, she took a deep breath before she started walking home.  It was time for her to think about what she heard from the secretary.  Perhaps living in this town wouldn&#39;t be as bad as she thought.<br />
<br />
As she approached her home, Nichole saw Francine also walking towards the Charleston home.  Nichole waved to Francine, and Francine waved back.</p>
