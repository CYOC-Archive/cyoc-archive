<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sitting at the lunch table, surrounded by most of her friends, was Cassidy Rosen. She was a 17 year old girl, known for her constant breaking the most basic rules around school. She wasn’t a bad kid, but she was naturally rebellious, but wasn’t a jerk to anyone around her.<br />
Cassidy was very open about herself. She shared her feelings when she felt them, her emotions, her passions. She shared her likes, dislikes, stuff she really didn’t mind and the stuff that really bothered her. <br />
<br />
Cassidy rebelled at any moment she had the opportunity to, which is why her hair was dyed a soft pink despite the schools strict rules against it. But what people often found strange was Cassidy’s ability to just get away with stuff. Her hair was pink, and it had been that way since 8th Grade, and it just stuck. It was peculiar, but nobody really paid attention to it. It was just Cassidy being Cassidy, right?<br />
This was the most substantial thing to have happened, but there were a number of other, little things that followed. What most people remembered was a strange event, when a teacher by the name of Miss Pebbles shouted at Cassidy’s friend Annie for having her cleavage exposed (and advertised). Annie wasn’t too phased by it, as she had to deal with it regularly, but something struck a nerve with Cassidy. Suddenly, Miss Pebbles’ blouse burst open, exposing her own bright red bra. Her face turned the same colour as her bra as she tried to cover up, shrouded in embarrassment.<br />
After that, teachers never questioned the exposing of cleavage around the school, similarly to Cassidy’s hair.<br />
<br />
Cassidy never really thought about it that much…<br />
<br />
— — —<br />
<br />
…but maybe it was something to do with what the rest of the group were talking about, but Cassidy’s mind wandered. She would usually be very invested in the conversation, but her mind was fixated on this weird event that took place a year ago. She even questioned her hair.<br />
Out of sheer boredom, and because it was the kind of person she was, she looked to her friend Katie.<br />
<br />
Katie was studying, paying little attention to the conversation. She didn’t have a test to prepare for, she was just studying. She was super smart, with a plan to go to a really prestigious college in the next year or so. She was known for two things: her great knowledge of Maths and Science, and her pretty decent assets.<br />
She’d only ever had one boyfriend. Ignoring all the boys eyeing her down every hour of every day, she managed to fall for a boy in her Biology Class. He wasn’t the most attractive guy, especially when comparing him to her, but she clearly fell head over heels for her.<br />
Being that she was totally out of his league, he jumped at the opportunity to date this hot science nerd.<br />
The relationship lasted a solid three weeks, being broken up with by the boy as she was ‘too intense’ for him. He left Katie in a total mess, to the point where she literally couldn’t even study.<br />
The boy didn’t talk to her again, but gradually, over the course of a month, he began to gain considerable weight. Going from a scrawny little boy to a total blimp. He could barely fit into the science lab. He left the school in humiliation after he broke a stool from his sheer weight. As far as Cassidy was aware, he had returned to something of good shape, making his weight gain even more abnormal.<br />
<br />
Cassidy added this thought to her already sceptical thoughts, and decided to imagine Katie getting bigger boobs. She knew it wouldn’t be an issue considering Katie liked to show off her cleavage through her fashion. And who wouldn’t want bigger boobs?<br />
<br />
“Katie…” Mia, the adventurous one of the group started, “what’s going on with your chest?” She asked.<br />
Cassidy looked at Katie’s chest. They were definitely growing.<br />
“What the hell!?” Katie said loudly, covering herself up, “my boobs just grew…”<br />
“How can your boobs just… grow?” Ariel asked, pointing to her own breasts, “and teach me how to do it,”<br />
“No I’m serious,” Katie said, cupping her breasts in her hands, “they were not this big before,”<br />
“They look the same to me,” Cassidy said, “maybe you should make them bigger,” she joked, making her group laugh,<br />
“This is…” Katie was preoccupied, she was still in awe at what had just happened. She was absolutely sure her breasts had gotten bigger, and Cassidy knew she wasn’t lying,<br />
“Maybe it’s just your period?” Cassidy said, drawing the groups attention away from it.<br />
<br />
— — —<br />
<br />
Lunchtime continued as usual, people forgot about the whole situation. Everyone but Katie, of course. Lunch ended, and the group split apart as usual.<br />
<br />
Cassidy had a free period, along with her best friend, Ariel.<br />
Cassidy found Ariel talking to their friends, Jayla and Annie, who were both texting in the library (which was very much forbidden).</p>
