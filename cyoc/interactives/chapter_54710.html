<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>"That black one looks normal enough. I'll take that one."</br>
<br>"Ahh that is a good choice if I don't say so myself... which I just did." Dr. Furry says 
while chuckling at his own dumb joke.</br>
<br>"So... what about my dad? Are is he going to come in an get a check-up too?"</br>
<br>"Of course Ben. Why don't you have a seat on the chair next to the desk and I will go 
get him."</br>
<br>Ben slides off of the dentist's chair, while looking over the sample retainer and 
walking toward the chair. Ben wasn't sure about this whole thing, but his dad thought this 
place would be a good idea. Sitting in the chair, Ben noticed all the pictures of animals 
posted on the walls and even the ceiling. Something told him that there was more to this 
than simply trying to take the edge off of people's minds while being there. No matter who 
you are or how comfortable you are with things, there is no way you couldn't be a little 
cautious while at the dentist's office. Sitting there, Ben also wondered why or how it could 
be that all of his dad's friends came here, then were more muscular and such. It was even 
stranger to him that they ALL came out of the closet. He didn't feel any different and didn't 
think that that was going to change any time soon. Maybe it was because the dentist was a 
nice guy, listened to their wanting to come out for years and helped to convince them that 
they should while he worked on their teeth.</br>
<br>As Ben's thoughts started to get away from him, Ben heard the door creak open and 
watched as his dad and Dr. Furry came into the room. Ben's father looked at him and 
smiled.</br>
<br>"How was it Ben?"</br>
<br>"Fine dad! It was a bit strange at first, but now that things are done, I'm fine."</br>
<br>"That's good to hear. Alright, as soon as I get done here, we are going to continue 
with our plans for the day."</br>
<br>"Sounds good to me."</br>
<br>During the conversation, Ben smiled and noticed that the dentist had smiled a few 
times listening to the heartfelt conversation between a father and his son.</br>
<br>"Alright Nate, let's take a look in your mouth and see what is going on in 
there."</br>
<br>Dr. Furry turns on his light, Nate clenches his eyes shut for a second, trying to adjust 
to the brightness. Using his tools, Dr. Furry props Nate's mouth open and tinkers around. A 
dental scrape here, a pick there and a flinch or two from Nate and it is all over, as quick as 
it began.</br>
<br>"Looks like you and your son have a lot in common. You also have crooked teeth, 
which will need a retainer as well."</br>
<br>"You mean neither of us need braces? We can just wear the retainers and be 
good?"</br>
<br>"Yes... that is correct. You see, our retainers are special. You put them in your mouth, 
it stays on for twenty hours or so, and depending on how much change there is, you may 
not have to wear it for long. However, if the change to straighten those teeth take longer, 
well... you'll just have to wear them for more than the typical day or two."</br>
<br>"Wow... that is great news. You really are a great doctor like my friends told 
me."</br>
<br>"Why thank you Nate. Now, why don't you pick out a pattern or a color like Ben here 
and we will get those to you in short order?"</br>
<br>The Dr. points toward the tray and Nate peers into it, deciding about which one he 
wanted.</br>
<br>"How about the two toned dark and medium brown one, where the lighter color is in 
the middle and both colors take up equal space?"</br>
<br>"Oh, that is a wonderful choice. Just as good as your son took Nate!"</br>
<br>"Well... we do have similar tastes."</br>
<br>"Alright, well you two just stay where you are and I will be back with your retainers 
shortly." Dr. Furry said as he was about to leave the room.</br>
<br> "This is great news Ben! We are going to have our teeth fixed in no time, not to 
mention, we don't have to wait for a week to get braces and then a retainer after."</br>
<br>"Yeah, I think it's great too dad... but don't you think that it is a bit strange that he is 
just going to go in the back, get the retainers and give them to us?"</br>
<br>"No... not really. Before coming here, I did a bit of research and found out that they 
have these new form fitting retainers that go in your mouth, fit to how your teeth are and 
then contract forcing your teeth to straighten."</br>
<br>"Oh... cool! I didn't know they had something like that."</br>
<br>"Yep, it's pretty new and experimental..."</br>
<br>As Nate was talking, the Dr. walked in and overheard what Nate had said, while he 
had a couple of plastic containers in his hands.</br>
<br>"Oh... so you have done a bit of research have you? Yes, the retainers are very new, in 
fact they were just released for clinical use a few weeks ago, which is exactly what your 
friends were given Nate. So... tell me, are you ok with having clinical trials used on you and 
your son?"</br>
<br>"Yes Dr. I am... especially with the results I have seen with my friends."</br>
<br>"Good... now here are your retainers." Dr. Furry said while he outstretched his hands 
with the containers in them.</br>
<br>Nate looked at Dr. Furry, then the containers and took the containers. Nate opened 
one of them and saw that it was the midnight black color, which was the one his son 
chose.</br>
<br>"Come on over here son, let's make sure everything is in good order before we go, 
then I will make sure mine is good as well!" Nate said as he got up from the chair, handing 
the container to Ben.</br>
<br>As Ben walked over to his dad and slipped into the chair, he grabbed the retainer and 
put it in the roof of his mouth. At first, it felt huge and awkward for it to even be in there, 
but before he knew it, it felt as if nothing was there at all. He felt around for it with the tip 
of his tongue and couldn't even feel a seam. It was like it fused with his mouth instantly, 
but Ben knew that the foreign object was there, in his mouth.</br>
<br>"Alright Ben, let me take a look in your mouth and see how well it is working."</br>
<br>As directed, Ben opened his mouth and as the doctor expected, the retainer took to 
Ben's mouth instantly.</br>
<br>"Good... good, everything is in order then. Tell me... how do you feel Ben?"</br>
<br>"I feel fine, in fact... I feel better than fine... I feel great!"</br>
<br>"Good and your teeth are looking different already. Why don't you go take a look in 
the mirror."</br>
<br>Ben got up and hurried over to the mirror and what he saw in his reflection astounded 
him. His teeth were already slightly straighter and they looked better than they ever had. In 
fact, to his surprise, his k-9s were slightly longer and sharper. This made him very happy 
since he always wanted his teeth to be better than what they were since he usually had a 
hard time eating steak, no matter how it was cooked.</br>
<br>"Nate... it is your turn now. Your teeth were in slightly better condition than your 
son's, so you should see even more improvements as quick as Ben did."</br>
<br>Nate smiled while sitting in the chair and putting his two toned brown retainer in his 
mouth. Just as quickly as Ben noticed, the retainer felt as if it wasn't even there. When Dr. 
Furry peered into Nate's mouth as well, his results were the same.</br>
<br>"Looks good to me. Why don't you go and join your son in the mirror and check 
yourself out."</br>
<br>Complying, Nate rushed over to the mirror and barred his teeth. Not only was Nate's 
k-9s sharper and longer than Ben's, he noticed that he already had a slight bit of dark 
brown scruff on his face.</br>
<br>"Hmm... it looks like I didn't shave quite as close as I thought this morning. Oh well... 
no big deal. Guys look more attractive with facial hair than being smooth and clean 
shaven... isn't that right Ben?"</br>
<br>"Absolutely Nate, I don't like men without facial hair, makes them look young and 
feminine. Guys should be guys and real men wear facial hair."</br>
<br>"I couldn't agree more with you Ben."</br>
<br>"Alright, looks like you two are going to do just fine with those retainers! Why don't 
you go to the front desk and make yourselves an appointment for a check up in a week 
from today?"</br>
<br>"Sounds good Doc, you take care! After we make the appointment, Ben and I are 
going out for steaks!" Nate finished as he and Ben licked their chops at the thought of juicy 
steak being torn into with their new and improved teeth.</br>
<br>"You too." Dr. Furry said while he was thinking <em>Looks like they immediately 
went from father and son to two guys not related to one another. Well... chalk up another 
two to our line of special retainers.</em></br></p>
