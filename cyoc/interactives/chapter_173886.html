<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam’s whole world was foggy, like he was in a dream but where was he…he couldn’t remember. The last thing he remembered was pain and darkness as he held the women he loves close as they sank deeper into darkness of the water.<br />
<br />
The water…they had been attacked by something…more than one somethings. An image of a large white creature with a massive mouth and tail fins filled his mind. He remembered it biting Taylor almost in half and himself as well. If that happened, then how was he alive. <br />
He opened his eyes and closed them again, there was a strange bluish light coming from above him. He turned away from it and tried to open his eyes again, this time they stayed open for more than a moment as he saw a stone wall cut with what looked to be some kind of writing on it. He closed his eyes again, as more feeling came to his body. His body hurt…hurt like a mother but he began to try to move his fingers and toes. He moved his fingers with ease but with his toes it felt very strange, he felt movement, but it was strange. He raised his head up and looked down, his chest was bare, but he could see that where his legs were supposed to begin instead he saw that strange white creature was still biting into his body. <br />
<br />
His heart rate shot up as his world began to spin, somehow, he managed to avoid passing out. As he did he noticed he wasn’t in pain and there was no blood in the water. The water…he did feel weight on his body as if he was under water, but he was breathing…the two together where impossible. He sat up his head almost hitting a stone block over his head. He steadied his heart and looked at himself, the creature was attached to his body at the hip but it wasn’t moving. <br />
<br />
He reached down to try to pry it off but when he touched the spot where the creatures mouth attached to his flesh he felt his hands on both sides. He pulled back and touched the white scales of the creature…and he felt his hand on it. <br />
<br />
“Impossible.” Said Sam as he tried to move his feet again, only the creature responded moving parts he thought of. It was if, he was now controlling the creature. The only thing that came to his mind was mermaid or in his case merman. He swung on his but bringing the creature out over a void. That is when he began to look around the room, it was pentagon shaped with two doors across from each other and bunks on the remaining walls. One of the doors was closed, the other opened, he looked down to see a mosaic title floor in random shapes, on the ceiling was a large orb which gave off that strange light. <br />
<br />
As he looked around the room, there where other figures on slabs nearby but most of the slabs appeared empty. His eyes widened as he stopped Taylor lying on the slab next to him, for a moment he worried she was dead but her chest was rising up and down but like him, she had one of these creatures attached to her at the waste. He grabbed onto the stone slab and pushed off not moving his legs as he tried to hold himself in place. To his amazement, that was easy and he seamed to just float, he risked letting one arm go and then another but he remained floating in his place. He tried to move his right foot only to have his whole lower half give a kick which sent him flying upwards. He stopped himself by moving his arms.<br />
<br />
“Ok…if I am in water then move like I am swimming underwater.” Said Sam, as he tried to figure out how to move instead of everything else which was impossible. It took a few moments but he eventually reached Taylor’s side. He moved up to her, she was slightly different, a strand of her blonde hair was somehow even brighter almost to the point of bright gold. <br />
<br />
“Taylor…Taylor…Taylor.” He said shaking her a bit as her blue eyes began to open a bit. She turned and looked at him and gave a smile.<br />
<br />
“Sam…I just had the most fucked up dream.” Said Taylor<br />
<br />
“Well…it wasn’t a dream.” Answered Sam as Taylor took a few minutes and looked around, when she saw her tail she let out a scream and tried to pull it off. <br />
<br />
“Ah…your up.” Said a voice as both Sam and Taylor looked toward the door to see a woman in her mid to late 50s but one who clearly didn’t care about showing skin. She had the look of a party girl who never really gave up the party even in her older age. Her large brown eyes looked out at the two of them, her dirty blonde hair was pulled into three pony tails, two large ones on the side which ran down in front of her ears and a longer pony tail which was pulled up and back. Her chest had to be at least double Ds and was held back in a tiny deep purple top which showed a lot of skin. However, it was her lower half which caused both of them to look in amazement. Instead of legs, it was a fish tail with small side fins attached to her hips. The tail was a rich purple and grey. <br />
<br />
“Who…what are you?” inquired Sam as the women let out a sigh. <br />
<br />
“I am a mermaid…just like you are…well soon to be anyone.” Answered the women, before her eyes looked toward Sam. “You are becoming a merman, just like all your friends. Most of them will wake up in about a day or so. They started their transformation after you.”<br />
<br />
“What….?” Inquired Sam<br />
<br />
“I’ll explain more once everyone of your friends is up, until then I’ll give you the basics, you are becoming merfolk, the creature which is joined with you is merging with you. In time it’s will be you and the white scales will add color, fins and other stuff will grow in as well.” Stated the women “You may see other changes as well…your girlfriend is an example, that golden blonde hair strain will likely become her full color. Other changes range from eye color to muscles and chest size. In the mean time relax, get sleep and eat you are burning though energy.”<br />
<br />
As if on que four merfolk swam in behind her pulling/pushing a large chart of some kind. They rested it on the floor of the chamber and opened it up to show a large amount of food. Some of the food was stuff they recognized, fish, squids and the like but the other looked to be pieces of rock and what looked to be a milkshake like drink which sat in multiple bottles. One of them a merman with a silver tail and long black hair poured the thicker liquid into a glass and then drank it. <br />
<br />
“It taste like water would on land, something about the consistency makes it able to be put into a glass even under water.” Explained the merman “It took me a while to understand that, so I thought I would show you.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks…I guess.” Said Sam<br />
<br />
“Now…listen up here you.” Yelled Taylor as she tried to kick her way over to the mermaid who seamed to be in charge, she end up going sideways a bit. <br />
<br />
“You need to kick as if your legs are bound together which they are.” Said the busty mermaid “It will get easier when your leg bones fuse together into a single large limb. Not all the changes happen at once, it should take between 5 to 10 days for the changes to fully happen. The next phase for you all will be your gills coming in and then your scales should begin to come in around the same time.”<br />
<br />
“Gills?” inquired Taylor as the mermaid rolled her eyes.<br />
<br />
“You are breathing right now and you are underwater, right now all the water you take in goes down to the creatures gills and then out. Once your lungs are reformed your gills will move up to their proper place.” Explained the mermaid as she turned to show her side and pointed to a patch of scales on her side, just below the breast line. The mermaid took a deep breath as the slits opened up and some water flowed out. <br />
<br />
“My God.” said Taylor as she looked to her side and saw that it was red and some of the flesh now had flaps on it. <br />
<br />
“Get some rest, your next two friends.” Said the mermaid as she pointed toward a pair of slabs where Mike and Stacy lied should be up in a few hours, the rest in about a day or so. Before they could say much more the merpeople turned and swam out leaving Sam and Taylor alone in the room with a bunch of passed out people. <br />
<br />
“What…what do we do?” inquired Taylor<br />
<br />
What they did was swim around the chamber and the bathroom chamber which was strange just by itself trying to find a way to get out. All the walls where solid stone, with only a few vents spread out around the room letting water flow in an out. The vents where small only about the size of Sam’s arm and covered with a thick mess which was fused to the stone. <br />
<br />
“It is hopeless.” cried Taylor as Sam pulled her close as she began to cry, even as his own heart began to break. If this was true he would never see his family again, as he thought about that he realized he didn’t really care about his cold family but he missed his other friends and Taylor’s family was amazing, he would miss them more then more then his own family. He held her close, his hand going through her blonde hair, it was slowly turning into a brighter shade of blonde. He never admitted it right now but he liked the color of her hair. <br />
<br />
“It will be alright.” Lied Sam, he had no idea what would be in their future, but he had to say it.<br />
<br />
“I hope.” Said Taylor as she pulled back and whipped the tears from her eyes, she then looked up at Sam and stopped for a moment. <br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Sam worried<br />
<br />
“Your eyes have changed color; they are red now.” Stated Taylor as Sam let out a sigh. With everything going on, he now had a tail, he was breathing underwater and more changes where coming. So having red eyes was nothing for him to worry about right now. <br />
<br />
“I always liked red.” stated Sam as suddenly a scream filled the air or rather water as both turned to see that Mike was awake and Stacy was waking up. “Well lets go help them out, maybe their brains can figure something out.”</p>
