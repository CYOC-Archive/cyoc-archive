<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the almighty palm-piolet in hand, Drake was now lacking of ideas about what to do. It was too much power for a simple guy who wasn&#39;t even creative when is choosing his meals. So, he made the most common first change a guy could think of, improving his own body.<br />
<br />
First, he wanted to be taller, only a few inches, but that was enough to don&#39;t be considered a small guy. Then he increased his muscle mass, he wanted to disappear any traces of fat on him, while adding some muscles into his arms, legs and chest. He now looked fit with visible pecs, abs and biceps. He flexed his newly got muscles for a moment until he felt satisfied.<br />
<br />
Then he thought about his body hair, he doesn&#39;t like it too much so he made himself naturally hairless on his torso, back, arms, legs, etc. He smiled a little while he watched the bushes under his armpits vanishing into nothing. The same about his pubic area. Now he felt clean and handsome, but he needed to change one more thing.<br />
<br />
He moaned a little when he felt his dick elongating a few inches. At the same time, he was holding his balls with a hand and feeling them swelling a little to match his penis&#39;s new size. He was sporting a decent manhood which proudly swayed between his legs while a foreskin regrowth around it&#39;s glans.<br />
<br />
Now that he was done, Drake left his palm-piolet on his desk while he went to check his new self in the bathroom&#39;s mirror. He new that his roommate won&#39;t be there for a while, so he confidently walked around their apartment naked. However, he didn&#39;t know that Ethan, his roommate, had never left their apartment and was taking a nap in his bedroom, right next to Drake&#39;s.<br />
<br />
After having an horrible nightmare about his little brother being beaten by his stepfather, Ethan suddenly woke up sweating and panting, he was a bit superstitious, so he immediately texted his little brother asking if he was ok, what he was doing and where was their stepfather. After a few minutes, he got an answer from Andy who told him he was ok and he didn&#39;t have to worry because their stepfather was away for the weekend.<br />
<br />
Ethan felt more relieved after reading that, but he wasn&#39;t completely calm. He stood up from his bed and immediately took off his clothes who were damped in sweat. He sniffed his pits and realized he needed a shower, so he took a towel, clean clothing, his soap and... He noticed he doesn&#39;t have shampoo, so he decided to take a little from Drake&#39;s. He entered into his roommate&#39;s bedroom and while he looked for the shampoo he noticed something else.<br />
<br />
An old fashioned palm-piolet was on Drake&#39;s desk. He hadn&#39;t seen one of those in a long time, he even thought they had ceased of existing, so he was a little bit curious about it and took a closer look. It was turned on, so Ethan immediately noticed what Drake had recently wrote on it. He didn&#39;t expect his friend had wrote something too explicit like his genital size or his amount of body hair, but that was what it&#39;s written in the palm-piolet.<br />
<br />
While Ethan was watching the device, Drake came back to his room and immediately noticed that his roommate was there with his Magic palm-piolet in hand. As he wasn&#39;t very smart, the first thing he said was asking if Ethan had wrote something to change. Of course, Ethan didn&#39;t, but more importantly, he was completely astounded of seeing his roommate totally different from how he reminded him.<br />
<br />
Drake was taller, stronger and even hairless! Without mention it was the first time Ethan watched Drake&#39;s dick and it looked huge! He knew that something was happening and immediately related it to Drake&#39;s question about the palm-piolet in his hands. He read again what was written on it and noticed that Drake now looked exactly like the description in the device.<br />
<br />
Or Drake had paid for surgeries to get that body, which was unlikely because both of them were broke, or that palm-piolet had some kind of magic to transform him into that. Ethan was superstitious and easily believed in supernatural and magic stuff, so he obviously thought more about the second option. To prove his theory and with all the power in hand, he immediately wrote on it that the world and everything would freeze except for him.<br />
<br />
When he looked at Drake again, he noticed that his friend was completely immobile like an statue, the black hair on his head was impossibly suspended in mid air while he tried to approach Ethan to take his palm-piolet back. Ethan had a big smile from ear to ear, the device was truly magic and now he can do anything he wants with it!<br />
<br />
First, despite it looks interesting, a palm-piolet was too old for his modern tastes. So, he changed into a phone, then he decided it would be better if it was just on app on his actual phone. That will bring him some extra security in case someone else got it by accident. Then he made sure Drake forget about what happened, he was still his friend, so Ethan decided to let him keep his actual physique except for the body hair, because it would be weird if he didn&#39;t grow any hair on his skin.<br />
<br />
When Drake recovered the bushes on his pits and crotch, Ethan decided to dress him. A tank top, shorts and flip-flops appeared on Drake&#39;s body. Then, he left Ethan&#39;s room and made the world and everyone to move again. He knocked at Drake&#39;s door and when he came in he noticed that his friend was now making some exercise. It was logic if he now has that body. Then, Ethan returned to his bedroom and wondered what will be his next move.</p>
