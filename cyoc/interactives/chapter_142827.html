<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as he was wondering what to do, another car pulled up outside. Before he could so much as think of what to do, the door opened and his childhood friend revealed himself. Aaron, we&#39;ll call him, was a good friend to him when he was younger. He was the skinny, awkward nerdy kid to Markus&#39;s heavy awkward nerdy kid. They always played games and hung out, sleeping over eachother&#39;s houses... Aaron was pretty frail and small, a pasty ginger kid with freckles and slight buck teeth. He wasn&#39;t exactly an attractive guy, let&#39;s just say that, but he wasn&#39;t completely ugly either. As Aaron walked in, Markus instinctually reached for his phone, going to select him and set his mental settings so he wouldn&#39;t freak out...but he noticed something weird. Aaron had never really had many girlfriends, or really gotten serious with them either, but the Chronivac said he was...well, he was gay. That aside, he didn&#39;t want to be a man. &quot;Closeted Transwoman&quot; was the terminology the Chronivac used. Markus was shocked for a moment, but an idea came to mind. He made sure to leave Aaron&#39;s awareness on let him stroll into the room. Looking around, he saw his parents, who turned to greet him and give him a smile and hugs, but the whole time Aaron couldn&#39;t help but stare at Markus...sitting on his parent&#39;s couch with his dick out, and his sister kneeling beside him. &quot;What the fuck is going on?&quot; Aaron said, looking confused and maybe a little flustered. &quot;Markus came to visit, Aaron! Isn&#39;t that great!&quot; his mom said, going to sit back down. &quot;Right, but why is his dick out?&quot; Aaron said, his face turning a little red as he looked around the room, especially confused as he saw Chelsea&#39;s boyfriend. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s fine, your sister was just sucking it a little.&quot; His mom said, as if that was no big deal. Aaron looked shocked, stammering for a moment before he just looked at Markus and said &quot;The hell is going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Aaron, something really awesome happened and I think I might be able to help you.&quot; Markus said, his smirk back as he dick twitched a little, starting to get hard again. Aaron looked confused, his face reddening more as he saw Markus&#39;s dick get hard. &quot;W-What do you mean?&quot; He asked, looking away. &quot;Well,&quot; Markus continued &quot;I know you&#39;re gay, don&#39;t bother wondering how, and I also know you want to be a woman. I can help make that happen.&quot; Naturally, Aaron looked at him in disbelief and said &quot;No I&#39;m not, and no I don&#39;t...and no you can&#39;t. Put your dick away, man.&quot; Markus shook his head and looked down at his phone, saying &quot;Give me just a second.&quot; Aaron shrugged and leaned against the doorway..but started to slide down a little. As if he was getting shorter. His hair, though...his curly ginger hair started to get longer and drape down his shoulders...which also started to get smaller. &quot;Wha-...What are you doing?!&quot; Aaron said, not exactly angry, but still shocked as his body shifted. &quot;Not much...Erin. That&#39;s spelling E-R-I-N now, by the way. Since you&#39;re gonna be a woman, and all.&quot; Markus said, chuckling to himself as he watched his old friend turn from a nerdy, lanky white guy into an honestly fairly attractive woman. His once skinny and boney chest started to puff out, breasts beginning to form. They&#39;d stop at a modest B-Cup, but still more than he&#39;d certainly had before. Aaron/Erin didn&#39;t hesitate, pulling down his own pants and looking at his own cock. It&#39;d slowly start to decrease in size, and that was probably for the best...he hadn&#39;t been packing a whole lot to begin with. &quot;Definitely meant to have been born a woman, man.&quot; Markus said, looking at Aaron/Erin as he hips widened and her balls shrunk back into her body. &quot;Aaaaah....&quot; was all Aaron/Erin could get out as his voice climbed a few octaves. <br />
<br />
The process was over shortly after that, all of Aaron&#39;s clothes falling from his now feminine form. His shirt was all that remained, hanging from his new form. &quot;Well, hate to get to the point here, but you&#39;re fucking hot, man.&quot; Markus said, his cock rock hard again, staring at his once-friend. Aaron...now Erin...just stared at herself as she ran her hands across her new body. &quot;Dude, this is insane.&quot; she said, gingerly playing with her pussy lips. &quot;Yeah, that it is...&quot; Markus said, his cock twitching a few times as he ran his eyes across his friend&#39;s new body. &quot;Wanna test it out?&quot; Erin looked at him, still confused, but her eyes fell to his cock and a new heat started inbetween her legs. Despite this, she looked to her parents and her sister and said &quot;Not in front of them. It&#39;s just...weird, man.&quot; Markus smiled, chuckling as he said &quot;I can fix that.&quot; and played with something on the phone. &quot;There,&quot; he continued &quot;now you won&#39;t be so shy about it.&quot; Erin blinked as something clicked in her mind, as she said &quot;Oh fuck yeah, this is gonna be hot.&quot; and immediately lunged for Markus&#39;s cock. The new redheaded woman immediately set to work stroking his cock with one hand, and licking the head with her new tongue. Her deep brown eyes stared into Markus&#39;s as she took half of it in her mouth and began to bob up and down. &quot;Still tastes like my sister.&quot; Erin said as she came up for air. Markus blinked, a little shocked and said &quot;Damn, you&#39;re a little freaky, huh?&quot; with a teasing smile. Erin just winked and stood up, moving onto Markus&#39;s lap as she hovered her new pussy right over his rock hard cock. &quot;Time to lose my virginity, then.&quot; She said deviously before plunging his cock deep into her, immediately moaning as the waves of pleasure from it hit her. &quot;H-Holy f-fuck....&quot; was all she managed to get out before Markus started to thrust. &quot;A-Ah...w-wow....&quot; she continued, all other attempts to talk just mere noises and moans as Markus thrust his cock into the new woman, the same woman that was once his best friend. <br />
<br />
Markus took Erin and turned her, picking her up with his new muscular form and placing her face into the couch with one hand as he held her waist up with the other. He thrust hard into her from behind, sending a loud scream of pleasure from Erin as he fucked her doggy-style. In and out, in and out, a moan accompanying each powerful thrust before Erin came from her first orgasm as a woman, letting out a long moan and a few laughs, smiling. The world, for Erin, could not have been more perfect now. Markus couldn&#39;t disagree, honestly. His own orgasm soon followed, and he didn&#39;t bother pulling out, cumming right into the new woman&#39;s womb and honestly hoping he impregnated her. Who better to raise a kid with than your best friend?</p>
