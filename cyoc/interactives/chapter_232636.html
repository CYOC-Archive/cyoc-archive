<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Bit of a wipe while I can&#39;t sleep. Will edit soon.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They only discussed their options for a moment, before a few short ideas emerged to the fore. I was just stunned, babbling inconsequential, moving closer to Anna. At some point she spotted me, shooting me a smile, as I presented my hands to her in prayer. I was panicking, heart thumping in my throat, a small amount of pee in my boxers.<br />
<br />
Somehow, she noticed it.<br />
<br />
“Ladies, that settles it.” She chuckled, putting her hands on my face. She must Have felt my shaking too, and heard my muttered pleas. “Pissy pants to puppy princess, what do you say?”<br />
<br />
I let out a groan of anguish, as muttered agreements filled the air. Tears rolled down my fave, and I let out one last verbalise request.<br />
<br />
“Please Anna, please, I am your…”<br />
<br />
“How about we do a ‘man&#39;s’ best friend?” Layla Interjected, already entering into the laptop.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t wanna be a man.” Anna chuckled. <br />
<br />
“Oh no, not like that, I have many, many ideas of how to do this.”<br />
<br />
Hayley hit enter at last, and with a jolt of tingling energy I fell from Anna&#39;s hands. I could feel the transformation starting, tried to scramble away, but by that point, it was far too late.<br />
<br />
It started on my cock. It was tingling with a pervasive low-arousal that came in spirts and waves, an unseen hand massaging my junk. I gasped, still trying to crawl away, but it seemed to pull in my energy, and each movement became laboured. Soon, my arms were shaking, and with a cheer from the girls my face fell into the carpet, ass in the air.<br />
<br />
It was radiating out slowly, even my asshole tingling, but it appeared the first act of the horror was to tackle my masculinity at it&#39;s core. I tried another plea, but it came out as a groan, as I felt the skin of my genitals contract, pushing back my cock. Groaning again, my head turned to the girls, but they were just sat there, casually touching each other.<br />
<br />
Despite everything, it was hot, but I wasn&#39;t getting traditionally aroused. My cock tried to harder, but it caused my cock and balls to shudder, a tension pushing it further in. I tried to avert my gaze, but it was in my head now, and I couldn&#39;t help but seem them, hands exploring each other, cock slipping into my abdomen. With a schlick, felt but not heard, it slipped away, balls plopping in left and right. <br />
<br />
It was good. Gross, but pleasurable, and yet my stomach turned over with horror and disgust. God it was happening. It was actually happening. I was actually…<br />
<br />
I felt it again, my cock, somewhere in there, moving. It was like it was stretching, or balling up, throbbing too, as my balls kinda spread out. I was in panic mode, grasping at the bald spot where my junk was with the last of my energy. I groaned “no, no, no” on impulses, the carpet beneath me wet with tears, as the change started to spread.<br />
<br />
There was A grinding sensation, the bones of my legs gnashing, stretching and flaring. I shudder through it, gasping as it radiated outwards, twisting my spine. I was gaining a female shape, that much was inescapable, but that was only the tip of the ice burg. As I moved, trying to shuffle away, it was like my head disconnected, like it came off. <br />
<br />
The panic was brief, and heady, my mind swirling with confusion. I let out a noise that sounded like a yelp, my heart sinking with realisation. Human didn&#39;t have much traction, cant really look up all the way, while dogs, they face forward. I nearly screamed, adrenaline filling me with energy, and at last I was able to support myself. Only now, as I tried to stand, my spine seems to fail, my head now had that of a dog&#39;s, while my back unable to support myself. <br />
<br />
I felt drunk. It was too surreal, my brain just passing into a mindless stupour, driven by desperate instinct. Crawling, I moved towards the door, only for my legs to fail now, the tingle taking over my locomotion.<br />
<br />
My arms and legs went together, and compared to the rest, their range was fast. My arms barely lost and length, as I stared on in horror. I had to move from one to the other, as bones and sinew burned and bent, shaping into two dog-like paws. Meanwhile, back there, my legs where crunching, scrunching, retreating as my feet too warped into paws. I still tried to rests, but my frantic kicking and shaking only seemed to confirm the change, making it miserably real as my four paws landed.<br />
<br />
The panicked motions translated into a bounce, a jump, and a brief sprint across the room, on my new four legs. Far from intentional, but it layered on the reality. I was starting to re-enter my own head, my new reality, no longer fighting it, no longer resisting. Tears began to flow, as minor changes popped and pricked onto my body. I could feel the end coming, tears flowing with ugly sobs and whines, as my face began to change. <br />
<br />
My earts had an itch to them, the tingling ruining my equilibrium, but it was a brief invasion. It seems to sparkle back to normal, as my face started pushing outwards. I sobbed louder, louder, teeth alien, then my flat tongue, my nose smushing into a distant brown blob, the tingle flowing back down. In it&#39;s wake golden fur sprouted On my face, and when it hit my hair it turned blonde, flopping into my vision. In a blink of an eye my back was covered, and as it hit my rear I felt my tail bone pop out one spine after the other. <br />
<br />
The tail, manifesting at last, gave a wag, before sliding between my legs. There wasn&#39;t any joy to keep it moving, as the fur flowed onto my belly. Rather than add to the scraggly male fur there it fizzled away, but in it&#39;s wake I felt my gut arrange itself, pushing, tingling now with six undeniable piques of pleasure. I shuddered, as a cluster of breasts emerged.<br />
<br />
It was hot now, and I had the small police of knowing it was nearly over. There was just one thing left. It was like a trickle, a bead of invisible moisture drawing down from my perineum  to where my cock was. My new vagina, at last, blossomed in it&#39;s wake.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
The girls, at some point, had stopped touching themselves outright. There was a look of shock on heir faces, as they looked at their creation, isolated in the middle of the room. It weapt, sobbing soberly, but they were awed at it, blown away by the craft of their imagination.<br />
<br />
Me.<br />
<br />
I could see myself. There was a floor-length mirror In one corner, and after all that panicking and fighting and crying I didn&#39;t have the ability to see past it, and the figure I became. <br />
<br />
Squint hard enough and what you might see is a woman, with a thick, curvy build, bent over, and covered in fur. My torso was mostly human, but for the six teats, and while my arms looked kinda human, especially in terms of thickness, they were very dog like. My back legs swept around, had human levels of plumpness, that cave me a rounded ass, and a jiggle to my stemp. That face, however, was more beast than human, my human eyes peering out from a sea of golden hair and fur.<br />
<br />
I had a Karen cut. It almost made me laugh. My hair was a bit more lesbian, but it was definitely on the Karen spectrum. I dusted it back with a paw, sitting down like a dog.<br />
<br />
“Arwe ywou satisfwied?” I choked, tears falling from my face.</p>
