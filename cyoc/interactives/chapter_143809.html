<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick smirked and waited for his teammates to get out of the locker room. He wanted to test out his powers or rather JAKE wanted to test out his powers. Rick realized the cute and handsome student coach, Coach Richards didn’t go over plans with the team yet and he’s still in his office. Rick grinned and sneaked into the office. He saw Coach Richards was changing his clothes before he goes out. It was hot outside and you gathered ectoplasm in Rick’s penis wondering if a clone will possess Coach Richards. <br />
Rick saw the student coach’s butt and inserted himself in while hugging him. Rick laughed and released the ectoplasm into Coach Richards. “Trust me you are going to love what going to happen to you” Rick said in an evil but handsome voice. Rick faced Coach Richards to him and kissed him on the lips.<br />
<br />
While Coach Richards was getting the possession, Rick (Jake) was telepathically putting the coach’s undies and shorts back up. Rick smirked and felt the coach’s body.  Jake plans to alter Rick and the coach’s brains or maybe merge them into one creating an older brother or make a new father with one of them by merging with his father. Still having the student coach’s hands on Rick’s shoulders, the new Coach Richards woke up and  looked at himself feeling his muscles. Jake went closer and check on him.<br />
<br />
Rick(Jake): Woah, this is so cool! How is the new body?<br />
Coach Richards: To  be honest with you Rick, I LOVE THIS FEELING! I wanna just cancel the practice and have more fun with you.  <br />
<br />
Coach Richards smirked and kisses Rick’s lips even though Jake is inhabiting the bodies. He went to the field and told the teammates to go home because he wasn’t feeling so well and Rick had to deal with something. <br />
<br />
Looking through Coach Richards memories, he has been best friends with Jake’s older brother. When the team all left, Coach Richards asked if Rick wanted a ride and meet Jake’s family. Jake as Rick nodded since he believed that his brother is already there. Coach Richards smirked and kisses Rick and walked him to his car. Jake wondered what would happen if he changed them up.<br />
<br />
Jake remembered his dad left the door open for him so he asked Coach to go to his brother’s room. He thinks his older brother and his dad and in the bathroom. He began to take of all Rick’s  clothes and Coach did too. After they made out (since Jake  was feeling like he was gay), he set the boys on the edge of his brother and father’s bed leaving their bodies. Their heads are dropped down like they are robots with no batteries.<br />
<br />
Jake turned into a slime form and went to his older brother and realized he worked out and looked handsomer than he last saw him. He was in the bath while Jake sneaks up on him. His older brother can not see where he went so Jake went to his legs then shot himself into his ass. Jake’s older brother, Liam grunted as he filled him up and then later smirks.<br />
<br />
Liam: Alright! Wow he looks better since I lost saw him! Wait until someone else has fun with you!<br />
Dad: Did you say something Liam?<br />
Liam: U-Uh No!<br />
<br />
Liam was having fun feeling his body and Jake wants to have more fun. He wants someone to shower with Liam. <br />
<br />
Jake came home as Coach Richards and Rick while Liam and Their Dad were about to shower.<br />
<br />
Jake had an idea to go across Liam’s bathroom to his dad who was undressing to go to his bathroom. Liam doesn’t know what to feel about their dad or know what <br />
their dad was hiding. Jake hopes he can help change Liam’s mind. So Jake splits himself in two and exits out of Liam’s butt.<br />
<br />
Their dad was undressing in front of his mirror. Just as he was going to his bathroom, Jake possessed him from behind.<br />
Jake made his dad smile and he went to Liam.<br />
Dad:It’s good to be in this body again! Time to have fun with Liam!<br />
<br />
Jake realized Rick was as tall as Liam and when he came home before Liam and their dad showered, Rick was standing like a life size doll in dad’s bathroom. <br />
<br />
Jake made his handsome dad smirk as he made him go to his bathroom.<br />
<br />
Dad (Jake): Well it’s nice to see you again! <br />
<br />
Jake made his dad feel Rick’s body with his hands and he put one hand behind Rick’s head and made his dad kiss the young man. Rick shivers as Jake and his dad goes into him and fills him up. Jake altered his dad’s memories so he help Liam out with him. Jake blacked out and opened Rick’s eyes again looking at his reflection. Rick has Dad’s scent as Jake wanted and he began to unclothe Rick. He didn’t realize his dad’s body disappeared.<br />
<br />
Rick smiles and went to Liam. Liam was passed out in his bathroom and Jake triggered the clone in him. Few seconds later, Liam woke up and Rick kissed Liam having Jake repossess his older brother. Jake’s powers made Rick act like his Dad and transfer himself  to Liam.  Liam gave a smirk but Jake thought if Coach Richards personality be in Liam or Liam’s Personality In Coach. <br />
<br />
Jake likes Dad as Rick but just then Jake heard Coach Richards has a phone call. <br />
Rick(dad): it’s ok son I will take care of Liam!<br />
Jake saw Liam asleep with Rick’s body carrying Liam to your room while you saw Coach Richards looking for his phone to answer and clothes. Assuming Coach<br />
Richards was still in Liam’s room, Jake saw the coach coming closer to him but the ringing phone and Coach Richards’ clothes were next to him.<br />
<br />
Jake dove into Coach Richards’ mouth and got swallowed. Later, Jake filled Coach up and answered his phone. He heard the captain of Rick’s team who happens to be the most popular guy in school. Jake answered he will be going there later and he had never been so excited in his life!<br />
<br />
Jake went to his room and saw Liam passed out nude on the bed. Jake used Coach Richards’ body to jump on Liam. Jake told “Rick” about the call while he inserted Coach Richards into Liam and transfers Coach Richards making Liam spazz and fill up. Jake watched Liam get up and laugh. <br />
<br />
Liam: That was the best new experience I’ve ever had!<br />
Rick: Now that we’ve changed let’s hurry to where Jake told me.<br />
Liam: woah I look better! Jake , we should use your powers and test new bodies out! <br />
<br />
Rick: I’ll go talk with him since the Coach is in you Liam!<br />
Liam: No problem dad! <br />
Rick then told Jake to possess him again and he got a plan. <br />
<br />
Rick’s team’s captain: Rick? <br />
Rick : Yes? Don’t mind me I just need to get some stuff!<br />
The captain: how are you and the coach feeling?<br />
Rick: still sick! We don’t know what exactly is wrong with us! <br />
The captain: Oh, I just came to ask Coach something! <br />
Rick: I can ask for you! What is it?<br />
The captain: Do you guys know when we will go back to practice? <br />
Rick: no but hey let’s go talk until he gets here?<br />
The captain: ok! <br />
Rick: why are you sad?<br />
The captain: oh nothing <br />
Rick: I’m sure I can help you or coach!<br />
The Captain: oh thanks...<br />
Rick: Well are you dating?<br />
The captain: No don’t have time to be with anyone cause I need to be great at school and football.<br />
<br />
Rick: Coach Richards’ office is open we can sit on the bed!<br />
Rick and the captain sat on the bed waiting for the Coach. Jake liked the Captain’s handsome eyes and he telepathically told Rick to lock the door and make out with him. <br />
<br />
Rick went to slam and lock the door. The captain jumped.<br />
Rick: we played ever since the beginning of middle school and I never got your name!<br />
The captain: Oh I’m Nathan! Why did you lock the door?<br />
<br />
Rick: Rick is not here anymore!  I have a person that really wants to feel what it’s like to be the most popular guy in school!<br />
Nathan: What does that mean? <br />
Rick went to grab Nathan by the collar and knowing it’s really his dad, Jake was like a snake slithering into Nathan. <br />
<br />
Nathan chokes up as Rick barfs Jake as the only thing Nathan can do was swallow. Jake fills Nathan. Surprisingly Nathan left his phone on assuming he was calling the cops. <br />
<br />
Rick: Great a new body is coming! <br />
<br />
Liam went to check and saw a handsome cop. Liam guides him to the two senior boys when really it’s Jake and his Father now. The cop was actually a college student in training but he is doing really well. He said Jake who now is inhabiting Nathan was saying he was attacked.<br />
<br />
Nathan: oh no officer, I’m fine.<br />
Jake was feeling gay and wanted to test his powers and have a boyfriend. <br />
Officer: Well, I was told to examine the room and your body for any bruises?<br />
<br />
Nathan: sure! But hurry!<br />
 The officer was going through Coach Richards Desk for weapons and thankfully for Jake his new body is the same height as the officer!  The officer scatter the desk but saw nothing then he looked behind Jake and on the floor.<br />
<br />
Officer: Ok so no weapons may I look at you now? Please take off your clothes but leave your underwear on. I’m sorry but it might make him uncomfortable to have people see him undress please leave us alone here. <br />
<br />
Rick and Liam left and they mouth to Nathan to get the officer possessed too. Nathan followed instructions as the officer locked the door and made sure no one interrupted the investigation. Nathan’s handsome body was shown and Jake made him grin. The officer asked him to turn facing the wall. Jake wanted to test his powers more and filled Nathan’s throat and penis.<br />
<br />
Officer: I’m Officer Jackson by the way, everything is good so far! <br />
The officer then told Jake to turn around. The police department  was looking for a new sheriff and they all wanted Jackson to be promoted. As Jackson went down, He looked straight and when he was about to say It’s all clear, Jake tripped on purpose putting Nathan’s penis in his mouth. It was very hot and Jackson  was thirsty.<br />
 <br />
Nathan made a face at Jackson reading his mind. Jackson is handsome and straight but he was shocked about what was going on.<br />
Jackson chokes and tries to call for the Deputy’s help on his walkie talkie but failed. Jackson was parched but Nathan released a clone of Jake into the Officer’s mouth. Still controlling Nathan, Jake telepathically took off Jackson’s police uniform shirt to show off his muscles and abs. Jackson was about to pass out from the heat and he helped the clone fill him up by sucking Nathan and drinking the clone. <br />
<br />
Knowing no one sees Nathan and Jackson, Jackson was still thirsty and Jake made Nathan finish releasing the clone by kissing the officer. Jackson keeps drinking then rest sitting on the bed. The clone was fixing himself in Jackson. Just as the clone fills Jackson, Rick and Liam were waiting at Jackson’s police car.  <br />
<br />
Jackson then had a headache and blinks. Nathan can tell that Jackson was being possessed now. Jackson smiled at Nathan then looked at his abs. He laughs and checks Nathan out and strips himself too. Nathan called Rick and told them he would go to their home soon.  <br />
<br />
Nathan: Are you done with what you gotta do Officer?<br />
Jackson: No, Not yet... we have something to do first! Since we are almost 20, I’m gonna give us what we want! <br />
 <br />
Jackson smirked at Nathan and strip off his pants and boxers. Nathan was shocked but didn’t care. He went with what the officer is doing. Jackson leaned and kissed Nathan’s lips and smiles. <br />
Jackson: Why not get better bodies like of celebrities?<br />
<br />
Nathan: maybe one of us first? Not both?<br />
Jackson agreed letting Nathan feel his body.<br />
Jackson mentioned that they need to sleep first.</p>
