<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All of the color drained from Phoebe&#39;s face at that explanation. This absurdly sexually developed girl was a futanari on top of everything else about her, from her chest to her hips to her candy pink lips. The comparatively plain new girl&#39;s mouth began to spill open with a half formed salad of words and flustered gibberish, attempting to ask every question she had on her mind all at once. Ricarda, for her part, handled the situation with saintly patience as she waited for the smaller girl to calm down.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re all done spazzing out like that,&quot; she said with a patient smile, &quot;do you maybe wanna try asking one or two of those... I think those were questions... again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I-I I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Phoebe gasped, &quot;It&#39;s just that, well, it shouldn&#39;t be biologically possible for someone to be a hermaphrodite in the way you are! N-not shouldn&#39;t as in say you <i>morally</i> shouldn&#39;t, more just scientifically, as I said! How and why are you a hermaphrodite?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had my second puberty shortly after getting transferred here,&quot; Ricarda replied simply, &quot;just like <i>you&#39;re</i> going to go through soon. Simple as that. Oh, and yes the correct word for the kind of hermaphrodite I am <i>is</i> futanari, so please use that word.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What all happens during second puberty?&quot; Phoebe asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you hit another growth spurt,&quot; Ricarda explained, &quot;that&#39;s what happens first. Next your clit starts growing and transforming into a penis, and while <i>that&#39;s</i> happening your hips and thighs fatten up. By then your scrotum begins growing and your testicles drop inside and start swelling. Then your mammary glands kick into gear and your boobs swell up like water balloons. If you&#39;re one of the lucky ones, or unlucky depending on how you see it, your tits start lactating by themselves no pregnancy necessary. That&#39;s all just the outside changes. On the inside your ovaries start producing more eggs, your anus becomes as sensitive as your vagina, and that&#39;s not even getting into the tsunami of hormones that overwhelms your everything all at once. A lot of girls going through it have this period where they just constantly climax from nothing but their hormones. On the bright side your brain evolves to the point you more than accept your new body, no more mensural periods, insane amounts of stamina, increased intelligence, luscious hair, and a far stronger immune system. That said, your virility goes through the roof and you start producing gallons of semen at a time. Remember to drain your balls in the morning to get rid of the buildup from when you were sleeping and such, otherwise you might bust for no reason in the middle of, say, running laps and turn the jogging trap into a safety hazard. Speaking from experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-so, I&#39;m going to turn into a crazy sexed up parody of myself?&quot; Phoebe gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t use the word parody when describing your new body,&quot; Ricarda sighed, &quot;That&#39;s really rude and insensitive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, it&#39;s just,&quot; Phoebe breathed, &quot;this is all just so much to take in first thing in the morning. I still have so many questions!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m gonna have to take a break from answering them,&quot; the class rep said, &quot;because here we are at Inari-sensei&#39;s office.&quot; The entry to the principal&#39;s office was a set of mahogany double doors, each with an intricately carved phallus on them and doorknobs that distinctly resembled the heads of cocks rendered in brass.<br />
<br />
&quot;A... little on the nose with the symbolism here, isn&#39;t she?&quot; Phoebe chuckled weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surprised me at first, too,&quot; Ricarda smiled as she opened the doors, &quot;She should be just inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Futaba Inari&#39;s office was about as ostentatious as the doors that opened into it. The walls were lined with futanari versions of classical statues such as David or Venus de Milo. Everything else was distinctly Japanese, from the bookshelves to the cabinets to the various knick-knacks she had on display. The room smelled lightly of lavender incense as well, and the golden lighting was just ever so slightly lowered. The seats before the desk were lined with plush velvet and were more comfortable than any chair she&#39;d ever sat in before. Of course, the room&#39;s décor, as extravagant as it was, might as well be minimalistic compared to the room&#39;s owner.<br />
<br />
This was the famous Futaba Inari herself. She was standing behind her desk when they walked in, presumably so that the new girl could take in the woman&#39;s incredible body. If Ricarda&#39;s over-sexualized frame was really quite absurd, Futaba&#39;s was absolutely preposterous, bordering on completely asinine... No... Her body was, quite frankly, absolute fucking horseshit! If Ricarda&#39;s breasts were the size of turkeys, Futaba&#39;s were in the territory of exercise balls, with coke-can nipples and protruding areola like dinner plates. The same could be said of the principal&#39;s buttocks and thighs, and the floor-sweeping waterfall of jet black hair that extended from her head. Of course, much like Ricarda&#39;s, Inari-sensei&#39;s face was comparatively plain and conservative next to the rest of her body. Not that Phoebe paid her face much attention, because her eyes were practically glued to the woman&#39;s crotch. Testicles the size of professional basketballs, squeezed tightly into a wrinkly, hairy scrotum accompanied the longest, thickest penis in the entire goddamn world. Phoebe saw every inch of this woman&#39;s body because, to her utter horror, the only thing she was wearing was an open purple kimono.<br />
<br />
&quot;I presume that you are my new student?&quot; the principal asked. Her voice carried with it the commanding aura of an emperor. Phoebe could only nod with a dead expression upon her sheet-pale face. &quot;Welcome to my school, young dear. Please sit. I&#39;m sure you must be a wellspring of questions.&quot; Phoebe hobbled into the chair in front of Inari-sensei, who sat down as well to remain as eye level with her as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-how a-are y-you s-so...&quot; Phoebe croaked, &quot;So... so... b-b-b... bi-ig...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yet again the first question from my new students&#39; mouth,&quot; Inari smiled, &quot;is how or why I&#39;m as endowed as I am. Based on your test scores at your old school I assume you must be referring to how someone as endowed as <i>I</i> am can exist when the square-cube law is in effect. There&#39;s no other way to say this, but I suspect it is because my genes are capable of ignoring physics and altering reality on a localized scale. In other words, the bumblebee&#39;s wings can lift its fat body because the bumblebee doesn&#39;t care about what others believe is impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Phoebe tried to answer, but all she could do was wheeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sensei,&quot; Ricarda inquired, &quot;was I really the same way as her the first time I met you? It&#39;s been so long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember you were <i>just</i> the same as our new friend here,&quot; Inari-sensei nodded, &quot;It&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of. So, my new young dear, what is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Phoebe... Alice,&quot; the new girl gasped, &quot;and I... I...,&quot; she drew a deep, shuddering breath, &quot;I don&#39;t belong here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way! Those were my exact same words when <i>I</i> was first in this office!&quot; Ricarda gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Phoebe,&quot; the principal said in a motherly lilt, &quot;look at me. I understand why you might feel this way. Trust me, I do. For one thing your body as it is now is nowhere near as obscenely profane as mine or Miss Johnson&#39;s. You don&#39;t have a penis, or even any curves. Puberty for you was all acne scaring, growing pains, and monthly bleeding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-how can you know what growing up was for me?&quot; Phoebe balked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because that was <i>our</i> first puberty,&quot; Ricarda explained, &quot;Believe it or not, I was as flat as <i>you</i> once upon a time. A-cups, no ass, even my hair was really thin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was until she transferred here to my school on Shaft Island,&quot; Futaba added, &quot;and before long she bloomed into her true body, and became a futanari woman. Trust me when I say that you wouldn&#39;t be here if you don&#39;t belong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you know?&quot; Phoebe asked, &quot;How can you be so sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have access to your school&#39;s medical records,&quot; the principal explained, &quot;and you have the genes for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why you were transferred here,&quot; Ricarda continued, &quot;because right now this is really the best place <i>for</i> women like us. Before you ask, you&#39;ll still be in contact with your family. You can video-call them and write letters and everything, and they can even come here for a visit, but you can&#39;t leave to visit <i>them</i> because the world at large just isn&#39;t ready to handle futanari.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A sad, unfortunate truth,&quot; Inari-sensei sighed, &quot;but one we hope to reverse one day... one day very, very soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not in any sinister way,&quot; Ricarda assured Phoebe, &quot;despite her wording.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Phoebe, I&#39;m sure you must have had a very long ride over,&quot; the principal said, &quot;so let&#39;s finish off this little meeting by going over your initial schedule and giving you your dorm room key. If you have any more questions, don&#39;t be afraid to ask.&quot;</p>
