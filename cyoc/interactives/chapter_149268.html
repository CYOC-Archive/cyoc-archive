<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>By CAIN</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A month later Oscar was settled into his new job as the personal training manager of Southtown AllTimes Fitness. As a 19 year old, he made quite a good paycheck, between his base salary and commission share for what his trainers brought into the club; he was able to afford a nice apartment under a mile from the gym, a new car, and lots of clothes that showed off his new body spectacularly. He would often jog or bike to and from work and then do another two hours of weights after his shift just to keep his body fit and growing. Turns out, working out came natural to him (though having a body like this handed to him didn’t hurt!) so he put on even more mass until he stopped growing at 6’4” and 265lbs with a 12” cock looking in his early 20s. Best of all, he continued to look about that age until his chronological age caught up a decade later, when he started to age normally. <br />
<br />
Oscar continued to perform cam shows in the evenings after work, where he would boss around his subscribers while he walked around shirtless and sweaty from the gym. It gave him a chance to get his rocks off, the only way he was able to anymore, as the experience was the only thing that made his hung cock swell and explode. He did some homework initially, looking up old videos of his own son and other alpha masters doing their shows – But much like with personal training and working out, he found being an alpha master came easily – especially with a body like he had now!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile David focused on his work as an IT manager at the local hospital. Being closer to 40 now, he tried his best to ignore his situation and the loss of his youth by keeping busy as much as he could. He took on extra shifts, worked on extra side projects, and for his efforts, he was recognized by the hospital director and promoted to Chief Technology Officer by the board of directors. Now he had enough money to buy a nice house out in the country and a newer car. But even with the financial and occupational stability he was unsatisfied with his life. <br />
<br />
He started to see a sex therapist, going over what he was experiencing, but leaving out the more unbelievable parts. He explained how physically he wanted to bottom very badly, and how he had done it only once before. But mentally it didn’t seem right, the last time he did it he became very traumatized and nauseous. When the therapist asked if topping was a possibility, he said no – it was impossible for him to get turned on enough to top anyone now, only bottoming turned him on sufficiently to reach sexual satisfaction. He explained that it had been over a month since the last time he came even, that just masturbating did nothing for him. The therapist offered a very simple and obvious solution: had he tried using a dildo or vibrator? That way, it’s safe, no need to worry about someone else, their emotions or any potential diseases. David was surprised he hadn’t thought of that! Later that evening, he picked out a dildo from the local sex shop that became his new nightly best friend, which looked oddly familiar and had the cheesy name of “Kevin Steel” on the package. There’s no way… Is there?<br />
<br />
The pair eventually did meet again a few months later. But the desire for sex between them was gone, knowing it would only cause them pain. Instead, they enjoyed a nice dinner at an Italian restaurant not too far from Oscar’s gym, talking about what they had been up to the last few months, and how their lives were going. Oscar was happy David got promoted and David was happy that Oscar was enjoying his new job. Oscar also convinced David to come in to his gym later that week and work out as an alternative to working so much – he would even recommend one of his best trainers, Trisha, to get him started. Oscar said David might never get as big as him (again) but even at his age, with the right program and nutrition, there’s no reason he can’t put on some good mass and look and feel better about himself. In the back of his mind, David wished Oscar would be the one to boss him around, force him to work out, and demand he grow and get more muscular just like his dad. But he simply smiled and said he would be there. They parted with a friendly hug and promised they would meet up every week to keep in touch.<br />
<br />
In the end, Madame Illusia did get her way – to an extent. Their sex lives were destroyed and practically non-existent. But deep down they realized it was better this way anyway, at least where the two of them were concerned. It was unfortunate that neither would ever be able to enjoy another man again the way they had once enjoyed one another. But they also realized that, in a way, things were better like this, and both of them were happier overall. And most importantly, they were able to reconnect as a family: a proud father (in a supremely built alpha teen god muscle body) and his loving son (in an almost 40 year old tech geek but working on becoming a muscle geek body).<br />
