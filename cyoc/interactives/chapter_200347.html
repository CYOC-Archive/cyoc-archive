<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Early the next day, around 5am, the CEO of the new airport arrives. He drives by the abandoned airport, like every morning he turns to look at the abandoned airfield, “I still don&#39;t understand, why would they build a new airport directly next to the old one instead of renovating or rebuilding the old one? It would have been much cheaper that way,” he says to himself. As he continues to drive along the road, he suddenly notices something poking out of between two run down hangers. As he comes closer, his eyes widen, “what the...? Why is a plane on the abandoned airfield,” he asks himself, “I am awaiting a plane, that I ordered a few months ago. What if the idiots just dumped it on the abandoned airfield and forgot to notify me?”<br />
<br />
The CEO decides to investigate, luckily he has all of the documents from the order on his phone, he could see if the serial numbers match and if not, heck he&#39;d get two planes for the price of one.<br />
<br />
Josh, the CEO, takes a detour and drives up to the gate of the abandoned airport, he is stopped by a security guard. “Good morning, sir,” the guard says in a bored but friendly tone, “how can I help you?”<br />
<br />
“Good morning,” Josh says, “I am the CEO of the new airport, I noticed something on the abandoned airport which I&#39;d need to check out.”<br />
<br />
“Oh? And what might that be,” the guard asks.<br />
<br />
“Well, you see, I ordered a plane for the new airport,” he says, “a Boeing 777-9, to be exact, and driving by the old airfield I noticed that a Boeing 777-9 is just standing in between two hangers.”<br />
<br />
The guard looks at Josh in disbelief, “oh, really,” he says, “I&#39;m sorry, but no one can just dump a brand new plane on this airfield without me or one of my colleges knowing.”<br />
<br />
“Listen,” Josh says, becoming irritated, “I swear I am telling the truth, there is really a plane on the field. I have no idea how it got there, but I need to check if it is the plane I ordered.”<br />
<br />
The security guard looks closely at Josh, he can tell that the CEO is serious, so he lets out a sigh, “fine,” he says, “but I AM coming with you.”<br />
<br />
Josh shrugs, “that&#39;ll be fine,” he says, so the guard opens the gates and Josh drives through, he then waits for the guard to close the gate and get into his Tesla. They then drive towards the area where Josh has seen the plane.<br />
<br />
“Nice car,” the guard says, “I am pretty jealous of people like you. You rich folks have a happy life, you can afford nice cars, houses and afford anything you desire. We “small” folks... we suffer... there are times where I can&#39;t pay bills. I am really desperate... I already work four jobs, all of which pay peanuts,” he stops and looks over at Josh, blushing a little. “Sorry... I don&#39;t know why I am telling you this,” he says, “as if you&#39;d care.”<br />
<br />
Josh sighs, “listen, mate,” he says, “I understand totally... a few years ago I had nothing. I worked hard to be where I am today. I want to get to the plane and get it off of this airfield, after that issue is settled, we&#39;ll talk.”<br />
<br />
The guard blinks, “what do you mean, “we&#39;ll talk”? What...,” he starts but is cut off by Josh as the CEO points.<br />
<br />
“There, I told you,” he says.<br />
<br />
The guard looks and his eyes widen, “you really did not BS me,” he says. Josh stops in front of the plane and both men get out, “how in heavens name is this possible,” the guard asks as they walk up to the “plane”.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t ask me, mate,” Josh replies, he already has his phone out.<br />
<br />
The guard walks around the plane with Josh, “it is a brand new plane, it doesn&#39;t even have official logo&#39;s,” he says, “if I ever find out who allowed some fool to dump a plane here...,” he then grumbles.<br />
<br />
“Mate... sorry, what is your name again,” Josh asks.<br />
<br />
“Oh... Dean,” the guard says.<br />
<br />
“Josh, nice to meet you,” the CEO replies, “let me check the order and if the numbers match it is the plane I ordered, and I&#39;ll be calling the manufacturer.”<br />
<br />
“And if it isn&#39;t,” Dean asks.<br />
<br />
“Then I&#39;ll still take it,” Josh says, “for one, it is not marked by any known plane company, for two, I can&#39;t leave such an amazing plane rotting here, for three, I&#39;d get two planes for the price of one and for four: It&#39;ll be out of your feet.”<br />
<br />
Dean watches as Josh walks around the “plane”, matching the aircraft with the data on his phone, both men unaware that the “plane” is actually a teenage boy. The guard decides that he&#39;d better let Josh do his thing, so he turns and walks back to Josh&#39;s car to wait.<br />
<br />
Josh continues to check the serial numbers and other details with the order documents on his phone, “hm... does not seem to be the plane I ordered,” he mumbles to himself, “there is one number left I have to check though. Not matter the outcome: I&#39;m taking the plane to where it belongs.”<br />
<br />
As Josh walks to the back of the “plane” he almost trips over something on the ground, he looks down and his eyebrows raise as he notices a pile of what appear to be clothes from a teenage boy. He kneels down and examines the clothes, “weird, why is there a pile of clothes laying in the dirt,” he asks himself. Josh shrugs, “I&#39;ll take the clothes with me,” he mutters, “they look okay, my son could probably make use of them,” as he picks the clothes up, he notices a phone fall out of the jeans. “A phone, I&#39;ll check through it when I am back in my office, or just give it to the “lost and found” department,” he says to himself, after checking the last number, which again does not match the order, Josh walks back to his car.<br />
<br />
“So,” Dean asks, “is it the plane you ordered?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Josh says with a sigh, “but I&#39;ll take it anyway. It is better off in one of my hangers. I&#39;ll put out a message, that way the rightful owner knows where to pick it up.”<br />
<br />
“What if no one comes forward,” Dean asks.<br />
<br />
Josh shrugs, “then I&#39;ll make use of it,” he says, “if no one claims it after a month, then I&#39;ll officially have it registered to the new airport.”<br />
<br />
Dean nods, then he notices the clothes in Josh&#39;s arms, he raises an eyebrow and tilts his head, “what is that,” he asks, pointing.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I found these clothes and phone next to the plane,” Josh says, “they don&#39;t look old, I doubt that a naked teen is running around. He probably changed clothes and left his phone... maybe he is a runaway and does not want to be found.”<br />
<br />
“Hm... yeah,” Dean says, “teens tend to run away.”<br />
<br />
Josh nods, “yeah, my son could use the clothes and I&#39;ll check the phone or just give it to the lost and found,” he says, “let me call my hanger crew, so that they can tow of the plane and bring it into a free hanger. While that happens, you and me, we need to talk in my office.”<br />
<br />
Dean is about to ask why, but Josh has already gotten into the car and soon they both drive off to the new airport to have a talk, leaving the “plane” to get picked up by a airport tow truck, Jeff continues to sleep and is unaware of what has happened.</p>
