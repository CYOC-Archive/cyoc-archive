<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tiger finished applying his cologne. His bro Chris was having a party across the hall and he was hoping to leave with someone by the end of it.<br />
Tiger was a rather tall, heavy-built man, with a broad chest and pecs you could bounce a penny off. His hips were narrow, giving him an almost cartoonishly idealised body-shape. Of course, Tiger had been practicing magic for a while now and being so in to his own looks spent a lot of time toning and shaping this body with magic. Why work out when you can brew a potion or say a magic word? Tiger had spent most of time focussing on shape-altering magic, mastering only that which served his desires. While Chris could turn himself and others into inanimate objects, Tiger had learned to change his physique in all kinds of ways. He thought got his nickname because he often wore a lot of tiger-stripe patterned clothes. Right now, in fact, he was wearing a tiger-striped thong under his jeans, and a tiger-striped jacket over his white shirt.  In reality, however, he got his nickname when Chris discovered that he was a closet furry. Tiger sometimes gave himself a muzzle and covered his ripped body in orange fur with black stripes, grew himself a tail, and switched his ears to a more pointed variety. Only behind closed doors, of course. While  were-creatures were common to the school, Tiger still felt kind of awkward for being a human who liked to make himself into an anthropomorphic animal willingly. He was sure people would mock him for it if they found out, so he never did it in public. He even made fun of one student for being a variety werewolf that simply looked like an anthropomorphic wolf with full sapience. <br />
<br />
Tiger checked himself out in the mirror one last time, before heading over to Chris’s dorm room. He knocked on the door, knowing he was quite early. He figured it’d be better to help his buddy set up the party than to spend the next half-hour preening further. He didn’t want to go beyond perfection and have to start again. <br />
Chris didn’t answer immediately, but Tiger could hear what sounded like a chair being dragged across the laminate floor so he figured he was busy. Chris called for him to come in after apparently finishing the relocating of the chair. When Tiger stepped inside, he noticed Chris had barely prepared anything. There were chips and dip, but no drinks or anything. There was a three-seater sofa, a bed, and three chairs to sit on. Two of the chairs were standard-issue wooden chairs, while the third was a fancy-looking metallic affair with comfortable-looking brown padding. <br />
Chris looked delighted to see Tiger, more than he had ever been before, ‘Yo, Tiger, good t’see ya!’<br />
‘Chris, bro, you invited, like, the entire class and you’ve barely got anything ready,’ Tiger approached his friend, ‘you need to at least get some drinks up in here!’<br />
‘Y’ain’t gotta be worrying about drinks,’ Chris replied, patting Tiger on the shoulder.<br />
‘Oh, I see,’ Tiger winked and nudged Chris in the side, ‘You managed to steal the enchanted keg, right? That’s always refilling. Boy, Sean’ll be pissed! But you still need to get some furniture in here, man.’<br />
Chris smirked, and laughed a little. If Tiger wasn’t so oblivious, he might have noticed the seat of the chair behind him push out and make strange wriggling movements as if it was trying to talk.<br />
‘No, no, bro, I said you ain’t gotta worry about drinks,’ Chris put emphasis on the word “you”, ‘and I got the furniture problem sorted.’<br />
Suddenly, Tiger found himself rooted to the spot. Chris muttered an enchantment before stroking his hands down Tiger’s sides. A wave of energy followed Chris’ hands, causing Tiger’s body to tingle pleasantly. The large man’s duds started to knit together before getting snug. Tiger could only look down at himself as his clothes went from snug, to skin-tight, before completely merging to his skin.  By the time they were done, he looked like he was wearing a tiger-stripe sentai suit. He was horrified, not because he was frozen in place and being transformed, but because this meant that his groin was left completely smooth as his pants became part of him. <br />
Chris chuckled, ‘Don’t look so upset, Tiger, you’ll like this next part.’<br />
Chris marked out a shape in the air. Tiger recognised this spell – it was the spell to reveal someone’s innerself. It was used to make people resemble how they felt inside. Tiger felt his face bulge outwards, his ears point, a pain at the base of his spine where a tail was pushing out of his backside... The clothing that was now part of him became fur, covering everything below his neck before spreading upwards and covering his head, merging with his hair. He was now an anthropomorphic tiger, and still an Adonis at that. He could have auditioned for a role as one of the dancers in a certain 2016 Disney movie! <br />
‘I keep telling ya,’ Chris reached out and stroked Tiger’s furry chest, ‘Nobody would make fun of you if you just let out your innerself more often.’<br />
Tiger blushed, then frowned. ‘What are you buttering me up for?’ <br />
‘Like I said, I got the furniture problem sorted,’ Chris nodded, still stroking the chest of the magically restrained tiger, ‘And I don’t want you to stay too mad at me after the party is over.’<br />
Tiger frowned tighter, then his eyes shot open as he realised what Chris was getting at. ‘Oh no, no you don’t, Chris, I was hoping to take home a fuckbuddy tonight!’<br />
Chris sighed and kissed Tiger’s broad chest, ‘That might still happen, you know. Now hush up.’<br />
Chris rubbed his thumb along Tiger’s mouth. Tiger flinched, then let out a muffled grunt. His mouth had been completely smoothed over! The way Chris could manipulate bodies like putty gave Tiger the creeps and he had never let Chris use it on him outside of the classroom. This was an unusual situation, but he couldn’t get too angry at Chris, they were really good bros! Although as Chris started kneading his body, he started to lose his composure. It took forever for Tiger to create the perfect features for his Adonis-like body, and now Chris was smoothing away his perfect six-pack, his abs, his everything! <br />
Although it did feel kind of good, like a sensual massage....<br />
Chris laid the immobilised Tiger face-down on the floor and massaged his back, moving down to his glutes. Tiger let out a muffled moan as Chris rubbed his buttocks firmly, smoothing away his crack and smoothing them out. He stood the Tiger back up, and held his shoulders. Tiger looked a bit like a furry mannequin at this point. Chris firmly stroked his hands down Tiger’s sides, smoothing the anthro’s arms to his sides. He massaged and rubbed away the seams leaving Tiger without upper limbs, much the same as he had done to Justin a little earlier. This time, he followed by doing the same to Tiger’s legs so he was left with one thick trunk with two paws at the end. Chris then folded Tiger in half at the waist, so his face was buried in his shins. He forcefully bent the furry’s head backwards, eliciting a muffled yelp, and started smoothing once again. He smoothed away the seam between torso and legs, and then started kneading Tiger’s body once again, like it were a large mass of dough. He stopped after a while and examined his work. He didn’t seem satisfied. He cast a charm. Tiger could feel the inside of his mouth – which still existed behind his sealed lips – fill with water. Panicking, he drank it down in fear of drowning. The water kept coming. Chris watched and waited as the mass of tiger-striped dough before him slowly started to bloat. He rolled his wrist, speeding up the flow of water. After a while, he was satisfied and stopped the charm. He returned to kneading the dough, which was looking back at him furiously. Tiger didn’t care if Chris was his best bro anymore, the guy had just mangled and bloated his perfect body! Chris was delighted to feel how much softer his material was now, and how he was able to distribute it much wider. Soon, he was rubbing the sides of Tiger’s face until they blended in better with the shapeless lump that was his body. Chris considered for a moment, then went all-in and flattened Tiger’s face down completely. Once he was done, he cast another charm, plumping up the mass before him and drying it to a reasonable degree. With a flick of his wrist, Chris completed the transformation. <br />
Now, Chris had an extra chair and a rather handsome tiger-stripe beanbag for his guests to sit on. He decided to test this new piece of furniture.<br />
Tiger could only let out a muffled grunt as Chris’s ass slammed with full force into his face, redistributing his mass outwards. Chris wriggled in. After a moment, he stroked the soft furry material that so perfectly cushioned his ass.<br />
‘You do make a really good beanbag, Tiger. I wouldn’t be surprised if you get your wish and leave with a guest. I’d certainly want to keep you,’ Chris chuckled, ‘and you look so cute with your tail still in-tact!’<br />
Tiger managed to flick his tail irritably. <br />
<br />
Justin, who had watched the whole affair, couldn’t help but wonder if Chris had planned to use him as furniture from the day he offered to help him study. Despite barely being able to feel most of his own body, Chris could feel his face due to his eyes being left as they were. They had been magically protected and flattened to his surface, but he found he could also adjust his sight, possibly part of the magic, or even a subconscious spell of his own. A lot of his text-books suggested that inanimate beings couldn’t feel anything at all, but Justin wondered just how accurate that was. <br />
He could still feel his face – the seat of the chair that he was – because his eyes had been left alone. So could that give him an edge here? Could he return feeling to the rest of his body? He wondered if he could even change himself back before the party started. He certainly didn’t want people sitting on his face. He experimented with expanding his sense of self back in to the rest of his transformed body...<br />
Meanwhile, Chris was doing some quick math. He was working out how many more of his guests he would have to transform for the party. He kind of figured he had enough furniture already and the rest could sit on the bed if need-be, but he also needed to consider refreshments and entertainment...</p>
