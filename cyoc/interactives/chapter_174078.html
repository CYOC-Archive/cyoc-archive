<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Eric left the room, Hank looked around and realized that Eric had left the jacket laying on his bed again. He glanced in the direction of the door, then grabbed it and stuffed it in his backpack. Hank told himself he would only wear it long enough for his voice to drop and stop cracking, but in truth he’d become addicted to the growth.<br />
<br />
After Eric had dropped him off at the middle school before making his way to the nearby high school, Hank took the jacket out and put it on.<br />
<br />
He was greeted by Parker and Alex again, and he told them what Eric had discovered. The twins were surprised, but also intrigued.<br />
<br />
On the way to his locker, Lily met them and took Hank’s hand. She didn’t question the difference in him, just like Eric had found. And throughout class that day, she kept winking at him and smiling.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Hank had difficulty concentrating. His feet felt pinched inside his dad’s shoes, and soon his shirt felt so tight it constricted his breathing. His jeans felt glued to his legs.<br />
<br />
At lunch, Hank made for the bathroom. In the mirror, he almost didn’t  recognize the person reflected. His shirt looked painted onto his body, with two square pectoral muscles just starting to push out and six cobblestone abs viewable even through the material. His biceps were large enough now, forcing his sleeves to ride up. And when Hank rolled his sleeves down and then flexed, he could hear the distinct sound of tearing cloth. He also noticed that his shirt was now not only too small for his muscles, but also too short, leaving an inch or two of skin exposed. His legs had also gotten a similar treatment, now looking more like columns of muscle, which were now too long for his jeans, leaving him at least a few inches over five feet.<br />
<br />
Hank looked at his face in the mirror. He definitely couldn’t pass for 10 anymore, his face alone made him look like he belonged in 7th or 8th grade. There were hairs starting to poke out on his chin and above his lip, and on his arms, legs, and chest. He also looked more handsome than he had any right to, if genetics were any indication (both parents were pretty average). His dirty blond hair had gone straight golden blond, his cheekbones were more pronounced, his nose smaller, his teeth straighter and whiter, his chin more square.<br />
<br />
Realizing that he couldn&#39;t walk around school with clothes at least three sizes too small, Hank quickly headed to the lost and found. Rummaging through the various articles available, Hank was able to find some jeans which were slightly longer then his current legs, but also had a huge waist. However, since he had a belt, Hank knew that he could make them work. The problem was with the shirts being offered. Noe a single one seem big enough to fit him until he finally came across an old football jersey. Knowing that it was his only option, Hank prayed that none of the football players or coaches caught him wearing it.<br />
<br />
But as Hank stuffed his old clothes into his backpack, he was greeted by a couple of older boys, who he thought were in 8th grade. Both wore football jerseys like him, though neither seemed quite his size. But neither looked upset, but rather- glad to see him?<br />
<br />
“Hey Hank!” one of them said, grabbing his hand and slapping him on the back. “Ready for practice today?”<br />
<br />
Hank hesitated a moment, before saying “Yeah, I’m ready!” He silently marveled at his deeper voice.<br />
<br />
“Good, cause Dylan here just told me he heard it’s gonna be a hard one,” the boy said with a grin.<br />
<br />
“Hey, come with Niall and me back to class, the bell’s about to ring,” Dylan said.<br />
<br />
“Right let me just grab my things,” Hank said hurriedly. He found 8th grade materials in his locker, and realized he had aged three years! And apparently he was now a middle school football player. He sweated with dread at what was coming: surviving 8th grade and football. What had he done?</p>
