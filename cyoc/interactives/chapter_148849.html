<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After comming down from the euphoria of Domination, the more rational aspect of Ty came back to the beast. Instead of being disgusted by what he did however, he just so happened to absolutely revel in the pleasures of total ownership, not in the base sense that the beast enjoyed, but also in the higher, non material aspect of mastery. He looked around at his property and out the window to the other, more feral werewolf claiming their plot. No, Ty scoffed, I will not be a simple dreg in this new world, I will be a lord. He shifts himself to a more proper shape for one with greater plans. <br />
<br />
His general canine shape remained, but his lupine features gradualy became more houndlike. Infernal powers pulsed throughout his body, as demonic horns started to curl out from behind his now doberman like ears. Accents of ember like flickering glow could be observed growing in intensity in various areas around his now short furred body. A profaned eternal fire could be seen in his glinting scheming eyes, and a gentle exhaul of flickering corrupting flames came from his long muzzle. These burning accents were subdued and understated, mirroring the control and delibracy that defined its master. A demonic tail swished rythematicly behind, patiently waiting as the transformation finished. The intimidating but refined figure that Ty has melded was fit to be a lord, a lord that smiled sinisterly upon his first two groggy subjects, ready and willing to bide his time in this new world and delicately plan the most succulent ways to dominate and expand his power...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
6 Months latter<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, things have settled down somewhat in the newly invaded realm of Earth. Various factions of creatures have laid claim to the new lands, constantly challenging and jockeying each other for power, prestige, and influence. Ty, the Lord of the Hellhounds has stayed out of the spotlight, while also maintaining a relatively comfortable position as a trusted information broker, being the only one who knows how things came to be. In addition Ty had a small, but loyal and elite cadre of Hellhound-morphs, a widely trusted force employeed by many factions for various high priority jobs, from body guards, to strike teams, to high level secretaries. And in this chaotic world, their reliability is both uncommon and indispensable.<br />
<br />
One night Ty came back to his base of operation and home, a Victorian style Mansion on the plot where his house use to be. Adjusting his suit and tie, (an oddity in the post apocalyptic landscape) he sauntered into his reading room and sat on an elegantly designed sofa, in front of a roaring fire that would be just barely too hot for normal mortals to sit next to comfortably. Finally relaxing after a long day of dealing with the trite squabling of the lion men and the ever haughty dragons, Ty quite literally blew off some steam. A maid Hellhound came and delivered him a cup of earl grey quietly and respectfully as a fully feral hellhound slept contentedly at the Master&#39;s feet.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Ty, his peace was suddenly interrupted by a gravedly pregnant and regal looking Hellhound, with bags under her eyes and a pup at her e-cup teat. <br />
&quot;Master, Master I have great news!&quot;<br />
This queenly bitch was June, Ty&#39;s Former step-mother, but now the Broodmother of the Majority of Ty&#39;s Hellhound children, including the maid, the feral dog, and most of his operatives. Unlike Ty, June&#39;s Daemonic aspects were much more overstated and opulent. She had a quartet of horns, the bottom pair circling around the side of her head like the bands of a tiara, and the top two swerving upwards. On all four of her horns and across the rest of her voluptuous body was a lattice of orange glowing lines and florets, formed from the corruptive fire inside of Ty. Ty decided to keep his aura to a minimum for the sake of appearing businesslike.<br />
<br />
Ty let out a slight sigh and momentarily lamented the loss of his peace and quite. Putting down his tea he responds &quot;What is it my wife&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you like me to focus on taking care of the children and tending to the home, but I couldn&#39;t help but snoop around a bit and I think its the perfect time for you to strike out and start bending some of the factions to your will Master!&quot;<br />
&quot;And how did you come to this conclusion? I am well aware of the current state of affairs, this is a delicate process and Dustin will be around shortly to give me an assessment of the situation. Anyways, where is dinner, didn&#39;t you say that you where aging some human meat a week ago?&quot;<br />
&quot;oh&quot; June was taken aback and readjusted the pup in her arms &quot; Well.. In between breedings, I had extra time to do the research since my choirs went so quickly without having a baby on board hun. I guess it slipped my mind since I was so giddy to help you out... I&#39;m really sorry, will you please forgive me? Yo-You&#39;re not angry are you?&quot;<br />
Ty chuckles &quot;I am not angry darling, everyone makes mistakes, we will just have to both make sure Something like this doesn&#39;t happen again. The problem I see here is that you just have too much free time on your hands when a bun is not in the oven&quot; Ty gets up and pats Junes extended belly, making her a bit flushed. Ty pats the little pup suckling from her mother. &quot;Everyone has a role to play in this family, and yours is to bring our beautiful children into this world and be the mother that you never were before I blessed you&quot; Ty gently kisses the crown of her head. &quot;Let our little boys and girls gather information, you just focus on poping them out like the good little baby factory I know you can be...&quot; Ty&#39;s greatest joy was to dominate and push others to do the things they despised, neglected to do, or accused others of. To dominate in Irony. June was never a good mother to him back in this previous life, so in this one he made sure she would be the best mother possible to his progeny.<br />
<br />
June is painting heavily at this point &quot;In fact... I think I developed a little something that will help as both to be better.&quot; Ty snapped his paw like fingers and an iridescence molten liquid floated just above his hand like a lava light. &quot;This right here will get rid of some of those pesky useless organs like the liver and spleen and so on, and replace it with a second womb, a second incubator for our lovely children.&quot;<br />
<br />
June&#39;s eyes go wide and begins to whine, whether that is a whine of fear or a whine of lust and admiration who is to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll never have to suffer being without child, having unfulfilling free time or the burden and temptation of flexibility.&quot; Seductively Ty moves his muzzle right next to June&#39;s perky ear and whispers &quot; You will truly be the mother you were meant to be..&quot;<br />
<br />
All June&#39;s Inhibitions broke then and there and with a 400 degree breath and hearts in her eyes, she bends over, baby still and hand, knees and one arm on the ground, belly gently swinging barely above the Persian rug. &quot;Yes Yes! Punish your naughty wife, she needs to be constantly gravid to do anything right and be the mother I was MEANT to be!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty slightly smirked, thinking &quot;I trained her well&quot;. He methodically took of his well tailored paints and his various other wears, neatly folding them on a side table next to his half drunken tea. The second to second wait was agonizing for the love drunk mother and he knew it. He held complete control. Finally all naked, June say Ty&#39;s every rippling muscle easily outlined by the short canine fur and the magnificent member that created the sweet little bundle of joy in her arms. Ty getting right to work plunged the liquid fire directly into her sopping wet cunny pushing it all the way to her womb in one swift, almost practiced motion.<br />
<br />
Ty let no time waste and immediately began to take her doggystyle. He felt her round, heart shaped ass and hips, widened by so many pregnancy before. squeezing the mound of flesh and admiring his work. In the world before, people would be terrified at the idea of having sex while a mother nursed her child, but here and know, June felt more complete than anyone ever could. She was enjoying the three fruits of breeding all at once: The wholesome sensation of feeding your child with your own milk, the satisfaction of carrying a new life in her bloated belly, and the euphoria of being currently breed with a new batch of pups from THE choice specimen male. If this was no heaven, no precipice of both carnal and emotional delight, than she would prefer this hell on earth to any afterlife&#39;s reward. Rubbing her belly and pushing the pup&#39;s muzzle closer to her bosom, the little fluff ball sucked contentedly in rythem to her fathers thrusts and her mothers moans, knowing the type of world she will be raised in. Jane&#39;s insides were being reformed, organs that were of little use to her superhuman physique were being reshaped into a more useful form. The gurguling and shifting was being overshadowed by the throws of lovemaking. Eventually, the majority of Jane&#39;s Abdomen region, under her abs was dedicated solely to her know two hyperactive wombs. One already filled to capacity, and the other, a virginal cavity, which will soon be claimed and filled with its first of many lives.<br />
<br />
The Erotic baptism of the new Perpetual mother lasted a modest 30 minutes, but by the time of release time was a fargone concept. Finally, Ty&#39;s strong canine legs force a last thrust and the two Hell hounds cried out in howling orgasm. Ty&#39;s molten hot seed flooding its intended target. June&#39;s shaking digitagrade legs finaly let out, but luckily for her, Ty&#39;s cum inflated her the inch or two needed to bring her gravid stomach in contact with the floor without simply landing on it. <br />
<br />
June turned onto her back to take pressure off her enhanced babymaker, and Ty stood up and put on hist undershirt, the tool between his legs dripping cum and femjuice. June being completely euphoric was dazed and just enjoying the residual tingles. The room was all quiet besides the ticking of a clock and the gentle suckling of the pup, who June had the good maternal instinct to hold close to during the whole ordeal.<br />
<br />
Ty picks a a cigar and lights the end with a snap of a finger. enjoying the moment of silence that June so rudely interrupted.<br />
<br />
<br />
When Ty was just about to leave to was up, the familiar sound of a portal drew his attention. Through it sauntered a lithe sleek hellhound clad in black and grey fur, with accents of orange fire even fainter than Ty&#39;s. At first glance one might think it another hellhound female, but a slightly longer gaze shows a svelt, thin, almost elven male with tight muscles and a modest sized ass. Next to the muscular Ty he seems almost Wafferish and more than a little feminine. With long Jackal like ears, one pierced with a gold ring, a studded collar and a thin face to match his long lanky frame, one would subconsciously call him fey. With Make up and the right cloths he would easily pass as a lady of court, especially due to his flowing, sophisticated, and delicate movement towards Ty. Swaying his enticing hips as he moves towards the Hellhound Master, and in an androgynous voice he playfully called &quot;I Have the documents you need to start the takeover my dear husband.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well done, bring them here Dustin&quot; Ty says sitting back on the Sofa, still without any pants to cover his decency.<br />
Dustin, now looking at the scene before him, with June splayed out in a trance, seed leaking from her pussy and a half hard Ty sitting down, puckered his doggy lips and comments &quot;You could have at least waited for me I&#39;ve been needing a good hammering for days... Mind if I at least clean up? no reason to let your perfectly good cum go to waste&quot;<br />
Ty Lets out another puff of his cigar and says &quot;Sure you can, but this was something between me and your Mother, its been weeks coming to be sure. I finally got that breeder potion to work&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmm, Shame I couldn&#39;t be there&quot; Without taking his eyes of the cum oozing from June&#39;s cunt, Dustin hands the documents over to Ty and immediately starts lapping up the excess spooge in a glutinous frenzy, burying his long muzzle deep into his mother. &quot;God, i&#39;ve missed your cum Ty... Hope that document was worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
While June became Ty&#39;s left hand Breeder, Dustin became his right hand agent, going undercover as men or women and getting the information that even the other hellhounds couldn&#39;t. He was the head espionage agent Training the other hounds, and second in command to Ty himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck Ty, you really did a number on her, I might not even need dinner&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh&quot; Ty Said splitting his concentration between the document and Dustin&#39;s shapely ass underneath his skintight catsuit.<br />
After finishing up, Dustin promptly knelled between Ty&#39;s legs and went to work on his member. &quot;Its much better directly from the tap you mind if I try to get a little out?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sure just let me concentrate&quot;<br />
 The form of domination Ty put on Dustin was turning him into an immensely flaming, stereotypical bottom homosexual. Dustin would always call Ty a faggot and a wimp and laughed at his penis and insinuate he loves it up the butt, but now Dustin is the one enamored with cock and manly men, flamboyantly and self assuredly so. In fact, now his 4 incher, not uncommon in the human world but now relatively small, can barely get it up with self stimulation, he usually requires a good anal fucking to get off, and he loves it. He can pretend to be into girls if the role calls for it, but his heart is forever and truly the loving buttslut of Ty, he&#39;s even bared  him a child or two through demonic alchemy.<br />
<br />
Dustin&#39;s long svelte muzzle expertly works Ty&#39;s immense tool. Dustin&#39;s doggy tongue flickering out to caress his master&#39;s Balls as he dreamily looks up at his loving husband and owner.<br />
<br />
Undisturbed Ty finishes up the documentation and assesses which faction to hit first.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(The gist of the concept is that Ty &quot;corrupts&quot; a specific faction or indivigual. Either just making them subservient to Ty, debasing them, or to TFing them to their opposite traites and gives them a few hellhound traits ex. high haughty germophobic dragons are turned into filthy stupid/musk hungry helldragons, Big strong Bullmen turned into milfy hellcows, Weak/timid rabbits turned into muscular hunky/amazonian hellhares, etc. I do not mind if you deviate from the concept though)</p>
