<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In truth, the counting you did this time did not help one bit. Giggling like a girl, you tell your sister, &quot;I'd be delighted to play with you and so would Miss. P.U.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unable to stop yourself, you pick the plush skunk off the couch and shut off the lights as your sister goes running to her room, squealing with pleasure. Meeting her there, she hands you a one piece dress. The top is pink and the bottom is white with pink splotches. The hem of the dress is silver and as you look at it, Steph hands you a matching pink coat.<br />
<br />
As you put the clothes on, she hands you a pair of white panties with a large pink heart on the front. Handing you a pair of white socks and a white cowgirl hat, she tells you, &quot;There, Kim, now your a pretty cowgirl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holding Miss. P.U. with one hand, you grab the hem with the other and curtsy your sister. Next, she strips naked, something that doesn't bother you and dresses in a matching costume, only hers is a darker shade of pink. The next to hours are spent playing together, before you undress in front of your sister, except for the panties, and pull on a white nightgown with a picture of Cinderella on the front. Looking at your sister, you jump onto her bed, feet and legs curled up beneath you and tell her, &quot;You better get ready for bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, she pulls the costume off and puts on blue nightgown with Tinker Bell on the front. As she hands you hand Miss. P.U., you tell her, &quot;Don't forget you Pull-Up, Steph.&quot;<br />
<br />
She giggles and goes to her closet. Opening it, she pulls from the box two Dry-Nights and as she puts one on, she asked you, &quot;Will you wear one as well?&quot; and she offers the second to you with a sad puppy dog look on her face.<br />
<br />
At first something of your old self surges forward, but then you feel the soft fabric of the gown against your body, the look on her face and what she says next draws you back to a feminine mind. Looking at you with those sad, puppy dog eyes, she says, &quot;Pretty please, Kim.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hook, line and sinker, you reach up and pulled off the panties and pull on the Pull-Up being offered. For some reason your penis and testicles winding up between your legs.<br />
<br />
Hopping into bed, you snuggled up to Miss. P.U. as Steph turns off the light and climbs in bed. Feeling comfortable by the night light, liking the way the sheets smelled and the way the soft fabric of the nightgown presses against your body, you fall asleep next to Steph.<br />
<br />
You sleep all the way through the night, even missing mom coming home from work. In the morning, Saturday, you awake before Steph and climbing out of her bed, head for the bathroom. It was when you see the reflection in the mirror, the previous evening comes slamming home. Afraid that mom could be up, you pull off the Pull-Up, and hike up the nightgown to use the bathroom.<br />
<br />
For some reason, peeing standing up just doesn't feel right any more, so you sit down to do your business. Sneaking out of the bathroom, you breathe a sigh of relief when you hear the house is still silent. Sneaking to the kitchen, you get yourself a bowl of cereal and take it back to your room.<br />
<br />
Sitting in the desk chair, you look about the room and wonder what the hell is going on. There is a few things bothering you. First up is the fact that you know you should take the nightgown off, but something about how comfortable it is makes you feel like keeping it on. In fact, you either want to put the Pull-Up back on or go to your sister's room and wear one of her pairs of underwear.<br />
<br />
That's the second thing that is bothering you, &quot;How is it that I can wear my sister's clothes. There is an obvious height and size difference between us,&quot; you ask yourself. Having no answer, you look around the room.<br />
<br />
This brings you to the third thing. You can't remember your room ever being painted any other colour than what it is painted now; white with pink hearts for trim along the ceiling. This is the complete opposite of Steph's room, which mom painted pink with white hearts for trim. Sighing, you finish your cereal and head for the kitchen to put the bowel in the dishwasher.<br />
<br />
In the kitchen, you stop as you run into your mother, who is preparing a bowel of cereal for herself. She says nothing about the way you're dressed, instead she says, &quot;Good morning Thomas,&quot; and takes her bowel to the kitchen table.<br />
<br />
Wondering what the hell is going on, you place your bowel in the dishwasher. As you are leaving the kitchen, you hear mother saying, &quot;Thomas, can I speak with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking that this is the part were she chews you out for being a pervert for wearing Steph's clothes, wanting to put you in majour therapy for the odd way you've been acting, you step back into the kitchen, bracing yourself for the shit storm. <br />
<br />
But it doesn't come at all. Instead she looks at you with a smile and sets something on the table. Looking down, you see three tickets to the Carnivale. Looking at your mother, she tells you before you can say anything, &quot;A treat for you and Stephanie. Plus it's my way of saying thank-you for watching your sister. I know things have been hard since your father died, but they'll get better, you'll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugging your mother, you find yourself saying, &quot;I love you mommy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mother hugs you back and tells you, &quot;I love you to Thomas. Now, go get dressed. When you sister wakes up, send her in by me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nodding, puzzlement racing across your mind as you still can’t understand why your mother doesn't say anything, you head for your room. Inside, you take the nightgown off and pause. Standing naked, you want to try something. It will probably get you in trouble, or nothing will happen. You figure, &quot;No pain no gain,&quot; as your father used to say.<br />
<br />
Still naked, you streak across the hall and into Steph's room. There you open her dresser and pull out a pair of underwear and some socks. The underwear is white with a picture on the front of My Little Pony with a purple ribbon in her mane. Pulling on the socks and panties, you tuck you penis and testicles back and go for the next drawer.<br />
<br />
Inside that drawer, you pull out a white t-shirt with lace on the collar and edge of the sleeves. Pulling it on, you marvel at the fact that it’s kind of baggy, like the underwear. In fact, the only thing that is snug are the socks, which hug you feet.<br />
<br />
Looking into the mirror, you flip back your now dark red hair back, marveling at how much you look like a girl. Noticing that you look shorter, you measure yourself up next to the growth chart next to the closet and see that you've gone down to about five foot five. Bothered by this, you want to stop what your doing, but decide to press onward.<br />
<br />
The next drawer has pants in it. Digging through the articles of clothing, you find a pair of purple bib-overalls. There are eight pink, heart shaped buttons sewn into place and in different places; three on the left side just above the thighs, but just below the waist line, three on the right side in the same area and two sewn into place were a normal pair of bib-overalls would have the straps fasten in place just below the shoulder line.<br />
<br />
Pulling these on, your marvel at how loose they are, especially in the crotch and in the chest area. &quot;Not to loose where they are baggy, but not tight were they're form fitting,&quot; you tell yourself as you look into the full body mirror.<br />
<br />
Next you look through the closet and find a pair of sneakers Steph hasn't worn in a while. Seeing that they were the kind that light up when you press on the sole, you pull them, surprised that they even fit over your feet. After that, you head to the bed and collect Miss. P.U. and head out of the room and into the living room. <br />
<br />
As you wait to see if your mom will say anything about the way your dressed, wanting badly to go to the Carnivale dressed like this, you sit on the couch and flip on the telly and begin to watch Saturday morning cartoons. The only thing that is telling you of your true sex and gender is the male genitalia tucked between you legs.</p>
