<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff decided that his next best course of action is whether to decide to stay as this or not. On one hand he hadn’t expected the Chronivac  to turn him into a redneck. But on the other, he was horny… really… really… horny. Jeff continued to rub his bulge through his disgusting jeans and realized that he might have to take care of his arousement first.<br />
<br />
He turned toward the Chronivac and decided to change the prior unchecked option to alter reality. Since he was about to give this body a test run, he didn’t want to get interrupted by any of his family members or friends. This would just make sure he had less on his mind in the long run. Not that it was hard, since he couldn’t stop focusing on his throbbing boner begging for release. <br />
<br />
Jeff clicked the alter reality option and watched as his entire room started to alter itself to fit his new appearance. The floor was covered in some dirty blue carpet that was full of stains and had clearly not been vacuumed in a long time. The wall became covered in some strange yellow tinted wallpaper that showed signs of wear from the strips falling down on every side of the room. Jeff’s previously organized room full of his old belongings had changed to be full of layers of unwashed dirty laundry, a few empty beer cans along with some whiskey bottles, and other Southern Type Memorabilia including guns, some American and Southern Pride flags, and plenty of camoflague and hunting merchandise everywhere.<br />
<br />
Looking at his new room, Jeff couldn’t help but be disappointed. It was definitely different from his old room and he had to admit also a massive downgrade. But it still had what he needed: a computer, a bed, and clothes even if they were more dirty and smelly than he preferred. However that could wait… Jeff felt himself getting fired up. He now had what he wanted, time to enjoy his new body. Jeff stood up and felt his head nearly hit the ceiling. His room had become a bit shorter than Jeff remembered but he moved on to his restraining clothing.<br />
<br />
Quickly he pulled the buttons apart on his plaid shirt until the shirt came off with a new missing button due to his forceful manner at opening his shirt. He draped it on his desk chair with his hat and fumbled with his belt buckle, unaccustomed on how they worked, Jeff struggled for a few minutes before yanking it off and unbuttoning his jeans. He threw the dirty work boots to the corner and yanked off the socks before pulling down his jeans and boxers in one swift moment.<br />
<br />
Now naked, Jeff’s cock sprung to life as it stood erect at over ten inches and leaking plenty of precum. Jeff laid on his new bed, as he used his rougher and larger hands to caress his body. Jeff had to admit, he was getting accustomed to being so hairy and rub his fingers through the tufts of hair on his chest and stomach. Although his muscles weren’t as prominent as they had been at the beginning, Jeff admitted he enjoyed the small padded layer of fat covering his body (Probably caused by the constant junk food and beer the body consumed)  and felt more aroused as he pinched his slight beer gut and his plumper pecs.<br />
<br />
Jeff was slowly starting to lose himself. The more and more time he spent in this body, the more he felt he wanted to stay like this. Even the previous foul odors coming from his room and body didn’t stick out to him anymore. All they did was feel unnoticable except for the musk emitting from his body which only fueled his arousal. Jeff began stroking his cock while using his left hand to grasp his balls. They felt much larger and heavier than he was accustomed to which meant they probably were more full of cum.<br />
<br />
“God this feels fuckin’ nice,” Jeff bellowed in his deep southern voice as he used his precum to later his dick before adding speed to his motions.<br />
Letting go of his balls, Jeff used his left hand to pinch his nipple before moving on to caress his body. Jeff was in complete ecstasy as he felt himself enveloped in pleasure. Now Jeff knew he didn’t want to go back.<br />
<br />
Jeff gave a few more strokes, before his cock shot layers of cum over his body. Laying in his bed, Jeff slowly drifted to sleep happily.</p>
