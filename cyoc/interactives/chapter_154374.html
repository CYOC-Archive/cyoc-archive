<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For Thomas Payne this had to be the single worst day of his life, even worse then yesterday when he could no longer hide what he feared when he learned he had come down with the Monster Flue.  Yesterday, he had awoke to find his entire body in the process of changing, he had rushed to the hospital where they told him he had the monster flue and then they scolded him like a child for not coming in sooner so that the change could be better prepared for. He hated that, when he told his parents they told him they would pay for school and he would be allowed to keep his trust fund but not to contact them anymore. They had strongly hinted that he should change his name as well.<br />
<br />
His girlfriend Lisa the woman he loved and who he thought loved him back told him to go to hell and not to contact her. If he was a monster then she didn’t want anything to do with him. She had made it official over social media that she had broken up with him, his only saving grace was that she didn’t announce why she had done so. Then he arrived at the center and found out he was becoming a nymph and so was the roommate of his now ex-girlfriend. <br />
He had cried himself to sleep that night and awoken to find, his manhood totally gone. He was also no longer himself, instead of the powerful star linebacker he was a beautiful Asian woman who he would have jacked off to without shame. His well now her roommate Kim had also become a beautiful woman who would have made his manhood hard if he still had a manhood. He couldn’t have helped but look at her more then a few times as their mentors talked to them. <br />
<br />
The group therapy session wasn’t too bad even if people kept looking at him like he was a hot piece of ass. When he complained about that to Kim she had told him.<br />
<br />
“Well you are a hot piece of ass.” countered Kim <br />
<br />
The thing that made his skin craw was after the group therapy session, he had a private meeting with one of his mentors Jess formally James the only other man to become a nymph. That been the worse thing he had ever been though, learning about feminine products, periods and the like was something he didn’t ever want to know. He didn’t even like knowing when Lisa was having her periods, all that did was tell him that he wasn’t as likely to get sex…well besides oral sex that was. Now he would be the one having periods and he didn’t like it at all. Then there was the threat of getting pregnant and childbirth. Jess hadn’t been pregnant yet, his wife who had become a succubus was the one who became pregnant but Nymphs like Succubus could get pregnant through same sex relationships.<br />
 <br />
Finally near the end of the day, he had gone back to the room only to find no one there. Kim had likely gone to get something to eat. Food was among the last things he wanted, so he fell backwards onto the bed, when he did his breast bounced which was a strange feeling for him. He grabbed his chest and instantly wished he hadn’t it felt so good to cup his breasts. Then he began to move his thumb over his or rather her nymph like he had done for Lisa and it felt even better. <br />
<br />
He knew he should have stopped but he couldn’t help himself as he had pulled his shirt up and began to play with himself with one hand while another slipped under his pants and began to brush his now her womanhood. He bit his bottom lips he to dream but instead of him fucking his girlfriend Lisa or some much hotter chick he saw on a porno or movie now he was dreaming about his roommate Kim. The monster virus was supposed to change someone’s orientation, so a straight male if gender changed would be a straight woman but it wasn’t happening to him. Maybe because Nymphs where somewhat naturally bi-sexual like succubus then maybe he was becoming bi-sexual as well or maybe he always had been but didn’t want to admit it. <br />
<br />
Either way he was lost in his fantasies, of him or rather as he was now a woman taking Kim in multiple different ways, sometimes three ways with his ex-girlfriend Lisa or other people man and women both. He was so lost in thoughts he didn’t notice the door open and Kim walking in on him while he was moaning her name.</p>
