<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s older brother, Nick, was currently working out with his football teammates in the weight room, conditioning for the upcoming summer practices. Nick, a wide receiver, finished up his last set on squats with a grunt before straightening up. His spotter, Aaron the quarterback, nodded his head with approval.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice job,&quot; he said, coming around the squat rack. &quot;That was 185 pounds. Your personal best, right?&quot; Nick nodded as he stood up, a little proud of himself. &quot;Keep it up and you&#39;ll be almost as good as me, assuming I don&#39;t get stronger,&quot; Aaron smirked with a slight flex of his arms. Nick rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, man,&quot; he said. They both looked up at the head coach&#39;s whistle before Nick could say something in return. The grunts and clangs around the gym died down as the other players turned their attentions to their coach. Soon, the only sound that could be heard was the radio, which another coach turned the volume down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright team,&quot; the 54-year-old, barrel-chested man announced. &quot;Is there anyone who has a couple more exercises to finish with their workout?&quot; About half of the players&#39; hands raised. &quot;That actually works just fine. Those of you who still need to finish may do so now. Everyone else, get your showers in. Be quick so your teammates aren&#39;t waiting on you! We&#39;ll have a quick meeting once everyone is done so don&#39;t you dare leave! Move it!&quot; The players who weren&#39;t finished turned back to the gym equipment while Nick, Aaron, and everyone else filed into the locker room for showers. The radio was turned up a little bit. The coaches went into the office adjacent to the weight room.<br />
<br />
Chris, a stocky senior defensive lineman, loaded up the barbell for his partner, a young, thin yet toned sophomore kicker named Nathan. Nathan positioned himself underneath the barbell and began bench pressing, Chris keeping an eye on the bar in case it started to fall. The song on the radio ended, and the next one started playing: Adele&#39;s Hello.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, this is a good song,&quot; Nathan said with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just focus on the bar,&quot; Chris reminded him. &quot;This is your highest weight you&#39;ve benched.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Because it doesn&#39;t feel like it,&quot; Nathan said, confused. Unnoticed by either of them, Nathan&#39;s arms grew larger and larger with each rep. His chest began sticking out further as well. Nathan set the bar on the rack. &quot;Could you load up some more weight?&quot; he asked, coughing as his former 15-year-old voice dropped from a high tenor down to a low baritone. &quot;I think I&#39;m warmed up enough.&quot; Chris obliged, adding on more weight. He blinked, and the 25-lb plate in his hands changed to a 45-lb plate. The now burly Nathan watched as the muscles in Chris&#39;s arms bulged and twisted as he loaded the weight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, that&#39;s hot,&quot; he thought to himself. Wait, where had that thought come from? He wasn&#39;t no fag! He wasn&#39;t gay! And he certainly wasn&#39;t checking out Chris&#39;s slightly hairy forearms that rippled with muscle nicely nor was he finding his eyes drifting to Chris&#39;s really firm ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; he mumbled softly as his cock started to swell in his gym shorts. He closed his eyes. He was getting turned on by his hot teammate. He couldn&#39;t really deny it now as his cock came to full mast. He was turned on and very horny right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; Chris asked, looking down at Nathan&#39;s face. His heartbeat quickened suddenly when Nathan opened his eyes, flashing a brilliant blue into Chris&#39;s own emerald green. Wow, that boy...boy? no...that man underneath him was hot. Why had he never seen it before? He was barely aware of the stiffening in his shorts.<br />
<br />
Nathan did not miss the growing bulge in Chris&#39;s shorts. His mouth began to water a little bit as he now blatantly stared at the growing rod, wondering if it would ever stop yet hoping it wouldn&#39;t. He licked his lips as he sat up and turned around to face Chris on the bench, his eyes not leaving the large bulge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to stare at it all day or are you going to help me out there?&quot; Chris asked quietly. Nathan glanced up at him, and a look of pure lust crossed his face. He slowly pulled Chris&#39;s shorts and jockstrap down and kissed the most beautiful-looking cock he had ever seen. His reservations gone, he grabbed the cock and plunged it into his drooling mouth. Chris moaned and leaned his head back with his eyes closed, enjoying the pleasure course through him. Hearing similar groans around him, he opened his eyes and looked around. He didn&#39;t think he could get more turned on at the point, but he was very wrong. All of his teammates around him were in similar positions that he and Nathan were in. Some were 69&#39;ing on the floor. Others were groping and kissing each other. One pair had even moved on to more exciting positions that Chris certainly wanted to try soon with Nathan.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the office, the coaches were talking about logistics for the upcoming football season.<br />
<br />
&quot;The locker room is too small for us to properly use,&quot; the offensive coach said, a young man fresh out of college with a huge build.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s not wrong,&quot; the 30-something, tall and lean defensive coordinator added. &quot;Our numbers have gotten too large for that locker room. We might be able to get by now but once we start practicing outdoors during the next school year, we&#39;ll have issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll talk to the athletic director about it,&quot; the head coach said. &quot;Maybe he can convince that fag of a principal to help us out.&quot; Both the athletic trainer and the offensive coach frowned disapprovingly at the comment. They were brothers, and had similar builds having both played college football and done bodybuilding competitions together. The athletic trainer, unlike his brother, was gay. Neither appreciated the homophobic behavior the head coach exuded. Something through the drawn blinds caught the athletic trainer&#39;s eye though. Curious, he took a peak through the window. His eyes went wide at what he saw.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; he said, alerting the other coaches. He stood up quickly and opened the door to the sound-proof office. Loud sounds assaulted all four pairs of ears: that popular Adele song everyone had been raving about and the grunts and groans of a manly orgy. The athletic trainer went slack-jawed at what the sight of Chris fucking Nathan on the bench while Nathan sucked a tight end&#39;s cock, trying desperately not to get turned on by what he was seeing. His stiffening cock was telling him that he was failing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in God&#39;s name is happening out there?!?&quot; the head coach asked loudly. He looked at the other two coaches in front of him. They had stopped looking through the door and were staring at each other with growing appreciation in their eyes. The head coach found his eyes drawn to the offensive coach&#39;s huge arm muscles, bewildered by the sudden gay thoughts in his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn around, Coach Smith,&quot; the offensive coach growled to the defensive coach. The head coach&#39;s cock lurched instantly to steel rod-like hardness. &quot;I&#39;ve seen that firm ass of yours. And I want a piece of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask, Coach Anderson,&quot; Coach Smith purred, stripping down his pants and showing off his pert and tight bubble butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I have been wanting to fuck you over your desk, Coach Daniels, ever since I laid eyes on you,&quot; the other Coach Anderson said gruffly from behind the head coach all of a sudden. He yanked the head coach&#39;s pants all the way down before inserting his cock directly into Coach Daniel&#39;s large ass. Coach Daniels leaned back into Coach Anderson and kissed him, their tongues wrestling fiercely and his cock leaking onto the desk.<br />
<br />
In the locker room, Nick and Aaron were walking into the showers, oblivious to all of the gay sex happening in the weight room and coach&#39;s office. The running water drowned out most noise from the weight room anyway. However, when Adele began singing the chorus of her song, the music was just loud enough to cut through the water to be barely heard in the locker room. Because it was quiet compared to the running water and the loud chatter, the changes were gradual.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how&#39;s your brother doing?&quot; Aaron said loudly to Nick. Aaron was the only person Nick confided in when Jeff came out to him. Aaron, whose own divorced father was gay, was supportive of his friend and kept the secret. The music softly cut through the running water. The 17-year-old quarterback&#39;s chest slowly began to thicken a little as he gradually aged one year.<br />
<br />
&quot;He seems alright, but it&#39;s hard to tell,&quot; Nick said, rubbing soap over his broad back. &quot;My parent&#39;s aren&#39;t taking it well at all though. He doesn&#39;t talk to me about it either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just be there for him if he is ever ready to start talking to you,&quot; Aaron said, scratching his chest as the hair became thicker. &quot;That&#39;s all the advice I can give you.&quot; Some shouting grabbed their attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Are you getting hard like some gay pussy!&quot; Ben, an impressively tall running back, shouted at a blushing Pete, a previously small 14-year-old third-string quarterback. He was now sporting a very large, and semi-hard, cock and thick, barreled chest and large arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Knock it off, Ben!&quot; Aaron warned, unaware that his own cock was starting to plump up a little. &quot;Sometimes us guys just can&#39;t help it. Yours doesn&#39;t look that soft either, in case you weren&#39;t aware.&quot; Ben looked down and seemed surprised at his own semi-hard cock. He too then started blushing. Nick, for whatever reason, found himself staring at Pete&#39;s large cock. It was nice to look at.<br />
<br />
He was jolted out of his undisturbing admiration of that cock when he heard the locker room doors bang open. Adele&#39;s song was just reaching the climax, and it cut through the noise like a hot knife. Guys started walking to the source of the bang as the sounds of conversation died down. Nick was about to follow when he realized he still had soap on his body that needed rinsing off. He turned his back to the shower entrance and allowed the water to run down his front. He began breathing heavily as the water dripped off his cock, which was suddenly rock hard and extra sensitive. His mind began to drift to the thoughts of Pete&#39;s cock. He licked his lips, thinking about what it would taste like and...<br />
<br />
Nick shook his head, surprised. Why was he thinking like that? And why was he so turned on right now. He turned around and found himself face to face with Aaron. Aaron&#39;s hazel eyes were dilated as they glided down Nick&#39;s torso. Nick felt a pleasurable chill as Aaron looked him over, stopping at his rock hard cock. Nick looked down as well. Holy shit! Aaron&#39;s cock looked even better than Pete&#39;s!<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Aaron whispered hoarsely, swallowing. &quot;I never told you, but I always wondered if I inherited my dad&#39;s gayness. I always found you quite attractive, but never like this.&quot; He started leaning closer to Nick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; Nick whispered back, raising his hands slowly to Aaron&#39;s sides. Aaron drew a short intake of breath when the hands made contact. &quot;I think Jeff and I are more alike than I thought. And I really want you right now!&quot; Without another moment, Aaron closed the distance between their lips and engulfed Nick&#39;s with his own. The pair began moaning and groaning into each other&#39;s mouths as their hands soon pulled their naked, hard bodies closer together. They groped at every inch they could reach, grinding their hips and cocks against each other. If either had been paying attention, they would have noticed that no person on the football team, coach or player, was left out of some action. Nick couldn&#39;t wait to share this new revelation about himself with Jeff when he got home as Aaron turned him around and plunged his cock into Nick&#39;s ass.</p>
