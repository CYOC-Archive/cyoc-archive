<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maybe Amber was just infatuated with how her breasts turned out, but now that she&#39;s seen how wonderful growing a second or second pair of something could be, it made her really think about what <i>else</i> could be wonderful to do that with. Arms came to mind, since she now had four cunts she wanted to stuff and only two hands at her disposal... it seemed too awkward to try using two fists, her tail, and her cock to do it, too. <br />
<br />
Though growing an extra cock or three could accomplish that as well... though, maybe just an extra. Maybe she&#39;d do that <i>later</i>. As her mind raced down this track in her fresh rush of arousal, she got further away from trying to do anything to help stuff her pussies, and instead just focused on what could be hottest right now to have more of.<br />
<br />
Her balls did seem kind of empty right now, on account to cumming so much, so... perhaps...<br />
<br />
It ended up being as off-the-cuff as that. Amber changed &quot;plump&quot; to &quot;four&quot;. The effects were as instantaneous as they&#39;ve always been so far, and the modified question read: <br />
&quot;Amber is looking at her hard dragon cock and four balls, her other hand already on its way to her sensitive breasts again, as she thinks about what she should change next.&quot;<br />
<br />
The effects hit like a freight train, or perhaps more of a gut-punch. Her eyes went wide, her mouth hung open a little, and she choked out strained gasp as a whole slew of downstream effects settled in. For a brief moment, she was truly afraid she might&#39;ve just done something she <i>really</i> shouldn&#39;t have, but she also found a portion of herself pushing back vehemently against that view. An... instinctual side of her that she&#39;d started to get to know, but hadn&#39;t ever been <i>this</i> strong.<br />
<br />
Of course, she couldn&#39;t keep her eyes off of her junk, as the sentence she entered explicitly stated her looking at it. She had no choice but to behold those balls of hers, and it made everything make so much sense. She got the quartet of testicles she&#39;d wished for, for sure, all jostling for space in her scaly sack that was now significantly larger to contain them all. ...But each of those balls of hers were also larger than they were when she just had two. These could fill most of her hand, if she cupped them!<br />
<br />
Which she definitely did do, a lot, going down to eagerly fondle and feel-up her fat, over-virile sack. Spurts of precum erupted from her cock as she moaned like a wanton slut, her heart beating out of her chest as she squirmed on her pile of golden coins. They&#39;re so heavy, so dense, and... oh gods, the kind of <i>hormones</i> these things are pushing out, she never thought of it but now it was so obvious... her new memory confirmed as much!<br />
<br />
She&#39;d had these all her life, supposedly, and it led her to being quite precocious, developing earlier and developing <i>much</i> more intensely than in previous incarnations of her draconic life. They were dragon hormones, too, so what they inspired in her body was markedly different than any normal human sexual maturity. She was increasingly becoming draconic now, and found herself even thinking of herself that way!<br />
<br />
...Which isn&#39;t to say the fact she had now grown to six foot six inches in height rather jarring, once she noticed it, or saw how her hips had for some reason dramatically expanded, all but ensuring her ass was going to be pretty damn huge no matter how much she worked out. She could tell just from her new memories she had slitted pupils, a long and flexible tongue, sharper teeth, and now also inch-long horns jutting from her forehead, along with dustings of scaly outcroppings accenting much of her body now. Just about the only thing she didn&#39;t have in some form or another were <i>wings,</i> yet, but she also found she didn&#39;t necessarily yearn for them... just as she didn&#39;t yearn for any of these changes. They were just <i>natural</i>. <br />
<br />
She was more transfixed by the obscene sight of her cock, though, now that it increasingly took the forefront of her mind, along with her balls. Really, just because it was how her balls were going to be emptied of what she knew was <i>significantly</i> more virile dragon-spunk. Her cock had gained a couple inches in length, and thickened generously, but that was... small. It&#39;s shape had refined further, becoming a meaner, more intense version of its former guise. Her ridges were much more prominent, and there were softer nodules and projections that now lined it. She had a <i>sheath</i> now, even, a bestial sheath... and a small, but functional knot. <br />
<br />
Amber was simply transfixed by her urethra, though, the main consequence to giving herself double the cum capacity down there--more than double, in fact! Simply put, her entire cumpipe was quite disproportionately larger, something she knew was just as much natural biology as it was so many years of cumming such huge loads managing to enlarge it over time. Her cumslit was larger, too, a quivering and more prominent ring forced to drool constantly whenever she was aroused. Amber mused she could probably fit a pencil in without stretching anything out, and two probably wouldn&#39;t even be that hard... not that she wanted to, though, all she could think about now was about how much cum was going to course down and out through her length. Down her fat, draconic dick...<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t take it anymore, she <i>had</i> to get off! In the blink of an eye she rolled over onto her side, furiously using both hands to jerk herself off as her tail teased her balls. For a time, at least. She felt the peak rising, she was so consumed by it she hardly thought otherwise as her tail curled back in on itself to find its way into her very own tailhole, plunging in with too much ease as she took it <i>deep.</i> The jolt of feeling herself so full now, and giving herself a stretching she&#39;d never experienced in her non-fabricated memories staved off the orgasm just for a little longer, but it didn&#39;t stop release from crashing over her as her tail found what turned out to be its objective.<br />
<br />
Her prostate.<br />
<br />
Amber never experienced such a feeling before, and her greedy tail sure knew it was doing where she didn&#39;t herself... a deeply unsexy croak of shock escaped her lips as she gasped for air, body trembling and shaking violently as her vision all but blanked out. Somewhere in the back of her mind she could tell <i>this</i> too was downstream of her most recent change, as even a passing familiarity with male anatomy told her that... this place should not be this sensitive, and most of all <i>not</i> as obscenely large and solid of a mass as it is, but any and all thoughts were pushed out of her as her balls lurched upwards. <br />
<br />
It took so much force... her pelvic muscles and gods knows what other kind of unique muscular anatomy she had strained as it dredged up her first shot of spunk from the depths of her balls, the process hardly as instantaneous as she&#39;d come to know it. She groaned, feeling everything stretching and swelling from within as her fiery seed churned upwards, torturous in pacing, finding a second and third clench needed before her load finally found its way out into the world; so distending her cock in the process her weary hands were forced apart, and she didn&#39;t have the energy or coherence to put them back and continue stroking!<br />
<br />
Amber <i>screamed</i> out, tears welling in her eyes as she just thrust aimlessly as she came, and came, and came. A thick, sustained stream hoses down everything in front and above her, creating a pile that builds faster than it can ooze... her cum was obscenely viscous, the main culprit in why this climax was taking just so much effort as it dragged on and on. The virile slop wasn&#39;t even like molasses anymore, closer to being like pudding than something truly runny... it was <i>such</i> a disgusting, erotic mess, so utterly exhausting as she let out no less than a gallon of the stuff, and yet she loved it. All she could think or feel was just <i>cumming</i> and making as big of a mess as possible, and... increasingly, an unsatisfied undercurrent in her mind, a deep and unscratched instinct, was upset that her cum was being wasted.  This <i>should</i> be filling people with as many eggs as they could hold!<br />
<br />
And when her orgasm finally trailed down to a mere twitching and dribbling and heavy, ragged breaths, tail slipping out from her backside, she stunned. Awestruck. ...Confused, as to where the thought of eggs had come from, and why she also had a yearning for them herself, now, making her asshole twitch and her nipple-cunts ache.<br />
<br />
Her phone is thankfully not cum-encased, although her hands are a mess... and instead of just wiping them off on some of the unsullied patches of her body or just licking it off, the need-filled aching in her breasts inspires her to just shove her hands back in. ...It&#39;s a bit of a mistake, though, and it works out just as last time did: she really couldn&#39;t do a thing to her breasts without sympathetic arousal spreading to her cock, and making it grow to hardness yet again.<br />
<br />
Pulling one hand back out, still rather messy but in a different way, <i>then</i> she wipes off the copious arousal slathered on her hand off against herself, and proceeds to check her phone. Heart racing at just what a sentence might show up this time...<br />
<br />
&quot;Amber is deeply confused about her new instincts, desiring to be filled with eggs of her own even if she wants to fill others, too.<br />
<br />
Simply reading those words made her face flush, and make all four of her nipples <i>and</i> balls ache with need. Was she in heat or something!?<br />
<br />
Still, she could probably... make her situation a little better, at least, or maybe worse. She thinks a little harder this time, though it never crosses her mind to accept she could just <i>not</i> use the app for once. So, she ends up changing the word:</p>
