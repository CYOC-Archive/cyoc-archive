<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay, bro, I need my rock back and you're going to be late for your <br />
date,&quot; John said entering the bathroom.  <br />
<br />
He averted his eyes in case his bro was jacking off again. He'd caught <br />
his 20 year old brother more than once &quot;priming&quot; himself before a <br />
date. The bathroom was almost totally silent.  He heard a faint <br />
splashing coming from the tub.  He looked down into the tub, and saw <br />
his transformation stone glowing fluorescent shades of green, yellow, <br />
pink and orange. The only thing moving in the tub was a very large <br />
tadpole with hind legs swimming around.<br />
<br />
John ran to his brother's door to the bathroom, and it was locked. <br />
That was signature Ocean, he'd lock the door he came through from his <br />
room for privacy, and forget to lock the door to John's bedroom. Still <br />
if it was locked on the inside?  John felt his brother's hanging <br />
towel, it was bone dry. He looked down into the tub and asked, &quot;Ocean?<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
The almost developed young frog stopped swimming. It turned and forced  <br />
its head out of the water. It looked up at John pleadingly. They <br />
stared at each other for more than a minute, but Ocean was still <br />
breathing water, and ducked his tadpole head back into the bath. John <br />
couldn't help but laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Ocean, I'd have to say you're going to be late for your date.  <br />
I'll go get the instructions, and see if there's anything about <br />
brother's turning into frogs. Worst case scenario, I can take you on <br />
your date, and we'll see if her kiss can change you back. Or maybe it <br />
has to be a princess or someone of royal lineage that kisses you?&quot;<br />
<br />
John ducked out of the bathroom. He came back laughing harder, wearing <br />
rubber gloves and carrying the terrarium. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, I just remembered you were trying to come up with a costume for <br />
your party. I think this qualifies as a prize winner, if anyone <br />
believes it's you,&quot; John said reaching his gloved hand into the water <br />
to collect the stone. <br />
<br />
He carefully put the glowing stone into the terrarium. He had already <br />
made a few modifications to the contents of the plastic box.  He had <br />
dug the &quot;pond&quot; larger and built up a gravelly hill. He now set the <br />
terrarium on the tub edge and used his gloved hands like a bowl to <br />
scoop up water. Water leaking from his hands dripped down like rain <br />
into the terrarium as he moved his hands over the new &quot;Big Pond&quot; and <br />
let the water drop half filling it.<br />
<br />
Then he knelt with his hands bowled beneath the water, and called out, <br />
&quot;Okay, Ocean, time to get going. Swim into my hands, and I'll put you <br />
in my terrarium until I can figure out what to do with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tadpole swam over to John's hands and treaded water just outside <br />
of the bowl they made. He forced his head out of the water and croaked <br />
faintly, &quot;John...&quot; he ducked back in the water and croaked again, <br />
&quot;help...me.&quot; Then he took a small leap over John's fingers and into <br />
the bowl of water made by his hands. John felt a swelling inside his <br />
jeans as the tiny creature's body moved around in his giant cupped <br />
hands. He felt very powerful as he lifted the tadpole and handful of <br />
water out of the tub and added it to his terrarium. <br />
<br />
Ocean blinked as he swam around the plastic and gravel pond. He could <br />
feel the power of the transformation stone at work around and on him. <br />
He could feel the strange warmth permeating his new plastic home. <br />
Little plant shoots were visible sprouting everywhere.  It would soon <br />
be a lush jungle.  Duckweed was already starting to float on the <br />
surface of his pond. It reminded Ocean of that scene in the Star Trek <br />
movie of the Genesis planet coming to life. Of course, this was <br />
impossible, he told himself.  He must've slipped in the tub, bumped <br />
his head and be hallucinating.  His mind couldn't deny though that he <br />
could feel the water and he was in fact swimming.<br />
<br />
John added more water. Drained the tub, and put the lid back on his <br />
terrarium.<br />
<br />
He talked thoughtfully half-to himself and half to Ocean, as he <br />
carried the Terrarium back into his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your arms - or are they forelegs - are visible just beneath your <br />
skin, bro, you'll soon be breathing air, hopping around and eating <br />
flies,&quot; John chuckled.  He really wanted to see Ocean eat a fly. He <br />
added, &quot;I bet you're pretty hungry too. I'll see if I can catch you <br />
some flies for dinner. It'll make a great youtube video.  Wish I'd <br />
captured your transformation in the tub. I bet that was cool. Oh, man, <br />
I wish I hadn't already done my Senior Science Project, I could use <br />
you, and do it on the development of a tadpole into a frog. I still <br />
could. The project's not due until Friday. Oh, wait, Mr. Waters would <br />
probably want me to dissect the frog at the end of the project.  And <br />
as much as you get on my nerves sometimes bro, I wouldn't do that to <br />
you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He set the terrarium on his desk and marveled at how much life had <br />
appeared since he added the transformation stone. Tiny colorful flower <br />
buds were visible among the now colored gravel.  There were tiny <br />
shoots growing and twisting up the plastic plants. John set up his web <br />
cam to capture all the changes, and then went to carefully re-read the  <br />
box and instructions that came with the terrarium.<br />
<br />
Ocean could hear the dripping sound of condensed water falling from <br />
above.  The stone seemed to be heating the terrarium up to jungle like <br />
temperatures.  Ocean let his back emerge from the warm water to enjoy <br />
the moist hot air.  It reminded him of a cross between a steam room <br />
and sauna. He was sure he could hear the life growing around him.  He <br />
felt safe and secure and filled with wonder.  For the moment he forgot <br />
he had ever been human, and was definitely going to be late for his <br />
date.</p>
