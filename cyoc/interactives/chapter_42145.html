<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harriette was nervous on the ride home. She was glad she had become a girl but she didn't know how her parents would react. They were somewhat religious and went to the same church that Marry and her parents did. Would they react the same way that Marry's parents had? When Marry had been pulled out of school word quickly spread that it was because because of Jen. In church Marry had been held up as an example of the dangers of associating with the mysticals that had come out of the closet. Even in Sunday School Marry was used as an example. They were constantly being told that unless Marry repented and asked God for forgiveness she would be going to Hell. This had the effect of most of the kids keeping their distance from Marry. This led Harriette to seek out Jen and ask her to make her a magical girl. That and the belief that she would have fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're here&quot; Charlene said breaking into Harriette's thoughts. &quot;Do you want me to come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's ok&quot; Harriette said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that your parents go to the same church as Marry's&quot; Charlene said. &quot;I didn't believe the rumors that that church was saying mysticals were of Satan. I don't want you going through the same thing that Marry is. Are you sure that you don't want me to come in with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks&quot; Harriette said. On some level she knew that it would only make things worse if Charlene came in. &quot;Thanks for bringing me home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome sweetie&quot; Charlene said. &quot;I hope things go well for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harriette nodded and got out of the van. She went up to the door and walked in. Her mother was in the kitchen making supper and his father was in his den. Her mother must have heard her come in since she shouted &quot;Is that you Harry dear?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mum!&quot; Harriette shouted back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sound like you have a cold&quot; her mother said coming out of the kitchen. She stopped short upon seeing Harriette. After a couple of minutes she called to her husband &quot;George! Come here!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing the urgency in his wife's voice George came running and asked &quot;What is it Margaret?&quot; He stopped short upon seeing Harriette. After a couple minutes he said weakly &quot;I need a drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few minutes later Harriette was sitting on the sofa while her parents stood facing her. George had a strong drink in his hand and Margaret was looking at Harriette with a worried expression on her face and worrying her dress. &quot;How did this happen?&quot; George asked at last.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen changed me&quot; Harriette said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We shouldn't have let you go over there&quot; George said. &quot;Now she's tainted you with her demonic power.&quot; Margaret gasped at this and put her hands to her face. &quot;We'll fix it though&quot; George continued. &quot;An exorcism should free you and hopefully change you back. You will not associate with Jen anymore. She must have been planning this for awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I asked Jen to change me&quot; Harriette said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may think that you asked her to change you but she tricked you into it&quot; Margaret said sitting on the sofa and hugging Harriette.<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; Harriette asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She probably made sure that you didn't have any friends that were boys&quot; George said. &quot;I knew that we should have found you some boys you could have been friends with. I'll call Father Winston. He should be able to come over and perform the exorcism.&quot; He turned and went back to his den to call Father Winston.<br />
<br />
&quot;But there's nothing wrong&quot; Harriette said confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course there's something wrong&quot; Margaret said. &quot;You're a girl now and God saw fit to make you a boy when you were born. This goes against his will and is wrong. Don't worry though. Your father and I still love you and we'll do whatever we have to to cure you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Winston arrived just as supper was being served carrying a strange jar. Of course he was invited to join them for supper. During supper he watched Harriette closely and noticed that she had a necklace like the one Marry had. After supper was finished and they were in the sitting room he said &quot;Now Harry, I want you to know that I'll do everything I can to rid you of this demonic presence but you have to help me do that. I want you to hand me that necklace you have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Harriette said firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll feel better if you do&quot; Father Winston said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Harriette said even more firmly.<br />
<br />
Father Winston sighed and said &quot;I was afraid of this. Please hold his arms down.&quot;<br />
<br />
George did as Father Winston said and held Harriette's arms to her sides. She squirmed but her father was stronger than her. Father Winston took her necklace and she screamed &quot;GIVE MY NECKLACE BACK!&quot;<br />
<br />
Father Winston smiled and said &quot;The demon possessing your son is worried. This necklace is it's source of power here in the material world. As soon as I put it in this jar of Holy Water the demon will be significantly weakened.&quot; He took the lid off the jar and put Harriette's necklace into it.<br />
<br />
&quot;GIVE MY NECKLACE BACK!&quot; Harriette shouted trying to squirm out of her father's grasp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you exorcise the demon Father?&quot; Margaret asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It may take some time but without the necklace the demon will lose&quot; Father Winston said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will my son become a boy again?&quot; George asked still holding Harriette's arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh undoubtedly&quot; Father Winston said. &quot;God made Harry a boy at birth and His plan calls for him to be a boy. As soon as the demon is gone He will make Harry a boy again. In the meantime we will perform the exorcism. Make sure that he comes to church and cut his hair. Keep dressing him in his clothes and call him Harry. Dressing him in girl's clothes or calling him Harriette as he has said only makes the demon stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you be performing the exorcism now?&quot; Margaret asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not here&quot; Father Winston said. &quot;I want to do it on Holy Ground to ensure success. Between now and then if you see any animal hanging around kill it for it will be the demon's familiar. Now I must leave. Don't worry Harry. You'll be free soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm free now&quot; Harriette said in a low voice. She had given up struggling to get her necklace back since it was obvious she couldn't get it back with her father holding her. She would have to ask Shaela to get it back for her.<br />
<br />
As Father Winston was leaving he turned and said &quot;Oh, you should put Harry into a religious school. There's an all boys school that I know of. I'll explain the situation to them and I'm sure they'd be happy to have Harry attend. Good night.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as Father Winston was gone Margaret said &quot;Time for your bath Harry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Harriette now&quot; Harriette said for what felt like the millionth time.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are my son Harry&quot; George said. &quot;I don't have a daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine then&quot; Harriette said in a low menacing tone. &quot;I'm not your daughter and you're not my parents.&quot;<br />
<br />
This surprised both Margaret and George so much that Harriette was able to slip from her father's grasp and run out the door into the night. By the time they thought of moving she was long gone.</p>
