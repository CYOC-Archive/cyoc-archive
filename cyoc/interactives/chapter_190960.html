<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Larry&#39;s cock. The most beautiful cock I&#39;d seen in my entire life, better than anything that could be found on the internet. The thick, foreskin-covered head, pulsating and dripping with precum.  The shaft, covered in veins, criss-crossing over the girth of this monster. I looked at it, admiring it, taking in all of the details that made it superior to all other cocks in the world. Even the musk it emanated smelt better than anything else. My mouth was agape, watering as I reveled in the pure magnificence of it.<br />
<br />
Chuckling from above distracted me, my eyes moving up from this work of genital art to meet Larry&#39;s gaze. He was looking at me with a shit-eating grin, his brown eyes piercing deep into my soul. “I know what you need, Jason. You need my cock, don&#39;t you?” he asked me, well aware I would only answer with a weak, lusty whimper. “You&#39;re not going to have your fun just yet. Let me have mine first. Keep staring at me, think about my thick, juicy monster cock and how you&#39;re not allowed to touch it until I let you.” He let go of his third leg, placing both hands on his hips, pumping his chest forward a bit to give me a better view of what he saw as his temple.<br />
<br />
And so I obliged. My eyes, locked onto his upper body, the only thing to do was fawn over its glory. The wide, manly jaw, square beyond belief, covered in heavy salt and pepper hair. If only these were brushing against my body, prickling against my skin...  I moved my stare down, onto his vascular bull neck, swallowed by his massive shoulders. Admiring this was already enough to make my ass twitch in lust, my nub leaking a few drops. Submitting to someone built like this was easy with a cock small like mine. Larry licked his lips, as if he could figure out what I was thinking of...<br />
<br />
“And lower, go on.”<br />
<br />
His collarbone was out of my sight, hidden by what I could only describe as godly muscletits. Larry&#39;s pecs were complete slabs of prime beef, jutting out of his chest like a shelf. A good layer of hair covered them, accentuating their size. His fat nipples, pointing down, at least an inch and a half in width each,  looked delicious, practically begging to be sucked. He moved one of his girthy, calloused hands to his right tit, pinching it as his huge biceps flexed from the motion.  Deep moans escaped his mouth, staring at me with a wide smirk. My panting was audible, this display of oozing dominance drowning me in lust. While quite muscular, Larry did not have excessively defined abs. His powerful waist was large, hair sprouting all over it, the small crevices of his light 6-pack highlighted by them. Then came the bush leading to his most prized attribute, his cock. <br />
<br />
Thoughts about the book came to mind for an instant... Larry&#39;s hole-destroyer had gotten so perfect thanks to it. Could I make it even more so? My eyes quickly shifted to the left for less than half a second, reflecting on when I&#39;d next be able to use it without my awe-inspiringly handsome landlord being around. <br />
<br />
Just as I finished my mental sentence, Larry&#39;s booming laugh echoed through the room, “Oh, look at that. Your pervy book&#39;s still out, you were probably smelling the load I shot in it, weren&#39;t you? Can&#39;t help but wonder what you wrote in it before I came back.” Instantly panicked, I barely registered the trail of precum left on my face by Larry&#39;s tool as he walked over me towards my desk. Part of me was scared of what Larry could do with it, the other, nothing short of happy he&#39;d find out he could do what he wanted with it. Slowly, I turned around, still kneeling on the floor, “I- I was, Sir. It&#39;s- It&#39;s just that your- your cum smells so-”<br />
<br />
“I know, faggot. You don&#39;t have to say it, you love the hog and all it can do, I get it,” interrupted me. There could have been an attempt to distract Larry from the book, but it was too late. He was reading it, his left hand touching the open page. “Jason, come sit here, and don&#39;t you fucking move.” The sound of his right hand patting the chair next to him resonated in my mind.<br />
<br />
Unable to resist, I did so. My head was under his smelly armpit as he placed a hand on the back of the chair. A look of pleasure and mild discomfort drew itself on my face. On the paper, the most recent changes I did were now listed.<br />
<br />
–<br />
Jason Gray&#39;s penis percentile statistics in the presence of all human males:<br />
Penis size percentile (flaccid): 1st<br />
Penis size percentile (erect): 1st<br />
<br />
Average man&#39;s penis size statistics:<br />
Flaccid length averages at 6 to 8 inches, with a girth of around 6<br />
Erect sizes range, on average, from 7 to 15 inches, with an average circumference of 7<br />
–<br />
<br />
There was something weird about Larry as he read those lines, odder still, it wasn&#39;t a bad kind of weird. His brows were furrowed, focusing on the text. I&#39;d never seen him reflect on anything that way. Frankly, I don&#39;t remember ever seeing him read more than a few simple text messages on his phone.<br />
<br />
“Hey pipsqueak,” his face turning towards mine, his eyes reaching deep into me, entrancing me even, “this ain&#39;t no ordinary pervy book, right?” That was it, this was the end. Lying was definitely out of the question, Larry would know the moment my words left my mouth. My pulse quickened, my heartbeat thumping against my ribcage... My nub hardening at the thought of what he would write down.<br />
<br />
I took a deep breath, mumbling, “It ca- It can chan-” A sharp exhale left Larry&#39;s nose, “Louder, dumbass.”<br />
<br />
With slightly more power in my voice, a tinge of lust, a pinch of fear, I gave him what he wanted, “It ca- It changes things. You ask it to see things about stuff, and you can change that.” I was admitting defeat, but I was also giving him, this powerhouse of masculinity, the control part of me wanted to give him.<br />
<br />
Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Larry&#39;s cock stiffen after what I&#39;d just told him. A wide grin on his face, he picked up a pen. The first thing he did, was undo the change I&#39;d done about my dick.  “What the fuck&#39;s &#39;in the presence&#39;? &#39;Compared to&#39; makes more sense.” He scratched text away and wrote down its replacement, locking in my little dick to its current size. I&#39;d only put some thought earlier, but it seemed the possibility of Larry&#39;s cum soaking the pages made him able to change the book as he wished. “You don&#39;t need a thing bigger than that nub anyway. How small are your little balls...”</p>
