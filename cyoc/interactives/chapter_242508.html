<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Something inside Marcus felt different when he looked at the newly formed sentence on his phone. Marcus turned his eyes at the drinks he was carrying and listened how much fun his friends were having without him. Marcus felt annoyed as he was reminded how he always was the delivery boy or hype man for his friends. The alcohol had finally reached in Marcus’s brain. Which reminded him how he was a very insecure gay man who desired for love. Jim and Evan had their own boyfriends, so why couldn&#39;t Marcus find someone to love him.<br />
<br />
Marcus snapped his lips in disapproval as he didn’t like it all how Evan ordered him to fetch the drinks like a dog. Alcohol was making Marcus too emotional and irrational. He was sure that after his friends had received their drinks Marcus was going to be played like a fiddle in front of his friends and they would make sure that he was the first one to suffer the application’s transformation. Marcus didn’t wish for that to happen and wanted to make sure that the next change wasn’t something his friends couldn’t notice. Marcus then turned Evan’s and Jim’s awareness setting off for a moment and knew what type of sentence he was going to make.  <br />
<br />
Marcus typed, ‘Jim is fucking Evan&#39;s erected cock,’ on the application. He had modified the word ‘sucking’ to the word ‘fucking’ and then pressed enter to confirm the change. Marcus looked at the changed words again and noticed that he had made an error.<br />
<br />
“Wait a minute...” Marcus said while he read the text twice. “Jim is fucking Evan’s erected cock? What? How’s he going to do that…?”<br />
<br />
Marcus had wrongly interpreted the sentence. Marcus thought he had only changed the dick sucking into ass fucking. Now that he looked at the text again a lump of fresh saliva begun to form inside Marcus’s mouth. He knew that he had made a big mistake. He was sure that something weird was happening behind that door right now. Marcus put the awareness setting back for Evan and Jim, placed the phone carefully back into his pocket, took a deep breath and then knocked on the door with the secret knock.<br />
<br />
To Marcus’s surprise it was Jim who opened the door for Marcus and saw that Jim was completely naked. Marcus was too stunned by what he was seeing in front of him. Jim had to pull his stunlocked friend inside the karaoke room before the staff saw how much clothing they had on them. Marcus was baffled by the smell of booze and sex in the karaoke room. The whole vibe had gone from fun karaoke night with boys into a drinking and having sex without the beach. The karaoke machine was collecting dust on the side as there was a dusty blanket on top of it.<br />
<br />
Marcus noticed Evan gasping for air while he sat on top of the sofa without any clothes. Evan&#39;s average sized 4-inch dick had transformed and grown in size into a throbbing and veiny 15-inch cock which resembled a massive two liter plastic bottle. Marcus noticed how Evan’s and Jim’s clothes had been thrown all over the karaoke room&#39;s floor. Evan begun to rub his cock in excitement when Jim walked next to him and gave a small peck on Evan’s cheek. Evan stared Jim with submissive bedroom eyes. Marcus tried to give the small shot glass filled with vodka to Evan. Instead Evan laughed and raised his own drinking glass and took a big gulp from that cup.<br />
<br />
Marcus saw that Evan was too hammered and dazed to understand what was going on around him. Marcus lowered the drink he had in his hand and looked at the liquid inside it. He couldn’t believe how much Evan and Jim had changed.<br />
<br />
Jim seductively walked in front of Evan and suddenly begun to insert his average sized cock inside Evan’s thick urethra. Evan begun to moan in pleasure as he was being docked by Jim. Evan looked like a submissive bitch who was more than happy that Jim was fucking his chubby cock. Marcus couldn’t stop staring at Evan’s thick throbbing meatsicle while Jim’s cock went back and forth inside it. Marcus felt his own cock getting hard and forming a visible bulge in his trousers.<br />
<br />
Jim told Evan how much of a dirty slut Evan was right now by letting Jim to fuck him like a bitch. Marcus couldn’t believe his eyes and ears when the weird wet noises echoed in the room. Jim’s dirty words directed at Evan made Marcus feel butterflies inside his stomach. Marcus’s cock was hard when Jim called Evan a cock slut and dirty man-whore. Evan’s boyish and high-pitched moans as a response for Jim&#39;s comments made Marcus’s dick go even harder.<br />
<br />
Marcus was scared how much he had changed his best friends. The scene had snapped him back to the reality as it felt too unreal. The room had gained a very sweaty and sweet smell mixed with alcohol. Marcus couldn’t take his eyes off from Jim as he gave a wet kisses to Evan’s mouth and fucked Evan’s urethra like it was a gay man’s ass. Marcus believed that he had done something irreversible.<br />
<br />
Marcus sat down on the sofa, placed the drinks from his hands on to the glass table and looked around him. The despite the smell the room felt more cozier. The fabric on the sofa had gone from rough and cheap to more soft and silky like as if the whole room was meant for fucking. The windowless dark red and purple colored walls and dimly lit lights made Marcus feel more relaxed.<br />
<br />
“Maybe this is not as big of a deal as I think it is. Evan and Jim are still my friends…. I hope… Evan seems to be more submissive... which reminds me.” Marcus thought to himself and drank the vodka shot meant for Evan down his throat. “Sorry Evan. I think I need this shot of vodka more than you do right now.”<br />
<br />
Marcus looked at his friends, thought about his actions for a while and leaned deeper into the the sofa cushion. He didn’t expect that his friends would change this much but as the saying goes ‘once the toothpaste is out of the tube, there’s no way putting it back in’. Marcus didn’t want to blame himself what he had done to his friends and thought that the changes he made today was going to be the future Marcus’s problem.</p>
