<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A 50-year-old man is passing back and fourth in his living room, his name is “Taylor”, which is a unisex name. He has a the body of any average 50-year-old man: a beer belly, short gray hair, wrinkles and brown eyes. “Man... typical,” the man grumbles, “why do packages always take for ever to arrive?”<br />
He had ordered the Chronivac after reading what the program could do, with the program he&#39;ll finally be able to live out his sexual fantasy without worrying about prison or other consequences. The man grins as he runs through his plan in his head, first he plans to make himself a ten-year-old handsome boy, second he plans on making sure that he will never have to go to school, third he plans on making himself a billionaire so that he can forever be a 10-year-old, he hates being a grown up, being a child opens so many doors and with the Chronivac he can escape any kind of trouble.<br />
<br />
Taylor has a dark secret, no one knows about it and he has it under control, but the sexual urge is strong and he is unsure for how long he can keep it under control. So, hearing about this program made him feel relieved, with it he can finally live out his dark fantasy/secret without worrying about consequences, because you see: Taylor is sexually attracted towards children, especially boys.<br />
<br />
The door bell rings, tearing Taylor out of his thoughts, he walks over to his front door and looks through the peephole, seeing a delivery man holding a package in his hands, standing on his porch. Taylor opens the door, “finally,” he says, a little irritated.<br />
<br />
The delivery man looks apologetic at Taylor, “sorry about the delay, sir,” he says, “the traffic is crazy today and I am the only one who is working today, because my colleges are either on holiday or ill... or just lazy assholes.”<br />
<br />
Taylor takes the package from the man, “damn... well sorry for snapping like that,” he says, “I always had no patience, I know you guys don&#39;t have the easiest job.”<br />
<br />
The delivery man smiles, “thanks... yeah... well, at least I have a job,” he says, “I have a wife and four boys who need my full support.”<br />
<br />
Hearing this Taylor becomes really interested, “if you don&#39;t mind me asking: how old are your boys?”<br />
<br />
“Ben is  six, Jaden is 10, Brandon is 16 and Ashley, “Ash” for short, is also 16 and he and Brandon are twins,” the man says.<br />
<br />
“Well, those are difficult ages,” Taylor says, chuckling, &#39;I&#39;d like to meet the boys,&#39; he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“Tell me about it,” the man says with a sigh.<br />
<br />
“My name is “Taylor” by the way,” Taylor says, holding out his hand.<br />
<br />
“Carl, nice to meet you,” he says, taking Taylor&#39;s offered hand with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Same,” Taylor says with a smile back, “if you ever need someone to take care of the kids, let me know. I have a nephew who is named after me, he visits me a lot, I think he&#39;d like to meet your boys, he is ten.”<br />
<br />
Carl thinks for a while, “that would be a huge help,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Here, let me write my number down,” Taylor says, he hurries inside and grabs a pen and paper, he smirks as he write down his number. &#39;Hehe... I&#39;ll have so much fun with those four boys,&#39; he thinks to himself. He then heads back to Carl and hands him the note, “here, call me when you need my help or when your boys want to meet my nephew.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Taylor,” Carl says, taking the note, “well, I better be on my way,” he then says and turns to leave.”<br />
<br />
“Wait,” Taylor says, Carl turns back around to see Taylor holding out a twenty Dollar note, “for your hard work, you deserve it,” he says with a smile.<br />
<br />
Carl&#39;s eyes widen, “thanks Taylor, I&#39;ll boy me some beer on you,” he says with a smile, Taylor smiles back and watches the man leave, grinning evilly, then he closes the door.<br />
<br />
Taylor hurries straight for his laptop, which is in his bedroom. He tears open the package and takes out the DVD containing the Chronivac and inserts the CD into his laptop, which is already running, and starts the installing process. “10 fucking hours,” Taylor groans as he sees the time the installation requires, “oh well, then I&#39;ll start to create my new life tonight or tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
As the night comes Taylor checks the installation process and smiles as he sees that there are only five minutes left. After the time runs out there is a “ping” sound and a window pops up “installation successful”. Taylor immediately attaches the scanner and activates it, a window pops up “please stand further away until the light on the device turns from red to orange.” The man follows the instruction and moves to the middle of his room and stops as the light turns orange, a new message pops up, “thanks, please stand still,” it says. A red beam shoots out from the device and moves up and down the man&#39;s body, then with a “ping” the light turns green and a window pops up, the message reading “scan complete”. Taylor walks back to his laptop and sits on his chair, he grins wide as he sees his profile on the screen:<br />

<br />
And some open fields, the man assumes they are to type in extras. Taylor does not hesitate and starts to edit his stats:<br />
<br />

<br />
After checking his edits, Taylor nods and smiles happily, he moves the mouse to the confirm button and grins as he confirms the settings, “good bye old life, hello new and better life,” he says, he then stands up and walks over to his full length mirror. The man strips out of his clothes, to be able to enjoy the transformation and watch how his body changes.<br />
<br />
As Taylor stares into the mirror, he notices that his hair starts to look thicker and fuller, his bald patch filling with hair as his hair turns from gray to blond. With a smile the man reaches a hand up to his head and strokes his new hair, “what a wonderful feeling,” he says out loud, “the program really works,” the man beams. He then notices that he is starting to look younger in the face and he is sure he looks a lot shorter. Taylor continues to watch as his body regresses, his beer belly “deflating” his tummy becoming nice an flat. His body hair on his arms, face, legs, butt, torso, chest, arm pits and privates all retreat back into his body, leaving behind soft-silky-smooth skin. Taylor&#39;s arms, hands and feet shrink and his thighs and shins slim a little, his butt firms, lifting itself up, giving the soon-to-be new boy a nice healthy bubble butt. Soon, where Taylor the 50-year-old once stood, a young ten-year-old boy stands with a grin on his face. Seeing himself as a kid causes his penis to harden, his grin widens, “darn... I&#39;m a sexy and handsome boy,” he says and giggles when hearing his ten-year-old voice.<br />
<br />
The new boy looks over, to where he left his grown up clothes, he smiles as he sees that the boring and plain adult clothes have transformed into colorful kid&#39;s clothes, suitable for a ten-year-old. Taylor, still naked, walks over to his closet and opens it, he beams as he sees that all his clothes and even shoes have transformed into kid&#39;s clothes and shoes. The boy takes out a Sponge Bob Squarepants onezie and puts it on, letting out a soft moan of pleasure as the material glides over his hairless body. “Tomorrow, the real fun can begin,” he says to himself as he climbs into his bed. Taylor soon falls asleep with a huge smile on his face, while he&#39;s sleeping his room morphes around him and in a few minutes his room has transformed into a room suitable for a ten-year-old boy.</p>
