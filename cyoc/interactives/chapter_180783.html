<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some cleaning up Dylan and Kenny snuck back outside amongst the family.  Kenny seemed to have closed up a bit, the embarrassment from “peeing” (later explained more in detail by Dylan) all over his cousin was really eating him up.<br />
<br />
After more jokes and familial catching up Dylan overheard that most of the men in the family were going up the hot springs tomorrow.  They were open to everyone but younger kids in the family would often just stay at the cabin.  Dylan thought it best to sit out that sausage fest.  He had experienced enough of his male family members to last him a lifetime.<br />
<br />
——<br />
<br />
The next morning Dylan overslept,  a note from his father reaffirmed that the men did indeed head to the springs. <br />
<br />
Dylan thought it best to just try to find some of the younger kids and try to kill time by babysitting them for their swapped moms.  He may have been young, but he could still manage the the kids below Kenny’s age.  <br />
<br />
As he excited the room he crossed paths with his cousin Dave.  They hadn’t seen each other in years and didn’t get a chance to catch up in the hustle and bustle of swap day.  Usually Dave was 25 year old drifter who went backpacking a lot to “find himself.”  Dylan always that it was just an excuse to party non-stop.  He was surprised he even came this year considering he was a pretty good looking guy.  Why bother swapping with someone for a week?  This year Dave just so happened to have been swapped into the body of Dylan’s father, Clyde.  <br />
<br />
“Oh hey Dylan, you heading over to the springs?”<br />
<br />
Dylan was surprised that someone straight up addressed him by his actual name, as opposed to saying son like “Kenny, oh sorry you’re Dylan right?” Or something else along those lines.<br />
<br />
“Haha very funny Dave.  Me, going to a bath house looking like this? Just tell dad and Uncle Frank I sad hi.”<br />
<br />
“Woah what’s with the sass cuz?  It was an honest question.  Wait, does this have something to do with your swap?  You’re still moping about that?” <br />
<br />
“Dave can you just leave me alone?  You already look like my dad you don’t need to speak like him to.”<br />
<br />
“Now wait up, it’s been awhile, and we should catch up.  Come on, I have tons of stories from my trips I wanna tell you! Plus I think it’ll be a good way to get your mind off things.”<br />
<br />
Dylan’s sighed.  “You’re not going to take no for an answer are you?”<br />
<br />
Dave crossed his arms, “Nope, now why don’t you listen to your father and grab some trunks.  You and I are heading to the springs!  Trust me, you definitely need this more than me.”<br />
<br />
——<br />
<br />
Dylan trudged behind Dave, who essentially forced him to go to the bathhouses with a towel around his waist.... ONLY a towel.  Apparently that’s all the clothing that’s allowed up there. <br />
<br />
The springs were ancient, built and maintained by the heads of family who had vacation homes built around the area.  The water fed into several pools and saunas, one of which was Dylan and Dave were currently sitting in together.<br />
<br />
Dylan was relieved that all the other men were apparently at the pools at that moment.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm yeah that’s good, nothing like fresh steam, am I right cuz? Your dad really needs to relax his body some more, so tense.”<br />
<br />
Dave looked over at Dylan, clearly bored out of his mind and waiting for time to pass. <br />
<br />
“You know what cuz, you’re really not seeing how good you have it right now.”<br />
<br />
Dylan’s laughed at the absurdity of his cousins statement, “Really.  What makes you say that?”<br />
<br />
“You got Kenny, he’s a good kid, scratch that, a GREAT kid that doesn’t have a mean or selfish bone in his body.  I know because I crashed at his dad’s place for a bit while I was traveling. Don’t know Kenny turned out so good considering he’s Uncle Frank’s kid.  That man lovesss poking fun at people every year.”<br />
<br />
“Definitely, you should have seen him when he greeted me and my dad.  The guy looked at me like a meal!”  Dylan said.<br />
<br />
“Sounds like something he would do.” Dave chuckled.  “Here me out cuz.  All you gotta do is just stick to Kenny like glue.  He’ll enjoy your company, look up to you.”  Dave chucked to himself again.  “Well, metaphorically anyway.”<br />
<br />
Dylan just rolled his eyes at his cousin’s comment. “And set myself up for constant jokes and comparisons from the family?  Yeah, I think I’ll pass.” <br />
<br />
“I get it, it’ll be awkward as hell, but if people see you’re taking all this as casually as they are, they’ll go back to obsessing over their own swaps.”<br />
<br />
Dylan pondered his cousin’s words. Maybe he was right?  Maybe they are all just weirdos that love to watch him be humiliated.  He wouldn’t put it beneath them...”Well, I guess you have a point.  What exactly do you have in mind?”<br />
<br />
“Well let me just start with-.”  And in one swift motion Dave yoinked Dylan’s towel.<br />
<br />
“H-hey what the hell, give that back!” Dylan screeched as he tried to cover himself with his hands. <br />
<br />
“I don’t think so, first thing you gotta deal with is acceptance, or at the very least, some convincing tolerance.   Nudity is allowed here in the hot springs, hell, it’s even allowed at the cabin! Don’t worry about anyone teasing you about that.”<br />
<br />
“Nudity?!  I wouldn’t walk around naked even if I was in my own body, now just give me that towel!”<br />
<br />
Dave held the towel up out of his cousin’s limited reach. He was starting to lose his patience.  “Now look Dylan, do you want to somewhat enjoy this week, or do you want to remain the highlight of the year that everyone won’t shut up about?”<br />
<br />
“I-! I... I want to NOT entirely hate this week if that’s possible.”  Dylan let out a sigh of defeat. “Fine Dave, we can try things your way.”<br />
<br />
“Good, now move those little hands and own that tic-tac dick.”<br />
<br />
Dylan was visibly irritated by his cousin’s phrasing but obeyed.<br />
<br />
“There, Happy?” <br />
<br />
“That’s more like it!  But you still failed that test.”  Dave casually replied. <br />
<br />
“Ugh, What test? I did what you said!”<br />
<br />
“Tsk tsk, Look at you, you’re making it wayyy to easy for them.  Let me break it down for you.  You blushed, immediately tensed up, AND avoided eye contact with me as soon as you stopped covering yourself.  The whole family can smell that humiliation stuff a mile away and cuz, you reek of it.  I get it your situation is pretty degrading, but you and I both know you can’t let it be obvious.  I saw how you posed a bit after transformation.  That was perfect! The more people think you’re as into as they are, the more you’ll blend in, and the easier this vacation will be.”<br />
<br />
Dylan groaned but nodded his head in understanding.<br />
<br />
“Now let’s start get back to it.  With some cold turkey reality checks. Repeat after me:<br />
I have a prepubescent kid dick.”<br />
<br />
Dylan swallowed his pride and repeated the sentence.<br />
<br />
“I... have a prepubescent kid dick.” He uttered<br />
<br />
“A kid has my cock, and he’s the real man now.”<br />
<br />
“Kenny is a man, and I am just a boy.”<br />
<br />
Dylan rolled his eyes and repeated the previous sentences. <br />
<br />
“Good job cuz, last phrase:<br />
“Kenny may have my cock, Kenny may be a man, but he is also... a friend.”<br />
<br />
Dylan repeated the words, and really thought about them.  Kenny was a good kid, Dylan even smiled a bit remembering how apologetic the kid always was.  He definitely was a friend. <br />
<br />
“Great work cuz, now let’s go find Kenny.”<br />
<br />
“Wait what? He’s already here at the hot springs?!” <br />
<br />
“Well yeah, I’m assuming since I saw Frank strutting around here in his new beefy body that he wouldn’t leave his football hunk of son too far behind.”  Dave winked.  “Now let’s get a move on Mr. Tic-tac dick!”  Dave said as started leaving the steam room.  <br />
<br />
——-<br />
<br />
As the pair  made theirbway through the halls they stumbled upon what looked like a distraught Kenny in Dylan’s body pacing back in forth in his towel.  His face perked up when he saw them.<br />
<br />
“Cousin Dylan, you came!”<br />
<br />
Kenny was about to go in for a hug when he noticed Dave. <br />
<br />
“It’s ok Kenny, this is cousin Dave, he swapped with my dad this year.”<br />
<br />
“Wow really, Dave!  I’ve missed you!  Oh man daddy didn’t give me a chance to say Hi to you earlier.  I could’ve ridden on your shoulders before I got all big.”  Kenny huffed.<br />
<br />
“Haha it’s ok Kenny, I promise you I’ll do that after the week is over.  Don’t think Dylan’s dad is capable of lifting his own son like that.” Dave laughed.<br />
<br />
“Hey um Kenny are you alone anyway?”  Dylan asked.<br />
<br />
“I um, well daddy wanted me to come but I told him I had to go the restroom so I haven’t gone to the hot pool yet.  I’m kinda scared.”<br />
<br />
Dave nudged Dylan and gave him a knowing wink.  He knew what to do. <br />
<br />
“Hey um Kenny, if you’re still uncomfortable with all this body swapping you can just stick with me, ok?  We can be like “body buddies” or something.”  Dylan couldn’t believe what he was saying. “Body buddies.” Seriously?<br />
<br />
“Really?  You mean it?!”  Kenny said positively bursting with excitement.<br />
<br />
“Yeah absolutely.  Actually I also wanted to ask, would you like to help me mess with the some of the older family guys?”<br />
<br />
“Sure Dylan, anything!  What do you want to do?” <br />
<br />
Dave chimed it. “Oh I got some great ideas you two, just listen up, here’s the plan.” ....<br />
<br />
———-<br />
<br />
The adult men (and some swapped women) were all relaxing by one of the hot pool rooms.  Dylan’s father and Frank were two of the biggest talkers and seen as heads of their respective branches of the family.  They were just recounting stories of past years when Dylan and his two cousins entered the room.<br />
<br />
“Well if it isn’t are star crossed swappers!  Oh and is that Dave?  Nice of you to bring my body here, the hot water does wonders on my back.” Clyde said.<br />
<br />
Dave laughed. “You’re definitely right about that Uncle Clyde.”<br />
<br />
“Hey Dylan what’s with the towel, still a “little” shy? Whoops, didn’t mean to imply any there there.”  The men all started laughing at the comment from Dylan’s Great Uncle Ted, who was currently in his early 20s and clearly feeling a little cocky. <br />
<br />
“Actually I was just about to ditch it.”  Dylan tossed his towel over to Ted. “Ok guys, let’s all get the giggles out of the way. You can all even take turns cracking jokes if want.  Though I think we should remember what things are really like when there’s no magic stone involved.”<br />
<br />
Dylan then tugged on Kenny’s towel, signaling that he wanted to tell him something.  Kenny knelt down so that Dylan could whisper something into his ear.  A brief look of surprise flashed across Kenny’s face, but he simply nodded and stood back up and cleared his throat. <br />
<br />
“Don’t forget who’s body this belongs to guys.”  Kenny said in Dylan’s voice, but for the first time since the swap, he was speaking with an aura of confidence.  He let the towel drop and slowly worked his large cock to full mast. <br />
<br />
“Hey Ted pick your jaw off the ground that’s my son.”  Clyde playfully jabbed as the crowed turned and laughed at Ted.<br />
<br />
“Shut him right up.” Dylan thought to himself, proud of Kenny’s little performance.<br />
<br />
“Still don’t get why we let kids in here.  Ain’t this all a little mature for your son here Frank?”  Ted said trying to change the subject.<br />
<br />
“Oh don’t worry about my son Phil.  I think the whole point of the cabin transcends age.  Same goes for Dylan here.  My grandpa told me stories about the times when the entire family was nude the whole time they were at the cabin.  We’re just going back to our roots is all.”<br />
<br />
Frank turned to look at his now stud of a man Kenny.<br />
“Hey son, you enjoy your time with your cousin and uh, be sure to ask him about “the talk” since your in his body now.  If he’s gonna be your little “mentor” or whatever then better he do it than me am I right guys?” <br />
<br />
Some of the men began to snicker at Frank’s remark.  Dylan got serious, he  was going to show them he wasn’t going to be their little joke all week...</p>
