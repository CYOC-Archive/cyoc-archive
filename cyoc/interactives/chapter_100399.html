<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter Talbot led Karen Yuletide deeper into the woods surrounding Moon Lake College. Every so often, he paused to sniff the air, but was never satisfied with whatever he smelled until the last time he did so.<br />
&quot;This is a good spot,&quot; he announced, setting his tote bag down while turning to look at his date. &quot;We&#39;re totally alone here. I don&#39;t smell even an old trace of another were for miles. Now then, please strip and put everything inside your tote bag.&quot;<br />
&quot;HUH?&quot; asked Karen, uncertain if she heard Peter correctly.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a relatively nice night for late October. We&#39;re by ourselves, and you do want your next lesson in being a were, let alone a werelioness, right?&quot; Peter asked her, to which all Karen could do was nod. &quot;Then please take off all your clothing and put them in the empty tote bag I asked you to bring with you,&quot; he requested again.<br />
<br />
There was nothing within Peter&#39;s voice that made her scared or frightened, but something told Karen that he would not take &quot;No&quot; for an answer. Besides, under the right circumstances, she had always been something of an exhibitionist, and maybe doing this would arouse her date and lead them to further pleasures.<br />
With that, she slowly and seductively began undressing before Peter, hoping he would release his inner werelion and make her his.<br />
Shoes and socks first, followed by untucking her shirt tail, before unbuckling her pants. Then she started wiggling her hips a little to let the pants slip down as she slowly pulled the shirt up and over her head.<br />
The shirt landed in the tote bag as she stepped out of her pants. With everything now in the tote except her underwear, Karen never bothered to turn around or feign modesty as she reached up and cupped her breasts before undoing the front clasp.<br />
As she pulled her bra off, freeing her C size tits, her hands slid down her waist, before continuing onward toward her knees, snagging the waist band of her panties and taking them along for the journey.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, even after she was totally nude before him, Peter Talbot remained fully dressed, although Karen Yuletide couldn&#39;t help noticing the slight budge within his pants.<br />
&quot;Ear rings and your wristwatch too, please. Most weres are unable to wear jewelry of any kind in their fursonas,&quot; pointed out Peter.<br />
Having gone this far, Karen did as requested, tossing the accessories on top of her clothes within the tote bag.<br />
&quot;Now then, I&#39;ll hold that for you,&quot; Peter said in a very kind voice, as he grabbed the tote bag holding her things. &quot;What I would like you to do now is to stand there, close your eyes, and concentrate on your feelings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen did so, hoping Peter wasn&#39;t stealthy enough to sneak off with her things without her hearing him and leaving her alone in this vulnerable position.<br />
What Karen didn&#39;t know was that Peter <i>was</i> stealthy enough to walk completely around her without her knowing it, drinking in the vision of the nude beauty before him, and getting more turned on by the moment.<br />
Her shapely hips, smooth curves, long legs for a relatively short woman (compared to him), pert breasts with nipples at full attention, and shoulder length blonde hair were all fantastic attractions, and Peter felt his lion demanding to be released. However, he refused to do so, no matter how much he wanted to.<br />
After a couple of minutes of leaving Karen like she was, Peter said, &quot;Now then, while keeping your eyes closed, tell me what you feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen thought about that for a moment before replying. &quot;There is a slight breeze. Not real warm, but far from cold either. I can feel my hair move occasionally as it blows against my back. Every once in a while I get a tingly sensation, like goosebumps, on my flesh. My nipples are hard, but whether that&#39;s from my surroundings or the more exotic nature of this moment, I can&#39;t say. I can feel the grass under my feet and between my toes. Not completely dry, but far from dewy. And between my legs—&quot;<br />
&quot;I get the idea,&quot; said Peter, interrupting her, for he had already sniffed that heady aroma more than he should have. &quot;Now then, you can open your eyes again as I explain the purpose of this exercise.&quot;<br />
Karen did so, and saw that Peter hadn&#39;t been idle while she stood there. There was now a blanket on the ground, with a couple of plastic containers and bottles of water resting in one corner; all things that she guessed had come from Peter&#39;s tote bag.<br />
But he was still fully dressed. <i>Dang it!</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Most weres depend upon all their senses when out and about, not just sight,&quot; he began, reaching over to hold her hands in his. &quot;I didn&#39;t bother asking you about scents or sounds, for a normal person&#39;s sense of smell and hearing is far less than that of a were&#39;s. Nothing personal, just a fact of life.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; replied Karen, actually beginning to understand the point of tonight.<br />
&quot;Sight, hearing, smell, tactile sensations... They&#39;re all important to any were. Knowing where you are, who or what might be nearby. While life in Moon Lake is far less dangerous than anywhere else in the world, you never know when an enemy might be stalking you and preparing to pounce. Case in point. While you have yet to meet your roommate&#39;s family, you know they are a potential enemy and are taking steps to guard you and yours against them when they come for the wedding next weekend,&quot; said Peter.<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; said Karen, nodding her head in agreement, &quot;but do weres have many enemies, let alone the werelions?&quot;<br />
&quot;There really isn&#39;t much bigger or stronger than a werelion. Yet, any were&#39;s biggest fear is still the fear of discovery by an outside world that wouldn&#39;t understand who and what we truly are, which is why some guard Moon Lake as the sanctuary it is more actively than others,&quot; revealed Peter. &quot;But there is a difference between vigilance and paranoia. There are a lot of dangers even in the plain human world, such as pickpockets, muggers, rapists, and more. You never blindly went out and about before you came to Moon Lake, did you Karen?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I didn&#39;t. But I didn&#39;t let my concerns interfere with my life either,&quot; pointed out Karen.<br />
&quot;Neither do I,&quot; said Peter. &quot;Just because I am alert, doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t enjoy life either. Like right now. I am loving our conversation and the view as I talk to the beautiful, naked woman before me. Yet I am also aware that the closest thing to our present position is a sleeping family of squirrels in that tree over my left shoulder.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Karen, looking over Peter&#39;s left shoulder in a vain attempt to see the squirrels for herself, even as she realized, <i>He thinks I&#39;m beautiful.</i><br />
&quot;Even if you do not decide to become a werelioness,&quot; <i>which would greatly disappoint me,</i> realized Peter, &quot;or any other type of were, I would at least like to leave you wiser than when we first met. For my own peace of mind if nothing else.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere,&quot; said Karen, as she closed the gap between herself and Peter to give him a long, passionate kiss.<br />
Peter embraced her, running his hands along her bare back, across her hips, and kneading Karen&#39;s butt cheeks; before he finally managed to get himself (some what) back under control and broke the kiss.<br />
&quot;As <b>very</b> enjoyable as that is, perhaps we should have dinner now,&quot; he suggested. &quot;It&#39;s just BLTs from the campus commissary though.&quot;<br />
Karen never commented on the blush that was rapidly spreading across Peter&#39;s facial cheeks. &quot;That will do, but should I get dressed first?&quot; she asked.<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Peter asked in return. &quot;Most weres don&#39;t wear clothing  when they&#39;re out and about in their fursonas.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good point,&quot; agreed Karen, as she sat down, naked, on the blanket.<br />
<br />
Over dinner, they talked some more. Peter had no idea where the extra mass for the various were features came from during a change, before Karen had him recall his very first time.<br />
&quot;I knew it was coming, but it did catch me by surprise. I was at a birthday party for one of my uncles when it started. I felt this warm, but pleasant feeling spread all over me as my fur started to spout. Then...&quot;<br />
Karen enjoyed the tale for the most part, but wasn&#39;t sure about when Peter recalled his folks had to hurriedly find a lioness to complete his first transformation.<br />
Then she asked about the changes that might occur to her &quot;regular&quot;, human appearance if she became a were.<br />
Peter explained that a-were-ness always altered things slightly. In Karen&#39;s case, her breasts might grow at least another cup size. Her eyes would definitely change color, which happened to everyone, depending upon their new species. Karen&#39;s body would become a bit more muscular, or at least toned. &quot;You might even gain an inch or two of height as well.&quot;<br />
&quot;But how, let alone why does it happen? You haven&#39;t actually met her yet, but there&#39;s a <i>drastic</i> difference in Jenny Harper&#39;s before and after as a werevixen; which is one of the reasons she fears her folks seeing the &#39;new&#39; her. I hate to say this, but the old Jenny would have had a hard time beating Olive Oyl in a beauty contest, but now looks like she was the big winner in the cosmetic surgery jackpot.&quot;<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re looking for a technical or scientific answer, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t give you one,&quot; admitted Peter, thankful he knew the media reference. &quot;However, becoming a were means becoming more than an ordinary human, which is why the transformation also alters the &#39;regular&#39; you to some extent. If your friend can get over the emotional trauma of delayed completeness and the crap you say her family is putting her through, I would say Jenny highly benefited from becoming a were. Although in your case Karen, there really isn&#39;t much room for improvement.&quot;<br />
&quot;REALLY?&quot; Karen asked with a big smile on her face. &quot;Thank you!&quot; she added, leaning over to kiss Peter again.<br />
<br />
Soon Peter Talbot found a naked Karen Yuletide lying on top of him, smothering him with kisses as she started to unbutton his shirt.<br />
As Karen started kissing her way down to tease the nipples of his chest, it was all he could do to keep from changing right then and there and claiming Karen as his own.<br />
&quot;No Karen. Please, stop,&quot; he requested, grabbing her hands in his and gently pulling her off him. &quot;When the time is right, if becoming a werelioness is truly what you want, let alone becoming <i>my</i> werelioness, then I will gladly not only make sweet, passionate love to you; but will happily usher you into were society as well,&quot; promised Peter, as he released her hands.<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; began Karen, laying her head on his hairy chest in such a way that she could hear his heart beat while she stared at him, &quot;you have been on my mind. A LOT,&quot; she admitted.<br />
&quot;And you on mine,&quot; he revealed.<br />
&quot;At night I lay in bed and think about the future. Me, you, us.&quot; Then she paused, before adding, &quot;Cubs.&quot;<br />
&quot;I remember your drawings,&quot; said Peter, staring deeply into her eyes. &quot;Have you drawn any more like that of late?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not on paper. But up here,&quot; she said, pointing at her brain, &quot;and in here,&quot; she added, pointing between her breasts at her heart. &quot;But I&#39;m still antsy about sharing you with other werelionesses if you want to go on the prowl.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not want. It would only be the physical need of a were&#39;s increased libido in action. It would <b>never</b> be any reflection upon whoever eventually becomes my wife,&quot; Peter reminded her.<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;d be lying to you if I said I wasn&#39;t hoping someday to be both to you. Lioness and wife,&quot; confessed Karen.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; revealed Peter, reaching up with his left hand to caress her facial cheek. &quot;That&#39;s part of the reason why we&#39;re taking this nice and slow, to make sure everything is right for both of us. But you are the most wonderful woman of any species it has ever been my privilege to meet, and whether or not you know it Karen, you have achieved a major accomplishment tonight.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh? What?&quot; asked Karen in surprise, raising her head enough to stare at Peter&#39;s full face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look further down,&quot; requested Peter, to which Karen sat up to do so.<br />
When she realized what he was talking about, Karen looked back at Peter and asked, &quot;Did I cause that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. You are the very first woman that I have ever felt such a strong desire for that it caused me to soil my pants,&quot; revealed Peter, as Karen looked again at the growing wet stain spreading from the large bulge pushing against the center of his zipper. <i>There really is something special about you Karen,</i> he realized.<br />
&quot;Guess I can&#39;t touch it without committing myself to becoming a were,&quot; she realized.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid not,&quot; confirmed Peter, neither of them doing much to hide the sadness in their voices.<br />
&quot;Well, there is an honor I can bestow upon you tonight too,&quot; said Karen, as she reached up and stuck a fingertip between Peter&#39;s lips.<br />
<br />
Peter Talbot had not been paying attention to what Karen had been doing with her hands, but quickly realized where they had been as he tasted what he thought of as delicious cream on her finger.<br />
As he licked her finger clean, Karen said, &quot;Whether or not I ever do become your lioness, there&#39;s plenty more where that came from if you&#39;re ever interested,&quot; she added with a smile.<br />
&quot;I never said I wasn&#39;t interested,&quot; pointed out Peter, and soon Karen found her boyfriend between her legs, licking away at the juicy slit that kept getting moister and wetter through multiple orgasms, until she heard him start to growl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Must... s-stop... n-now,&quot; said Peter, almost in pain, as Karen saw his lion mane start to recede. &quot;I truly thank you for the precious gift you shared with me tonight,&quot; he added, while standing up. He also knew, but never mentioned, that he didn&#39;t sense any werelion on her, so Karen was still completely human.<br />
For now.<br />
<br />
When Pete stood up, Karen saw that not only was the stain between his legs bigger, but that his pants and shirt were starting to break at the seams!<br />
<i>Guess he almost changed and claimed me on the spot,</i> she thought with a smile, as Karen stood up and started to get dress.<br />
&quot;As soon as you are ready, holler and I will return to walk you back to your dorm,&quot; said Peter, before hurrying off further into the woods to be alone for a few minutes.<br />
<i>I&#39;ve still got to either get over this hang up about sharing you, or prove I&#39;m woman and lioness enough that you don&#39;t need anyone else; but either way, you&#39;re mine Peter Talbot!</i> Karen Yuletide thought with a smile, not bothering to put her bra back on as she dressed.</p>
