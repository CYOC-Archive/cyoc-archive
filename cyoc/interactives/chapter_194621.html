<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not really being able to talk to Russel, Isaac made sure to write a letter telling Russel about how this was suppose to work. The letter was long and was basically lecturing Russel for bringing home the guy the previous night. The letter was taped to the bathroom mirror so Russel would see it as soon as the transformation completed.<br />
	<br />
Russel slowly came down from the high. The transformation always made he shoot a massive load at the mirror and this included the letter. Giving it a quick perusal, Russel could only grimace and roll his eyes after reading. Taking the letter, he initially use it to help clean up the mirror.<br />
	<br />
Jumping in the shower, Russel could not help but be pissed that Isaac dared to give him a lecture. Distracting himself for the moment, Russel admired the way that his muscles were always engorged after the transformation completed. If he could change one thing though, Russel wished he could get rid of his big belly. This brought the idea of taking a few extra pills. He knew that it would delay the transformation by six hours for each pill. Taking the extra pills would let him get some clothes that would actually fit. Getting out of the shower, Russel headed over to the bathroom counter and opened the bottle of pills. Russel knew that it was Friday and that Isaac would be having a day off on Saturday and did not have to worry about classes, so Russel grabbed two more pills and swallowed.<br />
	<br />
Not expecting anything to happen, Russel eyes widened after hearing a gurgling sound from his stomach and watched as he belly shrink. Pulling on his boxers and pants, Russel found that he had gone down a whole pant size at the waist, but after getting on the scale, he also found that he had not lost any weight. Russel scratched at the stubble on his face trying to figure out how that was possible. Putting on his staff shirt, Russel immediately noticed that the sleeves of his shirt punched up above his biceps, and his pectorals where filling out more of his shirt then before.<br />
	<br />
Shrugging his shoulders, which caused the seams of the shirt to protest, Russel figured that he already needed some better fitting clothes, so now he had even more reason to buy clothes that fit him better.<br />
	<br />
Heading into work, Russel kept jumping between two lives of though. The first one was the fact that he wished Isaac would get a truck. However, the second line of thinking was far more prevalent. When Isaac again transformed, would Russel still be more fit? Arriving, Russel put that idea to the back of his mind.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, though Russel was not to busy that night and the kid hadn’t come to the club again. He was a little disappointed, because the kid had a very fuckable ass, but Russel consoled himself with the knowledge he would have almost the entire day. <br />
	<br />
What surprised Russel when he got up just before the sunrise was how much he enjoyed watching the sun beginning to illuminate his part of the world. He could not remember the last time Isaac had taken the pills to where Russel was awake in the morning. Drinking a cup of black coffee, Russel sat o his balcony and enjoyed the extra time he had.<br />
	<br />
Over the course of the day, Russel got some pants that truly fit and different types of shirts. The shirts where mainly tank tops and t-shirts, but he also got a few button down plaids. He ended his shopping spree with a few sets of athletic clothes and a pair of sneakers.<br />
	<br />
As the hour was approaching for when Isaac would reemerge, Russel realized that Isaac would have to take the pills in less then an hour for Russel to make it to work. Russel considered this. “I might as well just take two more and then write the kid a note. Would serves him right for that stupid letter.”<br />
	<br />
Grabbing the bottle from off the shelf, Russel swallowed two more the pills. To his surprise and delight, Russel’s belly gave off more gurgling sounds, however, instead of loosing a full pant size, Russel found that his Wrangler jeans were only a little less tight. Turing to the mirror, Russel scrutinized himself and thought that he saw his shoulders flared out slight more, but he wasn’t sure. <br />
	<br />
With a final scratch of his now full but short beard, Russel headed out to go to work. He was glad that his hair was only going hair at his temples and the rest of his hair and beard were still black; he like seeing this in the review mirror. The other thing he was grateful for was he had yet to go bald. Since he guest he was fifteen to twenty years Isaac’s senior, he usually said that he was forty.<br />
	<br />
As he sat in the sedan on his way to work, Russel had a serious urge to take some more pills and buy a truck the next day, but he decided not after thinking about the fact he had not been Isaac for over an entire day.<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
Standing a door in the night club, Russel was not paying attention to most of the people going in or coming out. It was only when heard someone calls his name that he came out of his musings.<br />
	<br />
“Yoa, Russel. What you thinking ‘bout?” Carl asked coming to stand beside Russel. “You’ve been all quiet and shit all night. Having problems with your latest fuck boy?”<br />
	<br />
“Naw, nothing like that. All the boys wish they could be so lucky to have me just for one night.”<br />
	<br />
“Well. Then what’s up, man?”<br />
	<br />
“Just thinking about the nephew of mine. He’s being a total pain in my ass.”<br />
	<br />
“Dude, I didn’t know you had family. I thought you just grew out of a shit pile or something.” Carl teased<br />
	<br />
Punching the man in the arm, Russel replied, “Dumbass, of course I got family. Just not much. That’s the reason I’m having trouble, my nephew is basically all I got. It’s just he is making all these demands and just expecting me to follow orders. He’s just a little piss ant twat, though.”<br />
	<br />
“Well then just tell him to shove it just is asshole.”<br />
<br />
———<br />
<br />
Arriving back at the apartment, Russel quickly wrote out a letter to Isaac. In the letter he included a reminder to Isaac that while they both worked, it was Russel’s income being a bouncer that paid for Isaac’s school and the apartment. So while Russel was off the next night, Isaac better make sure to remember to take his pills. Russel then explained in a few sentences that he had taken the extra doses.<br />
	<br />
Reading through the letter for a once over, he then taped it to the mirror and waited for the transformation to Isaac to begin. The warm sensation began to flow throughout his body. Russel always hated this sensation, but he did not take anymore pills.<br />
	<br />
Taking is hard cock in his hands, he watched as his beard receded into his face along with the rest of his body hair. Next, he felt to sensation of shrinking as his height reduced from its six and a half feet to Isaacs’ five feet and ten inches. While his body degreased in height, his muscle appeared to deflate. His shoulders grew narrow and his pectoral muscles pulled into his chest. The callouses his hands disappeared and his voice rose from his deep base to Isaac’s youthful tenor. Jaw rounding and wrinkles vanishing, Isaac’s boyish face formed as the eyes changed from dark brown to baby blue. With a final tensing of the body, Russel moaned as his cock and balls seemed to shrivel in his hands and the cum sprayed out covering Isaac’s young form.<br />
	<br />
With a gasp, Isaac opened his eyes and looked over at the mirror. He saw the letter attached to the mirror. Not wanting to touch it while covered in Russel’s seed, Isaac took a quick shower. <br />
	<br />
After pulling on his pants, Isaac grabbed to letter and began to read. As Isaac read the note, fear slowly crept up his spine with his eyes widening. He wanted to be angry that Russel had taken two extra doses and stolen Isaac’s time, but Isaac could only feel icy fingers wrapping around his heart.</p>
