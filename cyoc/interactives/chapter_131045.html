<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly, you seize up and begin to spasm, arching your back and thrashing your limbs uncontrollably. Next to you, the same thing is happening to Emilio and Zephyr. Your audience does not seem too concerned, however. The scientist simply keeps his eyes on the monitoring screens.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds that seem like hours, the sensation changes. Warmth spreads over your body, and you start to pant, sweat soaking your skin. Between your legs, you feel a pressure build up, and your gown forms a rather embarrassing tent, soon mirrored by Emilio. Zephyr has her own protrusions, small nubs poking out her gown over her heaving breasts.  <br />
<br />
“They’ve now entered the arousal stage,” the scientist announces.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, your movements become more rhythmic as pleasure now washes over you. All three of you moan, growing ever more desperate for release. Surprisingly, your own shaved scalp rapidly sprouts luxurious red hair that tumbles over your headset and spreads out over your bed behind you. Body hair also tumbles loose from your newly flawless skin, leaving you silky smooth all over except for some nicely thinned eyebrows. Your companions mirror your changes. Zephyr’s former mane is more than replaced by stunning ebony waves while Emilio’s curtain of caramel shimmers with golden reflected light.  <br />
<br />
You and Emilio then shrink a bit as your skeletons and muscles become more delicate. Hips pop out while waists cave in, and a heart-shaped layer of padding adorns both your rears. Even though your heights have obviously decreased, your legs retain much of their length albeit with a few more contours to catch the eye.  <br />
<br />
“Are you sure this is going as planned, doctor?” The man in the suit asks. “Cuz this is looking awful familiar.”<br />
<br />
“Certainly, sir,” the scientist coolly assures him. “This part is necessary.”<br />
<br />
Barely registering their words, you hiss, “Sssssomebody, h-help me!” You arch again, raising your hips to make it quite clear what kind of help you want. Despite being rock hard, your equipment seems shorter than expected. Your horrified face ripples with further adjustments, forming an angelic visage to match your model-worthy body. A gasp escapes your puffy pink lips, a much softer sound than your earlier plea, no doubt an effect of your slender neck devoid of any Adams apple.<br />
<br />
“You’re doing just fine by yourself,” the scientist chuckles. “Now relax, and let it come.”<br />
<br />
At this point, Zephyr lets out a scream of ecstasy, her whole body going taut and her fingers and toes curling. By now, her body had gained quite a number of enhancements much like your own: a great figure, a gorgeous face, the works. Of course, your flat chest still lagged behind her DDs. But not for long.<br />
<br />
Hearing such a provocative sound sets off both you and Emilio. As one, you also pierce the air with girlish screams, making wet spots on your gowns before your manhoods retreat into new feminine openings. Swellings under your large nipples then blossom into full E cup breasts, completing the last of your extreme feminization.<br />
<br />
Your mind undergoes a similar transition. Thoughts slow down exponentially to be replaced by more basic urges. What little concept of self you have left is forcefully purged of any masculine qualities, leaving your mannerisms as cartoonishly female as your body. Twenty three years as a male fade into a forgotten dream, cumming out as one final orgasm forces the old you out and a very different person opens her eyes to take in the world. You have become a bimbo.<br />
<br />
Giggling reflexively, you turn to the former Emilio and smile. “Oh, y-you’re so…pretty!”<br />
<br />
“You, too!” She gushes back.<br />
<br />
“Who’re all these hunks?” Zephyr coos, licking her lips as she stares at the assembled men. Her question draws your attention back to the men, and you strain against your tethers, trying to reach them.<br />
<br />
The suited man steps forward with a scowl, ignoring your eager squeals. “Doctor! They’re nothing but bimbos! This was your last chance, and you’ve just-”<br />
<br />
“Steady there, my good man.” The scientist raised a hand. “It isn’t over just yet. Now comes the hard part.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, cutie,” you purr at him. “Wanna come here and-”<br />
<br />
Your invitation cuts short as a feeling of realization fires into your skull. The other two bimbos also jerk in place, lights blinking rapidly on their headsets. Mouth open in a silent scream, you squeeze your eyes shut as a giant tsunami of memories of your old life through your brain. At least, that’s what it feels like. When it stops, your head lolls onto your pillow. “Oh. Ow.. like, whats going on?&quot; you said as you remember your old male life. <br />
<br />
&quot; O.M.G. did i like  just said &#39;like&#39;, O.M.G. did i just say O.M.G.?&quot; you suddenly notice somethings that were off, like your girlish voice, a heavy feeling on your chest, and an urge to &quot;have fun&quot; with everyone you see. you suddenly look in the cornor of your eye to find a mirror, but instead of you was a tan, blonde, big breast, bubbly butt, curvy bimbo slut. it was weird, part of you wanted to freak out but another part wanted to masturbate with your self.<br />
<br />
just then one of the scientist walked up to you, proud of his accomplishment. &quot; so far the operation is a success.&quot; he said to the other scientists he then grabbed a few notes from a near by table a began to ask you a  few questions<br />
&quot; right then can you tell me your name?&quot; &quot; like, its uhh... dasiy.&quot; where did that come from you thought. &quot; uhh yes now can you tell me your real name?&quot; he ask again unsatisfied with my first answer.&quot; uhh its really danny.&quot; you said. &quot; good good, were you originally a man or a woman.&quot;  he ask. &quot; ohh uh i was like aaaa a man!&quot; it as if there was two minds in one brain and both were merging together. &quot; right then now tell me, what do you want to do?&quot; it was then clear that there were 2 minds in your head as you first said &quot; uh thats easy its to like, just survive the bimbopocay.. poca... the bimbo dooms day.&quot; and then coninued to say. &quot; and to like... sooo have some fun with people like you, ohh maybe try some lesbian fun too.&quot; why was this happening, you didnt know, but you had a feeling he did.<br />
<br />
The scientist smiles, making your heart flutter inside you. “Perfect. This experiment seems to be a success, so far. The others couldn’t even comprehend the question.”<br />
<br />
The man in the suit reluctantly backs down. “Alright, you succeeded, this time. But I want these new bimbos tested for any bugs. We need definite results and quickly!”&quot; yes sir.&quot; the suit guy said.<br />
<br />
&quot; uhh like excuse me. &quot; you said grabbing the attention of the scientist. &quot; but uhh it would be like sooooo great of you if you coud... COULD EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING ON?... or like, just fuck me silly.&quot;</p>
