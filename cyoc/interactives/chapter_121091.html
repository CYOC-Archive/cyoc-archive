<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben decided to go with the Clydesdale, one of the biggest horse breeds in the world. The 3D-image on the Chronivac showed that it couldn&#39;t even fit the area it was supposed to show the model in. No modifications were made to his own, human torso. It was just the sheer size of the horse that made it unable to fit in the picture. Ben clicked enter to confirm his choice and soon enough, the changes went underway.<br />
<br />
The changes were rapid, soon enough he lost feeling to his toes, as they slowly retracted into his feet, forming two hooves. The changes went from bottom to top, Ben noticed, as fur was now spreading from his ankles to his knees on each of his legs. The bones in his legs also were the first to start shifting, a process that felt a bit painful.<br />
<br />
slowly, more and more strands of hair were waving past his legs, as they were sprouting out of his back to form a tail. Ben noticed himself becoming taller, while underneath his belly button, two hard nubs stretched out of him, bringing some flesh with it, forming a second pair of legs. He started losing his balance and was forced to sit, maybe even lie down. The changes weren&#39;t even halfway though, when the typical feeling undergoing a transformation, seemed to fade.<br />
<br />
Ben looked down at himself. He saw how the extended flesh of his not fully formed front legs were stretched out in front of him. They weren&#39;t growing anymore, and now had the proportions that fit only the legs of a human toddler, but with hooves in the end. He poked them, but they didn&#39;t react nor returned any sense of feeling to him. They were just attached to him. Underneath were also legs, taller than usual, with hooves on their ends, but still looking more human than equine, despite the brown fur.<br />
<br />
Ben put on some leggings that were laying on his bed. They were able to fit over his hind legs, somewhat on the short size though. The tail behind him was also not far from just being a small nub, with a few strands of horse hair that did stand out.  A sorrowed feeling came over him, as he wanted to see what happened to the Chronivac. The size of his belly had stretched out into unhealthy proportions, so his point of balance made him unable to walk on only two legs. The outstretch was supposed to form a horse&#39;s barrel, but since all changes had stopped, now it just made him unable to walk properly, thus needing something to lean on. <br />
<br />
Ben leaned on his desk as support, and then sat on his chair. He couldn&#39;t bend his knees properly anymore, and that made it uncomfortable to sit on his chair. He really needed to find out what happened though, and he quickly got the answer. A text had appeared on the screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;The size of the transformation might be too big for the program&#39;s processors. Advancing might cause serious damage to user or program, would you like to continue? Yes/No&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben didn&#39;t want to risk it, so he clicked &quot;No&quot;.<br />
<br />
The screen now said something else: &quot;Altering settings, recovering&quot;.<br />
<br />
The program whirred again, and the feeling of being transformed started again. Ben saw the his front legs disappear back into his belly again. Once they did, he noticed that his stomach, previously stretched in an unhealthy way, had returned to normal proportions again. The bones in his belly also started shifting, meaning that his torso would now probably just be normal again.<br />
<br />
Ben tried standing up, but when he did so he almost lost his balance again. Looking at his down his leggings, he saw that he still had hooves. He tried bending his legs again, but only his hooves were reacting to it. Ben looked at the screen, it now said something else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adding realism, changing user body structure.&quot;<br />
<br />
What would that mean?<br />
<br />
Ben winced in discomfort. The bones in his legs started shifting again, causing the pain he felt, just like before. Now the stiffness in the spots his knees used to be, had disappeared. Testing his legs, he felt he could bend them again. Thank goodness. They were turning human again. His hooves would probably turn back into feet soon.<br />
<br />
Looking behind him, he saw the complete opposite of what he expected to see. He thought that his somewhat-a-tail was retracting back into his body again. What he saw however, was how his back was sprouting more and more horse hairs, lengthening in such away, that they formed a tail! Ben gasped. After a while, his brain was reacting to movements of some kind of organ he&#39;d never felt before. He pulled his tail, and simultaneously, he felt pain receptors assaulting his brain, causing him to yelp loudly.<br />
<br />
Just for sure, he undid himself from his leggings again, and what he saw blew his mind. His legs were a mix between a horse and a human. He had hooves, a tail, fur, but also knees, and a butt that made him able to sit right up, instead of lean forward.<br />
<br />
Ben finally made himself dare to stand up, and was amazed by how normal it felt. Everything underneath his belly button had changed, but the bone structure stayed the same. Well, it had turned back to how it was supposed to be. Thanks to this, he was able to stand upright, but when looking down, he did see he had grown drastically. He was almost 7 feet now, thanks to the legs. It was so strange! He took a look at the Chronivac, the feeling had faded again, and the program answered his question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Process finished. Transformation complete.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben started walking, but once again lost his balance, making him fall on the floor, harder than usual. Thanks legs. He crawled onto his bed, and looked at his legs from that angle. His whole underside had obtained equine traits, everything! He stared at his junk, barely being held together by the shorts, which he still had on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything...&quot;</p>
