<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;May I recommend a donkey, or perhaps a helpless rabbit?&quot; I shouted down at Morgana. &quot;Or perhaps a turtle without its shell!&quot;<br />
<br />
The witch had started towards the door, but at my yelling, she turned back, one eyebrow raised. &quot;Really?&quot; She seemed intrigued, fascinated by my comments and their tone alike. &quot;I&#39;ve had men and women in that cage who begged for mercy, or tried to change my mind - but never one that offered suggestions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sliding back down against the wall of the cage, I shrugged, one hand brushing some dark brown hair from my face. It was true, I&#39;d have never said such things before my father or his knights - but they weren&#39;t here right now. If I couldn&#39;t say such things before an evil witch, then who could I say them in front of.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ve met many princes and knights,&quot; I responded to her, my icy blue eyes glancing to the door before I returned to staring into her red-colored irises. &quot;There wasn&#39;t a single one out of the lot whose head wasn&#39;t securely shoved into their own ass.&quot; In just nineteen years alive, I&#39;d met no shortage of supposedly noble men who saw me as nothing more than an object, an accessory to place on their mantle and boost their already over-inflated egos. If one of them was cursed to become some awful beast, or truly a mere object, then I would hardly be the first to shed a tear.<br />
<br />
My honesty, it seemed, had drawn a great deal of interest from the spellcaster below. With a snap of her fingers, my cage lowered to the ground, allowing her to speak more closely with me. &quot;Not a believer in the nobility of God&#39;s chosen men?&quot; She asked playfully, already knowing the answer even before I rolled my eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;If they&#39;ve been chosen by God for greatness, I shudder to think what awful beasts have been chosen by the Devil.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucifer&#39;s Champions may not be awful as you think, my dear.&quot; She took a moment to rub her chin, before another snap of her fingers and the cage&#39;s door opened wide. She stepped in, smiling down at me as I waited to see what it was exactly that she wanted. &quot;Tell me, Sara - you&#39;ve surely heard tails of Morgana. What did they tell you about me?&quot;<br />
<br />
I shrugged, recounting what little I recalled from the stories passed around my father&#39;s court. &quot;They said you were a she-devil, among many other unflattering terms. That you were born pure evil, and sought only to corrupt the kingdom at every turn.&quot; <br />
<br />
She laughed quietly. &quot;And did they tell me that I was once a member of your family&#39;s court?&quot; <br />
<br />
Before, I had at best been half-listening - but her question brought my full attention. My head lifted, focus now solely on the red-haired witch before me. &quot;No... no, that was never mentioned.&quot; I sat up a bit straighter. &quot;You were... a noblewoman, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the most prominent in the land,&quot; she affirmed. I parsed out her tone carefully; in my few years I had become adept at detecting deception in the voices of lying diplomats and nobles, but in her voice, I found no hints of such things. &quot;Your great-great-grandmother, Queen Hannah, valued my counsel on magical matters. Without me, the Sorcerous rebels of Stoneheight, in the north, would never have been vanquished - your father wouldn&#39;t even have a kingdom to rule today.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stood up, mouth slightly ajar in disbelief. &quot;Queen Hannah?&quot; I had heard of her name, once or twice, but she was hardly ever mentioned compared to her husband. &quot;I.. I was told she had been infirm, and that King Samson had been responsible for that victory.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a spark of anger in Morgana&#39;s voice, though it was hardly directed at me. &quot;Of course you were. Hannah&#39;s son couldn&#39;t bear the thought of letting the achievements of women stand.&quot; She sighed quietly. &quot;That wretched man took pains to scrub the truth from history. Every woman who&#39;d advised his mother was... disposed of, save myself... and only because of the pact I accepted.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bargain she spoke of - I knew it well. &quot;Then you truly did make a deal with the devil? Power and immortality, in exchange for your soul?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My soul? Is that what they say about me?&quot; She threw her head back for a hearty laugh. &quot;My sweet child - Lucifer had no need for souls.&quot; She was smirking now. &quot;His price was simple: I was to remain free, never shackled to the rule of another. I have spent my many years since then doing as he demanded - in this lair, no man rules over me, or imposes his will upon me. My destiny, it is mine to make...&quot;<br />
<br />
She trailed off for a moment, before grinning at me. &quot;I suspect, my dear, that you are in no rush to return to your home?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, she had that correct, certainly. &quot;I.. can&#39;t say that I am, no.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then perhaps... we can help each other.&quot; I raised my own eyebrow now, curious, as she produced a small wooden object from her robes - a wand, I guessed immediately. &quot;I can see it in your eyes - you are a woman with little interest in being some toy or plaything, to be ordered by egotistical men. We are the same, in that way... and as it happens, I have long desired an... apprentice.&quot;<br />
<br />
The knight at the door was slamming against it, trying to batter his way in, but I couldn&#39;t draw my attention away from the offer being presented to me. &quot;Take this wand,&quot; she stated, holding out the thin rod for me to take, &quot;And use it to make our guest into whatever you think most fitting. From there... I can show you wonders beyond anything you&#39;ve imagined, and freedom greater than any man in this kindgom could ever afford you.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a twinkle in my eye as I took the wand into my shaky hands. I could feel the hum of magic within it - raw power, not like my father wielded, but real, primal energy, able to reshape the world. Every thing I&#39;d ever heard about Morgana made her out to be pure evil... but it felt as if, in her, I&#39;d found the first kindred soul I&#39;d ever known. And all the power and liberty she enjoyed, it could be mine, if only I rid the world of one pesky, arrogant noble...</p>
