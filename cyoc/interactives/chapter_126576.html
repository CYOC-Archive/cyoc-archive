<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff slowly gets up as his orgasm fades. Unsteady, but standing, Jeff picks up the Chronivac device and makes his way quietly back to his room while naked, and closes the door. Jeff slowly made his way back to his desk and sat down, plugging the device back into his computer. The app popped up, and Jeff took his time reading through all of the menus, and clicking through any help or examples he could find, which were very basic and simple. Jeff found that there was a password option on the device, which he set. He didn&#39;t need his sister or anyone else getting their hands on this.<br />
<br />
There was a panel in the app that showed Jeff&#39;s body in a before and current form, along with a list of changes. Jeff opened up a new change window, which opened up with his current form. Clicking on his body brought up menus and some boxes that he could type text into. Jeff enjoyed his first anal experience, but it was very messy. His cock still wreaked of shit. With a few clicks, Jeff&#39;s genitals changed on the screen to a hairless vagina with a penis clitoris, that would be an inch long but could expand, and was prehensile, so it could grow in length and girth quickly and only when he wanted. There was a setting for awareness, so Jeff set that only he would be aware of changes to his form. Jeff also enabled the device&#39;s full functionality with his passcode, and a need to put in the passcode to confirm any operation before it was applied in reality. Jeff saved his new form to the device,<br />
<br />
Jeff stood up, unplugged the device, and pressed the button to confirm the changes, followed by his pass code. The change was fast, and then it was over. Jeff did not notice that he had a box of tampons next to his computer, nor the other changes in his room, as he cracked open the door, and went back to the bathroom to clean up from his earlier orgasm. Jeff&#39;s sister walked by and said that supper would be late since mom was not home yet. Jeff grabbed his cloths after a quick shower and returned to his room, aware that his sister saw him naked without any reaction. Jeff was still naked in his room when his sister stopped at his door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom&#39;s still at work, do you want to play a game with me?&quot; she asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff covers up and turns to answer his sister when she giggles. Jeff looks at her and asks, &quot;What&#39;s funny?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s sister, snickers for a few moments, and says, &quot;You silly. You are acting funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smiles, &quot;I have to finish my homework, then I can come play on the xbox with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sister&#39;s face lit up with happiness, &quot;Good, I&#39;ll go practice while you do boring stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff closed the door to his room, and noticed the poster of a muscular man only wearing soccer socks and shoes sporting a fully erect cock, tight scrotum, no body hair, and DD cup breasts<br />
<br />
Jeff went over to his computer and plugged in the chronivac, he had read more about this reality augmentation setting. Jeff read all he could find. Still in a daze from what he had read, Jeff moved from the desk chair back to his bed, and tried to relax on the smooth, satin finish sheets he just noticed were so smooth. Jeff thought to himself, &quot;Preview Mode...how did I miss that?&quot; Jeff&#39;s thoughts turned from beating himself up for not knowing to staring at the poster on his door. It didn&#39;t take long for Jeff to feels his cock slide into his slick vagina. Jeff exploded in orgasm when he gave his still manly nipples a firm massage between his thumbs and forefingers. Jeff hungered for more, and did not stop until his 5th orgasm, when he drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
Jeff woke up with is mom slapping the bottom of his feet. &quot;Did you finish your homework first, before you played?,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Jeff, still waking up, weakly answered, &quot;No. Not yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s mom gave a disapproving grumble. &quot;Finish your homework now. I will put you on the pill again if you cannot control your urges. Bring your homework to the kitchen when your done. I&#39;ll take your favorite poster next time you don&#39;t have your homework done. That&#39;s one thing I ask of you Jeff. You are not an adult yet, not until you act line one. Don&#39;t close your door until you go to bed.&quot; Jeff&#39;s mom turned and left.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat up in bed, his cock was back to it&#39;s one inch clit size, but a heavy trail of dried semen trailed from his vagina.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s sister came into his room, &quot;Ha ha, you didn&#39;t do your boring stuff,&quot; then left.<br />
<br />
Jeff stumbled back to the bathroom, and took a brief hot shower. Then returned to his room with a towel around his waist. Jeff did not know what homework he had, and his backpack was the same. Digging though, he found a math worksheet, and no other assignments. Jeff finished the worksheet and then slid on a pair of compression shorts before going to the kitchen. Jeff found his mom in the kitchen, his sister and father at the table eating.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s Mom demanded, &quot;Let me see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff handed over the worksheet to his mom. She examined it thoroughly, and handed it back. &quot;Homework first, always. Do you hear me?,&quot; she commanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; answered Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eat. Let&#39;s pretend to be a happy family for a few minutes,&quot; demanded Jeff&#39;s mom.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s sister, mother, and father did most of the talking at the table. Jeff&#39;s sister was excused first, and she left for the TV in the living room. Jeff&#39;s mom looked at Jeff&#39;s dad, then Jeff&#39;s dad said, &quot;Son, you and me are cleanup.&quot; Jeff&#39;s mom nodded, and excused herself from the table.. She didn&#39;t go far, as she sat down at a small office desk in a corner of the living room and began to work.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad stood up and started carrying dishes to the kitchen sink. Jeff stood up and assisted. Jeff&#39;s dad was different. He was still tall, thick beard, and heavy set like Jeff remembered, but his father was now wearing black tights and low cut boots that contrasted with a button up shirt and a neck tie. Jeff and his dad cleaned the table and washed the dishes by hand, even though the dishwasher sat empty by the sink. Neither said a word until they were finished.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad said, &quot;A word please?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, and followed his father who went into Jeff&#39;s room and closed the door after Jeff entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff,&quot; began Jeff&#39;s dad, &quot;you know how your mom feels about your education. I was on the pill myself when I was your age. You made a deal with us, that you would get your homework and studies done first. You can screw your brains out afterwards, but not before. We keep having this talk every few weeks. Your mom has the pills from our talk last time. If your not having enough orgasms, talk to me. You have to deal with your cravings properly. If you are having problems, let&#39;s talk about it.&quot; Jeff&#39;s dad paused.<br />
<br />
Jeff was in a state of shock at the topic of discussion, &quot;I...uh...I fall asleep after just a couple.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad laughed and patted his son on the shoulder, &quot;Did you use your vibrator?&quot; Jeff&#39;s dad sighed, after the brief pause. Jeff&#39;s dad got up, and walked over to Jeff&#39;s dresser, and opened the top drawer, pulling out a harness and a vibrator. &quot;Your mom and I got you this, and you used to use it all the time. Is it too small?,&quot; Jeff&#39;s dad asked.<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded, not knowing if it was. Jeff&#39;s dad left the room, and returned a few moments later with another harness and vibrator. This brand new vibrator was bigger and the harness held two vibrators. Jeff took the harness and vibrator from his dad, and examined it.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad smiled, &quot;Bigger and longer, and you can add more silicone to adjust it, and it has an anal option. You can use your smaller vibrator for that. I don&#39;t want to put you on the pill son, but you cannot let your life be controlled by hormones. And this way you don&#39;t have to worry about falling asleep. See how that works for you tonight. It&#39;s getting late, so why don&#39;t you go to bed and try sleeping in your new harness. I still use mine from time to time. You and I require a lot for our bodies to be satisfied, we are high maintenance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff asked his father as he stood up to leave, &quot;You knew?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad nodded, &quot;I suspected. Just put a towel under you. You inherited my ability for a wet pussy. It makes it easier to slide you kids out.&quot; Jeff&#39;s dad patted his lower abdomen, the belly of a fat man, &quot;You two kids are the best thing your mom gave me.&quot; Jeff&#39;s dad left, closing the bedroom door behind him.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood up and slid off his shorts, then pulled the harness on, sliding the vibrator into his most pussy. The vibrator was a plug in type, so no batteries to change. He put his towel from earlier on the bed, then laid down on it after plugging in the vibrator. Jeff lasted 5 orgasms before falling fast asleep. Jeff slept soundly, his body erupting in orgasm every 30 or so minutes during the night.</p>
