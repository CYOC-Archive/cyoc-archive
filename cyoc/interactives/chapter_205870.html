<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danny was putting away some things at his locker when he saw Gabe and Terry talking to Tristan. Quite the strange combination since he was pretty sure that Tristan never really talked to Gabe and Terry before. Tristan seemed quite uncomfortable and a little angry. Danny wanted to eavesdrop on their conversation, but before he could, the trio walked into the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Danny had a guess of what was happening, and the moaning noise he heard while he walked past the bathroom confirmed his suspicions. Well, it looks like he didn&#39;t need to keep a close eye on Gabe and Terry anymore. While they had at least two days left in their transformation, he doubted there would be any more significant changes that he would need to stalk them to see. All that was left was the last of their muscles to dwindle and their race to fully transition to Asian.<br />
<br />
Looking back, it was fun to observe them changing from jerk, white jocks to Asian twinks. Though now it was time for Danny to shift his focus to his other targets. Specifically Sam and Jackson.<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Danny entered the school weight room, wondering how many of the guys here would end up falling victim to Sasha&#39;s curse when he saw Jackson and had to use all of his willpower not to laugh after seeing Jackson.<br />
<br />
So the rumors were true; Jackson really did shave his head. Oh, man! Danny wished that he could sneak a picture so he could laugh at him later, but Jackson would definitely notice that. Danny wasn&#39;t quite sure how old his former friend was, but one thing was for sure, he was no longer a teenager. It was a wonder that no one was really weirded out about this, but thanks to his bigger size they were all probably afraid of him now.<br />
<br />
Well, everyone except Sam, who looked like a puppy dog trying to please his master. Danny had to admit, it was cute, but it was also curious that Sam&#39;s sexuality change seemed to have progressed faster than either Terry or Gabe&#39;s. Perhaps because Sam wasn&#39;t as muscular as the other two were, so was Sasha&#39;s curse affecting his sexuality more? <br />
<br />
Perhaps, but he had plenty of time to think about it later. Right now, Danny couldn&#39;t fall behind Jackson, so he took off his shirt and started working out while observing the pair. Two things he noticed, Jackson was streaching a lot more, and Sam was obviously thristy for Jackson. Heh, looks like his former friend needs to be more careful, probably not a good idea to pull something in his old age, hehe.<br />
<br />
After a slightly distracted work out, Danny followed the duo into the locker room, doing his best to stay hidden. That&#39;s when he heard Jackson say it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need a minute before you join me in the shower?&quot; Danny couldn&#39;t belive what he was hearing. Have Jackson&#39;s changes progressed that far, or was that just a feudalism slip? Either way, he wanted, no, needed to see what was going to happen next. Not realizing that he was begning to feel turned on by the situation.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
Meanwhile, on a certain college campus, Jin was heading to his next class, feeling more confident than ever before. As he was walking, he noticed the stares of both men and women around campus. Usually, none of them wouldn&#39;t pay him any mind as the nerdy Asian walked by, but now, all of them seemed to be interested in him, if not enamored. A smile and a wink were all he gave to his admirers. He would have flexed for them as his brother did, but Jin wasn&#39;t too confident flexing yet. He hadn&#39;t researched the correct form or practiced it like Danny had.<br />
<br />
Speaking of his brother, Jin had to admit he was wrong to judge his brother for working out and focusing on bodybuilding so much. He used to think that what Danny did was a waste of time. That he should have been focusing more on his studies and his future. Now, though, Jin finally understood why his brother trained so hard and kept track of what he ate and how long he exercised so meticulously. The feelings of overwhelming strength he felt and the boundless energy he had were intoxicating. Jin couldn&#39;t wait for his first workout with Danny to see just how far he could go with his new body. The attention he received from everyone was a nice perk, as well.<br />
<br />
Speaking of attention, it seems like Jin had attracted the attention of someone he knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;J-Jin? Is that you?&quot; Jin turned around to encounter one of his DnD friends, Art Morris. Art was a tall, thin, and somewhat scruffy young man staring at Jin with a shocked expression. After all, the last time Art had seen his friend, he was your stereotypical Asian nerd. Now Jin had gained at least 30lbs of muscle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, of course, it&#39;s me,&quot; Jin decided to flex one of his arms for Art. If only to see how his friend&#39;s eyes widened as his bicep rose and hardened. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m still me where it counts. Just buffer and a lot more confident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so...&quot; Clearly, Art was still a bit wary of this situation. Not that Jin could blame him. The changes started after Art got sick with food poisoning four days ago. So coming back to see his friend look like a different person must have been shocking, to say the least, &quot;But how did this happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Jin began. He wanted to say he had no clue, but now that he thought of it, Jin might have a hunch on who was responsible for the odd going on that had been happening. &quot;Tell you what. Tomorrow I&#39;m going to the gym to work out with my brother. Why don&#39;t you tag along? Maybe we could figure out what&#39;s going on there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Gym near your house, right? Sure... I guess I could use some exercise...&quot; Art was still wary, but at least he had agreed to Jin&#39;s invitation. After that, Jin talked a little while longer with his friend before heading to class. Jin smirked as he left. He couldn&#39;t wait until tomorrow to ask Danny if all of this was his doing and if he could secretly change Art, as well.</p>
