<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“YOU WILL NOT DISRESPECT ME!”<br />
<br />
Jackson and Watson cuddled among each other, terrified at the new strict asian father who is now using the newspaper (rolled up) to whack a fly. Hitting the household lamps and other trinkets and destroying and cracking them in the process like some stereotypical sitcom they watched on TV. <br />
<br />
The American Asians, being partly caucasian and asian like their former bandmate and bro, were the main influencers of the former Jerrold’s disobedience of his father’s conservative roots, the extreme gay pride which they relished and celebrated as well as their tastes in trashy music.<br />
<br />
Dressed in a similar fashion to one another as well as the former Jerrold, they had long hair which resembled a rockstar, tattoos and piercings decor on their semi Asian-Caucasian faces. Only difference was that Jackson was dyed purple while Watson was dyed green.<br />
<br />
Both were dressed in a MONSTER tank top with tattoos all around, with Jackson’s ones specifically centered around his back and Watson’s trailing down his right arm. RIPPED Jeans and gothic army boots donned below their rebellious nature with an additional-monster crasher belt to hold their uneven waists. <br />
<br />
Muddy blue and wide eyes with long goatees being tied around by a silver loop, traces of aftershave over their upper lips as their cracked noses spoke fights and dishonor. Their eyebrows thick, manly but highly unprofessional and anti-heritage<br />
like as though it did not come from an asian descent.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the piercings over on his ears until not a shred of skin can be seen over at the edges....and their faces! One at their upper lip, one at the nose and two piercing both brows. Mirroring one another perfectly aside their minor differences.<br />
<br />
Watson had a lean lanky body, somewhat muscular but not that much due to his time mostly being pre-occupied with intense jack-off and fuck off sessions with his bro and boyfriend Jackson, dirty hollering as they cat-called effeminate gays as they let loose their weed. He was much taller too, the tallest of the three MONSTERS at a 5ft 11.<br />
<br />
Jackson on the other hand had a pudgier body,  a nice 5ft 9 for an asian, not as short as the former Jerrold but not as much as his boyfriend or Alan, which was 5ft 10 before he got ZHENG-ed. His stomach could be seen rubbing out and pressing against his tank as his arms were thick, it could be noted that despite him being shorter-he was pretty much the top in their relationship.<br />
<br />
With the descriptions of them, it was without a doubt they were rockstar prodigies.<br />
<br />
Since the age of ten, they went and blew into stardom which consisted of trashy partying, tons of rock music blasted every midnight and overall causing chaos. The two of them hung out with one another being suited to each other-before the sexy Jerrold Long debuted.<br />
<br />
Of course, they indulged in their sexuality- teaching Jerrold the ways to go despite Jerrold being much older, which is a complete contradictory to asian beliefs. Messing him up until he found his husband and then further messed the both of them up. <br />
<br />
Preferably, they wanted them to just remain as boyfriends but the old Alan had some decency in him. Nonetheless, they did not give up their intentions. They were already mid-way in the process of turning the former Zheng Ah Wen, Aka Alan Zheng, into a punk and hardcore liberal like them.<br />
<br />
Too bad they were dumb enough not to see the stereotypical scientists coming. Especially knowing these two were the culprits behind the first two, it will not be shocking for them for the serum to go rampage and MAKE THEM ASIAN AGAIN before the transformation is done.<br />
<br />
Maybe their liberal chill rocker DNA would be more suitable for pure bred caucasians unlike themselves, as the humidifier stole and stored the old rebellious DNA from Jerrold, it began puffing out the same essence out slowly, trailing around the room as it slowly made its way to the couple...or soon to be ex couple, ready to suck in all of their old DNA and selves for future stereotyping uses.<br />
<br />
“The only surprising thing is that...man...did not take out a pair of chopsticks and catch the fly with them. Eh? Eh?” Watson commented, nudging his boyfriend, still joking around at a time like this.<br />
<br />
“Watt this ain’t funny!” Jackson whispered, grabbing a hold of the taller duo. “I don’t want to turn conservative babe! I am an original!” <br />
<br />
Despite being top of the relationship, he can end up being a pussy sometimes, especially when his uniqueness is questioned. But even so, he knew how to rebel back against anyone over anything and everything.<br />
<br />
“But hey!...at least I’d probably still top ya!” Jackson smirked. “Even if I was no homo-”<br />
<br />
YOUNGER ONE IS SHORTER, OLDER ONE IS TALLER.<br />
<br />
“Shit...” <br />
<br />
The loudspeaker bellowed into their ears, a heavily strict asian voice echoing into their atmosphere as mist-reused from Gerald’s transformation and mixed with Mr Liong’s Chinese herbal cologne and DNA. <br />
<br />
No more disguises or slowness as the serum could no longer tolerate such con-foolery! Ass it begins setting in like a complete-<br />
<br />
SSSSH~<br />
<br />
MIST, as they could barely see the sofa they are currently sitting on together, much less the rest of the room which consisted of their rockstar items and basically every memory they had with one another, and the Ex-Zhengs when they were a couple before they turned ultra straight conservatives who probably do not even know one another anymore.<br />
<br />
A huge TV screen turned on in front of them as gigantic spirals appeared right in front of their eyes. It was the only light amidst the mist, as their eyes locked on the spirals-and their thoughts and concerns for one another faded away.<br />
<br />
Instantly, the two of them let go of each other’s hands as drool formed over their mouths. Inhaling in the mist, bodies began morphing as the screen shifted to-</p>
