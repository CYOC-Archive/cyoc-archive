<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sunday, five minutes to 6 am. It was the perfect opportunity. I’ve been quietly observing the whole neighbourhood for weeks. Old man Mr. Morrison wouldn’t take Peppy, his chihuahua, for a walk until 6:32. Mrs. Sanders wouldn’t obsessively check the contents of her mailbox until 6:45, and then once again at 6:51. There wouldn’t be any passing cars until the rusty green truck that passed at 7:08 at the earliest. I had more than half an hour of solitude to spare.<br />
<br />
But then, why was I shaking? There were only three windows that provided a clear view of my front porch. All their shutters were down. My front door was slightly ajar, I gazed through the slight gap and I couldn’t see any life outside. Even the early morning birds seemed absent.<br />
<br />
This is what I really wanted, right? I’ve been planning this for months, but my cowardly nature had always been an impediment. I initially planned to do this in the middle of the night, but the movements of the drunk teenagers that passed in front of my house were difficult to predict. They always wandered without a clear route or timetable. It took me lots of sleepless nights to realize that they never appeared during or after sunrise.<br />
<br />
My whole body was shaking like jello. My skin was drenched in sweat. My heavy breathing caused me to expand and tighten rhythmically.<br />
<br />
And I wasn’t wearing a single stitch of clothing.<br />
<br />
You idiot, if you don’t do this right now you know what’ll happen! Another seven days waiting. Seven days wondering. Seven days fantasizing about how’d it felt like. Just to once again run away like a pussy next Sunday. It just won’t stop until you finally do it!<br />
<br />
I shook my head. I glanced at the clock hanging on the wall of the hall. It was 5:59. Every single time I doubted myself I was losing precious time.<br />
<br />
You can do it, Joe. You’ll do it at 6:00. Yes, when the shorter hand reaches 6 you’ll go through that door. You’ll give ten calm and confident steps forward without looking back. You’ll enjoy the morning sun caressing your naked flesh. You’ll have half an hour all to yourself. Nobody will see you.<br />
<br />
I had so many conflicting feelings. The only reason I had courage to walk out the front door like this was that I was certain nobody would see me. Yet at the same the only reason I liked this idea was that there was always an inherent risk in it.<br />
<br />
Yes, the risk of being seen. Those eyes looking at me in shock and disbelief. Looking at my indecent self like I’m God’s most embarrassing failure...<br />
<br />
I was rock hard.<br />
<br />
Yes, this was exactly what I wanted.<br />
<br />
The longer hand reached 12. I had no idea if it was all the blood flowing into my shaft but I had only one thing in mind: expose myself into the world.<br />
<br />
I didn’t give ten calm and confident steps... I ran towards the outside world like a one-man stampede!<br />
<br />
...And then I froze mid-step.<br />
<br />
The morning breeze caressed my bare skin. I was bathing in sunlight. I was... outside. And... and... Oh shit, I’m fucking outside!<br />
<br />
No, calm down! This is what you wanted, remember? Take a deep breath and enjoy the moment!<br />
<br />
But my body didn’t react to my thoughts. I was frozen mid-step like a freaking statue. Except that statues didn’t wiggle and shiver like my bare self. The entire scene was like a moving photo. I could see the green grass of my garden waving and dancing at me. The leaves of the trees throwing themselves into the ground like joyful children. It was a beautiful morning. And right in my porch was me, bare, completely pink, with a pale expression, frozen mid-step, shivering, sweating, barely breathing, exposed, naked.<br />
<br />
Why had I done this again? I felt like I was shrinking away into nothingness. But then I remembered about the camera.<br />
<br />
Making sure that nobody passed around while I was exposing myself wasn’t the only thing I had done in anticipation of this moment. I had placed a camera in my front porch to record my whole exposure. The lens was pointing at me, with the road and the garden in the background, and it was currently recording.<br />
<br />
I had no intention of ever making the footage public, but I did want to have something to remember this moment and of course jack off to it afterwards.<br />
<br />
I could see my head reflected on the huge professional lens. That reflection is what anybody would see if they saw me at my current state. Seeing that reflection helped me calm down and made me remember the reason I wanted to do this.<br />
<br />
And that reason was, of course, that I looked utterly pathetic.<br />
<br />
After all the shivering and panicking, my penis was floppy and wrinkled. I was uncut, and above-average length, but I’m a grower so when I’m soft I look like an unremarkable squishy sausage. My balls were quite big, and they were covered in messy black hairs that I never had bothered to trim. I shaked my ballsack a little in front of the lens to make clear that my testicles were full and ready for discharge when needed.<br />
<br />
I was quickly becoming hard. My shaft was half way standing to attention, my whole meat growing fatter and larger. My foreskin retracted a little and, for the first time ever, the sunlight had the pleasure of touching my mushroom tip.<br />
<br />
I was drooling precum already. Never before having been in direct contact to the sun my meaty manhood felt violated. It wasn’t too dissimilar to losing my virginity. I felt liberated. I opened my pee hole wide as if daring the sun to penetrate me further. The sun was glad to comply.<br />
<br />
My erection was so monumental at that moment that it was difficult to walk. Still, I gave unsteady steps further into the outside world, fully aware that with every single step I was further away from the safety of my home.<br />
<br />
I felt the urge to scream. To yell at the world that I was there. Completely exposed and vulnerable at the world’s many dangers. Not like I wasn’t too busy jerking my foreskin up and down though.<br />
<br />
Yes... It was fucking awesome. I had always been so afraid of showing myself off. But now there I was, outside, daring the whole world to make me its bitch.<br />
<br />
I wondered if any grown-up man would have ever felt this vulnerable. I was sure I was the only one. And that was because making sure that nobody wandered through the streets and setting up a camera weren’t the only things I had done in anticipation of this moment. I had invested all of my life savings in purchasing a certain machine in the black market. It had initially been engineered as a torture device for a dictatorial small country. It could reduce anybody into just one of their body parts yet at the same time retain all of their five senses. Prisoners could be tortured with their retained sense of pain, their inability to speak ensured no annoying cries and screams for the torturers to endure and their reduced size meant that they could be stored in small containers between torture sessions. Most criminals, fearing this grim fate, would rather spill the beans and confess their crimes than spend ten minutes as a compacted piece of flesh.  Most of these devices had since been banned and destroyed, but luckily I had certain connections in the dark web that made me know one of these machines was been auctioned to the highest bidder.<br />
<br />
But I didn’t feel resentful towards the machine’s dark history. After all I was going to use it for my own pleasure, not as a weapon. I wanted to become one of my own body parts myself.<br />
<br />
I wonder what the original engineers of the machine would think if they knew I had used their contraption to become my own penis.<br />
<br />
There I was, or should I rather say, my genitalia was there, standing on the front lawn. A disembodied set of dick and balls, the most sensitive and vulnerable parts of my body, completely exposed for everyone to see, prod and squeeze with absolutely no way for me to object to their tortures.<br />
<br />
And I was enjoying every second of it.<br />
I swayed my phallus back and forth, teasingly, at no one in particular. I fantasized about what would happen if someone were to find me there and then. What would their first reaction be when coming across a very realistic dildo that seemed to have a life of its own?<br />
<br />
Would they laugh?<br />
<br />
Would they be disgusted?<br />
<br />
Would they dare to pick me up and touch me all over?<br />
<br />
Whatever it was it definitely wouldn’t be: “Oh, that’s Joe Walker’s penis going outside for a breather. Its standing inside its rightful property so we totally should not trespass and leave Joe’s genitals be.”<br />
<br />
That was such an absurd possibility that I wanted to chuckle, but the most I could do was slightly open my peehole a bit as if I were a fish trying to talk underwater. That reminded me that I wasn’t just as vulnerable as a juicy piece of meat laying on the ground: I was also as silent as one.<br />
<br />
I had no way to talk. I could walk using my testicles as makeshift feet and my urethral mouth had become a multiple purpose tool from which I could see, hear, and smell... But my body wasn’t capable of producing barely any sound.<br />
<br />
This only managed to fuel my fantasies. I imagined that somebody picked me up, believing me to be some sort of obscene sex toy.<br />
<br />
“Mmm...So thick and hard... You’d be a nice fit for my tight asshole...” They’d say.<br />
<br />
I’d try to protest. “I’m not a vulgar sextoy, I’m a man! ...Oh! Your grip around my shaft is too much...!” But all my protests would go unheard. They’d carry me around like a freaking object they owned and when they got home that’s when the real fun started.<br />
<br />
Yes, Joe. They’d use you as a cock. Because that’s what you are. A mighty rock-hard cock. Nothing else. You’re literally a big smelly dick that uses its very own precious babymakers as feet. Why should they treat your balls any better than you do? They’d use you, your face buried up their stinking asshole until your pathetic balls get dry and then they’d throw your flaccid and useless body into the trash compactor.<br />
<br />
Damn! I was so fucking hard! I could only look towards the skies, towards the flying birds that could only look with disdain at the detached piece of human genitalia laying on the ground trying to masturbate itself.<br />
<br />
I slid my foreskin up and down my hard shaft, I could feel it coming closer but not quite. I let myself plop into the ground and grinded my phallic torso in the dirt. To the dirt I must have looked like just any other ordinary pink earthworm but my intention wasn’t eating the earth, but rather spill my seed all over it for my own pleasure.<br />
<br />
Yes! Keep inching, you insignificant worm! Let the friction violate all your senses!<br />
<br />
What would have previously been my hips were thrusting against the ground with great force. Of course, it was just my featureless phallic body, but old habits die hard. It felt like the most pleasurable sex I had in my whole life... and my lover was just a bunch of dirt. But when you’re a cock, any kind of contact feels extremely intimate.<br />
<br />
Ahhhh, I was about to... About to... ARRRGHHH! I could feel my balls contracting sightly, a surge of pleasure overcoming my whole body and a very salty flavour in my mouth.<br />
<br />
I spewed out the biggest load I ever had in my life. My whole face was sticky and my vision turned blurry and filled with white.<br />
<br />
I lay there, exhausted, in a puddle of my own cum. Damn, that sure was... worth it... I hope the camera had caught that hell of an orgasm...!<br />
<br />
Yeah, you did well Joe... You have lots of time to spare, so let’s just enjoy this moment...<br />
<br />
And I wanted to, but there was an annoying loud noise coming my way. I could even feel how the ground vibrated with increasing intensity.<br />
<br />
FIIIIIUUUUUUUM!<br />
<br />
...Wait, that wasn’t possible. I still had about twenty minutes of solitude all for myself!<br />
<br />
I shook my wet dickhead dry not unlike a dog would, clearing my sight. I saw the backside of a rusty green truck getting farther away. That truck... It wasn’t supposed to pass until 7:08 at the earliest! What the hell was it doing passing through here an entire hour early?! Shit! Shit! Shit! Hopefully the driver didn’t see me! Damn, that was fucking close! And I while I jacked off I had inched so close towards the road as well! The truck’s heavy wheels could’ve ran over my delicate and small body if the driver wanted to! Fuck, fuck, FUCK!<br />
<br />
Fucking truck driver! How could they dare not to follow their usual schedule...?! As I, the angry cock and balls, cursed the driver, a strange sense of dread began to fill inside me. It had to be 6:08. The truck usually came at 7:08. It was weird that the truck wouldn’t follow its particular schedule, but the fact that it had passed exactly sixty minutes early was even more strange...<br />
<br />
Suddenly, all the air surrounding me began to feel different. The birds perched on the trees seemed more hostile somehow. I could feel a dreadful feeling of insecurity building deep inside my balls. My pubic hair was getting all straightened up. My hard on was subsiding. Wrinkles appeared all over my skin. I wasn’t just getting flaccid, I was becoming horribly scared and I had no idea why.<br />
<br />
But deep down you do, Joe.<br />
<br />
...Yes, I knew. It wasn’t six in the morning. It was seven.<br />
<br />
I had forgotten to adjust the clocks for daylight savings last night.<br />
<br />
FUCK! How could I have been so freaking careless?! I entered a state of immense panic. I was no longer in control. I no longer felt safe. From this minute onwards, the events of the day would be completely beyond my control. I was naked, vulnerable and unable to cry for help. I was a lone penis and I was in the most dangerous place imaginable: outside.<br />
<br />
The cum puddle I was standing on was drying up. It felt cold and lifeless. If the rapidly dying sperm could talk they would’ve told me to run and save myself while I still could.<br />
<br />
I turned my dickhead backwards. There it was, the front door to the security of my own home. It was slightly ajar and I could hear the wind quietly whispering to me that I should hurry up inside before disaster came my way. I just had to go through it, activate the machine and recover my old body.<br />
<br />
I took off running, my balls stepping on the cold grass with each step. Fuck! What if someone’s staring out from their window? What if anybody had seen me? What if they confused me with something other than a bona-fide human being? I looked like a fucking cock and balls, for fuck’s sake!<br />
<br />
My cursed and cursed with each step I gave. It wasn’t a long distance to cover, but it appeared eternal to little prick me. I was almost there.... I just had to... climb the steps... and that was it...! Phew!<br />
<br />
However, the steps looked gigantic now. Every single one of them looked like a nice climb. Why did they look bigger now?... Oh, that’s right. I was flaccid now. Fuck! If I’d only realized this before cumming...!<br />
<br />
C’mon, the first step. I put my left testicle on top of it and then used all my strength to lift the rest of my body up. Shit, it would’ve been much easier if could’ve just used my long shaft to climb!<br />
<br />
The second step... Ok, now the third... Just one more and I’ll be on the front porch...! Woah!<br />
<br />
I had fell backwards, and regrettably I fell balls-first. I would’ve groaned in pain if I had been able to.<br />
<br />
After reincorporating myself, I climbed the rest of the steps and finally got in the front porch.<br />
<br />
Finally! Thank goodness. I had left the machine in the living room, I just had to walk through the hallway and this nightmare will finally be over...!<br />
<br />
I was so relieved thinking about getting my old body back that I didn’t mind my step and I didn’t notice that a corner of the welcome mat of my house was slightly bent upwards. The moment my right testicle stept on it I slipped and my body got launched mid-air.<br />
<br />
Usually throwing a disembodied cock and balls against an open door wasn’t enough to close it. But my door wasn’t even half open. When leaving to do my little exhibitionist dare, I had just slightly opened it ajar. Even a slight breeze would have been able to force it shut if the wind so desired to seal the fate of a tiny penis. So of course the impact of my babymakers against it made it slowly close a tiny bit until I heard the most terrifying sound I had ever heard in my entire life.<br />
<br />
*Click*<br />
<br />
The front door had been locked. And I was outside.<br />
<br />
Outside.<br />
<br />
As a mute, vulnerable, fragile, sentient and extremely sensitive set of cock and balls. Outside.<br />
<br />
...I was fucked.</p>
