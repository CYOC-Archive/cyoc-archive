<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author&#39;s Note: Michael&#39;s POV<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
You stood there to the immediate right of your pregnant wife, slightly behind Elizabeth, and to the left of your siren counterpart, Michelle. Both you and Michelle were actually supporting Elizabeth, who seemed to still be a bit off balance by the revelation, to her, that there were men who were sexually interested in other men. For the moment, though, your attention was what Sally had reported.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;ve secured an &quot;abandoned&quot; army bunker with access to the sea for a site for Selene to run her sisterhood?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We figured it would be a safe site for you and Selene to go to once she revealed that she was a siren to you,&quot; Sally answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... if it weren&#39;t for my idiotic wandering, Selene&#39;s sisterhood would only be her and our daughter,&quot; you told her, &quot;I&#39;d count as a trusted brother... but the three of us wouldn&#39;t need a mansion...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... the council figured that your sisterhood would grow in time... as you and Selene went on living and loving together,&quot; Sally explained, &quot;Either Selene having children or your children then having children. It&#39;s commonly how many sisterhoods grow... though not always.&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrugged at the answer. You supposed it&#39;d make sense. Selene, Michelle, Elizabeth, and Emily would go on living for quite a while, if not forever provided they didn&#39;t sustain mortal injury, because they were sirens. Selene had said that her own magic, through the loving relationship you had with Selene, you would go on living with her. An image flashed through your mind of you and Selene sitting on the balcony of a relatively nice looking but small mansion with thirty sirens that looked like a combination of you and Selene seated on the floor as watched futuristic flying cars fly past. You put that out of your mind for a moment, as that was not important at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s probably a good thing you had the idea though,&quot; Michelle spoke up, &quot;Now that the sisterhood also includes me, Elizabeth, Emily, and Jacob... Jake... in addition to Michael, Selene, and their baby...&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched as Michelle&#39;s eyes seemed to focus on Selene&#39;s womb. You wondered if she was now honestly wanting to be pregnant or was thinking over the possibility that she might be pregnant. You knew you would probably have the same thoughts if you were in Michelle&#39;s position. The two of you were, the same person mentally speaking, after all. You figured you&#39;d have to wait a few days before you and Michelle knew if the two of you were now DNA wise two separate individuals  or the same individual, simply with different genders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that is good,&quot; Julie agreed, &quot;It&#39;d settle your long term housing arrangements, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d still need to stay with my parents until I graduate college,&quot; Emily spoke, &quot;I may be a siren now... but that doesn&#39;t mean I want to abandon what I wanted to do before those thugs decided to beat and rape me... and then found that that when they did &quot;rape&quot; me that I would... I would.... eat them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We understand,&quot; Sally answered, &quot;and from what we&#39;ve been told, the manner being built over the land entrance to the bunker isn&#39;t finished yet, so you&#39;ll still have some short term inconveniences to deal with...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Selene nodded, &quot;It would... though I&#39;d like to wait until I&#39;ve given birth before I become a siren dating councilor... and the same would go for Michelle, Michael, or Emily... I would like some time before we&#39;re all driving up and down the coast to help sirens find true love.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched Michelle blink at this and got some sense that she was worried about something, but figured it was probably the requirement to help other sirens find a man that they could love and be loved in return. After all, you figured that Selene would be much like Julie, a very liberal Head Sister by siren standards it would be obvious that she&#39;d be picked to help sirens transition from eating human males to falling in love and marrying them. There was a thought that Elizabeth and Michelle might have to do the same, but for the moment, that thought wasn&#39;t too serious and you let it pass from your mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Sally acknowledged, &quot;and we&#39;ll try to do this by phone as much as possible with set times for you and your sisterhood to be available. When you&#39;ll have to travel, we&#39;ll do our best to give you plenty of warning...&quot;<br />
<br />
You all nodded. You were personally grateful for the council member&#39;s acceptance, though you actually gave a yawn before anyone could say anything more. The yawn caught some attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is starting to get a little late,&quot; Frank commented, as he came up beside his wife, &quot;I can put together a meal for all of you... you two, Sally... don&#39;t think your old man&#39;s forgotten...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, daddy,&quot; Sally answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then you can get ready for tomorrow,&quot; Frank then finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; you answered, &quot;Sounds good... but how will we be sleeping? Do you have guest rooms?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Frank and I only have one real guest room,&quot; Julie said with a sigh, &quot;Frank and I have our room and Sally has her room... we only have one other bedroom. Most of my sisters prefer to sleep in the underground cave that we sent a year carving out underneath the house...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have a couch?&quot; Jake asked, &quot;I could crash there...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose,&quot; Frank shrugged, &quot;It that&#39;s what you want, son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d stay out of the way,&quot; Jake answered, &quot;and that would let Head Sister Selene have a night with her husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched Michelle perk up at that then sink down when she remembered that she was a sister in Selene&#39;s sisterhood, not husband. It was one of those things that would be odd between you, Selene, and Michelle. Michelle remembered everything you did, and being a siren wouldn&#39;t remove the romantic love Michelle would probably always have for Selene, because YOU would never lose your romantic love for Selene. But as a fellow mermaid, Michelle would probably feel like something of a third wheel for awhile before the three of you got things practiced out.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be nice for the three of us,&quot; Selene commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Three?&quot; Michelle asked, looking up, and looking hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, three,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;You and Michael are one and the same. The only difference is that your a siren and created out of Head Sister Florencia&#39;s&quot; her tone was icy as she said Florencia&#39;s name &quot;nonsense. I can&#39;t blame you for becoming Michelle, Michelle. And you are still the same as Michael. So you are every bit my husband as Michael is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michelle smiled, walked forward and hugged Selene to her, heavily relieved and looking to make sure that she was still loved by Selene. You loved Michelle, too, and wanted to let her know that you wouldn&#39;t stop Michelle from loving Selene for much the same reason that Selene had put forth for including Michelle with you as her &quot;husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Elizabeth and I?&quot; Emily asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose we&#39;ll just go down and sleep in the cove,&quot; Elizabeth shrugged, &quot;you can talk to me about your family... I&#39;ll try to learn and be respectful about things... and be a good sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... okay,&quot; Emily shrugged, &quot;I suppose that&#39;d work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Frank smiled, &quot;now... I&#39;ll go get some Hamburger Helper cooked and we can have dinner.&quot;</p>
