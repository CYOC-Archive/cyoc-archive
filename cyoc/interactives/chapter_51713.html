<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While waiting for Penny to come out of her surgery, Kirk had made a phone call.. he <br />
hadn't expect the person he had been hoping to answer TO answer... but they did all the <br />
shame.<br />
<br />
And Kirk was more than shocked when his parents commented on how overjoyed they <br />
were that their -son- was restored to them. How they had visited him every week in the <br />
gallery not sure if he could hear them or not. And had never stopped praying for him to <br />
be cured even as their neighbors pretended they were crazy for thinking the statue was <br />
their child. <br />
<br />
Then his mother began recounting on a fishing trip were Kirk had fallen into the pound <br />
and how long it had taken to dry the cub's fur. Kirk remembered that, or at least, his <br />
father saying how feeling awkward teaching his daughter to fish. <br />
<br />
Finally Kirk got to Penny being seriously injured, and again his mother didn't think for a <br />
second that Penny being a lion or female as not right and instead spoke her deep <br />
sympathy for Kirk's plight and trying to cheer him up tried to recount Kirk and Penny's <br />
first date... Kirk stopped her in time.. that incident had been embarrassing enough for <br />
both. <br />
<br />
When the surgery light went off, Kirk had finally said, &quot;Love you too mom.&quot; And hung up.<br />
<br />
Across town, Gloria calmly hung up the phone. Humming to herself wiping a tear from <br />
her eye at finally having her baby back. All she wore except for her apron dissolved into <br />
nothing to reveal the fur now underneath, her pricey shoes gone or rather never bought. <br />
Her tail swished back and forth growing as she worked. The knife in her hands vanished <br />
having never been drawn as she began cutting up the fish with her own claws. Her ears <br />
moved to the top of her head and she heard her mate's sporting even on TV in the other <br />
room. Her face shifted to a muzzle as she sniffed the air, decided she needed to switch to <br />
another disinfectant. <br />
<br />
She took the tray to her husband even as the kitchen archway raised up for her. She <br />
placed he tray down in front of him careful to only obscure his view for a moment before <br />
coming behind the human and wrapped her arms around him and licked his face and he <br />
kissed her back. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guess what Jeff dear...&quot; Gloria whispered hotly. <br />
<br />
&quot;What honey?&quot; Jeff replied, the couch increasing inside after their kiss, his pose altering <br />
from sitting to cross eagle style. His clothes fell apart on him, his layers of flab MOSTLY <br />
vanishing while the fur appeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;I heard from a very special someone just now..&quot; She said playfully. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; Jeff asked wondering what his mate was at as his bald head became a full mane of <br />
hair around his head, teeth becoming canines and canines into fangs. <br />
<br />
Gloria reached down past his tail in his lap and touched his sheath, &quot;I just heard from <br />
Kirk... he's with us again dear, Penny found a way to free him, we have our son back... we <br />
finally... we FINALLY HAVE OUR CUB BACK!&quot;<br />
<br />
Showing concern no wild lion would ever show for a cub logically lost forever, Gloria's <br />
eyes mist up in joy. Jeff completely forgot about the sport on TV and leapt off the couch <br />
and hugged his mate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure? It was really him it was really-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I check dear, he wouldn't let me finnish talking about his first date, and he knew Penny, <br />
it was him, it was our son.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff eyes were misting up as well now as the apron claded lioness and naked lion man <br />
embraced. &quot;Where?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glendale memorial hospital, Penny she said was hurt saving her..&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff barely remember to turn off the late night sport before in the middle of the night the <br />
two lions made their way to the hospital for a long over due reunion. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
The curse of course had no intention of playing honorably or within the rules or now by <br />
anything that remotely resembles the laws of war, the time for games was over. The curse <br />
remained mindlessly docile within Glendale, still bound by the rules of Transform or Dare <br />
the witches had left upon it in revenge for the town of Glendale ignorantly refusing the <br />
witches' liberation from things like sanity and taboo.  But the massive awareness it had <br />
gained from the massive and short span use of turns and all together was gone, it simply <br />
was now, and would not survive long enough to gather to become self aware again.<br />
<br />
On Big Bad Island... all the rules had been thrown out the window, like a genie not bound <br />
by wishes... The echoing wills of Golgatha and Gomorrah twisted Big Bad Island and it's <br />
inhabitant into the 'paradise' Glendale would have become if the town's had simply <br />
accepted their message of pure absolute freedom devoid of all restrictions or <br />
consequences. If only they had not brought the coven to the attention of those five witch <br />
hunters (who were accused of witchcraft themselves when they tried to turn the tide of <br />
rampant paranoia that struck within a decade later). That was what paradise was <br />
supposed to be anyway right? So would the church turn on them for creating a paradise <br />
on Earth? Prudes. <br />
<br />
Glass emerged on the bridge of the luxury yacht behind the elderly captain hired to steer <br />
while the rich and spoiled entertained themselves. <br />
<br />
Before Glass would have had to be given a turn, to wait for it be passed on, but the chaos <br />
had broken free, and now, like all now completely engulfed in the chaos (rather ironic <br />
given their seemingly organized attitude), she now had an unlimited number of turns. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare.&quot;  She said behind the captain's back.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT? Who goes... huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Down here.&quot; She said simply with the calm of a glacier. <br />
<br />
The captain looked down, &quot;What.. are... what are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am liberated. I am free. I am without restrained or boundaries. Answer Dare or <br />
Transform or you shall get both.&quot;<br />
<br />
The captain wondered if he had wandered into a ship's graveyard and had angered the <br />
shade of someone lost at sea, it had happened to his grandfather. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of using the loophole, Glass said, &quot;Steer the ship and keep her on course to the <br />
following coordinates, you'll do your absolute hardest to make sure everyone on board <br />
ends up there... then you'll disembark with the rest.&quot; Glass then said what the <br />
coordinates were, she had no fear of loop hole or errors, not anymore, she served the <br />
curse.<br />
<br />
The captain gasped realized how out in the middle of nowhere that was... but his body <br />
obeyed without his consent, and he began to radically alter course... and the winds and <br />
tides seemed to twist and warp around the ship (it was actually warping around Glass and <br />
the chaos within her) and pushed the ship along toward Big Bad Island at incredibly fast <br />
speeds.<br />
<br />
Of course one man came up to complain when the sudden change of course and speed <br />
caused the ruination of his bingo game. <br />
<br />
He gasped when he saw Glass, who simply said, &quot;Transform or Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
A minute later the same man was assuring everyone that everything was perfectly fine and <br />
nothing was to be worried about, there was just some reports of pirates and bad weather <br />
and they had to change course to avoid them, but there was special resort that had just <br />
opened that would be perfect for a short stop he said. <br />
<br />
What people hadn't expected was for a storm cloud with purple lightning underneath was <br />
a relatively massive island. There wasn't any port any of the socialites could see, but the <br />
yacht sailed straight foreword, the force of nature seeming to push it even harder there as <br />
it moved foreword and just as one woman got the idea of running to the bridge to see if <br />
the old man had suffered a heart attack, the ship crashed right into the sandbar. This <br />
knocked a lot of 'tourists' out of the boat and onto the beach, hard. <br />
<br />
The looked up, and saw trees bent and twisted, growing through themselves in <br />
unpredictable and random patterns, they saw waiting deer that were much larger than <br />
they could have logically been, with solid gold eyes and antlers and hooves that could <br />
have been horns and claws almost. <br />
<br />
And further up... they saw the swirling purple storm... It quickly reached critical mass as <br />
other people wondered what the others were looking at, their eyes all turning gradient <br />
red.  Not ceasing to look up, they all walked over the side of the boat falling over the <br />
edge into the surf or the beach and simply got up and continued to walk looking <br />
upwards. <br />
<br />
Names ceased to exist, names were just labels, shackles, things to give other things <br />
limits, what place did they have in the coven's paradise? Clothes fell apart next, nobody <br />
cared or noticed. <br />
<br />
Some men and women grew hideously bloated, male and female element growing to the <br />
size of parody and beyond, layers of fat and muscle expanding outward, hands twisted <br />
into barely articulated hooves, faces became tusked snouts, hair falling out as twisted <br />
tails grew from their oversized butts. Their feet became hooves that fit the bare minimum <br />
for standing upright. Ears became flaps, and the humanoid swine squealed and chortled. <br />
<br />
Without hesitation, thought or reserve one man instantly began to hump his own mother. <br />
At the same time fruit as large the pigs themselves grew impossibly fast, looking like <br />
weathered red avocados and figs that soon fell under their own weight onto or in front of <br />
the new impossibly fat pig things. Some licks themselves and each other of the sweet <br />
juices, others buried themselves into the downing the delicious fruit barely even tasting <br />
it.  And as it went through their system, none thought of cleanness or privacy as they <br />
dumped onto the sand and on occasion fruit and each other which couldn't have been <br />
more ignored. <br />
<br />
Another small group gained razor sharp hooves and muscles rippled across their entire <br />
bodies, materials barely staying within the ream of applicable and well past the point of <br />
realistic. Women mooed as as mud brown fur covered their entire bodies and those of the <br />
men, horns as long as their shoulder sprouted from their skulls, their hands becoming <br />
hooves that had render flesh and just enough muscle and flexibility to gasp objects. <br />
Heads became those of cows, long tails came next. The women's breasts larger than the <br />
mens' heads sevearl times over growing four nipples on each breast. And they grew <br />
larger these monsters, the minotaurs soon humping each other with no regard to <br />
anything else around them (yet). the old ones out simply pleasing themselves spraying all <br />
around them. <br />
<br />
Fuzzy black fur came to the next ground, their bodies also exploding almost with muscle, <br />
their heads turning into something identical to that of a bear, the tiny round tail almost <br />
looking comical, almost. Their hands became useless for anything but ripping the flesh <br />
off of things. Husband and wife snarled and roars at each other and the sky, they turn <br />
into each other, healing as fast as they could harm each other, they would have killed one <br />
another in seconds otherwise. And their blood splattered everywhere, as the man who <br />
had come to complain to the captain dived into mindless fury on the middle class wife he <br />
had sworn to live till the end of his days and had married under the disapproval of his <br />
family. <br />
<br />
Others, the captain included, found themselves not not noticing, but not CARING about <br />
the others around them, or the dear for that matter, all that mattered was them, only <br />
them and could only matter was them. Their lower bodies expanded as dirty gold fur and <br />
hair covered their bodies, their bodies below the wast becoming that of a horse from the <br />
neck down. They crossed their arms which were reabsorbed into their torsos, their heads <br />
becoming those of mundane horses, their eyes closing forever and even the eyeballs <br />
inside ceasing to be, becoming just black spaces on their faces, their ears moving to the <br />
top of their heads, sound creating crystal clarity images for them in a 360 degree radius. <br />
Wings like those of a dragon burst out of the sides of their horses bodies, and their <br />
hooves were as sharp as spears as were the fangs in their muzzles. Their manes were as <br />
black as midnight. Arms that didn't resemble any limbs that a human being would have <br />
formed at their front hips, leaving their shoulders armless.  They were perfect. They knew <br />
it. It was the only truth. The only truth that mattered. And they could not see the world <br />
that would dare contradict this truth. <br />
<br />
A pregnant woman, her loyal husband now mindlessly mounting her sister, fell to her <br />
knees, her arms and legs vanishing as she fell over backwards. What happened next <br />
should never ever be described to any person. <br />
<br />
Children meanwhile laughed, giggled, sniggered, cackled, hissed, chattered, babbled, <br />
spoke gibberish as snakes as if they were tails grew from their rears, fur like coal and <br />
skin like red leather. Their feet became hands. As they climbed into the trees ignoring <br />
their parents without even a look back, the children altered by the curse embracing their <br />
impulses without a second thought committing any act that crossed their minds not <br />
bothered to think if it was good or bad, they felt the need to do it and that was all. <br />
<br />
Glass smiled, for it was good. <br />
<br />
And the curse fed, until it was gorged. Yes, this was the paradise the coven would have <br />
made Glendale into... <br />
<br />
And one command was ingrained into the brains of all that lived within the island <br />
influence, protect the curse and kill all who sought to end it who came here. <br />
<br />
Finally two women assumed the poses of the left and right muse from the statue 'the <br />
three graces' become statuesque humanoid solid marble wolves in the progress, a large <br />
base forming beneath them near the center of the island.. the center 'muse' missing. Or <br />
rather, had not arrived upon the island yet... Kaylee would experience the gift of external <br />
beauty first hand. <br />
<br />
In the curse's world. Where the shadows of those effected by the game and the curse <br />
itself now wandered. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's beautiful isn't it Gomorrah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Golgatha.&quot;<br />
<br />
And to think, all that had to do was die, and surrender their souls completely to the <br />
infinite chaos twisting them into something that wasn't human. It was quite worth such a <br />
minor price for their paradise on Earth. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
 Mal'akh shivered, &quot;Gaal? That was... that was the name of the witch?&quot; The police officer <br />
from centuries before asked easily the one who had been part of the gallery the longest <br />
by over a century. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that was what Amy said the name of the witch was.&quot; Amy said. <br />
<br />
The lioness Mal'akh remembered. <br />
<br />
She remembered a little boy with a pet dog. She remembered a sister a year older than <br />
him. She remembered how the little boy had been her before her transformation into a <br />
statue of Glendale's art gallery by a prejudice fellow officer decades later. <br />
<br />
 Mal'akh remembered the little boy, the dog, and the little bit older sister playing catch in <br />
a field of flowers. <br />
<br />
Mal'akh remembered the woman in the red dressed and black cape, with the very large <br />
snake on one arm. A woman with black hair hanging over half her face with a black cat <br />
nearby. And another blond woman with nonsense braids with a crow on her shoulder. <br />
<br />
Mal'akh remembered her slightly bigger sister being offered candy. Mal'akh remember <br />
quoting their parents about the dangers of strangers, Mal'akh remembered the slightly <br />
older sister telling the little boy to be quiet. <br />
<br />
Their pet dog had snarled, and leapt at the woman who had introduced herself as Gaal. <br />
Gaal side stepped the animal, dropping the candy. The pet dog leap didn't stop mid air <br />
like in a story book and continued, rammed into the crow, breaking it's neck at once. The <br />
who had introduced herself and Gomorrah held her head and -screamed- in a <br />
combination of pain and loss calling out a name in dismay. <br />
<br />
Then Gomorrah snarled something, and the pet dog's body seemed to boil from the <br />
inside... The woman who had introduced herself as Golgatha back handed her and began <br />
arguing.  <br />
<br />
His sister took the candy and ate it, then she began to giggle, laugh, and never stopped <br />
sniggering, the look in her eyes, it reminded the little boy of nothing less than a mad <br />
animal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sis? SIS! SIS You okay!&quot; Bobbi said shaking the lioness. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were in la-la land.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Gaal, that was the name of the woman who drove my sister insane. No, insane is too <br />
kind, she drove her stark, raving mad. ... It seems not all witches use poison apples.&quot; <br />
<br />
Serenity was still being amazed at the lions from the library were effectively from the <br />
past, &quot;Well, she's gone now, and she won't be causing anymore suffering, and now her evil <br />
is as dead as the rest of her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Serenity then shuddered, a sick feeling at the back of her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great Uncle Scoutts?&quot; Gill asked.<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity said, &quot;It feels like a turn being used be...it constantly, it's just there, <br />
there's no flash, or pulsing, it's like a oozing wound.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice shivered, &quot;I do not have the power to sense the actions of the curse.&quot; Said the glass <br />
pup of seven and a half years. &quot;But I still fear that might be the witches' doing, or <br />
whatever is left of the witches to begin with...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Focus on writing out the words needed sweetie.&quot; Jensen said. <br />
<br />
&quot;For the record, I'm coming.&quot; Trevor said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Brian said, &quot;If you're part of our pride now, then you're the pride's cub now, and that <br />
means you stay out of danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor shivered as new instincts told him to listen to what the older lion was saying, <br />
however, &quot;I have to, for Judas, his family has been trying for three hundred years to make <br />
amends, this is my chance to do that for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whose Judas?&quot; The wolves, the pack, and, well, everyone save Mary, Paul and Madam <br />
Serenity. <br />
<br />
&quot;Father Mike's pet cat.&quot; Said the new gray and black lion cub. &quot;He's a direct descendant of <br />
the familiar of one of the witches... Or he implied as much at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no proof that their familiar would be in the black soup as well.&quot; The once Irish <br />
now African woman said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not but... it just doesn't feel right unless they were... &quot; Trevor admitted, &quot;And <br />
Judas is a CAT, and he's been very un-house-cat-like in doing what he's done. He -<br />
wants- to make up or it. BUt he's not here, I am. He's my friend. He saved my life. I owe <br />
him.&quot; True he didn't remembered if Judas said if it as father Mike who found Trevor, but <br />
right now Trevor needed all the leverage he could get. <br />
<br />
All in all, Trevor wasn't sure what felt more alien to him right now, walking on two legs <br />
again, or suddenly being eight year old again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <br />
<br />
Brian said, &quot;... Gabriel, Elise, protect this cub with your lives. And keep him from doing <br />
anything stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; The lion and lioness nodded. <br />
<br />
Gill didn't even bother to interrupt this time on Brian being an upstart considering he was <br />
just a civilian here like Felicity. Still, if this lion-man wanted to be a cop, Gill was going to <br />
make sure he had the dos and don't hammered into him! And his wife too. <br />
<br />
Wanda said, &quot;You had better tell us everything and anything you know about your island, <br />
otherwise it sounds like this is going to be a very unpleasant fight...&quot; <br />
<br />
Bernie said, &quot;There is one other thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone looked at her, &quot;If these witches are just... you said shadows? Can they really <br />
answer the turns anymore than an automatic teller? And since they're just a 'ghost in the <br />
machine' of the curse's 'programming' that means you'll have to be in Amy's, I mean, the <br />
witch's dream world or whatever for you to turn their own game against them... sounds <br />
like it won't be easy...&quot; <br />
<br />
The Alice said, &quot;I am indestructible... do not worry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't mean invincible little girl.&quot; GIll said sternly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please let her work.&quot; Jensen implored remembering the time they had wasted when Alice <br />
hadn't completed the wording in time for the ToD to turn the lions into mindless <br />
mundane earth worms... Jensen decided that he'd be keeping that now defunct plan to <br />
himself for the rest of this lifetime!  <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine!&quot; Gary said, &quot;Let learn everything we can and plan everything we're going to do while <br />
your kid figure out how to screw over the literal genie!&quot; <br />
<br />
And the clock struck one AM.</p>
