<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen got to school ten minutes before classes were supposed to begin.  However, when she pulled up, things began to get a little strange.<br />
<br />
The first thing that happened was that she left her backpack behind.  She could see it on the seat beside her, but she wasn't able to stop herself and go back to retrieve it.  She just kept walking at a brisk pace, heading towards the school - it was bizarre.  It was like someone was forcing her to walk away.<br />
<br />
The second thing was that she saw a friend of hers, Emily, but she wasn't able to say anything to her.  And Emily didn't glance at her, or show any signs that she'd passed another human being.  And Emily was the sort of social person that would attempt to talk with anyone that passed by her, regardless of whether or not she liked them.  <br />
<br />
Something was very, very wrong.<br />
<br />
She kept walking in silence, heading towards the library.<br />
<br />
It wasn't too large.  There were a few shelves of books, but since it was a high school, there weren't that many items available for reading.  Mostly, it was just for reference, and even then, in this day and age, most people just used the internet.  Only geeks hung out here - she'd seen a few of them actually spend their lunch hours in here.  <br />
<br />
The librarian didn't even glance up as she walked in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Jenny called.  &quot;HEY!  HELP ME!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
There was a casual area with some comfortable chairs and a coffee table, even though drinks weren't technically allowed.  The librarian sometimes let them take in coffee, however, since she was addicted to the stuff herself.  <br />
<br />
She walked over to the chairs, her heart thudding in her chest.<br />
<br />
No...she thought.  No, it can't be possible.<br />
<br />
She moved one of the chairs aside.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; she screamed.  &quot;I don't want to do this!&quot;<br />
<br />
She tried to run away, but couldn't.<br />
<br />
Against her will, she stepped forward to where the chair once was.  She stood there in silence, wondering what was going to happen to her.  Surely she wasn't really going to transform into a chair.  Who had ever heard of such a ludicrous thing before?  It was such a stupid transformation.  She was probably still dreaming.<br />
<br />
Then her butt began to itch.  She frowned, and reached behind.  She wasn't able to move from her spot, but she could still move her arms, and she could feel two lumps start to grow out from her butt.  What the hell was up with THAT?<br />
<br />
She continued to feel them as they started to grow, pushing out further and further, and she felt them...they were hard and smooth...and felt an awful lot like wood...<br />
<br />
&quot;HELP ME!!!!&quot; she shouted.  &quot;PLEASE!  SOMEONE!&quot;<br />
<br />
But no one reacted.  The librarian acted as though she were completely alone, taking a sip of her coffee.<br />
<br />
Her knees started to ache, and she was forced to bend her legs, grunting.  &quot;Oh God, oh no...&quot; she whispered.  She continued to bend her knees...more and more...until she fell backwards, and landed on the lumps that had grown out from her butt.  She remained in a seated position...except she wasn't sitting on any chair.  <br />
<br />
She was becoming the chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;HELP ME!&quot; she shouted.<br />
<br />
Her legs started to harden.  She watched as her lower legs grew darker and darker, and smooth, like the lumps that had grown out of her butt.  She now had chair legs instead of normal legs...everything from the waist down was artificial, a piece of furniture.  She tried to rock back and forth, to get away from this nightmare, but she couldn't bring herself to do it.<br />
<br />
And then she had the most powerful orgasm she had had in a long time.  She let out a scream, and then shuddered, and looked down, trying to figure out what had caused it.<br />
<br />
Her lap and crotch were pulsating.  Her thighs spasmed and she orgasmed again as the thighs drew towards each other and began to merge...and puff out.  Her lap was becoming the seat of the chair, cushioned, the same dark blue as her dress.  She watched in horror as they became smooth, with a slight fabric fuzz on top.  She felt her lap...she could still feel everything...but instead of legs, she had the bottom of a chair.  It was surreal to feel a chair, and yet feel herself touching herself.<br />
<br />
And she looked down and gasped as her vagina shoved it's way forward, appearing, a slight slit that was almost impossible to see.  She still had her sex it seemed.<br />
<br />
She gasped as her back seized up, forcing her to sit upright.  &quot;Oh no!&quot; she cried.  She watched as her slim waist expanded slightly, conforming to the shape of a chair...but she could tell from glancing down that she still had a slightly human shape to her.  <br />
<br />
Her breasts started to tingle, and she watched in horror as they started to grow and become wider...almost merging together, to become some kind of bizarre headrest.  She reached up and they felt very fluffy, and she moaned when she touched herself, and orgasmed once more.  This whole process was sick - she shouldn't be getting pleasure from turning into FURNITURE...and yet, here she was.  <br />
<br />
She was now almost completely a chair.  She could only move her arms.<br />
<br />
And they were the last thing to change. <br />
<br />
They started to move on their own, without her direction.  They went to her sides.  &quot;No...NO!&quot; she protested, trying to move them.  But it was pointless.  They started to harden, turning into wood, and elongated, joining with her legs, becoming twin pairs of armrests.<br />
<br />
And with that, her transformation was complete.  She was now a human chair.  Only her head was still human.  She could still turn her neck, and she still had her hair.  But from the neck down, she was an inanimate object.  A piece of cursed furniture.<br />
<br />
And that's when she remembered the OTHER part of her curse.<br />
<br />
Two girls walked into the library.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Mrs. C!&quot; said one happily.<br />
<br />
It was Amy and Karen.  Two of her friends!<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys!&quot; Jennifer shouted.  &quot;GUYS!  HELP ME!  It's JENNY!&quot;<br />
<br />
But they ignored her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if we have some coffee before the bell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Mrs. C said hesitantly.  &quot;Oh sure, go ahead.  I don't mind.  But be quick!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot; Amy said pleasantly.  They walked over towards Jenny.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys!  Stop!  HELP ME!&quot; Jennifer shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, it's my favorite chair!&quot; Amy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww...that's MY favorite chair too!&quot; Karen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!  Guys, DON'T!&quot; Jennifer shouted, trying to plead with them.  &quot;You really don't want to sit on me!&quot;  There was something she never thought she'd say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you what,&quot; Amy said.  &quot;I'll flip you for it!&quot;  She took out a coin...</p>
