<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Dan had experimented sexually with his horse hung cock and large balls and muscled body he decided to go <br />
dancing at a gay bar.<br />
<br />
He had tried men. He had tried women. He had tried old. He had tried young. All this sex and still he wasn't <br />
tired of of experimenting.<br />
<br />
When he got to the bar all the men and several of the hags were drooling all over him. All but one chubby bear <br />
in a black leather jacket, leather chaps and boots sitting at the end of the bar watching the room in the <br />
mirror behind the bar.<br />
<br />
Dan watched as he would gaze this way and that and soon a stool came open next to him.<br />
<br />
Shirley Temple please. Dan asked.<br />
<br />
That's a rather piss poor drink don't you think, the bear said to him.<br />
<br />
Who do you think you are.<br />
<br />
The bear just grumbled.<br />
<br />
Dan wondered why this chubby guy was here in the bar. Hadn't he made changes to the world? No ugly people.<br />
<br />
Why don't you have a man's drink.<br />
<br />
And what would that be? Dan asked.<br />
<br />
Well I would suggest a beer with a tequila shooter for most people but seeing that you obviously would <br />
probably get toasted on a lite beer.<br />
<br />
Dan soon ordered the beer and tequila shooter and had downed the shot and was chugging the beer. The bear <br />
chuckled as he saw the boy drink this and shiver in a way the made it obvious that he had never had either <br />
before in his life.<br />
<br />
It wasn't long before Dan was slurring his words as he tried to prove to this man that he could drink like a <br />
man. Why he wanted to prove it to him he didn't know but it only took 3 drinks before he was so toasted that <br />
he was leaning up next to the bear.<br />
<br />
The two left the bar and Dan gave the bear his wallet so that he could find his address to take him home.<br />
<br />
When he woke the bear was sitting at his computer and that vile sunlight was streaming through the window. <br />
That was odd since it never got to that point till well into the afternoon.<br />
<br />
What are you doing over there. Dan asked abruptly as he tried to sit up and his head began to spin. Oh god. <br />
Dan plopped back to bed and tried to rest his head on the pillow that felt like sand paper filled with bricks. <br />
How had he gotten to this point.<br />
<br />
Ah I remember he said to himself. That beer and tequila.<br />
<br />
He closed his eyes trying to shut out the sun that was even now burning into his brain.<br />
<br />
I see you have an interesting setup here.<br />
<br />
Just a little customization.<br />
<br />
Yea I see that.<br />
<br />
What's this little program? The bear asked him.<br />
<br />
I don't know what are you looking at?<br />
<br />
This program.<br />
<br />
What's your name? I can't just keep saying hey you.<br />
<br />
Paul. My name's Paul and it looks like a morphing program but with all sorts of options.<br />
<br />
Leave that alone. Dan said almost screaming hearing the echo reach to the depths of his skull and back again.<br />
<br />
Oh don't worry Paul said. He had been playing with the program and had reduced the IQ level of Dan to that of <br />
a dullard and hit go.<br />
<br />
Dan felt the change but as soon as it had completed the world changed to view this change as normal for Dan. <br />
And Paul came over and sat heavily on the side of the bed. He began to trace Dan's abdomen with a furry finger <br />
and started to talk to him. Dan only barely realized what Paul was saying. So you want to know why I am the <br />
only &quot;ugly&quot; guy in the world. You may think furry fat bears are ugly but I find them very sexy. But I never <br />
once made changes to the world like you did. My Chronivac protected me from your changes and so I am still the <br />
chubby bear you see before you. I wasn't sure who had made the changes but I figured sooner or later I would <br />
find you. As you slept last night, and no we didn't have sex, I got into your computer and btw who uses <br />
password as their password. I found your scan and made the changes that you now feel. The duration I set to <br />
permanent and once I hit go and the changes have been made I set up a program to wipe the hard disk and the <br />
malicious program, the Chronivac, from your system. I made you too dumb to know what that is and even if you <br />
got a new copy of it you would be unable to use it. I left your body the way it was but I did increase the <br />
size of your balls to grapefruit sized balls. I moved your orientation to weighted toward gay but you could <br />
participate in straight entertainment too. But now, and here is the really pernicious option, I made you a <br />
total bottom. Even if you participate in straight sex you will have to be fucked with a dildo by a woman to <br />
get you off.<br />
<br />
Paul got up and left Dan to recuperate from his night binge removing any hint of the Chronivac or his previous <br />
life.</p>
