<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All three of them stared at the closed door. Each knew that they hadn't closed it when they had come in. &quot;I-I guess we sh-should o-open it&quot; Tiff said her voice full of fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew we shouldn't have come in here&quot; Katie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's too late now&quot; Rick said. &quot;We either play by the rules the voice set out for us or we die here. I don't see any other way out of this room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you're right&quot; Tiff sighed. &quot;I don't want to open that door though. There's no telling what will be behind it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it will just be a normal room&quot; Katie suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe but I doubt it&quot; Rick said. &quot;Look what happened to me.&quot; She cupped her new breasts to emphasize her point. &quot;I've been turned into a fucking girl. I'm willing to bet that the voice wasn't lying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speaking of you being a girl now&quot; Katie said. &quot;What are we going to call you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'll go with Rikki for now&quot; Rick said. &quot;I'll answer to it since people have called me Ricky when I was younger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds good&quot; Tiff said. &quot;So, who's going to open the door?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll help you decide!&quot; the voice boomed again. &quot;I'm thinking of a number from one to ten! The one who is farthest from it will be the one to open the door!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Four&quot; Rikki said without hesitation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Six&quot; Tiff said after taking a couple of seconds to think it over.<br />
<br />
Katie took a little longer to think. She didn't want to be the one to open the door but she didn't want Tiff or Rikki to open it either. One of them would have to open it though in order for them to leave. Finally she said &quot;One.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The number that I was thinking of is four!&quot; the voice boomed. &quot;Katie is the one to open the door! Rikki, for guessing the number correctly you'll be transformed back into your old self when you leave if you so choose! Now go through the door and begin your journey to find your way out!&quot; The voice laughed an evil laugh slowly fading away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I guess we should get started&quot; Katie said gulping. &quot;The sooner we do the sooner we can get out of here.&quot; She went to the door and reached out a trembling hand to the handle. Once she gripped the handle a wave of warmth spread through her. It felt nice and it seemed like it melted her fear away. She turned the handle and opened the door though this time there wasn't that eerie squeak.<br />
<br />
Beyond the door all Katie could see was the other room. She smiled and said &quot;The voice was lying. It's just a room.&quot; With that she stepped over the threshold into the other room. As she did she felt a curious sensation flow over her. It was like stepping through a sheet of water that wasn't coming from any direction. Like someone had poured water into a sheet and the stood it up. Once her eyes were over the threshold she knew that she had been wrong.<br />
<br />
She kept walking into where she now found herself and looked around. It looked like the changing room at a public pool. Looking down at herself she noticed that her clothes had been replaced by a lime green one piece swimsuit. She looked back to where she thought the door was only to see Tiff and Rikki walk through a solid wall. There was a faint blue outline around them when they did. They both stopped and looked around. They looked down at themselves only to find that they were wearing the same lime green one piece that she was. Rikki turned around and put her hands on the wall they had just come through.<br />
<br />
&quot;We c-can't g-get b-back&quot; Rikki said clearly shaken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what do we d-do now?&quot; Tiff asked just as shaken as Rikki.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we have to solve the mystery here&quot; Katie said surprisingly calm. &quot;If we solve it we get to move on to the next room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be careful girls&quot; the same voice they had heard before said in a whisper. &quot;You can be hurt and die. The last group that came in weren't and they died. You'll probably run into their bodies as you search. In fact I think one is around the corner.&quot; The voice quietly laughed and faded away.<br />
<br />
They looked at each other and with an unspoken agreement the went around the corner of a wall into what appeared to be the showers. They stopped short when they saw the body laying on the floor. Katie recognized her as Shannon. She was completely nude and her throat looked like it had been ripped out by some wild animal. Her right breast was missing looking like it had been torn off. Her belly had been sliced open and her guts removed and plopped down beside her. Her legs were spread wide to show that her pussy had been savaged too. There were a couple of oddities in this seen. Her face had a look of sexual bliss on it which was totally inconsistent with what her body presented. The other thing was that there wasn't much blood. It was like she had been drained before she was savaged.<br />
<br />
Katie had trouble keeping her lunch down and it looked like Rikki was having the same problem. Tiff however couldn't hold her lunch down and up it came. The sound of it hitting the floor was bad enough but then the rancid smell hit her and Katie could no longer keep her lunch down. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Rikki lose her lunch too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what h-happened to her?&quot; Tiff asked after she was done vomiting.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I d-don't know&quot; Katie said after she was done vomiting. &quot;Though I think we need to find out before it happens to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
They heard soft footsteps behind them that suddenly stopped. Just a few seconds later they heard a woman scream behind them and then run out. Katie, Tiff, and Rikki just stayed there on their knees staring at Shannon's body. Soon the police arrived and gently escorted the three of them out of the changing room.</p>
