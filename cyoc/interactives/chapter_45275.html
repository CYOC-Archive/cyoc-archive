<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim was sitting on his bed, holding one of the lingerie catalogs he had borrowed from the stash one his friends had. He was alone in the house and he relaxed, opening a page at random from the catalog. The model was wearing a baby doll, coupled with some silk panties and a pair of pumps, all in black, with matching lace gloves and diamond jewelry, it was simply perfect. Jim pulled down his boxers and began to stroke his dick, working slowly at first. After 5 minutes or so, he felt something around his body, something like nothing he had felt before, and actually quite nice. With his eyes closed, he began to move faster, and came only seconds later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; he thought opening his eyes, &quot;That was actually pretty intense...&quot; and he leaned over the bed to take a tissue from the box nearby and clean the more than likely mess he just did. Just as he reached the box with his hand, he noticed the glove he was wearing over it. Startled, he looked down, noticing the change of the rest of his clothes. His shirt had turned black and was made of a much softer and lighter material, just like his old boxers, that looked just like a pair of panties. Confused, he took one of the gloves off. Or at least, tried to, as no matter how he tried it wouldn't budge an inch. Trying the other glove was just as unsuccessful, and it was when he gave it a strong pull when he felt something hitting him in his cheek. Startled, he reached up to his face and felt something that dangled from his ears. Giving one of them a quick tug, he yelped in pain as it pulled firmly from his ear, almost as they were...<br />
<br />
&quot;Earrings?&quot; asked Jim out loud, more confused than ever. &quot;What the...?&quot; Looking around, he noticed the closet. He needed to see what had happened to him and take everything off him.<br />
<br />
Jim got up from the bed, noticing for the first time the heels he was wearing. Carefully, he took some steps that made him almost fall over. Leaning on the nearby desk for support, he went to his closet and pulled one of the doors open. Only thinking about the full-length mirror inside, he didn't expect the colorful variety of clothes he found inside. All of his clothes were gone, replaced with a wide range of skimpy dresses, tops, miniskirts, baby dolls, corsets and many others in different colors and materials. All of his shoes had also disappeared, leaving behind and assortment of heels in the form of boots, pumps and sandals. Shocked, Jim finally noticed his own reflection in the mirror. Just as he feared, he was wearing a black baby doll and silk panties, along with the black lace gloves and heels. To finish his looks, a diamond necklace was around his neck, with matching earrings on his ears and (much to his dismay) a piercing on his nose and another one on his navel, that could be see through the opened front of the baby doll. He was wearing the exact same clothes as the model in the lingerie catalog. It was an outfit loved to see on a woman, but on him it just looked ridiculous, to say the least. Not sure about what to do, he figured the best was to take everything off and find some other clothes to wear and then try to make any sense of everything that just happened.<br />
<br />
Thinking about how the gloves refused to move moments before, he tried the baby doll and found himself able to take it off without any resistance. Next, he slid the panties and let them go down to the floor, stepping out of them. Looking in the mirror, he noticed the gloves and the jewelry were nowhere to be seen. Intrigued, he felt his hands and neck, but there was nothing there. Somewhat relieved, Jim opened opened the other half of the closet, just to be met by dozens upon dozens of skimpy clothes, just as he thought. <br />
<br />
Reaching for one of the hangers, he pulled out one set of leather halter top and matching shorts and looked at it. &quot;I guess I'm going to borrow something from my father's.&quot; Just as he was going to put it back in the closet, a sensation ran through his groin and chest, as a pair of blue french-cut panties and a matching bra appeared on him. Dumbfounded, Jim could only look down and then in the mirror, as some silver hoops appeared on his ears, dangling almost all the way to his shoulders, and several necklaces popped into existence, resting between the empty cups of the bra. This time,however, just as he was still assessing the situation, Jim could see makeup quickly fading into existence. His lips acquired a bright shade of red, while his eyes were covered with eyeshadow that matched the lingerie he was wearing and his eyelashes grew longer and thicker. Raising his hand up, he could only see in horror how his fingernails grew before his eyes, taking a feminine appearance and changing to bright blue. He frantically watched his face and nails several times, letting go a scream. Overwhelmed, he passed out in front of the closet.</p>
