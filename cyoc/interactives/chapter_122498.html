<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle&#39;s voice broke through over the phone before Jennifer could respond, causing her to bite her lip in frustration as she clenched the phone tighter. &quot;Too late! Now you get both, guess it really is a hard choice to make though isn&#39;t it?&quot; <br />
<br />
His taunting tone only infuriated Jennifer more as she screamed back at him. &quot;As if this insane curse is real anyways! You&#39;re just a freak with a fantasy!&quot; It surely couldn&#39;t be real, but all the same Jennifer couldn&#39;t help feeling a twinge of terror travel down her spine as she tried to think if she knew any stories from her friends about Transform or Dare at all to figure it out.<br />
<br />
In all honesty though she had no say in avoiding it at this point anyway, a fact that Kyle&#39;s words seemed to convey as he spoke with a weight of certainty. &quot;A fantasy huh? Well to be frank I am sort of doing this to bring about a fantasy, but you get to be lucky victim number one because of what you and your friends did. So let&#39;s get down to it shall we? Since you seem to be so sheepish in response to the curse you&#39;re going to become a sheep girl. What does that entail? Well let&#39;s see. . . .for starter&#39;s you&#39;ll never wear clothes again as you&#39;ll find them uncomfortable. Also sheep girls either have gray or white skin depending on their wool and hair color. Dark wool and hair means gray skin while the opposite means white. Curled horns are a must. The average breast size for sheep girls is also E to F cup, and they&#39;re extremely horny so have fun with a dripping pussy all the time. Mmmm before I forget, you&#39;ll also become a lesbian as all sheep girls are since I say so. Hehehe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer recoiled at the changes he had listed out. What kind of sick pervert was this guy!? She was about to yell in outrage when he continued. &quot;The wool will only cover your wrists, ankles, and neck though since the full body anthro stuff isn&#39;t my thing. Your feet though will turn into hooves. Since sheep girls are lesbians too, when they make love they can become pregnant so don&#39;t worry, you can still make a happy little family with your future wife, aren&#39;t I kind? In fact, to make things even easier on you on finding a wife. You and all subsequent sheep girls can turn humans into sheep girls too if you kiss, touch, or otherwise get bodily fluids on them, and to prevent a panic anyone changed into a sheep girl will think they&#39;ve always been one and everyone else will think so too. Except for you, you&#39;ll be aware of your change and others. Now for your dare, I dare you to not freak out after your change, never tell anyone about your change, never try to change yourself back, to go about your life as normal, and to forget about the Transform or Dare game altogether. I&#39;ll see you at school Jennifer, let&#39;s get this revolution started.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eyes wide, Jennifer was about to scream in rage at Kyle before he hung up the phone, but a shock coursed through her body instead, cutting her off as the phone cut off. &quot;W-what&#39;s going!? A-aaaaaaah~&lt;3&quot; Instead of pain, the shock actually felt pleasurable and caused Jennifer to moan as she felt warmth concentrate in her chest and groin. As she watched, Jennifer groaned while her breasts began to swell, straining against her bra as they grew larger and larger. &quot;The curse is real!? But that means. . . &quot; Gulping, Jennifer moaned again as she felt her sensitive mounds press against the fabric of her bra, her nipples rubbing against the bra until with a snap the strap broke and the undergarment was sent flying. Shivering, Jennifer reached up to fondle her jiggling breasts that had indeed become E cups. <br />
<br />
However, her changes didn&#39;t end there as she saw from her breasts that her skin was turning grey. If she remembered, that meant she was going to have dark hair or wool and a part of her couldn&#39;t help but be curious about the result. It didn&#39;t shock her either that she was calm, as Kyle had ordered her to not panic in the Dare portion. So instead she just enjoyed it, especially as the new grey of her skin reached her hips and groin. With another moan, Jennifer felt her hips push out and her ass expand while the sound of something wet dripping onto the floor reached her ears. As her skirt ripped and fell away, Jennifer knew what was making that sound as she reached to finger her now wet vagina, pants escaping her lips as she did so. She became so lost in her self pleasure that she didn&#39;t notice that her socks had burst when her feet turned into hooves until the sound of them clacking against the floor reached her. &quot;Oh god, this is wrong, but it feels so good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Licking her lips, Jennifer giggled as she watched her new grey skin reach her wrists and ankles where dark red wool began to sprout and cover the small areas. So it was red then, was what she thought to herself as similar wool ringed her neck soon after and her hair grew longer, just shy or her cute and ample butt, in the same shade of red. Once all her skin was grey, her breasts had swelled, and her wool had grown in, Jennifer thought she was done changing. However, as pain erupted from the sides of her head and she gave her first gasp of discomfort, she remembered she had still been missing her horns as they pushed out from her forehead, curling over before pointing out again on either side.<br />
<br />
Once the final change had happened to her, Jennifer blinked as she looked over herself. Biting her lip while she hefted her own breasts and rubbed her legs together to ease the arousal in her vagina that still leaked cumgirl onto the floor, the new sheep girl shook her head at the torn clothes on the ground as she said the only thing that came to mind. &quot;I guess I changed like he said. . . .how did he do that!?&quot;</p>
