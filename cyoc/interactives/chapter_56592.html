<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Pregnant?&quot; Sunny thinks first of course, children had always been the last thing on her <br />
mind, mostly due to poor forethought on what being the trophy mate to a very powerful <br />
male lupman would mean. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry beautiful.&quot; Kira thought to the two fellow giant entry way statues. &quot;If you do <br />
get pregnant, there's a very easy way to tell I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is?&quot; Luna asked first. <br />
<br />
&quot;Simple. You won't be able to transform back from being immortal art for as long as the <br />
pregnancy would last naturally, and you'll form will slowly change with the perception filter <br />
still full intact of your belly slowly growing and all that jazz. Then a statue giving birth, and <br />
finally a new new batch of statues of new born pups would appear around you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sunny stiffened while Luna thought this over. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, look, we can stop right now if it scares ya that much. Ya can leave right now and <br />
sleep in yer own beds, I don't mind. I won't bring up the whole mating thing ever again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna asked, &quot;How do you even know that? How do you know the pregnancy wouldn't just <br />
be frozen during our time with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... Call it an educated guess. I do have more experience being part of the still world than <br />
you two lovelies. Like I said, we can stop right now if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Sunny finally thought at last, &quot;Let's keep going.&quot; <br />
<br />
So the three room sized statues remained in their pose of passionate love making all <br />
through the night. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
1689 June<br />
<br />
The half-aging leoman Rosa Daleson and the half-aging human Monica were the only <br />
non-members of the witches entourage to fully have their senses, or at least to see what <br />
was happening around them. On the one hand, Monica was happy that people were <br />
suddenly no longer treating her quite like the teenage girl she appeared to be but with <br />
respect... Except of course when she mentioned her old students and how they had gone <br />
funny in the head in her opinion. <br />
<br />
The heir to the throne Rosa Daleson likewise founds the other leoman no longer treating <br />
her quite so passive or off handedly, but at the same time, nobody so much questioned <br />
how the human's clothes were looking just a little bit looser, and the adult leoman and <br />
lupmans were all looking a little bit shorter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marie Cruz rejected much of what Linus said. 'Sure, I've killed people in the name of the <br />
church... but never without purpose or reason. It makes no sense that those following the <br />
christian creed 'Love your enemy' would slaughter innocent people. I'd like to see who <br />
wrote that history.' <br />
<br />
And from the version Marie had heard, the Crusades had served the purpose of off loading <br />
excess royalty. <br />
<br />
However, Marie Cruz for all her bias was no fool, and had no intention of saying no word of <br />
this to Linus because she had no intention of sparking a squabble with one of her own <br />
allies when the stakes were this high. So the Puritan and the Catholic silently agreed to <br />
disagree least they destroy each other before the witches got the chance to.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Much like a Shinto, and two different sects of Christianity would three hundred years later <br />
in the battle against Kurse.' Marie-Eliza thought while her mother herself stood behind her <br />
almost totally in silence. Marie-Eliza wanted to ask her mother to simply go home now <br />
but... her presence was very comforting to say the least. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Mal'Akh!&quot; Waved Joella happily at the female leoman cub as she entered the witches' <br />
grounds via the bright flowery thorn maze that separated it's way for her easily, Joella <br />
having accepted her as a playmate apparently making the maze see her as a non-threat <br />
and as 'one of them.' <br />
<br />
&quot;So you're Male-Arc!&quot; Said a naked human child with her hair in a dark pony tail, &quot;I'm Lark! <br />
Our names rhyme, isn't that gay?&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza beat everyone to the punch, &quot;This was three hundred years ago! The word 'gay' <br />
meant joyous or happy! And not even a hundred years ago that use of the word was still <br />
the most prevalent! Moving on!&quot; <br />
<br />
Mal'akh of course going around in just the fur herself didn't react that much to a naked <br />
human child being right next to her, let alone her being named after a bird (though it did <br />
leave Mal'akh wondering if the some the witches' children had been animals that had <br />
transformed into people).  <br />
<br />
But it was odd to find a human without that invisible wall that all humans seemed to have <br />
that kept them from being near each other. And Mal'akh finally got out, &quot;Actually it's Mal' <br />
Akh... no 'R' at the end there... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Okay Male-Akh!&quot; Lark answered in a slightly better pronouncing of the jewish name. <br />
<br />
Mal'akh tried to side step her but she seemed interested in her for some reason. &quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't act like all the other cubs here... there's, something, different about you.&quot; Lark <br />
said as she went into a classic thinking pose. That Lark herself couldn't remember anything <br />
about herself from two years ago was also odd, but she didn't dwell on it, she felt <br />
something push her mind along whenever she tried to, and she got bad headache when <br />
she tried to resist. <br />
<br />
'Maybe because I'm not funny in the head?' Mal'akh thought. And a chilling piece of logic <br />
far beyond her age hit her, 'If everyone here is funny in the head, then they're acting <br />
normal, am I the one then acting funny in the head then?' <br />
<br />
Lawrence said, &quot;There's actually a bit of discussion on weather if everyone in the world was <br />
mad, that the one sane man would therefore be the actual mad one since many forms of <br />
insanity are culturally defined...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But Mal'akh had no clue about that.&quot; Marie-Eliza said, &quot;She was just confronted with the <br />
warped harmony of a horde of mad children all acting in a way that somehow balanced <br />
each other out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lark.&quot; Joella said calmly putting a hand on Lark's bare shoulder, after all, she was friends <br />
with every single child, cub, and pup here.  &quot;Mal'akh wants to speak to me I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mal'akh cringed at that idea, who she actually wanted to talk to was being led by the hand <br />
by Joella, Mal'akh's sister Aimiliona. Who was looking at Mal'akh as if trying to figure out <br />
what she was all about. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh okay.&quot; Lark politely backed off, but got into a squatting position and simply looked <br />
intensely at the three as they interacted never taking her eyes off them. Jimmy eventually <br />
squatted down next to her mostly just because she was doing it. <br />
<br />
On the other side of the witches grounds, Afua dragged herself along. Her Master she <br />
hoped had finally given up looking for her, along with the friends he had asked to help <br />
track her down.  A piece of cloth covered the chain manacle around her left wrist she hadn't <br />
been able to get off.  She was tired, she was hungry, and she had even hallucinated that <br />
the trees had waved and motioned at her as she had fled nearly aimlessly with a vague <br />
direction of what she hoped was north from the farm where she had abandoned her fellow <br />
slaves in an attempt to gain freedom and person-hood for herself. <br />
<br />
She saw the large house, saw the many children, along a couple lupman pups, and... <br />
leoman? Yes Leoman! The lion men! She remembered the stories (that brought a beating to <br />
anyone who said them) how they would buy slaves and then release them once in northern <br />
lands.  She knew she'd be safe with them, right? <br />
<br />
&quot;I just have to make it a bit further...&quot; She whispered to herself, her throat dry. <br />
<br />
She got some ways closer to the house when she fell to her knees, and knew she was <br />
delusional again. A naked girl with pink hair in a bowl cut looked at her on her left. A girl <br />
with curly hair as red as rouge in a black and pink dress on her right, in front of her a boy <br />
with green hair in curl in overalls and shirt, and another naked girl with long blue hair <br />
behind her. <br />
<br />
She blacked out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is she okay?&quot; Becky asked from behind looking at the dark skinned woman, never having <br />
seen one before. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so.&quot; Said Rouge on the left. <br />
<br />
&quot;We oughta take her inside to mamas, I mean the witches...&quot; Said Oliver. <br />
<br />
&quot;Help me move her.&quot; Said Rosalie. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
The old woman looked up at her own ceiling as she went to sleep. <br />
<br />
'It's interesting when you stop and think about it. Even the almighty laws of cause and <br />
effect can not transform you, let alone magic or surgery. And yet, by that logic, you should <br />
have been frozen in time. But you have changed and aged and grown like any human <br />
being. And you'll continue to get older, until you die and are put in the ground like any <br />
other human being.'  Madam Serenity thought to herself. And she realized, 'If I exist as a <br />
human being always, therefore, all my ancestors had to be human too right? So there <br />
would be at least one line of humans left in the world... or when the lion-curse is through <br />
with everything will I be a unique mutant born to the world or changed by the Transform <br />
or Dare that zapped me in the first place? Oh well... at least the game will be dead and <br />
gone at last, and three hundred years of sick games and petty misery will be finally over.' <br />
<br />
She dreamed she was in a crowd cheering for Trevor as he wrested with his sister <br />
surrounded by different cuts of meat. <br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
With Judas keeping watch as well as the black cat was able to, Father Michael took the shift <br />
of sleeping while his brother continued his task of making more of the cure they aimed to <br />
have enough to cure the city in one sweep in roughly five days. <br />
<br />
Father Michael just hoped he and his brother were DONE with whatever insane or sick <br />
games reality seemed fixated with them for no apparent reason what so ever. <br />
<br />
Looking into the mirror before going to bed, it was disorienting and disturbing to see the <br />
ape man staring back. 'I know this is just the cure and the curse twisting around <br />
themselves or some other trick of sorcery. But I can imagine the militant atheist who <br />
cursed me and my brother would approve laugh her head off somewhere.'  On the other <br />
hand, he thanked God that his brother had been given at least half of his humanity back, <br />
even if the price had been half of Father Michael's, but all the same, it was a price the <br />
priest was more than willing to pay.</p>
