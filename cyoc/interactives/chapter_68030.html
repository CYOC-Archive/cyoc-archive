<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It did not take Leopold long before she found a suitable candidate in which to test the amulet out on and putting on her best &quot;coy girl&quot; routine, she soon had the boy following her about, desperate to do anything to please her. Learning that the boy's name was Daniel and that he was fifteen years old, Leopold slowly coaxed the boy into coming home with her, relying on tricks that her memories said she had used on children, though when that was, Leopold found herself at a lost as to when that was.<br />
<br />
Letting herself into the apartment, she turned toward the boy and gently leaned in to kiss him, her hand fumbling at his pants. As he grinned in an idiotic manner, she whispered, &quot;Want to try something new to add to your pleasure?&quot;<br />
<br />
Still grinning in an idiotic manner, the boy nodded as he returned Leopold's affection, whispering, &quot;Sure,&quot; as he ran a hand over her breasts.<br />
<br />
Smiling back, Leopold gently pushed away and heading for where he kept the rag and the chloroform, she told Daniel, &quot;Wait right there,&quot; and collecting the items she was searching for, she made an act of spreading the liquid on the rag and then pretended to breath it in, exclaiming, &quot;Oh, wow,&quot; as she did so.<br />
<br />
Daniel, still grinning, moved toward her and asked, &quot;What exactly does that do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dowsing the rag, Leopold handed it to Daniel as she explained, &quot;It blows your mind and heightens your awareness of everything around you.&quot; in a low, sexy voice.<br />
<br />
Hesitant, Daniel looked at the rag he had been offered, unsure if what he was doing was the right thing. As the girl he had met only hours ago moved closer to him and gently kissed him, he did nothing to oppose her as she gently guided his hand toward his mouth, covering his lower face with the rag. Breathing deeply, Daniel suddenly found that he liked whatever it was that he was breathing in and taking an even deeper breath, he watched as the world swam.<br />
<br />
Mumbling, &quot;What is this stuff,&quot; he blinked and suddenly thought for a moment that he was actually lying on the floor.<br />
<br />
Instead of answering him, the girl just smiled and kissed him. As she did so, she whispered, &quot;It totally rocks your world, doesn't it,&quot; as she took the rag, doused it once again and then handed back to him, which he quietly took and breathed in whatever was on it, nodding slowly as he did so.<br />
<br />
Kissing him again, Leopold waited a couple more seconds before finally pushing away from the prone figure on the floor. Standing, she made sure the door to the apartment was shut tightly and reaching inside her pocket, he pulled out the amulet. Gazing down at Daniels, she whispered, &quot;Say goodbye to everything you hold dear,&quot; and reach up, she began to shrug off her dress.<br />
<br />
After she had fully undressed, Leopold set the amulet on a nearby counter and then began remove Daniel's clothes. Gazing at the naked body now before her, she felt the guilty feeling come over her as her skin took on a flush appearance. Gently running a hand over the boy, Leopold watched as the sleeping figure of Daniel shifted and mumbled something. The feeling of shame building, Leopold turned away from Daniel and quickly located one of the articles of clothing the boy had been wearing, figuring this was what she needed in order to bring about the change.<br />
<br />
Picking up Daniel's boxer-briefs, Leopold grabbed the amulet off the counter and touched the two together as she pressed them into the back of her hand. Immediately, she felt the transformation take hold and before she could register what was happening, she grew a couple inches taller as the muscle mass throughout her body shifted.<br />
<br />
As she gazed down, watching her chest flatten out, she giggled as the penis and testicles she had had since birth pushed out and then shifted up, settling in place where they normally would go. Hair grew out across her legs, arms and chest as the hair on her head shrank.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this time, it doesn't hurt,&quot; Leopold thought as she, once again he, watched in wonder as his chest broadened a little bit and his feet doubled in size.<br />
<br />
Within moments of touching the clothes and the amulet, Leopold found himself fully transformed into an exact duplicate of Daniel. Dropping the amulet on the counter, he stood there for a moment as new memories flooded into his mind. After a couple seconds, he looked down at the boxer-briefs, the nude form of himself lying on the floor and suddenly feeling self-conscious about being naked in front of another dude, he began to dress, telling himself over and over, &quot;Your name is Daniel,&quot; as he did so.<br />
<br />
After he had dressed, Leopold/Daniel collected the amulet and figuring that he no longer needed the original Daniel, he collected the dog collar from off the table next to the chair.<br />
<br />
As he did that, the two came in contact with each other and then Leopold/Daniel's exposed skin. Dropping both, figuring that he was about be turned into a Chihuahua, he grinned when it became apparent that he wasn't changing and thinking, &quot;Maybe there is something that is preventing it from changing a person more than once within a new transformation. Like a time limit or recharge,&quot; he headed towards the sleeping form of the original Daniel.<br />
<br />
Squatting down, avoiding looking at the original Daniel's junk, Leopold/Daniels thought for a moment, wondering if he should kill the boy once he became a dog or just leave him. After a moment, he made up his mind and touching the amulet to original Daniel's exposed flesh, he watched for the second time as somebody turned changed species.<br />
<br />
When the transformation had completed itself, Leopold/Daniels fastened the collar around the dog's neck, pocketed the amulet and pushing the dog out into the hallway, he locked the door behind him. Afterward, he stared at the door and the key, thinking over what it was that he was about to do. Coming to a decision, he glanced down at the sleeping canine, muttered, &quot;Enjoy your new life,&quot; and tossing the key down the hall, he turned in the opposite direction and began making his way towards the stairs, the thought of his new life as Daniel keeping him from looking back.<br />
<br />
An hour passed and after a bit, the Chihuahua awoke, confused as to why he was lying in a hallway and where exactly he was. A thought came to his mind, a thought that he might have been drugged, robbed and raped by whoever the mystery girl had been. Blinking, he forced himself to stand and as he stared walking, he stopped as he realised that everything was a lot bigger.<br />
<br />
Shifting wildly about, it took him a moment to come to the understanding that the reason everything looked the way it did was because he had been turned into a dog. Whimpering, horrified and terrified at what he had discovered he thought, &quot;What the hell,&quot; as he redefined what had happened to him, but unsure how it happened to him. After a moment, still whimpering, unsure who he really was, but sure that it wasn't a dog, he began to once again to move down the hall, determined to find out who he was, how this happened and how to undo to it.</p>
