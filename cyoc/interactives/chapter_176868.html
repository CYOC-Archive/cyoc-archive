<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The winter snows weren&#39;t that bad on Heiya Island. From things a young teen that had been among the large ring of young women and girls that been kidnapped and rescued thanks to the efforts of Interpol and various law enforcement agencies across Asia named Mizu had heard, it was cooler and more temperate than places like Mieni, but in some ways Mizu was also fairly used to temperate climates. That left her happy at her freedom and even comfortable with staying on an island that was populated by Animalians. They had all been kind and generous to her in their treatment of her. That was something that Mizu liked and it left her free to actually study some of the other Animalians as they went about their days.<br />
<br />
One of her scouting missions took her to the exercise area where Muxing was going about her normal exercises. In many ways, Mizu also found herself impressed by Muxing&#39;s almost fluid movements as she balanced on her tail and even moved over certain obstacles that were set up. She sat quietly and tried to stay out of the way, though Muxing finished her exercise for the day she approached the point where Mizu was sitting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you with something?&quot; Muxing asked to Mizu as she approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just watching, I didn&#39;t mean to intrude,&quot; Mizu actually jumped up a bit in surprise and fear of having irritated the Chinese Green Tree Viper Animalian and one that was one of the Five Elements which had become celebrities on Heiya Island.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not intruding,&quot; Muxing assured the young woman, &quot;there are a fair number that often come to watch my sisters and I practice. A few even ask for lessons. So, while I do prefer my privacy... you aren&#39;t intruding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Mizu asked, looking a bit more hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Muxing nodded, &quot;can I help you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Mizu,&quot; Mizu answered, &quot;and well, I&#39;ve been looking into being an Animalian. My... my family was among those that the ring that kidnapped often killed. So I&#39;ve had no one left. And since your government here has offered to allow for conversions, I thought I&#39;d look around to see what ones that would work out well. And... well... your ability to balance on your tail is well... appealing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you would wish become like me?&quot; Muxing asked while tilting her head with curiosity evident on her face and triangular head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well not a viper,&quot; Mizu answered, &quot;I&#39;m not really interested in something that&#39;s venomous. But your ability to balance and move... THAT I like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; Muxing replied, &quot;well there are various species of snakes that aren&#39;t venomous and come from all over the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And something that can swim, but isn&#39;t a sea snake might be good too,&quot; Mizu commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like the Anaconda?&quot; Muxing asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... something more graceful,&quot; Mizu answered, &quot;then maybe you could give me some lessons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In martial arts, I probably could,&quot; Muxing replied with a smile.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It took a few days and Muxing chose to help Mizu with many of the details. She found Mizu to be reasonably intelligent and coping with many of the same sorts of things that Muxing and her sisters went through. It was something that Muxing felt was frightening in many ways, and was glad that Mizu seemed fairly well adjusted. That let the two of them look over various snake species that would more aquatic but non-venomous. Eventually Mizu settled on the Common Watersnake, a species of non-venomous snake from North America. Muxing was even willing to go with Mizu to the Horizon facility on Heiya Island.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... this will be the day,&quot; Mizu said to Muxing as the female Animalian approached and then corrected her mask to keep things comfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Muxing nodded, &quot;and you&#39;ll be well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Animalia&#39;s colonies at Mieni and Heiya Island were extremely safe from things related to Covid, but a lot of that had to do with them being islands and screening was easier to do. This carried with it the responsibilities of preventing the spread of the disease, and with some countries like the US still having the disease largely being uncontrolled, Animalia&#39;s colonies continued to maintain tight controls, and this presently included both any potential tourists and would be especially big with the fact that Heiya Island appeared to be the destination for those that were rescued from these various kidnapping groups.  That left Mizu free to go through her transformation while Muxing followed.<br />
<br />
The primary move was to focus on going through with the conversion. Muxing stayed close to provide protection and comfort, which Mizu welcomed. The staff welcomed them and Muxing was able to follow along and waited quietly as they went in. She waved politely to Mizu as the young woman was lead inside the conversion room with one of the lead scientists for Horizon. Shortly after they went in, the scientist came out, snapping a lone orange cap back onto the syringe that held the Common Water Snake dose of the Animalia Virus in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mizu only got one dose?&quot; Muxing asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was what she requested,&quot; the doctor answered, &quot;so that is all we gave her. And given her age... that may be good for her healing in the long term. And she told me it was in the hopes that you would still be her friend...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would always be her friend,&quot; Muxing argued, &quot;I just thought... that she&#39;d double dose to get all the cures from what was done to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Given her age, one dose would probably heal any and all physical injuries,&quot; the doctor informed Muxing, &quot;mental and psychological injuries would take more than that. As should already be known...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope she&#39;ll be alright,&quot; Muxing managed, pulling her lower lips back and down.<br />
<br />
Muxing waited a few moments more in nervous silence. Her mind hoped that Mizu was fine and wasn&#39;t too troubled by things mentally. She&#39;d actually made relatively decent friends with the young Japanese teen and was shocked to find that there might have been some mental trauma that was still there. She&#39;d heard and understood that some of the girls that had been kidnapped were dealing with those sorts of issues. She&#39;d even seen it with several taking interest in Ami&#39;s former profession for no reason other than what the kidnappers had encouraged, but with Ami, Manami, and Rose all taking interest in helping them in some way, Muxing had felt that they had recovered. And as Mizu and Muxing had researched over snakes and the specific species that Mizu would wish to become, Muxing had thought that Mizu HAD recovered. The doctor&#39;s report only made her worry. That left her almost wringing her tail until the door opened and a dark brown and brown banded snake Animalian emerged from the conversion room. She wore Mizu&#39;s shirt and lavender skirt and looked to Muxing, tasting the air with her tongue a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ssso, Muxxxxxing,&quot; Mizu spoke slowly, &quot;how do I look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... not super flashy,&quot; Muxing answered, &quot;but you do long stronger than before. Are you okay? The doctors said you only requested one dose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesssss, only one,&quot; Mizu said slowly, &quot;I promissssssed my mom when I wasssss little that I&#39;d take no short cutsssss. That would include with my converssssssssssssion.&quot;<br />
<br />
That brought a sigh of relief from Muxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I&#39;d hope for practiccccccccce with my new tongue,&quot; Mizu smiled, &quot;and that my coach would help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would be happy to help,&quot; Muxing smiled, &quot;How do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; Mizu answered, which got Muxing to smile and nod.</p>
