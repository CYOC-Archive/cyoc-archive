<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;If you could change anything?&quot; Matt said, looking to Chris.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything? I&#39;d change everything! I&#39;d be bigger, stronger, more attractive, maybe able to grow a beard..&quot; Chris began to list off his grievances with his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s start off with just one thing, though.&quot; Matt had Chris&#39; stats up on the Chronivac, just waiting for an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;One thing?&quot; Chris propped himself up on his elbow and looked over at Matt. &quot;Bigger dick. Like, porn star, hung like a horse, can&#39;t hide it dick.&quot; It was one thing Chris really hated, he was small and scrawny but so was what was between his legs, he kept himself hidden even in the dorm showers, Matt had caught glimpses of it in the room and, yeah, he could see why Chris would pick that. &quot;Look at some of those porn guys, people will forgive any looks if you got some massive meat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt started fiddling with Chris&#39; stats, then got a wicked idea... He did say hung like a horse...<br />
<br />
He hovered over the button to start the change, but quickly made one more change, shifting Chris from straight to bi. Matt himself was gay, something he had so far hidden from his girl obsessed roommate, maybe they could bond a bit more if that change stayed in place, or at least he wouldn&#39;t have to listen to him fawn over just girls and they could have something in common. Matt started the change and looked up to see what was happening.<br />
<br />
It was slow at first, Chris didn&#39;t even seem to notice that the front of his shorts were starting to push out, and not from an erection. At least until the bulge got too obvious to ignore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! Are you seeing this?! Did you..?!&quot; Chris suddenly sat up as he noticed the stretching of the fabric. Without even thinking that his roommate could see him, he pushed down the waistband of his shorts and underwear, causing his growing cock to flop free. It was half-erect now, and probably a good seven inches in length with a pair of egg sized balls behind it, he was still mostly hairless though, with only a small bit of pubes around the base.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup! Got a program that lets you change yourself or other people.. thought I&#39;d try it out.&quot; Matt grinned and folded his hands together behind his head, glad the desk hid his own below average erection at seeing his roommates large cock.<br />
<br />
That cock though was still growing, Chris&#39; shorts were down around his ankle and he had his shirt pulled up, staring at it as it kept growing, becoming fully erect at nine inches. &quot;Holy crap, dude..&quot; He reaches down and could barely fit his meat in his hand. On his small frame it looked even more massive.<br />
<br />
Thick veins bulged out on the side as it pushed itself out to eleven inches, his lemon sized balls swelling on either side and pushing Chris&#39; legs apart. As it passed twelve inches, dark splotches began to appear on the shaft. &quot;Dude, what did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a little fun, we can always undo it or change it again.. relax.&quot; Matt was squirming in his chair, unable to take his eyes off the giant organ.<br />
<br />
Chris&#39; balls were now the size of oranges and hung low enough that they fell off the edge of the bed, a brownish fuzz starting to grow in the middle of the darkening scrotum. At thirteen inches a ring popped out around the middle of the shaft, the splotches continuing to darken to black. &quot;You didn&#39;t!&quot; Chris was suddenly glaring at his roommate.<br />
<br />
Fourteen inches and the mushroom head of the shaft was flattening out into a blunt end, taking on a distinctly inhuman shape. Skin started bunching up around the base of his cock as the brown fuzz completely engulfed his grapefruit sized balls which hung down to his knees. Still growing thicker and longer, the bunch of skin at the base started growing up the shaft, connecting the pendulous cock to Chris&#39; stomach, the brown fuzz growing up from his balls over the newly formed sheathe. At sixteen inches the growth finally came to a stop, thicker than Chris&#39; own arm. On his 5&#39;4&quot;, skinny frame it looked absolutely ridiculous, not to mention it was very obviously a horse cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you did say hung like a horse.&quot; Matt joked as he grinned.<br />
<br />
Chris hopped off the bed to confront his roommate and nearly tipped forward from the added weight of his new cock and balls. He quickly reached forward to grab it with both hands, the contact making him shudder and fall back on the bed. &quot;Fuck.. it&#39;s super sensitive, too..&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt got out of his seat and walked over to his roommate, sitting on the bed next to him. &quot;Can.. can I touch it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! No! It&#39;s still my cock, dude..&quot; Chris reacted shocked at first but then actually seemed to be giving it some thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, no one has to know, I&#39;m just curious.&quot; Matt put out his hand, and Chris didn&#39;t stop him. The flesh was practically hot under Matt&#39;s touch, and he could feel the whole shaft pulsing. This was a first for both of them, the first time Matt touched another guy&#39;s cock, and the first time Chris had anyone other than himself touch it.<br />
<br />
Chris started running his hands up and down the shaft without thinking, and Matt joined in, one hand rubbing the equine shaft while the other rubbed the large flat head. Years of pent up sexual frustration boiled to the surface, and Chris couldn&#39;t bring himself to tell his roommate to stop, in fact, he was enjoying the extra attention. Soon his balls were churning and he fell back on the bed, pumping away. &quot;Holy fuck!&quot; And he shot the most massive load he had ever produced, not that he had the balls to do so before. Globs of musky seed shot from his cock and splattered on the wall above his head like shotgun blasts. Matt even got some splattered on him.<br />
<br />
Chris lay on his bed panting for a good five minutes, his cock slowly softening and slipping inside its sheathe. Even tucked away the horse cock looked ridiculously over-sized on him. Matt meanwhile got up to clean off the spunk that had gotten on him, but kept looking back over at Chris, who finally seemed to be recovering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Matt, you&#39;ve had your fun.. can you please turn my cock human again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt dropped in his chair, having discarded his cum stained shirt in his laundry bin. &quot;I know you enjoyed that, too, but fine..&quot; He tapped away a bit on the screen as Chris blushed, trying not to think that he just got a hand job from his male roommate. Oddly, it didn&#39;t seem to bother him as much as he thought it would.<br />
<br />
After a moment, the sheath started to retreat back down Chris&#39; stomach, letting his cock flop free. The oversized organ was also shrinking in size, along with his balls to something a bit more manageable. Black splotches and dark skinned balls were returning to their familiar pink color as the flat head puffed out into the mushroom head of a human cock.<br />
<br />
Chris actually felt a small pang of regret as his cock continued to shrink away, not that he would have been able to live with that gigantic monster, but it had been kind of fun. Maybe later he could have Matt put it back for some fun.. What was he thinking? <br />
<br />
Eventually the changes stopped again, and Chris was left with about nine inches of flaccid cock hanging between his legs and a pair of lemon sized balls. Still a massive improvement over his old cock, and still a bit comical on his small body, but not outside the realm of possibility.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nine inches soft, a full foot hard. Completely human.&quot; Matt said as he leaned back in his chair, looking proud of himself.<br />
<br />
Chris stood up, and fortunately this time he didn&#39;t overbalance, but it still felt strange to have that heavy weight hanging at his crotch. Hell, even in pants there would be no hiding the bulge from this monster. &quot;Your turn.&quot; Chris said with a wicked smile Matt&#39;s way. He suddenly had some ideas for what he wanted to do to his roommate.</p>
