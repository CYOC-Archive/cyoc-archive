<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Glenn fell onto her knees but, managed to bring her arms in front of her quick enough so she wouldn&#39;t fall face first on the hard tiled floor in the shopping mall. The girls she was chatting with reacted shocked, as Emma, her best friend, helped her up. In the distance, her brother still stood, a trembling about how this gun actually shot someone, but relieved his big sister wasn&#39;t wounded.<br />
<br />
Glenn looked at her little brother, who was still holding the gun. Her expression turned to furious, where did her brother get it from? She walked towards him. &quot;Mike, give that to me!&quot; She shouted. The little boy offered it to her, and Glenn quickly snatched it out of his hand, pointing a finger to his forehead. &quot;Don&#39;t do that ever again to me alright? You scared me.&quot; She examined the gun. &quot;Where did you find this thing anyway? Is it one of those toy guns you can get from the theme park?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I found it laying next to that tree, I thought it wouldn&#39;t do anything.&quot; Little Mike answered. &quot;Oh my god,&quot; Glenn shook her head, &quot;Mike, how many times do I have to tell you, don&#39;t casually pick things up from the ground, don&#39;t even pick up anything that isn&#39;t yours! You should&#39;ve learned this when you were 5.&quot; Glenn&#39;s body was completely tensed up. Mike didn&#39;t have to know it, but if he really didn&#39;t know where this toy gun came from, she could&#39;ve been injured, maybe even killed.<br />
<br />
Glenn quickly turned to her friends, apologizing. &quot;Sorry girls, I think I&#39;m taking my brother home again. I&#39;ll see you later.&quot; Her friends agreed and understood, waving goodbye as Mike and Glenn walked home. Glenn, her body still tense, held a firm grip on Mike&#39;s hand. He was only 9 years old still, but if her mom wasn&#39;t able to lecture him, she&#39;d do it for her.<br />
<br />
Once home Glenn closed the outside door behind her and called for her mom. There was no reaction, so apparently she wasn&#39;t home. &quot;Mike, I need to relax for a bit and take a shower, go play on your Playstation or something, I&#39;ll tell mom I let you use it, as soon as she comes home.&quot; Mike didn&#39;t let her say that twice, as he took off his shoes - at least he&#39;d learned that discipline before entering the house - and ran of to the living room, to where the TV was. Glenn also took off her shoes, but went upstairs, to where her room was.<br />
<br />
Glenn sat down on her chair, her legs in contact with the leather, as she was wearing short pants. She&#39;d brought the gun with her, having stored it in her handbag, not exactly knowing what to do with it. The gun didn&#39;t look dangerous at all, in fact, as she got shot, it only hurt for a little bit and not too much, and the pain subsided shortly after. She didn&#39;t exactly know what had happened, as her back was turned to her little brother. Glenn thought she was looking at some sort of toy gun that shot out those small yellow marbles or something, it hurt, obviously, but any boy at her little brother&#39;s school probably had one. It wasn&#39;t as big of a deal, so she stored it into a drawer, maybe to give it back to him later, as a present or something.<br />
<br />
Glenn rubbed a painful spot at her neck. All her muscles had been tensed slightly ever since she&#39;d been talking with the girls. It was only now that she truly felt it nagging her. She re-positioned herself on her chair and closed her eyes for a bit, just so that she could relax. For a few minutes, she left it like this, feeling her whole body tingle pleasantly. Everything beneath her hips and butt felt warm and funny, as it gave her a feeling of sinking through her chair, giving the sensation of falling...<br />
<br />
The sound of Glenn&#39;s chair falling with her went through her room, while she landed on the floor with the back of her head. Quickly bringing a hand to her skull, she rubbed the sore spot, feeling all dizzy. She tried to stand up. <br />
<br />
A strange sensation overcame her, as it weren&#39;t two, but four limbs trying to get her up from the floor. Glenn looked in front of her, keeping herself up with her right elbow, as she saw what had caused it. Like a spider, the four legs of her chairs were searching the ground underneath them. The creepy thing was that they were moving... on her command!<br />
<br />
Glenn&#39;s mind got flooded with questions, all of them left unanswered. What happened? Why is the chair moving? Why does she feel it? Taking an even closer look, she saw something else. Both her legs, from where her pants ended, had just disappeared. It seemed like they&#39;d somehow magically merged with her chair, making her feel the four additional limbs on her. She grit her teeth and repressed a scream as she touched the wooden piece of furniture below her hips. It was as hard as wood was supposed to be, but she felt it as her own skin. Like they were her legs. The material was completely different, and somehow she&#39;d merged with it! Something happened that even made the laws of physics seem like nothing.<br />
<br />
Standing up Glenn was surprised at how flexible the chair&#39;s legs were in their movement. They were bending further than any oak wood could go, and didn&#39;t even show the slightest resistance, nor did they break. When &#39;standing up&#39; she noticed she was a lot shorter than before. Also she notice that her back had gone stiff, or at least felt that way. Looking behind her, she noticed how her backrest hand also merged with her own back. Trying to let go, this piece of wood didn&#39;t come with her. Instead, the skin merged with it, tried to detach, from it, making it look like gum when stretched out.<br />
<br />
Then it hit her. Glenn&#39;s body had just merged completely with her chair. It happened as soon as she relaxed for a bit, and now also slowly felt the slight tension she previously had strike up with that thought. Her body had turned into a state that made her think of gum, meanwhile being able to suck the object it had touched before, as long as it was with her bare skin. Then she looked at her pants, and her top. Her pants seemed to also have merged with her skin. Feeling the cotton fabric, Glenn found it similar to touching her own skin. It was almost the same way, weren&#39;t it the case that the material had altered it. With her top it was different. She could easily bring it away from her skin and it didn&#39;t feel as her own either.<br />
<br />
With that Glenn quickly got bored with it, and took it off. As soon as she did however, her nipples acted up, feeling the slight breeze coming from her window, going into her room. Why though? Wasn&#39;t she wearing a bra... oh that&#39;s right. Looking down, she saw how the strips of her bra that held it in place were merged into her shoulders and back, while the clip she could detach her bra with seemed to have become another vertebrae in her spinal cord. Her bra was as smooth and flat as it ever was covering her chest. In some occasions her nipples would poke out of them, but this time it was very different.<br />
<br />
Her tits didn&#39;t just poke out, they literally there. Her bra had changed shape, and now her in the middle of her bra, in the colour of her bra, two new nipples had taken shape. Touching it, they functioned the same, twisting them, they hurt the same, but also gave her the same pleasure. Glenn&#39;s top would now have to function as her bra. Thinking about pleasure, Glenn had lost track of her pussy...<br />
<br />
Looking through the hallway, the bathroom being across it, Glenn didn&#39;t see her little brother anywhere. the sound of cars racing came from downstairs. Mike was probably still playing on his Playstation. Glenn in the meanwhile, tried to walk to the bathroom. It was an alien sensation with four legs instead of two, neither of them having any toes whatsoever. Glenn quickly got the hang of walking like this, the wood tapping on the floor louder then it should, while she opened her bathroom door.<br />
<br />
The mirror stood higher than usual, Glenn noticed. But instead it was her, whose height had just been altered. Looking at her self from a different angle, it was as if she was casually sitting down, but with her legs missing and her nipples acting up. All four of her legs were now in a vertical stance as how they were supposed to be, but Glenn bent her hind legs and looked at what was underneath.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d already expected it. Glenn&#39;s vagina was there. It was right underneath her normal body, merged with the chair&#39;s underside. It made sense like this, or at least in how much sense it could make, scientifically speaking. Her asshole was behind her, apparently not attached to her chair. Instead she could see a small notch inside her short blue pants, which probably resembled her asshole being merged with it.<br />
<br />
It was all a strange experience, but Glenn really wanted her body back again. She concentrated, her body was tensed, so she tried relaxing again. With that...</p>
