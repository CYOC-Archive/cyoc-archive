<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob, Christopher, Johnathan and Zachary had all chosen to hide themselves between the seats as the chaos ensued. Jacob and Johnathan, being smarter of the four, quickly guessed that heading for the door would be a bad idea. Furthermore, based off the reactions other students had to going near the fags, it was clear that students were probably being turned by some satanic infection. As such, the four boys used their shirts to cover their noses and mouths and, as a result, forestalled the infection from getting to them.<br />
<br />
They might&#39;ve been about to get out of this horrid ordeal unscathed, except for maybe a few less body hair, had they not chosen the worst seats in the auditorium. Originally thinking the assembly would be about accepting Satan in the form of homosexuality, the group sat in the back in order to have a quick and easy escape, just in case. As a result, they happened to sit merely a few seats away from Sean, who was casually enjoying the scene unfold, unbeknownst to the chastity club. Sean, however, noticed them and decided to have some fun with them. His creative juices flowing, he started typing a series of naughty commands into the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Luke had just finished turning Kevin and Dillon, the two top contenders for student council president who had hated each other for years, into Kevy and Dill, the flamboyant besties who both shared the position of student council bottoms, the most highly respected student position in the school. He was about join in on their fun with a double ended dildo when suddenly his dick got even harder than before and he got the urge to head to the back of the room.<br />
<br />
Getting there, he noticed the four boys hiding underneath the seats and recognized them from his old chastity club. Gawd, what a waste of time, he thought to himself. Why be a virgin when sluttiness is so much fun? He realized based on their fearful, frantic expressions that they hadn&#39;t been exposed to the joys of twinkification yet. That needed to change. He confidentially sashayed up to them.<br />
<br />
Zachary was the first to see their former friend turned Satanist approach. Panicking, he got up and ran, despite promising to stick with his friends until the end. Noticing he&#39;d broken formation, Jacob and Johnathan followed suit. By the time Christopher had realized the situation, it was already too late.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeey Krissy,&quot; Luke sing-songed. Christopher looked like he was looking the devil in the face. A combination of fear and determination prevented him from doing anything too drastic while still slowly backing away in order to get ready to run.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luke, why? You were a good person, why did accept Satan?&quot; Christopher asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cause honey, if this is what Satan feels like, I could totes deal with hell for an eternity,&quot; Luke explained. &quot;You&#39;ll understand soon babe.&quot; With that, he tackled Christopher, straddling him and kissing him all over. The onslaught of the infection quickly had its effect on Christopher, who fell back into a chair. Luke, responding to this, started giving the straight, religious boy the lap dance of his life. Christopher, however, thanks to Sean&#39;s programming, wasn&#39;t changing physically. He&#39;d only change mentally until the chastity group at the school was completed twinkified.<br />
<br />
This meant that the struggle between his morals and his feelings was ten times more difficult. He knew he was straight, he&#39;d gotten hard thinking about too many girls to say otherwise, right? Not that he&#39;d act on those feelings; it was a sin. But kissing them wasn&#39;t an issue, right? Only fucking them was, so that&#39;s why he kept to getting blowjobs from them. That and anal. As long as it wasn&#39;t vaginal sex and it wasn&#39;t with a guy, it was safe from sin. He was just taking care of his urges. That&#39;s why he masturbated so often. Sure, it was also considered a sin, but it was better than sex so it was fine as long as he only thought about straight porn. Even if the occasional guy getting fucked popped into his head, that was fine, right? It wasn&#39;t like he was constantly thinking of them; he was bisexual after all, even if he was deathly afraid to tell anyone. Guys were just so hot to him, especially twinks. This infection was a dream come true for him. Maybe it would mean Zachary would finally stop being so uptight and experiment a little. Secretly, he found all the four boys hot since he reached puberty. Though he didn&#39;t show it, he realized pretty quickly that he had to be gay. He just couldn&#39;t get it up when thinking about women. He joined the chastity club at his church to stay closer to the boys and hopefully get one of them to loosen up a bit. Just a kiss would&#39;ve been fine, he had plenty of guys he fucked in school for the time being. Memories and fucking and getting fucked (though mostly the latter) surfaced in his mind as he started developing a flamboyant accent and demeanor. Christopher stopped caring anymore about being saintly as Kris, the twink without the body settled in. Sean wanted to keep the boys&#39; bodies for a bit on purpose. It got him hard thinking about them converting each other without them even knowing. Kris, now knowing he had to infect his friends, smiled and grew hard as he watched Luke grind on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks babe, I totally understand now. Gawd, being a slutty twink is, like, the totally best feeling in the world!&quot; he said with a smack on Luke&#39;s ass as he did his best to mask his slight lisp and effeminate tone. He was especially glad Luke was around to help him out. Those boring chastity group meetings were only bearable because of their incredible fuck sessions afterwards. Luke got off of his Kris as they both stood, looking into each other&#39;s eyes and understanding their goals. With a kiss on each cheek up top and squeeze of the cheeks down below, they took off in opposite directions to convert their remaining friends.</p>
