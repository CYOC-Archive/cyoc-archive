<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Funzo; formally known as Brian; returned to his hotel room.  It had been a little over a <br />
month since his transformation had concluded itself.  At first he was relieved that no new <br />
changes had happened to him, but quickly despaired when he showed no signs of <br />
returning to normal.  As the days went by Funzo had stayed inside moping about his <br />
situation.  Bridget stopped being a source of comfort to him as she started to openly mock <br />
him more and more about his transformation into a clown.  Sometimes Funzo thought she <br />
did it to truly be cruel.  He dismissed these thoughts, because the idea of the only person <br />
who he could now rely upon, during this ordeal, actually hated him would just drive him <br />
into a truly dark depression.<br />
<br />
Bridget had pointed out that if his parents came home and found a clown in their house <br />
they would flip out and demand answers.  Funzo realized he wasn’t ready to answer those <br />
questions, but wasn’t sure what to do.  It was Bridget who suggested he rent himself out <br />
to birthday parties and bar-mitzvahs or any event that need a clown.  It took a lot of <br />
prodding but Funzo finally agreed.  He started slowly with one event a day, but quickly <br />
moved onto more.  His nerves caused him to take each event seriously, and his curse <br />
would cause him to act clownier as a result.<br />
<br />
Funzo encountered problems early in when he realized that he couldn’t cash checks or <br />
start a bank account without proper ID, and people didn’t normally issue proper ID to <br />
clowns.  Funzo talked to Bridget and soon she was having all checks put in her name and <br />
started an account for him.  More problems arose when Bridget started giving Funzo only <br />
a small stipend to live on, since she was the only one with access to the money.  It was <br />
just enough to pay for a hotel room, some food, and transportation to and from his clown <br />
gigs each week.  He couldn’t even afford a nice hotel room, and was forced into a small <br />
cheap one.  Bridget had told him she was saving the money for him and to trust her, but <br />
she seemed to delight in making him miserable.  He knew he hurt her when he slept with <br />
her sister, but she would look past that to help him now that he desperately needed her, <br />
right?<br />
<br />
There was a knock at Funzo’s hotel door bringing him back to attention.  “Who is it, <br />
Hyuck?”<br />
<br />
“Who do you think it is Fattie Boom-Boom?” came Bridget’s voice.<br />
<br />
“Hold on,” Funzo replied as he cart wheeled over to the door, and opened it.  “Why do you <br />
have to make fun?”  Funzo asked as Bridget walked through the door, in what appeared to <br />
be a new and expensive outfit.<br />
<br />
“Because you are a clown,” she smiled to him behind brand new Dolce &amp; Gabbana <br />
sunglasses.  She poked his fat stomach for emphais making him fart.  “I’ve got two events <br />
for you tomorrow Funzo, a birthday and a car lot opening.  The opening is at night so be <br />
prepared to bring the butt fireworks, they said they’ll pay more if you light up that sky <br />
Funzo.”  She waved her hands for emphasis.<br />
<br />
“Why do you call me that,” Funzo said as he farted from his chronic flatulence, “You know I <br />
,der, hate that name.”<br />
<br />
“Hey a big fat clown needs a big fat clown name.  And your new name is FUNZO T. <br />
CLOWN.”  <br />
<br />
He sat down on his bed with his usual whoopee cushion sound effects.  He looked up at <br />
Bridget and began to cry.  It was a scene Bridget had seen quite a bit in the last month.<br />
<br />
“Listen Smelly Pants, you have to move on.  You are, like, the ultimate clown now.  And we <br />
need to use that to make some money so you can live.  Otherwise you’re going to have to <br />
go home and explain to your parents why they need to send you to clown college.”<br />
<br />
“I know, I know.  You’re right.  Like always.  I just want this whole thing to make sense.”<br />
<br />
“Well it doesn’t, but at least you get to make others happy.  That’s something.”<br />
<br />
“I guess so.”  <br />
<br />
“Now, get some sleep.  You have a busy day tomorrow.  I’ll leave the addresses and times <br />
on top of the hotel TV.  I’ll come by tomorrow to get the checks.”<br />
<br />
“Where you going,” he asked very vulnerable.<br />
<br />
“I have a date.”<br />
<br />
“A date,” he repeated his heart breaking.<br />
<br />
“Yeah a date.  Oh Funzo, you really didn’t think I could date a clown did you.  Oh you poor <br />
thing,” she said as she closed the door behind her beginning to laugh at the very idea.<br />
<br />
Funzo felt all-alone in the world.  He sat in his room for a long time thinking about his <br />
past life.  He missed his parents.  His hotel was only a few blocks from his old house since <br />
he had to walk there initially when he left home.  Funzo eventually worked up the courage <br />
to go back home to see if he could spy on his parents.  He had to see them again.  <br />
<br />
As he walked to their house random strangers stopped him, and the clown in him felt <br />
compelled to do tricks for them when he was asked.  Finally he farted out his unicycle to <br />
make better time.  He had to see his parents before they went to bed, and it was getting <br />
late.<br />
<br />
When he arrived at his parent’s house he put his unicycle back in his butt by jumping up <br />
on it landing on it forcing it into his butt, like he had become so accustomed to doing.  He <br />
then tried to sneak over to a window, but the squeaking he made as he walked made it vey <br />
difficult.  His parents were up in the living room, and he watched through the window from <br />
the bushes.  He became so focused on them that he forgot about his chronic flatulence.  <br />
His mother heard him rip an unbelievably loud fart.  A fart so loud it brought Funzo back <br />
to reality, alerted his mother to his presence causing her to scream in fright, and his father <br />
to run out the door after the peeping clown.<br />
<br />
Funzo’s father gave chase after him, cursing him to get back there and take his beating <br />
like a man.  His mother was in the doorway still yelling in fright.  Funzo ran as fast as he <br />
could down the cul-de-sac squeaking loudly as he did so.  It was no use though.  His <br />
giant sizes 28 feet were slowing him down no matter how hard he pumped his legs, and <br />
his father was quickly catching up.  Finally Funzo had no choice and farted out his unicycle <br />
and began to pedal away.  He quickly outdistanced his father and went back to his hotel <br />
room, feeling more alone then ever.</p>
