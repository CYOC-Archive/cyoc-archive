<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff felt a twinge of excitement and nervousness as the mouse hovered over the &quot;confirm&quot; button. If he clicked it, he would transform into a hairy high school wrestling star. He took a deep breath and clicked the button. <br />
<br />
<br />
All of a sudden it was dark and hot and humid, he could feel an incredible tight and slippery sensation around his cock. It felt wonderful! He heard deep moans and grunts. Wait, they were coming from him?! <br />
<br />
<br />
He noticed he was thrusting his hips, almost involuntarily. His cock felt amazing! What was happening? Where was he? His eyes slowly adjusted and he looked down. In the dim light he saw he was balls deep in someone underneath him! He was fucking them. He kept thrusting and grunted at the sensation. Even if he was shocked and in total confusion, he couldn&#39;t stop! It felt too good and he could almost feel a huge load of cum boiling in his balls, begging to come out. Looking down he saw his chest and torso were absolutely covered in curly thick brown hairs. He had pecs and abs now! The hair covered his large veiny forearms and led up to beefy biceps. From what he could see, he was huge! It was still too dark to see much else, and he was distracted by the feeling in his cock.<br />
<br />
<br />
That was when he felt a massive pressure pull up form his balls. He was going to cum very shortly! Something warm was hugging his cock, squeezing it and he thrusted backwards and forwards, and it felt so good! Everything was dark and the lights were off though, who or what was he fucking! &quot;Uuuggghhh Fuck!&quot; Jeff screamed in a very deep bellow as he felt a huge load rocket out of his cock!<br />
<br />
<br />
He grunted as he shot rope after thick rope into whatever he was inside of right now. It was the most intense orgasm Jeff had ever felt! It kept going, too! After 8 or 9 heavy ropes, it began to subside and Jeff collapsed from the exertion, sweaty and exhausted. He pulled his dick out of whatever warm hole he was in, feeling it slide out, Jeff realized his cock was absolutely massive now!<br />
<br />
<br />
He heard a manly grunt as he slid his fat cock out with a wet SCHLORP sound. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, Jeff, good as always&quot;, came a deep voice from under him in the shadows. He heard shuffling and then a light clicked on. Jeff gasped. He was butt naked, on his knees on a bed. He could finally see his massive new hairy body and his massive cock, still quite hard and slick with juices. That wasn&#39;t what shocked him the most. The biggest shock was who had been in bed with him! Shane, the quarterback, was sitting on the bed facedown, slightly turned to look at Jeff. His hairy ass was right in the air and a huge load of cum was leaking out of it. &quot;Jeff, that was great man, but can you get the towel before we make anymore of a mess?&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Shane was the quarterback at the highschool! He was a senior, blonde, and super hot. Veiny lean muscles all over his tanned body, not to mention bushes of blonde hair all over. He was gay?!?! This didn&#39;t make sense! Shane was a lady&#39;s man, he could fuck any girl he wanted to?! He stated at the cum filled hairy ass of the big jock he had just fucked, and he felt his cock stir again. And he was now gay too? <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Sure&quot;, Jeff said, really hearing for the first time how much deeper and powerful his voice sounded. He reached up and felt a large lump protruding from his neck; he had an Adams apple! He could feel thick scratchy stubble all along his neck and, a quick swipe on his cheeks confirmed he had a very scruffy face all over now. He grabbed the towel on the night stand and Shane began to clean up.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, Jeff, I know your a big guy, but how do you make loads so big! This is a mess!&quot;, Shane said jokingly. Jeff was speechless still and didn&#39;t know what to say. He was still busy taking it all in. He looked down at his body. His chest had more hair than adults have now, and it trailed all the way down his torso, to a massive messy bush around his fat cock. His balls too, were covered in thick musky hair. <br />
<br />
<br />
As Shane cleaned himself up, Jeff was looking at his body with disbelief. What in the fuck had the chronivac done?!</p>
