<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sensation of completion washed over Mathew as he stood in the moonlit field, towering above the scattered skeletons, his new form casting a long, menacing shadow across the ground. He flexed, feeling the weight and power of his new body, savoring the way his colossal muscles shifted under the thick, glistening surface of goo that encased him. He was no longer bound by the frailties of his human form; he was a towering, seven-foot-three mass of pure, irresistible strength. And it felt… perfect.<br />
<br />
Every pulse, every ripple of goo across his body filled him with an all-encompassing pleasure that bordered on ecstasy. The warm, undulating energy within him seemed to caress every inch of his being, urging him to spread the sensation, to share the deep, primal joy of transformation. And as he looked out toward the distant lights of his town, his thoughts settled on one person: Daniel, his roommate, his friend. The one person who had always understood him, the one who might even understand *this*. <br />
<br />
A slow smile spread across his face, and without another moment’s hesitation, he turned and made his way back toward their apartment, each step leaving a faint purple residue on the earth that seemed to shimmer in the moonlight. The goo that coated his body was still warm, almost alive, like a lover’s embrace, coaxing him forward, whispering promises of more—more power, more transformation, more unity.<br />
<br />
By the time he reached the door to their shared place, the goo had settled into an eager hum, as if sensing the presence of another who could join in its seductive embrace. Mathew&#39;s massive, goo-coated hand wrapped around the doorknob, the surface melting and reforming as he gripped it, twisting it open.<br />
<br />
Inside, Daniel was sitting on the couch, headphones in, completely unaware of the monstrous figure stepping through the door. Mathew paused for a moment, taking in the sight of his friend, feeling a flicker of affection — and anticipation. He imagined Daniel as a goo golem like him, imagined the look of wonder, maybe even gratitude, as he experienced the same rapturous transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel,&quot; Mathew’s voice rumbled, low and resonant, vibrating through the walls.<br />
<br />
Daniel looked up, his eyes widening in shock as he took in the massive, monstrous figure standing in the doorway. But before he could say a word, Mathew stepped forward, the goo that coated him rippling with an eager pulse, reaching out almost of its own accord, tendrils extending toward his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mathew…? Wh-what happened to you?&quot; Daniel stammered, backing up slightly, but he couldn’t look away. The sight of Mathew — the sheer, undeniable power and presence of him — was mesmerizing, even as a part of Daniel’s mind screamed that he should be terrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s amazing, Daniel,&quot; Mathew murmured, his voice a deep, comforting rumble. &quot;It&#39;s everything I ever wanted. And I want you to feel it, too. I want you to become like me. Trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel’s gaze flickered, uncertain, but Mathew could see a hint of curiosity, of intrigue in his friend’s eyes. That was all he needed. Reaching out, he placed his massive, goo-covered hand on Daniel’s shoulder, letting the thick, pulsing substance slide gently onto him, slowly, sensually spreading across his friend’s skin.<br />
<br />
Daniel shuddered, a soft gasp escaping his lips as the warmth of the goo seeped into him. It was like nothing he’d ever felt before — a deep, all-consuming pleasure that started at the point of contact and spread outward, igniting every nerve, filling him with a warmth that was both alien and inviting.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s… it&#39;s incredible…&quot; Daniel whispered, his voice laced with a mixture of awe and surrender as he watched the purple substance spread down his arm, coating his fingers, merging with his skin until his entire arm was encased in the same smooth, muscular texture. His gaze turned back to Mathew, his eyes bright with a growing understanding — and desire.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just let it happen,&quot; Mathew encouraged, his voice soft and reassuring. He stepped closer, letting more of the goo envelop Daniel, easing the transition, guiding his friend through it. The goo seemed to respond, surging forward with a joyful eagerness, spreading across Daniel&#39;s torso, down his legs, each pulse filling him with a sense of power, of invincibility.<br />
<br />
As Daniel&#39;s body began to expand, muscles growing and hardening beneath the goo, he let out a soft moan, the sensation almost overwhelming in its pleasure. His skin tingled as the goo seeped deeper, reshaping him, making him taller, broader, his muscles thickening as his body transformed to match Mathew&#39;s, every inch a perfect replica of the goo golem’s towering, powerful frame.<br />
<br />
The two stood together, a pair of towering, muscular figures, their bodies encased in the same thick, shimmering goo, each pulse connecting them, each movement resonating between them as though they were part of a single, greater whole. Mathew watched his friend with satisfaction, a deep joy blossoming in his chest as he saw the look of rapture on Daniel’s face, the same look he’d felt when the goo had first transformed him.<br />
<br />
Daniel looked down at his new form, flexing his massive arms, his face lighting up with exhilaration. &quot;I… I feel unstoppable,&quot; he said, his voice a deep, resonant echo of Mathew’s. The goo pulsed in agreement, both of them connected now, sharing in the same strength, the same intoxicating power.<br />
<br />
Mathew grinned, placing a hand on his friend&#39;s shoulder. &quot;We *are* unstoppable. And why stop here, Daniel? Why shouldn&#39;t everyone experience this? Imagine it — a world of goo golems, free from weakness, from pain. Just… this.&quot; He gestured to their bodies, the shining, perfect musculature encased in smooth, pulsing goo.<br />
<br />
Daniel’s eyes glinted with understanding, and he nodded. &quot;Yes. Yes, let&#39;s share it. Let&#39;s show them what they can become.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before they turned to leave, Mathew and Daniel paused, drawn to each other, captivated by the raw, primal power coursing through their bodies. They reached out, hands exploring each other’s transformed forms, tracing the thick cords of muscle beneath the warm, pulsing goo. Their fingers lingered over each ridge, each hardened curve, marveling at the sheer strength they could feel under their touch. Each flex, each shift of their powerful bodies sent waves of pleasure through them, a shared euphoria in their connection. They were both magnificent, towering and invincible, bonded by this beautiful affliction, and they couldn’t help but revel in the sensation of their strength, as if rediscovering what it meant to *be* in this new, perfect form.<br />
<br />
The two then turned toward the door, their massive forms moving in perfect synchrony, their bodies humming with the same pulsating energy, eager to spread their gift, to share the deep, sensual joy of transformation with the world. They were unstoppable, united, and they would bring their beautiful affliction to everyone.</p>
