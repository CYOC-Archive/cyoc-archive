<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bob Morrison strode into his house, he smiling, happy about something, as his wife looked at him and said, &quot;What now?&quot;<br />
<br />
As Bob sat to the head end of the kitchen table, he continued his Cheshire Catty grin, as if he had some good news. &quot;Well first, I have a man coming here with his daughter, and her Appaloosa mare to meet with Jasper. That is some good money from Jasper breeding that mare. I see that Danny has bred his four mares, and their owner will pay us a $100 each. Carl came here looking for his big chance at knowing animal style sex, and wished he were a bull. I received an inquiry from the Benson farm owner asking about if Satan, my Devon breed bull was available for breeding a full herd of two hundred cows. Carl will earn us $25 per cow bred, and that totals $5,000 bucks!<br />
<br />
Carl was there and overheard my conversation, and became aroused at the possibility of him becoming as Satan; his parents being away for six weeks and he as alone at home. I made good use of the Medallion and found the black leather dressy head halter I used to adorn Satan for his yearling bull photos for the breeders registry.<br />
<br />
I must say that Carl did not fight his changing self and in an overnight he awoke come the morning being exactly as was Satan when he was on his first birthday!&quot; Mr. Morrison said, as his wife continued her dishing out the meal for her husband and her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are in the money, thanks to the dooming of three teenage boys turned into animals!&quot; Mrs. Morrison said, as what she said wiped the smile off the face of her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;They do not need to remain permanently as they are now. I am not a Frankenstein, Jared is Jasper on every Friday and Saturday, or when his servicing is required by a customer for breeding a mare. Danny, or Eric has had his fun with four pony mares, and from that experience he will want to tell Carl  and Jared. Carl will have his sexual fun fantasy experiences for the next four weeks. So that is all!&quot; Bob said to the Misses.<br />
<br />
As Misses sat by the table she offered to say Grace. She opened her eyes before saying an amen, only to see her husband as already having partaken of the food served on his plate.<br />
<br />
&quot;That Medallion would have you throw your religious convictions to the wind. Do you have it on you now, if so, give to me for a safer keeping, or when you need it to retrieve my son from living a beastly life.&quot; The Misses said, and with a slow sign of reluctance her husband gave the silver Medallion to his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not one of those dumb bimbos you joke with at Don&#39;s Bar and Grill. You think I am dumb, but your son keeps me informed. As you said, Carl asked to become a Bull animal, and he talked you into having him earn you a cool $5,000 bucks. You told of his parents being away and he being alone and luckily for your purposes, as available. You planned to leave him stay a bull for four weeks, or 28 days. As according to what Jared told me, if he were to remain as Jasper for more than fourteen consecutive days, the spellbinding of the Medallion would decide he need stay permanently as a horse.<br />
<br />
So what Frankenstein sort of scheme are you thinking of when coaxing Carl to stay as a herd-sire Bull for four weeks, or 14 days past the brink of no-return?&quot; The Misses asked, and her asking saw her husband get red faced and angry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so what, your foolish son blabbed to his two friends that he spent his weekends being a stallion horse. He then dragged them to our farm and in front of those two boys, he asked of me to show as use the Medallion, as change him into being as Jasper. He made me look like a jackass, and that got me thinking.&quot; Mr. Morrison said, as his wife sat there and glared a stare at her husband of twenty years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that was a reason for your debauchery with our son and his friends. You felt like a Jackass, that should fit you well enough, you having drawn and painted those porn characters, those donkey-boys with big cocks, and selling the artistry through the Internet. Did you feel pride when needing to wash a stallion cock after a breeding session?<br />
<br />
You talk about youthful teenage fantasies, as your fun fantasy was with reading late at night the wild adventures of people visiting Pleasure Island and either becoming donkeys, or entering orgies with satyrs and female sex creatures. I love you and therefore I need to overlook your shortcomings. Indeed I do, as if I let your vanity and ego run wild, you would ask to have me make a wish for me to become one of those sexy half goat playmates, of what helps you to masturbate, squirting your semen onto the computer monitor.<br />
<br />
No sir, as from where I sit you did your last transforming of anyone with the weekly exception of our son Jared!&quot;  The Misses said, and as Bob sat there eating he watched his wife, seeing she began acting oddly similar to how Jared acted when he first discovered he liked becoming as Jasper the Appaloosa stallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is the air conditioning turned on, it feels very warm in the house.&quot; The Misses asked, and feeling her body as sweating she took her handkerchief out an apron pocket and patted her chest as dry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Personally, I think you best go upstairs to the bathroom and take one of your Valium tablets, you are sweating and all upset!&#39; Bob told his wife, as when she would see her reflection in the bathroom mirror, her insisting fool wish made with the Medallion in her pocket should get her complete attention.  As then his Misses excused herself and got up slowly, as if feeling stiff-like, she turned and walked from the kitchen, walking on tiptoes, her heels held high, as changes began.</p>
