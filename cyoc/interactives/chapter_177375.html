<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was likely passed midnight by the time their little raiding party arrived back at Mito and Teto’s cottage. The dying embers of the fire smoldered in the dark hearth, and the main room of the house was empty but for a solitary lit candle on the table. Mito limped over to an open chair and sat down, rubbing his knee while Cal went around the room lighting more candles. Otis led Marsyas through the door, supporting the faun’s weight as he helped him hobble over to a chair. The faun sagged in his seat, his shoulders slumping and his hand clutching his aching head. Alex brought him a glass of water and put a hand on his shoulder, noticing he’d lost his pauldrons.<br />
<br />
“How you feeling, buddy?” he said as Marsyas took the cup from his hand.<br />
<br />
“Those orcs really know how to throw a punch,” the faun replied, wincing, “But nothing’s broken.” Otis came over with a bowl of water, some rags, an a clay jar full of some gross looking green paste. <br />
<br />
“Here, let me,” the minotaur rumbled as he began to tend to Marsyas’ wounds. <br />
<br />
“We’re glad your alive and mostly unscathed,” Mito said.<br />
<br />
“Yes, thank you.” Marsyas said, looking up from Otis and at each of them in turn. “They had me by the balls back there.” <br />
<br />
“What were they going to do with you?” inquired Cal, sitting down on the bench beside Alex. <br />
<br />
Marsyas yelped and swatted Otis’s hand when he touched some of the green paste to one of his wounds. “Ow! That stings!” he snapped. “I was unconscious for a while, but I think they were taking me back to wherever their chief is. I don’t know why…” he trailed off.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry for leaving you,” Alex said, bowing his head.<br />
<br />
Marsyas shook his head. “I told you to run; one of us had to get away, or both of us wouldn’t have stood a chance. Forget about it.” He said, giving Alex his characteristic cheerful grin. <br />
<br />
Mito stood up from his chair and turned for the stairs. “I’m turning in,” he announced. “Good work tonight, Men. We’ll break our fast in the morning.” And he turned and strode up the stairs. <br />
<br />
“Why don’t you come with me to my home tonight, little one?” purred Otis, finishing Marsyas’ last bandage. “I can give you more personal medical attention.” He said suggestively, somehow wagging his unibrow. <br />
<br />
“Only if you carry me there, stud.” Marsyas said with a cheeky grin. Alex laughed; it was funny to see him acting so coy around the bigger, stronger beastman. Otis chuckled and effortlessly lifted Marsyas out of the chair and clomping towards the door. “Good night, you too. Enjoy yourselves.” He said with a lecherous grin, striding out the door.<br />
<br />
“I know we will!” shouted Marsyas before his head disappeared out the door.<br />
<br />
“I’ve never seen him act like that,” he said, a minute after they left. <br />
<br />
Cal chuckled but made no comment. Instead, he took Alex’s hand and stood up. “Come with me, lets talk.” He said quietly. Alex stood up after him and together they extinguished the candles in the room before Cal pulled him out the door and into the cool night. The man led him around the cottage and over to the barn. It was mostly empty except for some old junk; no animals to speak of. Alex followed him over to a ladder, and one after the other, they climbed up into the loft of the barn. Alex was lost in the darkness, but Cal seemed to have excellent night vision and quickly found a candle and a taper. In the light, Alex saw the room had been layered in pelts and furs, blankets and pillows, much like Roc and Raf’s den; he wondered if that was a Were thing. He and Cal crept upon the softest part of the bedding, the two men sitting side-by-side and staring at the candle.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad your friend is okay.” Cal finally said after a quiet minute.<br />
<br />
“Me too. I couldn’t have done it without you and your friends,” Alex said, taking Cal’s hand. “Ten years is a long time.” He commented. <br />
<br />
The big man sighed and wiped his bearded face with his hand. “You have no idea.” He sighed, laying back against the furs. Alex lay there with him, and Cal looked down at himself as if inviting Alex to scoot closer; he did, snuggling himself up against Cal’s beefy chest and resting his head on his muscled shoulder. Cal’s big arm swung around and held Alex tight and close. <br />
<br />
“Damn, you’re so warm,” Alex said, laying his other arm on the man’s pectorals and rubbing his hand across his chest air.<br />
<br />
Cal chuckled before pulling Alex on top of him and bringing him in for a strong kiss. Alex melted on top of the man, placing his hands on either side of his huge friend and holding on tight as their lips parted and their tongues intertwined. Alex’s cock swelled and hardened between his stomach and Cal’s as the big man’s hands found their place on both of Alex’s asscheeks, squeezing and groping them possessively. He growled and rolled them over, his massive frame looming over Alex and resting his weight slightly on the smaller man’s body. He resumed kissing the smaller man, while with a free hand he adjusted his massive cock so that it was laying on Alex’s stomach next to his own. Alex moaned and sighed as Cal moved his assault back to the crook of his neck, under his chin, behind his ears. He made Alex flip onto his stomach and began to lick and bite at the back of his neck, all the while grinding his still-growing cock against Alex’s ass. Alex gripped the furs tightly and lifted his pelvis, forcing his rear against the man as if inviting him. <br />
<br />
He found himself flipped onto his back, Cal parting his thighs and lifting them up so he could reach behind Alex’s heaving balls and down to his asshole. <br />
<br />
“I want to see your face,” he explained in a breath before he stuck one large, rough finger inside of him, grinning devilishly from behind his beard when Alex groaned and stretched against the furs. With his other hand he began to gently knead and massage Alex’s balls as he fingered him with two strong fingers. Alex gasped and writhed as the big man teased his nipples, still powerfully stroking into him with his large fingers. Cal brought himself back down upon Alex, still his fingers still probing inside of him as the big man kissed him passionately, forcefully. Alex surrendered to the man, losing himself in the sensation of his soft full lips and his powerful fingers stroking him to pleasure. <br />
<br />
Alex gasped when the fingers were removed, only to be replaced by the probing of something much larger and harder. Calvin hefted his cock in his hand while still bent over Alex, teasing the young man by rubbing the head around his entrance before finally slipping it in. Alex reared up slightly, loosing his breath as the big angry head forced its way into him. Cal held himself there for a moment, rubbing his hand along Alex’s body as he adjusted to Cal’s size; he had no body-warping magic to help him this time. He groaned as Cal pushed himself in deeper, his girth stretching Alex and making his eyes water. His own cock throbbed and leaked against his stomach; Cal took it in his big hand, his long fingers circling around it as he began to gently stroke Alex up and down. He continued to gently work himself in until finally, Alex could feel the man’s heavy balls brush up against his ass. Cal stroked his cock in and out of Alex experimentally a few times before taking a firm grip of his thighs and taking deep, slow strokes within him. Alex licked and nibbled along Cal’s neck, running his hands through the man’s furry chest as he began driving his cock into him harder and faster. <br />
<br />
Soon Alex’s ass had surrendered to the enormous cock plowing through him and Alex could only feel pleasure. His fingers gently teased and pressed Cal’s large nipples, his breath ragged; Cal’s big head was beside his own, his eyes closed and his face contorted in that look men get when they’re fucking with focus. His eyes snapped open and he snuck in a quick kiss before he paused his fucking, sliding his hands under Alex’s ass and lifting him slightly. <br />
<br />
“Now on your hands and knees, boy.” He commanded, but gently. Alex did as he was told and carefully maneuvered himself onto all fours, keeping Cal’s cock firmly embedded in his ass. Cal adjusted his stance and then resumed his powerful fucking, driving his throbbing cock into Alex as deep as he could. His strokes began to rapidly increase in pace, his balls slapping against Alex’s ass as the smaller man furiously stroked his own aching cock. The big bear threw his weight down against Alex’s back, hooking his arm around Alex’s neck and resting his bearded head on Alex’s shoulder as he slammed his cock into Alex one final time. Alex could feel the giant cock within him throb and spasm as Cal came, wave after wave, deep inside of him. Alex felt his own cock swell and tense as he came against the furs, his orgasm washing over him and leaving him in a haze. They slowly came down upon the bedding, Cal still resting his prodigious weight on top of Alex with his softening cock still lodged within him. They sighed against each other, warm and content, shuddering as the aftershocks coursed through them every few moments. Cal rolled them both on their sides, and together they laid there, not daring to interrupt the peaceful quiet. <br />
<br />
Cal held Alex protectively against his chest while Alex traced his fingers along the hard, hairy arms that encircled him. Cal’s profuse chest hair tickled his back and made him itch, but Alex didn’t care; he felt too good. His questions evaporated from his mind as Cal gently kissed against Alex’s neck, moving his semi-hard cock within him and making Alex moan and sigh with contentment. Their muscles aching, their minds tired, and their cocks spent, the two men fell asleep in each other’s arms, saving their questions and worries for the next day ahead.</p>
