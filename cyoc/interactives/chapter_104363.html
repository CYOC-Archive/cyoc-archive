<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After lunch at the Talbots, the men went back to the garage while the older women cleaned up.<br />
Karen Yuletide lent a hand, despite being told it wasn&#39;t necessary, which did make the chore go much faster.<br />
When all was said and done, Ife asked Karen if she would give her some drawing tips.<br />
The two of them sat back down at the now clean table and started talking about art, but were soon joined by all of Ife&#39;s cousins.<br />
Knowing she wouldn&#39;t get much done, Karen offered to draw everyone&#39;s portraits while Ife continued to sit next to her, working on her own art.<br />
&quot;The one thing I always have the most difficulty with in regards to faces is the nose,&quot; admitted Karen, while she was working on a drawing of Olivia. &quot;It just seems to me that there&#39;s as much detail in that one organ as the rest of the face, but if you get <i>too</i> detailed on that one spot, it tends to pull the viewer away from the overall picture.&quot;<br />
&quot;So what do you do?&quot; asked Ife.<br />
&quot;Depending upon which way the person is facing, you have to simplify it to some extent. Just a line or two for the bridge and shape of the nose. A small circular shape for whichever nostril is visible, maybe just a couple of minute dashes if the subject is looking right at you. For me, it&#39;s as much  trying to get the <i>essence</i> of the person or character you&#39;re drawing, regardless of how much accuracy you go for in the details.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; replied Ife, taking a quick look at Karen&#39;s drawing before going back to her own.<br />
<br />
As Karen finished each cousin&#39;s drawing, she simply signed it &quot;Karen&quot;. She didn&#39;t want to use her full name, because she felt as much a part of this family as her own, especially considering her relationship with Peter. However, she didn&#39;t feel right signing the Talbot name to anything until she and her boyfriend were officially married, so just settled on using only her first name.<br />
When all the other cousins received their pictures, Karen surprised Ife by handing her one of the young lioness. Ife looked and saw it was a good likeness of her, but Karen had used the art style Ife was currently using instead of her own.<br />
&quot;You shouldn&#39;t have,&quot; said Ife, looking between Karen and the drawing of her intently staring at her own drawing pad while working.<br />
&quot;Hey. Us artists have to stick together,&quot; said Karen with a smile. Then she bent her head down a bit so hopefully only Ife would hear as she whispered, &quot;Besides, growing up, I was shy and bashful too. My interests in art and developing my skills kept me company through many an otherwise lonely day.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not just that...&quot; Ife started to say, then grew silent.<br />
&quot;You can tell me. I can keep a secret,&quot; promised Karen.<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a boy I like in school,&quot; confessed Ife.<br />
&quot;And he hasn&#39;t noticed you?&quot; asked Karen.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not that. I think it&#39;s more the fact that I&#39;m a werelioness and he&#39;s a weretiger, despite the fact that neither of us have had our first transformations yet.&quot;<br />
&quot;Lions and tigers don&#39;t mix?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not completely. We&#39;re polite to each other and everything, but...&quot; then Ife&#39;s voice trailed off, not knowing what to say next.<br />
&quot;Hey. I was a teenager myself. It&#39;s not easy,&quot; agreed Karen. &quot;But in time, either he&#39;s going to realize how great you are and finally take an interest in you, or else he&#39;s going to kick himself for not noticing you when you move on to somebody else.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Ife, looking directly at Karen.<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; promised Karen. &quot;Just look at me and your cousin Peter. What attracted me to him was the man, not the lion. Peter&#39;s fursona was just a bonus as far as I&#39;m concerned. Someday, I&#39;m looking forward to this dream coming true,&quot; she said, flipping back through her current sketch book to show Ife the drawing of Karen, Peter, and their two cubs again. &quot;But I love Peter and he loves me. In the end, that&#39;s what truly matters.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thank you, my future sister,&quot; said Ife, before hugging Karen.<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; said Karen, returning the hug. After they physically parted, she asked, &quot;Do you think your mothers would like their portraits done?&quot;<br />
Ife eagerly nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Peter followed his father and the other men back out to the garage. But as his uncles began finishing up the Mustang, Peter asked his father if they could have a moment alone.<br />
&quot;Sure my son,&quot; agreed Leon, stepping over into the far corner they used as a wall-less office.<br />
&quot;First, I wanted to thank you and everyone else for everything you have done between last night and today,&quot; began Peter. &quot;Karen feels quite welcomed and at home among us.&quot;<br />
&quot;As well she should. If the saying is still in use, Karen&#39;s quite a catch,&quot; confirmed Leon.<br />
&quot;Then, when the time is right, I would like to ask Karen to be my wife,&quot; revealed Peter.<br />
&quot;I appreciate you following the old ways and informing me of your decision, but it is her answer that would be most vital to your decision. Have you two discussed such matters as where you would live, how you will support yourselves, and the other matters of life?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not in as great as detail as we should, because it is too soon for specifics at this point,&quot; Peter informed his father. &quot;That she loves me and I her, as well as the fact she wants to be my lioness someday have been the major points of the moment.&quot;<br />
&quot;A promising start,&quot; agreed Leon.<br />
&quot;As you know, Karen wishes to pursue her artistic career. Even though she is only a Freshman, the college has a very good placement program for its graduates and her talent is quite promising.&quot;<br />
&quot;That it is,&quot; agreed Leon.<br />
&quot;I shall be graduating before her, and still intend to become a business manager, with the garage as my primary client.&quot;<br />
&quot;Most of those responsibilities are yours already, so as long as we do not interfere with your other clients or vice versa...&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand. What this is leading to is that I would like to ask Karen for her hand sometime after her friend&#39;s wedding next weekend. There is no doubt of our love for each other, but to properly ask her, I need your help acquiring the appropriate token first,&quot; admitted Peter.<br />
&quot;You know you have the full love and support of this family. If it is within my power, all you have to do is ask,&quot; Leon reminded him.<br />
<br />
When Peter told him what he wanted to give Karen when he asked her to marry him, Leon simply smiled and nodded his head affirmatively.<br />
A few phone calls later, Leon handed Peter a slip of paper with some information on it. &quot;When the time comes, they will need an hour&#39;s notice to finish the final preparations before you can collect it, and you know the other rules concerning what you asked for.&quot;<br />
&quot;I do. I know when the time comes, Karen will say yes, but I feel as weak as a newborn kit when I think about actually asking her that question,&quot; admitted Peter.<br />
&quot;Goes with the territory, my son,&quot; agreed Leon. &quot;It was almost a month between acquiring my token and asking your mother to marry me. Thankfully, all turned out well in the end,&quot; he added, patting his son on the shoulder while giving Peter a smile.<br />
&quot;Depending upon the moment, I will be asking her by Valentine&#39;s Day at the latest, so please leave June of next year open, for I feel summer is the best time for a wedding. We will be out of school for the moment and...&quot;<br />
&quot;Can have a nice long honeymoon,&quot; said Leon, giving Peter another knowing smile.</p>
