<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zack was seperated from Greg and Sam.  All the better for the drill seargent to break the K-9's, as he called them.<br />
<br />
There they were, ex-young men, all sporting varying degrees of fur.  The guy next to Zack had front paws instead of hands - and, as Reddick predicted, was having trouble holding his gun.<br />
<br />
Badly shaved, Zack looked worse than most.  A hairy, dog-like young manin ill fitting uniform in the hot sun.  With a damn tail down his pant leg.  Fur itching, going through humiliation after humiliation from the human drill saergent.<br />
<br />
&quot;O.K, dogs, what are you?<br />
<br />
I can't hear you!<br />
<br />
&quot;Dogs, sir.  Wolves, sir.  Animals sir.&quot;  Zack joined the others half heartedly, wishing he could shoot the guy.<br />
<br />
What are ya, poodles or Rottweilers?  Louder.<br />
<br />
Redditt and Mark stood at the back - stoic as ever, yet, suprising, not hated by the dogs.  They risked their ass, for the others, on enough occasions to get grudging respect.  Besides, they were dogs too - and if they turned on the saergent . . . .<br />
<br />
Zack and the others flinched as the saergent blew a high pitched dog whistle - the guy with the paws used them to cover his ears.<br />
<br />
The Saergent laughed.  &quot;LOUDER&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WE'RE WOLVES, SIR.  WE SHOOT, KILL, TEAR APART WITH OUR TEETH.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you paid?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;RED MEAT and BISCUITS, SIR&quot;  &quot;WOLVES DON'T HAVE NO USE FO MONEY, SIR.&quot;<br />
<br />
What do you do when your off?<br />
<br />
&quot;FIGHT EACH OTHER SIR (Zack rolled his eyes).  TRAIN, SIR.  WE'RE THE SHOCK TROOPS SIR.<br />
<br />
That's what training seemed about - forgeting they were ever human, thought Zack (as he drooled over the thought of a nice juicy steak).  He'd already learned his basic shooting, went through 8 obstacle courses a day, had gone on biduoac, and been shocked by the &quot;dog tags,&quot; just to show escape was futile.<br />
<br />
AND the fights.  Zack was pretty good at those fights the saergent put them in - one with Reddick.<br />
<br />
They had started out punching, Reddick showing him some tricks (he had made Beverley a promise), but in the head of the fight they started using their teeth, like wild animals.  When they stopped, they were both covered in blood -  but still to soon to the approval of the saergent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good job, wolves.  You'll be another Reddit in time - even more of an animal.<br />
<br />
The saergent was joined by an even more brutal lietenant, who inspected the new company.  <br />
<br />
They came up to Zack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rover, ATTEN-HUT&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack went up straight.<br />
<br />
The Lietenant looked him over.  &quot;That the one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice dog, ain't he.  Needs more training, though.<br />
<br />
The Lietenant patted Zack on his head, and scratched behind his ears - Reddit and Mark signaled to him to do nothing, but Zack gave a angry groan - which came out as a growl.<br />
<br />
He immediately whimpered as he felt the shock from his collar, and howled when he heard the whistle.<br />
<br />
&quot;AWOOOOOOOOO.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack stopped in shock.  He rubbed his uneven face with his hand.  He had never howled before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, boy,&quot; laughed the Lietenant.  &quot;That's what wolves do when they're upset - Hey, what's with this one?&quot;<br />
<br />
The &quot;wolf&quot; next to Zack, the one with the paws, was still in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get some steak, CORP. MARK.  Type W&quot; ordered the lietenant.  &quot;You have my permission.<br />
<br />
Redditt, Mark and half the corps went an ashen grey - letting the stubble on their wolf-like, but passably human, faces stand out more than ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;CAN You hold a gun, wolf?&quot; asked the Lietenant, slyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir, and shoot, SIR.&quot;<br />
<br />
The &quot;wolf&quot; was about Zack's height, lean.  He had been a surfer in his earlier life, before he had been conked on the head on the beach.  Went by the name &quot;Bud.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like you were overdosed,&quot; said the Lietenant.  &quot;We might owe you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark reluctantly came out with a raw steak, holding back drool as he did so.<br />
<br />
Zack tried to stop himself, but he began to drool, and his large nose began to twitch.  &quot;Stay&quot; the saergent told Zack.  &quot;IF you know what's good for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now wolves, look here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another blast of the whistle - the lietenant made sure it was right in &quot;Bud's&quot; ear.<br />
<br />
Bud howled in pain, and Zack bit his lip in a desperate attempt not to join him.<br />
<br />
The Lietenant put the steak under Bud's nose.  It began to twitch, like Zack's, then more, then more.<br />
<br />
Bud's face lit up with fear - then, it was no longer a face.<br />
<br />
His teeth grew larger, his nose turned a solid black - pushing out into a slobbering muzzle.<br />
<br />
The lietenant dropped the steak, and stepped a few paces back.<br />
<br />
Bud tried to get a hold of himself - but it was too late.<br />
<br />
He screwed his paws to his eyes as they went an inhuman yellow.  He started to totter on his hind legs.<br />
<br />
Bud's tail ripped through his pant leg.<br />
<br />
His muscles cracked, as he became four legged, and his bulk kept him from standing properly.<br />
<br />
He finally fell to the ground, gobbling up the steak - before turning to his comrades of late, and giving a whine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why you dirty bastards,&quot; muttered Zack, clenching fists - reluctantly obeying Redditt's deperate signals to keep still.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, boy, looks like you can't hold a gun now.  But we have room for you with the calvary.  Well, speak, fella.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bug tried to speak, but all that came out were assorted growls and barks.<br />
<br />
The officer laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;ROVER&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Zack half-heartedly.  The dog whistle again.  &quot;YES, SIR.&quot;<br />
<br />
Take this animal to the B Kennels.  It's stupid to keep it in clothes - take the rags off him.<br />
<br />
&quot;SIR? . . . YES, SIR!&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack felt sick as he took of Bud's cap, and ripped off what was left of his jacket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Private,&quot; smirked the Lietenant.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES, SIR.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THAT'll be you if you can't be trained to shoot.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES, SIR.&quot;<br />
<br />
When he went to the barracks later (&quot;A KENNEL&quot;), Zack no longer felt sick, and a careful inspection showed no damage to him from whatever had been in that steak.<br />
<br />
&quot;No more damage,&quot; muttered Zack in his bunk, twitching his wolf ears, and reaching under his wife beater to scratch his hairy torso.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it,&quot; he muttered.  He had been sleeping on his tail again, and was now bugged by the sensation of pins and needles..</p>
