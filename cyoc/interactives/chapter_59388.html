<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifers eyesight started to really become a big problem. She stumbled her way through the hallway, putting her hand in front of her against the wall to move forward. People looked strangely on her and some even wrinkled their whole face when they saw her. Jennifer felt embarrassed and looked shyly down in the floor as she kept on moving forward, but then again, why should she? Nobody cared or should care about her look. Her head felt itchy from her hair lying all wrong. She started to part her hair and each time she pulled her hands through the hair to part it the straight blonde hair curled up a little bit and darkened, just as if her hands were dirty. She finally drew the remaining hair that covered her face behind her ears and she felt much better already. Her curly, frizzy, mouse-coloured hair with a perfect parting in the middle reached just to her shoulders and it looked like nobody had touched it for weeks. She pulled up her shirt that had slid down her left shoulder. The whole shirt was too big for her and it looked awkward around the bust area were layers of fabric didn't have anything to fill out. Jennifer tried to adjust the shirt as best she could and went inside the classroom she was aiming for.<br />
<br />
The classroom was empty...almost, in the corner of the room sat a girl deep in her exciting book and didn't care about the rest of the world. &quot;Heidi!&quot; yelled Jennifer. &quot;Do you have any spare glasses?&quot;. Heidi looked surprised at the girl and was about to send her away when she looked into her eyes. There was something in her that made her somehow know the person, it was as if she had always known this person but yet she was a complete stranger - and beautiful too. A slender body and big eyes... and her hair. Long, frizzy hair that somehow kept going down along her neck. Heidi's curly, short hair turned into an afro if she didn't cut it in time. Heidi searched nervous in her rucksack and found at last a box she handed over too Jennifer. &quot;Oh, thank you&quot; said Jennifer with a friendly smile. &quot;Eh, they're my old ones so they might look a little bit... eh, out of date&quot; stuttered Heidi. &quot;What? Hi hi, who cares how they look like&quot; giggled Jennifer sweetly and put on her glasses. If Heidi weren't hetero she would have fallen for that line directly, she blushed as she saw Jennifer in her thick, rimmed glasses. Jennifer smiled and looked around in the classroom seeing every little thing there was to see. She turned to Heidi and thanked her and jogged out of the classroom. Heidi sat stunned in her corner, looking at the door Jennifer had left from.<br />
<br />
Jennifer jogged through the hallway and wanted too go to the library, discovering all new things she hadn't found out about yet. Her skirt slid down as she pulled it up again and her shirt fluttered as a flag, she didn't care.<br />
<br />
Around the corner just before the library she took the curve too far and bumped into a walking person. They both flew to the floor and slammed their bodies. The other person started to swear and uttered other inappropriate words. &quot;What the F**K Woman!&quot;. Jennifer looked at the other person. &quot;Oh, hi Melissa&quot; said Jennifer quite dazed. &quot;Say what!? Who are you to think you know me!&quot; Melissa stood up, pulled her baggy pants that was about to fall down, she checked her rings, her bracelets, the  necklaces and her earrings. Nothing seemed to be missing, she turned her cap around so the frame was in her neck - bad-girl-mode on! She went forward with firm steps and made herself combat-ready. Jennifer stood up and ajusted her glasses and looked surprised at Melissa. &quot;Why Melissa? It's me Jennifer&quot;. &quot;Jennifer?&quot; mumbled Melissa. &quot;Jenn!?&quot; Melissa's face changed from mad to shocked as she looked closer into Jennifer's still recognizable face. This was the girl she had grew up with, only living some blocks away they had always played with each other, told their secrets and one time even kissed each other...well, they were only five years old at that time so it wasn't really a Kiss. At high school they had started to go separated ways, but had always stayed friends, even if Jennifer didn't like Melissas new fashion, all hip-hop with baggy clothes and jewellery everywhere on her body. But as Jennifer now looked at her friend it did actually suit her and her latino-tanned skin looked delicious, Jennifer got watery in her mouth and hadn't mind licking her friends whole body...Jennifer shook her head for such unclean thought.<br />
&quot;Jenn? Oh, What?... Jennifer, what happened to you? You look horrible&quot;<br />
Jennifer was about to preach about &quot;...it's the inside that counts&quot; but felt her eyes all teary. She didn't know why she suddenly started to cry, maybe the fist time someone told her she looked terrible. &quot;Oh, Jennifer, I didn't mean to...&quot; as she hugged her friend and patted on her back. Jennifer sobbed and said between the sobbing &quot;It's not fair, why am I the only one to look this way, HORRIBLE!&quot;. &quot;Oh, that's not true&quot; said Melissa in a comforting way. She looked at Jennifer and wiped away her tears. &quot;I want to look like you&quot; said Jennifer straight in Melissas face. Melissa stared surprised into Jennifers serious eyes. &quot;Um, I... Ah, I didn't thought you liked my choice of style&quot; said Melissa quited shocked. &quot;Lies!&quot; yelled Jennifer, &quot;I have like always wanted to be like you, but as I look I don't ever think that will happen&quot;. &quot;Oh, Jennifer, that's not true&quot; said Melissa and stroke Jennifers hair gently. As she touched it it the curls went straight and turned black for a second. Melissa blinked, didn't believe what she saw and saw that nothing had happened, &quot;just my imagination&quot; thought Melissa and took Jennifers hand and went to her locker.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I always keep some extra jewellery just in case&quot; said Melissa as she filled her arms with every little jewellery she could find. Jennifer were amazed by all the wonderful stuff Melissas locker were filled with, she pulled up skirt again that were too big for her. Melissa started to decorate Jennifer like a christmas tree and put bracelets, rings and necklaces everywhere. &quot;Now's the problem...huh?&quot; Melissa had two hoop earrings in her hand ...&quot;I could have sworn that there wasn't any holes in her ears&quot; she muttered, but she shrugged and didn't mind and put the earrings where they belonged. Melissa scratched her chin and looked at Jennifer. &quot;Hmm, those glasses...&quot; She took off her glasses. &quot;Ah, no, I can't see without them&quot; whined Jennifer and took them from Melissas hands and put them right on again. Melissa looked at Jennifer. &quot;Hey, you didn't have any brown eyes&quot; said Melissa. &quot;Duh, Of course I have&quot; said Jennifer with more confidence. Melissa was indeed going mad thin lines of eye-liner grew out of Jennifers eyes and soon her lips became fuller and started to tint purple. Her skin turned a little bit tanned and Jennifer started to comb her hair backward with her fingers as her hair darkened rapidly. It became shiny black and was back combed with a lots of beautiful curls aganist her back. She looked on her body, her breast were still small and her butt hadn't changed either. She didn't care, who would care how she looked like. She ripped her shirt and let the shirt become bare shouldered. She felt sexy, but at the same time she didn't care, she wanted to read a book, a really good one. &quot;Jennifer?&quot; gasped Melissa scared. Jennifer turned to Melissa, adjusted her glasses looked sultry on Melissa. &quot;Who's Jennifer?&quot; she said and went away with a rather nerdy gait leaving Melissa standing agape...</p>
