<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Three more times he was overcome with the pain in his abdomen and each time it felt like it was getting worse. Clueless to what was happening to him, unaware that with each time his dick and nuts shrank a little more, and in the process started to fuse to the area between his legs, and that he had lost a hint of his normal masculine muscle mass, Sei stumbled down the hallway, down a back flight of stairs and down another corridor. Thoughts on only getting out, he breathed a sigh of relief when he opened a door and found himself looking at what he thought was the outside. And then it hit him.<br />
<br />
He wasn&#39;t sure how, but somehow in his search for the entrance, he had ended up at the back of the manor. Looking at what was clearly a garden, his thoughts raced and after a moment, he figured that if he was looking at what he thought he was looking at, it meant that it was outside and that there was a back way off the property. Taking a step out the door, certain in his train of thought, he shivered at the cool stone beneath his bare feet. Wanting only to get home, sneak into his bedroom and change into clothes a guy would wear, he missed it when the door he came through closed and disappeared. Looking at the trees, the path, noticing a couple metal patio chairs and a metal table, Sei took a couple steps forward, then stopped.<br />
<br />
For the briefest of moments, he thought he had heard something close by move about. Peering into the foliage, scared that it might be some wild animal, he shivered again as he thought about what he was wearing and that if he was attacked, there was nothing covering his legs. Feeling exposed, he pulled the robe tighter, adjusted the sash and tiptoeing forward, he warily peered at the plants, a mix of flowers, shrubs, trees and other things he couldn&#39;t begin to describe. Stopping when he came to an open gate, he breathed deeply the rich, earthy scent that had the faintest hint of decay, thinking that something was off.<br />
<br />
After a bit, it came to him that, since he had exited the house, he hadn&#39;t felt any hint of a breeze and that the air had felt sort of warm and muggy. Thinking this wasn&#39;t consistent with how everything normally felt after a bad storm, Sei glanced upward. Seeing nothing at first, it took a moment before his sight adjusted and he could pick out the faintest hint of what looked like a glass ceiling. Cursing, &quot;Dammit,&quot; the teenage boy understood that he had exited the manor into an enclosed garden. Deciding to go back, he took a step and instantly double over in agony as the pain in his abdomen blossomed forth, encompassing not only that particular area, but also his groin, butt, nearly all of his chest and down into his thighs. Thinking he would die this time, he sunk to his knees, crumpled over onto his side and whimpering, he squeezed his eyes shut, praying that the discomfort would leave as quickly as it usually did.<br />
<br />
As the pain continued to rip through part of his body, the teenage boy&#39;s cock and balls shrank even further. Pulling tighter against the area between his legs, his scrotum began to force his testicles up into his body. And as the pain quickly disappated, Sei&#39;s nuts were forced up into his body, where they morphed into a pair of ovaries. Still unaware of what was happening to him, the sixteen year old lay on the path, crying, shaking, and every so often whimpering in anguish. After a moment, he realised he was looking at something and with a trembling hand, reached out and picked up what appeared to be a tiny, white sack that was about the size of the space of the tip of his pinky down to shy of the first knuckle.<br />
<br />
Printed on it, Sei could just barely make out the word &quot;Reversal&quot;. Unsure what he was looking at, he flipped it over and, squinting, thought he could make out something that said &quot;For Emergency Only&quot;. Still at a loss what it was, thinking it felt like it was filled with sand, he clutched it tightly in his hand and after a moment, stood. Something in the bushes moving and taking shambling step back the way he&#39;d come, Sei peered at the foliage warily. Thoughts of wild animals still prominent on his mind, though he couldn&#39;t figure out how they might have got in if the garden was enclosed and turning away, he stumbled back the way he&#39;d come. Reaching the spot were he was sure he&#39;d entered, he frowned at the brick wall and peering to his left and right, seeing nothing by wall, he wondered how someone was to get out if there was no exit.<br />
<br />
Again, he heard the sound of movement and suddenly overcome with fright, he turned and fled blindly down the garden path. The pain in his abdomen threatening to overcome him, Sei whispered, &quot;No. Please. Not now,&quot; and struggling to push past the building agony, he turned down a new path, made his way past a huge fountain and suddenly dropped.<br />
<br />
The anguish worse than ever, the teenage boy was certain that this time he would pass out. Curling up into a fetal position, crying out in pain as his joints locked up, he thought his skin felt weird, almost as if it was shifting. Bewildered by this, missing as his muscle mass again diminished a titbit more and his nut sack pulled so tight against the area between his legs that it ceased to look like a scrotum and looked more like what could eventually be the exterior female genitalia, whilst his dick shrank even more, Sei opened his mouth and uttered a whimpering noise that sounded close to, &quot;Ah-ah-ah-ai-ai-ah-ah-ah-ahhhhhh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Worse than ever, at first the teenage boy was sure that, this time, the agony wouldn&#39;t leave him. But then it began to fade and curious why it didn&#39;t suddenly vanish like the last times, he wondered if maybe it was because he had tried to keep it from overtaking him. Conflicted, his joints finally unlocking, he stretched out and for a moment, lay on the cool stone path, staring up into the darkness. After a bit, he became aware that he was lying next to a stature of a woman and a child in period clothing. Struggling into a sitting position, still clueless as to what was happening him, let alone between his legs, Sei peered at the plaque. Reading what was written, he glanced at the statue and then pushing himself back when he saw that the statue of the child was alive, he yelled, &quot;Good shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
His rational mind insisted that what he saw was a trick somehow. But, as he continue to gaze at the statue, Sei knew it wasn&#39;t anything of the sort and that, somehow, the child&#39;s eyes were moving. And then, to his surprise, the thing spoke.<br />
<br />
Or, more correctly, it tried to speak, as all the Sei could make out was, &quot;Mmm mmm.&quot;<br />
<br />
The oath, &quot;Jumped up holy fuck sticks. She is alive,&quot; escaped him before he could think about it and edging closer, the robe shifting uncomfortably in the process, the teenage boy adjust it as he peered at the statue, who once again tried to tell him something.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he whispered after a moment. &quot;But, I cannot understand you,&quot; and thinking about it, he asked, &quot;Is there anything I can do to help,&quot; then felt liking slapping himself in the forehead with the palm of his hand when he recalled that the stature couldn&#39;t talk and that the only thing that was alive about it was the eyes.<br />
<br />
The statue continued to peer at him, an imploring look in her eyes, and Sei found himself at a loss as to how to help. Raising a hand, he was about to say that he would go get help when he remembered the small sack. Looking at it, curious about the writing, an idea forming, he eventually reached out. Holding it gingerly by one end, scared he would drop it or was holding it by the wrong side, he began to shake it over the statue of the child, starting with her head and moving down toward her feet.<br />
<br />
Unable to see if there was actually in the sack, he at first he thought he might have been mistaken about what it might do. Sitting on the stone path, staring at the statue, he shifted, then pushed himself up into a squatting stance. Dropping the tiny sack in the process, and missing that he had, he suddenly leapt up as, with a cracking sound, the statue went from white stone to that of a living, breathing, little girl in clothes that were, in Sei&#39;s opinion, outdated by at least a hundred years or so. Glancing at the other statue, noting that it hadn&#39;t changed and was still clearly stone, he looked back down at the child, who was looking about nervously, playing with a wide brimmed hat. Hundreds of questions coming to him, he was about to start asking her who she was and how she had been turned to stone when suddenly the girl jammed the hat on her head and grabbed his hand.<br />
<br />
Dazed at how warm it felt, especially as he thought that, only seconds ago, the child had been cold stone, Sei was shocked when the girl cried out, &quot;No time for questions, Sei. Come on. Hurry. They&#39;re are surely coming. I can hear them,&quot; and before he could wrap his mind around all that was happening, or figure out how the girl knew his name, he felt her tugging on him.</p>
