<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There were countless Earths were singularities had begun. Many petered out, their universe burning out, or were crushed by the shadow government agencies that held a firm iron grip on humanity. <br />
<br />
But now two had happened at the same time. But it wasn&#39;t vampires vs werewolves, or elves vs dwarves. No, it was pure insanity. It was anthro maid/butlers vs toons. <br />
<br />
No one was sure where either had come from. The animal girl maids had started in Florida, while the toons had started in California. Neither side was sure where they had come from, as identifying &#39;patient zero&#39; was proving impossible, or they just weren&#39;t talking. <br />
<br />
Many theorized it had started with a cursed internet video, but that was unproven. Other said it was all-powerful aliens just looking for some fun. Or maybe this was just God&#39;s design for the world. <br />
<br />
The animal-girl maids or animal-boy butlers (a large chunk were cat-girls, with the girls out numbering the butlers two to one, but other anthro animals like foxes, snakes, birds, dragons, unicorns, also existed), contrary to their name, almost had just under half also being nudists. But all were driven by the same urge &#39;find a master (or mistress for the butlers)&#39; to serve. <br />
<br />
The toons were all of the humanoid animal variety, some half-dressing, some going &#39;naked&#39; (as far as naked applied to cartoon characters) and looked like 2-D cell animated images in real life walking about. Their forms could stretch and warp. But would always snap back to the exaggerated forms they had (males tended to have bulging muscles that would make Mr. Universe winners blush, and female toons had figures not seem outside of a exaggerated parody of an anime fan&#39;s fantasies). They didn&#39;t have internal organs. They didn&#39;t technically need to eat and sleep.  Their art style as more often than not western film studio cartoons paint cells. <br />
<br />
Their deepest, truest desire that burned in their every fiber of their being was simple: entertain humans. Every toon had an archetype the were created for, and while with focus they could act outside of it, they&#39;d always snap back to their archetype&#39;s behavior. Like characters in a story, they all had their role, and would play them to the hilt to get amuse humans.  And while they had seemingly limitless ability, every thought, every action, every word spoke, HAD to be towards human amusement, and they were fully aware of this state of their minds. They understand this limit, but also embrace it as part of their purpose to entertain. <br />
<br />
Maids/butlers were still flesh and blood, and had to eat, sleep, and the rest, but seemed to have great resistence to disease, healed fast, and had yet to show signs of aging past the moment they were converted. <br />
<br />
They also still had agency over who they gave themselves physically to, and would normally obey all local laws, but if push came to shove and their master&#39;s survival or needs came into conflict, they&#39;d chose their master/mistress every time (even if they weren&#39;t happy about not finding a better way, same as anyone helping a loved one). <br />
<br />
Maids/toons that were denied humans to serve/entertain fell into depression and became increasingly desperate to fulfill their purpose. One catgirl maid acts as the helpful maid to a homeless man after her master died in a car accident. <br />
<br />
Neither the maids/butlers nor the toons found any satisfaction nor fulfillment in trying to serve/entertain each other or themselves. Their meaning came from serving/entertaining HUMANS!  <br />
<br />
Age, sex, race, nothing mattered either to conversion or who they entertained or served. <br />
<br />
Neither were robots, both were capable of feeling sorrow and love, and were able to learn from experience, but at the very foundation of their sense of self, their purpose remained their greatest priority. <br />
<br />
Both were perfectly capable of adding more to their number, but neither had any desire to assimilate all humanity for one very real reason: with no humans, they&#39;d have no one to entertain/serve. <br />
<br />
Both the toons and maid/butlers remembered their former selves, and kept their old personalities, for the most part, traits and/or memories they were deemed contrary to entertainment/domestic service were neatly mentally swept aside and forgotten, and new ones added as needed. <br />
<br />
Neither had any desire to return to their former selves, and proactively undermined any attempts to find ways too. <br />
<br />
Both toons and anthro maid/butlers only converted humans when A) NOT converting humans would to them no longer being able to serve/entertain, or they could entertain a larger group of humans together or better serve their master with their combined efforts. <br />
<br />
The anthro maid/butlers were capable of better teamwork, as they were happy to share a master. Anthro maid/butlers of fantastic creatures could do what their fantasy animals of myth could do, including magic. (Unicorn anthro butlers only ever served virgin women for example). <br />
<br />
Toons were capable of far more fantastic feats, but could chaff working together unless it had to fit with their archetype (like say a pair of toon police dogs, it wouldn&#39;t fit their archetypes to undercut each other) or they&#39;d get more humans to entertain out of it. Many toons understood however it was hard to do a one-man show, and a larger cast could be a power multiplier. <br />
<br />
As such, competition between the two side was FIERCE! Toons carried pink-slips and anthro maids carried paint thinner. Some radicals would convert humans just to spite the other side to deny them their prize of having humans to amuse/serve. <br />
<br />
Toons naturally had it easier, as they could accepted they wouldn&#39;t always have the same audience. But the maids tended to stick with one human or a group of humans until serving them was no longer possible due to death or conversion. One bakaneko maid actually teleported into the prison her master had been sentenced to just so she could continue to serve him! <br />
<br />
Contrary to popular beliefs, being turned into a anthro servant/toon did not mean you were going to be turned into a woman. The toons said something about that being kinda overdone. <br />
<br />
Most crazy of all however, was how humanity had after the initial shock, simply, accepted this as the new status quo. Maybe it was due to some low level reality warping, or a perception filter, or people just wanting to get on with their lives. <br />
<br />
Toons/maids didn&#39;t FORGET their friends and loved ones, nor their feelings for them, (unless it would render their purpose impossible). One boy&#39;s mother was now a cat girl maid, and she was now the most industrious home maker in the neighborhood, even if it mean giving up her previous career, it just didn&#39;t seem as important now (she was perfectly happy to be a legal advisor to Master, aka her husband). She was after she&#39;d tried to send her daughter to a government facility to be &#39;cured.&#39; The fox girl maid would not be denied her purpose. <br />
<br />
Then there was one of his teachers, who was now a lizard woman in nothing but her green scales and her white button collar. Who went out of her way to make teaching as entertaining as possible. As a teacher, she had an endless supply of humans to entertain, and couldn&#39;t be happier. She&#39;d ended up that way when she made the mistake of trying to shut down one of her students who was a toon raccoon entertaining his classmates, a toon would NOT be denied.</p>
