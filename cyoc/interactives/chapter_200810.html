<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Troy watched as Rosco rolled onto his back and stretched in an unnatural way. His limbs grew longer, thicker, more human. His chest and pecs bulked up while he watched and the ‘dog’ rolled onto his heavier paws. Clothes formed around him as he did, a thong wrapping around his crotch, revealing nothing but a rather sizeable bulge. <br />
<br />
The fur receded all over Rosco’s body revealing thick tight muscles that became wrapped in a tank-top and shorts. Like Clint, a hole formed in the back of the gym shorts and his tail-trimmed nicely-extended through it. Only the hair on top of his head remained unshaven, but trimmed into a cut that complimented his doggy features.<br />
<br />
As the transformation ended, Rosco-or was it Dustin? Held a beer in his hand and chatted happily with Clint. All around them, tons of anthros had gathered. What was once a solo cookout was now a block party in their little cul-de-sac. Sixteen families grilled and chatted in the small grassy circle in the center of the drive. Rosco glanced at the window and waved.<br />
<br />
Troy waved back, suddenly uncertain. Who was in control? The loyal and reliable Rosco, still enthralled by the control spell, or the untrustworthy Dustin? He’d find out shortly. He took a breath and walked out to greet his newly transformed friend.<br />
<br />
As he exited the apartment, he noticed two cars in his designated spots. One was a lovely Ford Mustang who could never afford and the other a patrol car for Highway Patrol. He wondered whose they were but Rosco cut him off.<br />
<br />
“Hey bae.” Rosco grinned and hugged him. Troy stood still in shock and didn’t return the hug. “What’s wrong?”<br />
<br />
“What…” Troy chose his words carefully, “Do you mean by that, exactly?”<br />
<br />
“I…” Rosco searched Troy’s face in concern, “I’m not..sure? Did I do something wrong, handsome?”<br />
<br />
Troy’s breath hitched in his chest. “Are we dating?”<br />
<br />
“Dating? We’re betrothed!” Rosco held up his ring and pointed at Troy’s hand, “You don’t remember when I gave you that engagement ring at our old playground?”<br />
<br />
Troy shakily raised his hand. On it glinted a gold band. He swallowed heavily. This was a possibility he should have foreseen Unfortunately for them both, Troy was straight and had no intention to let that…his gaze shifted to the large bulge in Rosco’s shorts…thing anywhere near his ass.<br />
<br />
“You’re a cop?” Troy asked.<br />
<br />
Rosco nodded slowly, “Dude, I’m really starting to worry about you. Maybe those toe stubs sent a clot up into your brain.”<br />
<br />
“Rosco, come on-”<br />
<br />
“My name isn’t Rosco.”<br />
<br />
“Dustin?”<br />
<br />
“This isn’t funny,” Rosco crossed his well-muscled arms in front of his sizeable chest, “My name is Rusty and you know it. I can’t believe you.”<br />
<br />
Troy’s jaw dropped, “What!”<br />
<br />
“I’m an anthro. I earned my name. Fucking asshole. You know what? I’m going in. Sleep on the couch tonight!” Rusty stomped back into the house and slammed the door hard enough that people jumped and stared at Troy.<br />
<br />
Clint snorted. “You really crossed a line with him.”<br />
<br />
The overly muscled horseman was grilling even more steaks now. The corn lay ungrilled on the side still. Reality had altered heavily.<br />
<br />
“Talk to me, Troy.”<br />
<br />
“What if I told you that I used a magic book to alter reality and changed my neighborhood into anthros?” Troy said. “What changed? Why are there so many anthros and where did they all come from?”<br />
<br />
Clint stared at him and snorted. “You…aren’t lying. Well…if you’re responsible for this,” he pumped an arm so the veins popped, “Then I guess I have to thank you. Your…spell changed the world. Gene-splicing has cured most cancers and eliminated many diseases. Rusty chose to become an anthro through anthro therapy so you two could afford the lifestyle you want. He preferred wolf but those aren’t exactly legalized yet. Non-domesticated species are tracked in a database.”<br />
<br />
Troy nodded, but decided to check his social media. No anthro celebrities. In fact, none of his contacts outside of his little cul-de-sac appeared to have changed. That was something to think about. Clint thinks it’s global and it clearly isn’t. <br />
<br />
“Why would becoming a dog make him money?”<br />
<br />
“As a police officer?”<br />
<br />
Troy smacked himself in the forehead. “Drug busts. Right.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Inside the house, Rusty had gotten a stiff drink and locked the door. Troy could find someone else’s couch to sleep on tonight for all he fucking cared. After everything he’d given to be his good boyfriend. He’d passed on a wolf treatment and settled for German Shepherd just so he could make some money because he told his friends at work that Troy was worth it.<br />
<br />
But this? This…this outburst? Rusty couldn’t being to fathom where it even came from. Pre-marriage jitters? Was he afraid Rusty would try to persuade him to become an anthro too? Animal splicing wasn’t common, there was heavy discrimination against anthros because of the furry fetishists that immediately latched onto it. Getting called a furfag from passers by while on the beat wasn’t fun. Sure, he literally was a furry fag, but…goddammit. Rusty threw the remote against the wall. The back case broke and the batteries scattered around the living room like shrapnel.<br />
<br />
He took a gulp of Jack and Coke but it did nothing to calm his nerves. That was it. Troy hadn’t even hugged him back today. That hurt. Rusty looked for something else to throw and spied a leather-bound book titled Book of Beasts on the coffee table. He grabbed it and-<br />
<br />
And his mind snapped back to him. His life as Dustin. Knocking up a chick and running to Troy’s. Getting turned into a dog. Being commanded to be a good boy and losing himself to the personality of a very intelligent, obedient dog. And finally the life he lived now…and the discussion Troy had with him at the coffee shop a few minutes ago.<br />
<br />
Red drops splattered the cover of the book and Rusco-no Dusty…Rusty? Grabbed a box of tissues but the red liquid kept dripping onto the book. He looked up but saw nothing. Then he felt warmth trickling down his throat and tasted copper on the back of his tongue.<br />
<br />
Rusty stuffed more tissues up his rather large nostril to catch the sudden, inexplicable nosebleed he had. Was he having some kind of aneurysm from all the realities crashing together? Would he die? He realized his pawed hand still held the book and dropped it. The memories were less forceful now, and as he sat there and calmed his pounding heart, he became aware that his memories as Dustin and Rosco were fading. He got a pen and paper and wrote down all he could remember.<br />
<br />
Then he went to the window and glanced out. Clint and Troy were engrossed in a conversation. He could hear some of it-the apartment lacked the needed soundproofing to keep sounds in or out. Troy was asking about reality. Rusty flicked through his phone, expecting to see all the anthros he remembered in his memories…and found that it amounted to just the people in the cul-de-sac. His heart sank and tears welled up int he corner of his eyes.<br />
<br />
So many people had been happy when the genetherepy came out. They didn’t actually exist in anything but his own memories. He sighed. So, all of that happened because Troy wanted to be a tigerman. Wait…was Troy actually straight? Did he marry a straight guy? Jesus, no wonder he’d recoiled when Rusty had hugged him. The horror in his eyes when Rusty had told him they were engaged.<br />
<br />
He rubbed his reddening muzzle with one pawed hand. I’m a terrible boy…friend.<br />
<br />
Rusty stood and paced, ears flattened back to his skull. His gaze shifted to the book. Troy had asked him to transform him after all. But a tiger…those were tracked…in his reality. Which didn’t actually exist beyond the neighborhood. So there wasn’t going to be a problem-there wouldn’t be, he realized, if reality changed. Instead of becoming a German Shepherd to support their lifestyle, he’d have done it so he could get an exotic species waiver for Troy. Obviously. And Troy would definitely be gay. A win-win!<br />
<br />
But was it right? Was that him wondering that or the command by Troy that seemed to guide his every action? Well, in that case, wouldn’t it be fair that Troy would have to suffer a little to get what he wanted? Dustin was straight too once. Er-Rusty. No…shit. Rusty rubbed his head. As far as he could remember from both his lives, straight and gay, sex was great. He’d been the top in their relationship. Hopefully that didn’t change. Troy squealing as he took his thick knot…<br />
<br />
Rusty licked his lips and stared out the window. He’d made up his mind. In a sense, he could be gay and pound some pussy. A big, muscular pussy with a tight bubble-butt and a striped tail. He concentrated on Troy.<br />
<br />
“Half!”</p>
