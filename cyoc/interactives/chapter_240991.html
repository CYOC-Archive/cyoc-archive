<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as Tracey was contemplating following Ann back to her house to have some more fun, a call from over the fence caught her attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Trace, do you mind if Ricky and I come over for a quick visit?&quot; called Emily from the other side of the fence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, sure,&quot; answered Tracey, interested to see how the two former toddlers, now parents to their former mothers were reacting to the role shift--even with reality having shifted to account for the old switcheroo.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, Rick and Emily, now each wearing a t-shirt over their swimwear, joined Tracey on her back patio.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what brings you two love birds over here?&quot; asked Tracey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you see, uh... Emily had a question she wanted to ask you,&quot; mumbled Rick as he looked down at the glass of iced tea in front of him that Ann had left before hurrying back to Bryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;How long did it take for you and Tom to get pregnant?&quot; blurted out Emily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Crystal is upstairs asleep and just over a year old, add nine months onto that, and you&#39;ll be able to figure that out,&quot; joked Tracey.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not what we meant,&quot; said Rick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what did you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it hard to conceive at first?&quot; asked Emily, &quot;Because Rick and I have been trying and trying like crazy and it feels like... no matter what we do, nothing seems to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Emily, I wouldn&#39;t worry too much, it&#39;ll happen when it&#39;s meant to happen. Who knows maybe the first few times the wrong match between egg and sperm happened and it just didn&#39;t take--those things happen too, far more often than we know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For almost an entire year?&quot; asked Rick<br />
<br />
Emily was now beginning to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t cry, now... look, I bet the next time you two get together you&#39;ll have such a time of it, you&#39;ll have twins out of it. Call it intuition.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tracey decided to subtly speed up Heather and Jennifer&#39;s aging a tad in order to get herself out of this conversation quicker.<br />
<br />
It was amazing to watch as Emily&#39;s belly slowly began to grow and stretch over the next few moments. Emily stopped crying when the belly was physically visible.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how to be a good mother, what if I&#39;m horrible at it? Both Rick and I lost our mothers when we were two,&quot; said a now worried Emily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do fine. Some parts of motherhood are instinctual, and what isn&#39;t, you can always ask me,&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s belly now began to stretch the overlarge shirt she&#39;d borrowed from Rick out a bit, &quot;But twins are going to be so much harder to deal with. If this was just one baby...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;ll figure out the whole twin thing together, I&#39;m having a pair of my own,&quot; assured Tracey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I can&#39;t wait for them all to be old enough to have play dates together,&quot; said Emily as her worries seemed displaced with a calm and easygoing smile as she passed into the fifth month of pregnancy and Tracey halted the accelerated aging of Heather and Jennifer.<br />
<br />
&quot;That will be something to look forward to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, where&#39;s my shirt?&quot; called a male voice from the other side of the fence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mine&#39;s missing too!&quot; called another, and Tracey took a look at her screen to see that the 28 year olds Ralph and Carlos, the husbands to Heather and Jennifer had come back outside and likely noticed that certain things were missing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did think it weird that there were these shirts just hanging on the fence, especially as they don&#39;t quite fit right,&quot; said Rick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are those guys? And what are they doing over at our house?&quot; asked Emily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go check,&quot; said Rick as he stood, took the shirt he was wearing off, causing his muscles to better stand out--and likely intimidate--and then proceeded to return next door.<br />
<br />
Tracey now wondered what to do with the husbands and former fathers of Rick and Emily, before a brilliant idea popped into her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emily, you and Rick want a big family, right?&quot; asked Tracey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... eventually.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so, Tracey selected both Ralph and Carlos&#39;s ages and altered their ages.<br />
<br />
Everything was quiet over on the other side of the fence. Rick hadn&#39;t yet gotten to the backyard, and Carlos and Ralph were busy looking in the backyard shed. By the time Rick had entered the backyard and saw them, enough age had been stripped from them that Rick was older than they were, though not by much.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you two punks think you&#39;re doing?&quot; bellowed Rick.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were looking for our wi--girlfriends, uh... sir. They s-said they&#39;d be back here by the pool tanning,&quot; explained the now teenage Ralph with only a slight screech to his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honest, they s-said we&#39;d f-find them back here,&quot; added Carlos with a bit more break in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it seems you&#39;ve got the wrong house, now do you leave or do I call your parents?&quot; asked Rick.<br />
<br />
Screeching pleas to not call their parents traced Ralph and Carlos&#39; voices ever higher until there was no trace of the baritone voices left in the boyish sopranos they now spoke in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t call them. But for scaring my wife, I think you two should apologize to her, come with me,&quot; insisted Rick.<br />
<br />
By the time Rick had directed the boys through his house and around to Tracey&#39;s back patio, Ralph and Carlos were on the younger side of children, looking to be about second grade, maybe first. Their clothes they wore had kept up their change with them, their swimsuits merely shrinking in size along with their sandals. One was a dark haired boy, Ralph, and the blond cutie was Carlos.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on and apologize,&quot; insisted Rick as he stood by the door, and each boy gulped before approaching as they gained a little more baby fat and cuteness before saying, as best as any Kindergartner could, &quot;We&#39;re sorry for scaring you,&quot; in unison.<br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s demeanor seemed to shift at this point as she said she&#39;d forgive them for running off just this once and encouraged both boy to climb up next to her and sit beside her--which definitely would help with the next part of the transformation.<br />
<br />
Ralph and Carlos made the attempts to climb up and sit, but unfortunately for them, their regression continued and made doing so nigh impossible for their increasingly less coordinated bodies. So in the end, Tracey helped Emily lift each boy up and have them seated next to her as they re-entered toddlerhood and their swimsuits thickened up into swimming diapers, at this point, Ralph moved his hand to his mouth and began to suck on his thumb.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh stop that, Ralphie, you&#39;ll ruin your teeth doing that, chastised the increasingly shrinking baby.<br />
<br />
Soon both Ralph and Carlos were newborns and then poof they disappeared and joined Heather and Jennifer in Emily&#39;s belly, causing it to expand and stretch out further.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh lord, the quadruplets are busy today.&quot; said Emily as she placed her hand on her five month belly with quadruplets, which made her look much further along than she was.<br />
<br />
Ralph and Carlos having reached the point that Tracey wanted them to, decided to re-engage the accelerated age option, only this time setting it towards regression, and so she watched as Emily&#39;s overly large belly shrank until it seemed flat and a stunned look crossed both her and Rick&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse us, Tracey, but Ricky and I have to go home and check on the kitchen&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;laundry,&quot; said Rick at the same time as Emily said kitchen. Both locked eyes and a deep passion caught them both and Tracey knew that the two of them would be lucky to not jump each other in front of her. So Tracey scooped up the laptop and said she had to go and use the bathroom quick. Once settled inside, Tracey watched on the screen as Rick and Emily went at each other on Tracey&#39;s back patio. Soon a small ding was herd which denoted that the former parents were now unconceived.<br />
<br />
A few moments later another ping sounded, denoting that four babies had been reconceived, and it was here that Tracey decided to switch a few things up, changing Heather to Heath, Jennifer to Jenson, Ralph to Raleigh, and Carlos to Carla. Tracey aged the quadruplets up just a tiny bit so that Emily knew she was pregnant, but not with how many kids just yet.</p>
