<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike watched himself in the mirror and was in complete and utter awe.  Thanks to the Chronivac, he has gone from a Middle age over worked husband and father with three kids and dead end job, to a 30-year-old man in his prime with a muscular build and a brighter future ahead of him.  He watches as the day and night zipped by as his parents went in and out of the room like a blur as time was traveling back.  And while he was moving normally, his clothes continue to flash by with some of those times seeing himself naked with a long sausage sized dick nestled between his legs with two huge balls dangling between.  Checking himself out, he rubbed his well trimmed beard and was amazed at how much progress, or regress was made.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn...  Just look at me.  I forgot how fucking hot I was before making some bad choices in my life.  And just look at my baby.  All big and meaty.  Can&#39;t wait to fuck with any girl I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Checking himself in the mirror, Mike was amazed that how much he changed and sacrifice to get his body back to what it once was. But to him, it is not enough.  While he is back in his prime state, he wasn&#39;t satisfied.  That is why he used the Chronivac, to reround himself and the world around him to a specific time and year he can rebound and live a different life.  And a man enter thirty means that it would get him back to when he was going nowhere.  So he keep staring himself at the mirror as time keeps on rewinding back as the days and night zipped by in seconds as blurs of his mom and dad moved around the room.<br />
<br />
Looking on, he could see his clothes appearing and disappearing, transitioning from polo shirts, dress pants, muscle shirts, gym shorts, sneakers, dress shoes, suits, ties, the typical thirty year old stuff when he left the military to begin his search for a job, that would in turn lead to his boring, dead end, life.  Though he smirked when he sees his half naked side, wearing boxers and swim trunks, even seeing himself fully naked with his huge dick and balls in-between his legs.  But by the time he left thirty and was re-entering his twenties, he could see that the most drastic changes were starting.<br />
<br />
For one, he could see flashes of himself wearing a military uniform and a military top and long camouflage pants, even seeing himself in camo gear and holding a rifle in his hand.  Starring at that in the mirror, he could tell what it meant.  He was going back to his time when he was at the military.  It was a known fact that his family was mostly a military family, as his father was one, then his grandfather, and his great-grandfather.  Which means that he was next in line to serve his country. But deep down, he knew that the military wasn&#39;t for him.  There were certain opportunities he would&#39;ve take that would&#39;ve been more fun then doing mindless drills and going to battle. But his father forced him to go and it led him down the very path of nowhere.  But now that he used the Chronivac to reverse time, he can actually remove his military experience and do something completely different for a change. <br />
 Maybe even find true love pre military life. He just need to wait until the process is over.<br />
<br />
Looking at all the military attire flashing by, he smirked and said, &quot;Looks like I&#39;m going back through my military years.  Time to remove that from my life for good.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he watches on, Mike can noticed the changes happening in rapid time. In his military suit, he always sees metals of honor and promotions he got.  But when he was looking at himself, those badges seem to be disappearing as he was getting demoted down the ranking system.  But that&#39;s not the only thing that was happening to him.  Looking on, he could see every muscle in his body slowly deteriorating before his eyes.  His arms and legs were thinning away as his chest didn&#39;t look at manly as before.  Even his abs have downgraded into a six pack with a much thinner stomach.  Looking at that, he never realized how much muscles he gained during the intense military training that he had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa...  I so forgot that I wasn&#39;t that muscular before getting forced to military school.  It is like five years of hard work and dedication were melting away.  Oh well...  Guess that&#39;s the sacrifice you got to pay to live a far better life then before.&quot; he said with sadness, but relief.<br />
<br />
Looking onwards, he knew that the changes aren&#39;t done yet as there is still some time to go before reaching his destined year, and to him, he enjoys watching himself regress and degrade through time.<br />
<br />
As soon as he left his military years behind, he could see that he was now sporting designer Ts, polo shirts, blue jeans, dress pants, sneakers, and loafers.  Even seen himself in a football uniform and gym attire from time to time. <br />
 No doubt, he was going back through his college days as he was rewinding through the 1990s at an alarming rate. <br />
 His muscles weren&#39;t shrinking like at the time he removed himself through military school, but it was much slower then before due to the fact that he was playing football since he was in grade school.  But the most drastic came with his face and hair.  Getting a closer look at the mirror, he could see that his hair was slowly shifting styles.  Normally, he was sporting a short crew top for a long time, but now that he&#39;s back in college, his hair was growing and shrinking in a few areas while the top part came down and covered his eye, making it look like a cow lick that was popular for college boys.  Not only that, but his beard was going through a transition as the bristles and the side burns separated itself from the sides as the small hairs on his cheeks were slowly shrinking into his skin, leaving it smooth and nice.  Pretty soon, he didn&#39;t have much of a beard and was now a mustache and goatee combo with a ring around his mouth.  It was at the time he was only shaving around the mouth as he was trying to get comfortable with the look.  Still, no matter how he look, he was just a young, rugged, and handsome to the ladies.<br />
<br />
Instinctively flipping the cowlick up, Mike gave a coy grin and spoke to the mirror, &quot;Hey there good looking.  Like what you see?  Why don&#39;t come on over to my place so you can see the full package, if you know what I mean.&quot;  He soon broke out in laughter as he never behaved like that before.  Preferably because his body language is changing to match up with his age.  &quot;Wow!  I never behaved like that before since I graduated college.  Guess the Chronivac is making me match with the times.  Really need to get use to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he was adjusting to the body language, he felt something in his hand.  Looking down, Mike could see his closed fist was holding something.  Lifting it up, he opened his palm to see what it is.  That&#39;s when he saw something he didn&#39;t expect.  In his hand are four yellowish-white objects, all glossy and hard.  Upon closer inspection, he realized what they were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...  Are those...  Teeth?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Indeed...  Those are Mike&#39;s teeth.  Or to be more précised, Mike&#39;s Wisdom Teeth.  He knew deep down that he had them removed in his early twenties.  But now he was holding them in the palm of his hands as if they appeared out of the blue.  He wondered why they showed up unexpectedly.  But then, he felt like he needed to open his mouth to see what would happen next.  Opening his jaws, he could see his perfectly white teeth with a bit of yellow on the edges, all perfectly lined up and now slants of indents.  Almost instantly, the wisdom teeth jumped out of his palm and flew up to his mouth.  Each tooth went into his mouth and implanted themselves in his gums, snuggling up next to his back molars.<br />
<br />
Mike was caught by surprise, but he knew what it meant.  Closing his mouth, he grind his teeth a little bit before saying, &quot;Damn!  That was unexpected.  Not only have my wisdom teeth appeared on my hand, but they flew up into my mouth and implanted themselves into my gums.  Guess the Chronivac can also bring back teeth that was removed I go through a reverse removal of them.  How unique!  Hmm...  Wonder what happens when I go younger to the point where my baby teeth would return?  Heh...  That would be something to see.&quot;<br />
<br />
By the time he though of that, he reached twenty years of age and was about to re-enter his teens.  Suddenly, he felt a bit of vertico as he was experiencing a slight drop.  Feeling a bit of nausea, he sat down on his former bed and took a breather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa...  That was...something...  What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting back up, he looked to the mirror and noticed something about himself.  Normally, Mike was around six feet in length, tall and manly even in his thirties.  But looking into the mirror, he noticed that he was half a foot short, marking him at five and a half.  That is because the room he was currently in was bigger then he remembered.  Seeing the sudden change in height, Mike knew what that meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!  Did...  Did I went through a reverse growth spurt in seconds.&quot; he asked himself as his voice sounded youthful, yet still mature.  Seeing himself in a different view, he smirked and said back, &quot;Jesus...  Whatever this Chronivac is doing to me, it sure knows how to surprise me.  Looks like my only option is to watch and enjoy this little ride back in time.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he starred at himself, he could see that his clothing consisting flashed through designer Ts, shirts, jackets, blue jeans, shorts, khakis, sneakers, sandals, and briefs.  He could tell that he was going through his early college years and post high school years.  But during the flashes, he caught a brief look at his naked form and could see that the body he was working on for years were dwindling away.  The muscle tone was thinning bit by bit, crossing him over to a leaner young adult/late teen look.  His abs were more faded as they weren&#39;t as noticeable as before.  But the one thing that caught his eye was his own package.  It was half the size and mass then before and was slowly decreasing as the days pass by in seconds.  His face was starting to loose his chiseled look as his squared jaw was looking more rounded and his nose was getting a little smaller.  His hair soon started to go a little unruly and curly as the reverse days progressed, preferably because it was the time he rarely cut his hair.  Typical late teen outcast.  As for his facial hair, it was shifting once more.  The ring around the mouth faded away as the goatee was just a little peach fuzz on the chin.  The mustache was still the same, but it wasn&#39;t a full as before.<br />
<br />
Seeing himself, Mike was amazed of how much he lost during the 32 years of his previous life.  &quot;Man, I really forgot how lean I look.  Not a teen heartthrob, but it will do just fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he reached eighteen, time itself was slowing down with the days and nights and silhouettes of his parents slowed along with it.  It soon stopped and resumed forward at normal speed, the Chronivac went to the destined year of 1990, where Mike was a late teen high school graduate that barely passed.  If it wasn&#39;t for his accomplishments in football, he would be held back.  Looking at himself, he noticed that he was in his football uniform.  He was dressed with shoulder pads and his high school jersey with the numbers &#39;72&#39; on it, marking the day he was born.  He was wearing a pair of white pants that goes down his ankles with knee pads on his knees and elbow pads on his elbows.  He had on a pair of gloves meant to hold the football when throwing, grabbing, or running with it.  And he had on a pair of cleats to run on grassy terrain with socks that go up his legs.  He was even holding a helmet with one hand and a football with the other.<br />
<br />
Seeing himself, Mike realized what this was.  &quot;Wait a minute...  I remember this uniform.  This is the night me and my team are going to win the championship in the finals of the NCAA Division.  We tried to win it, but the opposing team got the better of us and we lost by a mere margin.  That was a devastating loss after all the hard work we&#39;ve accomplished.&quot;  He remembered that day oh so well.  The fact that they were close to winning, only to have one slip up and they failed to win the championship.  He blames himself for his mess up and wished he would&#39;ve done things differently.  But thanks to the Chronivac, he was now back to the night of the finals and maybe he can win the championship this time.<br />
<br />
With a smirk on his face, he dropped the ball and ruffed his messy hair.  &quot;Well this time, things will change.  I know that winning this game will grant me a chance to play in the pro leagues.  Hell, that loss itself led to that downward spiral after all.  The dead end college, the military, meeting my wife, getting married, having three kids, all of which connected to this game.  Well not today!  I know what I did wrong and now I will make it right.  All I need to do is fix the one mistake at the end of the game and we will win it all.  And from there, well, the future will be bright for good all Mikey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Placing the football helmet over his head, Mike banged it and said...<br />
<br />
&quot;All right!  Game on!&quot;</p>
