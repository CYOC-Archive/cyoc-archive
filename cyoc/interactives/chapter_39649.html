<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you and the rest of the donkeys are escorted out of the bar, you are pulled aside suddenly and find yourself trotting in a different direction.  It's a bit difficult to be walking on four hooves, let alone being a donkey in the first place.  You just hope wherever you're being led doesn't mean anything worse for you, this is humiliating as is.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, little missie.&quot; Says the person leading you.  You wonder where this person, who's touch gives you the impression it's a woman, is taking you to.  It's then that you see a smaller building, close to the bar you were just transformed at.  You let out a low moaning bray, afraid of what else they could do to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, sweetie.  It's alright.&quot; Says the woman, which did little to help your situation.  You tried to pull yourself away, but a rope tied firmly around your thick neck keeps you from getting away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not gonna hurt you.  My boss just wants to see you.  She won't hurt you.&quot;  The woman tries to say to comfort you.  You just continue to struggle until you finally get too tired to resist any longer.  Head hanging low, you finally walk with the woman into the building.<br />
<br />
The office looks like a normal office, but the atmosphere seems more like a barn, even the floor is covered in hay.  You start to feel more comfortable in here.  It feels like home....wait....you don't live in a barn!  You live in a house!  You are not a donkey, you yell to your mind.  Do not submit to it!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, dear.&quot; Comes a voice from nearby.  Looking around you spot a desk and a woman, though her face is hidden from the light.  The tone wasn't necessarily sinister, but you still feel very nervous.  You try to say something, but all that comes out is a hoarse bray.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, I know what you mean,&quot; says the woman behind the desk, &quot;You wonder why I turned everyone into donkeys, and you want to know why you're here, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod your head slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the first one I won't answer.  The second one I will.  You were chosen because I have an offer for you.  I can make you human again,&quot; You raise your head quickly, tail flicking (Wow did that feel weird to move your tail...), &quot;Ah, I see you're excited.  But I'm not making you fully human.&quot;  Your ears fall back slightly and your tail stops moving.<br />
<br />
The woman chuckles, &quot;Sorry, this is my only offer.  You see, I'm running short on employees at my club, the one you just were.  I need a few more donkey girls to join my team.  So here's the deal.  I make you a donkey girl like all my other employees and you work at my bar in a variety of jobs.  This deal will last for good, no turning back.  Of course, if you like being a full donkey forever that's okay with me, hehe.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stare at the woman in surprise.  Become a donkey girl like those at the bar?  That sounds both horrible, yet intriguing at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren't the only one we offered the job,&quot; the woman said, &quot;We hired a few others, including one you may know personally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Feeling confused you notice more of the donkey girls from before bringing forth another full donkey.  You could hardly tell by the looks, but the scent of him made you realize it was your boyfriend.  Did the club owner just say that he agreed to work for them?  But she said she was looking for donkey GIRLS.....no, she couldn't have meant....<br />
<br />
&quot;And now I think it's time for this one to begin.&quot; The owner said.  One of the donkey girls nods and puts a needle into your boyfriend's backside.  After a quick little bray/yelp from the donkey he falls to the floor.  Seconds later, something begins happening to him.  The skin on his entire body begins to ripple.  You see his spine shake violently as he soon finds himself standing on two hooves, his forelegs sticking out in front of him comically like the Frankenstein monster.  His hind legs begin to twitch and convulse as they bend at an angle to allow his elongating foot hooves to rest comfortably on the floor.  With a loud crunching sound, his forelegs return to his sides as his shoulders realign, making him have a more human appearance.  His arms begin to lengthen, elbows re-reversing, and his front hooves crack, separating into individual fingers once more.  His hands take on a more human appearance once again, but now his fingers end in hard little hoof-nails<br />
<br />
As the changes progress you notice he is beginning to get a boner from all of this.  The feeling must be ecstatic if he got one this fast, you think, and.....that large...you admit, seeing the size of his cock grow more and more, but then you see just the opposite start happening.  Rather than growing out any further it starts sucking back in slowly, and his testicles begin to shrink with each passing second.  Knowing where this was going next you see his genitalia suck right into his crotch, where a slit begins to form.  Your boy....err...girlfriend can't help....her-self from reaching down and feeling his/her new vagina, though still lightly furred. She (As you are now aware he is now officially a she) lets out a small bray of pleasure as she feels herself.  But she is soon distracted by small bumps forming in her chest.<br />
<br />
What started off as little mosquito bites soon grew into the ample sized breasts that he was staring at so fixedly not long ago as a male human.  Soon, she was feeling those with her free hand.  Looking at another person....donkey....whatever, feeling themselves up you had to look away.  You know she must be excited to be a woman now, but she didn't have to do that in front of you.<br />
<br />
The owner seemed to understand you looking away and silently instructs the other donkey girls to stop your former boyfriend.  They nod and pull his arms away from him.  She lets out a bray of anger, which slowly forms more human like words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeeeyy!  Hawwtop! Let Meheeehaww gAWWW!&quot;  You could tell her vocal cords were coming back as she started sounding clearer every time she spoke.  And this voice wasn't her former boyfriend's voice.  This was higher-pitched, very feminine sounding.  They really gave her the complete package, you think.  Her face begins to reform a bit, with her muzzle pushing back a little bit, so her lips could move better, but much of her head remained the same.  A minute later, she seemed to be finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm, I think a new name is in order for you,&quot; The owner says, &quot;I believe Noelle works.  Is that alright with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The new former human boyfriend donkey girl, now named Noelle, nodded slowly, looking over her new body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, Noelle, welcome to the Donkey Delight family.  Meet your new sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other donkey girls present begin to walk to their new coworker and sister, engaging her in conversation.  When looking at them all, Noelle hardly looked any different from the rest of them, but her scent told you it was her.<br />
<br />
That was going to take some getting used to, seeing your former boyfriend as Noelle the donkey girl.  While you think about this, the owner turns her head to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now, my dear.  Have you considered my offer?&quot;</p>
