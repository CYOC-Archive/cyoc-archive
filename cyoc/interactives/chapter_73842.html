<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake's shoulders spread wide. His arms had biceps as big as his waist was his pecs were so large he could no <br />
longer see his penis nor his washboard abs. His legs spread wide, the muscle forcing them apart. He looked in <br />
the mirror and he was more of a caricature of a muscle man than most muscle men.<br />
<br />
Oh damn that was so hot Jake said to no one in particular. <br />
<br />
Grabbing the laptop he clicked on the first video file he saw and it started playing. There he saw two very <br />
heavy set men having sex.<br />
<br />
Ty watched as Jake was fascinated with what was going on in the video. He thought about this being hot as hell <br />
but then he would look at the fat men and be grossed out. Not a single time was he able to tear his eyes from <br />
the video. As he stroked he got harder and harder. Damn this should make me freaky muscled he thought as he <br />
stroked himself.<br />
<br />
Jake noticed that he was wincing around on the chair as he was stroking himself. His ass began to itch. As <br />
Jake rose, his eyes transfixed on the video he noticed himself at first scratching his ass and then one finger <br />
going in and out of his asshole. When he got to two fingers he stopped stroking his cock and then moved on to <br />
three fingers. It wasn't until he had his fist up his hole that he realized that he was really getting excited <br />
by this. His arms being so muscled he had a hard time getting more than just his hand in his ass but they were <br />
meaty hands. He looked around the room and saw his football and ran to get it. Sitting it on the chair he <br />
began to force it, thin side up into his ass. When it got to the widest point he moaned loudly in such a <br />
massive orgasm that his last cum was but a minor drop in the bucket. He would no longer think of stroking his <br />
own cock, he wanted other things up his ass.<br />
<br />
But that wasn't the only change. His arms filled out all the way from the shoulders down to the now sausage <br />
like fingers. His pecs having just previously stuck out because of the muscle stretching his chest were now <br />
sagging but not at all lower than they were previously. Jake's pecs were now supported by a very robust <br />
stomach reaching out in front of him spreading his legs to allow his now rotund form sag between his legs. His <br />
previously muscled legs were still quite muscled but with a thick layer of fat to his cackles. It wasn't until <br />
he tried to get up that he realized that his ass had grown so wide that he was stuck in the chair.<br />
<br />
Laughing himself into a state of hysterics Ty finally got up and helped pull the chair from Jake's ass. The <br />
extraction sending a jiggle throughout Jake's body. Ty saw the very tip of the other end of the football <br />
protruding from Jake's ass. Ty was sent into another fit of laughter and when he composed himself he told Jake <br />
to bend over the side of the bed and push as if he were taking a big crap. Jake's belly hit the bed which <br />
supported him and he began to massage his now man boobs. As he massaged himself his ass began to convulse and <br />
the ball began to extract itself.<br />
<br />
With one huge orgasm his ass expelled the ball and he collapsed face first onto the bed. If it weren't for the <br />
massive ass cheeks it would have looked like Jake's ass was permanently open. But the jiggly ass was exhausted <br />
and needed some rest now. It would need more attention soon but for now Jake slept.</p>
