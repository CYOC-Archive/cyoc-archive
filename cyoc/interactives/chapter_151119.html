<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>More sexual tension and language</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff was out for a short nap of about 45 minutes. Placing the timer down to about 12 hours, 15 minutes. He sullenly stirs awake, this time slightly less confused. He&#39;s still confused about the time of day, as it&#39;s completely dark. Pitch black all around. Still lying on his side and still smelling of piss and donkey cum. <br />
<br />
He opens his mouth to sigh and all that comes out is a long &quot;Hhhhaaaaaaaaaaawwwwww&quot;. Sick of being depressed and helpless, he decides to try to regain his feet. But he can&#39;t see anything. He is entirely blind. In his human form, he would be able to see. It would be dark, but he wouldn&#39;t be totally blind like he is now. <br />
<br />
He lifted his heavy-set head by his elongated neck to attempt to take a look around. He looked back across his prone body, back into his bedroom. There, he can make out a little bit of lighter gray. That lighter gray would be the green readout of his bedside clock. He cannot see the numbers, of course. He just sees a faint rectangle of lighter gray than the surrounding blackness. The chronivac&#39;s monitor had long since went into power-saving mode.<br />
<br />
He blinks a couple of times, and attempts to raise his right arm to rub his weary eyes. But then quickly discovers it&#39;s not an arm, but rather a very limited donkey leg. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhhhhaaaaaawwwww,&quot; he sighed outward again. <br />
<br />
&quot;I keep forgetting what I am and what I am not able to do!&quot; he silently thinks to himself. &quot;This REALLY sucks to be trapped as an animal like this.&quot; <br />
<br />
This round of thoughts started making him horny. Again! He quickly pushes that to the back of his mind. This time his curiosity (and the god aweful stench!) was getting the better of his powerful jackass-sized male testosterone. He was curious about what that light gray rectangle was, and he desperately wanted to get into his bathroom to see if he is able to manipulate the shower. <br />
<br />
But first thing&#39;s first. He had to figure out how to get back onto his feet. He began to try getting up like a human again, but quickly stopped himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;That isn&#39;t going to work, I don&#39;t arms or hands!&quot; This thought caused a stirring in his gigantic donkey dick.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Damn! Why&#39;s this thing always doing this!?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhhhaaaawwwww,&quot; he sighs outwardly for the third time. &quot;Time to get back to work,&quot; he thinks to himself. <br />
<br />
And so, he begins to try to right himself. He feels stiff all over his body from lying in the same position for he didnt know how many hours, and he&#39;s a fat ass. Literally. A fat ass! He chuckled inwardly at that bit of literal and figurative language. Again, his dick stirred a bit more at that still-frightening thought. <br />
<br />
He began to rock himself back and forth. To attempt to get his forelegs under himself. But try as me might, he kept failing. And with each effort, he was forced to bray.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Eeeerrggghhh hhhhwwww.&quot; Deep breath and kick out with 4 legs that end in hard shiny hooves. &quot;Eeeerrggghhh hhhaaawwww.&quot; Deep breath and leg kick &quot;Eeerrrrrggghhh hhhaaaaww.&quot; And so on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, damn! How do real donkeys get up from lying on their side? Surely they must now and then,&quot; remembering that they typically sleep while standing. But still sure there were times when donkeys lay out on their side. &quot;Even the fat uncoordinated ugly ones like me must be able to do it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Getting physically tired from his efforts, he stops to take a breather and to think. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my forelegs aren&#39;t arms,&quot; he correctly thinks. &quot;Maybe if I….&quot;<br />
<br />
And before he finishes that thought, he takes his left HIND leg forward, then bends it at the knee. He uses his left foreleg to propel his upper body upward a bit. It was JUST enough for him to get his left HIND leg under himself. Then using it like a spring, he lifts his giant fat rump upwards, and immediately swings his right hind leg underneath himself. With his rump sticking straight up in the air, giant puckered ass sticking out crowned by a tail, he is then able to use his front legs to get underneath his upper body! <br />
<br />
FINALLY! Yet another major victory! A victory that should not have been &quot;major,&quot; but a rather ordinary routine task without any thought whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Looking back into his room, he spots that gray rectangle, now at a lower angle. He backs himself back into his room and swings his enormous body around to insvestigate. But as he does so, he hears a couple of &quot;snaps!&quot; that sounded like wood splintering. For that&#39;s actually what happened. His big clumsy hooves stepped directly on top of broken doorframe pieces, a door, and floor boards. He barely felt it through his useless solid hunks of keratin at the ends of all four of his feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; was his thought. &quot;Hhhhhhaaaawwwww,&quot; he sighed.<br />
<br />
Well, the most important task at hand was going to that gray rectangle once and for all. He saw it on the other side of where he knew his bed should be. Now facing the wall opposite of his doorway; the wall that contains his single bedroom window; he turns a bit more to his right to walk towards the foot of his bed. Before he got very far, he &quot;BANGED!&quot; his large heavy head on the wall, knocking a picture frame off. &quot;HAAAAWWWWW!&quot; he exclaimed in pain rather than say &quot;OOOOOWWWWW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Backing up a couple of inches, he swings to his left to face where his window should be. He then begins to clop his way forward. He very quickly runs into the foot of his bed and stumbles.<br />
<br />
&quot;DAMMIT!&quot; &quot;Eeerrrrrggghhh hhhaaaaww!&quot; &quot;I can&#39;t see!&quot; &quot;Eeerrrrrggghhh HHHHAAAWWWWW eerrrgghh hhhhaawww!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Crap! I can&#39;t talk either!&quot; &quot;Eeeerrggghhh hhhaawwww eeeerrggghhh HHHHAAAWWWWW,&quot; with frustration building once again; and therefore, his dick beginning to get stiff again.<br />
<br />
He then thinks about turning on his light. Normally, he uses the light on the little table where his clock sits. But that&#39;s useless. Luckily, he has a ceiling light with the switch on the wall to the right of his door inside his room. He should be able to manage to turn it on with relative ease. It&#39;s just a simple flick of the switch. But then again, nothing has turned out to be &quot;simple.&quot; Not with this obnoxious foreign body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who the hell designs animals this way anyways,&quot; he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Facing his bed, he very clumsily turned himself back around to face the doorway. His useless cloppers splintering more broken pieces of wood. His sharpened hearing makes him wince everytime he hears another piece splinter. <br />
<br />
Now he&#39;s facing the hallway once again; or where he thinks the hallway should be. Carefully probing with his front hooves in front of him, he inches his way forward. Eventually, he &quot;TAPS&quot; his hoof on a wall. This must be the wall where his door is located. He begins to try to find the opening, but eventually runs into his bed again. Now he&#39;s thoroughly confused. Without being able to see anything, he has no idea what his location is even inside his own bedroom! <br />
<br />
He then gets the bright idea to look around for that gray rectangle. He spots it to his right. Ok, so if he saw that rectangle &quot;behind&quot; him back when he was lying on his side, and knowing he was in the hallway facing away from his bedroom much earlier, that must mean that his doorway should be along the wall to his left!<br />
<br />
Again, using his hoof; his left front hoof; as a guide to carefully maneuver himself to the corner of the room where his closet door is located, all he has to do is turn himself to the left to properly face the wall that his door is on. Very quickly, he hears a hollower &quot;TAP!&quot; as his left front hoof taps on his closet door. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haawww!&quot; he declares in satisfaction.<br />
<br />
So he then slowly turned himself around to the left, being very careful to use his front legs tapping against the wall as a guide. Eventually, found the opening where his door outta be. He slid a couple more inches to his left where he figured out where the hollow space of his doorway was. Then using his left hoof, he finds the right hand side of his door frame. Well, his wall, actually. As his entire doorframe has been shattered. <br />
<br />
He shifted himself slightly to the right. And slightly more to the right. He carefully extended his head forward, until he felt the wall brush his tall donkey ears. Lifting his head up a bit, he slowly moves his head several inches forward. Nearly a foot. (Donkeys have tall ears. VERY tall ears, and Jeff is currently no exception. So when he felt the wall with the tip of his ears, he had to move his head nearly a foot forward to lightly touch the top of his head to the wall.)<br />
<br />
He then begins to raise his head until his long donkey snout found the wall. Once achieved, he begins to &quot;search&quot; for that damnable light switch. It didn&#39;t take him very long to find it. It was lower down than he expected. His head is higher as a full grown jackass than it was as a small 13 year old boy. But found it he did.<br />
<br />
Sticking is dry cottony donkey tongue out of his large mouth, feeling his huge blocky teeth with it, he begins to lick the wall where he felt the switch. Eventually, he finds it with his tongue and flicks it upward. <br />
<br />
&quot;FLASH!&quot; The ceiling light comes on, momentarily blinding him! <br />
<br />
He opens his eyes back up after shutting them and squinting for a minute or so.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Hhhhhaaaawwwww!&quot; he exclaimed, remembering just how incredibly poor his eyesight was and his complete color blindness. But at least he can see now, even if it the poor eyesight a donkey has. He can take stock of his confusing surroundings now.<br />
<br />
He turned around, clopping and splintering along the way to look at the rest of his room. He looks over and doesn&#39;t see that gray rectangle anymore. He doesn&#39;t see it, because everything else is in different shades of gray and white. The gray rectangle, you&#39;ll remember, was the green glow of his digital clock. But he can&#39;t see the color green anymore. And so, it sorta &quot;blends in&quot; with the rest of his surroundings. <br />
<br />
He could make out the various shapes of objects in his room. His window is a square with pitch black in the middle.<br />
<br />
 &quot;It must be night time; or early morning?&quot; he thinks. <br />
<br />
Hiis doorway is a tall rectangle, also with pitch black beyond the triangular gray that fades to black on the hallway floor beyond where the light shines through his busted door.<br />
<br />
His door! He looked carefully at it and sees it&#39;s not a perfect rectangle! Moving over to investigate, he sees the door itself lying on the floor. Busted in several pieces surrounded by a LOT of splintered wood! His door frame is similary smashed to bits. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrggggghhh hhhaaawwww!!!&quot; He says. Frustratingly irritated with his continued inability to speak! Even a single human sound! <br />
<br />
His dick points straight out with that latest thought. An accusing finger. The only finger on his body! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God!&quot; he heeee haaawwed. He brayed again. And again. Eeerrrgghh hhhaaww eeeerrggghhh haaaww eeerrggghh hhhaaaww, feeling his hormones kicking in overdrive.<br />
<br />
This time, he was going to allow it to happen rather than fight it. Thinking about his predicament; what he is, what he can&#39;t do. Stuck in the body of an obese 750 pound middle-aged smelly jackass rather than his cute clean boyish 13 year old body, he began to encourage his penis and balls to do their duty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Might as well get it over with,&quot; he thought. Eeeerrggghhh hhhaaaww eeeerrggghhh hhhaaawwww.<br />
<br />
And so, he began to buck his hips. But he has no leverage; nothing to hump against. He was reluctant to get back down on the floor to hump himself on his floor. He certainly didn&#39;t want to make a disgusting mess on his bed sheets. He would have to sleep there when he&#39;s back to normal! Just washing the sheets, even knowing that an old fat  jackass released it&#39;s thick gooey batter all over his bed; even if he&#39;s the one who produced it and did it, was gross enough to want to make him vomit. <br />
<br />
But his dick was demanding more and more of his attention. Thinking quickly, the bathtub flashed through his mind! He then went back out into the hallway. And stopped. It was pitch black! Utterly dark! He was blind out there, and somewhere in that inky blackness, was the staircase. He didn&#39;t want to go tumbling down that by accident. He might kill himself. He might die as a donkey. And the body he leaves behind may never change back. His parents might come home and find a dead donkey corpse at the bottom of the staircase, never realizing that was their own son! They&#39;d wonder what a dead donkey was doing in their house. They would then go through the house to find him and discover his bedroom is all busted up. They wouldn&#39;t find him. They would call the police and report him missing with a broken bedroom and a dead donkey somehow in their home. They would go out to search for him and obviously never find him, for his body would be literally right under their noses, recognizeable as &quot;only a donkey.&quot; They would declare him missing, and eventually dead. And nobody would be the wiser that dead creature was Jeff all along! It would be the mystery of the century!<br />
<br />
What a wierd string of thoughts! Shaking his head, he knew he had to proceed. At least, he had the very strong desire to do so. He decided upon using the same technique he used in his bedroom in the dark to find his light switch. He would move very carefully with his front hooves, using the mental map of his house&#39;s layout as a guide of where to next slide his front hooves. Using his hooves like how a blind man uses his cane. <br />
<br />
The upstairs common bathroom is at the opposite end of the hallway from his room. The staircase is to the right, halfway between the two rooms. His parents&#39; master bedroom is on the left, also halfway between his room and the bathroom.<br />
<br />
He carefully proceeded forward. He wanted to keep as straight as possible without accidently turning himself around blindly. At least he could use the gray angular rectangle behind him from where his room is located as a guide if he does get disoriented. <br />
<br />
Eventually, he finds the bathroom door. It was much easier than he expected. The very first task that was actually &quot;easy!&quot; But the entire way there, his dick was burning with the desire of attention. <br />
<br />
Doing what he did earlier in the day when he tried opening his bedroom door, he began the search for the bathroom doorknob with his mouth. He quickly found it and was then able to latch his strong jaw with the knob between his teeth. All he had to do was turn his head and push forward. <br />
<br />
Excellent! It swung open with ease! He began to move forward. Then stopped! He tried moving forward again. And again, he was prevented from doing so. The door was too narrow for his huge frame! <br />
<br />
&quot;HHHAAAAAAWWWW!!!!&quot; he exclaimed! Yet ANOTHER obstacle, and yet another reminder of just how obnoxious his body is!<br />
<br />
His dick jumped a couple of times at that thought. Now his hormones are raging. He has no choice. He leans forward as he bends his front legs downward. Down goes his hind legs until he has his huge flopping dick between the floor and his fatty belly.<br />
<br />
There, now he can hump in order to properly milk himself. It didn&#39;t take long. At all. It was again an explosion of colors through his color-starved boy&#39;s brain. And electricity clear around his fat ugly furry body.<br />
<br />
&quot;HHHHHHHAAAAAWWWWWWWW!!!!! he exclaimed!<br />
<br />
He laid there on his belly for a few minutes. &quot;Holy shit, that felt good!&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck am I saying!? I just purposely masturbated as a donkey! FUCKING GROSS!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And yet….and yet….it DID feel good!&quot; <br />
<br />
This was the first time he semi-purposely relieved himself. Because of his position of laying on his belly, he was able to stand up much easier than from his side. As soon as he did so, he got a whiff of that rotting fish! <br />
<br />
Then came the involuntary stream of urine! That completely took him by surprise! His gigantic penis decided to relieve itself a second time of its own accord. This time, of an acidic nature. Then he smelled that same strong ammonia smell. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what that was!&quot; as realization finally dawned on him. &quot;I pissed myself! But when? When I was asleep on my side? I pissed myself and lay in it all this time!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeeerrggghhh hhhaawwww eeerrrrgghhh hhawww eerrrgghhh hhaaaw,&quot; he said disgustedly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fucking GROSS! I need a shower!&quot;<br />
<br />
He tried going through the bathroom door again. But again, he&#39;s too large. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell do I do NOW!? I can&#39;t break down this door. I&#39;m already in a world of trouble when Mom and Dad see the damages I already made. And I don&#39;t have any sort of excuse. Not even an alternative, much less humiliating story I could tell! And how the hell am I supposed to clean up the horrid barnyard smelly bodily mess I left behind? How am I to get the aweful smell out of here!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, those are questions for another time. Right now, he was absolutely desperate for a shower. Well, he can&#39;t use the common bathroom shower. His parents have a bathroom in their master bedroom. And the door to their bedroom would easily fit him with their fancy French doors. As would the bathroom. That&#39;s it then!<br />
<br />
But first, he wanted to shine a bit of light on the subject, so to speak. He wanted to turn on the hallway ceiling light. The light switch is at the top of the staircase to his right and behind him. But that puts up close to the unseen staircase, and the scenario of his dead donkey corpse flashed through his mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck it,&quot; he thought. &quot;I&#39;ll just be careful and do what I did before with my hooves. I&#39;ll just back straight up to my bedroom, then use my forelegs to feel around like I did before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My forelegs,&quot; he thought. This was the first time the thought of his &quot;arms&quot; didn&#39;t automatically come to him. He tried flexing his &quot;fingers&quot; on his right hand again. But of course, no response. It was still just a hoof. Matter of fact, he almost forgot what it felt like to have his fingers freely moving at will. Then he began to feel very restricted again. His useless hooves. He wanted to physically feel his fingers again! <br />
<br />
&quot;At least I&#39;ll have them back at noon tommorrow. This isn&#39;t permanant,&quot; he resigned himself to.<br />
<br />
The thought of having these hooves instead of incredibly useful fingers was a terrifying thought. He pondered briefly just how terrifying it would be knowing he&#39;d never be able to move his arms, hands and fingers ever again. The thought made him horny. AGAIN! <br />
<br />
&quot;What if I am stuck with these hooves and legs, and stuck walking on all fours permantly? What if I can only bray, totally unable to ever communicate with any other human ever again? Not to even mom and dad? What if all people see is just a simple stupid donkey, when it&#39;s really me stuck inside!? Mom and dad would call animal control, totally unaware they are sending me away to an unknown location. I&#39;d  never see me again. They would call the police. They would never have any idea they were looking at me when they discovered my permanent donkey self in the house.&quot;<br />
<br />
He got back down on his belly, and began humping to these unbidden thoughts. These terrifying unbidden thoughts. As he was humping, he decided to test his body. How incapable it was. He tried opening and closing his fingers on both hands in his mind. Wouldn&#39;t work physically. He tried to talk. &quot;Eeeerrggghhh hhhaaaww eeeerrggghhh hhhaaww.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t speak. I don&#39;t have fingers! I can&#39;t play on my computer! I have to use my mouth with my huge blocky teeth to open doors! I&#39;m just an animal! I&#39;m a donkey! A donkey! A DONKEY!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
He tried to say what was on his mind outloud. But his unpliable mouth, lips, and worst of all, vocal cords refused to cooperate. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrrrrggghhh hhhaaaaww. Eeeerrggghhh hhhaaawwww! Eeeerrggghhh hhaaaaww eeerrrgghh hhhaaww! Eeerrrgghh hhaaw! Eerrgh haw! Eeerrggghh HHHAAAAAWW!!!!&quot; was all he was able to manage, desperately unable to break his fingers from out of their prison.<br />
<br />
And he came. This is about the 4th or 5th time he ejaculated. He lost count! He tried counting on his fingers. Knowing full well that he doesn&#39;t have any by now. <br />
<br />
&quot;But sometime tommorrow, I&#39;ll be back to myself. Thank God! Tommorrow? Wonder what the hell time it is anyways?&quot;<br />
<br />
Then his curiosity about this seemingly endless nightmare kicked in. He needed to know….HAD to know….what time it was and how much time was actually left.<br />
<br />
&quot;But first, I&#39;m going to turn on the hallway light.&quot;<br />
<br />
After about 20 more minutes of fumbling around, he finally managed to find the switch and flip it on. Again, the light was blinding. He had to close his eyes and squint. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now. A shower, or try to find out what time it is?&quot;<br />
<br />
He is unaware that it is now quickly approaching midnight, with about 12 hours to go. Halfway there!</p>
