Do not harm dogs (or orcs).</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Junis examined the orc up and down. It took him a moment but he recognized the clothes as belonging to the man who had saved him earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;One second I was sitting next to that disgusting brute,&quot; Lord Marus Highhill explained to anyone listening &quot;Suddenly he was threatening me without provocation! Then he had turned into a filthy orc!&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor looked around curiously wondering what was happening. He went to take another sip from his goblet only to find it empty again. He groaned and demanded more drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep your tusk-face shut green-hide!&quot; the guard ordered, giving him a sharp jab with his spear. &quot;If you know what&#39;s good for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor grunted and smacked the spear aside, the circle of guards started shouting and closing in. Attempting to de-escalate the situation Junis ordered the orc be chained in the courtyard so he could figure out what to do with him later. Danor began to put up a fight, but Junis promised him more meat if he followed the guards. Danor allowed himself to be chained and lead outside and Junis requested the servants to throw him any scraps from the banquet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Staff, get this cleaned up!&quot; Junis ordered gesturing to the place where Danor had sat &quot;If everyone will return to their seats, dessert shall be served shortly. Lord Highhill, Mr Stigins, you have my deepest apologies for tonight&#39;s events, come sit with me and tell of what you witnessed.&quot;<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
By the end of the night Marus Highhill&#39;s tale had grown to tell of a ferocious battle between him and the savage orc; how he had fended him off using only a butter knife and was moments from slaying the beast when the guards intervened. Bolgus Stigins had seized any attention paid him as an opportunity to mention the deal he was discussing when the events took place in an attempt to acquire more investors.<br />
<br />
Danor had been happily gnawing on bones for several hours when Junis and a group of other fascinated dinner guests approached him where he was chained up in the courtyard. Generally disregard for the state of his clothes as well as growth in both height and thickness meant he was already half naked. A halfling in a dark blue robe stepped forward and began prodding and poking Danor all over while chanting funny words. Danor put up a fuss at first but after being promised some ale, he sat relatively still only fidgeting slightly over the next quarter hour.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like the result of a poorly made transformation potion&quot; the healer sighed after his examination &quot;Without a sample of the original, anything I do could do more harm than good. I might have been able to reverse it before the transformation completed but now that the potion has taken full effect there&#39;s not much I can do. From now on he&#39;ll have the body and mental capability of an orc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Junis thanked the healer and looked at the orc sitting on the ground who was tipping a tankard of ale into his gullet. He wondered how severe the change was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember your name?&quot; Junis asked.<br />
<br />
Danor wiped his mouth on his sleeve and scrunched his face trying to think. &quot;Daah...Cloww...Daaan...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Danor&quot; he offered, thinking it might be better to forgo his last name for now &quot;Do you know who I am?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rich man, live in big house!&quot; Danor answered cheerily &quot;You give Da-or much meat and drink!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you a human or an orc Danor?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor looked at him quizzically &quot;Dar is hoo-man! Orc is dumb, mean and dirty!&quot;<br />
<br />
The crowd muttered around him as Junis took a moment, trying to think of what to do with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Danor, you could stay and work for me if you like,&quot; Junis offered &quot;I&#39;m sure we could find some use for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HA! If you want an orc slave you&#39;re better off buying one at auction!&quot; jeered Marus Highhill.<br />
<br />
&quot;He won&#39;t be my slave,&quot; clarified Junis &quot;He will be trained and educated to regain his humanity. I&#39;m certain it can be done, I&#39;d bet good coin on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
That last line piqued Marus&#39;s interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may have trained many champion horses and hounds Gildvest, but there is no way you could tame this beast to be sophisticated enough to even act as a house servant,&quot; chortled Marus &quot;The only well behaved orc is a collared orc&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not only will he be well behaved,&quot; insisted Junis &quot;when disguised properly you won&#39;t be able to distinguish him from any normal person!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well why not put your money where your mouth is&quot; grinned Marus &quot;A wager! This time next year I shall throw a banquet, guests who wish to participate may bring a servant. If I can not distinguish which servant is yours, you win. If I can, I will win. I will even provide the potion of disguise... unless you think your training is not good enough&quot;<br />
<br />
Gildvest had just been challenged publicly and his inflated sense of pride would not allow him to back down. The next half an hour was spent hashing out details. No magical mind alteration was allowed, an impartial third party approved by both would brew the potion, no magical means of detection as well as a few other protocols in place to prevent cheating. Of course the final choice had to be left to Danor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Danor, you have two options here.&quot; Junis stated, &quot;If you want to live like a human you have to start acting like one. I&#39;ll give you a job here as a servant and train you to speak and behave properly again, you will be able to consume proper food and drink and you will have a place to sleep so long as you are good. Alternatively you can leave here and carry on the way you have, eating, drinking and sleeping in garbage with the rest of the orcs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhhh&quot; Danor sat there slack jawed trying to keep up. Everyone was using too many big words and talking too fast. Junis pinched his temple and explained it back to him in simpler terms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dar want yummy food and ale!&quot; He yelled enthusiastically banging his tankard on the ground when he finally understood. &quot;Dar be good!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well&quot; nodded Junis &quot;First thing&#39;s first. You need a bath.&quot;<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Danor was unshackled and lead down to the servants quarters where they stripped off the rest of his tattered clothing and unceremoniously dumped in a large wooden tub of cold water. The water wasn&#39;t so bad but then the servants started attacking him with brushes. They were scrubbing him all over and he thrashed about trying to stop them.<br />
<br />
&quot;DOWN!&quot; snapped a gruff voice punctuated with a sharp sudden pain on the end of Danor&#39;s nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooowwww&quot; Danor moaned as stopped flailing about to rub the end of his nose. He glared ahead to see a grumpy man holding a long thin stick. &quot;Why hit Dar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hit you like a dog because you we&#39;re acting like a dog&quot; said the man, &quot;My name is Bortam Hardbarc, I am the kennel master of the manor and will be disciplining you when Mr Gildvest is not around to teach you himself. And unlike him I have very little patience for nonsense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor did not like this man, a boiling heat started to rise in his stomach. He clenched his fist ready to lunge when Hardbarc pulled a big dripping juicy steak from the pack on his belt. Danor&#39;s mind immediately switched paths. His hand reached out to grab it but his fingers were met with another sharp whack of Hardbarc&#39;s stick.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Bortam snapped, waving the steak out of reach of Danor &quot;Sit down. When you are a good clean orc, *then* you get a treat. Any arguments and there&#39;ll be no meat for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
After a moment of consideration Danor plopped down with a splash. He begrudgingly picked up a brush, and started scrubbing himself down. Hardbarc ordered one servant to watch him to make sure he washes properly and told the rest to resume their regular duties. For the next few minutes Danor reluctantly scrubbed himself down, with the young man nervously reminding him to get under his armpits and behind his ears. While he didn&#39;t have any problem with being naked, Danor felt oddly vulnerable without the layer of muck covering him. Eventually he had made his way down to his feet and was nearly finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ehhrm...&quot; peeped the servant supervising him, &quot;Don&#39;t forget to wash your...ummm-&quot; he trailed off to a mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Danor grunted confused. &quot;What yoo say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wash your...&quot; the servant, lowered his voice to a whispered &quot;penis...&quot; his eyes glanced down at Danor&#39;s large cold flaccid genitals and quickly averted his gaze, blushing intensely.<br />
<br />
Danor groaned and moved the brush to his groin. He lifted up the dick and started slowly scrubbing his lime sized testicles. Afterwards he began brushing down his shaft and felt a pleasurable tingle shoot through his body. Soon after his penis began enlarging and stiffening. The urge to begin scrubbing harder and faster took over and soon the feeling began to build. It was similar to the boiling heat from earlier, but different. All other thoughts left his mind, and it wasn&#39;t long before he dropped the brush and was vigorously pumping his long thick erection. The servant who had been intent on avoiding having to look at Danor&#39;s obscenely large privates, heard the sound of water splashing out of the tub and turned to witness the sight of a Danor aggressively thrusting his impressive orchood in and out of his dark green fist. It took a moment for him to snap out of his trance before he spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;H-hey!&quot; he bleated &quot;S-stop...&quot;<br />
<br />
The servant was not heard over the thunderous grunting from the orc, preoccupied with pleasuring himself. Eyes shut tight Danor was too fixated on the heat spread through his body like wildfire to pay any attention to anything else happening around him. All the nearby workers had stopped what they were doing when they heard the violent groans of the masturbating orc. Volcanic pressure built up inside his every muscle and fiber. Just as he was moments from exploding a sharp pain cut through his pleasure as a series of pointed blows stung his nose and face.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! NO! NO!&quot; shouted a gruff voice &quot;BAD ORC! YOU DO NOT PERFORM SUCH LEWD ACTS IN THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS!&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor ignored him and powered through roaring into an intense orgasm, erupting his hot orc slime five feet in to the air. What didn&#39;t splatter on his freshly cleaned body plopped into what was left of the water in the tub. Danor was sinking into a peaceful bliss when he was snapped out of his stupor by a hard strike to his penis.<br />
<br />
Danor howled, at the pain, it was unlike any he had felt before. His eyes flew open and he once again saw Hardbarc scowling and yelling at him. Danor moved to stand up and punch the man in the face when Hardback swished his stick again clipping the tip of Danor&#39;s sensitive penis. His body reeled and fell back into the tub as he gave another howl of pain. The boiling heat was rising in him again, grabbed the sides of the tub to push himself back up for retaliation.<br />
<br />
&quot;BAD ORC!&quot; Hardbarc yelled, swiftly striking Danor&#39;s sore penis again before he could react &quot;DOWN!&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor crashed back into the tub as his hands rushed down to clutch his aching penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;No more!&quot; Danor cried, &quot;No more hurty!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay!&quot; Hardback ordered before turning to the nearby servant, &quot;Servant, fetch more water, refill this tub.&quot;<br />
<br />
The stunned young man jumped and rushed to grab buckets, quickly filling the tub to Danor&#39;s belly button. The orc had sat back up but was still protectively holding his sensitive parts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now wash that disgusting orc...fluid off yourself&quot; ordered Hardbarc with his arms crossed. Danor nervously removed his hands from his penis eyeing the stick at Hardbarc&#39;s side and began scrubbing himself down yet again, wiping the gloopy orc semen off himself. After a few minutes he found his way back to his cock and once again felt a fire beginning to burn inside him as he scrubbed it. Despite being somewhat sore it was still pleasurable. Forgetting his task he dropped the brush and once again began to stroke his penis. when he was interrupted by yet another smack on his nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Bad orc!&quot; yelled Hardbarc. &quot;You do not perform such filthy acts in public!&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor rubbed his nose and bowed his head &quot;Sorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was hoping I wouldn&#39;t have to use this,&quot; sighed Hardbarc, pulling a leather strap with strange markings from his pouch &quot;But it looks like you can&#39;t control yourself. Stand up. Hands behind your back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor nervously and pushed himself up, water running off him into the tub. Hardbarc took a tight grip on his penis and Danor gulped worrying he would smack it again. But instead he took the strap and wrapped it once around Danor&#39;s cock and balls and once around the base of his cock fastening it. Danor looked down and rubbed at his groin but instead of the usual good feeling an unpleasant shock ran across his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Owwwww&quot; moaned Danor. He looked up to see Hardbarc holding small stone tablet.<br />
<br />
&quot;None of that nonsense. That collar is normally used to stop dogs scratching their ears, but now whenever you touch your penis inappropriately, or I activate this rune stone you&#39;ll get a sharp reminder to behave. Don&#39;t try to remove it either, that&#39;ll just make things worse&quot; Hardbarc explained. &quot;Now back to cleaning, if you&#39;re not completely spotless in five minutes you&#39;ll be getting another shock.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor sat back in the tub and scrubbed himself intensely. He felt his cock go hard again when he rubbed the brush against it but resisted against pulling himself again. Hardbarc nodded with approval as Danor stood up to be inspected.<br />
<br />
&quot;There that wasn&#39;t so hard now was it?&quot; smirked Hardbarc, reaching into his pouch.<br />
<br />
Danor&#39;s eyes widened as Hardbarc pulled out the juicy steak again and tossed it at him. Danor snatched it out of the air and began tearing into the tender meat with his teeth. Hardbarc walked over and scratched Danor behind the ear as he savored the delicious steak. &quot;Good boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
The next day the servants provided Danor with a large simple robe while he waited for nice clothes to be made in his new size. The young man (who&#39;s name was Hoskel but Danor called him Hosk) was tasked with showing him how to do basic chores and tasks. After knocking over a vase while sweeping the floor, tearing the laundry he tried to wash and eating a quater of the ingredients meant for the night&#39;s stew (he would have ate more if Hardbarc had not caught him and given him a shock), they set Danor to chopping firewood. Some time in the afternoon Mr Gildvest approached the grinning Danor in the yard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Danor, come with me,&quot; Junis requested &quot;its time for your speaking and reading lessons.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor ignored him and gave another amused giggle as he split another log in two, sending the pieces flying.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s very rude to ignore others Danor,&quot; scolded Junis &quot;Now come with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The orc gleefully picked up another log and placed it on the chopping block before responding &quot;Dar like cut wood! Dar stay!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a shame, I guess I&#39;ll have to eat these mutton chops all on my own.&quot; Junis said, as he pulled one out of a pouch.<br />
<br />
The smell drifted over to Danor&#39;s nostrils. His attention was caught and he dropped the ax when he saw the meat dangling from the rich man&#39;s hand and rushed over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh uh uh,&quot; Junis smiled, putting away the mutton chop, &quot;not until you&#39;ve finished your lesson. Now are you going to be good and come with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor&#39;s face fell when the taste meat vanished from sight but nodded eagerly. &quot;Yes Dar be good for rich man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you speak to me you refer to me as Mister Gildvest&quot; Junis instructed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Misser Gillva...Mistee Goldvers&quot;<br />
<br />
Junis sighed &quot;Ok just call me sir for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir!&quot;<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Soon Danor&#39;s head was aching with all sorts of new things to remember. Mr Gildvest fed him a nibble every time he did something right like managing to count to five or learning to pronounce &quot;Danor&quot; correctly. It took several days before he had learned to drop the worst orcish speaking habits. However it did not come easy, many tantrums were thrown when something was too difficult for him to understand or when he kept pulling off clothes because they were too confining. But after a few visits from Mr Hardbarc they were able to get the rambunctious orc to settle with just the mention of the kennel master. That was until the fifth day after his transformation.<br />
<br />
Hoskel was teaching Danor how to properly make the beds. Danor had not ejaculated since the first night at Gildvest manor and was getting very frustrated. His penis was hard all the time and pushing against the front of his new trousers making a sizable lump. Every time he reached inside to touch it he got another sharp zap which dissuaded him from going further. Hoskel was showing him how to make the sheets flat, Danor stretched over the mattress to even it out when his throbbing bulge rubbed up against the edge. A small flame ignited inside him and this time was not extinguished by a painful shock. Danor moved forward again and the flame burst into a roaring fire. Before Hoskel could stop him Danor was on top of the mattress vigorously humping the pillow.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-stop! Mister Hardbarc is goi-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;RAAAARGH&quot; Danor roared loudly enough for the entire manor to hear. He paused briefly to tear apart the front of his trousers exposing his monster erection, before resuming his pillow fuck.<br />
<br />
In a few minutes Mister Hardbarc had burst through the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;What t-&quot; Mr Hardbarc stumbled &quot;NO UNACCEPTABLE! STOP!&quot; He reached down and activated the shock collar. Danor felt a painful jolt through his body but it was not enough to stop him. He kept thrusting harder and harder as Hardbarc set the collar to full power. However Danor&#39;s sexual desires were not abated. Hardbarc started smacking every inch he could find on the orc who was pumping his large cock in an out of the fluffy pillow, with feathers flying everywhere. Hoskel was staring transfixed on the scene subtly rubbing his own stiffening penis. Soon Danor was ejaculating powerfully into Mr Gildvest&#39;s pillow. Five days worth of thick orc spunk overflowed onto the fresh sheets.<br />
<br />
As Danor&#39;s humping died down his pleasure was suddenly replaced by intense pain. He finally noticed the collar sending a shock through his cock and balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;UU---AHHH AHHH NOOOO&quot; He cried &quot;STOoooop!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! This is your punishment!&quot; yelled Mr Hardbarc &quot;This is what happens when you don&#39;t obey orders!&quot;<br />
<br />
At this moment Junis burst through the doors of his bedroom to the scene of his kennel master whipping the orc writhing around on his bed while in the corner one of his servants swiftly put his hands behind his back thinking that no one  saw him rubbing himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on here!?&quot;<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm an admirable effort Mr Hardbarc,&quot; noted the halfling in blue who was examining the orc&#39;s once again erect penis &quot;but I think you&#39;re going about this the wrong way. Orcs have very intense sexual drives, almost as important as their need for food, their genitalia are practically vital organs. If the city didn&#39;t force orc taverns and shelters to segregate by gender, they would multiply like rabbits. Thankfully they seem to view every hole as equally viable so they don&#39;t complain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what should we do?&quot; asked Junis.<br />
<br />
&quot;A strange problem usually solved by a slave collar. But since you can&#39;t use one I recommend you take the opposite approach of your current method,&quot; suggested the healer &quot;Males of other species who masturbate too hard or too frequently can find themselves with loss of erectile function in their penises as well as lowered libido. The same concept could applied to your orc, however what may seem like excessive amounts of sexual activity to a human might not mean as much to the orc physiology. I can provide a device that will milk him for hours or even days at a time to weaken his sexual drive. I recommend three days straight at first, then eight hours a day for a month, with another twenty four hour session each week. We&#39;ll be able to adjust his treatment from there, possibly only needing long sessions if he acts up again..&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor did not understand all the big words being thrown around stood there glad that the shock collar was finally off, not knowing what was to come.<br />
<br />
One day later Danor was chained up in the garden shed. They had moved him out of the servant&#39;s quarters on his third night when no one could sleep due to his snoring. Of course Danor was happy to be given &quot;his own house&quot; as they called it. The short man in blue adjusted a strange etched tube over Danor&#39;s large penis and muttered a few words. It began to glow and Danor felt a wonderful sensation in his groin. He enjoyed it very much even if he could not buck or hump, secured tightly as he was to his bed with enchanted chains. Hoskel was tasked with keeping an eye on him as well as feeding him and cleaning him.<br />
<br />
The first ten minutes were wonderful, the sheath stoked the fire inside Danor&#39;s body, making it larger and larger until his large penis erupted with ecstasy all over his stomach. However the sheath did not stop as his orgasm abated. It continued to pull on Danor&#39;s penis and the heat inside him started to rise again. Hoskel watched and sat in the corner out of sight idly rubbing at his own bulge.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tube good!&quot; Danor smiled &quot;Danor like!&quot;<br />
<br />
Three hours later Danor was not so sure. His penis was beginning to ache from the excessive milking and the sensation was growing less pleasurable and more painful with each orgasm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Danor have enough tube&quot; he moaned &quot;Can Hosk stop tube now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Danor, I don&#39;t know how to stop it&quot; Hosk apologized &quot;You&#39;ll just have be tough for sixty nine more hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor who did not know how to count that high just nodded &quot;Ok, Danor will be tougher!&quot;<br />
<br />
Six hours and fifteen orgasms later Danor had completely changed his opinion of the tube. His penis was sore and tender, yet the device kept pumping away vigorously on his cock despite the fact it was now completely soft.<br />
<br />
&quot;No- No more! Danor want stop!&quot; he cried. &quot;Tube bad! Hosk help!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry Danor, I can&#39;t,&quot; sighed Hoskel as he wiped away the orc&#39;s sweat and semen. &quot;Mister Gildvest says it&#39;s for your own good&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NoooOO! Danor Sorry! Danor be good! Danor be good! Danor be goood!&quot; he cried, as the sheath continued pumping away well into the night.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
It had been a long year of blood, sweat and tears but the day was finally here.<br />
<br />
Danor chugged down the potion and felt his form shrink. His clothes became looser and blond hair began to sprout from his head. His hard thick green muscle turned into soft pale flesh. Soon his trousers began to slip and his modest pink penis was briefly exposed before Danor covered himself. When the transformation was complete Danor had turned into a slightly pudgy human male, similar to Hoskel&#39;s age. Danor even managed to fit into one of his old outfits before he headed for Highhill Manor.<br />
<br />
Twenty other servants besides Danor had been brought by other guests who had made personal bets amongst themselves, of who had the best trained staff. They assembled at Highhill castle two hours before the banquet to learn their duties. Danor easily picked up what his duties were for the night and had a good layout of the area by the time the party started.<br />
<br />
Each servant wore a numbered patch. At the end of the night Lord Highhill would chose the best servant who could not possibly be the orc, and attempt to guess who the orc was. If he did not pick out the orc within three guesses he would pay Mr Gildvest one thousand gold pieces, if he did Mr Gildvest would pay him six thousand gold pieces. Furthermore If Lord Highhill inadvertently chose Danor as the best servant he would pay Mr Gildvest an additional five thousand gold. To provide an incentive for servants to be on their best behavior, the top servant would be granted fifty gold and his employer a reward of five hundred gold.<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the night the servants were set to serve appetizers and pour drinks before the banquet. Lord Highhill had an orc body guard wearing a slave collar beside him all night for protection, in case Danor went wild. Highhill spent the evening either nitpicking everything wrong with each servant&#39;s presentation and demeanor or giving very complicated orders to test them.<br />
<br />
When it came time for Danor to fill Highhill&#39;s drink he stopped him. &quot;Not that bottle, please fetch me a vintage Dlor Bur from the wine cellar. It&#39;s on the third shelf, eighteenth bottle from the left or was it the nineteenth... well if your tiny brain can count that high I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be able to read the label.&quot; he smirked. Danor who had endured much worse provocation from Hardbarc simply nodded and went to fetch the bottle. When he returned Highhill was speaking with a disgruntled old halfling holding a platter of fancy pastries.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to make sure that my guests have had a taste, please return when you have precisely fifteen salmon puffs remaining... if it doesn&#39;t hurt your head to remember&quot; ordered Lord Highhill, before turning to see Danor with the bottle he requested. As Danor poured the wine gracefully into the goblet, a mischievous grin spread across Highhill&#39;s face, &quot;You there! number twelve!&quot; A tall man holding a platter with small chunks of garnished meat on tooth picks walked over.<br />
<br />
&quot;I simply can&#39;t resist these lamb skewers, they are far too succulent,&quot; Highhill commented as he picked one off the platter, and waved it under their noses &quot;Would either of you care to try one?&quot;<br />
<br />
The tall servant, unsure if it was rude to refuse a lord&#39;s offer decided to pick one off the plate, thanked him and praised his tastes.<br />
<br />
Danor very much wanted one, but he remembered the hours of training he had been through not to eat until he was given permission from his master. &quot;Thank you my Lord, you are too kind, but I must refuse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lord Highhill huffed and waved the two servants away, popping the tasty morsel in his mouth.<br />
<br />
The night continued with Highhill insulting and testing each and every servant. By the time desert was coming around Highhill still was not completely sure who was the orc but had one more trick up his sleeve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm how about some entertainment,&quot; Highhill turned to his orc slave &quot;Dance for our guests.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lorp no da-&quot; The orc stopped short as the green gem on his silver collar turned red with the swipe of a small stone in Highhill&#39;s hand. The orc&#39;s face went blank and he began jumping and spinning around the room. Many of the guests found it highly entertaining. When the orc had made a full circuit around the hall and returned Highhill gave another order. &quot;Now, strip down for our amusement.&quot;<br />
<br />
The orc continued to prance around the room, now slowly removing items of clothing. Soon he was completely nude and his large green cock was flopping around. Highhill looked closely at each servant to observe their reactions. He knew orcs had an insatiable lust and were unable to resist the lure of another orc. Most of the room were either laughing uncontrollably at the ridiculous display or simply disgusted, however Highhill&#39;s eyes beaded in on one servant in particular who was mesmerized by the scene; A rather pudgy young man so enraptured by the performance that the goblet of wine he was filling overflowed, spilling onto one of the guests. He was jerked out of his stupor and began apologizing up and down as the guest berated him. As he rushed off to get some napkins he was interrupted by the twirling orc blocking his path and his eyes were locked onto his swinging cock. After a moment the orc passed and the man shook himself to his senses once more and continued along. Lord Highhill kept his eye on him and saw the young man pausing at to take several deep breaths at the edge of the room. When he thought no one was looking he made several side glances at the dancing orc, adjusting his crotch frequently but otherwise making no overtly lewd actions.<br />
<br />
After desert was finished everyone returned to the drawing room for more drinks. Soon it came time for Lord Highhill to make his decision.<br />
<br />
Highhill&#39;s eyes combed the room. Number eight was one of the few servants who managed to remain stoic and expressionless throughout the night&#39;s treatment. &quot;Number eight, You&#39;re service and manner was exemplary this evening, please step forward.&quot; The portion of the crowd that lost wagers groaned as the man with an eight patched to his shirt stepped forward and took a humble bow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent choice Lord Highhill, I myself would not have chosen differently&quot; complimented Junis, &quot;But you have less than three minutes left. Which one of these fine servants is my orc?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmph well it&#39;s obvious to anyone...&quot; Highhill&#39;s eyes darted about from servant to servant and his eyes landed on the wiry old halfling who had been glowering half the night and pointed at him, &quot;Clever trick hiding him as a halfling Gildvest, but not clever enough to fool me! His face says it all, number nineteen!&quot;<br />
<br />
The halfling&#39;s glower only intensified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apologies Lord Highhill, but that is incorrect&quot; smiled Junis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well of course, it would be no fun to get it right on the first try,&quot; evaded Highhill who went back to scanning the room and spotting the man who had eaten the appetizer, &quot;Because the orc is obviously the one who couldn&#39;t resist stuffing his face, number twelve!&quot;<br />
<br />
The tall man grimaced, he had just lost his employer quite a bit of money by being picked and knew he would not be pleased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Lord Highhill, incorrect again, you have one more guess.&quot; Junis replied, hiding a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just trying to make it exciting for everyone,&quot; assured Highhill, looking around desperately. He spotted the large man who had spilled the wine. &quot;Of course, I&#39;ve known all along, it&#39;s the clumsy lummox, who was barely able to keep his privates to himself during that green-hide&#39;s lewd display. Number three!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone turned to face the somewhat dumpy young man who was blushing deeply and attempting to stutter our a denial. Fortunately his embarrassment was cut short when servant number eight fell to the floor and began to convulse. Slowly the his body started to expand. His fine clothes tore at the seams, his soft fat pads hardened into bulky muscle. His pale skin darkened and took on a emerald hue. Two tusks expanded from the bottom of his mouth. In under a minute his garments were in complete tatters and where once stood a clean and proper servant now laid a large naked orc on the floor.<br />
<br />
There was a gasp followed by a chuckle throughout the room, and mutterings of people insisting they knew all along. Some patted Junis on the back and congratulated him while other begrudgingly handed over gold from side wagers they had made. Lord Highhill was flustered but attempted to remain graceful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very impressive Mister Gildvest,&quot; nodded Highhill &quot;you have certainly earned your six thousand gold pieces. Come let us have another round of drinks you can tell tale of how you tamed this beast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; agreed Mr Gildvest barely able to contain a wide grin &quot;Good job Danor I&#39;m very proud of you, go to my carriage, I&#39;ve brought spare clothes for you. Wait for me in the courtyard.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the guests chattered excitedly amongst themselves and the servants left the room to bring more drinks to their personal employers, Danor made his way to the carriage by the gate, pleased he had managed to make Mr Gildvest so proud of him. He found his orc clothes neatly folded on the carriage seat and dressed himself, making sure all the laces were tied neatly. As he finished doing up his buttons he heard a snort. Lord Highhill&#39;s orc was leaning on a nearby tree with his arms crossed glaring at Danor.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing out here?&quot; Danor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master say &#39;Lorp upset guests.&#39;&quot; he responded &quot;Lorp stand outside with other orc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor frowned &quot;I am not an orc.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Dar hoo-man then?&quot; Lorp growled. &quot;They let Dar eat and sleep with other hoo-man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have my own house in the garden.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh like dog house?&quot; laughed Lorp.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does they listen to what Dar say? Does they care what Dar think?&quot; continued Lorp &quot;Or do they just tell Dar what to do and Dar do. Make him play dress up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re doing what Highhill says.&quot; Danor argued. &quot;Wearing what he makes you wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lorp is forced to be slave.&quot; Lorp snarled tugging on the silver collar around his neck where the gem was currently glowing amber, &quot;One day Lorp free orc. Lorp spit on master. Dar can leave now. But Dar stay. Even if Dar not speak how he want. Dar not fight who he want. Dar not fuck what he want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dar-I am beyond that now!&quot; Danor spoke, raising his voice, &quot;I do not need to succumb to lowly orc desires!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Dar not orc,&quot; Lorp sneered &quot;But Dar not hoo-man. Dar is pet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danor clenched his fists feeling a low simmering urge to punch Lorp. As he tried to resolve this strange familiar feeling inside himself someone called out his name from behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Danor, there you are! Come along, we&#39;re heading home.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned to see Junis standing at the gate with a small chest under his arm and a big smile on his face. Danor pushed down his anger, turned away from Lorp and boarded the carriage. As the horses began to trot Junis praised Danor for being so well behaved. His master handed over a pouch containing the fifty gold pieces Danor had won for being the best servant and allowed him the next few days off as an extra reward. Danor thanked him but spent the rest of the ride home fuming in silence. Junis hardly seemed to notice.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Instead of relaxing, Danor used the next few days to see if he could step out into the world on his own. No one was willing to hire an orc servant regardless of how well trained he was, and most laughed when they discovered he expected human pay. He eventually took a loading and unloading job at the docks to see if he was capable and found a cheap inn to stay at in the mean time. However he found he didn&#39;t like sleeping without his soft warm bed, he didn&#39;t like eating left over rotten scraps and he didn&#39;t like lifting things all day long for very little coin.<br />
<br />
The frustrations were heating up with no avenue for release. On his last night off he went to an orc tavern to see if orc fighting was all it was chalked up to be. The tavern was loud, violent and disgusting. Danor could not understand half of what was happening, but it wasn&#39;t long before another orc locked eyes with him for too long. Danor threw a punch but was on the ground and begging for mercy in under a minute. His opponent stopped pummeling him, and aggressively began attempting to remove Danor&#39;s trousers. Danor scrambled away and ran off crying, chased out by boos from the crowd.<br />
<br />
That night he bought a large cask of ale with the gold he had won and shuffled his way back to his shed at Gildvest manor. After locking himself in he poured tankard after tankard, drinking throughout the night. Around his seventh or so drink in under an hour he was starting to feel agitated by a tingle he hadn&#39;t felt in a long time stirring in his groin. His palm reached down and felt his soft thick orc cock. Soon he began rubbing up and down slowly trying to get it hard, but even though it felt good there was no response. He started tugging on it vigorously trying to release his pent up frustrations. The intense flame he once felt roaring through his body was now no more than a dying ember unable to ignite. It took an hour of intense pulling on his flaccid shaft before he managed to force a few thick dribbles of cum to spill out of his fat floppy dick. While it alleviated some of the heat he felt inside, it didn&#39;t do much to improve his mood. Danor crawled into a ball under his blanket and tried to sleep, hoping the master would feed him something nice tomorrow to make him feel better.<br />
<br />
Danor was not a happy orc.</p>
