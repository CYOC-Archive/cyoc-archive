<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first instinct of all of them was to deny what it was they were hearing. But as Tanya and Diana considered how Lucy would have no reason to lie, nor would make jokes about such a thing, and Jennifer and Felicity didn&#39;t believe their new friend was the sort to make up such things, they each stewed over of what it meant upon hearing Natalie&#39;s profile had vanished.<br />
<br />
Full implications setting in, Tanya and Diana both considered what it&#39;d mean for them. Whilst Diana considered she might be upset, as well as a touch sad, to be stuck for the rest of her life as a cat, she also decided she might not mind after a period of adjustment, Tanya, on the other hand, was horrified at the prospect she could become trapped in her current form. Frightened by the notion of being forever stuck as a plush toy, which she still didn&#39;t know yet how to make herself move, she felt, if she could’ve, she&#39;d have started crying by now. Trying to keep her emotions in check, and failing, Tanya telepathically sent { Lucy }<br />
<br />
Upon hearing her friend&#39;s thought, she looked away from the computer. Still shocked by what she saw, it took her a moment before it registered her friend was asking something. Blinking, shaking her head, she croaked out, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, what?&quot;<br />
<br />
{ I asked if it were possible to cancel my transformation } { to revert me back to being who I used to be } Tanya thought.<br />
<br />
A slow nod from Lucy, muttered, “Let’s see,” and turning back to the Chronivac, she pulled up Tanya&#39;s profile. Aware of her friend&#39;s emotions, as they came through whenever the girl psychically sent her messages, Lucy tried to send soothing sensations to the plush as she searched through the information. Discovering after some time a way to cancel the current transformation, and timer, and revert the subject back, she pointed this out to Tanya, then asked, &quot;Are you sure this something you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
If she could&#39;ve, she would have leapt at the computer and made it do as Lucy said it could do. But, unable to, Tanya thought { yes }<br />
<br />
Ready to do as her friend asked, Lucy glanced at Diana. Still held by Jennifer, she wondered how best to communicate with her. Deciding the simplest way was to ask, and hope her friend understood and could respond in a way which made it clear what she wanted, Lucy inquired, &quot;Do you want me to change you back right now as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
To all of their surprise, Diana perked her head up. Fastening sapphire blue eyes on Lucy, she shook her head in what they all took to be her saying she didn&#39;t. Seeing this, Lucy was about to initiate the programme and have it revert Tanya, but stopped when Felicity, who, after discovering Natalie&#39;s things had vanished, had set the plush back on the desk, exclaimed, &quot;Wait,&quot; and when everyone looked at her, she grinned sheepishly, reached for Tanya and set her on the floor, explaining as she did, &quot;Probably wouldn&#39;t do any good to have her morph whilst sitting on the desk.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Lucy and Jennifer saw the logic in this, whilst Diana was indifferent and Tanya, who’d overlooked the detail until now, was grateful someone had realised this. Turning her full attention to the computer, Lucy began entering information to cancel the timer, revert the subject to their previous form, and make so the only ones who&#39;d be aware of the change were those in the room. Double-checking to make sure everything was all right, and clicking a few things she noticed had shifted the way they weren’t supposed to, Lucy saved the new data and hit initiate.<br />
<br />
From where she sat on the floor, Tanya wasn&#39;t sure what would happen, let along transform first. Suddenly aware she could actually feel things, she decided it was a bit weird to still have a plush body as first her nerves and nerve endings reformed, then her batting morphed to become all the normal stuff inside her human body. The brain the last of the things to reappear, her faux fur regressed as fast her floppy ears, and as skin and the usual human body replaced the plush hide, she started to increase in size and weight. Sprouting across her head in patches, her hair began to grow back in as her hands, fingers, toes and feet lost the appearance of being stitched things to resemble paws, and stretching as she lost the look of an object made to look as it was sitting, Tanya couldn&#39;t help but giggle when her stitched mouth vanished and her lips reappeared and split.<br />
<br />
Muzzle flattened out and her mouth and nose separated. As this occurred, her face took on its normal feminine appearance, and within moments, everyone in the room was staring at a naked girl of nine with a plush tail, which was rapidly receding. Her change finishing, Tanya again stretched, then, reaching for her clothes, she commented, &quot;I would never, ever recommend anyone doing that. It was horrifying most of the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shared looks passed between Lucy, Jennifer, and Felicity as the girl dressed herself. Finishing, they all crowded around the computer and stared at the screen. Wondering what had happened to Natalie, and why her profile had vanished from the software, Lucy absently saved and closed Tanya&#39;s profile and pulled up Diana&#39;s information. Seeing there was still about forty-one minutes left before she reverted back, she glanced at the others and asked, &quot;So what are we going to do about Natalie. We cannot just forget her, even if it looks as if she&#39;d been erased?&quot; and upon hearing this, Felicity gasped, turned, and ran from the room.<br />
<br />
The instant this happened, Tanya enquired, &quot;What was that all about,&quot; as Jennifer said, &quot;I know it&#39;s upsetting what happened, but I don&#39;t feel as if there is any call for running away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t run away,&quot; Felicity announced as she came back into the room, and closed the door, she furthered with, &quot;I went to check something, and discovered, it isn&#39;t just with the Chronivac Natalie’s been removed, but also from the world as well, as her stuff she brought with her for the sleep over is no longer in Lucy&#39;s room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silence greeted this before Jennifer, Tanya, and Felicity all began talking at once, Lucy stood and went to see for herself, and coming back, she sat back down in the chair. Listening to the others, how they each wanted to do something, with the general consensus being they ought to find a way to get the Chronivac to undo what it&#39;d done, &quot;Much like how it did for me,&quot; Tanya stated at one point, it was Lucy who pointed out, &quot;That&#39;s not possible. You still had a profile, information. Everything about Natalie is gone,&quot; and the truth sinking in, everyone went silent at the same time. Peering at each other, it was Felicity who eventually said, &quot;So what are we going to do? I mean, we tampered with something we should’ve have left alone, and now someone’s missing, a friend we’re the only ones to remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing offered right away, each person let this sink in even more as they each tried to come up with a solution to bring Natalie back. After a moment, another one of those feelings coming to Felicity, she put forth, &quot;Can the Chronivac roll back the time? And if it can, perhaps we can go back to a point before Natalie made her transformation?&quot; even as she felt it could, and, somehow, had already been used to do as she inquired.</p>
