<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>Greg and Andy just stood there, feeling as if things were going to change on them more. A tingling sensation, like a small flow of added electricity, coursed through every part of their bodies. They began to get hotter, then it stopped and they both thought that might have been the "sealing deal". Not sure if they should turn away, something caught the corner of Greg's eye. He brought his hand up to his face, examining it like it was something new, and it was. His hands were different somehow, like paws, but still human in form. Greg stared at his fingernails as they darkened, growing longer while slightly curving, coming to a sharp point. Still staring at his hands, Greg watched as they grew thicker and meatier, looking and feeling rough as though he worked with his hands all day, like that of a construction worker. Flipping his hand over, looking down at his palms, he saw something strange and foreign. At first, his hands were calloused and hard, skin cracked from being too dry, but the calluses grew larger and thicker, forming pads like an animal’s paw. Watching in amazement, muscles in his forearms grew in width, becoming thicker, and rounded, while remaining tapered with the smallest portion at his wrist, thickening even more up to his bicep and triceps. Those too grew thicker, widening to eighteen inches around. Next on the change itinerary were his chest muscles. They thickened rapidly, like a balloon being filled with air, but remaining soft and supple. His nipples felt as if they were shrinking, when in fact they grew taught and erect, being slightly aroused with his current changes. Greg’s stomach grew bigger, looking like he added a spare tire to his abdomen, while being perfectly shaped to fit his new body and not take away from any of his better features. Looking down, Greg’s thighs were like tree trunks and his calves were like half inflated basketballs. Energy was even coursing down to his feet, which went through the same metamorphosis as his hands, remaining human for the most part but also taking on an animal look. He could even feel the blood rush into his cock, making it swell and enlarge from all the new, extra blood flooding those veins. Greg felt as though he was going to burst from all the new energy he felt, his stamina and libido going through the roof.</br>
<br>The changes seemed to stop momentarily, unknowing how long it was going to last, they both took the time to look over themselves and admire their even newer bodies. Andy and Greg knew some of the homosexual culture as they had a pretty good friend who was. They knew that if they went out, gay men everywhere would automatically reference them as bear men. They were sure they were becoming real bearmen or werebears.</br>
<br>When the transformation started up again, they gazed in the mirror, watching the rest of it. The hair on his body also seemed to thicken, the actual hair widening and remaining the same length, forming fur. It was like watching a plant creep up the side of a building, slowly engulfing the whole thing in it’s leafy greenness. The fur sprouted on their fingers and hands, as their knuckles gnarled slightly. It was consuming their whole hand, while traveling upward, covering their arms entirely, stopping right about their shoulders. While their arms were engulfed, their feet were also becoming furry, slowly snaking up their lower legs, then to their thighs, covering their crotches, but not on or over their bear cocks, covering their sacks. The fur continued up their bellies, over their pecs while leaving their nipples hairless, then up their necks combining with the fur already on their shoulders, up to their heads. Greg and Andy watched as their mouth and nose, pushed out from their faces, forming a snout and a muzzle. The fur followed along as their faces changed. Their noses were small, wet, and black. Their ears had moved to the top of their heads and rounded out, like bear ears, also covered in fur. Their eyes yellowed and their iris' changed to a deep forest green color. They felt their loins swell, growing to a massive size, barely being contained by their shorts as their still human shaped cock heads stuck out above the waist bands. After that, they knew their transformations were coming to an end, feeling pressure at the base of their spines as their short, stubby tails popped out.</br>
<br>Greg and Andy were in shock by what just happened, never really intending for it to go this far. They were both human but looked like real bears. Only they stood on their hind legs, still having their opposable thumbs and human intellect. They both wondered if they would still be able to talk. Greg was the first to try, being the brown bear, his voice was lower than before and much gruffer sounding. He hesitated, not knowing what would come out of his mouth.</br>
<br>“Well… I guess we can talk, after all!”</br>
<br>“Yeah, this is just too weird!”</br>
<br>“I know! However, I do think it is really cool! I mean look at us! We look older, we are hugely muscled without even having to work for them like everyone else would. Even my senses are heightened! Dude… we have to share this with the rest of the school.”</br>
<br>“I definitely agree Greg, but who are we going to take care of first? I mean it is going to be different to do this to others. Besides, we don’t have any more lotion… we used it all between the two of us!”</br>
<br>Bummed, Greg hung his head low, but got an idea while looking down at his crotch.</br>
<br>“Dude, I got the perfect solution. How about we use our cum?”</br>
<br>“I guess that will work… how do you want to get it out…?”</br>
<br>Andy finished with a very sly grin on his bearish face. “Well there are a couple ways I am sure we could agree upon. I feel like I could pump out gallons right now.”</br>
<br>Greg returned the grin, thinking dirty thoughts. “Yeah, I feel the same way there bro! Question is, who are we going to treat to our gift? I can‘t imagine our spunk retaining it‘s potency for more than fifteen minutes.”</br>
<br>“Yeah, you are probably right. I don‘t know who we could give it to, there are plenty of options though. We could give it to the football team, as our mascot is the bear; we could give it to all the faculty to gift the other students later; we could give it to the male lunch staff to put in special cookies made only for the men there.”</br>
<br>“Do you think it will have the same affect if you ingest it?”</br>
<br>“Yeah, why not? It is just DNA remember…”</br>
<br>“Ok, who do you think we should give it to first? You know when we do, they will become like us, look like full grown adult men. There will be an awfully high amount of adults going to high school.”</br>
<br>“You have a point there Greg. Well… we will just have to come to that road when we cross it. More than likely, things will work themselves out as they usually do.”</br>
<br>“Alright man! So who is first?”</br></p>
