<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Making Jeff 20 and in college in this. :P</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s head was hit with a massive migraine as a whole new reality&#39;s worth of memories flooded in. Most things were the same still, he still had an 18-year-old brat of a sister Jen in her senior year of high school A mom who worked in finance, and a stay-at-home dad... wait, that wasn&#39;t right his dad was a professor wasn&#39;t he? Oh god everything felt wrong in Jeff&#39;s head as he realized his dad must now be an object owned by his mom... but they never told him what object.<br />
<br />
  Jeff at least wasn&#39;t an object as far as he knew but the latest anyone ever transformed was 26 so he wasn&#39;t exactly out of the woods. The only way he could know for sure was if an object imprinted on him after all an owner cannot also be an object but… that also hadn&#39;t happened. <br />
<br />
 Maybe there was still time to fix this Jeff thought as he booted up the Chronivac on his computer. Only to be met with an error message &quot;WARNING your free trial has expired please purchase the full version to Continue your transformative experience&quot; Wait what? that was a free trial well how much could the full version cost? Jeff navigated to the online store-page for the Chronivac only for his stomach to lurch as he read the full cost... 10 million dollars... there&#39;s now way Jeff thought. Well no that actually makes a hell of a lot of sense actually Jeff did just rewrite reality that price tag is actually pretty cheap all things considered.<br />
<br />
Well that was that there was nothing that could be done Jeff thought besides go out into the world and pray he&#39;s fortunate enough to be an owner. Jeff had classes today and decided to head out of his dorm. He decided to stop for coffee first. As he was in line Jeff noticed the Barista had on a pair of shoes that looked just like a girl he knew used to work here. Each shoe was shiny and black but formed half of a woman&#39;s face. As Jeff stared at the man&#39;s shoes he realized he was the probably only person in the world right now that thought there was anything weird about them. To everyone else it was perfectly normal that that woman is now that man&#39;s work shoes, Jeff shuddered and hoped if he became an object he&#39;d have better luck than her.<br />
<br />
Jeff headed to class with his coffee, a boring statistics class he needed to take to graduate. As the professor a mid 30’s asian woman was droning on about sample sizes or something Jeff found himself lost in thought. There were absolutely less people here now and Jeff noticed quite a few more human objects here. He saw a pencil, a jacket and interestingly a woman made of coffee sitting in the professor’s mug being sipped on periodically. Jeff wondered how that would work, what would happen to her… afterwards.<br />
<br />
As class ended Jeff found himself floating towards the closest dining hall. Still clocking every human object he passed Jeff thought maybe it would have been better if he hadn’t retained his old memories. As he bought lunch and walked into the hall he noticed a table with 4… well 5 of his friends at it. <br />
<br />
“Hey Jeff come sit we saved you a seat” Hannah shouted out and patted the seat next to her. Hannah, an athletic blond girl just a bit older than him. He had known her since middle school and she had a way of being a little too competitive with him and nowadays he could barely keep up. Currently she is a star player on the school’s volleyball team.<br />
<br />
“Thanks Hannah” Jeff replied as he sat down<br />
<br />
“Jeez dude you look like shit.” said Eve who was sitting on the opposite side of him. Eve was a slim Asian Goth girl he had met in his junior year of highschool who was currently an art student. She was known for having a bit of a sadistic streak, and he had heard rumors she was working as a dominatrix now but was always too nervous to confirm it. “Thanks Eve. Appreciate the compliment.” Jeff retorted<br />
<br />
“He was up all night messing around on his computer.” Riley interjected whilst briefly looking up from the game on his phone. Jeff’s roommate Riley was a full five-foot-two-inches of pure femboy rage. Though he dressed and looked just like a girl Jeff knew he could be a total bro. Riley was usually gaming in their room until late in the evening. Not that Jeff minded as he was often right there with him.<br />
<br />
“And just what was so important you had to spend all night on your computer?” Tanya asked. Finally there was Tanya Who Jeff had known since grade school. Tanyan was a gorgeous chocolate skinned goddess of a woman with a great sense of humor and a 4.0 gpa to boot. Needless to say Jeff had had a crush on her for a long time. Though she had ended up with his other childhood friend; Daniel. Who Jeff somehow knew in this reality was currently preoccupied with supporting Tanya’s massive tits as her favorite bra. Something Jeff was actually a bit Jealous of ever since Danny first turned into her training bra back in middle school. Jeff would never hold it against him though, Daniel was still his best friend in the world.<br />
<br />
“Just a project for my programming class is all” Jeff lied to avoid the subject. Thank christ the conversation drifted off to different topics naturally. With Jeff only occasionally having anything to say his mind being too preoccupied. When Lunch was finally over Jeff saw Tanya beginning to leave the room and he chased after her.<br />
<br />
 “Hey Tanya, wait up!” He called out before catching up to her. “Do you mind if I talk to you and David for a bit?”<br />
<br />
Tanya raised a single eyebrow. “Sure thing, is everything okay? You seemed kinda down during lunch”<br />
<br />
“Yeah I’ve just got some stuff on my mind is all” Jeff replied as the two of them walked off to a family-sized bathroom for some privacy. Tanya unbuttoned her top to reveal Danny though his body had flattened out and become lacy the way Tanya like him Jeff instinctively knew he was looking at his best friend. His face muffled between Tanya’s two massive tits, Danny&#39;s voice came out slightly muffled. “So what can I do for you?”<br />
<br />
“Well it&#39;s just I wanted to ask the two of you about the time you imprinted on each other is all… what was it like?” Jeff asked sheepishly as he realized he was talking to his friends about tits and lingerie. There was a quiet pause as both considered the question “What brings this on? You’ve never seemed interested in this stuff before.” Tanya finally asked.<br />
<br />
“I’ve just been worried,&quot; Jeff replied truthfully. “The idea of being an object actually kind of scares me to be honest.” A small smile formed on Tanya’s face but it was Daniel who responded. “Aww Jeff there&#39;s nothing to be afraid of. There&#39;s no guarantee you’ll end up an object and even if you do, all the people in your life are good people and I’m sure they’ll take good care of you.”<br />
<br />
“To answer your question… Well, I was walking home from school with Tanya one day the same as any other. When I remember hearing her voice in my head.” Tanya slightly laughed to herself. “I was thinking about something my mother had told me that morning. That she was going to take me out shopping that day to buy my first bra.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah well once I heard the word Bra I crumpled to the ground in pain and blacked out.” Danny paused briefly. “When I woke up I was being held by her and I just knew instantly that I belonged to her, that that was right.”<br />
<br />
Tanya added. “When I brought him home My mom was so proud she took us… well me wearing him out for ice cream.”<br />
<br />
“You make it sound so happy weren&#39;t you scared at all?” Jeff asked to which Danny replied. “Well a little at first but I always knew that it could happen, and I was just happy it was Tanya of all people.” The Bra beamed.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry Jeff I’m sure you’ll love whoever you end up with, and Who knows I could always use a second object maybe it&#39;ll be me.” Tanya said as she took Jeff into a bear hug. &quot;Oh yeah your underwear drawer does get lonely.&quot; Daniel added.<br />
<br />
That night after all his classes were done Jeff trudged back to his dorm room past Riley engrossed in a game of Smash brothers and passed out in his bed thinking about all the days events. The next Day Jeff was going to spend his morning...</p>
