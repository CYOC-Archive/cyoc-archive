<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
As I was considering who and what to change, my phone rang.<br />
<br />
I fumbled with the small plastic device. The caller ID didn’t pop up, so it wasn’t anyone I knew. Clumsily, I answered the phone.<br />
<br />
“Hello,” I said, my voice deep. “Who is this?”<br />
<br />
“... Ethan.” The voice on the other end of the line sounded rather high for a male human and irritated.<br />
<br />
My heart leapt as I got the oddest impression that he was my best friend. Which was silly, I had no idea who Ethan was. But that nagging feeling came back, that I was SUPPOSED to know who he was.<br />
<br />
“Uh…” I scratched my back.<br />
<br />
“Your tutor?” Ethan spat. “You were supposed to come see me half an hour ago! Where are you?”<br />
<br />
Tutor? I needed a tutor? <br />
<br />
My memories welled up as I realized that yes, I definitely needed a tutor. Abyssmal grades were sinking my football career and Coach Hendrix had enlisted one of the smartest nerd on campus to help me out. I panicked as I realized I had completely forgotten about our study session today.<br />
<br />
I vaguely recalled Ethan, now, and realized why I could barely remember him.<br />
<br />
Ethan was nondescript. At 5&#39;10&quot; and about 140ish pounds he fit into any crowd easily and didn’t stand out. Mostly because he was short and skinny and you probably couldn’t see him. His haircut had been decent, I supposed, though I wasn’t interested much in humans. And, oh, yeah, he wore these squarish glasses, but they only made him seem more like a generic nerd expy than anything else.<br />
<br />
For some reason, hearing him get more irritated and angry with me made me feel upset, like I’d hurt someone I cared about. I hadn’t really known the guy, we’d only met the one time so far. So, like, that was weird. But I just couldn’t let it stand.<br />
<br />
“Mrroo, Ethan, I’m so sorry!” I lowed miserably. “I’m such a bull-head!”<br />
<br />
“Enough with that talk,” I head Ethan’s voice snap crisply on the other end of the line. “I’m coming down to the gym right now. You’d better still be there when I arrive!”<br />
<br />
The phone went dead. <br />
<br />
I put my phone away and stared miserably around the room, my ears so low they brushed my bulging neck. Josh hadn’t noticed the conversation at all, the horse too busy pumping out reps to care. I sagged against one of the benches and waited, for Ethan to walk in, feeling terrible.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the weights clattered. I turned to see Josh standing and stretching. He looked over at me and winked.<br />
<br />
“Ready to hit the treadmills?” Josh asked.<br />
<br />
“Uh, maybe later. Haven’t you got more reps to do?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but I wanna shock my muscles. Hit the treadmills. I’m feeling fuckin’ pumped today, hoss!” Josh grinned.<br />
<br />
I sighed and shook my head, totally not in the mood anymore. “Nah, you go on. I’m gonna grab a drink.”<br />
<br />
“Alright, but don’t you get lazy on me now. Those quads need a workout too!” Josh drawled and wiped off the bar we had been using. “See you in five.”<br />
<br />
Josh trotted off to a treadmill a few rows behind the fat girl. <br />
<br />
His rounded haunches bounced and his tail flicked as he ran. The horse’s massive physique was barely constrained by his sweat-soaked clothing, every contour of his body starkly visible through his white workout shirt. The bulge at the front of his shorts bounced, his baseball-sized orbs slapping wetly against his thighs. I could see the tip of his sheathe poking out above his waistband.<br />
<br />
I bit my lip with my flat front teeth, trying to will away my erection. <br />
<br />
It had only been a few minutes, but my hole felt so empty. I couldn’t wear my buttplug during leg day, it would fall out. Instead, all I had to look forward to was the shower afterwards. Josh always loved fucking my needy ring while we were all sweaty and musky.<br />
<br />
Josh would be here any minute now. I wobbled to my feet, my legs still feeling that after-workout noodley-ness. In the mirror, I could see my mountainous form. My legs bulged hugely, posterior like a rounded shelf of muscle. All this pain and inconvenience was worth it for an ass like that.<br />
<br />
As I admired myself, I heard quiet laughter behind me.<br />
<br />
I turned and noticed the jocks from earlier had stopped lifting and had now focused their attentions on the thin guy who was still struggling to lift the fifty-pound bar. For his part, the thin guy was tacitly ignoring them, but I could tell from his reddened cheeks that he was embarrassed. <br />
<br />
“Wanna put some weights on that bar, bro,” One of the jocks, muscular, with brown hair and scintillating blue eyes, chuckled.<br />
<br />
The thin young man reddened more.<br />
<br />
“Ah, c’mon Terry,” The blonde jock said, ribbing ‘Terry’, “Ryan can barely lift anything, look at him struggle!”<br />
<br />
The thin man, ‘Ryan’ seemed to shrink in on himself. I got the distinct impression that if the guy could, he would disappear into his own shirt. It started to bother me. I didn’t like seeing people get picked on. Sure, I could be judgmental, but I’d never say what the jocks were saying out loud. That was rude.<br />
<br />
“Maybe watch a workout video and do it at home, pal,” Terry sneered. “Or maybe… hey Will, do you think the little fag is only here to check out those two barn animals?”<br />
<br />
“Ha! Ryan wants some beef between his buns!” Will guffawed.<br />
<br />
Ryan shot a glance over at me and saw me staring at the tableau. He panicked and struggled to lift the bar off his chest. It tipped to one side, and he flailed his legs uselessly. The jocks just laughed harder.<br />
<br />
I clenched my jaw and pulled out my book.Taking my pencil in my hands, the thin stick unwieldy, and managed to write: ‘Ryan is a big beast of a man who no one would dare mock and who would never mock anyone else and lifts lots of weight.’ The text glowed and I looked up to see the thin young man begin to transform.<br />
<br />
On the bench, Ryan’s small body began to bloat and swell. <br />
<br />
I watched in awe as huge slabs of muscle began to swell out of the young man’s small body. That was quickly changing as well, his bones creaking and lengthening. Little pops filled the air as Ryan’s spine was stretched like taffy, his growing legs awkwardly akimbo as they slid out from their planted stance.<br />
<br />
Ryan’s body soon dwarfed the bench. It looked barely big enough to provide a support for his huge frame. But the changes didn’t stop there. As his pecs shoved themselves out of his chest like massive, heaving shelves, they began to soften as fat began to round out his body. His abs, which had come into view as he grew out of his clothes, clenched and cobbled, then bulged, swelling out into a humongous musclegut.<br />
<br />
The bench creaked ominously as Ryan’s form continued to pile on the pounds. <br />
<br />
And then, to my shock, dense hair began to sweep over the giant young man’s body. It grew thicker and lusher. It took me a moment to realize that Ryan was growing a pelt of thick fluffy brown fur. His hands and feet widened, shoes splitting apart as they became massive clawed paws. Ryan’s face cracked and popped as it extended into a short muzzle filled with sharp teeth. <br />
<br />
I stared at the humongous anthro grizzly that had taken Ryan’s place on the bench. <br />
<br />
Then his clothes shifted, becoming more appropriate for a powerlifter-mesh athletic shorts and a loose shirt with the sleeves ripped off. He was still in his bare paws. Rayan shifted his stance as the weight bench enlarged and reinforced itself, sliding his big paws into a proper position. He began to lift the bar.<br />
<br />
The grizzly grunted as hundred pound weights began to pile onto the bare bar. Weight after weight, so much so that the bar itself began to bend dangerously. My jaw dropped as I realized he was lifting nearly 2500 pounds. Neither I nor Josh could lift that much! We could pull that much, of course, but lifting was another matter entirely.<br />
<br />
I watched as Ryan grit his sharp teeth and began bench-pressing that enormous weight.<br />
<br />
My heart pounded in excitement. It was always nice to watch the big grizzly work out, ever since he joined our anthro community club and went straight for the gym with us in his first year. Especially now that I had made him capable of lifting so much. <br />
<br />
That was why I had written that sentence in the book… right?<br />
<br />
That strange niggling feeling that I was missing something passed through me in a shudder as the two jocks cheered the grizzly on. The grizzle gave them a wry look and a wink and the jocks turned away, blushing. I wondered why they were looking so abashed when I noticed the grizzly’s erect cock had sprung out of his sheathe and the movement of his chest had lifted his loose shirt up enough that they could see it.<br />
<br />
Mroo! Talk about a hung top! Guess Ryan enjoyed the strain of weight lifting a little more than most people did. Or maybe it was the way people cheered him on. Ryan was always a showboat like that.<br />
<br />
I paused as that strange, intrusive thought entered my head. Why would I even know Ryan?<br />
<br />
Then I shook my head, chuckling at my own forgetfulness. He was one of the only other anthros on campus, of course! Josh sure was lucky I met him first though. My asshole throbbed needily as I stared at Ryan’s red dong. I wrinkled my nose, picking up Ryan’s musky, masculine scent, and my heart fluttered in my chest.<br />
<br />
He saw me staring and grinned, pumping the over-weighted bar a few times. I blushed under my fur and looked away. Josh was my mate and I was a loyal bull, I told myself. Not a slutty… well, okay, I was very slutty, but just for him!<br />
<br />
I glanced back just in time to see the jocks walk away, too mortified at the grizzly’s fat, exposed dick to say anything, let alone belittle him, which was an odd thought to have. Who the hell would mock Ryan? That bear would rip them in two if he wasn’t such a softie at heart.<br />
<br />
Wait, hold on, I was going to punish them too, right? For…something. I couldn’t quite recall what it was. But I had definitely been about to write something for them both, to teach them a lesson about… shit, I done forgot. Mroo! I was so forgetful today!<br />
<br />
I fumbled with the notebook to try to figure out what they’d done to upset me so much when my phone beeped. <br />
<br />
When I checked my texts and saw that Ethan had gotten tied up in a meeting with his Professor and wouldn’t get here for another ten minutes. Josh was over at the treadmill, so I figured I could get a good five mile run in before Ethan got here. Plus it would keep Josh satisfied that I wasn’t slacking off.<br />
<br />
Mroo! I could be so lazy!</p>
