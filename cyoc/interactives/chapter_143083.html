<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom, Eric, Dave, and Kris were having a lazy summer day hanging out in their tree house in the yard, discussing plans to play some ball and just watching cars pass by on the way to the inner city while discussing the latest movie they went to see. Tom was a young blond haired blue eyed 11 year old; Eric, Tom&#39;s older brother, is also a young blond haired boy of 13; Dave is their neighbor and Tom&#39;s best friend, an Asian boy of 12, whose family just moved in a year ago; and Kris, short for Krissy, was another child from the neighborhood, Kris was an red headed 11 year old tomboy from an Irish family, middle child of 4 siblings, all girls, including her new baby sister, but she preferred to escape her sisters and hang out with her guy friends than be caught dead doing anything &quot;girly&quot; she was the polar opposite of her twin sister, Rachel, who idealized their 17 year old older sister, Rosaleen, who was well on track to becoming a glamour model. Eric as the oldest, usually tried to assert himself as the leader of the group, though he would never admit it to the other boys, he really did that more to try to impress Kris, who he had a slight crush on.<br />
Dave was more interested in watching the cars today, trying to stay out of the conversation as he had missed out on the newest superhero movie the others were discussing and did not want to be spoiled. He had just spotted a particularly fancy Mustang and was following it down the road, watching the driver swerve a bit, clearly texting or something distracting him. when he saw a box truck come over the hill. Dave was sure there was about to be an accident, but at the last second the truck swerved and hit a pot hole, causing a flat tire, the driver in the Mustang none the wiser.<br />
&quot;Wow, did you guys see that?&quot; an excited Dave shouted to his friends. They had not as they were engrossed in their discussion, so he explained what he just saw, embellishing the details a bit, as they watched the flustered driver go to the back, open the sliding door and grab a spare to change his tire. Curious as most young people are, they noticed the truck was hauling some medical looking equipment and many boxes, making up wild stories of what could possibly be contained within. The man, muttering angrily and clearly in a hurry, changed the tire and put the flat in the back and rushed to get back on his delivery. As he drove off, he hit another small bump in the road. It was there the kids noticed he had left the door cracked and must have left the latch undone as the door slid up a bit and back down, closed enough you wouldn&#39;t think anything fell out but still not fully closed, and not before a smaller box slid out into the street near the corner of the property.<br />
After a few minutes, it was clear the man did not notice and was not likely coming back. So wanting to appear brave and adventurous, Eric ran over and brought it back to the tree house, they all discussed what it could be, daring each other to open it.<br />
&quot;You took it, you open it.&quot; Tom insisted.<br />
&quot;Fine, you are just chicken anyway.&quot; Eric retorted, &quot;Lets see... there is a label here... R.G.N.X Batch Ver. 10-12. Well, that wasn&#39;t very helpful I guess, lets pop this thing open.&quot; He took a pair of scissors and cut the tape sealing the box and folded the flaps back to reveal what appeared to be several vials, most containing a liquid, some a powder, and a few what looked like pill bottles, all with the same sort of label RGNX followed by some numbers.<br />
&quot;Hey, look&quot; Dave pointed out, picking up a letter among the vials and bottles. He read it to the others.<br />
<br />
RGNX batch 10 - RGNX concentrate, we successfully made a concentrated version, but the attempts to negate the unwanted transitive side effects during processing were a failure. This has been a good experiment in mass producing RGNX to use as our base in most of the recent trials, mix 2 part water and 1 part liquid to get a usable sample, pure liquid sample will not cause any adverse reactions, but could have much longer lasting effects, varied from sample to sample moderately. Recommended use in further trials as it is cost effective, though further study is needed to know if it is even viable to maintain desired effects while negating the undesired.<br />
RGNX test batch 11 - attempt to process RGNX into a powdered concentrate and negate the unwanted transitive side effects are a failure, recommended further study, while it was not a success, tests noted reduction in the bitter flavor of the pure form. Possible base for a trial 13 version. Can be mixed in any liquid, the powder is very easy to work with at least, allowing for flexible dosing options.<br />
RGNX test batch 12 - attempt to process RGNX into pill form and negate the unwanted transitive side effects are a failure, recommended disposal, unlikely to be salvageable, desired euphoric effects were mostly absent while undesired transitive side effects still remained and for a prolonged period of time, definite failure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like shorthand research notes, though I don&#39;t really see any useful information in explaining what this actually is to someone not already aware. Guess that adventure was over before it started right, guys?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not necessarily.&quot; Eric boasted. &quot;It mentioned euphoric effects, we could try some?&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you crazy?&quot; Tom exclaimed. &quot;It also mentioned transitive side effects, whatever  those are, it could be dangerous.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh where is your sense of adventure, you are with me right Dave?&quot; Said Eric.<br />
&quot;Ummm...*Eric glares at Dave* nnnnn...sssure I guess&quot;  Dave hesitantly lets out.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, Eric, this seems like a bad idea?&quot; Suggests Kris, though secretly a little excited at the possibilities that it could be something fun at least.<br />
&quot;Oh come on, we can draw straws, person with the shortest decides what we do.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, that is fair at least.&quot; Stammers Dave.<br />
Tom thought to himself if he wins he could just veto it as he did not want to really risk any harm to himself or his friends, but maybe he could make Eric take it since he was being such a bully, or maybe he would take it after all and prove he is not a chicken. These thoughts fought in his mind as they started to draw straws... each one took a straw and...<br />
(who won, and what do they do)</p>
