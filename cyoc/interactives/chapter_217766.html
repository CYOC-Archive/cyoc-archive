<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miles and Miranda were packing up for a camping trip that Spark had decided to set up for everyone. She had thought that over the last couple of months of preparation and training for a fight that was over that now they needed a little relaxation and asked everyone if they wanted to camp out near the woods that weren&#39;t too far away from the Moreland home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mamá? Do we have any bug spray? You know that we can use for camping?&quot; Miles asked his mother.<br />
<br />
Gabrielle looked through a cabinet of chemicals below the sink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we have bug spray, but it&#39;s for the kitchen. Let me check the garage, I think your father may have some bug spray for camping.&quot; Gabrielle said as she led her son to the garage.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, who all is going on your camping adventure?&quot; Gabrielle asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miranda of course, her girlfriend Amara. My friend Connor, and his girlfriend, then there&#39;s our two other friends who are also girlfriends. Mamá, is there something wrong with me? I know lots of girls think I look cute, but they don&#39;t really want to talk to me. Am I just not going to have a girlfriend in my life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, mi chico. Te preocupas demasiado.&quot; Gabrielle said giving her son a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a right to worry. Wasn&#39;t it love at first site, with you and dad?&quot; Miles asked.<br />
<br />
Gabrielle finally found the bug spray for camping.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haven&#39;t I ever told you how your father and I got together?&quot; Gabrielle asked as Miles thought for a minute before shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well back when I was you and your friends age, I was, and I hate to say the word: a bitch. I was very rude to lots of my classmates and even some of my own friends. Your father and I actually attended the same high school. I only saw him so many times at high school and I used to think: this guy is such a loser. After high school, most of my friends moved or stopped talking to me. One day when I got a job at a grocery store, your dad came up to me and asked if I wanted to hang out with him after work and I decided to do so. After that, we talked and then later dated, I even learned Spanish along the way. I had some boyfriends before Miguel, but none of them stayed in my heart like your father does. You&#39;ll find love soon mi hijo.&quot; Gabrielle told Miles who gave her son another hug.<br />
<br />
*************************************************************<br />
<br />
Later, Miles and his friends were setting up their camp site close to sunset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you know what this reminds me of? Back when Connor and I met you guys and tossed a net onto Nat, remember that?&quot; Spark chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha ha, Spark, you know those nets you guys make are tricky to get out of.&quot; Nat commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute, Spark, you and Connor tried to capture Nat in a net?&quot; Amara asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah. This was almost a year ago. We didn&#39;t know you guys then though, so it was just an accident.&quot; Connor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was, and maybe if we didn&#39;t meet them, I never would have met you.&quot; Miranda said batting her eyes at Amara who blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, so maybe two people here who&#39;ve actually been camping before can show us exactly how to camp?&quot; Rei suggested as Spark and Connor nodded and showed them how to set up their tents and build a fire.<br />
<br />
As the day turned into night, Connor showed his friends how to get a fire started so they all could enjoy some marshmallows. Miles looked around to see Amara with her head on Miranda&#39;s shoulder, Nat and Rei holding hands and their marshmallow sticks while Connor had his arm wrapped around Spark&#39;s shoulder, until Spark moved it down toward her bottom and kissed Connor with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m going to go....let nature take its course, I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; Miles said as he left his friends alone. <br />
<br />
Miles finished going in the woods and was about to go back when he heard what he thought was a female voice not very far away that wounded like singing. Miles moved a little closer to see a girl around his age washing herself off in a nearby lake. Miles didn&#39;t want to be rude and was about to go back to the campfire when he saw her stand up and saw she had deer legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa!&quot; Miles accidentally said aloud.<br />
<br />
The girl turned around quickly and shrieked in alarm, then ducked back down into the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to, I just heard your singing, I didn&#39;t know you were bathing.&quot; Miles said trying to apologize hoping this girl would understand.<br />
<br />
She seemed to be saying something in Native American, which Miles didn&#39;t understand. Miles saw some nearby clothes and went to hand them over to her. The deer girl quickly took the clothes and dressed herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m really sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to, I&#39;ll get back to my friends and...&quot; The deer girl grabbed Miles arm and began sniffing him like a dog. Once she was done sniffing, she nuzzled him like a dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...thank you, but I&#39;ve got to get back to my friends and you&#39;ve got to get home, probably, right? Bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hogan? yóó&#700; ííyá.&quot; The deer girl asked clinging onto Miles arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t understand. Maybe my friend can help you, she&#39;s....uh...magic.&quot; Miles suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;álííl? álííl!&quot; The girl said excitedly as she clung onto Miles arm while nuzzling him.<br />
<br />
The group was surprised when they saw Miles come back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit dude, you didn&#39;t just shit in the woods, you met a girl in the woods.&quot; Spark said as she saw the girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah, I think she may need help, she&#39;s....&quot; Miles didn&#39;t finish before Spark saw the girl had deer legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, a deer girl. I heard from Sylvia and Tanya when they were around that the deer people were around again, but I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d ever see one again. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen one since Connor&#39;s dad was a kid. They usually like to keep to themselves.&quot; Spark said.<br />
<br />
The girl then began to speak to Spark in her own tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what&#39;s she saying?&quot; Nat asked as Spark as everyone looked intently at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;......I don&#39;t know, I actually don&#39;t speak a lot of what she&#39;s saying.&quot; Spark admitted as everyone groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what is she speaking?&quot; Miles asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a little rusty on the details, but I think she&#39;s speaking Navajo.&quot; Spark said as she nodded and nuzzled Miles again with a smile as thanks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, she&#39;s sweet on you Miles.&quot; Miranda said thinking the moment cute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t speak Navajo either, but my mom actually learned Navajo years back. She had a neighbor who spoke it and taught her. I may not know a lot of it, but I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s saying she&#39;s lost.&quot; Connor said as the friends went to the Moreland house with the deer girl.</p>
