<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Things were quickly getting out of hand. Connor and the others had hoped to stop Kane, perhaps capture or even kill him. Instead the group now found themselves at the Moreland home as they discussed a possible rendezvous with Ezekiel Kane. Needless to say, Jacob and Nina were concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad he asked for me specifically,&quot; Connor stated. Jacob nodded, the retired hunters face grim as he gazed at his son and his friends.&quot;I understand that son,&quot; he said softly. &quot;But I still worry. Kane&#39;s dangerous that&#39;s why I want your brother going with you.&quot; Connor now glanced towards his older brother. After returning home with Kane&#39;s message, Jacob realized his eldest could no longer stay out of this. With a little help from his girlfriend, Caleb was able to quickly journey home in order to deal with Ezekiel Ksne.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re even considering sending either one of them,&quot; Spark exclaimed, the fairies face a mixture of anger and fear. &quot;This dude is psycho! Do you really expect him to keep his word?&quot; <br />
<br />
Caleb and Connor were silent, neither brother trusting Kane but, realizing that they couldn&#39;t put anyone else in danger. Connor now approached Spark, trying to comfort his girlfriend with their decision. &quot;Spark listen,&quot; he said softly. &quot;I know you&#39;re scared. I am too but I need you to trust us. Me and Caleb will take every precaution. We won&#39;t be heros.&quot; Spark nodded, the fairy holding back tears as she now squeezed her boyfriend in a tight hug.<br />
<br />
Caleb could only sigh, staring at the gathered teens. Connor had made quite a few friends over the last month, friends who were quite loyal to his little brother. Between Nat, Rei, the Desotos, and Amara, Caleb was happy to see his brother finally branch out. He believed that given time, Connors friends would be abke to stop Ezekiel Kane, especially with Sylvia, Tanya, and Akira added to the mix. However, if they could get a read on Kane&#39;s motivations maybe they could end this without further bloodshed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Young Moreland a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb turned, noticing the kitsune now beckon him towards a small table. Approaching he could see Sylvia and Tanya now hovering over a map of the town. &quot;Whats up,&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Sylvia sighed. &quot;I just want to say how this is crazy but, we&#39;ve come up with an idea.&quot; Sylvia now gestured to the map, pointing to the spot that the meeting was supposed to take place. &quot;We may not be able to come but Tanya and I can at least keep am eye on things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still wish you&#39;d let us come,&quot; Tanya added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its hunter business,&quot; Caleb stated. &quot;If we try to surprise him chances are a bunch of people are going to get hurt. Let me and my brother meet up first. After that we can come up with a way to stop him.&quot; Tanya shrugged, her shoulders slumping as she now explained what they would do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay well the spell me and my daughter have in mind will allow us to track you,&quot; Sylvia stated. &quot;This way we&#39;ll know where you are. If you keep him talking long enough I&#39;m hoping that the spell will allow us to track Kane as well.&quot; Caleb nodded, thanking the ghosts as he turned to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Young Moreland,&quot; Akira called. Caleb turned, staring at the kitsune curiously. &quot;Be careful,&quot; Akira said. &quot;I still want my rematch.&quot;<br />
<br />
The night of the meeting Caleb and Connor now drove towards the meeting spot. Ezekiel Kane had chosen an ancient spot about 30 minutes outside of town. The area itself had at one point been an old church that had long since crumbled to dust. Now all that remained was a large oak tree located next to s stream. Parking Calebs jeep on the dirt road, the brothers now approached cautiously, armed with the tools of their trade.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats far enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb and Connor paused, the brothers scanning the darkness. Kane was out there, hidden within the shadows. &quot;Show yourself,&quot; Connor called.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a minute,&quot; Kane replied. &quot;First things first. Who&#39;s with you kid?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Caleb Moreland. I&#39;m Connors older brother and the latest hunter in the Moreland line.&quot;<br />
<br />
A chuckle now echoed from the woods, Kane finding this bit of information amusing. &quot;I&#39;ll be damned and hear I thought the kid was the hunter.&quot; Cakeb and Connor said nothing, the pair readying themselves for Kanes response.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Caleb,&quot; Kane called. &quot;You should already know the drill. Open up that jacket and let me see what you have on you. Oh and Connor, why don&#39;t you put that crossbow and quiver on the ground.&quot; Connor looked to his older brother who gave his brother a simple nod. The Moreland boys now complying with Kanes request. &quot;Okay now show yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor now watched as Kane slowly emerged from the darkness, the large man&#39;s cigar wafting smoke into the night air as he glared at the pair. Slowly the brothers watched as he approached, a small medallion dangling from his hand. &quot;No Pancho Villa,&quot; he asked. &quot;Let me guess, he&#39;s little brothers apprentice or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s my friend,&quot; Connor called back angrily. Kane said nothing, slowly circling the pair as he studied them. &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Making sure you don&#39;t have that pollen humper with ya,&quot; Kane replied. &quot;You Morelands like to associate with too many supernatural fuckers.&quot; Connor grit his teeth, looking to lash out at Kanes insults of Spark, Caleb placing a hand on his brothers shoulder to calm him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spark isn&#39;t here,&quot; Caleb replied. &quot;We&#39;ve honored the old ways but I ask to you refer to my partner respectfully.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Partner,&quot; Kane scoffed. &quot;Partnering with the fae. Too many in our line of work do that but fine kid, I won&#39;t insult your pet fairy no more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you wanted to talk so talk,&quot; Connor said angrily. Kane chuckled, finding the young teens outburst amuzing.<br />
&quot;Been watching you kid,&quot; he said. &quot;Keeping tabs on you and your friends. Learned quite a bit. Ya got a dhamphir and her wizard girlfriend, your pet fairy, the twins I&#39;m guessing one of who happens to be a wizard as well. Ya even been hanging around with a demon. Real interesting company you keep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave my friends alone,&quot; Connor growled.<br />
<br />
Kane scoffed, shaking his head as he glanced at Caleb. &quot;Your little brother keeps real interesting company. Hoping it&#39;s a phase. Know your family doesn&#39;t exactly see things my way but the boy should know better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want Ezekiel,&quot; Caleb asked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Straight to the point,&quot; Kane stated. &quot;Your old man was like that too. I&#39;ll keep it brief. Like I said been keeping an eye on you lot. Knew you weren&#39;t the only ones looking for me. Why do you think I gave that whore my location? I wanted to draw ya out and imagine my surprise when I see what followed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb and Connor said nothing, Kane pausing as he stared at the brothers. &quot;What were you doing with a couple of ghosts and whatever the hell that other thing was?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont play dumb kid,&quot; Kane growled. &quot;I could tell those two ladies were ghosts. You don&#39;t do this for as long as I have without learning a few things. I could tell right away, their aura lit up my runes like the fourth of July. What I couldn&#39;t quite figure out was the fox. Ain&#39;t never seen that, care to share?&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb and Connor were silent, realizing that although Kane knew about Sylvia and Tanya, he had no knowledge of what Akira was. &quot;We&#39;re not telling you anything,&quot; Connor replied defiantly.<br />
<br />
A frown now formed on Kanes face, the man&#39;s body tensing as if preparing to strike. &quot;I&#39;m gonna find out sooner or later.&quot; Still the brothers remained silent under the large hunters intimidating gaze. After a moment Kane sighed, glowering at the brothers as he began tobstep backwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;So be it kids,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ll get to the point. Heard about what&#39;s been happening here recently. How the whole supernatural world decided to set roots around here. Since your not dealing with it, I am. Stay outta my way or you can join your friends six feet under.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know we can&#39;t do that Ezekiel,&quot; Caleb replied slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Consider it a professional courtesy then,&quot; Kane answered. &quot;I know where they all are. The wizards, the demons, that dhamphir. Every last one. I&#39;m gonna scour them off the land and it ain&#39;t gonna be pretty. If you want your line to continue Moreland then stay outta my way. Consider this your only warning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb and Connor said nothing, watching as Lane vanished once more into the shadows, leaving the brothers much to think about.</p>
