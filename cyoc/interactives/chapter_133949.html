<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*DING-DONG!*<br />
&quot;Mark, I think that&#39;s the pizza!&quot; Sarah called from the living room. &quot;I&#39;ll get– oh no. Not again!&quot; She had to lay another egg. I quickly withdrew my hand from enlarged dick. The distraction was enough to keep my dick from swelling even further from the pleasure I could feel as it snaked down my leg. But regardless of my predicament, Sarah had to deal with hers first. The doorbell rang again, and I left the bathroom. Sarah raced past me as she hobbled along. She slammed the door shut behind me. She hadn&#39;t noticed the obscene bulge that was creeping closer and closer to my knee. I did my own sort of hobble towards the front door and opened it.<br />
<br />
On the front porch was my best friend, Eric. He and I were on the baseball team together. At 18 years old, he was definitely taller and more barrel-chested than I was. He had his own share of admirers at school but for whatever reason never went out on dates. If he wasn&#39;t at school, playing baseball, hanging out with me or our friends, or at home, he was working as pizza delivery guy. This would explain why he was there. He held the pizza and the bottle of soda in front of him. He had a strange expression on his face like he was worried about something.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up, bro?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
Realizing that the pizza box was blocking the view of my slowly enlarging dick, I decided to not discuss that at the moment, &quot;Oh nothing much. Work keeping you busy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...yeah, something like that,&quot; he stuttered. Something was off about him. Normally, the big, strong Eric would be enthusiastically telling me about some college recruitment offer that he had told me a dozen times already. But now, he was strangely silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything okay?&quot; I asked, knowing full well that my dick was starting to graze my knee. It wasn&#39;t okay with me, but I wasn&#39;t about to admit my problem to my best friend at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...yeah!&quot; Eric replied suddenly, like he had been discovered doing something he shouldn&#39;t have. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You just...uh...seem a little out of it,&quot; I said. I looked closely at his face to try and figure him out. We&#39;ve known each other for years, and I can definitely tell when something&#39;s bothering him that he was unsure about telling me. It was all in the way his handsome eyebrows would bunch up slightly and how his beautiful eyes would avoid making eye-contact with me. Wait, since when did I find his eyebrows to be handsome? Or his eyes to be beautiful? Or his shirt to cling to his large pecs in just the right way? Or his lips to be kissable? Or...<br />
<br />
I suddenly had to hide an involuntary lustful moan as a cough as it escaped my mouth. My dick was swelling rapidly now. I could feel it pressing against my leg and my jeans. Why was it so big? Would my jeans even be able to contain it? And why was I getting really aroused all of a sudden by Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...are you okay?&quot; Eric nervously asked. I took a deep breath. My nostrils flared as an incredible scent flooded them. Damn, that pizza really smells delicious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah,&quot; I stammered out. I quickly take the pizza box and the soda bottle from Eric. With the pizza closer, I take a deep breath. But the scent isn&#39;t coming from the pizza?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I...um...saw Sarah today,&quot; Eric said, trying to change the subject to something less awkward for him. My dick was now pulsing with arousal as I stared at my incredibly hot friend. Why have I never noticed how hot this guy was? &quot;She and her mom seemed really worried about something. Did you get her knocked up?&quot; The question was so surprising that it knocked me out of my silent ogling of Eric. I blinked and frowned at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What in the world would give you that impression?&quot; I asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she was at the gynecologist&#39;s office and looked worried about something,&quot; Eric replied quickly. &quot;A guy can put two and two together, you know.&quot; Still ignoring my throbbing erection that was still growing, albeit painfully now, I was confused by his explanation. Eric had no sisters, and his mom walked out on his dad when Eric was only five years old.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why were you at the gynecologist&#39;s office?&quot; I asked, narrowing my eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...um....shit.&quot; Eric closed his eyes in embarrassment. It was a similar look that Sarah had whenever she returned from laying an egg. My eyes slowly drift down his body. My dick throbs even more as I find myself loving the journey. But when I reached his crotch, there was no bulge of any kind. That didn&#39;t make sense. I had seen him naked in the locker room before. His dick was the same size as mine, well as big as mine used to be. Even more strangely, my dick was not responding well to the memory of Eric&#39;s dick. It was as if my dick was drawn to Eric, but not to his dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I can&#39;t explain what happened okay,&quot; Eric quickly hissed at me. He kept his eyes tightly closed. &quot;I know this sounds insane, but a couple days ago, I wake up and find that I don&#39;t have a dick anymore. I have a vagina now. And it feels incredibly weird. That&#39;s why I was at the gynecologist&#39;s office today. There&#39;s something off about it that she couldn&#39;t quite figure out.&quot; He slowly opened his eyes. &quot;And I feel really strange right now. I just need to go home, man. I&#39;ll explain more later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I see it?&quot; I blurted out before I could stop myself. My dick was achingly hard again.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what?!&quot; Eric asked worriedly. &quot;W-why?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I see it?&quot; I repeated. I wanted to see his vagina. No, I needed to see his vagina. It would look so hot on his incredibly masculine body. I no longer cared that I was totally sexually attracted to my best friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-a-are you sure?&quot; Eric asked nervously. I nodded. I set the pizza box and soda down on the ground. He walked closer to me. That amazing scent got even stronger. Eric must have smelled it too because his nostrils also flared and he huffed a little bit. I thought I heard a seam pop on my jeans, but I didn&#39;t care. Without taking his eyes off of mine, he slowly undid his belt. Then, he dropped his pants.<br />
<br />
The smell hit me like a freight train. I couldn&#39;t stop the lusty moan coming out of my mouth. I closed my eyes as pleasure coursed over my body. There were more popping seams, and with a sudden pulse, my dick burst out of my jeans. It was massive. It didn&#39;t look human anymore. It was a deep black color, and at least a foot in length. Precum was dripping out of the flared head. I was too turned on to care about my ripped pants or my inhuman dick. Eric moaned too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like the opposite happened to you,&quot; he panted. We locked eyes just before we locked lips. We made out passionately on my front steps. He pulled me in close. My dick was sandwiched in between the two of us. The way our muscular bodies were rubbing against my dick was the most amazing feeling in the world.<br />
<br />
Eric stopped kissing me and stared intensely into my eyes. He opened his mouth and...</p>
