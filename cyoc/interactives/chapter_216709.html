<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Tony got out of bed the next morning, he was surprised to discover the fur was all the way around his midsection, and it was a beautiful light tan on his belly. He rubbed it and found that he had even more nipples now underneath it, hopefully as many as he was going to get at last. He put his long tongue to use and started licking at his clawed feet, which felt strange but also allowed him to smell all the places he had been the day before. He even chewed on his rear claws a little, which actually felt pretty nice. Feeling an itch on his neck, and so far enjoying the fact that he could bend himself around this way, he decided to find out whether he could get those clawed feet up to that part of his neck. He could, and the contact of those claws back there was like an epiphany. He groaned and heard his collar and name tag rattling while he scratched himself like a dog for the first time.<br />
<br />
Going out to train with David again was a blast as always. He marked the bushes again on the way out, surprised to discover that Lucky&#39;s scent was on them as well. He was fully in the habit of starting his day like a dog now, and realized that every day was probably going to start more or less like this until he was dead. His exercise routine really tired him out, but it was worth a decent lunch and the attention he got from David whenever he was a good dog. David started letting Tony sniff things and then would start hiding them so Tony could try to find them with only his nose. It wasn&#39;t drugs yet, but it was the same skill he&#39;d eventually be using to find drugs. Tony thought it was actually really fun, and he could admit he was okay with the idea of doing this from now on. As much as he might have second-guessed himself at times since this transformation began, he still had to admit the idea of playing this nose game for a living was way more appealing than ever going back to the burger joint or even back to school. He really had lucked out in this position in a lot of ways, and he really hoped that Lucky would eventually come to that conclusion, too.<br />
<br />
One thing he didn&#39;t do this time was go back up to the horse facility with David, but he did smell Cynthia&#39;s scent on David and realized they had been together at some point even after he left them. Interestingly enough, he could smell the residue of sexual fluids and realized they had been together for much more than a friendly chat. He didn&#39;t say anything to David about this, though, because he assumed that David probably didn&#39;t want to hear about his night of passion from some police dog in training. David did take Tony back to Illusia&#39;s magic room to let her see how he was progressing, though, which sort of surprised Tony.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, wow, he really is progressing well, isn&#39;t he?&quot; said the Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, he is, Madame. He&#39;s even officially begun his scent training,&quot; David answered. Tony was too busy panting with his huge, wet tongue to comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Tony is going to be such a good boy, isn&#39;t he!&quot; she scratched him on the head, where his hair was now dog fur, and Tony leaned fully into her touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any advice or notice anything we should be worried about?&quot; David asked, hoping everything would be fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. Just keep the training going and keeping treating him as well as you&#39;ve been treating him. The transformation should complete its course perfectly on schedule.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good to hear. Have a wonderful evening, Madame.&quot;<br />
<br />
As David was leading Tony back to the housing unit for the evening, he let Tony off his leash again so they could play fetch a few times before their time together ended. Tony was running to him with the ball when he dropped it and looked worried somehow. The changing man grabbed his ears and started to yell a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tony, Tony! Are you okay?&quot; David ran shouted, running over. Tony did not answer but only clutched his ears. He could feel an intense pressure and stretching up there that made the skin burn. But as he held his ears, he felt them growing longer, wider, taller, deeper and stronger. He felt the muscles at the base of each ear ache and then start kicking into action. His ears started to move, much more than he had ever been capable of before, and he felt that they were large. And then he felt the fur grown on them.<br />
<br />
When it was over, he took a deep breath and looked around, seeing David and hearing everything in the yard more crisply than before. David soon spoke again, causing Tony&#39;s ears to pivot toward him, making him sound louder than was.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Tony, you&#39;re fine. Your ears look very distinguished, too. The Madame told me that the changes usually start to be a little bit painful as you get closer to your final form, but the painful ones usually finish quicker, and when all the changes are over, you&#39;ll be in your new doggy body for good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony was grateful that nothing was wrong. He was happy that David was still here for him no matter what happened. He licked David&#39;s hand again and made him laugh, and they went back to his room together, where David patted his furry back for a while and then left for the evening. Tony wondered how long it would be before he would be going home with David after days like this and learning to live with a human full-time as a dog. Until then, he thought he could enjoy spending time in this temporary housing with Lucky and especially Megan while they could all still be together.</p>
