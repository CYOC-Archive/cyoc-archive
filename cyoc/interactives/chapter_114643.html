<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jonathan quickly began to plan a counter-strike. He was a prince after all, or he once was. At 1/80th of his original stature and robbed of his crown and royal garments he looked and felt like so much less since that awful Toad King had robbed him of his fate and forced him into servitude. As the days went by Johnathan split multiple times each time losing a little bit more of his sense of purpose and self all-the-while finding out new things about his newfound role such as his ability to gain knowledge at multiple times due to his selfs each being capable of communicating.<br />
<br />
The Princeling soon learned that he was not the only human Prince to have come into this kingdom and that others before him had fallen prey to the Toad King&#39;s glutenous magics. There were many in fact, one was a love struck young Prince come to marry a nearby Princess and join kingdoms in what would be a prosperous peace and union whom the Toad King had other plans for and turned into an unfortunately small snail that now forced to live out his days licking the toad oils from the floor for sustenance. <br />
<br />
He learned of a strapping strong prince who had one many battles and was well endowed with muscle had mistakingly bathed in the Toad Kings waters and soon found his body robbed of its beauty and strength reduced to a diminutive ant turned ant colony that the Toad King loved to terrorize. <br />
<br />
There was also the musical prince, whom played a lute near the pond many days in and out and soon found himself betrothed. The Toad King coveted him and his musics and had not touched him but felt betrayed that the Prince would soon leave him. Now that Prince is just a lowly cricket forced to play for his mighty Toad King as punishment. <br />
<br />
On and on stories went of how the Toad King&#39;s jealousy had turned over Kingdoms again and again. Johnathan recalled stories of several lost princes he&#39;d heard but now he knew the truth. It was all too much for him to bare and he knew it was time to strike. He could fly away but he had tried that with one of him selves only to lose its connection after hearing the Toad Croak calling him back to his master. No more he thought as he planned his attack, he&#39;d sting as many toads as he could and usurp the great King. <br />
<br />
Flying in from all angles he found the Toad King sitting by the pond watching the snail lick up his toad oils from the floor before him. Suddenly surrounded the King didn&#39;t even flinch as Johnathan #0001 flew before him and landed on the same lily pad he&#39;d laid upon when he arrived. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re done for&quot; Johnathan started as his other selves maintained attack positions. &quot;you should have known better that wasps are predators, meat eaters and the warring sort. Bee&#39;s are the frilly honey gatherers and submissive fools, but we wasps we fight and we win&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So you admit it&quot; The Toad King stated rather plainly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Admit it?&quot; Johnathan said surprised &quot;Admit what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your place&quot; The King replied looking at Johnathan #0001 in the eye. &quot;You admit you&#39;re not a Princess anymore. I&#39;d wondered how long it&#39;d take, how many it&#39;d take&quot; The King seemed to sound almost delighted. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I uh...I was just saying&quot; Johnathan tried to reply he didn&#39;t get it, why wasn&#39;t the Toad King scared? Why was he talking to him like this. He hadn&#39;t forgotten his role, he&#39;d learned so much more about it but he&#39;d never forgotten it and just thought perhaps he&#39;d use his curse to his advantage. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re thinking I&#39;m wrong, that you&#39;ve always remembered? You always do, they always do. I rather delight in knowing that you&#39;ll never forget where you come from you get this special look in your eye when you know it&quot; The Toad King chuckled. &quot;But now you admit it, and you&#39;ve learned to use it&quot; he said looking around at the others primed to strike. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have and I will&quot; Johnathan said smugly. &quot;you&#39;re done for Toad King&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think not&quot; The Toad King said almost as if he was bored. &quot;You see wasp, you all come to this point sooner or later, its the inevitable role of a wasp. So many have done so before you and well...&quot;<br />
<br />
Johnathan didn&#39;t recall any other wasps before him, there was only that one which had tried to sting the King upon Johnathans transformation and had been devoured but no others. Suddenly without warning the pond erupted in a crashing of waves as several Toads breached the surface their tongues ejecting from their mouths snatching the Wasp-Boys one by one until Johnathan stood minuscule and alone before the great King, his army laid to waste. <br />
<br />
&quot;There have been so many&quot; The Toad King purred as he hopped onto the pad before Johnathan knocking him onto his back. &quot;all from your family I believe, your cousins and your older brother so delicious was the last and now you&quot;  Johnathan tried to crawl away but being so small he didn&#39;t get far. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been found guilty of treason little wasp and your sentence?&quot; The King croaked his great stomach gurgling. &quot;I do so the sweet taste of justice&quot; He smiled a wicked grin.</p>
