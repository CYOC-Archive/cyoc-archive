<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Simon finally laid down to rest, Bryan had gotten up. Bryan, being the large man that he was, enjoyed the occasional midnight snack - and on a few occasions, was actually awoken by his hunger. This was one such occasion.<br />
<br />
Bryan proceeded to waddle down to the kitchen, feeling his thick hairy thighs rub together as he slowly made his way through the dimly lit house. Being the large man that he was, his gut bumped into several objects -  he even stubbed his toe on a door he barely missed. At last though, he reached the kitchen, and flipped the lights on.<br />
<br />
After raiding his cabinet for anything he could devour, he came to the conclusion that some leftovers was the best option. He placed the refrigerated meal into the microwave, and set it to cook for a few minutes. Realizing he had urges other then his strong hunger, he then heads to the bathroom to relieve his bladder.<br />
<br />
Quickly he realized pissing standing up was not possible - his stomach was far too round for him to even find his cock underneath all that fat. All he was capable of doing was sitting while he relieved himself. He was amazed at just how much a large gut like his cold effect his life. He ran his hands over the large, drooping belly, pressing into the soft flesh. He wore an undershirt, but his belly was still very pliant, and squishy - much like a great big bowl of jelly. It pooled on his lap, nearly covering up all of his thighs.<br />
<br />
When he was done relieving himself, he stood up, with some difficulty, flushed the toilet, and then went over to wash his hands. As he lathered his rough, worn hands with soap, he looked up into the mirror. A kind, old soul gazed back at him. Some may say he reflected Santa Claus - a smile was brought upon his face as he remembered the past Christmas season where he was actually mistaken as Jolly Ol' Saint Nick by a young child. He, of course in his good nature, played the role perfectly - only showing that he truly was happy with his large frame.<br />
<br />
His eyes glazed over his face, noticing how worn it looked. He was balding at a rapid pace - but at his age, it wasn't too uncommon. The beard on his face reflected his hair; a greyish-white, only aging him further. He pulled off his extremely large shirt, watching his thick belly droop and pool over the cool counter. A pit of chest hair and belly fur graced his belly, of which he rubbed with much love. He also had big saggy moobs, with nipples thick and pointy. And yet, you could tell their was some power in his form. His thick arms showed that he hadn't grown too soft in his own age, and had probably been quite a powerful man in his youth. However, his remaining strength and a faded bearclaw tattoo was all that was left to remind him of his younger days.<br />
<br />
Realizing his food was probably done, Bryan returns to collect his meal, devouring it quickly. After his stomach was (somewhat) satisfied, he sat for a minute, and appreciated the direction his life has taken. He loved his body, loved his career, and most of all, loved his family. His sense of pride swelled up when he thought of how much he loved his son, and his grandson. Something felt off about those thoughts, but he was far too sleepy to second-guess them.<br />
<br />
Before heading back to bed, he decided to check on his two boys. He peeks in Jay's room, which was only lit by the bright moon shining through his window. He fixes the blankets so that they were more squarely situated his thin, but muscular frame. Bryan then smiles, remembering his days as a young football jock - although he played the bigger, beefier positions. He was a little disappointed when he realized his son wasn't able to play, say, as a lineman, but was still proud he decided to stick with the family tradition of High School football.<br />
<br />
He then goes in to visit Simon, and instantly realizes he's asleep by his obnoxious snoring. He peeks his head in, seeing the room lit by the dim hue of his computer. He decides to amend the issue by shutting it off himself. Just as he was about to press the power button, something catches his eye.<br />
<br />
SUBJECT IDENTIFIED AS &quot;BRYAN&quot; HAS ENTERED SCANNING AREA. STATS ARE AS FOLLOWS:<br />
<br />
He then sees the long list, showing his weight, age, height - everything he would need to know about him, from both a physical, and mental standpoint. Bryan fixes his spectacles on his old crooked nose, intrigued by the machine. He was transfixed by his feeling of Deja Vu, but decides to ignore it and instead decides to explore the program further. It wasn't long before he noticed it posted Simon's and Jay's information as well.</p>
