<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tad quietly walked across the street and moved a few houses up until he came to the Howler household. He could see the glow of a few lights coming from inside the home, though he didn&#39;t know if that was only Amy or that her parents were also up. He walked quietly up to the door and knocked on it. After a few moments, Tad heard an &quot;I&#39;ll get it&quot; come from inside, and the door opened to reveal Amy standing in the doorway. She wasn&#39;t in much more than her pajamas, but since they were a pair of sweatpants and a white tee-shirt, it&#39;d pass for day wear as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning hot stuff,&quot; Amy gave him a playful smile before turning serious, &quot;thanks for coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; Tad answered, &quot;some of the whole specific pack activities... and the specifically Moon Lake culture is a bit new to me, since I grew up going from Marine Corps base to Marine Corps base.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t your dad stationed in Virginia?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quantico, yes, but that was his LAST posting,&quot; Tad explained, &quot;I think my mom has some pictures of the other bases my dad was stationed at in the US... but that would take some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded and let Tad continue as she stood aside to let her boyfriend in and shut the door behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;But because of that, I&#39;m sure I can help with some pointers and ideas if the &quot;Moon Lake alternative&quot; isn&#39;t available,&quot; Tad said to her, not sure on how to put it. Despite being a werewolf, himself, there were times when he felt that there some things about Moon Lake that weren&#39;t &quot;normal&quot; to him. He put that under growing up outside of Moon Lake, though.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that would be much appreciated,&quot; Amy said to him and lead Tad into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
There he found Gary seated quietly at the table while Elizabeth Howler was pulling some toast from the toaster.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys... Tad is here,&quot; Amy announced as they entered.<br />
<br />
Tad followed quietly and took a seat opposite Gary that Amy offered to him. He did so quietly, not knowing if Amy&#39;s brothers were there too. Gary and Elizabeth both looked to him as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for coming,&quot; Elizabeth said to him, &quot;this whole thing has had us nervous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t want to get caught by surprise the way we did with Amy&#39;s first transformation,&quot; Gary said slowly, as both Howler parents came right down to business.<br />
<br />
Tad nodded and listed to the crackling sound as Elizabeth buttered her toast. Amy moved to sit to Tad&#39;s right and sat close to him. After a few moments, Elizabeth joined them at the table and sat down to Tad&#39;s left, but scooted her chair close to Gary.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will of course realize that this is to be a PRIVATE matter,&quot; Gary said as he gave his wife&#39;s hand an assuring squeeze, though something in Gary&#39;s face showed to Tad that even Gary was still fairly nervous on the whole issue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Tad nodded, &quot;I won&#39;t tell anyone about your concerns for your sons.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both of Amy&#39;s parents then nodded before they moved on.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure that Amy has told you about why we&#39;re concerned,&quot; Elizabeth sighed, &quot;that she transformed early and caught us by surprise. We don&#39;t want a repeat of that with Leon and Jay...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Our sons,&quot; Gary provided.<br />
<br />
Tad nodded at that, &quot;Amy told me she didn&#39;t know if they&#39;d been having the sort of nightmares that would signify the coming transformation... but then, I don&#39;t know if brothers and sisters would share all those things... but I&#39;d assume that if they have had them, they would tell you. Especially if they know what happened with Amy&#39;s transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That they haven&#39;t mentioned,&quot; Elizabeth sighed, &quot;but we neither Gary nor I transformed early and yet Amy did. That&#39;s why we want to be ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if you can give some help should no one be available to help them the &quot;Moon Lake&quot; way,&quot; Gary added, &quot;we would accept it. We&#39;ll keep trying and try to figure out if there are anyone that our sons fancy... besides each other... and have them ready. But so far... no luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I can help you with some tips and advice based on what my dad, and even my mom, did for me,&quot; Tad said slowly, &quot;since I didn&#39;t have some other were to be with...&quot;<br />
<br />
They nodded and eventually look directly to Tad, rather than to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there any way to reduce the pain from the first transformation?&quot; Elizabeth asked, &quot;Amy&#39;s caught her by surprise and to hear her howl in pain...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That pain issue might be more that it came by surprise,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;no one was expecting it, so when the transformation began, despite being a naturally born werewolf, Amy was scared and resisted the transformation. The pain was the result of her inner wolf emerging in earnest while her mind tries to keep her human. In that you know that your sons could transform early could very well mean that they will know when... or can at least expect their wolves to emerge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The surprise was the problem?&quot; Gary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;In that it might have lead to Amy resisting the change,&quot; Tad answered, &quot;the biggest and best thing you can do is assure them that everything will be fine and have them accept the wolf in them when it emerges. That acceptance will avoid the issue of pain altogether.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth and Gary both nodded for a moment and Tad continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Being with them will also help,&quot; Tad continued, &quot;It&#39;s what my dad did for me. Be with them and change as they change. They may know they&#39;re werewolves and will transform eventually... but it&#39;s still somewhat of a shock and surprise when it first happens. Changing with them will give them some assurance that things will be fine and will help them accept and perhaps even welcome the change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not too far from what we&#39;ve commonly done under normal circumstances,&quot; Elizabeth commented, &quot;though... it&#39;s usually been a pair and aimed to allow one to mate with the were transforming for the first time. It lets them burn through the sexual tension as it were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... if it&#39;s just you two... and maybe Amy... there wouldn&#39;t be any sex,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;you&#39;d comfort them as they change, but it would be more through the bonds you have as a family, which I&#39;ve found weighs more than basic lust.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That... that makes sense,&quot; Gary commented, &quot;just about every were family in Moon Lake is devoted to each other... and I MEAN devoted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And where you do this won&#39;t matter too much, so long as it&#39;s private,&quot; Tad informed them, &quot;a place where they can be calm and not distracted by things. If it&#39;s in the woods between the various &quot;spokes&quot; of Moon Lake or at the recreational grounds that Amy&#39;s told me about... or if you go somewhere else... so long as it is quiet and you can assure then, vocally, that everything is fine and keep them calm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything specific we should say if we go this way?&quot; Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d be up to you... but best give encouragement,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;my dad simply gave me repeat of &quot;come on, you can do&quot; sort of thing. But anything that would encourage them to accept the transformation and so forth. The big thing is that you will need to be calm and comfortable as well. If you sound nervous... that will make them nervous.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gary and Elizabeth both looked to each other, and Tad heard Elizabeth gulp.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s what I remember with my dad... in that when I transformed for the first time... I could feel his confidence and that actually made me feel better as I changed,&quot; Tad commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just by his voice?&quot; Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The confidence and calmness in, yes,&quot; Tad nodded. &quot;It made me feel better and helped me through the transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He sounds like he was quite a man,&quot; Gary commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was,&quot; Tad agreed.</p>
