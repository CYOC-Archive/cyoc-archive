<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Are we there yet&quot; Asked Lina &quot;my legs are killing me here&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you two more blocks ten minutes ago&quot; Sofia sighed &quot;I may not be as big as you, but your not the only one with precious cargo&quot;, &quot;fine&quot; said Lina with a pout.<br />
<br />
They had been walking for over three hours, Sofia had told Lina that it shouldn&#39;t have taken this long, but they were continously ducking into alleyways and doorframes due to the number of police cruisers on the streets<br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t be able to hide much longer&quot; muttered Sofia &quot;it&#39;s a matter of time now&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry&quot; said Lina &quot;if our plan works well all be out of here soon enough, that is if everyone can cooperate&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia just chuckled &quot;Ya good luck on that front&quot; she said as they resumed walking &quot;so why the masks?&quot; Asked Lina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well two reasons, one so no one knows who you are&quot; Sofia explained &quot;and second is the secret barcode in the engravings, that&#39;s why the mask takes so long&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right got it&quot; said Lina, before Sofias arm shot out infront of her to push her back, not a few seconds later, red and blue lights could be seen coming down the street &quot;this is the fifth one in the last hour&quot; said Sofia concerned &quot;we need to move&quot;<br />
<br />
( 20 minutes of walking later)<br />
<br />
&quot;Were here&quot; said Sofia stairing at a brick wall &quot;but, there&#39;s nothing here, did you knock a few screws loose back there?&quot; Lina teased, receiving a playful slap on the back of her head &quot;watch&quot; said Sofia as she pressed in a brick, and out shot a little red orb, shooting out red beams in a triangle pattern, scanning them up and down before all the beams concentrated on the engravings on their masks; all the lights turning blue, then the ball shot back into the wall, it&#39;s brick sliding back into place<br />
<br />
Then the ground steamed and began to lower, blue lights appearing on the platform, as they went lower a tile started to slide from the wall near the top sliding over the top of them, taking the place of the platform, like nothing had ever changed<br />
<br />
Then the floor stopped moving, and the wall infront of them split and swung open.<br />
Two women wearing exoskeleton simular to what Lucy was waring stood on either side, they simply looked at both Lina and Sofia and nodded, Lina found theis women to be intimidating, their faces set in stone, and their molds clearly made for battle<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this place&quot; said Lina to Sofia &quot;this is the nest, sort of a last resort safe house for survivor&#39;s from attacks, it also acts as a makeshift hospital for the injured&quot; she said as they entered a wide blue and black room with three pillars at each end <br />
<br />
&quot;I worked here once&quot; said Sofia &quot;I was what you could call a nurse of sorts, but it was never as bad as this&quot; she said Looking around<br />
<br />
As Lina looked around the room she saw, there were women strewn all around the room, almost all were missing parts, bandaged or in the more grim cases, had sheets covering their faces and bodies, the room was filled with cries from both babies and the adults, and grones of pain from the injured <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything we can do for them?&quot; Asked Lina &quot;yeah, get them out of the city as soon as possible&quot; said Sofia sternly<br />
<br />
Suddenly Linas attention was pulled to her right as she saw a woman sat in a metal fold out chair, her hands clutching her midsection, groaning in discomfort, her sort strawberry blonde hair was untrusted and messy, and her tiger print mold was patched and bandaged.<br />
<br />
But what realy caught Linas attention was the individual sat next to her, clinging onto the woman&#39;s arm, shaking with fear, was a 2 year old girl, her once pink onsie was ripped at the arm and the foot, black soot and burn marks dotted around on her clothing and a small layer of red hair peaked out from under her pink hood, but her exposed arm and foot,<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s all skin&quot; marvled Lina, the woman looked up from her pain to give a half smile at Lina &quot;that she is, and she&#39;s my little angel&quot; she said before her face once again scrunched up in pain<br />
<br />
Sofia suddenly appeared at the woman&#39;s side and started asking her questions, Lina once again turned her attention to the little girl, doing her best to squat down to meet her eye level, giving her a little wave, the little girl looked at her for a long time before giving her a small wave back<br />
&quot;Hi there, is this your mama?&quot; She asked her, the little girl nodded before a loud audible growl emitted from her stomach, then she began to cry one again<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t been able to feed her&quot; said the woman, who looked a little more at ease now, but looking at Sofia, who had sweat dripping down her forehead in concentration, she could tell that it wasn&#39;t going well &quot; I&#39;m Catherine by the way&quot; said the woman &quot;I&#39;m Lina and that&#39;s Sofia, nice to meet you&quot; she said before looking at the toddler, giving a big smile &quot;and who is this big girl by here&quot; she said tickling the little girls tummy, getting a small giggle in response &quot;this is Misty&quot; said Catherine sadly &quot;she&#39;s the last of the children we had in our sector&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How many of you survived&quot; said Sofia as sparks flew from where she was working &quot;only me and our carrier Violet&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot; ok your gona have to come with me&quot; said Sofia wiping her brow as she put her goggles back atop her head &quot;where is this Violet&quot; she said, Catherine pointed to her left at a woman with a black mold and black hair ending in purple highlights, her midsection bulging out with what Lina guessed to be quintuplets as she appeared to be arguing with a nurse<br />
<br />
Sofia nodded then turned to Lina &quot;OK you stay with Catherine and Misty and il get violet, iv done all I can with what iv got, but iv bought her an hour at the minimum, plus without milk? I don&#39;t know how much longer that kid can go on&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok go il hold the fort here&quot; said Lina as Sofia rushed off in Violet&#39;s direction<br />
<br />
&quot;WHY are you helping us?&quot; Asked Catherine &quot; well we couldn&#39;t let you die here could we?&quot; Lina replies &quot;as long as one unnecessary death is prevented today well atleast know we&#39;re still doing the right thing&quot; Lina smiled<br />
<br />
Then the room shook, and all was dead silent, a few moments later there was another, then another, and then an almighty crash as the sound of stone and concrete collapsing could be herd, and then chaos.<br />
<br />
&quot;LINA, CATHERINE THIS WAY!&quot; Shouted Sofia as gunshots rang from down the corridor, screams echoed around the room, with one hand Lina shielded her belly and with the other she held Catherine&#39;s hand who held Misty in a vice grip.<br />
<br />
Sofia was waving them down towards some sort of black pad, when they got there Lina could barely hear anything apart from gunshots and screams, then suddenly, all was still, all was silent as they now stood outside the warehouse<br />
<br />
&quot;HURRY&quot; Shouted Sofia as all five of them rushed through the hologram, Sofia pressing a button on the other side, and large metal shutters closed over the doors and windows<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on!?&quot; Said Viki, a frightened look on her face<br />
<br />
&quot;The nest.......the......the nest&quot; was all Sofia could say, gasping for breath<br />
<br />
&quot;Slow down sis&quot; said Momo, waddling over to her sister &quot;what happened&quot; she asked<br />
<br />
&quot;They found the nest!&quot; Said Sofia &quot; blew there way In and wiped it out&quot; she said between deep breaths<br />
<br />
Lina was still I a state of shock as Lucy rushed over, checking every inch of her body before hugging her close, Viki soon following after, all Lina could do was hug them back and try to calm herself<br />
<br />
&quot;Momo this little one needs to be fed ASAP&quot; said Sofia &quot;and Lucy I&#39;m gonna need your help, this one is on borrowed time at the moment&quot; pointing to Catherine as Momo took Misty off her and held her to her breasts, Misty eagerly latching on<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m staying here&quot; said Violet &quot; It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t trust you, being as you saved us but it feels wrong to let her out of my sight&quot; she said pointing to Misty<br />
<br />
&quot; you are her birther aren&#39;t you?&quot; Said Viki to Violet, who gave a nod in reply<br />
<br />
Momo sighed sweetly &quot;I completely understand&quot; she said &quot; those poor women and babies, in the condition the people who go to the nest usually are, I doubt many made it out&quot; she said sadly<br />
<br />
Then Sofia and Lucy rushed Catherine into the parts room, Momo and Misty were in the rocking chair Sofia had asked Violet to grab for her from the top floor, It turned out that Violet had short range Teloportation tech installed, something Sofia had been verry interested in, while Lina and Viki sat on the sofa, hand in hand, watching the news broadcast of the recent events<br />
<br />
&quot;If there was ever a time to get everyone out&quot; Lina started &quot;it&#39;s now, their straight out trying to exterminate us&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we won&#39;t let that happen&quot; said Momo &quot;so now what?&quot; Asked Violet<br />
<br />
&quot;Well first......</p>
