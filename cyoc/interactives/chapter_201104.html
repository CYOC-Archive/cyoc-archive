<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She was feeling horny and it was Valentines Day. She had broken up with her boyfriend, when she realized she was nothing more than an exotic mistress. She thought that she had a real relationship with that son of a bitch. Sab had gone out and brought a special red sheer bralette and panties. The box was sitting next to her and it was making her unusually horny, her clit was most and engorged. Her nipples were pushing into the thin fabric of her bralette.<br />
<br />
Panting like a dog in heat she pulled her hair loose, from a pony tail. Soon her panting face was framed by curtains of jet black hair. She pulled down the cups of her bra and exposed her breasts, twisting the nipples like dials on a old fashion radio. Sabrina got noisy now, her fingers reached down the front of her panties and rubbed her clit. She wanted it inside her, but she had no vibrator. Wait, didn&#39;t the box have a dildo and collar? <br />
<br />
She found it, the collar. Sabrina put it over her neck but didn&#39;t lock it.  She bit her lip and twisted her toes as the collar seemed to light a fire deep within vagina. The young woman let out a shuddering breath as the warmth slowly spread to her core. She leaned her head back and moaned, pressing a hand against her chest. The young athlete pushed her hand down her rock solid stomach as if to guide the heat lower.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Oh god!&quot; she groaned. She spread her knees and raised her hips as her finger tips slid against her perfectly shaved mound. With a gasp, she grabbed the headboard with her free hand and slipped the collar further into her around her swan like neck.<br />
<br />
Breathing heavily, her face flushed red and her ears buzzing, Amber touched herself lightly. She thrust her chest out with a quiet mewling and the warm globes on her chest trembled. She pressed her knees together, trapping her hand between her smooth thighs and then pulled back on the collar, laying her hand on her belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha- what was that?&quot; she gasped as she pulled the collar loose. She ached deep in her guts and desperately wanted to touch herself again. Then she decided to slip it into herself again. The woman&#39;s perfect, straight teeth creaked in her jaw as she tried to lick herself. With a high pitched screech that made her ears twitch, her canines began to grow. They slid from her jaw, forcing the neighboring teeth to shift as they lengthened. Drool gathered in the corner of her mouth, sliding down her jaw until she ran her elongated tongue around her mouth. <br />
<br />
Sabrina lay her head back, panting as the room spun around her. She blinked and breathed until she could see straight. Her tongue lay out of the corner of her mouth until she sucked it back in and her lips bulged around her sharp fangs.<br />
<br />
A tiny point of bright pain spiked her belly. Sabrina ground her sharp teeth together and bent over to find what caused the pain. She touched her belly gingerly and found the skin to be looser in the spot that hurt. As she explored, she felt small bumps form under the skin. The more she touched the area, the better it felt until she began to feel pleasure. She pinched the skin carefully and it responded by sending a tiny electrical jolt straight to her pussy. The tanned patch of skin began to darken and small bumps rose from the surface. She stared at it and the discolored circle widened before swelling. Leaning further she noticed a very small hole directly at the center of the strange skin. She touched it and felt wetness on her finger. As if in response to her touch, the hole begin to twist, gathering loose skin around it.<br />
<br />
A single small, dark nipple rose from her belly.<br />
<br />
Sabrina&#39;s stomach cramped and she cried out, clutching her sides. More dark spots of skin began to appear in two straight lines down her stomach, starting just under her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit! Oh sh- Ohhh!&quot; she moaned, rubbing her feet and thighs together. Her gums began to ache and she pressed her tongue to the roof of her mouth. The roughness of her thick, wide tongue sent chills down her back with each pass. She could feel the new nipples forming and connecting to her body. The new nerves felt like they were hot wired directly to her sex and it was driving her wild as each of her teats swelled from her hard stomach. Tiny drops of milk ran from each of them.<br />
<br />
Hanging her head, Sabrina panted, feeling her hot breath tickle her breasts.<br />
<br />
Black fur lifted between her shoulder blades and she shivered without knowing why. More hairs sprouted in a wide line down her spine to the bottom of her back. The hairs spread out slowly, stopping just short of her sides.<br />
<br />
Her glossy black fur shined in the overhead light. Sabrina rolled her head slowly, breathing deeply of the scent between her legs. Her temples throbbed. Tiny tan hairs sprouted from the smooth mound above her pussy. Short and flat and shiny, the fur grow slowly up to the first set of her teats. Once stopped, it continued in a glossy line to her second set of teats before tapering off. Her new fur grew down around her aching, swollen sex, trapping her moisture in the fine tan hairs. As the tan hairs reached mid thigh, they stopped and spiraled around, darkening to black before moving up towards her ass.<br />
 <br />
Sabrina closed her eyes and moaned, leaning her head back again. She squeezed her breasts and then slid her hands down her chest. She gasped as her fingers touched her short, silky fur and then groaned and bucked, spreading her fingers wide to run them over each of her teats. She felt cold metal against her fingers and her eyes snapped open.<br />
<br />
Each teat was capped by the same nipple collars she wore on her breasts. She could see the holes around the bars, as if they&#39;d always been there.<br />
<br />
She went to touch the collar and then hissed when her fingers popped. She stuck the fingers of her right hand in her mouth, wincing when her fangs bit into the skin. Her tongue swirled against her sore joints and fingers until she felt loose skin dragging against her coarse tongue. The pain lessened and she pulled her hand free.<br />
<br />
Translucent skin sagged from the palm of her hand. She reached to touch them but tiny pinching twinges made her hand spasm. She held her wrist and watched as inky blackness seemed to fill the pockets of skin. Calluses rose from her hand, thick and wide along the top and bottom of her palm and in little bumps under her fingers. She touched the padding, surprised at the soft, leathery texture. She stared, fascinated with them, flexing them as much as she could. The movement seemed to bring forth another change as the skin bulged below each fingernail. Thick, black tips cleaved her skin and nails and she whined as her claws inched forward.<br />
<br />
But then, the heat pulsed within her. Inexorably. Something clicked deep within Amber and she lunged forward, knocking the box from her bed. She pushed her chest down while raising her ass and spreading her trembling thighs. Her teats dragged against the towel and made her bark in pleasure. The girl blushed and then moaned. Pure, clear liquid dripped from her aching pussy. She reached a clawed hand under her, sliding through the tan fur on her belly and then jerking as the thick pads on her hands grazed her clit. She moaned loudly and it warbled, dog-like. Her ears twitched and slender black hairs began to grow along the edges of them. The tips of her ears stretched, every so slightly, into rounded points.<br />
<br />
Sabrina&#39;s ass rocked slowly side-to-side. The bulge above her hips swelled into a rounded stub, lined in the same black fur that covered her body. Her labia trembled and she carefully pressed a finger within her folds. She could feel how utterly swollen she was. Bones clicked within her hips and she felt her pussy move, shifting slightly upward. She panted and shook on the bed. Her lips bulged and moved, pressing together while folding over into a distended bitch&#39;s pussy. She pressed a clumsy finger into the middle of her new pussy and yipped, amazed at how tight she felt.<br />
<br />
She brought her hand back up to her mouth and licked between her fingers, cleaning her paw. The young woman stopped mid-lick. Her brain felt fuzzy but slowly began to clear and a sense of alarm started to spread at the back of her mind. She went to all fours and then her knees, paws on her thighs. All eight of her nipple rings caught the overhead light. This is wrong. This is all wrong and I-<br />
<br />
A knock at her door made her bark in alarm and Sabrina sat back, covering her mouth in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh- who is it?&quot; she asked. Her large tongue felt awkward in her mouth, making her voice sound slurred. She scented the air. Jeff. It&#39;s Jeff, oh no.<br />
<br />
The man knocked again but Sabrina grabbed her towel and wrapped herself in it, biting her lip painfully as the fabric slid against her teats.<br />
<br />
I had a date with him tonight! She remembered. Oh. Oh shit. Oh no.<br />
<br />
The girl went to the door and opened it slightly, peeking through the crack.<br />
<br />
&quot;J- Jeff,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amber, hey. You don&#39;t sound so great,&quot; he replied, frowning. &quot;You gonna let me in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no,&quot; Sabrina answered. She could feel her stubby tail moving under the towel and, as she bent forward to get the towel off of her teats, it brushed her pussy. She moaned and her hips dropped slightly. &quot;I&#39;m- I&#39;m sick. I&#39;ll have to talk to you later. Goodbye, Jeff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sabrina, wait,&quot; Jeff yelled as she closed the door.<br />
<br />
She ran back to her bed, dodging the spilled contents of the box. The young woman dropped the towel and dove under her covers, ignoring the sudden buzzing of her phone. Her heart pounded and her tongue hung loose outside her mouth while she panted from the stress of the situation. Oh god, what do I do now? I&#39;m so fucked, oh god!<br />
<br />
And yet, she couldn&#39;t stop her hand sliding down her hard, furred stomach towards her sex. Her cheeks flushed with red and she whimpered, fighting the undeniable urge to fill her aching wetness. She fell to all fours and her limbs shortened. <br />
<br />
Across the street, a dog barked and Amber rolled over, raising her hips slightly. <br />
<br />
God. God, yes. I&#39;m just-, she panted, rocking her body against the bed to tease her nipples. The dog continued to bark and Sabrina yipped in reply. She&#39;d worry about what to do later. Now. Now she had to ease the pain between her thighs. She would find her Valentines day lover at the doggy part.</p>
