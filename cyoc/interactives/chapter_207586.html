<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After what felt like one second of dreaming you found you self waking up, and you felt odd, everything did, but why, was there a reason? And then it came back to me I have swapped body&#39;s with my little annoying brother, and sighed feeling his now my long hair on my back, I opened my eye not ready for how everything looks so much more brighter, thinking maybe younger eyes is the reason, and looked straight down at my new body seeing my brothers small body, with his legs and arms what look like twigs but I could feel the small muscles what he now I guess I got from gymnastics and, with my long hair going over my eyes and I could not help but let out a annoyed moan what came out in a small much higher sound, and found myself grabbing  my long hair and put it into a perfect bun, and I realised what I just did, I had no idea how to do anything with long hair and I just did that without thinking, this shocked me, looking down seeing the white shirt on me feeling how loss it is not use to it, normally wearing tight cloths what shows of my body. <br />
<br />
Rasing my hand up and feeling the perfect bun have realized how soft my hair is now, what still shocked me, the woman... Nick came in to my eye site and said “well it looks like it was a susses” looking at her now having to look up at her seeing how she looks like a giant now, but knowing it is because I am now my small 11 year old brother, she kept her smile on and said “so, how do you feel Sam?” I did not know what to say, I was still in shock about doing something what I had no idea how to do it, and felt small and scared, realizing how big everything is now and how I am no longer the big and maculing man I once was, she was still wating for an answer, so I just blurted out “fine...i guess” with it coming out shaky and hearing my brother&#39;s voce coming out of my mouth what made me want to cringe.  <br />
<br />
She looked more closer to me like she was studying my face an till she looked like you get the answer she was looking for and said “oh, I must be massive to you now, you are the first drastic swap in size I have done, god I so sorry for not realizing you little thing, but don’t worry you will get use to your new sizing very fast, and it will help you and me if you get out of that bed, for one it will get you use to your new size and I can check if everything is working right, ok my little darling?” she is talking to me like I am a kid but she is not wrong that this was very overbearing seeing how much more smaller my body now is now and how everything is so much bigger now! But her loving look at me is making me feel safer for some reason,  <br />
<br />
every time I saw mom giving Sam that look I felt like puking, but now I am getting it from this woman it felt nice, I nodded yes up at her, not wanting to hear my now young voice again. <br />
<br />
And I scooted my body to the edge of the table and sat on the edge, and relize my leg did not reach the ground, and looking down, ground looked so much more further away now but I am not going to let this fear stop me wanting to get this over with, and I slumped of the edge and landed on my two legs and nearly fell forward, not use to being such a hight and feeling much less heavy what actually felt quite nice feeling so light, and had to take a step forward nearly losing my balance but my front foot kept on going, sliding across the floor and my over foot stayed where it was going behind me, an till by ass was on the floor and my legs where in the splits! feeling quite scared. Never being able to do this in my old body, I was in less than an hour ago, I would have to go to the hospital and in major pane, but I also felt amazed because I am right now doing the splits something I could never do all my life at the same time no pain at all, it feels like sitting down on the floor normally. <br />
<br />
I could not help but smile a bit for doing the splits and knowing I was always a little jealous of him being able to do such things, I wonder what else I can do now, remembering all his gymnastic training he does daily, leaning to the side and putting my legs under me standing up and feeling quite normal now, not at all dizzy or feeling too small I felt just right, I look at Nick and see her trying to hold in a chuckle and said “well that is a way to get use to your body, inset it now, anyway come over to this mirror and I can check you over to see if everything is working right, and you can look at your new self now” I said “ok, but I have a question when I woke up I did this (me pointing at me hair bun) and I did it without ever thinking?” feeling more confident to speak and more after the splits, but still not liking my new voce, she just guided me to the mirror while saying “honey, do you remember we talked about muscle memory and how you are going to get some of Sam&#39;s sub conscience and motor skill, so that must have been one, and it seems like a good one, learning to look after hair can be a nuisance, and it is a sign that it is working properly”  <br />
<br />
This sent a rush of anger throw me, how could she say this is how it works Properly! She telling me this. just brought back memories why I did not like the idea of acting like my brother, and I realized I have been already acted like him, now looking in the mirror and only seeing my brother staring back at me, I did not expect I will see myself, but something what reminds me of well me, but it was just my brother looking back at me, with his normal default face and seeing how I have my hands like he normally does without realizing, with them just staying out side if his pockets, I tried to make my young brothers face now mine look at all like my old one, it just ended up looking like I was pulling faces in the mirror, so I just ended up looking at my new face feeling soft skin where my stubble was and seeing perfect fresh eyes where bags have been under my old ones, and then there was my body now, small, much smaller than mine, what I already knew, and Nick was right I have got use to my size already, looking at her taking notes while prodan me asking small questions what was mostly only yes and no answers, but the top of my head only go up to her tummy now, seeing the diffracts in the mirror, and I know I was like a head taller than her before? but what is the point in dwelling in it, letting out a sigh letting myself feel sorry for myself,  <br />
<br />
And again, I new this was my brother&#39;s body affecting me, I know I would not be ok with this, but why do I feel so calm now like how my brother is all the time, what is one of the top reasons why he pissed me off, and now I am doing the same.  <br />
<br />
But I could not help myself feeling so calm, and lifted up my shirt a bit seeing a small soft 6 pack, and felt it with my other hand, and it just feels soft but could still feel every muscle, thinking well this is not as bad as I thought it was going to be, and was going to left my shirt higher an till I saw Nick looking at me, what looked like she was waiting for me to finish whatever I was doing. <br />
<br />
I forget she was even there having stopped prodan me and asking small questions about, well I don’t know how long age, I must have got to adsorbed on my reflection, but I quickly pushed my shirt down, feeling embarrassed seeing my broth...my face starts to go rad, she just gave me a smile and stocked my hair and said “it’s ok honey, its quit normal, I have had some people get so adsorbed that they end up naked before they realize that I am here” that did not really help thinking back, a minute age knowing I properly would have gotten naked as well with how engrossed I felt that second, and new that I would have to look at my new body naked at home anyway and realizing that this is my body now and I am going to have to get use to it because im not stuck like this for ever, and also knowing this is my brothers sub conscience making me think like this, but it just made since to me now, and said “can I go home now?” wanting to get away from the embarrassing situation, she looked at her clip bord and said “yep, everything looks good here” as she took my small hand and we headed to the door while she said “your brother woke up 2 or so hours age, so and your mom and brother have been waking for you.</p>
