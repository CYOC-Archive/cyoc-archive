<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I managed to get my arms in between us and pushed her away. “Yeah, but you still look like my sister. I don’t care how weird this is, I’m not making out with you.”<br />
<br />
Katie frowned. “Spoilsport. You parade around wearing extremely fuckable naked hottie, then won’t let me...” She paused a moment, stepped back and crossed her arms. “So how did this happen?”<br />
<br />
I stepped around her and headed back down the hall, acutely aware that Katie was watching my wide, bare ass as I bounced my way to the bedroom. Once inside the bedroom I picked up the T-shirt and pulled it over my head. It took me a bit to wrestle my hair loose from the shirt, the cloth was stretched so tight over my new assets, and it was barely long enough to cover half my ass, but it was better than having Katie look at me like I was a dessert buffet.<br />
<br />
“I think it was this.” I gave the VCR a nudge with one bare girly foot.<br />
<br />
Katie knelt down next to the machine and ran a hand over the top.<br />
<br />
“Where did you get this?”<br />
<br />
“Treasure Palace,” I said. “From this woman who looked—“ A little rocket went up in my head and I remembered the thought I was having right before fainting in the bathroom. “A woman that looked exactly like Trinity from the Matrix.”<br />
<br />
The idea came through to Katie right away. “You think this thing Trinitized her; the same way you got the full Lindsay?”<br />
“It didn’t occur to me at the time, but yeah, now I do.”<br />
<br />
“So how does it work?”<br />
<br />
I bent down, pressed the button to eject the tape in the strange pop-up slot, and pulled it out. “This tape has Mean Girls. I turned it on, started watching, and poof: insta Cady.”<br />
<br />
Katie looked at me with a raised eyebrow. “You were watching that? Are you sure you weren’t a girl to begin with?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, very funny.” I started to fold my arms over my chest, which would have gone better without all the breastage in the way.<br />
Katie sifted through the collection of tapes, pulled one out and stuck it in the machine. A few seconds later, an old episode of Friends appeared on the screen, with two of the women arguing. Katie moved toward the screen. “So if I watch this, I could turn into Monica?”<br />
<br />
I shrugged. “I guess so.”<br />
<br />
“Cool,” said Katie. “She’s hot.” She plopped down cross-legged in front of the screen. “Wow, great picture.”<br />
<br />
“How do you know you won’t turn into Joey?” I asked.<br />
<br />
She tapped the front of the TV. “You think that’s possible?”<br />
<br />
I shrugged again, feeling my boobs rise and fall as I did. I dropped onto the end of the bed, my soft thighs pressed warmly together. “This thing didn’t come with a rule book, but what are you going to do if you do get changed? Nobody’s going to believe it’s you.”<br />
<br />
“You would,” said Katie. “Besides, at least it would be something different. It’s so boring being me.” She turned toward me long enough to give me a mocking leer. “I’ll turn into Jennifer Aniston and we can run off together. I can help you learn to use all the new gear, and we’ll make a million bucks selling pics to the tabloids.”<br />
<br />
I didn’t reply, though as Katie leaned forward and stared at the screen expectantly, I found myself idly brushing one nipple through the cotton shirt. The light touch sent tingles that seemed to jump across to the breast I wasn’t touching, and I swear I could feel actual oven-grade heat growing between my legs. The feeling wasn’t at all like the tight feeling that came with a hard on. This was more a kind of liquid heat that flowed out over my smooth legs and taut stomach. What would it be like to try out this body? If Katie was to get turned into someone else... The longer I thought about it, the longer I thought it would be a crime to get this made-for-sex body and not see what it would do—like being handed the keys to a Ferrari and leaving it in the driveway.<br />
<br />
But while I was getting more and more ready, Katie was getting more and more impatient. “Nothing’s happening,” she said. “Are you sure this is what did it?”<br />
<br />
“Has to be,” I said. “I sat down, started watching the movie, and then I... Oh.”<br />
<br />
“Oh what?”<br />
<br />
“I kind of, I mean...” I licked my puffy lips in embarrassment. “There are a lot of hot girls in that movie. So I sort of, um.”<br />
<br />
Katie looked at me for a few seconds with a puzzled expression in her mascara circled eyes. Then she gave a snort. “You mean you jerked off?”<br />
<br />
From the heat I could feel on my face, it was a good bet my cheeks were as red as my hair. “I kind of started, but just when I was getting there...” I gestured at my body. “Blam.”<br />
<br />
“How could you whacking your doodle make any difference?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” I admitted. “Maybe it was just a coincidence.”<br />
<br />
“We’ll, if pounding your meat is what it takes, we’re short one dick.”<br />
<br />
Katie scowled at the machine.<br />
<br />
I swallowed. “How am I going to get back to me?”<br />
<br />
“Why would you want to? Isn’t that body about ten thousand times normal than your usual?”<br />
<br />
“Well, yeah, but Katie, I...”<br />
<br />
“Just hold on. I need to do an experiment.” To my surprise, Katie stood up and walked out of the room. I could hear her banging around in her own bedroom, but before I could decide to see what she was up to, she came back into the room carrying a gleaming silver tube.<br />
<br />
She held it up. “You want me to do it, or are you ready for a test drive?”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
Katie pressed her thumb against one end of the silver thing. At once there was a kind of throbbing hum. “Guess it’s going to be me,” she said. Then she reached up with her free hands, unbuttoned her jeans, and let them fall to the floor.<br />
<br />
“Katie!”<br />
<br />
“What? We’re all girls here.” She sat down in front of the TV with her legs spread apart and immediately began applying the business end of her little tool.<br />
<br />
Even if Katie was my sister, I couldn’t help but feel the heat between my legs crank up a notch. It was like something down there knew exactly what Katie was feeling, and it wanted in. “This,” I said in what I thought was a really calm tone, considering, “is the weirdest day of my life. By a factor of about ten million.”<br />
<br />
“Uh huh,” said Katie. Actually, it was more of a grunt.<br />
<br />
If what was on the screen had something to do with what the machine would do, then Katie didn’t have to worry about turning into Joey, because someone had edited all the guys out of the show. One of the women, too. It wasn’t actually an episode of Friends on the tape, it was clips out of several episodes, all of them featuring just Monica and... whatever Jennifer Aniston’s character was called. The scene changed about every ten seconds, but it didn’t seem to be bothering Katie. From the way she was breathing, it seemed like she didn’t care much about any problems with the plot.<br />
<br />
Keeping one eye on Katie, I reached down between my legs. Embarrassing as this was, I had never felt the need for anything so strongly. My fingers touched that warm, hot place and I swear I felt the touch all the way to my ears. I slid just one joint of my index finger into the soft folds, and without any thought on my part, my back arched. I drew in a long, shuddering breath. When the program on the tv suddenly changed, barely noticed. That’s when a bolt of weird blue lightning came from the screen and hit Katie. And me.<br />
<br />
I had just time to think “again?”<br />
<br />
Intermission two.</p>
