<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Eric&#39;s 40-year-old dad rolled out of the undercarriage, oiled and dirty since he&#39;s doing the yearly maintenance of their family car.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Eric stopped by the door, careful not to get close and get himself oiled. And if what the clerk said is right, touching another person while wearing the ring will initiate the merge. He does not want to merge with his father, yet. &quot;I&#39;m going to Danny&#39;s. We&#39;re going to have our hair taken care of at the strip mall today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t you get your cut last week?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did. But we&#39;re not going to get our hairs cut.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a moment, your father got the gist of what you&#39;re talking about. &quot;There&#39;s two hundred bucks on the table. You two kids get massaged while you&#39;re at it. You two boys must be fatigued from all that preparation you got for the state championship.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Eric&#39;s dad may be serious at most times, he has his moments where he becomes an adoring figure. &quot;Well, gee thanks, dad.&quot; Too bad. If the ring works, that means Eric will only have to spend half of this treat. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just promise me that your team will bag that trophy,&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Eric may call himself unique but if there&#39;s a word describing a higher state of uniqueness, Danny has that record. Of all the people he acquainted with, Danny retains that luscious golden hair since he was a child. Eric&#39;s hair used to be blonde too, but it got darker with age. Danny is your poster American boy of the 1940s. His golden hair complements his innocent sky blue eyes. Even though he&#39;s a member of the wrestling team, he never got to Eric’s stocky build. He&#39;s tall yet lean, and he wins his battles by technique rather than strength. He&#39;s just that kind of guy. <br />
<br />
Eric knocked on the door and Danny came to answer it. It&#39;s a Saturday and Danny tends to spend the time lounging in the living room on his sleeveless white shirt and boxers while watching professional wrestling on TV. Eric&#39;s used to the attire even if he could see his bulge poking on the boxers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Eric, what brings you today?&quot; While wearing the ring, Danny&#39;s pasty shoulder flushed pink the moment Eric touched it. Danny&#39;s breath grew shallow and his stance became laggard.<br />
<br />
Eric smiled. &quot;No, reason. Just visiting my dear old friend,&quot; Eric walked inside and sat on the sofa. The next won&#39;t start for the next hour so it&#39;s just a series of commercials for now. Danny sat beside him, a little too close for Eric&#39;s comfort. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it just me or did it suddenly turn hot the moment you visited?&quot; Danny looked at his phone and it says 70 degrees Fahrenheit. To be honest, Eric is kind of feeling the heat too. He looked at his arms and saw how reddish they are. Not to mention this raging boner inside his khakis. &quot;Would it bother you if I undress right now? Who am I kidding? Of course, you wouldn&#39;t. We see each other naked at the shower all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe, Danny means that he sees Eric naked all of the time. Danny is quite sensitive when it comes to his body and Eric fails to see the reason why is he so goddamn embarrassed. Upon seeing him naked, Eric is reminded that Danny shares the same achievement of having one of the biggest dicks on the team. His groin is free of oddities and lacks any embarrassing scars. He may be ashamed then but now? His hands are hanging lazily on the sides, his chest is wide open while his rod is standing like a flagpole devoid of its flag. It&#39;s red which makes it somewhat cute. Eric grew only harder at the sight. This pressure inside him is nearing its limit. Eric followed in undressing his clothes, uncaring about embarrassments in being naked in another person&#39;s house. Undressing helped in dissipating the heat but could not settle down his throbbing fat cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not gay but, you got a nice cock. I&#39;ve always been itching to say that. If I was gay, your cock is among the list of the things I want to suck.&quot; Danny ended with an awkward chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, do you want to suck on it? I won&#39;t judge.&quot; <br />
<br />
Danny gulped. Slowly, he crept closer to Eric and swallowed the tip. For someone doing this for the first time and for someone denying the fact that he may be a little gay, Danny is pretty good at this. His head bobbed with skill as if he was doing this for a living. He hit all the right spots, the spots that made Eric coo a gurgling moan. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck! Man, you&#39;re good at this.&quot; Eric dug his hands on Danny&#39;s golden locks and helped aim his mouth. &quot;It&#39;s so hot. I feel like my dick is melting inside your mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Little did Eric know, their bodies are perspiring not sweat but slow melt of their skin. Eric&#39;s eyes are closed and Danny was too preoccupied with the feast of such delicious cock for them to realize that their body now looks like melted ice cream. By the time Eric neared his climax,  his legs have completely melted off. <br />
<br />
&quot;AH! AHHHH!!&quot; Eric screamed at the top of his lungs but the sounds that came out were of the gurgle of his drowning throat, drowning in the melting cesspool of his own body. He released his seed before Danny&#39;s head and his dick has completely melted off. The last fleeting visions Eric saw is his head splashing on the floor - then darkness.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The sounds of cheers from the television woke Eric a moment later. The match is starting and he felt ecstatic to see it happen. Wait… That is strange. Eric remembers hating professional wrestling. It&#39;s obviously fake. But somehow, there&#39;s this voice inside his head saying that he loves wrestling. He loves seeing those men grind their oily bodies together. Eric could remember the names of every wrestler that appeared in that show. He remembers their moves, their history as if he&#39;s addicted to the show. Eric is sure that he doesn&#39;t. The only person he knows with such interest in a public display of dry humping is Danny. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa,&quot; Eric said when he saw his hands. They are a tad bit white but not as milky as Danny&#39;s. The callouses are still there but most have disappeared. Then his arms - the muscles he had flattened a bit but the strength brewing in them has grown two-fold. He could lift the coffee table in front with ease. As he did, he saw his new length dangling between his legs. Eric is bad at measuring length but he is sure that it is as long as the length of his forearm. His dick felt like it cummed just a moment before but he feels like it still has juice for it to cum more. <br />
<br />
Eric walked into the kitchen, and by luck - he thanked the heavens that his parents are on a trip leaving him alone in the house for a week. There in the kitchen, a full-length mirror stands beside the refrigerator. The reflection that appeared before him more or less still looks like him but with Danny&#39;s features added to the pot. Eric&#39;s hair has grown a little bit longer but the tone grew a few shades lighter. Then his eyes, are still orbs of amber but with flecks of blue and green at the outer edges. His somewhat pig of a nose changed drastically. They are now sharp which accentuates the new manliness of his figure. Overall, he still looks like a 13-year-old kid, maybe a bit older than that. But now, he stands on a different pedestal than other children in the neighborhood, for he is not only strong but he now has one hell of a handsome face. <br />
<br />
Walking in the living room, he picked off his clothes and realized that they also fused. His shirt is now colored white and the sleeves are gone. His khakis changed the material of the fabric. Then his underwear is a tad bit bigger to compensate for his manhood. Good, fuck. It&#39;s so long that it could curve nicely to have a rest between his ass cheeks. Fuck! If he willed it, he could even fuck himself. How neat is that<br />
<br />
Eric dressed and went back home. Along the way, some of the neighborhood kids saw him. Ian even asked him who the hell he is, or if he&#39;s a new kid in the hood. The look on his face when Eric told him who he is.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric, you&#39;re back early.&quot; Eric&#39;s dad said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I already had my hair taken care of,&quot; Eric excused. &quot;I just forgot to bring my phone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s dad rolled off the undercarriage and he nearly screamed when he thought that there&#39;s a stranger in his garage. &quot;Holy fuck! What in heaven&#39;s gracious name did Phillip do to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You don&#39;t like the hair color he gave me?&quot; Eric said while patting the locks of his hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I like the hair. Love it, really. I actually told your mom that you&#39;d look better in blonde than her shitty brown. And boy was I fucking right. What I mean is that you look different. I am a loss for what it is.&quot; Eric&#39;s dad stood and failed to realize that his son is now standing at the same height as he. &quot;Whatever Phil dyed your hair with, I&#39;m getting the same the next time I visit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Dad, you&#39;re bald.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s dad grimaced. He patted his head where his palm immediately grasped the empty scalp. &quot;Yeah… You got me there. I don&#39;t want to take up your time. Dan- Da-?&quot; He looked at his son with confusion in his eyes. &quot;Do you have someone with you? I remember that you&#39;re off to see someone. Good lord, I&#39;m getting forgetful these days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric was surprised. It seems that Danny&#39;s existence was erased from his father&#39;s mind. He decided to go along with this change in reality, &quot;Maybe you&#39;re remembering wrong, dad. Anyways, I need to leave again.&quot;</p>
