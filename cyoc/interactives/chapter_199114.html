<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan ended up in a break room with four other guys. They all seemed to know each other. Big dudes, probably all played football in high school or went to the same gym or something. They seemed nice enough, as Dan made a bit of small talk, but then everyone was called in at once.<br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t any sort of light or buzzer or anything, everyone in the room just started gradually changing. Black hair for everyone, that was the easiest thing to see first, and at one point, Dan saw the facial hair on everyone else in the room grow out or just sort of retract until they all had the same matching sinister goatees. The resort seemed pretty prone to playing into terrible stereotypes. Cartoonish villains to chase the guests around and all that. Dan though wasn&#39;t turning into a member of the goatee squad. His face felt baby smooth, and his stomach felt a little upset.<br />
<br />
There were a bunch of little basins scattered around the room, and he found himself bent over one with an oddly smooth flow of black goop pouring out his mouth. He&#39;d been afraid this would feel like violent vomiting or something, but it was a lot more passive, like he was drooling, just that there was an awful lot of it. It was hard to focus on more than the stream of thick gunk coming out of his mouth, and how impossibly much there seemed to be, but he did notice he had to stumble forward now and then as his height dropped down, and had done his research well enough not to be entirely surprised as his body reduced to that of a child, maybe 10 years old, but it was still certainly odd when he finally had a chance to step back and take in the room from a lower point of view. He also noticed a rather uncomfortable sensation as the white hemp shirt he was now wearing had what proved to be some sort of green wooden idol of a bird under it, prompting him to wonder if it had formed from his clothes or been ejected from his own body.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Dan made eye contact with the others and was gripped by intense fear. &quot;There he is!&quot; they shouted, and started stumbling over the furniture to chase after them. Dan bolted for the door, clutching the idol these goons were after and out into the streets. His little legs weren&#39;t really enough to keep a distance from the four big goons, all brandishing swords, so every chance he got he would slide between someone&#39;s legs, or smack some wicker basket full of fruit down behind him.<br />
<br />
Eventually, as he took a tight corner, he was snatched right up off the street by another burly man. He exploded in a series of blind punches and kicks at the air, but eventually calmed down when this mysterious stranger ducked into an empty warehouse and explained he wasn&#39;t with the other goons. He asked Dan where he got the idol and who he was, to which he of course replied that it was the sacred idol of his village and his name was Kenji. The guy who grabbed him explained he was after some evil cult who wanted the idol, and he&#39;d keep him and it safe. Kenji thought this guy was pretty trustworthy and agreed. They spent the next several hours dodging goons, tricking them into falls off the ends of docks and the like. Eventually, things seemed calm and safe. His rescuer took the idol back to Kenji&#39;s home village by the river, wedged it into place, and plopped his entirely too large hat onto Kenji&#39;s head before boarding a riverboat and sailing off waving.<br />
<br />
A little while after a tearful goodbye, he was oddly compelled towards a door that lead to a nicely appointed break room and had a seat on a nice comfy couch to watch TV. Several minutes later, it randomly struck him that his name was Dan, and this was just the resort where he&#39;d started working that day. A chill ran down his spine as he thought back over his first assignment. He&#39;d known that part of the job involved skills and memories being implanted in his brain, but he&#39;d figured it would be like being fed a script, or being made to speak lines on autopilot. Here he didn&#39;t feel like anything was at all out of the ordinary until it was over.<br />
<br />
Was it over, though? His mind seemed to be back to normal, but his body was still that of a child.<br />
<br />
&quot;First time?&quot; asked a voice behind him which, somewhat strangely, proved to come from a giant talking squirrel.<br />
<br />
Dan nodded. &quot;Why am I not changing back?&quot;<br />
<br />
The squirrel shook its head. &quot;You&#39;re still on the clock, right? Reconfiguring our bodies is something of a costly process. The system won&#39;t change you if a guest doesn&#39;t need you, and it tries to avoid major mass shifts when it can. You&#39;re probably going to be a small fry until you earn some real time off, or there&#39;s a high demand for something bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Dan could respond to that, he felt himself being called back out on duty.</p>
