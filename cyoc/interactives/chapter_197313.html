<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joe awoke to the friendly sound of birds chirping and a warm welcome from the soft golden light of sunrise. It was almost enough to make him forget the confusing day he had had yesterday.<br />
<br />
He got up and stretched. His comforter fell off and he felt his dick swing downward. His dick was back!! Looking in the mirror Joe was 100% Joe again.<br />
<br />
Even though Joe was relieved that the body swap wore off, he couldn’t stop thinking about how his dad had so passionately had oral sex with his current body. Joe had always thought of himself as strictly straight, but he saw yesterday how clearly pleased his body was to suck cock and have a man suck its cock. Thinking about this made his dick hard. So much for being straight...<br />
<br />
Suddenly Joe had a devious idea. Investigating his parents room he saw his mother back in her body sleeping away, but his dad must’ve already been downstairs. Depending on when they transformed back, Joe’s dad may still think that they’re in each other’s bodies. This is what Joe’s devious plan hinged upon.<br />
<br />
All of his other siblings were already at school, since Joe was the only one graduated. Going downstairs, Joe tried to impersonate what his mother’s body language looked like in his body yesterday.<br />
<br />
“Good morning sweetie,” said Joe to his father.<br />
<br />
“Uh, good morning,” said Bob tentatively. His left eyebrow was a bit cocked.<br />
<br />
“You’re not gonna give your wife a kiss?” asked Joe, still unsure whether he could pull off this ruse.<br />
<br />
Bob leaned in for a kiss. Joe had butterflies in his stomach. Was this really happening? His dad looked so handsome up close, and he was treating Joe like his wife. Joe accepted the kiss, allowing his father to invade his mouth.<br />
<br />
What was supposed to be a little good morning kiss was turning into a make out session. Joe found himself running his hands through his dad’s hair and tracing the outline of his ears with his fingers.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes Bob came up for air, “Woah, somebody’s excited today. I like it.” He gave his son a peck on the lips.<br />
<br />
“Can I sit on your lap while you read the paper?” asked Joe. The words were out before Joe had time to even realize what he was asking.<br />
<br />
“I would love that,” said Bob, scootching his chair back.<br />
<br />
Bob was completely nude in the wooden chair. Since Joe was also nude, he would be able to feel his father’s junk on his bare ass. Carefully, Joe sat down his football player bubble butt down onto his hairy dad’s lap.<br />
<br />
As Bob read the paper, Joe could feel his father’s boner pressing up between his soft cheeks. Joe gyrated his hips to exacerbate his dad’s condition.<br />
<br />
“Looks like somebody wants a little more than just sitting on my lap..” said Bob seductively.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me Bob,” said Joe. It was weird calling his dad Bob but he had to keep up the act or his dad would find out that it was no longer his wife in this teenage male body, but his son instead.<br />
<br />
Bob planted another kiss on Joe’s lips and said, “Damn, it feels good kissing lips with some stubble on them. I’ll get some lube.”<br />
<br />
Apparently there was lube right in the living room, and Bob motioned Joe to come over.<br />
<br />
Joe let his father prep his virgin asshole while they continued their make out session on the couch. His dad’s meaty fingers felt amazing on the hole.<br />
<br />
Bob grabbed his son’s legs by the ankles and lifted them up and back towards his son’s head. His mighty cock head pressed against his son’s tight hole. For a few moments, Joe was convinced that his dad’s big cock was too much to enter his hole, but when his dad started to lick the bottom of his feet, Joe’s hole opened wider and Bob’s cock slid in.<br />
<br />
It was painful and pleasurable. Joe asked Bob not to hump just yet, so they made out again while Bob was inside him. Joe couldn’t believe it. Yesterday he was a football playing straight jock, now he was tricking his father into fucking his big ass.<br />
<br />
“This hole is so tight. I haven’t had a hole like this in..well never,” Joe’s dad started to pump his hole, slowly at first but working up the speed and power when he saw Joe adjust. By the time they were fucking full speed, Joe was moaning like a whore.<br />
<br />
When the two men were close to climax, Bob got real close to Joe’s ear and said, “I know it’s really you, son.” He must’ve seen them transform back in the night but wanted to take his son’s supple body for another ride, this time up the ass and with his actual son inside.<br />
<br />
Hearing that his father knew all along but still fucked him made Joe explode in orgasm, “Ohh daddy! Fuuuck!”<br />
<br />
Seeing how pleased his son was made Bob orgasm too. Joe could feel every ounce of hot liquids coming from his dad’s big cock, his legs vibrated in pleasure.<br />
<br />
The men looked up from their passionate love making to see none other than a horrified Cindy, seeing her husband fuck her son with more animal passion than he has ever with her.</p>
