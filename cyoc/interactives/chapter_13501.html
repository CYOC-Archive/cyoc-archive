<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rudy tried to keep his cool and develop a plan to get control of the machine for himself.  But he couldn't come up with much.  He had a way to control Tony, but Tony seldom had possession of the thing and Rudy didn't know in advance when he would.  All he knew was where Tony kept it when he did have it, in a special compartment under his desk.  So, Rudy kept inviting himself over to see Tony.  That part was easy enough.  Tony now saw him as a friend, maybe not quite on the level of fire haired Jack, but certainly someone who could drop by any time.<br />
<br />
Rudy would drop by and, all too often, find Claire at Tony's house or find that Tony wasn't there.  He was off with Claire.  Rudy felt a raging jealousy toward her.  She was always hanging on Tony's shoulders, draped over the body that so enticed Rudy, patting that hyper-round ass right in front of him.  <br />
<br />
It was after witnessing this in Tony's room that Rudy's patience cracked.  He left after a few tactless words to Claire that left her staring open mouthed after him as he stormed out.  As he marched down the stairs, he could hear Claire asking Tony's brother Mark &quot;What's the matter with him?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hell hath no fury . . &quot; Rudy heard Mark mutter with a giggle.<br />
<br />
Rudy's mind was made up right then.  To hell with you ballet boy.  To hell with you bitch.  So, when he found out the next day that Jeff was going to be out of school a few days attending a family funeral Rudy correctly guessed that the chronivac would be moved over to Tony's room.  He wracked his brain trying to come up with a plan as the school day wore on.  But, in the end, he didn't need much of one.  Tony told him that he was going to go to the library after school and Rudy knew that Mark would be at his ballet class.  He just needed an excuse to have the St. Martins let him into Tony's room.  But, again, not much forethought was necessary. <br />
<br />
Rudy made up an excuse to miss the soccer team's practice and showed up at the St. Martins' door at 3 o'clock and told Mrs. St. Martin that he thought he had left a notebook somewhere in Tony's room.  She let him in and didn't even watch him as he went upstairs.  She was too busy braiding Cindy's hair.  <br />
<br />
Rudy unzipped his backpack and felt underneath Tony's desk.  Sure enough, there it was.  In a sort of wood sleeve nailed under the desk, there was the chronivac and emitter.  Rudy carefully slid them out and into his backpack.  &quot;Yes!&quot; he whispered and made his way quickly downstairs.<br />
&quot;Sorry to have bothered you, Mrs. St. Martin.  I must've left my notebook somewhere else.  I couldn't find it&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony's mother just shrugged and with that, Rudy bounded outside and then down the street.  At home, he spent hours in his room going over the menus and options.  His mind whirled with the possibilities.<br />
<br />
The next day, Rudy's first class was a study.  He went to the library and saw freshman Mark St. Martin sitting alone at a study carrel, not studying but catching up on his sleep.<br />
&quot;Hell hath no fury, eh?  Let's see how you like it little ballet twink&quot;<br />
Rudy set his backpack down on a table about 20 feet behind Mark St. Martin.  As he typed away, Rudy rationalized that Mark would have to be out of the way, anyway, so he might as well take care of him now.  Rudy's heart raced as he raced through option after option for Mark.  Finally, he pointed the small plastic antenna looking emitter toward him and hit enter.  <br />
<br />
Rudy had intentionally set the full change for 6 hours time to coincide with the school day, but some of Mark's transformation was immediately obvious.  Slumped over onto the desktop, Mark's jeans were snug against his narrow but still muscular ass.  They were even more snug when his hips widened a bit and his buns plumped out into a full round feminine shape.  <br />
<br />
Rudy smirked and even gently laughed out loud.  It was safe.  Mark was half asleep.  He only awakened with the sound of the bell ending first period.  Rudy smirked anew.  Mark's nose had shrunk to a cute little button nose just right for a girl.  He trudged off, yawning and completely unaware of what was happening.  <br />
<br />
It was only two classes later, after third period, that Rudy saw Mark again.  And now Mark had a worried expression on his face.  His shoulders had gotten narrower and it looked to Rudy as if Mark's jaw and mouth were a bit smaller, too.  Mark nervously ran a hand along the blue jean seam outside his newly widened hips as he gathered his stuff for gym class.  Mark was one of just a few freshman among the juniors in Rudy's gym class.  As luck would have it, that day, the class was doing college style wrestling and 140 pound Rudy got paired off with formerly 119 pound, now 125 pound Mark.  It seemed a fair match to the gym teacher because even though Rudy had 20 pounds on him, Mark was a much better athlete.  But this time, Rudy threw Mark all over the mat.  Mark's balance was completely off with a new lower center of gravity to which he hadn't adjusted and a weakened upper body.  After Rudy pinned Mark, Mark almost cried.  Back in the locker room, Rudy smirked some more at the sight of the new shape that Mark's sprinter/high jumper body had as he emerged from the showers.  Mark was now a bit of an hourglass shape, though he still had his penis and scrotum.  The other thing Rudy noticed was Mark's large, flushed nipples.  Something else was just about to happen.<br />
<br />
From his table among the soccer team and drama club guys in the cafeteria, Rudy watched Mark obsessing over the front of his shirt, repeatedly pressing a palm to the front of his black, &quot;Clash&quot; t-shirt. Mark's hair was growing out, too.  By the period after lunch, Mark's close cropped cut was now almost touching his shoulders.  <br />
<br />
As Rudy had intended it, Mark's mind was unchanged with just one exception.  Mark had no recollection of the chronivac.  He was caught in an inexplicable nightmare, transforming into a girl in the course of the school day.  Somehow, nobody seemed to notice what was going on, not the widening of his rear or the two apple sized breasts that bobbed at his chest, not the change to the shape of his face or his new small hands and feet.  He knew he looked ridiculous in his athletic boy's clothes, but when the change was almost complete, Mark suddenly noticed that his black, Clash t-shirt had become a tight fitting pink one that proclaimed him &quot;Kissable&quot; in big white letters.  His jeans had become something that the tag inside indentified as &quot;Lady Levis&quot; and his converse all stars had become Reebok Walkers.  All that was left of his masculine body was his package and that seemed to be shrinking as he walked nervously into the hallway after his last class.  Out of the blue, a senior football player lifted him off the ground and put his mouth to Mark's.  He gave Mark a deep french kiss.  Mark gasped, stunned at having had a boy's tongue in his mouth.  He gasped anew at the sound of his high pitched voice as he told the boy off and then grew still because of an odd feeling, an . . absence.  Mark gingerly brought one hand to his crotch as he reached his locker.  Nothing.  Mark sobbed.  His body was completely that of a hot slender freshman girl.<br />
<br />
Just as he did, Rudy appeared.<br />
&quot;Are you okay, Mary?&quot;<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;Whatever it is, I bet you'll feel better after you go to ballet and show up all the other girls by being such a great prima ballerina&quot;<br />
&quot;Um, thanks, Rudy&quot;<br />
As Rudy walked off, Mark looked into his now pink gym bag.  On top of his other stuff was, not a dance belt and boy's black tights but a tutu and toe shoes.<br />
&quot;What the . .!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rudy laughed once he was down the hall then walked outside and, in the distance, saw Claire waiting for Tony.</p>
