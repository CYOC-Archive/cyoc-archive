<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Mary had an intriguing idea. Assuming these worked, she had a feeling that drinking the entire contents of a vial would turn her into a natural member of that species.  She conjectured that drinking half the contents would change her into partly.</p>

<p>She found a vial marked skunk and picked it up.</p>

<p>Mary knew that what she was doing was crazy. For all she knew these vials were full of poison. However, she also knew that if they were then someone was going to a lot of trouble to harm her.</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath, Mark shook off her apprehension. She'd never know what would happen if she did the safe thing and threw the vials out. Famous last words she thought but she'd also never had any luck in playing it safe.</p>

<p>She decided to do it. Mary drank half the contents of the skunk vial. It tasted terrible, however, Mary knew that often in life, it was pain before pleasure or pleasure before pain. This time, Mary choose the former.</p>

<p>Putting down the vial, Mary waited to see if anything would happen. She knew that one of three things would occur. One, nothing would happen, two, it would make her sick (or worse) or three, it would change her.</p>

<p>Mary waited for ten minutes. She was starting to think this all a deception and was ready to get a real drink when she felt the first indication something was about to happen.</p>

<p>Her stomach grumbled and she felt a sharp pain above her rear end.</p>

<p>"Ack!"</p>

<p>Since she was alone, Mary pulled her pants down and stepped out of them. The pain was still there, however it was much weaker. Something was pushing on Mary's panties. Her chest was starting to itch, in fact <i>everything</i> was begging to itch.</p>

<p>Mary threw her shirt off and began scratching at her arms and belly furiously. Before her startled and disbelieving eyes, Mary saw white fur sprouting all over her chest while black fur sprouted on her belly!</p>

<p>"Whoa, it's real!" Mary gasped.</p>

<p>Mary's definition of possible and impossible changed in a matter of seconds as the fur coated her torso and then started moving down her arms. The pain above her rear end turned into a tearing. Mary turned her head to see a bushy tail bursting free and growing below what was now a fur covered back complete with a stripe.</p>

<p>Her tail just kept on growing until it was longer then her body. She could feel it as it grew. Mary gasped with how incredible it was that she actually had a tail and fur.</p>

<p>The changes to her body were not done. Mary's ears and mouth ached. Her humans ears became like jelly as they melted into her skull, taking her ear canals with them. The world went silent for her and Mary feared that she'd rendered herself deaf.</p>

<p><i>Shit, shit shit!</i></p>

<p>Mary's mouth and nose burned, she yelled out in pain as she felt bones popping and changing shape. <i>If I knew it was going to hurt this much, I'd have never gone for this!</i> The pain was too much for Mary to bear. She staggered into her living room, and collapsed onto her couch before passing out.</p>

*

<p>When Mary awoke, she heard birds chirping.  She felt groggy and shook her head, whipping her long hair back and forth. <i>Well, at least I can hear again! Wait a second, my hair is short, not long!</i></p>

<p>Mary stood up and looked at her hands. White fur now covered the tops of them. Small but sharp white claws stood in place of her fingernails. She turned her hands over to see fleshy pads on the bottom of her hands. Mary did her best to examine the rest of her body. Her hair was now long, half way down her back to be exact. It had turned white and was softer then it'd been in years</p>

<p>She now had a small muzzle on her face.</p>

<p>"It worked, I can't believed it!"</p>

<p>Mary wanted to see her reflection. She walked unsteady on her new feet. Her tail had changed her center of gravity. A peek down at her chest confirmed that her breasts were a little larger, although Mary had a feeling that this was because of the fur more then anything. She walked around for a few minutes to get used to walking in her new body. Once she had, she walked upstairs and into her bedroom where she had a body length mirror.</p>

<p>Admiring her reflection, Mary smiled. She had white fur on her hands midway up her forearms,  her feet midway up her lower legs, her chest and on the lower half of her face and around her eyes. The rest of her had black fur with the exception of the white stripe down her back and up her long bushy tail. <i>Not bad at all.</i> While she thought she looked perfect unclothed, she knew that others would not feel the same way.</p>

<p>"I could have a lot of fun with this form," Mary said to herself.</p>

<p><i>I wonder if I should share this with anyone? Todd would love a chance to see a real life skunk person.</i></p>

<p>Todd was a friend of Mary's that she knew to be eccentric. Mary knew that he'd jump at the chance to try one or more of the vials out. <i>Knowing Todd, he'll want to try the skunk one and a female one and become like this.</i> Mary didn't mind that idea. She wondered what it would be like to go out on a night on the town as a pair of skunkettes.</p>

<p>Mary ran over to the phone and dialed Todd's number.</p></p>
