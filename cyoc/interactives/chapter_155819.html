<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Sure, let&#39;s swap lives and see what happens from there! I&#39;ve always wanted to know how it felt like to be another guy; an older man and to live another man&#39;s life. However, I only want to keep your head and nothing else.&quot; John replied. &quot;It&#39;s a deal!&quot; David excitedly exclaimed. John then told his father David that they had to pretend to be one another while others were around. As David walked away, John ran up to his new room and viewed the full length mirror to admire the changes. He had his dad&#39;s head, beard and his short black hair. All of this was resting on top of his youthful body. The contrast excited John.<br />
<br />
The difference between his new head and his body was a strange and yet interesting experience for John. He would have to try other changes in the future. This gave John an idea. Rather than live the same life that his Dad had lived, he was going to implement more changes with the silver band. After all, who said he couldn&#39;t tweek his life a little? He then used the band to alter his family. John focused and changed his family&#39;s dynamic. His mom was now amicably divorced from his dad and lived in a different house, while his father and him lived together in their original home. John and his dad were still swapped and remembered the swap but his father&#39;s memory was altered so he had no idea that the divorce was caused by the band. In addition, John could use the band and choose whether or not the other person remembered the swap. John also aged his original body and head from 18 to 21 years old.<br />
<br />
As fun as it was having his father&#39;s head on his body, he wanted a better matching body or at very least play around with different parts. He didn&#39;t want to look completely the way his father had appeared, so he decided to go hunting for some nicer body parts. John rubbed his hands with anticipation as he hatched a plan. He got into his father&#39;s car, which was now his and sped off to the nearest indoor mall.<br />
<br />
At the mall, John looked for potential guys to swap with. He walked over to the cafeteria and observed the candidates for his next swap. John saw an obese man in his 30&#39;s hungrily gnawing away at a quarter pound burger and decided to see what it was like being obese, so he used the silver band to swap everything below his head with his intended target. <br />
<br />
In a flash, John was standing with the man&#39;s huge body and clothes while the stranger with John&#39;s muscular body continued eating like nothing had ever happened. John wobbled around and walked into a family restroom to get a look at the changes. <br />
<br />
Inside the restroom, John took off his shirt and pants. He looked at the mirror and began gawking at his new body. His father&#39;s head was resting on a body that had man boobs, large nipples, a sagging stomach, hairy armpits, some sparse hair on his chest and a huge butt. John jiggled his fat stomach and chuckled at the new sensation he was feeling.  John slapped his butt and said &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to do that with a huge butt.&quot; before putting his clothes back on and leaving the restroom.<br />
<br />
At this point, John was easily getting tired from walking around using his new fat body, so he sat down. Beads of sweat continued dripping from his face as John was wiping his forehead. He thought about quickly swapping with someone else to lessen his burden; however, his current swap excited him so much that he was going to bear it for now. John wanted to show his father what he had done so he tried jogging to his car but had to slow down after a short distance as his current legs and feet had difficulty carrying John&#39;s massive weight. In the car, John&#39;s shirt had started forming a sweat stain in the front and back and rolling down the windows did not help at all.<br />
<br />
Once John had reached his home, he called his father several times to come down the stairs. Not knowing what was so urgent, David replied &quot;Okay. Okay. What&#39;s the rush?&quot; before making his way down the stairs. When David had reached the bottom of the stairs, he turned and walked into the dining room and was greeted by his newly obese son. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck did you do to yourself!?&quot; David exclaimed with a look of confusion, surprise and slight disgust. He saw that his son still possessed his old head but it was attached to a massively overweight body. John only snickered and said that he just had to see look on his face and wanted to know what his coworkers would say about his new mass. &quot;Well, that&#39;s fine and all, but how are you even going to survive an 8 hour shift, day after day, looking like that? You&#39;ll wear yourself out before the end of the workday.&quot; David countered. <br />
<br />
John thought for a moment and sighed. He knew what his father was saying rang true. It had already been a pain trying to jog at the mall. 8 hours of work using his new pudgy body was going to be a lot worse. He would have to settle for a body or a stomach that didn&#39;t have so much density. John told his father that he was off to the grocery store to fix his obesity before driving away in his car.<br />
<br />
At the store, John walked through the aisles until he found someone that he wanted to swap with. He spotted a sweaty fat man bending down to grab a dropped box of cereal; his butt crack showing as he was bending over. John used the band to swap with the stranger and was instantly given the man&#39;s body. Meanwhile, the stranger fell over due to his new and unexpected weight. The man still had his original head but it was now attached to a body with much more mass than his original one. Thanks to the power of the silver band, John&#39;s new victim was none the wiser about the swap. John was satisfied with the swap and ran to the nearest restroom to check himself out. The run was tiring in his new fat body but not as much as when he was still obese. <br />
<br />
When John reached the restroom, he took off his clothes and spun his attention to the mirror in front of him. He was greeted by a hairy chest, a treasure trail and a large stomach. This unfamiliar body also sported a new butt and John turned and bent down while looking at the mirror. The voluptuous butt no longer belonged to the stranger but to John. It was now &#120361;&#120362;&#120372; butt crack that the mirror was reflecting. The thought delighted John and got him slightly aroused, so he gave his enormous butt a slap and it wiggled. John couldn&#39;t wait for the next swap. He wanted to be reborn using the body parts of other men.</p>
