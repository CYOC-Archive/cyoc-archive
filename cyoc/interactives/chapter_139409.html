<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Upset and scared, Chad reared up on her back hooves and tried to take a couple steps forward. Her front hooves clicking as they knocked together, Chad listened as Diana nickered behind her and wondered if she should be bothered by the fact that she understood what it was Diana was saying. Dropping heavily back to the floor, everything shaking as her thousand pound or so weight came down, Chad nickered in agitation and shook her head. Telling herself, &quot;Again,&quot; she forced herself back up, thinking, &quot;Think like a human. Believe that you are a human. Not a horse,&quot; as she did so.<br />
<br />
Her front hooves again slapping together, Chad tried to take a step forward, managed a sort of shuffling motion and as she dropped back down, she neighed, &quot;No,&quot; and tried to use her left front hoof to arrest her fall by placing it against the nearby wall. Misjudging, she watched in frustration and alarm as it punched through the wall and finding herself stuck, she softly neighed as she thought that had the other horse been able to, Diane would surely be laughing.<br />
<br />
A series of quick steps backward and Chad eventually got her hoof out of the wall. Looking about the room, spotting the door frame as she noted Diane was slowly walking out of the room, Chad considered stopping him from wandering to far, &quot;And maybe getting into something he shouldn&#39;t,&quot; he whinnied, she instead trotted over to the doorway. Using the side of her head, she gauged how strong it would be before deciding it would likely support her in her efforts. Thinking, &quot;Enough,&quot; she reared back up on her back legs and tried to place her front hooves on the hard wooden surface.<br />
<br />
Her hooves shifting as they slid first one way, then another, Chad tried to keep herself upright as she also tried to take a step forward. Dropping back down, she nickered in agitation and considered the possibility that she might be going about this the wrong way. Tossing her head, she extended her neck as far as it would go, rolled back her lips so that her teeth were showing and angrily neighing, &quot;So what other way am I supposed to try,&quot; Chad tried to think of other ways to reassert her humanity. Finding herself drawing a blank, she peered about, looking for Diane and seeing the other horse nuzzling the patio door, she became alarmed when Diane managed to slide the door open. Watching as the stallion cantered out the open door, smelling the scent of fresh cut grass, Chad thought about how hungry she was and considered going outside to get a bite to eat before continuing.<br />
<br />
Another quick shake of her head, Chad thought, &quot;No,&quot; as she realised that these thoughts were in some way tied to the horse she&#39;d become and turning her attention back to the problem of regaining her lost humanity, she nickered softly, tried to come up with an answer that would help her, but, drawing a blank, she whinnied in acceptance that, for the moment, the only option she could think of was the idea of trying to walk like a human.<br />
<br />
&quot;And hope that from there, the rest of my human self re-emerges,&quot; she thought as she breathed heavily in and out through her nostrils for a bit before once more trying to get herself to stand on her back legs, keep herself up and take the necessary steps forward.<br />
<br />
The minutes slipping past as she tried and tried and tried, it was somewhere between half and hour and forty-five minutes before Chad was finally able to get herself up, hold herself up and, after a bit of trial and error, managed to take a couple steps forward. Her front hooves threatening to slip, she bared her teeth. Thinking, &quot;You&#39;re a human, so walk like one,&quot; and spotting Diane&#39;s pants, she nickered, &quot;That&#39;s your goal,&quot; and taking a couple more unsteady steps, she grunted in discomfort as she struggled to keep her focus on remaining upright on her back legs.<br />
<br />
Again, she dropped to all fours after a bit and neighing in frustration, she tried again and managed to take a couple more steps before once more being forced downward. Starting to feel once again like she wouldn&#39;t succeed, Chad laid her ears flat, bared her teeth and told herself, &quot;Don&#39;t think like that. You cannot remain a horse. Think what your dad will say when he discovers you. Or what mom might say,&quot; and squeezing her eyes shut, a feeling settling over her that it somehow helped, Chad began to imagine that she was still human as she reared up. Ignoring the sound of her front hooves striking one another, she forced her mind to picture herself as a human and remember how she walked. Taking a step forward, thinking about the way she placed her foot, she mentally went over how her body shifted.<br />
<br />
Unaware that her weight had started to decrease, Chad thought about how her fingers moved, the way her toes wriggled and the way she put one foot in front of the other when she walked, giving her a slight wiggle in butt. Hooves starting to morph back into feet and hands, she stumbled a bit, but thinking it was because she was trying to walk on two legs when her body insisted it was a four-legged animal, she adjusted her gait as her udder regressed, human nipples appeared and started to push outward. Shaking her head, muttering, &quot;You are not a horse,&quot; she stopped after a couple more steps and opened her eyes.<br />
<br />
Disorientated, Chad briefly thought that everything around her didn&#39;t look right. Taking another step, her body finishing its transformation back into a human as her ears rounded, dropped to the side of her head, her tail regressed back into her body, muzzle shrank and separated into a small nose and a set of dainty lips, Chad gazed down when she became aware that she could feel the living room carpet beneath her feet. Seeing two B cup breasts, she nearly gave a whoop of delight, but managed to restrain herself as she felt somewhere at the back of her mind the mare she&#39;d been lurking, ready to come forward. Understanding coming to her that she was now a were-horse and that she could, with practice, learn to control when she turned, she had a moment of perplexity when her mind insisted that her sudden transformation was due to the fact that she&#39;d lost control, but then it slipped from her as she realised what she was staring.<br />
<br />
It suddenly feeling like she was torn, Chad moaned and gingerly touched the two mounds of flesh. Nearly wailing, she gazed about, her long chestnut hair whipping about as she did. Whimpering, &quot;What the hell. What the hell. What the hell,&quot; it quickly hit her that something was wrong. Understanding coming to her as she struggled to figure out what, she turned and ran from the living room and toward the bathroom, uttering, &quot;No, no, no,&quot; as she did so.<br />
<br />
Inside the bathroom, she didn&#39;t bother closing the door and instead clicked on the light and peered into the mirror. Seeing a sixteen-year-old girl gazing back, Chad whispered, &quot;That&#39;s not me. That cannot be me. I&#39;m not a girl. I&#39;m a boy,&quot; and looking down, she stared at her breasts a moment before hesitantly touching the smooth, flat, hairless skin of her groin, then slipping the small hand between her legs before pulling it back as if she&#39;d been scalded.<br />
<br />
Terrified by what she was seeing and had felt, feeling even more torn as she started to remember growing up as a girl, Chad stepped back from the mirror as she recalled what had happened to Diane. Her mind instantly leaping to whatever it was that had caused Diane to go equine had also somehow transform her into a horse, Chad whimpered, turned, as if in a daze, stumbled out of the bathroom and down the hall. Her mind slowly gravitating to the notion that she had always been a girl, Chad eventually stepped into her room. Finding it had somehow been turned into a teenage girl&#39;s bedroom, a theme of horses and ponies dominant throughout, she closed her bedroom door and slumped over to her bed. Flopping down on the soft comforter, liking how it felt against her naked body, she eventually rolled over onto her side and curled up into a semi-fetal position. Asking herself, &quot;What the heck is going on? Why is this happening? And am I a boy or am I a girl?&quot; she squeezed her eyes shut and tried to sort out and come up with answers.</p>
