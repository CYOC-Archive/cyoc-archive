<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anna disappeared for a bit, and returned with nearsighted man in a lab coat with thick glasses holding a clipboard.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you want to be a draft horse?&quot; he said skeptically adjusting his glasses. &quot;Shetland pony would make more sense.  We need more of them now, lots of birthdays in the next few months. Uh, one week only. Never mind.  Draft horse? We&#39;ll need to do some force feeding to get you up to weight.&quot;  He sighed and looked at Anna.  &quot;You&#39;re sure about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I am, sir!&quot; Randy says eagerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was talking to Anna.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Vincent, I&#39;m sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighed, &quot;Very well.  Now in order to get you out pulling the plow or cart or whatever, we&#39;re going to accelerate your equine transformation, which means unlike Anna, you will lack the power of human speech.  It may develop at the end of the week but not before.  As far as anyone will be able to tell you are just a horse, not a human one.  So I&#39;ll have to tattoo your gums, so you don&#39;t end up gelded.&quot;<br />
<br />
You jump back with a start, and ask, &quot;You geld people?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We geld horses.  If you&#39;re not breeder stock.  Only one in twenty males keep their balls, human-horse or natural horse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna nuzzled his back, &quot;See, I told you that you might want to rethink making this permanent.&quot;<br />
<br />
You swallow hard.  A ninety five percent chance of being ball-less.  You shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;d best get started.  Follow me, and you can start undressing, time&#39;s a wasting,&quot; Vincent said tossing a rope over Randy&#39;s neck, and leading him toward the door from which Vincent entered.<br />
<br />
&quot;See ya, stud,&quot; Anna said, &quot;I got more humans to counsel.  If Doc Vincent finishes with you in time, I&#39;ll see you in the corral for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, see you later, Anna, and thanks.  Thanks from the bottom of my hooves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vincent tugged for Randy to move faster. <br />
<br />
Randy had completely unbuttoned his shirt by the time they reached the double glass doors marked &quot;EQUUS LABORATORY&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry, get naked and up on that scale.  Got to make sure I give you the right dosage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Randy kicked off his shoes pulled off his shirt, and undid his belt and jeans. Then he pulled off the jeans, and left them in a heap on the floor.  He climbed on the scale.<br />
<br />
&quot;Underwear too,&quot; Vincent said. <br />
<br />
Randy pulled it off and tossed it over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you raised in a barn?&quot; Vincent complained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish,&quot; was Randy&#39;s reply.<br />
<br />
Vincent snorted. &quot;Hold still, let me get this reading. Now exhale.  Exhale completely. Aha, yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
He turned and headed over to a lab counter.  He was furiously writing and calculating. He nodded, ah, yes, this should be right, he seemed to mutter, but Randy wasn&#39;t quite sure.  He hoped that man hadn&#39;t said something about an udder.  Horses didn&#39;t have udders, did they?  He knew of course the males didn&#39;t, but could he be transformed into a mare.  He opened his mouth, but decided against saying anything.<br />
<br />
Vincent glanced over his shoulder. And shouted, &quot;Get off the scale, fold your clothes, and get on the big white table.  We haven&#39;t all day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Randy answered hurriedly getting down, and picking up his clothes and rapidly folding it. He set it in a chair by the door, and climbed on to the big white table, it was cold under his bare ass.   He muttered to himself, &quot;Yes, dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vincent came over with a test tube tray filled with six different syringes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, best lie on your side.  When your skeletal structure reshapes, you don&#39;t want to be on your back or sitting up.  Now I will inject different parts of your body to begin your transformation.  You&#39;ll basically become a Clydesdale colt,&quot; he said.  Randy opened his mouth to speak, and Vincent raised a finger to his lips and continued, &quot;Hush.  Now after you&#39;re a colt, we&#39;ll do a rapid growth treatment.  You&#39;ll be a two-year old draft horse by five o&#39;clock. Now mind you this sort of rush growth will hurt.  You&#39;ve heard of growing pains?  Once I inject you, there&#39;s no backing out.  You&#39;re sure?&quot; <br />
<br />
Randy nods and lie sideways on the table. He positions Randy&#39;s arms and legs outstretched sideways across the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir, I&#39;m ready, &quot; Randy said nervously.<br />
<br />
The first shot was in his neck. Then one in each arm, and each thigh,  The last one was in his penis.  He let out a yelp.<br />
<br />
Vincent laughed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Now while you lie there and the serum starts to work, I will hook up the catheter, and colonoscopy bag.    We&#39;ll clean you out, and then as you change introduce new flora and fauna to your intestines, so you can properly digest grass and other horse feed.  Oh, and now this is special horse catheter, it expands as the urethra grows, but it&#39;s a bit larger than the standard human one.&quot;  He explained as he shoved a large rubber hose up Randy&#39;s ass, and the shoved a plastic tube down his piss chute.  Tears were streaming down Randy&#39;s cheeks, but he was happy, even if it hurt.  He was going to be a draft horse, a real, honest to goodness, draft horse.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; Vincent said examining the straps holding the tubes in place.  He then attached wireless monitors to Randy&#39;s chest.  &quot;Since I cannot be in the room, when the irradiation light activates the serum in you, this will let me know if you have any problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looked at Randy one more time, and pulled out a sugar cube, and put it in Randy&#39;s mouth and petted his head, &quot;There&#39;s a good stallion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Randy mumbled, &quot;Thanks.&quot; As he sucked on the sugar cube.  The doctor left.  A moment or so later, the lights flashed, and changed color.  He was bathed in a sort of purplish black light.  He felt his skin tingling all over, and his innards churned.  He had to go to the bathroom - oh, yeah, he could just go.  And he did, and did, and did.  <br />
<br />
Ouch, his bones started to snap and twist and grow. Randy shifted to a fetal position, and fell asleep.  He didn&#39;t know how long he slept, but the lights were white again, and someone was pumping a warm liquid into his ass.  He blinked, the room was now monochrome.  He stared at his hoof - it had been his hand. He turned his head and whinnied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t try talking, you cannot, and won&#39;t be able for quite some time.  You may even have trouble speaking after you&#39;re human again.  And most guys don&#39;t mind this side effect, except they have to invest in a new wardrobe, because of the rapid growth treatment to get you to Clydesdale status, you may end up a bit heavier and taller when you&#39;re changed back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your eyes widen, and you make a horse snort sound. Vincent attaches a hose with a feed bag over your muzzle.  Then he attaches some IV&#39;s to your colt body. You are surprised by how Vincent smells now.  It reminds you of a cross between the locker room, and a petting zoo.  Horses do rely more on scent than humans, you realize.<br />
<br />
Then he produces some giant syringes, and starts injecting you again. This time, the penis and the balls, and the ass. You whinny loudly, and thrash your tail violently.<br />
<br />
Vincent rubs his red cheek where your tail struck him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Usually, I have assistants to make sure this doesn&#39;t happen, but since Anna asked me to do this for you, I couldn&#39;t have any assistants.  Plausible deniability, you see.  It&#39;s their jobs to make sure the subject gets the proper treatment, and well, technically, it&#39;s not my job.  So instead of whatever your parents wanted you to be, you&#39;re going to be a draft horse.  Well, I best get to my other patients.  I&#39;ll be back in a few hours. Uh, I don&#39;t think the blacksmith will be able to shod you today, but probably first thing tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vincent leaves Randy alone.</p>
