<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to Juan Tiller for the help</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The magic show ended and the audience walked out of the auditorium only to be met with a grand buffet. Food and drinks were being handed out for free. Those who bet everything they had were happy they’d earned more chips and hadn’t lost themselves to the House.<br />
<br />
As the celebrations started, Deng-Long and the others were attempting to leave the casino as quietly and discretely as possible. The Kirin could barely contain his rage at the unfortunate turn of events. Somehow Akita had changed the tigers into a gods-be damned Nekomata, which was only possible with the help of a Book. He turned left down a darkened hallway.<br />
<br />
“Boss, it’s going to be okay.” Mothar was saying. “We still have a few chips left. Let’s not be hasty!”<br />
<br />
“No, we don’t.” Deng-Long whirled on the ogre. “I bet it all you stupid fuck! Somehow Akita figured out a way to beat my trap!”<br />
<br />
They came to the end of the hall. <br />
<br />
In front of them was a janitor’s closet with a cardboard star on the door. Akita&#39;s dressing room.<br />
<br />
“This is it boys and girls. Take up your positions.” Deng-Long spat to the other four. “Anyone goes in or out, we ambush them and take their chips.”<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” A familiar voice spoke..<br />
<br />
Deng-Long turned.<br />
<br />
MB Dolan stood at the end of the hallway.<br />
<br />
“Damaging Mag Mell property is a serious offense.” MB Dolan said. “I’d rather you not damage yourselves before we sell you.”<br />
<br />
“Oh?” Deng-Long smiled. “Big words, oaf. Dmitri still lost. He’s nothing but a Blank now and I technically own his chips. And, moreover, I never bet them. So no, I’m not your property.”<br />
<br />
Deng-Long held up Danny’s human chips. “See?”<br />
<br />
“Ah yes, the deal you made with Danny.” MB Dolan shrugged. “Voided.”<br />
<br />
The chips disappeared from Deng-Long’s grasp.<br />
<br />
“What?” Deng-Long stared at his empty hand.<br />
<br />
“You forgot the rules. You can’t steal a new player’s only chips.” MB Dolan wagged his finger. “I have security camera footage. Your ogre pushed that poor man to the ground, assaulted him right here on casino property.”<br />
<br />
“He ran into <I>me</I>!” Mothar sputtered. “I didn’t push him!”<br />
<br />
“And you had your musk activated. And you shoved chips into him to make him more agreeable.” MB Dolan sighed. “Really very rape-y stuff.”<br />
<br />
Deng-Long thrust his finger at the hugely muscular man. Sparks leapt from his finger and…fell harmlessly onto the floor and sizzled.<br />
<br />
The Kirin stared at his finger.<br />
<br />
The sound of Chips dropping to the floor made everyone look down. Deng-Long’s golden Body, Mind, and Soul chips, with his rare species and magical abilities fell to the floor. Decades of magic and experience and strength faded away.<br />
<br />
“No!” Deng-Long stared at his Chips in horror. He tried to grasp them but they disappeared just as his fingers brushed against them. His magical knowledge was gone along with his magic. “They’re gone! What’d you do with them?”<br />
<br />
“You broke House rules. You cheated. You forfeit all your chips.” MB Dolan said, voice cold. “You’ve nearly tarnished out reputation. You rigged a game. That’s unacceptable.”<br />
<br />
“So what’s next?” The fuckbot asked.<br />
<br />
“You boys caught me in a good mood today and I need some practice for the real players that I’m going to have to fight soon.” MB Dolan took a deep breath. “So…if you’re able to defeat me, I’ll just let you all go. If you can’t, I’m Banning you. You forfeit your chips, but instead of becoming Blanks, you’re never allowed back. Your names will be listed prominently in the lobby and your crimes made public.”<br />
<br />
That’s it?” Deng-Long shook his head. “I know how strong Books are. We’re taking a big risk.”<br />
<br />
“You want me to sweeten the pot, eh?” MB Dolan stroked his beard. “Okay. If you win, you get all of your chips and the Book. If I win…I punish you in whatever manner I see fit.”<br />
<br />
Deng-Long pursed his lips and eyed up MB Dolan. The Book MB Dolan carried was one of the weakest in terms of strength. If he managed to pull this off, he’d be rich again.<br />
<br />
“So do you accept the terms or not?”<br />
<br />
“Sir,” The Drider scuttled up to him and whispered in the dragon-horse’s ear. “I don’t think this is a good idea. We never planned for this.”<br />
<br />
Deng-Long shoved her away. “I accept.”<br />
<br />
“Good.” MB Dolan took a deep breath. “Then let the game begin!” <br />
<br />
“Fool!” Deng-Long sneered. “It’s 5 versus 1! This is going to be a piece of-!”<br />
<br />
MB Dolan rolled his eyes and pointed at the Kirin. “Alter.”<br />
<br />
Deng-Long fell flat on his face. The dragon-horse flailed his limbs uselessly. He looked at his legs and arms and screamed.<br />
<br />
His muscular arms and legs were receding into his body, starting at his extremities. The kirin’s chest and ab muscles thickened, helping him straighten himself into a sitting position against the wall, his pants sliding off as his legs shrunk away. His cock and balls flopped out.<br />
<br />
Deng-Long’s goons gasped as their boss struggled, his ass firming and plumping up beneath him. The final vestiges of his limbs drew back into his body leaving smooth, unblemished scales and fur behind where his arms and legs used to be.<br />
<br />
MB Dolan chuckled.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck? You think this is funny?! How is this fair? I can’t fight or move at all!” Deng-Long shouted at Dolan.<br />
<br />
“If you give up now, that’s the last spell I’ll use on you.” MB Dolan held up another Book. “I was given a copy of my  other selve’s spells. Not nearly as powerful, but when I tell you there’s enough magical force and variety here to do whatever I want to you, I mean it.”<br />
<br />
“W-we should run!” the Drider whispered, picking up Deng-Long. “I don’t like this, Denny!”<br />
<br />
“Fuck that!” Deng-Long whispered back. “And we use our stage names!”<br />
<br />
“Let me reiterate for the hard of hearing: give up now and you’ll be treated well when you’re owned by the house.” Dolan shrugged. “If not, I’m going to transform you all into something different.”<br />
<br />
“Denny!” the Drider hissed.<br />
<br />
“Only one of us needs to beat him.” Deng-Long hissed back. “The odds are still on our side!”<br />
<br />
“I’ll rush him.” The ogre whispered. “I watched him change you. He needs to point and say a command word. I won’t give him the opportunity.”<br />
<br />
“Fine.” The Drider said. “Show him what you got.”<br />
<br />
“Between us,” the fuckbot said. “I think you can beat him with your skills. Close fast, Mothar.”<br />
<br />
The ogre took a stack of combat chips and slammed them into the back of his head.  Mothar felt power fill him. He growled, shirt breaking as his muscles inflated, snapping the seams of his shirt and jeans. His chest grew and bones cracked and popped as his height increased. His musk filled the room, incredibly potent.<br />
<br />
Mothar charged straight for Dolan, his feet leaving dents in the floor as he sprinted. Dolan raised his hand, pointing at him, and the ogre leaped, stamping his foot into the wall and hurling himself out of the way as the huge human mouthed something. He felt the spell miss him by an inch, the hairs on his arms lifting.<br />
<br />
He hit the ground and rolled, springing up from a crouch beneath Dolan, arm thrusting up through the human’s guard. The impact of his fist into the bottom of Dolan’s chin snapped the humongous human’s head back. He staggered back.<br />
<br />
Mothar followed him forward, jabbing at the human’s face. Dolan dodged and weaved deftly through the barrage of punches. The ogre fired a straight at the human’s nose.<br />
<br />
Dolan’s hand clamped onto the ogre’s fist, bringing his momentum to a halt, and whispered something.<br />
<br />
The ogre shivered, tasting copper.<br />
<br />
“W-what the…!” Mothar wheezed. “That first hit should’ve knocked you out!”<br />
<br />
“Boyo, you are pungent!” MB Dolan waved a hand in front of his nose. “You’ll be a fun bar game!”<br />
<br />
Bar game? The ogre growled. The cocky bastard in front of him, mocking him, reminded him of how small and weak he used to be. He threw away his old human chips the moment he’d earned his Ogre chip.<br />
<br />
“Fuck you, you piece of shit!” Mothar threw another barrage of punches at Dolan<br />
<br />
Dolan ducked and blocked all his punches. Mothar grew angrier and angrier. He’d spent all his personal chip allowances on skill chips, strength chips, agility chips. And yet MB Dolan was treating him like a talent less child!<br />
<br />
Deng-Long and the others stared as the battle progressed. At first it seemed like the ogre had a huge advantage and had managed to push MB Dolan back. But every time Mothar’s fist was caught, Deng-Long sensed a spell being cast by MB and the fists flew slower, the punches impacted with less and less force.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong with him?” The fuckbot droned.<br />
<br />
“The Book is breaking through Mothar’s magic resistance. Not even I can do that.” Deng-Long sighed. “That’s why I can only conjure armor around him and not directly affect him with my spells like I can with Bob.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, so is he…” Bob the stegosaur shouted in horror. “Owen-er, Mothar, stop letting him get a hold of you! He doesn’t need to point to cast the spell!”<br />
<br />
MB Dolan grinned as his secret was revealed.<br />
<br />
Mothar flexed his muscles, feeling oddly stiff. Was this the effect of Dolan’s spells?<br />
<br />
“Feelin’ a bit out o’ sorts, boyo?” MB Dolan laughed. “Yer limbs aren’t meant to bend that way. Yer servos are gonna get all busted up if ya keep fighting me.”<br />
<br />
“Shut the fuck up!” Mothar screamed and kept striking him.<br />
<br />
His arms were slowing down with every punch, growing stiffer every second. Dolan tried to strike Mothar in the sides and the ogre raised his arms behind his head and leapt back, ready to bring them back down on the huge human’s back.<br />
<br />
And he found himself unable to move.<br />
<br />
His limbs wouldn’t respond to his mental commands. He was posing, arms behind his head, showing off his pits. Dolan was grinning at him. The ogre wobbled, trying to will himself forward.<br />
<br />
“Mothar, look at yourself for fuck’s sake!” The Kirin yelled.<br />
<br />
The ogre glanced down at himself. His body looked off. Smaller, more compact, like he’d shrunk down from 7 feet tall, but kept his proportions. Dolan watched his facial expressions as the ogre tried to sort through what was happening to him.<br />
<br />
“You…you!” Owen’s mind hit a blank.<br />
<br />
“Yes, finish the line.” Dolan grinned.<br />
<br />
“Y-you…You think you can withstand my musk?!” Owen blurted out. “Test your strength of will! One Body chip!”<br />
<br />
The sound of wood creaking filled the hallway. He glanced down. His feet had turned into block of wood, and it was spreading up his legs! <br />
<br />
As his legs were consumed up to his mid-thigh by wood that slowly reshaped itself into a box-like shape. It became clear that his lower body was warping into a display stand for his upper body.<br />
<br />
His wooden lower half began to shift, hollowing out, filled with electronics and a Chip holder. A chip slot appeared on the outside, and the name, ‘Owen the Musky Ogre 1 Sniff 1 Chip’ along with a cartoon version of himself showing off his pits was displayed below it.<br />
<br />
The feeling of things moving around, electronics and cords began to rise up from his legs and into his chest. The complete lack of feeling spread. He looked down and noticed his belly was looking odd, shiny…fake<br />
<br />
“What’s happening to me?” Mothar…Owen, stared at Dolan in shock and horror, feeling his legs go numb and cold. <br />
<br />
“I have a soft spot for those old pub games, you know? The Fortune Teller/Test Your Love grip machines.” MB Dolan shrugged. “A scent-based gambling machine has that novelty appeal to it. You’ll be a big hit.”<br />
<br />
“You.. you sick fuck!” Owen&#39;s chest froze mid breath and went numb. Owen didn’t seem to notice and kept speaking, though his voice sounded electronic. “You think you can withstand my musk?”<br />
<br />
Owen shut his mouth as the prerecorded line came out. He could feel the cords reaching up his neck into his head. It itched as they started making connections to his still-organic brain.<br />
<br />
“It was a fun fight. Thanks for that.” Dolan said, watching the ogre’s face stiffen. “Goodbye, Owen.”<br />
<br />
Owen tried to reply, but his mouth unhinged and his brows moved oddly, as though on joints, and he simply spouted his lines again. His torso swiveled, showing the viewers his big, fake rubber ass-cheeks. He could feel none of this, though, body completely numb.<br />
<br />
<i>Give me a sniff</I>, he thought, <I>One body Chip!</I><br />
<br />
That wasn’t what he was thinking! He was thinking about…about rotating himself 90 degrees.<br />
<br />
And he did.<br />
<br />
<i>Get a whiff of this!</I> He thought, and his voice crackled over the speakers<br />
<br />
He tried to think of something else, but there just wasn’t any room for it. The only thing he could say was<br />
<br />
“<I>You think you can withstand my musk?</I>” Owen thought and the animatronic’s mouth wobbled, voice crackling through a hidden speaker. “<I>Test your strength of will! One Body chip!</I>”<br />
<br />
And that was all he could think. His mind finished transforming into a basic motherboard. A sheet of glass rose up from the base of Owen’s wooden lower half, covering the new animatronic. A placard appeared at the top: <b> Musk Machine</b><br />
<br />
“Let’s turn you off for now.” Dolan flicked a switch on the side of the Musk Machine. The ogre abruptly stopped moving and the lights in the display went black.<br />
<br />
“You bastard!” Shouted the Fuckbot.<br />
<br />
Dolan looked up, surveying his next targets.<br />
<br />
The Kirin’s eyes twitched as he trembled in anger. The stegosaur clenched his fist, ready to fight. The Drider backed away from them, leaving Deng-Long leaning against the wall.<br />
<br />
“You’re supposed to be the weakest Book Owner. My intel didn’t lie!” Deng-Long hissed.<br />
<br />
“True!” Dolan laughed heartily. “However, as I told you before, I supplemented the Book with minor copies of the other Books.”<br />
<br />
“Boss, we need to leave!” The Drider said, tugging the limbless Kirin.<br />
<br />
“There is no escape now.” Dolan’s voice went flat. “If they’d listened to you earlier, I may have been much more sympathetic. The time for mercy is over!”<br />
<br />
“Dude, I don’t think we can win.” Bob whispered. “He beat Mothar and he’s completely unphased.”<br />
<br />
“I agree,” The Fuckbot supplied. “If we fight him, we will only get transformed anyways.”<br />
<br />
What the hell are you two worried about!?” Deng-Long shouted. “You’re a fucking dinosaur and you are a godsdamned robot! If we lose we’re fucked, do you get it? No more you anymore!”<br />
<br />
Bob and the Fuckbot backed away from the Kirin as he continued to rant.<br />
<br />
“We need the Book to restore me and Mothar, morons!” Deng-Long raged. “So get your shit together, face him, and GET THAT BOOK!”<br />
<br />
The stegosaurus and the fuckbot glanced at each other, shrugged, and charged. <br />
<br />
Bob swung his spiked tail at Dolan.<br />
<br />
Dolan grinned and caught it in one hand. Bob saw the man wince, though his grip held firm.<br />
<br />
“I see, you’re just a bunch of Blanks under his control.” MB Dolan shook his head. “Easy to fall under his contr-!”<br />
<br />
The Fuckbot blindsided him, placing Dolan in a choke-hold.<br />
<br />
“I do apologize, Mr. Dolan, but I must.” The Fuckbot droned and tightened his grip on Dolan’s throat.<br />
<br />
Dolan clawed at his throat, dropping Bob’s tail.<br />
<br />
“Now kill him, you idiots!” Deng-Long demanded.<br />
<br />
Bob the stegosaurus turned and began smashing his fists into Dolan’s face. Blood splattered with each impact, Bob’s fist cracking bone, smashing teeth. Dolan’s face was turning as red as his beard as he struggled to take even one breath.<br />
<br />
Dolan flailed. He could feel his vision fading. His dick grew erect, tenting his jeans. He was finally experiencing a real threat!<br />
<br />
“Dude, this fucking pervert is enjoying it!” Bob recoiled, staring at Dolan’s bulge and the wet spot forming in the crotch of his jeans.<br />
<br />
Dolan seized the opportunity to grasp the fuckbot’s arm and wrench it, breaking several motors. The fuckbot’s grip on his throat loosened and Dolan pointed at Bob, who was rushing forward.<br />
<br />
“Regression.” Dolan wheezed.<br />
<br />
Bob heard him cast the spell and shivered, tasting copper in his mouth. The world around him grew bigger, his clothes becoming baggier. He attempted to choke Dolan out again but couldn’t get a good grip, his shrinking hands and deflating muscle made overpowering Dolan impossible, now.<br />
<br />
“Shit! Shit! Shit!” Bob screamed, voice cracking as his vast frame shrunk further and further. He glanced over at Liam, the fuckbot. “Liam, help! Break his neck or something!”<br />
<br />
The stegosaur stumbled back, tripping over his pants and landing on his rump. He wanted to cry and…found himself doing so, unable to stop the tears from flowing down his softening cheeks. His spikes shrank down to round little nubs.<br />
<br />
The fuckbot stared in shock, unable to fulfill his friend’s request. His arm was broken. All he could do was stare as Bob’s clothing shifted and changed, becoming more an more childish until his friend was wearing only a onesie.<br />
<br />
Dolan took the opportunity to pry Liam’s arms off his throat, breaking them in the process. He eyed the bot, wondering if he needed to make any adjustments. Aside from the repairs, obviously.<br />
<br />
Bob continued shrinking, now an infant. His thoughts were becoming muddled, the clothes around him disappearing as he felt weaker and weaker. His body began to curl up into a fetal position.<br />
<br />
<i>S-so warm</I>…Bob thought, <I>but I gotta stay awake, I gotta</I>…<br />
<br />
His eyes closed and he felt a nice warm liquid cover him, cradling him. The light began to dim as a shell formed around him. Bob felt himself drifting off to the beating of his tiny heart. As the egg shrank and his body began to slowly reduce itself to nothing more than a yolk, Bob’s thoughts gently drifted away as he was erased from reality.<br />
<br />
“You killed him, you monster!” Liam the fuckbot droned angrily.<br />
<br />
The fuckbot crawled over to the small egg on the floor. He scanned it with his enhanced vision and monitoring sensors but felt no life coming from the egg. His scan informed him that it had only recently been fertilized.<br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t think of it as murder, think of it as me giving the boy a new chance at life!” Dolan guffawed. “If someone doesn’t step on him or eat him for breakfast in the meanwhile.”<br />
<br />
“You fucking moron!” Deng-Long hissed at Liam. “You could have ripped his throat out and saved Bob, now we’re both fucked!”<br />
<br />
“Excuse you?” MB Dolan’s eyes flashed angrily at Deng-Long. “Now, I may take great pleasure in dolling out justice, but even I have to congratulate them at giving it a shot. It was courageous.”<br />
<br />
“Courageous?” Deng-Long spat. “They’re fucking Blanks! Weak willed little bitches that had no choice. Courageous my ass!”<br />
<br />
“I think I’ve had enough of you.” MB Dolan sighed and pointed at the Kirin. “Gender.”<br />
<br />
Deng-Long groaned and shuddered as his balls clenched and shrunk, bringing him to a violent orgasm. He desperately thrust into the air as his  balls pulsed and shrank, squeezing out every last drop of cum before they disappeared into a wet slit. The opening swallowed his rapidly shrinking cock and Deng-Long could only stare helplessly as it hid itself under his new feminine folds. His nipples perked up and swelled, fat and milk filling them.<br />
<br />
“Oh my ~gods~!” Deng-Long moaned, vocal cords changing mid-sentence.<br />
<br />
“Now who’s a bitch?” Dolan smirked.<br />
<br />
“Damn you…!” Deng-Long panted.<br />
<br />
She now had a perfectly feminine body with an hourglass figure. Well, as much of an hourglass figure one could have without any legs. Deng-Long glared up at her attacker angrily.<br />
<br />
“And you.” Dolan pointed at Liam. “Maybe I’ll turn you into a motorcycle. How does that sound?”<br />
<br />
“Hey w-wait! He can still fight!” Deng-Long sputtered.<br />
<br />
“Hmph.” Dolan rolled his eyes at the dragon-horse and faced Liam. “You know what? You’ve been a good sport thus far. One last chance. Take your friends and go.”<br />
<br />
“Liam,” Deng-Long hissed. “Run the scenarios! Think!”<br />
<br />
Liam stared at Deng-Long and nodded, activating a subroutine. <br />
<br />
They seemed to have been beaten and Denny wasn’t looking too hot. Er, technically he was really hot, just not in fighting shape…Liam shook off the random thoughts and focused his highly advanced AI brain on the problem at hand. His mind ran through every scenario, basing Dolan’s responses on everything he’d done so far…And they all ended in defeat. Liam sagged in despair, cradling the little egg in his arms.<br />
<br />
“Yes…we will go.”The Drider suddenly spoke.<br />
<br />
“What?!” Both Deng-Long and Liam shouted at the same time.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry Denny, but I have to take my boyfriend now.” The Drider shrugged, scuttling towards Liam. “You lost.”<br />
<br />
“Are you serious, Maria?” Deng-Long demanded.<br />
<br />
“I can’t risk losing my boyfriend, you blowhard!” Maria replied angrily. “You went after a Book Owner without a fucking plan!”<br />
<br />
“Wait, you aren’t a Blank?” MB Dolan frowned.<br />
<br />
“No.” Maria said flatly. “And I never bet on the magic show. Ergo, you can’t punish me.”<br />
<br />
“Hold on one second.” Dolan held a finger to his earpiece. “Hey Prime? I gotta customer here. Wanna check on her chips and status….Her name’s Maria….uh-huh….really? Okay.” Dolan removed his finger and smiled. “Looks like you’re telling me the truth, Maria. Tell you what, you can buy your boyfriend back from me How’s that sound.”<br />
<br />
Maria’s lips quivered and she nodded.<br />
<br />
“Take them and go.” Dolan waved her away and paused. “The egg stays with me. He’s a gift for a friend.”<br />
<br />
Liam stared down at the egg and, sadly, handed it over to Dolan, who set it carefully next to the Musk Machine. Maria gently took one broken arm and helped him to his feet. <br />
<br />
“Don’t you run, you backstabbing bitch!” Deng-Long screamed as Maria dragged her boyfriend away.<br />
<br />
“Shift.” Dolan pointed at the Kirin.<br />
<br />
The Kirin tasted copper and feared the worst. She glanced down to check what had changed. Only her gently throbbing vagina, which now appeared swollen and irritated, dripping juices on the floor, looked out of place. Why was her vagina so swollen? Chemical in the rug?<br />
<br />
“You missed…oh...” Deng-Long moaned. His body felt so sensitive, vagina drooling now with need. Dolan had sent him into heat! Kirin only went into heat once a century. Deng-Long squirmed, desperately trying to rub her hot vag on the carpet, anything to relieve the growing need in her groin.<br />
<br />
Dolan waited for Maria to haul away her boyfriend and Bob the egg. He picked up the Musk Game and settled it in the corner. He’d have some servants haul it down to the pub later. When he looked up, Maria had disappeared around the corner.<br />
<br />
“Now,” Dolan clapped and picked Deng-Long up. “No more friends here to save you. Now we can finish up your punishment.”<br />
<br />
“Next punishment?” Deng-Long screeched. “You took my masculinity, you took my Blanks, what else could you possibly take you sick fuck?”<br />
<br />
“Fine.” MB Dolan placed her on the floor. “I’ll give you the same choice. Stop fighting me and…well, I’m not going to change you back, but at least you can still earn your way back to limbs with good behaviour.”<br />
<br />
Deng-Long growled.<br />
<br />
“So be it.” MB Dolan sighed, dropped his pants, exposing his massive cock, slapped her across the muzzle with it and pointed at her. “Sense.”<br />
<br />
Deng-Long shut her mouth. She was not going to suck his dick no matter how juicy it was! She heard him cast the spell and gulped, suddenly terrified. What had he changed? She sniffed, smelling Dolan’s musk that wafted from his crotch. Her mouth started to salivate at the intoxicating scent of his cock.<br />
<br />
Oh gods, she realized what he’d done. She tried to concentrate on literally anything else, any other scent. The smell of food, the specialized scent the casino sprayed, the smell of the hall. It became harder and harder to think as the needy leaking dick in front of her kept grabbing her attention.<br />
<br />
Dolan swayed his cock right in front of her nose.<br />
<br />
Den-Long closed her eyes, but despite her resistance, the smell of his musk was like sweet nectar in her head. She fantasized sucking it, sucking any dick, really, just to taste their unique flavors. To enjoy the gush of cum, to savor it, swallow it. Her entire body lit up with pleasure from the tip of her leaky nips all the way down to her needy groin.<br />
<br />
“W-what did you do to me?” Deng-Long moaned.<br />
<br />
“Rearranged your senses so that you only really have them when a cock is nearby.” MB Dolan shrugged. “You are a hyper-focused cum-dump. The more you resist, the more focused that becomes until…”<br />
<br />
Deng-Long whimpered.<br />
<br />
Her body craved the taste of cum like it was ambrosia. She shut her muzzle and turned her head away from the luscious dick in front of her. If she resisted long enough, he’d have no choice but to put that fat, juicy cock away! She could feel her resistance grow weaker with every second that passed.  It was sheer torture. Seconds stretched, felt like hours. Sweat rolled down her brow.<br />
<br />
She needed that dick now!<br />
<br />
Deng-Long tentatively stuck out her tongue and licked the tip of Dolan’s cock. Her eyes widened at the salty flavor, the sweetness of his precum. She licked her lips, the flavors driving away most of what was left of her resistance. She gave the cock a few more licks.<br />
<br />
Dolan watched as Deng-Long went all out, lapping at his uncut cock. He smiled as her laps slowed, tongue delicately exploring his foreskin, truly savoring his flavor She seemed frustrated, trying and failing to even engulf the head of his huge dick in her maw.<br />
<br />
Dolan healed himself and leaned back, spreading his legs so she could access his dick. His injuries disappeared and his body regained his normal vigor.<br />
<br />
“Thatta girl. There you go, just relax.” MB Dolan smiled, reaching down to rub the kirin’s flowing mane as the dragon-horse girl shuddered and nuzzled his cock. “This isn’t so bad, right? If you agree to submit to me, you can suck it.”<br />
<br />
“No!” Deng-Long jerked her head away, but unable to stop herself from licking her lips, savoring the taste of the massive schlong. “I-I will find a way to beat you!”<br />
<br />
“Shame. Guess I’ll have to take the plunge.” <br />
<br />
“What are you-Ngh!” Deng-Long gasped as Dolan plunged two meaty fingers into her vagina. She squirmed in pleasure as they explored her velvety insides, sending electric jolts to her brain. Dolan probed deeper and she bit her lips, moaning, and tried to roll away, to no avail.<br />
<br />
“Come on, be smart. Don’t let your pride get int the way.” Dolan warned.<br />
<br />
“Fuck…you…” Deng-Long gasped, the last remnant of his dominate personality asserting itself.<br />
<br />
“As you wish.” Dolan sighed.<br />
<br />
Dolan picked her up and lowered her onto his erect shaft.<br />
<br />
Deng-Long cried out in pleasure as his massive dick stretched her feminine petals wide open, filling every inch of her. Dolan used her furiously, jack-hammering her like an onahole. Bursts of pain and pleasure filled her mind.<br />
<br />
She felt Dolan grunt and fill her womb with a flood of steaming-hot spooge, then continued fucking her messily. The noises of their lovemaking became lewder, the hall filled with the sound of loud squelches and moans.<br />
<br />
“Alright.” Dolan said.  “I think I’ll break in your mouth now.”<br />
<br />
The Kirin blinked away the stars in her eyes and glared daggers at Dolan.<br />
<br />
Dolan immediately stopped thrusting and pulled wetly out of her.<br />
<br />
Deng-Long gasped, feeling the sudden cold emptiness. She tried to milk him, bucking her hips fruitlessly. She realized she needed to cum, even if it meant giving in to this asshole.<br />
<br />
“No, please, I didn’t mean to glare at you! I need your cum inside me. I give up.” She whimpered.<br />
<br />
“No. Enough chances.” Dolan picked her up and carried her out into the casino proper.<br />
<br />
Deng-Long whined, unsure of what he was going to do with her.<br />
<br />
He paraded her used body through the crowd, cum dripping form her vagina. People would stop and point at her. Whispers started, filling Deng-Long with embarrassment. She heard a few compliments and blushed.<br />
<br />
They came to a stop in front of a glass display case containing only a Golden Dildo and a button next to it. A blank brass plaque was just below it.<br />
<br />
“You’re going to be made an example of what we do to cheaters.” Dolan hefted her up, positioning her vagina over the golden dildo, and lowered her onto it.<br />
<br />
Deng-Long hissed in pleasure as the dildo filled her.<br />
<br />
Dolan pressed the button.<br />
<br />
The dildo began to vibrate, and Deng-Long felt an orgasm build. Her head tilted back and her tongue lolled as she felt herself leak juices all over the case. Her orgasm hit like a rocket, mind blanking in pure pleasure, her body jerking.<br />
<br />
Dolan pointed. “Inanimate.”<br />
<br />
He closed the door of the case as the Dragon-horse’s features froze mid-orgasm, face caught in an expression of agonizing bliss.<br />
<br />
The last thing Deng-Long saw before her mind was lost in an endless sea of never-ending orgasmic pleasure were the words etched into the plaque below, reflected in the glass.<br />
<br />
<b>Deng-Long, The Needy Cheating Bitch</b><br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Prime Dolan watched MB Dolan as he paraded Deng-Long around the casino like some kind of sick trophy and shuddered. In many other timelines, the owner of the Book of Body was sadistic and dangerous. Old Man Dolan had informed him of that, anyways. He wasn’t sure if that were completely true. However, more than one story had made him want to vomit. <br />
<br />
From crushing someone to death under the weight of their own lethally obese weight to giving someone assholes for eyes. Transforming them into pregnant women…hell, even if they ended up with a better Book, like the Book of Beast, their enemies could expect to be transformed into a pregnant bitch or cow.<br />
<br />
Now there were three Book of Body owners in the casino-MB, Xarxos (probably), and Todd. Possibly not the original Owners, but still. Books made people sadistic. It was the allure of the reality bending magic.<br />
<br />
In short, Dolan trusted no one, especially not himselves.<br />
<br />
Dolan’s eyes focused. The groups of Book owners were splitting up, scouting the casino. They’d be vulnerable, but unlike Deng-Long and his group, they’d be prepared and capable of resisting the spells</p>
