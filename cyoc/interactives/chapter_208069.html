<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Things calmed down for Colin after that. Him and the girls worked together to get rid of the packages, and life went on. His days were filled with work, dates, and lots and lots of sex. Sam was slowly getting used to Snow&#39;s presence, though she still always managed a scowl whenever her rival amazon managed to snatch Colin for a quick fuck.<br />
<br />
The weirdness didn&#39;t abate, but it did slow down. Whenever he was driving, Colin found himself cruising through traffic as every traffic light he approached turned green, causing confusion and chaos as cars suddenly decelerated to not crash into each other and people jumped out of the way as car lanes suddenly began to move again. One day when bills arrived Colin was incredibly dumbfounded to find them prepaid. Even his taxes had mysteriously been done before he could even begin working on them. Enjoying a high-class meal in a restaurant with Marinette was disturbed by the dozens of displeased customers that were downright abusing the reception, complaining that all their reservations had been canceled with no warning whatsoever. Colin thought it to be weird since when he was making the reservation, all the spots had been free...<br />
<br />
But all of it was nothing compared to the morning when he awoke in his bed, reaching for that night&#39;s companion who happened to be Zoya, and found her spot to be empty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zoya?&quot; Colin shouted and immediately launched awake. It&#39;d been a long time since he&#39;d slept alone, and the lack of a girlfriend was immediately worrying. He rushed out of his room without even dressing up, only to slam straight into Alya.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning! Sorry, no time!&quot; she said, before dashing towards the kitchen. <br />
<br />
More confused than ever, Colin made his way into the kitchen, where all of his present girlfriends had gathered, frantically preparing themselves for the day, putting on bras, munching on hastily prepared sandwiches and brushing their hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is going on?&quot; Colin managed to ask after taking in the sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Colin!&quot; Sam emerged from the mass of girls, already in uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I can&#39;t stay, I have to go. My partner has been shot!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Colin shouted.<br />
<br />
Sam nodded, and he noticed tears beginning to swell in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just got the word. It&#39;s bad. She&#39;s been moved into the regional hospital. I have to go see her. See you later!&quot; Sam rushed out the door, closely followed by Lucy.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t hard to find out why everyone was in such a hurry. Each and every one of them had gotten a sudden emergency. Snow&#39;s sister had been in a traffic accident, and she had to go take care of Eve. Angela had been accused of evading taxes, and she had to go to give a statement immediately. Jamie&#39;s friend needed her for something, Jessie had a work emergency, Zoya and Lori as well as they were frantically shouting into their phones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, there&#39;s no time for caution. They&#39;re definitely bleeding out. Start the transfusion, we&#39;re on our way!&quot; he managed to hear before they too disappeared out the door.<br />
<br />
For the first time in recent memory, Colin not only woke up without a partner but found himself in an empty house as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess I&#39;ll... play some games?&quot; he shrugged, before starting to clean up after the girls and make his own preparations for the day.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Behind a tree overlooking Colin&#39;s house, Nicole&#39;s fingers danced on the keys of her laptop as she sent out the last details for the demolition of Melanie&#39;s family home. She pressed enter and allowed herself a small smile. She wasn&#39;t proud of what she&#39;d done, but atleast none of the emergencies were real. It&#39;d required just a bit of digging and social engineering to worm her way into the girl&#39;s lives and find out a weak point to exploit. All of it culminated today in a grand move with one clear purpose: Getting her some alone time to introduce herself to Colin.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right, Nicole. This is it. Just remember what C.O.L.I.N said. Walk up to him, be cool, be yourself. You can&#39;t fail. You&#39;re one bad bitch who broke into the CIA when she was twelve. You can do this.&quot; She psyched herself up, tapping her cheeks and stepped out from behind the tree. She stashed her laptop into her backpack, adjusted her hoodie. And took her first steps towards Colin.<br />
<br />
It took about five seconds for doubt to begin to creep in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, what if he thinks I&#39;m a weird stalker? Do normal girls look at the birth records of their lovers?&quot; she pondered as she was crossing the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean I didn&#39;t MEAN to crack open his socials but come on, who uses an 8-character password in this day and age?&quot;<br />
<br />
She reached the edge of the sidewalk.<br />
<br />
&quot;And isn&#39;t making a customized AI companion based on his behavioral patterns just a good thing? Imitation is the highest form of flattery!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sweat began running down her neck as she took her first steps on the path leading up to his house. It made her acutely aware of her current state of dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I seriously wear a hoodie for my first meeting? I didn&#39;t even put on a bra! But bras are such a drag...&quot;<br />
<br />
She was getting closer. His door loomed in front of her larger and larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does... does he like skirts? Did the data have anything on his clothing preferences? Geez, were these sweats a mistake?&quot;<br />
<br />
She was close now. Only a few steps and she&#39;d be within knocking distance of his door.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all going wrong! Abort, abort! Operation failure!&quot;<br />
<br />
But she couldn&#39;t stop, her body wasn&#39;t listening anymore. She got in front of his door and stopped there. She tried to run but she was wound up too tight, like a spring. Nicole tried to calm down her breathing.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, you got this, just turn around and try again another day. It&#39;s no loss, really...&quot; she slowly began to convince herself, working her leg muscles to turn away before someone saw her standing in front of the door like an idiot.<br />
<br />
DING DONG<br />
<br />
Internal screaming erupted in Nicole&#39;s head. &quot;I forgot my automated greeting algorithm!&quot; she panicked in her mind, a small whine getting out as she heard sounds from the inside, someone approaching the door. It was too late now. He&#39;d see her running away. Think, think, thinkthinkthinkthinkthink-<br />
<br />
Colin pulled open the door to find a busty woman standing there, sweating hard and clad in all-black hoodie and sweats on a warm summer morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I... help you?&quot; he asked warily.<br />
<br />
Nicole looked up to see Colin standing there, her eyes peeking at his majesty from underneath her hood.<br />
<br />
His unclothed majesty, as Colin had only bothered to put on boxers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-&quot; she began, before stress and arousal got over her and she promptly fainted on the spot.<br />
<br />
***<br />
Colin was more confused than ever as he dragged the unconscious girl into his house. He&#39;d just opened the door and hardly got a word out as she collapsed. He barely managed to leap forward to grab her before she hit the ground.<br />
<br />
He brought her to his bedroom just as the house went crazy. The lights turned gentle pink, his blinds shut themselves to coat the room in darkness, and in the living room he heard the stereos begin to play romantic music as well as speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Colin. You don&#39;t know me, but I know everything about you. I&#39;ve been watching you for a while now. I guess you could consider me... a guardian angel of sorts. And I&#39;m here today to tell you that I can make your every dream... a reality...&quot; the voice went on, talking in a breathy voice oddly reminiscent of porn. His attention was turned back to the girl laying mouth open on his bed, saliva dripping over her cheek as her hoods was pulled back to reveal messy green hair and deathly pale skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guardian angel, huh...&quot; Colin thought to himself. The last few days were starting to make a lot more sense, especially as he pulled out the heavy-duty laptop from her backpack.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Nicole&#39;s eyes stirred as she felt a cool breeze. Her mouth tasted... fresh. As if the overly sweet taste of energy drinks had been washed away. She was somewhere soft. She was laying on her side. The first thing she saw was the glass of a water on the nightstand right next to her. She also saw that the breeze came from a fan held by someone.<br />
<br />
Someone who was in the bed next to her.<br />
<br />
Nicole pulled up and almost hit heads with Colin, turning to look at her &quot;savior&quot; with panicked eyes. Colin stopped fanning her and sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello. I take it you&#39;re the one responsible for the last few days?&quot; He asked very bluntly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I-I... I am...&quot; Nicole stuttered. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all falling apart!&quot; Her mind screamed to her. &quot;He&#39;s onto us! Eject!&quot; &quot;There&#39;s nowhere to run! We need backup! Call the Space Marines!&quot; &quot;Oh god, please don&#39;t let me die!&quot; &quot;I&#39;m sorry I never went out and got a real job mom, but crypto is the future, I promise you!&quot;<br />
<br />
All of these thoughts and more ran through her mind as she struggled to come up with a plan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, he asked us a question, so we have to do something!&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, just... do... anything.&quot;<br />
&quot;Anything?&quot;<br />
&quot;ANYTHING! Just... do it with confidence.&quot;<br />
&quot;A-alright, here goes nothing...&quot;<br />
<br />
With newfound shaky determination, Nicole leaned forward, grabbed Colin&#39;s head and kissed him.<br />
<br />
&quot;NNNOOOOOO!!!&quot;<br />
&quot;WHAT? You said do anything!&quot;<br />
&quot;Anything except THAT, obviously!&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite Nicole&#39;s inner voices screaming at her, she was pleasantly surprised to find Colin leaning into the kiss, his hands wrapping around her as he took the lead, their tongues dancing around each other as he began to supplement her amateurish technique. Nicole found all her tech knowledge, all her doubts melting away as she gave herself into the moment, letting her long-buried instincts lead.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Colin took off her hoodie and sweats as Nicole wormed out of her panties and t-shirt, revealing her sizable curves. He knew it was weird to immediately go for the girl who&#39;d invaded his life like that, but instinct was telling him to put his already throbbing dick into her, which he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;AHHH!&quot; Nicole screamed as Colin took her virginity, beginning to slowly pump into her as she adapted to his length. Slowly their pace increased as Nicole began easing into the act, embracing Colin as he made her a woman. Her body followed as amidst their lovemaking her already large assets began to inflate, her breasts breaking into an F-cup as they perked up, along with her ass ballooning and hips cracking wider as Nicole leveled up. Some of her flab melted away as her deathly pale skin darkened, getting some much-needed healthy tan as her teeth whitened and her hair grew as Colin was combing his hands through it, the colored portions extending outwards to reveal natural brown hair peeking out from her pores.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... it&#39;d be so cool if that was her natural hair...&quot; Colin thought amidst his pumping.<br />
<br />
To his astonishment, the bright green coloring began to race down her roots digging into her scalp as it became even more vibrant, the color melting off to reveal Nicole&#39;s hair now sporting her signature green color since birth.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t have time to ponder that as the combination of their furious pumping, Nicole&#39;s enthusiasm and growing curves sent them over the edge, both orgasming at the same time as they pulled away, exhausted.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn pranks... messing with people&#39;s lives crosses the line!&quot; Zoya muttered to herself as she arrived back home with Lori.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did they even manage to orchestrate that? Unbelievable.&quot; Lori scuffed, throwing off her jacket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Colin! We&#39;re back!&quot; both called out.<br />
<br />
They heard the familiar sound of lovemaking from Colin&#39;s room, along with a new voice. They looked at each other. They&#39;d only been gone for 30 minutes. Had he already managed to get a new girl?<br />
<br />
The mystery was solved as they arrived at his room to find Colin banging an extremely well endowed girl with neon green hair who was screaming her lungs out, completely out of it as her tongue lolled around, Colin pumping into her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good grief...&quot; Lori muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem!&quot; Zoya coughed to get their attention.<br />
<br />
Colin turned his attention to the, grunting just as he came, the girl screaming as cum flooded out of her. She was sweaty and stuttery, laying on the bed with her ass up, completely exhausted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back. I managed to locate our &quot;Ghost.&quot;&quot; Colin said, slapping Nicole&#39;s ass while he did and earning a cry from her. &quot;And I&#39;ve already punished her for disorderly conduct.&quot;</p>
