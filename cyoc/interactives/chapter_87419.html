<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Many hours later, Todd lazily opened his eyes. The first thing he noticed was that he was laying in a big bed, instead of the patio where he remembered passing out. At the memory of why he passed out, Todd&#39;s face broke into a smile. He wasn&#39;t sure what had happened to the three of them but he wasn&#39;t complaining. Especially about what the changes had done to Blake. At the thought of Blake, Todd realized he wasn&#39;t alone in the bed. Rather, he was snugly pressed up against something. Something big.<br />
<br />
Todd rolled over to see Blake, naked in all his muscled glory, laying on his side looking at him dreamily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning.&quot; Todd groaned and stretched. &quot;How long have I been out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We went swimming around 10 and it&#39;s now almost 7 in the afternoon, you were worn out.&quot; Blake told him as he planted a kiss on Todd&#39;s soft, supple lips and gently rubbed his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop that.&quot; Todd smiled and playfully pushed his hand away. &quot;Did you stay with me the entire time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the time.&quot; Blake nodded. Todd felt a warm feeling run through his chest. &quot;Jay&#39;s downstairs fixing us some dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd reached up caressed Blake&#39;s face before he began to run his hands down Blake&#39;s massive muscles. He ran over the enormous biceps that Blake happily flexed for him, traced his huge pecs, toying with the nipples, and slipped his fingers in between the crevasses his abs made in his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;God you&#39;re sexy.&quot; He whispered as his hands slipped down below the sheets. Blake&#39;s breathing became low and husky as he felt Todd&#39;s hand ghost over his now huge balls.<br />
<br />
Todd&#39;s eyebrows shot up as he felt just how large Blake&#39;s balls had grown from that morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my!&quot; Todd bit his lip and smiled as his hand began to trace the veins on Blake&#39;s hardening cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone ever tell you you look fucking hot when you make that face?&quot; Blake growled and rolled over, pulling Todd on top of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Because I like yours better.&quot;  Todd grinned as he hungrily devoured Blake&#39;s egger mouth.<br />
<br />
As the two of them rolled around in the sheets, mouths firmly attached in a state of bliss, Todd gave a little sigh. He loved his best friends muscles, he loved his best friends ass, he loved his best friends cock, he loved his best friends mouth, he loved his best friend!<br />
<br />
Todd pulled back with a start. Blake looked at his smaller friend with a worried look on his face. &quot;You ok Todd?&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd studied Blake&#39;s face. He&#39;d lost some of the boyish charm he&#39;d had when they arrived, his chin was more pronounced, his jaw line was stronger, and his eyes, formerly a soft blue, were now a steely gray that Todd felt looked right through to his soul. Did he love him?<br />
<br />
Todd smiled softly. &quot;Yeah, everything&#39;s just perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Knock knock.&quot; A more feminine voice called out as Jay entered the room, his twink body now showcased in a pair of tight leather pants and a tight, colorful tank top. &quot;Just came to tell you two lovebirds that dinner is about ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Jay.&quot; Blake winked at him, producing a frown from Todd. Jay flashed them a winning smile before closing the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I&#39;m not really that hungry.&quot; Todd told Blake, massaging his massive cock.<br />
<br />
Blake smiled and kissed him. &quot;I know, but you&#39;ve been in bed all day and Jay worked really hard so at least come down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd nodded and slipped off his big muscle man to pull on a pair of jeans that had been flung over the back of a nearby chair. &quot;You gonna get dressed?&quot; He asked Blake, who was still sitting in bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why bother?&quot; He smirked and flexed the cannons he called arms. Todd felt himself go weak in the knees, this new burst of confidence was such a huge turn on. &quot;It&#39;s not like I wouldn&#39;t just rip through whatever I put on, not to mention that covering up this body would be a crime.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No argument here.&quot; Todd smiled. Blake got up from the bed, his hard cock nestled in the cleavage his pecs produced. With a squeal of delight Todd found3 himself being lifted into the air, bridal style, and carried down the hall.33<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you 4Todd.&quot; Blake said as he looked into Todd&#39;s eyes. Todd felt his mouth go dry and his heart speed up to near supersonic speeds. &quot;I love you too.&quot; He managed to sputter as his lover pulled him close.<br />
<br />
*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*_*<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn man, who knew you could cook like that?&quot; Blake said as he pushed back his 7th empty plate, the others stacked haphazardly on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that was good.&quot; Todd nodded. Jay beamed with pride. He couldn&#39;t remember ever being able to cook but he&#39;d found some ingredients in the fridge with a note from his Marc, suggesting he cook these for his friends. Something about the food being &quot;untreated&quot;, whatever that meant.<br />
<br />
With a grunt, Blake scooted back from the table and began stroking his semi hard shaft. &quot;I&#39;ve got dessert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ever soft?&quot; Jay asked with wonder. Unlike Todd, he&#39;d not seen his studly buddy&#39;s new equipment up close, save for the incident this morning but he&#39;d not really been paying close attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet.&quot; Blake shook his head. &quot;While I&#39;m getting dessert ready, why don&#39;t you find a tape measure so we can see just how big this bad boy is?&quot;<br />
<br />
As Jay scurried off, Todd slid close to his boyfriend. &quot;Need some help with that?&quot; He pointed to Blake&#39;s hard rod.<br />
<br />
Blake smiled and Todd took that as his cue. Climbing into Blake&#39;s lap, he began to run his tongue all over his boyfriends organ before managing to take the head in his mouth. Blake moaned as Todd&#39;s head bobbed up and down and began to fondle his oversized balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jay hurry up! Dessert&#39;s ready!&quot; Blake called as he felt his orgasm building. Jay hurriedly pranced back into the room, tape measure in hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t do it yet, I wanna measure you first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd reluctantly removed Blake&#39;s cock from his mouth as Jay measured, first length wise, then circumference.<br />
<br />
&quot;34 inches long, 13 inches around.&quot; Jay gasped in awe. At the beginning of the journey, Blake had been a tall, lanky, quiet, slightly geeky kid. Now he was a beast, over 7 feet tall with muscles that would make Hercules weep with envy and easily the largest cock in the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck yeah, now measure this!&quot; Blake ordered as he flexed one of his arms, making veins pop out like a road map.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allow me.&quot; Todd said as he snatched the tape from Jay. &quot;30 inch biceps big boy.&quot; Todd grinned.<br />
<br />
Blake nodded and moaned as a fountain of pre begin gushing from his cock. Jay moved to greedily lap up the juice but Blake pushed him away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wait.&quot; He panted. A few more hard strokes and Blake gave a loud cry and his cock exploded with hot seed, all over Todd and Jay. Todd swallowed as much as he could, there was nothing he loved as much as the taste of his boyfriend. Meanwhile Jay was in heaven, licking the cum off himself and Todd, savoring the sweet and salty taste.<br />
<br />
Blake just chuckled at the faces of the two before sucking on his own cum soaked fingers. He could get used to this.</p>
