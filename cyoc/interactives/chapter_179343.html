<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty was stricken by panic for a moment and backed away before Eileen&#39;s gentle smile and excited eyes lured him back in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be shy, darling.&quot; Eileen whispered, nodding with encouragement. &quot;I think I might learn to like this. It feels better every time you further the changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-Really?&quot; Ty gasped. &quot;Does it really?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Truly.&quot; Eileen smiled, closing her eyes and savoring the strange sensations of an alien form. She knew she was sprouting feathers, she knew her limbs and especially her toes were deforming. She knew her mouth was starting to pull out and harden into a massive toucan beak. It was the insides, though. The tickle of her intestines rearranging. The subtle tug on her vagina. New organs appearing where they hadn&#39;t been before. The intense feeling of her bones stretching and squashing. She felt her hair loosening on top of her head. It might start to fall away soon! It was a thrill! She was changing from the inside out. Completely at the whim of her young and scandalous admirer.<br />
<br />
Ty took a deep breath and stepped forward with shaking hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it, my darling. I&#39;m so very uncomfortable in this poor ruined dress. Let&#39;s free my body and keep going.&quot; She saw her hands and grinned, raising them and shaking the strangely elongated pinkies again. &quot;I&#39;d do it myself, you know, but it seems I&#39;m growing wings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty shivered in delight as he circled Eileen. She was almost entirely coated in small wispy feathers. The protrusions were still sharp and spiky and had a long way to grow, but it was obvious what they were. Yet they hadn&#39;t thickened to cover her bare skin. The cream of her flesh was still visible underneath. Ty gulped as Eileen caught his gaze, her mouth protruding forward, her lips starting to harden into the tip of a beak. He reached up and touched her face and they both shuddered.<br />
<br />
Ty reached Eileen&#39;s back and decided it was time to keep going. He approached her snug rear bra strap and saw the tiny feathers had torn the silky elastic fabric apart. It was frayed and bare in places. He reached up, fingers trembling nervously, and carefully undid the clasps of the grown woman&#39;s bra. It fell loose and Eileen gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my...&quot; She commented. &quot;I&#39;m... quite a bit firmer.&quot; She tugged the bra off her prickly front and tossed it to the floor.<br />
<br />
Ty so badly wanted to fly to the front and oogle her, but instead he took the lowered top of her dress and began to peel it down. The tiny needles of her feathers had stuck it to her body in places. He carefully pulled each inch of fabric off and was startled to find Eileen wasn&#39;t wearing panties. The curvature and semi-concealed flesh of her naked ass was under his palm as he pulled the dress down.<br />
<br />
The pseudo-bird woman laughed and helped him pull it away completely. Like the bra, the dress was covered in holes and tears. It was utterly destroyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodbye favorite dress.&quot; Ty quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;May it rest in pieces.&quot; Eileen giggled.<br />
<br />
Ty finally came around to her front and his eyes went wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take a good look, darling.&quot; Eileen grinned playfully. &quot;I suppose we&#39;d better get used to my nudity if I&#39;m going to be turning into animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty stared at the avian/alien woman and together they examined her form. Ty focused in on two huge and lifted breasts, two pink nipples still poking out from behind her meager feathers. She was incredibly turned on, and her nipples were huge on her huge tits. Although the effect was somewhat diminished due to her strange body and changes, Ty couldn&#39;t help but imagine what she must look like fully human.<br />
<br />
&quot;As big as you expected?&quot; Eileen smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bigger.&quot; Ty blinked several times. &quot;Your nipples, too. So large.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, they&#39;re quite big. Last time I had to be fitted, I was about an H cup.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;God!&quot; Ty gasped. &quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eileen nodded enthusiastically and laughed. &quot;I&#39;ve always said they never stopped growing. The older I get, the more they seem to fill out. By the time I&#39;m 80, they&#39;ll be touching my knees.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty snorted and shook his head. &quot;No, they&#39;re just beautiful!&quot; He realized and blushed red. &quot;Besides, I can always perk them up for you whenever you like. Maybe... make them even bigger?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Eileen gulped nervously, &quot;How much bigger can they be? They&#39;re already so huge!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Either way...&quot; Ty shook his head, trying not to stare at the nice feminine slit between her legs. &quot;Let&#39;s keep going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes, please!&quot; Eileen hugged herself. &quot;I can&#39;t wait!&quot;<br />
<br />
The teen focused again and took a deep breath. So, 15%. He was startled as Eileen let out a sharp cry and opened his eyes in alarm to see it was not discomfort. Her head was up towards the roof again, jaw open, eyes clenched shut, her knees were weak and struggling to hold up her body, and the now bare slit between her legs was oozing erotic juices.<br />
<br />
&quot;UNNNNN!&quot; Eileen gritted her teeth, her pinky fingers extending dramatically and thickening from the base of her hand to their new three foot tip. Her feathers began to grow in earnest, soft down extending from the cores. Over her chest and front, those rapidly growing feathers turned an almost lime yellow, while a fan began to emerge behind her. Her toes now almost completely numbered three, the vestigial human digits reduced to near nothingness, while hard black claws now capped her hands. It was her physique though. The leaness of her body, the tightening slope of her feminine form. She was growing lighter and fitter! Ty looked up in shock and saw her ears shrinking now, her face starting to push forward into the hook of a sharp beak. As it relented, Eileen fell to her knees and whimpered, trembling in lustful shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-More!&quot; She cried. &quot;Give me more!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty blinked several times and looked over his work. The human woman was fading and the bird woman was emerging. Her tail feathers had begun to grow in. Her super extended pinky fingers were sprouting wing feathers now. She was completely inhuman looking!<br />
<br />
&quot;MORE!&quot; Eileen squawked, startled at the sudden trill of her voice.<br />
<br />
Ty gasped and urged her on. 20%. The woman on all fours cried out and humped dry air, ass swaying up and down as her tail feathers grew longer and thicker behind her. Ty gasped harder and held his hands over his mouth as his next door fantasy lost control of herself. Tears welled up in her tightly clenched eyes and her teeth began to shrink back into her jaws as her beak overtook her face, with audible hardening and growth as it swelled forward from her skull. Her legs were now featherless from the knee down and turning to leathery birch colored scales. With a sudden pop, she writhed and moaned, back arching, as her body seemed to slim tremendously, bones lightening and hollowing with air sacs, overall shape reducing even as her height began to increase. Her flight feathers were growing in to her continually lengthening new wings! Even her once huge breasts had lightened, firmed, and shrunk significantly to firm D cups.<br />
<br />
As it subsided, Eileen was well over a quarter way into becoming a bird woman. She looked at Ty pitifully, opening striking blue eyes, and whimpered.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;T-Ty...&quot; She trilled, her voice so pitiful, so needy. &quot;Please, darling... I... I... need you to keep it going.&quot; Even under the feathers that had nearly consumed her face, she blushed.</p>
