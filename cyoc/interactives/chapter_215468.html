<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Look at this, my big brother is now reduces to a simple life of being a rubberized foxy pet. You wanted to spy On me by hiding among my dolls, did you? Well, no more bad jokes to plan at this point! Don’t worry, you’ll make a good pet while living this new life from now on.” She grinned as Suzy checked over the screen again, looking at the setting who had turned Jeff into her toy as she then made him into a human rubber pet fox.<br />
<br />
“Suzy! Wait,What are you...” Jeff began to say, but his sister just told him off by what came next. “Silence, you are not to talk right now. Also your new name&#39;s vixey from now. You know, this is just to easy for you. Stay there, and let me see on what we got on the screen here.” Jeff, now being called Vixey by his own sister just told him to shut up and hold still to where he was at.<br />
<br />
“hmm, It appears you had set this at for a 2 days transformation… you wanted to spend out the week-end like this? Well now, Let’s make it three months! Shall we?” she said as she changed the settings and saved it that Jeff wanted to stop her, but she was quick about it. she even hugged on the idea of having him mentally obedient to orders, which she did for Suzy also saved this on to the settings to the program of Jeff&#39;s file. “This way, you’ll be able to live like the pet I&#39;ve always wanted to have! Well, at least until the end of the summer!” She grinned “If you are a good enough, then perhaps I’ll even keep you like this after words.”<br />
<br />
Jeff tried to speak to deny it, his boy-part mind was scared to hell of not to be able to go back to normal while being stuck as her pet. However, thanks to her order of no talking that no word came out from his mouth. Suzy was placing a dog like collar around her new pet as it showed a heart shape tag by the name &#39;Vixey&#39;, still holding on to him tightly by a leach though while slowly tugging him out of the room.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to go anywere as he was struggling to be let go, with wanting to take the collar off of him that she noticed this and told him off on what to do with himself. “stop fidgeting with that collar you got there. It&#39;s not like you wore a collor before this. In fact, you are to never take it off. You are my pet now as good pets have tags that shows them who&#39;s their master is, where they live, who the pet is called, what&#39;s the house phone number is for if someone finds a lost pet, etc. now then, come along. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll like to wear something nice than being a cute maid that works to clean. Let&#39;s go.” suzy said tugging him out of the room as he was now unable to move by himself to this order.<br />
<br />
“I was like, so not trying to spy on you Sis! Please, let me go! I‘ll be like the best bro you could ever dream of! I promise, jut let change myself back! Just let me go!” was he thinking as loud as possible for this to work in perhaps of hoping, she&#39;ll be able to read his mind. in a way that it did reach her mind as she pretended to not read it.<br />
<br />
Suzy shortly brought him back into her room as she sat jeff on her bed while she sat in her desk, sitting in front of her new pet while in her desk chair. As she let him go, he tried to walk away, but couldn’t run fast with his collar still attached to her leach that she till holds on to. She tugs her brother back to the bed to look at him right infrom of her eyes, staring straight back at him. “You should know better by now. behave yourself as a proper pet, or you’ll be punished. I do not intend to keep you like this, forever. since I might miss my brother at some point. However, if you aren’t good in the meantime that you’ll might just regret it. Is that understood, VIXEY?”<br />
<br />
Jeff blushed as he felt a mix emotion of fear and somewhat, embarrassment of pleasure building up inside that he quickly submitted to a nod. “what can this cute pet of a vixen do for you today... Mistress?” said Jeff as a new mix feeling of joy and love were now overwhelming his fears, knowing that he was somehow safe in his sister&#39;s care forthe summer.<br />
<br />
“oh! I like your new attitude of yours, but Not so fast with yah!” said Suzy, smirking on Jeff’s newly behavior towards her.<br />
<br />
“before we plan this big day out, you need to get you into some clothes!” She said as Suzy checked out Jeff wasn&#39;t wearing anything, but his rubber fox skintight outfit with nothing else then just a collar on to a leash. “I&#39;m not sure if you would like to meet a good man, with such clothes… Is that why you were checking out the princess dress? If so, then Let me handle that for you.”<br />
<br />
She left him still sitting on her bed as she left her video phone on her desk top and went to the other corner of her room, bringing back few boxes. “I like my cute pet of mine to be on their top of fashion, then most pets out there.” she said, bringing out a few outfit for Jeff to try on that the first thing she pulled out were black silked bras and panties, yet leaving his plastic body exposed for right now.<br />
<br />
“you should thank my big sis for leaving this stuff behind as she doesn&#39;t want them anymore. beside, you must be the prettiest for when your first meet a guy that you like.” For a certain time as she still searched through the boxes, she stopped for even Jeff then notice on what she just said.<br />
<br />
“wait! When do we have a big sister all of the sudden?” Suzy asked that even Jeff started to wonder about this himself. Thinking of it more that soon they thought of a crazy, yet strange idea on how it was possible as they looked eye to eye on this while speaking to this together. “THE CHRONIVAC!”<br />
<br />
“well, I&#39;ve always wanted a sister. Still, how come we don&#39;t know her that well? We haven&#39;t seen her, like forever.” Suzy began to ask questions about her as she was asking Jeff this, since he was older than her. However, not even he knew of her as it must of been the program of the Chronivac, to have them think they actually have a bigger sister.<br />
<br />
Shrugging this off, she went back to picking up the phone to video add it on Jeff slipping on ladies underwear. While doing this, Jeff felt humiliated by this as he didn&#39;t want to be a naked rubber pet fox to his little sister. Yet still, he didn&#39;t want anyone to have the guts out there seeing him dressed up in ladies garments outfits. He felt red with embarrassment of her video adding him like this that he shortly after was signaled of putting on some nilong socks on, pausing the add to help make a slit opening for his tail.<br />
<br />
looking at Jeff, and putting a new outfit out for him as he struggledto strip on a Black sleeveless Mock neck tank top while placing on skinny tight blue jeans that like before, there was a fashion statement of adding a small slit of a tail hole. The girl-part of Jeff’s mind, reactivated by looking at herself in a full length body mirror that he was full of happiness when he was looking at the outfit Suzy had picked out for him. If he was looking at his reflection, to see her in real life that he would be turned on and date her right there on the spot. And yet, this was her now as there were no strange connection of dating this hot chick of a vixen that this was somewhat turning him on.<br />
<br />
“dang girl! Check me out in this outfit, this is like heaven for me! I’m going to be so pretty! I can’t wait to be out and go on my first date!” Jeff said as he was so pleased by his looks that even Suzy seemed pleased and turn back to Jeff, to place on matching black heels for him. <br />
<br />
Finally, From top to toe that he was now the perfect fashion rubber pet fox girl for Suzy. Not realizing what Jeff was doing that he shocked his head out of these women thoughts, and back think straight of his old self. What happens next?</p>
