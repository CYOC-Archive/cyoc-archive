<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Some how, Terra found a way up on her knees, but it was too late. A major pain forced the girl to grip her stomach, followed by a serious of loud wet farts rippling out of her. The farts increased in strength, and decreased in length until finally a load started to make its way out. Tears formed in Terra&#39;s eyes, as the uselessness of the situation terrified her, changing her body and forcing it to do things against her will. She tried desperately to hold the load back, but with little success as it still made its way into her panties. Finally deciding that the pain was too unbearable, she conceded and began pushing the load out. The massive bowl movement finally shot out with a massive fart following. Terra sighed in relief, the immense pain finally subsiding.  However, she heard a clanking noise behind her. Turning to see the source of the noise, she found the white pebble lying on the ground. Was that what it was all about? The pebble was trying to exit her butt by fattening her and forcing her to have a bowl movement? Before she could react further, the emptiness in her stomach was suddenly filled with an intense bloating sensation, a massive fart exiting her behind. The flatulence surprised Terra: wasn&#39;t she done? Why did she still have gas? Another loud, rippling fart made her realize that they were no longer short and wet, but now long and loud. It felt permanent. So the pebble made her, what, 300 pounds and forever gassy? Just cause she shoved it up her ass? On hind sight, it wasn&#39;t the smartest move. But now, she was faced with the reality of not only being obese, but also being gassy. What would she tell her parents? How will she go back to school? She couldn&#39;t go back like this! Her entire life was now suddenly, drastically changed forever all because of a stupid pebble! She stared down at the tiny stone in question, anger filling her. Before she knew it, she was standing over it and smashing it with her foot. Lifting it, she found the pebble was completely unharmed. Terra sighs in frustration. Figures. It was at that moment that she realized where she was, or more specifically, what she was doing: standing. She looked down in shock at her suddenly upright position. Wasn&#39;t she just having trouble just sitting up? How did she just stand up? With a quick lift of her massive, rather jiggly leg (ewww), she found she could life it no problem as if there wasn&#39;t an extra fifty something pounds on it. She continued with walking down the hallway, and although it was uncomfortable given the large mound of poop in her panties slapping against her butt, she found walking just as easily before the gain. With one finally test, she jumped; rising a few feet off the ground, and then landing with an enormous crash that she really hoped wouldn&#39;t destroy the floor like it did in the movies. When the floor stayed in pieces, she clapped her hands in absolute joy: she could move with literally no hindrance. It was like she knew how heavy she was now, but could still move around as if she were her original weight. After a moment of thought, she realized she hadn&#39;t farted uncontrollably in a matter of minutes. She realized that even her flatulence was no longer out of her control, and that she could actually hold it (though the bloating sensation wasn&#39;t any less uncomfortable). She actually laughed with joy. She was in control of her body again! Maybe...just maybe, this wasn&#39;t so bad after all. Yeah, she&#39;d rather not be a flatulent fat-ass, school life will never be the same, and her future is undoubtedly changed for good; however, maybe she could learn to deal with it. Hell, maybe she could even find a good thing that came with her new body. Leaning down, she picked up the white pebble. She&#39;ll hold onto it, if only for reminder&#39;s sake of what transpired that day and to make sure the same fate did not befall onto another (although she highly doubted anyone was weird enough to stick it up their ass let she did). With a sigh, Terra moved to the bathroom to clean up, and get rid of the massive load still dangling in her now way too small panties. She had a lot of explaining to do when her parents came home, and she preferred not being half naked and covered with shit. Just before she entered the bathroom, Terra leaned slightly forward and released a long, loud blast of air out of her ass. She giggled, somewhat enjoying the now immense control she had over her bowels. She suddenly found the idea that she not only could fart at will, but can also control it with precision that she doubted any other person on the planet had. Hey, it was a at least one positive she had for her new body, even if it were a rather childish one. She finally entered the bathroom, preparing herself for her inevitable confrontation with her parents, and after that, her new future.</p>
