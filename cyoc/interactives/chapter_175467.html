<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the girls returned to class, there was a noticeable change in the layout of the room, where once was Jen&#39;s desk, was now an open space with a tarp spread out. A single chair sat near the center. Kristen&#39;s desk also appeared to have been moved to right beside the tarp. <br />
<br />
Guessing correnctly that it was for her, Jen walked over and sat on the chair with her tailcock poking out through the backside. Her cockarms hung limply off to either side of her body too. Kristen took her new seat as well, and found that her chair had an unexpected modification. The chair had a pair of hollow cones protruding out from the center. The tops of which had been removed, creating a inverse funnel-like shape which was pointed directly where her ass and pussy would be when she sits. This likely was why her chair was also on the corner of the tarp. It was all meant to drain out Jen&#39;s cum from inside of her. <br />
<br />
With a bit of hesitation, Kristen slid herself down onto the cones, which slowly pushed their way into her holes. When her ass hit the chair, both cones had gone fully inside of her. They were not very comfortable to sit on. <br />
<br />
Kristen squirmed trying to get the right angle where they didn&#39;t feel quite as awkward. However it was no use, the cones simply made any position she tried uncomfortable. Kristen tried to get up out of the chair, only to find that the cones were stuck inside of her. She couldn&#39;t get them out. She was stuck on the damn cones! <br />
<br />
As she struggled, she could feel both cones widening and opening up into cylinders instead of cones, forcing her pussy and ass to gain an O-shaped opening. It was then that both cylinders began to thin, as they broke off of the chair, silently, and without any sharp or pointed edges. They kept thinning until even Kristen could no longer feel them inside of her. However both her pussy and asshole had kept their new,  always open, O-shaped enterance. <br />
<br />
If Kristen&#39;s face was capable of making expressions, it would be showing one of complete disbelief. However her vacant expression and mindlessly smiling face never even twitched the only time her face really moved anymore was whenever she blinked or spoke. Even her eyes had creased all movement, forcing her to move her entire head to look at something, as now they just stared straight forwards.<br />
<br />
It then dawned on her what had just happend to her. &quot;Did my pussy and ass really just become like a sex doll&#39;s? I know Jen said that I would always have the smiling mouth and eyes of one, but why did my pussy and ass get turned as well?&quot; Thought Kristen to herself. A chill ran up her spine as a cool draft entered her open pussy. She pushed her thighs together, but even doing that failed to shut her open holes completely. She tried to pull out the cylinders, but after investigating her holes, she couldn&#39;t find any trace of them. <br />
<br />
Curiousity had gotten the better of Jen and she had crawled over quietly to underneath Kristen&#39;s desk without her noticing. When she saw the gaping holes, her cocktongue immediately hardened, as well as both of her cockarms, allowing her to be able to move them once again. Using her cockarms, she wrapped them around Kristen&#39;s legs and pulled her thighs apart before burying her cocktongue into her open pussy, slipping it right up inside of her with ease thanks to her new, wider opening. <br />
<br />
Startled by the sudden sex, Kristen let out a surprised shout. Getting the entire classes attention. The teacher looked over towards the girls, and as if it was normal for Jen to to be tongue-fucking Kristen, simply asked them to please keep it down a bit. <br />
<br />
Jen was liking how now everything and anything she did was considered normal. No matter how inappropriate for the current moment it was, everyone just went along, minding their own business. She could feel her newest load building up inside her bresticles as she continued to tongue-fuck Kristen. Finally, she couldnt hold it in anymore and released over 2 gallons of cum inside of Kristen&#39;s pussy, which obviously wasn&#39;t able to contain it all and shot it back out into her face, covering her entire head in her thick, creamy white cum. Which only excited Jen, causing her tail to wag, flinging even more cum around. Again, no one even batted an eye at any of her doings, although she did notice that several of the boys had sprouted errections of their own.<br />
<br />
Her thick cum was now slowly oozing out of Kristen&#39;s fuck hole. It made Jen somewhat curious about how it felt to be fucked by her cocktongue. So she attempted to bend herself in such a way in order to fuck herself with it. Sadly she just couldnt get the angle right, and only managed to push half of the tip inside of herself. She also already knew that her cockarms were way to thick for her pussy too. So she sadly decided to postpone this endeavor for a later date.</p>
