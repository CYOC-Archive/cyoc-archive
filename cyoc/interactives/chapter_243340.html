<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sofia bounded through the forest, her powerful new stag-legs carrying her through the woods with astonishing speed. Her furry chest swelled with each breath, antlers towering proudly as she raced after her friends. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is amazing!&quot; she shouted happily, her voice echoing through the trees. Sofia leapt over a fallen log, feeling her strong muscles bunch and release with power she&#39;d never experienced before. <br />
<br />
The forest blurred around her in a kaleidoscope of greens and browns, sunlight dappling through the canopy overhead. Despite her human-shaped nose, she could smell everything – the rich earth beneath her hooves, the sweet scent of wildflowers, and even better, the alluring scent of her friends somewhere ahead. The pheromones they released called to something primal inside her, making her new penis throb and emerge further from its sheath.<br />
<br />
I can smell them, Sofia thought, her small human nose flaring as she paused to get her bearings. They went in different directions.<br />
But as she ran, something strange happened. A sort of haziness settled over her thoughts, like fog rolling across her mind. Sofia shook her head, confused by the momentary disorientation.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was weird,&quot; she said, blinking rapidly. The sensation passed quickly, and the powerful scent of a doe in heat drew her attention sharply to the right. &quot;There! I think that’s Gwen!”<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, Sofia dashed in that direction, her powerful stag body moving with unstoppable determination. Unknown to her, Angie’s magic had done its work. In that moment, Sofia&#39;s body had split into three identical stags, each pursuing one of her friends. But to Sofia, it seemed she was simply following her chosen doe.<br />
<br />
---- <br />
<br />
Gwen pranced through a thicket of ferns, her deer body moving with surprising agility for someone who normally preferred screen time to outdoor play. She glanced backwards, her human face framed by the curve of her deer neck. Her eyes widened as she spotted Sofia&#39;s antlered form chasing behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll never catch me!&quot; Gwen called out teasingly. The strange new sensations of heat coursing through her body made her feel weirdly giddy and brave. &quot;Come on, slow poke!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia emerged from the trees, her stag body magnificent and imposing. Her human face wore a competitive grin. &quot;I’m gonna get you Gwen! Just you wait!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen giggled and leapt over a small stream, her hooves splashing in the shallows. The water felt cool against her fur, and the sensation sent pleasurable shivers up her spine. Everything felt heightened in this new body – colors seemed brighter, scents more vivid, and touch more intense.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to earn it, Sofia!&quot; she called back, deliberately slowing just enough to keep Sofia interested but not close enough to catch her. Something instinctual guided her movements – a natural knowledge of how to play this strange game. &quot;Show me how strong you are!&quot;<br />
<br />
The pair dashed through a sunny clearing, their hooves kicking up small clouds of dust and fallen leaves. Gwen&#39;s heart pounded with exhilaration – half from the run, half from the strange new feelings of desire that Miss Angie&#39;s spell had awakened in her. She felt powerful and desirable in ways she&#39;d never imagined, and the thought of being caught by Sofia sent thrills of anticipation through her body.<br />
 <br />
----<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in another part of the forest, Holly pranced through a cluster of birch trees, their white trunks creating a natural maze. Her doe body moved gracefully, though she kept stopping to look back, making sure Sofia was still following her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Sofia!&quot; Holly called out cheerfully. &quot;You can do better than that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia – or rather, the second copy of Sofia – burst through the undergrowth, her antlers briefly catching on a low-hanging branch before breaking free. &quot;I’m going to catch you Holly!”<br />
<br />
Holly laughed, the sound strangely human coming from her deer&#39;s body with a girl&#39;s face. &quot;You have to be faster than that! Miss Angie says you have to prove yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
The chase continued for several minutes, with Holly deliberately leading Sofia through increasingly beautiful parts of the forest. They passed a small waterfall that fed into a crystal-clear pool, then through a grove of trees where sunlight streamed down in golden shafts. Finally, they entered a clearing filled with wildflowers – purple asters, white daisies, and bright yellow black-eyed Susans carpeting the ground in a natural tapestry.<br />
<br />
Holly slowed, turning to face Sofia with an expression of wonderment. &quot;Look at this place, Sofia! Isn&#39;t it beautiful?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia trotted into the clearing, her chest heaving from the exertion of the chase. Her human eyes widened as she took in the idyllic setting. &quot;Wow,&quot; she breathed. &quot;It&#39;s like something from a fairytale.&quot;<br />
<br />
The stag and the smaller deer looked around. The clearing seemed to hold a special magic – perhaps it truly did, or perhaps it was simply the natural enchantment of a perfect wilderness spot untouched by human hands. Butterflies danced among the flowers, and the air smelled sweet with nectar and pollen.<br />
<br />
Holly took a few steps toward Sofia, her movements suddenly more deliberate, more sensual. &quot;I think you&#39;ve earned it,&quot; she said, her voice softer now. &quot;You chased me all this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia stood frozen, uncertain what to do next, despite the powerful urges coursing through her new body. &quot;I... I never did this before,&quot; she admitted, her human face flushing pink against her deer&#39;s coat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me neither,&quot; Holly replied with a nervous giggle. &quot;But I think... I think we just do what feels right.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two deer-children approached each other slowly. When they were close enough, Holly rubbed her face against Sofia&#39;s neck in a gentle, affectionate gesture. Sofia returned the touch, amazed at how natural it felt, how right.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is weird,&quot; Sofia said, &quot;but also... nice? I feel like I want to be close to you, but not like when we&#39;re friends. Different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Holly murmured. &quot;It&#39;s like... I want you to touch me. Everywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
 <br />
On a rocky outcropping overlooking the forest, Katie was experiencing the same thing. She and her copy of Sofia were on a small cliff, dotted with pine trees with a stunning view of the forest canopy below. The late morning sun warmed their fur as Katie finally slowed her pace, turning to face her pursuer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You caught me,&quot; she said, slightly out of breath as Sofia – the third magical copy – approached her. &quot;You&#39;re fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia&#39;s chest swelled with pride. &quot;I&#39;m strong, too,&quot; she said, flexing her powerful stag&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Do you like my antlers?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie giggled, moving closer to inspect them. &quot;Yep. You look like a real stag now!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two deer circled each other slowly, their human faces showing a mixture of childish curiosity and something deeper, more primal that came from their animal bodies. Katie felt a strange fluttering in her stomach, a warmth that spread through her entire body. Being this close to Sofia made her heart beat faster.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel weird,&quot; Katie admitted, her voice dropping to a near-whisper. &quot;But like... a good weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia nodded, her human face serious despite the animal body beneath it. &quot;Me too. I feel like I want to be close to you. Really close.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without fully understanding why, Katie moved forward until their muzzles touched. The contact sent electric shivers down her spine. Then, following an impulse she couldn&#39;t have explained, she tilted her head and pressed her human lips against Sofia&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Their kiss was just innocent at first. But then something changed. Katie felt Sofia&#39;s tongue touch hers, and a moan escaped her throat. The kiss deepened, became more exploratory, their tongues sliding against each other as they learned this new way of touching.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; Sofia breathed when they finally pulled apart. &quot;That was... amazing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie nodded, feeling dizzy with new sensations. Then, suddenly, she felt another urge – this one seemingly coming directly from her deer body rather than her human mind. She turned away from Sofia, positioning her hindquarters toward her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I feel like I need to...&quot; Katie said, embarrassed but unable to resist the impulse. A warm stream of urine began flowing from her, splashing onto the rocky ground below. &quot;Oh! I&#39;m sorry, I couldn&#39;t hold it!&quot;<br />
<br />
But Sofia didn&#39;t seem disgusted. Instead, her nostrils flared as she caught the scent, her eyes widening with a new kind of interest. Something about Katie&#39;s natural marking called to Sofia&#39;s stag instincts, making her new penis emerge fully from its sheath, hard and ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be sorry,&quot; Sofia said, her voice deeper than usual. &quot;It smells... good.&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
 <br />
Some distance away, Gwen and her copy of Sofia had reached a similar point in their courtship. The two were by a flowing stream, and Gwen had his rear presented to Sofia as well. The smaller girl-turned-deer let her urine sprinkle upon some grass next to the stream, with the sound of the waters mixing with that of her tinkling bladder. <br />
<br />
“Sorry, I really needed to do that.” said Gwen, her human face red with embarrassment. &quot;Is that weird?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Sofia replied, watching with fascination. &quot;We&#39;re deer now, right? Deer probably do this all the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen relaxed. The release felt strangely satisfying to her, and she noticed Sofia watching intently, nostrils flaring to catch the scent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it smell bad?&quot; Gwen asked worriedly.<br />
<br />
Sofia shook her head, moving closer. &quot;No. It smells... right.&quot; Following an impulse she didn&#39;t understand, Sofia leaned forward and actually licked at Gwen&#39;s rear, her tongue exploring the doe&#39;s private areas. Gwen gave a yelp, as she even felt Sofia pressing her nose against her butthole, inhaling deeply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sofia!&quot; Gwen exclaimed, but she didn&#39;t move away. The sensation of Sofia&#39;s tongue sent shivers of pleasure through her body. &quot;Oh…that feels good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia continued her exploration, driven by strange new instincts. She could feel her penis growing, emerging fully erect from its furry sheath. The feeling was incredible – throbbing and hard, demanding attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I need to...&quot; Sofia began, not knowing how to express what her body wanted. Instead, she moved behind Gwen, placing her front hooves on either side of Gwen&#39;s flanks. She positioned herself, her erect member probing between Gwen&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Gwen gasped as she felt Sofia&#39;s hardness press against her. &quot;Are we going to...?&quot;<br />
<br />
“Yeah,&quot; Sofia replied, her voice trembling with excitement and nervousness. &quot;Is that okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gwen nodded, surrendering to the powerful new heat in her body. &quot;Yes. I want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a tentative thrust, Sofia pushed forward, her penis finding Gwen&#39;s opening. Both deer-children gasped at the sensation – a pleasure unlike anything they&#39;d ever experienced before.<br />
 <br />
----<br />
<br />
In the wildflower meadow, Holly and her Sofia had reached the same stage too. Holly had just finished urinating, marking the ground with her scent, when Sofia mounted her from behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhh!&quot; Holly cried out as she felt Sofia&#39;s hard length push inside her. &quot;It feels so big!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does it hurt?&quot; Sofia asked, concerned despite the overwhelming pleasure coursing through her.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little,&quot; Holly admitted. &quot;But also really, really good. Don&#39;t stop!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sofia began to move, thrusting her hips in a rhythm that came naturally to her new body. The meadow filled with the sounds of their breathing and occasional soft moans. Butterflies continued to dance around them, oblivious to the mating ritual taking place among the flowers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love being a deer,&quot; Holly gasped between thrusts. &quot;This feels amazing!&quot;<br />
<br />
As Sofia continued rutting against Holly, both deer-children felt a strange tingling sensation spreading across their faces. Their human features began to push outward, stretching and reshaping into deer muzzles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holly!&quot; Sofia exclaimed, her voice sounding strange as her mouth and nose elongated. &quot;Your face! It&#39;s changing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Holly tried to respond, but her words came out as a strange mix of human speech and animal sounds. &quot;Sofia, yours t-nnnghhh!&quot; Her voice dissolved into a deer&#39;s bleat as her transformation accelerated.<br />
<br />
Their human hair disappeared, replaced by the short fur that covered the rest of their bodies. Their eyes shifted to the sides of their heads, growing larger and darker. Their ears completed their transformation, becoming fully deer-like and highly mobile.<br />
<br />
With their transformation complete, something else changed too – their human consciousness began to fade, replaced by the simpler awareness of the animals they had become. The stag no longer remembered being Sofia, the human girl. It knew only that it was mating with a receptive doe, fulfilling its natural purpose.<br />
<br />
The doe that had been Holly experienced the same shift, losing her human identity as animal instincts took over. The pleasure of mating remained, perhaps even intensified without the filter of human thought.<br />
<br />
The stag thrust harder, faster, driven by pure instinct now. The doe brayed with pleasure, her tail flicking as she accepted his seed. With a final powerful thrust, the stag reached climax, filling the doe with his essence as both animals trembled with pleasure.<br />
 <br />
----<br />
<br />
Up on the rocky outcropping, Katie and her Sofia experienced the same final changes. As Sofia mounted Katie from behind, their faces began to change, pushing outward into deer muzzles while their human consciousness faded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sofia! My f-faaaahhhh!&quot; Katie&#39;s words became an animal&#39;s cry as her ability to speak disappeared along with her human face.<br />
<br />
The stag that had been Sofia continued thrusting, untroubled by the loss of human identity. If anything, the pleasure intensified as conscious thought gave way to pure animal sensation. The transformation freed them both to experience mating as deer truly would – without shame, without hesitation, guided only by nature&#39;s ancient rhythms.<br />
<br />
When the stag climaxed inside the doe, both animals cried out in their deer voices, the sounds echoing across the forest below. The doe&#39;s legs trembled as she accepted the stag&#39;s seed, her body fulfilling the purpose that had driven their chase.<br />
<br />
----<br />
 <br />
By the stream, Gwen and her Sofia reached their peak as well, their human faces stretching into deer muzzles just as pleasure overwhelmed them both.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sofia! I&#39;m feeling something incredibhaaaannngh!&quot; Gwen&#39;s words dissolved into animal sounds as her transformation completed.<br />
<br />
The stag thrust deeply one final time, his penis pulsing as he released his seed inside the receptive doe. Neither remembered their human names now, or the fact that they had once been children at a summer camp. They knew only the satisfaction of mating, of fulfilling the lustful needs that drove all living beasts.<br />
<br />
----<br />
 <br />
From a further distance, sitting cross-legged on a fallen log, Miss Angie watched it all through her magical sight. Her vision split three ways, allowing her to witness each coupling simultaneously. She smiled with satisfaction as she watched the three deer couples – all involving the same magically triplicated stag – experience pleasure together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now,&quot; she murmured to herself. &quot;Looks like the girls are having quite a wonderful time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The witch watched as the newly transformed deer, no longer possessing human minds, nuzzled each other affectionately in the aftermath of their mating. The three stags – all copies of Sofia under one mind – stood proudly beside their respective does, occasionally licking their mates&#39; faces or necks in gestures of affection.<br />
<br />
In the meadow, the stag and doe that had been Sofia and Holly grazed peacefully side by side, occasionally touching noses or rubbing against each other. By the stream, the other pair drank the cool water, their reflections showing only ordinary deer now. And on the rocky outcropping, the third couple stood silhouetted against the sky, the stag&#39;s antlers catching the midday sunlight.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should probably call them back soon,&quot; Angie mused, tapping her chin thoughtfully. &quot;But they deserve a little time to enjoy being wild things.&quot;<br />
<br />
She watched as the deer couples mingled, moving through the woods with the natural grace of forest beasts. They showed no sign of remembering their human selves, no confusion or distress at their transformation. They were, for this magical moment, simply deer – living fully in their animal bodies, guided by animal instincts.<br />
<br />
Angie gave a soft smile, as she observed the transformed girls in her mind. Despite her mischievous nature, she did care for the kids under her charge. This experience, she believed, would give them something special – a connection to nature that few humans ever experienced, and pleasures that most wouldn&#39;t discover for many years.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, those girls certainly earned their nature badges.</p>
