<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the next five minutes, Dona and Tray continued to walk down the sidewalk, heading to their house while both Bobby and Wendy followed them, to see what type of changes would take place when they grow younger.  So far, the changes were pretty apparent for them, but not the couple.  They both regressed down to 2 more years, making both Dona 20 and Tray 25.  Their sizes shrunk a little bit and their bodies diminished a little bit.  But nothing else had changed yet.  As the two were walking, Dona started to hug Tray’s arm and nuzzle it a lot.<br />
<br />
“Oh Tray,” she said in a pleasant and lovely tone, “I’m so glad that you would take me out tonight.  I just hope my mother won’t find out the truth.  I mean I told her that I would be going to the movies tonight with my friends.  If she knew about this, I’m going to be in big trouble.”  Tray looked at his now girlfriend, and stroked her hair a little bit, trying to clam her down.  “It’s okay babe,” he said in a relaxing voice, “if she does find out about our relationship, we’ll tell her the truth.  Besides, no matter what happens, we will always be together.”  Dona looked up to Troy with sparkling eyes and felt the warmness of her heart burning inside of her.  The two then braced each other in a loving kiss and continued to walk on.<br />
<br />
But what the two didn’t know was that not only were their bodies were regressing, but their minds as well.  When they were both 25 and 30 years of age, they were once a young couple that got married a few years ago.  Not only that, but also Dona’s mother and father died in a car crash when she was 21 and after their death, she went to Tray’s house for some comfort.  As they were growing younger, Dona’s memories of her wedding, her parents funeral, and the accident vanished within her head, making her think her family is still alive and well.  Tray’s memories were changing as well from both his wedding with Dona and attending to her parent’s funeral.  And though their minds and bodies were getting younger, the world around them was still the same as always.<br />
<br />
As the two daters were walking, Bobby and Wendy followed them, watching as the metamorphosis takes place.  They were completely intrigued at the fact their bodies and minds were reverting back to their proper ages but Dona wanted to see how much further his lover had regressed the two.  So they walked the same path the two young couple are and wanted to see more of what’s to come.<br />
<br />
After the next few minutes of walking, they all made it to Tray’s house, which is a one floor stretched house with a garage and a pool in the back.  “Well here we are.” said Tray, “Home sweet home.  You want to come in for our special get together?”  Dona thought about it and answered, “Sure, why not.  Let me use your phone so that way my parents know where I am.”  Tray nodded as the two headed towards the house.  What they didn’t know was that Bobby and Tray were hiding behind a big tree so that the couple won’t notice them following their every move.  They peeked behind the trunk to get a good view of the youthening stages that were taking place right about now.<br />
<br />
As the two couple approached the door, they both lost another year of their lives.  Dona was down to the age of 19, now entering her teenage years.  She had lost an inch or two on her height as her body slowly diminished.  Her boobs shrunk to a couple of centimeters while her hips compressed a little bit.  Her arms and legs were a little shorter, but she was still tall enough to pass as a young woman.  Her skin complexion was a little lighter then before, but she still that caramel and cream complexion of her Latin assets.  Soon as she got younger, her clothes changed once again to match her age.  Her purple tank top gotten lighter and was a lighter color.    The sleeves of her top shorten until they were nothing but thin strips as her lower hem grew back down to cover her stomach and covered the top part of her skirt.  Soon her tank top was turned into a solid knit light purple cami.  Her skin tight skirt began to lower the bottom hem, making it go down below the knees as the fabric went soft and the color change to a light brown color, making it a slim pencil demin skirt.  Her pantyhose completely vanished without a trace, leaving her smooth tone legs as the heels of her shoes to go down to two inches and darken to a blacker color.  The hoop earrings on her ears shrunk a little bit and the bracelet’s gold color faded completely and diamond rhinestones covered the wrist.  Her black hair shrunk up a little bit, but still kept it’s lustful shine.  Dona’s memories soon changed next as her future memories faded into non-existence.  As she was walking, Dona thought it was great to graduate through high school and can’t wait to go to the same college as her boyfriend.  Knowing that he was continuing his education in office professionalism, she wanted to be with him so that they would never get separated from four to five years.<br />
<br />
Ask for Tray, he was not far behind his girlfriend.  He was now 24 and still showed the same physics as before, but with only a few subtle changes.  For instance, peach fuzz was growing on his chin, making him look a little tough as his hair grew out a little, making it a little raggedy.  His clothes changed once more for his appropriate age.  His polo shirt split open in the middle front as buttons appeared one side and little holes appeared the others.  The color was now blue plaid, as the sleeves grew a little long.  Soon enough, he was wearing a short sleeve button plaid shirt.  His kaki shorts grew down to turn into plain kaki pants and his shoes darken a little more, making them black sole shoes.  His memories also arranges, as he wanted his girlfriend to come to his college so that he would spend his time with Dona.<br />
<br />
The two entered into Tray’s house, not knowing that another couple was spying on them the whole time.  Both Bobby and Wendy watched on as the two went in and wanted to see more.  So Bobby looked at his lover and asked, “So, you wanna see more of the mayhem?”  Wendy turned to see him and answered, “Well we made it this far.  Let’s see what happens next.”  The two then approached the house to get a better view of the next changes.</p>
