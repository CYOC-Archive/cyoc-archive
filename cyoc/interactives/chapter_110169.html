<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Louis’s Collected Souls:<br />
Wolf, Orc, Dragon.<br />
<br />
Hawk’s Collected Souls:<br />
Hawk, Rat, Rabbit, (others unknown).<br />
<br />
Louis gulped. Hawk looked at him with earnest, innocent eyes. <br />
<br />
Why should he be nervous? He had been happy to show any random stranger all his forms during that drunken night in Stonewater. Why should he be scared of showing Hawk, who understood more than anyone what it was like?<br />
<br />
‘Okay,’ said Louis, his heart pounding. He put down what remained of his rabbit and got to his feet. Hawk leant forward onto his knees, watching Louis intently. Louis didn’t want to turn his back on Hawk, in case Hawk thought him embarrassed, but he still turned away, watching the fire instead of Hawk’s piercing eyes.<br />
<br />
Louis undressed. Hawk was unabashed by nakedness, so why should he be? He dropped his tunic, trousers and boots onto the flattened grass. Hawk fidgeted in his delight. ‘Do the dragon first,’ he said.<br />
<br />
Obeying, Louis calmly took a few steps into grass. Once he had enough space, he turned back to Hawk, who had stood to get a better view. Then, Louis swelled. <br />
<br />
He was prepared for it this time, so the feeling did not overwhelm him. Still, all nervousness was forgotten as his veins filled with strength and fire. He roared with the power and his human voice became a deep, haunting shriek. His naked body rose into the cool night air, which he greeted with outstretched arms and, soon, outstretched wings. Size filled his muscles, his head, his neck, his torso, his cock and looked down at Hawk, a small, naked man marvelling at the sight of him. <br />
<br />
Louis dropped to all fours and lowered his neck to bring his head down to Hawk’s level. Hawk breathed a gasp and raised his hand to touch Louis’s snout. Louis opened his mouth and dragged his long, pointed tongue across Hawk’s chest and face, drenching him with dragon saliva. Hawk groaned and pushed Louis away.<br />
<br />
Louis stepped closer, but each step became shorter than the last, so that he drew no closer. His dark, scaly hide disappeared beneath thick, silvery fur. His tail whipped inwards until it was short and fluffy. His spiny teeth shortened into fangs. As he shrank, Hawk seemed to swell in front of him. Louis kept eye contact, watching Hawk’s head adjust from looking up to looking down. Once he’d finished, he stopped walking and sat before Hawk obediently.<br />
<br />
‘Wolf,’ said Hawk appreciatively. He patted Louis on the head, who wagged his tail. He licked Hawk again, on the thigh, realising too late what part of Hawk his eye line was level with now.<br />
<br />
‘You killed a dragon with a wolf?’ said Hawk. ‘I thought I was foolhardy for trying it with a hawk. Your last form must be impressive…’<br />
<br />
Louis yipped in agreement. He reared onto his hind legs and grew. Hawk’s midriff sank out of view and was soon followed by his grinning face. Louis’s forelegs readjusted into meaty arms. His hindlegs pushed him upward off the ground. His snout retreated, though his lower fangs protruded into tusks. His olive skin was revealed as his fur thinned, for the most part, but darkened into hair across his muscular torso, his chin and lightly over his arms and legs. His cock flopped out of his sheath and made a conspicuous slap as it hit his dangling jewels.<br />
<br />
The noise attracted Hawk’s attention. He was standing mere inches away from Louis, his head barely reaching Louis’s broad pectorals. He looked downwards at the source of the sound, while Louis’s green face became a darker green.<br />
<br />
‘Ah, sorry,’ he said, in his deep, orcish rumble.<br />
Hawk looked up again. ‘A shy orc?’ he remarked.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Louis thought he was growing again. Then he realised Hawk was lowering himself, crouching so that his head was level with Louis’s groin. Louis’s heart thundered, pumping gallons of blood through his huge body and, ultimately into his cock. It sprung to attention suddenly and hit Hawk across the chin.<br />
<br />
‘Ah!’ Louis stepped back, covering himself. But though his hands were big, his organ was bigger. ‘I’m sorry. It was… it was an orc thing. It makes me more, uh, lusty.’<br />
<br />
But Hawk just smiled. ‘It’s so funny to see an orc so bashful.’ He crept forward, pulled Louis’s hands away and replaced them with his own. Louis stared down at the small man’s smiling face as he guided his cock into his mouth.<br />
<br />
Louis was stunned. Nobody had never put a hand on his organ other than himself, let alone a mouth. He had always fancied, should it ever happen, it would have been a plain farmer’s daughter from a neighbouring valley. He had never even considered it might be a dark, handsome man. <br />
<br />
His first instinct was to push Hawk away, to scold him for so rash and debauched behaviour. But the orc in his head shushed him. A shiver rumbled through his whole body at the pleasure of it. The orc reminded him he was beyond the laws of man now. What did it matter if it felt so good?<br />
<br />
If he was to prevent it, he had to do it now.</p>
