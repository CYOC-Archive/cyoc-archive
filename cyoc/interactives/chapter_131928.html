<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked to a long list of dinosaurs he wants to turn into and didn’t know which one to pick.  But after a bit of consideration, he immediately knew which creature he wants to be.  Of all the dinosaurs, the velociraptor is the best choice he has.  Raptors are the more fiercest and cunning predators out there with their speed and prowlness necessary to hunt and devour their prey.  It was the perfect creature for him to become.  So feeling excited, he immediately type down his profile, along with the dinosaur he wanted to turn into.  After filling in the blanks and select the drop down options, he soon did a quick review of the profile and was satisfied.<br />

<br />
Jeff looked to the choices and knew this is what he wanted.  He wanted to be a raptor forever, living in the present and have no worries of his future.  He wanted to have all human memories and emotions replaced with a vicious predator and act like he has always been a raptor all his life.  He wanted to leave his family and friends behind just so he can hunt animals live in an environment suitable for a dinosaur like him.  It was his dream of being a dinosaur and it was coming true for him.<br />
<br />
Before he could even change, he took a good look at his full-length mirror to see his human body one more time.  So far, he could see being a human is boring.  He was an average build teen with short light brown hair and lighter brown eyes, wearing a black and white striped shirt, lightly faded blue jeans, and white sneakers.  Looking at himself, he knew that he was going to abandon his human life in exchange for a vicious dinosaur meant to hunt and devour prey.  But he didn’t care.  He wanted to become a velociraptor because he enjoys the idea of an adventure and survival.  With a bit of a glance, he looked to the mirror and said to himself, “Goodbye Jeff…  You might have a good life, but I feel like its time for the raptor to get out of this shell.”<br />
<br />
Returning to the computer, he moved the mouse to the ‘Begin Change’ button and clicked on it.  By the time he pressed it, a warning message appeared and it reads.<br />
<br />
‘Warning!<br />
<br />
By choosing these options, you are permitted to permanently change into a dinosaur in a modern world.  The Chronivac is not held responsible for the destruction of property and death of innocent people or the user.  Are you sure you wish to continue?’<br />
<br />
And below it are two buttons with one saying ‘yes’ and the other saying ‘no’.  Reading it, Jeff knew that it was serious and would have consequences.  But he really wanted to be a raptor for the rest of his life and didn’t care about the repercussions.  So with determination, he said out loud, “Fuck yeah I want to continue.  Eternal life as a raptor, here I come!”  He soon clicked on yes and another message appeared with a countdown timer starting in ten minutes with a title above it that says…<br />
<br />
‘Thank you for choosing the Chronivac!  Enjoy your change!’<br />
<br />
Soon enough, the timer counted down as the clock went for 10:00 to 9:59 to 9:58 and so one.  At the same time, he could feel a tingle spreading from head to toe and knew that his changes are starting, he waited for anticipation, as he was ready break out of this human body and a dinosaur emerging out of it.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, he felt a chill and crossed his arms with a lot of shivering.  Jeff’s thought that his body was starting to become cold blooded as the body temperature dropping like a rock.  Slowly getting up off his chair, he slowly walked to his mirror to observe his changes, rubbing his arms from the immediate chill, his peach skin started to darken a little.  He soon placed his hands on the border of the mirror and breathed heavily, with cold sweat pouring down his face.  Slowly looking up, he opened his eyes and has already saw the start of the change.<br />
<br />
His eyes have changed completely as they were now yellow instead of brown and white while his pupils were nothing put slits of a reptile.  Seeing this, he was happy as he could feel his body and mind going the way of the dinosaur.  “Yes…!  It’s working!” he said as he smiled in front of a mirror.  That’s when he could see all of his perfect teeth starting to get pointy and sharp.  He starred his face down; eager to see what other changes will take place.<br />
<br />
His excitement caused him to tighten his hands on the border of the mirror, feeling imaginable strength coming into his body.  Suddenly, he could feel the sound of wood chipping in the back as it sounds like the nails were digging into the wood’s surface.  Curious, he let go of the mirror and observed his hands, seeing them changing as well.  He could see three of his nails darkening and pointing, getting longer and sharper.  The three fingers in the middle started to longer and inhuman like while his pinkies and thumbs shrunk and weakened as they was absorbing right into his deforming hands.  He could also see what looked like splotches of brown on his wrists and slowly spreading through his hands.  When the changes finished, he flexed his three clawed fingers and marveled at the sight of it.  So that’s what a raptor’s hands look like.” He said as his voice sounded hoarse and inhuman, “Nice…”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he could feel his feet cramping in his sneaker.  Feeling that, he stepped back and took a seat on his bed, trying to get comfortable.  He soon lifted up his left shoe and noticed a bunch of bumps at the front of it and slowly growing.  He kept on starring it for a few seconds until the surface broke and he could see five dark claws growing out of it.  He watched in fascination as the claws continued to grow while the rest of his feet deforming and tightening the rest of his sneaker.  He soon lifted his other shoe and saw the same thing as another five sets of claws growing out of the front and expanding.  A part of him wished he had removed his shoes and socks, as they don’t get damaged.  But he felt like keeping them on because having his clothes torn is shedding his human life and make way for his new Raptor life.  He kept on watching as a new change took place.  First, the four little toes on each side started to draw together and merged into two toes, growing bigger along with his extending claws, tearing more of his sneakers in the process.  Then the two big toes grew bigger and cracked, lifting the claw up and causing it to curve.  The rest of his sneakers couldn’t take the strain anymore as the laces untie themselves and the seams were already showing.  Almost instantly, the shoes burst out leaving fully changed feet that matches that of a Velociraptor with blotches of brown skin spreading his remnants of his socks looking like spider webs.  Jeff soon placed his newly created feet on the floor and look down to them, tapping one of the curbed claws out of function.  He smirked and said, “This is so cool!  I now have claws on my feet too!  Can’t wait to try these out!”<br />
<br />
Just as he said that, he felt his stomach gurgling and wondered if he was hungry.  Out of instinct, he used his claw hands to tear off his striped shirt to reveal his upper body.  Looking to the mirror, he did look good before the Chronivac.  He started working out in the gym and he could see signs of his hard work.  His pecks looked solid in a teen like physic and there were faint signs of abs showing on his stomach.  He was hoping to be part of his football team in high school and then joined the military, like his older brother.  But he is now starting to throw it all away to be a dinosaur for the rest of his life.  And a part of him felt like this is what’s best for him.  In fact, he could feel his mind simplifying as memories and human knowledge was slowly vanishing in his mind.  But he didn’t care of that, as he wants to get rid of everything human about him.<br />
<br />
His stomach grumbled again; as he looked down to see what’s going on.  That’s when he noticed his body slowly shifting.  What started is that his bit of abs slowly faded away as his stomach started to expand.  The same can be said with his chest as the muscles shrank and compressed.  The expansion of his stomach soon caused his pants to join the ride as the button started to pop off and the zipper went downward.  He could see more brown splotches appearing there too as it slowly spreads across his body.  He patted his bloated stomach and was shocked by this sudden change.  “Wow…  I’ve gained weight!  Wasn’t expecting that.  Maybe it’s part of being a raptor.  Oh well…  Sacrifices must be made to live your dream.”<br />
<br />
As he said that, he noticed something off about his voice.  It sounded like his voice, but it was lower and somewhat rougher.  It’s almost like it was a tad bestial then human.  Still, he could still speak normal, but it would be a matter of time before he looses his voice completely.  He even notices his nose looking bigger and he could see it as plain as day.  He looked to the mirror to see if there were more changes.  That’s when he noticed his face pushing off comically.  His nose continued to grow further and wider as his nostrils flared up as his breathing was deeper then before.  That soon led to other parts of his head joining his extending nose.  His lips were first to go as they stretched along with his nostrils.  The lips were slowly thinning halfway through.  He could see his teeth slowly exposed as they grew sharper and exposing spaces in between with new teeth growing in from the back of the expanding gums.  His eyes were next to go as his vision got split in separate direction.  He knew that his eyes were going further apart as he was seeing two different sides.  He turned his shifting head to see the mirror on one end while his other eye was looking at the other end of the room.  It was alien for Jeff to see two different sides, but this is what dinosaurs see, so he has to live with it.  His ears soon started to shrink until they were half their size and looked under developed.  And the hair on top of his head started to fall in clumps, leaving half of it on while his eyebrows and lashes plucked downwards and floated to the floor.  Plus his mind continued to get smaller and was 50% empty, making him forget most of his life and the knowledge of high school and most of middle school.  Already, Jeff could see his that those changes stopped as his head and face is half human and half raptor with normal human skin.  He looked like a freak in his look as he said in a rougher and bestial voice, “Damn…  I look so surreal like this.  Can’t wait until the end results.”<br />
<br />
As he said that, he started to blush a little and felt a little aroused.  It’s because increased his sex drive to 75% so that her raptor side would mostly feel horny.  And it was evident that he looked down to see that his penis is sticking up through his boxers.  Slowly, he carefully pulled his pants and boxers down with his raptor hands and saw his dick tenting up high.  Starring at it, he knew that he needed to do.  “So horny…” he said in an animalistic groan, “Must masturbate…  Must release…”  So he raptor hand on his privates and stroke up and down to unleash his load without a care.  But as he was pumping, his disk started to change.<br />
<br />
His shaft started to extend longer and curved in the middle, making it less human like.  At the same time, the mushroom tip and the foreskin merged together the curved tip started to shift into a point.  His balls started to expand and grew completely bigger then imagined, like the shape of blimps.  And all of his pubic hair detached and gathered in the bottom of his underwear, leaving him completely bare.  Soon enough, he has a dinosaur like penis as he continued to stroke on it hard.<br />
<br />
At the same time, his human skin started to chip and darken, loosing his peach like color and starting to get green while scales started to appear.  Jeff stroke harder and harder as he was on the verge of a blissful orgy.  Almost immediately, he screamed in the climax, which turned into an inhuman shriek as cum spewed out of the tip.  At the same time, his spine started to crack and pushed him forward; this led him to fall off his bed and landed on the floor with pre cum dribbling on the floor.  Just then, his dick slivered up to his skin and a pouch was formed to suck it back, leaving it completely bare like that of a snake.  Jeff breathed heavily and said in a tiring voice, “That was good…”  As he said that, his brain kept getting smaller and he felt more stupid, with memories of his friends and family was slowly evaporating.  But the changes weren’t done yet as he was half dinosaur, half human and it is slowly changing more and more.<br />
<br />
His pants started to get tighter as his hips were widening and fattening up with muscles, making it suitable to pouncing on an unsuspected prey.  It started to get worse as a nub was growing from behind him and was growing bigger.  That nub soon broke out and extended forwards, becoming a tail with darkening skin that was continued to extend longer.  That rip caused the pants and break free and floated down in tatters, leaving him half naked with his shirt already tearing a bit.<br />
<br />
Jeff slowly got up but couldn’t get up fully due to his posture shifted.  But he didn’t need to stand as a human as he felt more bestial in his position.  His arms and legs made a bigger change then the rest of his body.  His legs soon cracked and bended downward for a lower position, with added leg strength to jump at longer distances.  His arms though started to loose muscle mass and shorten, with bones cracking to make them immobile to move around.  Feeling the change, he grabbed the collar of his shirt and said with his vocabulary breaking down.  “Clothes useless…  Must shed…  Be free…”  With one huge pull, he tore the shirt off of him and was completely exposed.<br />
<br />
His body was going through the last of the changes as his upper body compressed and his shoulders cracked.  The nipples of his already changed chest disappeared in his body and were nonexistent.  His skin grew darker and scalier until it looked like a beige green color with a lighter green on the belly.  After that bit of shifting his body was completely velociraptor while his head was half changed.  Jeff could feel his mind getting dumber, as he accepted the change he did to himself.<br />
<br />
“Jeff weak…  Raptor strong…  Human no more…  Dino forever…”<br />
<br />
Those were his last words as his vocabulary is no more and his vocal cords were gone, replaced with vicious snarls from his mouth.  His skull kept on extending outward and was turning into a raptor like snout.  His lips thinned completely and exposed his sharp teeth with more growing at the back of his gums.  His ears shrunk even more a vanished completely, leaving behind two little holes that are impossible to see.  And what’s left of his hair on top of his head fell off in clumps and, leaving him completely bald.  He lifted his fully formed high in the air and let out a ferocious like shriek, showing his growing tongue as it reaches the end of his snout mouth.  At the same time, all of Jeff’s memories were gone, as he doesn’t know his own name.  The only thing he did know is four things; to hunt, to kill, to fuck, and to survive.  Once he was finished, time was up and the transformation ceased.<br />
<br />
In a number of ten minutes, Jeff was no more.  In his place is a vicious velociraptor standing around tattered clothes and clumps of hair, surveying the room and wondering what it was doing there.</p>
