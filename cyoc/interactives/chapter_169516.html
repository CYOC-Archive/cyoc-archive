<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You&#39;d signed the contract, you&#39;d boarded the flying-boat-hotel, you&#39;d been treated like first class royalty by the... rather usual staff. They were all plastic animal women, naked, but devoid of openings below the neck, and with no belly button and devoid of nipples on their breasts. They moved about on their own, a polite knock revealed they were hollow, but were capable of having casual conversation with the guests, but when pressed for details of the event,  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said a large white plastic buxom bunny, who&#39;s name tag read &#39;Gaia&#39;, &quot;We can&#39;t show any favor to any of the guests or contestants. It&#39;s an order to avoid a lawsuit.&quot; <br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t the only person here, not by a long shot, but you weren&#39;t sure how many were here to take part, or were just here to observe the fun. <br />
<br />
&quot;I heard a hundred of us are contestants!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard ninety-nine of us are!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sixty!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sixy-four!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Twelve!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sixteen!&quot;<br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t the first of this contest, and it wouldn&#39;t be the last. But win or lose, you&#39;d either be unable, or have to be the most starved adrenaline junkie on the planet to go through it twice! <br />
<br />
The ship landed, and a large plastic gray wolf woman wearing only a holster for a taser and radio asked, <br />
&quot;This is the last time any of you will be asked, once you step off the boat, you agree to take part in the event of your own free will, no &#39;take backs&#39; beyond this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gathering your courage, you stepped off the flying-hotel-boat with the other human beings.<br />
<br />
With the crowd you walk past several eight foot tall golden nude statues of various animal women in countless poses from modest to lewd, though you did notice that like the dolls that were missing the &#39;finer&#39; details.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s dark, so you can&#39;t tell how big the island is, but the auditorium you are led into is brightly lit. <br />
<br />
A plastic black and white cat girl stands on the stage with a microphone, being held up by a pair of platinum giant fox women statues.<br />
<br />
She waved as you all sat down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi everyone! You can call me Eostre! I see you&#39;ve met Leto!&quot; She gestured the plastic wolf woman.<br />
<br />
She announced happily, &quot;And welcome contestants to Transformation Elimination Island! An artificial island created in international waters! No, not gonna say where! You&#39;ll find GPS has been disabled on all your devices, which you are contactually obliged to turn in, now. There is a numbered storage box underneath your seat with a key, don&#39;t lose it. And don&#39;t be cheeky by trying to sneak one by us. And for those of you who came here hoping for grand fame even if you lost, don&#39;t worry, our hidden cameras will upload your destiny to your live stream! <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re all here because you&#39;ve either signed our contestant contract, or someone who had the legal authority to gave their blessing for you. Meaning you&#39;re either desperate enough, greedy enough, bored enough, or just happen to have a kink that you won&#39;t be able to satisfy any other way. <br />
<br />
She then switched to a bored deadpan. &quot;Due international investigations we are also obligated to announce the following. <br />
<br />
&quot;No employee or beneficiary of the Transformation Elimination Island Team nor its associates make take part in the game to ensue we aren&#39;t just giving the prizes to ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
She began to speak enthusiastically again. &quot;And what ARE those prizes you may ask? As your contract explained, YOU ARE!&quot; She pointed dramatically. &quot;Only one of you is leaving this island human, heck, only one of you is leaving this island an organic being and a legal person!&quot; She ginned, showing off her plastic, but still sharp teeth. &quot;We&#39;ve got people who are going to be betting heavily on which one of you walks away the winner here!&quot;<br />
<br />
She picked up what looked like the toy gun used for an 1980s video game console. &quot;This is a zapper. You will each be given one, that can only be fired by you. It&#39;ll only work on other contestants. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your zappers are indestructible and immune to transformation, and will only function within the perimeter of the island itself. Also, you can&#39;t zap yourself, keep that in mind,&quot; she said spinning the gun around by the trigger. <br />
<br />
&quot;You target will be, by your own will, turned into either a statue like these two lovely ladies are.&quot; She gestured at the two platinum statues holding up the stage. &quot;Or a living life size doll like myself.&quot; She struck a pose. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your figure, height, hair, colors, etcetera, when zapped will all be based on your own ideal woman, (not the person zapping you) so if you end up a beach-ball chested air-head, then you have only yourself to blame.<br />
<br />
&quot;What always-female humanoid animal shape you&#39;ll become when zapped will also be based on your own favored animal, er, within limits. It had to be a bird, a reptile, or a mammal, sorry, no buggies, fishies, or froggies here. Oh and it must be a &#39;real&#39; animal, no unicorns or dragons here, sorry.&quot; She bowed apologetically at this part. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t have a favorite animal in that category or if you&#39;re cheeky and your favorite animal is human, it&#39;ll be the favorite animal of your zapper, if the above still applies, it&#39;ll cycle randomly through &#39;fox&#39; &#39;cat&#39; &#39;wolf&#39; and &#39;bunny.&#39;&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see, our always-female statues will be nude, but lack the naughty bits. Same with us living dolls. Don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re turned into a statue, you&#39;ll retain consciousness, and the resulting mental changes will have you just be THAT into being a pretty statue for eternity that you couldn&#39;t BEAR be made flesh and blood again. You&#39;ll be legally a work of art to be owned.<br />
<br />
&quot;What material you are made out of as a statue, and what pose you have, and what kinda pedestal, your engraving, etc, will be decided by your zapper. Also, you&#39;ll be immobile as a statue, but be able to telepathically communicate with any other transformed statue and your senses won&#39;t be limited to where you were looking when zapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;As living anthro girl dolls meaningwhile... You&#39;ll be naked, but lack any naughty bits. You&#39;ll be sapient and animate, a self-perpetual motion machine, and see yourself as a doll that is an object that is owned that exists too make your master&#39;s life easier, and you&#39;ll be fine with that. Which you legally will be. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve sworn under oath that regardless if you end up a immobile solid object or a mobile plastic hollow servant, you will be made to be happy with your new existence.&quot; Eostre bowed deeply.<br />
<br />
She spoke again in banal monotone, &quot;Also, the rules now explicably state there MUST BE a winner, so again, if the two last contestants zap each other, we don&#39;t just claim all the prizes for ourselves. Thus we have taken precautions to ensue this isn&#39;t the case. If the last two people are zapped at the same time, the person with more zaps will will be spared, if the number of zaps are equal, it&#39;ll go to the younger contestant, if you are somehow the same age down to the last micro-second somehow, it&#39;ll be random.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You may not use violence of any kind against the other contestants, only your zappers. Failure to comply with this rule will receive a warning, then disqualification and your zapper will automatically add to the prize pool for the winner.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then spoke not cheerfully or bored, but deadly serious. &quot;You are free to form teams and alliances, but know that at the end there can be only one winner. But know that betraying people you promised to spare until they were the last or promised to turn into a doll of a certain type and you turned them into a statue instead, will result in a disqualification. We take our promises very seriously here.&quot;<br />
<br />
She added narrowing her eyes. &quot;On a minor note, you will be under contract not to melt down any of your statues for whatever they&#39;re made out of (if you sell the statues, whoever gains them will also be under this contrast, and so on), and your dolls will be hardwired to defend themselves from physical harm, including from you, and you&#39;ll find we&#39;re quiet able to keep tabs on your prizes. We WILL find out if you violate this part of the contract!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, the winner gets a free ticket to anywhere in the world, and a pension for the next ten years.&quot;<br />
<br />
A spotlight shined towards behind you, you and the rest of the crowd turned to see a royal box above the crowd. <br />
<br />
Sitting on a throne was a plastic fox woman, her body shaped to look muscle toned but not muscle bound, she was bright orange with a white chest and long black &#39;gloves&#39; and &#39;socks.&#39; She wore a crown and red royal cape but nothing else.<br />
<br />
&quot;So please ladies and gentlemen, entertain our gamblers, and the viewers across realms. Struggle for the prize of a priceless sapient art gallery, and an entourage of immortal tireless servants who will be loyalty to you above all others and love you unconditionally. Or become part of the prize yourself. I&#39;m certain you will entertain me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eostre rolled her plastic eyes. &quot;And introducing Hera, she is judge, referee, and event mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gaia, the plump plastic white rabbit walked onto stage as well and waved. &quot;Tomorrow at dawn the game begins! So everyone be rested! We have a grand course meal ready and some nice soft beds. You&#39;ll be deposited around the island in random but equal spaces from each other. There is a barrier around the island now that prevents anyone leaving until the game is complete or rendered unfinishable for any reason. I look forward to greeting most of you to your new existence, and may the winner treat his prizes wisely.&quot;</p>
