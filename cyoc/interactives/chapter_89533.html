<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Don felt the touch of his father&#39;s hand on his head, and instantly squatted on his haunches like a good dog, or good dog slave.  He felt something metal thump against his breast plate as he moved. He reached up and discovered a collar and dog tag around his neck. He wanted to go check it out in the mirror, but he had to stay.  Mr. DeSoto- er, his father- had told him to stay.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay, boy. Your master will be here soon. Damn, you&#39;re a fine piece of slave meat.  You look a bit like my own boys. I wonder what I&#39;d get if I sold one of them- probably pay off the mortgage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Don realized that the man petting his head was talking to himself, and that Don shouldn&#39;t reply. So he squatted quietly.<br />
<br />
The doorbell rang. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, that&#39;ll be Matt,&quot; said Paul leading the naked man-dog by his ear on all fours to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Mr. DeSoto, did Donny come over here again?  Sorry, he&#39;s got no sense of direction.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you should keep him tied up.  Slave Control could have picked him up as a stray, and then you&#39;d have to pay a fine. He&#39;s a nice looking stud. Ahem, I was just wondering my boys are almost grown. The oldest is already a free adult, but the other two will be 18 soon.  I don&#39;t have a big estate. It&#39;d probably be best if I enslaved and sold one of them. What do you think I could get for the oldest?&quot; Paul asked.<br />
<br />
Matt was dumbfounded.  He had created a reality in which Don was his dog slave, and Mr. DeSoto didn&#39;t realize it was his own son, and now Mr. DeSoto was talking about selling his other sons.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ever sell a son before?&quot; Matt asked looking down at the naked man whose collar was now attached to the leash in Matt&#39;s hand.  In his other hand, Matt held the wand like a riding crop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, as a matter of fact, I sold a toddler back when my wife was in the hospital with our youngest.  Donny - same name as your dogboy- was five, and the medical bills were so high. It was the logical thing to do. You don&#39;t suppose?&quot; he looked down at Donny for the first time and wonder if it might be his old Donny, and that&#39;s why it kept coming over to the house. It remembered it and Paul from when it was a child. He shook his head, &quot;Nah, what am I thinking. I should call the Slave Traders, and have them assess the boys.  If you&#39;re interested in a companion or mate for Donny, I&#39;ll let you know which of them I decide to sell, and went he- er, it will be for sale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds, good, Mr. D.  Come on, Donny, time to go walkies in the park.&quot;<br />
<br />
Walkies?  In the park?  Naked? Oh, no. This cannot be real.  My dad sold me when I was 5, but I remember. His memories had taken on a dreamlike quality. He knew they were true, but somehow they no longer were. He continued on all fours at his master&#39;s heels. He realized he was no longer naked. At least the parts of him that came in contact with the ground were covered.  He had leather mittens on his hands, and pads on his knees. He suddenly felt something inside his ass and it was getting bigger. As he padded along on all fours, he could feel it hitting his butt cheeks. He peeked over his shoulder and caught glimpses of a tail?  He shook his head, and continued down the sidewalk. Oh, no, it&#39;s Cindy, Don&#39;s girlfriend and that jerk Karl coming toward them. Don lowered his head and hoped they wouldn&#39;t notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, hi, Matt!&quot; cooed Cindy. &quot;Oh, and you have Donny with you!&quot; <br />
<br />
She squatted down and tousled Don&#39;s hair, and lifted his chin. She put her nose inches from his, and said, &quot;Who&#39;s a pretty boy? Donny&#39;s a pretty boy? Yes, he is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, I don&#39;t know how you ever afforded a dog stud like that in this neighborhood.  My kid brother Steve though might sell for a good price. I guess that&#39;s why poor folk have big family&#39;s, you can sell the surplus to make ends meet,&quot; Karl rambled on.  &quot;Hey, Matt, tell me the truth, is Donny here your older brother?  Got in trouble with the law or a lady, and ended up your slave?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Karl, you don&#39;t ask people that question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Donny is no relation to me except as my slave,&quot; then glancing from Donny to the wand that he had gotten from his father, he added, &quot;My dad got him for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe you should get him fixed. He&#39;s popping major wood right in front of my girlfriend,&quot; Karl complained putting a protective arm over Cindy&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s,&quot; Matt almost explained that Cindy used to be Don&#39;s girlfriend, then he decided he&#39;d freak Karl out by telling him that Don was gay, but instead decided, &quot;I got home late today to take Don for his walk, I think he just needs to pee really badly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay, but keep him leashed or get him fixed,&quot; Karl advised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fixed?&quot; Don whispered out loud as he realized what that meant.<br />
<br />
Matt heard him and grinned. He should really punish his dog slave for speaking.  He would if Don did it again without permission. Ah, they were at the park.<br />
<br />
Donny blinked there were a half dozen naked dog-slaves there on leashes. Most seemed to be in the care of servants or professional dog-slave walkers.  A couple were with owners. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know why the only dog park in the city has to be on this side of town?&quot; complained an elderly woman with a young slave clad in a Speedo and matching rubber boots leading a bodybuilder dog slave on all fours toward the gated dog park area. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ma&#39;am. I suspect it&#39;s because it was the only part of town that the neighbors couldn&#39;t complain about it.  Besides it reminds all the neighborhood kids where they will end up if they don&#39;t do right, ma&#39;am,&quot; said he liveried slave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you and Fritz were right bred as slaves, but I get your point.&quot;<br />
<br />
They breed slaves here? Thought Donny and Matt at the same time. Too bad, Donny&#39;s gay, thought Matt waving the wand imperceptibly over Donny&#39;s head.  Donny was hard again. This time he strayed to sniff the other dog slave&#39;s ass and balls.<br />
<br />
The other slave pulled his dog-slave away from Donny and intervened his body between the two. He admonished his dog to heel.<br />
<br />
Matt led Donny on as the slave silently glared at the two of them.<br />
<br />
Donny was freaking out.  He was gay now. He hadn&#39;t been. He had thrown a boner because of Cindy. But now he sniffed his master&#39;s crotch, and was getting even harder. When they reached a tree inside the fenced section of the park, Matt removed the butt plug tail from Donny&#39;s ass. Donny stared in wonder at that thing. He had been aware of it, but it was fucking huge. How had that?  Then Matt undid his collar and ordered him to do his business. Don squatted and did his business by the tree, and then scampered off to play with some of the other dog-slaves. Matt sat on bench and chuckled.</p>
