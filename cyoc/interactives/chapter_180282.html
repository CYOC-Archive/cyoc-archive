<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff woke up the following day feeling very refreshed after having his body controlled by Lisa, the cute, athletic and muscular soccer girl from school. He was so bloated from eating so much cake at first, but Lisa took over his body and made him go through a vigorous work out. Now, he was feeling much better the following morning. He got up, showered and went to school. <br />
<br />
Lisa was also a student at his school, and she eyed him from a distance. During lunch, she played a small pickup soccer game with her teammates where she bumped into one of her friends and she fell to the ground, twisting her ankle by accident. Her friend helped carry her off the field and the school nurse gave her a pair of crutches so she could still get around. It seemed likely that Lisa would miss the next four to six weeks of soccer games because of her injury and that did not sit well with her. <br />
<br />
That afternoon, after school was over, Lisa logged in to her computer and she sent Jeff a chat request. Once Jeff got online and accepted, he saw an image of Lisa on his monitor. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Jeff… Have you heard what happened to me at school today?” she asked him.<br />
<br />
“No? Why? What happened?” he wondered. <br />
<br />
“I fell and I twisted my ankle. I’m on crutches and I’m out for the next four to six weeks!” Lisa said, feeling very disappointed. <br />
<br />
“Oh, man! I’m so sorry, girl! What are you gonna do? So, no soccer for you, huh?” Jeff sighed.<br />
<br />
“Not if I can help it! I’m gonna borrow your body and I’m gonna use you to play anyway!” Lisa responded, feeling determined that she was going to play anyway. <br />
<br />
“But… But… I’m a guy! Won’t the girls find it very awkward when you show up as a guy and start playing looking like me on the girls’ soccer team?” Jeff remarked. <br />
<br />
Lisa looked down at her phone and she loaded the Chronivac app. <br />
<br />
“If the Chronivac can help me swap bodies, then it can also help modify your body as well. I’m gonna change you into a girl!” Lisa grinned, as she began to enter the right settings in the app on her phone. <br />
<br />
“What? Wait! A girl? I don’t wanna be a girl! What kind of girl?” Jeff shouted back.<br />
<br />
“Chill out, Jeff. I’m gonna be using your body, so obviously, I’m gonna have to make you look like… Me! You’re gonna look like my doppelganger! Won’t that be great? You’re gonna look like a cute soccer girl!” Lisa chuckled as she uploaded a picture of her in her full soccer uniform to the Chronivac app. “Every time I take over your body, you’re gonna transform into an exact copy of me!” <br />
<br />
“What? Holy shit!” Jeff exclaimed. <br />
<br />
“Let’s give it a shot, shall we? Once I’m done, you’ll transfer back to your old self. I saved all my physical settings on the Chronivac app, so it will remember what I look like so your transformation will only be temporary!” Lisa explained, as she started the body swap using her app on the phone. Jeff immediately heard the Chronivac device behind him come to life as the emitter took his picture and scanned in his image as a reference. <br />
<br />
“HEY! Lisa! Wait! What are you do--?” Jeff stated loudly as he was overcome by an intense tingling sensation which coursed all over his body. It felt a little familiar, for it was the same feeling he had when Lisa was about to take over his body. This time, however, it was more intense. Something else was changing about him. It was more than just Lisa taking control over his body. He was actually changing!<br />
<br />
Jeff felt his legs become thicker and stronger as they packed on more muscle. He lost a few inches in height, but he made up for it in the added muscles in his legs, with more muscle being packed on to his calves and his quads, which made him look like a soccer player. He now sported solid six-pack abs as well. Other things happened at the same time, however. His hair turned blond and grew much longer, passing shoulder-length. His skin became soft and fair while his face became more feminine. His arms became more thinner, and breasts began to develop on his chest. Lastly, his cock and balls disappeared, leaving him with a vagina! He now looked exactly like Lisa! <br />
<br />
As an added bonus, his jeans morphed into soccer shorts, his black socks morphed into long, thick, white knee-high soccer socks with shin guards, his tennis shoes morphed into the best soccer cleats and his t-shirt transformed into a colorful red-and-blue soccer jersey. Jeff had completely transformed into an exact copy of Lisa, wearing her soccer practice uniform!<br />
<br />
Jeff got up and walked over to the mirror, examining his – or her – new body, when she spoke in Lisa’s own voice.<br />
<br />
“So, how do you like your new look?” she said. <br />
<br />
“I… Uhh… I look like you!” <br />
<br />
“Yes! You’re the new Lisa! You’re gonna be great!” Lisa made her reply.<br />
<br />
Then, in an instant, Jeff disappeared from his bedroom and popped up at the soccer practice field at the high school, where all the girls were excited to see “Lisa” again. Of course, they were happy to see that she was doing much better. Fortunately, it seemed that the “twisted ankle” didn’t seem so bad after all, since “Lisa” seemed to be running just fine. Little did they know that it was Jeff’s body, transformed into a copy of Lisa, controlled by Lisa from a distance thanks to the Chronivac!</p>
