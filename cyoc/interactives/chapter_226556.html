<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cole and Stephanie Farlon couldn&#39;t believe the scientist&#39;s words.  <br />
<br />
&quot;One...one million dollars?&quot;, Stephanie stuttered, as she clutched Cole&#39;s hand. &quot;Are you serious?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely,&quot; said the scientist, a white-haired man named Doctor Stone. They were at an office of some large science company called &#39;Metamorph Inc&#39;, at the address in the ad the family found. &quot;It&#39;s all guaranteed payment. You can get a lawyer to read over the contract if you wish, but I promise, we&#39;re a trusted organisation.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But why do our kids have to get involved?&quot;, Cole asked. &quot;Why not just us?&quot;<br />
<br />
The scientist smiled, &quot;Ah yes. Well, you see, our product focuses especially on families like yours. We&#39;ve noticed how well you connect with each other, and it&#39;ll increase the effectiveness of the treatment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what exactly are you doing here?&quot;, asked Stephanie. &quot;We&#39;ve only heard snippets of information about this &#39;treatment&#39;. Why pay so much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well first off, the experiment won&#39;t be here.&quot; the head scientist explained. &quot;It&#39;ll be hosted in a facility an hour west from the city, where you&#39;ll stay for several weeks. You&#39;ll be given all the comforts of a vacation house; a home away from home even! We can&#39;t divulge too much about the details of the treatment, but rest assured, it&#39;s nothing with lasting side effects. In fact, it may improve your family relationship for the better! As for the payment? Well, once our product is perfected, it will be worth billions! The million you get will be almost nothing compared to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cole looked warily at Stephanie, &quot;So we can refuse at any time?&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stone nodded, &quot;Of course! We&#39;d love for you to participate, but if you decline then that&#39;s that. You&#39;ll still receive some payment based on the amount of days you participated. Certainly not as much as if you complete the full trial, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steph and Cole clutched each other&#39;s hands. They were desperate for money right now; their home burnt down recently due to an electrical shortage, and with it went nearly all their belongings. It couldn&#39;t be at a worse time too, as Cole recently lost his job when the hardware company he worked for decided to go bankrupt. He was earning just decently enough, but now?<br />
<br />
They thought of their children. Abby, their daughter and oldest at 10-years-old, about to head into middle school next year. Danny, their son and youngest at 7, who was so worried of his parents giving them away for adoption. <br />
<br />
One million dollars...maybe it&#39;s not as much as they&#39;re promising, but their kids needed a chance. Hell, with the payment offered, the Farlons could even save up for their college funds.<br />
<br />
The couple nodded at each other, and squeezed hands firmly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; said Stephanie. &quot;But...we want to ask our children first.&quot;<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Abby stared out the car window, as the family drove through a small road in the countryside. Pastures dotted with livestock stretched on endlessly, along with patches of forest. The sky was wide open, dotted by grey clouds and sunlight.<br />
<br />
Next to her was Danny, fast asleep with his handheld gaming Switch still in his hand. Her father was driving while her mother sat next to him, with a nervous face.<br />
<br />
Abby spoke, &quot;Mommy? How long more until we arrive?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mom smiled kindly, &quot;Not long sweetie, don&#39;t worry!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her parents told both her and Danny all about this strange &#39;test&#39; they were participating in. Apparently they wouldn&#39;t be gone from home for long; around a month or so, and that it&#39;ll be just like a vacation. If everything turned out right, the family would get enough money for a new house.<br />
<br />
Abby didn&#39;t know what the experiments entailed. Her parents tried explaining to her about medical stuff, which Abby half understood, and some other things like psychological studies. When she asked about that word, her mother giggled and patted her daughter&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Abby. We&#39;re in good hands.&quot;, she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll probably grow extra hands after this,&quot; joked her father. &quot;But yeah. We&#39;ll all be fine. From what we checked, this company had other volunteers, and they&#39;ve said good things about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The car pulled up into a long gravel path, as they approached line of tall trees and bushes, with a chain-link fence half-hidden behind. The path led to a metal gate, with a small guardpost. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, daddy?&quot;, piped Danny, who had woken up, and was still groggy. &quot;Are we in a military base?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It does seems like it, yeah,&quot;, said their dad. He grinned. As they drove closer, they could see a small sign at the front of the guardpost: a logo for a company called Metamorph Inc.<br />
<br />
A uniformed guard exited the booth, and approached the car, faces stern. One tapped dad&#39;s window, and rolled it down.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re here for the experiment?&quot;, said Abby&#39;s father, as her mother handed him a folder with documents. The guard looked it over before speaking on the radio. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, they&#39;re here. I&#39;ll let them through.&quot; He waved the family in, as the gate opened. &quot;Welcome to Metamorph Farmlabs!&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Farmlabs?&#39;, Abby wondered, as they drove in through. It did seem like a kind of farm, with large shed buildings, and a big wooden farmhouse. Though there&#39;s no animals in sight, just people in white labcoats and uniforms walking around. A guard guided the car to a place where Abby&#39;s father could park. <br />
<br />
As the family got out, one of these lab-coated men (with a tie decorated with sexy women) hurried over, with a wide grin in the middle of his stubby grey beard. Following behind him was another scientist: a tall, stern-looking woman who reminded Abby of a sinister fairytale witch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, the Farlon family! You&#39;re right on time!&quot;, said the man, as he shook the hands of Abby&#39;s father. &quot;Mister and Mrs. Farlon, welcome to the Metamorph Farm facility! I&#39;m Doctor Adam, I&#39;ll be helping take care of you these next few weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to hear that!&quot;, said Abby&#39;s father, as the scientist shook her mother&#39;s hand as well.  <br />
<br />
&quot;And these must be your kids!&quot;, said Dr. Adam. &quot;What&#39;s your name, sweetie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Abby.&quot; Abby replied shyly, as she let the doctor take her small, jittery hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m Danny!&quot; said her little brother. His voice seemed cheerful, but Abby knew that he&#39;s hiding his nerves just like her. Dr. Adam shook his hand, as the scary lady doctor approached. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, right. I&#39;d like you all to meet the head supervisor of the FarmLab, Doctor Emma Eberhardt. She runs everything that happens in this place.&quot; said Dr Adam, as he stepped out of the way. The woman, who looked a little more wrinkly up-close, put on a wide, polite smile. Abby and Danny had to tilt their heads up to meet her dark-grey eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is a pleasure, Farlons,&quot; said the Doctor, in a light German accent. &quot;You may refer to me as Dr. Eberhardt during your stay here. We shall make sure your stay here is as comfortable as possible, and productive to us as well. Now, let&#39;s not waste time. Follow us, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby held Danny&#39;s hand nervously, as they trailed after their parents and the doctors, carrying whatever little luggage they had with them.<br />
<br />
Passing by various of the Farmlab&#39;s staff, they entered a large, blocky building that looked like a big farm-shed. Though when they stepped inside, it was a pristine white hall more fitting for the inside of a hospital.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will be staying in this habitat for the duration of your 8 weeks of stay,&quot; said Dr Eberhardt. &quot;We have built the inside resemble a normal house, though please note that it will be monitored by video surveillance. I assure you, we will only look when necessary. Some parts of your experience will be conducted privately, where only yourself and your family members will take part of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please check in at the counter there, and give our nurse Mary all your current possessions, such as phones and jewellery.&quot;, instructed Dr Adam. &quot;They will keep your belongings safe during the experiment. Afterwards, we&#39;ll show you around the facilities and your room!&quot;<br />
<br />
After things got sorted, the family was led through a small quarantine room, before entering into what looked like the living room of a normal house. There was a couch with a TV, an exercise treadmill, and a kitchen area with a dining table. There was also a small hall with three other doors; one of them open to a bathroom with a tub and a shower.<br />
Nearby is a glass door leading to a large, grassy outdoor lawn surrounded by tall walls, with a &#39;ceiling&#39; made of transparent plastic mesh. There was a picnic table, and a small, plastic playground structure with a slide, along with a wooden see-saw. <br />
<br />
&quot;All meals and snacks will be brought to you through a service hatch here,&quot; said Dr Eberhardt, pointing to a panel on the wall. &quot;There is also a phone hooked up by this landline, where you may call the reception if anything comes up. You&#39;ll have two bedrooms: one with a shared bed, and one with two separate ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby&#39;s parents took this as a sign to pick which room to stay in. Abby guessed her parents wanted to sleep together, and Abby gets a bed all for herself. Meanwhile Danny would be stuck alone, sleeping between the adults.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your participation here will last around 8 weeks, depending on circumstances. Your meals will consist mostly of fresh vegetables and fruits grown in our greenhouse and gardens, as well as chicken and pork raised in our own farm.&quot;, said Dr Eberhardt. &quot;To monitor your condition throughout, our scientists will ask questions, and take scans of you using our equipment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll, uh, also have plenty of entertainment!&quot;, added Dr Adam. &quot;Unfortunately, you won&#39;t have any internet during your stay here. However, your TV has cable, streaming and Youtube access, and you can let our staff know if you&#39;re interested in anything specific that isn&#39;t available. Also, there&#39;s toys, board games AND video games here in these shelves, along with a collection of books over there. We also have balls, rackets and some dum-bells for exercise! But, uh, it&#39;s best if you don&#39;t play with the balls indoors.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby noted to her parents&#39; smiles, and Danny&#39;s excited noises (&quot;Video games?!&quot;) before remembering where she was. This wasn&#39;t a real house they were staying in. And yet, it looks like a perfectly nice summer camp vacation house. Abby smiled too. It did all seem nice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cleaning and bed-keeping shall be done ever two days,&quot; said Eberhardt. &quot;Though you will need to stay in the outdoor lawn during the duration. Should you need any special assistance, you can use the wall phone, or the intercom near the door. Any questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
Neither of Abby&#39;s parents had anything to ask. Nor her or Danny. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent. Now, Dr. Adam will take you one at a time, for a physical examination before you begin your stay. Not to worry, it is not the start of the experiment. But you will have to take a small blood sample.&quot;<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
The family was taken to a large doctor&#39;s office, in the same building as the family&#39;s new temporary home. They were each sent in one-at-a-time, with Abby going in first. <br />
<br />
Stripping to her panties, Abby sat on the medical bed, while Dr Adam gave her a basic checkup; blood pressure, heart rate, height, weight. It seemed normal at first, but then Dr Alan came out with a small plastic bag, and a needle attached to a tube. And Abby&#39;s heart raced with fear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now don&#39;t worry. This looks scary, but we&#39;re going to put this cream on you so you won&#39;t feel a thing,&quot; said Dr Adam, as he rubbed a gloved hand on Abby&#39;s arm; covering it with salve. &quot;It&#39;s something we invented. You won&#39;t feel a thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby cringed as she expected a needle prick to come next. But, to her surprise, she didn&#39;t feel a thing. Not even a slightest bit of pain, as the doctor drew out some of her blood, or even when the needle came out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice, huh? Yeah, you&#39;ll be seeing doctors use that everywhere in a few years,&quot; said Dr Adam, as he put the blood bag aside. &quot;We&#39;re making some cool discoveries here, and your family&#39;s going to help us make them! Sounds cool, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby nodded timidly. What were they experimenting on here? Was it really okay?<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, we&#39;re going to need to take your pictures over here. You&#39;ll have to take the rest of clothes off, though,&quot; said Dr. Adam. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll pull this curtain so you&#39;ll have your privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Abby did. As instructed, Abby stood shyly for a scientific-looking camera in her nakedness, and rotated at Dr Adam&#39;s command. She felt embarrassed, knowing that pictures of her unclothed body will be stored somewhere. <br />
She guessed it was for the experiment. <br />
<br />
But why would they need pictures of their bodies? Was something going to happen to them?<br />
<br />
Shortly after, Abby returned to their &#39;holiday home&#39;. After Danny was sent in and returned (rubbing his arm unsurely), their mother went out next, while Cole had to take a moment in the bathroom. The children were left alone on the couch, as they watched a cartoon channel on the TV. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...how are you feeling, Danny?&quot;, Abby asked.<br />
<br />
Danny shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m ok.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abby could tell he had a lot of fears, and was just trying to keep it in for their parents sake. They both still remembered the fire that burned down their whole house, along with most of everything their owned. Abby remembered Danny worriedly asking their mother if they&#39;ll be sent to an orphanage. <br />
<br />
Will this &#39;experiment&#39; really fix everything? Whatever happens, it does seem she had to stay strong, for both her parents and Danny. <br />
<br />
Comfortingly, Abby scooted next to her little brother. And for a while, the siblings just sat together, watching cartoon in silence. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. Do you wanna play Mario Kart?&quot;, Danny, said suddenly. <br />
<br />
Abby smiled. Apparently, Dr Alan was nice enough to let Danny have his Switch back for their stay. He did seem nice...even if Abby was still nervous of things. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot;<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Dr Eberheardt watched from the viewscreen, as the Farlon family gathered in the living room. She was in a central observation room, right on the other side of the wall of the Farlon family&#39;s &#39;habitat&#39;. There were a few scientists there, monitoring readings and equipment. Right beside her was Dr Adam, who was scribbling notes as he watched the family.<br />
<br />
The medical exams were done, and the Farlons were now staying in their habitat proper. The parents were now watching their kids having fun with their video games, as if it was just an ordinary holiday. <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like they&#39;re settling nicely,&quot; said Dr Adam. &quot;I think they trust us enough.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Only because they need to,&quot; answered Dr Eberheardt flatly. Around her, there were computer viewscreens of various camera shots of the subjects&#39; habitat, including the bathroom, bedrooms and outdoor lawn. All of them were from well-hidden pin-cameras, leaving as few blindspots to the habitat as possible. <br />
<br />
Dr Eberheardt turned towards a different computer monitor, with photos of each family member from Dr. Adam&#39;s examination. Despite herself, the female doctor&#39;s mouth curled as she looked through each image of the family. <br />
The Farlons were of average build for their ages. Brown-blondish hair with caucasian skin. The parents had hazel eyes, while the son had blue, and the daughter had green.<br />
<br />
Eberheardt looked at the parents&#39;. The mother, Stephanie, was no bombshell beauty, but still fair for a 38-year-old, with C cup breasts, a sharp nose, shoulder-length hair, and clean shaven privates. The father, Cole, on the other hand, worked out enough to have slightly defined pecks, and some muscle in the arms. He had stubble on his chin, short hair, and a bush of hair around his 5-inch penis. <br />
<br />
She looked over the children. The son, Danny, had cherub-like curly hair and a button nose, and still some baby fat. His genitals were as expected for a boy his age. Though of course, things may change. <br />
<br />
And there was the daughter, Abby, with a nose somewhat pointed like her mother&#39;s, and lightly freckled cheeks. The girl&#39;s wavy, long hair went past her shoulders. Her chest was flat, with breasts still waiting some years before flowering, and her vagina was an adorable hairless peach between her legs. It brought some sweet memories back to Eberheardt...<br />
<br />
&quot;Doc?&quot;, asked Dr. Adam. &quot;Got a text from the kitchen. The food&#39;s almost ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have them prepare some extra desserts, for their first day.&quot; said Dr. Eberheardt. &quot;We still have the cakes, yes?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, got it.&quot; <br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Cake!&quot;</i>, exclaimed Danny, as dinner arrived. Along with a fruit salad and a spaghetti platter, there was also chocolate cake; fluffy and moist with rich frosting.<br />
<br />
The family dug in as they ate at the dinner table. Abby looked wearily at her food, though, wondering if the scientists had put anything inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Abby,&quot; said her dad. &quot;They promised they won&#39;t mess with the food unless we say so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother nodded. &quot;I agree. If they&#39;re serious about paying us so much, I don&#39;t think they&#39;d pull any nasty surprises on us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny laughed, &quot;Like those drugs that spies take, Mommy?&quot;, as he dug into his spaghetti.<br />
<br />
Both adults chuckled nervously, as they continued their meal. Abby took a careful bite, then downed it with a gulp of water. <br />
<br />
Once the Farlons finished, the family put their dishes and leftovers into the hatch, where a worker could take their stuff away. Afterwards, everyone settled in the living room, as Abby&#39;s mother picked out a movie to watch. As a Spielberg movie played on TV, Abby lied down across her parents&#39; laps as she snuggled against them, feeling safe.<br />
 <br />
---------<br />
<br />
Dr Eberheardt kept watch, as the family turned the lights out, and said their goodnights. Just as expected, the parents have elected the room with the queen-sized bed, while the children shared the room with the twin-beds. Also expected was the family all taking a shower and bath.<br />
<br />
Dr. Eberheardt and her scientists had planned it all out. The Farlons would have expected some kind of abnormal substance to enter their bodies, and a delicious first-day meal would seem too obvious. Thus, it was a perfect distraction away from the real source of the substance: their tap water and bathwater. <br />
<br />
&quot;How are their conditions?&quot;, Eberheardt asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;All normal,&quot; replied a female colleague. &quot;No changes. Their heartbeats are calming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eberheardt nodded. That&#39;s good. No accidental remote triggering as of yet. <br />
<br />
It was a special nanite compound, mixed with a chemical invented by Metamorph Labs. Eberheardt&#39;s superiors decided on the name &#39;Merlin-5&#39;, though she preferred something more elegant. She supposed it was good code name. <br />
<br />
Merlin-5&#39;s main function was to reconstruct someone&#39;s biology according to certain parameters. Once inside a mammal&#39;s body, be it ingested, swallowed, or injected, it allowed for the reprogramming of cells, and changing of the entire subject&#39;s physiology; even their sex. It even enabled control of the subject&#39;s behavior and mental state, mostly through changing the hormones and chemicals made by a person&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
It was like magic. Once Metamorph Inc. has perfected and refined the compound to its best form, &#39;Merlin-5&#39; will change humanity&#39;s identity forever. Entire fields of science, medicine and entertainment, will open up, with Metamorph (and Dr Eberheardt) leading the way. This could even be a step towards human immortality.<br />
But before such a thing can be shown to the world, it must be tested to its limits. And with a wide range of test subjects. <br />
<br />
The minutes passed. The house remained dark, and the scientists in the observation room kept monitoring the family&#39;s readings, thanks to both sensors and the nanites (which were linked to the scientists&#39; equipment by special signals)<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re all entering REM sleep,&quot; replied Dr. Adam <br />
<br />
Eberheardt gave a silent, but devious smile. &quot;Activate the Merlin-5.&quot;<br />
<br />
And Dr. Adam did. There were no obvious effects yet. In fact, the changes may vary in effect from the first days. Some unnoticable, and some incredibly drastic. Some may happen overnight, and some will happen to them right as they&#39;re going about their day. <br />
<br />
Yes. The Farlons will help change the world. And they&#39;ll do so by changing themselves...</p>
