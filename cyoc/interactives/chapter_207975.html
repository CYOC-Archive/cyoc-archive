<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been over a month since Jason accepted Andrew’s offer of living with him in his flat, and his life had grown a lot less dramatic in the process. During the days, Jason would spend his time fulfilling his part of the deal by keeping the flat clean and tidy. He was starting to wonder if there was something more to the natural obedience of his small-dick biology. Jason was efficient in his work, cleaning the kitchen one day, the bathrooms the next, and so on, building a rotating schedule so the work didn’t overwhelm him or take up too much of his time. He also did both of their laundry, noting that he would subconsciously choose to complete Andrew’s laundry first before starting his own. He worked quickly, and so he would often have a good amount of free time in the afternoons. Around four o’clock, he would put a pause on whatever he was doing and start getting dinner prepared; Andrew usually came home around six in the evening. From there on and until he left for work in the morning, Jason’s time, and ass, belonged to him. For the first day or so, Andrew had treated Jason like a regular roommate, more or less. Jason only had to “suffer” some light teasing for his diminished cocklet, but when they would have sex, Andrew’s large-dick nature would come out in full, fucking Jason’s ass ruthlessly all the while degrading him and keeping his hands pinned away from his aching cocklet. Andrew confessed to him once that he felt a little guilty, but Jason didn’t mind; in fact, he was starting to get used to it, even starting to love it. He confessed as much and Andrew’s guilt was quickly assuaged and the teasing and dominating started to creep outside of the bedroom. Jason quickly found himself ordered not to wear clothes in the apartment, or at least, not when other large-dicks were present, and Andrew began to enjoy making Jason beg for his meal from his gargantuan cock before relenting and forcing it down the small-dick’s eager throat. <br />
<br />
Larry didn’t bother them very much. He hadn’t been happy when Jason gave him the news that he was moving out of his apartment and into Andrew’s. Jason had been terrified in the moment; his small-dick instincts had been castigating him for standing up to a superior large-dick, but having Andrew standing behind him, his big hand on Jason’s shoulder and his firm bulge pressing against his backside that encouraged him. He was thankful Andrew had a larger dick than Larry, or the asshole probably would have tried to raise their rent. He’d balked when Andrew reminded him that he was Jason’s feeder, and to leave Jason alone, but the grizzled large-dick had only grumbled in defeat and acknowledgement. Jason only hoped they wouldn’t have to call him for maintenance anytime soon.<br />
<br />
It was a Friday afternoon, but still early, and Jason was perched on the couch reading a book on small-dicked civil rights. He was surprised so little progress had been made over so many years but considering the reality he came from he supposed that was par for the course. He was naked of course; he was allowed to wear clothes when Andrew was out but he preferred to stay naked in case the man surprised him by coming home early. Jason had completed his tasks for the day and was trying to ignore the hunger pangs that had started coming over him late this morning. Andrew had fed him two generous loads this morning before stepping out for work, but Jason had noticed his appetite had grown over the last few weeks. He was about to text Andrew and ask him if he was coming home for his lunch break, when his head started to buzz as the familiar wave of change hit him.<br />
<br />
“That son of a bitch,” Jason muttered through clenched teeth as he clutched his head. As soon as it had began, the sensation was over. A moment later, his phone buzzed, signaling a text message from Andrew<br />
<br />
Jason pulled up his phone and paused when he noticed the name entered over Andrew’s phone number; it read “Your King” instead of Andrew’s first and last name like he normally did for all his contacts. He ignored it and read Andrew’s message.<br />
<br />
“Hey, short-dick. Did you notice that last wave of change, or were you too busy plucking your measly little cocklet to notice?” it read. Andrew liked to tease Jason as much as the next large-dick, but this was a little more direct than what he’d grown used too. And stranger still, Jason felt compelled to defend himself. His cocklet was erect as he replied to Andrew’s message.<br />
<br />
“I noticed it, Sir, but I promise I wasn’t touching myself, just like you asked.” Jason replied.<br />
<br />
Another moment later and Andrew had responded. “Good, then you know that I own you now.” Jason blinked as those words sank in; the man was right, he realized as his cocklet strained harder. In this reality, Larry had moved Jason into the apartment complex a few years ago after buying the rights to Jason from Jason’s father. Because Andrew was far larger than Larry, he had been able to contest Larry’s ownership and had bought him out. Jason thus was legally in the custody of Andrew, as was the law for all small-dicks like him. “You should also know that because I have the largest cock of any man on my team, I got a promotion.” A second message read, followed by, “So you better be ready for me when I get home, limp-clit. I’ll still help you find that book, but I ain’t arguing with the changes so far.”<br />
<br />
Jason texted back, “Thank you, Sir.” Then a groaning from his stomach reminded of him of his growing hunger. “Sir, are you able to come home for lunch today?”<br />
<br />
A painstaking ten minutes passed, during which Jason kept checking his phone as Andrew no doubt was aware of why he was asking, and was letting him grow more and more desperate, just the way he liked. <br />
<br />
Andrew finally responded, “I fed you twice this morning and you’re already hungry again, you slut?” Jason moaned at the implication. <br />
<br />
“Please, Daddy, “ he typed. “I’m starving, I’ll make it so good for you, I swear. I just need to see your beautiful cock and feel it in my mouth. I can’t go another minute without it!” Jason hoped that stroking Andrew’s ego would encourage the large-dick to relent.<br />
<br />
“I love it when you beg for what you need, boy,” Andrew’s next message read, “But I’m a busy man, and I can’t leave work right now.” Jason was left to stew in disappointment for a brief minute before Andrew followed up with another message. “But, tell you what, little guy. I have this intern who’s been busting his big balls around here to get his work done, and he could use a little bonus for his efforts. He’s not as big or as full as me, of course, but make him feel like the Real Man that he is.” <br />
<br />
Jason’s heart leapt and his cocklet began to leak as he read the message. “Thank you, Sir!” he sent the message. He was about to send more when another message came from Andrew.<br />
<br />
“Stop wasting time, short-dick. Unlock the front door, get on your knees, and wait for my intern to arrive. Don’t keep him too long; he’s still got a lot of work to do.” Jason did as he was told, tossing his phone onto the couch and getting up to unlock the front door. He then dropped to both his knees, his hands resting on his thighs and his tiny cocklet hard and leaking, only barely visible from beneath his pubic hair. A minute went by, then five minutes, and then fifteen, and Jason began to wonder how much longer he would have to wait. He’s knees were starting to hurt, but his small-dick hormones were making him determined not to disappoint Andrew or the man who was coming to feed him. Like Andrew had said, the Man had been working hard, and hard working men deserved a moment to relax and relieve their big, aching cocks on eager small-dicks like him. <br />
<br />
Jason jumped from his reverie as he heard a knock at the front door…</p>
