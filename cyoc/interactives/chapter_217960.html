<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mel stumbled across the lobby and through the door to the office. She had to hold herself up on the furniture as she passed through into the employee break room. Her knees gave out when she tried to open the door and she tumbled through, landing in an undignified heap on the carpet. She dragged herself over to a chair and pulled herself upright for a brief moment before sitting heavily in the plastic seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god.&quot; she breathed, &quot;That was so HOT.&quot;<br />
<br />
She wiggled her hips against the hard surface of the chair, grinding her plug deeper into her ass. She&#39;d been waiting for years to get a taste of Heather. She licked her lips, savoring the salty flavor. She hadn&#39;t expected to be caught by her mom like that. Usually when Gabby said she needed to do paperwork in the office it meant she would be in there for most of the day. Mel had a sneaking suspicion that there hadn&#39;t been any paperwork and her mother had set her up. Not that Mel cared. She&#39;d finally gotten what she wanted.<br />
<br />
Mel flipped up the hem of her apron and looked down at herself. She was a mess, and the chair was growing a small puddle. She wished she had grabbed a toy on her way out. She reached down and rubbed her clit lightly with her finger tips. She was starting to get into it when she heard a polite cough from the doorway. She hastily pulled the apron back down and looked furtively at Gabby standing in the doorway with her arms crossed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And just what are you doing back here?&quot; Gabby asked quietly.<br />
<br />
Mel blushed and smoothed the apron down some more.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you were going to give me some privacy.&quot; she said, glaring at her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never said I was. Are you going to tell me what that was all about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was taking care of Heather. Like I&#39;m supposed to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could see that, but isn&#39;t this,&quot; she indicated Mel&#39;s current outfit, &quot;Going a bit too far? It&#39;s one thing to play with your charge, but you seem to want more out of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel couldn&#39;t meet her mother&#39;s eyes. She fidgeted in the chair some more, but that just made her predicament worse. She wished she had never put the plug in that morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are your intentions with Heather?&quot; Gabby asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I- I love her.&quot; Mel almost whispered, tears building in her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;As her nanny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Mel stood up, her legs shook with the effort. &quot;I love her. Truly love her. Capital L love her!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabby looked taken aback. Her scrawny teen daughter, so thin that you could wrap your hand entirely around her bicep, was staring defiantly into her eyes and declaring her love for her best friend and sometime dependent. <br />
<br />
&quot;I understand.&quot; she said quietly. &quot;You and Heather have been together almost your entire lives. I should have seen this coming. You have my blessing. Just be careful. Try a bit harder to get some privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W- what?&quot; Mel stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;If being together with Heather is what makes you happy then I will not come between you. I just ask that you be discreet and safe. Not everyone is accepting of this sort of thing. I don&#39;t want to see you get hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel just stared incredulously. Gabby grabbed her by her bony shoulders and pulled her in for a hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you sweetie.&quot; Gabby whispered.<br />
<br />
She pushed Mel back out to arms length but didn&#39;t let go. She looked right into her daughter&#39;s eyes with a serious expression on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now then. I didn&#39;t have much paperwork to do here, but I do have plenty of things to get done back at home. I am going to trust you and Heather and leave the both of you here. I&#39;ll lock the door behind me and set the alarm so when you&#39;re ready to go home you&#39;ll need to call me. I won&#39;t ask what you plan on doing while I&#39;m gone, I&#39;ve seen enough to make an educated guess, but I expect you to not do anything stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabby let go of her daughter&#39;s shoulders and walked back toward the office. She turned in the doorway and gave Mel one last serious look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember to clean up after yourselves. And be safe!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabby blew her daughter a kiss and left. Mel heard her footsteps make their way towards the front door, then heard the door, close, and lock. Mel sighed. That was an encounter she had not been expecting quite yet. Her mother was right, she needed to be more careful. She also needed to take care of herself before dealing with anything else. Heather would be asleep right now. After an orgasm that big she would have no choice. Mel had about an hour or two before she woke up. She thought of all the toys in the daycare that she could use to relieve herself while she waited. The rocking horse seemed like a good idea, The big baby girls all loved it when they got a ride, but Mel&#39;s legs protested against this. No, she needed something that took little or no effort.<br />
<br />
She looked around the room for inspiration, but it was pretty bare. The staff usually came in here to rest a bit and eat lunch, not play. She glanced through the still open door to the office and something caught her eye. In the corner of the office, behind the desk, was a toy that had been donated by one of the mothers. She had said that her daughter always had so much fun with it so she got one for the daycare too. Gabby had decided that it was a bit much for everyday use, so she only brought it out for special occasions like birthdays. Mel hobbled over to it and grinned. This would work perfectly. She grabbed it by the handle and wheeled it out of the office and towards the playroom.<br />
<br />
It only took a minute to set it up. Mel placed it right in front of the crib that Heather was napping in and plugged it in. It looked like one of those round seats for babies that aren&#39;t quite able to sit up on their own, but it had a cut-out in the middle and had been placed on a sort of short pedestal. Within the cut-out was a rather large and knobbly dildo on a piston. Mel had only seen it used a couple of times, and she had never had the guts to try it herself. Until now.<br />
<br />
Mel took off her borrowed apron and hung it back up with the others. Then she sat in the seat. She was surprised at how wide it forced her to spread her legs. Anyone sitting directly in front would get quite a show. She got herself situated as best she could and picked up the remote. She gave the settings a once-over, adjusted a few of them, then pressed the on button. The machine whirred to life and a moment later Mel felt something hard pressing against her crotch. She adjusted her hips a bit and the hard object began sliding into her waiting cunt. Mel had turned the speed all the way down so it took a minute for its entire length to penetrate her. When it finally bottomed out Mel was breathing hard and could barely focus both eyes on the remote. With shaky fingers she managed to press the start button.</p>
