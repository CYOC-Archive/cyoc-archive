<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff scrolled through the options, looking for something interesting. He saw all kinds of transformations, body, age, gender, size, mind... species.<br />
Jeff smiled, he had always wanted a dog, but his dad, John, had allergies. Maybe with the Chronivac, he get rid of his dad&#39;s allergies, or maybe his dad...<br />
No. He couldn&#39;t just turn his dad into a dog, but there weren&#39;t any other subjects Jeff could change. Then Jeff had an idea.<br />
Jeff typed and clicked as he set up the changes. He could have his dad be a dog when he wanted a dog, but have his dad turn back into himself for the rest of the time.<br />
Jeff looked over the settings to make sure everything was in order.<br />
<br />
John would transform if Jeff said &#39;Doggone&#39;, and and would change back if Jeff said &#39;come back dad.&#39;<br />
During his time as a dog, he would also be loyal, loving, obedient, trained, and house broken. Jeff left him unfixed, since this was still his dad. After transforming back, His memories as a dog would be suppressed until he turned into a dog again. <br />
Jeff quickly removed His dad&#39;s allergies and hit confirm. He went downstairs to see if it worked.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad was hanging up the phone as Jeff walked in.<br />
&quot;Hey son.&quot; said John as he turned to Jeff. &quot;I only got pepperoni, I hope you don&#39;t mind.&quot; Jeff smiled.<br />
&quot;Doggone it, I wanted hawaiian, but that&#39;s fine.&quot; Jeff and his dad sat down on the couch to watch the pregame while they waited for the pizza. Jeff stole glances at his dad as he waited for the changes to begin. Jeff didn&#39;t notice anything at first, but he soon saw thick five&#39;o&#39;clock shadow and pointed ears.<br />
His dad scratched his chin absentmindedly as the shadow spread down his neck and under his shirt. His nails had grown sharper and darkened.<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; exclaimed John. the outburst gave Jeff a chance to see his growing canines. &quot;Keeph goin&#39;! Thath&#39;s the wooay!&quot; Jeff smiled at his dad&#39;s slurred speech.<br />
John went to the kitchen as the game went to a commercial. He stumbled slightly as he walked. Jeff watched him as he walked on the balls of his lengthening feet.<br />
John came back in with a glass of water, his clawed toes clicking on the floor. He sat down as the commercials ended. Jeff held back a laugh as his dad stratched his ear with his foot, before lapping the water up with his tongue. he began panting as he tugged at his shirt collar.<br />
&quot;Ith i&#39; hoth in herrrre, orrr ith i&#39; juth me?&quot; Jeff was surprised as his father stripped down to his boxers; as brown fur raced down his legs. Fur had covered his body, with the exception his hands and head. His hands wouldn&#39;t last long.<br />
His hands popped as He slobbered down the rest of his drink; the cup slipped from his changing hand as he put it on the coffee table. His fingers became stiff, shortening while his fingertips and palms swelled with padding.<br />
His ribcage pushed out and his waist shrank. More popping noises could be heard as his body adjusted to quadrupedal motion. John leaned forward as his arms and legs shortened; with a final pop, his body slipped into the sitting position of a dog.<br />
&quot;Aftherrr wee eet,&quot; growled John as he turned to Jeff; &quot;doo yoo wanna go too thuh parrrk?&quot; A bushy, brown tail slipped out above John&#39;s boxers as it wagged gently.<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; said Jeff; John barked excitedly and wagged his tail. His ears grew larger as brown fuzz engulfed them.<br />
The door bell signaled the arrival of the pizza.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll geth ith.&quot; said John.<br />
&quot;No no, I got it. Stay here.&quot; replied Jeff. He couldn&#39;t let anyone see a human headed dog.<br />
John smiled happily as Jeff left the room. He loved Jeff, Jeff was his boy, but he couldn&#39;t help feeling like something was wrong. He scratched his ear as thought.<br />
&quot;Muth brrrreee my urmaginathun...&quot;<br />
Jeff returned with the pizza, and got two plates out. John got off the couch and walked over. He grabbed the plate with his mouth and walked back to the living room. He placed the plate on the rug and began gulping the food down.<br />
While they ate Jeff saw his dad&#39;s face pushing out slightly as he scarfed his food.<br />
Jeff&#39;s dad swallowed the last morsel before lapping the grease up with his lengthening tongue. He licked his lips in satisfaction, as fur began to claim his last human feature: his face.<br />
&quot;Leth&#39;s gooo! Wanna rrrun, wanna chathe thtikk!&quot; He barked as fur crept over his face. &quot;Wanna play! waannaa phtlay! woooawna prrraaay! rrrooooaarrrooo ROOF!&quot;<br />
<br />
Colors became muted as the dog barked happily and he ran to his boy. Jeff pulled his dad&#39;s boxers off of his new dog as he looked him over.<br />
The dog had short, brown hair and green eyes like his father had. Jeff looked at his new companion.<br />
&quot;Guess you should have gotten me a dog. Right John?&quot; The dog barked in response. He didn&#39;t understand most of what his master said, but he heard his name so it was fine. He loved his boy, his boy took care of him.<br />
Jeff made a leash and collar with the Chronivac, and took John to the park. They played fetch, wrestled, and ran.<br />
&quot;Chase stick! Get stick for boy! Chase boy! Play with boy!&quot; John played with his boy happily. He vaguely remembered that Jeff was his son, but that didn&#39;t seem to matter. An arousing smell distracted him.<br />
Jeff laughed as his dad marked trees and sniffed other dogs. John sniffed the air and darted into the bushes. Jeff ran after him and gasped as John mounted a stray dog from the neighborhood.<br />
&quot;W-wait a sec!&quot; said Jeff. John entered the female and pounded away as instincts controlled him.<br />
&quot;Must fuck bitch! This feels wrong...Mating good! But I...must mate! Fuck! Mate! Fuck! Mate! FUCK!!!&quot; John blew his load and waited for his member to deflate.<br />
After releasing, Jeff took John home before he mated again.<br />
&quot;Maybe I should have made you fixed...&quot; said Jeff. John whimpered softly.<br />
They got back before the big game started and Jeff cleaned up his dad&#39;s clothes. He sat down on the couch and gave his friend a scratch behind his ears.<br />
&quot;This was fun boy, but It&#39;s time to change back.&quot;<br />
Jeff got up and took John to the master bedroom. Jeff closed the door as he said &quot;Come back dad.&quot;<br />
A few moments later, Jeff&#39;s dad walked out into the living room, fully restored.<br />
&quot;So what I miss?&quot; He asked.<br />
&quot;Not too much.&quot; replied Jeff.<br />
<br />
After the game, Jeff went back to his room. He had enjoyed playing with his dad, and wondered what other changes he could program into his father.<br />
Jeff pulled up the program and began thinking...</p>
