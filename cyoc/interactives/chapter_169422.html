<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You just can&#39;t wait to find out who&#39;s pussy you&#39;ve become, but you don&#39;t want to give her a heart attack either. Starting off your new relationship by teasing her is probably not conducive for a good long term relation. You decide to wait it out until she drops her underwear. That way you&#39;ll know who she is and decide the best approach then. <br />
<br />
You feel her legs moving around you. You can feel every footfall thumb through her legs. It&#39;s even more detailed than you could ever imagine. Then she sat down, you feel squished between her legs and the seat. What could she be doing? You have no idea what time it is, or how much time past before they merged you. It was late morning when you were at the office, but here, in her underwear you had no sense of time. Waiting was taking so long, but slowly you become aware of a new sensation. It feels oddly familiar, but different. Like you had your mouth full of water and it was slowly becoming more. <br />
&quot;Oh&quot; you realize she will have to go to the toilet soon. Your chance will soon come.<br />
<br />
You listen closely. She&#39;s talking to people. You feel her voice almost better than you can hear it, but everything is too muffled. Other than a few random words you can&#39;t make heads or tails of what&#39;s being said. The voice however is familiar. You go through the list of names you&#39;ve given and cross a few off already. A few of the muffled voices replying your new owners muffled voice also sounded familiar. You&#39;re probably at work, maybe you&#39;ve become part of the cute blonde colleague with the glasses. You always liked Angela, but any attempt at getting closer never seemed to get anywhere. You were sure you heard her voice at some point though.<br />
But you also heard heard that hot brown Stephanie, you weren&#39;t normally attracted to that skin color. But she was super hot and more importantly, super nice and seemed open minded. So you&#39;d added her to your list as well.<br />
Anya also crossed your mind, your workplace was surprisingly multi cultural. You always had a thing for Asian and her sharp features and smooth black hair was always alluring. You never seemed to be able to talk much with her though.<br />
There was also Kate, but you feel like if you were with her you would&#39;ve noticed. She wasn&#39;t nearly as hot as the others, she was actually a bit chubby. No, let&#39;s just call it what it was, she was fat with a fat ass and thick thighs. You&#39;d added and removed her from your list numerous times. You were never attracted to her physically and being her vagina didn&#39;t immediately seem like something you wanted to be. She was very nice and a lot of fun to be around. And more you&#39;d seen her walk, shaking that fat ass and rubbing those thick thighs together. You just couldn&#39;t help but wonder how being her vagina would feel. Would you feel her rub you every day, at every step? You ultimately put her on the list and kept her there.<br />
Still, you couldn&#39;t be sure it was any of them. You&#39;d heard many voices during the day. You were sure you heard your name at some point as well. Did they miss you already? The company that did the transference also handled your disappearance.<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t stop yourself, you smile. Or whatever has now become your smile. You feel your large sensitive lips moving at least and to your distress, your owner briefly stops moving. Did she noticed. Suddenly your world is rocked as her thighs dance around you. Slowly the seam at the crotch is pulled against your lips. For the first time you feel just how full and sensitive your lips are. It&#39;s the best feeling kiss you&#39;ve ever had. Maybe it was Stephanie, she had pretty full lips up top.<br />
<br />
It feels like forever for the pressure to finally build enough. You feel like you need to pee. You&#39;re sure you heard the word toilet. You&#39;ve never felt so nervous in your entire life. It&#39;s like Christmas back when you were a kid, except you are simultaneously the present and the recipient. Even better as you realize that the first thing you will see is the skin color of the legs. That still didn&#39;t tell you for certain who new proud owner was. You feel your new body tingle all over. You can unpack it twice! This moment couldn&#39;t come fast enough.<br />
<br />
Finally your owner stands still. You feel the pants shift around you. Here it comes! She seemed to struggle a bit with her pants, maybe it was Kate after all? Her pants always seemed too tight. The darkness disappears as the pants are pulled down. You could tell from the new light influx that her underwear was white. Was she wearing normal panties? How would a thong feel? Would lace feel different? Maybe you could persuade her to try latex. No no, focus! You have a whole lifetime, maybe even eternity to find out how different underwear would fit you, but only once could you do the first meeting.<br />
Light poured in as the underwear was pulled away, you felt a chill caress your sensitive lips. Even though you don&#39;t have eyes it took a little time for your vision to come into focus. You can see a little ahead and see the inside of the stall, as well as the ugly grey tiled floor and part of the toilet below you. You focus on the legs.</p>
