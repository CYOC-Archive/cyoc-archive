<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ryan look over his choices, he saw a spray can that says &quot;Nano-neoprene&quot; on it. The man walks over and picks it up to inspect it close. &quot;What is this for?&quot; Bill then walks over and sees Ryan holding the nano-neoprene spray can. &quot;Like I said, I won&#39;t tell you. But first, let&#39;s go to the boat and do it there when we get out to the ocean.&quot; Ryan nods and brought it over to the boat. Once out to sea, and now noon, Bill instructed Ryan, &quot;Okay, it&#39;s simple, take off your clothes and spray it on your skin before entering the water. Don&#39;t worry, it is safe, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan nods and did as he was told. He was then fully naked with his hand covering his genitals. He looks at the spray on his other hand and sighs. &quot;Here goes nothing...&quot; Ryan aims the can&#39;s nozzle on his arm and sprays a single burst as it darkens his skin, unknowingly slowly spreading and changing. He then did it on his stomach next, then on his legs and lastly on his neck. &quot;Next, you&#39;re going into the water to activate it the nano-neoprene.&quot; Ryan cocked a brow and looks at the water then back. &quot;You sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Just follow the instructions okay?&quot; Ryan pauses and shrugs. &quot;Okay.&quot; He turns to the back of the boat and jump into the water without any gear. Even swimming goggles. He finally feels something weird happening to his skin as he looked to where he sprayed his flesh. They were spreading further! Ryan was panicked yet curious as he stayed underwater still holding his breath. Oddly enough it was giving him an erection as he watched it spread down to his hand and up his shoulder while the second spray already taken all of his stomach and goes down his waist and crotch area. He brushed them with his right hand and it felt like neoprene, the material used to make wetsuits. And this neoprene is his new skin. The changes already spread further past his hands and watches his fingers fuse together and then erase any trace of his individual fingers. They soon look like paddle hands now.<br />
<br />
Ryan looked down at his crotch next after most of his torso has changed and reached his other arm and hand, the neoprene surface already reached the base of his erect manhood. But that soon changed as it was spreading up the stiff dick and started to shrink or curl up as it slwoly becomes a subtle bulge. He touched it with his neoprene paddle/mitten hands and it was still sensitive that made him open his mouth by accident. Air started to escape him, but his need for air never came as his insides were solidified. The changes soon reach past his legs and down his feet. His toes fuse together and started to stretch flat, almost looking like he has flippers. And at the sole of his right flipper foot was his name, though hard to see since his neoprene skin is black-grey.<br />
<br />
The last thing is his head. Already his hair starts to fall away from his head, becoming bald as the neoprene start to crawl up. In his mind throughout the change, he should be panicking. But oddly enough, he actually likes it as his neoprene skin was soaking up water like a sponge.<br />
<br />
Once it reaches his mouth, he groans as he felt the back of his throat fill up, while his mouth start to smooth and seal away and continue to crawl up. His ears were soon next as they seal and sink into his changing head like his nose, but as a little bump on the middle of his face. Finally, his eyes were left. His eyes soon close and seal as the changing neoprene went over his closed eyelids, leaving him in the dark for a moment. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, he can see clearly than before looking down at his flipper feet to the deep dark blue of the ocean. He tries to blink, but they refuse to close. He rubs where his eyes was at with his mitten hands. Hoping to make them move or feel for some sort of space, but there was no sign at all. He tries to speak, but it comes out muffled as he patted where his mouth was. He couldn’t even feel the inside of his mouth. His hearing sounds muffled, but he couldn’t tell since he is underwater as his mittens checked there next.<br />
<br />
Aside from the muffled ambience of the underwater, he hears static in his ears as it grew louder. Suddenly a voice can be heard… [Can you hear me Ryan? How did you like your transformation?] “Mmrph?!” His voice is still muffled, but in instinct he spoke to him via form of telepathy. [Bill? Is that you?! What am I?!]<br />
[You’re a mix of a zentai and a scuba diving doll. While you were busy watching your changes, I took the liberty of sending an underwater camera in front of you, recording it as you were the first to try out the prototype.]<br />
[Heh, perv. Alright, I’m gonna do some swimming practices to get the hang of it then meet you back up on the boat.] Ryan said.<br />
[Okay, also, the nanomachines also let you stay in radio contact with me, think of it as telepathy when you try and talk to me, and I can see what you see through your eyeless face clearly from my computer. Don’t worry, I’ll only use it for underwater research. And don’t worry about the depth of pressure as well. You’re immune to that.] He informs the human silouette. The featureless being nods. [Got it, thanks for the heads up! See you soon.]<br />
<br />
With that, he begins to swim around the boat and felt more agile than his old human body, somersaulting, rolling/spinning, and much more. He was glad he joined up for this research.</p>
