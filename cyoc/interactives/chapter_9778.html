<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Yawning widely, Cameron stretched in his chair as the warm glow from the sun bathed him. Smiling contentedly, he sat up in the chair he was lying in, but felt a small chill across his body. He looked down at himself; he was only wearing a pair of blue boxer shorts, with his medium sized gut barely hanging over the waist band. There was a light stain on the front of his boxer shorts. Touching the stain gingerly, he sniffed at it and noticed it was his cum. Scrunching his face a little, he wiped his hands across the arms of the chair. Strainging his head, he tried to remember what had happened. As he looked across the room, his eyes passed over his friends, who were also clad only in their underwear, and stopped on the open balcony screen door. Pushing his face into his large hands, Cameron's vague memories of the previous night began to surface through his mild hangover in a series of fast flashes.<br />
<br />
He was in an arm chair, the one he was sitting in now...then, he saw his clothes tightening and his face contorting in pain, but not screaming out...he was sitting in the chair again; his hairy chest now bare but muscles were bulging in every direction...he saw himself tearing off the jeans he was wearing and tossing them behind him...his stiffie pushing hard against his boxer shorts...him in a red Speedo, letting in the two Speedo Fags from the balcony quietly...then he saw himself kissing his friends as they slept, and watching on as their skin smoothed and tanned and as they burst free from their clothing...some woke up in the midst of this and ran for the door...he remembered himself taking two down at once with his strong arms, then laughing as they struggled to fight being kissed...they too then joined in...his mind grew hazy from here.<br />
<br />
Cameron looked up. It must have been some crazy dream, he attempted to convince himself. Probably something to do with all the alcohol I drunk...Getting up, he threw a glance behind him and spotted his clothes resting in a messy pile by the door.<br />
&quot;Jeez...must've been some night...&quot; Cameron muttered to himself as he leant over to pick them up.<br />
As he held the jeans in front of him, Cameron gasped. Large rips were present right across them; frayed edges of material poking out from every part of the jeans. The zipper had been split apart at an odd angle. Turning the jeans in his hands, he saw that the rear of the pants was torn wide open. Dropping them to the floor, Cameron grabbed his green flanelette shirt, but that was in an equally poor state. The buttons were all missing, and the stitching across the sleeves had been torn apart.   <br />
&quot;Damn it,&quot; Cam muttered, letting the shirt slip to the floor. He scratched the stubble across his chin and thought for a moment, placing his free hand on his bare, hairy chest. Shrugging, he made his way to the toilet in the hotel room.<br />
<br />
Standing in the sun-filled hall, he looked down at the few doors and tried to remember which was the toilet. Cam looked over the other guys who still lay, several snoring, on the floor in a peaceful sleep. Cameron, not wanting to disturb them, quietly walked to the first door in the hall way and opened it. Cupboard...Cameron moved along to the second door. Opening the door in one swift movement, he froze in shock at what he saw.<br />
<br />
The room he had walked into wasn't a bathroom, it was a bedroom, and what more, it was occupied already. Laying across the bed were two muscular men, intwined in each other's bulging biceps that wrapped across their backs and through their slightly bleached hair, both sleeping deeply. Both were wearing red Speedos and were far too close to each other then Cameron ever would have liked to see. They seemed to be vaguely familiar to Cam, but his mind was too shocked to think straight as he gazed upon the two Speedo Fags. He stumbled backwards a little, not wanting them to wake up and see him. As he did so, a ray of sun light broke through the room and passed over the Speedo Fags. <br />
<br />
Before Cameron could even leave though, he noticed patches of hair growing from the chests of the men on the bed. The biceps gave way into slightly flabby arms; the tanned skin fading to a regular day to day look. A short beard formed across one of the men's faces, along with it wrinkles and slightly gray-ish hair. Cameron recognized it as Jeff as Jeff's chest added an extra layer of flab across the front, pushing over the skimpy Speedo; one of the guys at the part last night. A few smaller wrinkles appeared across the other man's face, and his hair became slightly browner in the sun light. His chest became slightly flatter, and his legs began to tone down until they were similar to Cameron's. Cameron realised at this point that the second man was Seb, one of his friends who had disappeared briefly at the party last night. As this was going on, their penises hidden beneath their red Speedos had shrunk an inch or so, and the material of the Speedos began to change. Cameron noticed that the shiny spandex look faded into a pair of loose, white briefs on Jeff, and elongated into a pair of red, silk boxer shorts on Seb. The white Speedo logo on the front disappeared on each as the change progressed. Buttons formed across the front of Seb's boxer shorts, and subconsciously he reached forward and scratched himself through his shorts while he slept on. They finally returned to looking as they were last night, and as the change finished, they broke apart from each other's arms and rolled back across the bed to a separate side. Seb fell off the bed onto the floor, still in his slumber. Jeff mumbled something about keeping the noise down.<br />
<br />
Cameron laughed relived at this quietly, glad that whatever he had just seen was over. <br />
&quot;Maybe it was just a side-effect of the beer or something...&quot; he consolidated in his mind. &quot;Or a trick of the light,&quot; Cam convinced himself, as he tried the 3rd door in the hall way which revealed to be the bathroom. Moving to the sink, he cupped his hands together and splashed his face with some cold water to fully wake himself up. Was it just a dream though, or some trick of the light? It all seemed so real...but then, he had recalled a previous party in which he had apparently had an indepth discussion with a fridge, so it was more than likely just a repercussion from drinking.</p>
