<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well,&quot; you start, &quot;There was this necklace I found in my room, and I kind of tried it on. Do you know <br />
anything about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you must mean an animal charm,&quot; Nina replied with a hint of delight in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;An animal charm?&quot; you asked, &quot;What's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's something special we here at the resort put together for some of our rooms,&quot; Nina explained, &quot;That <br />
necklace you found can turn whoever wears it into a perfect mix of a human and an animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; you cry out in disbelief, &quot;How's that even possible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With magic of course,&quot; Nina answered, &quot;We have an employee here who's very talented in magic, and made a <br />
whole bunch of animal charms for the resort. Each charm works differently depending on what sort of animal is <br />
inscribed on the necklace.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what was it doing in my room?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;An animal charm is put into a room randomly,&quot; Nina explained, &quot;and you just happened to check into a room <br />
that had one. Lucky you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucky me?!&quot; you cry out loudly, &quot;I'm already growling and feeling weird! What if I lose control?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me; you won't,&quot; Nina assured you, &quot;That's just your first transformation kicking in. You just need to <br />
let go, and let the changes happen. I should know. After that, your in complete control of the changes, and <br />
can transform whenever you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; you say, &quot;thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;no problem,&quot; said Nina, &quot;Oh, before I hang up, it's a good idea to take off all of your clothes when you <br />
transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you serious?&quot; you ask with shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't want to risk ruining your clothes, do you?&quot; Nina asked. &quot;Besides, you won't need them when in that <br />
form; trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, thanks,&quot; you say, &quot;bye.&quot; you then hang up the phone and take a moment to let the information sink in. <br />
You just couldn't believe it. You were turning into an animal because of some necklace. You couldn't help but <br />
let out a soft whine like a little puppy, which then surprised you as the changes were about to happen. You <br />
then remember what Nina told you to do, and decided to head into the bathroom for some privacy.<br />
<br />
Once inside you lock the door behind you so you wouldn't be disturbed. Next, you quickly undress yourself all <br />
the way until all of your clothes, including your bra and panties, are on the floor. The only thing left on <br />
was the necklace, this so called animal charm, since taking it off didn't seem like a good idea. You then <br />
approach a full length mirror so you can examine the changes in full. You once again notice the markings on <br />
the necklace, noticing the wolf at the bottom. It made sense now that you would be turning into some kind of <br />
wolf, considering that you were growling like one this whole time. There was no going back now, you closed <br />
your eyes and began to concentrate on letting go, and letting the changes take you over.<br />
<br />
It was then that you felt a tingling sensation across your body. You opened your eyes to see that they started <br />
glowing bright blue, and your golden hair was growing to mid-waist length. You also notice your breast <br />
growing, and you blush a little as they swell all the way to D-cups. you then feel a small ache at the base of <br />
your spine as you look back to see a nub swelling from just above your butt. This nub quickly grew into a full <br />
length tail, which soon grew thick golden fur. You couldn't help but smile a little as your new appendage <br />
wagged behind you freely. Looked back into the mirror to be surprised as you just notice the set of nubs that <br />
appeared while your tail grew. On closer inspection, those nubs turned out to be teats, which made you blush <br />
even more as you not only have bigger breasts, but also a set of six teats lining across your belly. You then <br />
begin to lose your balance as your legs begin to change as well. You watch as your feet and legs contort and <br />
change into that of a wolf's that are proportionate to your size, followed by a full coat of gold fur that <br />
covers your new legs, and around your waist. Despite your entire body being that of a hybrid human/wolf, you <br />
are surprised that you are able to stand with now problem, and you can feel the muscles in your legs being <br />
much stronger than before, as well as the new padding at the bottom of your new paws for feet. <br />
<br />
You suddenly feel a pulling sensation in your ears, as they begin to move up the sides of your head a little. <br />
You watch your reflection as they slowly migrate up the sides of your head, and also change into the shape of <br />
wolf ears, complete with golden fur to blend with your hair. While that was happening the fur from your waist <br />
continued to spread upward on your body, covering your chest completely, and stopping at your neck. you then <br />
notice that the nipples on your breasts, as well as the teats across your belly, are no longer visible under <br />
the golden fur that covered them, and the same could be said for your special area down between your legs, <br />
giving you a small sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
You continue to watch as the fur spread down your arms and quickly covered your hands. You couldn't help but <br />
stare at the palms of your hands as they swelled into pads similar to those on your now paw-like feet. you <br />
also watch as your nails turned darker and grew longer and curved into claws.<br />
<br />
knowing what was coming next you watched your reflection again as the fur began spreading past your neck. You <br />
look at your nose as it morphed into a black, leathery, wet one like a canine's, as the fur covered that last <br />
parts of human skin on your face, you couldn't help but wince as you heard cracking noises as you watched your <br />
face grow outward into a wolf's muzzle, while your canines grew into powerful fang and new teeth grew in to <br />
fit in your growing muzzle. A few seconds later, a loud crack was heard, and the tingling ceased.<br />
<br />
Realizing that the changes were finally over. You looked into the mirror once more to look at something <br />
otherworldly. You were now a slender, busty anthropomorphic wolf with blond hair and fur, and bright blue <br />
eyes. You expected to look like some sort of animal or monster, but instead you still had some of your human <br />
features that blended beautifully with your new animal ones. You looked into the face of your new form and <br />
thought about how cute you looked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; you say to yourself, realizing you could still talk, only your voice sounded more mature and feminine <br />
that before. &quot;Maybe this trip won't be so bad after all.&quot;</p>
