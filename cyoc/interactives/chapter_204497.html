<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thanks to rawr7 for helping me out once again! </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Todd returned home later that evening, feeling rather numb to everything that had happened during his training with Xarxos. While a small part of him still felt like everything he’d done was ridiculously fucked up, he started to realize that Xarxos did have a point. Those people were criminals who hurt a lot of innocent people. They had no remorse for what they did, and they deserved to be punished for it. God, he was starting to sound like the main character of Death Book…<br />
<br />
The wolf walked into the apartment he shared with Mark and shut the door behind him. As he took a few steps forward, he was suddenly grabbed from behind by a strong pair of hands. <br />
<br />
“Welcome home, pup,” Mark said, speaking in a smooth, seductive tone. “You’ve been gone an awfully long time today.”<br />
<br />
“I-I’m sorry…” Todd whimpered. “I was out training with Xarxos to learn how to use the book.”<br />
<br />
Mark sighed and shook his head. “You’re still going on about this whole book thing?” He asked. “Hun, I don’t understand; why are you so set on convincing me this book is magic?”<br />
<br />
“Because it is!” Todd shouted, pulling away from Mark’s grasp and turning around to face him. “Just touch the book and see for yourself!” <br />
<br />
The snow leopard let out another sigh. “Alright, I’ll touch your magic book,” he said, rolling his eyes. “But I know that this is all some elaborate joke that-” Mark was cut off as soon as his hand touched the book. Blood began to drip from his nose as Todd quickly grabbed a box of tissues off the coffee table and began to dab them at his bleeding nostril. Mark felt warmth tricking down the back of his throat and copper in his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Mark, stay with me!” Todd said, wrapping his arm around the feline and guiding him over to the couch. As he sat down, the nosebleed finally began to die down, and Mark began to take a few deep breaths to calm himself down. <br />
<br />
“Wh-What the fuck…?” the feline asked quietly, still a bit shaken up. “What…What the fuck was all of that?!”<br />
<br />
“That was your life before the reality shift,” Todd said quietly. “What do you remember?” <br />
<br />
“I…I went to college and got a degree in Environmental Science,” the snow leopard said. “I worked at a lab just outside of town. It wasn’t the most exciting job, but it paid the bills.”<br />
<br />
“And…were you always gay?”<br />
<br />
Mark nodded. “The book didn’t change anything there,” he said before laying back on the couch. “So you weren’t lying…that book really is magic…”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Todd said, nodding. <br />
<br />
“Christ, I’m sorry I didn’t believe you.”<br />
<br />
“No, it’s okay. It was a ridiculous claim anyway. You were right to not believe me, even if it hurt that you didn’t.” The two sat in silence for a minute before Mark spoke up. <br />
<br />
“So, this book can do almost anything the user wants, right?” he asked curiously. <br />
<br />
“Within reason,” Todd replied. “You can’t change reality too much, or you could end up seriously fucking with people’s lives and causing a massive paradox. That, or the Auditors will do something to you.”<br />
<br />
“What do I need to do to cast a spell?”<br />
<br />
“It’s simple: with one hand on the book, you think how you want the subject of the spell to change, point at them, and say the name of the spell. You want to give it a try?” <br />
<br />
“Uh…sure!” Mark picked up the book. “So what should I try changing?” <br />
<br />
“Why not me?” Todd suggested. <br />
<br />
Mark’s eyes widened. “You?!” He asked, sounding rather alarmed. “Are you sure?” <br />
<br />
Todd shrugged his shoulders. “Not really,” he admitted. “But I trust you, and I know you won’t do anything stupid. Just think of what kind of anthro you want me to be, point at me, and say ‘half’. But the catch is, I can’t hear it, so you need to whisper. If your target hears you say the words, reality doesn’t shift. I won’t remember being a wolf until I touch the book again, but I can always change back later.”<br />
<br />
Todd stuck his fingers in his ears and gestured for Mark to give it a shot.<br />
<br />
“Okay…if you insist…” Mark took a second to think about what kind of anthro he wanted to change Todd into before a grin crossed his face. He checked the Book, trying to find a good spell, before a good one caught his eye. With the Book of Transfiguration in his left hand, the snow leopard pointed at the wolf with his right hand and whispered,“Shape.”<br />
<br />
Almost instantly, Todd’s twunkish body began to lose muscle, giving him a much more twinkish appearance. His muzzle began to shorten as his nose shrank and took on a more triangular shape. <br />
<br />
Todd took his fingers out of his ears and felt his shorter muzzle, watching in awe as his hands shrank slightly, looking a bit more dainty. “What am I becoming?”<br />
<br />
“You’ll see,” Mark replied, watching in fascination as the wolf transformed before his very eyes. <br />
<br />
As his ears shrank slightly, Todd’s fur began to change from gray to white. His large, beast-like paws began to shrink into smaller, more dainty ones. His claws retreated back into his paws as the wolf’s tail lost most of its fur, looking much more like a cat’s tail. As his eyes changed into those of a feline, whiskers began to grow around Todd’s mouth. A small bell popped into existence on Todd’s blue collar, jingling slightly. Then, the changes stopped. Where there had once been a twunkish wolf now stood a twinkish cat. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit, it actually worked!” Mark exclaimed, looking at Todd and laughing in amazement. The cat began to laugh along with him. <br />
<br />
“What are we laughing at, daddy?” The feline asked, looking at the snow leopard curiously. “Did you use the book to do something?” The cat looked down at himself curiously. Same white fur, same dainty paws, same adorable twinkish body…nothing seemed to have changed. <br />
<br />
Mark set the book down and strode over to the smaller feline, wrapping his tail around him. “I changed something, but you won’t know what for a while,” the leopard said, reaching down and groping the cat’s member. <br />
<br />
Todd let out a high-pitched gasp as his cock was grabbed, thrusting his hips slightly into his lover’s hand. Mark moved behind him and stuck two of his fingers into the smaller cat’s mouth. <br />
<br />
“You like it when I do that, kitten?” the leopard asked, whispering seductively into Todd’s ear. The cat twink let out a mewl of pleasure as his small, pink cock began to emerge from its sheath. <br />
<br />
“Y-Yes sir…” Todd meowed softly. “I love feeling your strong hands all over my body…” Mark felt the cat’s cock begin to leak a little bit of cum, and a devious smile crossed his muzzle. <br />
<br />
“Hop on the lat pulldown machine, kitten,” Mark said, gesturing to the piece of workout equipment he had set up in the living room near the door to the balcony. “I don’t think that you’ve had the chance to use it yet. I was very excited when this came in a few weeks ago.”<br />
<br />
The cat gave Mark a confused look, but he obliged. He sat down on the seat. “What next sir?” <br />
<br />
“Go ahead and try to lift some weight.”<br />
<br />
Todd was even more confused now, but he did as he was told. He reached up and grabbed the handlebar, pulling down with all his might. He couldn’t lift the weights very high, as he had little to no muscle. Eventually, he could pull anymore, and he went to let go of the bar. Suddenly, a pair of metal bands emerged from the bar, slipping over Todd’s wrists and rendering the feline unable to let go of the bar. As the weights went down, the bar went up, pulling Todd with it. Another pair of metal bands emerged from the bottom of the machine just below the seat, these ones going around Todd’s ankles, essentially suspending him in midair. <br />
<br />
“S-Sir?!” Todd shouted, unsure of what was going on. “I-I think something’s wrong with your workout machine! I’m stuck!” <br />
<br />
Mark chuckled and approached the cat, admiring how nicely he was suspended. “No, nothing’s wrong with the machine, kitten,” he explained. “That may look like a regular lat pulldown machine that you’d see in any gym in the country, but it’s actually a specially designed sex device. It allows for the dom to put their sub in multiple positions while building the sub’s muscle and stamina. For example…” <br />
<br />
Mark walked up to the machine and pressed a button on the side. The machine began to whir, making parts shift slightly as Todd’s body was repositioned. He was twisted 180 degrees and bent forward, presenting his ass to the dominant snow leopard. The bigger feline licked his chops before giving the smaller feline’s bubbly ass a quick smack, causing Todd to let out a yowl in surprise. <br />
<br />
“Wh-What was that for?!” the cat asked, looking over his shoulder at Mark. <br />
<br />
“Just because,” the leopard responded, smirking. “You’re fucking caked, you know.” The smaller feline blushed as the bigger male placed his hands on his hips, gently grinding his length against Todd’s hole. The small cat mewled in pleasure, ready for his lover’s cock to penetrate his tight hole. <br />
<br />
“You want this inside you kitten?” Mark asked seductively. “You want the big, strong snow leopard to fuck your slutty little ass and make you scream?”<br />
<br />
“Yes! Yes please daddy!” Todd begged. “Please put your thicc cock inside me and pound me like there’s no tomorrow!” <br />
<br />
Mark chuckled. So Todd was a bit sluttier in this reality. He could definitely live with that. The leopard began to press the tip of his cock against Todd’s hole, beginning to push it inside. <br />
<br />
The smaller cat moaned happily as his ass was stretched open by his lover’s thick, feline cock. He absolutely loved the feeling of having his daddy’s cock inside him! There wasn’t any other feeling in the world that could surpass it! As Mark began to thrust, Todd threw his head back and meowed happily. The slutty feline began to push against Mark’s thrusts, trying his hardest to get the bigger feline’s cock deeper inside of him. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, you like it when I fuck you like this, kitten?” <br />
<br />
“Y-Yes daddy! I love it so much!” Todd’s ass felt so full…so wonderfully full. His breathing and heart rate quickened as the snow leopard’s thrusts began to pick up speed, ramming against his prostate each time. With every hit, Todd cried out in pleasure, mewling and meowing as he bucked against his lover’s aggressive thrusts. <br />
<br />
“Getting pretty close now…” Mark grunted, pounding Todd’s prostate again and and again. “You ready, kitten?”<br />
<br />
“Yes! I want your warm seed inside my slutty asshole!” Mark happily obliged the cat’s wish. With one last strong thrust, the snow leopard released his hot seed into the feline’s ass. Feeling his lover’s seed inside him was enough to push Todd over the edge, and the cat mewled in pleasure as he came on the seat of the machine beneath him. Once his orgasm finally died down, Mark panted and pulled out of Todd’s hole. <br />
<br />
“I’ll be right back, kitten,” he said, and Todd could hear him walking up the stairs. A few minutes later, Mark came back and shoved something large and thick up his ass. As the cat moaned in pleasure, a ball gag was stuck in his mouth and fastened around his head. <br />
<br />
“There,” Mark said. “Now you can have a bit more fun without making too much noise. Let me just turn on the Red Rocket…” The leopard pressed the button on the base of the dildo and smirked as Todd let out a muffled moan as the dildo began to vibrate and stretch his ass. <br />
<br />
With his slut entertained, Mark grabbed the Book of Transfiguration off the coffee table and walked to the front door. He turned to Todd and smirked, watching the cat cum for a second time. <br />
<br />
“I’m going to go check on things downstairs,” the snow leopard said. “You behave now!” All Mark got was a muffled moan, and he shut the door behind him. <br />
<br />
Mark walked downstairs to the bar to see how the day was going so far. Even though the bar had just opened its doors for the day, there were already a few patrons. A gay human couple was dining at a table near the karaoke stage, while a group of dogs and a wolf were looking at menus, preparing to order something for an early dinner. The snow leopard let out a content sigh before walking over to the bar and taking a seat. He failed to notice the staff’s clothing change from a casual t-shirt and shorts to a harness and a jockstrap. <br />
<br />
“How’s the shift going Hank?” Mark asked the boar bartender, who was in the middle of drying off a pint glass that he’d just washed. <br />
<br />
“Going well so far, boss,” Hank replied, his gut jiggling as he spoke, losing consistency, vibrating itself out of existence, replaced by a well-defined set of abs. “Not too busy just yet. Got a few patrons in here early if you couldn’t already tell.” <br />
<br />
The decor of the building slowly began to shift, changing things so the establishment no longer resembled a gay bar. The karaoke machine disappeared, being replaced by a stripper pole. Off to the side, some private rooms popped into existence, ready if patrons wanted to get a little wilder. <br />
<br />
“Are we expecting a big rush of patrons tonight?” the snow leopard asked. Hank laughed and nodded his head, double chin pulling itself back under his chin, muzzle becoming more squared. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, people are always coming in for a show on nights like these,” the boar replied. “Got some good performers coming out tonight. There’s a stallion named Star who wants to apply to work as a stripper full-time.” <br />
<br />
“Nice, I’ll review his application later tonight.” Mark smiled and adjusted the straps of his harness, enjoying the cool air on his fur.<br />
<br />
Then, Mark shook his head in confusion. Stripper? He didn’t employ strippers! This wasn’t a strip club!<br />
<br />
“Hank, why is a stripper applying to work here?” Mark asked. <br />
<br />
“Because we’re a strip club?” Hank gave his boss a confused look and turned to fix some bottles, wide rear rippling and tightening into a bubblebutt. <br />
<br />
“What?! Hank, what’s gotten into you?!” Mark turned sharply around, thick ass cheeks wobbling in his thong. “This isn’t a stri-” <br />
<br />
The snow leopard stopped mid-sentence, his eyes widening at what he saw. <br />
<br />
Instead of a normal gay bar, his establishment was now a strip club, complete with a stripper pole and rooms for private shows. Where the human couple had once been sitting was now an anthro fox couple wearing nothing but tight thongs. The group of dogs and the wolf had now shifted to having an orgy right there on the table, with a smaller golden retriever taking the cock of a sheepdog in his mouth and the wolf in his ass. <br />
<br />
“What the hell?!” Mark exclaimed, voice rising a few octaves higher. “What the hell happened to the bar?!” <br />
<br />
Hank snorted, moobs jiggling and then heaving into a set of heavy pecs. “Bar?” He asked. “Kid, are you okay?”<br />
<br />
“Kid? Hank, I know I’m younger than you, but I’m twenty seven years old! And I’m still your manager!” Mark adjusted his harness again to better show off his tight, lithe musculature. It kept getting loose on him. <br />
<br />
“First off, I’m the manager of this establishment,” the boar said. “And secondly, with that twinkish appearance of yours, you could’ve fooled me.”<br />
<br />
Mark looked down at himself, and he panicked. His body was rapidly losing muscle definition, giving him a slim, almost feminine look. The world seemed slightly bigger all of a sudden, and the snow leopard realized that he had gotten shorter! <br />
<br />
“You lost, little kitten?” Hank asked, reaching over and scratching under Mark’s chin. “You need a big strong boar daddy to help you out?” <br />
<br />
“Wh-What?! No, I’m…I’m a top…” Mark found himself struggling to finish the sentence, purring. He was a top…wasn’t he? Why was his dick so hard? <br />
<br />
“Oh, getting into some role-play, huh? Daddy likes!” Hank laughed and walked around the counter, standing in front of Mark. <br />
<br />
Mark gulped, staring at the heavily muscled boar, fear and desire raging inside him.<br />
<br />
“So you think you’re a top, little kitten? Why don‘t you let me help you realize your place?” Hank pulled down his jockstrap and revealed a large, spiraled pig cock that made Mark’s mouth water in spite of himself. He placed his hands on Mark’s sides and lifted the smaller snow leopard up above his lap. <br />
<br />
“No! No stop! I’m not a bottom!” Mark shouted as he felt the tip of Hank’s cock press against his virgin pucker. Or rather, what should have been a virgin pucker. Instead of tightening, keeping his intruder at bay, his hole was loose, the boar’s thick cock head almost slipping right in.<br />
<br />
Then, the boar lowered the feline twink onto his cock, watching as his spiral cock screwed itself into Mark’s hole. The snow leopard let out cries of pain and pleasure every time a new coil entered him. Then the spirals started rubbing his prostate and it was mostly pleasure and moans.<br />
<br />
“You like that, kitten?” Hank grunted, running his rough hands along the twink’s sides. “You want more of this big boar inside you?” <br />
<br />
Mark whimpered as he realized something that scared him: he <I>did</I> want more. Every thrust made Mark feel immense pleasure. His cock was drooling precum. The feeling of the boar’s cock expanding inside him felt incredible! Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad if he…<br />
<br />
The snow leopard twink began to ride up and down on his lover’s cock, moaning happily as he did. Hank smirked as the twink began to succumb to his desires. <br />
<br />
“You’re such a good kitten,” the boar said, petting Mark’s head. “I’m glad I hired you.”<br />
<br />
Hired him? That’s right…Hank had hired him to be a stripper. The boar ended up taking such a liking to him that he decided to keep Mark as his kitten. Mark loved being treated dirty by his buff boar daddy…<br />
<br />
The snow leopard shook his head. No! That wasn’t right! He wasn’t a bottom! But…it felt so good! It was getting harder and harder to deny with each thrust. His old life was beginning to disappear, and his new life as a twink kitten for his daddy was becoming more and more appealing. <br />
<br />
“Gonna cum real soon kitten,” Hank grunted. “You’re gonna be leaking cum for hours after this. Are you ready?” <br />
<br />
“Yes daddy!” Mark squealed. “Cum inside me!” <br />
<br />
Hank thrust harder, his orgasm rapidly approaching. Mark bucked against his thrusts and pushed the boar’s cock deeper. He was ready…ready to become his daddy’s twink. His old life was on the verge of disappearing, the part of him that was still holding on losing its grip with every passing second. When he felt Hank’s balls tense up, Mark closed his eyes and moaned, ready to let go. <br />
<br />
Just then, the jingling sound of the bells that signifies the door opening rang through the building…<br />
<br />
And suddenly Mark was back in the bar-stool, paws gripping the wooden bar counter, hips bucking into thin air, cock unloading into his pants. Hank was staring at him open-mouthed in shock, no longer the muscle daddy, but just average tubby Hank. Mark could hear whispers behind him, about him.<br />
<br />
The snow leopard looked at himself in a panic. He was…back to normal?! He looked around the room, and sure enough, everything had returned to normal. No stripper pole. No private rooms. No orgies on the table. <br />
<br />
Everything was back to normal.<br />
<br />
“Magic’s not real, huh Mr. Snow Leopard?” A familiar voice asked. Mark looked towards the source of the voice and saw Xarxos hulking form standing in the doorway, a smug grin on his face. “You <b>have</b> always been a snow leopard, right?”<br />
<br />
“Y-You!” Mark shouted, getting up from the barstool and approaching the minotaur. “What did you do? Did you do all that?!”<br />
<br />
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Xarxos replied, shrugging his shoulders. “What I do know is that all the newscasters in the world are all humans, and you most definitely aren’t.” <br />
<br />
Mark’s eyes widened as he realized that the minotaur had a point. While he had touched the book earlier and saw memories of being a human, how did he know that those were even real? What if the hook was just showing him something from an alternate reality or something? He had vivid memories of being raised by snow leopard parents and going to school with other anthros, but what if those memories were the fake ones?<br />
<br />
Mark stumbled backwards, looking at the minotaur with a horrified look on his face. After taking a few more steps, he turned around completely and ran upstairs, bolting into his apartment and shutting the door behind him. He set the book down on the coffee table and walked over to the sex machine, turning it off and taking the dildo out of Todd’s ass before taking off the ball gag as well. <br />
<br />
“Daddy? Why did you stop the machine?” Todd asked, looking at Mark with sad eyes. <br />
<br />
“Take your book back…” Mark said quietly. “I don’t want to touch it again…”</p>
