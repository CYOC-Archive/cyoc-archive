<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James stood there, her ears down, her tail curled between her legs, panting loudly. What had gone wrong? She knew she hadn't been <br />
recognized by anyone on staff. She hadn't sent her application in from her home computer. She'd even gone the extra mile and faked all the <br />
medical records. That DNA sample wasn't hers, so...? Then she realized the obvious. The transformation process couldn't just overwrite your <br />
DNA with some standard template. Everyone of the same species would come out looking identical, or with just a few different models per <br />
species anyway. It would have to scan you somehow when the process started, and make changes from there.<br />
<br />
She worried a bit just how the hammer was going to come down. They hadn't tossed her back out right away... were they just going to lead her <br />
along for a bit, make it extra humiliating? No, no... If they were going to take that route, she wouldn't have been called in like this already. <br />
They'd have watched her squirm for a while, tested her commitment to her disguise. If there was one thing James understood it was how to <br />
mess with somebody's head. Apparently they thought she'd punished herself enough, trying to slip by as a female. She new she could look <br />
forward to having her nose rubbed in that at every opportunity. It's not like she wasn't used to being called a bitch now and then. Irate crybaby <br />
gamers had a pretty limited pool of insults, but in the correct context like this it carried a bit more sting. Naturally, she'd have to stay female <br />
longer than she had expected now too. All that stuff about about testosterone and 'gender change syndrome' was clearly just Harry trying to <br />
mess with her, but she recognized the tone with the rest. 'You have been caught cheating, and as punishment we are going to confiscate your <br />
equipment.' It's just that the equipment in question this time was something a bit more personal than some ill-gotten loot in a videogame.<br />
<br />
Still, things could be a lot worse, couldn't they? In a certain sense, this was just fast-tracking her plan. The rest of the cadets she'd entered with <br />
were going through drills and training exercises except for that one female they pulled aside. Well, that other female. Katie apparently. James <br />
did have a legitimate edge in experience. She knew a good chunk of the park like the back of her paw... well, the old one anyway. She was <br />
experienced with this sort of body, and she knew what most of the other species were capable of. She also had some inside information they'd <br />
love to have. All those imitators she'd attracted. &quot;Just don't go fingering your friends,&quot; she remembered Max saying. Ha! What friends? She was <br />
the Lone Wolf! She didn't need anybody! Come to think of it, Max might even be a bit of a ticking time bomb. James had always kept a strict <br />
policy never to really hurt anyone. Just scare'em enough to make a good chase of it. The way Max talked though, sometimes she had to <br />
wonder...<br />
<br />
Just as she'd restored her self-confidence enough to get her tail wagging, Zack arrived, staring at her with his face a mixture of amusement <br />
and contempt. More of the former than Harry had had at least. &quot;Well, well, well!&quot; he said, pacing around her as she found herself slipping back <br />
into a submissive posture. &quot;Look at the big bad wolf now! I have to say, I never would have figured you for the type.&quot; She kept her head down <br />
the whole time, but she could feel him just towering over her. Harry had seemed a lot bigger too, but that didn't make sense, did it? As a wolf <br />
she had several inches on all the huskies in the park, and she'd never really compared them to each other, but the females had to be about the <br />
same size, right? Some weak little girl couldn't ever handle herself in a fight, they'd have to be built like a man, powerful and muscular. Was it <br />
just psychological? All this embarrassment making her feel smaller? Had whatever scan caught her happened so early they'd customized her <br />
body to add to the humiliation? She'd have to compare herself to one of the females later.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what was it you tried getting people to call you when you thought you'd actually pull this off? Goldie was it? That certainly is a pretty coat to <br />
match it too. Just had to make sure you stood out from the crowd, huh? Well, it suits you a lot better than any of the other options. You don't <br />
look like much of a James now, or whatever it was you put on your application. Frank? Fred? Something like that? And you are certainly not a <br />
'lone wolf' anymore. Not with me acting as your babysitter until we're sure you're going to be a well-behaved little bitch for us. So let's make it <br />
official. From now on, you're going to answer to Goldie. Do you understand that Goldie?&quot;<br />
<br />
He was clearly enjoying himself with all this, but she could hardly blame him for it under the circumstances. Getting angry would only just <br />
make things worse. The important thing to do now was to prove she'd play ball. No matter how she was treated, she had to be friendly and <br />
enthusiastic. She just nodded at this latest twist of the knife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Young lady!&quot; barked Zack. &quot;In this organization, we do not give a meek little nod when we are addressed by our superiors. We say 'sir, yes sir!' <br />
Now let's try this again. What is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, Goldie, sir!&quot; replied Goldie, as enthusiastically as she could. She'd heard the huskies discuss things often enough to know they didn't really <br />
practice this sort of militant formality, but she had to earn his approval... and not just to keep out of trouble. The canine loyalty built into every <br />
husky was starting to sink in. Zack was her superior in the pack, and was he was taking a special interest in her no less. Making sure he knew <br />
she was a good loyal pack mate was gradually working its way towards being the most important thing in the world to her. Well, behind proving <br />
the same to Harry. He was pack leader, and it was starting to bother her more than she'd admit that she did not meet his approval.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a good girl,&quot; replied Zack, &quot;but we don't slouch here either. Back straight! Square those shoulders! And you always look me in the eye <br />
when I'm talking to you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, yes, sir!&quot; She immediately complied. Obedience came so easily like this, it was almost like cheating. She wouldn't have to fake her way to <br />
earning everyone's trust. If someone said jump, she'd just jump. No need to think about it, almost like putting herself on autopilot. She had to <br />
look up a little to meet Zach's eyes, so being smaller couldn't all be in her head. The eyes themselves were a bit surprising too. Usually when <br />
she looked someone in the eye, it was to psyche them out. She'd watch them go wide with fear, or narrow with contempt. Here though, it was <br />
the other way around. She was just trying to project her sincerity at those harsh blue discs, hoping they'd look at her a bit more kindly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl. Now, since that's still a new body for you, let's put it through its paces. Why don't you show me all your old stalking grounds, see if <br />
you recognize any old friends, and hop to it! There's no way in hell you're getting put through the usual combat training anytime soon. You're <br />
going to have to prove yourself before that. In the meantime, we can't have you getting soft, so we're going to jog until I'm getting tired, then <br />
it's going to be pushups and jumping jacks for you. Gotta get you used to that upper body strength and how those pert little attention grabbers <br />
you're sporting now handle vigorous motion somehow, don't we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, yes, sir!&quot; Goldie's tail wagged a little. That had been a hint of friendliness in his tone, hadn't it? Was her enthusiasm winning him over?<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Naomi had snatched the phone from Charlotte's grip as soon as she realized who was on the other end, eager to hear how Harry was handling <br />
things. &quot;You know, it's about time someone tried putting my theory into practice! I bet you see results overnight. And hey, maybe this will <br />
finally convince you and Zack to finally upgrade! Come on, let's make a bet on it, if the creepy little dirtbag outshines the other recruits, you <br />
follow her example, what do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry jokingly agreed he would on the condition she come try life as a man and see how it didn't turn her into a monster if 'Goldie' fell back <br />
into her old habits. She stopped smiling when she heard what he was really calling about though.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no way in hell that sort of thing would go on under my watch. You can't be soft with management like that. Just say the word and I'll <br />
march back in there and set'em straight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I've got this. Just enjoy yourself out there... and put Charlotte back on the phone already, would you?&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Vinny grinned to himself as he counted down the days until the start of the tournament. Messing with the locals was getting to them. A few <br />
local bucks had already agreed to compete, hoping to take the brothers down a peg. If they egged that &quot;Lord Jeremy&quot; there into agreeing to <br />
compete on their terms, the rest would jump in. That would make for a very appealing new gender ratio at the end of the day, and odds were <br />
very much in favor of most of the converts coming from the locals.<br />
<br />
Half the new pledges hadn't read what they were agreeing to, and the locals never saw the paperwork to begin with, but the park staff was <br />
going to enforce things anyway. In just another 7 days, they'd be holding a double elimination tournament, locking antlers like proper bucks. <br />
Anyone eliminated in the first few rounds was going to lose their horns. He'd gotten funny looks from the park, but with everyone agreeing up <br />
front not to welch out if they lost, and his 'generous donation,' the park had agreed to enforce it, reprocessing the biggest losers as does, <br />
making sure the winners all got a nice 'prize' at the end. He'd also gotten the park to agree to a few enhancements. The original designs of <br />
these bodies hadn't really been made expecting everyone to be butting heads at high speeds after all. A little skull reinforcement was just a <br />
good safety feature. It would give them an edge over the locals but no one was forcing them to compete. Vinny wasn't quite sure they'd be held <br />
to the reassignment clause by the same token, but their herd mentality should at least let them leave the choicest original does to the victors.<br />
<br />
What really had him smiling though had nothing to do with the park. Well, almost nothing. Chad was so confident he'd come out on top of all <br />
this, he hadn't exempted himself from the pledge. The Fraternal Order of the Stag's leadership would fall, for the next year at least, to whoever <br />
came out as champion of the tournament. If he dropped out early enough, he was even sworn to become a doe. The one bit of real corruption <br />
Vinny's money bought him was a bit of extra physical enhancement, just for himself. It wasn't a huge edge, but it was enough to get one over <br />
on Chad, particularly since there may have been an 'oversight' in arranging his extra 'safety' features. With how he was laying out the brackets, <br />
Chad should be out of the running after the first two rounds, and after years of having to put up with his arrogant macho jock routine, Vinny <br />
knew who he'd pick for his little 'slave' once things were over.<br />
<br />

Elsewhere, the rest of Terry's usual crew were wondering how he was faring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think the park is really as bad as Terry thinks?&quot; asked Chuck, his usual cameraman for these projects.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a chance,&quot; replied Wendy. &quot;All those people sticking with their forms are just members of the furry crowd would be my guess. For Terry it's <br />
just going to be a long camping trip. I suppose there's a chance he might get a little more in touch with his feminine side, and I'm hoping he <br />
learns to eat properly, having a stomach for two months that can't handle red meat. You?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're probably right. Still feels weird being cut off from all communication like this though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Wendy, &quot;I think they offer some kind of one-day guess passes, don't they? Pretty sure there's enough wiggle room in the project <br />
budget to check in on him. Weekly would get a bit pricy but, two week check-ins seem reasonable. Let's see, today's Friday, he's been there <br />
since Saturday. So, some time next weekend? Grill him with some questions on how it's going, come back and do it again when it's been a <br />
whole month, then maybe once more around day 45?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck shook his head with a smirk. &quot;I'm not sure he'd be happy to see me like that. Masculine pride and all that. So were you thinking of doing <br />
the bunny girl thing too if you pay a visit, or what?&quot;</p>
