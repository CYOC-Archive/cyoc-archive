<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle woke up the next morning to his mum telling him that she was now leaving for work. He replied with a simple &quot;ok&quot; due to him just waking up.<br />
<br />
Once his mum had gone out the door, Kyle got up and watched his mums car leave the driveway. Once it was out of sight, he went into his draw and pulled out the age progression machine and placed it on the desk.<br />
<br />
Before he transformed again, Kyle had to make sure that he could get the money for the spell. He had about half the money in his savings but he needed more. He knew that his mum had a tin that she kept in her room with all of her money in it. Kyle knew that the tin would have more than enough.<br />
<br />
He took the tin from the shelf but it had a lock. It wasn&#39;t a key lock, it was a number lock. Four digits to be exact. Kyle tried his year of birth first but it wasn&#39;t it. He tryed his mum and dads year of birth aswel but the lock didn&#39;t get looser in the slightest. Then he thought that it could be the year his parents got married which was three years before he was born. He twisted the dials to that year and he pulled the lock and it uncoupled from the tin. Bingo. He opened the tin and there was defiantly more than enough in there but he only took what he needed.<br />
<br />
As he closed and locked the tin he started to feel a bad for stealing his mums money but he was still willing to go the distance to get that spell.<br />
<br />
Kyle went back to his room and placed the money on his desk next to the machine.<br />
<br />
Kyle then took off his boxers too take one last look at his thirteen year old body again before he used the machine once again to make him twenty-eight.<br />
<br />
He finished looking at his body and grabbed the box/machine and set the age to twenty-eight and hit the yellow button<br />
<br />
(From author: I wasn&#39;t going to wright the transformation again because I already did it in part 1 but I decided that I wanted to redo it)<br />
<br />
Just like last time, the yellow wave struck kyles forehead and he was starting to feel a bit dizzy but as soon as the dizziness faded, his his feet had grown to a huge size and his legs began to get longer, larger, muscular and the tingly sensation from last time returned as hair covered his legs. His ass grew to fit his manly body as it grew enough to look sexy but not too much to give of a feminine vibe. Then Kyle looked down at his penis as grew in size and length. Just after that his testicals dropped and filled with a ton of semen. Hair also grew around his genitals and it  felt little weird like last time but not enough to bother him that much. Then his upper body (stomach, chest, back and arms) grew in length like his legs did. Kyles chest then began to get broader along with his shoulders. His arms then grew bigger and stronger and his hands got larger and manlier. Kyles chest hair then grew out long and thick to give of a very sexy vibe. His arms also grew a bit of hair but just like last time, it didn&#39;t grow that much though. Next kyles face altered to give off the manlier, adult look. Kyle then waited for the tingly sensation in his face which happened in matter of seconds, his beard grew back even thicker and sexier than before.<br />
<br />
Kyle stroked his mustache and then rubbed his hands through the rest of his beard. &quot;I&#39;m glad to be back&quot; said Kyle in his deep voice.<br />
<br />
Once again Kyle got an erection just like last time and felt as if he needed to give himself pleasure again. Kyle couldn&#39;t resist the Erge and he went straight to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
He put the toilet seat up immediately and he started masterbating away. As he was masterbating his erection got longer and harder. Eventually he couldn&#39;t hold his pleasure anymore and he squirted a stream of semen into the toilet. &quot;Wow, my balls can hold more semen than I thought&quot; said Kyle as he wiped the excess semen of the tip of his penis with toilet roll. Then Kyle flushed the semen and and toilet roll down the toilet.<br />
<br />
Kyle left the bathroom and thought that he should start getting ready to go to the magic shop down the road. He went into his parents room and grabbed the same clothes out of his dad&#39;s draw that he wore yesterday, only this time he decided not to mess with his dad&#39;s speedo. He put on the boxers and black shorts first and then put on the dark red shirt with the top two buttons undone to show his some of his chest hair. Finally he slipped his socks on. He quickly grabbed the money from his room and shoved it in his pocket. Then Kyle went downstairs.<br />
<br />
This time he remembered to grab his dad&#39;s trainers and not his. He put on the trainers and walked out the door and started heading to the shop.<br />
<br />
Along the way he saw more women trying to get his attention and since there wasn&#39;t as much on his mind, his sexual drive took over and he went to talk to one of the women. Kyle started smooth talking her as she giggled. The typical conversation of a sexy man talking to a cute young women. After a while she asked him to come to her apartment that was just across the road. Kyle agreed to go with her and they went to this girls house. <br />
<br />
When they got inside she said that her name was Miranda and she was twenty-four, she then asked Kyle his name and age. He said that his name was Kyle and he was twenty-eight. &quot;Yes&quot; miranda muttered under her breath. Kyle asked what she was muttering about but she brushed the question aside. &quot;I guess your not married since you don&#39;t have a ring then&quot; Miranda asked. &quot;Nope&quot; replied Kyle.<br />
<br />
Miranda then gestured at Kyle to follow her so Kyle did just that. She lead Kyle to her bedroom and she kindly asked him to close the door. Kyle did so while thinking ,that something he was really interested to try, was about to happen.<br />
<br />
He turned around to face her and before he had time to react she lent in and started kissing him. She pulled away for a second to say &quot; wow, usually men with beards scratch my face to make kissing a bit more uncomfortable but yours is just so soft that it isn&#39;t uncomftable at all, I love it&quot;. Miranda then leaned back in and stared kissing Kyle again and he didn&#39;t want to stop her.<br />
<br />
After a rather long kissing session, Miranda lent back again and asked &quot;you got condoms&quot;. Kyle said that he didn&#39;t but Miranda then showed him a pack of condoms that was in a locked draw under her desk. &quot;You can go in to the bathroom and prepare in there and I&#39;ll get ready in here. Kyles face went red but he took the pack of condoms and went to the bathroom across the hallway<br />
