<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff could feel his mind unraveling in front of Venus. In just a few hours his diminutive houseplant had evolved into this paragon of power, a beautiful plant-woman whose unconquerable strength was only growing with each dose of the ray, who could uproot trees without even trying and produce flames out of nowhere. A rational part of his mind would have told him to quit while he was ahead, to not let this insanity go on any longer. But a larger, more prevalent part, one that was utterly in love with Venus and her growing abilities, one whose resolve had just been reinforced with her kiss demanded only one thing: MORE!<br />
<br />
Venus giggled as Jeff forced himself from her embrace and began crawling towards the Chronivac. She could sense his adoration, see his cock straining his pants as it struggled closer to her, but he was obviously as much in love with changing her as she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you want fiddle with that thing when I&#39;m right here and available, young man?&quot; She asked teasingly as Jeff picked up the device and started fiddling with it. He smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Venus, I love you. You are perfect and the only one I will devote myself to.&quot; He declared as he cleared the settings.<br />
<br />
&quot;But?&quot; Venus smiles innocently, eagerly awaiting what was to come.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you can be beyond perfect.&quot; Jeff finished, and fired her with the ray.<br />
<br />
A veritable explosion of power echoed from Venus as her already overdeveloped genetics were bathed with further evolution. Her limbs humanized to perfection as soft toes formed on her feet, smooth wooden nails pushing out to crown them and her fingers as her limbs finalized with finishing touches of dense, womanly muscles. Venus fell to her knees as innumerable thin vines burst from her lower back, anchoring her to the ground as her feet sank into the soil and her vines began to spread across the forest.<br />
<br />
&quot;More!&quot; She screamed. &quot;MORE! COMPLETE ME!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff kept his finger on the trigger as Venus ascended in front of his eyes. Her height stayed largely the same, with only few bursts of growth adding to her imposing stature, but as she opened her mouth to scream, thick, bright-green smoke of concentrated pheromones flowed out. Her breasts and pussy joined in as they all started to contribute to the thick pheromone mist forming around Venus. Jeff took a few steps back. He had to keep his distance to not fall victim to her pheromones before she was done.<br />
<br />
Beneath the pheromone cloud Venus bloomed anew, numerous brilliant multicolored flower buds growing across her body, hiding her partly from view. They grew with astounding speed, eager to reveal what lay underneath, and they didn&#39;t have to wait long as Venus now drew nutrients straight from the earth to fuel her evolution, supercharging the results.<br />
Her hips cracked as the flowers bloomed, revealing a child-bearing pelvis more than triple the width of her waist. The package was complete as a pink flowed bloomed on her pussy, revealing a hypnotic, drooling slit that drooled with verdant fertility, inviting all seed to take refuge within its depths, promising greatness from whatever would be born afterwards.<br />
<br />
With a mighty heave her breasts bloomed, the flower stems growing from her nipples wilting to reveal acres of arrogantly firm size sitting proudly upon her chest, defying standard human cup sizes as they swelled to a maximal, supremely womanly size that dominated her torso but refused to steal all attention from the rest of her. As they swelled one last time, her nipples began drooling delicious-smelling honeyed sap that flowed in rivulets across her breasts and body before falling to the ground in a puddle alongside her pussy juices. These new liquids combined and began seeping into the earth, and with an audible rustle grass grew as plantlife bloomed around her.<br />
<br />
The rest of her flower followed suit, blooming to reveal a beyond perfect body with a tapered waist, delicate but strong shoulders, a firm muscled tummy, swaying tree trunk thighs and svelte arms. With a sigh the flowers around her face bloomed, revealing a perfected womanly visage. Plucked, grassy eyebrows, a small and delicate nose, rounded, regal facial features that commanded awe and respect as her glowing eyes opened, reflecting untold power and wisdom within their sparkling green pools. Her vine-like hair unwound from a flowery tangle as a waterfall of dark silk, smelling like a spring meadow as small flowers dotted its length that reached all the way to the ground. As Jeff watched, barely holding on in the presence of this paragon of femininity, the hair grew into the earth and joined her vines as it dug to the soil. As the final flowers along her swan-like neck bloomed, a green, leafy cape grew from Venus, further adding to her regality.<br />
<br />
And as Venus took her first breath as a being beyond perfection, her powers surged as a pinnacle to her evolution. The fire and healing powers she&#39;d gifted herself grew like a tidal wave, a white-hot firestorm erupting as it burned the entire forest to the ground in seconds. Jeff watched on, horrified, as dozens of miles of greenery around him vanished, all the while the flames didn&#39;t even warm him a bit. As soon as it happened, a pulse emanated from her, and Jeff&#39;s jaw dropped as he watched the forest regrowing back at a breakneck speed, Venus&#39; healing power feeding the plant remnants as they followed the will of their new mistress. Grass, trees, flowers, all were resurrected under her whim as the forest was remade in her image. Jeff grunted as a bit of the healing power snuck into him, and he could feel his manhood and balls swelling just a bit. He swore he could feel a small giggle in his mind as it happened. The shock caused him to drop the remote, but what he hadn&#39;t noticed was that the beam had actually shut off by itself a while ago. Venus was already at the peak of her evolution, and her expanding repertoire proved it.<br />
<br />
The river, vaporized by her flames, suddenly sprang back into existence as new wells of water burst from beneath the ground, hydromancy joining Venus&#39; powers. Still on her knees, she concentrated on bringing back rapids twice as intense as before, the river digging a deeper trench for itself under her guidance. Earth and rocks moved out of the way, partly due to the unrelenting power of the water, and partly because Venus willed so, the shards of the rock she&#39;d reduced to rubble earlier flowing around her as hills rumbled, tectonic activity increasing as she forced a new mountain to form, its bald head soon crowned with greenery as her healing pulses spread the forest onto the new land mass. And finally, she started to hover as violent storm winds blew through the forest, scattering newly grown leaves and felling trees as the last of the four primal elements fell under her power. With a wave of her hands, a tornado beyond classification formed and began tearing through the woods, creating variety within the overgrown jungle.<br />
<br />
At last, it was over. Jeff laid panting on the ground, partly from terror and awe. And undeniable arousal as he stared at Venus who finally extended her legs, blessing the ground as she floated back to Jeff.<br />
<br />
She was queenly, undeniably so as she walked, her cape and hair framing the feminine visage none could ever hope to match, her hypnotic eyes capturing his gaze and immediately reading through the story of his life. Her hair and innumerable vines grew into the ground, and beneath his feet he could feel rumbling as she extended her network further and further. She was nude, and her breasts and pussy were still drooling onto the ground, creating new greenery as the lesser plants drank from her abundance, and started evolutions of their own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff.&quot; She whispered. That was too much as her siren song of a voice and a microscopic amount of pheromones her breath was still laced with sent her boyfriend into an immediate coma. She smirked and brought him back to consciousness with a casual flex of her healing power.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Jess. You have done a great thing, both to me and this planet.&quot; She tried again, exercising even more control to make sure he would survive conversing with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you completed my evolution, I have now become what I was destined to be from the moment you first turned that ray towards me.&quot; She smiled, and pointed at the Chronivac now laying on the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;As we speak, my influence over the planet and all its workings is complete. Every plant, every animal, the elements themselves, are under my direct rule, whether they like it or not.&quot; She balled her still pointed hand into a fist, and to prove her words a gigantic oak tree, newly grown besides them, crackled and groaned as it bent of backwards, growing down to rest its trunk along the ground. Venus sat down on it, caressing the treetop that had abandoned its pursuit of the ground to provide a bench for Venus. As Jeff watched, she lazily twirled her finger, and the three grew a loop around her to provide a wooden halo of sorts. He gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... are you like Mother Nature?&quot; He asked carefully. Venus only smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m what Mother Nature wishes she could be. This whole planet it mine to command, From the blazing hot core, to the deepest reaches of the oceans, to the dance of the tectonic plates themselves... all of them happen because I will it. And, of course... it can also STOP.&quot;<br />
<br />
Venus balled her hand into a fist, and Jeff&#39;s entire world rumbled, and he fell down. It took him a moment to understand what had happened. Something primal, something ever-present, had just been tampered with by a casual gesture from his girlfriend. Venus had just stopped the rotation of the Earth.<br />
<br />
With a chuckle she extended her hand and the world breathed a sigh of relief as the rotation continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must truly thank you, my love, for an excellent choice of a name. For now I am well and truly a goddess.&quot; She smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we are going to have so much fun together.&quot;</p>
