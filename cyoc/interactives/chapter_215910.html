<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Um, Erwin think he maybe save Geoffrey.” The kobold replied.<br />
<br />
Erwin didn’t actually care if he was right. All he wanted to do was go back to suckling on that luscious draconic cock he was straddling. Finn smiled, scratching under Erwin&#39;s scaly chin, making the proto-kobold trill happily, the nub at the base of his spine wriggling.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure?” Finn asked, letting out a hiss as the transforming human’s soft hands stroked his length. <br />
<br />
“Yes, Master,” Erwin said. “Can Erwin go back to servicing Master now?”<br />
<br />
Finn chuckled. “Oh, you kobolds! Of course, little one.” <br />
<br />
The dragon gently pressed the kobold back down, enjoying how eager the kobold was to engulf his cock in his tiny maw. He moaned and let out a happy puff of smoke as the kobold started suckling on the tip with gentle pressure. Then he shivered and hissed in delight as Erwin’s tongue slithered into his pisshole. <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-===-==-=-====-<br />
<br />
Charlie was running out of time. <br />
<br />
There was only one person he needed right now, and that was the transforming polar bear. <br />
<br />
He disengaged from the spidery golem and sprinted to the golem. It was stationary while using the gaze attack. Charlie cut deep into the golem’s heavy fabric shroud. The golem buckled, and Charlie gave it a solid kick.<br />
<br />
The golem’s ray shut off and a greatly reduced Geoffrey fell to the floor.<br />
<br />
Geoffrey’s round ears had grown into point, his blunt snout had narrowed into a dainty muzzle, those deep-set eyes now big and sparkling.  The butler’s muscles had greatly reduced, his short white fur was incredibly fluffy, and his previously nub-like tail was now long and poofy.<br />
<br />
His tongue hung out and he panted as another spurt of cum erupted from his cock. He lay on the floor, the changes over, twitching and bucking occasionally.  Geoffrey seemed well on his way to becoming a toy dog and, even if his body wasn’t completely useless yet, his mental state meant that he wouldn’t be of any use for the fight.<br />
<br />
Metallic limbs clacked behind Charlie.<br />
<br />
Charlie whirled, arm raised to block a blow. But Charlie’s soft flesh was no match for hard metal, and the golem knocked his arm aside easily. Charlie tried to react but couldn’t do anything as one of the pincers snatched the wolf up and held him in its metallic grasp. <br />
<br />
Charlie struggled, trying to kick the golem, but his paw bounced off the metal cylinder with a hollow clang. He noticed, then, that the golem’s mouth was open. Something moved inside the darkness. Then, with a suddenness that terrified the wolf, a giant fabric tube erupted out and covered the wolf’s head.<br />
<br />
It was slimy inside the fabric tube, black oil glistening on the walls. There was a whir and suddenly he found himself being sucked into the golem’s tube. The walls squeezed, pressing him deeper through the tube as he felt it retract. Charlie tried to slash the walls as they rippled in movements that resembled swallowing.<br />
<br />
With dawning horror, he realized the golem was eating him.<br />
<br />
He flailed his legs as he went vertical.<br />
<br />
The weird, oil-like fluid lubricated the tube and sent him slipping and sliding down the gullet. With a sound that resembled a slurp, he landed in the damp, oily confines of the golem’s cylinder. There was barely any of that oily substance left, just enough to make the interior slick.<br />
<br />
The oil began to spread out onto his skin, and wherever the oil touched him, his skin started to tingle - not a good sign. <br />
<br />
He quickly felt for the sphincter that he’d slid in, but the top of the chamber had closed tight. With no exit, the wolf ran his paws over the walls and ceilings of the rather small container and found no seams for him to wedge the tip of a dagger in. Charlie panted, the scent of oil cloying and intense, and took shallow breaths. <br />
<br />
Oddly enough, the chamber was completely silent. The battle outside had been intense, and he should be able to hear it, even in here.  Yet the only sounds in the chamber his own breathing and movement. Was this thing soundproofed? <br />
<br />
Charlie banged on the metal walls, but it felt like his paws were hitting solid steel. Which, he was. He tried placing his back on the curved wall and pressing his paws on the other wall and push, but all he managed to do was splash more of that oil on himself. <br />
<br />
Wait, more oil?<br />
<br />
He felt around the bottom of the container. There was now a puddle where before it had merely been a slick. Maybe it was the oil in here, but the wolf couldn’t smell his sweat or musk anymore. His whiskers picked up the oddest sensation of movement, though the golem seemed to have gone quiescent.  <br />
<br />
Charlie felt something sweat trickle down his brow and wiped at it. Instead of sweat, however, the fur on his forehead and muzzle slicked off his body before joining the growing puddle of oil he was sitting in. The wolf’s eyes widened in horror as he realized what was happening.<br />
<br />
His body continued to tingle, mostly where he sat in the oil puddle that was rising as his thick fur sloughed off with wet plops into the oil and dissolving. There was a click and a whir and more oil streamed down over the wolf’s head. He sputtered and coughed, the cloying stuff getting into his mouth.<br />
<br />
The spigot of oil shut off, and then the walls started rotating, agitating the oil and sending the wolf sliding around the cylinder. He clawed at the slick walls to steady himself, and then he was pawing at it as he felt his nails slowly disintegrate. Charlie slid down into the fluid, fully submerged, more oil getting into his mouth.<br />
<br />
He surfaced, hacking. All he could taste was oil. As he spat it out, something white dropped into the oil before slowly dissolving away. Then another and another. Charlie ran his tongue around his mouth, the action loosening the rest of his teeth, sending them plunging into the oily liquid. <br />
<br />
“Pleathe!” Charlie screamed, pounding on the walls with his fists. ”Thomeone! Help!”<br />
<br />
The swirl of oil worked more of into his skin, then began to penetrate into his leather armor. And for how expensive it had been, that armor didn’t last long. A minute later and he found himself sliding around the compartment on naked skin. His body started tingling all over now that he was totally bare.<br />
<br />
His cock was strangely hard as it swirled around the oil, his balls tingling heavily. <br />
<br />
It felt like he was receiving an intensely pleasurable massage. Charlie whimpered, bucking his furless hips The muscles in his butt wriggled as that pleasure grew and grew, but his tail didn’t swish through the liquid. He felt around his backside and realized he had no tail, there was nothing but soft, oddly goopy flesh. <br />
<br />
Charlie struggled to keep his snout above the oil. He couldn’t hold onto the walls any longer, his hands useless stumps, arms slowly dissolving into more of the thick oil. It wasn’t long until all he could do was slosh back and forth in the liquid, as the rhythmic sloshing caused him to grow strangely relaxed. As his torso continued to slosh about in a pool of his former limbs, he felt himself starting to feel tired. <br />
<br />
The tingles of the oil were growing intense all over his body, not just his cock. He was no longer scared, just warm, comfortable and tingling. The tingles in his cock grew ever more intense and then, with a burbling howl, Charlie came. His cock pulsed and pulsed and pulsed and then the feeling of anything down there vanished but the pleasurable tingles roiling through his body didn’t.<br />
<br />
With a pleased gurgle, his head slipped below the oil. His mind was awash with intense tingles as his brain slowly dissolved and then only rich, organic slurry slopped about in the full tank. A few moments later, what was left of Charlie’s remains finished processing as well.<br />
…<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
With a pop of displaced air, a puddle of black oil splashed onto the floor.<br />
<br />
“Gross,” Finn said, flicking a drop of oil off the tip of his snout. “Thought you were smarter than to turn your back on an enemy, Charlie.”<br />
<br />
A few bubbles rose to the top of the puddle and popped.<br />
<br />
The dragon was about to say something else, but Erwin was sliding his increasingly scaly body against his mighty cock. He shuddered and moaned. The almost-kobold was getting better and better at pleasing him. <br />
<br />
“Mike!” Finn bellowed, “Get a mop!”<br />
<br />
“Yes Master!’ The kobold leapt for a closet hidden in the rock wall. <br />
<br />
He wheeled out a mop and bucket and began the arduous task of sopping up Charlie’s remains. Mike filled up four bucketfuls of wolf slurry. Then he wheeled the bucket back into the closet and dumped the remains down the drain, leaving only a black slick on the floor where Charlie had been.<br />
<br />
“Turns out you WERE slick after all, Charlie.” Finn smirked, “Oh well. Guess you should have thought through the situation more, because this is…”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE END<br />
