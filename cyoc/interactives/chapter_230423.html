<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unknown to most people there are a set of laws to time like that of Gravity, the conservation of Mass, or the expending of energy. Time could not be unwound or undone but it could be transferred from one item to another. And so as Jeff created a hole where his mother once was by turning Jamie from his mother to his twin sister, the universe needed something to take up the time that was being stripped from Jamie in exchange and fill the void in the family Jeff and Jamie were creating by this action. As it happened, Jeff already had an older sister, Mackenzie. Mackenzie was a teenager of 18 and an irritating pain as far as Jeff was concerned--too interested to hang out with her friends than be much of a sister. As far as the Chronivac was concerned, she was perfect for taking on the amount of time that Jamie was voluntarily losing and filling the parental void that Jamie had vacated. So, Mackenzie, who had been sleeping in her own room was now growing older, but then was inexplicably transported from her bedroom to her father&#39;s room, which was soon becoming her room as well.<br />
<br />
Mackenzie was already in her late teens, and now she began to age into her early twenties. Since Jamie&#39;s clothes altered when she grew young, Mackenzie&#39;s clothes altered as well. Her more teenage pajamas, transformed into something a woman&#39;s night robe more   All the while Jeff&#39;s Dad, Mike, was blissfully ignorant that his youngest daughter was growing up right next to him in the bed.<br />
<br />
Mackenzie&#39;s body flourished into womanhood as her breast size went from A to DD. Her hair began to shorten now as a few gray hairs appeared on her head, and she gained a little weight. She now looked more like a woman who had three children in her lifetime, rather than a girl ready to graduate high school. She looked down to her left hand, just a beautiful wedding ring appeared on her finger. She  turned around now in her bed to see her husband looking at her and smiling as he became more awake. She suddenly had an urge in her as she batted her eyes now at her husband laying on his side of the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike...&quot; Mackenzie whispered softly in her husband&#39;s ear opening his eyes more, he saw his beautiful wife from the opposite side of the bed, he looked up to his beautiful wife who was showing off her cleavage to her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, you could&#39;ve said something before we went to bed.&quot; Mike said with a smile as he gently caressed her breast and she gave a slight moan.<br />
<br />
They then heard a commotion from Jeff&#39;s room and it sounded like their daughter was making a ruckus as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it, just when I&#39;m in the mood.&quot; Mackenzie said as she fixed her robe clothes and went to Jeff&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jamie was looking around the room for something important as Jeff looked on a little confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Jamie ? What are you doing?&quot; he asked her.<br />
<br />
Jamie was still searching for something as she told him. &quot;Oh, come on, Jeff. I know you have hidden your secret stash. Even if I was your mom, I know you kept it from me. Help me find it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff heard that and remembered what he meant by that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stash? What stash?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie turned to him and gave a coy grin. &quot;Don&#39;t play dumb with me Jeff. I remember you&#39;ve been keeping something from me and your father for a while. Now that we are twin siblings, I can finally get a chance to see what you got. Now help me find it before we get spotted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what if dad catches us? We could get into a lot of trouble.&quot; Jeff retorted<br />
<br />
&quot;Please...&quot; Jamie assured him, &quot;Dad is busy working in the living room with our older sister. He won&#39;t bother us anytime soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking under the bed, she could see a small box under the bed and smiled. &quot;Jackpot!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she got on her knees and pulled the box under the bed. Looking to see it, she smirked and said, &quot;So... This is the stash you&#39;ve been hiding from me. Hmm... Wonder what&#39;s inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie quickly opened the box and was about to see the contents while Jeff was getting a little concerned. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door and it started the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit! It&#39;s dad! Hide it quick!&quot; Jeff demanded as Jamie nodded and quickly pushed the box back into the bed. Standing up, the two looked to the door, fearing dad would come in.<br />
<br />
The door started to open and they were expecting the pissed off look for their father. But as the door opened fully, they see a completely different person, a female of 43, wearing a pink night gown covering her middle age, but still making her look gorgeous.<br />
<br />
The siblings were a little shocked at the site of her as the woman crossed her arms and said, &quot;Kids! What in blazes are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff and Jamie blinked and wondered who this woman is. Suddenly, their memories were altering and realized who it is. It&#39;s Jeff&#39;s sister and Jamie&#39;s oldest daughter, Mackenzie. But now they consider her as a...<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom????&quot;<br />
<br />
Mackenzie tilt her head in confusion and said, &quot;Yes. That&#39;s me. You own mother. Now what are you both doing in here? Better not be anything appropriate.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two looked to each other and had to do something before they get suspicious. Looking back to him, they said, &quot;We... We were doing a little rough housing. Yeah! That&#39;s right! Just a little play fighting. Right Jamie?&quot; Jeff said turning to his twin sister.<br />
<br />
Mike turned to Jeff and nodded quickly, &quot;Yeah! That&#39;s what we were doing. Just two siblings getting a little rowdy is all. Nothing too weird or anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mackenzie looked to the two and rubbed the temples of her head. Knowing these two are at the age of being trouble makers, she sighed and said, &quot;Kids... I understand you have having fun. But you two are growing up. Sixteen is a serious year for you two. Soon enough, you both would think about your future. You can&#39;t be teens together, right. Just be on your best behavior, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
The twins looked to each other and was surprised that Mackenzie believed in their lies. But knowing how annoyed she was, they need to be on their best behavior, or they will be grounded. So feeling defeated, they both turn to their dad and said in unison. &quot;Yes, mom...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mackenzie smiled and said to them. &quot;Good. Now be nice to each other. It was a long day for me yesterday and I need my rest. Don&#39;t disturb me or your father.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he closed the door and was returning to the master bedroom. As she left, the two blinked their eyes and was a little confused. &quot;Was... Was that Mackenzie? My older sister?&quot; Jeff asked still completely unsure of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. It was.&quot; Jamie answered and was confused. &quot;But now she is our own mom. How did that happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was trying to process what occured until he turned to his computer where the Chronivac was still on. Turning to it, he checked to see what happened and was surprised by what he was reading. &quot;Oh shit! I think I know why Mackenzie became our mom. Check this out!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie heard that and approached Jeff&#39;s side to see what he found. That&#39;s when they see a message that reads.<br />

Looking to the info, the two knew what it meant. &quot;Back up. You&#39;re saying that the Chronivac not only made me into your twin sister.&quot; Jamie started<br />
<br />
&quot;The same happened when the program find a replacement with Mackenzie and she&#39;s the mother now. Man, I know the Chronivac is powerful, but didn&#39;t think it could fill the hole you vacated.&quot; Jeff finished<br />
<br />
Jamie rubbed the back of her head and was amazed at what she is experiencing. &quot;So my oldest daughter is now my mom. This is going to take some getting use to.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff nodded and finished with, &quot;Yeah... It does...&quot;</p>
