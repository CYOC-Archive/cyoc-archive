<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The witch was now riding on Damon&#39;s back through the backstreets. She knew that if she hadn&#39;t magically taken control of him for the moment, he&#39;d be bucking and braying and trying to run away. But she could make her pets as docile as she wanted to, whenever she wanted to, for as long as she wanted to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before we go back to my house, I say we&#39;d better stop by your friend&#39;s house a few blocks away,&quot; said the witch to Damon, knowing he was barely aware of her and powerless to respond. &quot;I can sense my magic starting to flare up over there, and from the feel of things, I&#39;m going to have a much more elegant mount than yourself before much longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
A series of loud neighs was ringing out from a cheap motel room in a part of town the locals nicknamed Heroine Heights. Like Damon, Chris was becoming an equine, but unlike Damon, Chris was having the time of his life. He didn&#39;t really know he got the two-foot cock he was playing with, and he didn&#39;t care. He hadn&#39;t been expecting that penis enlargement cream he&#39;d bought to actually work, much less so well or so quickly! Sure, he thought it looked a little gross on him at first, but when he saw how big it was he just had to find out how much fun he could have with it. It had taken some time to get the whole thing erect: for a while, it just sort of dangled out if his new sheath at full length. He&#39;d been a little freaked out that it was so long, so flat-ended, and so inconsistently colored (jet-black for the first half and light pink beyond that), but it gave him plenty of surface flesh to pleasure himself with. Now it was a rock-hard pipe with the glans flared out into almost a bell shape and two hands sweeping up and down it and teasing the bumpy ridge of flesh in the middle. Chris&#39;s eyes were rolling back in his head as he got even closer to an orgasm no human was meant to have.<br />
<br />
Chris&#39;s pleasure exploded as thick spurts of cum shot out onto the motel door with reckless abandon. It was thick and chunky, way different than any load Chris had unleashed in the past, but feeling that warm surge course through every inch of his monster was literally breathtaking. It was so intense that the bottom of his spine started twitching in time with his pulses! Chris felt like so much of a man right now that he didn&#39;t think or notice that none of this would have fit inside a woman. When it was over, he was left panting and holding onto a massive member that was drooping over his bed with the wide flare hanging down dripping semen onto the floor. It was then that the door flung open and a woman and a donkey stepped in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad someone&#39;s getting some enjoyment out of what I gave them,&quot; said the witch. Chris flailed and squirmed on the bed freaking out that he was interrupted in his private moment by the woman he&#39;d robbed with is friends. &quot;Wh-what do you mean?&quot; he stammered, his hose-like cock flopping around and only very slowly inching back down into his sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, the curse? From before? The changes your going through?&quot; she tried to clarify. Chris gawked at her blankly still trying to figure out how and why she was here and why she was bringing a donkey to his room. &quot;Did you even look at your legs yet?&quot; she asked patronizingly. Chris, who had been focusing all of his attentions on his &quot;third leg&quot;, finally looked down to his feet on the floor. He did a double-take, finally noticing the round, broad hooves and the brown-furred appendages above him. His legs didn&#39;t look all that much than the donkeys, except a longer and less stocky. His lower back somehow twitched again, and he felt something hairy sweeping over the surface of his blankets. Turning to look back, he was not prepared to see a hairy black horse tail swishing behind him on the bed. He jumped up off the bed and nearly tumbled over from atop his altered legs before he realized that it was attached to him and not some sort of unspeakable rodent pest. Grabbing it from behind him and wrapping it loosely around his waist, he was confused to feel a big section of his own spine getting bend around inside it. The hairs were long and silky in his grasp. &quot;What IS this?&quot; he asked the witch.<br />
<br />
The witch rolled her eyes. &quot;I guess I can&#39;t expect a trio young thugs be the brightest bulbs in the chandelier, can I?&quot; she commented into Damon&#39;s long donkey ear. Chris&#39;s chest started barreling out and his hands started seizing up as the changes continued. More brown fur kept growing over him, and his pumping heart got louder and more powerful as he grew, and more frantic as he saw his fingers fusing and his combined fingernail growing out into a cup shape. He was left standing on four hoofed legs when his neck lengthened and his face pushed forward, with thicker lips and a white stripe of fur growing in on his new horse face. His ears perked up and grew pointed but not as long as Damon&#39;s. His mane was jet black and hung down between his eyes. He whinnied again and bulked up to tower over Damon as the changes completed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now, aren&#39;t you a fine stallion?&quot; said the witch. &quot;Much more elegant than your friend here, but you&#39;ll both be a perfect fit for my stable back home. How about we go see how your other friend is coming along? My little farm is having just the most marvelous expansion in years.&quot; She snapped her fingers, putting Chris into the same trance as Damon. She really didn&#39;t want to be in a tiny motel room with a bucking stallion if he freaked out.</p>
