<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty looking down from his cozy dimension thought &quot;You know I could use some opinions while making heaven.&quot; and with an exertion of will the police in front of Dustin vanished leaving their uniforms behind. Dustin looked around thankful there wasn&#39;t really anyone else around now and dashed off somewhere. Meanwhile at beach resort mansion of Ty&#39;s heaven the two cops popped into existence in the shallows of the warm waters clothed in swim trunks and Hawaiian shirts. The cops were spooked from the teleportation, but looking around they seemed to be safe... and there was just one kid lounging on a beach towel. <br />
<br />
The older cop Joe reacted first by saying &quot;Hey kid! Where are we?&quot;<br />
Ty leaned up and said &quot;Hi, you&#39;re in heaven.&quot; <br />
both cops eyes went wide as the younger one Steve panicked heavily rambling &quot;What? Why can&#39;t I remember why I died then?!? I had so much I wanted to do! what about those I love I-&quot; <br />
Ty said &quot;Hey, calm down you didn&#39;t die. Just brought you to heaven that much earlier. By the way I&#39;m god, my name&#39;s Ty.&quot; <br />
Joe said &quot;Hey, we were just doing our job. Can you just bring us back and we&#39;ll let Dustin go?&quot;<br />
Ty said &quot;Probably could, but here&#39;s the thing. I&#39;m trying to set up heaven and need some let&#39;s say beta testers. I&#39;ll grant you wishes on Earth along with being here in Heaven.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Stew said &quot;Just get me back so I can get back to work.&quot; <br />
Joe thought and said &quot;Sure I&#39;ll take one of those wishes as. I&#39;d like to be back home.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty thought of a loophole, and expanded heaven for a bit with essentially two simulation chambers and threw Stew and Joe in them. Inside the two were placed in exact replicas of the Earth and allowed to live their normal lives. Turns out they&#39;d only live about ten years as Stew ended up dying of a heart attack, and Joe died pursuing a criminal. Regardless after their simulated lives they were brought back to Ty&#39;s beach a few seconds after they left. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Heaven again, so now if we&#39;ve gotten living out of the way can we get down to business with this Beta testing heaven thing?&quot; Ty said impatiently. <br />
Joe asked &quot;Umm... Well hi God, but umm... did he get away?&quot; <br />
Ty shook his head and said &quot;No, he didn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
Joe looked relieved and said &quot;Hi Stew, it&#39;s been awhile... Well I guess we&#39;re dead dead now.&quot; <br />
Stew said &quot;Bullshit, you couldn&#39;t have just waited.&quot; <br />
Joe looked to Stew and asked &quot;What are you talking about Stew? Either he&#39;s god and can do weird time manipulation shit or he&#39;s not powerful enough to recreate the world or something.&quot; <br />
Stew gave Ty a look at which point Ty shrugged his shoulders and said &quot;Yeah, I through you both into your own individual simulations. It&#39;s only been about a second or so.&quot; <br />
Joe said &quot;But my wife was just... all the little kids and our daughter...&quot; <br />
Ty said &quot;Well I&#39;ve got some good news about your daughter. As she was created here in heaven.&quot; Ty snapped her fingers and a small girl with long chestnut hair, and intelligent blue eyes appeared next to her. Joe looked happy to see his daughter doing well, but was very conflicted about his 5 year old daughter being in Heaven and the fact that she may have not actually existed. Ty said &quot;I mean... she&#39;s real. Just as real as anyone else on earth. She&#39;s got all the organs and squishy bits.&quot; <br />
Joe said &quot;Well then my love Julia... She exists both in that simulation but on Earth so how do-&quot;<br />
Ty said &quot;I&#39;m having you two as a beta test for Heaven right now. Everyone whose dying before I make the rules blatant and everyone in the simulations are just being held in a limbo nothingness state until I officially open up the afterlife. If you want I can give you simulation Julia or potentially rapture current earth Julia.&quot; <br />
Joe said &quot;Let me think about tha-&quot; <br />
The little girl looked to her father and asked &quot;I don&#39;t get what this Mr. is saying daddy.&quot;<br />
Joe said &quot;Can we just get started on testing out heaven and getting the kinks out?&quot; <br />
Ty said &quot;Sure, So here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking. We have a bunch of comfortable resort areas based on places on earth, and when you die you appear at one of the resorts. Then you have the option to chill with the other recently dead, find people who died before you and reconnect, or just start making your own personalized space in heaven. To do all this you will be given access to a personal angel who has some amount of my power, but has orders not to do a bunch of things I&#39;d rather you not do... such as try to steal my power or something like that.&quot;<br />
Stew asked &quot;So how do we summon them? Do we just think about them?&quot; <br />
Ty nodded and said &quot;Just think about them and then ask for something. If they can provide they&#39;ll provide. Want to appear as yourself when you were a young man, or a kid. Go ahead.&quot; A little cherub appeared next to the little girl. <br />
The little girl asked &quot;Oh Mr. Can you make me into a woman like mommy?&quot; The cherub didn&#39;t say anything but the little girl and the dress she was in grew up into a cute thin woman. Joe looked at Ty filled with questions but unsure about how to ask them. <br />
Ty said &quot;It&#39;s her heaven as well. She has access to the same things you do.&quot; <br />
Joe asked &quot;Can we have some parental guidance then? Maybe have her ask me to do these things?&quot; <br />
Ty asked &quot;And what if the kid dies before their parents?&quot; <br />
Joe said &quot;Couldn&#39;t you just put them in that odd purgatory state until...&quot;<br />
Ty said &quot;I&#39;ll admit I didn&#39;t think about children in this example... Then again I&#39;m not entirely sure how I should go about teaching kids or what education system I should emulate.&quot;<br />
&quot;You are god, Can&#39;t you just will the best information is put into their heads?&quot; <br />
&quot;What do you mean best? Besides that if they want to learn they can learn on their own. The more important part would be moral values which... Hm... That&#39;s an interesting question. If there is objective morality I suppose I would be the authority to make it. So what should my objective morality be?&quot;<br />
Stew said &quot;Should you really be... Well I guess you are god, but if you are unsure what morality should be then shouldn&#39;t you default to subjective morality?&quot;<br />
Ty thought for a second and say &quot;You know I&#39;ve got a decent idea. I&#39;ll put in my holy scriptures all sorts of &quot;objective morals&quot; that any sane person could pick apart, and if they completely believe in it then I could separate those nutters and try some reeducation of sorts. Great brainstorming... That said feel free to enjoy heaven and let me know if there&#39;s any glitches or anything I should work on. I gotta pay more attention to Dustin right now.&quot; <br />
<br />
Joe&#39;s daughter said &quot;Come on daddy! How about we go make a sandcastle and go swimming after?!?&quot; There was a lot on Joe&#39;s mind but he decided that he shouldn&#39;t give himself a heart attack in heaven. This was his daughter after all and it would be nice to spend some time with her. <br />
<br />
Stew however decided to hit the beach bar and enjoy all of the best liquor he could never afford. For sure his personal bartender waitress was a good looker and made the best drinks.</p>
