<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcia excused herself and walked thinking down to her car. &quot;I can't just drive up the front of Mrs. Ranskin's home and ask if I might interview her prize stallion. This might need some sneaking about at dusk, Gee I hope she doesn't have some big dogs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcia returned to her Motel and changed into some black slacks and a dark sweatshirt with a hood. Sitting in her room she tried to think of simple yes, or no questions a pony could answer with ease.<br />
<br />
About 6:00 p.m. a knock at her room's door. As she looked out a young Policeman stood looking anxious. &quot;Yes, is there a problem?&quot; asked Marcia as she opened the door.<br />
<br />
Clearing his throat the young man spoke, &quot;I overheard the Chief talking about what you investigate and I'm here to help, if I may?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcia looked at him, slender but well built. &quot;Do you know where I'm going tonight?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, your checking out Ely's story at the ladies damn farm!&quot; replied the man.<br />
<br />
Marcia thought for a moment, &quot;Ely's story, did you know him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May I come in please?&quot; as he stepped inside I offered him a chair and the two of us sat down to talk. &quot;Yes, Ely Kazan and I went through school together, he was a Junior like me when he up and disappeared. He told me stories about silly girls from school that went to have sex orgies at the farm on weekends. He said that or classmates Lucy Brown and Jennifer Simpleton were out there one night. He stayed to check, well to watch and wish he could do with them as Ranskin did. It was after that night he told me of what went on and the very next day he vanished. I've talked with Mister Robertson at his room in the hospital. He knows even very personal details of exploits he and I had together during school days. I'm very satisfied that the man in the room is Ely Kazan, and if so then that farm must be a devils den and your going to need help!&quot; the young man explained, and quite well too!<br />
<br />
&quot;I have also talked with Ely, ahh Mister Robertson. My next interview was with of all things a Sumawa pony stallion! I'm making up questions for the animal to make a simple yes or no since I'm told he can't talk. While I'm doing that, I might need some distraction so the lady won't notice me and the pony, got any Idea's?&quot; I asked cocking my head as if to wonder.<br />
<br />
He sat there looking out the window, &quot;Yea I know just what to do!&quot;<br />
<br />
I should have asked, looking back with 20/20 hindsight. I needed time to find the stallion, approach him, confide in him my friendly intentions, and then ask hours of deep questions, were we ready?<br />
<br />
He left and I readied myself more for a long and chilly night.<br />
<br />
9:20 p.m. Tuesday <br />
<br />
The young man showed up in his normal dress uniform of the Cooper City Police department. I stood looking at him sitting out in his Police cruiser number 13, of all the one's he might pick. Quickly I gathered up the papers and clipboard and was out and jumping in the police car.<br />
<br />
At the entrance to the farm's drive we coasted in, lights off and looked the scene over. Out in the pasture grazed a large Dun colored horse which I figured was the stallion in question. He was alone and seemed accessible. Jumping out of the cruiser one quick duck under and I was walking the pasture down wind to the animal.<br />
<br />
The Police car started again and drove with headlights on to the front of the farm dwelling. As I quickly walked along my head faced the house and watched as the young Policeman got out of his car and knocked on the lady's front door. Almost tripping as I looked backwards the Lady seemed upset but ushered the Policeman inside the house.<br />
<br />
At last I approached the stallion who as yet was unaware of my approach. Looking to one side I saw a place in the barbed fence that one could bale over in case things got rough. I said softly, &quot;Chuck, Chuck Robinson!&quot;<br />
<br />
The pony stallion's head jumped alert and looked right at me. Standing on alert but very still I tried to contact the man's mind again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Marcia Caldwell, please can we talk about what you are and how this came about?&quot; I asked softly.<br />
<br />
A soft snort and he turned calmly to walk closer to me. My heart went wild and sweat poured out of my skin. I wondered if he would rush me or just what might happen?<br />
<br />
I stood very still as the fine formed beast stepped to within inches of me. &quot;Are you friendly toward me?&quot; I asked, voice shaking as I looked at this large for a pony animal.<br />
<br />
He looked me in the eye and then suddenly dipping his head he pressed his nostrils into my crotch and drew a deep breathe. I shivered at his touch while he got a quickfall erection. He reached and did it again but this time his lips pursed my mound, which made me shiver again.<br />
<br />
As if satisfied, his forelegs crumpled down and his hind quarters fell with a thud. Odd I thought to see a grown stallion laying on the ground with his penis fully erect.<br />
<br />
Kneeling down, I asked, &quot;How is it being a stallion?&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know to this day but it must have been his old investigator self which had a quick reply. In a second he rolled onto his back, legs in the air he thrust his shaft in the air. A few rocking moves and shot after shot of pony semen launched into the night air. As his last bit of load spewed forth he rolled my way. I watched like a wild baseball about to hit you in the face, the load came for me.<br />
<br />
Splat, it hit with a warm salty flavor. I must of had my mouth open at that moment. I turned to wipe my face and found a mouthful of conjealing semen. I swinshed it about ready to spit but for some silly reason I sat down and chewed it like gum. The pony wickkered softly and seemed pleased at my actions. A swallow or two and with my breath tainted of his seeds the interview began.</p>
