<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Following her exile from the ranks of the California Witches&#39; Society, the witch Sandra Messner was left without most of her resources, no familiars, no fellows (she had been widely disliked even before her exile), and most importantly - no sanctioned subjects for her spells. She was one of the younger and more ambitious witches, prone to acting out and every bit as vain as she was gifted. And for all that she was disliked, most could agree - she was quite gifted for such an inexperienced Witch.<br />
<br />
Thus when she returned home to Castle Brook, home of Sunnyvale College and its famous football team, she got an idea one day when she heard some of the jocks, including her ex-boyfriend Matthew Brooks, bragging about their sexual experiences. She hadn&#39;t exactly separated from Matthew on the best of terms, though she could admit she still found him quite attractive.<br />
<br />
He was a tall, rippling offensive lineman with a very nice tan, 230 lbs of...mostly muscle, though he was slightly tubby at the midsection. He had black hair, hazel colored eyes, and a winning smile. He was however not exactly the best person under all the muscle, attractive features, and such. Overly macho, homophobic, crude, a cheater, never exactly faithful besides, and viewed sex as a game he either won or lost. She still remembered him feebly protesting when she went as far as teasing his asshole during sex. &quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m no homo...!&quot;<br />
<br />
That remark, plus some of the less than &quot;PC&quot; remarks led Sandra to decide she could use some entertainment.<br />
<br />
The jocks weren&#39;t the only people to use 20 Fitness, the local gym.<br />
<br />
It was a sprawling, two story location with a breezy and slightly night-club like vibe when one went late enough. The place blared music that was almost impressively profane, even to Sandra&#39;s ears - though they mostly played that sordid material at night. All the best stuff there happened at night. There were a number of bodybuilders who frequented the place too, even some of the nerds and social outcasts from the college tried to improve their chances with the female population - a plan that rarely worked, though when Sandra felt like making Matt jealous she&#39;d remark on a particular nerd&#39;s attractiveness increasing.<br />
<br />
There was a sauna and swimming pool right next to each other, just across from the locker room on the first floor. The second floor included a basketball court in one corner, and a tanning location in another for those who wanted to get their tans in order for any competition. The weights were extensive, varied, and catered to a fitness oriented clientele.<br />
<br />
The personal trainers were stunningly attractive men and women - chosen to make fitness and getting serious about it attractive. It also didn&#39;t hurt that Bradley Channing, the lead personal trainer, was their highest earner particularly among women. As far as Sandra was concerned, that bodybuilding Adonis made even Matt look small.<br />
<br />
But she wasn&#39;t thinking of it in terms of making things stay the same, oh no. She was brewing up a curse to enhance her own interest in the place. She was particularly good at placing rules on her curses, rather than having them lash out randomly.<br />
<br />
So hence, her curse as she laid it out on the gym was as follows;<br />
<br />
1) Every young man who attends the gym will, over the course of two weeks, undergo a gradual change. It will be fitted to that young man based on their personality, desires, and fitness goals, among other things, turning for example a young man bent on gaining weight into a stocky, more powerfully built man. By the end of those two weeks, the transformation would be complete and the individual would be gay as the day is long.<br />
2) The sexuality shift inherent in the transformation would have a designated middle ground point - by day six or seven, the individual would be bisexual. It would also only occur on someone who identified as straight.<br />
3) The changes only continue as long as someone goes to the gym. No more, no less. Every day they go counts as one day toward the change, regardless how many days they take off between days.<br />
4) Most young men would be oblivious toward the changes (certain intelligent and perceptive men *might* be able to tell) , which would gradually come to &quot;adapt&quot; their lives to the new situation they found themselves in toward the end of the two weeks. Fundamentally, a reality shift to smooth over any drastic changes.<br />
5) As the transformation goes on, the libido of the change subjects enhances and grows stronger.<br />
6) Whatever happened, the changing subjects would stay human.<br />
<br />
Thus was the curse Sandra put on the gym, the most popular destination for the college&#39;s young men. She was unreasonably excited to see her desires catered to. She had something of a fetish of sorts. Matthew liked seeing girls make out? Well, what&#39;s good for the goose is good for the gander - Sandra liked seeing hot guys making out. And she suspected she would be able to see a lot of that going forward...<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Neil Booth supposed this was going to be another of those days at 20 Fitness. He had no idea about the curse put on the gym just that day by a vindictive, bored and horny witch, he was just concerned with the fact once again the jocks here were making things difficult for him and those like him. Neil was all of six foot one, and a scrawny scarecrow of a boy. He yearned to be as buff or more so than the athletes who picked on him in school and out of it, but it seemed his body didn&#39;t really respond to that so far. His blond hair was disheveled and disorderly, and his features were angular, gaunt, and technically boyishly handsome, though far too thin. He was this day dressed in a green tank top and gray shorts, wearing trainer shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haah, you&#39;d think Matt would calm down outside of school...nope, he&#39;s still a bigoted dipshit.&quot; Neil whispered to himself. Matt seemed to absolutely enjoy the line of taunting about sexuality. Neil was straight as could be, but as far as Matt was concerned, he was &quot;flaming looking&quot;. Even though Neil gave no indication of any attraction to guys. Maybe it was just that bullying was completely senseless and more about control and power than anything else.<br />
<br />
As Neil tried to get his bench press done, just a few stations down, Matthew and a couple of his friends were ALSO doing some bench press.<br />
<br />
Matt as usual was making 275 lbs look absolutely effortless - if there was anything Neil could tell Matt loved, it was when his lifts made other people look less impressive by comparison. A consummate bully in every sense. Next to Matt, waiting for his turn, was the larger and more blatantly roided up Brock Medina, a bruiser who, if you knew what was good for you, you stayed out of the way of.<br />
<br />
Brock apparently used to be a slender preppy boy from a wealthy family. But then when he was in high school, he wanted to do football. And suddenly dad&#39;s money didn&#39;t get him as far. But then he found a way to still buy his way in - steroids. As a result, Brock thickened up drastically, and as of now was an exceedingly angry guy - apparently he struggled a bit with that. While it was pretty common to joke about him being &quot;A Hulk&quot;, Brock apparently hated the joke due to it insinuating he was out of control. At any rate, the guy was a bundle of issues - not the least of which was how much older the steroids made him look. Some said the 21 year old looked more like a 30 year old...<br />
<br />
Also over with them was Lucas Peyton, who was really more into bodybuilding than sports, but hanged around with the bully group nonetheless. He shaved his head completely bald, on top of extensively manscaping. Lucas was a pushy elitist who quite openly sneered at people who weren&#39;t as developed as him and his friends. Neil did remember hearing a story about how apparently Lucas used to be a smaller boy, but got like...well, like this in order to make sure others didn&#39;t go after him. There was a black bodybuilder here who it seemed Lucas really admired.<br />
<br />
Last of the group was their &quot;minder&quot; Caleb Malborne, a guy from an English family who moved over. Caleb was darker haired, blue eyed, and he seemed to be appointed by someone, somewhere, to make sure the others didn&#39;t go too far with their bullying. Caleb was somewhat more stocky than the others, playing the role of a linebacker. He loved to party, drink, and eat, and outside his association with the other guys was supposedly pretty relaxed. Neil however wasn&#39;t willing to chance it.<br />
<br />
Yet as Neil tried to go about his workout that day he noticed a woman entering. His eyes almost bugged out of his head when he saw how attractive she was. He shifted his position on the bench just in case he sprung a boner due to her tight athletic top, tight yoga pants, and beautiful face. She seemed assured, calm and confident...and moving right on over to Matt and co.<br />
<br />
Neil found himself listening in despite himself...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hitting the gym hard today, mm, Matt?&quot; She said, tilting her head and cupping her chin, &quot;You&#39;re looking sweltering today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt chuckled, nodded and said, &quot;What? You wanna get back together now? Even after you said all that stuff about me? Called me a &quot;petty bully who pushes people around&quot;...kinda hurtful, honestly. I&#39;m hurt, Sandra. Honestly.&quot; The way he was chuckling under his breath demonstrated one thing - he really wasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
And Sandra for her part seemed to have some idea in mind. She seemed too cool, too calm, even as Brock and Lucas got up, observing the situation. &quot;Ohh Matty-Matt, please...if I hurt anything, at least let me make it better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt grinned lasciviously, &quot;Oh, I think I know how you can make everything better. You. Me. The diner tomorrow. And then we can go to my place for some fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
She seemed to like that, though Neil wondered about that strange mischievous glint in her eye, &quot;I...think I&#39;d like that, Matthew. I&#39;ll see you then.&quot; And as she started walking out from there, Neil found himself getting up, curious and drawn to her. He left his bag on the bench press machine and made like he was going to get water.<br />
<br />
Something about her drew him in though. Something in her manner, her strangely mischief-driven persona, the way she seemed to know something those guys didn&#39;t know. And <i>God</i>, she was so beautiful. It was a sort of uncanny beauty, almost too much - an unearthly sort that left him feeling bewitched. He was unaware entirely as his body seemed to respond to his need - his pectorals pumping up a little, shoulders slightly broadening and his back correspondingly growing a little wider. Not much of a change, but it was something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; He said, not sure what else he even could say.<br />
<br />
She turned and looked at him, a grin on her face. She was evaluating him, looking at him in a certain way. He...he was at least somewhat sure it was flirtation. It had to be. The way she was examining him like a slice of meat. Some sort of flirtation! &quot;Hey yourself,&quot; she said, &quot;I...think you&#39;ll grow into a pretty impressive guy. What&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
A blush hit his face. She was sure he was going to grow! She was impressed it seemed! By <i>Neil!</i><br />
<br />
&quot;I uhhh...I&#39;m uh, I&#39;m Neil, Neil Boone.&quot; He rubbed the back of his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Sandra Messner. Glad to meet you, Neil. Maybe tomorrow I could see you again. In fact, I look forward to it.&quot; And with that, Sandra left a confused and slightly aroused Neil standing there with his mouth hanging open. Gawking like a boy indeed. Neil couldn&#39;t help himself. He&#39;d never known a woman to show such interest - and in him no less! Though he had no idea what her and her presence there meant. Or indeed what sort of changes might be visited on him and the other guys there...</p>
