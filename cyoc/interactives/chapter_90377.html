<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They spent quite some time walking. After about 15 minutes they were starting to relax a bit. After all, it is kind of hard to stay vigilant for monsters when your boyfriend or girlfriend it&#39;s naked with you. That didn&#39;t stop John though, &quot;I hear something,&quot; he whispered loudly. He and Abbey crept around the corner, John with his sword ready too strike, Abbey ready to cast spells. They could see the giant beasts shadow on the wall in the flickering torchlight as the silently crept towards it. John signaled Abbey to jump out on three, then slowly counted with his hand. One finger, two fingers, when John held up the third one, several things happened at once, the first of which was John charged the creature. This was followed quickly by Abbey jumping out to file him, then tackling him to the ground. Finally, the small puppy that was the creature let out a yip and leaped towards John. When all was said and done, the result was Abbey, face down on John, with a small nip from the puppy, and a puppy on it&#39;s back a few feet away next to John&#39;s sword. &quot;Eep!&quot; Yelped Abbey as she rolled off of John. &quot;You jumped on me this time.&quot; He said in response to her shriek, &quot;and what was up with you doing that in the first place?&quot; &quot;It was just a puppy,&quot; resolved Abbey, &quot;I couldn&#39;t let you hurt it.&quot; &quot;Well, you got bit because of it,&quot; grumbled John, &quot;you ok?&quot; He asked as he offered a hand to pull her up, &quot;yea, I&#39;m fine, what about the puppy though?&quot; They both turned to look at the puppy, only to notice it was getting bigger. Before there eyes, the puppy transformed from a small dog, to a kid about their age. As they sat there in shock, the kid rushed up to them. &quot;I&#39;m terribly sorry, thank you so much, but I&#39;m so sorry. I&#39;m confused why your naked but no matter, again I&#39;m terribly sorry.&quot; At that, Abbey just blinked dumbfounded. The kid then turned to John, &quot;and you, you&#39;d deserve it, jumping out and attacking people out of the blue, not her, I&#39;m terribly sorry miss. Anyway, I must go, best of luck to you in coping miss.&quot; At that the kid turned the corner and hurried off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, what just happened?&quot; Abbey asked. &quot;I have absolutely no clue,&quot; replied John. &quot;Let&#39;s go before Steve throws more weird stuff at us.&quot; As they walked, Abbey started to lag behind. &quot;Are you ok?&quot; John asked as he waited for her once again. &quot;We can take a break if you need to.&quot; &quot;Thanks&quot; said Abbey, plopping down. &quot;I feel kind of sick, but it&#39;s not really like being sick, it&#39;s more like being tired, but it&#39;s definitely not that. Regardless, I can&#39;t think straight..&quot; &quot;I can tell,&quot; said John, distracted by Abbey&#39;s forgetfulness when it came to covering herself. Tearing his eyes away, he sat down. &quot;Well, we can rest here until your feeling better.&quot; He told her. Abbey, for her past, just closed her eyes and tried to get comfortable. As Abbey squirmed and readjusted, she ended up with her head draped across John&#39;s lap. He tried to push her off without moving the hand he was using to cover himself, only to have Abbey roll completely onto his chest and curl up. Her positioning restricted his breathing, but he couldn&#39;t get her off. As she lay on him, he pondered really what a small girl she is. When standing up she managed to be about his height, but here she was curled up on his stomach. This was really probably Steve&#39;s doing somehow though. After a time, Abbey started whimpering. &quot;Are you ok Abbey?&quot; John asked, worried, &quot;Abbey!&quot; No matter what he did though she wouldn&#39;t wake up. Though he could barely reach it, he started rubbing her back in an attempt to calm her down. It seemed to work, as the whimpering stopped. John then tried to move again, and to his surprise, not only could he move, but he pushed Abbey clean off of him. Scanning over to her, he found her only about the size of a large cat! &quot;How did I miss that !?&quot; John wondered. At this point John started to get default worried about Abbey and started shaking her, &quot;Abbey, you have to wake up!&quot; He yelled, but to avail. All that he accomplished was making her resume that horrid whimpering whenever he stopped rubbing her back. John helplessly held Abbey in his arms as she got smaller and smaller. At some point she begin to grow fur and sprout a tail. Her ears changed shape and moved. John couldn&#39;t see her face, but he knew with an awful certainty that she was turning into a dog, a black lab puppy by the looks of it. Eventually John feel asleep with Abbey in his arms.<br />
<br />
Abbey woke up somewhere warm. It was very warm. She relaxed and naked in the sensation of warmth. Or at least she did into she remembered where she had been when she fell asleep. Struggling, Abbey got out of her warm prison and rolled to the floor. She immediately tried to stand up, only to find that she couldn&#39;t. She looked around panic until she spotted a paw, more specifically, her paw. It took her a few seconds to comprehend the information. And then, she got to work. It wasn&#39;t that hard to learn to stand on for legs, walking was another story. Abbey took one step and feel in a tangled mess of legs. &quot;Standing will have to do&quot; she reasoned. Taking stock of her environment, Abbey found that it was the same place, just bigger. More importantly, that big warm thing next to her was John. With her best bark (which was more of a squeak at the start) she yapped at John until he woke up.<br />
<br />
John woke up to an awful racket, a small dog was barking incessantly at him. Groaning, he opened his eyes, only to remember where he was, and what had just happened. Turning to the dog, John looked at it and asked, &quot;Abbey?&quot; The dog nodded. &quot;Are you ok?&quot; The puppy looked kind of like it tried to shrug, then have up and nodded. &quot;I&#39;m so glad.&quot; Said John, &quot;I was really worried when you started shrinking.&quot; The say the for an uncomfortable moment, John with nothing to say, and Abbey unable. &quot;Umm, can I... Can I pet you?&quot; John asked. Abbey paused for a second to think, then nodded. John reached down carefully and stroked his girlfriend&#39;s back. &quot;Well, ummm, we should go I guess.&quot; John said as he stood up. He looked down and saw Abbey shaking her heading. &quot;Wait, we shouldn&#39;t go?&quot; He asked. Abbey shook her head to that too. &quot;I have no clue what your trying say Abbey.&quot; John complained. The puppy looked at him, then carefully took a step, then another, and then fell it&#39;s face. John broke out laughing before getting glared at by Abbey. &quot;Oh so you can&#39;t walk.&quot; That produced a nod. John reached down and grabbed Abbey, then held her in his arms. &quot;Now can we go?&quot; He asked. Abbey nodded and John walked off.<br />
<br />
He hadn&#39;t gone far when he arrived at a door. &quot;Here goes nothing...&quot; He mumbled as he opened the door and was greeted by...</p>
