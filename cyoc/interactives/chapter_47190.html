<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They had been going at it for an hour when Carol came in to offer them some soda.   &quot;What are you working on, guys?&quot; she asked curiously.  &quot;We were just trying to figure out, if this is the worst case scenario, which guys would be willing to...um...if we were...&quot;  Jenn spoke with a lump in he throat.  &quot;You know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Courage, honey.  Jennifer, I love you...both of you, very, very much.  There will be a wonderful man for you two, sooner or later.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's the later that I'm worried about, thought Lisa.  &quot;Mom, thanks for trying to make us feel better, really, but I don't think we have a whole lot of time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any man worth keeping will love you regardless of how you look.  And girls, no matter what your appearance is, never settle for someone just because you think you have to.  Don't worry girls, you will find a fine gentleman, eventually.  Look, I'm going to to the deli for sandwiches.  You like baklava, right Jen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...uh, yes, thanks Karl...Carol - sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carol laughed, &quot;that's OK, Jen.  I'll be back in an hour or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa stared at the computer screen.  &quot;My Mom is right, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen nodded.  &quot;Yeah, but it's not her body that's changing.  Speaking of which...look, I don't want to sound perverted of anything, but do you still have that digital camera?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Want to take some pictures of what we look like now, so we don't forget?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And see if anything else has changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;yeah, that too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer undressed slowly.  It had only been a few hours,  so there was nothing new to see she figured.  Jen was 5'4&quot; and 110 pounds.  She'd had a perfect figure since she was thirteen, platinum blonde with sandy colored eyebrows.  Her breasts were milky white with pink nipples that easily filled a C-cup bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;You never had to put up with a bush like me, have you Jen?&quot; Lisa snapped a picture<br />
<br />
No, she never did, she could have counted them all if she wanted to...but now the hairs there were joined by a fuzz that would soon...  A tear rolled down her cheek as she realized that eventually her beautiful ivory skin would be buried under a coarse mat of hair, maybe for the rest of her life.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does my face look?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa stared at her friends face.  Like her cheeks that morning, a definate fuzz had appeared around the eyebrows.  She ran her hands through the shoulder-lenghth blonde hair.  Lisa didn't think that Jen's hair had gotten any thicker...but it had been some time since they had made up each others hair, so it was hard to say for sure.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're eyebrows are getting some fuzz around the edges, but your cheeks look the same..well, maybe the fuzz is a bit longer, but it's still just fuzz.  Turn around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen did so.  Lisa looked under Jen's long hair, and saw that the nape of her neck had developed a thick mat of fuzz.  A line of peach fuzz ran down her spine to her little tailbone, and continued on between her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled compassionately.  &quot;Well...it's just fuzz for now, but&quot;...she took Jen's hand behind her back of feel the downy growth at the small of her back.  &quot;Now feel the back of your neck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God...that wasn't there before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa shook her head.  &quot;If you were eight years younger, I'd say that you were going to have a big 'ol bush by the time you entered high school...&quot;  She noticed something.  &quot;Hold up your arms, Jen...&quot;  Just as she thought, thick fuzz had appeared in Jennifer's armpits as well.<br />
<br />
Lisa took a few more shots, then got undressed herself.<br />
<br />
She moaned when she saw her body.  A dark shadow had formed between her legs.  The stubble of her luxuriant bush was interlaced with soft dark fuzz.  Lisa  had never seen herself with a full pubic growth, never wanted to, and shuddered to think what she would look like there in just a few days.  Stubble filled her armpits, sprouted from her legs, and all of it was laced with the soft fuzz indicating that things were just getting started.<br />
<br />
Sighing shakily, she asked Jennifer about her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;The first thing the guy who cursed me said was that I was going to grow a beard.  The fuzz on your lip looks pretty thick, Lisa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;  Lisa ran to her mirror.  She could handle having more body hair, but her face?  &quot;No, please!&quot; she whimpered to herself.  There was a definate growth of fuzz on her lip, and her eyebrows, always quite luxuriant anyway were surrounded like Jennifer's were.  <br />
<br />
As a tear rolled down her cheek, Jennifer put an arm around her friend's shoulder.  &quot;How long do you think we've got?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh,&quot; asked Lisa, her voice cracking.  &quot;Oh, um...figure&quot;... she grabbed her calculator.  &quot;Figure maybe an inch per month....oh jeez, I think we have a week before whatever we get is noticeable...y'know, a quarter inch or so.   After three weeks,&quot; Lisa choked back a sob.  &quot;After three weeks Jennifer, our skin will start to disappear.  After five weeks...well, I guess it depends on the texture, but....&quot;<br />
<br />
She couldn't finish.  Lisa didn't even want to think about the other effects they would face.  Libido?  She figured her libido right now was in the negative range, but she hugged her friend tightly.  She wouldn't let her go no matter what happened.<br />
<br />
Carol came back about a half hour later.  They weren't really in the mood for anything, and with the turkey sandwiches working their own magic, the two girls went to bed, feeling drowsy, holding each other's hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not good, Audrey.  Jen's mother had called from Chicago to find out the prognosis shortly after her daughter and friend had gone to bed.  &quot;Doctor Perkins says its a human and cattle hybrid growth hormone most likely.  Our little girls are gonna change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Carol, how badly are they affected?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, he told us to get the yearbook and graduation pictures taken as soon as we can.  It's not life-threatening...but...oh, Audrey, we aren't going to be able to recognize them in a few months, is what it sounded like he was saying.&quot;</p>
