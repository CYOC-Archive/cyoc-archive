<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martin woke up first, he had a big headache and barely remembered what happened before he passed out. He looked around and noticed he was in a lab, then he remembered the bet, the old mansion, the lab in the basement and the mysterious vial he drank.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; He asked as he touched a white goo on his left hand. It was dark and he barely can see it but when he smelled it he was disgusted of its fishy scent. A moment later, he realized that he was shirtless and the same goo was all around his chest. When he put a hand to touch it, he noticed something else. &quot;Hair?&quot; He wondered as he felt a thin line of hair going through his belly. He followed its trial with his hands until he made contact with something that surprised him. &quot;Whoa!! What?! What&#39;s this thing on me?!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
He jumped up scared thinking that a rat could be resting on his belly. He shook for a brief moment until he realized that the bush of hair won&#39;t fall down. It was attached to him! To make sure of that, he picked a hair and pulled it out. &quot;Ouch!!&quot; The pain he felt was new to him, at least in that part of his body. &quot;It&#39;s mine.&quot; He said still dumbfounded. &quot; Why do I have hair under my belly? Just grown-ups have hair there and...&quot; He put his hands on his armpits. &quot;Yep. I have hair there too.&quot;<br />
<br />
After that discovery, Martin began to feel his arms, his legs, his chest, even his butt! All those places didn&#39;t have hair that morning and now they&#39;re full of coarse curly hairs. He was starting to panic. &quot;Am I becoming a monkey?&quot; He worried, he didn&#39;t want to be an animal. Maybe, it&#39;s something worse like a monster. He was freaking out now.<br />
<br />
Then, lights came on and Martin noticed that he wasn&#39;t alone. A grown bearded man with his hand on the light switch was staring at him. He seemed familiar but Martin can&#39;t recognize him. It was an uncle? A friend of his dad? He knew he had seen that face before but he didn&#39;t have time to ask about it, because that man started to scream like he was seeing a monster or so.<br />
<br />
Martin was so astounded and he felt so ashamed that he desperately tried to hide himself behind a table. However, didn&#39;t stop screaming and a moment later he started to cry and beg for his life. Martin can&#39;t believe it, or he was truly hideous or the man was a big crybaby. He was wondering when he realized something else. He was naked, completely naked. Was the man screaming because he saw his pee pee?<br />
<br />
Martin looked down and gasped. That wasn&#39;t his pee pee, that was a giant worm attached to him! It was big as a soda bottle and it swayed like a fish out of the water with each movement he made. Under it, a disgusting long sack full of hair was hanging low between his thighs. He realized it was heavy and when he touched it, he felt two big orbs like chicken eggs inside it. &quot;Oh gosh! What&#39;s this? I&#39;m a monster!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, don&#39;t hurt me. I won&#39;t tell anyone, sir.&quot; The man kept crying. &quot;I&#39;m just a kid. My, my friend forced me to come here. I didn&#39;t want to!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on a sec.&quot; Martin said after hearing that. He stopped looking at him and began to watch at the man. He realized he was naked too. Full of coarse hair like him and with a monstrous pee pee just like him. He quickly looked around and after realizing that his friend wasn&#39;t around, everything became clearer. &quot;Jack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know my name?&quot; The man said as he grabbed a broken bottle as a weapon.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s me, Martin!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not Martin! Martin is my friend, he is a kid and you are not him!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s me, I don&#39;t know what happened or why do I look like this but you must trust me! I&#39;m your best friend.&quot; Martin tried to calm down Jack who was menacingly moving his broken bottle. &quot;Just look at yourself! You has changed too! You look like a grown up! At first I didn&#39;t recognize you either but now I comprehend it all! We&#39;ve turned into adults!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s ridiculous I&#39;m not a...&quot; Jack was saying as he looked down and noticed the pelt of hair that now covered his chest. &quot;AAAHH!!! What happened to me?!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you.&quot; Martin said as he watched his friend dropping the broken bottle. &quot;I don&#39;t understand what happened but we must find out how to go back to normal! But, first, we should look for some clothes. I don&#39;t know if all adults look like this but  I think it&#39;s kind of disturbing being so hairy.&quot;</p>
