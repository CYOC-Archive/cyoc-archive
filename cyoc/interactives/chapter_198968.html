<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Galvanised by the scream, you quickly ducked under the curtain rod -- since you were now at least a foot taller -- and exited the bathroom. Although you had registered that as a cry of orgasmic release, it had sounded so high-pitched and animalistic that you couldn&#39;t be sure and didn&#39;t want to take any chances that your friend was hurt -- or freaked out.<br />
<br />
You tried to hurry, but had to lean on the wall, unsure of your footing. While the Wave seemed to have rewired your motor functions so that you did not have too much trouble adjusting to the digitigrade gait, your conscious mind still found it weird to be walking on the balls of your feet.<br />
<br />
At any rate the cabin was small enough that it was a quick walk from the bathroom to the front room, where you had left Ben reading a book on the old sofa. Hearing satisfied panting as you neared the door, the knot in your stomach got tighter. He obviously wasn&#39;t hurt, so your concern was allayed; and you didn&#39;t really want to see what Ben had become, especially if he was going to be all excited over it.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, you <i>were</i> curious. And you might as well get this over with -- it&#39;s not like you could avoid him forever. And... and your canine nose was picking up a sweet musky odour that <i>you</i> didn&#39;t recognise but which was making your loins stir again.<br />
<br />
Going through the door, you instantly spotted what had become of your friend. You would not have recognised Ben -- if you hadn&#39;t known he was in here, you might have assumed it was an intruder. The voluptuous creature sprawled out on the floor was certainly not the male you had left him as. The three fluffy tails waving above a gorgeous ass left no doubt as to what he&#39;d become as she lifted her head to you, foxy eyes sparkling with joy, mischief, and lust.<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
Like you, Ben&#39;s first premonition of the incoming Myth Wave had been an itching along his cock. Engrossed in his book, he had just shifted a bit, hoping it would go away. But when it grew into a need to be touched, he gave in, setting the book aside and standing. Figuring your shower would last a while, he slipped out of his pants and briefs, and was looking for some kleenex when the sensations intensified and sexual warmth and tension began to flood his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, fuck it...&quot; He couldn&#39;t wait, and began to pump at his thick five-incher. Gasping at how sensitive he felt, he collapsed back on the couch, his left hand straying to rub a nipple, which also felt unusually sensitive through his shirt, a pleasant tingling spreading through his chest.<br />
<br />
And suddenly -- &quot;Ahhhh!&quot; He was spraying his modest load out over the worn rug and hardwood floor. It was much sooner than he&#39;d ever come before, and he still felt so hot. Hotter, even, but in a good way. He blushed, giggling a bit, then his voice cracked. His eyes widened at the change in pitch as he felt a lump in his throat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-at?&quot; He lifted his hand to his throat, feeling the lump -- his Adam&#39;s apple dissolve under them. &quot;Oh my God...!&quot; He breathed, his voice settling on a new feminine pitch. He saw his hand start to shift, delicate black hairs poking out of his skin, and held it out so he could better see it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-it&#39;s happening!&quot; He stood up, wobbling a bit as the waves of pleasant heat washed over him, and he shivered in delicious excitement at the teasing prickle of sprouting fur over all his body. As he watched, his fingers became longer, more delicate; his nails compressed into claws, dainty but hard and sharp. Black fur formed a velvety glove that ran up to near his elbow, where it gave way to dark golden pelage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhh...&quot; He felt like he was melting in bliss as his nipples began to beg him to be touched. He complied readily, staring down in anticipation as he unbuttoned his shirt and shrugged it off, then placed a hand on each pectoral, feeling the flesh began to burgeon beneath them. &quot;Yee-eeess!&quot; He admired the soft white fur of his front as he watched the breasts form.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d kept this fantasy to himself, having barely dared talk about his desire to become a beautiful creature of legend, much less his curiosity about the &quot;other side.&quot; But now... now it was becoming reality! Mind swimming in lustful joy, he hazily blessed the gods for this gift, as the Myth Wave unlocked his desires and inner self.<br />
<br />
But while he could feel his shoulders drawing together and hips expanding, he clearly was not losing his male organ either. For a minute he could still see it, standing proud in front of him, though his expanding bust would soon obscure most of it. He ran his hand down his stomach, now flat and taut with subtle feminine muscle, teasing down his soft fur to his groin as he watched his cock change from human to something better.<br />
<br />
The covering skin had withdrawn to make a sheath, leaving the entire length a glistening red, smooth and super-sensitive and slick with the pre that leaked out of his slit. The main shaft got a little slimmer, but this was more than made up for by the increased length, seven inches tapering off to an elegant point. More mass shifted to the base, where a mouth-watering knot expanded, making him groan into a broken laugh as his hand finally found and squeezed it.<br />
<br />
Unlike with you, his desire and acceptance made the transformation painless, his muscles relaxing, the magic swirling in the air lowering him softly to the cum-stained carpet as if he were kneeling in gratitude. Not that Ben felt like a &quot;he&quot; any more. As his body shifted, feet smoothly morphing into paws and face pressing out into a sharp, narrow muzzle, he slid his hand down further, bending slightly as his searching fingers caressed his seed orbs, nicely increased and shielded in silken sack, and probed further toward a new sensation.<br />
<br />
With a pleasured &quot;chrrr,&quot; Ben knew he was no longer just male as claws and soft pads felt a ripe swelling behind his balls. Even as HER fingers reached it, the swelling split apart into two lips, and his fingers dipped <i>inside</i> of herself for the first time, making her shudder as her claws traced along delicate inner folds of fresh, female wetness kissing them in greeting.<br />
<br />
Instinctively she knew it -- she was both male and female, and while this hermaphrodite form would be her norm, she could shift between any sex at will. Just as she could shift between animal and anthropomorphic and full human. It was her birthright as a fox spirit of Eastern myth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooohh yeeeeesss...&quot; This time the words hissed through fangs, her clever fox face fully formed as her ears flicked up to their rightful place atop her skull, black triangles poking through long red hair. Instead of falling out, as yours had, it had grown longer, and shaded from brown to deep crimson. Her eyes had also changed from a weak hazel to a vibrant pale gold, shimmering around slit vulpine pupils. Long, fine whiskers sprouted from her muzzle and forehead, almost invisible as they twitched, her long canid tongue spilling over her sharp teeth as she panted in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Her second hand now trailed down her body, making her yip as she discovered more round mammary flesh and perky nipples beneath her original two, now grown to a DD. The second set of breasts was perhaps an inch or two smaller, the third an inch less then that. And below them, just above her groin, were a fourth pair of nipples, little tit flesh behind them, but still large and stiff as she rolled one beneath her fingers.<br />
<br />
She let herself sink down entirely, gasping as her nipples were crushed into the hardwood floor by her squishing boobs. <i>Oh yes...</i> She kept repeating it silently, words now lost in gasps, moans and little growly purrs. Continuing to tease her new vagina with one hand, she found her vulpine prick with the other, and began to thrust with her hips -- hips now of child-bearing proportions, melding with a heart-shape ass and flowing down into long, toned legs that ended in powerful huntress&#39; paws wrapped in natural black stockings.<br />
<br />
The final changes settled in as her tailbone wiggled free and sprouted, two other nubs splitting off from it to grow into three long, fluffy, prehensile tails that waved excitedly in the air above her, gold-furred ass with large white tips.<br />
<br />
Finally her diligence paid off, and her vulpine equipment, new and reformed, began to pulse with orgasm. She lifted her muzzle to yowl in vulpine ecstasy as femcum gushed over her hand and balls while a todd&#39;s seed pumped out to stain the floor and her belly fur.<br />
<br />
For a minute she lay there, panting and thanking the Old Gods, before pushing herself back onto her hands and knees. Bracing on her right, she looked under herself at the hanging breasts, fondling the nipples with her left. They still cried for attention -- her whole body DEMANDED to be admired, loved, wanted. Then her ears perked at the sound of heavy footfalls, the clack of claws on wood. She looked up, thin black lips pulling back in a smile as her eyes met yours.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, <i>hello</i> gorgeous,&quot; she purred. &quot;I see the Myth Wave blessed you too. Heh... heh... A... hellhound? A huge improvement... so strong... and sexy... and I can&#39;t wait to see your knot.&quot; She ran her tongue along her lips, her lust-fogged mind enjoying your conflicted expression. &quot;Or better yet...&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned, lifting her large, heart-shaped rear in your direction, golden cheeks shading inward to white around the glistening pink folds of her new, intimate opening. &quot;Why don&#39;t you let me <i>feel</i> it?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shook her hips, making that juicy ass jiggle, while her waving tails fanned out her pheromones. She knew that you had been reluctant about this, but now you had no choice. Fully aware of how delectable she was, she was going to teach you to love it as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Ozzie, let&#39;s <i>celebrate</i> our new bodies!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your sensitive nose had no trouble picking up the scent of a willing female. Your instincts howled at you to take advantage of the offer and claim the vixen, your cock emerging again. But this was... You&#39;d just transformed, and all Ben could think about was sex!? Was the change screwing with her mind? You knew Ben had wanted the change, but... seriously?<br />
<br />
But it was clear that your kitsunefied friend wanted something from you very badly -- and your changed body wanted to give it to her.</p>
