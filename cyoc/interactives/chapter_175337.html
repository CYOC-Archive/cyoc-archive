“OK enough fun, let’s get to the real reason we’re doing this.” Jesse said, pulling back the phone and moving it around to take a picture before immediately realizing a couple problems.<br />
<br />
“Oh right, I’m gonna need your phone and passcode to get into it so we can put these on your feeds.” <br />
<br />
Paige huffed. “No, absolutely not. Just take them on your phone and send them to me and I’ll put them on myself. I’ll have to do some editing and making sure to only pick the good ones.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t trust me?” Jesse asked, clearly hurt. <br />
<br />
“Look, just do it from your phone and we’ll sort it out later, OK?”<br />
<br />
“Hmm, I’ve got another idea.” Jesse responded, grabbing the phone and bringing it super close to Paige. The phone quickly unlocked. Being an iPhone, the face unlock feature was still on, and while a lot about Paige had changed, her face thankfully was not one of those things.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Stop it, don’t post these without my permission!”<br />
<br />
“Oh relax, we’re just having fun, aren’t we little sis?”<br />
<br />
Paige once again huffed. This wasn’t how she expected things to go. Though thinking about it, how had she expected things to go? How would she have been able to take pictures of herself anyway, being so small. Handling a phone at this size was nearly impossible. Plus it limited the complexity of the backdrops she could do at this size.<br />
<br />
“OK, fine. But I get final say before you post something, OK?” Paige said sternly. Jesse just smiled back before replying. <br />
<br />
“Deal.”<br />
<br />
Paige explained what she wanted to start off with and the first shoot was promptly set up by Jesse. The Barbie doll and Paige were to be back to back in matching pink and white cheerleader outfits, both with arms crossed while on top of a desk. The ball joints on the doll were clearly visible while it was clear that Paige was a real human. In the background was a pen laying sideways on the desk, showing the scale of the two.<br />
<br />
After taking a quick picture, Jesse frowned, clearly dissatisfied. <br />
<br />
“What is it now?” Paige asked, annoyed.<br />
<br />
“I mean, this is really boring. C’mon, we can do something more interesting than that, can’t we?” <br />
<br />
“Look, this is my photo shoot. If you don’t like it you can leave me alone to do it myself.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I can, huh? As much as I’d love to see you try and do all this by yourself, I have a much better idea.” Jesse said before grabbing the Chronivac and the CD from the box and leaving the room.<br />
<br />
“Wait, what? Hey, get back here!!” Jesse yelled, while being left on top of the desk. She looked around and realized she was stuck up here and couldn’t really do anything. Her sister had taken both her phone and device with her, leaving Paige without much to do besides waiting for her sister to return.<br />
<br />
After about 15 minutes she came back, grinning ear to ear.<br />
<br />
“So, I thought this little device would be pretty cool, but it’s got a lot more settings than I thought. I made a couple changes and have a couple fun presets on here now. I’ll let you try and figure out what they are though, rather than spoil the fun and tell you myself.”<br />
<br />
“No, Jesse, that’s not fair. We’re doing this my way, got it?” Paige was clearly getting tired of not being in control. But unfortunately for her none of the changes or presets Jesse had set up would help that.<br />
<br />
“I’ll listen to your ideas, but I’m the one with the camera, so I’m directing. Now, go over to your doll twin and how about we do some cheers? And make sure to smile.” <br />
<br />
Still upset, Paige decided to follow what Jesse had told her to do anyway. Moving back to the doll, she picked up some pom poms matching her outfit and proceeded to make some half-hearted attempts at cheer poses. Jesse meanwhile was not impressed. <br />
<br />
“I knew this would be a problem. But don’t worry, I came prepared.” Jesse said before grabbing the Chronivac. And before Paige had a chance to protest, Jesse had already pressed a button on it.<br />
<br />
And suddenly Paige cared a lot less about what her sister was doing with the device. She looked back over at the doll and giggled, remembering what her predicament was.<br />
<br />
“OK, now Barbie, how about we do some cheer poses?”<br />
<br />
“Kay!” Paige shouted back before smiling much wider than before. Now her poses were much more lifelike and sincere, however still not good. This didn’t matter to Jesse though, as she continued to tweak the doll’s position while giving commands to her sister, all while taking pictures.<br />
<br />
After a solid half hour of pictures, Paige was starting to get tired. Jesse thankfully noticed this.<br />
<br />
“OK Barbie, time to stop for now. Let’s take a look at some of the photos!”<br />
<br />
“Yay!” shouted Paige, pom poms waving in the air, still clearly very in her cheerleader persona that she embodied for the photo shoot.<br />
<br />
Jesse smiled again before clicking a button on the Chronivac, at which point Paige very quickly stopped smiling, and after a few seconds of looking around, brought her pom-pom clad hands back down to her side before dropping them.<br />
<br />
“...What just happened?” Paige asked, looking as if she had just come out of a trance. Which, in fairness, she had.<br />
<br />
“I’ll explain, but first come look over these pictures I uploaded to your instagram. Come on, it’ll be fun!” <br />
<br />
Paige walked over to the edge of the desk and stared at the phone in shock at the first picture. It was a gif of her jumping up and down in a silly manner, pom poms shaking nearly as much as her breasts were. Jesse swiped to the next photo and Paige gasped in shock. This one showed her bending over, enticingly showing off how far the short skirt came up her thighs.<br />
<br />
The next photos weren’t any better: pouting at the camera, her jumping as the skirt flew up showing off the embarrassing doll panties she now wore while she wore a dopey smile on her face, a short video of her falling while trying to do a cartwheel, then giggling as she got back up… It was all incredibly humiliating and nothing she would ever do in a million years, and yet each time she saw a picture or video, the memory of her doing it popped back into her head.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck did you do to me!?” Paige yelled, clearly incredibly confused and upset.<br />
<br />
“See, something you said earlier got to me. ‘We can’t all be bimbos.’ Why not? You look like one now, so I figured you’d be more cooperative if you acted like one too. So I set the button to make you act like your idea of a stereotypical bimbo. Paige also isn’t super fitting like that, so you can only answer to ‘Barbie’ while you’re in that mode. That seemed a lot more fitting.”<br />
<br />
Paige’s mouth was agape in shock as she heard all this. <br />
<br />
“You… You bitch! I can’t believe you did that to me! OK, the first thing you’re going to do is delete everything. Then you’re going to apologize, and then you’re going to change me back so I can kick your as-”<br />
<br />
“Quiet” Jesse calmly said as Paige found herself no longer able to speak.<br />
<br />
“See, I knew you’d be against all this. So you also have to obey whatever I tell you to now. This device is really really helpful. I’ve got quite a few things planned for it, but for now I think I’ll introduce you to your new life. See, these photo shoots can earn quite a bit of money. I’m gonna just claim it’s all fancy post processing and start selling the rights. You’ll get to be famous and do your photo shoots, and I’ll get a buttload of money for it. We’ll both be happy.”<br />
<br />
Paige was in shock as she heard this. She wanted to yell at her sister but found she couldn’t say a thing.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure you’ve got a lot of things to say, so you can speak now. But you’re not allowed to yell or be angry at me.”<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe you’d do this.” Paige stated calmly. “Just change me back, I’ll let you have the device.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m taking the device anyway. I’m sure in time you’ll learn to love this. In fact, I can guarantee it.” Jesse smiled evilly. <br />
<br />
Paige just stood there, mouth agape in horror from what she just heard. She was completely at the mercy of her little sister, that now towered over her and had complete control over her body and mind. This is not how she expected the day to go.</p>
