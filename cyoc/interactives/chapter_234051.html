<br />
&quot;Command to HQ. Alpha target is half click away.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the Normal HQ replied, the Commander studied the capital city of the fae carefully. It was impossible to deny the beauty of the miniature fortress, this sprawling fantasyesque castle settled into the forest. The Commander could see smaller buildings lining the immediate area around the castle, obviously the homes or other fairy created buildings. For a moment, he felt as if he was staring at a pristine model, developed with care by some other worldly being. It seemed almost criminal to destroy it.<br />
<br />
That moment though passed, they had their orders. The Normal planned this invasion for weeks, strategized all possible landing zones, even invented counter measures to remain human sized in the land of the fae useing technology and dark magic. Understanding the importance of the mission, the Commander gave the order to activate their flame throwers and advance. The battalion only needed to be withing 100 yards of the structure before letting loose with a torrent of flame. As they closed the distance, the Commander paused.<br />
<br />
Bagpipes?<br />
<br />
The Commander looked to the surrounding trees, the sounds of bagpipes now echoing through the forest. The fae had spotted them and were warning the capital of the attack. This was to be expected, the Commander ordering his men into position, preparing to ignite both the tress and the capital in one assault. Focusing on the tallest spire of the castle, the Commander could make our the faintest image. A small purple speck, gently landing on the tallest peak.<br />
<br />
Zephyr scowled at the approaching titans. When his father gave him this task, he was astonished. In fairy warfare, one fairy was designated as The Muse. The Muse was a title of great importance in fairy society. That fairy playing the instrument of their choice to inspire its troops and set the pace for battle. That honor now fell to Zephyr, the purple fairy gently landing upon the tallest spire of the castle with fiddle in hand. Taking a moment to compose himself, Zephyr now drew up his fiddle as he began to play.<br />
<br />
The Commander was at first confused. A fiddle? The Normal expected the fairy army, not music. Ordering his troops to fire upon the magically shielded capital, he gasped in surprise.<br />
<br />
The fire rolling over the castles shielding like a wave was expected. What he had not expected was the fairy army to attack in the way they did now. Thousands of small specks now converged over the castle, forming a massive swarm like angry bees. The fairy were so numerous they blotted out the forest behind them, in a massive, dark cloud. That cloud now rushed towards the nearest soldier, moving as one. All the Commander could hear was the scream of his soldier as this angry swarm rushed passed him, blood spurting from wounds before the swarm passed. For a moment the soldier wobbled, before falling dead, his throat slashed by a thousand tiny slices.<br />
<br />
Arion meanwhile had brought Connor and Spark to the capital to Speak with Queen Glitter. Arion was sure that if anyone could tell the queen what was happening than it would be his daughter and future son in-law.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s my little big bro!&quot; Spark said with enthusiasm as she and Connor watched from one of the windows in the castle up in the throne room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spark, Connor, a word please?&quot; Queen Glitter said as the two walked away from the window and approached the Queen&#39;s throne.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been many a year since the Fae realm was invaded by outsiders, might you two know who these forces are?&quot; Queen Glitter asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I might. I was able to get a good look at them as we were coming here, I believe I&#39;ve seen their uniforms before. I think they&#39;re with the Normal.&quot; Connor replied with his theory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it. I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d ever have the gall in returning here.&quot; Queen Glitter said slamming her fist down on her armchair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your majesty, you&#39;ve dealt with the Normal before?&quot; Spark asked in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have and even now, I fear our forces might not be enough in defending our kingdom from these people. I think I may have to ask my daughter for help against this threat.&quot; Queen Glitter said as she watched some soldiers fighting back against the other fairies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daughter? Don&#39;t you mean your granddaughter, your majesty?&quot; Spark asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don&#39;t. Everything will be revealed to you in due time.&quot; Queen Glitter replied as she went into her chambers alone.<br />
<br />
She placed her hand on her mirror to see her daughter, Sara McMillan at her desk looking over things and seeming puzzled. It reminded her so much of herself, when she was younger trying to figure things out for the kingdom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarathea?&quot; Queen Glitter said into the mirror as Sarah&#39;s head perked up and she looked towards the mirror.<br />
<br />
Sarah went to the mirror and stood before it looking at her birth mother with concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother? What is it? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Sarah asked with much concern in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, the Normal have invaded the Fae realm. Their target is the castle itself, you must gather whatever forces you can and come to our aid.&quot; Queen Glitter informed her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forces? Mother, I can just come with a team of S.P.E.A.R. agents and we can....&quot; &quot;IT WON&#39;T BE ENOUGH!&quot; Glitter shouted into the mirror. Sarah and Glitter now stood before each other both quiet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, if this were any other place on the planet, I would say to just bring your own troops, but obviously they&#39;ve become more bold than when your father and I faced them.&quot; Glitter explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;But mother, even if I could gather forces, I don&#39;t think they&#39;d listen to me.&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, my sweet Sarah. Remember you are and will always be of two worlds. You&#39;re not just Sarah McMillan, you&#39;re Princess Sarathea, daughter of Queen Glitter and heir to the fae throne. I think it&#39;s time to show the world that you fight for all the realms.&quot; Glitter said with a smile as Sarah nodded to her mother.<br />
<br />
Glitter could then hear more rumblings from outside and grew concerned. &quot;The werewolves, the vampires, Sarah, whoever you can get, send them here with you. I believe in you, my sweet Sarathea.&quot; Glitter said before ending the mirror call and leaving her chambers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Send word to activate the cities defenses,&quot; Glitter called to one of her council before turning to Spark and Connor. &quot;My daughter will need your help in mustering allies,&quot; she stated. &quot;I&#39;m going to open a portal to S.P.E.A.R. Once there help Sarah convince the others to join us. I fear our military and defenses can only hold for so long.&quot; Spark and Connor watched as Queen Glitter now approached a larger mirror, the same one the couple stepped through upon their arrival. They now watched anxiously as Glitter closed her eyes, trying to open the portal once more.<br />
<br />
Glitter frowned, Spark and Connor nervously looking between themselves and an obviously distressed fairy queen. &quot;Your majesty,&quot; they asked.<br />
<br />
Glitter faced them, her eyes wide and near panic as she faced the teens. &quot;I can not open a portal,&quot; she said in alarm. &quot;Something is preventing us from traveling outside our realm!&quot; Spark and Connor&#39;s eyes went wide with terror as they understood why. The Normal were keeping them here somehow. If they couldn&#39;t figure out how and fast, the entire capital would be reduced to ash.</p>
