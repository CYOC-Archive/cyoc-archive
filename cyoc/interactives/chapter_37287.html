<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taking my thumb out of my mouth, I pushed my face into my pillow and after a bit sat up and looked at Katherine. She was holding a doll and I could feel my mind slip again, but I quickly looked at the plush mouse I had and said, &quot;No, I kind of tired, maybe later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally I got up and went to go find my backpack; I did have homework to do. The only problem was that I couldn't locate it, something that bothered me and by the time I was ready to ask mother for help, she was letting Samantha in to baby sit us. Walking up to mother, I opened my mouth to ask her if she had seen my backpack, but she cut me off with, &quot;You behave for the babysitter tonight, got it? Now, go and take your bath Marcus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bothered by this turn of events, wondering why my backpack had vanished, I went into the bathroom and began to run the warm water. Just as I was about to plug the tub and start filling it, Samantha walked with Katherine and said to both us of, &quot;Bath time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at my sister and than the babysitter, I replied, &quot;I can't take a bath with her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha stopped and looked at me and than asked me, &quot;Why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because she's my sister,&quot; I sputtered looking at her, bothered by this even weirder turn of events.<br />
<br />
Samantha shook her head and said, &quot;That's a load of nonsense. When I was your age I took a bath with my sister all the time. It saved my mother on filling the tub, draining it and the refilling it. Now, strip and get into the tub.&quot;<br />
<br />
Upset, not having a comeback, I began to get undressed, reminding myself over and over, &quot;I'm a fifteen year old male.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning, I saw my sister had undressed, and immediately thought, “Is that what I going to look like when this transformation is done? Smooth flat skin for a private and just a hint of a crease or fold to suggest what’s tucked between my legs.”  Embarrassed by what I was thinking, what I was seeing and the fact that I was starring at my sister’s crotch, I quickly looked away from her. <br />
<br />
Turning to Samantha I noticed she had plugged the tub and filled it up with a pink bubble bath. Seeing that both of us were no longer wearing our clothes, she told us, &quot;Into the tub.&quot;<br />
<br />
Climbing into the tub, I sat and tried to understand all that has happened, but it was difficult because of Samantha tugging at my hair as she washed it. After I'd been bathed, now smelling of strawberries, the babysitter dried me off, dried Katherine off, wrapped a towel around each of us, took us by the hand and led us back to what I was now thinking as our room.<br />
<br />
From somewhere in the closet, she pulled out two pull-up diapers, looked at them and then handed one to my sister and the other me. At which point she said, &quot;Put these on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at it, I could see that the one being offered to me was a diaper for a three year old girl while the one or Katherine was a for four year old. Looking at Samantha, I told her, &quot;I don't want to wear it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha replied, &quot;Put it on, or I'll put it on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still hugging the towel around my body like I was wearing some type of cape, I said rather defiantly, &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before I could stop her, Samantha grabbed my hand again and leading me out of the bedroom and back into the bathroom, she said to me, &quot;You have to wear your dry-nights. You know that you still accidents. Your mother says that if you refuse, I have permission to do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before I could do anything, she pulled the towel off me and laying me down on the floor, held me in place. I heard her opening the cupboard under the sink and then I heard a funny sound. Next thing I knew, I felt her lifting me up by my ankles and placing something soft under me. My mind made an attempt to slip, but I shrugged it off as Samantha stood me up. Looking down I could see that I was wearing a pinkish coloured diaper with some type of design on the waist band.<br />
<br />
Embarrassed, I felt Samantha take my hand and march me back to the room I now shared with Katherine. Seeing that my sister had put on pull-up, the babysitter asked us, &quot;What type of jammies do you two want to wear?&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine immediately squealed, &quot;Ariel nightgown,&quot; but I remained silent, not liking where all this was going.<br />
<br />
Handing my sister the nightgown, she looked at me with a look that said, &quot;What about you?&quot; but I refused to answer her as she sighed heavily and walked into the closet.<br />
<br />
Walking back out, she was holding a pink pair of pajamas. The bottom half I could see had foot pieces and the top had a picture of Angelina Ballerina on it, and I could hear Samantha muttering, &quot;Why do you half to make things so difficult?&quot;<br />
<br />
Approaching me, she held out the pajama bottom piece and said, &quot;Foot.&quot; <br />
<br />
Not wanting to be put in these against my will, I cooperated. After she had pulled the bottom piece on over my diaper, Samantha said, &quot;Hands up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Putting my hands and arms up, she placed the shirt part of the pajamas over my head. Turning me around, she gently pulled my hair out of the back of my pajamas and lightly swatting my diapered butt, she told me, &quot;Into bed, now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not liking the way the diaper pressed up against my penis and testicles, unhappy because I was being treated like a three year old girl, I climbed under my Hello Kitty comforter and top sheet, inserted my thumb into my mouth and snuggled closer to my Angelina Ballerina mouse. The lights went off and as I lay facing the wall, the glow of the night light comforting both me and Katherine, I gently fell asleep.<br />
<br />
I awoke with a start, looking for the clock on the nightstand, but found neither the clock nor the nightstand. Bothered by this, I slid out of bed and grabbing Angelina, sticking my thumb in my mouth, walked to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
In the kitchen I was greeted by mother who told me, &quot;Marcus, stop sucking your thumb. Yours and Katherine's breakfast is on the table.<br />
<br />
Sitting down, I noticed the clock on the microwave read that it was about nine o'clock in the morning. Laying Angelina on the table, I began to eat my breakfast, asking myself, &quot;Did I miss something. Aren't I supposed to be in school right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at the calendar, I saw that it was a Wednesday, which confirmed that I was supposed to be in school. Looking at my mother, I asked, &quot;Why didn't you wake me up for school?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mother laughed and told me, &quot;Silly goose. Already excited about school, but you know that you won't attend for maybe another year and that will probably be preschool.&quot; At which point she turned back to whatever she was doing.<br />
<br />
Finishing my breakfast, I placed the dishes in the sink, was kissed by mother, who told me, &quot;Go get dressed and maybe you can see Thomas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grabbing Angelina off the table, I walked back the room I now shared, passing Katherine on the way. Inside, I dropped the plush mouse onto my bed and afraid of what I might find, slowly began to undress.<br />
<br />
Stepping in front of the mirror, I saw that I still was a very effeminate looking nine year old boy, but looking closer, I saw that my eyes had changed to a bluish grey and that my hair had started to take on a very medium red colour. Unhappy, I opened the closet and looking at the cubbyholes, pulled out a pair of jeans meant for a little boy and a shirt with a picture of a Pokemon on it. From the vanity, I avoided the mind slip I felt when I looked at the girl's underwear and tights and withdrew a pair of boy’s underwear and socks.<br />
<br />
Dressed, I left the room, holding my favourite stuffed animal, Angelina Ballerina, and prepared myself to face the day and any possible mind slips. &quot;Though I wonder how it could possibly get any worse than this.&quot; I asked myself as I entered the living room.</p>
