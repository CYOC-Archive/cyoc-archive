<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I was more useful. I mean, the whole gay thing is working out great so far and it’s interesting enough to try it out a bit longer. But I’ve been kicked out of the water polo team because of my changed body and yeah. I guess I just want to feel useful again.”<br />
The genie smirked. This was going downhill faster than he had suspected.<br />
“Granted, wise mortal!” He boomed, “Your wish will become true tomorrow. I’m sure you will enjoy it.”<br />
Rick was somehow relieved.  He didn’t know what the genie had actually read into his wish, but he couldn’t really complain much up until now. He kind of liked his new style and wardrobe, and boy, the sex was so much better than the boring stuff he did as a straight guy.<br />
He went to bed early again, anticipating his wish coming true the next day.<br />
When he got up, nothing was out of the ordinary yet. Rick got up early, got dressed in another brightly colored tight jeans and shirt and left for university right on time. He was just crossing the crowded main hall when he saw Josh, apparently in a hurry crossing the hall before he spotted him and went straight for Rick.<br />
“Rick, thank god you’re here! I don’t know if I would have made it.”<br />
Rick was slightly confused about that statement and was wondering what the genie had in store for him this time. However, his confusion grew a whole lot, when he saw Josh nestling on his jeans crotch and pulling out his ample, yet soft dick. <br />
“Please, come on Rick, it’s really urgent!” Josh said while stepping from one leg to another. Rick had absolutely no idea what was going on as Josh grabbed his shoulder and pushed him down – with a certain strength, but not too ungently. Was he expecting him to give him a blowjob, right here in the public? Rick had to admit, he felt a little aroused by the thought, even more so as Josh simply shoved his dick into his mouth.<br />
As he was just about to start sucking him off however, something unexpected happened. With a relieved sigh from Josh’s end, Rick’s mouth began to fill with aridic tasting fluid. Rick couldn’t believe it. Rick couldn’t believe it; Josh was literally pissing into his mouth. He gagged and spilled some of the piss over his clothes, but at the same time, his body betrayed his mind. His cock was rock hard and he had never felt so aroused in his whole life. Josh was using him as a urinal and he was, somehow, enjoying every second of it. He found himself gulping down the liquid greedily despite the fact that somewhere in his mind he felt totally grossed out by it.<br />
A good two minutes later, the flow in his mouth ebbed, and Josh sighed happily. “Phew, thanks bud. You’re a lifesaver!”<br />
He zipped up and turned to leave, adding lightheartedly: “You know, I’m really glad you decided to become our team urinal. Although it took some time getting used to that and we have to share you with the other guys on the campus, it’s really great.”<br />
Rick was left completely flabbergasted. When he looked around, he found nobody had taken offense of the indecent act. His boner was still clearly visible in his stained jeans, but he got up quickly and hoped nobody would notice.<br />
Even after the immediate arousal had faded, he still couldn’t really wrap his head around what happened this morning and had a hard time concentrating on the lecture. It felt so… surreal. And yet, somehow, he found he was craving for more. Just as he was asking himself if he should head home and try to undo this mess, some random guy from a few seats in front of him he didn’t really know stood up and went his way.<br />
“Hey, toilet guy! Open up, I got to pee and don’t want to miss the lecture” he said, already fondling with his jeans. Rick opened his mouth to protest, but as soon as he did, the other man started pissing, aiming at Rick’s open mouth from a good meter afar. <br />
Naturally, that proved to be rather ineffective, soaking both Rick’s clothes as well as his notes with urine. The girl in front of them (Rick’s former girlfriend, as he just noticed) groaned in annoyance.<br />
“Dude! Look at the mess you’re making! It’s not as long as you think it is. Step closer!”<br />
The guy who wasn’t really paying that much attention up until now mumbled a sorry and stepped a bit closer, still keeping a distance. Amazingly enough, most of the rest of his stream went into Rick’s open mouth. Rick was drinking the waste liquid down greedily now again, his instincts having taken over once more. <br />
As Rick’s user was finishing up, he said “Hey, toilet, look, I’m sorry for the mess”, gesticulating to Rick’s filthy notes. “You’re gay, right toilet? I’ll let you suck me off as a way of saying sorry.”<br />
Rick wanted to say a lot of things, like him not being really gay, or not being so easy to appease or not being everyone’s slut, but he still had to swallow down the last mouthful of piss. So he just nodded, fondling his obvious erection through his piss-stained trousers.<br />
As he was sucking off his latest user, right in the middle of the lecture hall, while simultaneously stroking his own cock, Rick came to realize he never felt so useful in his whole life. It was humiliating and gross, but at the same time he loved the feeling of being used, being needed. <br />
It was neither the last blowjob nor the last time he drank another guy’s piss this day – the latter considerably more frequent than the former. After the water polos evening practice, he even had two guys from the team aiming at his open mouth at the same time, of course totally soaking him while he rubbed one out. <br />
It was only when he went home in the evening that he came off his haze and began questioning himself. Was that really the kind of life he wanted for himself? Serving other men as some kind of living urinal? A fecal slut of some sort? He wasn’t so sure about that anymore, even if he would have probably rejoiced about this perspective some hours ago while he was busy servicing one man he had never seen before and being pissed on by another one.<br />
When he arrived home, he called the genie and wished for…</p>
