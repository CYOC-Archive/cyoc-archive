<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yup. It&#39;s time I was honest with you, and most of all myself. When I....did what I did to you when we were younger, I would always tell myself it wasn&#39;t that bad, it was normal because the other kids didn&#39;t care, or that you deserved it for how weird and uncool you were.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am pretty uncool.&quot; Kyle shrugged, indicating that it didn&#39;t really phase him. He moved Jen so that the upper half of her body was outside of his bed, and she could look at him without craning her neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, and yes. In the spirit of honesty, I have to tell you that you&#39;re <i>still</i> weird Kyle. I don&#39;t mean to hurt your feelings when I say that. You act in ways that creep people out and make them uncomfortable, to some extent that&#39;s on <i>you.</i> And I can help you with that, if you want. But that doesn&#39;t make what I did any less wrong...and it was all because I lied to myself, I ignored what my gut told me in lieu of what the feedback of others did. So I need to start being honest with myself, then with you and everyone else to turn a new leaf. And so...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen gulped, and there was a break in the conversation as she kept trying to start speaking but couldn&#39;t find the wherewithal to.<br />
<br />
&quot;What could possibly be so hard for you to admit Jen?&quot; Kyle asked, curious. &quot;You&#39;re popular, charismatic, intelligent, not to mention <i>damn</i> good looking.&quot; Kyle said, feeling extremely cognizant of the acne he couldn&#39;t afford medication for. Jen blushed and said &quot;As arrogant as it sounds, I&#39;m aware of all that. But still, this is difficult to admit...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer took a deep breath. &quot;You&#39;re right, Kyle. I mean, what you used to call me often. You were always right about it in the end. I <i>am</i> a slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle, aghast, quickly started stammering &quot;I-I didn&#39;t mean that. Uh, I mean I <i>did,</i> but that was just because I was being bitter! I don&#39;t think you&#39;re-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, save it. I know what you&#39;re trying to say. I don&#39;t mean a slut, like being immoral or a cheater. At least, I never cheated on any of my boyfriends. But I can&#39;t say I wasn&#39;t tempted at times, and yeah I carried the shame of that with me. And that temptation was because of what I mean when I say &#39;slut&#39;. More like a nympho. Like, I <i>really</i> love having sex. A lot. Really often. But....I love my family, and I&#39;m proud of our good name. I don&#39;t want to tarnish it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! It&#39;s 2019 Jen.&quot; Kyle rolled his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, yeah. I&#39;m not saying a girl&#39;s gotta wait for marriage or anything. But I&#39;m also expected to be a contributing member of society. Especially since I&#39;m not from just any society, but high society. I don&#39;t think most of the people at school realize it. My family might live in this sleepy midwestern town, but that&#39;s just because my mom never liked the big city; we have houses in New York, London, and Singapore when dad needs a place to stay while working. It&#39;d break his heart to see me become a porn star or something, as much as <i>I</i> think people should be whatever they want. Not to mention, I actually <i>do</i> want to be a lawyer, or a entrepreneur, or a news anchor, or a bunch of other candidate careers that happen to be social, prestigious and require a chaste, respectable image from women <i>or</i> men in those fields. In most ways, the apple didn&#39;t fall far from the tree with me. And so...I&#39;ve always hid how much of a horndog I really am, because it would bring shame upon my family.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle raised an eyebrow looking at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I used the term &#39;horndog&#39; as a girl. It&#39;s 2019, Kyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Touche. So you&#39;re saying the curse can help with this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It already has in some ways. You know how I kept screaming at you to not put those posters out? You had <i>no</i> idea how wet I was the whole time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I was the first to try you so I noticed-&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen groaned loudly and looked up at the ceiling exasperated &quot;UGGGHH....Yeah okay, so that&#39;s a figure of speech Kyle. Typically you&#39;re supposed to accept those even if they&#39;re technically untrue-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, but you were just talking about honesty!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle considered pushing Jen into the bed up to her shoulders, as she looked about ready to tear Kyle&#39;s head off or explode herself. &quot;<i>You&#39;re going to need a LOT of guidance in talking to others I see...</i>&quot; she restricted herself to whispering just to avoid full-on shouting in frustration. After a few seconds, she calmed down and continued. &quot;<i>Anyway</i>....that&#39;s part of the reason I was so distraught that night when you kissed me. Not only was I the school&#39;s cumcatcher, I <i>liked</i> it, and that terrified me. My mind kept telling me that the curse made me unrecognizable, but I still felt like everyone could see how juicy Jen the slut got at taking any & all dick. It was a vicious cycle, since I&#39;d never cum more intensely than I did feeling ashamed of being everyone&#39;s public fuckhole, and that made me even more embarrassed, which made me cum even more....you get the picture. I hated the fact that you&#39;d opened that can of worms when just a weeks before I had my life down pat. I wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;d have the <i>willpower</i> to go back to being the respectably-PG Jennifer Smith.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Essentially, you&#39;re the stereotypical good girl with a hidden kinky streak a mile wide?&quot; A crafty smile broke out on Kyle&#39;s face. &quot;That just makes you hotter. So the curse actually helped you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, other than the fact that I was essentially <i>forced to have sex with the whole school non-consensually Kyle...</i>&quot; Jen practically spat out the last part, glaring at him before her face softened &quot;....sorta yeah. Eventually, I came to grips with the fact that I&#39;m a slut, it feels like I could get fucked every ten minutes for the rest of my life and die a happy woman. But to <i>live</i> happily, I want to act like the prim and proper Smith family heiress I was raised to be. It made me feel conflicted, to say the least...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer trailed off for a moment before looking up at Kyle with beaming eyes. &quot;But now, with the curse and your help, I could have both things! <i>And</i> I could help you and your family out, as a way of making those years of suffering up to you. We can both make a fortune, I can have all the sex I could ever want, and I could lead that life in complete secrecy.&quot;<br />
<br />
They sat for a moment, both of them taking in what Jennifer had just said. &quot;I...this sounds almost too good to be true.&quot; Kyle said finally.<br />
<br />
Jennifer thought back to something her father had once taught her. &quot;It&#39;s not. A lot of things that sound too good to be true, actually are. But don&#39;t forget; people strike it rich all the time Kyle. My family did once. It takes luck, but just as essential is seizing the right opportunity. And I&#39;m pretty sure this is the best opportunity either of us have ever had.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen continued, becoming increasingly animated as her mind went into overdrive from the possibilities. &quot;From reading your notes, I know that you can&#39;t make me totally normal ever again. The curse doesn&#39;t allow a total reversion as you put it here.&quot; She pointed to a specific portion of a page. &quot;But you CAN revert the curse enough that I can live normally again, and that&#39;s <b>perfect</b> for what I have planned. I think the best thing you can do is revert everyone&#39;s memory of me. Except for the posters and mouths and stuff, that&#39;s super-important that they not link that to me. Physically, you can make me able to walk around again normally while still having the ability to &#39;press into&#39; things.&quot; She paused to breath. &quot;That should do it....but you know, I just thought of something that might reduce our future production costs.&quot;<br />
<br />
She whispered something else to Kyle. &quot;Why didn&#39;t I think of that?! I wouldn&#39;t&#39; have had to spend....<i>all</i> my savings from the last four months.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Business acumen, Kyle. You&#39;ll get the hang of it, I&#39;ll teach you. I mean, not that I&#39;m a pro myself, but mom and dad taught me a lot. So, you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me a moment.&quot; Kyle closed his eyes and thought hard about how to phrase everything Jen had told him into one transformation. The curse was unpredictable; it would never arbitrarily leave someone who was holding it and skip their turn, but unpredictable things often happened when people tried to chain turns between each other, that always seemed to facilitate it moving on. Because of this, Kyle needed to behave as if they&#39;d only get one shot. &quot;Okay, I&#39;m ready. But you&#39;re going to have to choose both.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why?!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you trust me Jen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;....Yeah. Okay, I&#39;ll let the minute expire. But no funny business!&quot; Jennifer looked away in thought for a moment. &quot;But before that, I need to pass on the curse to you right? Meaning I need to curse you. But <i>before that</i>....you wanna go again?&quot; There was an awkward pause for a moment before Jen looked down. &quot;....it&#39;s kinda hard to act seductive when you only have your upper body.&quot; She pushed her breasts together and opened her mouth for a moment. &quot;Aaaa....no, too cliche.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle paused as well, adding to the growing self-consciousness of the situation. &quot;Err...I&#39;d love to, but my dick feels like it&#39;s going to fall off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked at Kyle blankly for a second, before her expression changed. Kyle began feeling nervous as an evil smile started creeping onto Jennifer&#39;s face. &quot;Transform or dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;J-Jen?! What are you doing!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle...trust me. Choose transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me Kyle, I won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;....transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy, now...&quot;<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;-and for your dare, I dare you to go on a date with me!&quot; Kyle said triumphantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? <i>That</i> was what you needed the dare for? First you had to use magic for sex, now you&#39;re using it to get dates? You&#39;re so lame....cute, but lame.&quot; Jen crossed her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was roman-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;LAME!&quot; Jen overruled Kyle&#39;s rebuttal. &quot;If you&#39;re going to ask a girl out, ask her. Don&#39;t use magic tricks.&quot; She broke into a smile, &quot;Like, what if they choose transform?&quot; she said, getting a laugh from Kyle. &quot;Do you mind if I take a shower?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, but I&#39;ll warn you to not expect anything too fancy. And give it a few minutes to warm up.&quot; Kyle said with a hint of embarrassment at his abode. &quot;It&#39;s not the best shower, I know...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked at him with a soft smile. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I always hated that stupid stereotype that rich people can&#39;t <i>bare</i> to use normal amenities. I&#39;ve taken a shower at Tyra and Lin&#39;s houses a ton of times, and I never had a problem. Do you have an extra towel though?&quot; Kyle did not, but let her use his fresh from the wash.<br />
<br />
After about half an hour, Jen walked back in with the towel wrapped around her hair. She caught Kyle&#39;s eye as she walked in. &quot;What? See anything <i>unfamiliar?</i>&quot; she said sarcastically. &quot;Probably just my towel on you!&quot; Kyle said with a laugh. Jen cracked her neck. &quot;It&#39;s nice to finally feel clean....and to not taste pussy in my mouth. I&#39;ll buy you more mouthwash.&quot; As part of the pseudo-reversal of Jen&#39;s curse, Kyle had re-merged all of Jen&#39;s parts back together. Jen had made quite a racket after, as she ran to the bathroom and coughed up what seemed like gallons of cum, followed by gargling half a bottle of listerine. &quot;I don&#39;t I want to do <i>that</i> again.&quot; She said, walking over to Kyle&#39;s bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now let&#39;s see if this works...&quot; Lying down, Jen pulled her legs over her head and submerged all of herself into Kyle&#39;s bed. All of herself, that is, except the peach of her derriere. The rest of her became two-dimensional once again, but unlike before, her picture-self glided through the sheets, moving down onto the ground before reemerging from the ground besides Kyle&#39;s computer chair with a jump. Jennifer smiled at Kyle and raised her arms above her head, &quot;I almost forgot how cramped it was being a picture, but at least now I&#39;m not stuck like that.&quot; She started to do some of her flexibility exercises from cheer.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, she looked back at her still-present ass on Kyle&#39;s bed. &quot;The copy ability was easy to get the hang of too. Might need some trial & error for tight fits though. Speaking of tight fits...&quot; Jennifer picked up Kyle&#39;s detached dick, licking it until it was hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;AH! It&#39;s still sensitive Jen!&quot; His towel hadn&#39;t been the only thing of Kyle&#39;s Jen had taken into the shower with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>It&#39;s still sensitive Jen!</i>&quot; She said in a sing-song voice. &quot;Are you a man, or a nipple?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Putting aside how ridiculously immature the words you just spoke were, I&#39;m sorely tempted to turn you <i>into</i> a nipple with the next curse.&quot; Kyle was sitting at the computer trying to ignore the blowjob he was receiving while he looked up sex toys online for creative inspiration.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t! Remember Kyle, this is BOTH our moneymakers now!&quot; Jen suddenly took Kyle&#39;s cock and shoved it into her own copied pussy sticking out of Kyle&#39;s mattress, bouncing it in and out with abandon. There was a glint in her eyes as she got more aggressive. &quot;Yeah, take that dick bitch! AHH, fuck!&quot; Jen felt hyper-aroused as she talked dirty to and abused her own parts, though she also felt a little silly talking to herself. Moving onto the bed, she hovered over her ass on all fours, managing to finger her anus with her other hand and eat herself out while continuing to pound her own pussy. &quot;Mmmmm-&quot; she was in heaven, rolling her eyes back. She was assaulting herself, dominating her own helpless genitals, and there was a special kind of thrill of feeling that while at the same time receiving the dick that she slammed in with ever-increasing force. Kyle, for his part, wasn&#39;t complaining as he continued to browse online while Jen jerked him off into her own pussy behind him.<br />
<br />
Eventually, she dropped the penis inside of herself as she walked over to the computer. Walking behind Kyle, she wrapped her arms around him and laid her head on his shoulder. As they got to &quot;work&quot; together, Jen felt the warmth of Kyle&#39;s chest, Kyle felt the warmth of Jennifer&#39;s arms and chin, and they both felt the warm of each other&#39;s crotch, feeling each other&#39;s every twitch and tug. They spent hours looking online and thinking up ideas for products like that, as they planned for the future late into the night. At one point, they also planned a time and place for their first date, both of them feeling a tightness in their chest despite their intimate connection. Long after midnight, they feel asleep in each other&#39;s arms, laying right next to their own bits as Kyle felt Jen&#39;s warm walls throughout the night, and Jen felt Kyle grow and shrink again and again in her first self-made cocksleeve, the one that she would leave him with the next day as she made her way home for the first time in nearly half a year.</p>
