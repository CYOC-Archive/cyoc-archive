<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the predawn light a man leaves the safety of his cabin surrounded by woodland. Living just north of Timmins Ontario; a town seven hours away from the provincial capital Toronto, he examines a game trail. While located in the unofficial halfway point between the great lakes and the southern tip of Hudson Bay, the town was not completely isolated. News of the Furry flu on CBC radio and television was being regularly broadcasted until the stations went offline; only coming back on after a month of inactivity. The man was one of the few homesteaders in the area who preferred to live off of the land; only going into town for supplies when absolutely necessary. This allowed him to evade the entirety of the chaos happening in town and across the nation. It was a tactic that served him well several years prior during Covid.<br />
<br />
He did see several furries during the winter months in his simple cabin; opting to steer clear of them as they like him hunted the woods for game. He was quite surprised to see a common gray squirrel fury drawing back a compound bow and shooting a large bull moose dead with a single shot. He wanted to watch the individual harvest the animal but at the time was checking his traps. This was during the winter when he was after Mink and Marten; the marten being a cousin of the weasel. While the animals were small, their meat was rich in protein. Their fur would have fetched a fair price, unfortunately furies have no use for the hides as they don’t wear clothes; this caused a huge blow to his economic outlook as the money he would have made from trapping would have helped in purchasing his usual supplies.<br />
<br />
However it wasn’t the only time he saw the gray squirrel fury. He saw her many times in Demember; her because the fury’s chest had large fur covered breasts and he could have sworn he almost stumbled upon her taking a pee break. He hoped the fury didn’t see him; the news of them attacking humans in a lust filled haze, was something he found hard to believe, but didn’t want to find out. So he backed away as silently as he could while she was squatting by a tree. The sound of a twig snapping made her turn her head towards his direction; as if she already zeroed in on the source of the sound. Fortunately he was able to get away without any further incident.<br />
<br />
“Now this looks fresh,” the man talking to himself as he examines a spoor; looking at the small pellets of stool from a white tailed deer; the meat would keep him from going hungry for at least a month as he gets up and proceeds cautiously on the snow covered game trail.<br />
“Hope you aren’t a doe,” the man continuing his muttering as he checks his hunting rifle and ensures a bullet is in the chamber. “Last thing I need is a depleted game pool,” the man sighing as he tries to walk in through a heavy thicket; trying to minimize the noise he makes. He knew hunting was getting tougher as the furies were also hunting in this land; while not outright wiping out the local wildlife, they were robbing him of opportunities to claim some meat for the remainder of the season.<br />
<br />
It was a cold hour as he stalked his quarry; following the hoof prints and on occasion seeing spots where the deer stopped to forage or relieve themselves. Stopping as he spots up in the distance two large bucks and a doe; he readies himself by raising his rifle.<br />
“Only need the one,” he mutters quietly as he aims and fires.<br />
<br />
CRACK!!!!<br />
<br />
The sound of his rifle split the air with a cacophony of noise that made any creature scatter to the four winds. Save the deer that lay dead a few yards away; his shot tearing through the buck’s heart and killing it instantly. The man sighs in relief as he stows his rifle and begins to field dress his prize. Plunging a large serrated blade into the animal he quickly cuts open the animal and removes it gut and intestines. He needs to hurry as this is bear country and a hungry grizzly would take this deer from him if he wasn’t careful.<br />
<br />
“You sure do make a lot of noise.”<br />
The man whips around with his knife in hand only to see the gray squirrel fury behind him. Her bow is stowed but that doesn’t mean he wasn’t going to let his guard down.<br />
“This is my buck,” the man glaring; “get your own.”<br />
“Relax,” the squirrel fury waving him off with a paw hand; “I already have meat. Got a wolf the other day, so I’m good for the moment.”<br />
“You eat meat,” the man looking at the fury oddly; “I thought squirrels ate nuts and berries.”<br />
“Mundane squirrels yes,” the fury chuckling; “we furies like you humans are omnivores. We can eat anything. Assuming it doesn’t try to eat us back.”<br />
“Then leave me be,” the man going back to harvesting the deer and stowing the meat in his back pack; “I got no quarrel with you.”<br />
“Would if I could,” the squirrel fury smiling through her muzzle; “like you, I live alone. Plus we have been running into each other a lot.”<br />
“I wouldn’t know,” the man doing his best not admit he has seen her quite a bit of late.<br />
<br />
“I caught you watching me take a piss,” the squirrel fury approaching the wary man; keeping her hand paws visible so as not to appear aggressive; “the twig snapping gave you away. Plus I have been watching you and smelling you.”<br />
“Smelling me,” the man debating whether to reach for his rifle; “are you stalking me?”<br />
The squirrel fury laughing; “if i was, you would never know. You smell because it’s been a while since you bathed. This nose,” the squirrel fury tapping her snout with a clawed finger; “isn’t just for show.”<br />
<br />
“My cabin doesn’t have running water or a shower,” the man grunting as he slings the hundred pounds of meat over his shoulder. The remains of the buck he shot would be left for the scavenger of the forest.<br />
“I’m aware,” the squirrel fury smiling; “I visited you place while you were out. Don’t worry, I didn’t break in; I’m not a thief. I have no interest in the Mink pelts you have,” the squirrel fury adding; “but I am interested in you. If you’d like,” as she gets closer to the still wary man; “we could walk together as you head back home.”<br />
“No offense,” the man glaring; his stare causing the female to back off; “I just don’t trust you.”<br />
“That’s fair,” the anthro squirrel nodding; “but the wolf I killed had friends. That pack has been sniffing about as of late. Strength in numbers and they might catch the scent of your kill.”<br />
<br />
*********<br />
<br />
<br />
As they walked through the woods back to his place, the man found out that the squirrel girl once worked part time at a gas station. The money she earned to help out her mother who she was living with at the time. The fury flu hit her and her mother last November, turning here into the anthro squirrel she now is while her mother who was suffering from emphysema due to her heavy smoking was not so lucky. Being alone and running on pure instinct, she ran into the woods just as the whole town was going crazy; she has been coming and going to the woods and town for the past several months since. She learned how to shoot a bow from her father who died in a rigging accident in the Alberta Oilsands several years ago and has been using her archery skills to survive since the fury pandemic began.<br />
<br />
“I saw you take down a thousand pound moose once,” the man speaking; “how did you harvest it without a knife or a backpack?”<br />
“Easy,” the squirrel girl grinning as the runes on her wrists glow; “magic gave me the strength to haul that beast back to my mom’s place. Now my place I guess,” the girl sighing. “My neighbors helped me do what you did to that deer and we ate fairly well for the several weeks afterwards.”<br />
“Oh you shared your haul,” the man raising an eyebrow in curiosity; “most people are selfish.”<br />
“A human by nature is selfish, yes,” the squirrel fury responding; “but we furies have been working together to keep society running. We don’t have the time or luxury for selfish desires at the moment. There is still too much strife in the world going on by your kind at the moment.”<br />
“I may be human,” the man stopping as he adjusts the weight on his back; “but that doesn’t mean I agree with all the ill that is going on. It’s why I’m out here, alone and by myself.”<br />
“Sarah,” the squirrel fury speaking; “my name is Sarah.”<br />
“Adam,” the man responding with his name in return as they arrive at his simple log cabin.<br />
<br />
“Well I hope to see you again,” Sarah was about to kiss him, but held back for the moment. She thought to herself, that if he was the one for her; then it should be a special moment between the two if she was going to infect him with the fury virus and change him.<br />
“We’ll probably run into each other,” Adam removing his back pack full of deer meat and removing his rifle and placing it by the door to his cabin. He notices Sarah’s apprehension to the fire arm as he was handling it. “Something wrong?”<br />
“Just as we have an aversion to clothing,” Sarah gritting her teeth; “we are not fans of guns either.”<br />
“But a bow is fine,” Adam looking at the weapon and quiver she has stowed on her back.<br />
“Bows don’t make noise that hurt our ears,” Sarah answering; “Rifles, shotguns and pistols on the other paw, do.”<br />
“Fair point,” Adam nodding; “but my rifle helps me survive these woods.”<br />
<br />
Sarah was about to argue about a bow being just as effective, when a low howl could be heard followed by several others.<br />
“Shit,” Sarah getting her bow ready; “the wolf pack I was worried about. You need to stow that meat fast and get someplace high.”<br />
“I have a tree stand by my out house,” Adam tossing his backpack in the cabin and grabbing his rifle; “wolves can’t climb trees.”<br />
Sarah nods as she leaps onto the roof of Adam’s cabin; her runes glowing as she leaps again and takes a high spot on a large bough of the nearby elm.<br />
<br />
Adam quickly scrambles to his tree stand as the howling of the wolves gets louder and closer. He gets there just as blur of grey fur flashes where he was standing moments ago. Clambering up he sees at least seven wolves all circling his cabin.<br />
“Buggers have the scent of my kill,” Adam readying his rifle; lining up a shot he fires his weapon dropping a wolf dead in it’s tracks.<br />
“Fuck that’s loud,” Sarah screaming; as she misses her shot.<br />
“Can’t be helped,” Adam shouting back as he lines up another shot and shoots his second wolf dead.<br />
<br />
Sarah winces as the second rifle shot rings out; causing her to wince in pain as she struggles not to let her next arrow fly wildly. These wolves must be desperate because they have yet to flee after losing two to bullets. She manages to take aim with her bow and buries the shaft into a black furred wolf that was trying to climb the tree Adam was on.<br />
“Cover your ears,” Adam shouts as he shoots at another wolf but misses.<br />
“Thank you for the warning,” Sarah able to get her bearing as she loses another arrow. “That’s the fourth wolf felled,” Sarah shouting; “you’d think they would have given up by now.”<br />
“They must be desperate,” Adam lining up his fourth shot and shooting a wolf that looks like it was limping.<br />
“Gods that gun is loud,” Sarah taking out the sixth wolf as her ears are ringing.<br />
“I’m out of ammo,” Adam looking for another rifle clip and not finding the spare he had packed earlier.<br />
“I got the last one” Sarah taking a bead on the seventh wolf whose was pawing at the cabin door. Her arrow striking the beast and pinning it to the door as it enters its death throes.<br />
<br />
“Looks like they were desperate,” Adam looking at how emaciated the wolf pack was after he climbed down from his tree stand; “I think this one was wounded.” Adam examining the wolf that he noticed was limping; confirming his suspicions as he spots a broken arrow shaft protruding from the wolf’s left flank.<br />
“Not my shaft,” Sarah comparing her shaft to the one in the dead animal.<br />
“I wasn’t implying,” Adam rolling his eyes as he sees the spare ammo clip by the cabin door. It fell out when he tossed his meat inside and rushed to his tree stand. “But I do have to thank you for your help,” Adam pulling the arrow from the wolf pinned to his door. “You are more than welcome to take the wolves back to town and share the meat with everyone. I have all I need from the buck I got earlier.”<br />
“I could think of another way you can thank me for my help,” Sarah feeling a flush of arousal after a thrilling moment of life over death.<br />
<br />
Before Adam could react, Sarah pounced him and was already jamming her tongue down his throat. His struggles to get her off him soon turned to hands rubbing up and down her fury body as the virus raced through his body and eroded what ever resistance he had.<br />
“Let’s get you out of those clothes,” Sarah pulling back as Adam’s eyes are glazed over with lust and desire as Sarah murmurs her words to him.<br />
“Yes,” Adam exhaling deeply; Sarah’s runes glowing as his clothes dissolve into nothing, leaving him naked in the frigid winter air with a massive erection.<br />
<br />
Sarah takes a few steps back before turning around. Dropping on all fours, she presents her fury entrance to Adam, inviting him to explore her body more fully. She moaned loudly as she felt Adam’s cock penetrate her folds; ravaging her entrance, while his balls swung wildly; slapping her fury body and her breasts swung in time to his thrusting. More... her mind could only focus on how good it felt having the virile male fill her up, rutting her like a wild animal.<br />
<br />
Lost in the haze thanks to the fury virus, Adam takes no notice of his feet shifting; his ankles pushing up as he begins to assume a digitigrade stance. Black fur spreading rapidly over his body; patchy at first but soon it covered every inch of him. A wolfish tail exploding out from his rear end, wagging furiously as he continued to pound the willing female he has mounted below him. His face pushing out into a muzzle, as his nose become lupine. His ears migrating to the top of his head, becoming triangular.<br />
<br />
Feeling his penis change, Adam starts to grunt as his knot swells and is swallowed by Sarah’s entrance; locking the two together and eliciting a gasp from her. His thrusting soon became fast and short as he worked towards his climax; instinctively biting one of Sarah’s ears as he makes one final thrust and presses his body as close to hers as possible. The feeling of his shaft exploding within the tight confines of her tunnel; feeling her clamp and milk him of his seed. Adam moans as his tongue lolls out of his head. Opening his eyes as they turn from brown to a menacing yellow; just as magic runes appear on his wrists and ankles.<br />
<br />
“I knew you would make for a perfect mate,” Sarah panting as her body shudders with her orgasm. “I knew the moment I caught you watching me pee.”<br />
“So you were stalking me,” Adam commenting; unable to move as his knot is keeping the two together and he can still feel his balls pumping his sperm into Sarah’s hungry womb.<br />
“Smell like I sound, I&#39;m lost in a crowd,” Sarah starts singing; as she feel’s Adam’s seed getting pumped into her tapering off<br />
“And I’m hungry like the wolf,” Adam finishing the refrain as he is familiar with that particular synth pop hit from the eighties.<br />
“And you look like one as well,” Sarah turning her head to get a look at Adam as best she can; “how do you feel?”<br />
“I feel great,” Adam answering with a satisfying sigh; drinking in the smells and sounds of the forest. Smells he could never pick up with his human nose, and sounds that his dull human ears could never discern.</p>
