<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle paused for a second. Jen clearly wasn’t taking this very seriously. “Hey, Jen, you do contortions as part of your cheer routine, right?”<br />
<br />
“I guess so, yeah, it helps with flexibility. What does this have to do with anything, exactly?”<br />
<br />
“Well, your time’s up, so you get both.”<br />
<br />
“There’s no way it’s real anyways, so go ahead.”<br />
<br />
Ok, for your dare, I dare you to fold yourself into the tightest pretzel you can manage. Arms folded behind your back, stomach on the ground, tits on the floor, back curled, knees on either side of your head, almost touching the ground, etc. Really give it all you got, and then some. Tuck your head back too, so you really look like a ball. <br />
<br />
For your transformation, you’ll first become inhumanly flexible so you’re able to go even tighter than what should be possible, which will occur as you try to fold. Then, once you’ve finished, you’ll become totally comfortable in this pose. Every bodily function will work just fine despite your current pose. Your flexibility will then be flipped on its head, and you’ll lose your new flexibility you gained when folding. Instead, it will work in reverse. Whenever you try to unfold, the closer you get to normal the more strained you will feel, and if you fully unfold, it will feel like what your new default pose *should* feel like. So trying to stand and walk, you’ll feel like you’re doing the most absurd stretch imaginable. Even trying to move your arms out from behind your back will be difficult, like trying to do the splits. Once your transformation is complete the dare will be nullified. Good luck! *click*<br />
<br />
Before Jen even had time to react, she unwillingly dropped the phone and fell to the floor. Her arms and legs moved all on their own, and she quickly realized that the curse was real. She began screaming for help as her she crossed her arms behind her back, legs raising and back curling, her spine popping and cracking as it contorted further than anything she’d ever practiced. The pain was immense and mounting, but she had no control over her muscles whatsoever. Further and further she contorted, till her feet wandered into her field of vision from above. Slowly they touched the floor, before parting to each side as she folded further. She was nearly unconscious from pain, as she felt her knees inch closer to the ground, but before they did, she passed out. <br />
<br />
<br />
As she woke up, the first thing she noticed was the total absence of the pain she’d been feeling before. Second, she noticed she could feel her thighs sandwiching her head from above, as well as her head resting between them. It was a truly alien feeling, and she could also feel her elbows pressing against her ass cheeks, which were all neatly folded inside of her compact form. She tried extracting her arms from behind her, but was stopped by the pressure holding them in place. She sat there for a while, trying to contemplate what exactly to do. First she did the only thing that came to mind, and tried unfolding as hard as she could. It was painful, but slowly she began to lift her legs, raising her knees from their resting place just above the floor, pressure mounting till she had her feet flat on the floor, which was already quite painful. She tried pushing off, only to gasp as the pain spiked. Pushing forward in spite of this, she was able to lift her legs up into the air, her whole back on fire as she desperately kicked at the air trying to straighten it. Exhausted, she finally gave in, her body snapping back like a spring, slamming her feet back down, slowly “relaxing” back into a ball. She cried in anguish, tears filling her eyes. <br />
<br />
<br />
She must have sat there for 20 minutes, not daring to move any more. Eventually, she resolved herself to try and move, in the only way she could think of. Getting her legs into a crouched position, she pushed herself forward, tipping over and completing a full somersault, coming to rest in the pose she started in. Repeating this a few times, she managed to exit her room and hit the far wall, leaving her stuck face down. Panicking, she flailed her legs, unable to move herself. She slid her legs until they were pressing on her shoulders, and pushed out with all her might, pushing off the floor with her face as well. It was excruciating, but she managed to flip herself, landing back with her head once again facing the ceiling. <br />
<br />
She decided that rolling was too risky, instead shuffling along on her belly until she reached the edge of the stairs. Which brought on a whole new issue: how was she going to get down the stairs?<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The plan was simple. Waddle over to the stairs, gingerly stretch one leg and walk down sideways. Just put one foot out and…. uh oh.<br />
<br />
Inevitably, Jen began to tumble sideways, rolling over and over and smacking her face against the floor painfully. <br />
<br />
Battered, bruised, and utterly humiliated, Jen looked up, surprised to see her maid, Martha, towering above her. “I thought it was your day off?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t be absurd, Jen, I don’t get a day off, remember? Who else would fix breakfast or carry you to the bus?”<br />
<br />
Breakfast was delicious, of course, though being spoon fed only added to her humiliation. Being picked up was a strange experience in her condition, too. <br />
<br />
As the bus arrived, Martha handed Jen off to one of her friends, who brought her to her seat. This was going to be an interesting day, that’s for sure.</p>
