<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A small smirk spreading across Doug&#39;s face as he looked at Coach Dick. He was going to put this old bigot in his place. While he had considered fifth grade, giving his siblings a new friend, he knew Dickie needed a very hard reset. &quot;Enjoy preschool asshole,&quot; he whispered as the coin began to glow.<br />
<br />
Dick seemed to pause as the wish began to take effect. Doug noting the man&#39;s hair as he now raced back in age. At first it was hard to tell the changes but as Dick crept closer to 50 he began to notice blond hair slowly but surely overtake the grey. Doug was shocked though to watch the large man&#39;s body firm up though as he grew younger. The man&#39;s chest swelled under his polo shirt, Doug watching as the solid gut retracted slightly. <br />
<br />
As Dick dipped below 50, Doug watched the man&#39;s body continue to strengthen. Doug&#39;s adult nine had never met Dick when he was younger. Gazing at the man, he couldn&#39;t believe what a mountain of a specimen he was. Dick must have been a powerlifter in his younger days. Doug watching as his gut flattened, his chest and arms swelling even larger. Dicks polo shirt looked close to bursting, his muscular body firming as his vitality returned. Hitting his 40th birthday, Doug noted a few stray greys in his golden blond air, Dicks face smoothing as the deep wrinkles faded. <br />
<br />
Gazing at the 30 year old man, Doug now found his clothing even more ridiculous than when he was in his 60s. Dicks clothes looked almost painted on his body, the mans massive chest and arms straining the polo shirt to such a degree that Doug could make out the definition of the man&#39;s muscles. Even his legs were massive, his thighs and calfs rippling with thick muscle. As odd as it seemed, Doug for a moment thought Dicks shirts had shrank before realizing that the muscle was so large it was causing the shorts to ride up on the man. Finally Doug noticed the pin star mustache and grey eyes of Coach Dick, his eyes gleaming with intensity while the mustache had become a thick, golden blond.<br />
<br />
As Dick retreated to 20, Doug began to notice the man&#39;s muscles finally begin to degrade. Dicks shorts and shirt seemed to relax, no longer looking close to tearing as he grew younger. Although Dicks physique was still impressive, he no longer had a Hulk like physique. Dicks face continued to smooth, the grey completely vanishing from the blond hair of the man. At 20 Doug beheld a giant of a man, nowhere near as bulky as he would be in a decade but possessing a large muscular body with far better definition than he had seen before. Dick now looked like more a body builder than a power lifter. <br />
<br />
Now the changes were Dick were truely becoming astounding as the man reentered his teens. Doug watched as the definition of the man&#39;s physique began to wither, his face beginning to round as he crept closer to adolescence. Exiting college and returning to high school, Doug watched as Dicks mustache began to thin, slowly vanishing from the man&#39;s lip.  Doug now watched as Dick began to lose height as he went from 16 to 15, the man losing a couple of inches while his muscles continued to thin. As Dick became a Freshman, Doug noted the man now teen was a rather large kid with only the beginnings of the massive physique he would possess as an adult.<br />
<br />
Leaving high school behind, Dick continued to grow smaller. Doug watched as Dicks mustache faded, going from pencil thin, to barely their wisp, to finally receding into his rounding face. Dicks height and muscles continued to erode, Doug watching as the teen shrank in spurts, losing several inches with the loss of years. Dicks muscles continued to fade, losing definition. As Dick went from 13 to 12, Doug beheld a large boy with a round face, his blond growing out becoming shaggy.<br />
<br />
Dicks face continued to round as he raced backwards through elementary school. The boy shrinking quickly, taking on a slightly chunky look. Dicks eyes seemed to glint with a mischievous energy, his face rounding as her hair grew out. Now a boy of 10, Doug glanced at the kid, judging him to be a mischievous if not happy child. The formerly massive adult now standing perhaps 4 and a half feet tall with wild blond hair.<br />
<br />
Dick continued to shrink, the child&#39;s eyes growing wide with wonder as he grew younger. Dropping below 4 feet tall, Doug gazed at the first grader as he raced towards kindergarten. Baby fat now appeared on the boy, his hair healthy and thick with a round innocent face. First grade was now something to look forward too, the 5 year old growing even smaller, his face shifting slightly from later to young childhood.<br />
<br />
As the changes completed, Doug gawked at the 4 year old boy standing on the field. Dick was tiny now, a precocious blond haired preschooler with a generous amount of baby fat littering his tiny body. Dicks face had shifted, gone was the stern adult replaced with a round innocent face. Doug couldn&#39;t believe how small Dick was now, standing maybe 3 and a half feet tall. He was big for a preschooler but obviously much smaller than what Doug was accustomed too.<br />
<br />
Dicks clothing now shifted, thw polo shirt and shorts transforming becoming a superman tahirt with a pair of sturdy jeans. The child&#39;s sneakers shrinking down into velcro complete with light up heel. Dick now blinked, an innocent smile spreading across his face as he raced towards the Cheer Squad. Nancy and Doug gawked at the child as memories formed of their new reality.<br />
<br />
Dickie, (they really needed a better nickname for the boy), was the unofficial mascot of the Cheer Squad. Nancy often times would bring the boy to practice when a sitter wasn&#39;t available. Doug and Nancy now realizing that she wasn&#39;t late to practice because she stopped to talk with Doug. She was late because she needed to pickup her little brother from preschool.<br />
<br />
As the Cheer Squad now fawned over the adorable little boy, Nancy and Doug exchanged an astonished look. Neither one believing the changes Doug had created.</p>
