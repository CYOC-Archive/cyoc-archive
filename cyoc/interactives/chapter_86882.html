<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You felt a bit of relief when Elizabeth referred to you as &quot;brother.&quot; It made you feel closer to Elizabeth in more ways than what she had tried earlier in urging you to accept being a siren. Of course much of it was probably the result of her realizing that Selene was your wife and that your existence as a siren hurt Selene as well. Some of it was a strange feeling, as while you had felt close to friends and to Selene, something about this felt closer and in many ways better. Part of you wondered if you&#39;d still get this feeling when you were human again or if these sorts of feelings were exclusive only to sirens and that once you became human again that ability would be lost. Another part of your mind was even surprised by how much you were accepting many of these small things. It dwelt on a fear that you mind would change and by the time Selene was ready to change you back, you wouldn&#39;t want to change back. Thankfully, the fact that that thought was still there gave you the impression that you&#39;d be able to resist it and try to be human.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Elizabeth,&quot; you commented as you hugged her, &quot;as I said... you&#39;ve tried to be helpful and supportive. Something anyone would want in a sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the way sirens are,&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;We&#39;re close to our sisters in our sisterhoods. We help each other, support each other, live together and do almost everything together, and within our sisterhoods... we feel close and can at times sense the moods of our sisters. I could feel that you and Selene both wish to restore your human form... and... well... I&#39;d personally prefer you to remain a sister... but within our present sisterhood, I&#39;m not only outvoted but I can feel the pain that both you and Selene feel. Therefore, I&#39;m willing to do what I can to make you feel better... even if it means you becoming a man again... being a brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brothers aren&#39;t necessarily a bad thing,&quot; you told her.<br />
<br />
You heard the clicking of one of the house&#39;s door locks being turned and looked to see that Selene had gone to lock the doors. When she returned, she made it clear that she had heard you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither Liz nor I would know,&quot; Selene gave a weak smile, &quot;sirens are always female... it&#39;s another reason why we&#39;ve been so closely tied to humanity. We need human males in order to reproduce...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But your children are always female,&quot; you finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;And complete sirens,&quot; Selene nodded, &quot;the notion of having a brother has never occurred before that I know of and will only come because of our bond of love... and thus it will be a first for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll enjoy it,&quot; you commented.<br />
<br />
Selene smiled and nodded and lead both you and Elizabeth toward your bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;The doors are locked?&quot; you then asked to Selene.<br />
<br />
&quot;Locked?&quot; Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A method humans use to protect their homes and vehicles,&quot; Selene explained to Elizabeth, &quot;and yes I locked the doors. While I don&#39;t think Florencia will follow you two... it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if she knows where we live. With the doors locked we should be safe for tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
That gave you some confidence, though you knew full well that in the morning you&#39;d be facing a long swim, being in mermaid form again and for a few days, and then eating another person. Not to mention the fact that you&#39;d probably need to help your heavily pregnant wife seduce a different man so that she could feed on him. It was all frustrating, and made you extremely hopeful that this Council would do what Selene said they would do.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, where will we sleep?&quot; Elizabeth asked after a moment as the three of you reached the bedroom door.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a bed,&quot; Selene said as she opened the door to reveal the bedroom to Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
The decor was relatively modest, but it was dominated by a large bed that was as tall as your hips presently were. Elizabeth looked at it and then ran her hands along the blue sheets that covered the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;This feels soft,&quot; she stated, sounding in awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s supposed to,&quot; you chuckled as you turned to a wooden dresser and began to look through it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t sleep in water, Selene?&quot; Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... our tub is more than big enough... but I can&#39;t sleep with my husband if I&#39;m in the bathtub all night,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;and since I don&#39;t want to stress out Michelle any more than what has already stressed her, I&#39;d think it best that we sleep in the bed tonight. We&#39;ll all get a good look at each other&#39;s tails tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Elizabeth answered.<br />
<br />
You looked over your shoulder to watch Selene lead Elizabeth to a nearby closet. You heard the clicking of the closet door opening and your wife&#39;s footsteps going inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, Liz, I&#39;ll help you find some sleepwear for tonight,&quot; Selene spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sleepwear?&quot; Elizabeth asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t sleep in the cloths we wear every day,&quot; you told her, &quot;some cloths are just made for sleeping in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes no sense,&quot; Elizabeth retorted, &quot;if you&#39;re going to wear cloths, wear them all the time. If not... go naked like sirens do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some humans do sleep in the buff... shoot... some never wear clothes at all,&quot; you replied as you pulled off the dirty shirt that you had pulled out of the trunk, &quot;but I was never one of those humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re beautiful know... and fairly handsome when you were a man,&quot; Elizabeth answered, &quot;wouldn&#39;t you want to share that beauty with others?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans generally do that privately,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;at least GOOD humans do. The ones that don&#39;t are usually the sleazes that sirens have traditionally fed on.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made you think back to the two men you had fed on earlier in the day as you pulled on a white cotton tee-shirt and began fishing through another drawer for a pair of boxers. Once you had a pair on you turned to see Selene leading Elizabeth out of the closet. The blond siren was presently wearing one of Selene&#39;s nighties, which was pink in color and had lace decorations in the design. The fact that it was practically see through gave you a good idea on what the gown covered, and would have gotten a rise out of you if you were male. Instead, you felt yourself beginning to feel a bit warm between your legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I like this,&quot; Elizabeth commented, &quot;It matches my tail. What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
That made you blink. You hadn&#39;t really expected a question of that sort, though you probably should have as you and Selene were likely introducing many human concepts that Elizabeth didn&#39;t see in the ocean.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks very nice,&quot; you commented, &quot;though... I might be under obligation to say Selene looks better in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As her... husband?&quot; Elizabeth wondered, &quot;but as part of her sisterhood... even as a man... wouldn&#39;t you share her with your sisterhood?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Human concepts of dating are different from ours,&quot; Selene told her as she came out in a fairly plain cotton nightgown, &quot;there are some groups that are polygamous and would share things, but Michael isn&#39;t. Remember that since humans have both male and female genders, they use brother and sister to refer to biological family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Elizabeth actually looked down, &quot;I suppose you&#39;ll want me to sleep somewhere else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Selene hugged Elizabeth to her, &quot;You can be in the bed with us as we will only be sleeping tonight and having you here... well it makes me feel a bit better after being alone and away from the rest of the sisterhood for so long. I love Michael and I love being with him...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you needed your sisters just the same?&quot; you asked as Selene climbed up onto the bed and settled into the middle of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Selene answered, &quot;and part of me longs to have my sisters close to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth was quick to climb up onto the bed and lay down beside Selene, quickly hugging her. Selene then turned to you as she waited.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I won&#39;t be a sister forever,&quot; you spoke as you climbed up onto the bed on the other side of Selene, &quot;I&#39;ll be your husband again and Elizabeth&#39;s brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
No sooner had you pulled the covers over you that Selene pulled you into a hug as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I need that to happen too,&quot; Selene answered, as the three of you soon fell asleep in that hug.</p>
