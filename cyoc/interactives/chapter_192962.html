<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sandra decided she needed to make a few changes to young Leo, seeing as the boy represented a bit of a lapse in her decision process. She had trusted that the rule about keeping the weightlifters in there age 16 and older would be enforced a little better. But she supposed that laxity was to be expected. Well, she was going to have to do something about that. It&#39;d be a bit faster than her preferred style, but she decided to give Leo a few years more of experience before letting him experience the transformative effects of the gym...<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
As Leo went ahead to his swim class, standing at the edge of the indoor pool, the young boy started to feel a very peculiar sensation ripple through his body. He bit his lip, wondering what it was. He had never quite felt anything like it. &quot;Leo! Go ahead in the pool!&quot; And there was his swimming instructor urging him to get in the pool. The guy had muscular, strong pectorals standing out through his tight, short-sleeved shirt, and a strong if untoned core resting beneath those monster pecs. Leo told himself one day he wanted to get strong like the lifeguard guy.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t know that that day would be today.<br />
<br />
The Italian boy leaped into the water with aplomb, trying to be bold so that he didn&#39;t come off as too shy or apprehensive. But as he did and impacted the water, he felt his arms and legs seem to twinge and grow, making the depth of the pool a little less intimidating. He wondered if the pool wasn&#39;t really as deep as he thought it was. Leo shook his head as his features slightly matured, probably, probably. Leo started doing some breaststroke as he heard his instructor shout for that - even as he did, his shoulders started to grow stronger, broader, and wider with age.<br />
<br />
By the time he completed four laps back and forth, Leo felt very odd indeed - but he figured it might just be the exertion and possibly the water. Maybe chlorine in the water was just making him feel weird. As he kicked longer, stronger legs, he wondered if the next exercise would be more intensive. Toward the end there for whatever reason the swimming got pretty easy.<br />
<br />
He regretted his contemplation when he was instructed to do some butterfly stroke. His arms and shoulders burned as he started doing four laps at this type of swimming - not even seeing his biceps, forearms and triceps swelling with muscle and growing a bit more. His increasingly teenage face bobbed above the water as he went on. He didn&#39;t want to complain, but he was really having some trouble with this. &quot;Hey...Hey! Uh, do you have any tips for this?&quot; Why was his voice starting to crack and sound so weird?<br />
<br />
Could getting water down his throat explain it? Leo briefly contemplated it before shaking his head and going on when the instructor gave him some tips.<br />
<br />
Again as it went on Leo found himself increasingly doing it without too much hassle. It was like he just needed to acclimate before he got it. And then he <i>really</i> got it. By the time he was done Leo was feeling pretty proud of himself. Proud of himself enough that he was able and willing to just tread water and put his arms up behind his head. &quot;Wow, swimming feels so good!&quot; Again, Leo wondered why his voice sounded so off. It sounded deeper now.<br />
<br />
Not that Leo could even know how old he was at this rate. Physically at least.<br />
<br />
That was when he saw her. His eyes widened, and his newly hormone laden body went into overdrive. She was plain by most standards, but she had a pretty face and a nice smile and long hair, and Leo found himself immediately smitten. He was used to thinking girls had cooties, but he was entirely willing to chance such an &quot;infection&quot; now. He almost forgot to tread water as he took in the beautiful brunette, and had to immediately start treading again as his glutes pumped with muscle.<br />
<br />
Leo couldn&#39;t help himself - she was doing things to him that his mindset as of then didn&#39;t comprehend. He was distinctly aware of what rested between his legs, aching and larger than it had ever been. He blushed, something telling him that displaying what he had down there in public was embarrassing. And...wait. Was he always wearing this swimsuit? It seemed different from the one he went into the pool with. <br />
<br />
Leo felt a yawning sense of Deja Vu. He was feeling kind of weird. He needed to get out of the pool. &quot;Hey, uh,&quot; Leo started, again wondering about his voice, &quot;Mr. Instructor, can I uh, can I get out now? I&#39;m feeling pretty worked out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leo, I know you just wanna get done to go chat with her,&quot; his instructor said with a chuckle, &quot;Just one more exercise and then you can go flirt to your heart&#39;s content.&quot; Something again about that made Leo feel somewhat secure and reassured. Like it was something to really look forward to. Even though everything seemed so different, so unusual, and Leo felt so weirdly strong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me some underwater laps, Leo. Let&#39;s check that endurance.&quot; And so that was his last swimming exercise for the day. Underwater laps. Leo wondered outright if he would come up the same as he went under. He could already tell, looking down at his chest, that things were really egregiously different right now. He had never seen his chest looking like that, or the six tight grooves on his stomach. Or indeed, how long he was now - no, how TALL he was now!<br />
<br />
Leo took a breath, and plunged. He could feel it washing over him. The waters of the pool, and the transformation. He winced, and continued on despite his own reservations. His newly forming masculine pride demanding he finish what he started, or otherwise, that pretty young woman who was so interesting to him would think he was a wimp! And there were many things Leo was, but a wimp was not one of them!<br />
<br />
He swam with aplomb, growing tighter and leaner over time, his haircut trimming down to a crew cut and his natural Italian body hair trimming down as he swam. He only had a single little bush at his groin, which bulged with interest and anticipation. He could find himself treading underwater so much easier. Leo had no idea how old he was now, or indeed what had happened to him, but there was no question about it.<br />
<br />
This - however and whatever he was now - it was so much easier to swim like this than it was earlier. It actually made him feel a sort of passion for swimming. By the time he got done and pulled himself out of the pool, he was made aware of just how much had changed. He outright gaped at the sight in the windows by the entrance to the pool. His mouth hung open as he saw his tight little swim trunks, his six foot two inch height, and his tight, toned and muscular swimmer&#39;s build.<br />
<br />
Dripping wet, confused, and kind of aroused, the newly minted swimmer Leo had been ill-prepared for when the object of his fixation approached him somewhat shyly, and said, &quot;Hey, you uh, you swim really, really well. Are you like, training for anything in particular?&quot;<br />
<br />
Leo felt a sense of surprise ripple through him as his mind seemed to supply him with an answer, &quot;Well, I&#39;d like to make the Olympics. Beat Phelps&#39; record. But I&#39;ve got a lot of work to do here first.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I mean, I know you&#39;re great at swimming and all, but the Olympics...&quot; She seemed to take this as an opportunity and moved up closer to him, making Leo blush a little bit. She detected this right away, and asked him, &quot;Have you...ever had a girlfriend before?&quot; Leo breathed harshly, he didn&#39;t even know before today what a girlfriend was, but now he was just awash in knowledge, feeling so suddenly like he needed one, he needed this and that and to keep training - aww fuck what was going on here?<br />
<br />
&quot;I uhh, not really, no,&quot; Leo answered with a nervous smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe...I could be your first. My name&#39;s Melissa.&quot; She introduced herself, and Leo lazily smiled as he started repeating her name internally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh, uh okay...so uh, what does being my girlfriend mean?&quot; Leo asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s start with a kiss.&quot; And when she went up on Leo and kissed him, his hormones went wild. Here he was, kissing some young woman, after changing so much, growing so much - his body was screaming at him to do things. Things he barely knew about. But things he adhered to, as he put a hand on her shoulder, letting her kiss him. His manhood pounded erect in his trunks...and for her part, it seemed Melissa noticed.<br />
<br />
And she pressed herself up against him. Leo almost yelped from how that felt. But for now he went with what his new body, his developing new mentality, told him was the thing to do next. He barely understood it, but damn it felt so good. Their make out was standard for Melissa, but completely mindblowing for the newly grown Leo. By the time she pulled away and said, &quot;See you later! I have to finish my workout!&quot; Leo just about wanted to chase after her, and hopefully kiss her again.<br />
<br />
Wait, wait, he told himself, managing to regain control.<br />
<br />
He needed to figure out for himself why all this happened. What had happened to him, and why. It wasn&#39;t like he had many complaints. But it was alarming nonetheless for the sheer fact that it happened at all. W-Would his dad even recognize him? He needed to find his dad. What if something had changed about him too? Leo hurried along and found himself going to and retrieving clothes and accessories he was not familiar with from a locker by the pool.<br />
<br />
A polo shirt, jeans, black boxers, and a towel to dry off with.<br />
<br />
By the time Leo was all dried off and dressed again, he wondered if there was anything happening here that was so momentous. Could his dad have been subject to a similar transformation? Not knowing that his own transformation was unusual in the fact it was directly induced rather than passively induced, he hurried on out to try and find his dad. There had to be some explanation here, too. Maybe he could find his way toward that as well!</p>
