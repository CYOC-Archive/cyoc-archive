<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The princess, once so dainty, so frightened, so delicate, and respected for her restraint and willingness to consider matters from both sides, has changed drastically. Roxanne&#39;s family spent so long pampering their beloved daughter for the throne, but now she was anything but, or shall we say.... he. The demoness stretched out her arms and legs, yawning as she loomed over the different adventurers on their foolish errand for a now nonexistent individual, and now she snapped her fingers to call to her latest servant.<br />
<br />
The sound of heavy footsteps could be heard from behind the demoness, and a large dragon approached her with a metal collar around his neck, and broken shackles around his ankles. The dragon was covered from head to tail in amber scales that were covered in dirt, grease, mud, and even its own feces. His chest scales were gold, and so were his horns and claws, but those too were covered in filth. The beast’s head was held low as if trying to hide whatever was behind it, but it didn’t take a genius to see two unsheathed cocks with pre bubbling at the tip of each.<br />
<br />
The moment the demoness saw the dragon she couldn’t help, but start laughing at it which made the dragon blush and look puzzled. The demoness then got up from her throne and walked up to the reptile, who was about double the size of a race horse, and she placed her hand under his chin and turned his face up towards hers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Has my new boy been getting dirty again?&quot; The demoness scoffed with a smug look on her face.<br />
<br />
The dragon was silent, he looked away from the demoness and mumbled something, and the demoness paused for a moment and conjured up a ball of fire in her hand. &quot;Would you care to repeat that?!&quot; She exclaimed and suddenly the dragon’s face turned white with fear, and he stumbled back against the wall behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;OKAY IT WAS TOO HOT, SO I ROLLED IN THE MUD TO COOL OFF THEN I STARTED TO THINK ABOUT GIRLS SO I FOUND A SOFT PART AND PRETENDED IT WAS ONE. BUT IT WASN&#39;T MUD, BUT SHIT AND I....&quot; The dragon roared frantically then paused when he felt a relieving sensation in his groin, and he looked down to see himself pissing uncontrollably. After he stopped the dragon just let out a small whine as his cocks sheathed and said,&quot;...please don’t punish me for being horny...&quot;<br />
<br />
The demoness sighed and she pulled out a bottle and snapped her fingers and all of the vile yellow fluids spiraled up around the vial and collected into it. The demoness casually pulled out a cork and giggled as she sealed the bottle shut and said,&quot;Aw, no need to feel so small big guy, you’re just at that angsty where you make all sorts of idiotic decisions.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragon then let out a small whine and said,&quot;I’m not stupid though... right?&quot;<br />
<br />
The demoness then laughed and said,&quot;Oh of course not, even though you just tried to breed a pile of your own dung.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragon paused and looked up like he had to think about this, and he tilted his head towards the demoness and replied,&quot;Um... thank you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The demoness patted the dragon on the snout and replied,&quot;You’re welcome dearie, now make sure the next time you choose to lay your waste down that it isn’t in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I’ll try, b-but I c-can’t really hold it that well...&quot; The dragon muttered in response and the demoness laughed and said,&quot;You also should know better than to lie to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;L-Lie?! No! No, I promise on everything that I am I&#39;m h-&quot; The dragon began then the demoness shouted,&quot;Gay!&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragon’s face turned red, and his cocks peaked out from their sheath causing him to feel even more humiliated. &quot;Oh no...&quot; The dragon muttered under his breath and the demoness placed her hands on the dragon’s forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can’t hide it, if you were straight then I’d be raped by now, or at least seduced into riding those monsters in that sheath,&quot; The demoness said, and used her magic to make images of a large muscular drake with twice the girth of the dragon’s own appear in his head.<br />
<br />
The dragon zoned out as he watched his dream dragon walk closer and loom over him with his twin phalluses fully erect and with a sinister look on his face. Then the dragon heard his dream speak to him,&quot;You like what you see boy? Just one strong dragon like me doesn’t make for much, but together we could be so much more~&quot; The hypnotized dragon nodded and muttered,&quot;Y-Yeah...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why don’t you have a taste then big boy?&quot; The dreamy dragon replied and the hypnotized one stuck out his tongue and he could feel the flesh with his own tongue, and his own cocks became fully erect. However the demoness released the dragon from her trance and he found himself eagerly licking the demoness&#39;s pussy, and he paused lifting his head slowly with a combination of fear and disgust on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;U-Ummm....&quot; The dragon whimpered and the demoness smiled and said,&quot;Go ahead, by all means treat me just like that big strong drake in your mind, Rox.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragon, Rox, shook his head and covered his mouth as his stomach churned and vomit shot its way up his throat. Rox could feel the hot molten vomit in his mouth, and some of it oozed onto his claws in the form of molten magma. He managed to swallow it down after that with tears in his eyes, and he looked at the demoness and cried,&quot;WHY?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just trying to prove a point, nothing more, nothing less,&quot; The demoness giggled,&quot;Don’t worry my pet lets just call this our little secret from whoever your strapping husband will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I... Y-You.... oh fine! But don’t you dare do that again!&quot; Rox roared and the demoness laughed,&quot;Oh please, you’re a teddy bear with a dragon’s body. But not to worry, you’ll have new friends before too long, though... I can’t exactly promise they’ll be your.... &quot;type&quot; if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I CAN BURN YOU!! I CAN DEVOUR YOU WHOLE!!&quot; Rox protested in a desperate attempt to save what was left of his pride, but the demoness just shrugged and said,&quot;Bite me, or you can enjoy your new toy~&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH C&#39;MON, I AM NOT A WHELP WHO NEE-&quot; Rox turned his head and saw a massive stone pillar just bug enough for him to ease down onto, to his side. The shape of it resembled a veiny shaft with a mushroom head with a slit that was surrounded by an elevated moat like a fountain with two huge mounds that resembled Rox&#39;s own testicles.<br />
<br />
Rox was silent now as he turned towards the demoness, and she smiled back and said,&quot;What? A big boy like you should enjoy a toy like this. Now you don’t need to fuck your own shit like it’s a male’s rectum, even though you’ll probably never be in that situation. So, don’t you wanna try it out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rox had little to no restraint when it came to temptation and he sighed and said,&quot;Fine... I still don’t like you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we both know that you adore this, don’t you?&quot; The demoness replied and Rox looked at her and sighed,&quot;Sure... just... let me do my thing okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean masterbate,&quot; The demoness replied and Rox&#39;s cheeks grew warm and he sighed,&quot;Yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
Rox, once Roxanne, now the dirty beast that he is, is the polar opposite of what he once was. From a princess that would rule over millions, now a beast that was hunted to protect millions and with a sex drive that would produce millions in eggs. Roxanne was raised to be a ruler who made no mistake, but Rox was clumsy, antisocial, and dimwitted at times, with untamed instincts . Then finally Roxanne always dreamed to marry a nice strong prince, and Rox has that same wish, or at least very similar ones. But as a male this meant that his homosexuality was a weakness in royalty, and he would never be an heir for as long as that were true... which was always.<br />
<br />
As Rox marched towards the fountain it turned on, and steaming hot water started spewing from the very top of it, and he looked back at the demoness with an even brighter blush than before. However she was now more focuses on her victims, and Rox positioned his rectum over the geyser of the dick and thought to himself,&quot;Okay, this will be a first, but... fuck I need it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Then Rox brought himself down upon the stone cock fountain and groaned then sighed feeling the warmth of the steaming hot water in his rectum, and the long hard shaft. &quot;Sooooo goooood,&quot; Rox moaned as his twin cocks fully unsheathed, and he stretched his long neck down to lick them to clean, and for his own pleasure.<br />
<br />
The demoness smiled and said,&quot;Flattering,&quot; in a mocking manner, but Rox just ignored her and continued to pleasure himself. The demoness then loomed over her scrying bowl and muttered,&quot;Now... who shall I bring to us, and change first....?&quot;</p>
