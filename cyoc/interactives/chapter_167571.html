<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Elijah&#39;s POV*<br />
<br />
Three hours later, Elijah felt gone bored with the game. He turned his head, looking at Jake. His best bud, Jake was a total nerd, just like himself, and what he lacked in intelligence he more than made up for in interest and passion for school. All of the studying had meant that for the last three years or so, Jake had never ever set foot in a gym, instead running two or three times a week. Which, of course, led to him being incredibly thin and weak. But now, when Elijah looked at him, Jake seemed less scrawny than he did just five hours previous. For starters, he had a belly. A real belly, now, not just the bloat from eating a little too much in a short time, but a relatively thick layer of fat around his waist. He&#39;d had a skinnypack for ages, but now, he had fuckin&#39; lovehandles! There were subtle differences elsewhere, too. His cheeks, which Jake hated because of the residual babyfat, seemed slightly fuller and heavier. And there was even some semblance of a second chin! <br />
<br />
Elijah really did not want to say anything about it. He&#39;d been sorta chubby a few years back, and only intensive dieting and running had cut off the fat. He knew what it was like to be picked on for having a few extra pounds of dead weight - he&#39;d been teased by his older brother Luke, who had been both taller and stronger when he was at Elijah&#39;s age. The only consolation Elijah&#39;d had was that he knew that his cock was bigger than his brother&#39;s by some margin, from walking in on him once. Poor guy had reddened considerably before threatening to rip off his head, should he ever tell anyone. And even after that, Luke had continued bullying him for his figure. But this was Jake. He&#39;d been trying to gain weight for years. When Elijah - who never could control his mouth - had let slip a few insults earlier, Jake had simply looked dumbfounded, like he hadn&#39;t thought about it as a negative. When Will had had to quit training for a couple of months last year, gaining some ten pounds of fat, Jake was the one who&#39;d stopped Eli when he was about to make a sly comment. Instead of mentioning it in a condescending way, the two skinnyboys - and equally skinny Pete - had brushed off Will&#39;s tiny gut as a bulk, though Eli and Pete had joked about it in private afterwards. Maybe Jake was going through a bulk? <br />
<br />
God, he got distracted easily, he thought to himself, as he lost to Jake, his cruiser being blasted apart by Jake&#39;s guns. &quot;YES,&quot; Jake exclaimed - it was his first victory in some time, and he got up, walking to the kitchen. Probably to get some more food. &quot;I&#39;m getting some more food&quot;. Yep. Elijah watched him as he walked, noticing that his butt seemed a tiny bit rounder too. Was he looking at his best friend&#39;s butt? <br />
&quot;Keep it together, man,&quot; he said quietly to himself. <br />
He&#39;d finally come clean to himself a week ago - he was bi. He&#39;d figured it out after that session with some of the other guys, which eventually had evolved into a literal dick measuring contest. He was still astounded at Peter and Jake - with their eight inches long dongs, Pete&#39;s somewhat slimmer than Jake&#39;s, both smaller than the fucking god of masculinity, Will. He&#39;d suspected for some time that Will was packing some serious heat, as the guy&#39;s dick was seriously big flaccid, but he&#39;d just figured that he was a shower. He had never expected Will to be bigger than a fucking baptismal candle! Elijah was just lucky that they&#39;d measured him before Will, if not he&#39;d probably blown his load before he had a chance to prove to them all that he actually was a seven-by-five. It was close enough when the tape had passed to Jake and Pete - Pete marginally longer than Jake, but no thicker than Elijah himself. Seeing those eight-inchers on the two scrawny frames was the final straw in his sexual insecurity - he had the hots for dudes as well as for girls.<br />
<br />
As Jake returned with five grilled cheese sandwiches, Elijah said nothing about the weight gain, but made a stupid excuse for leaving - he&#39;d begun thinking about Will, and Thalia, and how, if Thalia had a bit bigger tits, then a three-way with the two of then would just be heaven. He knew this chub wasn&#39;t going to go down before he&#39;d gotten home to rub one seriously out. As he left, Jake turned back to his food, his new belly pushing lightly out against his shirt. <br />

<br />
*Jake&#39;s POV*<br />
<br />
When Eli left, Jake went back to concentrating on his meal. How much had he eaten today? He began to feel full after the fourth of the grilled cheese sandwiches. Stuffing the fifth into his mouth and swallowing, he gulped down a glass of water and got up from the couch. Feeling dizzy. &quot;Wow, guess I stood up too quick,&quot; he thought, walking slightly slower than usual to the kitchen, before stopping in front of the full-length mirror on the way. <br />
&quot;Oh no. Oh no, no, no. Fuuuck!&quot; He looked in the mirror, and a different person looked back. This guy had jowls. This guy had a spare tire. Thise guy had an extra chin. This guy had lovehandles. This guy was hideous. &quot;Oh fucking fuck fuck lord fuck,&quot; he growled to himself, running - or maybe waddling was a better term now? - into the upstairs bathroom. He removed his socks with some difficulty, and got on the scale. 130lbs, 140, 150... his eyes were getting very round now, 155, 162. He almost felt tears burning in his eyes, before he got a hold on himself. Was it hot in here? &quot;162 lbs of fat. Jesus...&quot; he lamented. He had to work to get this out of his system, now. He had to think about it rationally. <br />
<br />
Okay, okay. How had he gotten this, this... fat, in one day? These things didn&#39;t just happen, you didn&#39;t just add twenty-two pounds in a matter of hours. He thought back to his first science class. God, it was really hot in here. Okay. He had to think about cause and effect. <br />
Effect: he had added 22lbs of fat, making him look like a skinnyfat incel. <br />
Cause: he had eaten unhealthy food all day and barely exercised. <br />
<br />
Okay, that was kinda easy. But why had he eaten so fuckin&#39; much food? Because he was hungry? He&#39;d never managed to get five BLT sandwiches in one sitting before, much less the figurative tonne that he&#39;d eaten afterwards. So... why? What made this day different? <br />
<br />
He moved to the bathroom window as he thought, searching for an answer, searching for a single reason that he could have done this to himself. Sweating from the high temperature, he let his eyes glide over the back yard, the grass, the tall hedge, the... the pool. The pool had been different today, hadn&#39;t it? It had been blue, a deep, intense shade of blue that wasn&#39;t there after his short swim. He turned to the mirror and removed his once baggy shirt, inspecting the single roll of fat around his waist, letting his gaze glide up, over the hint of moobs, over the extra chin under his usual strong, single one, to his somewhat fuller cheeks. And up. To his eyes, which this morning had been gray as slate. <br />
Now, they were blue. &quot;Holy shit.&quot; He reached for his phone, to call his parents, but before he could touch it, his hand spasmed. Now sweating heavily, he realized that the temperature inside wasn&#39;t that high - he was figuratively burning from fever. His hand spasmed again, and he panicked, throwing himself towards the phone, before he collapsed on the floor, and the world became blue.<br />
<br />
Literally, he only saw shades of blue, all other colors washed away. He looked down on his spasming arms, which were blue. The floor, blue. The towels, also blue. He quickly forgot his new way of seeing, however, as his entire body felt like it was burning. For what seemed like hours - but actually only took minutes - every part of his body came on fire, and he felt as if all of his muscles and tendons had been torn simultaneously. It was so painful that he began thinking he was going to die, when the feelings lessened. He lay on the bathroom floor, shivering, crying, for some time, before standing up with some effort. <br />
Eventually, the burning sensation stopped. Jake Walhurst rested his hands on the sink and looked into the mirror. He looked haggard. The fat, which he&#39;d briefly forgotten about during the little trip to hell and back, was still very much there. He expected to see red eyes, but then remembered that he only saw blue. Only... the world was livening up. Yellow, green, red and orange slowly returned, and he looked into the mirror to see that yes, his eyes were indeed red from his tears.<br />
<br />
Jake turned on the shower water, removing his sweaty pants and boxer-briefs, turning the heat of the water down to a minimum. He didn&#39;t think at all while doing any of it, just acting on autopilot. When he&#39;d finished showering, however, he realized what had just happened to him. He had collapsed, his entire body in spasm and pain, his vision turning into monocolor! He reached for his phone, still in the nude, when it suddenly started again. This time, he didn&#39;t feel pain however, and he observed how it began. The blue spot appeared in the center of his field of vision, spreading outwards like a stain of ink, the intense blue drowning out everything else. It was like seeing in black and white; he could only see shadows and light, and everything was the same ultramarine blue. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; he said to whatever it was that was giving him this, &quot;just get on with it!&quot; He waited for the burn to begin, but it never came. What came into his view, however, was his dick. Slowly engorging with blood, rising like a battle-ready soldier, only, this soldier hadn&#39;t been summoned. Jake hadn&#39;t thought about anything remotely sexual, but he suddenly felt insanely horny, not just on his dick, but on every part of his body. Instead of burning up, he became very ware of his nakedness, feeling a pleasant warmth just under his skin, in every bone and muscle. After briefly closing his eyes and smiling, quietly thanking whoever it was for this compensation, he looked down to his dick. Did... did it look bigger?</p>
