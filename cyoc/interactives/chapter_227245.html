<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
The machinist shop where Jeff now worked was owned, operated and completely controlled by three alpha males including himself. After he had ascended into dadhood at an early age and procured his father&#39;s old job when he was only 10 years old, and he watched his father quickly shrink. It had become so ingrained into his mind that he was in charge, ever since he started bossing his diminuitive dad around to take out the garbage, shouting at him to clean his room, humiliating him in front of his father&#39;s former adult friends by comparing their arms in public...the list went on. Though he was 40 year old on his birth certificate, Mikey now had none of the rights he used to possess as an adult. He was no longer allowed to buy alcohol or tobacco products, or a gun, and he certainly wasn&#39;t allowed to drive. Those new rights belonged all to Jeff now. <br />
<br />
The Chronivac had made some changes without his even thinking about what they might be. Now, it was quite common for Myostat Symdrome sons to far exceed their fathers, become the legal guardians of their fathers, and for their fathers to become extremely submissive to their new large and in charge daddies. <br />
<br />
Scientists thought AR Virus was a mutated strain of Myostat Syndrome that affected older bodies differently. It seemed to have a genetic jump. People usually, about 85% of the time, contracted the virus through family members, and much like Myostat Syndrrome, it only affected men. Both conditions affected the psychological maturity of the patient. Myostat &quot;kids&quot; acted increasingly like mature adults until they were practically indistinguishable from their adult counterparts mentally, and this usually occurred by age 12. AR Virus, however, affected the victim to the point where adult rationality and maturity was significantly reduced. AR Virus victims sometimes &quot;grew up again&quot; but with a much reduced physical stature. Alas, for young Mikey, he was diagnosed with Prolonged AR Virus. He would be at age 12 for between anywhere between 30 and possibly even as much as 60 years. Both Myostat Syndrome and AR Virus guaranteed elongated lifespans of up to 100 years, but since one usually had to catch it from a family member, most men were not willing to be rejuvenated and become puny prepubescent versions of themselves, though a fraction had willingly exposed their sons to their Myostat kids or even gone so far as to have their sons spend time with Myostat Syndrome affected men in an attempt to catch AR Virus and swap ages in an attempt at a prolonged life. <br />
<br />
One of these situations had occurred with one of the other owners of the machinist shop. His father Barrett had contracted a very deadly strain of cancer. His son, Myles, willingly spent time with a Myostat family and contracted Myostat Syndrome through oral infection via kissing and then rocketed into adulthood, towing his father behind as a young boy, now free of cancer. Both the new man and boy had developed extreme homosexual tendencies and were good friends with Jeff and Mikey. <br />
<br />
The other big boss at work was named Big Steve, and he was a recent Myo whiz kid who had taken to being in charge much like all Myo kids naturally did. Something about Myostat Syndrome resulted in a natural ability to lead other smaller males. Nature was perhaps giving the world a gift by making them into such superior studs in an attempt to improve the human race. At least that is what some scientists speculated. Big Steve had not replaced his father, who had moved to another state to avoid contamination with AR Virus, leaving him alone with his mother. The result of Big Steve becoming so big so quick, being straight as an arrow and finding out that he was adopted in a short duration of time had resulted in a quick divorce between his parents and a very happy new couple had emerged between himself and his new wife...formerly his mother. <br />
<br />
Jeff wore comfortable jeans and T shirts to work. His body was magnificent. His looks were the epitome of masculine energy.  His bald head shone under industrial lights as he sat down at his desk to go through the rigamarole of shipping requests, orders, and payroll issues. His forehead was wrinkled, his face covered in several weeks worth of stubble. His muscles burst in a display of always ever intimidating masculine energy. When any of his employees had a question or wanted to approach him, they were all incredibly respectful. The women often flirted with him and since he was now bisexual, he realized quite happily, he could often get blow jobs at work from any number of hormone and pheromone overwhelmed employees desperate to swallow his superior manseed, both male and female. Many women had begged him to impregnate them, having his genetics course through their progeny rather than that of their either average, below average husbands or de-aged former husbands. He had turned them all down for the time being. When the time was right, he was sire several Myostat kid heirs. <br />
<br />
There was of course, a very high chance his children would grow up quickly as the new and evolved superior Myostat enhanced species of human...a whopping 80% likelihood guaranteed his male children would grow at an alarming rate beginning at age 7 or 8. <br />
<br />
He was saving up his seed for Little Mikey and his new Myostat man friends would be team fucking him later that night. <br />
<br />
For lunch, he enjoyed several beers which he could barely get a buzz from. He usually had to drink a whole six pack to feel anything at all. He found one of his secretaries needing a good fucking really badly after her boyfriend broke up with her, but told her he would invite her over next weekend for a sound powerfuck session. He towered over his underlings as he inspected the floor of the factory, and finally it was time to go home to his puny, hot fucktoy of a son. <br />
<br />
&quot;Son! I&#39;m home!&quot; <br />
<br />
Mikey came dancing in, in the faggiest possible fashion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Daddy! Here are your slippers, Dad!&quot; He kneeled before his father and helped to remove his mountain of a father&#39;s boots. <br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy is super horny tonight, baby. Let&#39;s get an early start.&quot; He picked Mikey up and carried him in one arm through the house and to the garage. He couldn&#39;t wait to fuck his former dad&#39;s sweet twinky little ass! <br />
<br />
It was sickening to him that he used to be smaller than his father, that his father had once towered over him. Disgusting. This is the way life should be. With him in charge and his former dad getting ready to BE FUCKED BY HIM! <br />
<br />
His large, pendulous dick swing around and he laughed out loud over how large everything of his was...nine inches of pure fun, he thought to himself. <br />
<br />
He plunged it into little Mikey&#39;s hole. Mikey was declared legally 12 but his grade level in school put him in as 16. He was always dominated at school by big alpha jocks and he was doing well with his studies. The state said he could get a good education but he wouldn&#39;t be able to legally work. Instead, he would continue his education wherever his father felt it necessary. Right now, it was important to him to surround Mikey with bigger hotter boys in the hopes that would drive his hormones crazy. Mikey still craved sex, but his sexual organs had been dramatically reduced. He could cum in tiny little squrts the same amount of liquid a lemon produces when you squeeze it only once. <br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy! Dadddddddddy UHUHUHUHUHUHUHUHUHUHUHUH!!!!!!&quot; Jeff rammed his cock into tiny Mikey&#39;s asshole, his sextoy, his plaything. He drew out his cock with an audible pop and creamed a volume of cum into his son&#39;s face and then mouth, about 40 tablespoons full. The Myostat Syndrome male produced sometimes as much as a hundred or two hundred times the cum of an average human male and Jeff was no exception to this statistic. Cum pumped out of his cock like a firehose dousing the flames of his son&#39;s stomach. It felt like nothing else on Earth, the overwhelming male energy that came with producing and pumping such an enormous amount of cum out of a cock all in rocking wave after rocking wave. <br />
<br />
The cum of a Myostat Syndorme male of course had an immediate intoxicating effect on the smaller reduced males who found themselves unable to resist the pheromonal beauty and addictive qualities of that superior cum. Mikey was forever going to be subservient and obedient and it never crossed his mind to ever disobey Jeff&#39;s orders and dirctives. <br />
<br />
&quot;MMM. Yeah. Just wait til the fellas get here. We&#39;re just getting started sweetheart.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, Daddy.&quot; Mikey nuzzled his former son&#39;s leg, dry humping it for nearly 20 minutes without any cum. His genitals were so tiny and sensitive but he did receive quite a bit of stimulaitng pleasure by rubbing his tiny little dick against his enormous father&#39;s gargantun muscled thighs, straddling them like a cowboy would straddle a horse. <br />
<br />
The doorbell rang. <br />
<br />
Just in time for this slut to get what he deserves, Jeff thought with satisfaction.</p>
