<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile in the bazaar like market, A cunning male Toon Badger with light blue fur with white fur underbelly and three white strips on his muzzle with one across the bridge of his snoot and the other two across the outside of his eyes like devil horns, and he also has yellow eyes. He wore a red bow tie, and a black blazer like a businessman. All he needed was some work pants to complete the look. Next to him was a big brute of a bear with dark brown fur and black beady eyes. He carries both muscles on his arms and legs, and a big ball belly, resembling that of a sumo wrestler, and he wears nothing but a shiny red Speedo briefs.<br />
<br />
In contrast; The Badger has an average build for a toon mustelidae with a little belly, but compared to his Ursidae partner, he is as fit as a fiddle. The mustelidae gave a sigh, bored out of his mind. &quot;Agh! Isn&#39;t there anybody out there, who I can Scam-er... I mean! &#39;Sell!&#39;&quot; The mustelidae sat on his chair.<br />
<br />
While the mustelidae may not have an accent to speak of (American perhaps), But the bear though; he has... what? maybe Japanese accent, or something. Because he spoke English like it was his second language. &quot;Uhh... Bossu? Aye think you may have a consumer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t mess with me ya bozo! There ain&#39;t no-&quot; But as he looks up. The bear was right. There is someone [or a group of people] who he can sell his merchandise. &quot;Oh boy! Our luck!&quot; The Wolf was beaming excited. &quot;Toni! Act natural! Capeesh!&quot; The badger tells the bear elbowing him. He clears his throat.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
You were just minding your own business; Trying to figure out what this toon world is even about, but then suddenly... An overly excited Blue Toon Badger appears in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Top of the morning to you my good friend! How are ya!&quot; He scream with such volume it made you fall on your butt. &#39;Where did he come from?!&#39; you thought. He continues. &quot;I am your friendly neighborhood Sell-er-Badger! Here to give you a one of a kind offer! Would you like to see it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;What even is this guy&#39; &quot;Oh what&#39;s wrong with me?&quot; The badger acting coy with that line, then he told you his name with awareness. &quot;The name&#39;s Mister Patches! nice ta meet cha! Allow me to give you a hand as you take a look at what I&#39;m offering!&quot; The badger pulls you up and drags you to his stand.<br />
<br />
You&#39;re questioning if this was even a good idea. But it looks like you don&#39;t have much of a choice. Because he is literally dragging you to his stand. &#39;It looks like he&#39;s selling lemonade... wait...&#39; But it wasn&#39;t a drink stand, he was actually selling what look like... &quot;Zippers? But I don&#39;t-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait-wait-wait!... I know what you&#39;re thinking... &#39;Now why would I want a zipper?! I don&#39;t even need one!&#39; Am I right with that assumption?&quot; He was right, but you didn&#39;t want to validate him with a response. So you didn&#39;t answer.<br />
<br />
The Badger smiles with his Cheshire grin. &quot;I thought so! Well, let me tell ya som&#39;thing!&quot; He pulls out one of the zippers. In looking at it, it&#39;s... actually bigger than the zippers you typically see in pants or coats. In fact... it looks like it doesn&#39;t belong to any type of clothing. Besides on a costume for the look of it, instead it being functional.<br />
<br />
&quot;This ain&#39;t no ordinary zipper mate! With this baby; You can be anything you want to be! Just slap this here bad boy onto anyone, unzip them, get in them, zip it up, and you have full control of their bodies! If you want to be a small mouse? It will stretch itself for you! You want to be a kid again? yah ya can kiddo! Wanna be a woman? &#39;Dam! I feel like eh woman!&#39; You are not listening mate! Think bigger! You want to be a Sumo wrestler? Absolutely! With this; It will make it happened!&quot;<br />
<br />
You are not buying into this... This.... scam! Are you?... Because it&#39;s just... Not possible! You can&#39;t just wear someone like a costume! Could you?... Mr. Patches holds up a zipper closer to your face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now before you walk away! Allow me to demonstrate... Toni? If you please?&quot; The bear walked towards the badger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Boss?&quot;<br />
<br />
And right at the bears windpipe the handle of the zipper goes down. Instead of it doing nothing; it actually done something! But instead of gory guts spilling out. inside of the bear became the inside of a costume. And when he realizes what&#39;s happening he uttered &quot;But Boss! I did not want-...&quot; his voice faulted and faded. And his body became a lifeless husks, like a snake&#39;s skin. With what left of the bear; his head is like an attach mask with opened eyes, and the rest of his body is like a giant one piece costume. And the poor bear; You bet his words were... &#39;But Boss! I did not want to be a costume!&#39;<br />
<br />
Mr. Patches reassures you that the bear is in fact alive. However... &quot;This is your opportunity to possess him! Now... as long as you keep the zipper open your vict- er... I mean!... Your new &#39;body&#39;; they won&#39;t move a muscle. But of course even while in their lifeless costume form they are aware. But when possessed they won&#39;t remember, or do a thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is starting to creep you out. But the blue Badger&#39;s not done. &quot;And you are also thinking. &#39;But Sir! That costume is too big for you! How could a pipsqueak like you can even fit inside that thing!?&#39; Okay first of all...&quot; he says this with annoyance. &quot;My name is not &#39;Pipsqueak&#39;!... And second!...&quot; He clears his throat, calming himself. &quot;And second of all... Remember when I told you that &#39;the mouse suit would stretch for you?&#39; Well; while this suit won&#39;t shrink for you, but your own body will merge with the suit, as if your body will grow to fit the suit...&quot; And so Mr Patches is about to get inside the Toni the bear costume. His voice was muffled by the costume. &quot;Watch and be amazed!&quot;<br />
<br />
He zipped up the costume. And in a matter of seconds; the costume starts filling itself again. And this time... instead of the bears black beady eyes, in its place are Mr Patches&#39;s yellow eyes. &quot;Impressive isn&#39;t it?&quot; And that is definitely the badger&#39;s voice!<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything that the bear holds in his fleshy body is mine!&quot; A Patches possessed bear lifts his own stand with such ease. &quot;I can lift objects that are my current weight.&quot; And he belly bumps you, almost making you fall. &quot;And I can eat as much food as I want or anyone I want without shame! I guarantee you&#39;ll want to try this body at least once!&quot;<br />
<br />
He puts his stand down, and leans on the stand with his elbows, you&#39;re amaze that the stand can even hold his new weight. And the badger possessed bear looks at you with... What?... confidences? or seductive? You&#39;re not sure... But you are not comfortable with this.   <br />
<br />
This is all so sudden! You don&#39;t even know if this is what you even want, never mind you don&#39;t even have an idea of what kind of person you wanted to be! Toon or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;In fact!&quot; The badger unzipped himself. Then he get out of the suit. And rezipped Toni. And the bear is back to his old self.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-... What just happened?&quot; You are officially amazed. It looked as if nothing had happened at all!<br />
<br />
&quot;So... Toni! Can you remember anything at all?&quot; Patches asked the Bear innocently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh; No! Not at all!&quot; The bear was in fact; confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you not remember belly bumping our customer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No nothing!&quot; Toni was worried if he was about to...<br />
<br />
&quot;Annnnd!&quot; He puts the zipper back on him again, unzipping, and making him goes limp again.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Boss! please I-...&quot; He is a costume again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll even let you wear my bodyguard &#39;Toni&#39; just for a day! Sure you have to work with me for a day, but that&#39;s minor consideration! Unless of course... you have a different request in mind; somebody else you want to be? And don&#39;t worry there is no side effects!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
That sneaky badger is a liar.<br />
There are side effect like: If you stay in the suit for too long [for example you in suit for three days or 72 hours tops] you will be stuck in this body permanently. And you would slowly start to either think or talk like the body they possess. Losing your original self.<br />
-<br />
Or if there is an agreement with a seller and the host didn&#39;t fulfill it, or if the item was stolen from the seller, then the suit reverts back to normal, and the host migrates into the persons stomach, [best case scenario if that the body you possess is a Fat Furry Toon, or bigger than you] otherwise you and the victim will have a bad time.<br />
-<br />
Additionally if the Host is put inside the costume and has been zipped up by a third party, then the host is trapped inside the suit until someone else on the outside pulls the zipper down. In any case, There are even more side effects that even the blue mustelidae himself doesn&#39;t know.<br />
<br />
<br />
The mustelidae is hyping up his sell up too well, wanting you to try his zipper. &quot;Come on! Don&#39;t delay! Get your very own &#39;Magic Possession Zipper&#39; Now! And you might be thinking? &#39;What if I need more than one of those Zippers Mr. Patches?&#39;&quot; Patches pauses for effect.<br />
<br />
But you knew he was gonna answer anyway so you play along with sarcasm. &quot;Oh yeah! Please tell me where I can get more of these?&quot; Pay no attention to the fact that there&#39;s literally a bunch of Zippers lying on his stand, like that wasn&#39;t obvious...<br />
<br />
But badger; of course, takes that opportunity for what it&#39;s worth. &quot;Well don&#39;t panic!...&quot; Patches pulls out multiple zippers; three in each of his hand-paws. &quot;I have more zippers to sell! So everyone will be happy!... So what do ya say!? Would ya want one?&quot; The mustelidae beams at you for an answer, it’s predicable that he wants you to just say &#39;yes&#39; to him... But would you?</p>
