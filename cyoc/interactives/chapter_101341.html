<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a long day of working, Ashley decided to kick back and relax the rest of the day.  And what better way to do it is by going online to browse that the web has to offer.  But this isn’t no ordinary browsing.  It’s the future of browsing.  What it’s called is virtual browsing as allows the person to dive into a digital rendered version of the internet itself by way of a virtual avatar and explore it like wandering around town in a brisk walk.  How it works is that your brain activity leaves your body and enters the realm of the virtual Internet in the form of your avatar.  So technically your body is at rest in the real world while your mind is active in the VR world.  Sort of new way of dreaming.<br />
<br />
Walking to her apartment, she stretches a little bit and says, “Phew…  What a day.  I thought that work in the lab would never end.”  Walking down the living room, she activated the clothing settings on the display and switched it to her pajamas.  From there, her attire started to shift in energy octagons from her street clothes to her pajamas as she was wearing a white and orange sexy jumper and she was barefoot.  Another advancement in the future is that people won’t be picking out clothes from the closet.  Instead all they can do is go to clothe settings on their headsets and choose what clothing they can wear, having them switch clothing with a flick of the switch.  That’s right, no more time wasting choosing clothes in dusty closets and washing them constantly.  Now all clothes will appear through subspace and they will be self cleaned for life.  So chuck one up to future engineering.<br />
<br />
Getting to the kitchen, she went to the display to choose her dinner for today.  For preparing and cooking food was a thing of the past, the future made meals very easy.  All that needs to be done is select the dish with a variety of foods and start.  There the food will be prepared in seconds by particle that will solidify meals and cook them up to absolute perfection.  Looking through her options, Ashley decided on a chicken filet with white rice and a side salad with a glass of soda.  The computer responded as it created the food on the fly.  After a matter of seconds, the compartment on the side opened up and a tray of the very meal she selected was presented to her.  Smelling how good it is, she picked up the tray and headed to the living room to watch the news on the 3D imagine module.<br />
<br />
Watching the news, she was curious on what to do when she logs into the virtual web.  There are a variety of things that this virtual web has to offer.  Social interactions, movies through a variety of services, gaming to a whole &#39;nother level, sports in 3D, the Internet library, pretty much everything necessary.  It’s a whole lot of stuff, but there is so little time to do them all.  And being that she will have eight to nine hours of her body sleeping while her mind is active, there’s so much she has to do.  So her idea is to do as much as possible in her nine hour time on the virtual web.  What she will do, she does not know.  But at least she will have a good time after the day hours of working.<br />
<br />
As soon as she finished eating her meal, she turned off the hologram television and threw her food away.  She then headed to the bathroom to take a nice relaxing shower before putting on her skintight pajamas that not only keeps her comfortable, but also keeps her body warm when the weather gets cold.  Walking to her bedroom, she looked around to see her bed ready for her.  Now this wasn’t no ordinary bed, but a capsule like bed complete with a mattress and pillow as it slanted upwards to elevate her body.  But on the top of the capsule like bed is a helmet that circles around her head.  What it does is that once the person goes to sleep.  The helmet would activate and transfers the higher brain functions to think, imagine, and rationalize out of her head while the lower functions, such as breathing and living remained in the body.  Those functions convert into energy and travels down the cable at the back of the bed and moves across the digital highway until reaching the main hub where the virtual web is located.  It is where the energy of the high brain functions turns into the avatars of the users, as they are free to move about the virtual world while the real body remained in the sleepful state at the comfort of her home.  Truly, the latest of web surfing.<br />
<br />
Looking to her bed, she stretched and yawns, as she was ready to hit the hay.  Approaching the bed, she lay down and turned to the console that operates the virtual web.  Clicking on the time counter, she selected to be on the web for nine hours, letting her body well rested while her mind surfs online.  Once everything was selected, she pushed the buttons and turned off the lights and layback down to close her eyes.  As soon as she did that, the helmet activated and lowered to her head.  From there, little needles sticked out and penetrated into her skull, not enough to hurt her, but enough to reach her brain.  From there, her high functions left her brain and entered her helmet, with a bright color of aqua green, the same color as her hair, appeared within the helmet.  It then traveled all the way up to the cable attached to the helmet and traveled downwards into a mounted modem into the wall.  As soon as the light disappeared, the body of Ashley lay there motionless, but was still breathing.<br />
<br />
The aqua green energy that’s Ashley’s high brain functions traveled down the fiber optic cables and made the journey to the main hub in the middle of the city.  During the trip, there were more cables underneath the city and multiple varieties of colors of other individuals whose higher brain functions left their bodies and wanting to join Ashley into the virtual web.  Soon hundreds become thousands as pretty much most of the city was joining Ashley.  Soon enough, everyone entered what looks like a huge sphere at the center of town that resembles a mini planet as the multi color energies left the cables and enter the base of the sphere and was inside it.<br />
<br />
Within the sphere, there was nothing but data and 3D models of what looks like an actual city filled with shops and media like venues.  Soon enough, the multi colored energies came down from the skies like lightning bolts and came down the virtual streets.  One of the energies was Ashley’s as it crashed into the street and started to grow and took shape into a womanly figure.  Within seconds, Ashley’s higher brain functions took a physical avatar form that looked like her without any clothes on.  She was stalk naked with the exception of any nipples or a pussy on her.  She was completely clean with darker lines on parts of her body designed very nicely, like Cortana from the Halo series.  Looking to herself, she smiled and said in a digital tone, “Oh it’s so nice to leave my body and feeling more free.  I hope there’s a way to be in the virtual world forever.  That way we don’t have to worry about living a short life.  But that would be for another time.”<br />
<br />
Looking up to the virtual online town, she could see other different avatars that appeared and walked about their daily lives like in the real world, going into different areas to have a good time or to work.  Looking to the huge city, she pondered and said, “Let’s see…  What should I do?”</p>
