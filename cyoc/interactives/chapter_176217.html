<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“God…that hurts.” Said Nate the crown prince as he floated flat on his new merman back after getting knocked in the chest by an armored elbow. He was wearing padding and yes, it wasn’t that bad of a hit but it was more of his ego. <br />
<br />
“I think we shall call it a day son.” Said his father, the king of this kingdom in the new merfolk world he found himself in. His father, Marius floated nearby with a long curved blunted sword in one of his hands, a sabre if Nate remembered correctly. When his father called it off a member of the royal guards swam up and offered the swords saber, another one swam up to Nate. “You can’t learn everything in a day, I was trained from when I was six how to handle a blade.”<br />
<br />
“I must admit, this is better than learning the process of some ceremonial duty.” admitted Nate as the guard took his blade and his father’s blade away, however the actual ceremonial blade his father carried at almost all times was still attached to his belt. That blade was no training sword and was razer sharp and had been passed down from ruler to ruler for almost 4 thousand years. One day Nate was expected to carry that blade and that is why he was learning how to use it instead of learning some other ceremonial duty detail. <br />
<br />
“I said the same thing to my father when I was a kid.” Laughed Marius before his turned a little sad before he smiled. “I was so excited when you where born, I couldn’t wait to teach you so many things including this and while late I am happy, I get the chance.”<br />
<br />
“I am sure you trained Amara.” said Nate as he sat up, only to be surprised when Marius shook his head. <br />
<br />
“No not actually, I trained her in almost every role duty but not the art of the blade.” Explained Marius as Nate looked at him, wondering if this was sort of sexiest things. Maybe mermaids where not allowed to fight, but that was not right from what he saw around ½ of the royal guards where mermaids and they knew how to fight. “This sword was carried by the 1st king of this kingdom; his wife carried a spear and therefor every Princess and Queen of Royal blood has been trained in the art of the spear not the sword. Every Prince and King of Royal blood has been trained in the sword. So I didn’t train her, my sister did to the best of her abilities along with several members of the guard. Truth be told if I had to fight I would pick the spear but that is just me.”<br />
<br />
Nate nodded his understanding, while it was a little sexiest in his view from everything he had seen and learned about the Merfolk world it was far more equal then the human world. <br />
<br />
“So if I hadn’t come back she would be Queen correct?” inquired Nate as a question which was bugging him was finally given voice. “So what happens to her now?”<br />
<br />
“Now…well she will be helping you rule, my brother before he showed his true scales was my closest advisor outside of your mother of course.” explained Marius as be moved to sit beside his son. “I trust him with almost everything, he was the 1st person I told about your mother being pregnant with you. I knew he was conservative but sometimes that is a good thing to make sure you aren’t rushing ahead to fast. However I never knew how much he hated the policies our father, grandfather and I put in. I assumed he was just displeased but not to the point of murder. He was about to get married, to the daughter of one of the high priests of our faith, his future father in law as among the ring leaders and was executed as well but still to this day I wonder who was the true leader of that movement. Was it my brother or the high priest, I am not sure.”<br />
<br />
For a moment they sat in silence<br />
<br />
“But don’t worry about that, as for your question you will rule along with Rose as your Queen while your sister helps you and whomever she marries.” Stated Marius “And neither I nor your mother will be going anywhere for a while.”<br />
<br />
“Truth be told, dad I don’t think I will ever be fully ready to rule.” Admitted Nate as his father put his arms around his shoulder. <br />
<br />
“No one ever is and every ruler is different and focus on different things.” said Marius “I can already guess you will focus on technology and what they call on the surface computers, your teachers are already telling people how good you are with them. Personally, I have a hard time keeping up with them and your grandparents are worse.”<br />
<br />
“I do love computers and the code you use is just interesting.” said Nate as be began to run the code in his mind, he had gone to college for computer technology/programing after all. <br />
<br />
“It has already gotten out, some of our tech leaders would like to speak to you.” said Marius “If you are up to it, I can arrange a private tour, it would make a great first royal visit for you.”<br />
<br />
“Sure.” said Nate as he remembered something Rose was talking about last night. “Rose…was hoping to go visit a hospital soon, can that be arranged.”<br />
<br />
“Of course.” said Marius “I believe there is a children’s hospital nearby which would be prefect.”<br />
<br />
It was getting late when Nate returned to the apartments he shared with Rose. His royal lessons took place in the evenings, so Rose had beaten him back. He swam into the bedroom expecting to find her waiting for him and she was. What he was not expecting was for her to sitting on the bed, topless with only a large necklace. The necklace was large covering about half of her shoulders and arching around to come to a point between her breasts. It was silver, with red gold around the edges with some rubies and emeralds where mixed in which worked great with Rose’s hair/eye/tail color. In the heart of the necklace surrounded by much larger rubies and emeralds was something Nate recognized. It was the simple ruby with a circlet of diamonds with a golden band which now sat around the circlet. It was the engagement ring he had gotten Rose, now in its new form. Merfolk didn’t wear rings because of the webbed hands, instead necklaces where worn and now Rose had her necklace back from the royal jewelers and she was wearing that and nothing else. <br />
<br />
“Oh…Nate.” Said purred in a low voice as Nate’s eyes widened, they hadn’t done it yet as merfolk’s yet. Being too tried from everything combined with waiting until they where 100% sure that the birth control was working had prevented them. Looks like Rose had decided now was the time and she was done waiting and so was he.</p>
