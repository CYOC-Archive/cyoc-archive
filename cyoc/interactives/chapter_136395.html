<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...leave the mall. Andrea and Bunny went out to continue spreading the infection. <br />
<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back at the shop, a young couple walked outside of the store.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we go. Now we can go to the beach!&quot; The girl said. <br />
<br />
She was a pretty, pale girl, with fiery red hair. Her name was Elisa. Her boyfriend, Matt, was a toned but relatively short man with black hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure babe. I&#39;ll buy you whatever swimsuit you want!&quot; Matt said. <br />
<br />
Elisa figured that he wanted to buy her one just to see her in it, which made her a bit happy. She knew her boyfriend was horny all the time, but at least he didn&#39;t look at other girls... most of the time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t forget, you need one too!&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, of course babe!&quot; Matt said.<br />
<br />
The two walked into the bikini store and up to Emily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like, hey there! Welcome to, like, Emmy&#39;s Bikinis!&quot; She said to the couple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Elisa said. &quot;I thought you guys sold swimsuits for... um... both sexes.&quot; Alisa said, as she picked up one of the sexiest bikinis. As soon as she did, she felt a strange shock go through her. &quot;I neeeed this!&quot; She thought to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, like, sorry. Maybe, your, like, man can try one of the bottoms on?&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No way!&quot; Matt said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not, babe? Maybe it&#39;ll be like a speedo.&quot; Elisa said. A weird side of her was really turned on by the idea of her boyfriend wearing one of them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... okay. I&#39;ll try one on. But if I don&#39;t like it, we&#39;re going somewhere else, okay?&quot; Matt said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure babe. But I&#39;m buying mine here.&quot; Elisa said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure babe.&quot; Matt said.<br />
<br />
Emily grabbed one of the skimpiest bikinis she sold and handed it to Matt. Matt was about to protest but as soon as he touched it any reservations disappeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like, changing rooms are in the back!&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
The couple walked to the changing rooms and shut the doors, neither of them finding it odd that they could try bikinis on. <br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Elisa tried on her bikini. It was a bright, sparkly green color. The top had thin straps leading up to two triangles that just barely covered her nipples if it were the right size. The bottom was a thong. She never would have chosen something this slutty, but for some reason it was making her excited. She stripped down and slid up the thong and then clamped the top on. She noticed it was too loose. The triangle bikini covered her whole breasts, and the thong looked more like a regular bikini bottom. &quot;Aw man. I really liked this one. I guess I&#39;ll see if that store girl has another size.&quot; She said to herself. Just as she was about to put strip down and put her clothes back on, a strange intrusive thought entered her mind. &quot;Mmm, that bimbo clerk was such a hottie. I&#39;d love for her to see me in a bikini...&quot; She thought to herself, getting aroused before getting disgusted. Her nipples were hard and her pussy damp, but her mind was thinking otherwise. A chill went down her spine. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with me? I&#39;m not gay!&quot; She thought, as her transformation started. <br />
<br />
She moaned and fell to her knees as she felt her body change. Her A-Cup breasts grew to fill the DD cup bikini, and her hips and ass expanded to swallow the thong. Her waist thinned a bit and she her stomach toned up. She stared into a mirror as her shoulder length red hair grew down her back and thick and full. Her bright blue eyes looked bigger, her nose smaller, and her lips puffier. Her lipstick looked a bit heavier. Her lips were a ruby red, her eyeliner thicker, and she had a bit more eye shadow. All the while, the thoughts about Emily became all the more intrusive. Suddenly, she had an orgasm, covering her mouth to stifle the moans. Although she didn&#39;t see it, her underwear disappeared, and her clothes changed to a slutty outfit that fit her new body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess... *pant* I am... *pant* a lesbian...&quot; She said, lying on the floor, satisfied with herself, a big smile on her face, accepting the bikini dyke virus completely.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
At the same time, Matt stripped as quickly as he could. Although he wouldn&#39;t have told anyone, ever since he touched the bikini, he KNEW he needed it on him right now. Top and bottom. <br />
<br />
As quickly as he stripped, he pulled on the bikini bottom and then the top. His was even sluttier than Elisa&#39;s, the fabric making a teardrop design that showed off more cleavage than Elisa&#39;s, and the bottom was almost as thin as a g-string. It was an almost see-through white color.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so ridiculous. Why did I even try this on?&quot; He said to himself, but suddenly felt a chill go up his spine. <br />
<br />
Instantly, he transformed into a woman. He was still around the same height (5&#39;4) but his hips expanded and his ass fattened up as his penis receded into himself, turning into a moist pink pussy. Then, two E Cup breasts grew on his chest, filling up the slutty bikini top. He was now a she. His face feminized, becoming very attractive, with cute, puffy lips, big eyes, and sexy makeup. Her hair grew down to her back, and her waist pinched in, giving her an hourglass shape, as her legs became thicker and more womanly. Her clothes on the floor changed as well, becoming a slutty female outfit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh GOD!&quot; She said, as she came on the floor of the dressing room, her old personality leaving with her orgasm. <br />
<br />
Matt was now Maria, another slutty bikini dyke. Her memories rewrote themselves, and she was ready to spread the virus as much as she could. &quot;Mmmm... I want Elisa in here...&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Elisa&#39;s head filled with memories of her sexy girlfriend Maria as she dressed in her new clothes over her sexy bikini.</p>
