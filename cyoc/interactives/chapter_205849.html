<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oi, Mate. You got a sec?&quot;<br />
<br />
Douglas hears a nearby brawny man call out. Having a flashlight pointed at his direction, though angled in such a way as not to blind him. The other guy is in a singlet and shorts, out of place for the regular attire of these researchers. Though his singlet does have the company logo emblazoned at the top. Not wanting to cause any trouble, Douglas acts his part.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, what&#39;s up?&quot;<br />
&quot;Know it might&#39;ve been a bit traumatic. But you good to process our new orc?&quot;<br />
<br />
His eyes go over the faux researchers uniform as he continues.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ain&#39;t your regular duties. But if I had to guess he tried to fuck you. Might be a factor in influencing a monster&#39;s behaviour that we haven&#39;t thought of.&quot;<br />
&quot;Putting them near someone they wanted to transform before they were restrained?&quot;<br />
&quot;Bingo. Others were always infected, but you seem fine. Up for it?&quot;<br />
<br />
A sudden recklessness overtakes Douglas. Speaking without thinking as he replies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah, I became an orc for a moment. Took the cure though.&quot;<br />
<br />
He immediately regrets saying that, though the bloke he&#39;s speaking to just laughs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good! That&#39;ll expand our research even more. Just wait here and I&#39;ll bring him out. You take him over to the processing room and the workers will do the rest. You just stay near em.&quot;<br />
<br />
Douglas just watches as the man enters the building he just left. Partially worried that Mark might be a bugbear by the time he finds him, and extremely concerned by his out of character outburst. But also seeing this as an opportunity to get that same information either way. Just play the part and learn the role.<br />
<br />
The man exists the building only a minute after he entered it. By his side, the newly made orc. Bracelet tight on his right arm, and toothy grin expressed on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright big guy. You&#39;re going to follow your new friend here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The orc looks to Douglas. Cock already started to rise, though his eyes are locked on the company logo that&#39;s on his uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm. Can I fuck?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not unless he lets ya.&quot;<br />
&quot;But. Want to. Hot. Attractive. Make good orc. Love him.&quot;<br />
&quot;I am your master.&quot;<br />
&quot;Master yes. But... want love master. Fix master.&quot;<br />
&quot;No! OBEY MASTER!&quot;<br />
<br />
The sudden spike in aggression jars Douglas once more. The orcs expression souring to a sad frown, body slumped forward as he follows behind his new master. Doug having seen the processing room beforehand and knowing exactly where to head. There&#39;ll only be a short walk before he drops this orc off, though maybe he can use that to his advantage.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, big guy. You got a name?&quot;<br />
&quot;Name... Yrk! Strong name! Orc name!&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you just come up with that name?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yrk smiles and nods. Seeming beyond proud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember when you were human?&quot;<br />
&quot;No! Human weak. No remember. Never remember! Happy orc. Better orc!&quot;<br />
&quot;You like being an orc?&quot;<br />
&quot;Orc best! Strong! Attractive! Very best!&quot;<br />
<br />
Douglas looks to the grinning brute. True, there is some extremely masculine appeal to the creature. Squared jaw, broad bodied, hairy chest and arms. Though knowing that any sexual contact with this creature would be a turnoff to almost anyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy look?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shit, he got caught staring. Douglas hiding a blush as he turns away. He was never interested in bulky guys before... was he? No. He certainly wasn&#39;t. Are these aftereffects of turning into an orc? His heart is rapidly pounding, Yrk really is a good looker to him. Even that transformation part isn&#39;t seeming unappealing anymore. He needs to recover, and he needs to remain a professional. Researchers wouldn&#39;t lust after their experiments.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look good, Yrk. I do enjoy it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good! I happy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug slows his steps to accommodate his new erection. Waiting for it to die down as he tries to ignore the happy orc behind him. Finally reaching the processing room as his stance returns to normal. Opening the set of double doors to another mostly empty foyer. There&#39;s waiting chairs around the edges of the room. A television near the corner and reception desk opposite end. A woman in surprisingly casual clothing sitting behind the desk. A pin on her shirt showing the company logo. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey. Been told to bring this guy in for processing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks. This the troublemaker I heard about?&quot;<br />
&quot;Probably. He broke into our office and fucked me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looks to the grinning orc, his eyes still locked on Douglas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well he clearly likes you. You said he fucked you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I turned, but took the cure before it was permanent.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then stay close, We&#39;ll take him to a testing room.&quot;<br />
<br />
She beckons the two through a nearby door. Ceiling lights lining a straight hallway that diverts into several of these supposed testing rooms. They remind him of a doctor&#39;s office. Large bed in the centre for patients, various medical devices on the walls. Though they&#39;re all empty, not a soul in sight besides this worker. Douglas thinking up a cover name as he speaks up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Leo.&quot;<br />
&quot;Matilda. Honestly it&#39;s my first time interacting with someone from the central office.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hah, same for me and processing. Expected to see more people.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s night, and we&#39;ve lost a lot of workers. They&#39;re in the infected compartment now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Working close to monsters puts you at a lot of risk?&quot;<br />
&quot;More than you can know.&quot;<br />
<br />
She enters one of the offices, sixth from the door to the right. Directing the orc to lay on the examination table which after a few button presses expands to allow for his larger height and width. A display similar to the ones in the infected compartment standing nearby. Displaying just &#39;connecting&#39; for a few moments before it begins to show new vitals and she presses the &#39;Sleep&#39; button. Yrk&#39;s eyes closing tight, as he starts to snore.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard this guy was first seen breaking in and out of the infected compartment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looks like they&#39;re blaming everything on him. That&#39;s good.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Why&#39;d he do that?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m guessing a friend of his was infected and he wanted to give him the cure.&quot;<br />
&quot;Just ended up becoming a monster himself.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, wasn&#39;t a smart move but he might&#39;ve been desperate. I&#39;m sure everyone here has a buddy that&#39;s been infected.&quot;<br />
&quot;...I got one. Mark.&quot;<br />
&quot;I had a few, but they&#39;re beyond curing now. You&#39;re in the central office though. I&#39;m surprise they don&#39;t just let you cure your friends.&quot;<br />
&quot;They would prefer the research to the person.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sounds like this company for you. Everything&#39;s for the research.&quot;<br />
<br />
She took that well. Douglas has to imagine it&#39;s pretty common for this place to sideline their workers for new opportunities. Though why aren&#39;t they hiring? If they&#39;re losing so many workers, surely they&#39;d want a fresh supply in to refill the ranks. As he ponders this question, the display changes and Matilda looks over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leo, I&#39;m going to run some tests, and I&#39;m going to need your help.&quot;<br />
<br />
She opens the nearby desk, pulling out one of the bracelets that each monster has.<br />
<br />
&quot;Put this on, I&#39;ll take it off when every test is finished.&quot;<br />
<br />
He watches it for a few moments, Matilda continuing.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re not a monster it won&#39;t influence you. All it&#39;ll do is let me get your vitals.&quot;</p>
