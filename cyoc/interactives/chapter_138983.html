<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">THEN-mostly Trying to forget about the complications and worries of modern living while you soon decide to take a walk, but After walking for some time now as you decided to go down a street you&#39;ve never even been down before that Surprisingly enough is when you find what seems to be an old park surrounded by a tall stone wall and passed by the moss-covered stones. you wonder how you could of have never known about this park before, but You knew that the park has to have been there for at least a long time now as the trees look to be fairly well-grown while It seems like a nice shady place full of trees for the children in your neighborhood to play in. However though, you don&#39;t hear any sounds of people coming from the park as you soon You walk in front of the ordinate steel gates and slip inside that Once inside is where you find yourself on a shady path with sunlight gently falling from the boughs of the trees to form roundish little shapes which blankets the ground like autumn leaves.<br />
<br />
The sound of wind chimes can be heard in the distance that the sound cascading through the park like the light through the trees as You walk down along the main path for a while and come to what seems to be a divergence of paths for You pondered for a moment and chose to follow the path heading into an odd French style mansion up ahead. just for the hell of it that You decided to walk ahead and enter the mansion to explore the mansion for anything valuable, like staples as You start walking up the double stair case and see out the window. you can see a vast yard Outside that On one side is a farm with stables for horses and cows while Beyond it was a grazing field as you can see another open field, where the moon is always full and always visible On the other side.<br />
<br />
yet Farther past a courtyard from where lies between the Farm stables and the open field, is a river surrounded by savannah like terrain that The River also flows into a jungle as There were also paths from the court yard which leads to each area that You later decide to go upstairs while working your way slowly up the creaking, wooden stairs and walk into a hall way. once there, You walk down the hall way and see several doors with very small animal pictures carved into them on one side, but the other side is where you see a room with a sign reading &#39;DRESSES/CLOTHING&#39; On the second door as you shortly step inside the changing room when you later see on the walls that there were tons of fur suits like lions, tigers, bears, horses, wolves, alligators, and so many others. closing the door behind you as You step closer inside to look at each of the costumes that you You decided you wanted to try on one of the suits.<br />
<br />
NOW-getting yourself undressed and stripping out of your clothes that you soon picked out and grab what appears to be a demon goat outfit, but later find out it was a Baphomet suit. slowly as you slipped it on from one leg in and up to your waist that you then notice something about the costume you were entering for there was a hole to put your cock and member through in, but you really didn&#39;t care much about it right now while slipping both arm sleeves on and zipping the suit up. looking back in the mirror as your body was inside the suit while it felt pretty much tight that It looks kinda weird with your head not yet disguised for the suit looks all hairy and fuzzy, but it sorta looks to real.<br />
<br />
looking at the closet as there was an accessory box that You search through it and see an odd looking flap as you felt amused when you realize it&#39;s a fake virgina while quickly grabbing your penis with one hand. You note that it snaps onto the suit while glancing into the box when you also see a set of a latex sheath and ball&#39;s as The virgina flap did had a little pocket on the inside for your penis, but it really looked to small that amazingly though is where showed your organ disappears into it. it were if it was bottomless that you decided to not put the female parts on and look some more as You later take the mask out of the box and note the snaps were on it too.<br />
<br />
carefully, you snap each of the snaps while expectantly stretch it over your face that As the last one snaps close, you see a electric spark and your whole body jerks and spasms. A wonderful tingling pleasure fills you as you then feel strong, but you don&#39;t know why for you feel like your whole body was changing. You look at yourself in the mirror as It looks all to real that you look all round and a bit scary looking, especially with your horns and the hooved feet.<br />
(if you play the iPad game called puzzles and dragons, number 1315 is what you would look like with the suit on.)<br />
<br />
Suddenly, you start feeling light... very light as you try to Keep your balance keeps getting harder and harder, and harder that you start feeling strange. You push your hand inside your belly to see if you were becoming hollowed, but still feels solid inside as There are seams no longer on your body. your trembling fingers explore yourself as Your body feels like it was morphing with the suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;this...this feels... so good...so real...so, wrong!&quot; You moan softly that The way your eyes don&#39;t blink for a moment, or even move anymore looks weird as they look very dead like.  As you move around, you find out when you relax that a part of your movement makes somewhat difficult.<br />
<br />
After a painful minute the pain stops, You open your eyes to find out in shock you can&#39;t find the snaps that you even can&#39;t find the zipper in the back. Strange unreasonable panic quickly grips you that you soon search frantically for the edges of the suit areas while you were determined to remove what was on you, but no luck for you were Growing more and more frantic as you can&#39;t find the edges. you begin to realize that not only you can&#39;t take it off, but also morphed you into The Great Demon Lord, Baphomet.....<br />
<br />
looking down at your cock in fear that thankfully, it was tucked away as it was under all that patch of brown fur while You look at the rest of your body and see it is ripped with muscles. All of a sudden, the lights came on to revile a door as You hear noises on the other side of it that You walk towards the door and opened it. On the other side of the door you discover a large room filled with other demon like furries as they were all having a large orgy and fucking one another!<br />
<br />
you look on as your cock gets hard by this that It goes to its18 inch length for there weren&#39;t just boys and girls going all out with each other, but also those of the same sex like gay couples do. soon after that without your notice, two demon like creatures walk right up next to you. If you&#39;re really a demon lord, how will you react to this?</p>
