<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Twice now she&#39;d stopped and loosened her top, shifted her jacket and adjusted her skirt. And each time, the tight feeling left for a little bit before coming back. Stopping a third time, Bets pulled on the laces of her top and before it could fall off, she re-tied it. Afterward, grunting, she pinwheeled her arms in an effort to shift her jacket and dislodge the tight sensation around her shoulders, armpits and upper arms. Wondering why her clothes were feeling tighter and tighter, &quot;Almost as if they had shrunk somehow,&quot; she reasoned, she reached down and pulled on the hem of her skirt, pulled on the waist line, snorted in disgust when more of her penis became visible and then tugged the garment down and tried to adjust it so it sat comfortable, but didn&#39;t display anything.<br />
<br />
When her clothes once more felt slightly comfortable, Bets briefly considered how long it would be before she&#39;d have to re-adjust and how long before it would before she had to go naked. Uttering a grunting-short, disliking that idea, she glanced about, waited for a car to pass, then hurried across the street and ducking into an alleyway. A number of times she&#39;d almost been seen, but each time she considered herself lucky to have been able to get into an alley or find some place to hide. Taking a deep breath as she thought of the one of two times she felt she&#39;d come close to being seen, she tried not think of what would have happened if she had been. Thinking it would have ended badly, as she believed no one would believe she was a girl and would assume she was some cross-dresser, she grunted, flicked her tail, which caused her skirt to twitch and rub against her penis, and glanced about.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t entirely sure where she was, as she&#39;d been sticking to alleyways and back streets. Scared she might be lost, unaware of the new changes her body had undergone, her thoughts solely on the genitals she&#39;d mysterious grown and how much she looked like a dude, Bets snorted, gazed about and considered risking going down the sidewalk. A car zipping by on the street, she froze and stared at it until had passed. Thinking, &quot;It&#39;s not safe,&quot; she turned and her hoofs making a gentle clicking noise, she started down the alley, hoping she wasn&#39;t too far from home.<br />
<br />
After a bit, she found herself mentally thinking of why she transformed the way she did. Considering the possibility it was some sort of bug, she wondered how she&#39;d caught it. Stopping next to a telephone pool, drawing a blank if such a infection could exist and how she might have caught it, she rubbed the palm against one of her temples, found it didn&#39;t help the sudden itch and looking at the wooden pole, she turned her head first one way, then another, leaned in and began to rub the side of her head against the telephone pool. Finding relief, snorting, she considered how good it felt and giggling, unable to stop herself, she grunted, &quot;Almost as nice as the feel of my skirt brushing against my penis, or a nice breeze up against it,&quot; in a deep bass.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts straying as she switched and began rubbing the other side, completely missing the velvet-covered nubs that had started to grow out of her head, Bets twitched her tail and sniffed the air. Thinking she smelled a deer nearby, she stopped and looked about. Not recognising where she was, it suddenly hit her what she&#39;d been doing and what she had been able to smell. Alarmed by this, still smelling the other animal, which her mind insisted was a doe in heat, Bets grunted and tried to resist the sudden urges she was feeling. Absently pulling on the lace-up part of her top, both it and her jacket feeling tight and too warm to wear, she turned in the direction she was sure the deer was and licked her lips and nose. Thinking, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t. It will certainly make my sickness worse,&quot; she let her top drop to ground and shrugging out of her jacket, feeling relief that it was off, she let it also fall to the ground as fur began sprouting up and down her legs.<br />
<br />
A quick flick of her tail and before Bets could stop herself, she was bounding in a different direction that went away from where she wanted to go. The surroundings passing her in almost a blur, Bets wasn&#39;t sure where she was going, only that a need she couldn&#39;t explain was driving her. Her mouth and nose starting to push outward into a muzzle, she stopped after some time and gazed at a sign. Struggling to read it, it took her a couple minutes before she could understand that it was the entrance way to the Barnabas and Joey petting zoo. The scent of doe stronger, she grunted and without giving it a second thought, swaggered into the zoo and towards the source of what her mind was insisting was a tantalising aroma.<br />
<br />
Trouble, thinking she should turn and flee before something bad happened, but at the same feeling like a primal call was driving her, she found herself stuck. Unable to decide to what to do, she lifted her head and uttered the weirdest noise she&#39;d ever heard. Immediately, it was answered from somewhere up ahead and finding that she knew what to do, losing her control to the animal she was becoming, Bets trotted toward the sound and the scent of deer. Her penis growing hard, tenting the skirt, she snorted and tried to fight, but the moment she saw the deer, all does, Bets lost the battle as she suddenly wanted to take them, dominate them and make them part of her herd. Uttering another grunt-like snort, she licked the lips of her muzzle, belted out another cry and understanding the does wanted the same thing as she did, she took the last couple feet toward them in a gallop. Undoing her skirt as she went, missing as it fell to the ground as well, she lost herself to the rut as she reached the first deer and breathing in the pheromones, Bets bellowed moved around to the back, stared for a moment at the flagging back end, thought someone was wrong, but, unable to decide what, she began to rub against the doe.<br />
<br />
The deer making a noise that her animal mind took to mean it was okay what she was about to do, Bets probbed a bit longer, a sheath growing around her erect penis and without giving it a second thought, she plunged her penis into the does vagina. After first, her human mind screamed what she was doing was all wrong. That she shouldn&#39;t have a penis and she certainly should be fornicating with a female, much less an animal, nor taking pleasure from it. But, the instant she realised she was enjoying it, the rut took further hold and as her hands began to morph into hooves, her size doubled, Bets bellowed in ecstasy. Finishing with the first doe, not being able to stop herself, she moved to the next one and repeating the process, it didn&#39;t take her long before she&#39;d thrust her erect penis into the deer&#39;s vagina. Leaning over in an attempt to get a better purchase, the feeling of needing to rut temporary left her as with a loud noise and some slight discomfort, her body realigned itself into a quadruped stance.<br />
<br />
Frightened of what had happened, and of what she was doing and how much she was enjoying, Bets looked down and seeing not her hands but hooves, she grunted and tried to say, &quot;No,&quot; but was horrified when all that came out where the sounds of an animal. Trying to dislodge herself, wanting for everything to be taken back, she found her movements only made it worse. Listening to the doe, hearing that it didn&#39;t mind, Bets felt the Elk mind trying to reassert itself. Grunting, snorting, the rut starting to take her once again, Bets bellow as she cummed and feeling her lack of control slipping, she tried to fight it a bit longer before the animal mind forced itself upon her. Spotting a third doe, she felt herself starting to slip away and thinking, &quot;No,&quot; she instead trotted over to the other animal and proceeded to repeat what she had done previously, the last bit of her humanity fighting to hold on, and slowly failing and fading as it did so.</p>
