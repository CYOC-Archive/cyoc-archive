<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m pretty good at Black Jack,&quot; he muttered. &quot;What&#39;s the rules?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Standard. Only, with a twist. For every hand you lose, you become more of a woman. Win hands and you become more of a man. Draws mean nothing happens. How about it?&quot; Lara grinned, grabbing a deck of cards and shuffling them in her hands while Derrick mulled over his options. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, technically, it&#39;s possible to become even more masculine than I was?&quot; he asked, looking hopeful. <br />
<br />
&quot;Correct. And we keep going until you say stop,&quot; she answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit really? Until I say stop?&quot; he asked, looking as though he had beaten the game already. In his mind, going indefinitely meant he was guaranteed to be restored. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but beware this does not mean you won&#39;t want to stop when it&#39;s disadvantageous to you. You will be locked in a battle between your masculine and feminine halves. If one wins over the other, it will likely lead you to end the game. So it&#39;s not a guaranteed victory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you&#39;re saying if I become too feminine, my female half will-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;End the game,&quot; Lara finished, a disturbing tone to her voice. Derrick paled, realizing that he would have to consistently win hands to avoid losing outright, but as long as he could at least maintain a slight advantage he should be fine. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, your deal,&quot; he said. Lara smiled, snapping her fingers. A slutty dealer outfit appeared on her body, featuring a tight miniskirt, button-up white shirt and ruby red waistcoat. Her collar was open, the top four buttons undone to reveal generous cleavage. Had I looked at her from the right angle, her nipple would have been visible. A dealer&#39;s table appeared before her and she dealt her cards. <br />
<br />
Deal 1:<br />
Derrick was dealt a six of clubs and four of diamonds. &quot;Hit,&quot; he called, as Lara obliged, offering a card that turned out to be a ten of diamonds bringing his total to twenty. &quot;Stand,&quot; he called.<br />
<br />
Lara smiled mischievously, flipping her cards over slowly. Six of Hearts, Nine and Jack of Diamonds, bringing the toal to 25. &quot;Looks like I bust,&quot; she giggled. Derrick released a sigh of relief. &quot;Now for your winnings,&quot; she snapped her fingers and Derrick felt a stir in his groin. He looked down to see that his pussy had vanished but...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, my dick&#39;s still gone,&quot; he protested. &quot;What sort of shit is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re starting at a disadvantage,&quot; Lara explained. &quot;You were already partly female. Now, you&#39;re dead neuter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just dirty,&quot; he frowned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be upset, Derrick. You&#39;re good at this game, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
Deal 2:<br />
Five of Diamonds, Seven of Hearts. &quot;Hit,&quot; Derrick called. Lara dealt, Derrick happily turning over a Nine of Hearts. Black Jack! Derrick grinned. This was an instant win. The odds that Lara would be able to meet 21 as well was astronomical. Sure enough she dealt, eventually busting at 22. <br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations, Derrick, you&#39;ve officially earned your man card back,&quot; she smiled, a growth in his groin indicating his dick had returned. He smiled, even laughed a littl at seeing the small inch long tube of flesh. This was just the start. He felt emboldened, likely planning to earn back his balls and then the remaining eight inches that Charity had robbed from him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s keep playing,&quot; he grinned. &quot;Deal!&quot;<br />
<br />
Deal 3:<br />
Five of Diamonds, Ten of Hearts: 15. Derrick paused. This was not a good start. On the one hand there was plenty of room for Lara to overtake him. Yet on the other, a card with a value greater than six would be a bust. He grit his teeth for a bit. &quot;Hit,&quot; he muttered, uncertain he really wanted another card. Nine of Clubs... Bust! &quot;No, no, no, no!&quot; he screamed as his dick once again shrivelled up and vanished. <br />
<br />
&quot;I told you the rules, Derrick. Would you like to continue?&quot; Lara asked, the other looking like he was about to cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just fucking deal, bitch. I&#39;m getting my dick back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deal 4:<br />
Six of Hearts, King of Clubs, another bad hand. Sixteen was a perilous way to start but... he didn&#39;t want to gamble like he did last time. Praying that fortune was on his side, he muttered the singular word &quot;Stand.&quot; Lara smiled, turning over her cards to reveal a King of Spades and Seven of Clubs. She had one by one point. He felt his crotch hollow out again, he was back to where he was when starting. &quot;Deal,&quot; her grumbled. <br />
<br />
Deal 5:<br />
Ten of Spades, Ace of Hearts, Black Jack! Derrick smiled as the familiar feeling of his pussy filling in washed over his crotch. Luck had returned. <br />
<br />
Deal 6: <br />
Jack of Clubs, King of Diamonds, twenty points. Derrick froze. He had an option to split, maybe double his winnings, but did he really want to tempt fate? The chances of winning by standing were high. Lara would have to get an exact Black Jack to win. He bit his lip. &quot;Split,&quot; he announced, moving the two cards away from each other. Lara dealt him two more cards: Three of Spades and Four of Clubs. Thirteen, and Fourteen respectively. He decided to go for the gamble. &quot;Hit,&quot; he called. Two of diamonds. &quot;Hit&quot; Ten of Hearts. Bust. &quot;Fuck,&quot; he grumbled, moving to the other pile. &quot;Hit&quot; Four of Clubs, eighteen. &quot;Stand,&quot; he called. Lara turned her cards over. Eighteen, it was a draw. Derrick heaved a sigh of relief. At least he didn&#39;t lose. That was something.<br />
<br />
Deal 7:<br />
Two of Hearts, Nine of Clubs. &quot;Can I double?&quot; he asked. Lara smiled and nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you are successful, you&#39;ll get double the rewards,&quot; she explained. <br />
<br />
&quot;Double,&quot; he called. Nine of Diamonds, twenty points. Lara turned over and drew, busting at 22 points. He felt the feeling of his dick growing back, reaching a full inch just as a tiny sack grew beneath it. <br />
<br />
&quot;There now,&quot; Lara cooed sexily, &quot;Much more manly than before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick smiled. &quot;Deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deal 8:<br />
Three of Spades, Three of Clubs. &quot;Split.&quot; Nine of Hearts and Five of Hearts, twelve and eight respectively. &quot;Hit.&quot; Eight of Clubs, twenty. &quot;Stand on that one,&quot; he ordered, turning to the other. &quot;Hit.&quot; King of Spades, eighteen. &quot;Stand on both,&quot; he called. Lara turned over her cards, hitting until she reached seventeen and conceding defeat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well done,&quot; she clapped slowly, Derrick feeling better as his dick pushed out an extra two inches and balls began to feel more weighted. He looked down and then back up to Lara questioningly. &quot;Greater risk means greater rewards.&quot; From then on I don&#39;t remember much. Derrick was a good player. He lost a few hands to be sure but he almost always gained back his losses, his dick steadily increasing in size and girth. Lara certainly seemed impressed as Derrick&#39;s dick grew back to nine inches at which point he laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, darling, that certainly was fun. Had me going there in the beginning, but it seems I&#39;m back to normal,&quot; he remarked, now standing six foot tall and his usual muscular self. <br />
<br />
&quot;Does this mean you&#39;re ending the game?&quot; she asked with a daring grin. He seemed to pause, as though considering his options. On the one hand he was back to normal, but Lara made it clear from the beginning that he could get more out of it.</p>
