<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Liz texted Maureen first thing in the morning. “How did you go last night? Successful?”<br />
Maureen still in bed and still in the Lily body texted back “No good. About to try again” she did not elaborate.<br />
……..<br />
Maureen did get out the medallion and the jumper of Roger’s. It was a jumper she had knitted him when she was pregnant with Kirsty. It had been eaten by moths and hence put aside for repairs that never happened. <br />
<br />
Maureen did not want to become a man but she had told Liz that she would. She wanted to have a younger Roger join them in Spain and the only way to get him the body she wanted was to do it herself. Reluctantly she touched the objects together and waited to see the result.<br />
<br />
It was obvious quite quickly that she was becoming male. Her boobs shrank, she elongated then she became hairy. She watched in the bathroom mirror as she changed from ‘Lily’ into Roger. She noted with satisfaction that her stomach firmed up and became hard. Her muscles grew and as her face was changing her vagina sealed over and she began to grow balls and a penis. She recognised the assets she had gained. It was weird to have them on her own body though. Or should that be ‘his’ own body.<br />
<br />
She changed into a version of Roger of about 33. He was fit and trim. The only problem was that the version of Roger she became had one hell of a black eye. The surrounds of her eye were purple and yellow.<br />
<br />
Maureen could remember Roger having black eyes several different occasions. Roger hd told her they were caused by stray elbows while playing basketball. She had no reason to doubt him.<br />
<br />
The new young Roger texted Liz back ‘Successful but now have a black eye”<br />
………<br />
Liz stayed home that morning. Roger insisted on it. “Don’t be silly. You look terrible. Your shoulders are starting to blister. From what you told me Liz is on the recovery. If it is so important that you see her ring her up and invite her over here”<br />
<br />
Liz actually felt a lot better. She still looked red but her skin was no longer hurting. She was very curious to see what Maureen had become. However, she was happy for Roger to massage cream all over her one more time. <br />
<br />
When Roger was out in his shed Liz rang Maureen.<br />
<br />
Seeing who the caller was Liz, she answered but dared not say hello until she heard her own voice on the other end.<br />
<br />
Maureen explained her situation in Roger’s voice. “I’m Roger at about 33 or 34. I’m fit, strong and handsome. My only problem is I have an awful black eye from a basketball incident”<br />
<br />
“You sound exactly like Roger”<br />
<br />
“This body would be perfect but for the black eye. What do you think?”<br />
<br />
“I can’t actually see you. You had best tell me what you think”<br />
<br />
“I don’t have any other articles of Roger’s clothing over here to try, so I don’t have another choice at the moment. Can you come over and bring me some more of Roger’s clothes”<br />
<br />
“Roger wants me to rest. He said ‘If Liz is so desperate to see you she can come over here’ So I’m kind of stuck”<br />
<br />
“I certainly can’t go over there at the moment”<br />
<br />
“You certainly can’t. We will just have to both stay where we are. How long do black eyes take to fade?”<br />
<br />
“About a week from memory but I think this one is already a few days old. The swelling has gone down”<br />
<br />
“Stay as you are and I should be able to come around in the morning. I’ll let Roger know I’m improving”<br />
………<br />
Maureen had one big problem. His penis seemed to be permanently in a state of excitement. Maureen did not know how to get it to shrink down to its normal limp ‘at play size’. He did consider masturbation but decided not to as that would make him a hypocrite. As Maureen she would regularly remind Roger how disgusting it was whenever she caught him scratching himself.<br />
<br />
His balls and penis wobbled around as badly as Maureen’s old boobs would without a bra. <br />
<br />
He decided his best option was to hide the offending organ but that presented problems as well. There were very few clothes that fitted his current body at Liz’s house. The jacket and jumper taken from the box found in Roger’s shed were all there was. In the end he put on a pair of Liz’s panties and elasticised bike shorts The clothes were tight on his crotch and far too effeminate to be worn by ‘Roger’ but at least they stopped the wobble. The weather was warm enough so it didn’t matter that Maureen went topless. <br />
<br />
It was amazing to not have breasts which bounced around with every step he took and a flat stomach. Liz had a small home gym in one of her spare rooms. Importantly Liz had a mirror in that room and Maureen spent a lot of the morning in front of it lifting weights. His muscles grew dramatically when they were used. The weights were so easy to lift.<br />
<br />
Maureen also shaved his face and used Liz’s grooming tools to remove unwanted hair from his ears, nose and back.  He did resist the temptation to pluck hairs from his eyebrows.<br />
<br />
In the shower Maureen discovered you do not wash the end of your penis with soap. That at least made his erection subside.<br />
……..<br />
Liz got more active as the day wore on. When Roger left his shed to come in for lunch she told him that she was feeling much better. All the same, she accepted another massage from Roger after lunch. By then her face was beginning to peel. <br />
<br />
Liz busied herself by cleaning the house and cooking a chocolate cake for Roger. <br />
……..<br />
Maureen prepared himself a dinner and while doing so discovered another advantage of being in Roger’s body was the increased height. Maureen now had no trouble reaching even the highest cupboards. He found himself still hungry despite giving himself the sort of serving she usually dished out to Roger. Had she kept Roger perpetually starving for the last 25 years? No wonder he never put on weight.<br />
<br />
After dinner Maureen waited until he could change again. He had changed into Roger at 7.08 that morning so as soon as 12 hours were up he could change once more. The problem was he had no other clothes of Roger’s he could try out in order to become young Roger without a black eye.</p>
