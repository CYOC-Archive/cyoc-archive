<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay, cos you broke my computer, you gotta do whatever I say, alright?&quot; said your friend Jake with a slightly angry tone in his voice. You nodded <br />
and gulped, thinking of what kind of treacherous acts he would think up of. &quot;Alright, then let's go into my room.&quot; The two of you went up the <br />
stairs of his house into his room, covered with gaming posters and action figures. Jake closed the door and sat down on hits bed. You sit down at <br />
his desk as he continues, &quot;You know that boarding school a few blocks down? Y'know, the girls one?&quot; You thought for a moment, then <br />
responded, &quot;Yeah, the one opposite the shops?&quot; Jake nodded, &quot;Exactly. What you're gonna do is go there and pretend you're attending for a <br />
week.&quot; You were dumbfounded. &quot;Wh-what? Me?&quot; you asked in disbelief, &quot;But I think you can clearly tell that I am not a girl and definitely look <br />
nothing like one!&quot; you said loudly. &quot;Yes,&quot; replied your friend, with an evil looking grin on his face, &quot;you don't NOW but you WILL.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wha-what do you mean?&quot; you asked, scared.<br />
<br />
Jake went over to his closet and dug into his collection of clothes, then pulled out something. You noticed that it was a bodysuit, a girl bodysuit. <br />
&quot;This should do the trick,&quot; he said proudly, &quot;I had the liberty of getting it off a friend. His brother found it in this store.&quot; You were shocked. &quot;Y-<br />
you don't expect me t-to wear that? Do you?&quot; you asked. Jake nodded and you nearly faint on the spot. &quot;Okay, I've already applied for you to <br />
attend, and you start tomorrow, so you'd better get this thing on. When at the school, you will be known as Annie instead of Andrew. &quot; said Jake, <br />
nearly laughing out as he imagined how you would look in the suit. He went back to his closet and got out some more things. He held out a <br />
bottle, &quot;Said on the manual that you have to remove all clothing for best illusionary results. Also, before putting on the bodysuit, it recommended <br />
rubbing this stuff all over your body. Especially sensitive parts. Apparently it's a lubricant of some sort. Alright, get changing. I'll go out, so have <br />
fun!&quot; said Jake, putting the bottle in your hands, and heading out the door. You heard the sound of the door locking, and you realized in horror <br />
that his door was the kind that could only be locked from the outside, meaning that you were sealed in.<br />
<br />
You thought about your options of escape, and after a few minutes, you knew that you WERE completely sealed in and the best solution was to <br />
do as Jake said. &quot;Grr, I gotta get him back for this someday,&quot; you mutter to yourself as you strip. Then you open the bottle cap and squeeze the <br />
transparent substance out. You rub the stuff all over your body, under your armpits and on your cock. You were forced to stick the gooey <br />
substance a great depth up your rear end, as the print on the bottle had suggested to 'prevent discomfort when wearing the bodysuit'. Next, you <br />
unzipped the bodysuit itself, which felt and looked just like real skin. You found a corset inside the suit, and you groaned as you realized that <br />
you were going to have to wear that thing. You positioned the front part of the corset on you belly, while you positioned the other on your back. <br />
Then you took hold of the strings on either side and pulled. You felt yourself getting thinner and thinner, until you couldn't go any further. You <br />
looked at your self in the mirror on Jake's wall, and you saw that the corset had made your waist nearly three themes as thin. Getting on with <br />
things, you slipped your feet quickly and smoothly inside the bodysuit, thanks to the lubricant. bringing the suit up, you then realize that the <br />
legs of the suit are way to tight for you, as they chocked your legs thin and made them appear very feminine. Once up to your groin, you found a <br />
small stretchy tube inside the suit, which connected to the vagina on the outside. You winced as you starched the opening as big as you could, <br />
then inserted your member and let it go with a snap. As you let go of the tube, you found that it was secured in one place, cleverly made to <br />
prevent any movement from your cock and also to stop the suit from bulging out in the groin when worn. Next, you grab the two flaps of skin <br />
behind you and stuff it up your arse, fully covering your skin but still giving you the ability to use the bathroom. You pulled the suit up over you <br />
waist and over the corset, before stopping just under your chest. You gulped as you saw two medium sized things attached to the suit. You took <br />
them off and just as you expected, they were false breasts, with suctions cups on the bottoms and a strap. You positioned the realistic breasts <br />
over your nipples, and pressed the suction cups hard onto your chest. You then tightened the strap, which you had put around and hooked it up <br />
around you back. You looked down and sighed in embarrassment. The breasts seemed real, as if they were yours, smooth and round, complete <br />
with the nipples sticking outwards prominently. You pulled the skin over the breasts, completing the illusion and adding a new weight to your <br />
chest. After slipping your hands and arms into the thin arms of the suit, you reached back and zipped the suit up. You looked back at the mirror. <br />
From the neck down, you looked exactly like a well-bodied girl, with perfect skin tone and a nice curve in your waist. After a few minutes of <br />
admiring your new body, you get ready for the final part. You grab the mask of the suit, and look at it carefully. The hair was a light brown color <br />
and the skin matched the suit's body. You took a deep breath, and put the head over your mask. After some positioning and moving around, you <br />
got the mask secured and you patted it down to get rid of any wrinkles. You felt a band around your neck, pressing down on your adam's apple. <br />
<br />
Jake went in, admiring your new attractive looks. &quot;Great, now you're ready for tomorrow. You can sleep in the guest room tonight, as I have <br />
already phoned your parents saying that you are going off to school camp. Sleep well, Andrew. Or should I say, Annie?&quot; he said, laughing as he <br />
showed you the way to the guest room. You went into an empty room with a small bed and a barricaded window, and before you knew it, Jake <br />
had locked the door and trapped you inside. You climb into the bed naked, turn off the lights and slowly drift off to sleep, dreaming about life as <br />
a school girl.</p>
