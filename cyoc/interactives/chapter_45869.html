<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You leave the mall and start walking home, trying to get the image of Gene walking away out of your mind. For some reason his comments to you are bothering you, even though you are the one to blame for making him look so attractive and feminine. Like any guy, you saw an attractive female body and were checking it out. Just because Gene is a guy mentally, and at least somewhat between the legs so to speak, does nothing to change his body. Him accusing you of being gay was uncalled for.<br />
<br />
With that in mind you decide that next time you see him you will change him back to normal all together, even if it means that he will lose Melissa as a girlfriend, and well, maybe he deserves it considering what he said to you.<br />
<br />
That the whole situation is all your fault never crosses your mind.<br />
<br />
Lost in thought, you nearly bump into a jogger. She starts to say something about your carelessness, but then recognizes you. At the same time you recognize her as being Melissa.<br />
<br />
Virile guy that you are, your eyes are drawn to her tight top and equally tight and oh-so-short shorts. Nothing is left to the imagination.<br />
<br />
You look away before she notices, and you smile, partially to be polite and partially because you have a plan based on Gene's teasing you for checking him out. He may have called you gay, but you have the power to make his girlfriend better hung than him, and if that were the case, what would that make him?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Melissa, what's up? I was just talking to Gene a little while ago, he says he has a big date with you tonight,&quot; as you say this you set the light to its absolute highest blue setting and prepare to turn it on.<br />
<br />
Melissa laughs merrily, &quot;Yup, we're hanging out tonight, but it's not really a big date though. He's just going to come over to my house, we're going to watch a few movies and just talk. I'll tell you though, he's the greatest guy when it comes to conversation. We have so many similar interests, he's like a best friend and boyfriend all in one. All the girls I know are so jealous that he picked me over them.&quot;<br />
<br />
This only increases your frustration, and seeing no better oppertunity, you shine the flashlight on the area between Melissa's legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; you laugh, turning the light off before she notices, &quot;I should have asked him for advice on how to make my girlfriend really happy. I always have a hard time figuring out what to get her or where to take her out on a date.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa laughs at this as well, &quot;I'd love to talk to you more, but I've got to get home and take a shower before Gene comes over. Talk to you later!&quot;<br />
<br />
She then jogs off, as you watch her, you note with a smile that her shorts have become longer and baggier, something a guy might wear while out for a jog.<br />
<br />
Between Gene's reduced manhood and Melissa's new, likely enormous, 'manhood', their date is going to be very interesting. You cannot wait to call Gene tomorrow and ask him how things went.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Melissa got home and let herself into the house. Since her parents had gone off on vacation for a week, she was alone, perfect for an evening together with Gene. Though her parents were fine with her having him as a boyfriend, they worried about her, especially her mother. She was always telling her that she had to be careful when dating, that some boys might be a little intimidated by her. She would have reassured her mother that Gene was perfectly fine with her, but that would have required her to admit just how far she and Gene had gotten in their relationship and her mother still thought of her as a little girl. It would have been a very awkward situation for her, so she just kept quiet.<br />
<br />
Going upstairs to her room, she went into her room and looked herself over in the full length mirror her father had put on the door when she was little. How she had loved playing dress-up in front of it when she was little, and now it was perfect for looking herself over.<br />
<br />
All in all, she was happy with how she looked. In her opinion her hair, mousy brown and lacking body, was her worst feature, which was not all that bad.<br />
<br />
She was tall and thin, her body well toned thanks to her going out jogging every day, weather permitting and paying careful attention to what she ate.<br />
<br />
Taking off her top, she looked at her breasts, running a finger around one of her pert, pink nipples and watching it perk up. She was a b-cup, not as large or well shaped as Gene, but still pretty good. At least they were not so big that they caused her back problems and kept her from being able to enjoy jogging. Coupled with her shapely hips, they gave her a near perfect hour-glass figure.<br />
<br />
Next she stripped off her shorts and boxers, absentmindedly scratching at the thick thatch of pubic hair above her member. It was a relief to let herself hang free. There were some drawbacks to her size, just over six inches long soft with a proportionate girth and balls to match, but at the same time, she would much rather have her massive, thickly veined member than have to deal with a period every month.<br />
<br />
Content, she went to the bathroom, stood in front of the toilet and relieved herself, then took a quick shower, blow drying her hair afterwards in an effort to give it a bit more volume.<br />
<br />
Really though, there was nothing that could be done for her hair, even Gene had tried giving her advice, but nothing had come of it.<br />
<br />
Since it would not be long before Gene showed up, she decided not to wear a bra in anticipation of his arrival. Putting on her tightest fitting, most low cut shirt, she looked at herself in the mirror and nodded approvingly. Her breasts jiggled in a most tantalizing way, guaranteed to drive any guy wild, and her nipples were visible through the thin fabric, just begging to be played with.<br />
<br />
She also decided to forgo boxers, deciding that if she were going to spend the night at home she might as well be comfortable. Some guys may have liked some support, but she had always preferred to 'free ball'. Part of it came from the fact that it was so hard to find boxers that fit comfortably, none of them designed for someone with hips like hers and panties were totally out of the question.<br />
<br />
Finding the tightest pants she could wear comfortably, she put them on and gently patted the huge bulge in the crotch. She loved the way she looked, showing off a member that most guys could only dream of having.<br />
<br />
Her mother always said that it was not really proper for her to wear such tight fitting clothing, but Melissa was of the state of mind that she might as well show off what she had. Then again, her mother also disagreed with her standing to pee, believing that it was more lady like to sit. Melissa on the other hand was thankful she could stand, especially considering how dirty public toilets could be.<br />
<br />
Now all there was left to do was wait for Gene to show up.</p>
