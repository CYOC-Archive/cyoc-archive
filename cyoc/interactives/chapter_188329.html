<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brett needed to hit the gym. To do something normal for him, so as to get out from under this overwhelming feeling of the unreal. And hitting the gym would do just that. It was an extrication of him from the horror movie scene his room had turned into for him. &quot;I&#39;m...gonna go hit the gym,&quot; he started, &quot;But none of my clothes are gonna fit me like this, or they&#39;ll turn me into a-a fucking object for the likes of Jules and Cole to lust over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jules and Cole were his usual friends, but now that he had transformed in such a way he felt a bit more wary of them due to how they were. Cole was a bleached blond young man who even in his mid thirties made an effort to retain the appearance of a Cali surfer. He had previously laughed off Cole&#39;s behavior. But now he had reason to believe he might not get very much peace at the gym if he showed up in his usual stringer and shorts.<br />
<br />
Jules was Cole&#39;s best friend and a nerdy guy who had started working out on Cole&#39;s advice. He was thin and reedy, but had moved more into the toned end of things. He was almost as prone to the same behavior as Cole. A fact Brett was now more weary of, again, due to the changes. Maybe he should&#39;ve, in all honesty, not enabled them with his typical fist bumps and shrugs whenever they acted up.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I need some new clothes for the gym.&quot; Brett breathed.<br />
<br />
Samantha nodded, &quot;Extrictum Clada Ad Cias.&quot; Her words seemed to brim with electricity, and Brett for the first time saw her magic at work.<br />
<br />
Right there in front of them, a pile of unisex workout clothes generated seemingly out of the blue. Tank top and pants, probably good enough to show off Brett&#39;s muscled physique while not exactly making things too revealing for him. Right now he was not exactly comfortable showing off a body that had been unwillingly assigned to him. Also included in there, though? A bra. Brett winced when he thought about putting that thing around his chest. It was the right size, and he needed to get dressed at any rate...<br />
<br />
Getting it on was simple as doing the very same thing in reverse from what he usually did with his dates.<br />
<br />
Thankfully Samantha had also included boxers rather than panties, such to respect his identity. Brett slipped them on and the pants, and walked into his bathroom. He promptly flexed his biceps while doing his usual pose with his chest - accentuating his breasts in the process. He did admit he had some very appealing breasts on him, and they were the right mix of strong and perky. He was a regular hard body. He hadn&#39;t even lost much in terms of muscle on his arms. Barely anything at all, really.<br />
<br />
By the time Brett was getting his preworkout and drinks ready, Samantha shouted over to him, &quot;Make sure you&#39;re careful out there!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will be! So you&#39;ll be here when I get back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I am gonna be around dealing with this spell full time,&quot; she answered, &quot;You don&#39;t need to worry. Go enjoy your time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, he thought, as much as I can when I&#39;m like this. Brett slung his workout bag over his shoulder and headed out. It was a short elevator ride down to the parking garage, one which saw Brett wondering how he was gonna be perceived like this. He checked his card. He let out a breath - yeah, right, she put that glamour on. When he was out and giving his ID, people would take it as him being Britney Kreene. Britney Kreene, what a name.<br />
<br />
It made him think of the valley girls from high school. The senior grade girls who&#39;d never give him a single glance before he started his regimen. He did take a bit of satisfaction in knowing he was probably now prettier than they were. Well, comparing now to then was probably a little unfair. He sighed. Look at him acting like this.<br />
<br />
As Brett drove off to the gym and got out, he noted that he was drawing quite a few stares. Thankfully his new boxers did their work keeping what he had downstairs less obvious. The woman at the front usually flirted with him when he was male, and Brett was somewhat surprised when she led with the same flirty line she always used when he came in normally. He tilted his head - she was a blond, athletic young woman with bright green eyes, a pretty face, average boobs but an excellent ass.<br />
<br />
But today, nowhere near as good an ass as what Brett was rocking. It did make him wonder if she was bisexual. Maybe he had a chance today.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey babe, haven&#39;t see you around here before. I&#39;d think I&#39;d be able to remember a hot muscle babe. Name&#39;s Cole,&quot; And there was Cole. Just as soon as Brett went over to get his bench presses done. Cole usually did way more chest than anything else. He loved leading with his pecs and shoulders. Yeah, this was Cole. Tall, blond and grinning like an idiot. He was about 36 or 37, but he dressed and acted like he was still a 21 year old heading out to the beach for summer to catch some waves and get his tan.<br />
<br />
Seemed that his buddy Jules wasn&#39;t here today. Ah well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that could be because I&#39;m new here. Do you always greet people like this?&quot; He answered. Man was it different to be on the other end of this conversation. Even so, as Brett took in the situation, he found himself reacting in a different way to Cole than he ever had when he was all male. He took in the meaty pecs, the powerfully built shoulders, the effort Cole put into concealing what few wrinkles he had, the tightly muscled abs, obvious quads, and baseball shaped, striated biceps resting on top of horseshoe triceps.<br />
<br />
And of course his wide back complimenting it all, bringing the whole physique together.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mirin&#39; babe?&quot; Cole of course flexed his arms as he caught Brett staring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hard not to,&quot; Brett responded, wondering where this sudden rush of attraction was coming from, &quot;You&#39;re admittedly a pretty big guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, just pretty big? How about we try a little contest.&quot; Cole answered, &quot;You&#39;re already doing some bench press, and I&#39;m something of a legend on bench. How about we see who&#39;s got the better bench, babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett felt his machismo and this strange new attraction to Cole clashing and melding as he returned with, &quot;Oh, really? I&#39;m no slouch. I think I could probably kick your ass on bench press. And what are we gonna do to make this whole thing interesting?&quot; Thank fuck for these tight, restrictive boxers - because Brett was feeling half hard and---and a new feeling in his new pussy. He gulped suddenly. That was new. The wetness in his new sex organ was...it was certainly like nothing he&#39;d experienced before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I figure if I win, we go out on a date,&quot; Cole winked and Brett almost wanted to sigh. Sleazy, pervy Cole probably saw a date as a sure fire thing to lead into sex later. And Brett felt so troubled by the fact he didn&#39;t know if he wanted to slap Cole silly - or see if he&#39;d be interested in a bit more than usual in terms of sex with a woman.<br />
<br />
Am I gay, Brett wondered, for wanting to fuck Cole&#39;s big, muscled ass? Or am I straight for feeling so curious about how Cole&#39;s dick would feel in my new pussy?<br />
<br />
Brett shook his head, and decided to add his part, looking at Cole and seeing his grin - fuck this guy, he knew he was hot, he knew that Brett was getting distracted. Cole knew what his body - and the way he dressed in a stringer and short shorts - did to people with a so inclined sex drive. He loved it. &quot;Well, and if I win...Cole, I want you to send me video...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; He grinned, anticipating something.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Of you putting a dildo into that muscled ass of yours until you cum.&quot; Brett smirked. He was sure this would get Cole to back off. Someone as committed to seeming as macho and straight and like the typical playboy as usual, he&#39;d never go along with it. And indeed, it seemed to make Cole blush a hot red as he considered what this might mean for him. He bit his lip...<br />
<br />
...And answered in the affirmative, &quot;Deal. I win, we go on a hot date. You win, and you get a hot vid of me and a dildo up my sweet ass. I love a babe who&#39;s not afraid to get hot and freaky with it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Well. That didn&#39;t exactly go the way that Brett thought it would.</p>
