<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan walks over to his doctor’s bag and opens it, “first, let’s listen to your heart,” he says and pulls out a stethoscope. He puts the ear pieces into his ears and then presses the other end against Jeff’s sides, causing Jeff to shiver a little. “Shh… easy girl,” Ryan says, patting the “Mare’s” side, “I know it’s cold, I promise it won’t take long,” Jeff lets out a snort. Ryan continues to listen to Jeff’s heart, moving the stethoscope back and forth, after a few minutes he stops and smiles at Jeff. “Your heart is perfect,” he says, he walks to his bag and puts the stethoscope away, “now to check your teeth and jaw,” he says and moves up to Jeff’s face. Ryan gently lifts Jeff’s lips, “beautiful and well formed teeth,” he says, he then opens Jeff’s mouth, “the jaw seems to be fine.”<br />
<br />
‘This is so effing humiliating,’ Jeff thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
“Next, let’s check your joints, muscles and hooves,” Ryan says, he then starts to squeeze Jeff’s arms-turned-forelegs, massaging them.<br />
<br />
Jeff can’t help but let out a relaxed sigh, ‘it actually feels good,’ he thinks to himself. The teen is so focused on the massage, that he does not notice Ryan lift one of his “hooves” to inspect it.<br />
<br />
“Hmm… you have some weird looking hooves,” the vet mumbles, “looks like a deformity, no worries, I have a way to fix that. Let’s check the back legs,” he then moves to Jeff’s rear and again starts to massage Jeff’s legs.<br />
<br />
Jeff closes his eyes, “I must say,” he says, “this is the best massage I have ever got,” his words, of course, come out in relaxed sounding snorts and whinnies.<br />
<br />
Ryan chuckles, “someone seems to be enjoying the treatment,” he says, giving Jeff’s butt a light pat. When Ryan moves his attention to Jeff’s back “hooves” he shakes his head, ‘her back hooves are just as deformed, she does not even have a tail! And her head looks weird, and she does not have a vagina, she does not have genitals at all!’ Ryan, just like Ken’s dad, is unable to see through the “reality fog”, which clouds his eyes. Since Ken’s dad has told the vet to check out a mare, the vet’s mind has been set to see Jeff as a mare. Jeff, of course is a human teenager and male, but the reality alteration, which Ken has set, has this error, where Jeff is seen as any type of horse, depending on the person’s mindset. This causes Jeff to appear as a miscarriage: deformed head, short “snout”, short neck, deformed hooves, tailless, furless and genderless! Ryan shakes his head, ‘luckily, I have something which will be able to fix and cure her,’ he thinks to himself, he strokes Jeff’s side and smiles, “don’t worry girl. I’ll help you,” he says, “but first, we need to check one last thing!”<br />
<br />
Jeff turns his head, ‘what is he up to now,’ he thinks to himself. The teen watches as Ryan walks back to his bag, he then watches the vet put on a plastic glove, which reaches over the man’s elbow. Jeff’s eyes widen when he realizes what Ryan is about to do, “nononono… your are NOT sticking your effing arm up my ass,” he shouts, which comes out in aggressive sounding whinnies and snorts.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, easy girl,” Ryan says, “it’ll not hurt,” Jeff does not care, he continues to snort and whinny, he even starts to buck and kick. “Listen, girl,” Ryan says, “if you don’t relax, I’ll have no choice but to stick you with another calming-injection!”<br />
<br />
Hearing this causes Jeff to stop, “no… no more needles… please!”<br />
<br />
Ryan smiles, “good girl,” he says, he then moves to Jeff’s rear, “I promise this won’t take long.”<br />
<br />
Jeff takes a deep breath, he closes his eyes and tries to relax, he feels Ryan’s fingers press against his rosebud and slowly push in. The teen bites his lower lip, for some reason, it feels good.<br />
<br />
Ryan smiles, “there’s a good girl,” he says, stroking Jeff’s butt with his free hand.<br />
<br />
Jeff groans and moans as he feels Ryan’s hand enter him more and more, until he can feel the man’s hand in his tummy, ‘th-this is unreal… and humiliating,’ he thinks to himself, ‘thank god, Ken is not here to see this!’<br />
<br />
Ryan frowns, ‘I can’t feel the womb and ovaries,’ he thinks to himself, ‘what have the breeders done! This poor animal, I need to talk to Dan about this.’ The man pulls his arm out of Jeff’s ass, earning a disappointed sounding snort from the “Horse”. Ryan chuckles, “sounds as if someone liked the treatment,” he says, patting Jeff’s side.<br />
<br />
Jeff shoots the Vet a angry look, he lets out a snort in protest, Ryan chuckles.<br />
<br />
Ryan takes off the glove, “I need to have a word with Dan,” he tells Jeff, “be a good girl, I’ll be back in a few minutes,” and with that he leaves.<br />
<br />
Jeff lowers his head, ‘what a torture,’ he thinks to himself, ‘well, at least that’s over. I hope nothing like this will happen again!’<br />
<br />
Ryan walks to the entrance of the stables, he then pulls out his phone, opens his contacts and selects Dan’s number, he then holds the phone to his ear and waits.<br />
<br />
“Ryan,” Dan’s voice says on the other end, “what’s the matter? Is something wrong with the Mare?”<br />
<br />
“Hello Dan,” Ryan says, “well, apart from her health, which is in splendid state, there are some minor issues with her. I also have a few questions about her.”<br />
<br />
“What kind of issues does she have,” Dan asks, “and what kind of questions?”<br />
<br />
“Please meet me at the stables,” Ryan says, “I’d like to tell and ask you in person.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll be right there,” Dan says and ends the call.<br />
<br />
Ryan puts his phone away, he then looks into the stables, ‘I hope Dan can tell me, where he has gotten the Mare from,’ he thinks to himself, ‘those people need to be arrested! I wonder if she is chipped… I forgot to check that, no matter, I can do that when Dan is here,’ he then hears footsteps. Ryan turns and smiles when he sees Dan hurrying towards him in a fast stride.<br />
<br />
“Ryan,” Dan says, “what’s going on?”<br />
<br />
“You tell me,” Ryan says.<br />
<br />
Dan gives Ryan a confused look, “wh-what do you mean?”<br />
<br />
Ryan sighs, “how should I start,” he asks himself, “okay, first the good news: the Mare’s in perfect health.”<br />
<br />
Dan starts to relax, he lets out a sigh of relief, “that is great news,” he says.<br />
<br />
“But,” Ryan continues, Dan looks at the vet, “have you noticed her deformations?”<br />
<br />
Dan nods, “I did,” he says, “when she arrived, I couldn’t help but notice how… well… weird she looked. I just shrugged it off as being no big deal, I guess I was just to happy to finally have received her.”<br />
<br />
“Well, here are the bad news,” Ryan says, “she is a miscarriage! Her head, face and hooves are deformed, she is missing a tail… and the worst part is: she is missing reproductive organs AND vagina!”<br />
<br />
“WHAT,” Dan yells in shock, “h-how is that possible!?”<br />
<br />
Ryan looks furious, “I suspect that she is the result of a illegal DNA experiment,” he says, he then gives Dan a serious look, “tell me truthfully: where did you get the Mare?”<br />
<br />
“I… I um…,” Dan says, he thinks about coming clean, telling Ryan that the Mare was brought to the farm by Ken, but he decides to not do it, instead he says, “I… bought her over the Internet. There were no pictures and the people did not give me any names nor address, they just told me to transfer the money and they’ll send her over.”<br />
<br />
“Did you sign a form when you received her,” Ryan asks.<br />
<br />
“I…,” Dan gulps.<br />
<br />
Ryan sighs and shakes his head, “you really need to be careful, Dan,” he says.<br />
<br />
“S-sorry,” Dan replies quietly, blushing and rubbing the back of his neck in embarrassment, “I… I guess I was just to happy to think straight.”<br />
<br />
Ryan sighs, “well, there is one way to track down the people,” he says, “but… I doubt they would have done that.”<br />
<br />
“Done what,” Dan asks.<br />
<br />
“Chipped the Mare,” Ryan says, “chipping is done to dogs and cats, but has recently found it’s hold in the equine world. Chipping a Horse is the best you can do, you do not need any paperwork and you get a passport, if you plan to travel out of country with the Horse. Also, the chip holds the information about the Horse and the owner, this helps authorities to get the horse back to the owner if it should run off, go missing or get stolen.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm…,” Dan says, “that does sound useful. It does make sense why those people would not chip her.”<br />
<br />
Ryan nods, “now, since you have already paid for her, and we have no way in tracking down those criminals,” he says, looking at Dan, “I can chip her and she’ll officially be yours.”<br />
<br />
Dan thinks for a while, “I don’t know,” he says, “if I can’t breed her, what is the point in keeping her? Wouldn’t it be best to… you know… “relief” her from her pain?”<br />
<br />
Ryan shakes his head, “killing her would be cruel,” he says, “she deserves to live.”<br />
<br />
Dan raises an eyebrow, “I know you are up to something,” he says, “I know that look. You have something in mind, what is it?”<br />
<br />
Ryan grins, “well, I have a way to fix her,” he says, “I bet you’ve heard about the “The Chronivac”, right?”<br />
<br />
Dan nods, “I sure have,” he says, “I was thinking of downloading the App-Version… wait,” he looks at Ryan, he then smiles when he gets the vet’s drift, “you want to use the App on the Mare to cure her?”<br />
<br />
Ryan nods, “correct,” he says, “with the help of the Chronivac, you will soon have the perfect Mare for breeding.”<br />
<br />
“That would be amazing,” Dan says, “but, I promised Ken he’d be aloud to use her in the upcoming Horse Race.”<br />
<br />
“Then I would wait until after the race to breed her,” Ryan says, “but I can cure and chip her now, then we don’t have to do that later. Besides, it’ll be best to not attend a Horse Race with that miscarriage. You don’t want any… uncomfortable question.”<br />
<br />
“You are right,” Dan says, “okay, let’s do this!”<br />
<br />
Ryan smiles, “good, I’ll also give her the vaccinations, I’ll do that after she is cured.”<br />
<br />
Dan nods, ‘Ken does not need to know,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I’ll download the Chronivac-App and use it on Ken to make him unaware of the change, that way, he should see the Mare as she was before the cure. OR I could download and install the App now, scan the Mare as she is, copy her freak body and transform one of the other horses into her, that way, Ken will not suspect a thing!’ So, Dan opens the App Store, he soon find the “The Chronivac-App” and installs it, he then heads into the stables with Ryan.<br />
<br />
When Ryan and Dan reach the box in which Jeff is still tied up to the wall, Ryan turns to Dan, “let me get the vaccinations and chipping ready before doing the other thing,” he says.<br />
<br />
‘What is he talking about,’ Jeff asks himself, ‘I don’t need vaccinations, and did I hear the vet say something about “chipping”? Nah, must have been my imagination.’<br />
<br />
“Sure, go ahead,” Dan says, ‘that’ll give me time to copy that freak’s body and store it in the App for later. I still have to decide, which option would be the best to do,’ he thinks to himself. Dan moves into position and without Jeff or Ryan noticing, aims his phone at the “Mare” and presses the “copy body” option in the App. The phone pings and Dan smiles when he sees a message pop up with “copy successful. Do you wish to save it for later, or use it now?” Below the message Dan can see two options: “Save” and “Use”, he selects “save”. The phone pings again and a new message appears, “copy saved and stored in the “copies” folder,” Dan smiles and closes the App, he then puts his phone into his pocket, just as Ryan turns around.<br />
<br />
“Ready to get this over with,” Ryan asks Dan.<br />
<br />
Dan nods, “yeah.”</p>
