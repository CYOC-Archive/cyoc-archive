<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He woke from his fitful slumber when the blaring of his alarm kicked off. Groaning as he aimlessly tries to smack the device on his nightstand while still in bed. Grumbling as it still refuses to stop, he begrudgingly gets up to physically end his infernal torment.<br />
“Why do you keep going if you can’t stand the time shift starts,” the female that was sleeping next to him mumbles; “it’s not as if there is any crime now.”<br />
“Just because we are all furies now,” the male yawning as he ambles to the bathroom door. “doesn&#39;t mean we all became law abidding citizens.&quot;<br />
<br />
The female snorts as she tries to fall back asleep. Lying on her belly, the spotted gecko fury mumbles as she remembers back when she and her mate first met.<br />
Living in an abandoned hotel that was turned into an unofficial homeless encampment on the Upper West Side; she was getting by shoplifting fruit from the nearby bodega for food. It was next to impossible for her to keep a job; she ran away from home and has been living on the streets since she was fourteen. She has no schooling up to elementary and can barely read. A few times social workers found her; taking her into on the pretense to help her; she just ran from them out of fear that they would send her back home. Now that she is eighteen, they leave her alone.<br />
<br />
She was sleeping in the corner of a small closet in one of suites. It was one of the few spots that wasn’t housing several junkies who are blowing their cash on a bad high from heroin that is more infant formula than anything else. She was not liking to hang out here as several regulars have tried to molest her in the pass. A few have so far tried with a weapon. One time she stabbed a would be rapist in the eye. However she needed a roof as it was raining, and a rainy New York in November is a cold New York in November.<br />
“As soon as the rain lets up,” she mutters; “then I’m out of here.”<br />
<br />
“Perhaps we can past the time together,” a slimy sounding man speaking. She recognized that voice. It was one of the men who have tried to get between her legs. She readied her make shift weapon; a short bent pipe she took from a scrap pile from a nearby construction site. The man ripping open the closet door soon howled as she cracked the pipe on one of his knee caps; dropping him to the ground as she quickly steps over him.<br />
“Bitch,” the man howling; “I’m going to get you one day!”<br />
“Not if I can help it,” she mutters as she heads up a few floors to another place to hunker down.<br />
<br />
*****************<br />
<br />
The rain kept coming as she listened to the noises it made on the window while in a room of the fifth floor. It was not a popular place as the fifth floor was home to a flock of pigeons. Most of the homeless population stayed away from the flying rat as they had a smell more vile then the sewers a few call home. But she didn’t mind the birds; they left her be and at times gave her an early warning for danger. So she started to drift off from the sound of the rain, she shivered slightly as a strong breeze gusted into the room.<br />
<br />
Breathing in deeply, she felt flushed and hot. SO hot that the thin rags she got from the local church were starting to irritate her skin. Without thinking she rips off the garments; exposing her small pert breasts. Nipples standing stiffly in the breeze. The cold breeze did little to stifle the heat welling with in. Brushing her thumbs across the pert nubs of flesh as she cups her soft melons. A pleasurable moan escapes her lips as feels pressure at the base of her spine. A small tube of flesh pushing out before it swells, growing thick. Her skin taking on a rough scaly look as black spots form on a backdrop of bright yellow flesh. Her ears disappeared leaving behind two small opening on a rapidly forming muzzle. Her eyes turning red with vertical slits for pupils. Her feet and hands now sporting claws as her newly forked tongue flicked out picking up scents her new reptilian nose misses. Runes appear on her wrists and ankles. The glow slightly as the remaining clothes she was wearing vanish and dissolves from her body. Leaving her naked but not cold; however she didn’t feel uncomfortable nor any shame. In fact she felt liberated, unencumbered with the ills of humanity.<br />
<br />
So when she hears that same voice from before; the new gecko fury knew she had the perfect moment for revenge. Without thinking she suddenly vanishes from view and watches as her tormentor enters the room. He stares straight at her but doesn’t react; he just grunts as hew shambles to the next room. She grins as she realizes that he couldn’t see her. If she wanted, she could just leave the floor and let him think she left the building. But she wanted some revenge, and there was a nagging urge for her to spread this gift to other people. So she stalked the man who tried to rape her earlier. Noting that his was limping from the smack he received earlier.<br />
“Let me kiss you all better,” she shouts as she grabs him from behind; planting a large kiss on his lips before throwing him down on the ground. She flees from him by leaping down the stairs, ignoring his impending transformation into a fury.<br />
<br />
Seeing everyone on the fourth floor all strung out from their highs, she grumbles as she gives each a small kiss; spreading the fury virus to everyone. A few start to convulse as the fury virus couldn’t change those whose bodies were too damaged from drug use. Feeling satisfied that she has spread the gift; the gecko fury looks to find someone to snuggle and possibly mate with. However she had zero interest in those who a currently in the same homeless predicament as she is. But then she spotted him. a young looking man as he flashes his light in each room he and his partner check. It was two beat cops who work from the nearby prescient. Most likely here to count the current population and issue vagrancy tickets. But still her eyes lingered on the young looking cop. Several other fury’s saw her stares as he walked by them; all invisible thanks to their runes. They all nod silently, acknowledging that she is claiming him. The other start pairing off and a few follow the older officer as she stalked the rookie.<br />
<br />
**************<br />
<br />
She pulls herself out of the bed as she slinks to the washroom. Knowing it was currently occupied did matter to her as she was awake and needed to pee. She had to squat over the toilet as her thick tail made sitting on the porcelain throne difficult at times.<br />
“Going number two is even worse,” she grumbles as her aim was a little off before adjusting; making sure the rest land in the bowl with a satisfying slash. Flushing the toilet, she smirks as her mate shouts from the sudden rush of hot water.<br />
“Make room,” she pulls back the curtain; “I’m coming in.”<br />
<br />
The male fury grumbles as he passes her a loofah. She accepts as she starts scrubbing his fury backside. Running her scaly hands up and down his wet matted fur; running her claws though his mane, followed by a light tug on his ropy tail. This spins him round and he growls slightly from his leonine muzzle.<br />
<br />
Seeing the yellow scaled female fury before him as he looks down. He slowly corners her to wall of the shower as he then presses his body up with hers. She instinctively wraps her legs around his torso as she feels his barbed prick spreading her folds. His thrusting was fast and forceful; yet each time he left her slick tunnel, the barbs on his cock caused her gasp and squirm in pleasure. It didn’t take long for him to start shooting his bullets into her fertile womb; her body shuddering in time to his spasms made him rumble in satisfaction. He steps back slightly as his feline penis slips out of her scaly snatch; his seed spilling out of her stretch entrance as the warm water from the shower quickly washes it away.<br />
“And here I thought you were content from last night,” the lion fury shutting off the water. Stepping out he tosses a towel her way as his runes glow; his fur drying and his mane naturally fluffing up. “Any reason for the shower fun?”<br />
<br />
“I was remembering the first time we met,” She sheepishly answers as she rubs the towel up and down her scaly curves; “how I jumped you in that abandoned building and rode you for the next few hours.”<br />
“You confessing to assaulting a police officers,” the lion fury smiling coly; “because that is an arrest able offence.”<br />
“Take a rain check later this evening,” she demurs; running her scaly hands through his mane; “I have a few job interviews lined up.”<br />
“See it old you,” the lion fury smiling as he gently removes her hands off his mane; “getting your high school equivalency would open doors.”<br />
“It hasn’t gotten me a job yet Toby,” the gecko fury using her mates name; “and my old habits of being homeless as still difficult to shake.”<br />
“You still attending those support groups,” Toby asking as he starts up the coffee brewer and checking his equipment for today’s duty. He is still an officer of the NYPD; however his equipment has changed now that the police force is entirely fury. Gone is the service pistol; the gun being noisy and hurting the enhanced hearing of a fury. Instead he had two stun guns along with his handcuffs and police flash light. He pours himself a cup of coffee as his runes glow and his police badge shows up on his left pectoral as a fury brand. Since furies don’t wear clothes, police officers and other civil servants needed a way to identify themselves. Temporary fury tattoos or brands were the perfect means for furies to use.<br />
<br />
“Does it hurt every time you brand yourself,” she asks; never noticing him wincing or showing any discomfort.<br />
“Nope,” Toby answers; “it’s like the fur is getting dyed.”<br />
“I’m just wondering if those with scales have it worse or not,” she responds; unsure if she would need to self-brand if she got a job that required such markings.<br />
“I doubt it,” Toby shrugging; “if you want, I could ask my partner. He is a Cobra fury with dark scales. You know him,” Toby smiling; “he was getting serviced as you were jumping my bones that day.”<br />
 “Not as intimately as I know you,” she smiles; “but I wouldn’t worry about asking him. Just come back safe,” she kisses him as he begins heading to the front door.<br />
“And you have a good day as well Betty,” Toby smiling in return.</p>
