<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec smelled the air. There was something strange up ahead and there was something happening to Vivian as well. She smelled sweet. Or at least as sweet as this body could think a woman smelled. He actually started to feel a bit peckish from the smell.<br />
He took a peek at the diminutive woman next to him. Her dirty clothes had developed new dark wet stains at the front. It dawned on him that he was smelling milk. She was lactating. A part of him really wanted to ask how she was doing, but their time was better spent focusing on what was before them.<br />
She had a very determined look on her face, with her eyes straight forward. How he hated that woman. Alec shook his head, no he didn&#39;t. Alec felt the pull to maul her get stronger the longer he stayed in this body. Hopefully this would all be over soon.<br />
<br />
They peeked through some lower bushes. <br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; Alec muttered under his breath. Right before them, in the middle of the swamp was a meadow. A perfect meadow. <br />
The grass was bright green and even from here, right in the swamp Alec could smell the freshly mowed lawn. Colorful flowers patches dotted the landscape.<br />
Alec wouldn&#39;t have been surprised to see little girls with pigtails dancing around the grass singing their ABC&#39;s. It was impossible for him to process how such a perfect meadow could exist in the middle of the swamp.<br />
But grass and flowers weren&#39;t the only things on the grass. Large wooden pens had been erected. Alec pointed his ears in their direction. He heard grunting. He heard soft whispers of strange words he couldn&#39;t make out. He could hear what appeared to be water running.<br />
The pens were spread out around the grass and all of them together surrounded a small cabin with a tower that looked to be ready to fall down. Two birch trees stood proud on opposite sides of the door.<br />
Between the pens three large ogres stomped around, still dressed in little more than a tattered loincloth. There were differences about these though. Their skin was a lighter shade, but more interestingly. They all appeared to be females, sporting massive naked breasts that stuck forward like taut balloons. <br />
&quot;Is this where the witch lives?&quot; he whispered in his sultry tones.<br />
&quot;Probably.&quot; Vivian replied. Her voice was raspy and she was breathing fast. &quot;I never got this far last time. She caught us in a clearing. If it&#39;s her hut, then at least she&#39;s probably home. Her chimney is smoking.&quot;<br />
He hadn&#39;t noticed the smoke yet. &quot;So we have the element of surprise?&quot;<br />
&quot;If we can sneak passed the ogres and we don&#39;t alert whatever is in those pens.&quot;<br />
&quot;So, what&#39;s the plan?&quot; He purred. &quot;No offense, but you don&#39;t look like you&#39;re going to sneak.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, this needs to come off.&quot; She grimaced as she removed the towel on her lower breasts letting them hang loose. Small drops of milk dripped from her teats to the ground. &quot;It&#39;s was very uncomfortable.&quot;<br />
Alec could smell her sweating, she was running out of time. &quot;Can you shoot her if I get her out of the cabin?&quot; he hissed.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s dangerous, let me think a little.&quot;<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t have time and I&#39;m super fast and silent. I&#39;m a cat remember?&quot;<br />
She flashed a smile and stroked his back. &quot;There&#39;s a brave kitty. Yes, I can hit her. I can hit her if she leaves her hut. Can you do that?&quot;<br />
Alec nodded, he was fast, he was strong, he was silent. He was probably the most dangerous thing in the direct area. He could sneak up and call out the witch.<br />
&quot;Okay then, let&#39;s try this.&quot; Vivian had her bow materialize and readied an arrow. &quot;I&#39;ll cover you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stealthy as a cat Alec burst from the bushes and bolted silently to a pen. The smell of sex was overwhelming. He peered through the cracks in the wooden boards. Half human, half poultry hybrids were scurrying around through the mud. Thick feathers of different colours and softly clucking as they pecked in the dirt of followed each other around.<br />
One suddenly bent over, her small breasts hanging before her. A look of pain in the eyes as she slowly pushed out an egg.<br />
Alec wondered if there was a pen with things Vivian was becoming.<br />
He silently ran to the next one, using his ears and nose to pinpoint the ogres. He felt unstoppable.<br />
He slipped right passed one of the ogres doing her round passed the pens. She grunted loudly and tossed some garbage into a different pen. Alec felt his claws itch, he could strike her down right now. But forced himself to remain hidden.<br />
He heard a soft whisper at a different pen. He listened closely. He heard someone whimper. <br />
&quot;help.&quot; a soft voice gurgled on the other side.<br />
He quickly located found another crack to look through. A large slug like creature was slowly slithering across the field, leaving a trail of mucus as it went. It&#39;s grey slimy body was at least as long a grown man, on the front it sported a normal woman&#39;s face. Eyes were shouting panic, while her voice softly whimpered for help as it waved some vestigial limbs around. <br />
Alec felt his skin crawl. Maybe this wasn&#39;t such a good idea.<br />
He tore himself away from the view. He could save this person if they&#39;d killed the witch.<br />
<br />
Alec crawled to the cabin. He could hear someone rummaging around inside. She was in a good mood, humming a song he didn&#39;t recognize. He felt his hairs stand on end, every fiber of this body wanted to get the hell away from here.<br />
He needed her to come out. He could yell at her, but that would alert her possibly even of their intentions. He looked back as an ogre stomped by. He knew what he had to do. They needed chaos and he knew how to cause chaos.<br />
He waited until the ogre had her back turned. He jumped forward, he bounced against the birch and extended his claws as he pounced on the Ogres back.<br />
<br />
She screamed in rage as Alec felt his jet black claws dig deep into her thick skin. She flailed her arms around at her hidden assailant. Alec felt adrenaline and something else. Something deep within howling to get out. He needed more, gone were his doubts. He could smell the ogres green blood sticking to his paws.<br />
He somehow jumped higher onto her back and slashed again, eliciting another howl of pain.<br />
Alec bared his teeth and hissed. He felt it, his body cried out for it. He was going to kill and he was loving it.<br />
A heavy punch impacted his body, he could feel the flesh tear as he was launched off his prey. The second ogre roared in rage.<br />
He slammed into a fence, with such force he heard it crack. It felt like he should&#39;ve died right then and there. But he didn&#39;t, this body was powerful. Made for killing. He jumped up on all fours, ready for round two. He was going to kill two ogres today. His tails whipped around, he bared his sharp needle like teeth and the ogres hesitated.<br />
That was all he needed. He rushed to the side and launched himself at an ogre&#39;s neck, claws extended. The slow fat creatures seemed to be standing still.<br />
<br />
A blast of air hit him, it felt like he slammed into an invisible wall. He flew back through the air and landed in the mud inside a pen. He scrambled back on his feet. His body felt like it was on auto pilot, the ground under his paws vibrated and he jumped away as large thick vines erupted from the ground.<br />
They coiled and whipped around wildly as they attempted to snatch his legs. He was quick though, he bobbed and weaved like he&#39;d never been anything but a Nekomata.<br />
A thunderous roar filled the air as a female ogre burst through the fence, fists swinging. Alec bounced away from the debris, twisting and turning in mid air to change directions again.<br />
He landed and the ground exploded below him. He immediately jumped away, but one lucky vine managed to just grab on to a hind leg. The tug hurt more than the slam into the mud that followed. Alec struggled against the vine, before her remembered his claws. He slashed the vine holding him just as multiple other vines burst from the ground and coiled around his paws and body. Slowly lifting him up from the ground. <br />
Thrashing wildly he attempted to slash them again, but the vines were holding him tight, slowly pulling his limbs apart.<br />
Only now did he noticed the cowlike creatures that had inhabited the pen he landed him. Each looked like a half human half cow hybrid, which varying parts being left as is. However, all were sporting multiple fat leaking udders.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are YOU doing here?&quot; He heard a female voice behind him. <br />
&#39;Kill the hag!&#39; he felt his body yelling at him. The plan had worked, the witch was out in the open. &#39;Kill!&#39; <br />
Now it was up to Vivian. &#39;You can&#39;t trust the woman!&#39; <br />
He focused, his mind struggled to push the thoughts away as his body struggled against the vines.<br />
&quot;Your kind doesn&#39;t come here. Why are you here?&quot; Her voice sounded less angry, more intrigued. She didn&#39;t sound like an old hag though, she sounded much younger. He wished he could see her, that way he could at least take her body should something happen.<br />
&quot;Did you belong with that odd disturbance I felt earlier? Your kind likes men don&#39;t they?&quot; She said, disgust dripping from her voice. &quot;Where is he? It was such a strange reading.&quot; <br />
He felt the vines writhe around his legs, growing tighter. What was Vivian taking so long. He felt his body&#39;s instincts gnawing at his consciousness.<br />
&quot;But why are you here?&quot; Her tone had switched to a more sweet motherly sound.<br />
He heard something slam the mud. An ogre lumbered in view.<br />
&quot;I know your kind can talk. Answer me.&quot; Intrigue was making room for impatience. He felt more vines twisting around his hind legs. <br />
&quot;NOW! ANSWER!&quot; Her voice sounded like thunder, his hairs stood on end.<br />
Alec scanned the border, no sign of Vivian. Did she abandon him? &#39;As expected.&#39; No! It wasn&#39;t as expected. He focused, what was he going to do? How did Nekomata talk? He needed to answer now, buy them more time. Surely she would come any moment now. <br />
&quot;I&#39;m lost?&quot; He purred.<br />
He moves his ears, she was walking around him. Was she going to come into view? He craned his neck.<br />
&quot;Lost?&quot; She sounded bemused. &quot;We have a lost little kitty. Here? In my swamp?&quot; The threat below the calm surface of her voice sent his instincts into overdrive, his claws slid in and out uncontrollably. He needed to get the hell out of here. <br />
&quot;Look around you. I love pets.&quot; She stopped moving, but was still out of view. &quot;Do you want to be my newest pet?&quot;<br />
Simple yes or no question that Alec didn&#39;t want to answer. Alec struggled against the vines slithering uncomfortably around his legs.<br />
&quot;ANSWER!&quot;<br />
His Nekomata eyes easily saw the arrow coming from across the field. It was fast, but he was faster. Like a green bolt of lightning it flew from across the field. Yet, instinctively Alec felt something was off. It was slower, somehow less steady than the arrow he&#39;d seen her shoot earlier.<br />
Alec spotted Vivian near the edge of the pen. She didn&#39;t look good though. She&#39;s left her other bra&#39;s behind. Six large leaky breasts hung heavily from her chest, her face twisted in grim determination.<br />
<br />
Alec heard the arrow hit the ground behind him. She&#39;d missed, the witch howled in rage. &quot;YOU!&quot;<br />
The air tingled around them, a massive bolt of energy streaked passed Alec, singing his fur. The other side of the pen exploded. &quot;I&#39;ll make you eat dirt for the rest of your life!&quot; She screeched. Another bolt blazed passed him and another section of fence blew up. He spotted Vivian on all fours scrambling for safety.<br />
The fat sluggish cow beings around him panicked, some mooed, some slurred some words of confusion as they struggled to get their fat bodies away.</p>
