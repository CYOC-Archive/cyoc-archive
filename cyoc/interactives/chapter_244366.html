<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well, do we want to keep playing with this thing?” Ed asks as he pulls his shirt to hide his boyhood. <br />
<br />
Simon, Ed and Heather looked between each other for a few moments before Simon spoke up. “Well, I would like my tail back… Maybe a few more changes. Just not that Random deal again…” <br />
<br />
All three agreed to that quickly. “Yeah, I guess that was my bad.” Heather adds as she adjusts her clothes on her body. Some of the gunk that was on her made her closes get stuck to her skin. “But I wouldn’t mind trying a tail too, but I had wanted to see what it would be like being a little older… Maybe sixteen like our cousin Susan.” Heather then tugs at her chest, her budding breasts sticking to her shirt. “I wouldn’t mind seeing how I would compare to her…” <br />
<br />
“How about this?” Ed spoke up, “Simon can set the program to age us all to sixteen, but with different animal features.” <br />
<br />
“Okay… but… what about our clothes. Mind barely fit whine I was sixteen before, and the tail made it harder…” Heather then cut off Simon to put in her idea. <br />
<br />
“Look, we seen each other’s bodies now. You two had plenty of time to look me over, and Ed is still hanging out over there. Lets just…” She takes a breath and sighs before continuing. “Strip down and then do it… the change thing. Okay. Just see if there is a setting to have people think it is normal just in case your parents her home.” <br />
<br />
Simon nods as he walks over to the computer. The three start to strip, their bodies for all to see as Simon works on the program. After a few minutes, he turned his head to his now nude friends, the two of them trying not to look at his body. “Okay, I found a reality change that says everyone else will thing out changers are normal. Also, I found a pleasure option for the change. I didn’t really feel anything before, so this may make it more fun. Now, our new ages are put in, but what about the animal features we want. I say let’s stick to ears and tails now.” <br />
<br />
“Hey, changed the … genitals too. I don’t want to have to look at those things you have the whole time. Animals hide their stuff.” Heather says, choking on a few words. <br />
<br />
“Okay…” Simon replies, “But what animals? What tail did I have?” <br />
<br />
“I think you had a fox’s tail…” Ed replies. “but what animal do you want Heather?” <br />
<br />
Heather thinks for a moment, “Can I have a dragon? If not, a cool lizard would be fine. I just wanted a dragon so I could keep my ears and see how their tails feels.” <br />
<br />
Simon looks in the program. “It does show Dragon as an option… Ed?” <br />
<br />
“Well, you are a fox, and Heather will be a dragon… How about I be some sort of big cat? Maybe a tiger?” Simon nods to Ed’s request, placing the info in. <br />
<br />
“Okay, if this works, we will be sixteen-year-old, nude teens with animal tails, ears and …other stuff. Not quite antro, but almost there… okay… Here we go…” Simon hits enter and then stands to face his friends. <br />
<br />
The three look at each other, waiting for their changes as the computer speeds up. Then the three of them get his with a wave of pleasure as their bodies start to grow.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t think that it would feel like this… Ooohhhh.” Heather moans as the three kid’s heights start to increase. Her body starts to go through an advanced puberty as her hands rise to her budding breasts. Her small cones start to round out, her areola stretching and growing and her nipples growing erect. A New feeling came from between her legs as her womanly lips start to grow wet. <br />
<br />
Heather looks up to see the boys experiencing something similar. Both Simon’s and Ed’s cocks start to grow painfully erect, stretching from their bodies. The boys both reach for their junk as their balls grow, fur starting to cover the sacks. Then, both of their cocks start to inflate out, the skin around them forming furry sheaths. Simons is cover in white and light orange fur as Ed’s is covered in dark orange fur with small black strips. Then, as the sheathes form, both boys moan as their new animal cocks start to grow out. A small read tipped rocket with a knot grows out of Simon’s sheath as a dark pink pointed cock with barbs grows out of Ed’s. <br />
<br />
Heather is then drawn back to her own crotch as her wetness grows. She looks down to see small blue scales now covering her slit, it growing wider and slightly outwards. It was as if it was there to waiting for something to come in it. <br />
<br />
The three growing teens then moan in unison as their spins start to stretch. Simon’s Fox’s tail grows back in while Ed’s tiger tail grows and thickens behind him. While Simon’s tail was nice and fluffy, Ed’s looked like he could whip someone with it. As their tails grow, the boys muscles feel the new testosterone from their growing animal cocks. <br />
<br />
Ed body starts to buff up, his chest pushing out some. His arms and legs bulk to that of a high school football player in his first years. Simon on the other hand, while his muscles grew, they took on a more lean tone, similar to a basketball player. <br />
<br />
Heather on the other hand… her tail grew in long and thick. She stumbles backwards some, leaning her thickening butt on Simon’s bed. Then, she lets out a low growl as the tail pushed out of her body. The base of the tail grew almost as wide as her ass, the tip of the tail stretching to the other end of Simon’s bed. Then, the scales grew in, light red with some shades of blue to match her groin. Then, from the tip of the tail up her spine, small little and soft spikes start growing every other inch. The spiles went from her tail tip up to between her shoulder blades. As the tail finished growing, Heather couldn’t hold back the growing heat between her legs, and she cums for the first time, a light trail of juices going down her legs. <br />
<br />
The boys weren’t far behind. As the three’s ears start to grow in… Hearther’s ears growing pointed out to the side and covered with scales that match her tail… Simon and Ed’s ears grew to the top of their heads, matching the animals they were now a part of. Their cocks bounce in the air, larger and thicker than they thought possible at their old ages. Pre dripping from both, the boys let out howls of bliss as they let loose their loads on the nearby wall. <br />
<br />
With one last pulse in their bodies, the three now sixteen year olds all let out a moan as their bodies pushed out one last time. Heather reached for her breasts, cupping them as they grew larger between her fingers. Both boys stretch up taller, their new manhoods still dripping from their release. <br />
<br />
AS the changes came to an halt, so did the strange feeling of pleasure the three felt. They looked at each other, taking in their and their friends’ new bodies. The small of their new musk and hormones grew in their noses. They all three saw each other in a new light… Their bodies pleading to their minds.</p>
