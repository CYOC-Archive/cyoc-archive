<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sleep still heavy in his eyes, Francisco wandered into the bathroom. Pulling down his boxers, he heard a small *riiip* as the already-torn cloth fell to the floor. 'Damn, those must've shrunk in the wash..' his sleep-adled mind thought.<br />
<br />
Reaching between his legs, he guided his dick towards the toilet bowl, and let loose. Blinking, he looked down, as not all felt right. 'Fuck, what's wrong with me today? First my clothes all go wierd, then I feel like I'm growing, now I'm dreaming I've got a footlong dick.' Finishing up, he reached for boxers that no longer existed. 'Damn, what a funky dream.'<br />
<br />
Standing there in nothing but undersized socks, Francisco suddenly felt the urge to yawn and stretch. Standing straight up, arms reaching back, he felt a sharp pain on the top of his head. &quot;Damn! Wha-?&quot; He looked up, only to see the bathroom ceiling within inches of his nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the HELL?!&quot;<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
&quot;C'mon, he's gonna figure it out any second. We've gotta find a way to reverse it.&quot; Ric looked through the book, but couldn't find anything saying 'Undo' or 'Reverse', despite Josh practically beating him on the back to do so.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, they heard a sharp BANG! from the bathroom, followed by &quot;What the hell?!&quot; from a deep, masculine voice that sounded like it could rattle the windows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap! Hurry!&quot; Josh prodded Ric in the back yet again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it! I'm looking as fast as I can!&quot; Ric flipped a few more pages, checking headers. &quot;Maybe we can make something up to cover it..&quot;<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Looking into the mirror, or rather, bending down to look into the mirror, despite it being a 3-foot tall, 4-foot wide mirror, Francisco looked himself over. At first he was shocked, the huge muscles, his altered face, the excess of bodyhair, his DICK! But soon he couldn't help but admire the changes. In fact, he thought he looked damn sexy.<br />
<br />
His face was now much broader, and covered in hair. A heavy, thick beard had grown on his face, but it only enhanced the new shape of his mouth, chin, and jaw. His eyebrows were thicker, almost to the point of growing together, the new muscle of his forehead making him almost look like a cave man. Even his nose had grown a bit, mainly in the bridge.<br />
<br />
Reaching up, he touched the ceiling with his now much larger, hairier palm, guiding himself up to check his height against the 8' ceiling. His hair brushed the paint, and he still had a small bump on his head from where he'd hit the projecting plastic panel that concealed the room's lightbulbs. 7'10&quot;, then, maybe 7'11&quot;.<br />
<br />
Looking down his body, he could barely see over the globes of his chest muscles, and the forest of chesthair that darkened them. He could barely see skin, in some places. That hair spread wide, towards his shoulder, diving down into his armpits to create one solid patch of hair from armpit to armpit, enhancing the heavy look of his now hugely-muscled arms. It also trailed south, going thinner down the middle of his now-rippled stomach, but spreading wide around the navel. From there it got thicker, merging with the furry growth of his crotch, from which projected his new dick.<br />
<br />
Ah, his dick. Thick and heavy, even while limp, he lifted it, comparing it to the length of his toothbrush. It had to be over a foot in length, 4&quot; in diameter, with a head the size of a small apple. Sitting there now, in one muscular, broad hand, it began to erect as he considered the massive and incredible changes to his body. His balls, now covered in thick hair, bounced below, looking like dark, furry canteloupes.<br />
<br />
Stroking himself with one hand, he felt his muscular chest and shoulder with the other, feeling how his chest-hair went up as well as down, merging seamlessly with the beard on his neck. Continuing, he felt his muscular shoulder and arm, the football-sized biceps flexing as he enclosed the now-massive shaft. That thing had to be nearly 20&quot; long, maybe more! Groping his balls for a moment, they felt even larger than before, and he had to sit down on the toilet seat to steady his rapidly-beating heart.<br />
<br />
'Damn! This is incredible!' he thought, loving every moment.<br />
<br />
Getting fully into it, he put both hands on his enlarged dick, stroking up and down the length, closing his eyes and lifting his head back. Bumping the wall behind him, he stretched his legs forward to the far wall to brace himself, as he began jacking off in earnest. He moaned, unconciously, a deep vibration in his chest that seemed to rattle the room.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck is he doing in there?&quot; Josh wondered aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you know?&quot; Ric asked, listening to the telltale thumping noise coming from the bathroom, followed by a very deep moan, and more thumping, faster and faster.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, what?&quot; Josh honestly didn't understand.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll find out in a minute. I figured out how we'll cover this up. It looks like the changes to Mr. Mendes are permanent, but I think we can do the same thing to ourselves, sorta, and make it look completely unexplainable.&quot; Ric flipped to the page with the spell Mendes had received, then to a modifier keyword that made it work a lot slower.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man...&quot; Francisco moaned, nearing the breaking point. His balls ached. His arms were buzzing. His dick felt like it could shoot a hole through bulletproof glass.. 'Here it is.. here it IS.. THIS IS IT!!' his mind screamed, as his body convulsed.<br />
<br />
Whiteout.<br />
<br />
Then he shot a second time, and the pleasure kept going. He could still hear the first shot hitting the wall above his head, as if the years of pleasure he'd just felt, and was still feeling, had only happened in a matter of milliseconds. The second shot hit him on the forehead, the third, a stinging shot to the eyelid, the fourth, fifth, and sixth into and around his bearded mouth. Up his nose, even.<br />
<br />
The orgasm, now fading to an electric shock running throughout his body, continued, giving him six more shots down the chest and stomach, and finally spurted out continuously for another five seconds, pouring down the 23&quot; pole and over his fingers, pooling on his groin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoah.&quot; Francisco breathed heavily.</p>
