<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Battamaea was feeling very unsteady in her new body, and she looked a little scared.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay?” Luka asked, squeezing her sister’s hand.<br />
<br />
Battamaea was gasping and clutching her other hand to her chest. “I have just never felt this frail before,” she said. “I am afraid to move because I fear I will break. I am afraid someone will hurt me.” She began to cry, just as Luka had, as the quick emotionality of her new body took its toll. “And I am cold! So cold!” she sobbed.<br />
<br />
“Come with me to your dragon,” Luka said softly, standing up and urging her sister to follow her.<br />
<br />
Teach was lying passively on his side at the other side of the room like an obedient and loyal hound, the golden-scaled dragon looking anxious for his Rider. “Will she be alright?” he asked meekly. “Why is she crying?”<br />
<br />
Luka spoke to Teach as she would to a small child, knowing that the dragon was anxious and would therefore be comforted by someone appearing to be in charge. “She will need you to make her feel safe for a while, pretty dragon,” she said soothingly. “I bet you could do that, couldn’t you?” She beckoned Battamaea to kneel down in the curve of the dragon’s body, which she did.<br />
<br />
Battamaea collapsed agsinst Teach’s warm flank, grasping at him as if he were the last solid thing that existed. For a while, all she was able to do was shudder and let the storm in her play itself out. “I am being ridiculous,” she said in tones of self-loathing.<br />
<br />
Luka stroked her sister’s arm comfortingly. “You are a woman now, Tammy,” she said firmly. “It will take you a long time to learn the self-discipline to rein in and deal with your emotions before they become a problem. You can’t put up a cool front and drink away your problems later. Not anymore. You have to be grown-up in ways you never had to be as a man.”<br />
<br />
Karyu came over and lay himself opposite of Teach, completing a circle around the two beautiful women. “Just as our Riders have taken care of us, Teach, we have to take care of them,” he said. “Let your insticts guide you, brother in scales.”<br />
<br />
Teach blushed a little bit, and he awkwardly closed his wing around his rider, who yelped and cowered at first from the unexpected contact. “Like this?” he asked nervously, seeming to be afraid that he would break her.<br />
<br />
Luka giggled at the scene and snuggled against her dragon, prompting Karyu to drape his wing around her confidently. It was a curious dichotomy. Luka was clearly in charge of her magnificent black and red dragon, and he was clearly obedient to her. However, Karyu also fell easily into a male role with his female Rider, taking on the same posture as a loyal hound guarding his mistress. The two utterly trusted each other, and they were as comfortable nestled together as if they had been born that way, a mistress and her loyal beast. Like the image of Lilith with the snake, she looked both confident and beautiful, knowing how foolish her dragon was for her lovely nakedness.<br />
<br />
Teach tried to imitate Karyu, closing his wing aroung Battamaea in a gallant and protective way. This had the intended effect of consoling Battamaea, who felt much less naked and exposed with her body surrounded by a powerful male that she trusted. Not being as secure yet in her sexuality, she seemed less like a woman and her beast and more like a little girl clinging to her oversized plush bear. It was a most adorable scene, to be sure. As the woman calmed, she quietly lay her head against Teach’s firm, muscular body. Quickly, she found that making herself feel soft caused Teach to close his wing around her tighter, which made her feel more protected. Soon, she was nestled up against the dragon’s side as if she had been born a soft, beautiful woman, letting a great, scaly, golden beast hold her like his prize.<br />
<br />
Teach giggled a little. “I guess I could get used to this,” he said happily. Having such a pretty thing in his wing made him feel rich, and he realized he liked feeling rich. A trail of smoke drifted up from his nostrils.<br />
<br />
Karyu decided to let Teach have his fun for now, knowing it would be only a matter of time before the golden dragon was just another smitten pussy-whipped fool. “Well, you two do as you please, but I am tired from a long day,” he said, yawning heavily and sprawling his cat-like form out. He gripped a hind-talon with an audible clicking sound, and he decidedly had the air of a male who had just realized that, while sex felt quite nice, it felt better in a rested body.<br />
<br />
Luka slapped her dragon playfully on his side. “You lazy drake! I did all of the work,” she giggled. She yawned, too, though, and she realized, after so much excitement, that some rest would be a good idea. “So you two can spend the night as you please,” she said to Battamaea and Teach, “but Karyu and I will be catching some shut-eye before doing anything too strenuous.” She stretched out her foot and rubbed it against Karyu’s sheath, which swelled up just slightly as the dragon already began to sail toward slumber.</p>
