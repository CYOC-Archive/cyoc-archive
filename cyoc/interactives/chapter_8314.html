Ben smiled to himself and, after looking over his choices once more, decided to make the change gradual.  Scrolling to the bottom, he glanced at the options for "Time Until Change", "Time Taken By Change" and "Duration of Change".  Thinking about it, he changed the initial settings to something that would be a bit more interesting as he planned to step out into his new life.</p>

<p>
<i>Time Until Change Begins:  1 hour 30 minutes</i> (...he should be just into his first set by then...)<br />
<i>Time Taken By Change:  5 minutes</i> (...that should be interesting to watch; subtle at first but far more dramatic towards the end...)<br />
<i>Duration of Change:  permenant (or until changed again)</i> (...why not?...)</p>

<p>
It was strange.  His finger lingered on the mouse button of his computer as he contemplated his day.  So strange.  An hour ago he was an accountant who'd just dumped his boyfriend ... now, with a few clicks of a mouse he had a new job, a new body and new excitement brimming on the horizon of his otherwise dull sex life.  Perhaps it was the change in his chemistry but his normal concerns about what such a strange and obviously potent change would cost him just never really settled in his mind.</p>

<p>
Afterall, if they were going to post such things publically on a web site, they shouldn't expect to get much for it in a monetary sense...</p>

<p>
Nodding to himself, he hit the "TRANSFORM" button on the web page.  The browser window cleared and began to re-load with the new page, an inset image of himself slowly downloading to his computer.  He could feel a strange rush move through him from the top of his scalp through his torso and (nicely built) cock-n-balls down to the soles of his feet.</p>

<p>
"So, that's what it feels like to be a loading web page..." he muttered, idly.</p>

<p>
As he watched the changes show up with the small words "APPROVED" next to each one, he smiled.  A small timer was already counting down at the top of the page:  <i>TIME UNTIL CHANGE BEGINS:  1 hour 29 minutes</i>.  Just enough time for him to get to work...</p>

<hr />

<p>
The lights of the club would've been enough to generate a seizure in any epilleptic unlucky enough to walk in.  The pounding beat of the speakers, too, were more than enough to make any man deaf in seconds.  Well, any man other than the huge number of them gyrating to the music on the flickering surface of the glass dance floor.</p>

<p>
Ben shook his head.  This wasn't the sort of place he'd imagined ... not really the sort of place he'd ever gone, before.  However, it was where he was employed, now, and he had a job to do.</p>

<p>
Normally, he figured he'd be having a huge bout of stage fright, however -and this was probably due to the program he'd run- he knew exactly what he needed to do.  He knew the moves, knew how to feel the audience and knew how to perform in this kind of environment.  Stage fright wasn't an issue.</p>

<p>
Finally, the overhead speakers in the club cut through the blazing techno dance sounds with the announcement he'd been waiting for...</p>

<p>
"Ok, gentlemen ... get ready for our latest and greatest attraction here at Casablanca's...  The man with all the greatest moves ... the fellah you've <i>all</i> wanted to see ... the one, the only ... <i>Dick Dancer</i>!"</p>

<p>
The club burst into scattered cheers and a roar of applause as Ben chuckled at his stage name and leapt out in front of the teeming masses!  The lights were so bright they nearly blinded him but not so much so that he missed his cue.  Grabbing the stripper's pole, he immediately worked his way into an energetic frenzy, moving his feet as accurately as any Olympic gymnast's; his hips, waist and chest swaying hypnotically to the cheers and whistles of the boys gathered, below, in the shadows.</p>

<p>
He hid his grin and adopted a sultry gaze of confidence and supremacy while he worked his way through his routine.  His timing was perfect.  Just as he was down to his tiny, tight speedo's, he could feel the timer of the web page go into effect.</p>

<p>
At first there was no response from the crowd; it looked more like he was getting a hard-on than anything strange was happening.  However, as he slowly slid his thumbs into the waistband of his speedos and pulled down, the guys up front in the audience gradually realized the fact that Mr. Dancer was getting bigger...</p>

<p>
Much bigger...</p>

<p>
It felt fantastic.  Ben didn't recall having told the web page to make the sensation an erotic one but it must have been a side-effect of the portions of his anatomy that he was fooling with.  Slowly, steadily, his massive endowments grew bigger, filling out and bulking up.  He could feel his massive penis getting heavier, pulling down on his abodmen beneath his toned, slim six-pack of a belly and swaying with every gyration.</p>

<p>
The crowd started going wild.</p>

<p>
He grinned as he felt his balls filling out, pushing against the stretching material and filling with what could only be described as his extremely potent seed.</p>

<p>
The dance whipped him into a frenzy; the music like a drug ... the applause and cheers like an aphrodesiac.  He had to use almost all his will to keep from getting hard as his mammoth cock -over the five minutes he'd arranged- slowly grew to a whopping eleven inches soft with titanic balls and a massive, meaty swing...</p>

<p>
Looking down at the crowd, he realized that this was what had been missing in his life.  So what about Doug dumping him?  He was wanted, now!  He had everything!  He could have even more if he wanted ... this was FANTASTIC!</p></p>
