<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris realized that for all of this time, someone had been knocking on the door. She walked down the rest of the stairs, her mind still reeling with the realization of what had happened to her.<br />
<br />
She still seemed to remember her life as it was. Everything felt too real to be a dream! If it was true ... if someone haden't of just changed the pictures, Chris' entire life history was different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I can get through this. I can find a cure. I just have to go back to that store and get that guy to fix me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris ran to the door, temporarily forgetting that she wasen't wearing anything with the exception of her panties. She was used to running around in only boxers as a guy. Having to cover her chest (unless she went to the store, work or school) was not something she knew as normal.<br />
<br />
Opening the door, she saw it was Bob. He was dressed in a teeshirt and shorts. He still looked like the Bob she'd known but something was different.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, thanks for the view Chris. But, since when do you walk around topless?&quot;<br />
<br />
Topless; that was a word Chris was not used to associating with herself. The very idea that she had to cover her chest just wasen't right.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean? Oh my God, I forgot about...&quot;<br />
<br />
Covering her chest, Chris moved so Bob could get in. He closed the door behind him. Bob walked over to Chris and kissed her on the cheek. As he did so, Chris felt a tingle. Not an enjoyment of the sensation, but a memory. <br />
<br />
It was similar to not studying a field of mathematics for years and forgetting it. Then one day you take lessons in it again and everything flows back into your mind as if you never forgot it.<br />
<br />
Chris experienced that when Bob kissed her. It was a familiar sensation. She felt a wave of emotions and memories flow into her mind. Now, she remembered being at the amusement park that day as a girl! She remembered how she felt when he won that prize for her! She coulden't remember being there as a guy!<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Bob asked.<br />
<br />
Chris put her arms to her side. Bob looked right at her, a smile on her face. Feeling the blood rushing to her cheeks, Chris shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not supposed to be a girl, that's what's wrong! I'm not supposed to have these!&quot; Chris said, pointing at her chest.<br />
<br />
Bob looked right at her. Chris knew that to Bob her body was as it always was. She did her best to realize that nothing what out of the ordinary for him. If anything, she was probably scaring him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay Chris?&quot; Bob said. The concern in his voice was genuine.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I ... this is going to sound crazy but everything is wrong!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you should lay down?&quot; Bob suggested.<br />
<br />
Chris walked Bob into the living room and they both sat down. Chris coulden't stop staring at her chest. She wanted to say she was male, but with those two things on her chest, it was rather difficult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me get dressed first,&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
She ran upstairs into her room and opened her drawers. All of her clothes had changed. She shook her head and pulled out a light blue teeshirt and put it on. She grumbled at the feel of the fabric against her nipples. She grumbled again at the tented shirt her reflection had. She then dressed in a pair of jeans and socks, grumbling once more as the women's socks.<br />
<br />
Fully dressed, Chris looked at her reflection. A beautiful young woman looked back at her. If she knew that said beautiful woman wasen't sure, she'd probably be excited. Instead, she was frightened. As she further looked at her reflection and considered her new wardrobe, she felt another surge of memory. Now, she knew what all of her clothes looked like in the here and now! In fact, she coulden't remember how her clothes were supposed to look!<br />
<br />
She still had the necklace on and took it off in the faint hope it might reverse the changes. Unfortunately, it didn't. Putting it back on, she headed back downstairs.<br />
<br />
Bob was still there and he looked concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to stop the show but there's something we need to talk about,&quot; Chris said. Bob looked at her, his eyes going wide. &quot;No, I'm not breaking up with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what's wrong? What did you when you said you're not supposed to have breasts and that you're not supposed to be a girl?&quot; Bob asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ... it's hard to explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob stood up, walked over to Chris and gave her a hug. This brought more memories. She remembered them hugging after football games. If his team lost, she hugged him to give him support. If they'd won, she hugged him to congratulate him. She tried to remember playing on the football team but she just coulden't seem to access that memory. It was if the memory no longer existed. Now, she remembered cheers and even just how to do them. This was getting scary!<br />
<br />
When Bob released Chris, she looked him in the eyes. As far as Bob knew, they were a couple. Chris would break his heart if she told him the truth. Heck, it was getting hard enough for her to remember the truth, assuming anything was true.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try,&quot; Bob said.<br />
<br />
&quot;See this necklace?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
Bob nodded. &quot;it's pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bought it yesterday and I felt this urge to have it on as I slept. When I woke up, I was as you see me now. Then everything looked like I'd always been a girl! As far as I remember, last night I was a guy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that's crazy! I don't remember you being a guy ... ever! What about that time I invited you to my 8th birthday party? Remember that cute pink dress you wore?&quot; Chris suddenly remember it as if it had really happened to her. &quot;Or those times you helped me with math in 8th grade?&quot; Chris remember them working on math together and both struggling with it. Or did she? That old memory seemed to vanish and now, she remembered Bob's version of it as reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is crazy! When you kissed me suddenly I remembered it as normal. When I put these clothes on, I remembered my wardrobe as the way it is! Every time you mentioned a memory, it appears in my head! It's like this isn't my reality yet it is!&quot; Chris said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you just had a bad dream? You know how those can confuse you as  to what is real and what isn't?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is real? Why does that sound familiar?&quot; lights went on in Chris' head. Now she remembered taking philosophy classes! Instead of taking chemistry, she'd taken those! In fact, as she thought about it, the idea of taking chemistry didn't make seance at all! &quot;My philosophy teacher Mrs. Trent said something about that. She said what  we define as reality is often only what we perceive. But if I remember that I was a guy but the way things are now is reality then what's going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know. I ... if you said this happened when you bought that necklace, maybe the guy you bought it from can help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris nodded but considered her actions. If she changed things back somehow, would she be losing a relationship? Was there a reason for her to become this way?</p>
