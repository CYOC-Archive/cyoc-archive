<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harken immediately took the wheel and decided to steer this situation in the right direction. First he needed to get on his swim-wear, since it’d be pretty silly to be on the beach with baggy cargo jeans and a hoodie. He found a black pair of trunks that came down to his knee, a black t shirt to cover his girly torso and some sandals. Hark also took a small mirror with him. Something was driving to make haste. He sped out the door without a word to his parents and charged towards the sandy shores. For some reason, he felt like he was faster than usual, which could be a possibility considering what happened…<br />
<br />
When he was there, he noticed an extremely horrifying scene! A large woman in a bikini. Ew. Gross. Other than that, it seemed very relaxing and peaceful. He moved to the secluded dunes and looked into the tiny mirror for some guidance.<br />
<br />
“Infel, where is it, I can’t see it.” Harken asked, glancing around to make sure no one saw him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the blue eyed-blue haired-pale skinned figure popped up in the mirror. “Well, I guess it’s resting in the cove right now. I wonder what you’ll actually find there… Oh yeah, as to fighting this thing… You could use your fists after using up a power up chant. Or maybe just blast it with magic. It all should come natural to you. I hate to give compliments, but I think you’ll do just fine. You may seem slow, but you’re a good kid from what I saw.”<br />
<br />
“Er… Thanks?” Harken didn’t know you could compliment someone after insulting them. Sounds like a fun way to go about things… He also assumed she knew everything about his life, seeing how she makes her home in his mind. At least there’s nothing to really be ashamed of. He stopped dwelling on those thoughts and tucked away the mirror. The thing was resting so he could take it by surprise… Maybe.<br />
<br />
The cove was just a few minutes worth of running away, and in it he saw a great beast resting on a craggy platform above the water. In the water was a skeleton, meaning some unlucky soul stumbled upon this spot before Hark did. Harken froze in his tracks as he saw it… it looked like a shark with little fin-like legs and an extremely oversized jaw. “How could this thing suck out souls when it looked more like it would be a meat grinder than a vacuum Well, whatever, that isn’t important.”<br />
<br />
The thing slowly stirred as it awakened, eyes of black and red now staring at him. The first thing Harken though was “Oh shit. I’m gonna die.”  - The next thing that happened… Well, it just happened so fast. The thing lunged at him and he miraculously avoided it, soon his hands were waving in the air like he just didn’t care. Rather, one hand was guiding a ball of mana at the monster while nearly silent and foreign words escaped his lips. Before he knew it, the thing vaporized into dark powder.<br />
<br />
“What the…?” Harken asked himself, looked at his hand that just cast a ball of whatever at that whatsamajigger.<br />
<br />
“That’s what I meant.” An of so familiar voice rang out. “All the past Chosen Ones sort of work with you… Of course as you advance along in your training, they will no longer help you. So you better get into shape.”<br />
<br />
“So that must means I would’ve sunk and they threw me some floaties.” Harken muttered.<br />
<br />
“Well no. You wanted to do that. The past Chosens just helped you put your body into gear. If you were truly weak, you would’ve been that thing’s breakfast. Or worse yet, it would’ve made you burst into a thousand pieces. I saw it happen once, it was very interesting. There were literally a thousand pieces; it was sort of hard to count all those gory little bits though.” <br />
<br />
“I feel funny…” Harken mentioned as his hand shot to his stomach, even though he was feeling strange all over.<br />
<br />
“Probably some heroic development as you’d call it. You really don’t contain much muscle mass what-so-ever. Chances are your muscles are spazzing out over what you just did. Remember what I mentioned earlier? Your body is preparing for change. After all, you can’t defend much looking the way you do now!”<br />
<br />
“This is all too weird… I mean, I wanted to be all manly looking and stuff… But this is sort of me… It’d be terrible to lose it over night.” Harken said with a sigh, he did want to look more mature, but he was just so use to his current form.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it, the changes are really small. Usually it looks like the person had been working out for a week. You’ll probably grow a bit taller and so on. That’s only because you done something good with your powers, if you misuse them by harming people who don’t deserve it, you’ll grow more… But it’ll be in a more twisted way. You know, hunch back, drooping flab and skin. Though, you shouldn’t really have to worry Harken.”<br />
<br />
“What if I don’t like the changes…?” Harken asked, hoping it wouldn’t come to being stuck like the new him in the near future.<br />
<br />
“You can always transform back. Since you passed your little trial with such ease, you can now change those who deserve it. Like for instance, if there’s a gifted or steroid abusing guy who throws his weight around, you could change him into a Fatty McFatty until he learns his lesson. Alternatively, if there’s a weakling you can change him to be stronger. People will automatically accept the new form of the person since that’s how the magic works, the person you changed will be aware of the changes. If someone sees the transformation, they won’t be fooled by your magic and will probably blather on about what they saw. Doing something like this will net you some “hero points” as well, you know, as long as it’s justified and not just for poo and giggles.”<br />
<br />
“You talk so much… But uh… What do you mean by hero points…?” Harken’s brain was sort of hurting from all this woman’s talking, he wasn’t sure if he’d like the long winded answer to this question.<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s called a ‘joke’. There’s no such thing as hero points. But it basically means you’ll grow a bit more towards looking like the hero you’re destined to be. Speaking of destiny, don’t you have school right about now? You should use your magic to change and then warp to school… Just concentrate to get it to work. It’ll be good for practice. Now I’m off.”<br />
<br />
“… Crap. School!” Harken yelled. With all the commotion, he forgot that he was a normal teenager… Or he was supposed to be one. He definitely had to try out this changing bit at school too. “Well, here goes!” And there he went.</p>
