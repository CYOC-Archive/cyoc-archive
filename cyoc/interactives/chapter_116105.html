<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick didn&#39;t talk to Chad after he removed Chad&#39;s manhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;So now what?&quot; asked Bruno.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you go home, dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Chad?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, do you think anyone will be looking for him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bruno, Bruno, Bruno,&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
Chad could imagine him shaking his head, as he spoke.  He couldn&#39;t see anything with Rick&#39;s shirt and pants covering him in darkness. As Rick walked, he&#39;d catch flashes of light up Rick&#39;s pant legs, otherwise he was in the dark. At least he could still hear.  And unfortunately, he could still smell.  He tried to focus on anything other than his missing manhood.  As soon as the drawstring was gone from the suit, Chad realized he could no longer feel his cock and balls.  He had been emasculated by his buddy Rick - yeah, some buddy.  His self image now portrayed his young athletic body as always, but with the anatomical inaccuracy of a Ken doll. He was smooth between his thighs.  It wasn&#39;t possible.  If they change him back now, he&#39;d be some sort of freak without a cock and balls.<br />
<br />
In his horror of self-realization that he was now just some jock&#39;s Speedo, and if he ever changed back to human, he&#39;d be a eunuch, Chad zoned out.   He missed the conversation that Bruno and Rick had with Coach Sinclair, though at times he was aware of his name being mentioned.<br />
<br />
Coach Sinclair replied, &quot;Chad? Chad, who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The quarterback Chad?  Have you seen him, Coach?&quot;<br />
<br />
The coach&#39;s eyes glazed over, and he said, &quot;Oh, yeah, Chad was a great quarterback.  He brought us the championship. Wonder whatever became of him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;ll see you later, coach!&quot; Bruno said grabbing Rick&#39;s hand and pulling him toward the exit.  So far it worked, but no reason to test the limits of the forget-about-Chad part of the spell.  Bruno worried that Chad&#39;s family might be harder to make forget.   And when Chad came back, their memories would adjust to fill in the blanks.  If Chad came back, thought Bruno with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why you smiling like you just swallowed a canary?&quot; Rick asked when the got to the parking lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably, the same reason you&#39;re packing wood, Rick,&quot; Bruno replied slyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got a date with Meghan too?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See you Monday, Bruno,&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, about-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gotta date, can&#39;t keep her waiting.  Call me tomorrow.  Preferably, in the afternoon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick climbed in his car and drove off.<br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s moping and inward attention had the effect of making him cling tightly to Rick&#39;s manhood, as a surrogate for his own missing manhood.  Rick got hard as the result.  Bruno noticed, so Rick mentioned his date.  No good would come of letting Bruno know that Chad would hug his wearer&#39;s ball if you removed his drawstring.  Besides he really did have a date with Meghan.  He had made it specifically because he had hoped to be wearing Chad.<br />
<br />
He drove by the library, Meghan was waiting in front chatting with her friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hungry, big boy?&quot; she asked patting his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s work up our appetites before hitting In-N-Out,&quot; Rick said.  He drove past the library, and through the park to Lookout Point.   They sat looking at the city lights below them. <br />
<br />
&quot;In-N-Out, huh?&quot; Meghan snickered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you be the judge,&quot; Rick said sliding his trousers down to his ankles,  he pulled his hard cock out of his Speedo, and let Chad cling to his balls.  He added, &quot;Do I measure up to the quarterback?&quot;<br />
<br />
Meghan seemed lost in thought, quarterback?  Oh, yeah, she remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not the size but how you use it, stud,&quot; Meghan answered.<br />
<br />
Chad became aware of Rick&#39;s thrusting and the taste of salt water.  What the fuck?  Rick was having sex?  Chad missed having sex.  Without his manhood, could he ever have sex again?  Cum and vaginal fluid mixed and dribbled down drenching Chad.  Why the fuck did he have to be so absorbent?<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Rick, Yes, Rick, oh, yes, Rick, you do know how to use it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better than Chad?&quot;<br />
<br />
Huh? thought Chad.  Wait Rick&#39;s screwing Meghan?  But we were sort of- wait better than me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Meghan laughed, &quot;Chad always made a touchdown, but you know how to do the dance better.&quot;<br />
<br />
The made out for almost half an hour, then Rick tucked his limp slimy manhood inside Chad&#39;s pouch, and snapped it shut.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure you wouldn&#39;t like me to clean that up, lover boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, breaking in a new suit.  Think I&#39;ll name it Chad,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chad?&quot; she asked in a confused voice, &quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick smiled.  When they were touching, and Chad was touching her thighs, she remembered who Chad was, but now she had to think about it.  Hm, with any luck, Bruno won&#39;t remember Chad any better come Monday.  Then Rick can keep Chad all to himself.<br />
<br />
He drove to the burger place.  He had two double doubles, and Meghan had a single.  He drove her home, then drove out to the farm.  He tied Chad&#39;s drawstring to his bedpost.  Went to the bathroom, and then climbed into bed wearing only his Speedo.  He seemed to go right to sleep.<br />
<br />
You could at least say &quot;goodnight&quot; thought Chad unhappily.  He was in the dark under the sheet and blanket, and Bruno was sound asleep.  Chad couldn&#39;t see anyway out of his predicament. He would just have to be a good little Speedo and trust that Rick would change him back.  Or maybe someone would remember him?  <br />
<br />
Eventually, Chad fell asleep.  He dreamt of having sex with Karen Sinclair, the only girl he hadn&#39;t banged in the school, but suddenly, Bruno and Rick were there.  They were fucking Karen, and him, and they told him it was his turn to screw Karen, but he couldn&#39;t, he was smooth between his legs.  They laughed and took turns fucking his ass and mouth simultaneously, while Karen watched and laughed.    Suddenly, the cocks inside him swelled, and he gagged. He woke up, he was Rick&#39;s Speedo, and Rick was jerking off his morning wood.  Chad had no idea of the time but guessed it 4 or 5 am.  Rick blew his load and rolled over and gone back to sleep.  Chad wondered whether Rick was even awake.  He certainly hadn&#39;t acknowledged Chad. <br />
<br />
Chad woke in darkness.  He saw flashes of light, and both of Rick&#39;s bare legs.  He was going downhill on a dirt path, and apparently wearing a bathrobe instead of pants.  Chad was afraid he might fall off without a drawstring.  Not that he&#39;d mind tripping up Rick, but he didn&#39;t like the idea of being torn or trampled.  He clung tightly to Rick.<br />
<br />
Rick opened up his robe, and pulled a leather cord out of his pocket. He hung his robe on a branch, and stepped out of his flipflops.  He started to thread the leather thong through Chad&#39;s drawstring opening.  The thong was thicker than Chad&#39;s original cord.  Rick used his thumb and fingers to inch the leather drawstring through the narrow passage.  <br />
<br />
Chad&#39;s eyes were wide open, or would have been if he had them.  It felt like a cock, not exactly like his, a bit more gamy or wild.  He couldn&#39;t find words, but he could sense it becoming part of him.  It took almost 10 minutes, but Rick managed to thread Chad while wearing him.  Then he tied the leather thong tight, and ran toward the pond.  <br />
<br />
There were some cows wandering out of the barn, and Chad suddenly felt aroused.  Splash!  The cold water of the pond squelched Chad&#39;s weird feelings.  The sun was rising, and it must&#39;ve been after 8 or 9 when Rick finished his two and half hour swim.  He draped the robe over him, and peeled Chad off.  He untied the leather string, and carried Chad by the leather strings toward the barn.  I was like he was being dragged around by his cock and balls.  Chad wanted to scream.<br />
<br />
&quot;See Chad, my lucky Speedo was leather.  Made from our championship breeder bull&#39;s hide - specifically, his cock and balls. Anyway, Achilles was our prize stud when I was kid.  And it was wearing that leather Speedo that I got lucky with my first girl.  I couldn&#39;t wear it for swim competitions, but I always restrung my competition suits with my lucky thong. Anyway, I&#39;m going to set you in the straw here.  If you change back, come and get me.&quot;  He set Chad down in the straw in a barn stall and walked back toward the house.  Chad didn&#39;t know what to think.</p>
