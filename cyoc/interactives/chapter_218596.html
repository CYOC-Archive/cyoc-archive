<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In fear that her parents and her sibling may have transformed, or stuck in the city, Brittany&#39;s heart began to pound as she got back on the main road to her house in the suburbs.  You could hear police sirens, horns honking, yelling, screaming, and even an explosion that made you and Brittany slow down and turn around, in the distance, behind you in the city you had escaped.  A fireball flashed as it grew in the air before dying in a massive cloud of ash.  Nervous, Brittany continued to drive home as you kept your eyes on the road.<br />
<br />
Trying to keep her attention on driving and not on her fear, you did your best at assuring her that everything was going to be alright, that there was a chance that her parents hadn&#39;t been transformed, and if they had been caught in the city, that they were smart enough to get to safety.  <br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t know it yet, but you were right about everything except for your assurance to Brittany that her family had not transformed.<br />
<br />
It took longer than expected.  Having to dodge awkwardly parked and abandoned cars, some of which had crashed, that lay around the streets, Brittany needed your eyes to slowly and carefully navigate around them, and to not hit anybody.  People were still running around in the streets, carrying precious belongings or helping each other out in fortifying their homes before purported rioters, untransformed individuals terrified of the transformed, believing that they could cause or spread transformations (reports of delayed transformations and transformed individuals/mutants with transformative abilities - NBM and detachment, slime and clay abilities, swapping powers, transformative bodily fluids, and  so-called &quot;fleshweavers&quot; didn&#39;t help), stormed their neighborhood.  Some of the transformed in the neighborhood, some of whom Brittany recognized and was shocked at their transformations, were helping each other with their new bodies and abilities.<br />
An old couple who bought Girl Scout cookies from Brittany a while back had been fused together and de-aged.  Their curiously conjoined body - split right down the middle, with a left half that was of the wife, and a right half that was of the husband, with two arms on each side, carried an unconscious girl with tentacles that had replaced her limbs and a single, large, closed cyclopian eye (instead of the natural two) on her forehead, with one pair of arms, while the other carried a toolbox.  Though you and Brittany didn&#39;t catch much, the girl was brought inside and the toolbox was set down as two arms picked up hammers while the other two picked up wooden planks.  The couple began to nail them over their windows as many other neighbors, transformed and untransformed did the same.  It looked like the neighborhood would be hunkering down at that house - it made sense, it was the largest.<br />
<br />
Taking note that the fused old couple&#39;s arms were mismatched - the two arms on the wife&#39;s side were that of the husband, and vice versa, you took some quick glances at other &quot;mutants&quot; (the radio&#39;s nickname for the transformed) in the neighborhood.  <br />
<br />
A teenage centaur girl, with the help of an extra female body attached to the rear-end of the horse body, facing backwards, coordinated with each other as they ferried food in baskets they carried and laid on their &quot;horse&#39;s back&quot; to the house.  <br />
<br />
A seemingly untransformed, short man disembarked from a golf cart with a rather muscular and tall woman as they helped carry large jugs of water from a truck into the house.  Their transformations soon became apparent - the petite man, donning light womens&#39; jogging clothing, with feet for hands and a vagina in the place of his nose and mouth, surrounded by beard stubble and who was struggling to lift a water jug, had evidently swapped the attributes of muscle density, height, and a few other aspects with the woman - a huge, muscular amazon wearing men&#39;s gym clothing, carrying two jugs at once.  Noticing she was shoeless, you saw that she indeed had the man&#39;s old hands for her feet.  With her (probably the man&#39;s, originally) gym shorts&#39; fly pulled open, you could see a masculine mouth with beard stubble speaking.  As Brittany mentally noted, the man&#39;s voice was clearly cursing in tandem with his frustrated gesticulations as he dropped the jug he was holding - it luckily didn&#39;t break.  The woman politely shushed him, putting a large hand over his mouth in her crotch, righting the jar, and awkwardly hobbled over the him on her foot-hands and crouched down to hug him warmly as he shed a tear, his facial vagina clenching up.<br />
<br />
A four-armed, six-breasted (2 horizontal rows of F-Cup breasts) visibly pregnant woman who Brittany swore, to your disbelief, was before her next-door neighbor&#39;s gardener, carried multiple small bags and a basket of baby supplies to the designated house - judging by the crying from within it, you could tell that there were multiple babies inside in need of care.  A swift figure glided by and patted the woman on the shoulder to comfort her, causing her worried expression to be replaced with a smile.  <br />
It was Brittany&#39;s transformed neighbor, who was nearly completely in the nude. Originally an antisocial Latino woman, her neighbor had undergone quite a drastic transformation - turning into a Dick-Naga. Below her waist were not legs, but a smooth, muscular tail of human flesh that grew more and more veiny and stiff as it tapered down into the head of an enormous penis, which she shook, unintentionally, like a rattlesnake&#39;s rattle.  No testicles were visible anywhere though.  Her anus had replaced her belly-button.  In addition, her once modest breasts had flattened into pecs that stood proudly on her bare chest.  Her two arms had become more muscular, but, strangely, bent the wrong way, like a praying mantis, and had only 2 thick fingers each.  More normal, non-muscular arms were instead affixed to the sides of her head, shoulders and all, directly to the centers of the heads&#39; sides, one of which she patted the gardener with.  Her ears replaced her nose, where they were structured like that of the nose of a horseshoe bat.  Still with small earrings inside them, you could see that the neighbor had to turn their head in the direction of whoever she was speaking to or whoever was speaking to her to hear them efficiently.  You and Brittany wondered whether she would ever yell anymore, running the risk of ruining her ears, or how it would even be possible for her to wear headphones again.  She also didn&#39;t seem to have any nose - so she likely was only capable of breathing through her mouth.<br />
<br />
In due time, you and Brittany arrived at her home.  The large amount of her transformed neighbors only made her fear that her parents had been transformed worse.<br />
And she was right.</p>
