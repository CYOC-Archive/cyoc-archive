<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">About ten minutes later we descended the staircase with the intent of playing a little game with Karyn’s <br />
sisters.  Karyn told me what she wanted to do and I made a series of carefully worded wishes to make sure that <br />
we could have our fun.  We heard sounds coming from a television, and it sounded like a video game.  As we <br />
took a quick glance around the various rooms, it appeared that Cady and Erin complied with Karyn’s demands.  <br />
Too bad, I thought, for what we were about to do would have been a bit funnier if they had ignored Karyn.<br />
<br />
We entered the living room and found the two younger girls focused on the video game in front of them.  <br />
Apparently they did not notice our presence.  “Ahem!” Karyn loudly cleared her throat.<br />
<br />
Her sisters neither paused the game nor looked back at us.  “What is it?” Cady asked impatiently.  “We did <br />
what you wanted, we didn’t bother you, so can’t you go away?”<br />
<br />
“No,” said Karyn.  “You both need to be taught a lesson.  All you ever do is fight and I’m sick of hearing <br />
about it, seeing it and dealing with it.”<br />
<br />
Cady paused the game.  She turned around to look at Karyn.  “Will you ever learn you’re not the boss around <br />
here?” she challenged.<br />
<br />
“I am right now,” Karyn answered.<br />
<br />
“Big deal,” said Cady.  She turned her attention back to the video game and was about to resume its play.<br />
<br />
“Stupid, ugly, inexperienced slut!” Karyn shouted.<br />
<br />
Faster than I could blink Cady stood up and walked towards us.  I could tell exactly what she intended.  “I <br />
wouldn’t do that if I were you!” I warned Cady.<br />
<br />
“Shut up, you bitch!” Cady said without looking at me.  She marched right at Karyn and slapped her across the <br />
face.  She hit with such force that Karyn recoiled and fell down to one knee.  I was actually surprised.  <br />
Karyn assured me Cady would react this way, but I still doubted her.  Now our plan would unfold.<br />
<br />
It took Karyn a few seconds to recover.  When she did she looked right back at Karyn with a look of pure anger <br />
on her face.  But more than that her eyes now glowed with a green tint.<br />
<br />
“What the…?” Cady exclaimed as she backed up several feet.<br />
<br />
“You…shouldn’t…have…made…me…angry,” Karyn said as she rose to her feet.  <br />
<br />
Cady looked at me in shock.  I just smirked at her and said, “What she said.”<br />
<br />
The change we planned took effect.  Karyn’s skin grew a sickly pale color before turning to bright green.  Her <br />
blonde hair grew longer and fuller and gradually shifted to a midnight black color.  She grew several inches <br />
in height while previously unseen muscles thickened and rippled all over her body.  Even her cock grew in <br />
size.  We wondered by the wording of my wish, which was “I wish Karyn would turn into the She-Hulk when Cady <br />
makes her angry,” if she would retain her cock or not.  I was glad to see that it remained.<br />
<br />
Karyn now towered over everything in the house.  She looked to be about 7 feet tall and probably 300 pounds of <br />
solid muscle.  The menacing look on her face never dissipated as she glared at her sister.  The change reached <br />
its completion and she growled, “Karyn…SMASH!!”<br />
<br />
Karyn lunged at Cady.  Cady moved faster than probably any other time in her life to avoid being tackled to <br />
the ground.  She ran out of the living room in terror.  Karyn picked herself up and saw Erin still sitting on <br />
the living room floor.  Evidently she had been too scared to move during all that transpired.  “You’re…in…<br />
trouble…too!” she growled.<br />
<br />
“No, no, no, Karyn, please, no,” Erin pleaded as she stood up and backed against a wall.  “Cady made me do it, <br />
please don’t hurt me!”  Unfortunately for her well being, Erin backed herself completely against the wall and <br />
had no escape.  Karyn grabbed her by the shoulders and threw her into the kitchen.  Luckily for Erin there was <br />
no wall separating the two rooms along her trajectory.<br />
<br />
I heard a voice scream, “What happened to the stairs?”  It was Cady.  I ran to the staircase and found that it <br />
was now encased in a brick wall.  This was another part of our plan.  We didn’t want either of them to escape.  <br />
<br />
“Uh oh,” I teased Cady.  “Better try to get out of the house.”<br />
<br />
Cady ran to the front door and frantically twisted the doorknob.  However, the door would not budge.  She <br />
pulled at it as hard as she could to no avail.  She looked at me and said, “You did this.  How?  Stop it!”<br />
<br />
Karyn’s hulking figure appeared in the hallway.  “I think you’ve got bigger problems right now,” I warned <br />
Cady.  Cady ducked into the dining room.  Karyn ran after her.  I followed both of them.  In her infinite <br />
wisdom Cady decided to find something to use to defend herself.  There was nothing in the dining room that <br />
really fit the description.  Cady realized this and turned around to see Karyn at the opposite end of the long <br />
table.  Karyn took the table in one hand and effortlessly threw it out of her way.  The table hit the wall <br />
with such force that it broke in a few pieces and left a huge hole in the wall.<br />
<br />
Cady frantically grabbed the only thing that she could, which was a large china serving platter.  Once Karyn <br />
was close enough Cady smashed it over her head.  This had minimal effect as Karyn just shook her head to get <br />
the pieces of glass out of her hair.  Cady simply froze in place.  Karyn grabbed her by the throat and threw <br />
her into a different wall.  <br />
<br />
A minute later Cady slowly emerged from the hole in the wall.  Karyn didn’t allow her any time to compose <br />
herself.  She hoisted Cady up by the throat and cocked her arm back to deliver a crushing blow.  At that <br />
moment Erin ran into the room with a very large knife in her hand.  Uh oh, I thought.  That was something we <br />
overlooked.  There were tears on Erin’s cheeks and her grip on the knife appeared tenuous.  “Please, Karyn,” <br />
she begged.  “Don’t do it.”<br />
<br />
Karyn released Cady, who fell to the floor in a heap.  Karyn just started at Erin, who remained as steady as <br />
she could.  Karyn took a couple of steps toward Erin.  Erin cried as she dropped the knife and fell to her <br />
knees.  Karyn scooped her off the ground and wrapped her arms around Erin in a sincere hug.  While still <br />
grasping Erin’s quivering body Karyn walked over to Cady, picked her up and hugged her as well.  Cady began to <br />
cry as well.  I gently smiled since I knew that this was what Karyn hoped would happen.  “I wish Karyn would <br />
return to normal,” I said.  Within moments Karyn was back to her previous form.<br />
<br />
Once the crying subsided Cady noticed that Karyn was back to normal.  “What is going on?” she asked.</p>
