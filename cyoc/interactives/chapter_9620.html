<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two friends kept looking at one another, at a loss to do anything else, as Don's body continued to expand.  Chris realized that now his eyes were shifted up slightly to meet Don's.  My god, he thought, Don is taller than me.  Then another realization found its way into the jumble of thoughts and emotions he was already feeling: his cock was hard as a rock and straining against the denim of his pants.  The attraction he felt for his friend seemed to be growing right along with him.  Chris' jaw dropped lower and lower as the tightening clothing revealed more of his friend’s body.  The sleeves of the sweatshirt were creeping up his strong forearms, and its neck opening had stretched into an oval, pushed outward by his widening shoulders.  The shirt's hem had been pulled halfway up Don's torso, revealing more of the abs he worked so hard to keep chiseled.<br />
<br />
Don saw none of that.  Instead, he was agog as his reducing surroundings.  The apartment that just minutes before had been cavernous was now closing in around him.  Chris, a friend he’d always looked up to – literally and sometimes figuratively – was now shorter than him.  Don couldn’t quite wrap his mind around the fact that the same hands that had cradled his entire body not half an hour ago were now smaller than his own.  And he realized quite suddenly that he wasn’t afraid, not like he had been when he’d shrunk.  He was worried, yes, because whatever was happening to him was out of his control, but at the same time he couldn’t deny a sense of excitement at being taller...bigger.  Looking straight ahead, he could easily see over Chris’ head.  What would that make him?  6’ 7”?  6’ 8”?  Almost a foot taller than his normal height.  He felt a thrill at that realization.<br />
<br />
“Fuck...dude, you’re...you’re...” Chris’ voice trailed off and he craned his head back to keep up with Don’s rising eye level.  Don looked down at Chris and saw the rapt look on his friend’s face.  He thought he detected something more there than awe.  There was a kind of hunger in Chris’ eyes.  Don’s gaze dropped lower and he saw the bulge his friend was sporting.  God, is he...?<br />
<br />
Further speculation was cut short as Don winced in pain.  His jeans had been getting tighter by the moment, but he’d only been dimly aware of it.  Now the constricting seams of the denim burned along his legs and crotch.  Suddenly frantic, Don pushed the jeans down off his waist...or tried to.  He could barely get a fingernail under the edge of the material let alone hook his thumbs into it.  He bent over, digging harder in an attempt to get them off and heard a loud rip as he did.  His jeans split right down the center of his ass, frayed stitching splaying to either side of the tear.  “Well, these are a lost cause.  I *have* to get out of them,” he said to Chris, who was speechless at the prospect of the sites he’d be treated to if Don’s growth continued.<br />
<br />
No longer caring about the damage to his clothing, Don sat on the kitchen floor, grabbed a flap of the torn material and pulled.  The tear in the seam expanded as Don exerted force and soon a long strip of material was hanging loosely to the side of his right leg.  He repeated the process on the other side, then grabbed the unzippered flaps of the jeans’ fly and pulled those down simultaneously.  With the pressure already off the tortured material, the remaining tatters slid down easily.  He squeezed his expanding feet through the cuffs of the pants and finally had them completely off.  Don breathed a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
A moment later, another tear ripped into the hush of the room as the sweatshirt began to succumb to his growing body.  Not bothering to try sliding it off, Don simply grabbed its front collar and pulled downward and outward.  Already weakened from being stretched beyond its limits, the shirt material easily parted between his hands.  Don whipped the remains over his head and onto the floor.  Now, clad only in boxer shorts that were filling beyond capacity, the freshman stood up.<br />
<br />
And bumped his head on the apartment’s ceiling.  He’d been on the floor only a short time, less than a minute, he guessed, and it looked as if he’d grown another foot.  He could feel that his underwear was about to rip off of him.  The waistband had been pulled down his pelvis, exposing the tops of his pubes, and it was squeezing his hips painfully.  The shorts were stretched and bunched up around his crotch, leaving his growing anatomy beneath clearly outlined, a fact that wasn’t lost on Chris who stared openly at his friend’s nearly naked body.<br />
<br />
Don wasn’t thrilled at the prospect of running around in the buff yet again.  He was proud of the body that he worked so diligently to maintain, but he wasn’t an exhibitionist either.  He’d hated being shrunk, but at least his nudity had been hard to see just by virtue of his small size.  But now to be so big and exposed...  What could he cover up with if he got much larger?  “Ohhh...dammit!” he yelled as his underwear finally gave in and split completely down the sides.  The tattered material fluttered to the ground, landing next to his expanding feet.  For a moment, Chris drank in the site of Don’s naked, nearly 9-foot-tall body as his friend bent under the enclosing ceiling, a look of embarrassment on his large, beautiful face.  Then there was a double slap of flesh on flesh as Don quickly covered his cock and balls with first one hand and then the other, grabbing his semi-erection in the process.</p>
