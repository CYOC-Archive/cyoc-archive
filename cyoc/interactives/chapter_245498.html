<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This chapter is a bit unusual as it&#39;s actually set in the future, more precisely near the end of summer vacation. It technically counts as a backtracking chapter as it&#39;s mostly look back on what has already happened by that time, which is the present.<br/>
<br/>
Also, after this chapter, we will be returning to our regular schedule. And apologies for the terrible pun in the title.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eris was in a rather frustrated mood right now, though there was some good news and bad news. The good news was that she had passed the final exam of summer school which means she could attend WSA as a freshman. The bad news was that she had spent the whole summer with this studying and she only had about a week to enjoy some freedom before she started school. And there may be things like her transcript that may get in the way of that.<br />
<br />
It was particularly frustrating for Eris because this was her first summer as an Animalian. And she was double-dosed, so she had the body of an adult woman, even if she was also a grizzly bear. Eris was hoping she&#39;d have time to show off her new form for the boys that she was developing an interest in. Unfortunately, her parents were firmly putting their feet down. She was grounded for the summer and she wouldn&#39;t be focusing on anything other than studying so she can be admitted to WSA at a high school level. Eris was still very used to getting her way and would have thought that her adult bear body would allow her to override what her parents said, until they found a way to back their words up.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Eris waited impatiently for her parents to return. They had been quite explicit in saying she couldn&#39;t leave the house. They also took the tablet and changed the passwords for the computer so she had nothing to watch. They were still treating her like a child. Perhaps she had been a child not that long ago, but she was clearly an adult now. The more she thought about it, the more ridiculous it seemed that they could keep bossing around, especially as she was a grizzly bear now. Well, that wasn’t going to stay like that. Once they were back, she was going to throw her considerably bigger weight around.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Eris heard the sound of footsteps approaching the front door. She didn’t pay attention to how much heavier they sounded to be. She squared her shoulders and prepared to confront her parents. As soon as the door was open, Eris said, “Ok I’ve waited long enough for you to get back. There’s gonna be some changes around here…”<br />
<br />
Eris trailed off when she saw who came through the door. It was a pair of bear Animalians. They were brown bears like her, but they were at least a head taller than her, with an impressive amount of muscles stacked on their bodies. The male bear looked down at Eris and said with her father’s voice, “You’re absolutely right, Eris. There are going to be some changes around here.”<br />
<br />
“Dad? Mom?” asked Eris in surprise, looking between them. Earlier, she felt rather smug about being bigger than her mom in every positive way. Now not only was her mother taller and built with more muscles, it looked like her breasts were also larger than hers.<br />
<br />
“Who else were you expecting?” asked the female bear that was clearly her mother. Eris noticed that neither of them sounded as old as they did before.<br />
<br />
“Why are you bears?” asked Eris.<br />
<br />
“It’s simple; you weren’t going to listen to us otherwise,” said her mother, “We allow you too much free rein before and that didn’t work out well. So why would we expect you to listen to us now that you’ve become a bear?”<br />
<br />
“But how are you bigger than me?” asked Eris.<br />
<br />
“It’s because we’re not just grizzlies, we’re Kodiak bears,” said her father.<br />
<br />
“Is that a different kind of bear?” asked Eris.<br />
<br />
“It’s a subspecies of brown bear,” said her father, “One that’s significantly bigger than the common grizzly bear.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;d thought we might need a bit more of an edge in maintaining authority with you,&quot; said her mother, &quot;It&#39;s like you said, there are going to be changes around here, <i>young lady</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
There were quite a few changes at the Bernstein house. For one thing, there had to be a significant wardrobe and furniture update for their new bodies. And Eris&#39;s parents were a lot stricter with her now. She was effectively grounded for the whole summer, going through a home-school cram session so she&#39;d be ready for the final exam to determine whether she attends WSA as a high-schooler or not. And there was no sneaking out under her parents&#39; watchful eyes, who took shifts in making sure she didn&#39;t leave the house.<br />
<br />
So Eris&#39;s first summer as an Animalian wasn&#39;t nearly as fun as it should have been. The worst part was dealing with a new source of frustration. Since she was a legal adult now, her mother gave her The Talk. Though Eris already had some instinctive knowledge about sex as she experienced through her conversion, her mother was able to fill her in on the details. And it was really frustrating to have this new libido and having limited means of relieving it. It didn&#39;t help that her parents&#39; sex lives have renewed with their double-dosing. There were a few times at night where she could hear them grunting and groaning and her sharper bear nose was able to pick up the scent of each other on their bodies sometimes in the morning.<br />
<br />
But at least she&#39;ll not be treated like a child as WSA. There ought to be plenty of guys there who would be willing to help her scratch the itch she had all summer. There was one particular boy that she might be interested in. There was Ted from Animalia Ambassadoria, though he mostly went by Teddy. Which was rather appropriate since he converted into a grizzly bear Animalian during the IAC. Unlike Eris, Teddy only got a single dose. Still, Eris thought he was pretty cute, though ironically a bit young for her. Well, she could change that easily enough when she&#39;ll meet him at WSA. Of course, the self-absorbed Eris hadn&#39;t considered that Teddy may already have a girlfriend who would definitely not like a newcomer trying to make a move on him.</p>
