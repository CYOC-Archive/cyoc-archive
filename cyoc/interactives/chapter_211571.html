<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She pressed down firmly on the screen and immediately let her robe fall to the ground.<br />
<br />
In an instant she could feel her body react. A tingling sensation coursed all over her, as if her whole body was numbing to whatever thing was occurring.<br />
<br />
Slowly, Kelly watched as her perspective on the world changed. Her entire body, shrinking in size. Her height lowering and her shoulders narrowing as she took on a more petite shape. Moving her hands, she felt her fingers shorten and thin, becoming the small delicate hands of any other woman. Her nails, hardening and growing outwards, taking on a healthy shine. Looking down, she could see her feet respond in kind, shortening and narrowing, making her dysphoria riddled days of shopping for shoes that were never in her size a thing of the past.<br />
<br />
Moving her hands against her own arms, she could feel the changes begin to expand from her core. She could feel in real time as a thin layer of fat grew in all around her body, softening her skin and making her more sensitive to every touch.<br />
<br />
At the same time, she could feel as the changes migrated to her face. While she couldn&#39;t see them, she felt it as her hair continued to grow. Where it had ended below her shoulder blades before, she could see the golden brown tresses thicken and grow, reaching down beyond her chest. At the same time, she contorted the muscles in her face as she felt her much hated browbone recede, her jaw soften, and her nose shape change into the delicate button of her dreams. She could feel as the fat continued to expand in her cheeks, and her lips grow into their fully formed pout.<br />
<br />
Feeling the changes migrate, the mass of her neck eroded away, and the tingling burrowed deep into it. Giggling slightly at the feeling, she was met by the raised octave she&#39;d always heard in her mind. The sound of any other woman.<br />
<br />
Before she could celebrate however, her attention was drawn further down her body, as the changes moved towards her stomach. Looking down, she noted the added layer of fat had accumulated visibly in her stomach, giving her the adorable stomach of any normal woman. Yet she watched in disbelief as the sides of her stomach seemed to melt away, moving downwards and pooling in her thighs and butt. <br />
Expanding their already large size. At the same time, she could feel the changes pooling inside her hips, and anticipating what was to come, braced herself as her pelvis expanded outwards, expanding slowly and rotating forwards until her new waist was contrasted with the full hips of her dreams. Running her hands up and down her new shape, Kelly noted the rough feeling of cellulite on the back of her thighs, a welcome problem that every woman contends with.<br />
<br />
Despite her new fuller frame, the feelings continued to sit in the bottom of her stomach, warning her of what was to come. Steeling herself for the moments to come, Kelly watched as her penis began to pull slowly towards her groin. Although unable to see them, she could feel her testicles expand in size, her sperm coming together to form the eggs in what were becoming her ovaries. As they burrowed into her, she could feel her ovaries migrate into her stomach and separate, settling into their proper place deep inside of her. As they did, the cavity they created remained open, her scrotum splitting in two and connecting under her penis as they formed her labia. Finally, her clitoris rescinded completely into place on top of her labia, settling into its proper folds inside of her newly formed genitals. While she could no longer see herself, quickly running her hand in the area confirmed her newly formed vagina.<br />
<br />
Finally, Kelly felt as the changes focused on her chest. Looking down at herself, she marveled as her areola expanded, darkening and becoming even more obvious against her skin. As they did, her nipples expanded outwards, growing into an easily visible size, even under a shirt. Bringing her hands up to investigate, Kelly felt a small lump behind her nipples. As she watched, the lumps seemed to expand in size, growing soft and sensitive, before another lump grew beneath them again. Again and again this cycle repeated, and she watched with glee as her breasts grew in waves, folding over themselves and filling out her chest. Further they pushed until they filled out her chest, leaving her with the proud breasts of a woman.<br />
<br />
Stepping back, Kelly Surveyed her surroundings, giving herself a moment before walking towards the full length mirror in her bedroom, and taking note of the new sensations of her body as she moved. Closing her eyes before reaching the mirror, Kelly centered herself, preparing herself for the shock to come. Slowly, she opened her eyes.<br />
<br />
Kelly stared back at herself. The soft new face, the full hair covering the top of her full breasts, her soft curves sloping out from her waist, she watched in awe as she moved her new shape in twists and turns, marveling at every angle of her new form. This was the form she&#39;d always wanted, the one she was meant for. The real question she thought, was what to do now.</p>
