<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Rescinded the first note. Now we see the length of time the experiment has been going on. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, time to leave this room and get moving then,&quot; Sam stood up and stretched, walking towards the grey cast door and opened it, walking outside. &quot;Come on, pretty sure they&#39;re gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s get going.&quot; Alex leaped up easily followed by Jessie and yourself. All of them exited the door into the small room with three doors, where one lead to the hallway they had entered and another a door they had entirely ignored.<br />
<br />
&quot;From what I heard from the footsteps, someone left through this door,&quot; Alex pointed his claws to the door that they had ignored, and sliding it to the door that they had entered with. &quot;To here, so there might be some of them nearby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t use that door again then.&quot; Jessie went forward and grasped the doorknob to the other door and took a deep breath, watching Alex and Sam for strength.<br />
<br />
She pried the door open as slowly as she could, and peered in. It didn&#39;t last a second as Jessie gave up. &quot;It&#39;s too dark... Damn it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me.&quot; Alex volunteered, prying the door open just to let his eyes gaze in and stared. Of course, being in an airtight space, no air current moved in or out of the room they were in. However, the moment that Alex peeked in, his nose twitched.<br />
<br />
&quot;I smell... people...&quot; Alex sniffed deeper, poking his head in after scanning the massive room. &quot;I don&#39;t see any other latex animals here so we&#39;re clear, but I smell humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Sam followed Alex through the now open door, finding themselves in a store room easily four times bigger than the room they were previously hiding in. There were multiple storage boxes neatly stacked onto each other, obscuring their sight to some parts of the room although not stacked too high to obstruct total sight.<br />
<br />
You walked forwards and tasted the air, finding yourself assaulted by stale human sweat. You gag and retch, feeling sick. Jessie looked at you with an odd gaze.<br />
<br />
You hiss back in displeasure and motioned your claws to your nose and made fanning motions. She nodded in understanding. &quot;Ooh, it&#39;s stinky in here.&quot; She chuckled a bit.<br />
<br />
You hiss back playfully, walking to check the other side of the boxes as Alex and Sam went the other way. There were no lights installed on the ceiling, therefore the place was far too dark.<br />
<br />
But, as if called, your scales began to <i>shine</i>.<br />
<br />
&quot;W..what the fuck?&quot; Jessie flinched back as Sam and Alex quickly ran towards you, the glare of a light far too shocking to ignore. You yourself was freaking out, finding your entire body literally shining like a lamp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! You didn&#39;t tell me you could glow!&quot; Alex excitedly whispered, eyes wide in amazement. &quot;That&#39;s so cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
You hiss in confusion and slight fear. &quot;<i>I didn&#39;t know I even could!</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s kinda handy...&quot; Jessie walked around you after her initial shock, examining your now glowing form. &quot;Odd that it just <i>did</i> it out of necessity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no need to look a gift horse in its mouth,&quot; Sam gave you a pat and moved on. &quot;Let&#39;s just count our blessings and go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignoring your glowing body, you finally reach around the boxes. Of course, there were no humans in sight. However, piles of clothing does exist and it <i>reeks</i>.<br />
<br />
&quot;Clothing!&quot; Alex immediately jumped for a t-shirt, taking it up and examining it. &quot;Damn, it&#39;s too small.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh! Fashion time!&quot; Jessie rummaged through the pile, picking out clothing at a whim, not even caring that it reeked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh uh, Jessie don&#39;t you dare play dress up with me!&quot; Alex shrieked as Jessie ran towards him with a t-shirt that was <i>way</i> too overdecorated.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is she doing?&quot; Sam crossed her arms, amused. Alex leaped away from Jessie, before running around her. &quot;She&#39;s like a wanna-be fashion designer!&quot;<br />
<br />
You give a smile at the rather cute interaction, before you reach down and grab a pair of men&#39;s jeans. You stare at them solemnly, knowing full well that you can&#39;t wear these with your massive feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, time to shop for clothes then.&quot; Sam bent down and rummaged the clothes, picking up certain clothing sets and jackets that could fit her.<br />
<br />
You look to the side, finding Alex on the floor struggling playfully as Jessie tried to force a too small shirt over him.<br />
<br />
Finally relenting, Alex, the gentle giant, laid down defeated. Jessie gave a whoop of joy, and threw the shirt away. &quot;It won&#39;t fit anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex stood up confused, but nonetheless relieved. &quot;Doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re off the hook though.&quot; She beckoned all three of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys won&#39;t even be able to fit these clothing, so I&#39;ll help you out.&quot; She rummaged a pile nearby, pulling out a silver hoodie that was big enough for a man. &quot;Martin, this is for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She threw the hoodie in your direction and you caught it, looking at its design. It&#39;s a silver hoodie alright, more like a runner&#39;s hoodie that athletic men usually wear during cold night runs. It had a twin line running from one arm, over the hoodie itself and back to the other arm and the line on the further side diverting to the back of the head, creating a rather interesting pattern on the back before returning and aligning itself again to reach the other arm.<br />
<br />
You nod at its design, before bringing it up and sliding it over your now much more muscular frame. It slid down easily, your arms exiting the sleeves and stretching it slightly. The hood over your head, you give a toothy grin towards Jessie. <br />
<br />
A whistle sounded from Alex, him being impressed by your look. &quot;You looking like a king cobra, Martin.&quot; <br />
<br />
You kinda blush, the sides of your glowing cheek turning just a shade brighter.<br />
<br />
You also look towards Alex, now sporting a rather a stretched white t-shirt, probably a size too small for his frame. His muscles sculpted the shirt. It could be called that he wasn&#39;t even wearing anything!<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure there&#39;s no other size for me?&quot; Alex questioningly looked at Jessie. &quot;I&#39;m sure there are bigger sizes despite your amazingly talented eyes to spot good textiles.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jessie blushed, caught or simply embarrassed. She chuckled lightly. &quot;O..of course. There&#39;s no other sizes here for you Alex.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alex saw the flush of pink on her cheeks and the surge of hormones, but he simply grinned, knowing full well. &quot;Suit yourself.&quot; <br />
<br />
You look to Sam next, now sporting a zip up jacket that she had recently picked out. It was maroon in color, contrasting her natural purple and rather looking like blood. It had a black dragon design on the back, a Chinese dragon coiling and returning back into itself. An ouroboros. Not a good choice for  their situation. Martin also noticed something else. It wasn&#39;t zipped up.<br />
<br />
You hiss questioningly at her and she looked at you, and you motioned a zip up gesture and shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;My breasts?&quot; She turned and chuckled at your dumbstruck face. &quot;I don&#39;t want to soil my new apparel, it compliments me nicely.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stare at her, but she just shrugged. You turn towards Jessie only to find a boxer briefs covering your face, shocking you. Quickly pulling it off, you stare at her.<br />
<br />
Only to see her blushing as she tried to help Alex bring a gym shorts up his built thighs, her trying to not let it get stuck and not wanting Alex to tear it up with his claws.<br />
<br />
You shrug, before bringing it down to your legs. Your massive feet easily slipped through the boxer briefs, a good choice by Jessie, before sliding up your legs to your crotch.<br />
<br />
Only to get stuck on your tail... &quot;<i>Of course.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
You stretch behind you and stare at the boxer briefs, before an idea popped up into your head. Bringing your claws to the back of the briefs, you tear up a hole right where your butt was supposed to rest.<br />
<br />
Of course, your tail was too long to do so yourself. You look pleadingly at Sam, who had worn a simple grey skirt and following her recent reasoning, probably not wanting her juices to soil her pants either.<br />
<br />
She sighs, walking over to you and grasping your long serpentine tail. She walked behind you, pulling the boxer briefs down to your knees shocking you at the sensation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Martin, you didn&#39;t tell me you had a bubble butt.&quot; She grinned as you look down, the blush brightening. She continued to shortly glance at your butt, you wishing for her to just complete it.<br />
<br />
She brought your tail into the hole you made, letting your tail slide in and widen the tear itself before she slid it up your crotch. Your dicks were a massive bulge on your crotch, add to the flimsy and rather bland black boxers you now wear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Done!&quot; Sam waltzed to your front, admiring your new look. She whistled, somehow, and nodded at your appeal. &quot;Hope this would get ourselves comfortable again.<br />
<br />
You stare at Alex, now fully clothed in a rather themed set. If he were to be imagined as a human with his current build and apparel, he would be described as a muscular and hot successful bodybuilder. Your dicks twitched and turned into chubs, but you cover it with your tails.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, guys... We probably have some trouble...&quot; Jessie called out from behind some boxes. &quot;Totally some trouble!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Alex came to her, worried. He found her holding a few sets of attire, these completely unrecognizable and rather out of trend...<br />
<br />
&quot;These... are like, nearly a fashion trend almost five years ago...&quot; She looked pale, unable to believe her own knowledge about these. &quot;How... how long had this thing been going... and how many people had been changed!&quot;<br />
<br />
You and all your friends look towards the floor, but you don&#39;t see just some clothes.<br />
<br />
You see humans, from teenagers to adults, lying on the floor, their corpses agonized and partially latexified.<br />
<br />
As if to make it worse, your glow dies off.</p>
