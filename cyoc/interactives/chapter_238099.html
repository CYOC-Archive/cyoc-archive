<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff begun to sweat as an one minute was too little time to explain everything. Instead of doing that he quickly changed some values and forced chronivac to make Jennifer belief that she was his boyfriend. Jeff had no time to change other values. The moment he pressed enter in the keyboard and turned to face Jennifer she was already running towards him until she hold her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, what did you do to me...? I feel so sick... My head...&quot; Jennifer winced as a throbbing headache send small shocks into her whole body. &quot;My mind is... it&#39;s... aaghh... Jeff...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer fell to the floor as her memories were reconstructed. The memories of her meeting Jeff in the same class begun change. Instead they met somewhere else. He was senior while she was two years younger than him. Her mother saw nothing wrong with their love life as she recalled talking to her mother. Jeff begun to grow older in her memories. He was now a high school graduate. Jennifer was worried why would he approach her when she was still in her sophomore year. Slowly from there they begun to date as it was still okay for a college sophomore to date with high school sophomore as they only had four year gap.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, what&#39;s going on?&quot; Jennifer coughed in the floor as she saw that Jeff felt more calmer on his computer chair.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s brain chemistry and memories were also getting modified as he remembered talking with Jennifer as he was nearly graduating from the college. Instead of pursuing business life he decided to dedicate his life to get married with Jennifer. He knew in his tiny little heart that it was wrong but he was desperate as women of his age didn&#39;t like him. The age cap get getting wider as Jeff remembered meeting Jennifer at age 25. Jeff tried to hide their relationship from the world but somehow it was Jennifer who initiated the whole thing.<br />
<br />
As Jennifer hold her head. She swore that some of her core memories begun to change drastically as he met Jeff. Jennifer was into older men and wanted to date a guy who was over a decade older than her. She had done a lot of nefarious activity online and made dating profiles telling that she was older. Jeff was one of them. Jennifer thought that he was the perfect person for her as he had the famous &#39;dad bod&#39; as some of her friends called it. <br />
<br />
Jennifer had formed a small secretive club at her school. In which she and her friends drew fictive art and written stories where they lived lives with their older boyfriends. Them being old men compared to their girlfriends at their twentieth birthday. All of her high school friends spent their lives at the library or near a laptop. All of their lives revolved around this singular thing or a thought. One of her friends got called a &#39;gooner&#39;, whatever that meant, and she was referred as the girl who was terminally online all the time. To her, this was normal.<br />
<br />
Things started to escalate quickly as Jennifer remembered meeting 28-year-old loner Jeff who lived inside his mother&#39;s basement. They had met in an anonymous chat. Jennifer had told him how she really wanted to meet him not telling why for obvious reasons. Jeff wasn&#39;t a heavy internet user as he mostly spent his days browsing safer sites. Compared to her Jennifer&#39;s internet knowledge sometimes scared Jeff. Jennifer found the thought of dating a loser, like Jeff, very appealing and she was very open about it. Jennifer felt no shame at displaying her interests online which made Jeff more terrified. To her it was normal to watch videos of online influencers living in very unclean houses, post long rants on forums of their life choices and adored how some of them even made millions despite living and looking like that. She sometime bragged to Jeff how she was banned in some of their chats by her unhinged questions and behavior. <br />
<br />
&quot;No! That&#39;s, that&#39;s wrong...&quot; Jennifer winced on the floor as the memories were almost modified to reflect the reality. &quot;I would- I wouldn&#39;t do that. I&#39;m a normal high schooler. I couldn&#39;t ever date a guy like-&quot;<br />
<br />
The headache suddenly stopped. Both Jeff&#39;s and Jennifer&#39;s memories now modified to reflect their current situation from their previous lives. It was as if Jennifer wasn&#39;t deleted in first place but had lived two years like this. Jennifer raised her head slowly and looked at her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeffy, did you do something just now...?&quot; Jennifer asked as she sat back on the small bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Did you?&quot; Jeff fired back as he didn&#39;t feel any shame at staring at his naked girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Both of them feeling that something had just happened but they struggled to notice what it was.</p>
