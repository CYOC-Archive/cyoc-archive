<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
John silently cursed the old lady as he walked down the dark country road towards his home.  He cursed himself for driving so recklessly.  He cursed his roommate for drinking all their milk. He cursed his friends for demanding that he make that special dip that required the milk before the Big Game, the Big Game that he was now missing.  And he cursed his luck for having this accident the one time he forgot to charge his cellphone or fill his gas tank. <br />
<br />
But mostly he cursed the old lady.  That mark on his ass really hurt.  It didn&#39;t help that it felt like his ass was swelling, making the mark press more firmly against his jeans as he walked.  With each step his ass felt bigger, putting more pressure on the sensitive mark.  He wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if it was infected or something.<br />
<br />
Lucky for him pain in other parts of his body distracted him.  His feet were killing him. They felt incredibly stiff and his shoes felt too tight.  He would have  taken them off but he didn&#39;t want to walk barefoot on the gravel.  His heels felt particularly stiff and he found it surprisingly more comfortable to walk on the balls his feet, almost on his tip toes.  <br />
<br />
He probably would have wondered more about this odd way of walking were it not for the other pains.  His belly felt bloated, protruding a little and pulling on his shirt. He knew he had let himself go a little bit, but he didn&#39;t think he was that fat.  He was a little worried that the infection in his buttocks was spreading to the rest of his body.  Everything seemed to ache.  His head hurt, particularly his scalp.  He winced as he felt two large bumps on the top of his scalp.  He reasoned they must have been bruises, but for the life of him he couldn&#39;t remember when he had bumped his head.  His fingers felt stiff and numb, especially at the tips.  It was hard to tell in the dark but his nails looked darker almost black, like they had been bleeding under the nail.  He began to worry if the accident had been more serious than he thought.  Maybe he had internal bleeding or something.<br />
<br />
But worst of all had to be the itching.  Every inch of his body seemed to itch and no amount of scratching seemed to relive the sensation.  In fact it almost made it worse, as the itching only increased as he continued to walk and scratch.  He felt a light fuzz on his swollen belly and decided he probably needed to do some waxing.  He thought it was a little gay and he didn&#39;t consider himself particularly hairy so he had never tried it before.  But his roommate swore by it, saying the ladies loved his smooth skin.  And if he was as hairy as he felt in the dark then he really needed a shave. <br />
<br />
But he would worry about that later.  All that mattered now was getting home.<br />
<br />
So John trudged along the dark road, trying to ignore the continuing and seemingly increasing aches and pains occurring across his body.  He pacified himself with the promise that it would all be okay as soon as he got home, just a little bit further ahead.  He told himself to just focus on the road ahead, putting one foot in front of the other and tried to block everything else out.  But when he finally tripped he could no longer ignore the changes in his body.<br />
<br />
John cursed as he rolled on the ground.  He had stumbled and tripped over his feet for some reason.  As he lay on the ground he could ignore the pain in his feet no longer.  They were so swollen that the seams of his shoes were coming apart at the soles.  With a grunt he pulled his shoes off and was shocked into silence at the sight of his transformed feet.<br />
<br />
Not only were they swollen, but they looked longer and thinner.  The ankle was bent at an unnatural ankle, explaining why he was walking on his toes.  And those toes. They were a sight to behold.  They looked swollen and thick, ending in a hard dark black nail.  Worse the flesh of the swollen toes overlapped, making it looked like they were merging, forming just two large toes.<br />
<br />
As he rubbed his feet he was astonished to see that his fingers looked the same.  He had been ignoring them as he walked but now he could see that they were swollen, too, and appeared to be convalescing into just two large digits and a thumb.  He tries to pulled them apart but the flesh refused to yield.  Instead, the effort seemed to spur their growth.  The fine hairs covering his hands and feet grew thicker, forming a nice fur coat of black and white spotted fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;What .... what is happening to me?&quot; said John with fear.<br />
<br />
He rolled on his hands and knees, trying to steady himself enough to stand on his strange new feet when he was rocked by a strong pain in his back.  He moaned and grunted as the pressure increased until a small bulb formed at the base of his spine.  He couldn&#39;t see it, only feel it as he reached back and pulled on the developing tail.  He could feel the thin appendage growing longer and hairier, with a small tuft of fur blooming at the tip.  When it was long enough he pulled the tip in front his bloated belly and recognized it for what it was - a cow&#39;s tail!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, oh no, oh no, &quot; jabbered John nonsensically as he struggled to pull down his pants.  It was difficult.  His discovery seemed to spur the transformation of his body and the pants were now much more tightly constricted against his body.  Already the legs of his pants were ripping down the seam line by his enlarging thick thigh muscles - muscles covered by black and white spotted fur.  With a snap the top of his pants came apart, pushed wide by his expanding hips.  He was disappointed but not shocked to see a large pink sac with four thin nubs forming just bellow his bloated belly.  With rising trepidation he lifted his developing udder and confirmed his worst fear - his slowly shrinking penis was disappearing into the same slit that had already claimed his testicles. In vain he tried to reach around his growing udder and grab a hold of his penis, with the misguided belief that if he could just hold onto it maybe it wouldn&#39;t go away.  But his udder just proved too large a hindrance and it slipped from his grasp, lost forever into his new vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Noooooooooo!&quot; John moaned, as his mouth extended into a muzzle, two small horns pushed out from his scalp and his ears grew larger and rounder on the top of his head.  The moan gradually became a mournful moo in the quiet lonely night.</p>
