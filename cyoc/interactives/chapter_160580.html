<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sleep finally took Henry into a tangled realm of things remembered as real, and other things that made little sense. He wearied by his physical transforming and the unusual sexual frolicking he did to himself; he previously a man in his fifties, and married. <br />
<br />
Henry dreamed as the bible says, &quot;Young men see visions and old men dream dreams.&quot; Henry dreamt of his returning home, of him waiting outside his bungalow house for the wife to come out and she to being then as on his turf. He expected his wife of thirty-one years to take a look at such as he was then, and scream, running back into the house, slam the door shut, lock the door and call the police.<br />
<br />
He dreamt on about after the police caught him and of the TV news people videoing his animal self, a naked creature from the deep woods.<br />
<br />
The not so distant sound of a train operating its way through town, blowing four blasts of the diesel horn for every railroad grade crossing the train met; the sound awoke Henry from his sad dream.<br />
<br />
Henry sat up quickly, the morning dew had covered his naked and/or the furry parts off him; he felt dirty, smelled vile, had the taste of his own semen still on his tongue. It was early still, the time he had no idea but usual bustle of cars going to work had not filled the air with a din of tire noise. He staggered to rise to standing on a pair of cloven hoofs and furry legs. Henry had to grab at the branches of the Honeysuckle bushes to help lift him from off the cold ground. <br />
<br />
As he gained his strange stance, he brushed aside the branches of his thicket, and peered at a changed world. Henry felt terribly vulnerable, if anyone were to see what he had become and recognized his face, he would like then to die. Using some stealth he moved toward town where his house was situated, remembering well the worn tan colored vinyl siding he had three students work to reside his house, done cheap.<br />
<br />
Henry made a panicked dash across Salis Road, a five lane wide main street through the town. As after he had crossed that road, the rest of the streets he would meet were simple two lane roads. Dashing on nimble legs and those cloven hoofs of which he was beginning to appreciate their virtual traction effort for treading across soft earth.<br />
<br />
As he dashed from one hiding place to the next his years of teaching mathematics to his students had him doing an accounting of his chance at getting home as unseen. He stopped, and tried to catch his breath when while crouched behind a row of rose bushes, his exercise of running caught up with his bladder for a dire need to urinate. He looked down, as in his crouched stance, his goaty sheath pointed his penis to shoot urine all up onto his chest.<br />
<br />
The longer he waited and thought about how to urinate and not get soaked in his own stench, his penis began to rise from its furry sheath. &quot;As if I stand then upright and let my penis hang in an arched angle, my urine should follow the same arched pattern!&quot; Henry allowed his penis to stand erect, but not rock hard stiff. He let go the flow and thought all was well until he heard a woman scream.<br />
<br />
His bladder worked as efficiently as did his big goat buck balls surge squirts of his ejaculated semen. His body temperature being that like a buck goat caused his urine to show steam in the early morning cooler temperatures. As hadd the neighbor lady looked out from her rear door of her house to see a fat stream of yellow urine streaming from behind a large tree trunk.<br />
<br />
Henry let his urine stream slow to a dwindle while waiting to hear the lady slam shut her door to her house. He listened, and felt then nervous from not hearing what he expected to hear. He waited, as waited longer, and then he heard a woman&#39;s soft voice from very close, as from behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the devil are you?&quot; Said a soft voice, a controlled voice, the voice Henry seemed to know. As Henry turned to then face what he feared, he looked at and stiffened his spine, standing with the more sexual a pose of a satyr displaying his male wares.<br />
<br />
&quot;Betty, Betty Frost, I wish our meeting was different than it is this morning.&quot; Henry said as he recognized the cute waitress from the Tolley Car Diner, where he often went to eat his weekday lunch.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are, and how do you know me, as I would know if I ever met the likes... the likes... the... the...&quot; Betty speaking as her eyes met those of Henry and her mind drained of all ambitions except of one, pleasure!<br />
<br />
Betty reached out her right hand to take hold of Henry&#39;s, as she led him to her house, she single, but as Henry recalled, she wore tight fitting clothes and had marvelous tits. As she drug him toward her house, Henry felt his satyr sense of male lust rising inside his chest and groin. Betty was of one mindset and that of having a morning of extreme sexual pleasures with what she knew to  be a satyr; something that in her thoughts she knew was impossible, but if he were real, she wanted the first of his best.<br />
<br />
Henry followed Betty with a satyr style of feeling willing. As they entered the small one bedroom house, it was the bedroom they went to visit. As they entered the bedroom, Betty slipped out of her bathrobe, and stood then before Henry, giving him a view of her he until then could only imagine or dream of ever seeing.<br />
<br />
In as during the three hours of nearly continued sexual pleasures by both a horny young woman and a heated greek style Satyr, their heavy breathing fogged over the bedroom windows.<br />
<br />
Nearing the noon hour when Betty was to report to work, their lovemaking ceased and she offered her short satyr to take a shower with her. The warmed water felt good to Henry, and he soaped and washed his furry legs, and masculine bear chest; while standing before Betty a tall, long legged beauty. Henry was by then more a satyr than he was the previous night. As from where he stood, his view was of Betty from her waistline and down. He nestled his bearded face close to her and using his long goat like tongue, he helped vacate, clean from her vagina the drips and long strings of what kept seeping out while they stood in her shower.<br />
<br />
Betty stepped out from her showering stall and flopped onto her bed where Henry continued eating what for a satyr is his favorite style of breakfast. Somewhere along during his eating, Betty fainted, and Henry, his timing as to then being perfect, he decided to leave the house and continue of toward seeing his dear wife.</p>
