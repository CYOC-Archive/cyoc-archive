<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The “sunlight” was fading as the glowing orb on top of the pyramid in the center of Atlantis began to darken. It was hard for Stacy to consider it sunlight, but it was what they had and what they may have for the rest of their lives. She floated in front of the window of the small house/apartment which the New Atlantis council had given them. Homes was one of the things which they had in good supply, the city had once housed around a million merfolk, now it held just over a 100 merfolk. The arrival of herself, her girlfriend and friends had gotten them to 103 merfolk. <br />
<br />
The apartment, or maybe it was a closer to a house was much larger than the house the four of them had shared just off the university grounds and it was only her and Barbara. Barbara’s little sister Lindsay had been given her own but smaller place which was attached to this one by a small covered walkway or swim way. Across the road was a matching house with a smaller house attached. <br />
<br />
“Well, this is nice isn’t it.” said Barbara as she swam up behind Stacy and wrapped her arms around her pulling her backwards. <br />
<br />
“Don’t get fully use to this, they said these are the homes they save for new arrivals to help them adjust. In time we will have to find a place of our own, including paying for rent and the rest.” Added Stacy, it made sense, the homes had direct links to the large for the lack of a better term bunkers which had been built so that merfolk could hide in when the machines came over.<br />
<br />
They had been told that happened at least once a week and as long as they remained quiet and out of sight the ancient Atlantean machines would pass them by. The merfolk council had guards at all times but most of all at night a good distance away from the community. When one of the 19 machines came close an alarm filled the community telling everyone to go hide. The guards where far enough away so that the alarm sound would not bring the machines right to them. <br />
<br />
“I know…” said Barbara as she rested her head on Stacy’s neck feeling the water being exhaled by the gills on Stacy’s neck. She then titled her head and kissed her girlfriend’s neck, the gills made it harder but it also made the neck far more sensitive than it had when it was a human. Stacy let out a moan as she fell back deeper in Barbara’s embraced, flicking her black and purple tail back into Barbara’s embraced who in turn wrapped her yellow and gold tail around her girlfriend’s tail. <br />
<br />
“I see what someone has in mind tonight.” said Stacy with a playful grin as Barbara’s hand moved up to Stacy’s top. <br />
<br />
“Of course, I want to fuck the most beautiful mermaid I have ever seen.” said Barbara <br />
<br />
“I can say the same thing about you.” Said Stacy “I am just happy they are ok, with same sex relationships, that would be troublesome.” <br />
<br />
“They aren’t fully accepting.” Countered Barbara, as she remembered bringing up same sex relationships with the council. The way they had explained it was that while they accepted it, they were pushing for children to help repopulate Atlantis once they finished clearing out the machines which they had been working toward since the 1st new merfolk arrived in Atlantis. The council was not doing force breeding but those with kids got a lot of aid and society pushed for kids being child free was going to be hard. To make it harder, they did not have the technology for chemical birth control and condoms where not practical considering penises where internal until sex actually happened. So birth control of any kind was out. <br />
<br />
Both of them had talked about kids, both wanted them, but they had planned to do adoption or sperm doner, here adoption happened either when a kid was transformed alone which happened or when a kid lost their parents and sperm donation for lesbian couple happened in a three way not in a lab. <br />
<br />
“Well, we will worry about kids later.” Said Stacy who must have been thinking along the same line. <br />
<br />
“Well if we want kids, maybe we can talk James and Elizabeth into a four way.” Laughed Barbara as Stacy laughed loader then even her girlfriend.<br />
<br />
“Those two are so straight lace that they wouldn’t know what to do in a four way.” Laughed Stacy “And Elizabeth would be offended by the idea. But enough of that.”<br />
<br />
And that was enough of that, as Stacy spun around as best as she could and kissed her girlfriend before giving a kick which brought both back toward the bed, both their tops being sent flying to drift their way down to the stone floor of the house.<br />
<br />
In a nearby building Elizabeth let out a load moan of pleasure as James finished within her, the two of them floated over the bed both slowly rotating as they did. <br />
<br />
“That was amazing.” Moaned Elizabeth as she placed her head on James’s bare chest. “Even better then when we were humans.”<br />
<br />
“Ya.” confirmed James breathlessly, on the outside both of the put forward the classic straight lace proper couple that one found in high end country clubs but in truth both of them had a sex drive that was hard to beat and where very kinky. “I do kind of miss having legs, limits some of our favorite positions.”<br />
<br />
“Ya…” confirmed Elizabeth, however on some level she did not mind it. Maybe it was part of being a merperson but sex just felt better then human. James also felt bigger in her but she wasn’t going to say that, she wasn’t going to make him feel bad about his human member. “But floating makes things interesting.”<br />
<br />
“True…” confirmed James as they floated over the bed, he held her close not only with his arms but the side fins. Along a merperson’s tail where four small side fins, two just below hip level and two more about calf muscle area. They helped them swim but during sex they launched onto their partner pulling them even closer. <br />
<br />
“I still want to go home but if we have to stay here, maybe it will not be so bad.” Stated Elizabeth as she kissed James bare chest before play biting on his nipple. “The sex is worth it, more so with you<br />
<br />
 “Well, I have an idea of what we can do now.” said James as he pulled away leaving Elizabeth floating in the water and herself feeling more then a little empty without James within in. She did not have to wait long as James spun around and began to orally pleasure her while she did the same with his member. <br />
<br />
They may look like the straight lace couple but they where far from that.</p>
