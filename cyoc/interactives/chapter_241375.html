<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I hear they just opened a new open-air restaurant at the top of this building. I know it&#39;s a lot to ask, but all the humans asked of us to do is to put on underwear, so I think I can deal with it for a brief moment while we gorge ourselves! It&#39;s still early, and it sounded like a bar, so there probably isn&#39;t much clientele anyways at present.&quot; I smirked at my father, knowing that briefs wouldn&#39;t help the poor suckers escape from our shit-stained scent. We smelled heavenly, but humans generally couldn&#39;t seem to stand the raw power of our scent.<br />
<br />
Luther chimed in. &quot;Sounds good to me! I wonder if the elevator can even take us all up at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he commented about that, we all pulled our extremely tight briefs up our absolutely massive thighs. I didn&#39;t even remember if they had originally been white, because they had been so discolored from my fur, stink, and cum. I grabbed the flashlight, sensing it might be useful as we ventured out beyond our safe, anthroslob centered place of residence.<br />
<br />
When we got in the elevator, it creaked heavily, not enjoying the feeling of three fatass slobby lions trying to ride in it. Pushing my father&#39;s fat out of the way, I noticed that the weight limit was only 1500 pounds. Unsure of it would work, I shined the light on the elevator&#39;s button panel. Lo and behold, after I checked again, it could suddenly tolerate 8000 pounds of weight.<br />
<br />
The elevator slowly climbed to the top floor, and opened directly into the restaurant. There was no host, just a sign saying we could seat ourselves before 8 pm. Given that they had apparently opened only moments earlier, I immediately took the opportunity to take a deep inhale from my father&#39;s pits. As lions, we should revel in the glory of our Pride, and I was going to make sure I fulfilled that every day.<br />
<br />
We wobbled and waddled over to a corner booth, barely fitting in, pushing the table out from the corner as we made our way around. We could see the bartender across the roof of the building, and when he noticed us, his nose instantly scrunched. He threw his towel over his shoulder, and walked into a back area. Moments later, a dour-looking, skinny fellow came out as the bartender returned to his place. It seemed like he had been briefing our waiter on how to interact with us in some form. I didn&#39;t exactly understand why, we&#39;re a normal part of society, and as he continued his approach, he clearly got even tighter, even as he pulled out his notepad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; He was clearly taken aback by how good our combined stink cloud smelled. &quot;What... what would you all like to drink? I... presume you&#39;ll be wanting appetizers?&quot; The second question was said while almost eye-fucking my father&#39;s belly. Did he want it?<br />
<br />
Luther was quick to speak up, &quot;I&#39;ll just take a regular coke.&quot; My father and I loved the burps they give us, so we asked for the same. Then, my father ordered one of every appetizer on the menu. &quot;They&#39;re empty right now, and just starting out right? I&#39;d love to see this place turn into a gathering place for our kind.&quot; His tail was somehow escaping from the expanse of his blubberous glutes, and it highlighted the arousal we were all clearly feeling at the thought of decimating some food in public in a human institution, even if there was no one else present.<br />
<br />
A while passed, before the bartender helped the waiter carry all the appetizers to our table. They both seemed sort of weak... maybe they&#39;d be stronger if I shined this nifty light on them. But before I had the opportunity to contemplate this further, my father pushed an entire plate of blooming onions in front of me, and said &quot;Eat up kid, all for you.&quot; He then reached his paw under my massive belly, and started masturbating me. The waiter clearly knew what was happening, and was perturbed, but he finished distributing our food, and almost ran away from us. I reached over, pulling both Luther and my father closer, and began giving both of them handjobs as I attacked my onion with just my mouth. I could feel the mess I was making with the sauce and grease on my whiskers, and it just strengthened my arousal, before a sharp, biting tone ran through the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot; The waiter was back, and he had crossed his arms in an attempt to be stern. I just laughed, knowing that no human could hope to be as strong as one of us. &quot;We let you visit our establishments as long as you comply with our requests, and you STILL need to jack each other off in public? Can&#39;t you last for an hour without blowing a load that sticks your fatass gut to your legs until you just have strands of nasty hair connecting between your legs and your enormous stomach?&quot; I had enough of this disparagement. I began reaching for the flashlight, and as he finally began to say &quot;Leave-&quot;<br />
<br />
I illuminated him in the beam. He even didn&#39;t get to finish the word. Quickly, his face grew numerous whiskers, before four extra chins piled on. In the next moment, while the bartender seemed to just be cleaning the bar peacefully, unaware at what was happening to his coworker, his face morphed into that of a lion like us. He instantly got ten times more attractive, and only got hotter when his belly grew at such a rapid pace it completely destroyed his shirt, and his belly hit our table with enough force to shake the few forks remaining. This finally made the bartender look up, but he quickly looked back down. Could he see what was happening??<br />
<br />
As the wave of transformation continued downwards, his hands morphed into the paws that he&#39;d find himself having a hard time getting off his new stubby cock, and his thighs became suitably massive to support his now 600+lb frame. His pants and underwear were equally ripped to shreds,  as his coat took on a luscious color, his mane grew out, and ducking beneath the table, I saw his feet turn into some absolutely massive paws. I would have to get a whiff of those later.<br />
<br />
I cautiously turned the light off, and once it did, his eyes flashed open, his pupils newly feline. &quot;I&#39;m so glad to see that the first customers on my first shift at this new restaurant are other lions, man! Humans can get so weird about us, it&#39;s nice to see...&quot; PFFFFFFRRTTTTTTT. The man let out an enormous fart, and the bartender now seemed to treat our gorgeous waiter with the same disdain he was treating us with. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, bros, can I have some of your apps? I&#39;m starving!&quot; After snacking on a few enormous onion rings, which seemed distinctly bigger than they had been moments earlier, you heard a trickling sound, before the ripe scent of lion urine hit your nostrils. Your erection instantly returned to full mast, and since your physiology made it easier for you to urinate while hard, you let out a massive belch as you began pissing all over the gut of your hot new waiter. This quickly leads to Luther and your father joining in, and as you finally finish the appetizers, you unleash a wave of cum which you can see staining your waiter&#39;s fur. You&#39;ve claimed him for your pride.<br />
<br />
&quot;They want us to shit in the bathroom but that just... that&#39;s not my, that&#39;s not our vibe! I&#39;m going to take a stand.&quot; As your new pridemate&#39;s face contorted in... a strange, blissful agony, you began smelling hints of his shit, and began chanting him onwards. The bartender only finally noticed when you heard the log drop out of him, and he seemed to want to run over to your table, likely to fire your waiter and kick all of you out.</p>
