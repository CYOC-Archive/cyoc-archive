<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria waited at their apartment door with her roommate Heather. Gloria had picked out a tight red dress that came up above mid-thigh, showing off her massive quads and hamstrings. Meanwhile Heather was wearing a light blue dress that had small frills along her chest. The blonde Heather stood slightly above Gloria at 5&#39;8&quot; but was not the bodybuilder type like Gloria. Gloria smiled as the door opened to find Ray greeting them. &quot;Hiii Rayyy. can I get a hug?&quot; Gloria said sweetly as she crouched down in her heels. Ray who had been hiding behind the door came out and hugged Gloria while avoiding eye contact with Heather. The small guy was wearing a pink dress of his own that hung below his knees. Gloria&#39;s hand scooped under his butt and held him as she stood up.<br />
<br />
The girl&#39;s heels clicked as they let themselves in. They could faintly smell burnt food even though the windows were cracked. The table was set with a couple pizza boxes and some glasses of wine. Bruce sighed as he came out of the bathroom. &quot;Oh! Here already? Welcome, welcome!&quot; He said quickly coming over and giving the two girls hugs. &quot;Sorry dinner plans changed slightly, but glad to have you.&quot; Bruce said sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bruce...Ray... This is my roommate Heather.&quot; Gloria said as Heather gently shook Ray&#39;s small hand. It was hard to miss Ray staring at both of their chests. Heather gently nudged her finger under his chin making him look up into her eyes. Ray blushed and turned away staying quiet in Gloria&#39;s arms.<br />
<br />
Eventually they all took their place at the table. Except it seemed Bruce only had three chairs so Ray was left to sit on Gloria&#39;s lap. &quot;Is this size ok?&quot; Gloria asked as she cut up Ray&#39;s slice of pizza for him before feeding him a few bites. Gloria and Bruce had mainly been discussing work. Ray between bites had been looking over at Heather&#39;s chest which had started to irritate her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Little guy. They&#39;re in the same spot you saw them two seconds ago.&quot; Heather finally snapped at him.<br />
<br />
Gloria looking a bit shocked at Heather replied. &quot;Sorry about that. She gets a little irritated since she always wearing Barbie clothes. People tend to stare a bit.&quot; She said to the boys. Heather quickly dwindling down to doll size and sitting on the table giving up trying to eat the oversized slice. Heather&#39;s dress having shifted into a cheetah print dress that hugged her curves tightly. Gloria&#39;s giant hand reached over and handed her to Ray. His eyes lighting up as he held the much smaller woman. Heather&#39;s chest jiggled as she struggled against the grip of the much larger guy. She quickly stopped as she heard a loud clicking sound. Gloria&#39;s chin loomed above as she warned the small girl. Heather huffed and crossed her arms as Ray&#39;s fingers began to feel around her body. Heather letting out little squeaks in protest to no avail.<br />
<br />
After finishing dinner Ray sat on the couch playing with Heather while Gloria helped Bruce clean up. &quot;Thank you for... everything. I don&#39;t have many nights like these with him.&quot; Bruce said as he watched Gloria dry the last few dishes. She had asserted herself at the sink since he had provided dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright. I completely understand. I know what it&#39;s like living with Heather so... Plus, being 9ft tall I feel like it&#39;s the right thing to do.&quot; Gloria said as she started to grow. Turning around she looked down at Bruce&#39;s muscular frame and smirked. &quot;You&#39;re a good brother, don&#39;t be so hard on yourself.&quot; She said taking a step forward. Her chest now rubbing against his hair. Gloria lifted Bruce by the armpits and sat him on the counter. Tilting her head, she leaned down to kiss Bruce. Bruce being caught off guard, but managed to play it cool. His fingers starting to run through her long straight black hair.<br />
<br />
Heather on the other side of the room had been struggling to keep Ray from exploring every facet of her body. Her little dress had already come off and Ray was now holding her upside down and toying with her butt cheeks. Ray&#39;s mind was racing as he had the chance finally to play with someone smaller than him. His large tongue coming out to lick between her crack, making heather squeal. She quickly clasped her hands over her mouth hoping Gloria wouldn&#39;t see this. Heather had been trying to fight him off, but she was starting to enjoy his advances. As his tongue prodded her ass she began to rub her hand against her clit. Ray finally turned Heather right side up again and toyed with her bare chest. His thumbnail toyed against her nipples. Heather looking over Ray&#39;s shoulder managed to catch what was going on despite the larger Ray being in her way. &quot;Get a room you two!&quot; Her little voice yelled across the apartment. <br />
<br />
Gloria gently pressed her forehead into Bruce&#39;s as she giggled. Her hands had already slipped underneath Bruce&#39;s waistband and was caressing his balls in her hand. &quot;Would you like to show me the way to the bedroom?&quot; Gloria asked biting her lower lip.</p>
