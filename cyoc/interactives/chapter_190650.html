<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim and Kim entered the maze shortly after Daniel and Hunter did. Kim was still in her dad’s back and both of them seemed to be having a blast. The hallway started off slanted slightly to the left and curved to the right as it went deeper. Soon the only light that lit the path was the dim over head lights. <br />
<br />
While Jim was enjoying his time with his eleven-year-old daughter, at forty-eight he knew his back going to be a bit sore tomorrow from carrying her for as long as he was. But he knew that this was probably the last time he would be able to do so, so he was going to hold out as long as he could. <br />
<br />
After five minutes of walking and talking, Jim was starting to feel the burn of carrying Kim for so long. “Hey, sweetie,” he started, “I am going to set you down ok? Dad needs a bit of a rest.” Jim came to a stop as Kim reluctantly agreed. He knelt on one knee and let Kim slide off. He stood up and looked at his twelve-year-old daughter, now dressed in a plain t-shirt and jeans, she had grown nearly ten inches in the last year. While she did enjoy her time with her dad, she was acting more and more independent from him and her mom.  <br />
After another five minutes of walking the two came a dead end with two doors. One door had a symbol that looked like and atom and the other had what looked like a computer. Jim walked over to one of the doors and tried to open it. It didn’t budge. Kim went over to the other door and tried to open it, it did not budge as well.<br />
Jim, having backed up a little saw something on the walls that looked like two different people holding the door handles. “Kim,” he started as he walked back to the door he had started at. ” let’s try the doors at the same time.” Kim looked confused but held on to her door handle. When Jim gripped his there was an audible click from both doors. When he let go, the click sounded again. Kim then tried her door, locked. <br />
“Hold it again dad.” Kim said. Jim held the handle again. ’Click.’ This time Kim’s door slid open as did Jim’s.  Before he could say anything, Kim walked through her door, and it shut with a snap. Jim rushed over to the door. “Kim are you ok?!” he asked frantically trying to open the door. “I’m ok dad,” came her reply. “There is a sign that says the path meets up further up ahead.” Her voice sounded older to Jim, but he brushed it off as the door changing the sound of it. “Ok,” said Jim, crestfallen, after one more tug at the door. “I will see you in a little bit.” <br />
Jim walked back over to his door. It was still open, and it was dark inside. He walked through the open door, determined to get to the end of this branch to meet up with Kim on the other side. There was a snap as the door with the symbol that looked like a computer closed behind him.<br />
<br />
Kim turned away from the door after she heard her the door her dad walked through close with a click. What was he so worried about? She wasn’t twelve anymore, she was thirteen, old enough to watch after herself on a family trip. She started to walk down the hall. A knowledge of and an insatiable interest in math and physics started to fill her head, though it was a small amount at the moment. Kim was now growing quickly now, growing nearly a foot to 5’5. <br />
Kim gained another four years, making her the oldest of Jim and Karen’s children. Her hips and ass stopped growing giving her step a pleasant sway with each step. Her breasts had stopped growing shortly after they had started leaving her with an A cup bust. Her small breasts didn’t bother her as much as they did her mom. Kim rolled her eyes at the thought of her mom. Karren didn’t like the fact the Kim had gotten a scholarship for physics and had accepted it without telling her parents. God forbid she come out as lesbian to her mom. Then she would be without a home until she got to college. <br />
Kim had also continued growing as she walked. She had hit her full height of 6’1. She also hoped that college girls liked their potential girlfriends tall. Kim shook her head, why was she thinking about getting a college age girlfriend, she had one, Shirin. <br />
Shirin was two years older than the twenty-one-year-old Kim, but she and Kim had meat through Kim’s sister when they were all in high school. Shirin had come out to both Kim and her sister, and Kim had soon asked her out in secret. Kim smiled at the memories of her and Shirin finally being able to date openly when she got into college.<br />
Another five minutes go by, and Kim was thinking about the trip. She was here with family, her sister and her twin brothers… she didn’t have and other siblings other than her sister. She had come with her sister and her friends Maria and Isabella. <br />
Kim absent mindedly walked around a corner and let out a small yell of surprise. It was a mirror and she had jumped at her own refection. Kim’s refection looked back at her. She was wearing black boots that ended right under her knee and gave her an extra two inches in height, but they were comfy so fuck it.  Her low-rise black jeans had holes in the knees, her favorite pair. She had on a loose white The Ramones t-shirt. Her blond hair was cut short with streaks of blue highlights it.<br />
Kim continued, thinking about the upcoming school year. She was twenty-two and had been accepted in to a physics doctorate program. Her thinking was interrupted when she looked down the hallway. She saw the back of the person calling her. Kim smiled a mischievous smile as she snuck up behind the person and pounced on them wrapping her arms around their waist.<br />
<br />
Jim was worried about Kim being alone. He knew she was fifteen and could take care of herself, but what’s a dad to do? Well, that’s what he told himself to take his mind of the small hallway. It was only an inch or two taller than his 6’2 frame and dark enough so he could only really see the outline of his feet. <br />
Jim moved forward quickly using the light he saw at the end of the tunnel as a guide. As he moved the hallway got shorter and shorter, though Jim didn’t seem to notice because it was still about an inch or two above his head. When the hallway evened out again Jim was only 5’6, a full six inches shorter than he was. Jim picked up the pace, he wanted to return to Kim and get out of the cramped hallway as quickly as he could. With each step he felt more and more energy return to him, unbeknownst to him he was regressing in age. He was soon twenty-three and on longer Kim’s father, but a neighbor. A new education filled Jim’s head along with new memories. <br />
Jim had just finished a degree in computer science and was visiting home when Kim and her sister had invited him on the trip. Jim had always felt more comfortable with Kim’s sister growing up, that’s why they had become friends. When he had grown his hair out Kim’s sister helped him keep it looking nice. Jim smiled and the happy memories as he brushed a few strands of shoulder length hair out of his face. <br />
Jim looked nothing like the 6’2 man who had entered maze. He was now 5’6 with long hair a feminine face. His features were also looking more and more Persian. <br />
Jim thought back to meeting the girl across the street and how they have become fast friends. Though it was hard to hang out with each other because of how protective of him his parents were. They quickly warmed up to the neighbor though, mostly because they live across the street from one another. His parents also didn’t trust any boys he try make friends with. When he asked them why they had told him that they didn’t want any boys taking advantage of their only daughter. <br />
This thought cause Shirin to slow down for a second. She was frustrated by that thought. For all her parents said about protecting her, they also held very little interest in her life after her tenth birthday. She cut ties with them shortly after she had left home for college, and they didn’t really seem to notice all that much. She was grateful for her friend and her family across the street because they had helped when she needed it.<br />
Shirin’s breasts grew to D cups as memories of her getting her first bra with her friend and her family surfaced. She paused only for a second to adjust her bra through her sundress before moving on. <br />
Shirin was becoming more stressed as time went on because the hallway appeared to be getting closer and closer to her making her claustrophobia kick in. She thought more about her surrogate family more. She remembered telling her friend and her sister Kim that she was lesbian and them accepting her. Shirin smiled; the thought of Kim made her stomach flutter pleasantly. Her hips and ass grew into an hourglass shape as she remembered her and Kim’s first kiss. The punk girl had stolen her heart and she was happy.<br />
Shirin’s thoughts where interrupted as she entered an open room. She let out a sigh of relief now that she was out of the narrow hallway. Her relief was short however, because someone wrapped their arms around her waist and said boo. Shirin yelped breaking out if the weak grip and running across the room. When she turned around, she saw Kim laughing at her reaction. <br />
“You asshole!” Shirin said when she caught her breath. Kim was recovering from her laughing fit,” You make it too easy sometimes,” she said when her breath had returned. “No,” Shirin replied,” you are just getting too good at it.” Kim beamed puffing her chest out, showing Shirin her nipple piercings and the fact she was not wearing a bra. Kim sauntered over to Shirin and wrapped her arms around her girlfriend in a loving embrace. Shirin smiled looking up at her girlfriend. She stood on her toes and pulled Kim into a kiss showing Kim she was forgiven. The two locked hands and continued down the hallway, quickly finding the exit from the maze. The two walked out the door excited to find something to do on the boardwalk.<br />
