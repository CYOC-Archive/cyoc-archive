<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kari sighed in annoyance as she packed, listening to her mothers and uncle argue. Despite being 22 years old, the kitsune woman felt her mothers were far too protective.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t give a shit about a civil war,&quot; Claudia Harris yelled from downstairs. &quot;My kids aren&#39;t going PERIOD!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a decision that they need to make for themselves,&quot; Fukushu countered. &quot;They are adults by human standards, and their people need them.&quot;<br />
<br />
This argument was a constant throughout Kari&#39;s life. Born to the celestial kitsune Tatsu and Shizen, Kari was adopted by Mika and Claudia Harris when she was an infant. A spell was cast on the young woman by the demon queen Lilith years ago, making her mortal. As a result, she was adopted by Mika and Claudia becoming the oldest of four siblings. Despite learning of her adoption in her youth, Kari felt no ill will towards the kitsune lords or her own mothers. The spell prevented Kari from remaining in the kitsune realm. Throughout her life, she felt fortunate to have two sets of parents looking out for her. Still, it didn&#39;t mean things were always peaceful.<br />
<br />
That was the case now as the nine tailed kitsune Fukushu arrived in her home. Although technically her older brother, Kari viewed the fearsome warrior as an uncle. Fukushu throughout her life was a stoic and intimidating presence. She had heard the legends surrounding him, the fear he struck in all his foes (save her human mothers). Death Fox, Angel of Vengeance, Dark Samauri, these were the nicknames whispered when talking of Fukushu. For Kari though, those names meant little, Fukushu was just family.<br />
<br />
Making her way downstairs, Kari could see her mother Claudia angrily pointing at Fukushu. Claudia was always weary of the kitsune, based on a rocky early history. Pretty, petite, and hot tempered, Claudia was the mother Kari hated to anger. The blonde woman was a pint sized mama bear, always protective of her children, yet always firm when it came to discipline. Growing up, it was Claudia who handed out discipline or came to her daughters defense.<br />
<br />
Now Kari could see Claudia jamming her finger into Fukushu&#39;s chest. Although Fukushu stood almost a foot taller, the blonde woman was not intimidated by his presence.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m their mother and I&#39;m telling you that my kids will not be cannon fodder in some war,&quot; she yelled. &quot;You remember what happened the last time my kids got caught up in war don&#39;t you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari watched Fukushu nod, his vulpine features furrowing in annoyance. The war her mother talked of occurred 17 years ago when Kari was barely five years old. That war was brought to the Harris home, leaving Kari&#39;s grandmother, Claudia&#39;s mother, dead. Although Kari had been present, she had a hard time remembering what happened. She remembered screaming, crying, loud scary noises, and her mother being devastated. Over time, she had talked with Haley and Aaron about it to see what they remembered. Haley&#39;s memories were similar to hers yet Aaron was quiet about what happened. Kari assumed that Aaron&#39;s silence was because he had seen the fighting. The boy had snuck away during the battle, witnessing their mothers attack. No matter how much she prodded her brother, Aaron refused to go into full details.<br />
<br />
&quot;Claudia relax,&quot; Mika exclaimed. &quot;Screaming at Fukushu isn&#39;t going to solve anything!&quot; Claudia scoffed, folding her arms across her chest as Kari&#39;s mom Mika stood before Fukushu. &quot;Now tell me why my children are needed so badly?&quot;<br />
<br />
Calm and reasonable was the best description that be could used to describe her mom Mika. While a human wizard like Claudia, Mika was also part kitsune. When Kari was an infant both Mika and Claudia fused with their doppelgangers from a second timeline. In that timeline, Mika was a kitsune, the youngest daughter of the celestials Tatsu and Shizen. This technically made Mika a member of the royal kitsune family, with her children being royalty as well.<br />
<br />
Although royalty, Mika made sure to not spoil her children. Kari and her siblings were raised to be humble, respectful, polite, and caring. Mika was the one to comfort her children after a bad dream or break-up. She was the one that would cool Claudia&#39;s temper and keep her level. Mika was the emotional rock of the family, the member that kept the entire family unit together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now please explain why you need Kari and the others?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ours is not the only clan within our realm,&quot; Fukushu stated. &quot;In the north resides a powerful clan known as the Shimizu. Recently a vixen has come to power, she claims to be a celestial and has rallied several clans to her side. They are looking to replace my parents and rule in their stead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay that doesn&#39;t sound good,&quot; Mika replied. &quot;But it sounds like something the army can handle. Also, that can&#39;t be true, there&#39;s only four celestials.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu furrowed his brow, unsure of how Mika and Claudia would react to what he had to say. &quot;The vixen that claims to be a celestial is of the Asaya Clan. Do you remember Hinata?&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia&#39;s face went pale, recalling the four tailed assassin. Seventeen years ago the vixen attacked her home, claiming the life of her mother as well as Mika. If not for the interventions of Life, Claudia would have become a widow.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Claudia said firmly. &quot;No, the kids aren&#39;t going! You&#39;re not using my kids to take on a murderous psychopath!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Claudia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t Claudia me Mika,&quot; she yelled, her eyes welling with tears. &quot;That kitsune nearly destroyed this family. I won&#39;t....no I CAN&#39;T let her take anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand your concern,&quot; Fukushu said softly. &quot;However, your children are crucial to our defense. You have trained them in magic as I have trained them in warfare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah and I&#39;m still not thrilled you did that.&quot; Claudia grumbled. Fukushu raised an eyebrow, casting Claudia a curious look.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have never understood your distrust of me Claudia Harris.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You almost broke my back the first time we met you furry dick,&quot; Claudia yelled. &quot;That&#39;s reason enough.&quot; Mika sighed, stepping in between the pair as she placed a hand on Claudia&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Claudia,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Fukushu has done nothing but act graciously since then. He&#39;s always looked out for the kids when he didn&#39;t have too. Let me talk with him...please.&quot; Claudia sighed, nodding as Mika turned to Fukushu.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like the idea of my children getting involved in kitsune affairs,&quot; she said. &quot;Even if they are heirs to the royal empire. I worry about their safety...just as much if not more than Claudia, especially if Hinata is involved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I would do everything in my power to ensure their safety,&quot; Fukushu replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Mika sighed. &quot;And as much as I want to say no....they&#39;re grown. I can ask them not to go, but they&#39;re adults. This has to be their decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kari balked, surprised by her moms statement, but appreciative that she would let her make her own decision. Stepping forward, she began to shift her form. The woman&#39;s body covered in black fur, her face elongating taking on a vulpine appearance as her ears shifted to the top of her head. As three fox tails emerged from behind her, she gave Fukushu a determined look.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am ready to defend our people.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Fukushu was about to respond the sound of the front door closing drew their attention. Curiously they stared, watching as the youngest child of Mika and Claudia, Mason Harris, came home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey moms!&quot; he called. Entering the living room, the 16 year-old blonde teen paused. &quot;Uncle Fukushu what are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going to war Mace,&quot; Haley exclaimed happily. &quot;Isn&#39;t that cool?&#39; Mason paused, giving his older sister and odd look. Haley was always a bit odd, a being of chaos as his oldest sister Kari jokingly referred. Still, Mason did have an affinity for Haley. From her brightly colored braids to her spunky, joking, attitude, she was the sibling Mason felt closest too. It also helped that Haley was the one who would defend him from bullies.<br />
<br />
Mason recalled an incident in 7th grade when a group of kids tried to beat him up. When Haley saw this she immediately ran to his defense, telling the bigger boys to back off. The boys at the time were 8th graders, and a bit taller than Haley even if she was five years older than Mason. The boys laughed, looking at the skinny half Asian woman and asking what she was going to do about it.<br />
<br />
What the boys didn&#39;t know was that Haley was a kintaro, more specifically a kintaro that could assume the form of a massive anthropomorphic jade tiger. Transforming into her Amazonian tigress form, Haley proceeded to grab each of the boys and hang them by their underwear from a tree. Sure, Haley got in trouble with her parents, but no one ever picked on him again.<br />
<br />
&quot;War?!&quot; Mason asked in alarm. &quot;Where? Why?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh some d-bag is bugging Unc and grandma and grandpa,&quot; Haley scoffed. &quot;So they need me to go beat their ass real quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haley...&quot; Mika sighed, casting her daughter an annoyed look.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing right?&quot; she shrugged. Mika and Claudia simply rubbed their eyes, Haley&#39;s insane self confidence always concerning them. Mason though was shocked, looking between both his sisters. The stoic and serious Kari and the quirky, confident Haley. He couldn&#39;t let them go alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll join you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Mika and Claudia exclaimed. &quot;No!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Moms,&quot; Mason pleaded. &quot;Please! I can&#39;t let Kari and Haley go alone! I have just as much reason to defend the kitsune as they do. They&#39;re my family too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika and Claudia turned to one another, a look of great concern carved into their faces. Mason was a sweet kid, but the fact of the matter was he had no magic. At 16 he was still rather skinny as well, running track and cross country in high school. Mason was also quite cute for a teenage boy with his wild blonde hair and dark brown eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason,&quot; Mika said slowly. &quot;I..I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a great idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mason your mother is right,&quot; Claudia added. &quot;It&#39;s too dangerous. Kari, Haley, Aaron...they...they have..experience dealing with these kinds of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean magic,&quot; Mason scowled. &quot;That&#39;s so unfair! Why don&#39;t you let me help? I&#39;m just as capable as they are! And not for nothing, both of you were doing things crazier than any of us when you were my age.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Mika and Claudia looked to respond, Fukushu raised an furry hand to quiet them. &quot;The boy is right,&quot; he said. &quot;And he appears quite capable. Perhaps it is time he visits the capital to learn of his heritage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry moms,&quot; Haley added. &quot;We&#39;ll make sure Mace doesn&#39;t leave the capital. I&#39;ll even give him the 10 cent tour. C&#39;mon please, Mason is always stuck home when we go out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika and Claudia glanced at one another, realizing they were losing this argument. If they forbid Mason, chances were the boy would sneak away with Haley&#39;s help. At least if he went willingly he could be safe within the capital. Turning to Fukushu, Mika and Claudia furrowed their brow.<br />
<br />
&quot;You better keep him safe Fukushu,&quot; they grumbled. &quot;Or I&#39;ll turn you into a rug.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fukushu smirked, nodding before glancing at the Harris children. &quot;It is settled then,&quot; he stated. &quot;Tomorrow we leave for the kitsune capital.&quot;</p>
