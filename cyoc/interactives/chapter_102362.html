<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Where you two headed?&quot; the lamb Baby Fur asked to Sammy and Jessy as they stood on the step to the bus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ultimately My-yam-me to see the First Fur,&quot; Sammy answered, his mind pondering over what Amy the Armadillo had said about the First Fur and all that.<br />
<br />
There was a lot that he didn&#39;t know and wanted to know, as it was a hope that things could be better for everyone, friend and not-friends alike. Since he hugged Jessy and let her turn him into the fox Baby Fur that he was now, he really didn&#39;t mind on how Baby Furs lived and operated. It may be a parody of their old lives, but he&#39;d actually found everything to be fun so far in that regard. Getting rid of that wasn&#39;t what he wanted. If anything, he wanted it so that humans and Baby Furs could be friends and humans could get the conscious decision to become Baby Furs just as he had after his talks with Jessy.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we&#39;re not above having some fun on the way,&quot; Sammy finished.<br />
<br />
The lamb Baby Fur nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any suggestions?&quot; Jessy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s Sea World in Or-Lan-Do,&quot; the lamb Baby Fur answered, &quot;wanna go there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure!&quot; Sammy and Jessy chorused at the thought of a fun place to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alrighty then,&quot; the lamb Baby Fur smiled, &quot;go on and have a seat. We&#39;ll get there as quickly as we can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy and Jessy nodded and moved to climb into a set of seats that were near the front. They also began to chat with some of the other Baby Furs already on the bus while the lamb Baby Fur began to make the pretend noises of a bus driving and they were soon on their way. It all amounted to fun, as many of them also said they were going to Sea World. One said they were going to Cape Carnival because the next morning would be the first space shuttle launched by Baby Furs was to take place. Sammy chuckled and made a joke about diapering the man in the moon. That lead to a fit of giggles from all who heard it, which lead to everyone giggling and having a good time.<br />
<br />
By about three PM after watching several towns that looked like they&#39;d been designed for children&#39;s play-sets that mirrored the way many towns and cities that Sammy had already seen Baby Furs touch and alter, they came into a new one. He even remembered on how he had helped the others back in Frankie Town alter his own home after he transformed.  And Or-lan-do didn&#39;t look any different from what Sammy had already seen. He held Jessy&#39;s hand and smiled to her as they rode along and looking at the bigger city. Eventually they came to a sign that had a big letter &quot;C&quot; and a drawing of the globe next to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sea World,&quot; Jessy said in awe as the bus rode along.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sammy nodded as the bus came to a stop near a large building that was designed to be the main entrance building and thus gateway to the rest of the park. It looked fun and made Sammy wonder on whether or not there were &quot;aquatic Baby Furs.&quot; Sammy had noticed that most all of them were based off of some furry mammals like he was a fox and Jessy was a raccoon. They&#39;d also met some baby furs that weren&#39;t based off of typical animals, such as Maxi, who flew them to Jackie Ville who was a robin Baby Fur and one of the other Baby Furs at the airport had been a bat Baby Fur, but all them still came from animals that had legs. If there were aquatic Baby Furs, would they have legs? Or would they be like fish or whales and dolphins and were limited to the water?  It left Sammy all kinds of curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will be fun, doncha think?&quot; Jessy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sammy agreed, &quot;for a great adventure for stories we can tell everyone in Frankie Town.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jessy nodded eagerly. Some of what Sammy and Amy had talked about flew over her head a little, but bits and pieces made sense, and the adventure they were on was fun. They were both making so many new friends. As the bus came to a stop those that were all going to Sea World joined Sammy and Jessy in moving off the bus. They thanked the lamb Baby Fur for driving them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatcha think an ack-kwa-tic friend would be like?&quot; Sammy wondered to Jessy, &quot;Do you think they&#39;d still have legs and could walk? Or...&quot;<br />
<br />
The thought of a orca (killer whale) based Baby Fur stuck alone in a tank of water as night came down and others went home crossed his mind, and that made the lower lip on his muzzle quiver. Friends should always be with friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;We kept our legs,&quot; a young male voice spoke up making Sammy and Jessy look forward.<br />
<br />
Before them in a white diaper was a Baby Fur with largely grayish colored skin, brown eyes a bottle-like nose or muzzle, though neither Sammy nor Jessy could see any nostrils on him. He had no hair, his fingers and toes were webbed slightly, and behind him was a modest tail that looked like a dolphin&#39;s tail flukes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi! I&#39;m Barry the Dolphin!&quot; the dolphin Baby Fur introduced himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sammy the Fox,&quot; Sammy spoke. &quot;Jessy the Raccoon,&quot; Jessy said at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleased to meetcha,&quot; Barry smiled, &quot;sorry to inn-terr-upt, but you sounded worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wondered if ack-kwa-tic Baby Furs had kept their legs or had lost them and were stuck being alone in tanks,&quot; Sammy told him, &quot;and I wouldn&#39;t want you to be alone in tanks. Friends should be with friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
He clasped Jessy&#39;s paw tightly to show that she was his bestest friend. Jessy smiled and Barry did notice. He pivoted around, allowing Sammy and Jessy to see the gray skinned dorsal fin on his back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well don&#39;t worry,&quot; Barry said, &quot;We all kept our legs and have had ever so much fun here. Thank you for being con-sir-nnnduh though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We always look out for our friends and wish them well,&quot; Jessy said to Barry, who only smiled in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you came to see the show?&quot; Barry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sammy nodded, it wasn&#39;t part of his mission, but he figured that a little fun would let him learn more as well. In that way he figured he&#39;d be more ready for when he and Jessy found the First Fur. He continued after a brief moment, &quot;and have fun too. What&#39;s it like? Can you swim better now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you talk to fish?&quot; Jessy asked.<br />
<br />
Barry looked to them and said...</p>
