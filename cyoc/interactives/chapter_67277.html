<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Simon patted his new hairy gut in awe, feeling the strength and girth of being the spawn of Bryan's loins. It was extremely weird to feel that someone who only moments before had been his friend, was now his father. But at the same time it felt oddly normal. Looking over at Bryan, who was happily examining his more mature body in the mirror, Simon felt the rush of emotions of seeing a man who had cared for him his entire life and was a loving father, even though he knew not of it had really happened.<br />
<br />
Looking at Jay, too, Simon felt a desire to protect and nurture his son, and watch him grow up. He knew Jay was really the same age as him, but still he 'knew' that he loved his son and had cared for him since he was born.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, this is really weird. Do you two sort of feel like...we've always been family?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay nodded and walked over, suddenly hugging Simon in a tight embrace. Slightly taken aback, Simon lifted him up and hugged back, kissing his son on the top of the head before grinning proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh alright, let's stay like this just for a little while. But I want to try some more stuff on the machine. That alright with you, 'dad'?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan laughed and sat down, sighing as he rested his strong, hairy form. With how he kept poking at his bushy, slightly graying body hair, and proudly flexing his strong arms, he was clearly enjoying this too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, 'son'. Knew you'd come around to seeing how great being a real man is. Your old man passed down some mighty fine DNA.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon put Jay down, and walked over to the Chronivac, wondering what might be fun to try. When he saw an option that appealed, he grinned and quickly set up the change, his fingers clattering loudly on the keyboard. Jay bounced around behind him, trying to see what he was doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you pick, dad?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a final flourish of the enter key, Simon finished and span around on his computer chair to look at Bryan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you'll see.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan blinked and touched his head as he felt a tingling in his scalp. His hair began to move and shimmer, small pins and needles covering his head as new hairs started pushing out, his bald spot turning brown from growing short hairs before they reached the length of the rest of his hair, which was lightening from its deep black to a dark, caramel brown. His hair grew longer and thicker, spreading down the sides of his head and even into a bushy, thick forest under his chin, a true bestial mane. Though the color was rich, he still had streaks of gray in the middle of his forehead and at his sideburns, lending his mane a mature and adult tone. Bryan stroked it and grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sick of inheriting your dad's bald spot eh? Well, guess it's not a bad change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simon just chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, there's more to come.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan felt the pins and needles sensation moving across the rest of his body, and looked down at his bare chest to see the parts of his thick body hair that were not gray lightening to that same brown. However, more hairs were pushing out all over his skin, of a lighter, bronze shade. Surprised, he stroked his chest and looked in wonder at the back of his hands, as the hairs grew and thickened, covering ever part of his body in a tide-like flow of growing hair. Shaking, he finally looked down and touched what was clearly a soft, fine coat of fur. His fur was bronze in most areas, but on his belly and groin was a lighter shade of peach. Where he had normal human body hair, there were darker brown hairs in a pattern across his fur.<br />
<br />
There was an odd, crunching noise, and Bryan raised his hand to see his fingers thickening, the skin on his palms bubbling up and swelling into brown, rough pawpads. His fingernails faded and vanished, and small, sharp black points appeared on the tips of each finger. Grinning, he found that he could unsheath them at will, revealing powerful and sharp black claws.<br />
<br />
Pulling up one foot, he saw his soles changing and swelling into similar pads, as his big toe shrank and moved down slightly, becoming smaller and harder to see. The other toes swelled and stretched massively, each growing a powerful pad before his claws pushed through the tips, out from his fur. Standing up, he tottered slightly as his feet grew longer, ankles bending to form digitigrade feline feet.<br />
<br />
The room was filled with a deep, slow rumbling, which after a moment Bryan realized was coming from him. His face ached and cracked, bones reshaping as his nose and mouth pushed forward, his nose changing and flattening into a wide, short black feline nose. His upper lip split as long whiskers sprouted from his cheeks, and he growled as his teeth sharpened and reshaped into vicious, animal fangs. His ears moved upwards slightly, growing furry and turning round as the tips darkened to black.<br />
<br />
Feeling power filling his body, Bryan stretched and felt himself rise and widen, growing to over eight feet tall and feeling his mane brush the ceiling. His boxers stretched to their limit and tore as he felt a shifting from his tailbone, which was stretching and growing into a waving, sinuous tail. The tip sprouted a bush of darker hair, and with one final change, Bryan roared loudly and his eyes shifted into the deep amber of a lion.<br />
<br />
Standing in front of the other, who were awestruck by the change, was now a massive hulking anthropomorphic lion. His body was packed with muscle, but under his fur it was softened by the heavy weight of his gut and slight layer of fat, and his fur was dark and graying with maturity that made him seem no less powerful. Bryan grinned, his sharp white teeth glinting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy crap, son, this feels incredible! You've got to try it!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the others felt a rush of strength and testosterone pound through them, they realized they soon would. They all shared Bryan's DNA, and that was now the DNA of a mighty anthro lion.</p>
