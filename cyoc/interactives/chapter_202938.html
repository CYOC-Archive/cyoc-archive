<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">[&#120191;&#120205;&#120202; &#120395;&#120215;&#120212;&#120203;&#120202;&#120216;&#120216;&#120212;&#120215;&#39;&#120216; &#120184;&#120212;&#120211;&#120216;&#120217;&#120202;&#120215; &#120175;&#120202;&#120221; &#120212;&#120213;&#120202;&#120211;&#120216; &#120218;&#120213;]<br />
<br />
Sneakits are serpentine like feline creatures with a shadow/poison poison type, with long luxurious black fur with a pointed cross of a budding lion&#39;s mane and a black cobra&#39;s hood, they have both fur and furred scales. <br />
<br />
Their tail is covered in a thick black hair that shimmers like scales, yet feels soft as silk, that curls around to form the base of their tails. At the tip of it&#39;s tail, it also has a small tuft on top which looks similar to cross of a lion&#39;s tip, a black cobra&#39;s fleshy scaled base, and a black fox&#39;s fluffy covering of fur upon their scales. However at the end is a very fang like stinger that can produce paralytic venom as a kitten, and aphrodisacs when sexually mature.<br />
<br />
Their second form of the Sneakit is the Sneakat. A more adult like frame. Here when Sneakat&#39;s reach sexual maturity, they shed all but their manes into adulthood for an even longer coat. This new growth forms along its spine forming a sort of &#39;cobra&#39; hood between their head and neck, this grows outwards from behind them so much that it almost resembles a pair of wings. <br />
<br />
Each has a aphrodisiac hook, where they can lift up their prey into the air while stinging them with aphrodisiac to give little way in the way of resisting mating or topping. While they are not malicious nor will harm their targets, they have strong primal urges to smear and spread their seed everywhere possible once adults and aroused. They prefer to do so by having sex with many partners over time to ensure offspring, however if unable to find mates then they may resort to other methods.<br />
<br />
They can be found living near shadowy forested deep woods water sources, especially lakes and rivers. Though they don&#39;t usually venture too far away from these areas unless there is a lack of food nearby.<br />
<br />
When hunting for large prey, they will use teamwork to corner them until one sneaks in close enough before striking quickly with their aphrodisiac stingers. They will sometimes work together using their abilities to confuse predators. Once the predator gets close enough, another member of the group will attack from above or below. Some of their toxins are even powerful enough to make even males or females alike sprout more or new additional breasts, and then lactate against their will with a nonstop leak as their enzymes trick their victims into producing milk to feed their muzzles. The changes however, often have a side effect of being meant to be temporary, sometimes leaving permanent changes.<br />
<br />
While voracious breeders, they are also known to be strangely potentially either highly aloof and hard to bond with. While most animals will instinctually bond with their owners despite treatment (whether poor or insastifactory), Sneakits often themselves will decide what owners they want to have, even wandering away from Trainers with their free will they don&#39;t want to follow. Or chasing one down they want to train with. They can be known to be extremely cold and aloof, knowing their trainer&#39;s commands, and yet ignoring ALL of them, or extremely warm, and cuddly, and inseparatable from their trainer&#39;s side. Even leaping up through fences and windows to bond with a human they met in the woods and following them by scent and jumping through a window up to 5 miles from their home even as kittens. Purring and following the traces by human scent alone or their nightvision.<br />
<br />
Reports of savage Sneakat&#39;s attacking humans who harm their young, with as well as affectionate Sneakits and Sneakat&#39;s purring and rubbing onto shoulders are known. They can be extremely doting in the right hands as little inseparatable furballs purring on your ear, nuzzling every hour of every day, wanting nothing but love and attention from you, though some have reported Sneakit&#39;s biting, scratching, clawing, and even spitting venomous spit at those they feel threaten their territory or loved ones such as their kittens or favorite humans. <br />
<br />
If left alone, they will likely wander off into the woods and hunt for food and try to return to their home later, as they are highly active nocturnal ambush hunters. Their main diet consists of mammals and birds, particularly mice and rabbits. If they get a chance to catch a bigger prey, they&#39;ll go after it. They&#39;re able to leap great distances with ease thanks to their ability to fly.<br />
<br />
Though they aren&#39;t normally aggressive towards humans, they still possess the potential to lash out if attacked. In addition to their normal attacks, they can fire poisonous spikes from their clawed heel ends of either paws. These spikes can be coated reflexibly with either a an aphrodisiac or paralytic or poisonous compound, which makes could make them temptingly irresistible to any creature they land on or neutralize a threat. <br />
<br />
However while equipped with natural tools, there is one drawback. In a human and animal fusion, Sneakat&#39;s are known to have quite a bit of free will, and will choose to disobey orders given to them, or even simply refuse to listen to commands at all times. For example, a human might tell their Sneakit to stop doing something, and instead they&#39;d keep going without stopping. It isn&#39;t unheard of for them to even run away from their owner entirely.<br />
<br />
However, they are known to become attached to certain individuals. Often people whom they&#39;ve been raised with since birth. Such as their caretakers. Especially if they were treated well, fed, and cared for, played with, socialized and bonded they will often treat the person(s) with the same love as any other family member. Some people have even reported Sneakits following their owners like giant dogs, following them around and purring around them, even waiting for their &#39;owners&#39; to return home. They can grow easily up to adult lion or tiger size. However poor training may result in Sneakat&#39;s mating their trainers, pets, and even spouses.<br />
<br />
Sneakat&#39;s are said to be capable of transforming into a third stage of evolution. However this is considered rarer than the first two stages. When transformed, they could gain the ability to manipulate shadows to create illusions, making them nearly invisible. As well as allowing them to teleport short distances, creating portals and passageways within shadows. It&#39;s said the illusions, while not as solid as reality, can leave one trapped within them enough to hump, be touched by, and even penetrate them. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;As I mentioned earlier, Sneakats are a intelligent and elusive shadowy feline species. They have evolved alongside human society, but still retain traits of wild cats. This means that their intelligence varies widely depending on how they were raised. Most Sneakkats tend to be intelligent and friendly, although occasionally they will exhibit signs of aggression.&quot; Professor Rosalie comments, as you finish hearing the explanation. <br />
<br />
&quot;So, is this the creature you want to fuse with? Because if so, we can start now!&quot; She says, pulling a flashlight from her belt. You look over at the professor curiously, wondering why she would just throw out random flashlights. But then you see it flash open in front of your face as from the corner, sneaks a lynx sized one, revealing a dark shadow shrouded black scaled cat beast, with large glowing yellow eyes. Long fanglike sabre teeth with a hole at each end for venom. Its fur was mostly shiny, shadowy black wisped scales except for a purple hourglass patch on the chest and back like a black widow, and had a large red snakelike tongue flicking out of its mouth.<br />
<br />
It stared directly into your soul as it opened his large jaw wide, showing rows of sharp teeth.. You gulp for a while, before you hear a little squeak, and then a kitten sized version pops out, it&#39;s eyes are blepping as it sticks it&#39;s little snake tongue out. It gives a little curious yet cheerful &quot;Chir!?!?? Ssss! Chir chir CHIR!!!&quot; as the little tiny snake creature, the size of a pint cup runs up to you, gives a tiny roar and then bites your shoe with it&#39;s tiny fangs. It purrs while it attacks you, looking up at you with kitten eyes.<br />
<br />
You squeal as the little thing nibbles on your foot, and yelp as he licks your toes with his tongue, causing you to laugh. He seems happy about whatever it did, giving you a cute grin before licking his lips and sticking his tongue out again. Then the big one jumps forward, and starts sniffing the little one, seeming confused as to why it won&#39;t bite him. Meanwhile, you watch intently as the professor turns the light on, and begins scanning the creature.<br />
&quot;Oh yes, these are quite the prolific breeders, though they can be very affectionate. So long as they have proper training and care, they can be loyal companions...though they are known to be very protective of their territories,&quot; she says, tapping the scanner, watching the screen as it flashes a few things across it. After a minute, she nods and smiles slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, you could even adopt two if you wanted! Though, the smaller kitten one would probably be like, more of a traditional pet than a fusion, but hey, it&#39;s up to you!&quot; She says excitedly, grabbing your hand and leading you outside.<br />
<br />
[ &#119930;&#119951;&#119942;&#119938;&#119948;&#119946;&#119957; &#119938;&#119951;&#119941; &#119930;&#119951;&#119942;&#119938;&#119948;&#119938;&#119957; &#119926;&#119939;&#119957;&#119938;&#119946;&#119951;&#119942;&#119941;! ]<br />
<br />
The Sneakit kitten and Sneakat follow you cautiously. One happily, tail wagging, staring at you with their huge yellow orbs with a smile, the other a wary, stalking, curious purrowl. it seems to tilt it&#39;s head, watching you. You smile, patting them both on their heads gently. The little sneakit kitten purrs and chirrups into your pet, flicking it&#39;s little forked tongue to kiss back, while the older male watches your hand warily, taking the pet, but shrinking a bit as their ears fold back. <br />
<br />
The professor leads you to the nearest forest path, taking your hand and guiding you inside the trees. There&#39;s only darkness here, save for the occasional twinkling stars and moonlight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, one more thing i should mention&quot; Professor Rosalie notes, as she rummages through her bags. &quot;You could either go for a rival, or you could have your first encounter in the woods. Or even both. I have a daughter named Gwen. She&#39;s into like those poisonous types like snakes and lizards and bats too. I&#39;ll have to warn you, Sneakats do have a couple weaknesses. You&#39;ll be strong against other enemy&#39;s poisons, aphrodisacs and paralytics, but they can inject you with your own or make you sting yourself with your tail. Which could lead to pregnancy if you let it happen. And i suppose, you&#39;re supposedly supposed to be weak to bug types or rock types. But not a lot of people want to turn into a rock type for sexual fights for.. semi obvious reasons. So you should be fine. Just avoid those kinds of enemies when possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway, good luck~&quot; She says cheerfully, giving you another quick hug before leaving.</p>
