<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Alicia smiled, as the fifth turn began.  How long could this wonderful game continue?  He reached to pick up the dice from in front of Joanna.  She seemed to want something, but his eyes were still focused on James.  Specifically, he'd finally caught sight of the little slit that hid James's manhood.  He wondered ... do snakes really have two dicks?  Of course, at the moment, James was in use, learning to refine the movements of his tail well enough to offer pleasure to his mistress Nicole in an entirely new manner.  The dice didn't move.  How could he have forgotten the sex curse?  "Nicole," he began sweetly, "I see that your snake is a little occupied at the moment."  He sighed.  "But he's the only way I can keep going in the game.  Do you think I could borrow him for a bit?"</p>

<p>Nicole's body shuddered, her hands clasped around the last visible part of James's tail before it disappeared within her slit.  "Of course you can," she finally answered, motioning for the naga to cease his current ministrations.  "Just have him wait here when you're done with him.  I have... something else to attend to."</p>

<p>As James slithered over to wards the todd fox, Nicole walked over to the quivering dragonness.  "What seems to be the trouble dear?" she asked.</p>

<p>"My breasts..." Joanna managed to answer, desperately fumbling with her nipples in a futile effort to relieve the pressure.</p>

<p>"Oh my, you'll never get anywhere that way.  Here, let me show you."  And the vixen knelt before her, muzzle coming to press against the scaled areola.  Another drop of liquid rolled over the bright scales.  Nicole smiled, then pressed her tongue hard against the nipple, opening her muzzle wide to accommodate more of the scaled orb, then drawing in her breath slowly.  The dragon purred and writhed under her tongue, and her sucking and pressure yielded up their hoped-for reward.  Nicole's eyes grew wide as her mouth filled with the dragon's milk.  It was warm and rich, with a taste both creamy and coppery, unlike anything she had ever had.  But the taste only mattered for a moment.  After that, the milk was only pleasure.  Nicole felt as if her entire body was as sensitive and responsive as the woman's nipple underneath her tongue.  The movement of air across her skin brought ecstasy, the touch of scales against her fur was beyond words.  Joanna watched the effect her latest curse had on this vixen, and craned her neck far down and forward.  It was just enough for her to wrap her tongue about her own free nipple. She couldn't milk herself as quickly or as fully as a suckling mouth, and her belly was soon wet with more of the blessed liquid that her mouth would ever taste.  But what a taste!  Every drop was worth savoring, every moment she held her own milk in her mouth was another moment of absolute bliss.  Together, the two women ignored the world, lost in their own reveries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Alicia had concluded exactly how he wished to fulfill the requirements of his curse.  "I'm not quite sure how to fuck you yet, Snake, so I'll leave that for later.  However, I've heard some very interesting things about what you have hidden in that vent."  The gay todd knelt, and leaned forward, holding himself up by his hands.  "I want you to take me, Snake.  And while you do that, I want you to show me how skilled you've become with that tail of yours."  Alicia ran her hand along her erect penis.  "Here."</p>

<p>James bowed and nodded.  He slid back and forth examining the fox, before sliding the end of his long tail around  Alicia's back knees, brushing against the fur as he did so.  He let it rise up, and loop gently around the fox's maleness, coiling just tightly enough to be felt, but no tighter.  He could feel Alicia begin to thrust and shift against his scaled coils.  This isn't right, he thought.  I should be with Nicole - or a woman at the least, not here.  But his body was all ready responding, the twin heads of his hemipenes cool in the open air.  Of course I should be here, James realized.  This is where Nicole wants me to be.  He reached forward, teasing the fox's tailhole open with first one finger, then two.  Sliding forward, he pressed one head of the hemipene against the fleshy ring.  "I thought," gasped Alicia, as he continued to work himself against the coils, "that you had two of those."  And as the todd asked, so he did, guiding the hemipenes together with his hand, he pushed both heads through the muscular entrance.  Once inside, without firm pressure keeping them together, they flared back apart, filling the fox more fully than he had expected.  He rocked further, pushing the snake deeper within him in slow, steady thrusts.  It was a new experience for both of them, and one that could not last long.  Alicia was no longer on all fours, but instead had hands stretched out before him, head against the ground, but tail flagged high as the great snake offered him pleasure from both sides.  James tightened the coils at the end of his tail for just an instant, and the carpet was stained with the fruits of their labor.  Moments later, Alicia moaned again as he found himself far more filled by James than he had been emptied.</p>

<p>As James's hemipenes slipped popped out of the panting fox to slip back inside their vent, Alicia managed to catch sight of the dice.  He picked them up and tossed them, unconcerned, onto the board.  He smiled as his figurine stopped on a yellow square.  Perhaps he could alter someone else to be more ... suitable.</p>

<p><i>Changes come and changes go,<br>
and many have gone before.<br>
You now must choose to re-use one -<br>
a choice you can't ignore!</i></p>

<p>So many choices!  Anything that had happened in the game was his to revisit, or perhaps even to visit upon someone else.  As options raced through his mind, he caught sight of a dog, lying in the corner.  He remembered now!  Daniel had been turned into a bitch, and in all the recent activity, had been overlooked.  And his turn was next.  "Well, we can't have that," Alicia commented to no one in particular.  "If you lose next turn, that's one less player we'll have.  And that's so many fewer options to play with."  The earlier transformation seemed to play in reverse, as Daniel was restored to human form.  In fact, he was restored to the condition he was in at the beginning of the game.  Human, male, and well-endowed ... but not too well-endowed.</p>

<p>Alicia grinned.  He knew he'd been missing something.  He tossed Daniel the dice.</p></p>
