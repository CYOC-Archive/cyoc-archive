<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">My sister had avoided a fate that many would call worse than death, thanks to Jay&#39;s Three Fortunate Mistakes.<br />
1.)  The very First of Jay&#39;s Mistakes was trusting the backstreet dealers he met after scrounging on the darker web for some time.  In his impatience to achieve his dream, he took the dealers&#39; word after only viewing some small proof that the crystallized &quot;Sex Beast&quot; semen he had received had been specially modified to produce Penis Transformations.  The dealers weren&#39;t wrong - the semen came from 5 sex beasts that had semen that contained this very specific, special transformative property chosen by The Rogue himself.  Jay thought &quot;refined&quot; meant &quot;perfected.&quot;  The crystallized poison was just as unpredictable as any other transformative body fluid from any other sex beast.  In addition to the desired CTF, there was no telling what other transformations would occur due to the instability of the &quot;drug.&quot;<br />
2.)  The Second of Jay&#39;s Mistakes was an idiotic one.  <br />
He . . . took the same crystallized sex beast semen he had drugged Nat with. <br />
Jay hadn&#39;t been truly paying attention when he had bought it and believed that both he and his lover needed the &quot;drug&quot; for the transformation to occur.  If he had only drugged Nat and not himself, there was a chance he himself wouldn&#39;t have undergone a change that was too drastic.  Having drugged himself, there was a certainty that he would now mutate - potentially heavily depending on the severity or progression of his &quot;new penis&#39;&quot; transformation.<br />
Haste makes waste.<br />
3.)  The Third Mistake was, in  unavoidable.  Displaying some aspect of empathy, Jay figured that it would be somewhat morally questionable to have the mind of his former lover stuck, helpless, inside his sexual organ.  Yes, the thought was sexy - but what was the point?  He couldn&#39;t talk to her, she couldn&#39;t talk back, and they wouldn&#39;t be able to hear each other&#39;s thoughts without some modifications.  There was also the concern that she might, over time, learn to commandeer parts of their shared body.  As such, Jay spent a couple thousand dollars buying some experimental pills that were designed to nullify and eliminate a consciousness by permanently shutting down its higher brain function.  Jay didn&#39;t want Nat to &quot;die&quot; - he just &quot;didn&#39;t want her to suffer.&quot;  So he ground up half a pill and hid it inside a chocolate truffle.  And by some luck, Jay&#39;s plan had worked - he had fed it to Nat as they were getting frisky, and by all means it should have worked in time to scrub her mind as she finished transforming into a penis.  But . . . an experimental drug such as this, the effects of which would come with great risk into fruition during the event of a transformation - an unpredictable, extreme one facilitated by unstable sex beast semen, administered incorrectly to both the target and the user?  Jay rolled snake eyes.  His sticks came out all short.  Not Nat&#39;s though.<br />
<br />
The only thing Nat could hear was the powerful, pleasurable throbbing that came from within her, filling her head, chest, and ears, blocking out the silence of the room.  Powerful thumps shook her body at nearly every second, jarring her eyesight, as the pre-cum that flowed from her lips slowly was pumped up with each pulse.  Unable to move or speak, she simply closed her eyes and waited for her &quot;erection&quot; to subside - or for Jay to &quot;wake up.&quot;  When enough uneventful silence had passed, Nat from her vertical view of the room, peeled her eyes as far upwards as she could.  Jay&#39;s limp body lay with its soulless eyes open, taking shallow, subconscious breathing as the little remains of his conscious mind finally purged itself from existence.  If she could have screamed in pure vindictive glee, she would have.  She didn&#39;t know what was wrong with him, but by the looks of him and his pale skin, he wouldn&#39;t be coming too for a little while.<br />
Some 15 minutes had passed by the time my sister finally grew fearful that she would be stuck in this position forever - until the throbbing finally began to subside.  As the head-pounding pleasure, heat, and sweat finally came to an end, one last massive glob of pre-cum pumped out from her nuts as she lurched forward.  As her body lost its rigidity, the new, unpredictable transformations finally took effect with her exhale.<br />
Her torso and head began to slowly grow back in size, and after a few minutes, it had reached her familiar old height.  Second, with a strange, hypersensitive, and, put simply, &quot;squishy&quot; feeling, her testicles plumped up even further into prodigious mammaries that crowded for room between Jay&#39;s legs.  Gently leaking a mix of semen and breastmilk from their nipples, they would be better described as &quot;breasticles&quot; - a relatively common transformation that was an immaculate fusion of supple titflesh and well-endowed family jewels that had become some sort of an internet meme in the last few months.<br />
When Nat felt some sensation at the stumps at her shoulders and at the front of Jay&#39;s hips - where hers&#39; should have been, she smiled.  Faster, she thought.  Faster, before he wakes up and realizes what&#39;s going on!  As fast as they disappeared, Nat&#39;s arms and legs grew back from their stumps.<br />
<br />
But this transformation was not a very stable one, and Nat wouldn&#39;t be separated any time soon.</p>
