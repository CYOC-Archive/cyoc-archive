<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer not knowing what the show one piece is goes off of which saga sounded the coolest to her. Kyle said impatiently “hurry up jen some of us actually are going to need to get to school.” Jen thinking that the only one she vaguely understood where she was going to be and also the only one that sounded cool to her she said “ skypia”<br />
The room that she was standing in started to blur Jen rubbing her eyes thinking that it was her eye sight screwing up. Then the room started to spin, Jen was thinking in her mind that this can’t be happening the town curse is not real. The room started to spin faster and faster she was getting really dizzy and closed her eyes. Then just as fast as it started it stopped.<br />
<br />
Jenny could feel the warmth of the sun on her body thinking that this can’t happen if she is inside her house. She opens her eyes and sees that she is on a beach of some sort with the sun beaming down on her. Looking around she sees the water, but it looked different she walked up to it and saw that they were clouds that seemed to be mimicking the properties of water. Watching as the clouds started to come in to the beach it rushed over her feet that is when she noticed that her clothes had changed she was wearing some lace up sandals then a short pink skirt what had a belt made out of medal rings on the right side of the belt she saw a object that looked like it was a lightsaber hilt with a clear base that looked to be filled with water. And on the left side was a satchel like bag. As she looked up to her shirt it was a green tank top. And then her hands had some fingerless gloves on that seemed to match her outfit.<br />
<br />
As she was looking at her shirt she noticed something on her back. Upon further inspection she found they were wings. Trying to flap them she realized that they were not meant to make her fly they were just there for decoration she assumed.<br />
<br />
Looking around not seeing anyone around she grabbed the lightsaber looking thing off her belt and inspected it. Then it hit her, Kyle did say that she was going to get something called a water whip and thought this must be it. Seeing a switch just above her thumb she pushed it up. All of a sudden a stream of water came shooting out of the top freaking her out she jumped a bit and dropped it. The tentacle of water sucked back in to the whip. Composing herself she picked it back up and activated it once more. Kyle did say that she was going to be pretty good with it. She looked around and saw a fruit in a tree and decided that she was going to knock it down with her whip.<br />
<br />
She flung the whip at it and with pin point accuracy she knocked it out of the tree. Proud with herself she walked over so that she could enjoy the spoils of her triumph. Getting close to it she heard a rustle in the bush next to it. Suddenly a small little fox came out and stole the fruit from her. Normally she loved animals and would not hurt one ever but. On impulse she grabbed her whip and with lightning fast speed she swung the whip around the fox’s neck forcing it to drop the fruit. She noticed the black fox was shaking. Walking up to the fox she grabbed the fruit from in front of it and undid the whip. The fox freed ran little bit away still scared and watched as jenny tried to eat the fruit. Failing she threw the fruit to the side in frustration. Still really hungry she heard her stomach start to growl at her. the fox noticing this ran over and pawed the fruit to be in front of jenny then started to yip  this got jenny’s attention and then it showed her that the top may be hard to open but the bottom was soft and easy to open. Jenny looked at the fox as it started to leave her to eat the fruit. Jenny yelled at the fox to wait and it stopped and looked at jenny she grabbed her whip and slashed another fruit down and set it next to her. The fox took this as an act of kindness and ran over to sit next to jenny and eat. The two sat there for a little bit and became fast friends.<br />
<br />
About an hour later she saw a girl that stopped a long ways away and then started to run strait toward jenny. The fox was sitting in jenny’s lap as jenny pet it. As the little girl got close to jenny she started to yell out her name. Jenny guessed that that meant that she knew this girl somehow. The girl ran straight in to jenny glomp hugging her. And sobbing. <br />
<br />
The little girl between sobs said “onesan where have you been … I woke up and you were gone… I thought I lost you.” The fox scared ran five feet way and turned around to see what happened. Jenny sat there and started to comfort the little girl. After some time of cheering the little girl up the little girl asked that in payment for scaring her so much jenny go home and play a game with her. Jenny looked at the girl that was supposedly her little sister and then at the fox that had moved back to jenny’s side and was taking a small nap. Then decided to…</p>
