<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They moved away from the others, Rod throwing the ball and Mei happily hunting it down to return it joyfully. The fenced dog area occupied a good portion of the park and whilst other dog areas often consisted of a bare field and was considerably small, in this quarter of town it was quite large with bushes and trees on it and a shallow pond for the dogs to play in. After moving along Rod and Mei were pretty much out of sight of the group of the other dog owners. Once again Rod threw the ball and once again Mei hunted it down and returned it. Like before she put the ball down to Rod&#39;s feet and set down, watching him expectedly. <br />
Rod bowed down and stroke her head, scratching her behind the ears. This dog was different. He knew it. Rod couldn&#39;t place it, but there was something about her ... his hands moved along her body, stroking her back, patting her bum and touching her chest. Oh, that chest. Again he had a hard on. &quot;Why am I getting a boner for God&#39;s sake?&quot; Rod was as horny as could be and though excited he was also scared. Was he getting into bestiality now? Could the others see him? He got up and turned his head to get a glimpse at the other dog-owners, whether they were watching, when he suddenly felt Mei prodding his crotch with her snout. His prick felt as if it wanted to burst. Rod cringed and turned to Mei again. That dog was clearly sniffing his crotch now, pushing against it again and again and even yelping. <br />
&quot;What the ...?&quot; He was getting all wet. He knew it ... precum was leaking and his underpants were all slippery. The intensive smell of precum animated Mei to prod Rod even more vigorously now. &quot;Shhht ... stop it! Stop it!&quot; ... Rod was going to the ground and then without even thinking straight he opened up his fly. He had been right, his underpants was a pool of sticky precum. Why did he open his pants in the first place? He did not understand. He probably wouldn&#39;t have understood the situation even if he had known that Ty had been snipping his fingers a moment ago, making the other dog owners who were discussing the advantage of one type of dog food over the other why he was doing that. (Ty told them it was a bad habit of his.) As a result, however, Rod was on his back, pants down and Mei - that he took for a dog and who sure thought of herself as a dog - working his dick. <br />
Naturally convinced of being a dog, Mei was licking Rod&#39;s crotch with a vigor and force that he had never ever experienced before and for sure he never was as horny as in that very moment. Mei pushed down his shorts with her snout and had direct access to his dick that was already glistening of precum. Her tongue was all over it now, abusing the bellend with all force. It did not take long and Rod was not able to hold back any more. He came like he had never cum before. He shot out what must have been the biggest load of his life. Ever since he was married sexual activities had gone down and as a matter of fact there was not much that deserved the title &quot;sex life&quot; with his wife any more. Everyday life had been all about work, money, who walks the dog and who takes out the junk. Romance was gone. Therefore Rod had been building up a lot lately and it seemed to come out all at once now, licked by a mere dog. It was crazy! <br />
Rod wasn&#39;t able to think straight. He felt dizzy and blissed and disgusted and horny all at the same time. Mei on her end was all over him with her tongue, licking off all ejaculate there was and once and again licking his helmet again, which - being all sensitive now - caused Rod to shiver all over.</p>
