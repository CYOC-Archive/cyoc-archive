<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake put his hand up to his chin as he examined his face in the mirror. &quot;Trippy.&quot;<br />
<br />
His reflection grinned on its own. &quot;Oh, we&#39;re not done yet.&quot; Another flash of light washed over him. His already tight shirt became unbearably constricting as his torso swelled further. He dug fingers into the stretched fabric and yanked. It split down the front, exposing a chest that now sported a pair of pectorals.<br />
<br />
He dropped to his knees and the front of his jeans split apart with a loud ripping noise, exposing a pair of white briefs stretched out from containing more than they were ever meant to. His exposed thighs had begun to grow the lightest dusting of hair, thicker curlier hair poking over the band of those white briefs.<br />
<br />
While he kneeled his reflection stood tall in the tattered clothing. His dark brows growing thicker, his nose a bit wider, and his jaw more angular. The sparse hairs on his chin and lip grew first into a patchy stubble then a short beard. The sleeves of his ripped shirt finally gave way as his arms got too thick for the child sized garment. Dark hairs grew up his tightening stomach , stopping just past his belly button, leaving his chest smooth. Though he could see two dark bushes under his arms. His cock finally flopped free of his underwear as the elastic in the waistband gave up. Thick and heavy, it flopped down between his thighs.<br />
<br />
He panted heavily, placing his hands on the floor as he looked up at his reflection. The remaining scraps of his clothes were under him. His reflection self stood tall in the mirror looking down at him with a curious expression. He was an athletic man, not bulky, but definitely a regular at the local gym, with only a smattering of body hair, but still with a nice beard and thick head of hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;One last thing.&quot; Reflection-Jake murmured, and suddenly Jake felt like his head was in a vice. Memories came pouring in of an altered life. His grandparents, his mother&#39;s parents were now his parents, and his mother was his older sister. His father was now his brother-in-law, and thinking of his made a strange feeling rise in him. The scraps of clothing on the ground slid up his body, the jeans reknitting into a pair of jeans his size. Skinny jeans that showed off his legs and ass. His blue tee reformed into a blue tank that showed off the top of his pectorals and his well toned arms.<br />
<br />
Slowly, Jake got to his feet, having to adjust to a new height, weight, and center of gravity. He stumbled a little but caught himself on an old trunk. &quot;Fuck..&quot; His voice came out deep and a little gravelly. &quot;What was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly what you wished for.&quot; Reflection Jake said, turning like he was admiring his own body in the mirror. He did have a nice butt, round and... he shook his head. &quot;You&#39;re an adult now. Twenty eight to be exact. Your mother may still treat you like a younger brother now, but she&#39;ll treat you like an adult.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the cost?&quot; Jake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something you&#39;ll figure out. Now shoo, I have to recharge, but come up and visit again. It&#39;s been a while since I had a regular visitor.&quot; Reflection Jake grinned one last time then snapped back to just a normal reflection of himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Find it yet, Jake?&quot; Came his mothe... no, sister&#39;s voice from downstairs.<br />
<br />
Right, the photo album. He saw it peeking out of one of the boxes nearby he had bumped into during his change and grabbed it. &quot;Yup! Coming down.&quot; His voice still surprised him. Even the feeling of climbing down the ladder was different in this new body. He proffered the album to his sister as he got off, and she gave him a quick peck on the cheek.<br />
<br />
He watched her head off and shook his head, trying to get those new memories to fall into place. He followed downstairs and stopped as he felt a hand clap his shoulder, a cold beer pressed into his own hand. &quot;Sorry Jen&#39;s got you running around. It&#39;s your holiday, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m used to it.&quot; Jake looked over at his once father, now brother-in-law and saw him in a new light. Jake had taken after his mother&#39;s side of the family, and that didn&#39;t seem to change much during the wish. Phil was an impressive man though, they were of a height now, which meant Jake had grown to just over six feet, but Phil had dirty blond hair in a neat crew cut, and just the hint of stubble on his jaw.  He was athletic in high school, and was still fit nowadays, but age had added a little padding to him giving him a sturdy, stocky build. For the first time Jake acknowledged that his once father was a good looking man. And felt a stirring in his pants at that thought.<br />
<br />
Oh no. The thought broke apart as he felt that urge. He had just been old enough before to start having crushes, and he knew he was attracted to girls, but all of the sudden his thoughts went to... men. Burly, hairy, handsome men. The cost?<br />
<br />
Thankfully a distraction came in the form of two young children. &quot;Uncle Jake!&quot; His now nephew of nine ran up to him, trailed by his seven year old niece. &quot;We can&#39;t beat this level.&quot; Ben held up the controller towards him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t bother your uncle..&quot; Phil started but Jake shook his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s alright.&quot; It was a good way to stop thinking about what Phil might be like in bed. He shivered at the thought and followed his niece and nephew back into the living room.</p>
