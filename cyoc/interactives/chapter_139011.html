<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A wave of nausea washed over Edwin, sending him to the floor as his knees gave out from under him. He could feel his bones and joints in his legs crackle and pop as they changed to suit a digitigrade stance, His hips gave out a loud crack as they readjusted to force Edwin&#39;s body to stand quadrupedally. He felt a pressure growing at the base of his spine, and feeling he would have no need for clothes soon, he quickly discarded his pants and t-shirt, which earned him a quick glare from Ms. Santos.<br />
<br />
Opting to keep his underwear on for little while longer, he turned his attention to his feet, unfortunately the change in shape to his feet shredded his shoes and socks beyond use. He kicked the tattered remains off to watch his small toes fuse to the rest of his changing feet. What used to be the balls of his feet took on a blackish-brown hue as they shortened and turned into paw pads. His toes were the next to change, crackling and popping as they shifted to be symmetrical with the other side, forming a neat paw print on each foot. His toenails began to grow towards the center of each toe, becoming thinner and sharper. At the same time, he felt pressure pushing inward on his newly formed claws as they became retractable.<br />
<br />
Edwin&#39;s attention then turned to his arms. His shoulders and elbows made a loud cracking noise as the joints readjusted to prevent them from moving too far outwards, gaining a bit of length in the process, matching the length of his hind legs. His hands were the next thing to change. Like the balls of his feet, his palms darkened to the same blackish-brown color, becoming paw pads. <br />
<br />
The joints in Edwin&#39;s fingers receded into his hands as his thumbs slid up his forearms, stopping a few inches from where they were, setting up for a dewclaw on each arm. Like his toenails, pressure built up as his fingernails as they became claws, just like his toes had.<br />
<br />
Edwin&#39;s attention snapped to his abdomen when he noticed three extra pairs of teats rise from his chest. Still shaky from the nausea that had thrown him to the floor in the first place, he weakly extended his right paw down to his stretched underwear and cut the elastic, letting the garment fall onto the ground, leaving Edwin completely exposed. <br />
<br />
While his penis was still there, Edwin had a feeling he was in for a massive change. He began to feel a suction from within his scrotum, slowly drawing his testicles into his body. A few seconds later, he felt two resounding pops, which he assumed were his testes inverting into ovaries, his nausea worsened had he felt his organs shift to accommodate his new womb. The suction on his scrotum increased, pulling the now-empty organ to his body. As this happened, his cock slowly shrunk and withered away into nothingness, leaving only a small opening and a clitoris where his penis was once attached. A fissure slowly opened above his new clitoris and urethra, giving leaving him with a vagina.<br />
<br />
He was now a she. She couldn&#39;t stop starting at the opening where her penis once was. Feeling a series of light pops run down her spine as her torso became thin. Fighting the nausea, she experimentally bent herself downwards, extending her tongue to reach her new opening. <br />
<br />
A powerful wave of pleasure overpowered the nausea that had kept her from rising from the floor, she relentlessly licked her new clitoris. Bending further, she stuck her tongue into the new opening, lapping furiously. Seconds felt like hours as her changing tongue dove deeper and deeper into her vagina. Unable to take it any longer, the muscles in her vagina contracted sharply multiple times, she attempted to moan in pleasure, but that came out was an inhuman growling. She slumped over onto her side, panting heavily.<br />
<br />
Her mind was still reeling over the sensation of her first female orgasm, but her focus snapped back to reality as she felt her teeth move and grind against each other as they grew sharp, perfect for a carnivorous diet. Without skipping a beat, her nose flattened and elongated alongside the lower jaw, forming a perfectly-shaped muzzle. She felt her ears change shape and creep their way to the her head, growing round along the way.<br />
<br />
Edwin felt an intense pulling sensation on her hair, she saw it recede into her head from the very corner of her eyes. The sensation stopped for only a second, but the moment of peace was short lived as a new pulling sensation arose from the rest of her body. Looking down to her abdomen, she say patches of white fur sprout up from what was moments earlier bare skin. Fur sprouted around her body in the familiar golden and spotted pattern. What lay on the floor looked identical to any other cheetah on the African Savannah.<br />
<br />
As Edwin&#39;s nausea subsided, a pressure began to grow in her head. Instincts began flooding in. The words &quot;run,&quot; &quot;hunt,&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; flashed into her mind, accompanied by the knowledge of what he needed to do survive. The headache subsided, and she was ready for the Savannah. She was ready to be released into the wild.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, everybody seems to be ready for the experiment,&quot; Ms. Santos chimed in, &quot;Remember kids: this experiment is going to last three short weeks, make the most of what time you have. We will bring you back for parent visitation if they choose to come by. Class dismissed.&quot;<br />
<br />
The children-turned-animals were now free to roam, Edwin had three weeks ahead of him. The question was, what did he want to do first?</p>
