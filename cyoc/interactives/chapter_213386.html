<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James got in a fight with his parents. Again. For about the 100th time. Being the rash young 13 year old boy that he was, he decided to show them by running away. <br />
<br />
In a fit of emotion, he decided to make the trek to this store to become a lovable, huggable teddy bear. As a young newly-minted teenager, he didn&#39;t think through his decision. He was rash, and just followed his emotions that, as a boy, was supposed to be repressed. <br />
<br />
James was a good looking kid. Medium height, kind of on the short side. Pretty thin. He had bright blue eyes, a very pleasant face, and his hair carried a nice, natural multi-colored layers. Strawberry blond on top, eesceially his bangs, that faded to a darker brown underneath and down near his neck. <br />
<br />
After stripping naked, he deposited his clothes in the shoot and turned towards the mirror. He really WAS a nice-looking kid, with a nice-looking 13 year old boy&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
He sigh.<br />
The gas began leaking from the ceiling vents. <br />
Just as it did, he began to feel a knot in the pit of his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Permanant?&quot; He thought, as he began to harbor doubt about his decision. &quot;That means....no girls.....&quot;<br />
<br />
At least, not the blossoming sexual kind. He knew he would receive states from cute girls. Even shy little giggles and blushes when he looked at them. Looking at himself as a human for the final time, he really did think it a shame to waste the qualities he was born with.<br />
<br />
Perfect eyesight.<br />
Perfect teeth. Being 13, they were large and white in his mouth. Still not worn down by age. All of his teeth were brand new &quot;adult&quot; teeth. The last of his baby teeth having fallen out last year. A molar. <br />
Nice hair.<br />
Nice deep multi-colored sparkling eyes.<br />
His nose a perfect shape. Not too large, not too small.<br />
He was athletic and naturally with a kind and quiet demeanor. Except around his parents who pressured him to much.<br />
<br />
Just as he began to breath in his first breaths of this inaninating cloud, he felt his fingers and toes seize up. They began to retract into his hands and feet! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no...&quot; he thought breathlessly with the loss of his fingers. His hands began to fold up into a tight, perfectly found arm! His feet did the same, which caused his to go flailing onto his butt! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!&quot; He said louder, as he came to realize the implications of the heavy burden he put onto himself. He began to regret his decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait. WAIT! I CHANGED MY MIND! I DONT WANT TO BEGLCOME A TEDDY BEAR!&quot; he shouted. <br />
<br />
He wanted to crawl over towards the door to open it. But it was already too late. His rounded foot-nubs had already started plushifying! A light brown felt covered the bottoms of his &quot;feet.&quot; The same was happening to his rounded &quot;hands!&quot; <br />
<br />
The light brown gave way to a darker brown at the edges, as the faux fur began to spread up his legs and arms. Shortening them. Widening them! Becoming more and more teddy-bear-like.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, no, no!&quot; He wailed. <br />
He began to flail his arms and legs against the floor. The sound getting softer with each bang. His arms no longer able to even REACH the floor as his still-human torso was too tall. <br />
<br />
He kept kicking his legs, but it was futile. The plush and stuffing had completely consumed them as a black threading seam made its way up and down them on both the outside and the inside! Eventually, he couldn&#39;t move them at all, as they straighted out with a slight bend to hold him in a steady sitting position. A position he would be stuck in for the rest of time!<br />
<br />
His arms likewise was wiggling around less and less, as they spread wider and wider.<br />
<br />
&quot;My arms! I....I can&#39;t move them! Oh god!&quot; <br />
<br />
No more video games for him!<br />
No more books! <br />
No more baseball! <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh!! Heeelp!! Please! Someone! Stop this!&quot;<br />
<br />
But it wouldn&#39;t stop!<br />
<br />
His still-small, but beginning to develop penis and balls sucked up into his body, turning him into a genderless teddy down there. Black thread and brown fur covering where his pelvis one was. His waist shrinking and rounding out. Giving him a plumper look. He felt his size begin to diminish, as his view of the mirror frame slowly got taller. <br />
<br />
Breathing heavier and heavier, he felt his ass crack seal shut as the fur consumed his bottom. His legs jutted out slightly more into their final position, and went completely still. <br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t see his own ass end or his back, but he COULD see his nice flat chest and stomach. Tears began rolling down his face, as the brown plush pushed its way up towards his belly button. He felt himself beginning to bloat as his organs were slowly being replaced with cotton stuffing!<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, please, PLEEEASE!&quot; he was still yelling.<br />
<br />
His Betty button sealed shut as it had reached that point. His entire torso slowly but inexorably shrinking into a shorter and shorter stature as the brown fur spread upwards. Towards his chest.<br />
<br />
His voice was getting weaker and weaker. His breathing shallower. He could barely speak above a whisper, until he could no longer make any sound at all! His chest cavity began to fill out. His once-flat boyish chest began to plump out into a rounder shape. <br />
<br />
James could also no longer breath, which was disconcerting in itself. But he found he no longer NEEDED to breath!<br />
<br />
His mouth was still working. He was trying to scream out some more for help. To make it stop! But no sound could he issue! He was completely silenced like a good little teddy bear he was becoming. <br />
<br />
James also continued trying to move his arms and legs, and his fingerless fingers. But he was completely motionless. <br />
<br />
He continued shrinking down to his final size. The room reflected in the mirror looked HUUUUUGE! from down there! But he mostly was looking down at his teddy bear body that he couldn&#39;t believe was now his! Eyes dartimg back and forth at his motionless arms and legs. Arms and legs that, just a few moments before, were human with warm human skin, fingers, and toes! <br />
<br />
Until a force made his head lift up. He could no longer move his head! The brown stuffing moved up his neck. Thickened and shortened it! Now he was stuck staring at the mirror. At himself! He was in full-on panic mode as the oy thing he could move, was his mouth, eyes, and facial muscles. But that was soon to come to an end as well!<br />
<br />
His chin and face rounded out. Turning brown. His jaw seized up, and it shut of it&#39;s own accord! His sparkling blue eyes wide with fear as he felt his lips turn up into a smile. It started at both corners of his mouth, as his lips slowly disappeared into a simple black stitching of a line. Finally sealing the shut forever. <br />
<br />
His nose turned black, rounded out, and skrunk into a hard piece of plastic. His eyes still dartimg around frantically, tears streaming from the corners. His vision forcefully darted to the front, and there it stayed. He could no longer even control his own eyesight! <br />
<br />
His blue eyes darkened. Darkened. Blackened. One last year left his right eye, which quickly dried on his felt cheeks, just as they turned into hard little plastic round pieces. <br />
<br />
James was forced to sit there silently, and stare at the diminished form of a small child-sized teddy bear as his forehead rounded. His nice strawberry blond hair sucked in, replaced by that faux brown fur. And his ears migrated to the top of his head and finally rounded out! <br />
<br />
Everything went completely silent as the gas vents were switched off. James couldn&#39;t believe it! He was totally, 100% inanimate! Totally silent! He was stuck with a stupid smile on his face, and couldn&#39;t move even the slightest millimeter! All he could do, was just sit there on the floor with his rounded stubby arms strateched out in a round almost-hug shape, and stare through his black Brady plastic eyes! Nor even the hint of a heartbeat or breath inside his body. He didn&#39;t know what it was meant to be completely incapable of ever moving ever again! <br />
<br />
He wanted to panic. To scream. To yell. But his soft teddy body remained quiet and completely still. His mouth remained stubbornly shut. He heard the door to the chamber open, as the man who sold him this experience walked in. James wanted to quake in fear over that huge shadow looming over his tiny inconsequential form. He wanted to speak. To beg. But all he could do was sit and stare at his poor form in that mirror. <br />
<br />
The man bent over James and unceremoniously picked him up as if he were nothing more than....well....a teddy bear! With a dizzying flash, James forgot about his predicament for the moment as he saw a blur in the mirror of a teddy bear being roughly grasped and quickly lifted. The entire room spun around in a half hazard manner as he was carried in one hand by that man, holding him by an arm and being dangled at the man&#39;s side!<br />
<br />
Motion sickness set in. At least, in James&#39;s mind. He couldn&#39;t make sense of anything as he was swung back and forth, far above the ground. He was terrified of heights, and here he was. A good four or five feet above the ground which may as well have been 50 feet to a small teddy. But the ground was only visible for a moment at a time as he was swinging back and forth, seeing blurs of the walls, ceiling, and ground in a terribly confusing mess. It made it even worse that he couldn&#39;t fix his gaze on anything at all. His eyesight was completely rooted and fixed to a single point. Like a pigeon&#39;s. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s why pidgeons have to &quot;bob&quot; their heads when they walk. It isn&#39;t that their heads are bobbing at all. It&#39;s that their bodies are moving while their heads stay still for a moment. It&#39;s the only way they can fixate their gaze. They don&#39;t have the fine motor control over their eyeballs like humans do. Well, James has ZERO control over his eyes,. Over his entire brown-furred bear-like stuffed body for that matter. He can&#39;t even allow his head to remain still like a pigeon can! So his view is mostly a blur where he can only see a wall, the ceiling, or the long 4 foot drop to the floor for just a single moment at a time whenever that man&#39;s arm stops moving forward or backward for a moment before swinging back the other way.<br />
<br />
The entire time James was trying to yell &quot;STOP!&quot; Or &quot;put me down!&quot; But his stuffed organless body just trapped those words in silence in his own mind <br />
<br />
Finally. FINALLY! With the softest of soft &quot;thumps&quot; that was more a vibration in his body than an actual noise, the man had plopped poor James the teddy bear down on a counter. Trying to turn and look around, all he could do was stare straight ahead. He could see the stupid stumps of the ends of his &quot;arms&quot; and &quot;legs,&quot; and that it. Beyond that, he was staring straight at that man&#39;s jean-covered crotch directly in front of him! <br />
<br />
Fearing the worst, he couldn&#39;t even so much as wimper! He was totally at the mercy of this man! <br />
<br />
He saw his crotch moving back and forth directly in front of him, while he could hear some rooting around around him on this desk or table top or whatever he was sitting upon. He tried ever so desperately to look around. To move his head. Even shift his gaze even the slightest bit. But no. He was utterly without the slightest bit of motion! His teddy bear body steadfastly refusing to cooperate with his mind. He would have had better luck moving a soda can with his mind, than he did moving anything at all on his own body! He was every bit an object as a soda can!<br />
<br />
After a bit, the man apparently found what he was apparently looking for. The rooting around noises were him trying to find certain tools of his. James heard the the clicking of buttons. The distinct scratchy/hummy sound of a printer. Suddenly, his entire world randomly flipped. <br />
<br />
In a quick blur, he went from seeing the man&#39;s jean-clad crotch beyond his stubby brown furred arms and legs, to seeing the ceiling of a back room beyond his stubby brown-furred arms and legs. He saw the forehead, the face and eyes of the man. His hands then came into view. They were holding something. It looked like...like....a sort of a stapler-type thing. The man grabbed James&#39; left stub of a foot. He felt pressure as he squeezed and punched a small corner of the felt fabric. What the hell was he doing!? <br />
<br />
He took the odd instrument in his hand, slid a small little corner piece of his foot into it. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no, no!!&quot; James wanted to yell. Was he going to torture the poor teen-minded teddy bear!? <br />
<br />
With a &quot;wince,&quot; (a mental one, not a physical wince,) James heard the instrument &quot;CLICK!&quot; He heardit. He felt a bit of pressure. But no pain at all registered. Still stuck staring in that exact same direction, the man&#39;s face disappeared from view. James was stuck staring at the grimy back room-like ceiling beyond the reach of his stubby arms and legs. The last thing he saw of the man before he disappeared from view, was his fingers letting go of something that he apparently attached to his toeless rounded left leg. <br />
<br />
A tag! A price tag! A price tag attached to one of them plastic ring thingies that were impossible to break without a knife or scissors. The plastic thingies that puts holes in brand new fabric things like socks, and ruins them if you try hanging it off by hand! The price tag that said &quot;$12.99&quot; with a barcode!  A price tag! $12.99!? He wasn&#39;t even worth 13 bucks! At least, not before taxes! His brand new price tag settled into place, hanging from his left brown foot directly in his view! <br />
<br />
James was stuck staring directly at the price he would be sold at as an object in this store! But luckily it wasn&#39;t for long.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he was roughly grabbed around the middle by large human hands. Once again, the world was all a blur of motion where he couldn&#39;t see anything due to the lack of control over his vision. With no time to think with this strange vortex of blurs, James felt himself finally come to rest. On a shelf!<br />
<br />
It was one of those random knick-knack stores that had various tables and shelves with various objects for sale. The she he landed on, was a mind-numbing 5 and a half feet off the ground! And before him, beyond his stubby arms and legs across a vast distance of ten whole feet, was a random shelf with a back mirror. Jeff could barely make out the teddy bear image that was apparently him, among a littany of random objects. As the man turned to walk away, for a terrifying moment where he thought he was going to fall that entire 5.5 feet to the ground, James felt himself slide sideways as the world slightly tilted up. He didn&#39;t tilt sideways too much. Just enough to put the world at an odd angle from which he was incapable of righting. And there, staring at him, was his price tag that swung back around into his vision. $12.99!</p>
