<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob followed several boys into a tent. All young and full of vigor. Quite the contrast to his current <br />
situation.<br />
<br />
As he sat down in a seat in the darkened tent he saw a glow coming from the table in the center of the tent. <br />
In a flash, temporarily blinding the audience, a robed figure appeared next to the table. <br />
<br />
I guess you all are wondering why I called you here.<br />
<br />
Jacob's brow furrowed. I wasn't called here he said to himself. He heard a muttered similar statement come <br />
from the mouths of people near him.<br />
<br />
Oh yes I did. You may not realize it but the reason you decided to come here today was all my doing.<br />
<br />
Jacob thought about getting up but it was like a car wreck he just had to watch.<br />
<br />
You sir. The cloaked man pointed at an older gentleman similar to Jacob. You were just released from your <br />
position were you not.<br />
<br />
Uh yes. How did you know.<br />
<br />
I know all. I see all.<br />
<br />
And you young man. What's your name boy.<br />
<br />
Peter Carlson.<br />
<br />
The older man twisted so quickly. Wondering if that was the son of his former employer.<br />
<br />
Yes you guessed it. Could you two come up here.<br />
<br />
They stepped up on stage, unable to resist.<br />
<br />
Now young man. You are the apple of your father's eye are you not? The boy blushed. And you sir have been <br />
wronged by this young man's father. The older man shook his head. Fine. So wouldn't you like to get revenge on <br />
Mr. Carlson?<br />
<br />
His father yes but I have nothing against this boy.<br />
<br />
I know. But these men live so vicariously through their children the only way to get back at them is through <br />
their children.<br />
<br />
But I don't want that.<br />
<br />
I think deep down you do. As the cloaked man placed a bony hand on each man's shoulder a glow seemed to <br />
enveloped the two. Jacob couldn't tell if there was some sort of chant expressed but he was mesmerized. When <br />
the glow dissipated the older man was now a man of 30 and the boy was into his early 40's. The older man was <br />
nice an buff and in the prime of his second life. Peter Carlson was now showing the middle age spread. That <br />
spread that would have normally shown on his body as he grew older but enhanced with the spread that was from <br />
the former older man's body.<br />
<br />
A similar scene happened over and over. The changed people were dismissed as they were altered and sent home.<br />
<br />
Now there weren't too many women in the audience but the few that there were had similar changes. There was <br />
one woman, a very busty woman and not very old, was sitting in her chair waiting her change. When she was <br />
called up to the stage everyone looked around for a young girl, as was the occurrence with the other previous <br />
women. But a boy was called up. He had a beefy football player build. As they were changed she became a slim <br />
woman that swam in the over sized clothes that she had come in with. He on the other hand had developed man <br />
breasts. Wrapping around his back. His belly and love handles widened. But it was his hips that seemed to have <br />
to most change. They were now what you would call breeder hips. His pants had to be held up by one hand but <br />
fortunately for him he was wearing boxers that were stretched to the max but remained on him. As he stepped <br />
off the stage he walked with a new sway in his hips. He even seemed to be flirting with a few of the men on <br />
his way out. <br />
<br />
When it got to Jacob he was on stage with a young boy. Someone in his teens. As the changes occurred Jacob <br />
became his once hansom self. Settling in on a mid 20's. The poor boy however was now in his mid 50's older <br />
than his father. And having been into video games his body showed the ravages of little to now exercise for <br />
his 50 some years of game play. His face was pock marked from the zits he contended with all his life. The <br />
junk food rounded him out nicely. This was a change for him. He was a slim boy when he came in. There was not <br />
a single thing that fit him when he was ready to step off the stage. There was an attendant that got a bit of <br />
tent material and wrapped it around him as he sent him off home to his father. Jacob was a bit chubby when he <br />
was in his 60's but in fairly good shape for a man his age. Now he was almost Greek god in nature. Jacob felt <br />
saddened for the boy but then he caught sight of himself in the mirror and his narcissistic nature got the <br />
best of him and he forgot all concern for the boy.<br />
<br />
As he left the tent happy with his change there were still dozen's of others in the audience and it seemed as <br />
though more were coming in.</p>
