<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Life was horrible for Kim Roberts, she had though dealing with high school was bad and she had finally gotten past it when she headed to college, she was wrong. She was never popular in her high school; she had become the favorite target for the gang of popular girls which ruled the school. They where the tall, skinny cheerleader/athletic types and ruled the social scene of the school. She was a short and plump and fit into either the goth or maybe emo type depending on the day and her mood. They all had long hair and perfect makeup to go with their designer cloths, she got hand me downs from her older sister because her family couldn’t afford new cloths for her and makeup was out of the question. One of the bully’s had wrecked three cars in two years with her parents buying a new car each time, she had to ride the bus as a senior because they only had one car in their family. They had every boy at their school wrapped around their fingers or having wet dreams about them at night, she couldn&#39;t get a date to save her life. They where totally different they should have paid her no mind, she should have faded into the background, not even to be remembered if she was noticed at all.<br />
<br />
Only they did, if there was one thing that made her happy it was her art, yes it fit the stereotype of the emo/goth girl artist, but she didn’t care she loved her art and she was good at it. So good she won an award for it in her freshman year, little did she know one of the girls who would be soon her bully was also an Artist and didn’t like being shown up by her. So she became a favorite target of all girls for the entire four years of high school. She had dealt with the bullying, the constant put downs, the threats and even the three actually attacks on her in the bathroom. Her art had won her a scholarship which allowed her to leave for college, she thought she would be free of them. <br />
<br />
Until she discovered that not only had all six of her bullies were going to the same college as her, but all six of them would be on the same floor as her and one of them, the ring leader who was the worse of them all, Lisa was actually her roommate. On their first day of classes, Lisa had turned off her alarm so she missed her first class, and it only got worse. Many of nights she would have to sit in the common room all night because Lisa had brought home a guy or in one case two guys and she wasn&#39;t allowed to come in. She would have to deal with them for another four years, one live with them as well. She couldn’t take it, she was on the edge. Then she heard of the Monster Virus, once it was confirmed by the news to be real she actually prayed to get it. So that she would become a monster and so could use claws or whatever horrible monster ability she would get to destroy those who made her life hell. <br />
<br />
Her prayers where answered and she came down with the virus, now it was a two step process once the virus was confirmed it took another round of tests to discover what a person was becoming. It normally took a few days to run all the tests and during that time she had been imagining what she would become. A strong cat person to tear her enemies apart, a dragon to bath them in fire and other ways to get revenge all filled her mind. She could become a monster, destroy them and then everyone would blame the Monster Virus, it had happened in the news a farmer turned into a mindless werewolf ripped the arm off of his own wife and had to be locked away like an animal. That made national news, she could do the same…she imagined she could do it, but deep down she wasn’t sure if she could do anything like that. She had cried for a week after the bus she was on ran over a squirrel, she hadn’t even seen it someone had just told her about it and she cried over the squirrel. No she couldn’t kill a person, well at least as a human. Maybe if she became a monster, she could scare them away and she would not have to deal with the bullies anymore.<br />
<br />
She was deep in though when the doctor returned carrying a binder with her results and another larger binder with information about what she was about to become.<br />
<br />
“Well what is the news?” said Kim as the doctor sat down across from her and slide the binder over to her, she looked down at the cover and saw.....</p>
