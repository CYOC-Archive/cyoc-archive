<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joan moaned as she slipped her hands around James’ body, pulling her son around and into her arms. Her right arm draped across his breasts, simultaneously coating her arm in the remnants of James’ orgasm. Joan didn’t even flinch. She held him close for a moment, her cock receding from her sons ass, a comical pop was heard as it finally came loose. Her eyes scanned the gap between them nervously, finally spying something of note - James’ new vagina.<br />
<br />
James sat there in silence, still processing the events. His heart was pounding, his cock still twitching at the thought of it all. He loved it, as much as it shamed him. To surrender like that, to be on all fours and have someone else penetrate you, to have that much control over you. He shivered, pushing the admission down into his mind. “No!” It screamed, fighting these new feelings that his own Mother had forced awake inside him.<br />
<br />
Joan could sense the conflict within him, gently stroking his side as she broke the silence between them. “Are you okay, honey?” She asked, the sentence leaving her mouth with an almost innocent oblivion. It only served to sour James’ mood.<br />
<br />
“No!” He spat back, flicking her arm off of him. “I’m not okay! I… I didn’t want that…” He asserted, making sure his mother understood his serious tone. But he still didn’t move. “I mean, I don’t…” The conflicted James continued as Joan took her time to respond.<br />
<br />
“I’m Sorry James” She said with a tone that was almost apologetic. “After seeing something this afternoon… I should tell you. Your father and sister…” She began trailing off, hoping to pin this on them, to spin the story so James’ would be on her side. But James cut her off. “You don’t need to tell me. I saw you. Watching them. Cheering even! Why are you doing this to us?!”. HIs heart rate spiked as he confronted her.<br />
<br />
“N-No!” Joan stuttered, quickly composing herself. She would need to think on her feet here. “You don’t understand… Your Father… He made a mistake and said an animal… He’s… He’s going to be a cow like your sister.” She said, her voice laced with sadness. “It happened this morning. It was so sudden, but the two of them… It was like the Cabin wanted them to be together.” Joan paused to take in her story, it almost sounded believable. <br />
<br />
“What you saw… I was cheering because I was… Happy for them.” Joan struggled to get that last part out. ‘Happy’ - LIke she could be happy at Henry’s betrayal, Jess her own daughter would steal Henry away from her. “I- Gave them my blessing, and left them to their devices.” She finally spat out, falling silent, hoping that James would believe her.<br />
<br />
The silence hung between them for a few moments more. James’ mouth hung agape. He couldn’t believe that their Father had finally fallen victim to the cabin. He was so diligent. Of all the things he could have said, to wind up like Jess... “Christ…” was all he could muster. <br />
<br />
Joan finally breathed. He’d bought it.<br />
<br />
“I was just sooo horny…” She mumbled seductively, her voice taking on a more sultry tone now. “I could smell you… And you were just lying there. You reacted so naturally, I thought you wanted it…” She continued, hoping to get James to open up. “You called me something actually. What was it, Dakota? Given how you acted… I take it she’s not one of Mellissa’s friends?”<br />
<br />
James heart went aflutter, a sensation that he did his best to stifle. He let out a light cough, trying to calm himself down from an already overstated reaction. “I… I said Dakota?” He asked, his mind running back to the scenes that were playing out before he realised who was actually fucking him. He DID think it was her. James fell silent as Joan tried again. <br />
<br />
“It’s okay Honey, you can tell me anything” She said, placing her arm back onto his as she gave it a loving stroke, the anger inside him having subsided as the emotions he tried so hard to bury came to the surface. James swallowed, his heart pounding in his ears as he opened his mouth to speak. “She’s…. She’s this donkey I met in the woods.” James said, the words came out of his mouth so quickly they were almost impossible to decipher.<br />
<br />
“A… Donkey?!” Joan said, taken aback. She was surprised. She thought that she had James all to herself, but now there was this wild animal vying for his attention? Joan blew air through her nostrils, thinking about an outsider made her mad, irrationally so. But she quickly regained her composure, encouraging her son to continue.<br />
<br />
“I met her in the woods…. She was like you… She had… Both, parts.” He mumbled, clearly embarrassed, but still he continued. “The first time was an accident, I’d hit my head and she took advantage of me. I couldn’t help myself. But the second time… I wanted to… submit myself. I was so close to doing it too, but she turned away before I could… Afterwards I found that I had these.” He took his breasts in his hands, cupping them and giving them a wiggle. I’m worried that I’m becoming a girl! I’ve never thought like that before! But it feels so good! I can’t help myself” James exclaimed, burying his face in his hands. <br />
<br />
Joan took a moment, pulling her son tight and giving him a hug. “It’s okay.” She whispered. “I know how it feels. Having both, it’s… confusing. The hormones I imagine. I’m still not used to the sensations I get, the urges I have. My best advice is to not fight them… It makes it harder. Just listen to your body. I feel so much better since I started. You and your pussy will be best friends before you know it.” She said, kissing him on the back of the head.<br />
<br />
“Wait. Pussy?!” James exclaimed, finally pulling away from joan as hey lay on his back, his fingers darting beneath his testicles as he traced his taint. HIs eyes immediately grew wide as his fingers graced something wet, two distinctive lips that parted the more pressure he applied. A small moan escaped his lips before he pulled his hand free, looking back at his mother, horrified. “Oh my god, I am becoming a girl….” He muttered, looking blankly at Joan. <br />
<br />
“What did I tell you! Don’t let it affect you. It doesn’t matter what you think you are in this place. I’ve learnt that much already. The more you fight it the harder it becomes. Just don’t stress, let your instincts take over.” She said sternly, rubbing her flaccid member. “You’ll get used to it. Trust me” Joan pulled back from her son, instead pulling herself up and off the bed.<br />
<br />
“You should sleep on it. You’ll feel better tomorrow. Don’t worry about what the others will think, your father will be more than embarrassed as it is. Just make sure you feel comfortable leaving.”<br />
<br />
James nodded as Joan smiled. She turned, her ass jiggling as she waltzed to the door. A spring in her step.James collapsed back on the bed, finally undisturbed, he went to sleep once more, his dreams filling with recollections of the evening and thoughts of Dakota.</p>
