<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think I&#39;d like to.... invite my friends over.&quot; Mike said sounding a bit unsure. <br />
<br />
Jeff quickly picked up on his father&#39;s hesitation and asked &quot;Dad I won&#39;t judge, just tell me what you want and i can make it a reality with the Chronivac.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mike seem to regain some level of confidence, but still seem hesitant. Eventually Mike pulled himself together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff what I&#39;m about to say ask for doesn&#39;t leaves this room got it. No telling your mother or little sister.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff nodded knowing how much trust his father is putting on him. <br />
<br />
Mike to a deep breath in and began to explain want he wanted to use the Chronivac for. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff I would like to turn myself and my friends into strippers, but not any ordinary strippers I want to have us change into who or want we would want as our first harem member. If that makes sense to you?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff thought about it and believed he understood.  &quot;So you want me to turn you into the women, fictional or otherwise that you dream of?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike made a motion that indicated that was more or less what he wanted.  He then continued with &quot;Let me use the Chronivac to set things up and you can watch the result, how about that instead?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff saw no reason to deny his father so he accepted and got off from his computer chair stood nearby to see the changes his dad would make. <br />
<br />
Mike got on the Chronivac and made the preliminary changes to set up things before he invites his friends over. <br />
<br />
Jeff read the changes made: 1: Mike friends will believe that Jeff&#39;s room is the living room till they leave.<br />
2: Jeff will be invisible to them for the time in Jeff&#39;s room. <br />
3: They will answer Mike&#39;s question like they were back in highschool.<br />
<br />
With that set up Mike invited his 4 friends over. <br />
<br />
Some time passed and Mike&#39;s 4 friends arrived. Gabriel was the first followed by Brad then Luke and lastly Kyle.<br />
<br />
They entered Jeff&#39;s room and Mike sat at the Chronivac while his friends sat on some chairs Mike had brought up. Mike spent some time talking with his friends, loosening them up with some beers and making them remember their highschool days. After some time Mike posed the question that will change their lives.<br />
<br />
&quot;So guys, who would be the first person you would have in your harem? It can be any one and any thing.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gabriel answered first &quot;A succubus of course.&quot; <br />
<br />
Brad laughed &quot;Of course you would say that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh ya then who would you have Brad.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Easy I would have a dumb ass slutty bimbo as the first member&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pffft and you criticize me for saying a succubus.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya well a dumb bimbo would be easy to deal with and she would have nice large tits, ass and a perfect hourglass figure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A succubus is ten times better, she would be a master of sex, can easily shape shift to have a better figure then your bimbo and be smart to boot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Gabriel and Brad could argue more Luke piped up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would have a fantasy elf princess&quot;<br />
<br />
The moment those left his mouth Gabriel and Brad stopped arguring with each other to dogpile on Luke&#39;s choice. <br />
<br />
Jeff watched as his dad put the descriptions of their fantasy lovers into the Chronivac, knowing full well that they will be turning into the women they say.<br />
<br />
Kyle spoked up after some time once Gabriel and Brad ran out of some steam to argue. &quot;I would love to have cosplayer as the first member.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle immediately got hammered for his choice, since it was completely normal compared to everyone else, even when put up against Brad&#39;s bimbo choice, since his description of the bimbo is incredibly unrealistic. <br />
<br />
Eventually everyone calmed down a bit before turning to Mike for his answer. <br />
<br />
Mike answered his own question &quot;I would like a tall woman with a nice third leg&quot; <br />
<br />
Everyone was confused by Mike&#39;s assertion of a third leg but they didn&#39;t get a chance to ask as Mike changed their history.<br />
<br />
Jeff witnessed Gabriel become Gabriella the succubus stripper: Gabriella had the biggest tits at I-cups, the largest ass, and the curviest body. The only thing that made it clear she was a succubus was the horns on her head, the long thin flexible tail the ended in a spade coming from the base of her spine just above her ass and the large pair of bat like wings coming from her shoulder blades.<br />
<br />
Gabriella excused her self to go to the washroom to use her magic to change into something more fitting for their night out.<br />
<br />
Jeff realized his father was gonna go clubbing with his...her changed friends. Jeff was definitely curious to see what Gabriel will turn into. <br />
<br />
Jeff then saw Brad become the bimbo he had described. Brad became Betty the slutty bimbo stripper: He had blonde hair that reached his ass, H-cup tits, is 5&#39;4&quot; and a nice hourglass figure. She was wearing a pink micro skirt that did nothing to hide her pink panties that already had a small wet stain from her clear arousal, a see though crop-top and pink bra.  <br />
<br />
Jeff looked at Luke and saw him become Lucy a 5&#39;9&quot; tall elf with golden brown hair, C-cup tits, thin hips, long legs, and a regal bearing who apparently despite being a princess was a stripper.      <br />
<br />
Jeff turned to Kyle and saw him become Kylie the green hair cosplaying stripper with D-cup tits. She was pretty damn normal.   <br />
<br />
And lastly Jeff looked at his father and saw that Mike had become Mariel a 6&#39;0&quot; tall Herm stripper. Mariel&#39;s cock reached her knees and she was wearing sexy black mini dress. <br />
 <br />
Jeff peaked at the Chronivac to see changes that he would not be able to really see visually. He saw that Gabriella had the highest libido which made sense since she was a succubus, Betty was second which also made sense since she was a slutty bimbo, Kylie and Mariel had higher then average libidos, while Lucy was normal.<br />
<br />
Jeff also saw that Gabriella and Betty are Mariel&#39;s sex friends, with Gabriella now living with them. <br />
<br />
Mariel gave wink to Jeff. <br />
<br />
Jeff was unsure how to truly feel, but with how hard his cock was it was hard to think of much else.</p>
