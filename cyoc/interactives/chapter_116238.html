<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You woke up the next morning, and looked around thinking that everything up until that point was just a bad dream, but (of course) it was all real. You were still a pregnant dragoness sitting in a giant cage with humongous breasts, and a gut that was comparable to a yoga ball. You couldn&#39;t help but wimper at the sight of yourself again, but somehow found your gut, and breasts enjoyable in a way. You then saw the witch at the entrance to the cage talking to a navy blue dragon, a male dragon, and although they are at least 25 yards away from you, you could hear the conversation as if they were standing beside you.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re sure that she already doesn&#39;t have a mate?&quot; The dragon asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I thought I already explained what I did. She is pregnant with non-fertile eggs, or in simple terms she bears eggs that contain no hatchlings. It&#39;s a special enchantment I gave her, but considering the situation that I put her in, as you can see, I can&#39;t help but to pity her.&quot; The witch said <br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m going to have to wait then.&quot; The dragon said<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I have an enchantment for that as well, and I have a feeling you both are going to get along nicely. She is my familiar so I intend to enforce that.&quot; The witch said <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa whoa now, no need to be so strict on the young lady she&#39;s already pregnant because of you. So what&#39;s her name exactly?&quot; The dragon asked<br />
<br />
&quot;She doesn&#39;t have one yet, but I&#39;ve been trying to come up with one myself, and I think I have one. Remember familiars are name by their masters, or mistresses.&quot; The witch said <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah yeah whatever you say, just don&#39;t make it one that&#39;s humiliating. Us dragons take pride in most everything around us from our kills to our family. Besides you shouldn&#39;t be so rough on her, and as they always say it&#39;s rude to talk about someone who&#39;s listening to the conversation, and us dragons have superior hearing to you human types.&quot; The dragon said looking at you, and the witch turned to look at you as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting, even I seem to be learning more and more about your species. Shall the two of you get acquainted with each other?&quot; The witch asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not? She&#39;s been listening in for a good while too, you go first, and I shall follow.&quot; The dragon said <br />
<br />
You then saw the cage door open, and the witch approached you, and the dragon followed shortly behind her. The witch stopped in front of you and paused looking at your body, and spoke,&quot;Greetings, Amber, I hope you like the name it fits your scales. I assume you would like to know who I have with me, or were you listening to that as well?&quot; The witch asked<br />
<br />
&quot;She wasn&#39;t, I&#39;d know if she was, also apologies for butting in on the conversation.&quot; The dragon said <br />
<br />
The witch paused and looked at the dragon, but then turned back to you and continued,&quot;Right, anyways I thought about what you said last night about giving birth to empty eggs, and I figured that you were right for the most part. So I brought you a solution to your problem, and you won&#39;t need to be worrying about what I said about the milking. I&#39;ll undo the enchantment, and let you know that you will still lay the eggs you have, but they can become fertile if your new friend here wants to. Anyways I&#39;ll let you two get to know each other thoroughly, and I&#39;ll let him explain the rest.&quot; The witch said waving her hand, and a green light appeared at the palm. The witch then snapped her finger and teleported to the cage door, and closing it, and left the area.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm,&quot; the dragon said walking up to your belly, and sniffing at it, and then did the same to your teats, and you felt them become erect. &quot;Ooo, you&#39;re pheromones are of a wonderful scent, but let&#39;s not rush to conclusions before we meet. Anyways Amber, my name is Cobalt, and your &quot;master&quot; has offered me an opportunity with you. You see that we&#39;re roughly the same age, and your body is in an interesting state right now. Anyways you will be happy to hear that you will be more than a mate, and you should consider yourself something as a bride to me.&quot; The dragon, Cobalt said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh..what?&quot; You asked wimpering<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please don&#39;t feel so stressed out my love, for I have been waiting for an opportunity like this for awhile, and I don&#39;t intend to lose you. So please before it&#39;s too late, embrace me as your equal partner, your mate, your husband as humans put it, my bride.&quot; Cobalt said nuzzling against your muzzle and breasts gently. You blushed flattered from him, and he stood in front of you, and you smiled. Your instincts kicked in seconds later, and you sniffed Cobalt&#39;s chest, head, and stomach. You caught wind of a strong scent that was giving you really odd feelings for Cobalt, like he was male, strong, proud, and broad. The scent also gave you urges to mate with Cobalt, and you felt anxious to do so, and you also noticed that the scent was coming from between Cobalts legs.<br />
<br />
You pause, and watched as Cobalt&#39;s dick unsheathed from his legs, and were shocked to see that he had two dicks, and both large and throbbing. Cobalt blushed embarrassed, but you responded by nuzzling him again, and then felt a hoysensation between your hind legs. &quot;Sorry for the stress, it&#39;s just everything is happening so fast for me, but thank you for the offer. Go ahead now Cobalt, we both know how much we yearn for each other&#39;s sex now.&quot; You said and instinctively licked Cobalt&#39;s muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you slutty dirty dragoness, if that&#39;s how you want it then I don&#39;t mind being the fucker here. Just as a warning though, I won&#39;t go easy on you just because your pregnant.&quot; Cobalt said smiling and walked around to position himself to your rear.<br />
<br />
You stood up the best you could, and braced yourself for what you were about to experience, and wondered if your breasts would help you support yourself. Suddenly you felt something penetrate your vagina lips, and felt Cobalt mount on top of you. You roared almost immediately orgasming from your heat, and Cobalt did too shortly after. Cobalt then began thrusting into you over and over again, and the two of you roared, moaned, and growled from pleasure each and every time. Cobalt then reached down with his head, and you saw his forked tongue wrap around one of your teats slowly, and lick it as you let out a low growl in pleasure. Cobalt then thrusted into more, and for about 6 times, and orgasmed for each time he did, as did you. Each time Cobalt orgasmed you felt his seed spray into your body from both of his dicks, and you loved it.<br />
<br />
Cobalt then pulled out of your wet pussy, and you noticed he was laying on his side, and cum dripped from his cocks. You then instinctively lied down next to his cocks, and began licking the semen for his members causing him to moan softly, and cum some more. You then went a step further and took both cocks into your mouth, and licking the cum from them joyfully, as if you wanted more with each drop. You then began sucking his cocks and Cobalt cummed again, and you thought of taking his dicks out of your mouth, but the taste of his cum was so good, and it felt so right to you, until something clicked in your mind, about what you were doing and you stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had the same thoughts, and now we&#39;re officially mates. And uh, just between the both of us let&#39;s just agree to say that you weren&#39;t pregnant when we did this.&quot; Cobalt said<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal, but...did we actually do that? I don&#39;t know if we should have, but it felt so good, so incredible, and just so...right.&quot; You said trying hard to find words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly, it&#39;s in our blood, we know what to do, and we know how to do it, but our minds fall to our barbaric instincts for mating, and despite our intellect we obey them and accept them as dragons. Ultimately our reward is now within you, and thanks to our little friend, or your master, we can use this lair as our own. She says that we can and she will move, and in return she doesn&#39;t wish to see us, or you again claiming you were useless like this, and a liability ultimately. However, I look into your eyes and see the opposite in my case, and many must consider that a dragon, and dragon relationship is much different than a human and dragon relationship.&quot; Cobalt said <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I do admit that I was asking a lot of questions, but only because I was confused, and didn&#39;t understand the situation. But am I still bound to her? My &quot;master&quot; as you put it.&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see real quick,&quot; Cobalt said placing his foreclaw on your head, and a light appeared under it. &quot;It appears that you are no longer bound to her, and are living the life of what you are now, which means that you should lay down, and wait. I don&#39;t know how long this pregnancy will last considering the fact that it was magic that did this, but in the meantime I can hunt, and provide for you. After that we can learn about each other, and don&#39;t worry about your past, what only concerns me now is the present. So now...<br />
<br />
(I decided to go all routes with this one, good because &quot;you&quot; meet someone you love, an are allegedly free. Neutral because you are still pregnant, and bad because you may still be bound, and/or your new mate may not be as trustworthy as he seems.)</p>
