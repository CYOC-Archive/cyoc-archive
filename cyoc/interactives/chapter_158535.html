<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joan pulled out with a smile on her face. What a day! So much has been achieved, having sex with James was the icing on the cake. She secretly hoped it was him. Jess would have resisted. Henry hated her smell, plus probably hated her too. Her son. Her beautiful son was a gift bestowed by the heavens. Even now she gazed at him. Sitting down on the bed, Joan looked at James who was still whimpering. Laying down on his stomach. Joan had a nice view of his butt. It got larger, she could tell. Horse tail was limp like his own body.<br />
<br />
Using his arms, James pushed himself up. He was so close to falling asleep, but he couldn&#39;t! Not yet. Now on all fours, realizing he was giving Joan a huge show twisted his body around. Now he sat on the bed also, staring face to face with Joan. James got a good look at her. That hair, her new goat ears that flopped down beside her face. Eyes looking downward..... Breasts! His mind could look at nothing else. How many times has he seen them in his life. Only when he was a baby, especially this close up. It was so taboo. Sons rarely ever see their own mothers breasts when they become a teen or older. Seeing them was like uncovering a huge secret that James was never supposed to find.<br />
<br />
&quot;James look up please&quot;, Joan had a sinister look on her face as she said this. Gesturing her finger to look up. Joan was toying with the young man, but was also very flattered. Henry never seemed to be attracted to her at all. Being eyed sexually made her feel so happy. He was truly her kin.<br />
<br />
Blushing, James looked up at Joan. He should be pissed off right now. Yet his mother was so attractive, clouding his own judgement.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like these don&#39;t you?&quot;, Joan fondled her own breasts in reaction to what she said. It was like tickling yourself how it doesn&#39;t feel that special when you do it, but when someone else tickles you it makes your body go crazy. Touching her own breasts did nothing for her. James was getting the show of his life. That&#39;s all that was important. <br />
<br />
&quot;...Ya....&quot;, James muttered this quitely. He felt controlled by her own actions. Wanting to embrace her, James was about to make his move. Joan was quicker as she got within arms distance from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;These are new?&quot;, Joan spoke this like a question. Now Joan was the one mesmerized by breasts. &quot;Wow they&#39;re the same size as mine&quot;, she muttered this loudly enough for James to hear. Nipples were black? This oddly turned Joan on even more. Why they were black was a question that didn&#39;t need answering. Just seeing them hardened her cock. Now gazing up to James&#39;s eyes, she had a question for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is Dakota?&quot;, Pressing her body closer, she needed this knowledge. Whatever could help her plot against the two cows was worth it. Being questioned so much made James&#39;s head spin. Thinking of something to say, only the word donkey came out. It was just one word, and yet Joan pieced together everything. Her first sexual encounter was sparked by a donkey the first night. Could it be a coincidence? Of course not. James was also becoming a horse, so perhaps this donkey took a particular interest in her son. What about his breasts? Or the vagina that she just drove her pudgy cock into? That donkey was very much a male when she encountered it. Could this donkey&#39;s own lust be changing James, making his body react and change to it&#39;s own liking? James could have had any transformation, but he gets two huge feminine changes since interacting with Dakota. &quot;Does this mean if I lusted for Henry to become a woman, and fucked him with my penis... I could in a round-about way influence his next change?&quot;. Joan was beginning to understand the rules and how the curse worked. That&#39;s probably why Jess hasn&#39;t gotten a dick yet. Jess has no interest in becoming a bull. No one fucking her wants it to happen either. Henry would never want her to become some masculine cow.<br />
<br />
This knowledge, how could she use this..... <br />
<br />
Out of her own thoughts, Joan lightly poked her sons boobs. Seeing how the fat vibrated and reacted to her touch made her giddy. James didn&#39;t know what was happening as Joan had sat for like one minute before she started touching his breasts. HIS BREASTS! This was so crazy. He could barely recognize this, let alone his vagina.<br />
<br />
Joan continued groping these twin sisters. Never in her life has she been this attracted to boobies before. The way they felt in her hands, black nipples hardening. For James there was no insane pleasure from this, no cabin influencing. Just a milf feeling and touching his breasts. His horse penis was now erect.<br />
<br />
Joan decided she was done toying with James. She didn&#39;t want this to escalate any further. Pulling her hands away, the woman had an idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw you earlier hiding behind a bush. You must already know everything about the cows..&quot;, Joan was now blunt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why not join forces? Maybe we can even be mates?&quot;, Joan left this open ended, but a part of her knew what his answer would be. She was jealous of Jess and Henry&#39;s relationship. Why couldn&#39;t they be like that?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot;, Now James was the one who was blunt. They were a family. Plotting against each other solves nothing. James now regained his composure, unleashing his emotions.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I just changed again....I love you mom, but fuck you. This is the second time you forced me to change. Do your plotting shit, but leave me out of it.&quot;, Silence filled the air. James swearing shocked Joan for a brief moment.<br />
<br />
Smiling again, it was like that&#39;s what Joan wanted to hear. Turning around, she walked towards the door. Tail fanning her own scent as she walked. She had one last thing to say. Her hand on the door knob. Joan stared away from James as she asked it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was the sex good?&quot;, She somehow forgot to ask this earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a pleasure I&#39;ve never felt in my entire life&quot;, James rushed this statement out as he was staring at Joans ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Remember, come to me if something ails you. Mommy will take care of you&quot;, Joan walked out the door, shutting it on her way out. The way he looked at her own breasts, it was like James was thirsty for her! The rejection and swearing did nothing to her, she liked that he was playing hard to get. With her naked back against the door, she thought about the knowledge that was learned. Already beginning to hatch a new scheme. Imagining her husband as some female fuck cow made her wet. This would be the ultimate plan, turning the man of the house into what Jess currently looks like. That was her goal. Would it work? Or would someone foil her plans? Guess she will find out one way or another!</p>
