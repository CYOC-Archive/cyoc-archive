<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Besides, you indeed have potential as a passionate motherly caretaker,&quot; the lizard said and you watched his eyes look down at your chest,&quot;One with a large bosom such as that would have trouble in the hunt but could also make a nice breeder too, it’s up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked down at yourself and blushed heavily once you saw the two large mounds jiggling from your chest. Each was the size of a basketball and looked fully firm too. Looking down beyond your breasts you saw your wide child bearing hips, and plump round ass to match. Then there was the tender sensitive slit between your legs, and a certain empty feeling between your thighs was now realized as you gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m female?! How?! Why?! When did this happen?!&quot; You thought to yourself as you overlooked your slender curvy body. You had mustard yellow scales covering every part of your body except for your front torso and inner thighs, which were covered with caramel brown scales. You immediately covered your breasts with your arm, and you saw your tail curl around your legs in humiliation so you grabbed it and pulled it up to cover your nethers. <br />
<br />
You then looked up and saw various male lizardfolk laughing when you did this, and the large one in front of you chuckled too. &quot;Didn’t realize you were that exposed huh? Have to say I haven&#39;t seen a woman as squeamish as you around here in a long time,&quot; the large male lizard chuckled as you just stood there with an embarrassed look on your face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I... y-you....&quot; You muttered then the large male placed his hand on your shoulder and said,&quot;Don’t worry, you certainly aren’t the first there miss. All that young blood in you has given you some spunk that’s for sure, we could use that a bit more here to be honest in our ladies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Hold on I-I didn’t agree to any of this,&quot; You replied then the male frowned and gave you a stern look and said,&quot;Alright, we can just as easily leave you out here all alone and nude to be killed or raped by some passing raiding party. Now, how does that sound to you there missy?&quot;<br />
<br />
You opened your mouth but held your tongue and bit your lip as you were about to retort. However this stranger certainly wasn’t wrong, and where were you to argue against him? You had no idea where you were, what you were, or even how this happened. You hated to admit it, but at least if you accepted this thing&#39;s offer then you could calm down and collect yourself while you tried to figure this out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay okay, you win,&quot; You replied and looked the large male in the eyes and said,&quot;I don’t have much of a choice the more I think about it anyways, do I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh there’s always a choice miss, either brave the wilderness or stay safe and help out,&quot; The large lizard laughed and patted your shoulder,&quot;Although one’s far more dangerous than the other, and risky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I’ll play it safe then, so...&quot; You paused and let out a sigh of defeat,&quot;I’ll be a caretaker or whatever, though I’m not sure how well I’ll do.&quot;<br />
<br />
The large male nodded then smiled at you and said,&quot;I’ll take you where you need to go then, our elders can enlighten you the rest of the details. For now though...&quot; The large male walked to your side and brought his hand around your back and said,&quot;Welcome to the tribe of Zjorn, here you shall be given a name, purpose, and for some even more than that. I am the chieftain of this tribe, but please just call me Kialor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Erm... o-okay...?&quot; You muttered and Kialor smiled and nudged you forward with his arm, so you began walking towards the tribe with him to you side and watching.<br />
<br />
Once you entered the small settlement with Kialor you looked around and saw people staring at you. Was it perhaps that you were new, young, attractive, and/or nude? In all honesty it was probably all of the above, but passed the small settlement you realized everything was much more than meets the eye. <br />
<br />
There were wooden bridges erected to traverse more easily through the swamp extended across gaps that were nothing but gooey mucky water and filth. There had to be at least 20 more tents beyond what you just saw, not to mention one that Kialor took you towards that was high up in the treetops with a rope bridge connected to the entrance front two ground posts.<br />
<br />
Two guards were at the base of this watching you made your way onto the rope bridge with hesitation. The wood was wet, and some of the boards looks rotten and weak. You looked back at Kialor and stopped after your foot made the board creek after the first step. &quot;Is th-this thing stable?&quot; You asked him and he paused and said,&quot;Boards get replaced every other week or so. If one breaks just keep a firm hold on the sides.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gulped, tightening your grip around the sides of the bridge before you started walking again. Kialor was right behind you too, and the ropes grew tight with the addition of your weight and his. The bridge swayed with each step you took, and it creeped with every step. You swore I’d you made it up and down this thing without dying you’d certainly have a fear of heights afterwards. But thankfully you made it to the top, where there was a small but with an actual door for an entrance.<br />
<br />
Kialor then stepped in front of you and said,&quot;This is our most eldest member, she lives here with her son who protects her. She’ll give you your name and she’ll tell you where to go. Her son will guide you from there, and I should mention that if anything were to happen while you’re inside then you’ll be gutted where you stand. But then again you don’t seem that naive, despite the surprising blow you did to me, speaking of which...&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched as Kialor wiped his nose with his large clawed hand, and he spread the blood out around to the tip of each of his fingers. &quot;What are you...&quot; You began then Kialor pressed his hand on your forehead, and you closed your eyes and a few seconds passed before he released it.<br />
<br />
You felt the scales across your long flat forehead feel cool, and your nostrils now smelled only blood after he did this. &quot;Wear that mark with pride, let it dry and harden and it it comes off then have someone paint a new one on,&quot; Kialor said then he smiled,&quot;Now you may enter.&quot;<br />
<br />
You took a deep breath and gulped, and watched as Kialor pushed the door open for you. You then slowly made your way inside, and you immediately noticed a young male sitting on some sort cot strung up on the walls. The male squinted at you, but then he saw Kialor and you almost saw him shrink as his eyes widened and he nodded to the chieftain. Kialor then slammed the door shut behind you, and it would’ve taken your tail if you hadn’t been holding it.<br />
<br />
After that moment you felt your heart jump, and as soon as you were able to calm down you saw the young male lizard looking up at you. He was small, maybe just barely in his early teenage years if you were to guess, and he only came up to your lower chest. He took especially notice to the mark on your forehead and peered closer for a moment. &quot;So, considering most females don’t have that mark on their head, and that fresh scent of blood with your own unfamiliar stench...&quot; the boy, whose scales were orange on his back and red down across his torso,&quot;You’re new, aren’t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded silently to the male not really sure what you should do. He saw the nervousness in your eyes and sighed,&quot;It’s okay to calm down, this tribe is your home now, though you need to visit my mother before to decide what we should do with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nodded to him and allowed yourself to breathe a sigh of relief and said,&quot;Thank you... you seriously don’t know how comforting that is to hear, but... who are you? You seem a bit... young.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Understandable considering how many people like you come to us, now follow me please miss,&quot; The boy explained then sighed,&quot;My name is Vol, as mother’s latest born I am tasked with her safety... and you aren’t the first to say that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, so... what now?&quot; You asked unsure if you should be asking a kid such a question sincerely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me, she’s just in the back,&quot; Vol exclaimed walking over to another door and knocking twice on it, and a moment passed before there came a single knock in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;She’s ready, just walk in and show your respect,&quot; Vol exclaimed and you paused and asked,&quot;Um... and how would I do that exactly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just do what I do, and just remain calm, some people are a bit freaked out by her but just let her do what she will with you,&quot; Vol exclaimed then he cracked the door open just a little bit, and he gestured for you to follow him in.<br />
<br />
You took a deep breath and sighed,&quot;Okay, let’s just get this over with...&quot; Then you slowly stepped into the room and you weren’t quite sure if you were prepared for what came next.<br />
<br />
You slowly pulled yourself inside, tail and all, and you watched as Vol closed the door behind you and walked towards the other end of the room. <br />
<br />
That’s when you saw the elder, and you were indeed surprised by what you saw. It was indeed an old looking female with all sorts of tribal jewelry all over her body. There were earrings on her horns, and one in her snout. She had a small skirt over her nethers, and a necklace made up of teeth, some of which looked somewhat human even, but mostly there were large canines of beasts. Her scales were green everywhere, but faded, and some even had fallen off and were scattered around the room. But one thing that was for sure was that she was blind, you could see the milky whiteness in her eyes that was almost eerie to look at. But that all just made you feel bad for her as she sat with a bunch of clay bowls in front of her filled with powdered materials of assorted colors.<br />
<br />
Vol approached the woman and sat down on his knees beside a large fur pelt of what looked like a deer in the center of the room. &quot;Mother,&quot; He said and she turned her head towards him and smiled slightly and spoke in the voice that sounded like gentle grandmother,&quot;Vol, my son, I smell the scent of blood...&quot;<br />
<br />
The old lady weakly laughed before breaking into a coughing fit, and you looked around to see burning incense, and candles lighting the room. The old lady took a moment to clear her throat after catching her breath and said,&quot;Tell me, are you one of Vol&#39;s friends, the chieftain himself, or someone else. Considering I smell his blood on you, and I’m not dead I assume you’re someone... uniquely deemed, come... show me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused and looked at Vol, who gestured towards deer rug beside him, and you made your way over to it and sat down on it, now mere inches from the woman. You inhaled about to speak, but then the elder put a finger over your mouth and said,&quot;Do not speak, allow me to discover you for myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
You blushed she said this, and then paused as she pulled your head closer and rubbed the blood on your forehead and sniffed it. &quot;Hm, a prideful male?&quot; She muttered then she licked her fingers clean and felt across your face and paused,&quot;Hmm... perhaps...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her hands found their way to your shoulders and she felt across your arms and muttered,&quot;Quite skinny for a male, dainty, you must’ve been desperate...&quot;<br />
<br />
Her hands then moved to your stomach and she paused once she reached reached your wide hips she paused. For a moment she seemed surprised, and then her hands found their way to your pelvis where her fingers pressed up against your clit. &quot;Oh...?&quot; She gasped and you blushed red as her hands then moved up your stomach and took hold of your breasts.<br />
<br />
The elder paused and was still for almost an entire minute, and Vol even raised tilted his head and said,&quot;Uh... m-mommy...?&quot;<br />
<br />
The elder then turned towards him and said,&quot;Oh, no worries, just a bit astonished is all. Here I am thinking I’d die before I’d witness another female like you, two whole decades and not one who showed the chieftain enough confidence to test herself against his own like I have.&quot;<br />
<br />
The elder turned her upper body to the side and you saw the same claw symbol, but on her right shoulder blade and not her face. She then turned back and smiled,&quot;Young you are too, at an age I only dream of living to witness Vol reach, and mate like I have. If only his father were still around, and I wasn’t as welcoming to death as I am now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vol seemed to be saddened by this somewhat, but the elder didn’t take notice due to her affliction. She just coated her hands in saliva and dipped her fingers into the different powdery substances at random. &quot;Oh missy you are just the perfect definition of a wife if I’d ever seen one, and if I could. Although a large bosom you have no stretch marks to show motherhood, so... do you not have a mate? You may speak now, tell me how you found us here,&quot; The elder exclaimed then she took your arm and started painting dark blue symbols on it with her fingers and claws.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I... uh, don’t really know...&quot; You replied,&quot;I don’t have a mate either uh Mrs...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just call me Saryl sweetie,&quot; The elder, Saryl said but unphased by your response,&quot;It’s a pity you haven’t found love now, but I do hope you do. Tell me, you do plan to breed, yes? At least do you plan to nurse, and help our youth grow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh.... not sure about uh... breeding, haven’t really thought of it until now,&quot; You replied, which was when you realized your ability to get pregnant, but you didn’t want to think about that now so you just continued to answer her questions,&quot;I... do plan to be a caretaker, though I have little to no experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm, then I suggest you find a mate, motherhood is a beautiful thing to experience, and in your later years you can have your young care for you like Vol here,&quot; Saryl exclaimed as she started painting red symbols and designs on your other arm.<br />
<br />
Vol paused and chimes in,&quot;Mother, you aren’t concerned that... she said she doesn’t know how she got here...?&quot;<br />
<br />
You glanced over at Vol nervously and Saryl just giggled and said,&quot;I do not question the wills of the spirits my son. If she doesn’t know then it is probably they in which who brought her here. Even now they astound me with visions, and even though I am doomed to blindness they help me see with my mind&#39;s eye.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vol didn’t respond and you just watched her as Saryl started painting more designs in dark green on your legs and around your pelvis, almost dangerously near your clit. &quot;I’m being serious though, I kind of just blacked out and woke up naked just outside of the tribe here,&quot; You replied and the elder laughed and said,&quot;See, the spirits have powers beyond even her understanding.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman soon moved to you breasts and started painting large bright orange colored spirals around each of your boobs into she reached your chest before she moved to your face. &quot;With these marks you are now a member of Zjorn, you are one of us, one with us, and as a nurturer you shall help us grow and flourish. Whether you choose to heal the wounded and care for the sick, raise and educate our young, or bring something new to enlighten our culture is up to you,&quot; Saryl hummed painting white lines down your neck and chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I name you, Piola, nurturer of Zjorn, one who takes pride in her work and perhaps a bit more,&quot; Saryl said with a smile,&quot;If you’re troubled by your nudity then just have Vol fetch you some of my old rags, they should suit you quite nicely. I used to have a body just like yours when I was young, so use it to it’s full potential, Caretaker Piola.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused and blushed then said,&quot;I-I promise, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Saryl then nodded and said,&quot;You are dismissed, and I welcome you to your new life.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused for a second or two to inspect your body and saw the dark green spirals on your thighs, and an arc over your pussy. You saw the serpentine orange spirals on your breasts that sort of made you a bit uncomfortable. Your arms had a similar spiral design extending from your palms to your elbows, with the only difference being color.<br />
<br />
Vol then judged your side and took your hand,&quot;We should go now miss Piola, and let mother rest for now.&quot; You slowly nodded to Vol and stood up, allowing him to guide you out by hand into the first room you entered and shut the door gently behind you as you exited. <br />
<br />
After you both were outside you looked down at yourself and blushed and said,&quot;I feel ridiculous...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother has done worse, but you’ll grow to live like that,&quot; Vol exclaimed,&quot;Everyone has marks and after they dry it stains your scales permanently. The only ones who don’t have those are youth like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; You said then sighed and stared at the spiral designs around your tits. Vol then ran over to a bag and started rummaging through it, and he walked over to your with a small skirt made from otter skins and bra made out of mink skins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mother said you needed clothes, and she said you could have some of her old ones,&quot; Vol exclaimed and you smiled slightly and nodded,&quot;Thanks, and... tell her thanks as well from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem miss Piola,&quot; Vol replied and you paused and stared at the clothing.<br />
<br />
It took you a few minutes to figure out how to put on your clothes, and not just because you were female now, but they were tribal and odd. But after awhile you figure them out and you were shocked, the bra fit almost perfect around your massive tits, which you estimated to be in the E to EE cup range, and the skirt did it’s job, despite the way your tail lifted up the rear portion of it.<br />
<br />
Vol watched you the entire time and when you were done he looked up at you and asked,&quot;You have options you know, as a nurturer miss Piola, just like mother said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I-I mean well...&quot; You paused and thought of what all of the possibilities someone with the title of nurturer would do.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don’t know how something is done then follow someone else’s example, or at least that’s what most females say they do,&quot; Vol said and you nodded then asked,&quot;Well, what exactly can I do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Vol then paused and he crossed his arms for a moment and said,&quot;Well, off the top of my head...&quot;<br />
<br />
Vol started listing out things that you guessed could be roughly defined as &#39;nurture&#39; and the one thing that got your attention the most from that list was...</p>
