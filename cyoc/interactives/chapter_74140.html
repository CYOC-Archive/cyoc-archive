<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking into the mythical package, Jeff wondered what he would change into.  There is a long list of mythical creatures he would like to change into and there is so little time.  But then an idea popped in his head, something he never thought possible.  All of his life, he always wondered what it would be like to be an angel.  To fly around with those angels wings could be pretty cool.  Looking into his options, he searched for the Angel option and found it.  By clicking on it, there was a list of options he needs to type in before the changes start.  Skimming through his options, the choices were fair.  The duration of the change, how long will you remain changed, altering reality, and aware of the changes were all present.  But there was one thing that bothered him.  At the top of the list, there was an option of whether you want to be a male or female angel.  That is kind of strange even for Jeff, but he knows that there are male and female angels in Heaven.  Though males might be dominant, he always wondered what it would be like to be a female.  So flexible and sexy with those dresses and wings.  Thinking about that, Jim decided to give this one a shot.<br />
<br />
Jeff started to work on his choice as he skinned through them correctly.  First, he wants to be a female angel to see how it feels, that way when he’s done, he would switch it to the male angel and see if that’s any good.  He then want the duration to be ten minutes, a little quick but he would see the changes in detail.  How long will he remained change is a different story cause he doesn’t know if he would like it or not.  So just to be on the safe side, he typed down a full week that way he would get use to flying and see what it’s like being an angel.  Next question is if he wants to alter reality.  The last thing he wants is for his entire family to freak out when they see him as a female angel.  Not to mention if he flew around it would be awkward to see people looking up and thinking that they were real.  So to be on the safe side, he decided to change his reality to prevent any problems.  What type of reality it would be, he has no idea, but it’s a risk he has to take.  The last option he has to put together is being aware of the changes or not.  This one is a difficult one for Jeff.  If he were unaware of the changes, he would forget about his previous lift.  But if he set it to aware, he would still attain his memories after the change.  Wanting to be safe, he decided to make himself aware of the changes and avoid any permanent problems.  Looking through his options, he checked to see if there’s anything he’s missing.  Looking into this, he smiled and said, “I guess that’s that.  Looks like everything is in order.  Let’s get this started.”  Moving the cursor to the ‘start transformation’ icon, he took a deep breath and clicked on it.  Just as he did that, another window appeared and showed the countdown timer that started with ten minutes.  When the started to countdown in seconds, Jeff felt a small tingle and knew that the changes were starting.  Knowing what that means, he took a good look at the mirror and sees the changes for himself.  What he saw was truly amazing.<br />
<br />
The first thing that changed was his body.  Jeff watched in awe as his body started to grow in some places and shrink a little as his clothes all loose.  His muscles as a sixteen-year-old teen dwindled away; they started to tone up looked more feminine.  His sneakers were loose on the inside, as they grew small and dainty.  Same goes with his hands as they grew smaller and female like while his fingers got slender with growing nails.  Jeff’s hips began to expand and grew so curvy while his butt puffed out and was bubble shaped to match his flaring hips.  He then started to feel weird in his groin and peeked in to see what it was.  Turned out, he saw his dick growing smaller and thinning into a colitis as his balls shriveled and sucked up into the new opening, turning them into ovaries.  Once what’s left of his penis shrink into his opening, his privates turned into a vagina.  He, or now she, was amazed by this and wanted to know how it feels like.  When she touched it, she was in complete and utter bliss.  She never felt anything like this before.  But as she was pleasuring herself, more changes took place.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s chest started to feel itchy and the nipples started to poke out at her shirt.  It was then that her chest puffed into a pair of mounds, which soon turned into cones, which turned into cup size breasts.  They continued to grow bigger and bigger until they were a pair of D-cups, bouncing freely underneath her shirt.  The last to change was her face and it started to shape shift into a female shape.  Her skull structure shape shift and the smoothed out as the thin hairs on her chin shrank back to her skin.  Her nose grew longer and was thin to adult proportions.  Her lips puffed out and were completely kissable.  As she was moaning, her voice had cracked a couple of octaves as her Adams apple shrank in her throat.  Her eyes changed color from dark brown to sky blue and shine brightly in the sunlight.  Finally, her hair grew down to the middle of her back and went from dark brown of shiny blonde.  For the first five minutes, Jeff went from being a teenage male to a hot teenage woman.  Jeff stopped her fingering and looked at herself in the mirror.  Smiling wide she said, “Wow!  This is amazing!  Who would’ve thought that this program can do that to me?”  She grabbed her throat and was surprised at how high her voice was.  This change was so incredible for her, but it was just the beginning.<br />
<br />
As she was admiring herself in the mirror, Jeff started to feel an itch on her back.  She started to scratch it with her long nails, but it kept on getting worse.  As she was itching, she started to feel some bumps growing out of her back and getting bigger by the second.  She couldn’t take it anymore as she screamed out in pain.  As she was screaming out, the bumps burst out the back of her shirt and grew out of it.  Jeff looked into the mirror and saw something completely amazing.  What she saw where white wings with glistening feathers and shine so brightly.  She flapped it a couple of times and was amazed at how flexible they were with it’s own muscles.  It was quite an interesting moment she had to cherish.<br />
<br />
Within the last few minutes, her clothes were next to go.  She watched in shock as her shirt and pants merged together and swirled around her body.  As it was finished, she was wearing some kind of Roman tunic for women with her breasts exposed in the white X like cloth.  Her sneakers changed shape and morphed into Greek like sandals.  Then accessories were dotted all over her body from golden necklaces to ruby bracelets to diamond earrings.  And to top it all off, make up was strewn all over her face, making her more beautiful then ever.  With her transformation complete, Jeff went from behind a teenage boy to a female woman.<br />
<br />
Just as the changes were finished, Jeff noticed her room changing to accommodate her needs.  Colors were swirling around her as reality began to alter.  In a few seconds, she was in a royal room made of gold and pearl with a circular bed, a huge closet, and an amazing view.  Looking out at the view, she soon realized that her world turned into Heaven with many palaces and clouds for the floor.  It was all too beautiful.  She could even feel her mind changing along with her world and had new memories, but remained unaware of all the changes.  She realized her name was Jessie and she was born an angel.  She had angel friends, and go to an angel school.  She even had an angel family that loved her and they were all kind hearted.  She even goes down to Earth of protect the humans from anything that is evil.  Jessie was ecstatic of what the Chronivac did that she couldn’t contain herself.  What would she do now?</p>
