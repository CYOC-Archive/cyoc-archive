<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Sunlight pricked at Andrew's eyes, and
he shut them tighter, trying to block it
out and get back to sleep. He had had the
<i>weirdest</i> dream last night, from
which he was glad to have woken, but he
could really use a few more minutes of
rest. Unable to block out the light with
his eyelids, he covered his face with one
arm.</p>
<p>Something was wrong. The arm in
question somehow covered a much wider area
than normal, and was covered
with...<i>feathers?</i> Andrew groaned, a
soft, feminine sound, as <i>she</i>
realized that it hadn't been a dream after
all. Now more or less awake, she rolled
onto her back and opened her eyes.
Stalactite-studded rock greeted her. She
stared up at the cave ceiling for a minute
or two before finally sitting up.</p>
<p>She was immediately aware of the fact
that sitting up tended to pull
uncomfortably at the base of her
tailfeathers. She leaned to one side and
lifted them out from under her,
discovering, in the process, that she was
able to angle the up away from the floor,
instead of having to lean forward when she
sat. Having finally managed to sit up
comfortably, Andrew looked around the
room.</p>
<p>Laurel wasn't there. There was no
indication of where she might have gone,
but she was probably out hunting or
something, Andrew reasoned. Wherever she'd
gone, Laurel had left a slice of meat
speared on a roasting stick, which Andrew
eagerly began turning over the glowing
coals in the firepit.</p>
<p>It took a few tries to get it cooked
enough, and some parts were more done than
others, but before too long Andrew had
made a fairly satisfying breakfast out of
the...whatever it was (probably still
venison, she figured, but she really
couldn't tell one game animal from
another.) But now her face was covered in
grease and flecks of charred meat, and she
hadn't had a shower in two days; she was
feeling more than a little grimy.</p>
<p>Andrew made her way to the entrance of
the cave, to have a look around. The cave
exited right onto the rim of a small pool,
which was fed from a tiny waterfall that
trickled down from the hill the cave was
located in. It was a beautiful sight, but
Andrew was primarily interested in getting
washed up.</p>
<p>The icy water took a bit of getting
used to, and the fact that the cold left
her nipples hard made Andrew feel
embarassed for the assorted times she'd
made a crack about that before, but
overall it went pretty well, and she was
able to get herself about as clean as was
possible without soap or shampoo.
(Incidentally, Laurel was right; she
<i>did</i> look nicer with her hair
straightened.) The ruffling of her
feathers to dry them took a little
figuring out, but she managed, and before
long she was sitting on the ledge above
the pool, swirling her talons in the water
and letting the morning sun dry the rest
of her out.</p>
<p>It was while she was sitting there,
drying off, that Andrew became aware of a
slowly increasing pressure in her gut. It
was rather like the sensation of needing
to take a dump, except it wasn't coming
from her intestines. Andrew wasn't sure
what, exactly, was going on, but the
pressure was steadily increasing, and she
didn't want to make any kind of mess on
what amounted to Laurel's front porch. She
sprinted around the side of the hill a
ways, and then squatted down to await the
inevitable.</p>
<p>As it turned out, it was exactly what
Andrew had hoped it wasn't. There was a
large object making its way down her -
what was it, again - birth canal, and she
realized that this was the oviposition
Laurel had warned her about. <i>Andrew was
laying an egg.</i> Fortunately, the
process itself was distracting enough that
she didn't have time to feel too
embarassed. The egg was getting down
towards her pubic area now, and the
feeling was pretty uncomfortable. Her
earlier appraisal had been fairly
accurate; it was a lot like the feeling of
passing a gigantic stool. Her eyes tearing
up a little as the egg began its exit
through her vagina, Andrew focused on
pushing it out of her body as quickly as
possible. Finally, after what seemed like
forever, the egg dropped to the ground,
and it was over.</p>
<p>Andrew spent the next minute or so
catching her breath. While that hadn't
been at <i>all</i> pleasant, at least
Laurel was right and it wasn't as bad as
she'd feared. It was certainly nowhere
near as bad as the childbirth video they'd
had to watch in health class. Still, she
<i>really</i> hoped she and Laurel would
find a way back to normal before she had
to do that again.</p>
<p>Unsure what to with the egg, Andrew
scooped it up and cradled it in her wings,
carrying it back to the cave, where Laurel
had returned. She took one look at Andrew
and gasped. "Oh, you poor girl!" she said.
"Did you have to do that by yourself?I'm
sorry, I was going to walk you through
your first time."</p>
<p>"Um, well," Andrew said, rather
embarassed by being referred to as "you
poor girl," "it's not like you could've
predicted it would happen when it
did."</p>
<p>"Well," Laurel said, carrying the egg
to the back of the cave and dropping it
down a deep, coffee-can-sized hole in the
floor, "at least you've got the first one
over with; it gets easier after that.
You'll get used to it."</p>
<p>Andrew moaned. She knew Laurel was just
trying to make her feel better, but she
didn't <i>want</i> to get used to it!</p></p>
