<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As I continued to admire myself in the mirror, I heard the door to my bedroom open.  I turned around and saw my roommate Phil walk into the bedroom.  It took him a moment to notice that I was standing in the room.  Obviously he didn’t think I was home and didn’t expect to see anyone.  As soon as he caught sight of me, hilarity ensued.<br />
<br />
“What the hell?” Phil exclaimed.  I saw his eyes go up and down my gorgeous body and then he covered his eyes with his hands.  “Oh my god, I’m sorry, but…who the hell are you?”<br />
<br />
His reaction made me smile out of one side of my mouth.  Poor Phil was always trying to be polite, but could never help but be rather boorish in some way.  He may have averted his gaze now, but not before he took a good look.  Not that I could blame him, I’m sure I would have done the same thing.  But now I could have him at my advantage.<br />
<br />
“Phil, you’re not going to believe this, but it’s me, Joe,” I said.<br />
<br />
“What?” he said as he continued to cover his eyes.  “You are most certainly not Joe.  You’re a girl!  A very attractive, naked girl.  So you can’t be Joe!”  Like I said, he couldn’t help but make inappropriate comments at the worst times.<br />
<br />
I didn’t want to have to get into a long explanation and I didn’t want to tell him about the ring, so I took the easy way.  I picked up my male skin and walked closer to Phil.  “Phil, uncover your eyes,” I said.  <br />
<br />
“No,” he said.  “It’s not right.”<br />
<br />
I lost my patience.  “Dammit, Phil, do what I say and uncover your fucking eyes!” I commanded.  I was amazed to hear myself talk in the same manner I always did but to hear another voice say the words.  Phil relented to my demand and uncovered his eyes.  I held up my male skin in front of me.  “See?” I said.  “Here’s the me you know.”  I held my male skin in front of my body.  Then I tossed it to the side and said, “And this is me now.”  He immediately covered his eyes again.  I sighed and said, “You’ve already taken a good look so just uncover your eyes.”<br />
<br />
“Uh-uh,” he said.  “And I still don’t believe you.  That…costume didn’t look like Joe from what I could tell.  And that still doesn’t explain…anything you say.”<br />
<br />
Now I was really angry.  I guess I was expecting too much for him to believe that a very hot, naked girl in his roommate’s room was actually his male roommate.  “Fine,” I said.  “Since I’m telling the truth, I just wish that you would believe my story about me being Joe since it is the absolute truth!”<br />
<br />
“Wha-what?” he stammered. He shook his head violently, as if something attacked his mind.  “Joe, what…I mean, how did this happen?”  I smiled with the knowledge that my wish worked perfectly.<br />
<br />
“Let’s just say I have some powers that I didn’t have this morning,” I said.  I still didn’t want to divulge anything about the ring.  “And I never told you, or anyone for that matter, but I’ve always wanted to be a woman and now I am.”<br />
<br />
“O…K,” he said.  “That’s weird.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t care what you think it is,” I said.  “It’s what I want.”  I looked at Phil as he continued to amusingly clutch his hand over his eyes.  I looked down at his groin and could see that he had an erection.  I had to stare at it for a moment.  As I did I began to have thoughts that were foreign to me.  I wanted to know what it would feel like to really use this body.  I wanted the feeling that only a woman can have.<br />
<br />
I walked directly over to him and pressed my body against his.  We had always been about the same height when I was a male and I was still the same height now.  I whispered in his ear, “Don’t you find me hot?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yes,” Phil answered.<br />
<br />
“Wouldn’t you like to fuck me?” I whispered again.<br />
<br />
He responded, “Y-no, no, no, no, no way.”<br />
<br />
“No?” I whispered again as I pressed myself harder against him.  I could feel his erection growing in size through his pants.<br />
<br />
“No,” he reaffirmed without a stammer this time.<br />
<br />
“Tough,” I said.  I grabbed his shoulders and moved him over to my bed.  I caught him off balance and was able to move him easily.  I forced him over to the bed and threw him down on top of it.  He tried to pick himself up but I pushed him back down.  I moved quickly to take off his shoes and socks.  He continued to try and sit up but I pushed him down again every time.  “Stop being such a child,” I said.<br />
<br />
“This isn’t right,” he protested.<br />
<br />
I pounced on top of him and planted a firm kiss on his lips.  It took a few seconds but he eventually returned the kiss.  I knew he could only resist so long.  I broke off the kiss and said, “That’s right, baby, just let it happen.”  I got off of him and went after his pants.  I unbuckled his belt, unclasped the button on his pants and pulled off his pants and his boxers together.  I looked at his erect cock and wasted no time.  I put my mouth around it and greedily sucked at it.  Phil moaned loudly as I gave him the blow job of his life.  He came very quickly and I swallowed every last bit that came out of his cock.  It was at this moment I realized that my change into a woman was complete and that I was truly in the body I was meant to have.  Nothing about what I did felt wrong in the slightest way.<br />
<br />
I released his cock from my mouth.  He was still wearing his shirt, so I pulled him up from his prone position on the bed and pulled the shirt off his body.  Phil didn’t have a great body but I didn’t care.  I needed more.  “Come on, you’re not done,” I said as kissed him again.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think I’m ready,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yes, you are,” I said and made a silent wish that his cock would return to ready status.  His cock sprang back to life immediately.  “See?” I said.<br />
<br />
He looked shocked.  “How did that happen so fast?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry about it,” I said.  I positioned myself on my back though I sat up slightly.  I spread my legs and invited him to me.  “Come on, baby, we both want it,” I cooed seductively.  I ran my finger over my hardened nipple to tease him further.  He finally gave in and crawled over to me.  He took his position and thrust his hard cock into my awaiting pussy.  The feeling it produced was absolutely electric.  “Oh, god, yes,” I screamed in ecstasy.  I was half trying to get him more into our fucking while I also felt unreal.  I had sex as a male and it always felt good, but this was something completely different.<br />
<br />
Phil was pretty good once he started.  He thrust into me with just the right amount of speed and force.  I wrapped my legs around him and squeezed him harder into me.  I sat up from the bed and wrapped my arms around his neck in order to continue bringing him closer to me.  Phil clamped his mouth on my right breast and sucked away.  “Oh, yes, fuck me, fuck me!” I screamed.  <br />
<br />
In between the wonderful feelings I retained enough forethought for two additional wishes.  I wished that there wouldn’t be any complications to our fucking, such as pregnancy or STD, even though I knew I was clean and was fairly certain that Phil was too.  I also wished that he would not climax until I did as well.  That way I wouldn’t have to keep wishing for him to match me.<br />
<br />
Phil continued to ravage my virgin pussy and I continued to scream in delight.  “Oh, yes, harder, harder!” I screamed.  I couldn’t believe how good this felt.  Sex was so much better as a woman.  I felt myself build closer and closer to climax and wailed in ecstasy as I came.  Phil shot himself into me and I squeezed my pussy around his cock to absorb every last bit.  I let go of his neck and fell back onto the bed.  He removed his cock and lay down next to me.  I leaned over and kissed him on the lips again.  “Thank you,” I whispered.</p>
