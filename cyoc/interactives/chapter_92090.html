<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Listen mate,&quot; the dwarf began. &quot;Ye saved me life at least twice now. I&#39;m in yer debt. But...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Spit it out,&quot; John said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can ye pick up the pace a little bit? The sun&#39;s goin&#39; down, and I&#39;m gettin&#39; a chill.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would go faster if I wasn&#39;t barefoot! There&#39;s too many damn twigs in this forest!&quot; John replied, stepping gingerly. &quot;How the hell did we get roped into finding that idiot&#39;s horse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think the dame asked ya, and ye said yes. That&#39;s how.&quot;<br />
<br />
John sighed. &quot;Love makes an orc do crazy things, my man.&quot; After a prolonged argument on who would find Kaecinus’s horse (because it sure as shit wasn’t going to be Kaecinus), John and Sanin took to the woods to find her. Kaecinus forbid Jenny to be alone with John (especially after their previous passionate moment), and John didn’t care to spend more time alone with Kaecinus than he had to. That left Sanin. “Doesn’t explain why you came with me, though.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me, I&#39;d rather be with you than that bootlicker Kaecinus. And that be sayin’ somethin’. Talkin’ of love, how in the blue blazes are you and the princess hookin’ up? I look away fer a minute and yer suckin’ face!&quot;<br />
<br />
John blushed. “I don’t know. Maybe she can see me for what I really am.”<br />
<br />
“What, a dragon?”<br />
<br />
John bit his lip, which was more painful than expected thanks to his large tusks. His brief time as a dragon was a great experience. Dragons were the top of the food chain, and they had the confidence to assert that position. “I wish. No, a human.”<br />
<br />
“A what?”<br />
<br />
John looked over at Sanin. “There are no humans here?”<br />
<br />
Sanin shrugged. “Not a people I ever heard of. Not that I get out much.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I guess I’d say humans are like elves, but without the pointy ears. Similar to dwarves, like yourself, but taller and less hairy.”<br />
<br />
“Then why ya walkin’ round as an orc? You’d blend in more as one of these ‘humans’.”<br />
<br />
John decided to tell Sanin the whole story. “Look, I’m from a place where the only creatures are humans and animals. There aren’t any elves, orcs, dwarves, satyrs, or dragons, normally at least. I used to live with the minotaur we were trapped with in that labyrinth. Except we were obviously both humans until we were transformed by the satyr and sent here. One second I was human, the next I was an orc shackled in a dungeon in a different universe, apparently. I might be able to change back to human, but I haven&#39;t really tried.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Huh,” Sanin said. John wasn’t sure if Sanin was disinterested or if that explanation went over his head. “I believe ya. Satyrs have access to magic that I can’t begin to wrap me head round. Can we find this goddamn horse, please?”<br />
<br />
John smirked. “Seriously. I’m starving.” Sanin’s head snapped towards John, horrified. “I’m kidding,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Don’t kid! That fucker’d have all our favorite body parts lopped off!”<br />
<br />
“What’s that guy’s deal, anyway? I know he’s close to the princess and all, but is he royalty or something?”<br />
<br />
Sanin snorted. “In his dreams. He’s one o’the ‘noblest’ --” Sanin applied air quotes to that word and rolled his eyes. “-- knights in the kingdom. He’s on the king’s round table, and he totally didn’t pay his way onto it.”<br />
<br />
“Gotcha,” John said. “By the way, I smell the horse.”<br />
<br />
“You wha-?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, off that way a bit. I think she just went number two. She needs to eat more grain. I don’t think Kaecinus feeds her right.”<br />
<br />
Sanin was stunned. “She just crapped and ye can smell it? Ye sure it’s a horse? What if it be a bear?”<br />
<br />
John cracked his knuckles. “I welcome the challenge,” he said.<br />
<br />
Sanin was silent for a few seconds, then turned around with a smirk. “Race ya,” he said, then took off on a sprint in the direction John had pointed, leaping over fallen tree branches.<br />
<br />
“Hey!” John ran after the dwarf. In this environment, the dwarf was much more fleet of foot, darting between narrow gaps between trees. John had to watch his step so he didn’t jab his feet on sharp rocks. “Ow! Not fair!” he panted. John’s orc instincts had up until now been good at helping him move quickly and quietly in a straight line, but there were too many obstacles in this forest.<br />
<br />
“Come on, you slowpoke! We’re finding this fucker’s nag and getting out of here.” Sanin called back. They chased each other for a short time, with Sanin always having a large lead. After a few minutes, the horse came into view. “Ha!” Sanin exclaimed and turned around. “I beat…” he trailed off as he saw a scowling John sprinting towards him, red eyes glowing, like a linebacker after a quarterback. “Oh, shi-,” he muttered, frozen in place.<br />
<br />
With a tackle that would make Ray Lewis proud, Sanin was pinned to the ground by the huge orc’s body, their faces inches apart. “You were saying?” John growled.<br />
<br />
“Get off me, you green sack of …” Sanin’s expression suddenly changed as John’s sweaty odor permeated his nostrils. Just as his musk had caused Brian to become aroused his first day as an orc, Sanin was swimming in John’s aphrodisiac aroma. <br />
<br />
“Um, are you…” John noticed the hard object underneath the horse blanket loincloth the dwarf was wearing poking into his muscled chest. “...all right?” Sanin didn’t answer, the look of lust on his face speaking for him. Sanin slowly leaned in and gently kissed John’s bottom lip, his bead scratching John’s face. John blushed tremendously and began to sweat some more, heightening Sanin’s passion. Flummoxed, John stared wide-eyed at Sanin. He had previously had some sexual urges for the hairy dwarf, but he never dreamed he would reciprocate. He didn’t seem like he would be interested in men, let alone huge burly orcs. He had a wife, for crying out loud!<br />
<br />
John then noticed that the mare had spooked by their roughhousing and was running away again. John got up and quickly attempted to corral the scared horse. Sanin remained laying down on the ground, in a passionate daze.<br />
<br />
“Hey girl, it’s OK,” John said quietly, approaching the horse. He shushed it a few times. The horse appeared to calm down. The green man was much larger than the people that normally rode her, but the orc seemed more friendly than those people to the mare. John scratched her under her long muzzle, taking care to use his fingertips and not his orc claws. “It’s going to be OK,” he repeated quietly, grabbing her halter. “The bad man’s gone. It’s going to be… hey!”<br />
<br />
Sanin had snuck up behind John and ripped his loincloth off his body, exposing his orc ass to the dwarf. John’s eyes widened as Sanin ran his small hands over his ample rear end slowly. His orc heart beating even faster than during their chase, John asked Sanin what he was doing. “Something I’ve needed to do for a long time,” he said, tightly grasping his erection. “Get on yer knees.”</p>
