<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael’s strategy for splitting the group off into two was no accident, nor was it a coincidence that he sent Freddy’s father and Josh in the direction that he did. He figured that Fido…erm, Freddy, might be attracted by the sights and scents in the back of the park where it was more secluded. This was the area where a lot of drug use took place before the police cracked down it this summer. Still, it could be dangerous, so Michael thought it was best to go alone. <br />
<br />
He also knew that if Freddy had so suddenly ditched his father and brother like that, knowing how dangerous it could be as a stray dog, it may have been triggered some sort of sense that a clue was in this direction…or an attraction that could spell trouble. Either way, Michael had to chance it alone. He couldn’t risk getting Freddy’s father and brother caught up in this mess.<br />
<br />
As he reached the back area, Michael didn’t notice anything at first. He spent a few minutes scouring the overgrown area of trees before he heard a faint moaning in the distance. <br />
<br />
“I hope that’s Freddy” Michael thought to himself as he began to slowly tiptoe over in the direction of the noise. <br />
<br />
Upon reaching the spot, an expression of shock swept over Michael’s face as he became horrified at the discovery of… <br />
<br />
“Freddy!” he yelled.<br />
<br />
In front of him in the dirt below was a nude Freddy, save for a collar and leash, on top of a seemingly calm Black Labrador dog. <br />
<br />
“Shit” Freddy responded quietly hoping not to wake up the dog. <br />
<br />
In anger, Michael grabbed Freddy by the collar and pulled him up into a standing position. <br />
<br />
“Hey watch it!” Freddy snapped at Michael. “You could…”<br />
<br />
Before he could finish his sentence, the dog turned around and began to growl at the two of them with her bare teeth exposed. <br />
<br />
“Oh shit!” Michael responded in fear. <br />
<br />
“Run!” Freddy yelled as he grabbed Michael and turned him around. <br />
<br />
The two boys started running for their lives as a nude Freddy and a clothed Michael were chased after by the Black Labrador bitch barking as loud as she could. Panting for dear life and powered by an extreme amount of adrenaline, the two boys ran for what seemed like miles before they approached a fence in the distance. <br />
<br />
“Let’s try to hop over this fence!” Freddy yelled as he turned to Michael and saw the dog running towards them. <br />
<br />
“I can’t hop over a fence!” Michael responded. <br />
<br />
“You have another suggestion?!”<br />
<br />
Knowing there was no other way out, Freddy began to motion Michael to him and he helped him up onto the fence. As Michael got half way up, Freddy joined him as the Black Lab reached the fence and began to bark at the two of them loudly while jumping. In panic, Michael almost slipped before Freddy grabbed him at the top of the fence and directed him over to the other side. As the two boys jumped down below, they briefly composed themselves before the jumping and attempted climbing of the dog behind them shocked them back into running again as they made their way towards the neighborhood. Before they got onto the residential blocks, the two slowed down to catch their breaths. <br />
<br />
“Michael” Freddy said nervously as he composed himself. “I’m not wearing any clothes.”<br />
<br />
Michael slapped him across the face. <br />
<br />
“You don’t need to wear any clothes, you dirty animal!” Michael responded angrily. “What the fuck is wrong with you?”<br />
<br />
“Can we talk about this later? We’re on a public street and I’m naked…save for this stupid thing.”<br />
<br />
Freddy unhooked the collar and leash and pulled it off of him, letting it hang in one hand. <br />
<br />
“What was that all about, Freddy?”<br />
<br />
“Michael, please. Can we talk about this later?”<br />
<br />
“Freddy, did you fuck that dog?”<br />
<br />
Freddy looked down sheepishly at the ground, unable to make eye contact with Michael. A sense of shame and embarrassment brushed over him as his cheeks turned red. Watching on, tears flowed through Michael’s eyes at the thought of his boyfriend, the love of his life, had cheated on him, and with another dog no less. He was feeling a strong sense of anger and pain. <br />
<br />
“You did, didn’t you?” Michael asked. <br />
<br />
Freddy stood stoically, putting his hands on his face. <br />
<br />
“Michael, it’s not what it looks like.”<br />
<br />
“Oh no?” Michael snapped back aggressively at Freddy. “What does it look like then? My boyfriend, my stupid boyfriend, on top of a dog naked in a public park, after having just bred her like a common bitch. What am I supposed to think it looks like?”<br />
<br />
“Michael, I can’t help it. It’s like this dog has a mind of its own. I’ve been trying to get it under control, but it won’t let me.”<br />
<br />
Michael began to cry as Freddy went to reach out for him and rub his back. <br />
<br />
“Don’t do that!” Michael snapped. <br />
<br />
Freddy recoiled, but then took his hand to Michael’s chin and directed it to look into his eyes. <br />
<br />
“Can we talk about this at my place, please? And can I get some clothes?”<br />
<br />
“What makes you think I have any clothes?”<br />
<br />
“Your knapsack.” Freddy pointed to the bag that slung over his boyfriend’s shoulder. <br />
<br />
Michael noticed it as well and was thankful that it didn’t drop in his encounter with the angry dog as it had the ring inside. <br />
<br />
“Oh, right” Michael replied as he began to compose himself. <br />
<br />
He took the bag off from his shoulders and began to unzip it to roam his hand through its contents. Michael managed to pull out a loose fitting pair of jogging pants and a tee shirt with some underwear out to hand to Freddy. <br />
<br />
“I figured if you had changed back” Michael said as he wiped away his tears and sniffled “you were going to want some clothes, though you don’t deserve them. I know these are a bit loose fitting for me, so they should be just about right for you.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks” Freddy replied as he took the clothes. <br />
<br />
He dropped his collar and leash on the ground as he looked both ways on the street before putting his underwear and pants on and then his shirt. <br />
 <br />
“No shoes?” he asked. <br />
<br />
Michael gave him a glaring look before Freddy put up his hands in resignation.<br />
<br />
“Never mind. At least I have something to wear now. Thank you, Michael.”<br />
<br />
Freddy took the collar and handed it to Michael, who put it in his knapsack before he re-zipped it. The two boys began to walk towards Freddy’s house in silence. As Freddy tried to comfort and soothe Michael, Michael continued to recoil at his advances. Michael was still feeling very salty and he expected a proper explanation when they were alone together. After what seemed like hours, but were only mere minutes, the two managed to arrive at Freddy’s house with a noticeable sign. <br />
<br />
“The car is gone” Michael said. “That must mean your mother went to the park to meet up with your father and Josh.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah” Freddy replied. “She probably noticed they were gone for a while and decided to go after them. Did you see them while you were there?”<br />
<br />
“I did. That’s how I knew to look for you in the first place. I came over here a little while ago and your mother told me where you were. I had a bad feeling about it, so I went and found your brother and father. Anyways, let’s get inside before they get home.”<br />
<br />
“Ok.”<br />
<br />
Freddy tried the front door, but noticed it was locked. The two then went around the backyard to try the back door as a sense of dread once again washed over Freddy. <br />
<br />
“Oh no” he thought to himself. “She’s out again.”<br />
<br />
Before he could say anything, a yipping Ellie raced from her yard to the hole in the fence that they dug out as dogs last night. <br />
<br />
“Michael, let’s get inside quickly before I turn into a dog again.”<br />
<br />
Knowing this may be a major clue to solving the curse, but not wanting to trigger it now, Michael went in with Freddy and then shut the door behind them tight and locked it. Within a matter of moments, Ellie had managed to make her way under the fence and began once again pawing at the door and barking at him. <br />
<br />
“Let’s get upstairs quickly” Freddy said as he grabbed Michael to make their way upstairs. <br />
<br />
“Why does she keep barking at you?” Michael asked. <br />
<br />
“Let’s talk about it…upstairs.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you think you should wipe your feet first?”<br />
<br />
Freddy looked down at his muddy feet and briefly rubbed it on the mat below before running to the kitchen and briefly wiping them off with a wet towel. The two boys then made their way up the stairs and slammed the door behind them and locked it. In Freddy’s room, he sat on the bed as Michael grabbed a rolling chair and swiveled it to face Freddy. Michael’s calm demeanor once again dissipated as anger returned to his facial expressions. <br />
<br />
“You have a lot of explaining to do” Michael said with a sharpness to his voice. “I know you’re hiding things from me, so I want you to start coughing it up right now and tell me everything that has been going on.”<br />
<br />
Freddy’s cheeks turned red as an overwhelming sense of embarrassment rushed over his face. He looked down onto the floor, unable to return Michael’s staring that was very strong. He could feel Michael’s judgements in his head as if he had a sixth sense. <br />
<br />
“I’m waiting” Michael said impatiently. <br />
<br />
After a number of moments to compose himself, Freddy looked up at Michael with a few tears strolling down his cheeks. As embarrassed as he was to talk about what he was about to discuss, he knew he had to do it if he wanted to keep Michael and break this curse. <br />
<br />
“I have a theory as to how my transformations work.”<br />
<br />
Michael looked at Freddy curiously, but with a hint of skepticism. <br />
<br />
“You see” Freddy continued “I noticed that anytime a change was coming on, it had something to do with sex. Whenever I get really horny, my dog sheath comes out and I start dogging out on the spot.”<br />
<br />
Michael nodded as he began to process this information. <br />
<br />
“And when I cum as a dog” Freddy continued “I change back to myself again.”<br />
<br />
“How did you come to determine this?” Michael asked skeptically. <br />
<br />
“Well, I’ve had sex with more than one dog.”<br />
<br />
“You what!” Michael snapped as he jumped, almost falling off of the chair. <br />
<br />
“This morning” Freddy quickly interjected to try to calm Michael down “when my parents left me out in the yard like a common animal…”<br />
<br />
“You are an animal!” Michael snapped. <br />
<br />
“Michael please!” Freddy responded. “Hear me out! This is important!”<br />
<br />
Michael briefly calmed down before slinking back into the chair. <br />
<br />
“Anyways” Freddy continued “this morning when I was asleep in the back yard, I noticed that I was being licked in my ear and it was really turning me on.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t need to hear all the details of your fucking session” Michael replied curtly. “Get to the point.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry” Freddy replied sheepishly. “Anyways, long story short. Ellie…”<br />
<br />
“Really, Michael? The neighbor’s dog?”<br />
<br />
“That’s what I was trying to explain to you about when she started barking at us and sneaking over the fence.”<br />
<br />
Ellie’s owner had gone over the fence again to grab her while Freddy and Michael were in his room to take her back in the house. <br />
<br />
“This morning” Freddy continued “she managed her wiggle her way under the fence and started coming onto me. I tried fending her off, Michael, but she was persistent. She is in heat and she was very aggressive. She kept rubbing her flanks onto me and this dog body seems to have a mind of its own, you know. When I couldn’t get back in the house, it’s like…Fido took over and I…”<br />
<br />
Freddy looked down at his hands as Michael looked on with concern. <br />
<br />
“I mated with her.”<br />
<br />
“Oh God” Michael groaned as he sunk into the chair. “Great, now you’re going to be father to a litter of puppies.” <br />
<br />
“Michael, please.”<br />
<br />
Michael composed himself as Freddy continued. <br />
<br />
“But when it was all over, that’s when I started changing back.”<br />
<br />
This piqued Michael’s curiosity and he sat back up to look at Freddy. <br />
<br />
“So what you’re suggesting is that having dog sex turns you back?” Michael asked. <br />
<br />
“Not necessarily” Freddy responded. “There was one other time, besides in the park, when I turned back into a human. That was after…”<br />
<br />
“Cumming on my front steps” Michael interjected, finally putting two and two together. “So orgasm and ejaculation trigger the change back, but how did you get to be a dog in the first place?”<br />
<br />
“I guess it happens when I get turned on. It happened this morning when Ellie made her way back over the fence when my parents went to pick up Josh, it happened at your house when we were fooling around and it happened when I…”<br />
<br />
Freddy looked down again embarrassed about discussing this. <br />
<br />
“…started masturbating after I came home from your house yesterday.”<br />
<br />
As Freddy began making confessions he should have hours ago, Michael was putting the pieces together and coming up with a theory as to how this curse worked. <br />
<br />
“I wish you had told me some of this stuff earlier” Michael said. “It would have helped me a lot in my research during my free period. Now it all seems to make sense.”<br />
<br />
Michael got up from the chair to sit next to Freddy on the bed. <br />
<br />
“I think I figured it out.”<br />
<br />
Freddy looked at Michael as he started to give off a calmer vibe. <br />
<br />
“It seems” Michael continued “that when you get turned on either by me or by another dog, it triggers the transformation.”<br />
<br />
Freddy nodded. <br />
<br />
“And when you release your canine sperm, it triggers the transformation back. So now that we know how this curse works, how do we end it all together?”<br />
<br />
Just as Michael completed this thought, the two boys heard a knock on the door. <br />
<br />
“I wonder who that could be?” Freddy asked as they got up from the bed to go downstairs. <br />
<br />
Cautiously, they made their way to the front door and briefly looked out the glass that allowed them peer onto the street in front of Freddy&#39;s house. When they did so, they spotted….</p>
