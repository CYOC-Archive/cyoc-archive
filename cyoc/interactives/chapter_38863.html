<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One thing that Keiko realized only two rounds into the game that was, quite simply, there <br />
was no way she could beat Julio at this game. He had centuries experience she didn't, true, <br />
the game had only existed for about ninety nine years give or take, but Julio clearly had <br />
more experience at it than Keiko did, more than any other human being alive. This was not <br />
good. The temptation did occur to Keiko to cheat, but not only did it just not feel right, <br />
and was dishonorable, there was the fact she wondered if she pass it by Julio at all. Only <br />
Kyriel and Jasmine had a real picture of what Julio could and could not do. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
'I can't beat him directly. And there's no way I'm cheating. So how do I win?' While Keiko <br />
wasn't revolted at the idea of looking for hidden truths for Julio for a year, in particular <br />
since she was now going to live for about a nine hundred or so years (she wasn't <br />
immortal), she did want to have Julio with her if push can to shove. Only she did pray to <br />
her own god that she wouldn't need to.&nbsp; Keiko thought of everything she knew of her new <br />
race, both myth and truths (not that the kitesune actually minded the myths).&nbsp; 'Think <br />
about what he wants.' The idea popped into Keiko furry and deceptively clever brain.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it's a shame if you lose.&quot; She said perfectly casually.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you figure?&quot; Julio said keeping his poker face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simple. You'll never find out what form I've thought up for you to assume that Jasmine <br />
won't notice you in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm guessing either flea, or something that involve fox tails and a really big chest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe. Maybe not. Point is that you don't know. And you'll never know if you win.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And why should I care weather I know or not? With a kitesune, sometimes you're better off <br />
-not- knowing.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted. But you're the curious type Julio, Janice told us about your quest, you wouldn't <br />
-be- on this quest of yours if you weren't will to embrace that curiosity with all of your <br />
being.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've also learned curiosity should be tempered with caution.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wise words.&nbsp; Make the choice, adventurous stranger; strike the bell and bide the danger.&nbsp; <br />
Or wonder, until it drives you mad,&nbsp; what would have followed if you had.&nbsp; C.S.Lewis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You KNOW C.S. Lewis? I though you were Japanese.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The movie got me curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I recall, when the lad DID strike the bell, he unleashed the first wicked witch into <br />
Narnia.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're good. Then again I guess you have a lot of experiences. But wouldn't the <br />
experiences in a new form be hard to pass up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn't do as much for me as others. My spirit is hardwired so I don't get the new <br />
instincts for whatever form my body assumes. That includes urges and subconscious <br />
actions. Species that are slaves to their cursed instincts likes werewolves and vampires <br />
-really- didn't like me for that one. But it also means that if I assumed a form with wings, <br />
I'd have to learn to fly without even the instinctual muscle control to help me along.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That certainly makes it a challenge, er, interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're trying to distract me aren't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me. Don't give me that look, yes trust me. If I was trying to distract you, you'd know <br />
it. But seriously Julio, if you win, I plan to never reveal to you what form I had figured out <br />
to help me out without Jasmine identifying your true self.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I'm supposed to turn down a work hand for a year who might be able to get into <br />
places I can't for a year for that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been transformed into, nay, -reborn- as a trickster animal spirit, not a sadism animal <br />
spirit. -Don't- tell me you're not the least bit curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I -am- curious. I am. But you gave me a good offer girlie. And I'm not about to turn it <br />
down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How sure are you? When's the next time you could be transformed by a kitesune, and <br />
aren't likely to be left in some random place never to see that kitesune again, or some <br />
other prank that you'd remember till the end of your days but the kitesune would forget <br />
about after their next bottle of Saki?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have such a high opinion of your new people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just realistic. I'll admit, myself and Anna are the only kitesune either of us know so far, <br />
well, japanese kitesune at any rate, whose to say there's more of us in the world? If there <br />
is, maybe we can change the reputation a little.&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm good at 'hacking' as the modern term is, kitesune wouldn't like me much either for <br />
being able to 'undo' their fun and games.&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&quot;Then you should have little to worry about, you have pieces of knowledge of Kami-Sama, <br />
after all, and can undo any transformation I do to you, what are you afraid of?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whose to say I'm afraid?&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one. Oh wait, I did. I apologize. Maybe I've been picking apart your strategies as we've <br />
been chatting, maybe I've been learning your body language as we've spoken, maybe my <br />
kitesune eyes are seeing the reflection of your cards in your eyes... &quot;<br />
<br />
Julio shuddered, &quot;Psychological warfare won't work on me that easily.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I know. But I want to win just as badly as your do, or do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julio shook his head slightly clearing his mind, Keiko had only been a kitesune for a few <br />
days. A few at most! He wouldn't let her get to him. Right?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Say -- say what?&quot; The guard stuttered.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Shaykh Abu Isa placed a paw on the guard's furry shoulder, the guard tensed, a sheik was <br />
touching him!&nbsp; &quot;Just as I said! The shayks of the gulf have an alliance for your king!&quot;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The gate guardians all looked at each other, none of them had been instructions for <br />
anything even remotely like this.&nbsp;The two of them had actually been part of opposing <br />
extremist groups, though they were now perfectly willing and happy to work together in <br />
the service of their king. To be fair, everyone in the group was surprised to see a <br />
cellphone at all. When the vixens had fled, Karther's city had been purely out of the <br />
arabian nights with nothing to collect it with the 20th century onward. Apparently Tamthis <br />
was making a number of improvements and upgrades that would have Karther in <br />
conniptions. <br />
<br />
&quot;Er, is that you, you wish to speak with King Tamthis then?&quot; The guardian said playing it <br />
totally by ear his tail laying low. <br />
<br />
Jasmine herself was rather stunned to hear King -Tamthis- rather than Karther. Yes <br />
Alexandra had said only a dozen times that Karther was no longer in control, but she had <br />
not trusted the word of one of Karther's puppets. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I wish to see your king.&quot; &nbsp;Shaykh Abu Isa, not tripping up and saying 'we' and thus <br />
including his 'wives' in such important 'men's concerns.' <br />
<br />
The two fox men looked at each other again. Shaykh Abu Isa then launched into a fanciful <br />
tale of economics, geopolitical situations, and the price of oil and how it related to <br />
fennecs. Pretty much all of it went over the guard's heads, nearly everything Shaykh Abu <br />
Isa was saying was fiction, but lucky none of the guards present had majored in <br />
economics, and everything Shaykh Abu Isa was saying sounded so reasonable, so rational, <br />
so logical, and so complex they were worried what might happen if those chose to ignore <br />
him over a hunch that they couldn't pin down. <br />
<br />
&quot;You-you may entered honor sheik.&quot; The humanoid desert fox bowed his head. &quot;May you <br />
be able to aid our king in his heroic defense against the evil djinn!&quot; <br />
<br />
And of course, since the sheik was allowed to enter, it went without saying his wives were <br />
as well. The main gates did open to allow in what for all appearance was the the latest <br />
party of arabs to willingly and knowingly accept the transformation into desert foxes <br />
(manipulated by utter and complete lies or not). <br />
<br />
Once inside, Jasmine was speechless. While at first glance the only difference between this <br />
as some middle eastern cities was the fact everyone there was a fennec or a wolf,  only <br />
Jasmine's eyes picked up the sublime sights of various arab customs and traditions being <br />
bent, others perfectly observed, while others flat out ignored. And every single person <br />
there taking it perfectly and utterly in stride without so much as one muscle twitching in <br />
defiance. Jasmine so wanted to kill Karther. <br />
<br />
The deceptively newborn angel meanwhile, look at this city, -truely- looked at it, looking <br />
at the mana and spiritual forces that flowed through it. That was when the truth hit Kyriel. <br />
'The more people the city acquires, the larger it becomes. Wait, 'the city' acquires? <br />
Shouldn't that be 'Tamthis acquires?' Oh right, they're one and the same.' She <br />
remembered, such a short time ago chronologically, but felt like years. Tamthis and the <br />
city were one and the same, Queen Tammia had assimilated the castle, and along with it <br />
all of the traits of Karther even Karther shrunk from: notably his phobia of wolves and his <br />
insanity.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Shaykh Abu Isa meanwhile felt like he was walking through a town full of NPCs from <br />
World of Warcraft with bits of SimCity thrown into the mix. There wasn't even the slightest <br />
hint of conflict going on, everyone simply was doing what they were doing without a <br />
second thought on the subject. They weren't acting quite like he had when he was one of <br />
Karther's robots. But at the same time, these people should have been taking the idea they <br />
were surrounded by members of opposing clans, and that there was supposed an army of <br />
genies out there ready to wipe them with a lot more attention. <br />
<br />
Jasmine whispered in Kyriel's ear, &quot;Can you smell it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I can.&quot; Kyriel whispered back. Kyriel whispered in turn to her four elder sisters, and <br />
then to her once removed brother, &quot;Don't talk to anyone unless you absolutely have to, <br />
keep the discussions as short as possible if you have to, don't get distracted or involved in <br />
anything, or you'll get pulled along and into this place and become just another citizen, <br />
the flow of this place, it has a undertow.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't need to tell me twice,&quot; &nbsp;Shaykh Abu Isa said, &quot;This place is a clam, watch out or <br />
you'll turn into a pearl. And I don't like pearls.&quot; &nbsp;Shaykh Abu Isa shuddered remembering <br />
when Karther had him dress in a all pearl necklace, anklet, bracelet, well everything, while <br />
enjoying the brainwashed and puppetfied Anna for the first time. <br />
<br />
The four sisters stepped in a bit closer to each other. Lisa and Vicki kept an eye on their <br />
companions to make sure they didn't stop something that lured them away and absorb <br />
them into this city's story. Luna and Erica kept their minds focused on what weapons to <br />
summon on a moment's notice they were confronted by Lucy or Natalie. <br />
<br />
Alexandra whispered, &quot;It is beautiful. I can't wait till it's returned to master Karther who it <br />
rightfully belongs to.&quot; But to do that, she decided needed the aid of her sisters and the <br />
angel. Otherwise she could not hope to dethrone the usurper Tamthis! <br />
<br />
&quot;Alexandra look around you,&quot; Kyriel whispered, &quot;Can't you tell these people are -frozen?-&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexandra blinked at Kyriel confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're like parts in a machine now, they haven't been given new lives, they're just <br />
fixtures in a setting!&quot; Kyriel continued. <br />
<br />
Alexandra shook her head, &quot;No, that isn't true, they live, they exist, we all simply exist for, <br />
rather, they -should- exist for their king, not a pretender...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyriel felt the emotions pity and sympathy for the first time, &quot;Alexandra...  think... when <br />
you met me, my mother... you helped her... is that what you were supposed to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &nbsp;Shaykh Abu Isa whispered harshly, &quot;Not the time!&quot; The last thing they needed was a <br />
heated emotional debate that would get everyone's attention! <br />
<br />
Kyriel sighed, but then gentle took hold of Alexandra shoulder, and ever so slightly <br />
pointed (so not to draw attention herself) at Samir's family, the process of them being <br />
asborbed into the city's story only having just begun. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look at them Alexandra.&quot; Kyriel whispered as lowly as she could, &quot;Look at them, you don't <br />
have a spiritual sight, but tell me, what do you see?&quot; <br />
<br />
Luna thought, 'In case guide is possessed by evil city, knock her unconscious.' Readily to <br />
will a sap into existence if Alexandra was accident enslaved by the city. <br />
<br />
Every step that Vicki took inside this city was one full of revulsion. It stank of the king of <br />
desert kitsune, a smell that was sickening to foursome in no small measure. <br />
<br />
Alexandra looked upon Samir's and his two sons and wife as the assimilation of them into <br />
the city's story began. First time she would behold anyone transmuted by her master's <br />
magic (not counting her short time as Tammia's inferior clone) who was already a fennec.</p>
