<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Sera&#39;s mom is coming home and dose not know, that her daughter (Sera) is now in Jason&#39;s 14 year old body, and Jason is now in the poor little 4 year old girl&#39;s body crying his heart out. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sara’s moms POV:<br />
<br />
&quot;I could not believe my daughter left a 4-year-old with her boyfriend. Sure, Jason is nice, but he is not the sort of person you would leave in charge of well anything! He just does not pay enough attention to things, and he will be terrible with a small girl. I can imagine it now—she will be crying on the floor with him looking lost and not knowing what to do about it. <br />
<br />
And of course, when I marched through the front door of my house, I was right. There was the little 4-year-old girl crying on the floor with tear-filled red cheeks, and Jason standing there looking lost with his hand out, doing nothing! <br />
<br />
All I could do was sigh and feel angry with Jason for not even picking her up and trying to comfort her. I thought Sara said he has a younger brother? So I said in a loud and strong voice, hoping that this might teach him a lesson, &#39;Jason, has she been crying all this time? And why are you doing nothing?&#39; and picked the crying 4-year-old up. <br />
<br />
He looked shocked and frazzled. I felt a little sorry for him. It&#39;s obvious that this is a little over his head. He probably hasn&#39;t looked after such a young child on his own before. Then he said in a panicked voice, &#39;I... I don&#39;t know what to do! Mo... uhm... Miss Hall, I... I didn&#39;t even want to do this. Sara just dumped this on me, and I tried to tell her I&#39;m not good with kids this young. And when Sara left, she started to cry, an... and I had no idea what to do!&#39; <br />
<br />
I just sighed and knew how he is when he gets like this. He is always a klutz with responsibility and always gets stressed out and messes up. I&#39;m just happy I got home as fast as I did. But God, this child in my arms is getting worse since I picked her up, screaming louder now? I just need to get her settled with just me and her, that will calm her down. <br />
<br />
So I said, &#39;Well Jason, I guess you did what you could..., so thanks for at least staying with her, and I will tell Sara that you did a good job so you can go home now.&#39; <br />
<br />
After I finished saying that, I thought I saw him smirk, like he didn&#39;t care about the crying baby in my arms, which was probably his fault she is crying like this. But I must have been mistaken because he still had the shocked face, I always see him have when he gets into things like this on still, looking at him now. <br />
<br />
Then he said, &#39;Um... Ok, Miss Hall, I&#39;ll be on my way. Um, thanks for coming back so fast, and Um how you are going to tell Sara I did good and all... bye.&#39; And with that, he walked away, and I walked to the window, still with this crying child in my hands, and saw him cycle off towards his house. I sighed, thinking why can&#39;t he be a little more in control with things? and turned around to take care of the little girl hugging me feeling wet tears on my shoulder. <br />
<br />
I sat down and put the 4-year-old on my lap and said, &#39;There, there, it&#39;s only you and me now. No silly boys are here anymore, so no need to cry anymore. How about we watch a princess movie, and after that have a special bubble bath before bed, huh?&#39; She just screamed louder when I said this, and I knew that if she carried on like this, I am going to have to get more striked with this little loud girl, and knowing Sara is going to owe me! Not telling me I&#39;m going to be sitting a little monster&quot; <br />
<br />
 ….............................................................................................. ..............................<br />
<br />
following Sara going to Jason&#39;s house:<br />
<br />
<br />
Sara couldn&#39;t help but shout out with joy, feeling great cycling to Jason&#39;s house. She did it! She managed to fool her mom into thinking she is &quot;Jason&quot;! And being in Jason&#39;s body, she found she could cycle much faster than she could in her own body. With his stronger legs pumping the pedals, she went faster and faster, not feeling tired at all, it felt amazing! And thinking back to what just happened. <br />
<br />
She never realized how scary her mom could be when she yelled at people. When she shouted at her for not looking after the real Jason crying on the floor, it actually shocked her. Her mom had never treated her like that before. It was definitely an eye-opener to see how her mom could be! <br />
<br />
But she burst out laughing while approaching Jason&#39;s house, remembering seeing Jason in her mom&#39;s grip, crying his heart out and looking just like an upset little 4-year-old girl he is stuck as now, after her mother shouted at her, and grinning thinking, of all the fun Jason is going to have with her mom treating her like the little cute girl he is now. <br />
<br />
And after that thought, she was there, at Jason&#39;s house. She had only ever met him outside of the house and had never been inside. He always said her house was better and never invited her around his house, and she had only met his mom once, with his mom being a woman of very few words,  <br />
<br />
She wondered if he didn&#39;t want her to meet his family or see his room for some reason? But if there is, she is going to meet his family and see his room/inside his house now, and she is going to experience how his family treats him first hand, so there is no hiding anything from her now!  <br />
<br />
So, with a smile on her face, she walked in through the front door and shouted, &quot;I&#39;m Home!&quot;</p>
