<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>CW: Depictions of a form of abuse, with unintentional consent</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked around the room. He looked at the practically glowing lamia body, the suave succubus body, and the stoically composed dragon body. However, between the relative calm, he now noticed the leftover presence; Felia.<br />
<br />
She was currently sitting on the couch, looking at Jeff and Gabe, eyes wide. Though, as soon as she noticed Jeff staring at her, she squeaked a little and tried to hide herself behind a pillow.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a little sympathy, and walked in her direction, thinking to ask her some things.<br />
<br />
Stopping in front of the couch, Jeff leaned forward, &quot;Heya, you&#39;re Felia, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Felia looked at Jeff, wide-eyed, from over her pillow. He noticed her eyes flicking between him and his crotch for a brief second, but after a few slow blinks, she nodded.<br />
<br />
Jeff continued, &quot;Right, and, uh… I don&#39;t have exactly the best memory, but where exactly were you from again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Felia was understandably confused at this question, but it was the truth;<br />
<br />
Jeff was missing some critical memories. There were things that he didn&#39;t write into the chronivac, but which appeared regardless, and that he didn&#39;t get memories of. He wanted to get to the bottom of a few things, to not get blind-sighted again.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-Nippingville, sir.&quot; Felia answered, before hastily adding, &quot;Ah! M-master Jeff!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked back at Gabe, and saw her dragon body glaring continuously at Felia, while the other two bodies were glaring at… him?<br />
<br />
Jeff frowned, and addressed Gabe, &quot;I just wanna ask some questions, don&#39;t worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
This turned her glares into squints. Though, at least the lamia body was satisfied with it, and faced away, continuing her previous task.<br />
<br />
The succubus body persisted to squint, as did the dragon body.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed internally, and turned back to Felia. &quot;And how did you get into Gabe&#39;s service?&quot;<br />
<br />
Felia looked less uncertain at this, and nodded to herself before answering, &quot;My family has been friends for a long time with Miss Gabriel&#39;s family, and I knew I was going to serve some master&#39;s house, but when the b-blessing struck Miss Gabriel, my parents thought it was a good- good exercise to help her with her daily duties and tasks, since with the change, her living situation changed too…&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff blinked and thought it too convenient that Gabe, someone in need of personal assistance, knew a family who were all too eager to throw their daughter under the bus (into an unknown situation). But considering this was what he wrote into the chronivac, the way it happened looked like a &quot;path of the least resistance&quot;, with the least actual changes to reality, and the rest just follow-up effects.<br />
<br />
Jeff hummed. &quot;Hmmm, and when was the first time we met?&quot;<br />
<br />
Felia&#39;s eyes widened. She looked beside him, looking undoubtedly into Gabe&#39;s eyes, and shuddered a little. Before Jeff could turn around and see what was happening, Felia fixed her eyes on him again, and gave her answer, &quot;I-I… I believe Master Jeff and I met during school, when Miss&#39; dragon body was on rotation, and you mused about the nature of our relationship. And… what might have been between me and Miss Gabriel.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this answer, Felia stared at Jef for a while, and he got the feeling that she wanted to tell something else. But before any of that could happen, they were interrupted by the aforementioned dragon body suddenly reaching forward and grabbing Felia off the couch, with a yelp.<br />
<br />
She grunted. &quot;That&#39;s enough. Felia, you&#39;re coming with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
They exited the room, and Jeff looked at the door, utterly confused and bewildered.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<center><b><I>Meanwhile, elsewhere.</I></b></center><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Felia was thrown into the walk-in closet, and flew through tons of dresses before hitting the back wall.<br />
<br />
Gabe was <I>furious</I>, her yellow eyes softly glowing in the relative dark, &quot;You <I>slut!</I> I could feel you becoming wet the moment that you saw Jeff cum in me. You wanted it to be you, didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Felia gave some weak replies, holding out her hands in the direction of her voice, her vision only helping barely in this dark closet. &quot;Miss Gabriel, I-I- Urk!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her throat was suddenly grabbed by a hand from the dark, her eyes burning in her direction, her voice like a whip.<br />
<br />
&quot;DIDN&#39;T YOU?&quot;<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t do much but struggle against her iron grip, she let out a soft moan, then she gulped again and tried to look her in the eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss- I- Didn&#39;t- No, never…&quot;<br />
<br />
Her denials were unheard. The dragon&#39;s body flared up in anger, her nostrils breathing smoke and moisture into the air. Her eyes piercing Felia own, and her claws barely holding back in breaking her skin.<br />
<br />
Gabe was not satisfied, and pressed Felia throat further, bringing herself close, hissing almost directly into the cat-maid&#39;s face. &quot;Sounds like you need to be reminded of your PLACE in this house…!&quot;<br />
<br />
Felia&#39;s eyes widened, and a shiver went down her spine. She responded on autopilot, on instinct, &quot;Y-Yes, Mistress…&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabriel squinted. &quot;That&#39;s Mistress <I>Gabriel</I> to you, your only mistress, have some respect and show some manners, or are you the impulsive worthless slut that you really are?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another shiver, Felia started to try to grab onto her hand around her throat, with futile effort. Felia then nodded at the question, before she caught herself, and corrected by saying &quot;N-No, Mistress… Gabriel!&quot; She hastily added onto the end.<br />
<br />
Gabe gave her another glare, before she removed the hand from Felia&#39;s throat.<br />
<br />
Felia started rubbing her throat, feeling for any bumps or the likes. It was already feeling sore, but it was a kind of sore that she knew.<br />
<br />
Gabriel started to pace in the closet, before suddenly turning around and fixing her gaze on Felia, &quot;Rule one, Felia. Do you remember it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Felia was still rubbing her throat, the collar making small bell noises as she rubbed it back and forth, and she was about to answer the question, before Gabriel sighed and huffed &quot;Unbelievable…&quot;<br />
<br />
She fixed Felia a piercing stare, and hissed in anger, &quot;RULE ONE! Jeff is mine and mine alone. Repeat after me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felia did. In a droning tone, she repeated, &quot;Jeff is mine and mine alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabriel clapped loudly in front of her, making her flinch. &quot;WRONG! Jeff is <I>mine</I> and mine alone, not yours, <I>Mine</I>.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felia&#39;s put on a flustered and embarrassed face, &quot;A-Ah, right, Jeff is… of Mistress Gabriel alone…&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe nodded in satisfaction, and turned around again, &quot;Good, next ru- …are you turned on right now?&quot; Gabe looked over her shoulder, but this time, instead of the usual heat, her gaze was ice-cold.<br />
<br />
Felia felt her stomach dropping, she hadn&#39;t noticed it, but the thought of disobeying Gabriel, and doing something to Jeff, had indeed turned her on.<br />
<br />
Somehow, the dragon body&#39;s height got even more imposing, &quot;Unacceptable, you are literally thinking about Jeff, right in front of me, in the middle of a training session, and it is turning you on. That is unacceptable, Felia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felia felt her knees grow weak, she didn&#39;t know whether it was in excitement or in fear. &quot;B-But Mistress, please, I didn&#39;t-&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe&#39;s words were ice-cold, cutting through her excuses. &quot;That deserves punishment, Felia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just now, Felia felt tendrils of pleasure shoot through her stomach, and as Felia saw Gabriel unbutton her pants again, she felt her stomach drop in anticipation, and fear.<br />
<br />
What came next would definitely take the cake regarding these kinds of &quot;surprises&quot; that she had had from Gabriel, though. Felia saw the dragon body&#39;s crotch reshape to a cock, but one that she was all too-familiar with, by having cleaned it daily. It was <I>His</I> cock, Jeff&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Gabriel began her explanation, &quot;This is as a reminder that I will have something that you can never have. And, that he is <I>mine</I>. Your pussy will never have the real thing, but always know its shape, like I do. Only this time, without any release.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this, Felia felt herself become even more wet. The sudden and abrupt absence of her Chasity belt had already turned her on at its taboo. Though, this time, she definitely felt her heart lurch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Undress yourself.&quot;, Gabe commanded.<br />
<br />
Felia didn&#39;t even hear it at first, as she was staring at the glowing yellow-orange replica dick of Jeff&#39;s shape and size. Felia then looked up, seeing Gabriel&#39;s angry face.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOW.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<center><b><I>Meanwhile, somewhere more comfortable.</I></b></center><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It was deadly silent, Jeff concluded. Gabe was not saying anything.<br />
<br />
Her lamia body was playing with its hair, avoiding Jeff&#39;s gaze. She seems to be furling and unfurling the same patch of hair, like an itch.<br />
<br />
Her succubus body, meanwhile, felt imposing. He didn&#39;t know what exactly it was, but she was in full succubus mode. The Chasity belt seemed like a mere accessory, doing nothing to dampen her angry charisma and dangerously alluring aura, as if she had become the femme fatale.<br />
<br />
She was scowling every so often, in sync with the lamia body&#39;s flinches. She sometimes seemed to stare roughly the same spot on the wall, her blue eyes then glowing more brightly than normal, as if she was looking for something.<br />
<br />
It was still very silent.<br />
<br />
Gabe had stopped trying to ask them what this all was about. When she did answer, she shushed him, or said that she was &quot;busy&quot;, even though these two bodies were sitting here silently, impatiently.<br />
<br />
Jeff noticed the silence had broken a bit, and could hear some muffled… moans? Screams?<br />
<br />
His mind went to a different place, and was concerned for Felia, wherever she was. However, hearing the moans confused and somehow calmed him somewhat. It might be Gabriel&#39;s playmate, or something, that she had brought home from a succubus run and needed to calm down with.<br />
<br />
Or it could be Felia.<br />
<br />
But then why was her succubus body here? Her dragon body was more about power than sex, and so it didn&#39;t make any sense.<br />
<br />
After a while, after the noises had stopped, footsteps could be heard down the hall, and the door to the room opened.<br />
<br />
In came Felia and the dragon body. Felia looked frazzled hair in tangles, her hair flush and tired, and walking with an odd gait, as if she was sore in her legs or behind.<br />
<br />
Behind her, Gabe&#39;s dragon body entered the room, and was holding Felia on a leash.<br />
<br />
<I>A leash.</I><br />
<br />
As if to empathise this, she tugged it, and Felia&#39;s head was pulled down a bit as the bell softly rang on her collar. She looked to smirk, though, as she composed herself in front of Gabriel and Jeff.</p>
