<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carter could feel all the eyes on him as he walked from the parking lot up to his dorm room. He had stopped and gone shopping with his father and had a few shopping bags of clothes hanging from his hands. It would hold him over for now, even if it wasn&#39;t much of a wardrobe. What got him though was the whispering. People pointing and saying things under their breath to the friends or acquaintances as Carter walked along. Rumor spread faster than an STD on most college campuses, and this one was no different.<br />
<br />
He let himself into his dorm room and closed the door behind him with a sigh. Privacy at last. Though even the room felt strange now. Caitlin&#39;s clothes in the closet, pictures of her and her friends on the walls. Carter had decided once he got this body he was going to live as a guy, so some stuff would just have to go. It didn&#39;t mean a whole personality change, but he would say farewell to the old clothes and makeup. Carter started to unbutton the dress shirt that Joey had put on for court. It was the only clothing he had that fit, at least until they went to the store, and Carter always felt weird wearing purchases out of the store, but it was definitely time to change. He wondered if he should send the suit back to Joey&#39;s family, it was his and not Carter&#39;s after all, but that might be rubbing salt in a wound.<br />
<br />
Tossing the dress shirt aside, followed shortly by slacks and boxers, he started digging through the new clothes. He had barely gotten on a fresh pair of boxers where there was a knock on the door. Caitlin was used to dorm mates stopping by, even when she was half dressed and on reflex said, &quot;Come in.&quot;  Not thinking that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh lord..&quot; The young woman who opened the door said as she stepped inside, then turned around. &quot;Naked man.&quot; Vanessa was one of Caitlin&#39;s friends, two years older than her and RA for this floor of the dorm. They had become friends early in the year.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have underwear on.&quot; Carter said defensively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well put on some pants, I don&#39;t need to see that much..&quot; Vanessa, shook her head, still not looking over. Though as Carter dug for a pair of jeans and pulled those on he swore he caught Vanessa peeking over her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Pants on, Vanessa, you can look now.&quot; Carter sat down on his bed with a sigh, rubbing a bare shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, Caity girl, that&#39;s really you in there, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Carter just nodded his head in response. &quot;And the rumors are true? Joey didn&#39;t wake up?&quot; Carter just nodded again. &quot;How you holding up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Worried I made a mistake. I mean...&quot; Carter held out his hands in front of him, big meaty things that would engulf her old hands. &quot;It all feels really strange. Good in some ways, awful in others.&quot; He grabbed one of his pectorals, hefting it like he would have one of his breasts, but it was completely different, and that fuzz on his chest was gonna feel weird for a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girl, if you keep fondling your man body, I&#39;m leaving.&quot; Vanessa said as she picked up a discarded towel and threw it at Carter, who caught it in the face. &quot;Though I gotta say, if it wasn&#39;t you in there, Caitlin... mm mmm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Carter.&quot; Caitlin said as she pulled the towel off her face. &quot;Decided if I&#39;m going to have this body, might as well live it out as a guy, so, Carter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vanessa nodded, &quot;That&#39;s what I came to talk to you about. Check on a friend, yes, but as RA I gotta give you the bad news, too.&quot; She sat in the desk chair and looked over at Carter. &quot;Since this is an all girls floor, you have till the end of the week to find a new spot on campus to live. I already checked on the boys floor, but they&#39;ve had two new additions this week and are out of room. Co-ed dorm ain&#39;t much better. I&#39;ll keep my ear out for you, but you might have to do off campus for the rest of the semester, or see if a girl in the co-ed dorms will trade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.. On top of midterm studying and getting used to a new body..&quot; Carter sighed, and buried his face in his hands. There was another knock on the door and Carter mumbled another, &quot;Come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Not you! She does not want to see you!&quot; Vanessa was on her feet trying to usher out one of the beefiest guys on campus. Mark DeLong, not only was he big, he was a friend of Joey Barsky. Mark was holding up his hands in a warding gesture against the smaller Vanessa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not here to make trouble, other way around, honest.&quot; Mark barely flinched as Vanessa swatted him hard on the arm. Carter could hear the smack, but it was Vanessa that ended up hurting her hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;V. It&#39;s fine..&quot; Carter fixed Mark with a baleful stare. &quot;What do you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we talk?&quot; Mark looked over at Vanessa. &quot;In private?&quot; Vanessa looked over to Carter, but Carter nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you need me Carts, I&#39;ll be just down the hall.&quot; Carts.. already a new nickname from Vanessa. Typical. Mark came into the room and Vanessa headed out, shutting the door behind her with a bit more of a slam than was needed. Mark flinched.<br />
<br />
Mark sighed and leaned back against the door, just staring at Carter as if not really believing what he&#39;s seeing. &quot;You look like him, but you don&#39;t. Joey always had this cocky, douche bag smirk..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark. What do you want?&quot; Carter knew his tone had no patience in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, hear me out.&quot; Mark started as he moved to take a seat at Carter&#39;s desk. &quot;We need each other.&quot; Carter&#39;s eye brows were already going up, and his mouth opening to snap a retort, but Mark quickly kept going. &quot;I know you need a place to live and we need a spot in the frat filled. With Joey gone and Mitch quit on us we&#39;re down to five. Less than six and the frat gets shut down. So you come live with us, we get to keep the frat open and you have a place on campus to live. We won&#39;t even charge you rent this semester, just.. help us keep going.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carter laughed. &quot;Join Joey&#39;s old frat? Why should I? You guys probably backed him up in his plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark was quickly shaking his head. &quot;No, none of us really liked Joey. He was a legacy and bankrolled our keggers with his parents cash so we put up with him. Mitch was the only one that liked him, and he quit on us when he found out we sent the group texts about the condoms to your lawyer. Check with her if you don&#39;t believe me, I sent them myself.&quot; Mark actually looked desperate.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, I can&#39;t be your only option.&quot; Carter was shaking his head again, disbelieving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Joey.. kinda damaged our rep.. like.. a lot. You showing you forgive us would go a long way to help that, too. &quot;The type of guys we want around won&#39;t risk it and the type that don&#39;t mind are the type we don&#39;t want. We made a mistake with Joey, let us make it up to you.&quot; Mark leaned forward. &quot;Please, I&#39;ll do anything. I hated Joey, honest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything?&quot; Carter looked right at Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything.&quot; He echoed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So if I said I wanted you on your knees giving me a blow job in the next thirty seconds...&quot; Carter&#39;s eyes went wide as suddenly Mark was out of the chair and kneeling in front of him, hands on his jeans&#39; fly, unbuttoning the pants. &quot;I was joking...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not.&quot; Mark said, pulling down the zipper of Carter&#39;s pants, he pulled down the waistband of his underwear and fondled Carter&#39;s cock and balls free. His masturbation session last night was one thing, but feeling someone else&#39;s hands on his cock was something else entirely. Mark&#39;s hands were surprisingly gentle as he stroked the shaft, pulling back Carter&#39;s foreskin to reveal the head of his cock.<br />
<br />
Carter put on hand on Mark&#39;s shoulder, meant to halt him. &quot;Mark.. you don&#39;t have to. I didn&#39;t..&quot; But then he felt the warm, wet, interior of Mark&#39;s mouth around the head of his cock and he squeezed Mark&#39;s shoulder with a gasp. &quot;Fuck..&quot; It was so different from having a vagina and being penetrated. This feeling of being completely engulfed in warm pleasure. This was also obviously not Mark&#39;s first time giving a blow job either, he was quickly bringing Carter to climax, his tongue finding all the sensitive spots on his shaft. His balls were being rolled around and tugged on just hard enough to encourage them on and not hurt them.<br />
<br />
Carter felt his back arching and toes curling as he shot his loud into Mark&#39;s eager mouth, who swallowed every last drop of cum from those huge, heavy balls of his. He wiped his mouth on the back of his hand with a shit-eating grin. &quot;Always wondered what that cock tasted like. Perfect size to suck, and damn does it shoot. Not disappointed.&quot; Mark went back to his chair while Carter still sat there with his cock flopped out, balls resting on his bed between his legs. &quot;So?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, one month. I will move in for one month. Either that will give you time to find someone or convince me to stay longer. Deal?&quot; Carter held out his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal.&quot; Mark took the hand and shook it. &quot;Stop by the frat later and I&#39;ll introduce you and show you your room, then we can help you move your stuff over.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carter finally realized he was sitting there still with his cock out when Mark wouldn&#39;t stop leering at it, and quickly shoved it away, fastening his jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;So is it true, despite the body swap your.. preferences haven&#39;t changed.&quot; Mark asked with a curious tilt of his head.<br />
<br />
Carter nodded, &quot;Yeah, so I guess I&#39;m gay now. Which.. seems weird to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then you&#39;ll fit right in. I&#39;ll tell you our frat&#39;s little secret right now. Everyone in it is either gay or bi, it&#39;s the other reason we have trouble finding people. I hope you stick around, you might actually enjoy yourself.&quot; Mark stood and headed out of Carter&#39;s dorm room with only a wave of farewell.<br />
<br />
Carter watched Mark go in silence. Well, really he found himself staring at Mark&#39;s beefy ass wondering what it would be like to.. Carter shook his head to clear it. &quot;God, the testosterone must be getting to me. Never thought about sex this much before..&quot; He took one look around the room and sighed. Might as well get sorting on what was being kept and what thrown out.</p>
