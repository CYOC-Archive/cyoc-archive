<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The light from Toni’s cell phone light illuminated the figure which had attacked her on her way back to her dorm room wasn’t human. He was a he, that part she had right but almost everything else was wrong. The figure didn’t have any cloths aside from a thick belt which had multiple pouches on them. A very thick rope rested on the belt, she would have used it to tie the figure up but she was still too dumbfounded by what was before her. <br />
“That can’t be?” she said as she looked at the blue fur with black tiger strips of a what she could best describe as a cat man. He had a long thick tail, a small amount of blood was still coming from the head wound her foot had given him but she could clearly see the cat like face and pointed ears. “What the hell is going on?”<br />
“WE FOUND HER!” yelled a voice from behind her as Toni turned around to see not another one of these things but seven figures all in a semi-circle around her. None of them where human, the only one she thought was a human at first was the one in the middle but in the light of the phone light she could see the unnatural silver hair and pale skin, the pointed ears made her think of an Elf but that wasn’t possible but neither were the other figures.<br />
One was another cat man but this one with pitch black fur, another was covered with scales and looked like a lizard man. Two of them where centaurs’ actual centaurs and all of them looked way to real. Her eyes darted around trying to take it in, who were these things.<br />
“Stay BACK!!!” she yelled at the top of her lungs as she banished the key, only to gulp when three of the figures pulled long swords and one raised a bow. The others pulled thick pieces of rope. <br />
“Don’t fight…we aren’t going to hurt you.” Reassured the female elf like creature who had pulled a bow and arrow but didn’t raise it toward her. <br />
There was no way Toni could win and she knew that, so she did the only thing she could, she ran. She turned and was about to run when she noticed another group, this one made out of only five more inhuman creatures now surrounded her from the other side. Three of them where tiny figures, only half her size but they where grinning at her showing rows of sharp teeth even while they held short knives in their green skin.<br />
“What the fuck is…” started Toni only to get knocked to the ground from behind. She screamed for help even as they tied her up, she cursed them even bite one of their hands drawing blood, but it was no use. A gag was put in her mouth as she was lifted into the air.<br />
“I’ll take her to the camp.” Said one of the centaurs who now held her in the air. She tried kicking even as she screamed into her gag. One of the little green creatures which the rows of sharp teeth had gathered her bag and the cat man she had beaten up was now sitting up getting checked on by another one of his kind. <br />
Then they where off heading into the woods, after what seamed like forever but had to be only a few minutes at a full gallop they slowed as the area around them became illuminated and Toni saw all these impossible creatures walking around a large camp. She creatures which shouldn’t have been seen outside of movies or TV shows and there where all way to real.<br />
“Got one Captain.” Said the centaur carrying her over his shoulder like a bag. Her feet and arms had been bound and her mouth gagged but she was looking around eyes wide as she saw a figure this one an elf as she knew it walk around and look up at her. <br />
“Great…a young woman just what we are looking for.” Stated the Captain “Put her on cart 4 and we will take her to the city to be selected.”<br />
“Alright.” Said the centaur as he moved on, as they headed into the camp, Toni saw more people. These where actual humans but they where clearly not all from the same university she was from. Some looked homeless, some where dressed in foreign looking cloths and where speaking a totally different language. All of the humans where bound, most where gagged and some where in cages. It reminded her of an image of a slave capture camp she had seen in one of her history books. Finally, they stopped and with a shove Toni was put into the back of a closed wagon. <br />
She was screaming curses at the centaur, but her gag stopped her words from getting out as she glared out at him. He stepped back as a hooded figure moved forward, the hood covered the entire face in shadow but for some reason Toni knew a woman was standing before her. <br />
“Sleep…sleep human.” Said the woman in a strange almost music like tone of voice as Toni felt her eye lids begin to droop. She fought it, she had to fight it but her vision began to blur as the women reached over toward her face, showing her arm which a pure snow white skin with deep blue crystals in them A glowing ball of blue energy was now in her hand. “Sleep…it’s alright…sleep…sleep deep human.”<br />
And like that Toni lost the battle as her eyes closed and sleep claimed her.</p>
