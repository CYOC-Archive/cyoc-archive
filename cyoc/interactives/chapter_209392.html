<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris waited for all the lights to go out to return inside the witch&#39;s home. He was hiding and had placed the little he had stolen in a bush. When the last candle stopped flickering and was snuffed out, he waited about another hour and a half and made his move. The witch had not gone out so John must be inside still. He had seen a flashing light and a few squawks so John must still be within. So silently, stealthily, gathering all of his skills, he busted the lock of a window and crept inside. All was quiet and dark. Good, good. The living room that served for everything except washing-room and bedroom was utterly empty, except for two birds. The goose and a chicken. Weird. He did not recall a chicken. Only a goose. Well, the old woman had probably wanted to secure it against thieves in an attempt to keep her meagre possessions safe. But where was John? Not in her bedroom he hoped and grimaced at the awful idea.<br />
&quot;John? John? It&#39;s me.&quot; he whispered. <br />
No one answered apart from the chicken that flapped its wings and made a racket. Chris tried to shut it up but it didn&#39;t waking up the goose. Chris cackled out louder for John, but it only resulted in the with coming out of her bedroom. In a nightgown and with her wand, she conjured ropes to bind the burglar. He screamed and sitting on the ground, helpless, demanded to know where was his friend.<br />
&quot;Oh, right on your left. He tried to attract to his presence, I do believe.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; he asked, staring at the chicken. &quot;John? Is that really you?&quot;<br />
The chicken squawked in response.<br />
&quot;Not much you could&#39;ve done, even if you had known,&quot; laughed the witch. &quot;But you did brave your fears to comeback for a rescue. You spared me the effort of finding you. Now... What will your punishment be?&quot;<br />
&quot;The stuff I stole from you is stuffed in a bush near the road! Go and check! I&#39;m telling the truth!&quot; he shouted. <br />
&quot;Oh, I believe you. But you are still a naughty burglar. What should I do with you?&quot;<br />
At first, Chris begged but when he saw it would not work, he let out a stream of curses and insults, which did not seen to faze the old woman. She frowned at him, then showed a wicked smile.<br />
 &quot;You are like a little boy. An ill-behaved child. A real brat. And I know just the solution for that! A bit of a tricky spell but you&#39;ll bring happiness to someone for once! More than as you are now! Maybe your new mommy can teach you good manners!&quot;<br />
She did a complex series of waves with her wand and first, Chis felt himself change. The ropes vanished into thin air and he felt himself get weak. he watched in horror as his muscles melted away, replaced by fat. His face seemed to spread and all his body hair fell off. He flail his arms about helplessly and saw how pudgy they had become. He felt pressure on his grain but he had no time to dwell on it. He tried to speak but only incomprehensible gurgles came out of his mouth. John was appalled. From his vantage point, he could see that his friends looked like a sort of adult-sized baby. A giant infant! With another wave of her wand, a sheet-sized cloth, pure white, appeared and wrapped itself on the crotch and butt of Chris, a massive safety pin holding everything in place. The witch laughed as the gigantic baby started crying. In an instant, though a mammoth stork appeared a the door, slipped Chris into a huge cloth and hoisted him up in its beak, only to fly away and disappear in the distance. Only the witch&#39;s laughter resonated in the empty house. <br />
<br />
In what seemed like a flash, the stork crossed unimaginable distances and it flew down as it reached the heart of a jungle. In it lived giant apes with human-like habits. A female felt lonely, having no baby to take care of. She felt very lucky indeed when a stork greeted her by landing and depositing in her arms the long-awaited baby she had dreamed about for so long! He was a bit strange, true, but he was incredibly cute nonetheless. And him being different meant he had to be protected more. Exactly what she wanted! She shrieked in joy. As for Chris, he was appalled. First, a giant monkey greeted him with the purest love in her eyes, taking him in her hands and pressing him against her cheek, cradling him back and forth in large movements and happy grunts as if he was a doll. Then, she placed him in a crib and tied a bonnet to his head. She really thought he was her baby! How humiliating! As he struggled at being treated in such a way, she thought the little darling was hungry and gave him a bottle of milk. Chris spit it back but she seized his head gently but firmly and forced the liquid down his throat. Then it was banana puree. By the time she was done, he felt too full and bloated. His belly had become with the spell already paunchy but it was even worse with this new diet! The ape poked and prodded his belly, seemingly to check if he&#39;d eaten enough. But her big fingers poking and brushing his hairless skin made him squirm and giggle uncontrollably. Since when had he become so ticklish? That seemed to please greatly the ape who continued, cooing and chuckling as she turned her new baby into a giggling, squirming and breathless mess. So much so that when she placed him in his crib again, her baby fell asleep right away.<br />
The next few day heralded what was going to become Chris&#39; torture for years and years to come. His new &#39;mommy&#39; woke him up by tickling his neck or throat. And did she love tickling him! He wasn&#39;t a damn doll, but much more of a tickle toy... The ape gave him the name of &#39;Tickles&#39; and realized that it made her baby very compliant and much, much more obedient. Soon, she had devised lots of ways to take advantage of his soft skin and new sensitive nerves. She approached him twisting a feather between her fingers, uttering &#39;coochie coochie coo&#39; and Tickles knew the house would resonate with his giggles and peals of laughter for hours on end. If he was fussy or considered naughty, she held him up by his diaper and wriggled her index or all fingers at his belly, making him really squirm and laugh. She fed him copious amounts of food, milk and coconut milk, resulting in more weight than before. Tickles was nowhere near the adult human he had been before. The female ape discovered all his weak points, mainly his feet, tummy and armpits. She adored poking his bloated belly and once she took the habit of showing him off in a pram outside her home, all the other females hastily proceeded to gush at him, cooing and finding poking him and tickling him likewise adorable, relishing his hairless skin that meant more squirms and tears of laughter out of him. Chris could not talk. He could only cry, coo and gurgle, and live in a strange world of giant monkeys behaving like people. Ge could only dimly amuse himself with rattles and blocks as he could just sit and crawl. And be unwillingly cute for monkey females who treated him like the most adorable doll, notably when he wriggled his toes or tried to escape away from their tickling touches, prompting more tickled and kisses on his paunchy belly. His penis and testicles had shrunk to the relative size of an infant, and only when talcum powder was spread on his privates and the diaper pinned could he feel the beginning of something down there! His interest in sex was now only a distant memory, much to his adult shame. Even though as time went on this life became increasingly normal, worriedly enough, he always curse the witch, dimly wondering how John was doing and which one had received he worst fate. That witch had certainly cursed him well.</p>
