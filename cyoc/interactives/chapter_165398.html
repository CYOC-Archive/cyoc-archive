<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miss Katie finished orientation, all the basics of womanhood, both the boring stuff and the sexy stuff.  You went through the rest of your first wonderful day at the new order version of Meyers High with glee.  Your favorite part was lunch and recess, because you met up with the boys again.  For lunch, you knew you&#39;d eventually be cooking for them, but for now you didn&#39;t know how, so you just put on an apron and dutifully served.  You sashayed through the lunchroom pleased in the knowledge that every eye was upon you.  There wasn&#39;t a male there who could resist giving your ass a swat or your tits a squeeze after you&#39;d placed his meal before him, and you always made sure to show your gratitude for it with your best sexy wink.<br />
<br />
The tables had been reconfigured to allow room for the girls to kneel underneath and pleasure their men as they ate.  When you were done serving, you took your place beneath Jason with the rest of your harem.  The girls had trays for their own food on the ground, which they were expected to eat quickly while their harem mates covered for them in pleasing their male, unless of course they could make eating sexy.  Indeed, most of the female food was phallic in shape, such as hot dogs, to better accommodate this.<br />
<br />
You felt sorry for the girls that had no harem mates.  They had a heavy workload, and lesser males to serve.  You thought it was sad, really, but you watched one such girl looking into her man&#39;s eyes with total devotion as she swallowed his cock, her food as yet untouched as he lazily chewed at a corn cob, and you knew she&#39;d never thought to question her duty.  Suddenly you felt guilty for your thought.  It was inappropriately uppity for a female.  As penance you resolved to work extra hard to please Jason during this lunch, and give no thought to anything else until he&#39;d cum at least twice.  Your tongue worked his shaft from the left while Joy worked it from the right.  Prissy and Kitty were engaged in a sexy dance with some lesbian play thrown in for his visual pleasure, and Layla practiced repressing her gag reflex as she swallowed hot dogs whole.   Fortunately, it wasn&#39;t too hard to get him to cum twice.  Super stud that Jason now was he achieved 2 orgasms without even going soft at all.  You noted with pleasure that some of his cum had fallen into your food, and as Kitty came to take your spot you finally got your meal in.<br />
<br />
Recess was even better.  The boys got competitive with a sound meter and had a competition of who could make their girls scream the loudest.  Jason won, with flair.  Not only did he score the loudest, but he scored it three times since he had a girl in each hand with fingers up their pussies as he fucked a third with his cock.  <br />
<br />
He hadn&#39;t chosen you, though.  You still had only felt his cock inside of you once, and before it had reached its now gargantuan size.  You ached to feel his full power, but you were determined not to bother him with something like that.  He knew your lust, obviously.  Anyone could see your pussy dripping as you watched him fuck your sisters, but for some reason he chose not to claim you yet.  It wasn&#39;t up to you to question that.  It was up to you to serve.  You wanted to be a good girl.  After that you went back to girl classes.<br />
<br />
Finally the day reached its end, and you and the school was once again gathered in the auditorium, this time cheering loudly as principal Kellers took the stage.  He was everyone&#39;s hero now.<br />
<br />
You were backstage with the rest of the squad, watching things on a tv screen.  Jason was brought on stage and declared the Exemplary Student of the Month, and allowed to help lead the ceremonies. Miss Katie stepped up to lead the girls in the Pledge of Subservience.  She knelt before Principal Kellers as she delivered it.  You knelt as well, wishing that you were with Jason to kneel before him directly, but since you couldn&#39;t do that you just knelt towards the screen. You spoke the words like they were sacred.  They defined you and your entire purpose in life as a female.  Then Katie finished and you watched Kellers reward her with a big load of cum on her face.  She smiled as she licked her lips.  You watched Kitty, the only member of your harem not on the cheer leading squad, take Jason&#39;s load.  She looked so happy and proud, and you tried not to be jealous.  Of course she wasn&#39;t on the squad because she wasn&#39;t stacked like you, so she was probably jealous of you, but you thought her petite body and tiny breasts were hot in a different way.<br />
<br />
But now it was your time to shine.  You picked up your pom poms, marshaled the rest of the squad, and as the music reached its zenith you all and rushed out into the auditorium.  Unfortunately none of you knew how to cartwheel or anything yet, but as you skipped and pranced around in your oh so sexy uniforms the boys roared with approval.  Deciding you had to give them *something* special, you ran towards the crowd, and then fell into a butt-slide across the ground that ended with your legs wide open in a split, legs spread not across the ground, but right up in the air so that everyone could see your girlhood clearly.  You hoped it looked graceful enough, even if you felt clumsy.  Clumsy or not the boys gave you a standing ovation.  You were rather surprised you could do a full split so easily.  Apparently you were more flexible as a girl. Following your lead Mindy and Joy did standing splits, each holding one leg high in the air to reveal their own girlhoods as they stood on your right and your left.  You all grinned as you noticed tents beginning to be pitched in pants in appreciation of your performance.<br />
<br />
The celebration was a grand end to the best day of your life, even if it was the first day, at least since you were reborn as Jessica.  As the festivities neared their end, principal Kellers took the microphone.   &quot;Now, as you leave do remember to pick up your enchanted gas grenades.  To refresh on earlier briefings:  The gas has a wonderful effect of altering reality so that everyone of the old order world will remember you as always having been your current sex and will treat your animal traits as normal.  However, they will NOT understand or accept the new order yet.  Your parents will expect you to behave as &quot;normal&quot; boys and girls.  So our lovely ladies will unfortunately have to change into some more modest uniforms.  You are to play along with the old order for now, until I am ready to topple it.  Your gas grenades are for emergencies only, to transform those find out the truth.  Well, that&#39;s it kids.   Have a great day.&quot;<br />
<br />
After school was dismissed, you were wearing a more modest uniform as you walked with Jason and the girls towards your cars to drive home.  &quot;Master,&quot; said Prissy, &quot;Are we allowed to fuck other males, or no?  Just in case something happens while we&#39;re apart, we need to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;yeah sure, whatever.&quot; said Jason.  You looked at your harem-mates with concern. You didn&#39;t care that he wasn&#39;t paying that much attention to you.  His smarter male brain was probably occupied with important things.  But you could tell there was something unsettled in your Master, but none of you knew what to do about it.<br />
<br />
 You looked up him with worry as you hazarded a guess at what troubled him.  &quot;Master, if we have to keep up this old order charade, then that means you have to go back to your horrible father.  I can&#39;t bear the thought!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason looked at you strangely for a second, various emotions ranging from confusion to pain to even rage playing out on his face.  &quot;It&#39;ll be fine,&quot; he said as his face was once again controlled.  &quot;I&#39;m big enough now that he wouldn&#39;t dare mess with me, and I&#39;ll keep myself entertained with thoughts of the day I&#39;m balls deep in his pussy.&quot;  The harem smiled at that, and told him how strong and brave he was, and then you all gave him reluctant goodbye kisses before heading to your individual cars.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t feel right, driving a car, and with no man around to serve.  It didn&#39;t feel right when you stopped for a snack at a fast food place and the male worker treated you with the deference due a customer.  In a sense he was acting as if he was beneath you, but you couldn&#39;t imagine anything more wrong than the idea of a male being beneath a female.  You&#39;d rather be on the ground with your tray than watching the twisted sight of him bring your food to you with a smile. But you couldn&#39;t speak or act or dress as you wanted, or all could be lost.   You took some small joy when you noticed his eyes had moved to your breasts.  You couldn&#39;t resist to press them out and smile at him, but nervously and with shame he turned his gaze away, and you almost wanted to cry.  You consoled yourself with the idea that this wasn&#39;t a true male anyway.  All the males of the old order were destined to become females, and that was no doubt their true nature.  That was why they didn&#39;t dominate and command as they should.  They&#39;d be happier when they were awakened to their femininity. <br />
<br />
As you were leaving, one guy came up to you and tried to hit on you. &quot;Hey there, sugar tits,&quot; he said &quot;what&#39;s a sexy thing like you doing in a place like this?  From the looks of you I&#39;d say you&#39;d fit better in a strip club.&quot;<br />
<br />
You knew how you were supposed to react.  You knew his words weren&#39;t even entirely sincere and he was just &quot;being an asshole&quot; and trying to get a reaction out of a girl for kicks, and you were supposed to be outraged, but his words were the nicest sounding words you&#39;d heard since leaving school.  &quot;Sugar tits&quot; was such a sweet way to address a girl, and every Meyers girl wanted to be something like a stripper when she grew up.  In your confusion you just muttered something beneath your breath and timidly moved to leave, but then some stupid white knight interpreted your behavior as fear and shame, and started demanding the first guy &quot;apologize to the lady.&quot;  The whole store gathered to support the white knight, and you just wanted to scream that it was all wrong, but you quietly made your escape and returned to your car.<br />
<br />
You went home, and things were similarly weird with mom and dad.  In your memories of them you&#39;d been male, but you knew they now remembered you as a female bunny girl.  At least their relationship was SOMEWHAT close to what you now saw as normal, because your father was rather dominant over your submissive and traditional housewife of a mother.  You busied yourself with doing the dishes to make yourself feel better, and Daddy&#39;s kiss on your cheek as you removed his plate from the table felt nicely dominant.  &quot;And get me a coffee, would you sweetie?&quot;  He said after you&#39;d taken the plate away.  When you happily Yes-sir&#39;ed him and moved to make the coffee, your mother noticed it as odd though. <br />
<br />
 &quot;What&#39;s gotten into you, Jessica?&quot; She asked.   &quot;You&#39;re usually not so well behaved.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s wonderful,&quot; said your father, &quot;Don&#39;t discourage her, Violet.  She&#39;s just being a good girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daddy was right, of course, and you felt a new appreciation for him, especially as you watched your mother submit to his will on the matter.  He commanded her, almost like a real new order man would!  Maybe there were one or two decent males in the old order.  You wondered if there was any chance he might be allowed to keep his manhood.  Of course as he was now, he wasn&#39;t worthy to be a new order male, but if he took another male&#39;s manhood, then he could be.  You&#39;d have to find a way to respectfully forward that suggestion to Kellers, though it didn&#39;t seem appropriate for you to approach him directly.  You knew that wasting his time with the ideas of a female mind was the last thing Kellers wanted to do, and understandably so, but you felt you just had to try.</p>
