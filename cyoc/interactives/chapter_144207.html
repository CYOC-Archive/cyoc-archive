<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I told my girlfriend she would get bored doing something she had no interest in, like my work, for example. We couldn&#39;t detach, we would have to find help, without any idea how. So instead, while I was behind my desk, filing papers and entering stuff into databases, she was beneath my desk, out of anybody&#39;s view, looking up solutions for our problems.<br />
<br />
She had asked me to take off my high heels and my socks upon taking a seat in my desk chair. Next, my feet had bloated up, morphing into the top half of a young-adult woman going by the name of Zoey. Her elbows and my feet were attached to one another, so that she could still somewhat freely move her lower arms, and her hands with that. Her torso had formed only halfway through, to right below her chest area, and she had left her butt and legs out of the picture.<br />
<br />
Given that clothes didn&#39;t alter with our changes, she was still buck naked above her middle, so basically completely naked, to the extent she could be.<br />
<br />
The occasional peek underneath my desk gave me a view of her marvelous round breasts and erect nipples, granting me some excitement in a boring day job such as the one I was working now.<br />
<br />
Working on my papers, I felt some of my concentration falter.<br />
<br />
Erect nipples...<br />
<br />
My vagina twitched. I groaned.<br />
<br />
I peeked below my desk again, still seeing Zoey with her eyes glued on her phone screen. She took notice of my presence though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hooray for company WiFi right?&quot; She said with a grin. She bit her lower lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Zo&#39;, exactly what are you watching?&quot; I whispered back. The muscles in my groin twitched again, I squirmed slightly in my seat.<br />
<br />
She turned the screen so it faced me. It was playing a Lesbian porn video.<br />
<br />
&quot;My favorite,&quot; she replied. As her horny smile grew wider. I blushed at the sensation in my sex, taking note that Zoey hadn&#39;t formed her own parts to satisfy her enjoyment. <br />
<br />
I shook my head from side to side in frustration. I had to snap out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it, Zoey,&quot; I cussed, &quot;have you even tried looking for a solution of our problem? You&#39;ve been doing sex stuff all fucking day already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; she said, &quot;only when we woke up?&quot; The last part came out as a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that was not even two hours ago.&quot; I hissed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah?&quot;<br />
<br />
Someone behind me.<br />
<br />
I hit my head against the bottom of the desk, and cursed once more, then I turned to face them.<br />
<br />
Jim, my colleague. Either he was really complimentary, or he had a hell on a crush on me, despite knowing I was lesbian. Him being a christian didn&#39;t exactly help for me either. It was as if he tried to make me straight again. <br />
<br />
He was looking at me only, thank fuck he hadn&#39;t noticed Zoey. Had that been the case, I bet he would bring a priest into the firm right this instance.<br />
<br />
I rubbed the back of my head at the sore spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; I asked. My toes curled as Zoey was absorbed back into my body again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen you in a dress. Something new you bought? It looks nice on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gee, thanks. It was Zoey&#39;s idea. I just thinks it makes me look like some conservative country lass.&quot;<br />
<br />
His face fell slightly at the mention of my girlfriend&#39;s name, I pretended not to notice. When he didn&#39;t continue the conversation, I asked: &quot;Anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
He recovered, then handed me a small pile of papers.<br />
<br />
&quot;The boss said I had to give you these. I&#39;ve got my own share. We need to finish them by the time our shifts end.&quot;<br />
<br />
I took the papers, and thanked him. Upon turning to my work again, I felt goosebumps as the skin right between my collarbones parted, forming a second mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was up with him?&quot; Zoey asked silently, in some slightly crooked version of my voice. She was using my vocal cords again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was Jim, the guy I keep telling you about. The &#39;waiting until marriage&#39; guy.&quot; My voice was just as crooked now.<br />
<br />
Zoey laughed. &quot;Right, him. Waiting until he has sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all. Until he confesses.&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
Some more silent chuckles. She had noticed me looking around. She was likely looking through my very eyes.<br />
<br />
As reward for her good behavior, I opened a bag of chips.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think we need to eat for two as well?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
We shrugged. &quot;Dunno,&quot; Zoey said, &quot;I&#39;m only seeing one body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, right.&quot; I brought a chip to the base of my neck. &quot;Open wide.&quot; I told my girlfriend.<br />
<br />
That sensation weirded me out.<br />
<br />
_____<br />
The rest of the work day went smoothly. I could work mostly uninterrupted, talking to some of my colleagues during break time, but making sure I kept to myself for the rest of my time. The Jimmy encounter was the only time someone had approached me instead of the other way around, so I wasn&#39;t surprised by anybody afterwards.<br />
<br />
Well, until the bus ride home. Some seats were empty, including the one beside mine. But there were still enough people around me that her actions could cause a ruckus. It was that moment where Zoey took her opportunity.<br />
<br />
I was just relaxing with my headphones on, listening to some music, when a my bra shifted and the imprints of two hands showed atop my boobs. I quickly covered myself up with my jacket, silently querying just what the fuck Zoey was thinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huhhh? You don&#39;t wanna?&quot; She asked through my mouth. &quot;Bummer.&quot; Her hands merged with my skin again and disappeared.<br />
<br />
I silently waited. I knew I hadn&#39;t heard the last of her yet. That basically WAS her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, what did you think I made you wear that dress for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Something slid right beneath the surface of my skin. Two small appendages shaped themselves right above my sex, going completely unnoticed through the fabric. I felt how two slender fingers caressed my vaginal lips, tickling and rubbing gently.<br />
<br />
I slowly closed my legs, looking around me with an embarrassed expression. The lips of my mouth were spread thin and white, my face flushed, my eyes wide open. <br />
<br />
Nobody batted an eye. They were way too fixated on their books and phones.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes more of this, her timing was perfect.</p>
