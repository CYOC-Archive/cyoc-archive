<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey there big guy,&quot; Jeff said, as he approached Paul.<br />
<br />
The greeting caught him off guard, almost making Paul drop his phone. &quot;Sup,&quot; he tried to act casual. &quot;You&#39;re late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. I know,&quot; Jeff dismissed it. &quot;I had something come up. But I&#39;m here aren&#39;t I?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You guess?!&quot; Jeff acted offended as he poked at Paul&#39;s sides. &quot;Woah man... When&#39;d you get so tight?&quot; The poking turned into more of a groping session as his hands went up and down the bigger man&#39;s sides. &quot;Is that all muscle? Flex for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
 Paul felt weird as Jeff just kept feeling him up. Those smaller hands running up and down his arms just felt weird. It moved towards his chest and down his abs. &quot;Hey!&quot; Paul jumped back as Jeff kept going lower. For a second Paul imagined Jeff pulling down his shorts right then and there until he remembered that he was right in the middle of a fair. He quickly swatted the idea away and Jeff stopped what he was doing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you&#39;ve definitely gotten bigger. How tall are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;6&#39;4&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Idk... Like 249ish last time. But that was like a month ago,&quot; Paul said.<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled at his arm. &quot;Don&#39;t care.&quot; He quickly brought him over to someone shouting, &#39;Guess your weight! Guess your age! Guess your height! One wrong guess and you win a prize!&#39; They stopped in front of the barker and Jeff folded his arms. &quot;You think you know how much he weighs?&quot; pointing up to his bigger friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think I do, Just $3 and I can tell ya,&quot; the barker smiled. &quot;Off by more than 5 pounds and you win a prize.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Jeff said. &quot;What&#39;s he weigh?&quot;<br />
<br />
The barker moved forward, putting his hand against his chin. He quickly looked up and down the football player taking in all sorts of information. &quot;Hmmm... Let&#39;s see. Let&#39;s see... You&#39;re quite an athletic fellow. Plenty of muscle. A bit of bulk. Need a shirt that actually fits you... But I think I got it!&quot; he quickly wrote down a number on a piece of paper and handed it to Jeff. &quot;Now step on that scale over there and we&#39;ll have your friend here see if I&#39;m right!&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul does as he&#39;s told and faces toward the small group of people gathering around them. They all seemed interested as the barker made sure to raise his voice for their attention. The needle on the scale quickly moved. Jumping well past 200. But still quickly climbing up past 250. Then even higher. 260? No. 270? No. It bounced back and forth around 282. &quot;And we have a number!&quot; the barker called out. &quot;Let&#39;s see how close I was,&quot; then pointed at Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;284,&quot; Jeff read the number.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT!&quot; Paul shouted. That was a good 30 pounds heavier than he should have been. He quickly turned around to see the number bouncing around the 282 mark. &quot;No way...&quot; he muttered.<br />
<br />
The barker got closer, struggling to put his arm over Paul&#39;s shoulders. &quot;You&#39;re a big man. But I think I know your height too. If I&#39;m even 1 inch off you win a prize. How about it? Just three more dollars.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal,&quot; Jeff fronted the money.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you. Thank you,&quot; the barker said. &quot;Now don&#39;t slouch. Stand up nice and tall.&quot; He prodded Paul in the back, making his back stand up straight. &quot;Hmmm...&quot; he went through the motions again, standing on his tip toes and raising his hand above Paul&#39;s head. A bit more of a crowd was starting to form as they watched the normal sized man size himself up next to someone a good head taller than him. &quot;I&#39;ll have to say... 6&#39;7&quot;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Six... Seven..?&quot; Paul breathed. That was three inches taller than he should have been. Was that why his clothes just fit him all wrong. Why his shoes were so tight. Even the sandals felt uncomfortable, despite being open air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Step against the ruler and let&#39;s see what we&#39;ve got,&quot; the barker lead Paul back to the ruler. He breathed. &quot;Oh no! I seem to have been mistaken. This man is actually 6&#39;8&quot;!&quot; He called out. &quot;Oh blast it all! I guess I can&#39;t win them all. Choose a prize on the lower shelf. Now you...&quot; He pointed to another person in the crowd and went through his spiel again. <br />
<br />
Jeff grabbed one of the small stuffed animals and went over to Paul. &quot;See? You&#39;ve grown. A lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Paul stumbled slightly as he walked next to Jeff. He suddenly had a bit of vertigo as he looked down at the ground. Jeff seemed so much further away than before. How could he be that tall? How could he weight that much?<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah there big guy!&quot; Jeff tried his best to support him. &quot;You go down, I don&#39;t think anyone can get you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;R-right,&quot; Paul muttered. &quot;Just... Just let me sit for a second.&quot; They found a bench and Paul sat down. His hands clutched his head. &quot;Dude... What the fuck&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff shrugged his shoulders, then looked around as though that might hold the answer. &quot;Dude! What if it was the wish?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The wish?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YEAH! The wish! You said you wanted to a really big football player. And look,&quot; Jeff pointed down at his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you wished that all the guys on the football team wanted to fuck you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was a joke and you know it!&quot; Jeff shouted. He quickly calmed himself down. &quot;Besides. You&#39;re on the football team. Do you want to fuck me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no!&quot; Paul forced out. He suddenly felt the pang of embarrassment at the feelings he&#39;d been having over the last day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly. But what if your wish did?&quot; Jeff smiled. &quot;What if it actually could grant you wishes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know..?&quot; Paul muttered. &quot;That sounds too good to be true...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude. I&#39;m going to go try it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Paul could say anything Jeff had already darted over there. Paul started to wonder if Jeff might have been right. It didn&#39;t make any sense how he was able to grow this much. Even if he hadn&#39;t weighed himself in a while. It just didn&#39;t make sense. Then he saw Jeff standing in front of the wishing machine. His mind drifted off into a fantasy. &#39;What if Jeff wished to be my perfect fantasy?&#39; he thought to himself. Even Paul wondered a little bit what that might have been. But the loud, &quot;YOUR WISH WILL BE GRANTED, SOONER OR LATER,&quot; brought him back to reality. Before he knew it, Jeff was jogging back over to him with a broad smile on his face.</p>
