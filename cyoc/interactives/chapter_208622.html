<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Overcome by his new urges and newly felt power, Damon could not resist the urge of spitting more flames. But as a new dragon, he could not master his own fire and set the roof of the witch&#39;s barn ablaze. The chickens and hens of the chicken coop right next to it cackled wildly and fled or banged themselves on the fence. The witch screamed and with a wand made a dark cloud appear right above the barn and an immediate downpour put out the flames.<br />
&quot;You idiot!&quot; she glared at Damon. &quot;I have important and dangerous ingredients in there!&quot;<br />
Damon was sorry, really. But as a prince, he was unaccustomed to be scolded. He was a royal! Unlike this old hag! And he was a dangerous dragon now anyway.<br />
&quot;Do not raise your voice at me, old hag! I said I was sorry! Unlike you&#39;d like being burnt to crisp! Don&#39;t forget I am still royalty! A prince!&quot; he bellowed as he belched another torrent of flames at the sky.   <br />
&quot;And you don&#39;t have any powers, all prince that you might be,&quot; she grunted. &quot;Unlike ME.&quot;<br />
She waved her wand in rage and before Damon could understand what was happening to him, he felt blown away by a tremendous gust of wind. The last thing he heard were the witch&#39;s words.   <br />
&quot;I cannot change you being a dragon, but I can bring you down a peg or two!&quot; she laughed.<br />
<br />
Damon felt himself land in grass, head over claws. As he got up, he could see he was in a desolate grassy and rocky plain. In the distance, to the east, he could see the dim outline of a forest. In the north, some huge white cliffs that indicated the southern border of his own kingdom. Wow! He must be far! That stupid old woman just blew him out of her sight. He snickered in scorn. As if that impressed him! But as he started walking, deciding on lunching on something, he noticed something. His scales were different. Their color was no more black but soft hues of pink. As he looked about himself, he could see he was pink all over. And he looked smaller. Thinner and with a ton of less muscles, certainly! Very frightened, he bent his head towards his crotch and his worse fears were confirmed. Gone! His virile member and testes were gone! His privates! His manhood! Gone! Disappeared! Only a slit remained! A privacy was there new! A cunt! He had a cunt and was bright pink! He was a girl! The witch&#39;s last words resonated in his mind and he stared at his reflection from a nearby river. From what he could see, it was just as bad as the rest of his body! A sweet young reptilian face and baby blue eyes! He was a dainty delicate damsel dragonness! He had to go back home and force the witch to give him back his original male dragon shape! He couldn&#39;t stay so girly! No knight or peasant would take him seriously! But the way back to the castle was so far and the day had already been so long... He decided to sleep first and then travel back. Hopefully he wouldn’t meet many people...<br />
 <br />
Damon slept all through the afternoon and the night. But unbeknownst to him, the spell of the witch was already invading his mind. She had bewitched him not only to be a girly dragon but to act like one too. His new dragon instincts would do the rest. So Damon dreamed of a comfy pillow with four posters supporting a frilly canopy with bows. The best bed to rest on, surely! And a collection of dolls and soft toys too! Perfect to decorate a cave! With offerings of sweeties and chocolates to munch on. Then he could capture pretty princesses or cute girls of noble or bourgeois descent to have tea parties and have baths and play and sew and engage in fun activities of the sort. And if a knight came, well, he&#39;d make a cute princess replacement. Or giant doll. How fluffy and enchanting! <br />
<br />
Damon woke up with a start and shook his deer-like head. What was that? What a nightmare! He tried to forget how well and happy he had felt as he actually dreamt the dream. It must just the pink getting to him. He shook himself and grumbled. Time to get on the way. He&#39;d find the witch again, even if the trip was long and he&#39;d force her to change him back. He&#39;d threaten her easily. He was a prince after all! No one said no to him! Even with long lashes and a dainty pink body and vagina!<br />
&quot;Good morning, my lady.&quot;<br />
Damon jumped and turned around. A short distance away was standing a massive dragon, grey, with spikes, red eyes gleaming with interest and very sharp teeth. He made a little sophisticated bow and just then the delicious smell of roasted goat and honey reached Damon&#39;s nostrils. <br />
&quot;May I be so bold in asking what a fair dainty damsel such as yourself is doing in such a dismal place so unbecoming of her sweet appearance?&quot; <br />
Damon would have scoffed if he hadn&#39;t been so utterly humiliated by the turn of phrase. After all this dragon DID look fearsome and strong. Much more than him, now. It was the way he had been taught to address coy ladies at court! And now he was the one being talked to like that? Another humiliation to add to the ever-growing list!<br />
&quot;I... Well... Er... I mean... Er... I...&quot; he stammered.<br />
&quot;Yes, dearest?&quot; smiled mischievously the male dragon. <br />
Good grief, were that his shaft and testicles down there? They were bulging and enormous! Why couldn’t he have that? Why did he have to contend himself with a cunt? <br />
&quot;I got lost,&quot; said Damon in a tiny voice.<br />
No need explaining to the other bigger dragon he was a guy. That might turn ugly and violent.<br />
&quot;This saddens me profoundly, my delicate lady,&quot; said the dragon.<br />
Even though his tone was sincere, the glint in his eyes did not disappear. A glint not of violence but of interest and perhaps lust. Now that worried Damon. <br />
&quot;Whereof do you hail from, then?&quot;<br />
&quot;Erm... Far... A storm brought me here... Not too long ago...&quot;<br />
There. Better stay evasive.<br />
&quot;Where are your kin? They must be worried sick. Let me help you find them,&quot; he said, his tone dripping with solicitude and approaching.<br />
No. Wrong idea. No way they&#39;d recognize Damian. Not with a clone at home anyway. Right, because an impostor had taken his place to top things off! <br />
&quot;I don&#39;t have a family anymore. Well, they won&#39;t notice I am gone because they forgot all about me and...&quot;<br />
&quot;A damsel in distress!&quot; said the dragon in a voice of exaggerated despair. &quot;Now that won&#39;t do! Have a fine meal first, my dearest.&quot;<br />
He handed Damon the honeyed roasted goat, which Damon ate quickly. Gods, he was famished! And it was so tasty, crunchy and juicy and sweet! He enjoyed every bite of it, leaving only well-picked bones. <br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said gratefully.<br />
&quot;My pleasure,&quot; the grey dragon smiled. &quot;But in all that excitement, I fear I forgot to ask you your name. Myself am Ferocious. And what is your pretty name, dearest?&quot;<br />
Damon was getting really annoyed at being called &quot;dearest&quot; at every other sentence but he had to put up with this humiliation if he wished to get away. Was he that annoying when he talked to women? No, he couldn&#39;t be! Women loved when he talked to them like that! They blushed and simpered at him afterwards, fluttering their eyelashes! He couldn&#39;t be as cocky as this overgrown lizard, could he? No way! At any rate, all girls fawned over him because of his regal charisma and... Oh. The girls felt flattered by his words because he was a prince. Heir to the throne and great riches and all of that. He must have looked as moronic as the grey dragon&#39;s courteousness sounded to his ears! Well, he didn&#39;t care! He&#39;d keep his pink toys, soft toys and doll treasure for himself and that would be the end of that! Wait... Since when did he have a collection like that? And why would he, for that matter? But how would he justify having a male human name to this great big monster?  <br />
&quot;Er... Damon but it&#39;s not...&quot; he fumbled.<br />
&quot;Diamond? How appropriate!&quot; the grey dragon exclaimed. &quot;You truly are a jewel! A gem!&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks...&quot; Damon mumbled, at a loss.<br />
&quot;How about you rest in my humble abode, my precious jewel?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, I...&quot;<br />
&quot;But I insist!&quot; said the dragon with a hard steel-like glint in his eye. <br />
Damon, now Diamond, did not want to vex him. And what could he do in front of this muscular behemoth of a lizard?<br />
<br />
So he followed in the air the grey dragon until they reached in large cave complex underground.<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you afraid people might get in?&quot;<br />
&quot;No human would dare!&quot; he guffawed. &quot;I&#39;d find them eventually and torture them before burning them to ashes and charcoal!&quot;<br />
He then added with a sly grin.<br />
&quot;When I need to go out for long, I just push a large boulder in front the entrance.Now let me show you my treasure.&quot;<br />
He pushed the boulder back in place, adding that with this, no human would come and bother them. He then lit torches and showed his hoard to Damon, which consisted in a collection of swords. Damon was impressed. Many were finely wrought, ancient and true objects of art. His father and the military men of his kingdom would have killed to get their hands on these!<br />
&quot;Your hoard consists in... swords?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes indeed. My passion.&quot;<br />
&quot;But... Don&#39;t you have a treasure?&quot;<br />
A pile of gold would have been a bit more practical and easier to reinvest in something.<br />
&quot;Of course I do! To buy swords with other humans or dragon that collect coins or gems or golden dishware. What do you collect, dearest?&quot;<br />
Damon was at a loss. Except for gathering privilege and tasks he hated, the only thing he had bothered collecting were things he could get away with and girls. He then thought about what he would collect so as to give a reasonable story to the big male dragon. Except he was not prepared for what his brain automatically came out with.<br />
&quot;Soft toys! Tea sets! Beautiful dolls! Princess dresses! Bows!&quot;<br />
Where the hell did that came from?<br />
&quot;A fine delicate damsel such as yourself would not do otherwise for sure,&quot; the dragon smiled. &quot;Where is your hoard? We can go retrieve it.&quot;<br />
Damon was appalled. Why had he said that?<br />
&quot;I... I&#39;m just starting and...&quot;<br />
&quot;A fine start indeed. Revealing of good taste,&quot; he smiled anew. <br />
The dragon then showed Damon his treasure. The real one. Damon thought it could about rival his parents&#39; own riches. It was interesting to see but he was still in the company of a gigantic male dragon.<br />
&quot;Thanks for the tour&quot; he said. &quot;I should be off. You know, things to do.&quot;<br />
The grey dragon sat on its haunches and gathered his tale around his haunches. He looked hungry. A lustful sort of hungry. Like when Damon bothered street girls with his rich snotty friends.<br />
&quot;Like robbing a sewing or dress store? Or a doll store?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; said Damon, grasping at any excuse to get away fast.<br />
&quot;You should stay. Wait until morning. After all, the stores won&#39;t disappear by then.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, I...&quot;<br />
&quot;I insist,&quot; said the grey dragon as he stepped forward, his eyes glaring with lust.<br />
Damon had enough time to see that his penis had fully emerged from its sheath and was throbbing and twitching. Oh no... He turned around but was quickly blocked by the boulder covering the entrance. To not let any humans in, right... More like keeping him in! He tried to press against the rock alas it did not budge. The big dragon caught up with him without any difficulty and grabbed Damon by the nape of the neck through his teeth and dragged him towards another set of tunnels. Damon could feel the great bulge of the male dragon&#39;s penis bump against  his thigh, letting a trail of pre-cum splatter his scales. Ugh... Disgusting! <br />
The dragon dragged his new mate to a large cave with pelts. As soon as they were in the middle of the improvised bed, Ferocious let go of his grip but pinned him down. He was already panting and his penis was touching Damon&#39;s body in a way that was way too close to his vagina. Ferocious hissed that he was magnificent, beautiful and delicious to smell. He couldn&#39;t wait to mate with her and leave the biggest clutch of eggs in her that his dearest could ever imagine. Damon grew desperate and decided to tell the truth, consequences be damned. It could not be worse than that!<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a guy! A dude! I swear! I used to be a prince until a witch cursed me! I&#39;m a guy!&quot;<br />
Ferocious chuckled and playfully patted his new partner&#39;s cunt.<br />
&quot;That looks female enough for me.&quot;<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m not a girl!&quot;<br />
&quot;You are now. Good enough for me. Regardless, you admitted to liking dainty cute girly things. Quite naturally, for a male prince, I might say.&quot;<br />
&quot;The witch cursed me with liking these stupid things! I don&#39;t! I swear!&quot;<br />
&quot;So now you do like these delicate items. Makes no difference to me. We can start on your hoard beginning tomorrow.&quot;<br />
He inhaled with longing Damon&#39;s skin and licked it with relish.<br />
&quot;You taste divine. Your smell is irresistible as well. My gem. My sweet diamond. My perfect jewel. My dearest. My mate.&quot;<br />
Damon, now Diamond, pleaded pitifully, dimly thinking that he was sorry for having inflicted this treatment on the girls he met. But he was too appalled by his own misfortune to really dwell on that. Self-pity predominated his mind, along with the incipient and extremely disturbing thoughts of wishing to have his hole filled by the massive dragon member and the pleasure holding, expelling and cooing at a clutch of eggs. Furthermore, the idea of having a collection of pink princess dolls filled him with anticipation. So when Ferocious penetrated her, Diamond pleaded yet again, but for more. Damon had taken the backseat in his mind. Her newfound mate was happy to oblige, panting, grunting and then moaning. Diamond couldn&#39;t believe she had been the least bit repulsed by the prospect. It was so fulfilling! In all senses of the word.<br />
<br />
When they were done, Diamond was thinking about the next time they would mate and the clutches of eggs she would eventually have. She&#39;d over them in soft fabrics and soft toys. She&#39;d steal down duvets and pillows, soft silk and velvet to make herself a more decent bed. She couldn&#39;t believe that she had denigrated princesses just yesterday. He would love to keep one captive and have tea with her. Ferocious would be happy to eat the knight and snatch their swords. Life was better, more interesting now. Princes were so self-absorbed and mean. They deserved to be devoured for bothering dragons. If a princess was not available, maybe dressing up a prince as a princess would be entertaining enough. It was worth a try. And they just wanted the body and kingdom of the princess, not to actually know her. She should know, she had been one not too long ago. And Ferocious was so handsome and pleasant to hear! Damon, now Diamond, slumbered on with pleasant dreams, an amazing mate and a womb filled with blissful promises of sweet babies.</p>
