<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Snake was rock hard as he surveyed his handiwork.  On the forehead of each player, Ryan now read through Master Snake's eyes were a list a various articles of clothing:<br />
<br />
Ricky : BK Leather Jeans<br />
Kevin : BK Leather T-Shirt <br />
Horst : LT BK Ath Sock<br />
Carter: RT BK Ath Sock<br />
Steve : BK Belt<br />
Hamid : Leopard Thong<br />
Larry : LT BK Glove<br />
Marty : RT BK GLove<br />
Ox    : Grey Coveralls<br />
Petey : A-Shirt<br />
Victor: Studded Leather Wristband (this covered his entire face)<br />
John  : Leather Armband<br />
Terry : Bath Sheet<br />
JJ    : BR Leather Jeans<br />
BJ    : Penis Pump<br />
Jimmy : RT BK Boot<br />
James : LT BK Boot<br />
AJ    : Snakeskin Shirt<br />
Richy : Wallet with chain<br />
Ryan  : Jock<br />
<br />
...and on the list went.  Before Ryan could digest all the names and the forms that Jason was going to have Vinnie give them, Jason &quot;Snake&quot; Tyler slammed the year book shut with a high level of satisfaction. He put both the catalogue and the yearbook into his backpack and dropped it out the open window above the carrel.  He exited the library, and retrieved the backpack from the bushes.<br />
<br />
Then he headed down to the boiler room, where he scored a bag of pills from the janitor. Then he headed toward the cafeteria. He scoped out the room, and his eyes locked on Vinnie who was waiting in line.<br />
<br />
Snake made a bee-line for Vinnie, and grabbed his elbow. He escorted Vinnie to the front of the line despite Vinnie's protests.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Vinnie, it's my treat.  It's the least I can do,&quot; Snake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's Ryan?&quot; Vinnie asked harshly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Ryan's hanging out where he feels most comfortable,&quot; Snake chuckled literally sticking his tongue in his cheek so it bulged out. He glanced down at his bulge significantly.<br />
<br />
Vinnie snorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come on.  Let's get some food and sit down, then all three of us can eat,&quot; Snake added with a wicked grin.<br />
<br />
There were voices from behind Vinnie telling him and Snake to keep moving. So Vinnie selected the meatloaf, potatoes and garlic bread.  Snake picked a salad, 2 burritos, and 2 bowls of chilli and a handful of breadsticks. They each grabbed a couple milks and Snake led Vinnie with his arm over Vinnie's shoulders straight to the empty table that Snake reserved for himself as his select friends.<br />
<br />
After they were seated, two guys approached, but Snake shooed them away, &quot;Later Mikey, Later Spike. Vinnie and me got business to discuss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vinnie frowned.<br />
<br />
Snake took a packet of crackers and crumpled it over one bowl of chilli.  He stirred it up and took a bite.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, this is great you got to try the chilli,&quot; Snake said.  He took the other bowl, and a packet of crackers. Ryan realized that with the crackers were some of the pills from Snake's pocket.  He crumbled them over the bowl and stirred it up. Then he set it in front of Vinnie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don't feel like chilli, Snake.  Besides, I already told you that Ryan cannot remain your jockstrap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, he's part of a team, and should be with his team mates,&quot; Snake agreed.<br />
<br />
This struck Vinnie as odd, but he wasn't sure what to say so he took a bite of the chilli.  He smacked his lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say this is better than I expected,&quot; Vinnie admitted.<br />
<br />
Snake smiled broadly.  Ryan heard him think this is working out just like I planned.<br />
<br />
Soon the two empty bowls sat on the table and the two young men ate the rest of their meal in silence. Vinnie was sure he had food poisoning.  He was sweating like a pig and felt weak all over.  Snake helped him walk down the hall toward the bathroom, but they stopped at a janitor's closet.Snake had the key to the door, and they went in.<br />
<br />
Vinnie was disoriented and confused, but Snake steadied and reassured him. The next thing he knew Snake was massaging Vinnie. He relaxed as Snake helped him out of his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're my best friend, Vinnie,&quot; Snake lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thanks, uh, Snake,&quot; Vinnie replied as he moaned with pleasure.  Snake knew all the points to apply pressure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me, Jace,&quot; Snake said, &quot;Only my best friends call me Jace.&quot; He tongued Vinnie as he whispered in his ear.<br />
<br />
Vinnie missed his next three classes, and soon was lip-locked by Jason.  Jason agreed repeatedly with Vinnie that Ryan and his team mates belonged together, but he also kept saying that Ryan was happiest wrapped around Jason's genitalia.  Snake glanced at his watch, and grinned.  The team would be just suiting up for practice now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vinnie, how did you do it? You know turn Ryan into my jockstrap?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not really sure.  I was just so angry that he'd stolen my jock and thrown it up on the ceiling fixture. I think I squeezed my medallion and wished that he would replace my jock, and then he did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think you could do it again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do it again?&quot; Vinnie asked in a vague disoriented tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, then Ryan and his team mates could be together again, when he's a garment and when he's human,&quot; Snake said.  He pulled out the yearbook and opened it to the page that he had dog-eared.<br />
<br />
&quot;The team photo?&quot; Vinnie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;See Ryan's forehead says, &quot;Jock&quot; on it?  And he's a jock, right?&quot; Jason asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Ryan's a jock,&quot; Vinnie laughed uncertainly as he patted the bulge in Snake's jeans, &quot;Ryan's your jockstrap.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Now see the words written on the other players' heads. Look a the first guy, Kevin, see the words Black Leather T-Shirt on his face.  Now imagine how good he would look as a black leather t-shirt being worn by me. Now recall your anger and squeeze your gold medallion. Now say, &quot;Kevin is Snake's Leather T-shirt.&quot; Concentrate and say it,&quot; Jason ordered gently.<br />
<br />
Vinnie laughed as if he was stoned, &quot;Yeah, Kevin is Snake's Leather T-shirt.&quot; His index finger rested just under Kevin's chin in the photo. In his mind he visualized Jason in a tight form fitting leather t-shirt.<br />
<br />
In the locker room, Kevin was chatting with Ricky as they stripped out of their street clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you seen Ryan? He was supposed to be in my class last period and he didn't show,&quot; Kevin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I was supposed to meet him for lunch,&quot; Ricky replied.  He noticed a shadow passing over Kevin. &quot;Are you okay, Kevin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I had the chilli for lunch,&quot; Kevin said with a belch, &quot;I don't feel so good.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ricky watched expecting Kevin to double over vomiting, and he prepared to jump out of the way.  Instead, Kevin seemed to dwindle getting thinner and thinner until he was almost a shadow. Kevin's blue jeans pooled in a heap at Kevin's feet along with his boxers. Then the shadowy form of Kevin seemed to shrink inward. A black leather t-shirt fell on top of the pile of Kevin's clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; Ricky said walking over to pick up the leather t-shirt. He looked at the label embroided on the inside of the shirt, it read simply, &quot;Property of Snake.&quot; He held up the t-shirt to examine it.  The wrinkles on the front of the shirt seemed to reshape into the image of Kevin's face screaming for help.<br />
<br />
Ricky dropped the shirt in fear and took two steps backward. He suddenly felt ill himself. Soon there was another heap of clothing. Ricky's boxer briefs lay under a leather pair of black jeans which were embroidered &quot;Property of Snake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Other players started disappearing only to be replaced by clothing embroidered &quot;Property of Snake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Coach Vickers emerged from his office as he heard first a commotion, and then an unusal silence.  His players were never this quiet when they were suiting up, and they wouldn't go out on the field until he'd come out to talk to them.  He raced out of his office to see a white faced Ox standing in terror clutching a leather boot and sobbing. Ox opened his mouth, but suddenly vanished or collapsed like the witch in the Wizard of Oz.<br />
<br />
Vickers looked around the locker room it was strewn with clothing, but empty of players.  In the spot where Ox had stood now lay a grey set of coveralls with its arms wrapped around the boot Ox had held. The coveralls were embroidered, &quot;Snake.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boot had red lettering inside it identifying it as property of Snake. The coach took a few steps, then he sat down on the bench.  He felt light headed.  He could hear his heart beating loudly like the ticking of a clock.<br />
<br />
Snake left an exhausted Vinnie sleeping in the janitor's closet, and sprinted to the locker room to collect his bounty.  Snake grinned as he picked up the chrome plated pocket watch.  It was engraved Property of Snake. He kissed it and pocketed the former coach.  He proceeded to search through the clothing collecting his new wardrobe, and souvenirs from the former players. He used a few of leather team gym bags to carry away his booty.<br />
<br />
His plan had worked like a dream.  Still when the meds wore off, Vinnie might be a problem. He dropped the leather bags and sat down on a locker room bench to think about what to do with Vinnie.  He hadn't thought this out as well as he should have.<br />
<br />
If he got Vinnie to turn himself into Snake's cock ring would everyone else stay changed, or would they change back to normal?  Could Vinnie even change himself, or was that even possible?  Besides if he got Vinnie to change into something else, he wouldn't be able to get Vinnie to change anyone else. Maybe he could bully Vinnie into obedience? Maybe he should just take the amulet away, maybe that was the source of the power, and it wasn't really Vinnie at all.  He'd have to test that theory.</p>
