<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha Twist was busy as the Town Chancellor of Moon Lake. Acting as a liaison with new residents of Moon Lake and at times, the deputy mayor When Martin Stovall is out of town. Disentangling herself from the furry arms of her lover and life partner, Frances Twist; Samantha gets out of bed as he head to the washroom to do her morning ablutions.<br />
<br />
Currently Samantha had a full plate on her paws. A double wedding commencing on Saturday with two new were-foxes; Harold Jenkins and Jenny Harper. A happy affair in its own right; yet currently marred by the shadow of Dieter Weilhelm.* Twice the man from Alabama sent men to try and kill Harold Jenkins. The first man committing suicide after he was arrested for trespassing and being held for other crimes. The second man was currently in jail after shooting the wrong Jenkins. Thinking he shot the man who was going to marry Jenny; Dieter’s second henchman soon found himself facing the wrong end of several charges that if found convicted of, he could be facing a very long jail sentence.<br />
<br />
With the possibility of Jenny’s family and Dieter showing up to personally stop the wedding themselves; couple the fact that after Lionel Ulysses was capture in mid transformation. His were-rat tail in full display for all to see. The captured man was soon murdered while in police custody, recovering from a gunshot wound. The entire town was naturally on edge; the possibility of exposure being very real and having to prepare contingencies in case the secret that were’s exist got out.<br />
<br />
These were issues racing through Samantha’s mind as she got out of the bathroom. Showered, defurred and wearing a large terry cloth robe as she headed to the closet to put on a suit for the day. It was at this time that Frances began to stir.<br />
“Morning love,” Frances opening her eyes to see her partner’s backside to her; naked and looking inviting to the were-cat that was still furry.<br />
“Morning Frances,” Samantha answering back; putting on her undergarments before turning around to give her partner a kiss. “Sorry for getting up early; I want to get a big start on the day and I need to talk to a co-worker over a possible favor for later this evening.”<br />
<br />
“Favor,” Frances stretching; her tail shuddering as the were-cat yawns. “What is this about?”<br />
“You remember how Lionel Ulysses was caught?” Samantha putting on a skirt and blouse.<br />
“How could I not,” Frances’s mood souring; “his rat tail forming after being shot. That body camera of the police officer showing Lionel’s transformation was not welcoming sight.”<br />
“Well the FBI agent that was investigating Lionel for murder of Jen Decker’s husband,” Samantha speaking; “is Ted Green and he is planning to move here to Moon Lake along with his wife Marci once he retires from the FBI.”<br />
“So you got another couple to inform about one of them becoming the family were,” Frances nodding.”<br />
“Marci is already on of us,” Samantha talking; “its Ted that is a normal. The two have been married for years and have not been able to consummate it. Marci is a were-cat like us,” Samantha grinning.<br />
“Oh,” Frances putting on her robe but not heading to the bathroom just yet; “so this favor?”<br />
“Is finding someone who will assist Ted Green in becoming a were-tiger or a were-lion,” Samantha speaking; “I have a co-worker in mind for the were-tiger. Lila Carpenter**,” Samantha finished getting dressed; “I just have yet to talk to her. As for the were-lion, I’m going to have to pay a visit to Leon Talbot*** and get his help.”<br />
“You don’t know many were-lions,” Frances nodding; “apart from the lion king and his wife. But isn’t Lila straight? And is this the same Lila whose brother killed her abusive boyfriend?”<br />
“The same,” Samantha nodding; “The Carpenters are good people. Lila just got attached to the wrong person and it ended badly when the man became too possessive after becoming a were-tiger.”<br />
“But that happened a few years ago if I recall,” Frances now heading to the bathroom; “Both Lila and Rick spent several hours with me talking about it. Have they come to grips with self-defense murder?”<br />
“You tell me,” Samantha speaking through the closed door; “you’re the therapist. I’ll meet you downstairs for breakfast. Can you wake Ben up once you are done?”<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Ted Green woke up first in the morning. His skin brushing up against Marci’s fur as he moved his body. Ted wanted to enjoy his wife’s company in a more intimate fashion; yet she was a were-cat and her were-species was mono-gendered. The were-virus within her would kill him in his current state. For them to enjoy the benefits of a married were-couple; Ted would need to become a were. Technically any were would do, but Ted and Marci have agreed it was to be a large cat. A were-tiger or were-lion; two were-species that Ted was stilling tossing about in his head.<br />
<br />
Wrapping his arms around his wife, Ted notices Marci has started to purr; the were-cat starting to stir as she moves her paws currently protected in heavy gloves so as not to scratch Ted to were his hands lay on her body.<br />
“I hope you are ready,” Marci purring; “tonight you get to be a new and younger looking man.”<br />
“And we get to be a proper couple afterwards,” Ted rubbing his body up on Marci’s furry backside; his penis getting erect from the arousal he is experiencing.<br />
“Patience Ted,” Marci feeling his member grow and swell; “we’ll have that fun tonight.”<br />
“I can’t help it,” Ted chuckling; “I’m just so excited for tonight.”<br />
“Same here,” Marci removing Ted’s hands and getting up; “after we become husband and wife properly, we start looking for a house in Moon Lake to settle down in and raise a litter.”<br />
“When will Samantha call us,” Ted getting up; wanting to hug Marci and explore her furry body some more.<br />
“Not until when we are on the road,” Marci purring; Ted’s touch being quite pleasing to her. “It’s still early in the morning after all.”<br />
“Then let’s get some breakfast,” Ted giggling; Marci’s tail brushing up on his exposed member, tickling him. “Maybe take in a few sights that Seattle has to offer before we have to go?”<br />
“That sounds like wonderful plan to me,” Marci turning around to give her husband a loving lick with her feline tongue.<br />
<br />
<br />
* As currently transpiring in the Anderson story line<br />
** Readers of the Moon Lake Earth 2 story line will be familiar with the Lila Carpenter character that TheMaskedWriter introduced way back around July of 2016 and the background that she worked at city hall as an accountant.<br />
*** While in the Moon Lake Earth 2 Story line, it has been established that Leon Talbot has a bi-sexual daughter by the name of Jean Talbot who has become Nate Anderson&#39;s mate. It has yet to be established if she exists in this Moon Lake universe.</p>
